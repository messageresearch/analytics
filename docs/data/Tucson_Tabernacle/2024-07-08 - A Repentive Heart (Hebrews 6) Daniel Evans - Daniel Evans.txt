Hebrews chapter 6 verse1 says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on un Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and laying on of hands and of Resurrection from the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing They Crucified themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame amen you can be seated very strong words from the apostle that wrote this book of Hebrews

Simeon and pH and sister filla God bless you welcome they're from all the way they they're originally from Congo kinasa um I just heard and I'm sorry I didn't know but I just heard brother barudi

like 30,000 Believers just in that group and and that's that's where your all's roots are from am I right from kinasa welcome God God bless you and I heard him pray it's good to have well before I say

labors brother Ed and sister Kathy God bless you welcome welcome home I'm going to twist brother Ed into giving us a report of his trip he went to some really special places and uh had some special experiences and I think it'll be a blessing to all of us um and then uh as you heard we're going to lose brother Josiah and sister Katie for a little while and I love those kids you know just such a blessing to us and the singing and the playing and the talent that they brought to our church and the spirit that they brought to our church we're going to miss you but God be with you and and take care of you and bring us bring you back home to us safely go God bless you uh you know I'm just thankful I'm thankful for all the the Lord has provided for our Church he's just he's so good to us brother Josiah sister Katie brother Michael Walters here and playing and leading songs and and then we have the three tremendous piano players and um and our and our musicians there and and with my son Daniel and and all the people that work so hard for the church brothers and sisters never never remember never never forget to thank them and and to give them some gratitude because it's a lot of work all that the Petersons do all that the dugles do and the garas do it's so much and uh just don't forget to say thank you sometimes I I know that they would appreciate it um it's it's good it's it's good to be Associated and we're going to hear from this book of Hebrews chapter 6 that that those people are examples to all of us they should be appreciated and and they should be imitated um I wanted to tell a story Daniel told me a story yesterday um he he called me up and he was on his way home what he did is he went to help a friend move and uh his uh his friend he knows him from the gym I guess and and he's getting a divorced from his wife and and Daniel helped him get all of his stuff out of the house and um he called me up yesterday and he was just ready to cry and Daniel said dad he says he says that people his first words were he talked about the the problems and he said he would go in and there was cameras in the house looking at them looking at what they were doing and and um he uh couldn't touch certain things in the house and you can imagine a home that was once to a married couple just falling into that where it's just pure hatred of each other and Daniel was when he called me yesterday he was just ready to cry and he said dad he says he said it's it's just so bad and and one of the things that he said he says people say they believe in God but they really don't and and I warned him and this is for young people people that this decision that you make on who you marry and who you join yourself to and I told Daniel I said I said buddy you can have it like I do that is just filled with joy and I and I have a wonderful wife and we have a good relationship or you can have it like these people do that you just met that this man and it's just a it's a curse upon you so be so so careful who you're dating who who you set your eyes on to marry because it could ruin your life and Daniel witnessed that witnessed that yesterday where it's just hatred and problems and and just and it's it's just misery but then if you find the right one it's a blessing and it's a it's a blessing every day um and then I was talking with a uh just when Daniel said that it just it made me think that that people say that they're Christians they say they believe in God but do they really that it's fun to say it but when it comes right down to it and we're going to get into this in the book of Hebrews do you really believe and are you willing to make the sacrifices that God requires I was talking with the cabinet guy in my house on Friday or Saturday Friday and he was he we were just talking about the cabinet and really really nice man and um he lives up he lives up in Phoenix now he just moved his family and and he was just nervous and and I started talking to him about his personal life and and it sounds like he had kind of a breakdown during Co he he just saw all of this coming in and it really scared him and he he just was really struggling and and I told him I said do you know do you know God and he he responded said I I don't know he says when I was little we were catholic and um and he says I I even worked sometimes at on the Altar and and and took up the offering and and he said but no he says I don't know and I told him I said I said you know that there is is a God and he's real and just me saying those words tears came to this man's eyes and he he put his head down and I said and he cares about you and he cares about me and he just he was he was feeling like I I could feel it he says oh he says I'm I'm starting to get emotional and what struck me so much in this conversation we talked for about an hour in my house about the Lord what struck me so much is Just The Mention Of God could bring such a response from somebody who had never been to church someone that who didn't know and didn't understand him but it brought such a a response because he could I could tell he knew that there is a God there is someone over on the other side that can take care of him that knows him I was just so taken back and he said I said well do you pray he says no he says I don't have time to prepare to pray he says I'm working all the time and I'm driving down from Phoenix and and I and I asked him I said well you're driving down from Phoenix I said so that's about 4 hours of travel time I said you can't talk to him then that's four hours and he said yeah I guess I guess I could he says but I have to prepare to talk to him he says he says and I can't I can't prepare to do it and I said that's an excuse and he wasn't trying to give me an excuse he was serious he didn't feel worthy to go before the Lord and I asked him I said uh we're made in the image of God and I said you're a father and you love your children I said answer this for me do your children have to prepare to come talk to you and he said no I said and neither do you have to prepare to go talk to talk to the Lord just talk to him he's a father go and and as you're driving talk to him and I said tell him your problems tell him what you're struggling with I said he'll listen to you and I said and then he'll speak back I said he'll speak in his own way it might not come the way that you think it'll come but it will come to you I said just give him a little bit of time and you have the time to do it none of us are too busy and it was just it was a nice nice conversation and it it just struck me just The Mention Of An Almighty God and how that brings that that um that emotion and and that tie to him I wanted to share something with the church um I had a dream on Monday night and I uh it really shook me up and I was asking the Lord and and I'm telling this uh cabinet guy had a talk with the Lord and then and then me I'm asking him and I I'm having trouble getting answers and and I'm like Lord do you want me to share do you not me want me to share it and I don't I didn't tell him that part about how how sometimes it is a struggle to get an answer but I was I was I was up in a hotel up in sholo on Monday night and I uh I had a dream that we had this this puppy and there was there was a bunch of us around and and and um we had this little puppy and people were kind of passing it around it was just the cutest little thing and um we were out in the yard and there was a a like a footer that had been dug and it was about I'd say 3 feet long and may maybe 2 feet wide and it was about maybe 3 feet deep and inside this rectangular footer there was a um rebar at the bottom like uh like you would pour to reinforce the concrete and then right at the level of the rebar the rebar was maybe a foot um above the the the bottom of the of the trench there of the footer and then at right filled up in that uh in that footer it must have rained because there was just a a really soupy um mud like like like a very liquid mud at the bottom so I I'm standing next to this footer and they they had let the little puppy um run around and the puppy jumped into the footer kind of fell in there and he went under the the soupy mud and I looked at him and I thought this is just a little little footer and and you know he he just he jumped in there so I hesitated for a minute and in my mind it was just for a second in my mind I thought well he he'll be okay I'll just reach in and and get him out and he started he started trying to swim and he went under the the soupy mud and I couldn't see him so I I got down and I reached down and I started digging around in the in the mud trying to find him and I and I I felt something and I pulled it up and it was a it was like a a stingray fish and it was something that dwells in the mud if you know what what a stingray is they they swim around in the mud and I and I pulled it up and and I discarded it and then I started to get nervous I couldn't find them so I'm I'm feeling around in there and then I I I found something else and I and I pulled it up and it was a catfish something again that dwells in the mud and I and I grabbed it and I I I threw it away and then I started going around and and when I was pulling these things up it was those those animals that dwell in that environment this puppy wasn't made for that environment so finally I get it and I pull this puppy out and it's lifeless I finally find it and I'm thinking how am I going to revive this this puppy I should have just grabbed him right before he went under and then I woke up and I really feel and it lines up with this book of Hebrews that when something happens when someone is in need to go to them right away grab them and pull them out don't let it sit or if the Lord lays something on your heart to do do it don't just wait go forward because something may be dependent on what you're doing and that that dog that that puppy was dependent on me and I I didn't fulfill my responsibilities I just waited just just a little bit too much and it it was a failure and I don't know what it means but I feel like the Lord is saying hey don't delay if you have something on your heart whether it be for this church or what whatever it is move forward go because life of an innocent creature may be at stake and it could be your children it could be a niece or a nephew or a brother or a sister It Whatever It Is don't delay reach out to that person because they they could be they could be lost this writer of Hebrews it seems like he has that same burden to get the people to move forward in the gospel and don't just stand around and wait and don't sit back and relax but go and and put this this gospel into action Hebrews 61 let's read it again therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God and of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and resurrection of the dead and and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permits you know read that this will we do if God permits what does the author mean here and I must I must say that every time in my life that I've read that scripture and it's been many times I didn't quite get it until now and I believe I do understand it but to properly understand it let's go back to what we talked about last I believe we talked about last Sunday night let's go back to Hebrews chap 5 verse 12 and then this will go and Lead right into this Hebrews 6 Hebrews 5:12 says this for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a baby but strong meat belongeth to them that are full of age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil by by reason of use their senses are tun moed for discernment of Good and Evil by reasons of use they're constantly in the word they're praying they're about the father's business so their senses are tuned to discernment there's a story that my brother told me about an uh Indian a Native American long time ago that met that had a friend a um a white man and they they were close friends and this Indian had never been to the big city where the white man lived so he one day he he's he's coming to visit the white man and they're they're they're going along and this Indian's looking around like wow this is I've never seen anything like this big city and it's just cars going everywhere and all the noise and everything and they're walking along the sidewalk and the Indian stops and he says do you hear that white man says uh what I hearing all the cars and all the bustling and all that that and he says no he says do you hear that cricket and he says no Cricket he says I hear a cricket so he he walks over to the to to the to the edge of the sidewalk and he walks and he sees this trellis of of these Vines and he gets there and he he listens and he he sees the vines here and he slowly opens up the vines and there's a cricket making its noise and the white man looks at him and he says how how did you hear that how did you hear that noise from that little bug and and the Indian says watch this he goes into his pocket and he pulls out a 50 cent piece I don't know if they even make those anymore but he pulls out a 50 cent piece and he says watch this and they're all this this people on the sidewalks and stuff and he throws it up and it hits the sidewalk ding ding ding ding and everybody around him stops and looks down at the at the 50 cent piece that he had dropped and he goes back over and he picks it up and he puts it back in his pocket and he says and and the man says he says wow he says you're hearing he says the Native American hearing is much better than the white man's hearing he said no no no it's not he says it's what's my hearing tuned to he said when I dropped that 50 cent piece he said it was no louder than the cricket he said but did you notice everybody heard that noise but they didn't hear this Cricket over here he said my ears are tuned to that let me re let me quote him what he said he said do you realize my friend said the Indian that the Ring of the 50 cent piece was no louder than the chirp of the cricket and still many white people heard it and turned around on the other hand I was the only one that heard the cricket the reason for that is not that an Indian can hear better than the white man no the reason is that we always hear very well the things we are accustomed to paying attention to wow and that is us that what we are accustomed to hearing and what matters the most to us is what our senses are attuned to and the the author here is saying that their senses are tuned to discernment and and to to know good from evil but he says that yours aren't verse number 14 but solid food is in uh chapter 5 thank you but solid food is for the mature who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil but then in the next sentence he writes something that seems contrary to what he had just said so he says but solid food is for the mature who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from Evil therefore therefore so it leads into something else Hebrews 61 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards god of the doctrine of baptisms and on laying out of hands and of resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit notice that he says leave the doctrine of Christ I didn't understand that but he's not not talking about leaving the doctrines that Christ preached he's not talking about leaving Jesus because he wasn't high enough it's not Jesus plus something else he's saying that you leave the doctrine of what you've argued about for years and years and years is he the son of David is he the son of Joseph is he going to be a military King is he going to be a lion is he going to be a lamb is he going to be a literal Messiah or is it just an ideology that's what he's talking about he's saying that you're still trying to explain the Messiah and he's come now take what he said and put it into action and he says the doctrine of of the ceremonial washing of baptism that Doctrine goes all the way back to Deuteronomy Leviticus a laying on of hands and the resurrection of the Dead if you were part of our Bible study on the book of Acts you see that the Pharisees and the Sadducees they were all always at odds with each other because one says that there is a resurrection and one says that there's not and he's saying get away from those doctrines and those those endless those endless um debates and eternal judgment the Pharisees believed that there was a life after the Sadducees believed that that it was just here on Earth there getting back into the old arguments and the old Hebrew Traditions he's saying Christ has come don't fall back into that move on to Perfection What the author is saying he said you don't need a constant repetitive sermon about the fundamentals of Judaism but they need to take what they already know and put it into action he's warning them last week we had Hebrews chapter 12 I mean chapter 4 and verse 12 it said for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper sharper than any two-edge sword piercing even under the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart when he says it's quick and it's powerful that word quick means alive it's not dead constantly talking about the definition of of what a prophet is or what a messiah is or these things it's it's alive and it's powerful and Powerful means that it does something it's not a dead religion and this author is saying get to that move on don't get stuck on the definitions verse one therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go unto Perfection he's not as I said he's not talking about Jesus here he's talking about the Messiah that has been prophesied to come and they've been trying to Define all of these years now that he came you don't need to to redefine it to put it in today's perspective and and this letter when he wrote that I imagine that this could have been very very offensive to what he said what he said to these people he said leaving leave the principles and move on to Perfection and he might have got the response saying are you saying I'm not filled with the Holy Ghost he said you know brother I had an experience when I was 18 years old and and I go back to that place he's saying listen don't be satisfied that you've come to the Altar and you've had a perspective or that you can call yourself Christ or that you've been baptized don't be satisfied with those things keep moving keep going don't don't stop and become deaden continue talked about last week we talked about the Sabbath and to have that rest remember the Sabbath is rest to have that rest that we were talking about last week that God rested from his Works remember he created the heavens and the earth I gave that long history of of of the things that we had to know and went all the way to Levi and Judah when we started in Genesis and God rested on that seventh day Naturally Speaking Naturally Speaking you have to work to earn rest you have to you have to it's not it's not just that you're going to rest or I'm just resting in Jesus Christ I understand that but there was a day of rest and what produced that day of rest was six days of working so there is a need for rest if you're not working if you're not doing anything what need do you have for rest you're resting all the time anyways and he's trying to say that that when you when you come into Christ all of those labors and and everything and all of the the the burden that you carried you can just unload them on Jesus and now that you can have this day of rest and he's saying quit drinking milk talking about the Messiah and about the baptism resurrection and all of that and put God's promises into action in the work environment I've seen so many intelligent capable people live below their potential because they don't they don't hold themselves to a higher standard they don't put they don't put in more hours than they're required to at work they don't stick with a career they don't always there's always something bigger and better and some get getrich scheme and it always it never involves good hard work and you see it so often you see so many people fail Daniel and I were eating at Subway the other day and we we sat down and and and I saw one of the people in the store he gets up and he leaves and I looked at my watch and it was 558 and I'm not a stickler on that stuff but he got off at 6 put in a little extra time and you'll be successful if that's just a job fine but the person that works harder the person that has dedication is the person that's owning the store that's the person that's going to be successful wow and if I can just give a little bit of real life experience and and a little bit of real life teaching here put in extra time if you want to be successful kids fail their tests because they don't spend enough time studying husbands and wives are fighting because each is not willing to put the desires and the feelings of the other person first people are successful in their jobs because they're constantly moving and they won't stick with anything when they're at work they spend a few minutes they won't just spend a few minutes more in being successful they're not successful because they're not willing to do more that is your life lesson here today as far as work and the same goes for your walk with the Lord It's if you want Miracles if you want to have this Supernatural experience then how much time do you spend in prayer if you want to speak in tongues how much do you serve other people if you want to if you want God to serve you and fill you with his Spirit then why are you trying to get in front of the next guy on the highway why aren't you yielding to someone else you're a Christian in your car just like you're a Christian on the highway you want to be a representative of Jesus Christ but you're fighting with your husband and your wife so what if she did you wrong so what if you in your mind you think that that person Did You Wrong they G they did Jesus wrong and he still gave his life for them according to First Corinthians the man represents Christ in the home he should be the one that raises above you say that God sent a prophet and you believe him but you draw a circle around the bride and say that those only those who believe can step inside this circle and you say that you believe the same one that came to tear down the denominational Spirit no you should be teaching these things he's saying you understand you should be teaching these things but instead you're just drinking milk we have no excuse Hebrews 6:4 for it is impossible possible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come the truth has come in their minds and they've received a revelation of Jesus Christ they had an experience at a camp or they had an experience at a service where the minister maybe said something that that they were just thinking that was on their heart and they experienced the Heavenly gift they may have felt the power of the Holy Ghost and they maybe they repented and they made a commitment to change and maybe they were baptized you've tasted the good word you've had this experience and the powers of the coming age you know what they are but you keep going back to those experiences and you ignore what it is today I had a I had an experience one of the most powerful experiences I've ever had in my life I was a I was a counselor at a youth camp and there was a young man who just did not care about the Lord he didn't there was nothing about him that I saw any potential in that young man and I just kept reaching out to him trying to love him and and he was there because his mom signed him or his dad signed him up and he didn't want to go and he was just there to to have a good time he's going to try to have a good time day by day went by and that hard shell softened a little bit and then the Sunday morning service we finished service it was a good service I don't think it was anything out of the ordinary and everybody started to leave and he sat right in his seat pretty much then everyone was gone except for me standing like acting like as a deacon and him in the audience rest of the whole building was empty whole area was empty so I walked up to him his head down and uh I said so what's going on and he says I uh I can't do it I said okay I said well I said I'll tell you what I don't have anywhere to be for about a week so I'll just stay with you and he said I just don't think I can do it and I said I'll tell you what let's go out and we had a little area to pray and I said let's go out to this area there a little tent I said let's go sit in there and let's talk about it so we go in there and there was two chairs in there and and we had this complete privacy and uh we um started talking and and he said I can't do it and I saidd do what and he says I just can't make the commitment and I said okay um that's fine we started we talked a little bit more and he said he says I just can't do it I said let me ask you this I said do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and he says yes I do I said well according to the Bible if you really believe him then you're saved I said I tell you what when we leave I'll just tell people that you really believe in the Lord and you got your salv and you recognize your salvation today he said no I said but what's going on is the Lord wants to fill you with his Holy Spirit and when I said that I heard an eagle scream out and I thought that's weird and I said did you hear that and he goes what I was like oh man this is I'm going I'm going into Uncharted Territory now and so IAL I talked to him a little bit more and I said I said brother I said what God wants to do he wants to bring you past just saying that you're saved and he wants his Spirit to dwell Within you and it screamed out again as soon as I said that wow it's like whoa said you didn't he goes what I was like oh man okay so then we start talking and I said I'll tell you what you just sit right there and I'll just stay here with you and you just keep making this decision and he says I can't do it and I said well then why don't you to leave he says no and he looked up he says I need to be maybe I need to be baptized and I said yeah baptize you I said uh but what Good's that going to do he goes nothing he'd been baptized before he said nothing I said brother I said God wants to fill you with the Holy Spirit we sat for a little while longer and I have never felt in my life the presence the power of the presence that I felt that kid jerked up in his chair and leaned back and said I'll do it and a flood of the Holy Spirit came into into that tent and I was just like whoa you know I was had the chills all over me and and we got up and we prayed and we got up and we walked outside and he said look how green the grass is look how beautiful this is he said look at how pretty that look at how blue the sky is and he was just so happy and and that the Holy Spirit was just on him and this was a tremendous experience one of the most as I said one of the most powerful experiences I've ever had and he was so excited and he stayed with it man he loved the Lord and and he stayed in touch with me after and as time went by he started to drift back and it was a worldly girl and he told her he said I told him I said what's going to happen is this girl is going to say that she's going because she loves you she's going to say that she believes like you do and he said okay and I told him a story about a situation that I went through and and and he actually was reading his Bible and he was reading in in in uh he just opened up his Bible and he said Lord show me if I am supposed to be with this girl or not he opened up his Bible to the Book of Proverbs and and uh Proverbs or huh yeah and it said that it talked about world women and Solomon fell because of worldly women he looked at it and the girl says no she says I'll start going to church with you I'm not saying that somebody can't come to the Lord but it started drifting away in that excitement when he left him after a few weeks the girl ended up leaving him too by the way and and he drifted away and it didn't come back verse six and if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame your testimony with this young man your testimony speak speaks so loud I can't hear what you're saying your life what you do every day and if you claim to be a Christian you claim to have had an experience and then you go and you get mad at the person on the other side of the counter and lose your testimony you are putting Christ you're crucifying him again and putting him to an open shame because they look at you your testimony you're saying I'm a Christian oh this is how a Christian acts wow this represents Jesus Christ I don't want any of that that's come on I don't want to be part of what you are some of the meanest people some of the the most vitory all that I've seen comes from religious circles and we put Jesus on the cross again and it says in there and this is one of the things just such a beautiful chapter I didn't understand this it says let me read it again if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance when there is repentance there is always Grace am no matter this young man no matter how someone can be can can receive a a gift at the altar or come to church and make the and make the commitment I'm going to do it I'm going to do it and then they drift away and they may become an enemy of God but if they can come back to repentance if they can actually repent and say I'm sorry there is always Grace there it will always be there amen but there is a time when that repentance that desire to repent will leave and that's what he's saying here saying it's impossible for that person to come back because there's no repentance but if there is repentance there will always always be Grace but if there's none there's no apology there's no confession of sin then the world sees that this man or the woman this woman claims to be a Christian and that's how a Christian acts and it puts Christ to an open shame shames him because you're attaching yourself to his name otherwise brothers and sisters when you feel the holy spirit in church or you're listening to a song or you're hearing a sermon or you're just soaking in the blessings as Jesus pours out he he's pouring out those blessings on the entire Earth and you're just you're just loving it and praising it and and you're just thinking I I just love this I love the love that is shown to me I love the way that people are acting and I just it's just so wonderful that that blessing can come on a Christian or it can come on an atheist both of them appreciate it Jesus said on The Sermon on the Mount he said but I tell you love your enemies and pray for those that persecute you that you may be children of your father in Heaven he causes his son to rise on the evil and on the good and send rain sends reain on the righteous and on the unrighteous and if you love those who love you what reward do you get are not even the tax collectors doing that so he's saying he pours out that Spirit when you're feeling that Holy Spirit anybody can feel that you're feeling the blessings of God and he's just watering his plants and then others will benefit from that watering verse number seven for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receive the blessing from God the NIV version says this in verse 7 it's another translation it says land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessings of God God so when the rain is falling in the hot and dry times of the year all of the plants are rejoicing the sticker bushes they're rejoicing and you see that they're putting out their leaves the plants in your garden are rejoicing over the water but one the trees are are rejoicing but one is a True Believer and the other one is just there to enjoy the blessings but that which beareth thorns and Briars is rejected and nigh and is nigh unto the unto cursing whose end is to be D burned this analogy is all over the New Testament by the way Jesus gave the parable of the sewer sewing seeds and and as he mentioned on the sermon of the mount and and where he's he's talking about the rainfalls on the just and on the unjust he's talking about the wheat and the tears growing together in another place and that Harvest time they're separated the wheat is put into the Garners and the weeds are burned they're bundled up the wheat goes into storage Jesus also said he said you will know them by their fruits I want to give an analogy it may seem a little bit juvenile but I uh I want to give an example of what this says something that maybe will stick in your mind Moses come up here for a minute no the Moses that that's yeah looking through your glasses all right Moses come here here and stand on the pulpit yeah right here God bless you my friend it's good to see you too Moses put your hands up like this yeah face face the crowd put your no right here put your hands up now what kind of a tree is Moses a what he's a beautiful tree what kind of a tree a palty he burn black what what are what kind of a tree is Moses Ironwood any other thoughts K what kind of a tree pinee pine tree yeah now hold this what kind of a tree is Moses an apple tree how did you know by his fruits do you understand thanks Brothers you can go back thanks bro you want do you want remember that so what kind of fruit are you giving forth when someone looks at you are you crucifying Christ aresh how are you acting what fruit are you known by because they're going to look at us and they do every day and you can say that man and that woman they're truly a Christian or they're fake man they're not real they're the Briars and the thorns and the thistles and all of that stuff but we we all make mistakes we all do it we all do things wrong but that Christian when that Christian comes back and says hey I'm sorry I talked you wrong remember that when you had that testimony about how how you went to that man and you apologize and they could see that that's a Christian then all of that that you did before it was gone and now that person might even have a higher opinion of you now that you've apologized and you've repented than they did before because that's what a Christian does a Christian repents but if there is no repentance then it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have partaken partaken of the Heavenly gift if they shall they can't come back because there's nothing in them to come back verse number nine but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak for God is Not unrighteous to forget your word and labor of love which you have showed toward his name in that you ministered to the Saints and did Minister as I was reading that as I was reading all the way down until Hebrews chapter to to Hebrews verse 9 I was pretty down as I was pretty harsh and then when I get to verse 9 but beloved we are persuaded better things of you like all of these these things I'm warning you against against there's better things about you and the things that accompany salvation though although we thus speak for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and your labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and do minister so these works of serving the people with labors of Love accompany salvation it's part of it serving each other once you receive once you understand your salvation the first thing you want to is help others you're so grateful of what God has done for you that you want to give more of yourself Matthew chapter 6 says don't give your offerings in front of people or to outwardly bring attention to yourself as a Christian when you do that you're rewarding yourself already the Bible says you already have your reward because others are watching you but Jesus said go into your Closet in private and pray in secret and then God will reward you openly and if you truly have a burden for what you're praying for your open reward will be that God answered your prayers because that's the desire of your heart it's not that you're exalted it's that that person that is suffering is healed or that comes to the Lord God will ultimately get the glory and we desire desire verse number 11 um Hebrews chapter 6 and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope Until the End again he's warning us this book of Hebrews it's it's a warning and he continues on saying listen be careful this isn't just I know you say you're a Christian but there's there's something you got to stay with this constantly tuning your senses back on in Hebrews chapter 4 it says let us therefore fear lest the promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should come short of it he's warning be careful don't come short of this rest this sabbath then in chapter two he says wherefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast in every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward everything was punished for what it did how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard them God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed in his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope and the end those who are working for the Lord serving the SL Saints cleaning the church giving rides to people that need need rides to go to church helping the young people praying all hours of the day giving offerings on top of your tithes giving to the poor doing everything that you can for the Lord's work they are examples to all of us and the Bible says that we should mimic should should imitate those people verse number 12 that you be not slothful but followers of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises the word followers it's Old English today it means imitators of those who through the faith and patient inher inherit the promises there are some people who are giving their all for the gospel I know we can always do more but he's telling us to do the same there's there's there's brothers and sisters today this this world today is Serve Yourself but there's really there's people that have come to church do you think they always want to come to church no but they're coming there's people that are picking up other people and bringing them to church do you think they always want to do that no there's people who are working out on the grounds all the time and helping do you think that they want to do that not all the time no but it's important to them because they see the benefits there's people that give to the poor do you think they always want to give to the poor no but they do it anyways and the book of Hebrews is a command to put God into action and and not just rev the engine put it in a Dy D and go somewhere if you're just revving the engine you're just making noise it's not real the engine doesn't do any good if it doesn't drive the car the book of Hebrews is to a command over and over and over put this into action but the world now more than ever is slothful as this scripture says it's slothful in the things concerning the Lord think about it let's bring it home how many times do I swipe before I pray how many times do I swipe before I read my Bible how many times do I swipe before I go to church we're swiping our lives away wasting time and doesn't do any good and those people who this book commands us to imitate are the ones who are making a difference they might not want to come to church but they're doing it they might not want to pick up someone else as I as I said but they're doing it they might not want to give their more than their tithes but they're doing it they might not want to stay up late talking to their children but they're doing it they might not want to reach out to their nieces and nephews and cousins and encourage their walk with the Lord they may not always want to do it but they're doing it they overcome that and the book tells us to be PR patient and to keep praying and to have faith because God remembers his promises I'm running out of time verse number 13 for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by him himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee what he's talking about is when when Abraham received the promised son Isaac and then God tells Abraham hey this kid that you have that you and your your wife are so happy about and that you love so much take him up on Mount Mariah there and kill him as a sacrifice to me Abraham can you imagine how he felt he took the child they go up on the mountain child looks around he says Dad uh we're coming up here to make a burnt offering we've got the bundle of sticks and we built the altar but where's the sacrifice Abraham says son God will provide for himself a sacrifice fully intending to do what God said he takes the child lays him there let's take five minutes let's take a couple minutes and read it it's worth it Genesis chapter 22 I believe it is verse 15 says this so Abraham's has his child there he's he's going to do the he's going to have the burnt offering he's going to kill the sacrifice his son doing exactly what God required of him and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven a second time and said I'm sorry let's uh when Abraham went to kill this the CH the the child the the Lord stopped him and then he sees this Ram that's caught with his head in the bushes and God had provided that verse number 14 and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah gyri that is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen so he sacrificed this Ram instead of his son but he fully intended to do what God told him and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven a second time and said by myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and Hast not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessings I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply Thee I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of the enemies of his enemies and thy seed shall all be shall all be shall all the nations of the earth be blessed and because thou Hast obeyed my voice so back to Hebrews that is what this author of Hebrews is re is re um referring to saying that you are going to be blessed because like Abraham you put God first and so and speaking of Abraham verse number 15 and so after he had patiently aded endured he obtained the promise so he didn't have to wait when God made him the promise that he was going to have a son he didn't have to wait for a day for Sarah to say I'm pregnant he didn't have to wait for months he didn't have to wait for years he had to wait for decades still holding to God's promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of Promise the IM immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath immutable means unchanging in NIV translation of that verse says because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to The Heirs of what was promised he confirmed it with an oath he promised to us I will never leave you or forsake you earlier in Hebrews he said that he is the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he knows how it is God doesn't didn't know how it was to suffer he's the Eternal God he never suffered he didn't know how it was for his friends to forsake Him He was God so he came down to earth in the form of a man so that he could suffer what we suffer and so that he could understand it and that by two immutable unchanging things in which it was possible for in which it was impossible for God to lie that we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the hope that is set before us strong consolation is strong encouragement that you can have refuge in Christ if he could do what he he did with Abraham give him a son in his old age make him the father of Nations then he will honor his promise the author is telling us he will honor his promise to you and me if we lay our lives down for him then he will honor his promise but we have to accept him and part of that a big part of that is we always have to be willing to repent we always have to be willing to to lower ourselves so that God might lift us up through his promises he wants you to come here this morning to hear the word of God he wants you to experience the power of the Holy Ghost and he wants you to leave with a strong encouragement not from man but from God that will give you rest in the Holy Spirit the your entire life it will always be there you will stray from it even if you have the Holy Spirit you'll stray from it but there will be repentance in there and you'll come back there is that is God's desire he wants to make his promises known I promised you this and I am God now you receive it and then there is something that anchors our soul in that promise just as I started just me mentioning God to that man there was something about about it that just brought him to tears just The Mention Of God I didn't even say Jesus I didn't even say I he loves you I didn't I didn't quote any of his promises he just knew that there was a god there and God wants to make his promises known to us and there is something that anchors our soul that will that in that promise and in that love that God has that will never change it's a new birth it's a baptism of the Holy Spirit it's God changing your nature from the old Daniel Evans from the old woman from the old man to this new nature and a repen of heart is key if they fall away it's impossible for them to be renewed under repentance if they don't have repentance it's impossible for them to come verse number 19 which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which enter entereth into that within the veil what is the veil you remember the Tabernacle in the wilderness that there was there was a curtain that protected the holy of holies that protected the Ark of the Covenant and The Mercy Seat and then when they built the temple there was that holy of holies that was in there and and Jesus the high priest only the high priest could go in there once a year we've been saying it as we studied this book of Hebrews only the high priest could go in and it was only once a year to make an atonement for the people now this man Jesus he goes into there and you know what happened the curtain was there this big heavy curtain and it ripped from the top to the bottom he went in first and he said come on all of us can come into the presence of God because of his sacrifice because of that high priest that made an atonement in the Bible the high priest had to make an atonement for themselves they had to offer up a an offering a sacrifice for their own sins but then Jesus goes and offers himself a lamb without spot or blemish for that atonement opened up that curtain and said come on into the presence of God where you will find rest you will find that Sabbath whatever needs you have I'll provide it and we can rest in that as long as we are willing to put him first the musicians can come and we'll close verse number 20 whether the Forerunner speaking of Jesus whether the Forerunner is for us entered he went in behind the veil he tasted death hell the grave and conquered it whether the Forerunner is for us even Jesus made a high priest after the order of MDC this man mzc is mentioned all of about two times in the Old Testament and even there it is just a couple sentences just a few sentences about him but the author of Hebrews takes MDC and spends a couple chapters on saying who he is he says things like he is the high priest he says things like he had no beginning of days or ending of life and who is this mysterious man that Abraham when after the slaughter of the Kings Abraham's coming back and here comes this man and Abraham says oh and he pays his tithes to this man MDC wasn't even a levite as we talked about the Levites last week those are the ones that those are the ministry those are the ones that took the ties this man Mount kzdc wasn't a levite so why did Abraham pay ties to this man and who was this man that had no beginning of days or ending of Life yeah remember what I just read that we need to move past the B basic understandings of all of these principles that we've we've talked about the author of the book of Hebrews is about to get very very deep with a deep understanding a deeper understanding of who this man Jesus Christ is and that's for next week God bless you brothers and sisters brother Josiah [Music] in my
