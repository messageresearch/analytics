the way I live my life in in the way that I believe especially for me Jesus said Lord I sanctify myself for their sake and then I also Minister on the side that we need to be careful of legalism and we need to be careful of the the doctrines that are more like the Pharisees and the Sadducees we need to be careful of that Spirit too there we have to be careful of the spirit the lacad isical spirit over here the sinful Spirit the the spirit that that just doesn't care that wants to live their own lives and doesn't doesn't try to live that life perfect before the Lord and then over here we also need to be careful of the the condescending Spirit the spirit that um points a finger at every at other people and I just want to say I appreciate everyone I love everyone and whether Paul said this and I can't I can't find the scripture I didn't know I was going to say this but the Apostle said whatever you do you do it for the Lord he said if you if you honor the Sabbath you do it for the Lord if you if you worship on Saturday you do it for the Lord if you worship on Sunday and not on Saturday you're doing it for the Lord if you eat meat if if if you're eating you're eating for the Lord if you're fasting you're fasting for the Lord whatever we do we should do for the Lord and if we're trying to live we're TR we should all be trying to walk that straight laced walk and we should be doing

Great Is Our God thank you sister God bless you this is definitely for the glory of God so I have this testimony a few weeks ago I had a visit with my new doctor and she was there to read review my options of how I take my dialysis treatments and more specifically to inform and advise me against using a vascular catheter so a quick note on the catheter essentially I have a foreign object in my heart and an open port on my shoulder uh so as I sat listening um as she took several minutes to explain the major risk factors and the statistics regarding the infections the blockages and the blood clots that these catheters are known for um she earnestly told me that it wasn't 100% sure that I would get an infection but 200% the statistics are so high for the rate of infection but that I would certainly get an infection yet as she spoke she suddenly seemed to realize what she was saying to me and she stopped talking because I've never had an infection I've never had a blockage in my heart and I've never had blood clots and I've had catheters for 10 years and as we were talking I had this funny moment where she looked at me and she said Sarah you're the exception and then she stopped and you could just see it Dawning in her as she was realizing who she's talking to and she said this is really a miracle and I said yes it is it absolutely is a miracle and I I sometimes forget you know I go in routine and year after year weekend after week and every time I'm it's not something I'm thinking about but every now and again when I have these kind of uh situations with the doctors it's just brought again to me the way that God is the differen maker he's keeping my life and I just wanted to be faithful again in giving God all the praise and all the glory for his Mercy his word that he's keeping and when he said the footsteps of the righteous shall not be moved we've prayed over all of these catheters over all of these things that I go through and I put my foot down and I say Lord you said I don't have to move on this I don't have to slide on this I don't have to take an infection I don't have to take blockages in my heart or my arteries and he's done that and I just want to remind us all he's faithful whatever you ask in his name believing he can do that for you so praise God I'm so grateful I think we all know this song so if you want to sing it join [Music] In You Are My Strength when I am weak you are the treasure that I sink you are my old know seeking you as a precious Jew Lord to give up I'd be a fool You Are My All In All Jesus Lamb of God Worthy is

to get dark and we ended quiet time I had uh Hano below the below the the shell and it sounds it sounds like um like the chofar I really really enjoyed that but I look out in the field after we blew

Jesus Oh The Blood of Jes Jesus Oh The Blood of Jesus it washes white as snow I'm thankful for the blood of Jesus I'm thankful for the blood of [Music] Jesus yes I'm thankful for the blood of Jes [Music] Jus it washes white as [Music] snow some of the best well the best testimonies I think that we ever could hear is how the candle got lit brother brandom said if you can't figure out what to tell someone when you're witnessing to them tell them how your candle got lit sister marily you have a testimony of how that candle got lit well first of all I just want to let you all know that I love the Lord with all my heart soul and might and I was raised in a Godly home my father was a minister and I went to church all the time and my grandparents they love love the Lord and serve the Lord and my great grandparents so I have quite a Heritage that you know I wanted to hold up to but as you know we sought the Lord to give us the holy spirit that was really important in our life and I would go up I remember being ever so young and we'd be at the altar and just just seeking God and and the Brethren would say you got it you got it and I'd say really and I didn't feel like I had gotten it and I uh so I went a years would go by we'd have services like this all the time and I just seemed like I couldn't break through I tried hard but I couldn't break through and it was like I was just kind of going through the emotions going through I I love the Lord and I I wanted to serve him but I was like not really really um getting through to him as I wanted to and I remember when I was 23 years old I had just said okay this is it I just can't do this anymore it's too hard I can't seem to find my away and I what's wrong with me and I went into my my bedroom and I closed the door and I knelt down by my bed and I just cried out to God and I said Lord I can't do this anymore I can't fight this anymore but Lord if you're the God that I know you are you will do this for me because I can't do this anymore more and the minute the minute I asked him to do it for me I felt that Spirit come down and he just to I just wept and I wept and I wept and I wept my mother thought I was having a nervous breakdown she comes in and she picks me up and holds me and rs me I said mother it's okay it's over I have it now and he's going to take care of me the rest of my life and I will not worry any more because he is there for me and he will guide and direct me so I just thank the Lord I could share [Applause] this talking thank you as sister marily was talking you got to wonder she says I can't do it anymore and there's just something that she's struggling and it's like Lord I can't do it anymore I can't do it anymore I can't do what anymore that's the Holy Spirit pulling drawing us there's a deep calling to a deep and that's what's pulling it's not sin that's pulling on us you think lord I can't do it anymore it's because that's the spirit of God pulling on us it's wanting to fill us the spirit brother brandom said that the Lord wants to fill us with the Holy Spirit more more than we want to have it so that's that pull that that you feel that that it's like Lord I just can't do it anymore I need more I need more I need more and that's that's him drawing you and you think I can't do it anymore that's the spirit and he wants us surrender sister hope you're going to be next uh with your song and your testimony before then I never ever want to embarrass anybody or put anybody on the spot but sister Eunice would you mind thank you God bless you all sister marily I'm going to have to cry in your arms because we're Kindred Spirits I felt like you were telling my story um I also have a lineage of you know family serving the lord and I was just always trying to do the thing trying to do and find asking why why why can't I break through it it's like a glass ceiling I couldn't get through and I would hear different p up up the front saying when you know that you know that you know and you know they would ask several times you know who raise your hand if the Lord came today or tonight would you be ready I can never raise my hand it's not that I didn't want to but I just I couldn't and fast you know I've been baptized and I I also didn't feel like I had the Holy Ghost fast forward to having children and a husband um I would really stress to them you need to have have a relationship with the Lord Jesus and a lot of that stress was turmoil because I felt like I don't have that I want that but I just I'd be at the altar I I do all these things I just there was something that I just couldn't break through and um so some you know in the past you know I don't know maybe a couple months or so the sermons have been really hitting me and and they do you know I always felt like yes I believe amen that's it that's for me but secretly I want wanted somebody from the pulpit to come down and say this is what's wrong with you I I didn't care if they told everybody tell me tell me what it is and I was hoping the Lord would just say Unice you have to do this this and that or this is in your life and he wouldn't um and so little things with the sermons were slowly Breaking Me Down not not in a bad way but they were tugging at my heart and I didn't realize that the Lord was softening my heart to things that I didn't know that I had stones that I didn't know were there so it Camp when brother thadius was you know talking about the stones and the Holy Spirit being pushed out because you have these Stones I thought yes okay these Stones I I want to get rid of them and uh a couple last Tuesday I was um the girls and I were reading our Bible and we were in First Corinthians and um you know it says any man who loves God is known of him and you know we we're reading and reading and I I can't I can't understand but the rest of what's reading because all I can fixate is on that one sentence I later throughout the day you know it just doesn't leave me so I go and I start looking at different um translations and there's a lot of them but they all say the same thing and I thought is it is that it you the Lord has been doing things in my life all of my life so I knew he was there but I just was like I I just need something from you I need to know that you're you you do love me you could tell me me all day long how much the lord loves me but it doesn't hit you until it hits you and it makes sense to you so I I read through these translations and they all said this the same thing you know in different words and I said that's it my little you know junky way of loving the Lord because I know I could never love him enough that's all he wants from me and he'll he'll make me love him more he'll make me do the things that I I know I should or or the things I don't even know about he'll do that for me not me trying really hard to get in and um so I was just really really happy and so I was talking to my daughter and I told her about these translations and then just out of nowhere I said now I know that I know that I know and there was just such a piece about it and I said well this it that was it like you know the Lord didn't have to beat me me over the head I did enough of that but he just showed me yeah Unice I know you so I just want to you know thank the Lord if you're on that journey I just want you to know that when it's your time you know my time was I'm almost 40 years old but the Lord will if you seek him he'll come to you or he'll reveal himself to you he will if he can do it to someone as low as me he can do it for you am amen sister sang that song he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and how good does it feel sister Eunice when he tells me I am his own there is nothing that separate that can separate me from the love of God it says neither height nor depth nor any creature nothing can separate me from the love of God and it feels so good when it anchors down in your heart and you just know it he's always going to be there for me um most of you know part of my test me um when I was when the lord gave me a new birth and all but I left something out I my cousin I was about 13 anyway my cousin had said she said have you read the exposition of the seven Church ages and I said yes we did years ago because my dad had and Mom had bought us all one and we read it along with the brother reading it and um even down to the baby had one it was really neat but um so we all had our own and she she said well she said it is so precious she said I just read it and she was just a couple years older than me and I thought you know what I better read it again so I started reading it and the Lord and you know how brother ROM talked about I don't know if you who how many have read it or not but how he said to pray every day for Revelation he prayed that whoever read that book book that God would reveal what was in it to them and I desperately wanted the Lord to reveal his word to me and so I just cried out to God to do so and in that book he said if you had the least tug to toward God to run toward that with all that you have because you are one of the most blessed persons on the face of this Earth that was one of the things that so spoke to me because I the Lord was talking very much at my heart and I knew that I needed to run toward that with every fiber of my being and so I just want to thank him and every that book it's so full of the word of God it's so beautiful and being a a young teenager like that I didn't understand a lot of it although I had underst I had listened to brother bom all my life and so I said Lord I know the message of the hour is the truth and the Bible is the truth and I said so every little part that I couldn't comprehend I said Lord I'm laying it on the Shelf I know that this is the truth I'm asking you to reveal this to me because I cannot reveal this to myself and you want to know something I read through the book I've got through the book but now when I go back and read it the stimulation of Revelation is the most unbelievably glorious thing on the face of this Earth Revelation from God no one can take time one day he called me to him and I was so thirsty I asked for water my throat was so [Music] dry he gave me water that I had never dreamed [Music] of but for this water my my Lord had to die he said I thirst yet he made the [Music] rivers he said I thirst yet he made the sea said I thirst the king of the [Music] ages his great thirst he brought [Music] water to me now there's a river that flows as clear as [Music] Crystal it flows from God's throne [Music] above and like a river it Wells up inside me bringing Mercy [Music] and sing it with me he said I thirst yet he made the [Music] river he said I thirst yet he made the SE he said I thirst the king of the [Music] ages in his great thirst he brought water to [Music] me in his great thirst he brought water to [Music] [Applause] me let's stand for a moment while we if anybody knows about the love of Jesus who does I do I do oh if anybody knows about the love of Jesus I do oh yes I do oh if anybody knows about the grace of Jesus I do I do oh if anybody knows about the grace of Jesus I do oh yes I do do you know about his power oh if anybody knows about the power of Jesus I do oh yes I do oh if anybody knows about the power of Jesus I do oh yes I do oh if anybody knows about the love of Jesus I I do I do oh if anybody knows about the love of Jesus I do oh yes I do you may be seated as sister hope was was talking in the song that she was singing about how Jesus thirsted and maybe think about that sermon that Jesus preached on the mount we call it the Beatitudes and he said this he made this statement sister Lonnie and brother lion I'm gonna I'm gonna bring the microphone to you in just a minute he made this statement he said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled sister Unice as we're blessed just to have that desire to to get closer with the Lord that desire of righteousness we are blessed just to have that desire I said I've said a few times people seeking they're they're seeking that that Assurance Lord I just want to know I just want to know that that I am yours I just want you to reveal that to me and I've said many times I wish I had a whole congregation I wish everyone in that congregation had that desire that Lord I want that I want to know I want to know you better and I think that even once you receive the Holy Spirit once you receive that Spirit then it starts to even get stronger because you know the Lord a little bit better Lord I want you I want more of you I want more and then there's more desperation and that desperation just grows and grows and grows and when you finally receive receive that Assurance then it starts to get stronger and you start to seek him more and Lord I want you more I want you more the more you pray the more that you want to pray the more you testify the more you want to testify the more you read your Bible the the more you want to read your Bible and that desire just grows from from just it grows from nothing and it just gets stronger and stronger and I think of that blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled what a promise sister Lonnie hello everyone um I just want to thank everybody for helping and and like supporting our pastor because a lot of the stuff that he's done has helped our family sorry I've had a really bad pain in my in my arm and when we went to Camp um before we went to Camp I had a dream my husband has a a special gift some of you guys know um when he speaks to the Lord the Lord gives him guidance and he prays for people and people seem to get healed um so I had a dream before we went and God said well your husband's going to pray for you and you're going to be you're going to be fine and I'm like I'm not going to ask him he's praying for all these other people he's too busy whatever I got to keep going well with being a mother of quite a bit of children and having a big family I got to keep going but the pain kept getting worse and worse to where I couldn't even put my watch on the pain was extremely bad and I would hint to him man if I just get prayed for maybe I'd feel better but he didn't get the hint just kept going about his day so at the camp um we were definitely blessed with brother Thaddius his um sermon and I went up and I was prayed for well at the back of the church I was talking to a couple sisters and he came running at me like a mad man and he laid hands on me and he prayed for me and it's not it's not a healing it's a miracle like I this is the hand I can hold the microphone and and it was definitely a blessing and I just give all glory to God and I just want to thank him for his mercies and guidance and that little small voice that told me he's going to pray for you oh no no and I just kind of shred it off it was the truth and I just thank God for everything thank you yeah I'd like to say greetings to everybody God bless you I'm going to step out here just so you can kind of see me a little better but yeah there was so many things that happened at that camp that was just amazing um you I got a two-part testimony and uh brother Daniel don't know it but he's going to help me with the second part here uh my original testimony that I was going to give is uh it uh the both both parts in involveed the camp but um our daughter capani was with us at the camp and um we named her after um a queen in Hawaii she was Queen cap Alani now this queen she was bound by the traditions of the uh old Hawaiian culture where they had great fear of the volcano and there were certain things they had to do to appease the volcanoes and namely one volcano was named Pelle now the story was that a woman wasn't able to go up to Pella and uh eat anything in front of the volcano anywhere near it without first offering it to the volcano or she'd be consumed so my daughter comes from a line of Portuguese missionaries and she doesn't know it we'll tell her the story but Portuguese missionaries went there and when they told the Queen capani the story of Jesus she heard it and she was so touched in her heart she abandon her old faith and just to prove to her to the uh Elders of her uh of her group she had them walk with her up to the uh mouth of volcano Pelle and she had some oel berries with her and she says look I'm going to eat these berries in front of this volcano goddess Pelle they call her the goddess Pelle nothing's going to happen to me or nothing's going to happen to you because I believe now that the god that created this volcano also created me and I was shown to have a holy respectful fear of the Creator not the creation so she stood there on the power of God in Jesus's name and she ate the berries she proved to her to the tribesmen that nothing happened a lot of them converted to Christianity that day so our daughter we named her capani now when we were at the camp capani started getting a little bit unruly so we had a bring her to the cabin and we had to have our own little quiet time with her all right now just like kids her age she's 11 she's going to be turning 12 uh this week on the 5th you know she start acting a little bit on rly she gets you know they get to that age we took her into the cabin we started mentioning God you know God doesn't want you to act this way you he wants you to uh you know to be good you know we got to say a prayer she starts lashing out and how do I know God's real how do you know God's real you know and I finally had to sit her down on the bed in the cabin I said you you want to know how I know that God is real yeah tell me how you know God's real tell me I said okay sit down right there I said a little long time ago not too long ago a little more than 11 years ago I said there was a baby girl born I said now this baby girl she was born a little bit premature I think about what two months little small baby born premature inside the hospital the doctors nurses everybody was struggling for her to be able to eat on her own she wasn't eating she didn't want to latch onto the bottle or anything so inside the hospital they started doing all kinds of tests on her they got to a point they were putting a bunch of needles in her head and doing a bunch of things and uh they got her to the point where they thought she'd be able to go home and I told her this little baby girl so she went home with her mother and father when she got home she still wasn't eating she was getting weaker and weaker I said the mother and father had to take her back to the hospital and they were struggling in the hospital for onwards to about what maybe a month total right about a month little baby wasn't eating finally inside the hospital the nurse or the doctors came in and said hey we got to get this baby to eat on her own she's not going to make it I told my little girl the father walked into the hospital room one evening the mother said hey this baby girl is not going to make it they said if she doesn't latch onto the bottle and start eating this is not going to be good the mother was holding the little baby girl in her hands in her lap the baby girl you could just tell it's getting weaker and weaker told copy Al I said the father he finally went up to that baby girl and he laid his hands on her that baby girl's father talked to his father he said father could you let this little girl know that you gave her to us and that we love her and that we want her to be here with us in our life could you let her know that it's all right that she comes and that we will take care of her and that we will love her all the days of our life and she's going to come home to a good family and we're going to we're going to tell her about you and we're going to raise her in a good way and we're going to take care of her could you let her know could you let her know that we want her we want her here could you please heal her father in the name of Jesus let her live you gave her to us now let her let us take her home as my daughter sat listening to the story I could tell that her eyes opened up and I had her attention on I told her after the father was done praying for the little baby girl the mother picked her up and put her took her across the room and put her in one of the little baby warmers they have a thing you guys probably know him at the hospital it's a place where you put the you know the little baby girl you know she lays up in the warmer she's not in the loving arms of her mother I told my daughter it was hard for the father to walk away but he just said a prayer to his father he was having faith in it father walks away across the room he sits down next to the mother the mother says what are we going to do father said well I just prayed for her let's have faith then from across the hospital room there is absolutely no way that a baby could speak or say anything audible in the language we know from across the hospital room we heard the word daddy clear Daddy I turned to my wife and I said I'm telling you the story now I didn't tell copy this now I'm telling you I turned to my wife and I said did you just hear what I heard she said yes and without me telling her what I heard I saidwell what did you hear she said that little baby girl said Daddy I said yeah that's exactly what I heard I said go get her out of the bassinet thing and bring her over to you and let's see the healing of God she grabbed the little baby brought her over to her that little baby latched on like we' never seen her latch from the time she was born till now she started drinking she ain't stopping eating since and she's going to be 12 years old this week on October the 5th so the doctors came in said what happened she's suddenly eaten like normal my wife said my husband prayed for her so now we're in the cabinet Camp I told my baby girl I said listen I said that baby girl's father asked his father to let her live so you want want to know how I know God is real I said that little baby girl was [Applause] you so it was a blessing for us to be somewhere at Camp she had never heard that story this is the first time I've told it anywhere it was a blessing for her to be at the camp and for her to for her to hear that and now for the second part of my testimony we were at camp and I learned a lot of things um first of all it was the first Christian Camp I've ever been to in my life so it was great I think even the brother uh Daniel Jr came up to me one evening and I was just sitting by the fire by myself and he said you know brother Lionel you seem to be enjoying this Camp more than anybody I said when I was a little boy I never came to No Such Camp as this I said this is great I said yes I am enjoying it but anyway we learned about quiet time and uh that's what the brother Daniel explained we kind of went off for an hour he said hey during Camp the greatest thing we can all do is we could have quiet time that's when we're going to set aside an hour everybody pick a place goes be quiet you could pray you could read the Bible you could just meditate do some things maybe listen to something and that's what's called quiet time he says I've known in the past when I've been involved in camps like this uh quiet time is one of the best things I was able to take home with me so we started uh doing quiet time time and then uh quiet time evolved to where the Conch Shell was blown so that it could signify the beginning of quiet time so with a conch shell it's another Hawaiian uh like he said it's like the brother Daniel said it's like the chofar and they blew it in the islands of Hawaii to alert make an alert of something going on so the con shell was blown during quiet time um uh brother Daniel pointed out to me Three Wooden Crosses that was across the grass and he said wow it' be great if was sit right in the middle of them Three Wooden Crosses during quiet time and I looked across and I said yeah that'd be nice and then I noticed a couple of days go by nobody ever sat in between those Three Wooden Crosses so on the third day I said you know what I'm going to go sit there so I went and sat in between them Three Wooden Crosses and I thought I'm going to uh I don't have no shade here I'm going to be here for an hour I need some shade so there was a beam of the shadow of the middle cross that came across so I lined my chair right up with that shadow just so at least the sun wouldn't be in my eyes and then I started thinking about a sun dial you know those that been Boy Scouts have been out there's a sunnd dial you could put a stick in the ground and it castes a shadow and you put a rock to mark it and you can Mark time so I thought you know when the conqu shell blows I'm going to put a rock right here on the Shadow and I'm going to measure the time of an hour and see what happens so I did that the con shell blew I put the rock there I measured time so I sat there thinking about time and meditating about time and then I'm looking at the Three Wooden Crosses and then I'm thinking about quiet time I'm thinking about the camp I'm thinking about brother Daniel the three crosses I'm thinking about about a lot of things and so today let me first tell you that sister marily she's the church Bulldog she was the one in the back that says you better get up and at least tell that part and you got to tell this I said okay okay I'm going she would if I didn't come up here I'm convinced she would have drugged me up here to tell this part but in the heard events I prepared for this part and this is where the brother Daniel is going to help me out here and I find it to be the way God works is just absolutely amazing because before I came up here brother Daniel mentioned the camp he mentioned quiet time and he mentioned Noah and the Ark and the two boys sitting there reading the Bible now all of which all of which brother Daniel is going to find in a bag of a gift that I made for him and this is my appreciation like my wife said for all that you do for here at the church and for us now I've given God my heart I'm going to give brother Daniel a piece of my heart and I know the way brother Daniel is he's going to want to share it with the church So eventually I'm going to make this available to the rest of the church and I'm going to pass the microphone over to him he'll show you what I got him and he's going to read it for us wow it's a picture of a fire by lyl Salazar says this what group will gather when the con shell doth blow neath the vast expanse of Sky even us will we go our feet tread the ground where once we were found found a long time ago fashion in your IM fashioned in your image and the likeness to know your spirit is in US you wanted to show a Creator to save those who were lost with no way out death was the cost even for us you died on the cross amen the good path we follow in the Eternal length they shall wait upon the Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength like Noah of old who pleaded and told a message of warning so mighty and bold from heaven above came the piece of a dove for all to feed your eternal love love you called them to Safety in an ark by the ramp now we wait on a whisper your voice is our lamp it's quiet time at the Tucson Tabernacle [Applause] camp wow there's three crosses here I remember I looked over at brother Lionel and I I saw him sitting sitting under those three crosses and it it blessed me brother liono beyond measure in time hung a man unto death he was lost a criminal for sure life's end was the cross mockery and blasphemy echoed about when the Man's eyes were open he found his way out the king hung beside him the world's sin he did Bear they whipped him and cursed him death was the snare the man proclaimed truly his life was unruly for him Jesus hung and was treated so cruy the Angels did sing when he gave to the king a true repentant heart his life's Saving start the only way out Heaven's Victory shout still creation wept at the third hour of the day the Creator the king with a broken voice he did say for you it is paid for you is the price verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise according to Luke chapter 23 in time hung a man unto death he was lost victory was found beside him on the cross amen oh oh what a wonderful testimony I told my wife that the um my favorite thing at the camp was maybe I'll share if we have time I'll share a testimony of a couple boys um I saw people healed I saw people come to the altar that should have came to the altar I saw people weeping there and crying and giving their hearts to the Lord and how how blessed the camp was how blessed you all were there is just a good time is a good time in the Lord and to see all of these people just consecrating their lives but my highlight of the camp and this may sound strange but my highlight of the camp was when we ended quiet time and I looked there and I saw the LEL up at the foot of the cross there was three crosses there and I looked around and I saw all the people just quiet and and and getting and getting just having a time of communion with the Lord and and I was just I was just thanking the lord I was so happy and I got up to go find Hano brother the lono's son and I wanted him to blow the conell and I went and got him and he uh took his earbuds out of his ear and uh I said uh asked him I said I said how you doing and and I could tell the boy was touched and this was the highlight for me I could tell the boy was touched I could F that I could feel that that the spirit was on the boy and he he was feeling good and his first words were took it out and he says I just love brother brandom's preaching like praise the Lord you know I want people to know I want them to know that God sent a prophet I want them to know that this Prophet was a sign of the second coming of Christ I want them to know that he had a message to turn our hearts back to that and to see this young man without me saying anything and I doubt with the parents saying anything to see this young man listening to this Prophet just him on his own doing it it was to me the whole camp was worth just that just just having that little bit to to see that that it's working that that that that we're go we're we're moving on we're we're we're we're going past those things that were behind and we're we're coming forward and I pray that we can do what this Prophet taught us to do that and that is the desire of of my heart so thank you for the liono for those beautiful beautiful words um brother Rome I think he stepped out as he back we'll uh we'll get to brother brother Rome it feels since we're talking about Camp it feels good let's keep talking about it I won't say anything but it's your birthday tomorrow right it it is okay would you give a testimony for it sister um so I'm just gonna talk about how cam changed my life I wrote it down so that I would have the right words to say my life wasn't perfect it was broken so much happening in this world and it's scary Not only was I running from those things but I found myself running from me I was seen as a monster but I made that image because I was really holding on to myself broken and alone and it was hard I needed help where I would die mentally and eventually physically God when no one comes for you he's who you should go running to right but this time I didn't want to go running to him I felt like he was tired of it as someone in a relationship whose partner keeps cheating on them would be so I didn't bother then my mom told me about a camp and how it would change how it would be fun and I was happy to be getting out of the house but at the same time I didn't really want to go I had nothing to do that weekend and being home alone wasn't safe for me mentally the camp the way everyone and everything was felt peaceful like those things I was running from were never there being in that environment had me pick up my Bible again I always knew his word but never felt it reading it this time was different what he showed me at Camp was what I always wanted to feel Joy seeing everyone's kindness love and laughter felt like I really did have a chance it felt like this time God came looking for me I repented and decided I want to change my life and stick to it this time Sunday of that weekend I asked God to tell me to that I was truly his I told him to tell me to give me a straight answer because I overthink everything then as brother thaddus preached sometime within he said you're God's daughter pointing to the crowd pointing to me I then knew I truly belonged Chang Camp changed my life but it also saved my life anybody else amen I saw the Lord working on these girls and I uh sister Lucia came up and I was sitting there talking with um the uh the cook and she came up and she sat down and you can feel it when God's working on somebody you can just feel like Lord you're dealing with this young lady I could feel it as I mean it was as real as me standing up here and then as time went on sister he just what he did is he just made himself real to you but you had to make a decision and you made it God bless you for doing that Amen brother Rome are you ready to [Applause] sing the next will be uh Caitlyn McKenzie and sister Martha after this I stepped outside tried to figure out what they going to do with us after they freeze us to death brother brandom said the natural types the spiritual and it's a cold in here you ready when your soul is tired and hungry when your back is bent down low when you're wondering in the desert and you don't know where to go God will bring the blessings to you in the midst of your distress he will spread a table for you in your wilderness you will never be forsaken you will never beg for bread God takes care of his dear children he'll sure your soul is fed though for now the way is weary let your spirit be at rest to know that God will spread a table in your Wilderness if the Lonely Road you travel seems to have if you stumble through the darkness so long you can't recall the night just depend upon his Mercy trust your father's faithfulness for everything you need in your Wilderness though for now the way is weary let your spirit be at rest to know that God will spread a table in your Wilderness though for now the way is weary let your spirit be at rest to know that God will spread a table in your wilderness now my three-hour testimony hey I you sign up for that yes I did I told you I'm just kidding I got testimony to oh okay well he said to tell how you got the candle it and I can do that I was taking two of my neighbors to the Tabernacle church on Sunday I got kind of talked into it by my neighbor Victor paye who was brother Milano's brother-in-law and on the way there a couple times after I've taken them I threw out a cigarette I had a habit of smoking most of my life in the early days and uh this one sister put her hand on my shoulder and prayed for me I threw the cigarette out and I ain't wanted another one since amen so I've seen God working in that cuz I had tried several times to quit and couldn't then my wife got baptized and then we had a little argument my friend gave me an old tape recorder and it didn't work very good so I worked on it for about an hour and couldn't get it to play so I set it up on the end table and we started arguing about I told her that all the prophets were until John there was no profit for these days but we argued about two or three things all of a sudden that tape recorder came on and brother Bram answered all the questions we were arguing about so that was another Supernatural thing then I heard a tape and I'll never forget it it was my uh the one that called me then Jesus came and called and went to church the next time and brother green was preached and he was telling a story he had a dreamed the night before that he baptized two women and one man I never asked him to be baptized uh the other two women did but he was telling the story while he was in the bapst water and he didn't know I was getting dressed up in to get baptized so uh when I walked out he was in shop but uh he said he'd been praying for me so I got baptized but before I got there I tried to hang on to the Pew as long as I could and I just couldn't hang on any longer I was drawing to the water and then uh we had a two kids at that time Connie and Rome Jr Rome Jr fell off of my mother-in-law's snack bar and had a concussion he walked with his head tilted he couldn't ride his bike he had no balance and we took him to the doctor and they said he had a concussion and was tax raid and everything they was going to do surgery on him so the night before these this the mother of brother Milano called on the phone and her and I and and my wife Lois prayed for Rome Jr he got up the next morning perfectly well amen so we continue on believe in the message because we believed it was true had a lot of meetings in her home and then brother ato's home I never received the Holy Spirit for two years after I accepted the Lord but uh then when I did I had all the faith in the world so I quit my job and traveled with a minister for a month and we had a lot of meetings in Indiana Michigan Ohio Kansas Louisiana and I met brother Prim pu Tim puit when he was 16 years old he's a young boy preaching down in Louisiana we spent about a week down there and went to his church a couple times and I uh questioned all of them about Malachi 45 because I still didn't quite understand but later on I heard a tape where brother Bram said it had a two-fold meeting meaning so I kind of accepted what he said so we've been following the message now no we came in the other day I think it was 55 years ago and uh we've never went back on what people believe the other two hours and 55 minutes I'll have to wait good job good job bless you appreciate brother Rome Johnson I remember I remember dad I remember listening to brother Rome and dad and some other brothers Brother Joseph AES I was a little I was a young young man I remember listening to them talk talk about the Lord and talk about brother Brown's message and the excitement that they had and the love that they had for the word of God made an impression on me sister Teresa um satell she wrote this she wasn't able to come tonight but she want she had a testimony that she wanted to give she says this she I want to share a testimony that happened to me early this morning at 5:30 a.m. she said my dog Milo had not eaten or drank water or moved much from the same spot for days and I thought I was seeing his last day however last night I laid my hands on him and felt an anointing as I prayed for him when I got up this morning he followed me to the kitchen which surprised me he also ate two pieces of a sight of sliced cheese I then let him outside where he again played with my other two dogs and it was a miracle to watch praise the Lord thank you to sister Teresa if if God cares about a possum laying on the porch then he cares about our dogs too am I right right amen God bless you and at sorry after this I I think that uh we're going to get close to wrapping it up so sister Jessica in the group will probably be [Music] next Go Tell It on the Mountain over the hill and everywhere Go Tell It on the Mountain that Jesus Christ was [Music] born sheers kept there watching or silent flocks By Night behold throughout the heavens there Shone a holy L Go Tell It on the Mountain over the hills and everywhere Go Tell It on the Mountain that Jesus Christ was born shephered and TR the of the earth ring out the angels that hel Our Savior birth Go

Christmas morning Go Tell It on the Mountain over the hills and everywhere Go Tell It on the Mountain that Jesus Christ was born Go Tell It on the Mountain over the hills and everywhere Go Tell It on the M Jesus Christ was [Music] born amen beautiful praise the Lord have I missed besides sister Jessica and uh the group that was practicing have I missed anyone that had a testimony or a song No I know that we all have testimonies and I know that we could we could be here for a long long time but that's what heaven's going to be for we're going to be giving our testimonies and I don't know if there's an etal ET so I think it might take a 100 million years for us all to give our testimonies and after 100 million years we'll have forgot them anyway so we'll have to tell them again and then again and then again and then again it feels good so if you all could make your way forward I'll give I'll give one testimony brother Rome was talking about smoking cigarettes and uh there was a lady that called she when I was in the ministry in Jeffersonville and she had uh she had lost her son was strung out on drugs her husband had left her and she was getting kicked out of her house and she was standing on a street corner and she didn't know what to do and she was just crying her eyes out and someone walked up to her and gave her a little card and uh I forgot what it said on the front of it but on the back it said it had our phone number on there and she didn't even read what the card said she turned it over she dialed the number and then the secretary gave the the um call to me and she was just distraught and crying and we we prayed together and uh she and I said well how long you you have in your house we we'll pray and she says well I've got a a few weeks left but they're going to kick me out so we we had prayer and I said can I send you some information can I send you some material that I think will encourage you and I sent her a couple sermons and she called back a couple weeks later she says she says um she says Mr Evans she says I just want you to know that that my job is okay now I can stay in my house and I said I said well good and she said uh you sent me those those CDs she said you got any more and I said yeah so I I sent her some more sent her a church age book someone mentioned the church age book I sent her a church age book she started listening to them she she just she was she was just so blessed and and she came down she goes I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus she was from way up in Northern Indiana she says I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so she comes down to the to the brandom Tabernacle the uh she she comes to church she gets baptized in the name of the Lord and she just continues on believing and the Lord just continues to provide for everything that she had need of and and she had need of a lot so after a year or two I think it was two years went by no it was one year it was one year exactly she called me up and she said brother Daniel she said I want to give you a testimony she said I have smoked and this lady is exactly my age literally she was born on July 18th 1971 she is exactly my age and she said that she had smoked since since she was 14 years old and she said she's tried she says I've even tried hyp hypnotizing she says ' I've tried the patch she said I've tried the gum she says I've tried cold turkey she says I've been trying to quit since I believe since she was 20 years old so it was 40 something years not 40 years [Laughter] sorry it's like five years no so she she had been it had been 20 something years she's been trying to quit smoking and she said do you remember the two CDs that you sent me and I said no I said but it was probably two sermons one of them was be certain of God and the second one was life story she said right she said life story she said I listen listen to that sermon she said and as William Bram was preaching and giving his testimony she said that he was out on a date with a girl and he said he just loved her and and and he called her I think she said he called her his little Dove and and then she was the she was he just thought the world of this girl and he said that the girl girl lit up a cigarette and she said I could tell how much that disgusted brother brandom and she said from that moment on she said even the smell of cigarettes disgusts me and she said I didn't want to tell you until the one year anniversary is passed but now I want to tell you that the Lord delivered me from smoking and I have haven't had another desire ever and I I talked to her just before I left Jeffersonville I said did that ever come back she says never so the Lord delivers God bless you [Applause] sisters I just want to share a couple of hopefully short testimonies um I grew up in this church in these pews that you're sitting in and I came to the Lord I had experience when I was 13 I was baptized at the age of 13 but and while I remember that experience very well it's been over the years uh time and time again um where God has been so faithful to me um just so many so many things that he's just been so good but one of the more recent times was um as most of you know my sister passed away a couple of years ago and it was very sudden but the Lord was so gentle still with me just holding me and loving me through the hardest time I've ever had in my life and I will remember that till he comes for me just how precious I felt being held by him in such a difficult time um and then another recent testimony This was um just a few months ago um well probably at the start of the year but I had been dealing with pretty severe pain in my left hip um for more than a year it was um debilitating I found myself suffering a lot not being able to do just regular daily activities and i' been to the doctors I'd been to the chiropractor I was on had taken medications I tried everything and uh one service out in Pennsylvania we had a brother come and preach for us and I went up for prayer and it was and it was definitely the Lord I just had this decisiveness in my mind that I knew I was going up to get prayed for and I was going to be delivered from this and I went up there I was prayed for and I was delivered from that pain so God is [Applause] [Music] good [Music] they say this mountain Can't Be Moved they say

Amen brother Ron if you would if you would come to close as brother Ron's [Music] coming think about these testimonies that we've heard tonight in these songs of praise made me think of this the Apostle Paul I talked about a simulator in a fighter pilot the Apostle Paul was a true fighter pilot he knew how it was to take off and to fly in the skies the Apostle Paul says this nay in all things nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen I promise and we can testify sing and I just friends I love it thank you so much for everyone that took courage to take the microphone and sing praises to our Lord and give testimonies of his goodness let's bow our heads brother Ron if You' come neither Heights nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is incred Christ Jesus our [Music] lord like brother Dan said we all have a testimony I I kind of reluctant because mine runs long it starts with the day I was born I know you don't have 69 years to listen to this amen but so many times this is for those that that fail and Satan pushes you down and tries to keep you down say well I'm not worthy Paul said if we suffer we shall also reign with him amen if we deny him he also will deny us but that's not enough that's not the end of it if we believe not yet he abideth faithful amen thank God he cannot deny himself am the Revelation is once you realize who you are you don't let your failures keep you down because he's called you and he'll make a way for you amen and it's it's it's a hard life it's not easy if it was easy anybody could do it I so enjoyed these testimonies and each and every one and the camp wow I wasn't there but I did go to another camp and up in Mount Lemon and I must say that the last night the Lord many had left and there were some of us left and the Lord came down and I have to say for the little group that was in a I don't know what room it was it was next to the place where we ate but we all gathered in there there maybe been 15 or 20 of us and things started happening you know how the Bible talks that wave after wave glory after Glory glory and I experienced the love of God it's undescribable yes amen and I've had moments since where I felt it but it's real amen and I was sitting there thinking a thought that be nice to me because you know I just realized my dad dad my father is the king amen be nice to me and I'll say nice things to him about you amen that's not all of it he said you got family I think the same way about them as I think about you when I Sister Sarah if I could if I could my heart breaks when I hear you s suffer I suffer if I could sister I would make you well we you don't know why we do what we do we don't know why God he carries us through but I love your attitude sister amen thank you for that thank you we don't need to feel sorry for ourselves or pity ourselves our father is the king yes amen one day one day we'll get these new bodies we won't fail ourselves anymore of each other just for a moment this would be a check is there anybody in this room that you would not want to see on the other side if you can't say I want to see everybody then you need to be at this altar there's no one person here that I don't and those were here this morning those that I've known I think that's how Jesus felt he died for the whole world not everybody accepted him but I believe I'm in the midst of a group that has and I I thank you for your testimonies amen can we pray oh god look down upon our hearts Lord Jesus yes see our trembling Hearts oh God we love you but we don't love you enough forgive us for lord your love is it is unexplainable but Lord you loved us so much you provided the circumstance to show us by your death on Calvary and how Satan is pulled and tugged and try to pull us down but Lord Lord you miraculously you come and remind us of who we are and we're so glad that we're so happy tonight Lord Jesus that we know who we are but Lord we know that our minds they sometimes slip and we forget so remind us oh Lord each time we know you're faithful even when we've ceased to believe and and when Lord we we fail you're all always faithful amen you have made your choice and oh God we're so glad and we are humbled we thank you Lord for this time together go with each and every one may they not forget these moments may this love and this tenderness and May It Go with each and every one Amen in the precious name of the Lord Jesus we just give thanks father
