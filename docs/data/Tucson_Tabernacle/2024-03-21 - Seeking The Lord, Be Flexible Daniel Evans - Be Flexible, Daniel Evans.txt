message and then afterwards we were singing a song the life behind the name and towards towards the end brother Jonathan here comes up and he hands me a note and on that note he says that Papa Lawrence was singing that song today and um what's so special is brother Larry brother Aaron had had a dream about brother Larry a couple weeks ago and he dreamed that that his dad who hasn't been able to sing in a long time because of his condition he dreamed that his dad was going to sing a song special and then on Wednesday brother Jonathan gives me that note and he said that brother Larry had been singing that same song that same day a man that couldn't sing just a little while ago was was singing that song and and further he had asked brother Jonathan if I'm right maybe you could have the church sing that song tonight and brother Jonathan forgot to ask us and the Lord laid it on our brother Matthew's heart to sing that song what a testament we know that the Lord Is With Us amen [Music] he believes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] adding all things [Music] because [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord a little testimony the Lord tells us he says I'm with you I'm going to give you these little blessings just to show you I'll give you the big blessings and I'll give you the little blessings just to show that I'm there and I'm hearing your prayers and I'm I'm with you and I love you this whole thing's a love story and it's a love story between us and our bridegroom the man Christ Jesus I got another special testimony today um I met a met a brother on Wednesday night brother Lionel Salazar and had the honor of speaking to him after service and he had a he had a special experience that had happened to him and he gave me the experience and it got me so excited by the Lionel if you come up it got me so excited that I asked him I said hey brother would you mind so I don't butcher it and mess it up would you mind just sharing it for the congregation and our brother said yes so we have a special blessing this morning brother Lyle brother Lionel like you to give that God bless you my brother it's good to see you greetings to you all on this fine Sunday morning I'd like to say thank you to the uh Pastor Evans for inviting me to come up here today I feel it's an honor to be able to come up here in the Church of the Living God and to address his children and I hope that I could say something today that will bless you um it was somewhat of a struggle for us to get here this morning Woke up had to go out to the chicken coop in a kind of nurse a rooster that was that was somebody you got kind of hurt somehow we did that we had a few other struggles but we were able to make it so I feel blessed for being here um like the brother Evan said um there were some events that happened started with my daughter and her friend they used to come to school here and uh she was in the neighborhood it's been a long long while since she was on this side of town but for some reason her and her friend they both came to school here when they were little you know they were they felt led to stop by the church and they came into the parking lot and they looked around they didn't see anybody here but they seemed there was a couple cars so they got out in the uh started saying hello hello is anybody here and they were walking around and they were trying to reminisce with looking at their old school and I believe the brother Evans or his somebody came out and started speaking with him and they told them yeah we used to go to school here so we stopped by we wanted to uh you know check out the old school grounds so they said sure come on in and uh they came in but then my daughter and her friend ended up giving them a tour of the police but anyway they had a they had a really fine time here and a really good experience and my daughter came home and she was all lit up and she said hey Dad you know I hadn't went by the old school for a long time and man we went over there and met this new guy there he's the pastor of the church and and he invited us to come back and we seen some of the old the old classroom some of the old stuff and uh she actually brought a paper with her she had a few papers she they let her go into the room where they had some of the stuff stored and she found some of her old school papers and stuff for her and her brother you know she said Hey Dad it's there's so there was a place in Tucson when something with my name on it somewhere it was there at the church they still had it my name on it my schoolwork I said yeah that's pretty good and she says uh hey Dad you know they invited me to come to the church and uh you know I think maybe we ought to go out there man and visit the place and you know maybe start going there I said well that sounds good baby yeah that sounds good you know maybe maybe we should and um anyway she uh she invited me a couple times she came out and uh I think the following uh church service was maybe a Sunday I think Sunday or Wednesday it was a Wednesday night so she came and then she went back home and she showed me the uh the video of the church here and it was him speaking a little bit about his experience of when they showed up so I watched it and I said hey you know this guy he seems to have a real fire in a drive in his heart to try to build this church here and I said look at this you know he was he was just had you could tell by the way he was speaking hey I don't want this just to be a regular church I want to build it and he had a deep desire in his heart it seemed crying and calling out to God hey what direction do you want me to go in what's our Direction who in this city is going to listen to it to anything that we had to say more than that are we going to be inviting amen the people of this city to come in here not just any people all the people whoever God might send us to to speak to or to to talk to wherever he will send us amen you know wherever the wind blows so I heard them and I said wow this sounds uh he sounds like a pretty good guy man and I I like his Direction and uh my daughter invited me then I think there was gonna be a picnic or something out here hey Dad they're having a picnic yeah why don't you come yeah baby we'll come you know you know us guys sometimes are like okay we're gonna go don't worry we'll go get out there one day sure enough then uh after the picnic I didn't show up I think it was a couple times she invited me and I had it in my heart to come especially after I'd seen you know the video of him and stuff and I seen the direction of how he wants the church to go but I just things just weren't in place for me to come then Tuesday night rolls around and I ended up having a dream and in my dream I was speaking to a family member that I hadn't seen in a long long time and uh we had a really good visit it was in the morning time and then he left my house and later on that night something happened something happened it was something bad happened he got killed or something really bad but it was one of them dreams that were so realistic that you were just so happy when you woke up that it was a dream wow that was just a dream and then when I woke up I was thinking about the dream and I and I kept thinking he was wearing a shirt that said Sunnyvale Sunnyvale stand a little closer yeah he was wearing a a shirt I'm sorry are you a little closer so he's wearing a shirt in my dream and it said Sunnyvale Sunnyvale twice on the shirt so I woke up and I thought well if something did happen to his family member I would have gotten a call to text or something already and you know I didn't get no text someone but then I started thinking what is Sunnyvale where what is Sunnyvale where is Sunny what does that have to do with this dream so I pulled my phone out and uh here's an interesting thing you know we got all our modern day gadgets electronics and everything else but one thing that we need to realize is all of the components that go into this all of the materials and all the things that comes from this Earth and this is God's Earth so all of the components and parts and metals in whatever may be into these guys such as these iPhones and things computers whatever those are all elements that come from the earth that's God's Earth so it's it's a strange thing to think about hey could God be in control and and could use these Electronics in a strange way to get a hold of somebody I say yes he could you know those those are his to begin with um so anyway in the dream Sunnyvale Sunnyvale I get up I grab my front my phone and I said you know what I'm just gonna hit a random search just a random search Sunnyvale see where is Sunnyvale what is it hit a random search it comes up Sunnyvale California Wine Festival first caught my my uh attention wow Sunnyvale is a town in California and uh you know I've seen that they were having a wine fest it was just an advertisement from the Chamber of Commerce or whatever and uh I realized Sunnyvale was near a place where I'm from I'm from originally from the East Bay near Oakland California and I said wow Sunnyvale of all places in the United States it's kind of near it's in the Bay Area you know a town that I didn't never knew that it's a town near near where uh you know where I was born where I used to live okay yeah those are the slides okay right here yeah so Sunnyvale right there okay keep that on Sunnyvale that was the first thing that I hit on the phone and uh yeah I said okay well Sunnyvale is a place in California but it's strange that it's where I was originally from so then I said okay well if Sunnyvale is in California what does that have to do with Tucson Arizona so then on the next slide I just hit a search I just put Sunnyvale space Tucson and then uh this pulls up and it was a map and I said wow this is strange because I didn't go to MapQuest or nothing I just went to a regular search Sunnyvale Tucson so a map pulls up with a with a marked out highlighted route and I look and I said wow okay this is from Sunnyvale and I look at I said okay it's coming it's mapping me to Tucson Arizona so I say uh wow this is a you know why is it coming to Tucson Arizona and uh first of all let me just stop here for a second this just came to my mind right here um I wasn't gonna tell this testimony but uh uh I was speaking to brother Arnie Peterson and it was a Wednesday night and um after church and he mentioned the Bay Area we were talking about horses and stuff so then I said okay well I think I might need to say this to some somebody so I'm here today you know based on whatever and I'll get back I'll get back to that part in a second but anyway here I mapped it out okay Sunnyvale California Tucson Arizona and then I zoom in if you go to the next slide okay there's the uh there's the route right there so I zoom in I see it's from California I want to know where it ended now so if you go to the next one okay go to the one before that one oh yeah okay now go back just go back one I'm sorry about that okay right here that route ended or Castro and Jacinto Street from Sunnyvale California to Castro and Jacinto that's the intersection just west of this church here so I said wow you know my daughter had invited me here the events that led up that led up to her uh coming here was already I think something of God and then he Maps me out on my phone to this very spot this was Wednesday morning at about nine o'clock in the morning when I found that so then if you go to the next slide now okay there's the church that's just east of uh Jacinto and Castro Street okay so now Castro Street and the brother Peter said I said well I'm gonna come to church Wednesday night now because my daughter invited me but now God is telling me to come here now so I'm coming Wednesday night and if you speak to my family they thought it was the strangest thing you know because a lot of times they'll invite me you know to go play some Churches or or whatever it may be and uh but then on Wednesday night I came by myself and I had to do a little explaining to him you and I just said hey you know what I'm going out you know I was procrastinating throughout the day I said hey I'm gonna go to church that's it I got in the car and I came I actually came by myself but when I came in and I was speaking to uh brother Peterson uh first I came in and said okay this happened I'm just gonna go to church I ain't gonna make no big deal about it or nothing but uh you know if I'm just gonna see what happens why was I directed to come here after church I'm speaking to Mr Peterson about horses and uh you know Mr Peterson's I don't know how much you know of him he's a horse man he's a farrier in things and um while we were talking he brings up the Bay Area because he also is from the Bay Area originally and we started talking about horses and he says well when I was up in the Bay Area and you know I used to work with horses there was a lady that had 35 horses and she lived down in Castro Valley and I said wait a minute did you just say Castro and he says well yeah Castro Valley I said okay stop right there here I got something to tell you and that's when I pulled out my phone I said okay it's meant for me to tell this story pulled out my phone he told him the story and then after that he uh he uh asked me you know he was uh he was pretty blessed by the story and he says hey uh would you like a case of tomatoes but before you leave and I said well yeah you're giving out Tomatoes I'll take me some you know I was getting ready to go out the front door of the church and I had he he came up and introduced himself to me when I was sitting in the back but that was it but I'm getting ready to walk out the front door of the church so brother Peterson takes me in the back to give me a case of tomatoes and uh I ended up with uh 75 percent of them because I think uh brother Peterson must have ate the top half or something but they're very good with salt they just plain tomatoes with salt but yeah but anyway I'm just kidding he's a fine man brother Peterson but anyway because he took me to the back I was then I ran right into the pastor uh Evans here and then he started telling me his account of my daughter coming to the church and I said well that's funny that you mentioned all this because I got a story as to how I got here today too and then I started telling him my story and um that's when he said hey can you can you uh come on Sunday morning and tell this story I said well do you think it'll bless anybody you think anybody would like to hear this that God directed somebody to this church somebody he directed on me well yes they will and I said okay I'm coming so that's how I ended up here but uh if you look at the way that God works um go back to the children of Israel when they come up out of Egypt he didn't just send them off into the desert and say hey go find your way he mapped them out a way to get over to the Mount Sinai to get the law and ultimately into the Promised Land and let me tell you a little bit about the way that he chose it was a pillar of it was a cloud to Lead the Way by day in a pillar of fire to Lead the Way by night okay now that was the same Pillar of Fire that was on the bush that got Moses's attention to begin with and that was the same Pillar of Fire that landed on their heads on the day of Pentecost so they could also guide them and lead them so they could spread the gospel throughout the world and it's the same Pillar of Fire that's here today in this church in this city inside the hearts of his children you you are the children of the Church of the Living God and you got that same fire in you it was a promise that he gave you to you and to your children and your children's children and as many as far off will come it's a promise to you now you got that fire in you there's people in this city that needs that fire yes amen and God is going to blow the wind to spread that fire throughout this city and it's going to start it could start and it will start right here inside this church right here with a man with Direction so go and tell your family if you have it in your heart tell your family tell your friends this is a new day this is a new day that Holy Spirit that the Bible speaks about is not dead it is alive and it is working and if you don't believe me here's a little bit of proof that Holy Spirit went and got somebody it mapped him out of the way on Wednesday and he showed up to this place and it wants to bring more people to this place and I'm just proud to be a part of this I'm proud to know you all thank you brother I'm going to leave you with that I'm gonna let him get back to to his message here today but I just see it as a blessing that I was able to speak with you all and uh I'd like to just say God bless you in in uh I ask that he keep you safe for the rest of the day [Applause] amen he said do you think that they'd be blessed by me giving that testimony are you blessed can you can you believe it didn't map him to his house where he was sitting with his phone but it mapped him all the way from his hometown way way up there all the way to this place right here that's to me that was just what a tremendous Miracle do you remember I told you when the young lady is there when they stopped by the church I said that night I said God's doing something special and I said I just felt this I forgot it was Sunday morning or Wednesday I said I felt this heavy feeling all day that God was doing something and I was talking about about reaching out and I went to the subway and I was reaching out to those people and and it was just like Lord you're doing something I don't know what it is and brother you said it better than I did he's using this place to reach out to other people to bring them in to get them to Christ one day there'll be a last call and we want to be up and doing we want to be in the Lord's work so so he can use us to be that call for the people uh so it's just so so blessed and and hearing our brother and he put up the uh the Chamber of Commerce there and instead of wine fest you know and I was you you can't you can't make this stuff up my message this morning it part of it is about putting new wine in Old bottles and it's just it's it's just tremendous to see just to see brother Jonathan and you giving giving that note on Wednesday night and and the little things and these little things I believe it was in uh Ezekiel somewhere in the prophets it talks about this water starting to rise and it starts to come up and and he says it's it's a it's a place that you could Wade through and then the water the water continues to rise and then it's it's a place that you can barely get through and then and then the water comes up so high it's a place that you can never go through and that's how the gospel it's a Revival starts it just builds and builds and builds and builds moves forward and that's I believe and I pray that is the direction we are going as a church I don't think there's anybody more blessed amen oh I don't think there's anybody more blessed to hear that testimony brother Lionel than I am oh tremendous and nice to see is that your wife there sis God bless you welcome it's good to have you and I know your daughter this is good to see you too he's doing God's doing something and my my message this morning is about seeking God and be flexible I was yesterday I was really doing the best that I could in seeking him the the best that that I know how to get the Lord's attention is is to get away and and hike up in the mountains where there's nobody there and and maybe sit in the shade and and um and just pray and ask the Lord if he has anything for me brother Gabriel God bless you my brother it's good to see you another man searching for the Lord wanting wanting to get closer to God wanting to hear that voice brother Gabriel raise your hand God bless you my brothers good to see you it's good to see you here but so I was up there and and I was I get to this this little saddle and there's a place and I sit under sit next to this lean up against this rock and the shade of the tree and I was praying and I opened my eyes and and I looked across the Little Valley there and over on the hill I saw I saw a deer and I was watching this deer and then I see that that it was a doe and she had she had two fawns with her and I'm watching watching these three deer and just just enjoying it and and praying and and and seeking the Lord and I was like Lord you care about those deer those are your deer those are those are your little babies I said and I'm Apprentice I think that you care about them I think they matter to you and then the thought came to me well Jesus said that he cares about The Sparrows and if a sparrow Falls from from the sky God knows it and then Jesus said but how much more are you than a sparrow and I was I was praying on that and I was just I was just thanking the Lord that he let me see these these deer and and praying and then the thought came to my mind about a brother who asked that I pray for him a friend of mine not from here and he said he said I'm taking a leave of absence from work he says I'm going to go away and he says I'm going to turn off my phone and he says I'm Really Gonna seek God about some decisions that I have to make so I started I started praying for him and I thought that's that's just a good thing to to set aside all the world and just get quiet before God and seek God want to talk to him and I I think and as I was up there praying I was I was thinking Lord how great it would be the desire of my heart and it's been for a long time to sit down with God and talk with him maybe sit across the table and have him speak to me it's just it's the greatest desire I've ever had think of the creator of the universe one to set all the stars in orbit and set this Earth in rotation around the Sun and and he's surrounded by his ever is thrown by millions of angels that that he would sit down and talk to me I thought oh Lord that you would just talk to me that you could be there and I was thinking on some things that's been the desire of my heart for for such a long time on Friday evening Daniel and I were here and and um we were doing some things and brother Harney came by and we were sitting there and we were talking Daniel was picking his guitar and and brother Harney were and I were talking about the Lord and and brother Arnie said he started to weep it was just tenderhearted and he said he says he said brother Daniel he says I just I've always just wanted to sit down across from him and talk to him and he said but maybe that's just not God's way and I said brother Arnie it's the same thing I desire more than anything in the world I desire to talk to him to be with him and to have him talk back to me and Lord I just I just want to see you we had a few years ago Daniel and I were going to visit a friend of mine here at Tucson Medical Center Banner hospital his name is Chris Ayers many of you know the Ayers family and Chris got a a bacterial infection I don't know if it was in his spinal column or in his brain I forgot exactly where it was but he was paralyzed he's paralyzed he could move one arm and everything else was paralyzed because of this infection Daniel and I went to the hospital to pray for him this is I don't know what four or five years ago buddy something like that and and we go in there and his mom sister Ayers was there and I I knelt down and I got my I believe I had my Bible I opened my Bible to Mark chapter 16. and I said I said I want to read something to you Chris is an old childhood friend of mine and we've known each other since we were little kids I said I want to read something to you Chris and I turned to Mark chapter 16 verse 15 that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and I I opened the Bible said Chris do you believe that Chris said yes stayed there for a moment I said Chris I said in the name of Jesus Christ raise up your arm he raised his arm up you remember Daniel pretty soon he was he was sitting up in his in his bed a man that was just paralyzed we continue talking everybody was kind of rejoicing it was it was just a good feeling and before Daniel and I left Chris said this Chris said Mom he said I want to go home sister Pat said well Chris she said honey well we'll get you discharged and sound like the Lord it looks like the Lord's healed you and he said no Mom he says I want to go home oh So Daniel and I left and we were walking across the parking lot of the hospital Daniel was excited it's like wow dad did you see that yeah I saw it I was there you know and and we were both excited he said he said Dad I just I can't believe I was there and I said but buddy I feel like the Lord's gonna take him did you hear what he said I want I wanna go home time past Chris got out of the hospital he went into a rehab center the Lord Heal them of the whatever the bacteria was and then he took him a man about my age the Lord he just took him and he wanted I saw that desire and Chris I want to go home I wanna I wanna see him and thinking on that and how that desire should be in us but there's many of us there's most of us that don't even have that desire to see God that don't have that burning desire to sin as brother Arnie said to sit across from him and talk with him that desire is so rare in the world today Revelation chapter 3 it says behold I stand at the door and knock Jesus speaking and if any man will hear my voice he's pleading he's knocking and if any man will hear my voice I will come to him and I will sup with him and he with me brother Ernie he'll sit across the table with us have supper with us but it's so rare in the world today there's Jesus he wants he desires that Fellowship even more than we desire it but so few so few really want it so few that it's written here in this Revelation chapter 3 which is this age that we live in behold I stand at the door knock how many of us are seeking God on a daily basis Isaiah 55 verse 6. the Lord Isaiah the God's Prophet says this he says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he was near while he is near what do you mean what do you mean when he's near there is a time that this time will pass that we are not able to call upon God we are given an opportunity and if we keep spurning that opportunity and he keeps knocking and knocking nothing that's pretty one day that knocks gonna stop and then there won't be any more opportunity but Isaiah says here seek ye the Lord while he may be found look at let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him turn to the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to go and to our God for he will have and he will I'm sorry let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon now listen to this for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heaven Heavens are higher than the earth soar my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts God is sovereign he has his way of doing things and our desires should be to get into his plan rather than making God fit into our plan it seems like when we when we call out to God when we're when we're seeking God's when we get in trouble but we should be seeking God all the time to have that fellowship with him but then there comes a time when we get hardened the things of God we get hard and then we will drive God so far away that we'll never see him again first John chapter 3. we we have to be careful we have to be flexible because remember our way of thinking is flawed we think that well Lord if I do this then you'll do this and then if you do this and all this is not a negotiation it's not a business deal we have with God his ways aren't our ways we don't understand the way that he does things but first John chapter 3 verse 1 says behold what manner of love the father has to bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knows us knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is think about that word that we are now the sons of God what an honor what a thought that we would be his son and I think about I'm a father I'm a dad I've got two kids and I think about my son Daniel who's my best friend in the whole world we just we love each other we spend all the time we talk all the time we're together what If Daniel didn't want to be around me said I don't have time for you I mean how would that make me feel then my own my own son would would say I don't have time for my dad we are made in the image of God imagine how it makes him feel when we don't have time for him I'm too busy I have I have this going on you know what I don't even want to talk to you I don't like maybe what I read or what I hear from this book it doesn't fit my way of life dad you know it's old-fashioned it doesn't work today dad we've got a new way this is God's Eternal Word in this book it says that we are his sons and we should treat him like a father we should treat him like Daniel treats me he's always calling me and talking to me and wanting wanting fellowship with his dad and how much more should we want Fellowship with our lord Jesus we should diligently seek Him the Bible says Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 says this but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him we must seek God with all of our hearts it's so important because I'm going to talk about a group of people here that they're most of the people that have walked this Earth and Jesus describes these people and it's a very it's one of the saddest stories that you could ever read Matthew Chapter 7 verse 1. says this it says judge not she be not judged for with judgment you judge you shall be judged with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again be careful what you say about other people because it might come right back right back on you and why behold us thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but considers not the beam that is in thine own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat of thine eye and behold the beam is in 909 thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast out the moat out of thy brother's eye give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye Pearls Before Swine unless they trample them under their feet and turn again and Rend you now remember I want to set the stagers he's talking about religious people here and he's talking to religious people ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened to you for everyone that asketh to receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened knock ask the Lord Lord I need you Lord I want to talk to you Lord I want to fellowship with you and if he doesn't if you don't hear back keep knocking he that knocketh continually keep knocking Lord Lord what about me Lord I need to talk to you hey Hear Me Lord you say well is that disrespectful Jacob did it Jacob wrestled with the Lord all night long he said I'm not going to let you go until you bless me skip to verse 13. enter ye in now here is where it gets serious the whole time but this is where it gets really strong inner ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there will be that go in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there will be that find it notice it's far fewer that find that life then go that broad way to destruction verse 21 skip to verse 21. not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in in heaven that's it they say to me Jesus is Lord and they confess it they're going to come before me and recognize are they going to come before me and recognize me at the as lord they're going to know that I jesus am the Lord speaking for Jesus that they're going to recognize him that he is the Lord but not all that do that are going to enter into the kingdom many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name there remember Jesus name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works have we not done these things in your name have I not preached the gospel in your name have I not prayed for the sick in Your Name Lord have I not brought people into church Lord have I not done all of these things in your name and then I then will I jesus profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity the Amplified Bible says this and then on if you keep that scripture up and then will I declare to them this is a another translation of that and then will I declare to them publicly I never knew you depart from me you are banished from my presence you who will act wickedly disregarding my Commandments I read that yesterday I was in my in my chair yesterday morning I was reading my Bible and I went to the trans other translations and I said oh Lord I immediately I got up and went into the to the bedroom and I got on my knees and I said Lord forgive me I said I don't want to be one of those people and it doesn't matter I've cast out devils in your name I preached the gospel in your name I prayed for the sick in your name and they were healed I I listened to tapes I passed out tracks I pastored a church and taught about you I raised good kids I told everyone I was a Christian and I recognized your profits when you're when you sent them and yet he still say depart from me you that work iniquity because I never knew you surely I can you and I I can know sister Shirley I can know about her I can know that that people say that that she's a prayer Warrior that that she's a good woman that she's she's always in church and I can hear all of these things about her but until I sit down and I fellowship with her I don't know her I just know what other people have told me about her and it's the same thing with God that he says I could come before him and say all these things he said who are you I've never talked to you I've never had fellowship with you I never knew you'd get out of here you're coming to me in my name and I don't even know you how do we know him we fellowship with them we seek his will we pray we talk to him we get to know him and then when we come on that day Lord I know you and he says son I know you too there's one thing I don't know about you is any sin you ever committed anything that you've ever done wrong no I don't know that I know you are my son I know that I love you because we've talked we've been together I know with Daniel we we talk and we we Fellowship all the time my my wife and my kids know me better than anyone else in the world why because they've spent the most time with me and it's the same with this scripture depart from me you the work iniquity I never knew you I don't care if you preached my gospel I don't care what you did I didn't know you you didn't spend the time with me fellowshipping what a disappointing day that is gonna be for many many people on that day I was talking to a a brother I just met him and never met him before recently and we were talking about some other stuff and then we started talking about the Lord and he said he said brother and came up in a different area and then I then I came up and as I said we never met and he said he said brother he says he said people in this message speaking about brother Brown's message if there's new people here if there's visitors here William Branham the one when I when I call when I call Brother Branham William Branham was a man that had the biggest Ministry in the whole world in the 1950s in the 1940s I'm talking carnally I'm talking just just naturally he would go to a city and fill up the largest stadiums in the city he was such a Gifted Man that that people would come and he could discern he could tell them what was wrong with them and millions thousands at least were healed in his meetings a great man of God and he stood against a denominational system he said you separate yourself God doesn't want you separated he said come out of that he used the scripture and pertained to do his ministry in Revelation that said come out of her my people come out of that mess that exclusive mess get out of that it's just going to lead you to hell you think because you're a Methodist or a Baptist or anything you think you're saved Jesus will stand there say depart from me I never knew you I don't care where you came from you didn't come to me you went to you went to your church your denomination when I talk about him that's the man I'm talking about I came up I gave my heart to the Lord listening to his sermons it's very special to me so this man he came from a a sect of of brother Brandon's Ministry and he said brother he said people were mean to me people were mean to our family he said they discriminated against us because we were part of the return Ministry Doctrine a return Minister you're meeting brother Branham is going to return and have another Ministry he says we were part of that and we believed that and people hated us for believing that I said well I said brother I said I know I said I was from the tapes only denomination I said denomination I was from the tapes only group and we believed that if you had a minister that you had to only listen to Brothers random States because if you listen to anybody else that was like Janice and Jammers withstanding Moses and you shouldn't you you shouldn't listen to anybody else but brother Brianna because he was the only he was the unadulterated word of God and if if you listen to anybody else it's like committing adultery I said that was my denomination I said that's your denomination brother Bram said I was Baptist and he says you're Pentecostal and you're Methodist he said but we're all Christians and I asked him I said all of these doctrines brother all of these doctrines that have gone around all of these decades I said what good have they done what good have they done except separate the people and cause that Division and caused that hatred that he has experienced and he said brother he says he says that's right and he's probably listening right now he said that's that's the truth he says done no good when we grow up in a certain way let me read let me read a quote from Brother Branham here brother Branham is talking about putting new wine in Old bottles and old wine skins it's their leather and and he was talking about I'll get to this in a minute but here's what he said he said if you say the baptism of the Holy Spirit was promised on the day of Pentecost to you and to your children and them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call which you quoted this morning my brother he said the old dry skin just bursts open and you lose your sermon that's right it doesn't do any good listen to this I'm ashamed that Pentecostal Skins are drying like that that's right come back to the word notice he said new wine is put into new bottles and the new skin has oil in it flexible and when the Holy Spirit comes down and says the baptism of the holy spirit is the same today as it ever was Divine Healing is the same as it ever was that new wine begins to spread out and the skin gives with it every time the word of God is preached in its power the new skin will holler amen I'll give it right away so you see the wisdom in a new bottle for new wine on the day of Pentecost there was 120 new wine skins laying on the floor there you'll find out the old skins was cast out but when God came from the Heavens to fill the new skins they got new life and began to bounce all over the floor and bounce out the door and Through the Windows and into the streets and the new skins with new bottles new wine Holy Ghost wine poured out full of life just stretching and giving Oh Brother John I don't care what denomination you belong to I love you anyhow there you are I don't care whether your Oneness twoness threeness fiveness we are brothers that's the new skin whether we're assemblies Church of God these are denominations that were there whether we are assemblies Church of God Foursquare whatever we are you got to quote up there good so I'm gonna add I'm gonna so you know this is me whether we are a return Ministry or tapes only or seven Thunders whatever we are that new skin stretch Plum out and take in every brother there is around but the old cowhide won't do that that's right it won't do it somehow it just won't do it it's all dried and set and it'll burst Mark chapter two let's read about these wine skins says this Mark chapter 2 verse 18. and The Disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do the Disciples of John and the Pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not now look what happens this is the prophet of the hour this is the one that was spoken of by by Malachi the Prophet this is the one that was spoken of by Isaiah to come and introduce the Lord Jesus a great prophet in fact Jesus said the greatest Prophet that ever lived and these are the people they're saying well we learn this John taught us that we're supposed to fast this is a doctrinal issue that's separating the people even in this time and Jesus said unto them can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days remember now it's very important who he's talking to he's talking to religious people no man also soweth a piece of new cloth and uh on an old garment else the new peace that filled it up taketh away from the old and the rent is made worse and no man put his new wine into Old bottles else the new wine does birth birth the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred but the new wine must be put into new bottles so what he's saying my brother Adam used to make the communion wine in Jeffersonville and he had his he had like a lab set up and everything was sterile and and perfect and he showed me the different stages of making the wine and when the wine is just put in as it's fermenting there's life in it and it's just what the Bible calls new wine and and brother Lionel it's degassing it's moving there's life in that wine and it's it's it's it'll bubble and froth and once it's once it's ready they bottle it but it's still undergoing a reaction it's still it still has that life in it it's got that seed it's got that germ in there and it's it's still moving and you bottle it and back when they had the wine skins they would put it in these wine skins and they'd seal it and that wine skin would have to swell with this new wine because there's that life and it's still moving it's still it's still going it's still fermenting it would have to swell and that's when you open a you open it up because pop because there's still it's still fermenting in there and if you put it in an old skin that can't move it blows and that's what Jesus Is Telling he's telling he's like listen you have all of your doctrines you say that John the Baptist that he fasted and all this he's like listen be flexible don't put God in a box and make him agree make him fall under your way of thinking you seek God and be flexible and and move with it move and it's like talking with his brother well they don't worship like we do Flex it's all right well they don't look like we do Flex move it's all right well they're not preaching the same thing we are Flex let it let it move let God put that new wine into this vessel and let it let it accept it don't burst say I'm finished with it I'm done I don't want any more no check it with the book don't interpret it don't just look for something to condemn it check it here check it with Christ and if it doesn't disagree with that just wait maybe that's that new Holy Spirit Wine that's coming down it's not dead it hasn't been sitting there for a long time it's moving it's still fermenting the Bible doesn't tell us that we need to speak with tongues it doesn't tell us that we need to do Miracles it doesn't tell us that we have to listen to tapes the Bible doesn't tell us that we need to join a church a certain denomination or a certain sect of Christianity the Bible tells us that we need to believe on the Lord Jesus that is everything and then what what our brother was saying this morning he's reach out he says God's going to do something in this church I think that we can see it happening God's doing something but let's be able and I think that's why he's doing it brother Matthew is because we Flex we can move with it but when you're you're set in your ways and you say it has to be this way can't do anything he can't pour that new living wine into our into us because we can't handle it we'll burst oh yeah I better uh I got a lot more here but we'll uh we'll we'll maybe put it off into it into another day but think about this new wine this what a beautiful aren't you glad that Jesus used parables aren't you glad that that he he made it to where we can understand it and he's like listen you're stiff Don't Be Stiff well we have to have it this way and and I know I I was like that right buddy but I still live my do my best to live my life a holy life and and righteous before the Lord I want to I want to do things according to his will and um I'll tell a story of me and Stephanie over last week we went up uh we gotta got a way up in the mountains just to relax and and um kind of try to come down to earth a little bit um but it was saying that this guy's always moving he wants to he wants to get stuff done I do and I want to do more but sometimes you got to recharge the battery it's charged so we got to get back to work um so we're up there and and I said uh I said honey I said uh I don't know why I said it but I was like I want to go see a movie you know but I said I said I'd like to I'd like to go see a movie so Stephanie gets on her phone and she's going on there and and she says this she says um honey well I know you and this is the only one that you would probably consider seeing and it was a movie called is it thy only son his only son is about Abraham and Isaac and we looked at I said yeah I said we can go see that I think I think it would be acceptable and so so we go and we we see we sit down and we see this movie and and I'll recommend it if you can see it it's it's really it's it's just a it's a good accurate movie there's there's not much written about Abraham but this one I think it it paints a good picture of who this man was and there was kind of the one of the bad guys or kind of bad guys in in the movie and he asked Abraham he says he says you know he says why you went and you conquered those kings he says and these Warriors are with you he says no no these aren't Warriors he says these were just Farm hands these were just normal people and he says you went to battle and you fought these people to save this city called Sodom he said he says you win and and you fought this battle just and then you go and you bargained he didn't say Bargain but but you go and you bargain with God if you could just find a few souls in there would you save it and he says then God destroys that City he says why would you do that and I can't remember the exact wording that he said but he said something on the order of talking about the people of Sodom he said they're just like we are he said they put themselves first before God I thought oh that's what we do we put ourselves first and God will wiped the Slate clean he's done it before and he'll do it again can you imagine coming before God on that Judgment Day say I'm good I went to church never missed a service I I I I paid my tithes never missed never missed paying my ties I let a lot of people I I brought them to church I did all of this and him looking down at you say depart I never knew you how how do you know me I've never talked to you how would I know you and it's gonna happen friends God forbid that there'll be people in this room that face that chances are I will God forbid that but we have to as the Bible say knock he that knocks Lord I want to talk to you I wanna I wanna I Wanna Be There Lord I want to I want to talk I want to see how you are like brother Arnie was saying I want to sit across the table from him and that's the only way these others were casting out Devils they were doing Miracles they were doing all of these things and yet how could how could Jesus say but they're not going to say I never knew you such an odd thing but it's gonna happen it's written here the musicians would come and I'll close with a story for me it happened to me this new wine make sure that these are vessels that can take this Holy Spirit that the new wine often represents that spirit it's alive and it comes into this vessel makes sure that these vessels are able they're able to take it I was as I said I've always live my life kind of legalistic and and I still do I don't judge others but I I try to live try to try to toe the line I um let's go to Acts chapter 23 I mean chapter 26. something happened when I was leaving my old job I had quit resigned and I made up my mind I was going to move to Tucson and quit and then the next morning I was sitting sitting in my chair and I was reading the book of Acts and it says this Acts chapter 26 verse 13. this is Paul Paul when he's on trial before this King he says at midday and he's telling the story of what had happened to him he says midday O King I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and then which journeyed with me and when we were all Fallen to the Earth I Heard a Voice speak unto me and say in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecute us thou me I relate it to this man Paul very strict in his doctrines very strict in the way he thought not able to to move with the Holy Spirit [Music] saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecute us thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and I read that I said Lord There's Something About This Here I Am it's like five o'clock in the morning I I just left and I'm making these big changes Lord I don't know am I right in doing this have I made a big mistake [Music] and I read that scripture saw saw why persecuted on me maybe it was Daniel Daniel why do you persecute me it's hard for you to kick against the pricks I was like well I don't know what that means seems odd it's hard for you to kick against the Pricks that that's is that like kicking it's a cactus or something and it pokes me back what is that and I looked and there was a note in my Bible and it said it said kick against the goads g-o-a-d-s I was like what is that well what's what's a goat and I did a little bit more research and I found that and I thought about shamgar and he took this Ox goat and he beat down all of these these Invaders with it and I said I said oh that's the same thing that that sham go used and it's a it's a it's a pointy thing that has a hook on it and you use it to push the cattle and if they don't go where you want to go you poke them and if you've ever had cattle when you give them a poke like that you better be standing back because they'll kick and it hurts if they hit you then hit then they're real quick with that but but you you poke them and they kick and if if you just go where I want you to go the end the end is inevitable they're gonna go through that shoot but they could save themselves a lot of grief if they wouldn't get poked and yet you kick against them and I thought oh Lord maybe that's what I've been doing that I've gone through my life and said it has to be this way and every time the Lord has tried to steer me or move me I've kicked against him and said no that's not the way I think it's supposed to be which is exactly what Paul was doing here kicking against God no no that's not this is this is the way I've learned this is the way it's got to be kicking fighting Paul says this I said who out there who out there Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us but rise and stand upon thy feet for I've appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in which I will appear in the which I will appear unto thee delivering me from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes a love love this scripture to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by faith that is in that is in me I love this part whereupon O King Agrippa even though I've done all this stuff in the past and I was of this unflexible vessel the way that I was whereupon O King Agrippa was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and now things are changed and I look at us friends be flexible be flexible with each other be understanding be flexible also don't forget be flexible with God because his ways aren't our ways but he wants to fellowship with us he wants to fill this vessel with his new wine [Music] let's make sure that we can take that new wine let's be flexible let's stand [Music] it's good friends it's good to hear the word of the lord it's good to read his word and to see that that Jesus that he the reason probably because he went to so many sinners is because the other ones wouldn't accept him they had those Stony hearts but he went to those that would that would take his correction that would love him and let's make sure that we are that way it's Bower heads brother Jonathan my friend if you come and close think about think about my conversation friends with that with that brother that said he was returned Ministry these things they may be right they may be wrong I don't
