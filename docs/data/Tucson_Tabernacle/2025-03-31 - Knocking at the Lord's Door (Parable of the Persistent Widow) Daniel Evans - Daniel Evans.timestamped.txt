[12:00] [Music]
[12:23] Yes. This is the day.
[12:27] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[12:31] That the Lord has
[12:34] made. I will
[12:37] rejoice. I will rejoice and be glad in
[12:41] it. And be glad in it. Yes, this is the
[12:47] day that the Lord has
[12:50] made. I will rejoice and be glad in it.
[12:57] This is the
[12:59] day. This is the day that the
[13:03] Lord has
[13:06] [Music]
[13:08] made. That's the truth. Anyone in Sunday
[13:11] school can head to the back now. We have
[13:13] Sunday school for any of the kids. We're
[13:16] going to sing that old song, I will
[13:18] praise him when I saw the cleansing
[13:19] fountain.
[13:24] Let's get those words up
[13:27] [Music]
[13:29] there. As everyone's still trickling in
[13:33] and as the Sunday school kids are
[13:34] leaving, let's sing this. Let's worship
[13:36] him this morning.
[13:39] [Music]
[13:42] When I saw the cleansing
[13:49] fountain,
[13:51] oh wide for all my
[13:57] sin. I obeyed the spirit's
[14:04] wooing when he said, "Wilt thou be
[14:09] clean?
[14:12] Oh,
[14:13] I will praise
[14:16] him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb
[14:23] for sinners slain.
[14:29] Give him glory all ye
[14:34] people for his blood has washed away
[14:39] each
[14:42] stain. And
[14:44] though the way seems straight and
[14:50] narrow, all I claimed was swept away.
[14:58] Oh
[14:59] my ambitions, plans and
[15:05] wishes at my feet in
[15:09] [Music]
[15:11] ashes. Oh, and
[15:14] I will praise
[15:16] him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb
[15:24] for sinners
[15:25] slain.
[15:28] name.
[15:29] Give him glory all you
[15:34] people for his blood has washed away
[15:40] each. Let's sing the chorus one more
[15:42] time. Oh, I will praise
[15:47] him.
[15:49] I will praise him.
[15:52] Praise the lamb for sinners
[15:57] [Music]
[15:59] slain. Give him glory all ye
[16:05] people for his blood has washed away
[16:10] each
[16:12] sin. Would you stand with these me this
[16:15] morning? While you're standing, go ahead
[16:17] and shake somebody's hand and greet
[16:19] them. Welcome them to church.
[16:23] We're going to sing I'm Amazed.
[16:30] [Music]
[17:08] Sing verse one of I'm Amazed. No one
[17:13] knew how alone I was
[17:19] feeling. And the emptiness I tried so
[17:23] hard to
[17:26] hide. Though I laughed and said my life
[17:31] was fine without
[17:35] you. I was covering up the secret tears.
[17:40] I
[17:43] cried. Then one
[17:45] day, someone told me of your
[17:51] mercy and the love you showed on a hill
[17:56] called
[17:58] Calvary. And there
[18:02] you purchase my
[18:07] redemption. when you broke sin's power
[18:10] and set my spirit
[18:14] free. Oh, I'm
[18:19] amazed that you love
[18:23] me. I'm
[18:25] amazed. Yes, Lord. and how you
[18:30] came through your
[18:33] preious blood I found
[18:38] pardoning and my
[18:40] sins are
[18:42] washed. They're all washed away. Oh my
[18:48] sins are washed away. I'm amazed that
[18:52] you love me. Oh, I'm
[18:57] amazed that you love
[19:01] me. I'm
[19:03] [Laughter]
[19:04] amazed how you
[19:08] came through your
[19:11] preious blood I found
[19:15] pardon. And my
[19:18] sins are washed.
[19:21] They're all washed away. All of my
[19:25] sins are washed away. Let's sing verse
[19:30] two. Yes, it's true. There have been
[19:34] days that I failed
[19:38] you. Lord, you know the many times I've
[19:43] gone astray.
[19:47] But I've learned your love is stronger
[19:50] than my
[19:54] weakness. And your ear is open every
[19:58] time I
[20:01] pray. No one else has ever cared for me
[20:06] like you,
[20:09] Lord. Other friends could never be this
[20:13] close to me.
[20:16] I'm not afraid to face the problems of
[20:23] tomorrow. Knowing you are everything
[20:27] I'll ever
[20:30] need. Yes, I'm
[20:34] amazed that you love me.
[20:39] I'm
[20:42] amazed how you
[20:45] care through your
[20:48] preious blood I found
[20:53] forever. And my
[20:55] sins are washed. They're all washed
[20:59] away. All of my sins are washed away.
[21:05] One more time. I'm amazed.
[21:08] I'm
[21:11] amazed that you love
[21:15] me. I'm
[21:16] [Music]
[21:18] amazed how you
[21:22] care through your
[21:24] preious blood I found for
[21:29] you. And my sins are
[21:33] washed. They're all washed away. All my
[21:38] sins are
[21:41] washed
[21:43] [Music]
[21:45] away. I don't know why he loved me, but
[21:48] he did. He did. And he came and he died
[21:51] for each and every one of us. We're
[21:53] going to sing How Great Is Our God.

[36:18] [Music]
[36:20] lamb. Worthy is the lamb.
[36:27] Worthy is the
[36:30] [Music]
[36:51] lamb. Before I sing, I would like to I
[36:53] have a testimony which will explain why
[36:56] I'm up here singing in front of all of
[36:57] you.
[36:58] Um, many years ago, I was sitting up
[37:01] front here in church. I was a teenager
[37:04] and I was having a very hard
[37:05] time. I had begun having these episodes
[37:08] that were thoughts going over in my head
[37:10] repeatedly. These thoughts could be
[37:12] anything. Phrases, numbers, images, and
[37:15] compulsions. They would last for days
[37:17] and sometimes weeks. There would they
[37:20] would be there at all day. At night they
[37:23] would wake me up and in the morning they
[37:24] would be there
[37:26] again. They would come with so much
[37:28] force until I felt I would lose my mind.
[37:30] This particular time sitting here I
[37:32] remember praying to the Lord if you will
[37:35] heal me I will get up and I will sing
[37:38] for you. And at the time it was like the
[37:41] biggest thing that I could think of
[37:42] which it still is. As time went on I
[37:45] continued to have these episodes. There
[37:47] were times I couldn't work and times I
[37:49] did work but would have to leave. I
[37:51] battled severe anxiety and depression
[37:52] and suicidal thoughts. I had started
[37:55] college but ended ended up having to
[37:57] quit. I was on medication and going to
[38:00] therapy. I felt like I was never going
[38:02] to be able to leave home, get married,
[38:04] or reach any of my
[38:05] goals. As hard as it was, God continued
[38:08] in different ways to show me his love
[38:10] and his
[38:11] mercy. As time went on, I learned to
[38:13] handle these episodes better. The del
[38:15] the Lord delivered me from depression
[38:16] and the suicidal thoughts and the
[38:19] anxiety was not as strong. A few years
[38:21] ago when we were ready to move back to
[38:23] Arizona, the thoughts started again and
[38:25] I felt discouraged because I felt that I
[38:27] should have had enough faith and insight
[38:29] to see it coming and I should have
[38:30] stopped it. I felt that I had let God
[38:33] down and my faith was
[38:36] weak. I told Stephen I wasn't going to
[38:39] cry, but it looks like it's going to
[38:40] happen. After one extremely hard day,
[38:43] Stephen and I counseledled with our
[38:45] previous pastor back in Kansas. After
[38:47] listening for a bit, he said, "Nina, why
[38:50] do you think you let God down?" Do you
[38:52] know how proud he is of you? Every time
[38:55] Satan throws something at you, you get
[38:57] up and you get back at it. You're a
[38:59] fighter. He's saying, "Look at my
[39:00] daughter. I'm proud of her." After this,
[39:03] I felt the freedom to seek help for
[39:05] these episodes. And it was I what I knew
[39:08] what it was all along. ous called
[39:09] obsessivecompulsive disorder. I began to
[39:12] use the help I found, but I didn't claim
[39:14] it for myself. I also began to call it
[39:17] out and tell Satan, "You are not my
[39:19] portion. Jesus is my portion. Healing is
[39:22] my
[39:23] portion." So, fast forward to about a
[39:26] month ago or so. If you remember,
[39:27] Brother Dan spoke a sermon on
[39:30] generational
[39:31] curses. OCD, anxiety, depression have
[39:34] been a generational curse in my family.
[39:36] During the service, I felt moved yet
[39:38] frustrated because the week prior had
[39:40] been very hard. But I had this strong
[39:43] feeling that God was urging me towards
[39:44] healing. I was on the verge of it. After
[39:47] the service, I went up for prayer and
[39:49] asked Brother Daniel, "How do you
[39:50] overcome something you have no control
[39:52] over?" And he said something along the
[39:54] lines of, "Sister Nenah, we don't have
[39:56] control over anything. Only God does." I
[39:59] asked, "But how do you overcome symptoms
[40:01] of OCD and anxiety? something that you
[40:04] don't know when it's going to
[40:07] happen. I know this was God because just
[40:10] the way it happened. And I didn't want
[40:12] to be one of those people who keeps
[40:13] going up for prayer and everybody's
[40:14] like, "She can't get her healing." But I
[40:16] went up. I felt strong to go up. And he
[40:19] said, "I'm going to anoint you with
[40:21] oil." And he turned to go to get the
[40:22] oil. But then he turned back around and
[40:24] he grabbed me by the
[40:26] shoulders and he said, "Sister Nina, do
[40:28] you believe God can heal you?" And I
[40:30] said, "Yes, I do." And he asked me
[40:32] again, "Do you believe?" And again, I
[40:34] said, "Yes, brother Dan. I wouldn't be
[40:37] here if it weren't for him." He asked me
[40:39] a third time, and I believe he was
[40:41] trying to initiate that faith within me.
[40:44] And I said, "Yes, I
[40:49] believe." That week, I began to notice a
[40:51] difference. My mind has been so
[40:55] clear. All I can think of is when clouds
[40:58] leave and the sun comes out. It has been
[41:00] so dark in my mind. I noticed that I
[41:03] wasn't doing the same things that I had
[41:05] been doing. And I even asked Stephen,
[41:07] "Have you noticed?" And he said, "Yes, I
[41:09] have." One morning on our drive to
[41:11] church, the Lord bragged in my mind all
[41:14] those years when I sat right up here and
[41:16] I said, "Lord, if you'll heal me, I'll
[41:17] sing for
[41:18] you." So that's this morning. And I want
[41:24] to encourage you. I know that mental
[41:25] illness is not something a lot of people
[41:27] talk about. And I prayed a lot about
[41:29] this because I thought, well, maybe some
[41:30] people don't want to hear this, but it's
[41:33] such a passion in my heart because it's
[41:35] been 30 over 30 long years. And I want
[41:39] you to
[41:41] realize if you battle with mental
[41:43] illness, just strong stand strong and
[41:45] believe in his word. He is true to his
[41:47] word and he is a healer.
[41:50] He's given us so many ways to find
[41:52] healing. use them just like you would
[41:54] for a physical ailment. You can do that
[41:56] for your mental health as well. Don't be
[41:59] ashamed of finding help. And lastly,
[42:02] this is very strong for me. Don't let it
[42:04] become your identity. On social media
[42:06] right now, there's a huge movement.
[42:08] There's even a song called My Anxiety.
[42:10] Don't do that. That's Satan letting you
[42:13] be bound by fear. Don't do that. Jesus
[42:16] is your portion. He's your identity. And
[42:19] that's what you need to get through.
[42:21] So today I have a wonderful job. I'm a
[42:24] teacher now. I am going back to school
[42:26] to finish getting my degree and I'm
[42:28] married. The Lord heals and he restores.
[42:31] God bless you.
[42:40] [Music]
[42:45] I have
[42:46] seen and I've
[42:49] heard that the
[42:52] king of the earth and the
[42:56] heavens, he has called me by my name.
[43:05] He's been
[43:07] there every
[43:09] step, every song, and every
[43:14] breath. And by his
[43:17] mercy, I will never be the same.
[43:23] [Music]
[43:26] And oh his goodness in my life is
[43:36] overwhelming. He is working
[43:40] everything out for my
[43:42] [Music]
[43:46] good. And in the valley of the shadow,
[43:52] still I know I am
[43:57] secure. Cuz he loves me like
[44:02] nobody ever
[44:05] [Music]
[44:08] could. Yes. He loves me like
[44:13] nobody ever could.
[44:17] [Music]
[44:19] Looking
[44:21] back now I
[44:24] see all the times he's carried
[44:29] me. He moves
[44:32] mountains and he always makes
[44:38] way. His goodness in my life is
[44:48] overwhelming. He is working
[44:52] everything out for my good.
[44:59] And in the valley of the shadow still I
[45:05] know I am
[45:08] secure cuz he loves me like
[45:13] nobody ever
[45:15] [Music]
[45:19] could. Yes, he loves me like
[45:24] nobody ever could.
[45:31] Nobody else can do
[45:34] miracles. No one else could ever
[45:39] save. No other love is
[45:43] unstoppable. So I will not be afraid.
[45:50] I'm on the verge of a miracle that no
[45:54] one else could ever
[45:58] do. I know that nothing's
[46:02] impossible when I put my hope in
[46:09] you. Oh, the goodness in my life is
[46:14] overwhelming.
[46:15] [Music]
[46:20] He is working
[46:23] everything out for my
[46:26] [Music]
[46:29] good. And in the valley of the shadow
[46:34] still I know I am
[46:39] secure cuz he loves me like
[46:44] nobody ever could.
[46:50] Yes, he loves me like
[46:54] nobody ever
[46:59] could. And in the valley of the shadow
[47:04] still I know I am
[47:09] secure cuz he loves me like

[47:16] [Music]
[47:19] could. Yes, he loves me like
[47:24] nobody ever could.
[47:28] [Music]
[47:30] No one ever cared for
[47:36] me like
[47:41] Jesus. There's no other friend so
[47:47] kind as he.
[47:53] No one else could take that sin and
[47:59] darkness from
[48:04] me. Oh, how much he
[48:09] cares for
[48:17] me.
[48:18] [Applause]
[48:22] Would you all stand as pastor
[48:28] comes? I was thinking of what we were
[48:30] going to sing and I think that's what
[48:32] we'll sing. No one ever cared for me
[48:34] like
[48:35] Jesus. No one
[48:38] ever cared for
[48:42] me like Jesus.
[48:48] There's no other friend so
[48:55] kind as
[49:00] he. No one else can take the same and
[49:08] darkness
[49:09] from me.
[49:16] [Music]
[49:26] Good morning friends. God bless you.
[49:33] Nina, she said that she wasn't she told
[49:37] her husband that she wasn't going to cry
[49:39] and
[49:41] then I started crying in the
[49:45] back. Thanks, Nina. Get me all worked up
[49:47] before I come out come out on the pull.
[49:50] Beautiful job. I didn't know that
[49:52] testimony you to just gave me a little
[49:55] bit. Wow, how beautiful.
[49:59] Let's um let's read the word of God to
[50:03] start with. Let's turn in our Bibles to
[50:05] Matthew chapter 7 verse 7 and 8 and then
[50:09] I'll go into Luke chapter
[50:17] [Music]
[50:22] 18 Matthew chapter 7 verse 7. And sister
[50:26] Nina I don't think
[50:27] that This could be a more appropriate
[50:29] scripture, more appropriate sermon this
[50:33] morning with the testimony that you gave
[50:36] and the song that you sang. Matthew
[50:38] chapter 7 verse 7 reads like this. The
[50:41] Lord Jesus speaking. He says, "Ask and
[50:44] it shall be given to you. Seek and ye
[50:46] shall find. Knock and it shall be opened
[50:49] unto you. For everyone that asks
[50:52] receives, and he that seeketh findeth,
[50:55] and to him that knockketh it shall be
[50:57] opened.
[50:58] Let's go to Luke chapter 18. And this is
[51:02] we're we have our parables studies that
[51:04] that we've been in for the past couple
[51:05] months. I want to continue on this
[51:07] morning with this parable of the
[51:10] persistent
[51:11] widow. Again, I don't think it could be
[51:14] more perfect with the songs that we sang
[51:16] and the testimony that we heard is this.
[51:18] Lukeapter 18
[51:22] verse1 speaking of the Lord Jesus. And
[51:25] he spake a parable unto them to this
[51:27] end, that men ought always to pray and
[51:31] not to faint, saying that there was in a
[51:36] city a judge which feared not God,
[51:38] neither regarded man, and there was a
[51:40] widow in that city, and she came unto
[51:43] him, saying, "Avenge me of mine
[51:44] adversary." And he would not for a
[51:47] while, but afterward he said within
[51:48] himself, "Though I fear not God, nor
[51:51] regard men, yet because this widow
[51:54] troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by
[51:57] her continual coming she weary me." And
[52:01] the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
[52:04] judge
[52:06] saith. Yet because this widow troubleeth
[52:08] me, I will avenge her, lest by her
[52:12] continual coming she weary me." And the
[52:14] Lord said, "Hear what the unjust I'm
[52:17] sorry I repeated that. Hear what the
[52:19] unjust judge
[52:22] saith, and shall not God avenge his own
[52:25] elect, which cry day and night unto him,
[52:29] though he bear long with them? I tell
[52:32] you that he will avenge them speedily."
[52:34] Nevertheless, when the Son of Man
[52:36] cometh, shall he find faith on earth.
[52:39] Let's bow our heads. Our
[52:43] father, in the name of your son Jesus
[52:47] Christ, we give this service to you and
[52:51] ask Lord that you would open up your
[52:54] word. Speak to the hearts of everyone
[52:56] that's here today. And father, may we
[52:59] leave this
[53:00] building and say as they said on the
[53:04] road to Emmas, did not our hearts burn
[53:07] within within us as he spoke to us by
[53:11] the
[53:12] way. Father, we pray that your holy
[53:14] spirit would speak to each of our hearts
[53:16] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[53:19] and be
[53:24] seated again.
[53:27] The Lord has his perfect way and his his
[53:30] perfect order of things. And I really
[53:33] believe that the um the testimony this
[53:37] morning in and the song goes perfect
[53:40] with with this sermon. I'm uh happy to
[53:44] see Jamie and Aaron. Welcome friends.
[53:48] God bless you. It's uh new friends. They

[54:39] appreciate you coming, David. It's good
[54:41] to see
[54:42] you. Welcome. Welcome back home. God
[54:45] bless. Um
[54:48] this Oh, Melissa, my sister-in-law. God
[54:52] bless you. I heard some murmuring back
[54:54] there and I was I was looking at I was
[54:56] looking at uh brother Clive Sister Beth
[54:58] and then didn't look over the top of
[55:00] them. God bless you sister. That's my
[55:02] wife's sister. Everybody knows Melissa.
[55:05] Um good uh good to see everyone in the
[55:08] house of the Lord this morning. Um
[55:12] this testimony, this parable
[55:16] um we have to lay a foundation to really
[55:19] understand what a parable means. We have
[55:22] to lay the the foundation of of where
[55:25] Jesus where he came from and the spirit
[55:29] in which that he is saying these. Now
[55:32] it's in Luke chapter 18. If you know
[55:34] your Bible, well, in Luke chap 17, Jesus
[55:38] is talking about the end of the world
[55:41] and he's talking about the second coming
[55:43] of Christ and he's talking about the
[55:45] great tribulation and and he's he he
[55:48] lifts this up and then remember when the
[55:52] gospels were originally written, they
[55:54] weren't written with chapters and
[55:55] verses. They were just written all the
[55:58] way through and and we have separated
[56:00] the chapters and verses so we can look
[56:02] them up but they're not originally like
[56:06] that. So when the breaks are we don't
[56:10] exactly know but but this Luke 17 to18
[56:13] is a continuation of Jesus's ministry of
[56:16] the end time. And he he explains this
[56:20] parable this story that I just read. And
[56:23] um it's a it's really it's a parable
[56:26] about
[56:27] prayer. The
[56:29] widow represents
[56:31] us wid widows back then they have a low
[56:35] they had a low standing in society. They
[56:37] were usually poor uh women and they were
[56:41] in need of help. And this widow was
[56:43] wronged in some way. Someone had taken
[56:46] something from her or cheated her in
[56:49] some way and she had no recourse. She
[56:51] was she had no representation before the
[56:54] law. So the only thing that she had to
[56:56] do was she had to cry out to this judge
[56:59] for justice.
[57:01] And she she didn't have a way to get her
[57:08] money back or or get whatever it was
[57:10] that was stolen back. And it's so often
[57:13] the case when someone wrongs us, we may
[57:16] not have a representation in this world.
[57:19] And we have to trust in the Lord in
[57:22] everything that we do. It's I this in
[57:26] this parable it's often really used in
[57:28] the wrong way. I don't believe that this
[57:30] judge I believe the widow represents us,
[57:32] but I don't believe the judge
[57:33] necessarily
[57:35] represents God. As most people say, he
[57:38] was an unjust judge. He didn't regard
[57:40] men. He didn't regard the the law. He
[57:43] didn't regard God. all all he was was
[57:46] just this man that was getting worn out
[57:50] by this woman and he gave her what she
[57:52] wanted because of that. And it's when we
[57:57] read, I say this often, when we read our
[58:01] Bibles, the Bible is not meant to be a
[58:05] science book. You know, it doesn't talk
[58:08] about how the origins of life came from
[58:10] when the amino acid chain came together
[58:13] through different through through
[58:14] different chemical reactions and then
[58:16] the amino acid chain somehow got
[58:18] energized and formed single cell
[58:20] organisms and then it formed blue green
[58:22] algae and then blue green algae somehow
[58:24] formed an atmosphere that was more
[58:25] conducive to multi-ell life and all of
[58:27] that all of that stuff. That's not the
[58:30] Bible. The Bible wasn't written for that
[58:33] purpose. The Bible has science in it and
[58:36] it's perfect, but that was not the
[58:39] purpose of the Bible and neither was it
[58:41] really written as a history book.
[58:43] There's some wonderful history and that
[58:44] history is perfect, but it wasn't
[58:47] written for history. There's brother
[58:51] Lyall when he was ministering on
[58:52] Wednesday night, he showed us how I
[58:55] believe it was David had died and then
[58:58] the next chapter or a little bit time
[59:00] after we see David back on the scene and
[59:02] and doing something else. So, it's not
[59:05] necessarily written
[59:08] chronologically and it is it is good a
[59:11] reference for history, but that was not
[59:13] the purpose of the Bible.
[59:16] The Bible was written as a book of
[59:21] relationship between
[59:23] God and
[59:25] mankind. That was the purpose of the
[59:28] Bible. And when we try to take it and
[59:29] when we try to make it fit some other
[59:32] form, that doesn't that doesn't work.
[59:36] But it is written from cover to cover.
[59:41] every book for a relationship between
[59:45] God and us. And you see the the the
[59:49] history in the Bible, it just keeps
[59:51] repeating itself. We see God blesses
[59:54] mankind and then mankind sins, mankind
[59:59] suffers for that sin. Mankind repents
[1:00:02] and then God blesses mankind again over
[1:00:05] and over and over again. We can see it
[1:00:08] in our lives. the same on a micro scale.
[1:00:11] We can see how we sin, we suffer for our
[1:00:15] sins, we repent, and then God makes it
[1:00:18] better over and over again. And that's
[1:00:22] how that's how this book is. And when we
[1:00:24] read this and when we read this parable,
[1:00:26] we need to understand that that's what
[1:00:28] it's about. It's about a relationship
[1:00:29] between God and human beings. Even you
[1:00:33] read
[1:00:34] Genesis, in the beginning, God created
[1:00:37] the heavens and the earth. And the earth
[1:00:39] was void and without form, and darkness
[1:00:42] was upon the face of the deep. And the
[1:00:45] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[1:00:48] water. And we see that God begins to
[1:00:53] create this world. We go day by
[1:00:57] day. And he creates it for the ultimate.
[1:01:01] And that's his son and his daughter. And
[1:01:05] he wants them to live there in harmony
[1:01:07] and in happiness. And that was the
[1:01:08] purpose in him doing it all. It was so
[1:01:11] that he would have a relationship with
[1:01:14] his children. And we see in the Garden
[1:01:16] of Eden that God could just come right
[1:01:19] down and walk through the garden, talk
[1:01:22] with Adam and talk with Eve and have
[1:01:25] fellowship. And then when sin came in in
[1:01:30] the garden, that's when the sin barrier
[1:01:33] began to make that relationship between
[1:01:37] mankind and God
[1:01:40] difficult. And as the world
[1:01:43] progressed, it came all the way to this
[1:01:47] day that we have now very very sinful
[1:01:50] generation. And and it's now it seems so
[1:01:55] hard because there's so many
[1:01:58] voices. It seems so hard for us to
[1:02:01] actually break through and really speak
[1:02:03] to God and then have him speak back.
[1:02:06] It's not because God isn't as available
[1:02:08] as he always was. It's because that the
[1:02:11] distractions of the world make it more
[1:02:13] difficult for us to break through to a
[1:02:15] conversation with God. You get down on
[1:02:18] your knees and it's it's not 15 minutes
[1:02:20] and the little square idol starts going
[1:02:22] off and you start getting a
[1:02:24] notification. It's and you're down and
[1:02:26] you're trying to pray. It's
[1:02:28] like well maybe if I just see who it
[1:02:32] was, am I the only one?
[1:02:36] No, it's
[1:02:40] bad. Turn the thing off. It's okay.
[1:02:45] Nobody, none of us are that
[1:02:48] important that somebody has to get in
[1:02:50] touch with us right away. But God is
[1:02:53] that important that we can set those
[1:02:55] things aside. And it's not just good
[1:02:58] enough that we have a few minutes in the
[1:03:00] morning and then a few minutes at
[1:03:02] night in
[1:03:04] prayer. We need to pray more. We need to
[1:03:08] pray all of the time. And that's what
[1:03:10] this parable is Jesus is trying to get
[1:03:12] across to to the the listener and and
[1:03:15] the reader is that times are coming that
[1:03:19] are going to be very very bad and very
[1:03:21] hard and you should always pray just
[1:03:24] like this widow woman is talking is
[1:03:27] trying to get this judge's attention.
[1:03:29] That's how we should be with God. Not
[1:03:31] because God's hard to get in touch with
[1:03:33] but because we need to break through
[1:03:35] that sin barrier because we have it in
[1:03:37] our lives. All of us do.
[1:03:39] And we have those distractions. Psalm 66
[1:03:43] says, "If I regard iniquity in my heart,
[1:03:46] the Lord will not hear
[1:03:49] me." The New Living Translation of that
[1:03:52] says, "If I had not confessed the sin in
[1:03:54] my heart, the Lord would not have
[1:03:57] listened." So, we need to get pray
[1:04:00] through and get rid of the sin that's in
[1:04:03] our lives. In first Peter, he says that
[1:04:07] we should get along with our wives, our
[1:04:10] spouses, and treat them right so our
[1:04:14] prayers won't be
[1:04:17] hindered. So many things can get in
[1:04:19] between us and the Lord. And it's
[1:04:22] distractions everywhere. So, it's so
[1:04:25] hard to go just 15 or 20 minutes in
[1:04:27] prayer without without the that
[1:04:30] stimulation that now as a as a child
[1:04:32] that the world teaches us that we have
[1:04:34] to have this constant stimula
[1:04:37] stimulation. And and when we can finally
[1:04:40] keep praying and keep praying and keep
[1:04:41] praying and and start to get rid of it,
[1:04:45] that's when we can break through to God.
[1:04:47] And what we have to do is we have to
[1:04:49] just keep knocking on God's door. keep
[1:04:52] knocking and keep knocking and keep
[1:04:54] praying. It's not that he's not
[1:04:56] answering. It's that we need to get a
[1:04:59] aside, get ourselves out of the way and
[1:05:01] get to talk to him. Just keep trying and
[1:05:04] keep going just like this widow did.
[1:05:06] Keep knocking at God's
[1:05:08] door. Matthew Matthew 7, as I read
[1:05:12] earlier, ask and it will be given to
[1:05:15] you. I'll read u the NIV, but yeah, I
[1:05:18] leave the King James up there. Ask and
[1:05:20] it will be given to you. Seek and you
[1:05:22] will find. Knock and the door will be
[1:05:24] open to you. For everyone who asks
[1:05:26] receives. The one who seeks finds and
[1:05:29] the one who knocks the door will be
[1:05:33] open. In James 4:1 it says, "From whence
[1:05:37] come wars and fighting among you? Come
[1:05:40] they not hints even of your own lusts
[1:05:42] that war in your members? You lust and
[1:05:44] you have not. You kill and you desire to
[1:05:47] have and you cannot obtain. You fight
[1:05:49] and war, yet ye have not because you ask
[1:05:53] not. And you ask and receive not because
[1:05:56] you ask a miss that they may be consumed
[1:05:59] that make that you may consume it upon
[1:06:02] your
[1:06:03] lusts. NIV is a little easier to
[1:06:05] understand on on that one. It says,
[1:06:08] "What causes fights and quarrels among
[1:06:11] you? Don't they come from your desires
[1:06:13] that battle within you? You desire but
[1:06:16] you do not have. So you kill. You covet
[1:06:19] but you cannot get what you want. So you
[1:06:22] quarrel and
[1:06:24] fight. You do not have because you do
[1:06:28] not ask
[1:06:29] God. When you ask, you do not receive
[1:06:32] because you ask with the wrong
[1:06:34] motives that you may spend what you get
[1:06:37] on your
[1:06:40] pleasures. These are scriptures about
[1:06:43] prayer.
[1:06:45] Think thinking about God during the day
[1:06:48] is not
[1:06:49] prayer. Prayer takes
[1:06:52] effort and more in today's society more
[1:06:55] in today's time than any time else in
[1:06:57] history. Charles Spurgeon says it's not
[1:07:00] a matter of time so much as it is a
[1:07:03] matter of heart. If you have the heart
[1:07:06] to pray, you will find the time.
[1:07:10] Brother Random said, "If you're too busy
[1:07:12] to pray, then you're too busy."
[1:07:18] I've talked with many people in
[1:07:21] counseling and so many people will come
[1:07:24] and and there's this statement that so
[1:07:27] many people make. They say, "Brother
[1:07:29] Daniel, I'm a
[1:07:30] mess." And when somebody tells me that,
[1:07:34] and they then they'll go on and say,
[1:07:35] "What's what's been happening in their
[1:07:36] lives?"
[1:07:38] When you say that, you are not a
[1:07:41] mess. What you have done is you have
[1:07:44] confessed and now you are seeking God
[1:07:47] and you are trying to find the Lord and
[1:07:49] you're trying to have the Lord come into
[1:07:51] your life to straighten out all of these
[1:07:53] things that you may have have messed up
[1:07:55] earlier. But that is when you are right
[1:07:57] with God. When you're truly seeking him.
[1:08:02] It's the person that says, "I'm good. I
[1:08:04] had an experience with the Lord when I
[1:08:06] was 18. I know what's right. I know what
[1:08:07] I'm doing." That's the person that I
[1:08:09] worry
[1:08:10] about. It's the person that says, "I'm a
[1:08:13] mess." That's knocking at God's door
[1:08:14] saying, "Lord, I need help. Lord, I need
[1:08:16] you. Would you would you please just
[1:08:18] hear me?" And the other person that's
[1:08:19] saying, "I'm good. I'm a Christian. I I
[1:08:21] don't I don't need any help." That's the
[1:08:23] person that I worry about as a
[1:08:26] pastor. Those are the people that it's
[1:08:28] hard to get through because there's no
[1:08:31] desire in their heart to really seek
[1:08:33] God. And this persistence of this
[1:08:36] widow, she sought the Lord. She needed
[1:08:40] something. And she went to this judge
[1:08:42] and she says, "I'm not giving up. You
[1:08:44] are gonna hear me. There's nobody else
[1:08:46] that will represent me. I am going to
[1:08:49] get your
[1:08:51] attention." And Jesus had just told his
[1:08:55] disciples, "Here's what it's going to be
[1:08:57] at the at the end of the world, at the
[1:08:59] end of time. It's going to be just like
[1:09:01] it was in the days of Noah. They're
[1:09:02] going to be going along. They're going
[1:09:04] to be eating and they're going to be
[1:09:05] drinking and they're going to be going
[1:09:06] out to dinner and they're going to be
[1:09:07] getting married and all of these things.
[1:09:09] And then the flood came and they didn't
[1:09:11] expect it. And then he says, then he
[1:09:14] goes on in Luke 17:30 28 and 30. Then he
[1:09:17] says, "And as it was in the days of
[1:09:20] Lot, he says they were just going about
[1:09:23] their lives. They were doing business.
[1:09:25] They were going to work every day. They
[1:09:27] were just having normal lives. And then
[1:09:29] it rained down fire from heaven and
[1:09:32] killed them
[1:09:33] all. And Jesus says that's how it's
[1:09:36] going to be. It's going to be just a
[1:09:38] normal
[1:09:40] day. And then those that are
[1:09:43] ready will be
[1:09:45] taken and those that aren't ready won't
[1:09:49] be
[1:09:52] taken. Luke, we'll we'll stay here in
[1:09:55] well Lukeapter 18 verse1. And he spake a
[1:09:58] parable unto them to this end that men
[1:10:00] ought to pray and not to faint. Right
[1:10:03] here we see the meaning of the parable
[1:10:05] that we should always pray and never
[1:10:07] give up on our prayers. The apostle s
[1:10:10] Paul said pray with pray always pray
[1:10:14] without ce ceasing. He describes the
[1:10:16] armor of God that we have to have to
[1:10:18] battle against the enemy. If Ephesians
[1:10:21] 6, let's just read it. Ephesians 6:1
[1:10:23] says this, "Put on the whole armor of
[1:10:25] God that you may be able to stand
[1:10:27] against the ws of the devil. For we
[1:10:29] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[1:10:31] against principalities, against powers,
[1:10:33] against rulers of the darkness of this
[1:10:35] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[1:10:37] high places. Wherefore take unto you the
[1:10:39] whole armor of God, that you may be able
[1:10:41] to withstand in the evil day, and having
[1:10:44] done all, to stand."
[1:10:47] Stand therefore, having your loins gird
[1:10:49] about with truth, and having your
[1:10:50] breastplate of righteousness, and your
[1:10:52] feet shaw with the preparation of the
[1:10:54] gospel of peace, and above all, taking
[1:10:56] the shield of
[1:10:57] faith, wherewith you shall be able to
[1:10:59] quench all the fiery darts of the
[1:11:01] wicked, and take the helmet of
[1:11:03] salvation, and the sword of the spirit,
[1:11:04] which is the word of God. So, how do we
[1:11:06] take this armor? How do we put on this
[1:11:08] armor? Verse 18, praying
[1:11:11] always with all prayer and supplication
[1:11:14] in the spirit and watching there unto
[1:11:16] with all perseverance and supplication
[1:11:18] for all
[1:11:20] saints. Another translation verse 18
[1:11:22] says, "Pray in the spirit at all times
[1:11:25] and on every occasion stay alert and be
[1:11:28] persistent in your prayers for all
[1:11:30] believers everywhere."
[1:11:35] Jesus said when he started the parable
[1:11:37] he said we should always pray and while
[1:11:41] we're praying not to
[1:11:43] faint what does that mean not to faint
[1:11:45] means don't give up keep pressing
[1:11:49] English Standard Version says don't lose
[1:11:53] heart Psalm 22 verse one a very famous
[1:11:56] psalm that we always we know that Jesus
[1:12:00] quoted this psalm when he was nailed to
[1:12:02] the
[1:12:04] cross says
[1:12:06] this. I'll read the New King James
[1:12:09] Version. My God, my God, why have you
[1:12:12] forsaken me? Why are you so far from
[1:12:16] helping
[1:12:17] me and from the words of my groaning?
[1:12:20] So, David was pro was definitely
[1:12:22] prophesying what was going to happen to
[1:12:24] Jesus when he was on the cross, but he
[1:12:26] was still something was still happening
[1:12:28] to David when he was inspired to say
[1:12:30] this. He was still going through
[1:12:32] something. And how many of us can say
[1:12:34] the same
[1:12:35] thing that that
[1:12:37] that David said, saying, "Lord, help us.
[1:12:40] Lord, help me. Why why have you forsaken
[1:12:43] me? Why do you not care about me? Why am
[1:12:46] I suffering all of these things? Why am
[1:12:47] I going through
[1:12:50] this?" And he has not forsaken
[1:12:54] us. It's all for a
[1:12:57] purpose. The man who is Quoting the
[1:13:01] words of David when he was on the
[1:13:03] cross, Jesus, he said, "I will never
[1:13:06] leave you nor forsake
[1:13:09] you." So he won't. Verse number two, "Oh
[1:13:13] my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do
[1:13:16] not hear and and in the night season and
[1:13:19] I am not silent." This is the same guy
[1:13:21] that killed Goliath with a
[1:13:23] rock. This is the same guy who went from
[1:13:26] a poor shepherd to the most powerful
[1:13:29] king in the world. And yet he says,
[1:13:31] "God, I cry out in the daytime and you
[1:13:33] don't hear me. And I cry out at night
[1:13:36] and Lord, you don't hear me then
[1:13:38] either." But notice David never stopped
[1:13:42] praying. He never stopped crying out.
[1:13:46] And don't get discouraged when you pray.
[1:13:49] You keep knocking. We keep knocking at
[1:13:51] at God's door. And even though God was
[1:13:54] not responding to David, God was
[1:13:57] hearing. God was listening. And watch
[1:14:00] David's attitude. David may not have
[1:14:02] been getting an answer from God, but
[1:14:04] watch his attitude. He says, "But you
[1:14:06] are holy enthroned in the praises of
[1:14:09] Israel. Our fathers trusted in you. They
[1:14:12] trust. They trusted and you delivered
[1:14:14] them. They cried to you and were
[1:14:15] delivered. They trusted in you and were
[1:14:18] not ashamed."
[1:14:20] NLT says, "They trusted in you and were
[1:14:22] never
[1:14:24] disgraced. But I am a worm and no man, a
[1:14:28] reproach of men and despised by the
[1:14:30] people. All those who see me ridicule
[1:14:33] me." They shoot out the lip and they
[1:14:36] shake the head, saying, "He trusted in
[1:14:37] the Lord. Let him rescue him and let him
[1:14:41] deliver him since he delights in him."
[1:14:44] Verse number nine. But
[1:14:46] you are he who took me out of the
[1:14:50] womb. You made me trust while on my
[1:14:54] mother's
[1:14:55] breasts. I was cast upon you from birth.
[1:14:58] From my mother's womb you have been my
[1:15:01] God. Be not far from
[1:15:03] me for trouble is near for there is none
[1:15:06] to help. So David is relying on God and
[1:15:10] he never stopped praying. He never
[1:15:12] stopped asking. He never stopped asking.
[1:15:14] He never stopped knocking at God's door.
[1:15:17] He was constantly saying, "Lord, help
[1:15:19] me. Lord, I need help. Lord, what about
[1:15:21] this? Lord, what about this? Why have
[1:15:23] you forsaken me?" And God was hearing,
[1:15:27] but God had a purpose in it all. If
[1:15:29] David wouldn't have been suffering, we
[1:15:31] would not have that psalm that Jesus
[1:15:34] fulfilled on the cross. He's always got
[1:15:37] a purpose.
[1:15:39] As Nina was
[1:15:41] singing and as she was giving her
[1:15:44] testimony, I couldn't help but think of
[1:15:48] this lady named Hannah in the Bible, the
[1:15:53] mother of the prophet
[1:15:55] Samuel. Hannah was married to a very
[1:15:58] good
[1:15:58] man. And this man, Elena, had two
[1:16:02] wives. The one wife was a mean-spirited
[1:16:05] woman.
[1:16:07] And the Lord allowed her to have
[1:16:10] children. And
[1:16:12] Hannah was barren and had no children.
[1:16:16] And this woman, this other wife of
[1:16:20] Elena, she used to make fun of Hannah
[1:16:24] because she didn't have children and
[1:16:26] ridicule her and put her
[1:16:29] down. And
[1:16:31] Hannah, she prayed and prayed that God
[1:16:34] would give her a child. And and as these
[1:16:37] prayers went on, days turned into weeks
[1:16:40] and weeks into months and months into
[1:16:42] years and probably years into
[1:16:45] decades that this lady
[1:16:48] Hannah had no children, had no she was
[1:16:52] not given a
[1:16:54] son. Crying out to God and praying,
[1:17:00] Lord, just my flesh is my heart is
[1:17:03] burning within me. I desire so much to
[1:17:07] have to give my husband a son. But time
[1:17:11] as time went on, Hannah began to mature
[1:17:16] in the
[1:17:17] Lord. And as she matured, she started to
[1:17:21] see how God was more important than
[1:17:25] Hannah
[1:17:26] was. and she started to take her desires
[1:17:30] and put
[1:17:32] them to
[1:17:34] God. 1st
[1:17:36] Samuel chapter 1 verse
[1:17:41] one and Hannah vowed a
[1:17:43] vow and said Lord of hosts if thou wilt
[1:17:47] indeed look on the affliction of thy
[1:17:49] handmade and remember me and not forget
[1:17:53] thine handmade but will give unto thy
[1:17:55] handmade a
[1:17:57] manchild then I will give him unto the
[1:18:00] Lord all the days of his
[1:18:03] life and there shall no razor come upon
[1:18:05] his head. And it came to pass as she
[1:18:07] continued praying before the Lord that
[1:18:09] Eli the
[1:18:11] priest marked her mouth. So she's in the
[1:18:15] in the church and she's at the altar and
[1:18:18] she is praying. And as she is praying,
[1:18:21] she's not making any noise. She's just
[1:18:23] praying quietly to herself. You know,
[1:18:26] God can hear us when we pray quietly to
[1:18:28] ourel also. It's not the volume of the
[1:18:32] prayer that matters. It's the sincerity
[1:18:34] of the prayer that matters. Now Hannah
[1:18:38] spake in her
[1:18:39] heart. Only her lips moved. Her voice
[1:18:42] was not heard. Therefore Eli thought
[1:18:44] that she had been drunken. And Eli said
[1:18:47] unto her, "How long wil thou be drunken?
[1:18:49] Put away thy wine from thee." And Hannah
[1:18:52] answered and said, "No, my lord. I am a
[1:18:55] woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk
[1:18:58] neither wine nor strong drink, but I
[1:19:00] have poured out my soul before the Lord.
[1:19:04] Look at the sincerity of Hannah and how
[1:19:08] that's how our prayers should be. She
[1:19:11] poured out her heart before the Lord.
[1:19:14] And count not that handmaiden for a
[1:19:16] daughter of Bile, a wi for a wicked and
[1:19:19] worthless person. For out of the
[1:19:22] abundance of my complaint and grief have
[1:19:24] I spoken hitherto. And Eli answered and
[1:19:27] said, "Go in peace, and the God of
[1:19:30] Israel grant thee thy petition that thou
[1:19:33] hast asked of him." And she said, "Let
[1:19:35] thine handmade find grace in thy sight."
[1:19:38] So the woman went her way and did eat.
[1:19:40] And her countenance was no more
[1:19:43] sad. So as I said, Hannah had been
[1:19:47] praying for all of these years. She had
[1:19:50] been praying that the Lord would would
[1:19:51] give her the desire of her heart.
[1:19:53] Nothing had happened. But God had a
[1:19:55] perfect time for this to happen. And if
[1:19:58] she would have had this child earlier,
[1:20:00] maybe Hannah was not ready for that
[1:20:03] child. This was going to be one of the
[1:20:06] greatest prophets, if not the greatest
[1:20:08] prophet in the entire Old Testament, the
[1:20:10] prophet Samuel. This was an important
[1:20:15] deal. And here's Hannah, and she's
[1:20:17] praying. And God had already chosen, he
[1:20:20] had already answered her prayers, but it
[1:20:22] had not been manifested yet. Hannah had
[1:20:24] to pray. And when we pray, friends, it
[1:20:28] is so important for our own walk with
[1:20:30] the Lord to pray,
[1:20:32] to constantly seek God. If we just get
[1:20:35] everything that we ask for, then it's no
[1:20:38] more there's
[1:20:40] no crying out to God. There's no more
[1:20:43] building our
[1:20:45] character. And Hannah's character was
[1:20:47] built to the to the point where she was
[1:20:50] just completely broken.
[1:20:52] And she said, 'Lord, if you will, and
[1:20:55] this is the spirit of the Lord that was
[1:20:58] upon her. If you will give me this
[1:21:02] son, then I
[1:21:05] won't raise him as a mother, then my
[1:21:09] husband won't raise him as a
[1:21:12] father. I will take this baby and I will
[1:21:18] give him to you, God. He will be a
[1:21:21] Nazerite to the Lord. He won't drink
[1:21:24] wine. He won't cut his hair. He won't He
[1:21:27] won't touch a dead body. He won't He He
[1:21:29] He'll live perfect before you, God. And
[1:21:32] I won't even I won't even get to raise
[1:21:34] him in my house. I want to give him to
[1:21:36] you. And that's what God required. That
[1:21:39] was the point of all of these prayers
[1:21:41] that Hannah had to get to to say, "Lord,
[1:21:43] it's yours."
[1:21:46] And
[1:21:47] then the pe the priest Eli, he gave his
[1:21:52] blessing upon Hannah. And then look at
[1:21:55] Hannah's response. The burden left her
[1:21:59] right there. She goes home from the
[1:22:03] church. She sleeps with her
[1:22:05] husband and they have a
[1:22:08] baby. and she lived up to her end by
[1:22:14] giving this child to the Lord. And as I
[1:22:16] said, he was the greatest in the Old
[1:22:20] Testament. There was Moses. Moses and
[1:22:22] Samuel. I don't know who was greater.
[1:22:24] They were both awesome. And maybe you
[1:22:26] can't compare them, but boy, they were
[1:22:28] both incredible prophets. And Samuel was
[1:22:31] right there with the best of them. But
[1:22:34] if Hannah would not have continued
[1:22:36] knocking for all of those years and
[1:22:39] continued asking, would she have had
[1:22:42] Samuel?
[1:22:44] No. But it was good for Hannah's
[1:22:47] character that she continued to knock.
[1:22:50] And it was
[1:22:52] good for the Lord. It was good for
[1:22:55] everybody. It was good for all of Israel
[1:22:59] that she waited. and she she waited for
[1:23:03] God's
[1:23:04] time. As Nina was singing that
[1:23:08] song, I was thinking that, wow, how many
[1:23:13] years has it been? And you've been
[1:23:15] praying and praying and praying and you
[1:23:19] had a song and you said, I'm going to
[1:23:22] sing when I'm delivered from this. I am
[1:23:25] going to sing and look what happened.
[1:23:27] And it it was it's a perfect example of
[1:23:30] how we continue to pray, Lord, why did I
[1:23:32] have to suffer all those years. Maybe
[1:23:34] you can help someone who is suffering
[1:23:36] from the same thing.
[1:23:39] Maybe you can help someone. Maybe you
[1:23:41] can be that compassionate person that
[1:23:42] might get put out with somebody and not
[1:23:45] understand. Maybe Nah can come in and
[1:23:47] say, "No, no, no. I went through this."
[1:23:51] And number one, I have compassion. And
[1:23:53] number two, let me tell you, God can
[1:23:55] deliver you like he delivered me.
[1:23:59] And
[1:24:00] Jesus as he is talking about this widow,
[1:24:03] he is compelling his disciples to pray
[1:24:05] continuously because the situation is
[1:24:08] dire. He had just been speaking about
[1:24:10] the second coming of Christ and then he
[1:24:13] gets into this parable of this
[1:24:14] persistent widow. So really this parable
[1:24:17] is more for us than it was for them
[1:24:20] 2,000 years ago because it's more about
[1:24:23] his second coming than it is his first
[1:24:25] coming.
[1:24:27] All right, we got to get to the parable.
[1:24:29] Luke uh Luke chapter 18. And he spake
[1:24:32] this parable unto them to this end that
[1:24:35] men ought to always pray and not to
[1:24:37] faint. So pray and never give up, saying
[1:24:40] that there was in the city a judge which
[1:24:42] feared not God nor regarded man. And
[1:24:44] there was a widow in that city, and she
[1:24:46] came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine
[1:24:48] adversary. And he would not for a while.
[1:24:52] But afterward he said within himself,
[1:24:53] "Though I fear not God, nor regard man,
[1:24:56] yet because this widow troubleeth me, I
[1:25:00] will avenge her, lest by her continually
[1:25:02] coming she weary
[1:25:05] me." She kept praying like David prayed.
[1:25:08] She kept knocking at the door like
[1:25:11] Hannah
[1:25:12] knocked. She kept pushing. And this this
[1:25:16] unjust judge is like, "Man, she is
[1:25:18] wearing me out." But she didn't give up.
[1:25:22] But people, all of us, many of us, we
[1:25:24] give up so easily. We give up on our
[1:25:26] jobs. We give up on our churches. We
[1:25:30] give up on life in
[1:25:32] general. We give up on God. Why? Because
[1:25:37] he doesn't do what we tell him to
[1:25:40] do. We don't tell God what to do.
[1:25:44] God is sovereign.
[1:25:46] Hannah, all of these years, she was
[1:25:49] praying, "Lord, give me a son. Give me a
[1:25:51] son. Give me." She's telling God,
[1:25:52] telling God, telling God. It was God's
[1:25:54] will that she had this son. But it was
[1:25:56] in God's time. Sister Nah was praying
[1:25:59] and praying, "Lord, deliver me. Deliver
[1:26:00] me. Deliver me." But the Lord said, "I I
[1:26:03] will." And she kept knocking at God's
[1:26:05] door and knocking at God's door. And
[1:26:07] then he delivered
[1:26:10] her. And that's what this this whole
[1:26:12] parable is about.
[1:26:15] God's
[1:26:17] nos are an answer to prayer. If he says
[1:26:21] no, how many of us, we look back through
[1:26:24] our lives, have prayed for something and
[1:26:28] didn't get what we want, and now we look
[1:26:31] back, say, Lord, I'm so thankful that
[1:26:34] you didn't answer that prayer. I am so
[1:26:37] thankful you didn't give me what I was
[1:26:39] asking you for. And that no is just as
[1:26:43] much as a blessing as yes. The yeses are
[1:26:45] always the ones that we want to tell
[1:26:46] everybody
[1:26:47] about because that that brings attention
[1:26:50] to answered prayer. But nos are just
[1:26:53] important. His nos keep us from
[1:26:56] mistakes.
[1:26:59] And the Lord said here what the unjudge
[1:27:02] unjust judge saith. So now Jesus he's
[1:27:05] saying learn a lesson from this unjust
[1:27:09] judge. Learn from the judge. The
[1:27:11] beginning of the parable was about
[1:27:13] praying and not giving up and keep
[1:27:15] pressing. But now at the end of the
[1:27:17] story, he says, "Learn from the
[1:27:19] judge." What lessons from the
[1:27:22] judge? He was an ungodly man. Could have
[1:27:25] cared less about serving God. Could have
[1:27:26] cared less about the people. He was
[1:27:29] judging. So what can we learn from this
[1:27:33] man? Verse back to verse number five, it
[1:27:35] says this. Yet because this widow
[1:27:38] troubles
[1:27:39] me, I will avenge her, lest by her
[1:27:44] continually coming she wearies me. And
[1:27:47] the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
[1:27:50] judge said." So he's saying that there
[1:27:51] is learn from this judge. There is
[1:27:53] coming a judgment where all the
[1:27:56] unrighteous will receive their
[1:27:57] punishment. God will punish those that
[1:28:00] persecute his children. And as
[1:28:02] Christians, we don't ever we don't like
[1:28:04] to talk about the
[1:28:05] punishment. We want to talk about all
[1:28:08] the blessings and all the salvation and
[1:28:10] all the good, but we neglect to talk
[1:28:13] about the harsh things and that there is
[1:28:16] a judgment coming. Jesus says, "Learn
[1:28:18] this parable. Learn from this
[1:28:21] judge." Jesus
[1:28:23] himself talked more about hell than he
[1:28:26] did heaven.
[1:28:29] warned us that there is coming a
[1:28:33] judgment and he says, "Learn from this
[1:28:36] judge." The judge says, "I will avenge
[1:28:41] her." I
[1:28:45] like what brother Brandham said. He
[1:28:47] said, "The bootleger, the gambler, the
[1:28:49] prostitute, and so forth, they won't be
[1:28:52] surprised. They know what's coming to
[1:28:54] them. But what's going to be the
[1:28:58] surprise is that fellow who thinks he's
[1:29:00] right and he's
[1:29:02] not. That's when you see your name is
[1:29:04] not on the book. The Lamb's Book of
[1:29:07] Life. That's when that's that's when
[1:29:10] it's going to going to be hard. When you
[1:29:12] think that you're a Christian and you're
[1:29:17] not. Quoted Charles Spurgeon again
[1:29:20] before. I'll quote him again. He says
[1:29:22] this, "It is the hypocrite who goes on
[1:29:24] peacefully without
[1:29:26] fear, confident where there is no ground
[1:29:29] for
[1:29:30] confidence. But these fears abound and
[1:29:33] in some respects they are healthy.
[1:29:36] Better to go to heaven doubting than to
[1:29:39] hell
[1:29:41] presuming." Verse number seven. And
[1:29:44] shall not God avenge his own elect which
[1:29:47] cry day and night unto him, though he
[1:29:49] bear long with
[1:29:52] them. NIV says, "And will God and will
[1:29:55] not God bring about justice for his
[1:29:57] chosen ones who cry out to him day and
[1:30:00] night while he will he keep putting them
[1:30:05] off? I tell you that he will avenge them
[1:30:07] speedily. Nevertheless, when the son of
[1:30:10] man cometh, shall he find faith on
[1:30:13] earth. So summary of the parable is
[1:30:17] Jesus starts the parable by saying that
[1:30:19] we should always pray and never give up.
[1:30:21] A widow who was the lowest in society
[1:30:23] back then. In Jesus's time, she was done
[1:30:27] wrong. She was cheated in some way.
[1:30:29] Maybe maybe her children, maybe her son
[1:30:31] was put into jail or something like
[1:30:33] that. Maybe someone stole her land. We
[1:30:35] don't we don't know what the her story
[1:30:37] was and it doesn't matter what it what
[1:30:39] it is. But she had no
[1:30:41] recourse. And the worst of all, she was
[1:30:44] assigned to a judge that had no fear of
[1:30:46] God and didn't really care about her,
[1:30:48] didn't care about the people he was
[1:30:50] judging. So the judge ignored the case
[1:30:52] for a while, but she kept knocking at
[1:30:55] the door. She kept writing him letters.
[1:30:57] She kept going to the going to the
[1:30:59] courthouse. She kept knocking at the
[1:31:01] door and telling and saying that I'm a
[1:31:03] widow. I need I need help. I need to get
[1:31:06] my prayers answered. I am not going to
[1:31:08] give
[1:31:10] up. I am the I am the elect. I am one of
[1:31:14] God's children. I am not going to give
[1:31:18] to give up. I'm going to keep
[1:31:21] praying. Good
[1:31:24] sermon. Good old message sermon.
[1:31:27] Encouraging. Keep going. Keep trying.
[1:31:29] Keep keep going. But there's more to
[1:31:32] this parable than
[1:31:34] that. I remember um I was in when I was
[1:31:38] playing ball in baseball in high school
[1:31:40] and college. I had I had a good fast
[1:31:42] ball. I was uh I was always I could
[1:31:46] throw harder than uh I throw as hard as
[1:31:49] anyone else in the league and I and
[1:31:50] harder than most. Had a good fast ball,
[1:31:52] but my best pitch was my change up. Just
[1:31:55] a straight change.
[1:31:57] And a straight change up is you're
[1:32:00] throwing your fast ball and then
[1:32:02] basically you just change
[1:32:05] speeds and it comes in a little slower
[1:32:07] and it messes up the timing of the
[1:32:11] hitter. Jesus was the master at the
[1:32:15] change
[1:32:16] up. He had a he he was a master at
[1:32:20] everything. He had a great fast ball,
[1:32:22] but he always threw that change up and
[1:32:26] got the listener, got the batter off
[1:32:30] balance. Listen to this. Back to Luke
[1:32:33] 18. He had just finished the story of
[1:32:35] the unjust judge and the widow. And this
[1:32:37] was the clincher. This was the strikeout
[1:32:42] pitch. And shout verse seven. And shall
[1:32:45] not God avenge his own elect, which cry
[1:32:49] day and night unto him, though he bear
[1:32:52] long with them? Sounds familiar, doesn't
[1:32:56] it? Which cry day and night unto
[1:32:59] him. God's, we go back to
[1:33:03] Ezekiel. God sends a judgment angel out
[1:33:06] into the
[1:33:07] world and he tells he tells this angel,
[1:33:11] he gives this angel specific
[1:33:12] instructions. Ezekiel chapter 9 verse 4
[1:33:16] it says this and the Lord said unto him
[1:33:18] go through the midst of the city through
[1:33:20] the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark
[1:33:22] upon the foreheads of men that sigh and
[1:33:25] cry for all the abominations that be
[1:33:28] done in the midst
[1:33:29] thereof. And to the others he said in my
[1:33:34] hearing, "Go ye after him through the
[1:33:37] city and smite. Let not your eye spare,
[1:33:41] neither have ye
[1:33:44] pity. Slay,
[1:33:47] avenge, slay utterly old and young, both
[1:33:50] maids and little children and women, but
[1:33:53] come not near any man upon whom this is
[1:33:57] this mark, and begin at my
[1:34:00] sanctuary. So start in the churches and
[1:34:04] move out from there.
[1:34:06] put a mark on those that sigh and cry
[1:34:09] for the sins of the city
[1:34:12] daily. Are these people really are they
[1:34:14] sighing and crying for the
[1:34:17] sin or are they sighing and crying for
[1:34:19] the people that commit the sin? Are they
[1:34:22] sighing and crying for that
[1:34:24] soul that is doing wrong and they and
[1:34:28] they see that this judgment angel is
[1:34:30] coming and he's going to avenge like
[1:34:32] Jesus said he's going to wipe it all
[1:34:34] out.
[1:34:35] And he says, "Start at the churches.
[1:34:38] Everyone that does not have that mark,
[1:34:41] that is constantly praying, constantly
[1:34:43] knocking at God's door, constantly
[1:34:45] approaching the Lord. Lord have mercy.
[1:34:46] Lord have mercy." And those ones that
[1:34:48] are not doing that, put a mark on those.
[1:34:51] And the ones that don't have the mark,
[1:34:52] destroy
[1:34:56] them. I tell you, verse number eight,
[1:34:59] back to Luke 18. I tell you that he will
[1:35:02] avenge them speedily.
[1:35:05] That was the fast ball. Now, here comes
[1:35:07] the change.
[1:35:09] Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes,
[1:35:12] shall he find faith on
[1:35:17] earth. This is the conclusion of the
[1:35:20] parable. Most people leave that part
[1:35:22] out, but that's the most important part
[1:35:25] about the whole story. When Jesus
[1:35:27] returns, is he going to find people that
[1:35:30] are constantly knocking at his door that
[1:35:33] are constantly knocking like this
[1:35:35] persistent widow is? Lord, I need help.
[1:35:38] Lord, heal
[1:35:40] me. Lord, I'm seeking you. Or is he
[1:35:43] going to find churches that aren't
[1:35:45] seeking God? Just people that are
[1:35:48] content in their own
[1:35:50] religion, content in their lives, not
[1:35:52] wanting any change unless something goes
[1:35:54] wrong, then they'll seek
[1:35:57] God. And if we are
[1:36:00] right, do we have the mark of those that
[1:36:05] sigh and cry for the sins of the world
[1:36:08] daily? Do I have that
[1:36:10] mark? Do you have it?
[1:36:13] Jesus is warning, as I said, he told
[1:36:17] this really nice parable, this really
[1:36:19] good feel-good sermon about keep
[1:36:21] knocking at keep knocking at the door.
[1:36:23] Keep knocking at God's door, keep
[1:36:24] praying, keep asking, God will deliver
[1:36:27] you, and that is all right. But then he
[1:36:30] says, however, in Jesus's words,
[1:36:35] nevertheless, when I
[1:36:37] return, will I find people who are
[1:36:40] constantly praying?
[1:36:42] Will I find people who are crying out
[1:36:44] for the lost when I return? Is anyone
[1:36:47] going to be doing
[1:36:49] this? When I said at the beginning, we
[1:36:51] try to get down in in five minutes, 10
[1:36:54] minutes. It's the hardest thing in the
[1:36:55] world to stay praying. Jesus through his
[1:36:58] prophetic gift. The Lord knew that it
[1:37:01] was going to be at the end time a very,
[1:37:03] very difficult
[1:37:05] time that people were going to be going
[1:37:07] about their own business saying that
[1:37:09] they're Christians and they're really
[1:37:10] not. And Jesus said, "When you see
[1:37:15] this, my coming is
[1:37:18] nigh." And then he asked a
[1:37:21] question. He says, "It's going to be so
[1:37:24] bad when I
[1:37:26] return. Am I going to find
[1:37:28] faith? Am I going to find faith on
[1:37:31] earth?" There's your
[1:37:33] meaning behind the parable. Am I going
[1:37:36] to find people who are truly knocking at
[1:37:38] God's door? Am I going to find those who
[1:37:42] are
[1:37:43] truly consecrated to my word? Am I going
[1:37:47] to find those who
[1:37:50] really trust in me like David? Oh my
[1:37:55] God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[1:37:57] And he's he's crying out to God, but
[1:37:59] then he says, "But I'm a
[1:38:01] worm, Lord. You don't owe me, but I'm
[1:38:04] going to be like that widow. I'm just
[1:38:05] going to keep knocking. I'm going to
[1:38:07] keep keep asking you. Musicians can come
[1:38:10] and we'll
[1:38:14] close. Go back to Matthew chapter 7. Ask
[1:38:18] and it will be given to you. Seek and
[1:38:22] you will find.
[1:38:23] Knock and that door will be open to you.
[1:38:27] For everyone that
[1:38:29] asks receives, and he who seeks finds,
[1:38:33] and the one who knocks the door will be
[1:38:38] opened. It is so hard to overcome the
[1:38:42] distractions of the world. If you read
[1:38:44] Revelation chapter 2 and chapter 3, we
[1:38:48] have letters to seven different
[1:38:49] churches. We know that these are seven
[1:38:53] different ages of the gentile church.
[1:38:57] And each
[1:38:58] one it says to him that
[1:39:02] overcomes and it gives a reward all the
[1:39:05] way down to the last one
[1:39:08] lessa. And it says
[1:39:11] now Jesus has instructed us to knock but
[1:39:16] now Jesus is the one
[1:39:19] knocking. He says behold I stand at the
[1:39:21] door and knock.
[1:39:24] How bad is this generation to where we
[1:39:26] don't have
[1:39:27] time and Jesus is standing there saying
[1:39:32] can I come in can I come into your
[1:39:36] life how much do we have to overcome now
[1:39:38] we have to start knocking at his door to
[1:39:41] get our our minds right and our hearts
[1:39:44] right and then allow him to come in the
[1:39:48] door of our
[1:39:49] heart but we have to pray continually
[1:39:53] knocking at the Lord, continually
[1:39:56] saying, "Lord, I'm like that widow. I'm
[1:39:57] going to keep praying. I'm going to keep
[1:39:59] I'm going to keep asking." And then when
[1:40:00] the Lord answers this prayer, don't stop
[1:40:03] asking now. Ask for something
[1:40:05] else. Okay, Lord, you gave me this. Now,
[1:40:09] I want a better understanding of your
[1:40:10] word. Lord, I I need to understand this.
[1:40:12] I need to understand this scripture.
[1:40:14] Well, what about then? He gives you the
[1:40:16] understanding of that. Okay, Lord. What
[1:40:17] about my son? What about me daughter?
[1:40:19] I'm I'm going to knock about that. Lord,
[1:40:21] I'm not going to stop. I'm going to keep
[1:40:23] knocking. Okay. Then he gives you your
[1:40:25] son or your daughter. They give their
[1:40:26] hearts to the Lord. They get baptized.
[1:40:28] Now, Lord, I'm not done. I am a
[1:40:31] mess. I'm I'm I'm terrible. Lord, I'm
[1:40:35] going to keep asking. I'm going to keep
[1:40:36] knocking. And when you keep knocking,
[1:40:37] and then when he
[1:40:39] returns, comes
[1:40:42] down and he says, "Ah, I found
[1:40:45] faith. I found faith in that one."
[1:40:47] because she was always knocking. She was
[1:40:49] always asking me. He was always asking.
[1:40:52] He was always talking with me. My point
[1:40:56] at the beginning, this
[1:40:58] book, it's not a science book and
[1:41:00] neither is a history book. It's a book
[1:41:03] of a
[1:41:04] relationship between
[1:41:07] God and a human being. And we need to
[1:41:11] continue that relationship. Continually
[1:41:13] asking, continually talking to
[1:41:16] him. Keep
[1:41:19] knocking. Always
[1:41:21] knock at God's
[1:41:23] door. And then he'll know you when he
[1:41:25] comes. And you will know him. And then
[1:41:29] you will be that one. There is a
[1:41:33] promise. There is a an elect group that
[1:41:37] will know God. There is a bride of
[1:41:39] Christ there. There are those that will
[1:41:42] be ready, but Jesus himself said,
[1:41:45] "Straight is the
[1:41:46] gate and narrow is the way and few there
[1:41:51] will be that find
[1:41:53] it." It'll be those that are always
[1:41:55] knocking, that are always
[1:41:58] asking, that
[1:42:00] pray and don't get
[1:42:02] discouraged, that continuing on. Just
[1:42:05] like sister Nina in that song. She asked
[1:42:08] and she asked and she prayed and she
[1:42:10] prayed and she kept she kept bringing it
[1:42:12] before God and God had his perfect
[1:42:15] time. It's happened to me so many times.
[1:42:18] I've waited for many times 20 30 years
[1:42:21] and then the Lord will answer something
[1:42:23] that I have asked continually asked for
[1:42:28] decades. Then he's also answered me with
[1:42:30] a
[1:42:31] no. And I thank him almost more for the
[1:42:34] nos than I do for the yeses. God bless
[1:42:37] you, brother
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:49] Messiah. Draw me close to
[1:42:57] you. Never let me go.
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:05] I lay it all down
[1:43:11] again to hear you say that I'm your
[1:43:19] friend. Oh, you are my desire.
[1:43:24] [Music]
[1:43:27] No one else will
[1:43:33] do cuz nothing else could take your
[1:43:40] place to feel the warmth of your
[1:43:47] grace. Help me find a
[1:43:51] way. Bring me back to you.
[1:44:01] You're all I've
[1:44:07] won. You're all I've
[1:44:11] ever
[1:44:14] needed. You're all I
[1:44:21] want. Help me know you are me.
[1:44:26] Draw me
[1:44:28] close. Draw me close to
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:35] you. Never let me
[1:44:41] go. I'll lay it all down
[1:44:48] again. To hear you say that I'm your
[1:44:52] friend.
[1:44:56] You are my
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:02] desire. No one else will
[1:45:08] do cuz nothing else could take your
[1:45:11] place. Next
[1:45:14] verse to feel the warmth of your
[1:45:18] embrace.
[1:45:22] Help me find a
[1:45:24] way. Bring me back to
[1:45:33] you. You're all I
[1:45:40] want. You're all I've

[1:45:47] You're all I
[1:45:52] want. Help me know you are
[1:46:00] me.
[1:46:04] Amen. I set the bar
[1:46:07] high, but I didn't set the
[1:46:09] bar. Jesus set the bar high.
[1:46:13] He
[1:46:15] said,
[1:46:17] "Except you do these things that we
[1:46:21] won't see the
[1:46:23] kingdom." We have faith in God, but
[1:46:26] don't let our faith be a deception.
[1:46:30] [Music]
[1:46:32] True faith in God comes by hearing the
[1:46:34] word of God. Believing on Jesus Christ
[1:46:38] as your savior. Continually praying,
[1:46:42] continually knocking at God's door,
[1:46:45] seeing that you are not perfect, seeing
[1:46:47] that you need God. And
[1:46:50] then you may when you reach the end, you
[1:46:54] may think that you're a complete
[1:46:56] failure, but God will look down and say,
[1:46:59] "No, enter in my good and faithful
[1:47:02] servant because you kept knocking at my
[1:47:04] door. You kept trying. You kept
[1:47:06] praying." Amen. Let's all stand.
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:20] [Music]
[1:47:27] You are the
[1:47:33] healer. Healer of my heart.
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:41] maker and the God of all we
[1:47:48] are. I was the broken
[1:47:52] vessel. I was the
[1:47:59] broken vessel in your hand.
[1:48:05] You look beyond the hurt and made me
[1:48:09] whole
[1:48:14] again. Healer of the broken
[1:48:20] pieces. You touched my heart and made it
[1:48:27] new. Now my whole life I surrender. Lay
[1:48:31] it down before the mener. Lord, I give
[1:48:35] my heart to
[1:48:39] you. Love that s before I knew
[1:48:45] you has brought me near to where you
[1:48:52] are. Now I live to praise
[1:48:55] you. Ever may I praise you, healer of my
[1:49:01] heart.
[1:49:02] [Music]
[1:49:06] Nothing
[1:49:07] compares and nothing compares
[1:49:13] Lord to knowing
[1:49:19] you and seeing what the grace of God can
[1:49:26] [Music]
[1:49:28] do. You're faithful.
[1:49:32] You faithfully saw
[1:49:37] me and called me your
[1:49:42] own. Then made a way to bring my
[1:49:46] wondering heart back
[1:49:51] home. Healer of the broken
[1:49:57] pieces. You touched my heart and made it
[1:50:00] new.
[1:50:04] Now my whole life I surrender. Laid down
[1:50:08] before the men. I give my heart to
[1:50:15] you. Love that song before I knew
[1:50:20] you. Has broken to where you are.
[1:50:28] Now I live to praise you ever may I
[1:50:32] praise you. You're the healer of my
[1:50:36] heart.
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:46] Oh I'm
[1:50:50] amazed that you are
[1:50:54] we amazed.
[1:50:58] is how you
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:02] care. Through your
[1:51:05] preious blood, I found
[1:51:10] pardon. And my
[1:51:13] sins are
[1:51:15] washed. They're all washed away. All of
[1:51:20] my
[1:51:21] sins are
[1:51:23] wash away.
[1:51:27] Oh, I I'm
[1:51:30] amazed that you offer me.
[1:51:35] I'm
[1:51:36] [Laughter]
[1:51:38] amazed how you
[1:51:42] care. Through your
[1:51:44] preious blood I found
[1:51:49] pardon. And my
[1:51:51] sins are
[1:51:53] washed. They're all washed away. Oh, my
[1:51:59] sins are washed
[1:52:02] away. Isn't it amazing that he loves us?
[1:52:05] It feels good to know that he loves me.
[1:52:08] You know, I see all my failures. I see
[1:52:10] all my faults, but I can look up and I
[1:52:13] can say, "He loves me." And I'm going to
[1:52:17] continually I'm going to pray. I'm going
[1:52:19] to knock at his door. I never want to
[1:52:22] stop because it's a blessing to knock.
[1:52:24] Jesus said in Matthew chapter 5, he
[1:52:27] said, "Blessed are they that hunger and
[1:52:30] thirst after righteousness, for they
[1:52:32] shall be filled." So, Brother Heath,
[1:52:34] we're blessed just to hunger and thirst.
[1:52:37] But then we have a promise that we shall
[1:52:40] be
[1:52:41] filled. Hunger and thirst, brothers and
[1:52:43] sisters, give him all you got. Let's bow
[1:52:45] our heads. Our heavenly father, Lord,
[1:52:48] you are great. You are wonderful,
[1:52:51] Father. You're so good to
[1:52:53] us, Lord. Thank you for this parable of
[1:52:56] this widow woman and this unjust
[1:53:00] judge. Father, Lord, let us be like that
[1:53:04] widow woman just continually knocking at
[1:53:07] your
[1:53:08] door. And Lord, forgive us that we
[1:53:12] haven't been as persistent as we should.
[1:53:15] Let us take this morning and father the
[1:53:18] words that we heard this morning and let
[1:53:20] us go and let let us put them into
[1:53:21] action father and help us Lord at least
[1:53:24] would you bring it to our remembrance
[1:53:26] when we are failing that we might lord
[1:53:30] make changes in our
[1:53:31] lives. Bless those father that are here
[1:53:34] everyone I pray those that are streaming
[1:53:37] in. Lord may this mark a day that we got
[1:53:41] closer to you.
[1:53:44] Father, give us Lord, give us your
[1:53:46] spirit. May your Holy Spirit rest upon
[1:53:49] each of
[1:53:50] us. And Lord, we love you and we'll give
[1:53:52] you the praise. We thank you, God. God,
[1:53:57] you're so good in Jesus name. Amen.

[1:57:29] you want.
[1:57:31] He's listening. Pray to him. Talk to
[1:57:35] him. We're made in his image.
[1:57:38] I'm a father. I love to talk to my kids.
[1:57:43] I love it when they reach out to me,

[2:02:34] I'd
[2:02:35] rather have
[2:02:38] Jesus than
[2:02:41] silver or
[2:02:44] gold. I'd rather be
[2:02:49] his than have
[2:02:52] riches untold.
[2:02:56] I'd
[2:02:57] rather have
[2:03:00] Jesus than
[2:03:03] housees
[2:03:06] or I'd
[2:03:08] rather be
[2:03:10] led by his hand.
[2:03:13] [Music]
[2:03:19] I'd
[2:03:21] rather have
[2:03:24] Jesus than
[2:03:26] men's
[2:03:29] applause. And I'd
[2:03:31] rather be
[2:03:34] faithful to
[2:03:36] his dear cause.
[2:03:40] I'd
[2:03:41] rather have
[2:03:44] Jesus than
[2:03:47] worldwide fame.
[2:03:50] And I'd rather rather be
[2:03:54] true to his
[2:03:57] holy
[2:03:59] name than to
[2:04:01] be the
[2:04:04] king of a
[2:04:06] vast domain.
[2:04:10] or be
[2:04:11] held in

[2:04:21] rather have

[2:04:32] world
[2:04:35] a day.
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:40] Oh, he's
[2:04:43] fairer than
[2:04:45] liies of
[2:04:48] rare
[2:04:50] bloom. And he's
[2:04:53] sweeter than
[2:04:55] honey from out of the comb.
[2:05:01] He's
[2:05:03] all my hunger and
[2:05:08] spirit
[2:05:10] needs. I'd
[2:05:12] rather have
[2:05:15] Jesus and
[2:05:17] let him leave.
[2:05:20] [Music]
[2:05:31] Do
