[0:17] on my phone and i read it
[0:19] sometimes we get a little nervous we get
[0:21] a little worried we see all hear the
[0:23] news
[0:25] we wonder about this and if you were
[0:27] watching any of the voting and you know
[0:30] but it says let every soul be subject
[0:32] unto the higher powers
[0:34] for there is no power
[0:36] but of god
[0:37] the powers that be are ordained of god
[0:41] and i read that i said thank you lord
[0:44] it's all under your control so
[0:46] sometimes we just go back to the word of
[0:48] god said lord
[0:49] i'm going to rest on that so
[0:52] amen i just read that and i said you
[0:54] know it would be encouraging just remind
[0:56] that if they have power they've been put
[0:57] in place it's because god has allowed it

[20:57] i'd like us

[21:06] it's called i know whom i have believed
[21:08] it's it's a methodist song

[21:19] the words are in really big print up
[21:21] there
[21:24] [Music]
[21:33] i know
[21:35] not why god's wondrous grace to
[21:40] me
[21:41] he has made known
[21:45] nor why
[21:47] with mercy
[21:49] christ in love
[21:52] redeem me for his own
[21:58] i know
[21:59] whom i have believed
[22:03] and am persuaded
[22:06] that he is able
[22:09] to
[22:10] keep that which i've committed
[22:16] unto him against that day
[22:22] i know not how this saving faith to me
[22:30] he did impart
[22:34] nor how
[22:36] believing
[22:39] his word brought peace within my heart
[22:46] but i know who
[22:49] i have believed
[22:52] and am persuaded
[22:55] that he is able
[22:59] to
[23:00] keep that which i've committed
[23:05] unto him against that day
[23:11] i know
[23:13] not how the spirit
[23:17] [Music]
[23:21] of proves
[23:25] revealing jesus through the
[23:29] word
[23:31] creating faith in him
[23:36] but i know
[23:39] i have believed
[23:42] and am persuaded
[23:45] that he is able to
[23:50] keep that which i've committed
[23:55] unto him
[23:57] against that day
[24:01] i know not when my lord may come at
[24:08] night
[24:10] for
[24:10] noonday fair
[24:14] nor if i walk the veil with him or meet
[24:22] him in the
[24:24] air
[24:26] but i know
[24:28] home i have believed
[24:32] and am persuaded
[24:35] that he is able
[24:39] to
[24:39] keep that which i've committed
[24:45] unto him against that day
[24:49] [Music]
[24:53] thank you sister martha
[24:58] there we go
[25:00] isn't it a glorious time to be alive
[25:03] to know our god
[25:06] not a fable
[25:07] not a myth not a well-crafted story
[25:10] not to know of him
[25:12] not to know about him
[25:15] but to know him
[25:18] to know whom i have believed
[25:23] i'm looking at the clock it's wednesday
[25:25] i'll try to be brief
[25:27] let's join our hearts and minds together
[25:29] in prayer to our lord as we approach
[25:31] reading from the bible whose pages we
[25:33] hold so dear
[25:35] lord jesus it's an honor and a privilege
[25:38] and a grave responsibility to be up here
[25:41] this evening
[25:42] lord i pray that you would move me out
[25:45] of the way lord forgive me where i
[25:47] fall so short
[25:49] lord jesus may you minister to your
[25:51] people tonight may you have words that
[25:53] will encourage and that will strengthen
[25:55] and that will heal and that will draw us
[25:57] closer together and draw us closer to
[25:59] you lord it's our desire to worship you
[26:02] to love you and to please you every day
[26:04] every hour every moment of our life
[26:07] we thank you in jesus precious name
[26:10] amen
[26:13] before we're seated
[26:14] we'll read from a
[26:16] familiar portion of the word
[26:21] the book of ecclesiastes the opening
[26:23] verses of chapter 3.
[26:25] now this book is attributed to solomon
[26:28] it was composed therefore more than 2
[26:31] 900 years ago
[26:34] when i was a teenager in california the
[26:36] verses we're going to read
[26:38] were also the words to a song
[26:41] that peaked at number one
[26:43] on the billboard music chart
[26:45] on december 3rd 1965.
[26:48] it was in the top 100
[26:50] for 14 weeks more than three months
[26:54] i i can't read this passage without
[26:56] sometimes hearing that soundtrack that's
[26:59] sometimes playing in my head hearing the
[27:01] music to that now the refrain of the
[27:03] song that we just sang together i know
[27:05] whom i have believe it
[27:07] that's a bible verse set to music
[27:10] but this is church
[27:11] we often do that
[27:13] can you imagine
[27:15] tuning to a popular music station today
[27:18] rock and roll or rap or whatever
[27:21] and hearing not just what amounts to
[27:23] gospel music but
[27:25] bible verses set to music
[27:28] and people listening to that
[27:30] over and over and over the most played
[27:33] song in america
[27:34] for three months
[27:36] that'd be almost as surprising as
[27:37] hearing an unbiased news report
[27:40] not going to happen well let's read
[27:43] ecclesiastes 3 to everything solomon
[27:46] tells us
[27:47] there's a season
[27:49] there's a time to every purpose under
[27:51] the heaven
[27:53] and solomon lists a number of contrasts
[27:56] that occur in life he says there's a
[27:57] time to be born
[27:59] and a time to die a time to plant and
[28:02] and a time to reap to pluck up that
[28:04] which is planted a time to kill
[28:07] and a time to heal
[28:09] a time to break down
[28:12] and a time to build up
[28:15] the time to weep
[28:18] time to laugh
[28:19] time to mourn
[28:21] and a time to dance
[28:25] a time to cast away stones and a time to
[28:28] gather stones together a time to embrace
[28:32] and a time to refrain from embracing a
[28:35] time to get
[28:37] and a time to lose
[28:38] a time to keep
[28:41] time to cast away
[28:44] a time to rend
[28:46] and a time to sow a time to keep silence
[28:51] and a time to speak
[28:53] a time to love
[28:55] a time to hate a time of war
[28:59] a time of peace
[29:02] please be seated
[29:04] and god's great plan
[29:06] there's both time
[29:08] and a time
[29:10] for everything
[29:13] there was a time for joseph to go to
[29:15] egypt arriving not only on the day but
[29:18] at the very minute that potiphar would
[29:20] suddenly appear in a certain slave
[29:22] market
[29:23] there was a time for pharaoh to decree
[29:25] the male hebrew babies to be killed
[29:28] so that moses would be raised in the
[29:30] king's house
[29:32] there was a time for moses to rescue the
[29:34] descendants of jacob israel
[29:36] from egypt
[29:38] there was a time for daniel to go into
[29:41] captivity in babylon
[29:44] there was a time for the maccabean
[29:45] revolt
[29:46] there was a time
[29:48] for jesus to be born
[29:51] and a time for him to die for us
[29:54] there was a time for stephen to be
[29:56] stoned
[29:58] in front of saul
[30:00] there was a time for philip to be on a
[30:02] lonely desert road to witness to an
[30:04] ethiopian noble
[30:06] there was a time for paul
[30:08] to spread the gospel of jesus christ
[30:10] throughout the mediterranean world
[30:13] more recently
[30:15] there was even a time
[30:17] for adolf hitler to foment an
[30:19] unspeakably horrific reign of terror
[30:22] there was a time
[30:24] for harry truman to grant diplomatic
[30:26] recognition to the modern nation of
[30:28] israel at its inception
[30:30] at a time when america was the sole
[30:32] superpower on this planet
[30:35] there was a time for brother branham's
[30:37] ministry to come on the scene
[30:39] and a time for him to depart
[30:42] there was a time for each one of us here
[30:45] or anyone that might see or hear this
[30:48] to recognize his or her
[30:51] my
[30:52] individual sin
[30:54] and need for a savior
[30:56] to accept
[30:58] and respond to the embrace of jesus
[31:01] christ
[31:03] and it's time now tonight
[31:05] for us to be gathered once again in this
[31:07] place
[31:09] to worship
[31:10] to praise
[31:12] to hear his words of life to us
[31:15] we're not here by chance
[31:18] i have a question for you well
[31:21] really i think the lord has this
[31:22] question for me and perhaps for you as
[31:24] well
[31:26] if this evening
[31:27] was your last evening
[31:31] in this life
[31:33] would you be able to look back on today
[31:35] and say thank you lord
[31:38] today was a good day
[31:40] i redeemed the time
[31:43] i was a doer of the word
[31:46] i have forgiven all who ever offended me
[31:49] regardless of my wounds
[31:52] i've taken responsibility for my actions
[31:56] i've made things right with any and all
[31:58] whom i think i may have offended
[32:00] i tried to let your light shine for me
[32:02] today lord
[32:04] i reflected your love
[32:07] by and through your grace
[32:09] i believe you were pleased with me today
[32:11] lord
[32:14] how can we live each day
[32:16] so we can say that
[32:20] in solomon's list of times he carefully
[32:22] contrasted things time to do this then
[32:25] time to do the opposite
[32:27] but there are some things where it's
[32:29] never time to do the opposite we should
[32:31] love the lord
[32:33] and never hate him
[32:35] we've read and heard so many times of
[32:37] late that we should always be
[32:39] thankful
[32:40] we should never be unthankful
[32:43] and we should hold to god's unchanging
[32:45] hand
[32:46] as we often sing here we should hold
[32:48] fast and and never let go
[32:54] i'm taking a couple of notes with me
[32:55] because when i come out from behind here
[32:57] and just speak without looking at my
[32:58] notes we might be here all night
[33:02] some 21 years ago
[33:04] heather and i moved to washington state
[33:06] we stayed there for about a dozen years
[33:10] and near our home there was a small
[33:12] private lake a couple of acres it wasn't
[33:14] particularly large
[33:16] but our extended family had permission
[33:19] to to go up into that private area and
[33:21] use that lake if we wished well one of
[33:24] my nephews
[33:25] had tied a rope to a branch on a limb of
[33:28] a tree a very stout road and a very
[33:30] strong branch and and it was it was kind
[33:32] of near the edge of the lake set back a
[33:34] little bit on this embankment and here's
[33:36] this branch and this really stout rope
[33:38] and you kind of walked along this trail
[33:39] and you'd get up and and the idea was to
[33:43] get a hold of this rope and then swing
[33:45] out over the lake
[33:47] and let go which is the right time and
[33:49] if you let go at the right time you'd
[33:51] land in the lake if you didn't the
[33:53] problem was that straight down there
[33:54] were rocks
[33:55] not not a pleasant place to land and if
[33:57] you didn't let go
[33:59] you'd smack right back into the
[34:00] embankment and wish you'd let go so you
[34:03] had a lot of incentive to hang on and to
[34:06] let go at the right time
[34:09] well
[34:10] naturally they wanted uncle lyle to
[34:12] enjoy this activity my nephew said come
[34:15] on uncle isle you can do this
[34:17] well
[34:18] after watching some of the younger
[34:19] generation do that i decided okay i'll
[34:22] give it a try well i forgot two things
[34:25] one i was at that time it seems young
[34:28] now but i was 51 years old at the time
[34:31] so i was a little heavier than i'd been
[34:33] in the days when i would swing on ropes
[34:36] i never was tarzan but but that was a
[34:38] fine but but the other thing that that
[34:41] had happened over those years is in in
[34:43] spite of the fact that i i worked at a
[34:45] desk job for many decades i hadn't built
[34:47] up a lot of upper body strength my upper
[34:49] body weight was not concentrated in my
[34:51] chest
[34:54] well i grabbed the rope
[34:56] i jumped
[34:57] i swung out from the embankment
[35:01] i quickly realized i was slipping down
[35:03] the rope
[35:05] and not at a slow rate of speed
[35:08] well what happens in any kind of a
[35:10] physical system where you've got a
[35:11] certain amount of energy and you're
[35:13] changing the center of gravity we have
[35:15] what we call in physics conservation of
[35:17] energy conservation of motion
[35:19] conservation of momentum what it
[35:21] basically means is as the as the weight
[35:24] slides down the pendulum the pendulum
[35:25] swings more slowly which which meant
[35:28] that not only was i going faster down
[35:30] the rope but i was approaching the lake
[35:32] slower and
[35:33] slower and
[35:35] slower
[35:37] well was i trying to solve a lot of
[35:39] physics equations in my head in those
[35:41] moments
[35:42] no i was looking at those rocks they
[35:44] were getting mighty close
[35:46] so what did i have to do well i i was
[35:48] able to bend my knees and bend my waist
[35:49] and tuck it and and let go of the rope
[35:52] at about the same time the rope let go
[35:54] of me
[35:55] and i managed to splash into the water
[35:58] it was pretty shallow right there but it
[36:00] was softer than the rocks
[36:04] this is not an example of graceful
[36:06] motion or of great acrobatic skills
[36:12] excuse me
[36:14] i need to get back up here
[36:17] because
[36:19] heather reminded me
[36:21] this past week
[36:23] of something that brother linhart used
[36:24] to say
[36:27] when you get to the end of your rope
[36:31] tie a knot
[36:33] hang on
[36:35] hold fast
[36:38] brother reggie preached her last week
[36:40] from hebrews unintentionally he said my
[36:42] brother noel has been preaching in india
[36:44] every couple of weeks from the book of
[36:46] hebrews so i'm going to read a little
[36:47] bit from the book of hebrews so we'll be
[36:49] in good company
[36:51] hebrews
[36:52] 10.
[36:54] starting at verse 23
[36:56] paul says let us hold fast
[36:59] seize
[37:00] hold tightly and retain
[37:03] firmly grasp
[37:05] the profession of our faith without
[37:08] wavering
[37:09] unswervingly
[37:11] regardless of the passage of time or
[37:14] changing circumstances for better for
[37:16] worse
[37:17] for he
[37:19] that's jesus
[37:20] is faithful
[37:22] trustworthy
[37:24] reliable
[37:25] dependable
[37:27] sure
[37:28] but promised
[37:30] and let us consider one another
[37:33] be continually aware
[37:35] attentive
[37:36] watching over one another learning how
[37:39] to provoke
[37:41] stimulate stir up
[37:43] incite each other unto love
[37:46] and to do good works
[37:50] not forsaking
[37:52] giving up
[37:53] abandoning
[37:55] neglecting the assembling of ourselves
[37:57] together as believers
[37:59] as the manner or the habit or practice
[38:01] of some is
[38:03] but exhorting
[38:05] admonishing warning
[38:07] urging
[38:09] encouraging one another
[38:11] and so much the more
[38:13] all the more faithfully
[38:15] as you see the day
[38:16] the day of christ's return approaching
[38:20] so tonight i'd like to encourage you
[38:23] to do what paul wrote
[38:26] going back to verse 23
[38:29] let us hold fast
[38:31] to the profession of our faith without
[38:33] wavering
[38:34] for he is faithful that promised
[38:37] hold fast
[38:39] to the profession
[38:41] of our faith
[38:43] and that's the title of the message
[38:45] tonight
[38:46] hold fast
[38:49] i want to share with you directly from
[38:51] the pages of the bible his words are
[38:53] true
[38:54] they're life
[38:57] we're often told the oldest book or
[38:58] narrative of the bible is that of job
[39:03] what did job have to say about holding
[39:05] fast job 27
[39:08] verse 6
[39:09] he says my righteousness i hold fast
[39:13] and will not let it go
[39:15] my heart shall not reproach me so long
[39:19] as i live
[39:21] job asserted his claim to innocence
[39:24] because he knew
[39:26] he'd been obedient to all of god's
[39:28] requirements known in his time
[39:31] his righteousness was anchored
[39:34] in his unwavering faith in god our our
[39:36] righteousness is by faith in jesus
[39:39] christ
[39:40] and in him alone
[39:42] in the face of calamity
[39:45] after calamity
[39:47] loss of wealth
[39:49] possessions
[39:50] sickness
[39:52] even the death of his children
[39:55] whom he loved
[39:56] and cherished do anything for
[40:00] job clung to his faith
[40:04] he held it close
[40:06] unwavering
[40:08] he knew where he stood with god
[40:10] even as he wondered
[40:12] lord why is all this happening to me
[40:20] solomon had something to say on this
[40:22] topic as well from the proverbs in a
[40:25] section where solomon is teaching his
[40:27] son he says my son this and my son that
[40:29] and he says in
[40:31] proverbs 4
[40:33] 13
[40:34] take fast hold of
[40:36] instruction let her not go keep her
[40:40] she is thy life
[40:43] the instruction of course is not just
[40:45] the book of proverbs that he's talking
[40:46] about they were still being written and
[40:49] collected and compiled
[40:52] solomon's referring to the entirety of
[40:54] the scriptures but at the time of the
[40:56] writing of proverbs
[40:57] the bible was the torah the pentateuch
[41:00] the five books of moses
[41:02] there may have also been some of the
[41:05] histories such as joshua or judges or
[41:07] ruth
[41:08] but they weren't considered canon at
[41:10] that time
[41:12] the psalms may have been collected by
[41:14] then the writings of his father who had
[41:16] just recently passed away
[41:18] perhaps even
[41:20] one of the scrolls of samuel had been
[41:22] written by then but none of the major or
[41:24] minor prophets
[41:25] no isaiah no jeremiah no malachi or amos
[41:29] no kings or chronicles they were just
[41:31] started as a set of journals being
[41:33] compiled over the history of israel
[41:35] which was really just beginning
[41:39] well moving on
[41:42] paul reminded timothy to study
[41:44] to take fast hold of instruction and not
[41:46] let it go
[41:48] to show himself approved of god rightly
[41:50] dividing the word of truth
[41:53] and in the final letter he wrote before
[41:55] his execution
[41:57] paul encouraged timothy in a manner
[41:59] similar to how solomon
[42:01] had encouraged his son in proverbs
[42:04] 2 timothy 3 starting at verse 15.
[42:10] he says to timothy and that from a child
[42:14] you were raised with this timothy
[42:16] you have known the holy scriptures
[42:19] which are able to make thee wise unto
[42:21] salvation to give you the wisdom to
[42:23] accept the salvation that comes through
[42:25] faith which is in christ jesus
[42:29] what we call the old testament pointed
[42:31] to jesus as the messiah
[42:34] by the time that paul was writing this
[42:36] the old testament had been compiled and
[42:38] was considered
[42:40] scripture was considered canon
[42:44] paul goes on
[42:46] all scripture is given
[42:48] by inspiration of god some translations
[42:52] read all scripture is
[42:54] god breathed we talked a bit about
[42:56] nephesh a few weeks ago and is
[42:59] profitable
[43:00] for doctrine
[43:01] teaching the truth
[43:03] for reproof
[43:05] rebuke
[43:06] convicting of sin
[43:08] for correction of error correcting
[43:11] faults
[43:12] for instruction in righteousness
[43:15] discipline training and right living
[43:18] to do what is right
[43:21] verse 17 that the man of god
[43:24] the people of god the servants of anyone
[43:27] who belongs to god may be perfect
[43:30] perfect here means complete
[43:32] mature
[43:34] capable
[43:35] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[43:38] fully equipped
[43:41] now timothy was familiar with scriptures
[43:43] from childhood
[43:45] he'd been tutored in the ways of the
[43:46] lord
[43:48] while not rare
[43:50] such a background was not
[43:52] common we're very fortunate in our time
[43:56] literacy is taught
[43:57] at no cost to virtually every child in
[44:00] america
[44:01] and much of the world
[44:03] the ability to read not so many years
[44:05] ago
[44:06] was a special skill accessible
[44:09] only to the wealthy
[44:11] or those employed in a way that required
[44:13] knowledge of letters and books scrolls
[44:16] codices were incredibly expensive they
[44:18] were all handwritten
[44:21] pre-industrial society was generally
[44:24] inefficient people labored and scratched
[44:26] out in existence from the soil
[44:29] they had no time for school
[44:31] nor could most afford a tutor for their
[44:33] children who were needed in the fields
[44:35] anyway
[44:38] how much value
[44:40] do we place
[44:41] on our literacy
[44:44] to what ends do we employ it
[44:48] what do we spend time reading
[44:51] how much of our time is spent browsing
[44:53] the internet
[44:54] reading and responding to posts on
[44:57] social media
[44:59] texting and emailing rather than
[45:01] conversing
[45:03] me
[45:05] when writing to the church of
[45:06] thessalonica
[45:08] paul concluded his first letter with an
[45:10] exhortation encouragement to the
[45:13] believers there let's read part of that
[45:15] first thessalonians 5 starting at verse
[45:17] 16.
[45:20] oh
[45:21] speaking to the believers there says
[45:23] rejoice evermore
[45:25] he mentions this attitude in letter
[45:27] after letter the joy of the lord is our
[45:29] strength
[45:31] pray without ceasing
[45:33] this is a matter of attitude
[45:36] not posture
[45:37] keeping our hearts and minds on the lord
[45:40] on the things in life that matter
[45:42] he tells us a lot about this in
[45:44] philippians for example he says in
[45:46] everything and not necessarily for
[45:48] everything but in
[45:51] everything
[45:52] give thanks
[45:54] for this is the will of god in christ
[45:56] jesus concerning you
[45:59] what's the will of god in your life
[46:02] to be thankful
[46:04] nothing mysterious here brother
[46:06] how can i be in god's perfect will for
[46:08] my life
[46:10] paul tells us plainly god's will for us
[46:12] is to give thanks
[46:13] in everything
[46:15] in every situation
[46:19] quench not the spirit
[46:21] he says don't stifle the holy spirit in
[46:23] your life
[46:25] but rather yield to the spirit of christ
[46:28] in you
[46:29] die to your own desires
[46:31] your own flesh
[46:33] let him
[46:34] live his life
[46:35] through yours
[46:38] despise not
[46:39] prophesying
[46:42] all things to prove means to test
[46:45] hold fast
[46:47] that which is good
[46:49] grip it tightly
[46:50] don't let it go
[46:52] you've made progress to this point don't
[46:54] slide back
[46:57] abstain from
[46:59] shrink back
[47:00] keep aloof from stay away from all
[47:03] appearance of evil
[47:05] you're being watched
[47:07] don't compromise your integrity
[47:10] your life testimony
[47:13] and the very god of peace
[47:16] sanctify you
[47:18] sanctify
[47:19] separate
[47:21] cleanse and prepare you for his service
[47:24] holy completely
[47:26] every which nothing left out
[47:29] and i pray god your whole your entire
[47:33] spirit and soul and body be preserved
[47:35] blameless
[47:36] not only without sin but without even
[47:39] blame
[47:40] not a hint of it
[47:42] unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
[47:45] faithful
[47:47] reliable
[47:49] dependable
[47:50] trustworthy
[47:52] is he that calleth you who also will do
[47:56] it
[47:58] who called you
[48:00] christ
[48:03] who says he'll do it do what sanctify
[48:06] you holy
[48:07] that your whole spirit and soul and body
[48:10] be preserved blameless until he returns
[48:17] in second thessalonians paul continues
[48:19] his theme of holding fast in one of my
[48:22] bibles this block of verses is
[48:25] headed
[48:26] stand firm
[48:28] ii thessalonians chapter 2 starting at
[48:31] verse
[48:32] 13. paul says we are bound
[48:36] compelled
[48:37] to give thanks every now and again
[48:39] sometimes occasionally
[48:42] when we feel like it
[48:44] when things are going good
[48:46] no
[48:47] we're compelled to give thanks always to
[48:49] god for you brethren
[48:51] and the greek this word translated
[48:53] brethren
[48:54] is a gender neutral word
[48:56] a better translation might be siblings
[48:59] we're siblings
[49:01] in christ
[49:04] beloved of the lord
[49:06] paul's a doer a practitioner of what he
[49:09] preaches
[49:10] what he teaches he tells people always
[49:12] to be thankful and here he claims that
[49:14] he does that very thing
[49:17] why is he always thankful in this case
[49:20] because god
[49:21] hath from the beginning
[49:24] who
[49:25] god
[49:27] when
[49:29] from the the beginning which beginning
[49:32] there's only one
[49:34] the beginning before the foundation of
[49:36] the world we read in another place god
[49:38] has chosen you to salvation
[49:41] redemption
[49:43] through sanctification of the spirit
[49:45] and belief
[49:47] faith trust
[49:49] confidence
[49:51] acceptance
[49:52] of the truth
[49:54] where unto he called you
[49:59] where unto in other words to what to
[50:01] sanctification and belief by by what
[50:03] means
[50:04] he called you by our gospel
[50:07] and it will ultimately result in what to
[50:09] the obtaining of the glory
[50:12] of our lord jesus christ
[50:16] therefore because of this
[50:18] siblings
[50:20] stand fast
[50:22] and hold the traditions the teachings
[50:24] the instruction which you have been
[50:25] taught
[50:26] whether by word
[50:28] or our epistle
[50:31] tradition
[50:34] it's not a song from fiddler on the roof
[50:37] it's not the the sort that jesus scolded
[50:39] the pharisees over where they have made
[50:41] the word of god of none effect by their
[50:43] traditions that's not what paul's
[50:45] talking about
[50:46] traditions in this context are teachings
[50:49] which the recipient in this case the
[50:51] thessalonians but in the broader sense
[50:53] us
[50:54] have been entrusted to transmit
[50:58] to spread
[50:59] the church
[51:00] the cult out the ecclesia and
[51:02] thessalonica are being told to keep a
[51:04] strong grip
[51:06] not to pollute or dilute
[51:09] and certainly not to forget
[51:12] and whether paul taught them these
[51:13] truths by speech when he was physically
[51:16] present
[51:17] when he was absent perhaps by others as
[51:19] his emissaries like timothy or silas
[51:22] or by letter
[51:24] they're important
[51:26] to be studied
[51:28] remembered
[51:29] taught
[51:30] spread
[51:33] cling to which you have been taught by
[51:35] christ through paul
[51:37] stand fast
[51:39] hold fast
[51:40] don't waver
[51:43] in a second letter to timothy
[51:46] which is his last letter ever
[51:49] paul says something similar
[51:52] ii timothy the first chapter
[51:55] starting somewhere in the 11th verse is
[51:57] as i paul
[51:58] am appointed
[52:00] appointed by the lord jesus
[52:03] a preacher
[52:04] a herald a proclaimer
[52:07] and an apostle
[52:09] a special messenger an emissary
[52:12] and a teacher
[52:13] of of what
[52:15] of of this good news to the gentiles
[52:19] for the which cause in other words this
[52:21] is why i also suffer these things as i
[52:24] do
[52:26] being in prison
[52:27] nevertheless i'm not ashamed
[52:32] for or because
[52:35] what we sang earlier i know whom i have
[52:37] believed
[52:38] paul says i know him in whom i have put
[52:40] my trust
[52:42] says the complete jewish bible
[52:45] the amplified bible says i perceive have
[52:48] knowledge of and am acquainted with him
[52:49] whom i have believed adhered to trusted
[52:52] and relied on
[52:54] in other words paul isn't relying on a
[52:56] teaching a concept a theory
[53:00] a book a concept
[53:02] an imagined thing
[53:04] he's met
[53:05] the resurrected lord jesus
[53:08] he has an ongoing relationship with god
[53:12] it's not just a pillar of fire on the
[53:13] road to damascus and that's it
[53:16] no
[53:16] no and based on that relationship
[53:19] and that trust built over time
[53:22] shared experiences
[53:24] he goes on to say not only do i know
[53:26] whom i have believed but i'm persuaded
[53:29] i'm convinced
[53:32] that he that christ
[53:34] is able to
[53:36] and implied is not only his ability
[53:40] but his desire and his willingness
[53:43] to keep
[53:45] to guard
[53:46] to protect
[53:48] that which i have committed unto him
[53:50] against that day
[53:53] uh oh he doesn't have his notes
[53:57] in 1966
[54:00] we were introduced to the message in
[54:02] california
[54:04] and uh some families came directly here
[54:06] to tucson the the dougals or the
[54:08] rashards and some others brother linhart
[54:11] uh
[54:12] felt like the lord was putting on his
[54:14] heart to go up to idaho somewhere in the
[54:16] region not too far from spokane
[54:17] washington where he had established a
[54:19] church when he was a part of the
[54:21] lutheran uh
[54:22] denomination and my parents and
[54:25] therefore i
[54:27] moved up to orofino idaho with him my
[54:30] brother noel was along brother lonnie
[54:32] jenkins was along with us at that time
[54:35] we rented a house there and
[54:38] my parents had a bedroom and the
[54:40] linhart's had a bedroom and carol and
[54:41] rosanne had a bedroom and then there was
[54:43] a basement level in there and we hung up
[54:45] some curtains in there we put in two
[54:47] bunk beds so dave lindheart and i were
[54:49] in one bunk bed and my brother noel and
[54:51] brother lonnie were in another bunk bed
[54:52] and alan lindheart sometimes he comes
[54:55] here and you see him he slept in the
[54:56] coal bin the place was was heated by
[54:59] fuel oil by then so he didn't sleep with
[55:00] a cold but he slept in what had been the
[55:02] cold bin and daniel slept in the laundry
[55:04] room
[55:06] anyway brother lonnie
[55:08] if any of you ever knew brother lonnie
[55:09] jenkins he was just on fire he learned
[55:11] something he dug into it he he grasped
[55:14] it and he shared it
[55:16] so he was getting invitations from some
[55:18] of the local small pentecostal churches
[55:20] there and so he was speaking in
[55:22] different places and we'd go along of
[55:24] course and um
[55:26] i remember one time we were singing the
[55:28] song that we opened up with tonight i
[55:29] know whom i have believe it and and
[55:31] after service brother lonnie looked at
[55:33] me i was a 16 year old kid right what
[55:35] did i know and he looked at me and he
[55:37] said well he said
[55:40] what have you entrusted into him against
[55:42] that day what is that song about
[55:45] i hadn't really thought about that and
[55:46] looked at him and i said well lonnie in
[55:48] those days i called him juani he was he
[55:50] was like part of the family he lived
[55:52] with us for many many months in
[55:53] california and it's a long history and
[55:55] story we
[55:56] maybe shared some time but i said
[55:59] i've i'm trusting you with my life with
[56:01] everything
[56:02] he said yeah that's right
[56:05] that's right
[56:06] and and that made me realize that
[56:08] sometimes when we're singing songs we
[56:09] have to pay attention to the words it's
[56:11] not just rhyming verses somebody was
[56:13] we're we're saying that we're
[56:15] proclaiming it we're singing it
[56:16] sometimes when we sing um
[56:19] uh
[56:21] like there's going to be a meeting in
[56:22] the air
[56:23] there there's a line in there that says
[56:26] and of jonah and the whale we often sing
[56:29] well you notice i never speak that line
[56:31] when we're singing that song i don't
[56:32] know any song about jonah i don't know
[56:34] anything about a whale i know about a
[56:36] great fish but i certainly don't often
[56:38] sing it so maybe based on that
[56:40] experience with the lining when i was 16
[56:42] years old
[56:44] i don't sing that particular line i'm
[56:46] not saying that you shouldn't talk i'm
[56:47] just i'm just sharing i'm just sharing
[56:52] goes on here in verse 13 he says hold
[56:54] fast
[56:56] guard keep with the greatest care
[57:00] the form of
[57:01] the form of sound words the pattern
[57:04] of wholesome and sound teaching which
[57:07] thou hast heard of
[57:09] learned from me in in and the faith and
[57:12] love which is which is for us in christ
[57:15] jesus
[57:19] he goes on that good thing
[57:22] that treasure
[57:24] that precious truth which was committed
[57:27] which was entrusted unto you keep it
[57:31] guard with the greatest care
[57:34] by the holy ghost
[57:36] which dwelleth in us us
[57:39] plural
[57:41] we're in this together
[57:43] we each
[57:44] have a role to play
[57:46] a service to perform
[57:48] a task to accomplish
[57:51] timothy
[57:53] hold fast
[57:55] hang on
[57:58] brother lyle you're reading a lot of
[58:00] scripture tonight
[58:01] yeah
[58:02] yeah because his are the words of life
[58:05] not mine i want you to see that this
[58:07] theme of holding fast
[58:10] not letting go
[58:12] clinging and persevering
[58:14] are traits that god encourages us to
[58:16] possess
[58:18] from job all the way to the end
[58:24] if we look in hebrews
[58:26] chapter 3
[58:27] we find paul is contrasting jesus with
[58:30] moses keep in mind that the letter to
[58:33] the hebrews is a letter to jewish
[58:34] believers and within judaism the hero
[58:38] the main guy
[58:40] is moses
[58:42] he's the the prime human character in
[58:45] judaism
[58:46] he's the lawgiver
[58:48] he's the man whom god spoke lip to ear
[58:52] now it wasn't because moses needed
[58:53] hearing aids like like brother lyle
[58:55] wears sometimes he wasn't shouting in
[58:58] moses ear he was whispering he was
[59:00] speaking to him as a friend hey moses
[59:03] check this out
[59:05] moses would then share through aaron
[59:08] and through writing the torah
[59:11] i hope
[59:12] some time to bring you a message about
[59:14] how writing that was even possible but
[59:16] it's okay not not tonight
[59:19] let's read hebrews 3 chapter 1.
[59:22] these are jewish believers he's writing
[59:24] to wherefore holy brethren partakers of
[59:26] the heavenly calling
[59:28] consider think about
[59:30] the apostle and high priest of our
[59:33] profession
[59:34] uh this is something they can relate to
[59:37] this is still the time of the second
[59:39] temple that hadn't yet been taken away
[59:41] they still had the high priest office
[59:43] the high priest of our profession is
[59:46] christ jesus
[59:48] recall earlier this evening we were told
[59:50] to hold fast
[59:52] to our profession
[59:53] here we see that jesus is the high
[59:55] priest of what
[59:57] our
[59:58] profession was faithful
[1:00:01] to him that appointed him as also moses
[1:00:04] was faithful in all his house he's
[1:00:05] making a comparison here for this man
[1:00:08] jesus
[1:00:09] was counted worthy of more glory
[1:00:12] more honor more respect
[1:00:14] than moses
[1:00:15] that's going to raise some eyebrows
[1:00:18] it is much as he who hath builded the
[1:00:20] house hath more honor than the house for
[1:00:23] every house is built by some man but
[1:00:26] he that built everything is god
[1:00:30] and moses
[1:00:31] certainly
[1:00:32] without a doubt verily absolutely was
[1:00:35] faithful in all his house
[1:00:38] as a servant
[1:00:40] for a testimony of those things which
[1:00:42] were re-spoken after
[1:00:45] but christ
[1:00:47] as a son over his own house
[1:00:52] whose house are we
[1:00:54] if
[1:00:55] there's a condition
[1:00:57] we have to meet this condition if we're
[1:00:58] to be of this house
[1:01:01] if what we hold fast
[1:01:04] the confidence
[1:01:06] not wavering
[1:01:07] not doubting
[1:01:09] resting in assurance
[1:01:11] and the rejoicing
[1:01:13] of the hope
[1:01:15] the joy of the lord is our strength and
[1:01:17] philippians we're told what sorts of
[1:01:18] things to think on and to speak about
[1:01:21] if we hold fast the confidence and
[1:01:23] rejoicing
[1:01:24] of the hope
[1:01:27] firm
[1:01:28] don't relax that grip
[1:01:31] for how long
[1:01:32] eight hours a day
[1:01:34] sabbath sunday when we're in church
[1:01:37] unto the end
[1:01:41] as we prepare to close i'd like to read
[1:01:43] one last portion from hebrews
[1:01:46] here paul explains about jesus being our
[1:01:49] high priest earlier this evening we read
[1:01:51] from hebrews 10 23 let us hold fast the
[1:01:54] profession of our faith without wavering
[1:01:56] for he's faithful that promised
[1:01:59] so let's touch just a bit on that
[1:02:01] holding fast to our profession
[1:02:03] and christ's faithfulness and that
[1:02:04] regard hebrews chapter 4
[1:02:08] verse 14
[1:02:10] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:02:12] priest
[1:02:15] that has passed into the heavens
[1:02:18] jesus the son of god
[1:02:20] there it is again let us hold fast
[1:02:23] our profession
[1:02:26] hold firmly
[1:02:27] grip tightly
[1:02:30] our confession of our faith in him our
[1:02:33] acknowledgement of what we believe is
[1:02:35] true
[1:02:36] for
[1:02:38] we have not a high priest which cannot
[1:02:40] be touched
[1:02:41] with a feeling of our infirmities in
[1:02:43] other words our high priest can be
[1:02:46] touched with the feeling of our
[1:02:47] infirmities
[1:02:49] he is not unable to understand
[1:02:52] so he's able to understand and can
[1:02:55] sympathize
[1:02:56] and have a shared feeling with our
[1:02:58] weaknesses
[1:03:00] and
[1:03:00] infirmities are liabilities to the
[1:03:03] assaults of temptation
[1:03:08] why because was it he was in all points
[1:03:12] tempted like as we are
[1:03:14] yet without sin
[1:03:16] he was tempted in every respect as we
[1:03:19] are
[1:03:21] because he took on human nature
[1:03:24] he faced the same testings we face
[1:03:28] different technology same nature
[1:03:31] what's the only difference
[1:03:33] he didn't sin
[1:03:37] because of this then paul says let us
[1:03:39] therefore
[1:03:40] because he completely understands us
[1:03:43] this high priest can truly have empathy
[1:03:47] let us therefore come boldly
[1:03:50] confidently not hesitantly
[1:03:52] not in fear
[1:03:55] unto the throne
[1:03:58] remember who he is and who we are
[1:04:01] it's his throne
[1:04:03] it's not ours
[1:04:05] we're not he's not a tool in our toolbox
[1:04:07] i often say
[1:04:08] come boldly unto the throne of grace
[1:04:12] undeserved favor
[1:04:14] because of what jesus did for us no
[1:04:16] other reason
[1:04:19] that we may
[1:04:20] obtain mercy
[1:04:24] mercy
[1:04:25] jesus told us in the sermon on the mount
[1:04:27] that in order to obtain mercy
[1:04:29] we must be merciful
[1:04:32] to obtain forgiveness
[1:04:35] we must forgive
[1:04:37] that we may obtain mercy and find grace
[1:04:41] not necessarily to be found at the seat
[1:04:43] of judgment but while he is still on the
[1:04:45] throne of grace we can obtain grace
[1:04:49] why
[1:04:50] to what end
[1:04:52] to help in time of need
[1:04:55] we need help
[1:04:57] we can't do it ourselves
[1:05:00] we're in this together
[1:05:02] with him
[1:05:04] and with each other
[1:05:06] we depend on his mercy
[1:05:09] found in his throne of grace
[1:05:13] we must hold fast
[1:05:15] regardless of the onslaught of our enemy
[1:05:18] of our flesh
[1:05:20] as well as satan himself
[1:05:25] we need to not only hold fast
[1:05:29] but we need to hold each other up in
[1:05:31] prayer
[1:05:33] we need to provoke one another to love
[1:05:36] and to acts of kindness
[1:05:40] last time i was privileged to be before
[1:05:42] you i read a word to the church
[1:05:44] in it were cautioned to stick together
[1:05:46] to support our pastor
[1:05:49] to be kind
[1:05:50] to say only nice things about each other
[1:05:53] to close ranks when we see the enemy in
[1:05:56] our midst
[1:05:57] to pray for each other
[1:06:00] jesus said we'd be known
[1:06:02] by our love for each other
[1:06:06] not by miracles not by signs and wonders
[1:06:10] by our love
[1:06:12] if you walk through the doors right now
[1:06:15] if he came through those doors right now
[1:06:17] what do you say well done
[1:06:19] i see this love manifested in your midst
[1:06:24] we must be doers
[1:06:26] and we must hold fast
[1:06:29] to all the things that we've reviewed
[1:06:31] tonight
[1:06:32] hold fast
[1:06:35] i'd like to invite sister martha to
[1:06:37] return to the piano here
[1:06:40] as we close the service
[1:06:43] i'd like us to sing one more song
[1:06:45] together
[1:06:47] this song is called hold the fort
[1:06:50] now whenever i think of this song
[1:06:53] i can see my mind's eye brother roy
[1:06:55] borders leading us in worship at the
[1:06:57] original tabernacle on south stone he
[1:07:00] led us in this song quite often
[1:07:03] but there's a backstory to this song
[1:07:05] that i'd like to just share with you for
[1:07:07] a couple of minutes so you can
[1:07:08] understand who wrote this why did they
[1:07:10] write this the song was written in 1870.
[1:07:14] by a fellow named philip bliss
[1:07:17] during the civil war
[1:07:19] in october
[1:07:20] 1864 a strategic position at altoona
[1:07:23] pass was being held by general course of
[1:07:26] illinois
[1:07:27] now if you look at this map here you'll
[1:07:29] see that this is atlanta georgia and
[1:07:31] this
[1:07:32] red teardrop up here in the upper left
[1:07:35] for you is
[1:07:36] showing where this location was altoona
[1:07:39] pass
[1:07:41] the union garrison under his command was
[1:07:43] outnumbered
[1:07:44] they were surrounded
[1:07:47] and the confederate general french
[1:07:48] summoned the yankees to surrender
[1:07:52] course refused
[1:07:54] fierce fighting ensued
[1:07:56] course and his troops were forced back
[1:07:59] forced up to the crest of the hill
[1:08:02] the situation seemed hopeless
[1:08:05] until the union officer
[1:08:08] caught sight of a signal flag
[1:08:10] across the valley atop kennesaw mountain
[1:08:13] which is the big blue arrow there
[1:08:17] the signal was answered
[1:08:19] and soon the message was waved signal
[1:08:22] flags the message was wave from mountain
[1:08:24] to mountain
[1:08:25] what was the message hold the fort for i

[1:08:30] wt sherman
[1:08:32] cheers went up
[1:08:34] and under murderous fire
[1:08:37] the position was held
[1:08:39] within three hours sherman's advanced
[1:08:41] guard had forced the confederates to
[1:08:43] retreat
[1:08:46] my siblings in christ we must always
[1:08:48] remember

[1:08:54] together but together with jesus christ
[1:08:57] and not only that
[1:08:59] but we're part of a body that stretches
[1:09:01] across our planet
[1:09:03] and reaches back through the mists of
[1:09:05] time
[1:09:07] and we're in a fight
[1:09:09] we're in a war
[1:09:11] for our very lives

[1:11:52] been a long time since i heard that song
[1:11:54] i think it was his brother nell johnson
[1:11:56] that would sing it sometimes
[1:11:59] i couldn't come in and take it over
[1:12:00] either so
[1:12:02] but the message wrong hold for it
[1:12:05] stand sometimes it's stand still and
[1:12:08] know that i'm god
[1:12:10] and sometimes he says march
[1:12:12] we listen to what the commander the
[1:12:14] captain of the host says
[1:12:16] you know joshua when he come up and he's
[1:12:20] he sees them and he goes are you for us
[1:12:22] are you against us
[1:12:24] and he says i'm the captain of the host
[1:12:29] and then josh says then what joshua says
[1:12:31] what do you want us to do
[1:12:34] say lord
[1:12:35] what is it you want us to do and
[1:12:36] sometimes he says stand still
[1:12:38] other times he says march
[1:12:41] and as his children and i like the work
[1:12:44] the way that's his siblings that's part
[1:12:46] of the family of god
[1:12:48] we believe in we hold fast let's stand
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:12:53] and trust in him and believe in him
[1:12:56] i appreciate sometimes the simplicity of
[1:12:58] the word of god
[1:13:00] you know
[1:13:02] one day i was listening to brother lyle
[1:13:04] and
[1:13:05] brother mike yarbrough speak
[1:13:07] out here in the
[1:13:10] in the fellowship hall and i thought
[1:13:12] they were talking another language all
[1:13:13] together
[1:13:15] talking about physics and
[1:13:17] the different things and
[1:13:19] me being that
[1:13:20] the serious man that i am
[1:13:23] walked up and i said i could not
[1:13:24] recommend your brains to anybody
[1:13:27] and they especially brother mike gave me
[1:13:30] the strangest look i said they're used
[1:13:33] they're so well used
[1:13:36] millions of miles put on them so mine's
[1:13:38] still brand new probably in the original
[1:13:40] packaging
[1:13:42] but you know
[1:13:44] god takes and he works with different
[1:13:46] ones different parts of the body
[1:13:48] for what it is you might say well
[1:13:51] you know but you know if that little
[1:13:52] part
[1:13:54] doesn't hold on
[1:13:56] it causes the rest to fail
[1:13:58] so hold on my brother my sister
[1:14:01] stand in your part
[1:14:03] do your place say amen let's bow our
[1:14:04] heads lord we
[1:14:06] we've heard your word today and
[1:14:08] in the reading of the scripture lord
[1:14:10] your words your word is infallible lord
[1:14:13] it never fails it meets every need
[1:14:17] lord
[1:14:18] and you you allowed men to pen these
[1:14:20] words lord led by the holy spirit and
[1:14:23] today we read them and it encourages us
[1:14:25] lord
[1:14:27] and not only that in the te in our own
