words of that song brother adam said all the redemptive that's not even all of them that song just has a few but he said all of the redemptive names jehovah rapha jehovah raj ova shaman he says all of them he says all consummated in jesus and he said and then jesus is the answer for anything you need so whatever you need tonight say lord whatever it is raise it up say god i i'm going to put it all on you because in you is my all in all my all sufficiency the bible says that name is above every name every name doesn't matter what satan labels it the doctors brother branham says that medical science gives diseases a name he says but it's a demon spirit might call it covet 19 but it's a demon amen the matter might be called depression but it's a demon spirit but the bible says that he gave him a name that was above every name so his name's higher than disease it's higher than sickness it's higher than depression that at the name of jesus every knee would bow and every tongue would confess and brother branham says every demon spirit every lion devil has to bow at that name jesus it's the name above all names and we claim that name of jesus tonight amen we want to invite our brother lyle to let him take his liberty at this time we're going to sing that again if you have something upon your heart you just want to say lord may your servant lord may you move him out of the

that we need in jesus christ good evening i want to thank you so much for being here i want to figure out how to use this thing to do the right thing yep there we go and i as usual there was something on my heart and when brother matt contacted me i thought yes i'm gonna share this and and i got back here into town and the lord had a different idea um and and usually i like to take days and days to prepare and and this really didn't start to come to me until friday night saturday morning and i this this is just a different place for me to be but i'm glad i'm here and i'm glad amongst brothers and sisters the body of christ and the love of jesus so with his help by his grace i want to get right to it so let's just approach him in prayer lord jesus it is such an honor it is such a privilege to be here among your people it's such a responsibility to be behind this desk lord i can't do it so i ask you to take me out of the way lord nobody that is here wants to hear anything from lyle johnson but everyone that is here wants to hear from you so lord we just pray that you would take control take control of my lips take control of my thoughts take control of my thoughts i don't want my thoughts i don't want my lips i don't want my voice lord i'm here to hear from you as well tonight speak to our hearts and we thank you for your love your mercy your grace your all-sufficiency in jesus precious name we ask amen while we're standing i'd like to read from two of moses writings that are found in the torah otherwise known as the pentateuch the first five books of the bible first from the book of leviticus chapter 23 the lord spake unto moses we we heard about that this morning didn't we the lord spake unto moses to speak unto the children of israel well what's he going to tell them in the seventh month in the first day of the month shall you have a sabbath shabbat a memorial of blowing of trumpets a holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord fire like we heard this morning hebrews 12 29 our god is a consuming fire fire fuel oxygen oil the atmosphere burn burn holy spirit burn in me set my heart on fire fill me with the holy ghost and god's full desire or reading next from numbers and the seventh month on the first day of the month you shall have a holy convocation that's what we're having you shall do no survival work it's a day of blowing the trumpets unto you please be seated the feast of trumpets rule shashana in hebrew or head of the year is jewish new year it began last friday evening september 18th 2020. why not two weeks before easter isn't that supposed to be the first month there are two calendars in judaism the religious calendar begins in the spring and the first month adar includes pesach passover easter the civil year begins on the first day of the seventh month according to jewish tradition dating from the second century a.d so about 100 years after christ this corresponds to the sixth day of creation when god created adam that tradition asserts is this occurring on october 7 37 61 bc so on the jewish calendar this is now the year 5781 and it just began so happy new years and now i'm not going to get into chronology i didn't bring out a stack of egyptian books or anything tonight but we know this first day of the seventh month rosh hashanah as the feast of trumpets well what's the purpose of blowing the trumpets of the shofar it's to get the attention of the congregation it's to call them together to call a holy convocation a gathering they didn't have pa systems back then so shofar is a way to shout your attention please we know in the book of revelation the seven trumpets are for israel not the gentiles seventh trumpet launches the unveiling of christ to jewish people i'm not getting into any of that tonight but but in modern jewish practice modern being relative this goes back quite a few centuries rosh hashanah is observed for two days it's because their calendar is lunar and the new moon is the time when there's no light on the moon and sometimes it's a little hard to figure out when that is if it happens to be at 9am or something so because they couldn't really be sure they made it a two-day festival well the jewish day begins at dusk when three stars are visible in the sky at night and it lasts until the next dusk and because loshashana the feast of trumpets is observed for two days we have until dusk tonight to blow the shofar another hour or so now as many of you know in the 1970s heather and i and our growing family lived in israel but in 1987 we returned to israel why to attend the wedding of my fiance well well my former fiance okay when i was in high school here in tucson i made an agreement with brother quinton and sister patty erickson to marry a daughter of theirs it would be a long engagement for this arranged marriage because i was only 18 and she was only two well after i met heather i went back to the ericksons and they graciously consented to void that arranged marriage anyway we were walking in the streets of the old city jerusalem in an area known as the cardo you can see it on the screen there this is a a street with small shops on either side but it was a main street it was uncovered during archeological excavations the pavement of it dates back to the time of jesus although the portion that you can now access the portion you see there dates back to the 6th century 80 the byzantine period as do the shops that you see in the other picture on the slide of course the shops now have you know glass walls and security systems and all that well while i was there i found this shofar it wasn't considered kosher because it had a tiny blemish in it so i was able to purchase it at a price that even i can manage to pay i later took it to a friend in israel he said he could fix it and he did i think if a rabbi inspected it now they'd declare it kosher but i i know it's not of course i'm not kosher either but anyway it's his a real shofar and since it's nearly dusk i thought i'd like to take the opportunity to sound the trumpet on the day of the feast of trumpets now i'm not very good at this this is a jewish prayer shawl that has hebrew inscription on it and so forth and basically the idea of the jewish folks when they're going to blow a shofar is they want to they want to wrap themselves in the word they have this fringed garment with these with these to leak now they've got all sort of traditions about how many threads and how many knots and certain things that they say when they put this on but when they're going to blow the shofar this this is their prayer closet if you will and then don't laugh that wasn't very good [Music] and that's the sound of the shofar and we want to keep ourselves wrapped in the word now and that they do one other thing in conjunction with this holiday it's it's called the tash leak it's a bit like our society's new year's resolutions representing a fresh start but unlike our secular pledges to do better uh dash leak is based on repentance the observant jew will preferably go to a body of water a stream or a lake or a sea and ask god to take away their sins and symbolically cast them in in micah chapter 7 we read who is a god like unto thee that pardon with iniquity and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retaineth not his anger forever because he delighteth in mercy we call that grace he will turn again he will have compassion upon us and he will he will turn again he will subdue our iniquities and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea so brother lyle is our topic tonight the feast of trumpets no what was the purpose of the shofar to get your attention and and i i hope i've got your attention now because that's what the bloating of the shofar does it gets attention and calls the gathering of god's people a holy convocation i want to speak tonight about jesus the light of the over the last few months especially i've heard people discouraged discouraged about life dissatisfied perhaps with their walk in christ discouraged about these times of enforced separation deaths and families and they can't even have funerals loss of job loss of income we've heard prayer requests about that even here this evening about employment economic stress instability general disheartenment with the direction our society is going we know it has to go there but it hurts to see it sharply divided political situation it's our age of laodicea apathy towards anything related to god it's lukewarm agnostic and this sometimes leads to a question of self-worth what what am i doing here anyway i don't seem to be accomplishing anything what's the point why does god even put up with me well jesus said this about our value to god matthew 10 are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your father luke expands on this he says are not five sparrows sold for two farthings looks like they had quantity discounts in jesus time too and not one of them is forgotten before god but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore you're of more value than many sparrows but but sometimes i still don't feel like i'm worth very much well consider a pair of 20 bills one is smooth shiny sterile maybe even crisp the other it's wrinkled defaced scribbled on dropped and damp and dirty maybe it fell on the floor of a not so clean public toilet or something it's just it's just not very nice well one you'd gladly put in your wallet the other might want to clean it up and wash your hands twice but here's the thing they're both worth exactly 20 dollars whether clean and crisp or ragged and worn the value of the one is not more and the value of the other is not less and and what about that value of 20 how was that established it was not established by its condition it was established by its creator now you may be feeling dirty care worn torn and patched wondering what value do i really have in the kingdom of god but your value was established by god that's what we call justification and what is that value then of course it's not twenty dollars he put such a high value on you and you and you and you and me that he came in the form of jesus to redeem you why would he redeem me so he could spend eternity with you and so you could spend eternity with him he'll get you cleaned up we call that sanctification but he doesn't stop there now the last several weeks we've heard a consistent reminder that we're to return to the faith of the first christians back to pentecost a heart-based experiential relationship with christ not a mere mental assent to christian principles or philosophy right we're told in this letter to hebrews chapter 4 seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast to our profession we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore because of this because of that high priest because of that connection let's come boldly to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need have you ever wondered if jesus was really tempted in all points like you or like me wasn't he the incarnate god aren't we told he was the uniquely born son of god well the answer to all three of those questions is yes jesus was god and he was simultaneously a man a flesh and blood human read in philippians let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus let's share his mind who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men he took on the form of man you might say oh he but he was different he couldn't really be tempted the way i am it was just a mask he wore it wasn't really like me paul insists he was tempted like us and every point not not not a mask he was absolutely a man here are some things that he said about himself john chapter 8 then speak jesus unto them again saying i am the light of the world that's the title of tonight's message the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life and further on in john's gospel jesus says in 9 5 as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world and after some time passes john writes a letter in first john chapter one we read in verse 5 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you this is what jesus told me john is saying god is light in him there's no darkness well you say what what's light got to do with him being a person like me i don't blow in the dark we know that the natural world has parallels it models it intersects with in some ways it interacts with the spiritual realm the jargon that we use for this is type as in the natural types the spiritual or joseph was a type of christ we think of our age of laodicea starting around 1906 but i'd like to take you back one year further than that to 1905 that sort of overlap period a 26 year old patent examiner a fellow involved in intellectual property brother peter in switzerland named albert einstein published a paper investigating certain properties of electromagnetism your eyes are starting to roll it's okay some electromagnetic energy we're we perceive as light we have these two organs these cameras that god gave us so that we can detect light and and this research was done einstein dug into this because light exhibited properties that just didn't fit the understanding of the physicists of the 19th century it's just not behaving the way they expected it to behave so his paper product proposed what is known as the special theory of relativity i'm not going to go into that in simple terms it just means that the laws that govern what happens on earth are not unique to the earth they apply throughout the universe the impact of that revelation is profound it's okay we're not going further into that but it's just like luther's doctrine of justification which dates back to the prophet habakkuk's writings this was not a new thing right we're trying to go back to the original lutheran back to habakkuk the just shall live by faith but that didn't fit the catholic understanding of salvation wesley's revelation of sanctification didn't fit the lutheran understanding of our relationship with god there's something unique about light stated simply light has two fundamental characteristics that are opposite yet it possesses both light appears to consist of small particles we call these photons okay in outer space we measure the effect of the resulting so-called solar wind we have to account for that if you send a probe to mars and you don't account for the force of those photons from the sun those tiny particles striking that spacecraft you'll miss mars by 15 or 20 000 miles you have to take it into account it's a tiny force but it's there okay um so light then consists of particles okay but that's how it gets through space right but but but how do they travel through glass windows not shattered it's not you know sanded and made opaque and all the rest of it light can go through very thick glass with no apparent effect yet not pass through a thin sheet of dark paper how do so-called low-e windows work in your home to reduce the heat from the sunlight that comes into the room what sort of particles do that they don't there aren't any they can't but a wave a wave a wave is a kind of a vibration of electromagnetic energy in this case if you will a wave camera like a radio signal that you can receive when you use a cell phone or or a wi-fi device so so then lights a wave yeah yeah but but you just said light consists of particles which is it it's both waves displace something right waves in the ocean the wave and energy displace the water but the water just bobs up and down unless it interacts with the shore and then you get a surf but you don't have a surf in the middle of the ocean space is a vacuum essentially so there's nothing to displace to propagate a wave so if light were simply a wave we'd all be in the dark but it would never reach us but if it were only particles it might break your window when it arrives here right transparent wouldn't wouldn't really mean anything so to carry this analogy of light remember we're talking about jesus being the light of the world to take this analogy jesus a little further think of us humans as particles as objects okay and and think of him spirit god not a physical being but but a wave not a particle so just like light jesus had a dual nature he could be a particle a human and still be a wave spirit he could be a hundred percent man and a hundred percent god he wasn't just a spirit in some sort of a hologram projection that looked like a man he was a man 100 but he was also god in the flesh of that man so we know that light possesses two states wave and particle two distinct natures you say well that's nice brother but uh below the shofar again i'm falling asleep i just want you to see that jesus could simultaneously possess two attributes he could be fully god and fully man so he could be tested in every point just like us as his human self now and light is the only our our vision senses light and that's the only thing that has this characteristic you can't detect it by touch or by smell or i won't stick my tongue out taste right it's by sight right we just read that god is light and jesus specifically identified himself as what the light of the world that's why i requested that song earlier this evening so much god yet so much man the dual nature of christ well you say that's nice brother but i'm i'm just a human i'm i'm not god ah unless you've received the holy spirit then you become a part of god jesus said as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world paul tells us in romans whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image that's a kind of a visual thing isn't it the image of his son that what he might be the first born among many brethren really really if he's our brother then then then does that mean we can possess that same type of dual nature yes we're taught every seed bears after its kind right john 12 he says while ye have light believe in the light that you may be the children of light these things spake jesus and departed and did hide himself from them every seed brings forth of its kind if jesus is the light and we become the children of light we become his children his offspring then we share his dual nature dna if you will so then aren't we the same kind as him matthew 5 yeah jesus says you are the light of the world a city set on a hill cannot be hid in other words we can have the same dual nature he can truly be tested in all points like us but without sin so that he could pay the price for our redemption if we don't have the indwelling of the holy spirit in the same magnitude that he did he had it all in one individual but if the spirit of god dwells in us what did brother branham call us in those conditions he used the term messiah et's right little messiahs messiah means anointed in this case by the spirit of god rather than a physical oil like like olive oil how did people get light in the midst of darkness in jesus day they didn't have electric lights leds little blinky cell phones right they had candles and they had lamps lamps were filled with olive oil and it was then wicked up and burned to provide light as you can see from this photo of an excavation there many lamps weren't large that just fits in the palm of a hand kind of like a little pen light or something right so they don't hold much oil do they no so think of the parable of the 10 virgins in their lamps you better keep plenty of oil handy if your light's burning you've got to keep refilling that lamp it can go fast but only if it's burning if it's not burning because you're going to save the oil because you might run out uh-oh what happens if it evaporates trouble jesus said neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel otherwise why bother to light it you're wasting the oil snuff it out but it's on a candle stick and it gives light unto all that are in the house i've got a question for brother lyle is my light shining is yours jesus said maybe this is a commandment he said let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and tell you what a good person you are uh no that's not what it says and glorify your father which is in heaven because if he's providing the light he gets the glory well well what are those good works and john we're told they said unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god and jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god you believe on him whom he has sent be his witnesses live your faith it's not complicated this is not complicated maybe that's what makes it hard we want it to be complicated so we can get involved right well well let's look at the early church for just a moment acts 2 verse 1. we've read this many times when the day of pentecost 50 days after the crucifixion ten days after jesus ascension when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place look all of one accord all means every whole the whole body of christ at that time was in one place and they run one accord when you tear down into the greek of all this stuff right it means unanimously of one mind let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus they were of one mind and this comes from roots of two words one meaning together and the other means passion not just mere agreement not agreeing to disagree not well i don't agree with that but i'm not going to say anything no no oh now in what way were they in this one accord in this one agreement we're not told uh personally i think that it was and their renewed dedication to being followers of jesus he said wait terry the power will come hang on be patient it's going to come he didn't tell him it'll come on this day at this moment at this time they had to be together they had to be in unity and they had to wait back to pentecost includes but it's not limited to being filled with the holy spirit or experiencing the presence of god it also means being passionately unified in our hearts and minds towards god and the body of christ consider some of those people that were in the room matthew he was a tax collector he worked for the enemy he took money from his own people and gave it to the people that were suppressing them he worked for the enemy then there was a fellow called simon the zealot well he was a zealot right what is that armed rebellion fight the romans kill them don't cooperate this led to the destruction of jerusalem and the temple in 70 a.d it was the zealots that were the uprising and this disciple is identified as being a zealot what about mary magdalene formerly demon possessed now delivered and she was the only disciple the only follower that believed jesus enough to go to his tomb before dawn without anointing spices to seek him is it true did he rise will i find him or is it just going to be his body laying in this borrowed tomb then there were james and john these two brothers right they kind of wanted to award it over the other guys oh lord grant that one of us can sit on your right hand and one on your left you say oh no that that was his mother that said that what was it was it jesus answered and said you know not what you ask are you able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with they not their mother they said unto him yeah we can do that hmm he said unto them you shall drink indeed to my cup you will be and baptized with the baptism i'm baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left it's not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father now look what happens this wasn't some conversation they had in a corner they didn't go behind the backstop and talk about this when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation against the two brethren these guys are pretty upset and this this wasn't an event that happened like three years before this time this was pretty recent stuff now nine of those 10 were there because judas had hanged himself right all these guys had walked with him they taught with him they performed preaching and miracles with him they witnessed so much but they were still human oh i want to sit on the right i want to sit on the left i i want some recognition here right mattias he was there in the upper room he wasn't one of the 12 but the bible tells us he was with them from the beginning thomas known as a doubter bit of a skeptic he was there the 11 disciples had ridiculed and dismissed the women's testimony of having seen him on easter morning those 11 were there and so were the women the very women were still in that room with them yet before the holy ghost fell before they had that power they were gathered in one mind and one accord waiting on a promise that they believed was gonna come and what happened suddenly unexpectedly they didn't know the moment it would happen suddenly there came a sound from heaven a rushing mighty wind it filled all the house where they were sitting the moving of the spirit the pneuma is the greek word it's the same word the atmosphere the spirit the air god is moving by his spirit and there appeared unto them what cloven tongue's like is a fire little little lamps right and it's sat on the 12th oh no it sat on the it sat on each of them they were in it together but it's an individual thing and they were all there together in all the people in that room 120 received the baptism of the holy spirit the infilling of the holy spirit the light of the world it and note these these these cloven tongues is it as i say part of the light of the world and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance how does that work the spirit the pneuma the moving of the atmosphere past vocal cords yielded to the holy spirit and that produced the utterance that produced the sounds that produced the words oh god that i could be yielded to him that we could all be so yielded to him that any sound that comes past us isn't just our lungs working but it's the moving of his spirit that animates that speaks that causes to be that expression that he wants to hear did they now have that dual nature yeah look at peter all of them after the crucifixion what do they do they hid acts 1 tells us that they continued to be together they were hiding together right and and it even tells us in acts 1 they were of one accord it's an expression of unity i think of that song i don't know why it comes to mind right now but but but it's from the bible in hebrew we learned it when we were in israel [Music] behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity and what happens jesus said appeared to them earlier and he told them ye shall receive power here's a promise here's a prophecy after that the holy ghost has come upon you power power for what purpose god's gone to a lot of effort jesus has paid a tremendous price for this purpose and what is that purpose why are you going to receive power for what to be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea samaria to the uttermost part of the earth why were they given this gift this indwelling of god himself to become bold witnesses of the gospel the good news last thursday i was privileged to hear my brother noel preach a midweek service to several churches in india he was at his home in north carolina but through the use of modern technology like pastor matt has been using to speak to us when he's in south carolina noel was able to minister in india and heather and i were able to be there too his topic was faith and i'm not going to give you the whole sermon the conclusion it's simply accepting the truth of god's word let's look at abraham genesis 15 and he abram believed in the lord and he god countered to abram for righteousness for meeting the requirements of a right relationship between them abraham was called the friend of god right a couple of chapters later when abram was 90 years old and nine that's even older appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god and he gave him a command walk before me and be thou perfect be perfect a simple sounding command how can anyone do that by faith believing god not not believing that there is a god but believe in god accepting what he says through faith comes obedience well brother i confess to you sometimes i'm not obedient well what happens then we're told in first john if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves truth is in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness what that leaves is righteousness that right relationship but but what does that mean faithful and just what does that mean well in the middle of the sermon on the mountain jesus told us matthew 6 9 after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation deliver us from evil thine is the kingdom the power the glory forever so be it amen there's something so important here that in the next verses jesus repeats it and emphasizes it what are we talking about forgiveness of sin right and he says if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you faithful and just but if you forgive not men their trespasses uh oh neither will your father forgive yours remember if you confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you of your sins but only if you forgive others of their sins against you whoa matthew tells us peter came to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him seven times that's pretty big of me right but at some point can i stop guy's a bully or he won't stop can i give him a lesson what did jesus say to him i say not unto thee seven times but 70 times seven you have to keep doing it and later later he doesn't say this but later just watch me on the cross i'll be asking forgiveness for the very ones torturing and abusing and killing me and you need to become like me peter the same nature it won't be easy but i'll be there to help and to comfort forgiving those that offend or hurt it's not easy it's not our human nature it's character building but it's absolutely necessary you can't squirm your way out of it there's another point about obedience recall recently we've had lessons about the atmosphere the atmosphere of god of the holy spirit brother peter brought us a message one wednesday night about i can't breathe right the atmosphere the spirit recall that in exodus they were leaving egypt for the promised land they followed moses who followed the light the pillar of fire right up to the border but what they saw on the other side of the border caused fear sin unbelief we can't possibly do this what did that fear lead to disobedience and wha how did what happened as a result of that it led to a detour a 40-year delay yet god's timing is perfect we saw in our little study of exodus and joseph the signs in the heavens that anchored him in time we know when this happened the natural typing the spiritual but what about that time of disobedience in the wilderness how to survive what appeared to be a sentence of certain death all their picnic baskets from egypt were empty you're going out into that desert there's a lot of you and there's nothing there to support you moses are you taking us out here to die a large group is not going to survive in that bleak inhospitable land i've i've seen some of the sinai um i'll tell you what you want to jump right back in your air-conditioned vehicle well what did the lord do they were disobedient he was upset he was angry but they were still his children so what did he do he took care of them their shoes didn't wear out i'd like a pair of shoes like that their clothes that ultraviolet sun and all that stuff beating on them but the clothes blasted everything right and he fed them manna where did it come from this man and this food they've never seen it came from the heavens right like dew they found that on the ground in the morning the heavens shamayim what is that the hebrew word is like the greek word pneuma it's the hebrew word for atmosphere type of the spirit look john 20 this is after the resurrection before the ascension when he had said this he was having a little chat with him he breathed on them and said unto them receive the holy ghost pneuma air breath spirit and in the desert where did they get the water from the rock the revelation of jesus christ right faith we have all we need in christ that's what sustained them in the wilderness even though they were disobedient even when i'm disobedient he still looks after me he still takes care of me because it may break our connection but i'm still his child you can't get warm by a painted fire we've heard that many times my brother my sister you must receive the holy spirit not think you have it not imitate it you have to receive it it's not it's not optional and you can't earn it there's nothing you can do to say to god i've done this give me the holy spirit it's a free gift and he offers it to you and he wants to give it to you don't make it complicated another instance here what this is much earlier in jesus ministry he's he's in his home district up in the the north of galilee there when jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us a son of david have mercy on us son of david have have mercy on us he just kept walking when he was coming to the house the blind men came to him he kept walking they kept following jesus said unto them believe ye that i'm able to do this they said unto him yay lord they're crying for mercy they're going to receive healing then he touched their eyes saying okay now based on your obedience no he didn't say that based on your good works your good intentions your hope your wish your desire your expression of need your financial support no no yes do you believe do you accept completely even if you understand incompletely that i can do this because i can't it won't happen unless you accept that i can so what did he say according to your faith be it unto you according to your faith they had faith before they had their healing they didn't get faith because they were healed right faith is a gift it's also a fruit in other words if it's a fruit it has life and it can grow in the right soil we heard about rocky soil this morning in good soil right it can grow in the right soil and the right atmosphere and reproduce itself right fruit has seeds and we eat fruit to live and to grow ephesians chapter 2 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it's a gift of god it's a gift you really don't have much to do with it what does galatians 5 tell us but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance the fruit of the spirit includes faith christianity we've heard it so many times and it is so true is relationship it's not religion though there are many religions that fall under the label of christianity just as there are similar parallel philosophies and so forth be a good person and it'll be okay fruit fruit that you bear fruit isn't what you do it's a seed it shows what you are note the list in galatians is singular it says the fruit is it doesn't say the fruits of the spirit are here's this list pick three it's one fruit that has all all of these attributes brother reg searled heather and i uh traveled to new zealand back just after we were first married our oldest son was was born over there and fortunately airplanes were still flying because he was 18 days old when we flew back from new zealand to tucson but brother reg searle when we were in new zealand he told us an apple tree does not struggle to bear apples it bears apples because it's an apple tree and being in new zealand of course he says a sheep doesn't struggle to bear wool it bears wool because it's a sheep the fruit you bear reveals the life that's in you john 15 herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue in my love if oh uh oh if if means there's a condition if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment okay here's the condition we have to fulfill love one another as i have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends and you're my friends if there's that conditional again this friendship there's a condition you can be friends with someone something happens your friendship stops you go from being best friends forever i don't like that person right but it can be restored and it often is you're my friends if you do whatsoever i command you henceforth jesus goes on i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i've called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you you have not chosen me peter you didn't come running from your boat and say hey get on my crew we're catching a lot of fish out here we need a little help no no no but i've chosen you and ordained you that you should go out and collect a big offering build a giant cathedral graduate from a well-regarded seminary wear special clothes to identify you no no i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain keep bearing it don't stop that whatsoever ye shall ask of my father my name he may give it you why because it will be me asking through you it won't be oh i'd like a new car i don't no no no no of course he doesn't answer those kinds of things because that's not his desire these things i command you here it is again it's simple that you love one another that's his commandment to us to love each other do we love each other do you love him jesus said in john 14 if you love me you say you love me here's how i'm going to test you keep my commandments that's how we demonstrate our love for him and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth which the world cannot receive why can't the world receive the spirit of truth the holy spirit because it seeth him not it doesn't understand him neither knoweth him there's no relationship but you know him for he dwelleth with you it's me jesus i'm talking to you i'm dwelling with you it's me and shall be in you the same spirit that will raise christ from the dead will dwell in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you he didn't say that i'm going to rescue you i'm going to comfort you when you go through tough times with someone you build bonds you build relationship it gets stronger and stronger and the tougher the times and the more difficult it is the stronger the bond the friendship the relationship grows my brother my sister the comforter means you can expect some trouble rejoice because that's going to drive you closer into his arms i think of that song i'm so thankful for the open arms of jesus i'm so glad that i can find my comfort there when the storm clouds gather over yonder i can find my shelter in the lord right where was i here i got i got off of this yet a little while the world sees me no more but you see me because i live you shall live also because my life will be in you and that day what day the day that you receive me as the comforter is the holy spirit and that day ye shall know because you'll experience it you shall know that i am in the father and you're in me and i'm in you we're all in this together with god he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is it loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him it's pretty important to keep that commandment and that commandment love it's relational you don't go in a corner someplace close the door say oh i'm in love with the world huh no love is relational heather and i have a relationship and it's growing i love her more now than i ever did and tomorrow i'll love her more than i love her today anybody that knows her can understand why so let me repeat christianity it's about relationship it's not religion and you want a little surprise so was judaism look matthew 22 master this fellow comes and asks him master what is the great commandment in the law jesus said wait i'll go check my concordance i've got to fire up my computer and do a word search on that no no jesus said unto him he didn't wait thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment but you know what he didn't stop there he went past what was asked because he wanted to get to the heart of the matter and he said the second it's just like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself on these two commandments not ten these two what are they love on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets all the law all the commandments the 613 regulations and whatever and so on and wearing that shawl with the little fringes and blowing the shofar and all of that all of the prophetic revelations all of the teachings a l l it all reduces down to loving god and loving your neighbor how how complicated is that now now consider something jesus gives us some illustrations here when he talks about judgment what happens if we don't enter into that relationship with him and forgiveness of our fellow man matthew 7 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven even though they recognize me as their lord but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven and we've just gone over that that's to love right many uh oh many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name of cast out devils and and in the name of many wonderful works they did good things they did wonderful things they helped people they did it all in the name of jesus what could be wrong with that then i will profess to them i never knew you depart for me that work iniquity work inequity what what went wrong they did not have a relationship with jesus i never knew you of course jesus knew of them but he didn't know them they had never been through hard times together there was no relationship there was no bond he was not intimate with them he was a tool in their toolbox not the love of their life brother branham talks about this when he talks about anointed ones at the end time look at their list of works and accomplishments that their fruit lord lord have not we prophesied in thy name and in thy name we have cast out devils and in thy name we have done many wonderful works it's all about them it wasn't what they did it was why they did it they did it for their own glory brother branham warns us about this and anointed ones at the end times and we're told if you try to evaluate whether or not you should do something told to check your motive and check your objective it's not what it's why okay closing out the musicians would would please come here's another story of judgment then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world you're finally here i knew you were coming i'm so glad you've got here i've been busy getting things ready for your arrival look look look brother there's your name tag on the door i'm so glad you're here now and and you were so nice to me do you remember when i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger you took me in i was naked but you clothed me i was sick you visited me i was in prison yeah yeah you you came to me and what's their reaction they weren't out self-promoting they weren't self-righteous then so the righteous answer him saying yeah yeah we did all that in the name of jesus no no no they're puzzled they're puzzled they say lord when did we did you did you when did we see you hungry and fed you were thirsty and gave you a drinker when did we see you a stranger took you in or naked and clothed you or when did we see you sick or in prison and come unto you none of us remember anything like that do you remember do you remember no i i don't remember either and the king shall answer and say unto them calm down it's okay verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these the least of my brethren you've done it unto me because a part of me lives in each of them and in you we have to be careful how we treat one another and i don't just mean here in church i mean our fellow human beings here on spaceship earth our final verses for this evening in hebrews paul admonishes us let brotherly love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares that guy in the street corner he might be one of those dirty twenty dollar bills it's all about that fruit how useful is fruit that rots on the branch of the vine or the tree bearing fruits necessary bearing fruits important and bearing food is inevitable if you have any life but it has to be harvested to be useful it has to be eaten it has to be consumed to give strength and satisfy hunger the lamp it has to be lit it has to be placed where it's light can be seen otherwise it might as well be made of plastic or wax or something it's just to be viewed admired commented on look at that perfect piece of fruit yeah it's wax have you ever been to costco or sam's club there is at least there was often a kiosk with someone handing out a taste right of a small free sample of some food or drink no charge you're encouraged partake and if you like it we've got shelves full of it here to sell to you right so my question tonight if someone takes a free sample of the fruit that you're bearing or the fruit that i'm bearing they come and take that free sample are they going to want to go to the shelf and load up on it are our lamps lit and burning bright there's a lot more we could say but i've kept it long enough i uh i wonder if we could just pray for a moment and then sing a song and then turn the service over to our pastor just join me in prayer for a moment lord jesus these words tonight lord somehow i believe that you were speaking to some of us lord i believe you were speaking to me lord i just pray that you help us each one lord to recognize that our worth our value is established by you it's not what we see it's not what we think about ourselves it's what you see in us it's what you've placed in us lord help us to manifest that to to water it that it can grow lord help us to bear fruit for you help our lights to shine lord keep our lamps filled with that oil and keep them burning brightly lord we just we just thank you for your word we thank you for everyone that's gathered here this evening and we just pray lord that you'd accept our prayers that you'd accept our praise lord as we as we worship you together we ask this in jesus name and if if we could sing flow through me holy spirit flow through me holy spirit flow through me [Music] my hands to worship and to magnify thy name flow through holy [Music] spirit spirit flow through me holy spirit flow through me lift your hands now as i lift my hands [Music] holy spirit flow can you sing this live through me sing it now oh live through me holy spirit live through me [Applause] live through me holy spirit yes lord as i lift my hands in worship and [Music] how about love through me love through me holy spirit this is your prayer love through me holy spirit love through me i want your love love through me holy spirit as i lift my hands in worship and to magnify thy name love through me holy spirit amen do we sing that song i lift your name your holy name jehovah god we've seen that lord my heart can grow so far away do you appreciate the word of god that was so good let's give the lord a handclap of praise hallelujah thank you jesus [Applause] my that was so much said i just i can't imagine a lie you said you had a couple days to prepare for that my you should start only preparing two days from now on that was so good oh man i i just so much that he said uh that i wish i would have written down things to comment on but it's amazing because i just studied not ever knowing what the jewish new year was i just studied on that uh the day before yesterday and about the shofar and the blowing of the trumpets and how that it's the feast of the trumpets i just when i seen this i got to the platform and seen this i said i think i know where he's going but it was so good you know because that that even that i was reading about that i forget what you called it brother what they call it brother where they take the bread and they stand by the water and they throw it on the on the water as a removal of sins and and you know how that he would he read the scripture and micah where they based that off of that he would cast it well the bible says he cast our sin into the sea of his forgetfulness and he put a sign there that said no fishing [Laughter] amen i'm glad that when the lord doesn't just forgive we forgive but the lord forgives and he forgets amen and he is the light of the world mine so much said there you know but the law would have never thought of that my mind not being your scientific mind uh never never seen that so beautiful how that light is in two parts it's photons it's particles and it's waves and how that jesus could have two natures and you know it people preaching you know they've they preached you know doctrines and have been not according to the word on two souls and you know how many souls do we have the soul but it's real simple when you look at jesus because see we're a type we're going to be in his very image we were created in his image that we could be a hundred percent flesh and yet we could have that eternal god living down inside of us and brother adam said even if you just he said you know he said we we may just be a portion he was the fullness the bible says in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead in a body bodily and brother branham says but you know if you take just a teaspoon of the ocean and he said you just take a little teaspoon he said yet within that little teaspoon i've got every element that's in all that big old seed and he said when you received the baptism of the holy ghost he said what are you receiving a down payment a down payment you know what that means if he's going to make a down payment the rest is coming the rest is on its way that's why he quoted uh genesis 17 uh abraham walk before me and be thou perfect you know what i see there god would have never asked abraham to to be perfect unless god knew it was possible you ever thought of that that the bible says he was 99 years old you know he was 90 here he spent i just thought that's not an accident that he's 99 years old it's he's 99 gone 99 when you're 99 and it looks like all hope is lost 99 god shows up on the scene and says walk before me and be thou perfect gives him a promise hallelujah and when we think it's all over and it's hopeless 99 gone and the lord shows up just on time every time amen i want to say tonight lord let my as jesus said let your light so shine before men that they see your good works and they glorify your father say lord let my light so shine let my life so shine amen in this dark and dying world praise the lord amen i want to sing this before we go we're going to let you be dismissed amen just want you to ponder and think on that i believe it was for somebody believe it was for me amenably the lord found its mark tonight lord lord my heart can grow [Music] think about this and yet for me your love is still the same [Music] of my head bows down in reference to your name [Music] i lived your name your holy name [Music] jehovah [Music] [Applause] the great i am yes the reason my comforter and king raise your hands now oh i live your name hallelujah your holy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] your might come and king do we have a verse now lord my heart's desire is to be to be filled with spirit fire my purpose is to worship you alone is that your purpose tonight open up and so open up my soul [Music] to worship and i lived your name oh your holy name jehovah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i am you're the reason my comforter one more time before we go now like a prayer to the lord i lift your name i lived your name your holy name [Music] the great [Music] lord take us tonight as we worship you lord we conclude this day this sunday it's been wonderful lord to be in your house it's been wonderful lord i just

and that's our desire father to let to allow to give way to give place for your spirit lord to to not lord just sprinkle us but to engulf us lord to fill our very being as our brother lyle said that let that oil of the holy spirit let it burn in me lord let it burn bright don't let my light go out jesus but let the oil of the holy ghost be renewed day by day i pray god that you would just let this word sink let it find its place don't let it be like that that fell on stony ground that lord didn't have a root and when the sun was come up it was scorched lord but let it find good ground tonight can bring forth real fruit real love lord that agapo love lord for that's what you desire out of your children let it be to us god we ask in jesus name amen friends you're dismissed we'll see
