[16:10] Welcome visitors. Billy, it's good to
[16:13] see you. This is Josiah's brother here,
[16:15] Billy. Ao, God bless you, my
[16:21] friend. Yeah, you have a you have a song
[16:24] for us a little bit later. Excellent.
[16:26] Praise God. Very, very talented family.
[16:29] Welcome to all the other visitors.
[16:32] Welcome. God bless you. It's good. It's
[16:34] good to have you in service.
[16:37] We pray
[16:39] that after we leave today, we could say
[16:43] that didn't not our hearts burn within
[16:45] us as he spoke with us. By the
[16:49] way, Connie back there, my friend, God
[16:52] bless you. Connie Williams, it's good
[16:54] good to see you. Ki Fuji again staying
[16:57] with with us from Japan. God bless you.
[17:01] Sister
[17:02] Amelia has a prayer request here. It
[17:05] says, "Please keep me in your prayers. I
[17:08] don't feel well." Sister Millia is a
[17:11] widow, someone that relies on prayer. So
[17:16] many times we can rely on ourselves and
[17:18] we can rely on the doctors and
[17:21] and but seems that God has a special
[17:25] place in his heart for the
[17:27] widows because they rely so much on the
[17:32] Lord Jesus. They rely so much on him.
[17:35] And I think that he likes it that
[17:38] way. All of us should rely on him more.
[17:42] And I'll tell you, the Bible says, "Ask
[17:46] abundantly." And we can't ask, I don't
[17:49] think too much. He's there willing to
[17:51] give to us. He He'll give to us in his
[17:53] own time. He'll give us what we need and
[17:55] what's right. But don't be afraid to
[17:59] ask. Brothers, if you could come for the
[18:01] offering, let's all bow our heads.
[18:04] our heavenly
[18:07] father, Lord, to sing your goodness and
[18:10] to sing your praise. We are we're so
[18:12] thankful that Lord that you placed us on
[18:15] us on this earth and that you have
[18:17] showed us that there is a God that hears
[18:20] prayers. There is a God that answers
[18:23] prayers. There is a God that's alive
[18:26] today. And Lord, we thank you that we
[18:28] have been introduced to this God. And we
[18:30] want to know you more, Lord.
[18:33] We want to get to know you. And Lord,
[18:35] the best way that best ways that we know
[18:38] is to come here and to sing songs of
[18:40] praise and to learn of your
[18:44] word. And Lord, we lift up Sister
[18:46] Ameilia before you in prayer and ask
[18:49] that you would heal her. And Father, if
[18:53] there would be
[18:54] any in the
[18:57] congregation right now that would have a
[18:59] request or those that are maybe
[19:01] streaming in online that would have a
[19:04] request for
[19:07] you, Father, with our hands, we would
[19:09] raise them and say, "Lord, remember me
[19:13] for I have a need."
[19:16] Lord, the hands that are raised, I pray
[19:18] that each one would receive what they
[19:21] have have a need
[19:22] of. Lord, that as we pass the offering
[19:27] bags around that that Father, that you
[19:30] would bless the
[19:32] giver, all those that make sacrifices,
[19:35] Father, that you would return what they
[19:38] have given many times
[19:40] over. And Father, that you would bless
[19:42] the offering and that it it might go to
[19:45] the the very
[19:46] best ways to serve your children here,
[19:51] your people here at the Tucson
[19:53] Tabernacle. In Jesus Christ's name we
[19:55] pray.
[20:02] Amen. May be
[20:05] seated. If Brother Billy would come and
[20:07] make ready for his song special. Amen.

[22:04] forgive and I have a
[22:07] [Music]
[22:09] future and it's worth the

[33:31] of. This young man that's going to be
[33:34] preaching. Many of you know him. He's
[33:37] spoken here before. He's one of the
[33:40] finest young men that I
[33:43] know. He uh the first time I heard him
[33:46] preach, he was, I think, 21 years
[33:50] old.
[33:51] And I saw a gift in his life. even even
[33:56] just at that
[33:58] age. And I knew that one day our paths
[34:02] would cross
[34:03] again. And now it's an
[34:06] honor to have our brother Eleazar
[34:10] Castillo to come and minister for us

[34:53] And all my
[34:56] [Music]
[34:57] soul
[34:59] needs is all your
[35:03] love to cover me.
[35:07] So all the
[35:11] world will
[35:13] see that I have
[35:18] nothing without you. Sing the chorus one
[35:22] more time.
[35:24] And all my
[35:27] [Music]
[35:29] soul
[35:30] needs is all your love. Amen. to cover
[35:37] me. So all the
[35:42] world will
[35:44] see that I am
[35:49] nothing without
[35:51] [Music]
[35:53] you. Amen.
[35:56] I think that's the testimony of a
[35:59] Christian that there's nothing in
[36:02] us whenever I get get involved with
[36:07] God's
[36:08] work then everything is going to mess up
[36:11] everything I'm going to find myself in
[36:13] the ditch again. But whenever you
[36:16] realize that when you allow God to take
[36:19] control of your life and you say Lord I
[36:22] have nothing. Maybe I have a good uh
[36:25] voice to sing. Maybe maybe I I can do
[36:29] this. Maybe I have this gift. But Lord,
[36:31] I have nothing without you, Lord. And
[36:34] when we allow God to enter in, enter
[36:37] every faculty of our life, our mind, our
[36:40] spirit, our soul. Just watch the
[36:43] miracles in your life. Watch something
[36:45] happen in your life. And I truly believe
[36:47] that's what's happening in our lives.
[36:51] Um let us uh go straight to the
[36:54] scriptures. If you'd like to turn with
[36:55] me to Romans
[36:58] 2
[37:00] vers we'll start
[37:04] with verse
[37:09] 14 and we'll read all the way to 16. Um
[37:13] I just want to thank brother Daniel
[37:16] Evans allowing me to be here. Um I I
[37:19] know familiar faces, really good
[37:22] brothers that I've met over the time
[37:24] coming here, brothers and sisters. And
[37:27] um it's just so good to see um I can
[37:29] honestly say friends in the gospel and
[37:32] brothers and sisters. And then all the
[37:34] new um faces that I see. God bless you.
[37:37] Um it's an honor to be here and um I'm
[37:40] just so thankful to be here and just to
[37:42] worship and to give God all the honor
[37:44] and glory with you.
[37:48] Acts 24 or I mean
[37:51] uh Romans
[37:54] 2:14 says, "For when the Gentiles which
[37:58] have not the law do by nature the things
[38:01] contained in the law, these things
[38:04] having not the law are a law unto
[38:07] themselves." Now, the King James
[38:09] version, it's it's kind of confusing
[38:10] what he's saying here.
[38:13] He's saying that the Gentiles, of
[38:15] course, who who did God give the law to?
[38:17] It was the Jews, right? So now he's
[38:20] talking about anybody that's not a Jew
[38:22] is a Gentile. And he's saying that these
[38:25] Gentiles that are not Jews that weren't
[38:27] there on Mount Si, they didn't have the
[38:31] law. But not having the law, they still
[38:34] had a law or the law within themselves,
[38:38] and they worked according to that.
[38:41] That's pretty amazing that people that
[38:44] never know the gospel, people that never
[38:47] know the law within themselves have
[38:51] something to govern them right and
[38:53] wrong.
[38:55] Right.
[38:57] 15 it says, "Which show the work of the
[39:02] law written in their hearts, their
[39:04] conscience also bearing witness, and
[39:07] their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or
[39:10] else excusing one
[39:12] another in the day when God shall judge
[39:14] the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
[39:17] according to my gospel." Let us bow our
[39:20] heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're just
[39:23] so thankful that you've allowed us to be
[39:25] here. Um Lord, I I know each and every
[39:28] person here has burdens, struggles, and
[39:32] trials, and temptations. But Lord, we
[39:35] set them all aside just to be here
[39:38] congregated together in one place, in
[39:40] one accord. Father, that we may not only
[39:43] feel your presence, but hear from you,
[39:46] Lord. that we can leave here not just
[39:48] feeling a sensation but feeling that our
[39:51] faith has been strengthened that we have
[39:54] a clearer understanding of who you are
[39:56] and what you feel about us Lord what you
[39:59] think about us Lord I just ask that you
[40:02] touch each and every person
[40:04] here let your holy spirit have the
[40:06] preeminence in this place we thank you
[40:08] Lord the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:10] we pray amen and amen you may be seated
[40:15] did.
[40:17] Um, for for the past, I believe like two
[40:21] two years, I've just had it in my heart.
[40:23] I believe this is just the Lord kind of
[40:25] guiding me. Um, and that's I believe
[40:29] that's God's will is understanding
[40:32] what's inside of us and understanding
[40:35] that that our flesh is powerless without
[40:40] the control tower inside of our soul.
[40:44] that that before anything can be fixed
[40:46] within our lives, something has to
[40:48] happen within our souls. And we've seen
[40:50] it in the scriptures how how the most
[40:53] important thing is not your outward
[40:56] appearance or anything like that, but
[40:57] it's what's in here. And I I truly
[41:00] believe that's what God or Jesus
[41:02] Christ's ministry was when he came to
[41:04] the earth because his first doctrine was
[41:08] ye must be born again.
[41:11] Because these Jews, all they knew how to
[41:14] be perfect on the outside, how to fix
[41:17] this. Whenever there's a leak in your
[41:19] life, you you try to patch it up right
[41:21] away. And I believe the whole world is
[41:23] in that constant cycle of trying to be a
[41:27] good person, trying to do the right
[41:29] thing. And God, he comes in Jesus Christ
[41:33] and he says, "No, the problem is not the
[41:36] outside.
[41:37] You must be born again." I think that
[41:41] shows what what's wrong with our society
[41:44] today. Now, I'm not into politics, but I
[41:47] I know my my buddy once asked me. He
[41:49] said, "What if what um what would you do
[41:53] if you could do anything in this world?
[41:55] What would you um solve the world hunger
[41:58] or give world peace or do all these
[42:00] things?" He said, "Would you fix the
[42:02] parks or would you take away guns?" And
[42:05] you know, he's just asking me all of
[42:06] these things. And I said, 'Before you
[42:08] can solve hunger, before you can solve
[42:11] world peace, it's it's not taking things
[42:13] away or or uh giving more police
[42:16] officers, but it's changing the heart of
[42:19] the people. Because it doesn't matter
[42:22] what you take away or what you give. If
[42:24] if the heart and the mind are still
[42:27] neurotic go going crazy I in in
[42:32] um thing seeing things that they're not
[42:34] supposed to and and and indulging in
[42:36] those things. It's doesn't matter what
[42:39] we take away or what we give. That's why
[42:42] Jesus says you must be born again. I
[42:46] believe that's what's going to solve
[42:48] everything is a changed heart. And so,
[42:52] um, in thinking of all of these things,
[42:54] um, that's what I kind of want to get
[42:56] into is what what is going within us.
[42:59] What's going on within us? Uh, my title
[43:02] today
[43:02] is imperfect judge. And, uh, I would
[43:07] like to go straight to Acts just to
[43:10] start. Acts
[43:13] 24:16.
[43:16] Here, here is um a picture of the
[43:19] Apostle
[43:22] Paul being judged in front of uh Felix.
[43:28] He he's this great man and and uh the
[43:31] Jews, they've brought him to accuse him
[43:34] of all the wrongdoings that he was
[43:37] doing,
[43:38] but they were false accusing him. They
[43:41] were saying that he was trying to rise
[43:42] up people and and trying to disturb
[43:45] these people and and all of these
[43:46] things. And finally, it's Paul's time to
[43:49] speak. And he starts speaking to Felix
[43:53] and and he says, "All the things that
[43:55] these people are accusing me of, they're
[43:58] not true. They they can't find any
[44:00] evidence of it." He said, "But there's
[44:02] one thing that I do confess that these
[44:05] people are saying right about me. that
[44:07] that the God that I
[44:09] serve, the the that you want to call
[44:13] heresy, that's the way I serve my God.
[44:16] Meaning a crazy person, a holy roller.
[44:18] You know, whenever you truly give your
[44:20] heart to the Lord, it it has nothing to
[44:23] do with religion. It has nothing to do
[44:25] with church. Church is part of it. It's
[44:27] an extension of it. But whenever you
[44:30] truly give your heart to the Lord, oh
[44:32] brother, at at church, all the way to
[44:35] school, to work, at the home life, you
[44:39] are that person.
[44:41] You become that person. That same person
[44:43] that claps their hand here, the one that
[44:46] says amen here, the one that maybe sings
[44:48] and shouts and dances here, is the same
[44:51] one out there.
[44:53] And and and Paul says that same person,
[44:56] I do confess, I am that holy roller. I
[44:59] am that person. And then in in uh verse
[45:02] 16, he
[45:04] says, "Herein I do exercise myself."
[45:08] Now, think about it. He's being
[45:10] accused. He's he's trying to he's being
[45:13] tried as a guilty
[45:15] person. And here he he shows what's in
[45:19] his heart. He says, "Herein I do or
[45:22] herein do I exercise myself to have
[45:26] always a conscience void of offense
[45:28] toward God and toward
[45:32] men." And I truly believe that that's
[45:36] the story of a Christian that no matter
[45:38] what's accused of you or no matter
[45:40] what's going on in your life, if your
[45:43] conscience is clear,
[45:46] let all hell come. That's right. Let
[45:48] everything, let anybody accuse you. Let
[45:50] things come h happen in your life. It
[45:53] doesn't matter. Why? Because your
[45:55] conscience, something within you is void
[45:59] of all offense.
[46:02] Doesn't that feel good? Whenever your
[46:04] your conscience is clear, whenever God
[46:08] can back you up and you can say, "Lord,
[46:10] I've done everything I needed to do. I I
[46:13] I've made everything right."
[46:16] And that's what I want to talk about our
[46:17] conscience within us. I think it's it's
[46:20] a a powerful reminder that this thing
[46:23] that Paul says, it's a powerful reminder
[46:25] that that a clear conscience isn't
[46:29] accidental. That you don't wake up with
[46:31] a clear conscience. It requires a
[46:33] conscience daily effort. He says, "I do
[46:37] exercise."
[46:39] You you want to be fit, you got to
[46:41] exercise every day. In order to have a
[46:44] clear conscience in order to go to sleep
[46:47] with with with uh peace in your heart,
[46:49] you have to exercise
[46:52] to be void of offense of all men and
[46:56] toward God.
[46:58] I believe a clear cons conscience
[47:00] involves being honest with yourself
[47:03] before
[47:05] God that that you have to own your
[47:07] mistakes, making things right with
[47:10] others and aligning your actions with
[47:12] your
[47:14] beliefs. It's not about being perfect.
[47:16] This is not uh
[47:18] legalism. It's not being about perfect.
[47:21] It's about the heart always staying
[47:23] sensitive to conviction and correction.
[47:26] always allow your heart to to be
[47:28] sensitive to those things to know what's
[47:31] right and what's wrong and to go into
[47:34] that path.
[47:38] I I I truly believe that's what needs to
[47:41] happen when we say Lord I want to be
[47:44] clear of my conscience.
[47:46] this kind of living. It takes a
[47:48] self-awareness of our life to be willing
[47:51] to be constantly checked to have our
[47:54] motives and our behaviors checked every
[47:57] day. Now, now I love the word motive
[48:00] because you can't see a motive. You
[48:03] can't see all you can see is the action
[48:05] behind it. And a lot of times you can
[48:08] have the wrong motive and do the right
[48:10] thing.
[48:12] That's called ulterior motives. That's
[48:15] called an axe to grind or a trump up
[48:17] your sleeve. Right? Whenever you you
[48:20] you're doing something right, but in
[48:23] your heart is wrong.
[48:25] So, so your motives and your behavior,
[48:28] it has to be right.
[48:30] It has to be checked every single time.
[48:33] Why am I coming to church? That's a
[48:35] that's a simple one, right? You you
[48:37] start looking, examining yourself and
[48:40] say, Lord, why do I come to church?
[48:42] Well, I've been doing it for 30 years. I
[48:45] really don't want to. I don't really
[48:47] listen to the preacher. I don't really
[48:48] sing. I don't but it's Sunday. This is
[48:51] what I got to do. We start checking our
[48:54] motives. What What is your desires? We
[48:57] start doing all those things. That's I
[48:59] truly believe that's what a what
[49:02] involves of a clear conscience.
[49:05] Now, I believe that our our conscience
[49:07] is the most powerful and unavoidable
[49:10] witness that we're born
[49:12] with. It sees everything we do and it
[49:15] cannot be
[49:16] fooled. Unlike others, it knows our true
[49:19] motives and it holds us accountable
[49:22] within. You can have a straight face,
[49:25] but the conscience will always tell you
[49:27] if you're right or you're
[49:29] wrong. When violated, it becomes a
[49:31] relentless accuser.
[49:34] There's no courtroom, no defense
[49:36] attorney, no public opinion that can
[49:39] overrule what a conscience knows deep
[49:43] within. It doesn't matter if you're
[49:45] found innocent. What does your
[49:47] conscience
[49:48] say? The only thing that can truly judge
[49:53] is your conscience.
[49:56] That's why Paul, he he says that he
[49:59] emphasizes living with a conscience void
[50:02] of offense because there's no voice
[50:05] louder and more truthful than what's
[50:08] inside of us. Um, I was talking to
[50:11] brother Daniel in the back how in the
[50:13] beginning that's we see the beginning of
[50:16] our conscience with Adam and Eve. You
[50:20] have to think about it. Um, we're born
[50:22] with sin. We're we're born and uh wired
[50:26] to lie.
[50:28] That that's just part of survival. We
[50:30] lie, we steal, we do all those things
[50:32] and then we're we're trained up not to
[50:34] do those things, right? Adam and Eve,
[50:37] they weren't they were perfect. There
[50:41] was no such thing a as as shame there.
[50:45] There was no such thing as as feeling
[50:47] guilty there. There was there was no
[50:49] reason. It was perfection.
[50:52] They were in perfect unity with
[50:55] God. But yet the first time the Bible
[50:58] says whenever they they sinned, they did
[51:01] what they did, their eyes were open to
[51:03] their
[51:04] nakedness. And when they their eyes were
[51:07] open to their nakedness, shame filled
[51:10] their
[51:11] hearts. They had to do something. They
[51:14] began to cover themselves. That was the
[51:16] first time conscience was activated.
[51:20] the first time shame and guilt and and
[51:23] remorse happened whenever they came. Now
[51:26] think about it. We've lived with it our
[51:28] whole life. When we do something wrong,
[51:30] it doesn't feel good. But imagine
[51:33] somebody perfect with all of the guilt
[51:36] and shame rushing over their being. It
[51:40] must have been horrible. It must have
[51:42] been a a horrible thing. And and um
[51:44] their innocence were was gone.
[51:48] First time they feel
[51:50] shame means that there was a disturbance
[51:53] in the
[51:54] conscience. Here here in uh Genesis 3:8
[51:58] it shows that they hid from God showing
[52:00] that there was a sense of guilt and a
[52:02] fear of judgment. This is not a just a
[52:05] mere uh fear of judgment but it's a deep
[52:09] internal recognition that something's
[52:11] wrong. Their conscience was
[52:14] awakened and that's that's where it
[52:16] started. And now every single person is
[52:20] born with this gift. It's not a curse.
[52:24] It's not it's not something bad. It's a
[52:27] gift. And now we are all born with this
[52:31] gift. We come here, we start off with a
[52:34] fallen nature. We lie. We we hate. We
[52:37] steal. We do so much more. But then we
[52:40] have something within us that cries out
[52:42] and tells us when we're doing something
[52:44] wrong.
[52:46] I I believe that that's an amazing
[52:48] thing. The Bible says even the Gentiles
[52:53] without having the word, without having
[52:56] the law, they already had something a
[52:59] law within themselves crying out that
[53:02] there is a
[53:05] God. Billy Graham, uh, brother Billy
[53:08] Graham once said that our conscience is
[53:10] one of the greatest proofs that there is
[53:12] a God.
[53:14] I want to reread Romans 2:14 in the uh
[53:18] New Living Translation. It says just so
[53:20] that we can understand this scripture.
[53:23] It says even the even Gentiles who do
[53:26] not have God written God's written law
[53:30] show that they know his law when they
[53:32] instinctively obey it even without even
[53:36] without having heard it by by they
[53:40] demonstrate that God's law is written in
[53:42] their hearts for their own conscience
[53:45] either accuse them or tell them that
[53:48] they're doing right.
[53:50] So your your conscience is your accuser
[53:52] or your
[53:54] excuser. Your conscience is going to
[53:56] tell you, "Hey, you're doing all right."
[53:59] Or it's going to tell you, "Hey, you're
[54:00] going the wrong path." It's going to be
[54:03] your conscience. You you you don't need,
[54:06] if I'm going to say it this way, or or
[54:09] or you don't need to see the word in
[54:12] order to know
[54:13] that killing is wrong, right?
[54:16] that lying is wrong, that doing those
[54:19] things behind people's back is wrong.
[54:22] You don't need you don't need the word.
[54:24] You don't need the law. There's already
[54:26] a law written in your hearts. It's
[54:27] called your
[54:28] conscience. And it's either going to
[54:30] excuse you or accuse you of what you're
[54:35] doing. And and that's how God created
[54:38] us. We we are all created with a
[54:41] conscience. We're all man is a seed.
[54:44] Brother Brandham said first on the
[54:47] outside we have our body right which is
[54:50] composed of the five senses or see taste
[54:52] feel smell and hear. Then the inside of
[54:55] that body is the spirit man which also
[54:58] have the five inlets your your memory
[55:00] your conscience your reasoning
[55:03] imagination and affection. Every single
[55:06] person has these things. Then in the
[55:08] central realm of a man is the soul which
[55:10] is the innermost being of the man. Your
[55:14] soul only has the two faculties. It's
[55:16] either faith or doubt or God or Satan.
[55:20] It's only going to be two things. But
[55:22] within your spirit, God implanted in
[55:25] every single person a conscience
[55:28] so that we know what's right and what's
[55:33] wrong. Here, um, Brother Brandham, he
[55:36] preaches a message called He Careth for
[55:38] you. And he says, "This leads to eternal
[55:42] life." A man is made so that he could
[55:45] want the comforter. Now what's the
[55:47] comforter? That's the Holy Spirit.
[55:49] That's God's own
[55:50] life. So the way you were made with your
[55:53] five senses with your your five finger
[55:55] or your 10 fingers, your 10 toes, your
[55:57] two eyes and your the feelings within
[56:00] you and the soul that's within you.
[56:02] Everything that is consist you consist
[56:05] of was made so that you can desire
[56:09] something greater. Not not so that you
[56:12] can govern yourself with these things,
[56:14] but these things should lead you to the
[56:17] Holy Spirit.
[56:19] So man was made so that he can want the
[56:21] comforter. He's wanting a comforter
[56:23] because he was made that way. That's the
[56:26] way God put him together. Built rooms in
[56:29] him. his soul, his conscience, his
[56:31] sight, his senses, everything was put
[56:33] together in in in this little room of
[56:36] something to make him happy, to give him
[56:39] consolation, to take weary and
[56:41] nervousness from him. God sat there with
[56:44] the Holy Spirit. Oh, what a truth. What
[56:47] a picture.
[56:49] So God, he created you so that you could
[56:53] have somebody start working in your
[56:56] conscience, start working in your
[56:58] imagination, working in your own flesh.
[57:01] That's what makes you clap your hands.
[57:03] That's what makes you walk to your
[57:05] neighbor and testify that there is a
[57:07] Christ. Why? There's a Holy Spirit in
[57:10] you causing your body to move. Causing
[57:13] your heart to have grief for somebody
[57:15] else. It's causing your conscience to
[57:18] either accuse you or excuse you. It's
[57:22] the Holy
[57:23] Spirit. So it put us to want
[57:27] it. So then this is not to take place of
[57:32] the comforter. Your conscience is not
[57:34] made to to just so that you can become a
[57:37] good
[57:39] person. Brother Barham, he says a
[57:41] message, a really good message. It's
[57:43] called the impersonation of
[57:44] Christianity. sounds worse than what it
[57:47] what he really says, but but if we don't
[57:50] have the Holy Spirit, we impersonate
[57:52] automatically. It's not that you
[57:54] intentionally impersonate, but whenever
[57:57] we're we're living another life and we
[57:59] come to church and and we just don't
[58:01] want to completely submit to the Lord,
[58:04] there's an impersonation already taking
[58:06] place.
[58:08] But he says here, he says that your own
[58:10] conscience
[58:12] um your own conscience to shun you from
[58:14] hell would try to make you or would shun
[58:17] you from hell rather would make you live
[58:19] to be good and right. A good citizen
[58:22] will do that. Not necessarily be a
[58:25] Christian. So your own conscience
[58:27] without God, without the the Holy
[58:30] Spirit, it will make you want to live
[58:33] right.
[58:34] You will think about hell or you'll
[58:36] think about a judgment or you'll think
[58:38] about the laws in the land and you'll
[58:40] say, "Hey, I'm going to be an upstanding
[58:42] citizen." Your conscience will do that
[58:44] for you without God. It'll make you be a
[58:48] good
[58:49] person. He He says he says, "I've seen
[58:53] many men who have denied the name of the
[58:55] Lord Jesus Christ who were fine people."
[58:58] That means humanly. I'm sure we we can
[59:01] point at somebody that maybe is even
[59:04] better than
[59:06] us, that acts better than us sometimes,
[59:10] yet they don't even serve the Lord. They
[59:13] don't even want nothing to do with it.
[59:15] What is it? It's their conscience
[59:17] governing governing them, telling them,
[59:19] "Hey, I've got to be a good person. Hey,
[59:22] I I don't want to speed. Hey, I I don't
[59:24] want to I don't want to break the laws."
[59:26] That's your conscience talking to you.
[59:28] Yet you can be without the Lord Jesus
[59:31] Christ. So it's showing you that that
[59:33] God made you to want his Holy Spirit.
[59:36] Amen. That your conscience cannot just
[59:39] act on its own because then it's going
[59:42] to think that it's
[59:44] right. That your your imaginations,
[59:47] you're going to think that you're right.
[59:48] When you don't have the Lord Jesus
[59:50] Christ, you need the Holy Spirit to
[59:52] guide. Amen.
[59:55] So, it's this conscience though it's
[59:59] good and it's God-given, it's not a
[1:00:01] perfect guide.
[1:00:04] It it's like if it's like an empty
[1:00:07] room. It's vital, but it's in it's not
[1:00:11] infallible. It's like an empty room with
[1:00:13] a microphone amplifying whatever values
[1:00:17] have been fed into
[1:00:19] it. If if trained by truth, especially
[1:00:22] God's word, it can lead to your wisdom,
[1:00:24] peace, integrity. But if it's neglected
[1:00:27] and misinformed, it can falsely accuse
[1:00:30] or wrongly excuse you. That's why we
[1:00:33] must be intentional with about educating
[1:00:36] our
[1:00:37] conscience with God's truth.
[1:00:40] That's why we we can say, "Oh, well,
[1:00:42] this is right and this is wrong." Yet
[1:00:44] it's outside of God's
[1:00:46] word. Yet it's going to lead you to a
[1:00:48] path of destruction because you have
[1:00:51] misinformed it. You have trained it. You
[1:00:54] have educated to show, oh yeah, this is
[1:00:56] right and this is wrong. So this is not
[1:00:58] a perfect this is an imperfect
[1:01:01] judge where where it will allow you to
[1:01:04] do certain things if you continue to
[1:01:06] allow it to break those barriers because
[1:01:09] it'll come with barriers. The Bible says
[1:01:12] it comes with the
[1:01:14] law. You're you come with a law in your
[1:01:17] heart. And if you just continue break
[1:01:20] those barriers and break those barriers,
[1:01:23] soon enough you'll think that stealing,
[1:01:26] lying, doing all those things is right.
[1:01:29] It's
[1:01:32] justifiable. It's God-given, but it's
[1:01:34] not
[1:01:35] perfect. It will only reflect what it's
[1:01:38] taught.
[1:01:41] So a well-trained conscience becomes a
[1:01:44] reliable
[1:01:45] guide. Misinformed, it can only lead us
[1:01:48] astray. So there there we the more we
[1:01:51] align our minds with the scripture, the
[1:01:54] more the conscience becomes a faithful
[1:01:56] voice of truth. I I remember brother Bam
[1:02:00] says we cannot alter God's word to our
[1:02:02] thinking. We have to alter our thinking
[1:02:05] to his thinking.
[1:02:07] We have to alter our bodies to him
[1:02:11] because then then when it we we we begin
[1:02:14] to alter our thinking to his word then
[1:02:18] your conscience it becomes a reliable
[1:02:20] friend. It becomes a a righteous man's
[1:02:25] character because every you can
[1:02:28] faithfully trust every time the
[1:02:31] sensitivity of the Holy Spirit says nope
[1:02:33] don't do that.
[1:02:35] Hey you said this wrong. You need to
[1:02:37] make it right.
[1:02:39] Hey, you offended that person. Hey, you
[1:02:43] lied whenever you said this. And we
[1:02:45] could be like, oh man, I got to make it
[1:02:48] right. And the thing is, your conscience
[1:02:51] is not going to let you go. Everybody
[1:02:53] can be like, ah, it was fine. We
[1:02:55] understood what you meant. It's okay.
[1:02:57] Conscious be like, you're wrong.
[1:03:00] You're wrong. You're wrong. No, no, no.
[1:03:02] Everything's good. Doesn't matter. This
[1:03:05] judge says you're wrong.
[1:03:07] Until you make it right, then you're in
[1:03:10] the clear. You don't need nobody to
[1:03:13] judge you. You have a judge inside.
[1:03:17] You have when it's it's perfectly
[1:03:19] aligned with the word. It becomes a
[1:03:21] perfect judge. Amen. And he'll it'll
[1:03:24] tell you the amazing thing. It won't
[1:03:27] only accuse you, but it it will excuse
[1:03:30] you just like Paul. Imagine how Paul
[1:03:34] felt when he was being accused by
[1:03:36] people. You're wrong. You're you're
[1:03:39] you're a holy roller. You've done this.
[1:03:41] You you're breaking down our Jewish
[1:03:43] laws. He says, "My conscience is clear.
[1:03:48] My conscience is clear. Tell me
[1:03:49] whatever. You can condemn me. You could
[1:03:52] do whatever you want to do with me. You
[1:03:54] could throw me in prison. You could kill
[1:03:57] me. I'm clear with you and God."
[1:04:02] Oh. to live that way.
[1:04:05] A righteous man's
[1:04:07] character, but it it has to
[1:04:11] be in the word. It
[1:04:15] needs to take you and the holy it needs
[1:04:19] the Holy Ghost to guide you. Um in
[1:04:23] Romans 9:1, Paul says, "I say the truth
[1:04:27] in Christ, I lie not. my conscience also
[1:04:30] bearing witness in the Holy
[1:04:33] Ghost. Here here he's showing that the
[1:04:36] Holy Ghost is backing up his
[1:04:39] conscience. He's saying that he when
[1:04:42] he's speaking truthfully, it's because
[1:04:44] his conscience is guided by the Holy
[1:04:47] Spirit. It's not a natural conscience.
[1:04:49] The Holy Spirit enlightens and
[1:04:51] influences the conscience.
[1:04:54] So the the conscience separate from the
[1:04:57] Holy Spirit, we got to be careful from
[1:05:00] that because it can be guided with with
[1:05:06] misinformation. Brother Brandham, he
[1:05:08] says this and it's a very strange thing
[1:05:12] he says, but but I like what he says.
[1:05:14] He's talking about himself and he's
[1:05:16] saying to any man or woman that ever
[1:05:18] meets fa God face to face and can walk
[1:05:21] and take it a light thing to see people
[1:05:23] on the streets carousing in sin. He says
[1:05:26] it kills
[1:05:28] you. I said to my wife some time ago and
[1:05:31] some some of the brethren said, "Have I
[1:05:34] gone insane? Am I a madman? Why do I
[1:05:37] keep balling the people out? Why do I
[1:05:40] say this? I fast and I said I fast and I
[1:05:43] pray to get away from it. And the more I
[1:05:46] fast, the uglier sin gets. See, it just
[1:05:50] makes it worse. Till honest, you can't
[1:05:52] even go out.
[1:05:55] The closer you get to God, the uglier
[1:05:58] sin gets. We begin to be convicted by
[1:06:01] doing the things that we once thought
[1:06:03] were okay.
[1:06:05] You get closer to God and you begin to
[1:06:07] understand, whoa, that what I've been
[1:06:11] doing for so many years, that's not
[1:06:12] okay. What is it? It's God redirecting
[1:06:16] and changing the conscience, restoring
[1:06:20] your heart once more.
[1:06:22] Those that have been out in the world
[1:06:24] for years and years, you know what?
[1:06:27] Honestly, not even years. Somebody could
[1:06:29] be out in the year the world for for a
[1:06:32] year. That's right, brother. You will be
[1:06:34] ravished by the devil. To the where you
[1:06:37] you hate everybody. You think everything
[1:06:41] is okay. You'll reason with those with
[1:06:44] with why God isn't real. You'll become a
[1:06:47] crazy person.
[1:06:50] I've seen it.
[1:06:52] Seen it many times where we just don't
[1:06:56] care about anything. Ready to kill
[1:06:58] somebody if they say something wrong. If
[1:07:00] somebody cuts you off, you're you've got
[1:07:02] your 45 right next to you. That's how
[1:07:06] the world is today.
[1:07:09] And they they'll justify themselves why
[1:07:11] a a mom taking their kids to soccer
[1:07:14] practice, why she had to die because she
[1:07:17] cut him off. That's what happened. Their
[1:07:20] conscience was gone. It's been seared.
[1:07:24] They don't care anymore.
[1:07:26] But when you give it to God,
[1:07:29] every time you get closer to his
[1:07:31] presence, those things that you thought
[1:07:33] were okay, those things that you thought
[1:07:36] were fine, it becomes uglier and uglier
[1:07:40] and uglier and and every time it does
[1:07:43] that, it causes the body to react. Says,
[1:07:46] "I'm not doing that anymore." You don't
[1:07:48] you don't need to be religious to change
[1:07:50] yourself. Well, I'm coming to church. I
[1:07:53] better do this now. I better do that.
[1:07:55] No.
[1:07:56] Let the word deal with your conscience.
[1:08:00] Let the Holy Spirit work in you and your
[1:08:03] own conviction will say that's wrong.
[1:08:06] Isn't that amazing? You know, you know,
[1:08:09] we talk, you'll hear so many people talk
[1:08:11] about revelation. Oh, such big great
[1:08:15] thing. Revelation. No, revelation is
[1:08:18] whenever you understand. When you have
[1:08:19] revelation every single day is
[1:08:22] understanding why you're not supposed to
[1:08:24] do something. Yeah. It doesn't take
[1:08:26] somebody from the behind the pulpit or
[1:08:29] or somebody in in in wherever you're
[1:08:31] hearing saying, "Oh, you better not do
[1:08:33] that or you're going to go to hell." You
[1:08:36] don't need that. You align yourself with
[1:08:38] the word and you'll get the revelation
[1:08:40] why it's wrong. Your conscience will
[1:08:43] begin to say, "Hey, I shouldn't be doing
[1:08:45] that anymore."
[1:08:47] And and that judge will not let you go.
[1:08:51] You can go to sleep. You can have a
[1:08:53] smile. You can do whatever you want to
[1:08:54] do, but when you wake up, it's going to
[1:08:57] be there to say, "Hey, you still haven't
[1:08:58] fixed that.
[1:09:00] You still haven't done what I told you
[1:09:02] to do."
[1:09:04] Oh, and then when you fix it, when you
[1:09:07] fix it with that person that you've
[1:09:09] you've been arguing with, that you lied
[1:09:13] about, that you hurt, when you go and
[1:09:17] you say, "Forgive me."
[1:09:20] and and and you truly mean it in your
[1:09:22] heart and and you give your heart and
[1:09:24] you say, "I'm sorry that I did this. I
[1:09:26] that I offended you." And you can walk
[1:09:28] away saying, "It's
[1:09:30] done." No matter what anybody else says
[1:09:33] about it anymore, it's done.
[1:09:36] My conscience is
[1:09:37] clear. It's a faithful friend. Your
[1:09:41] conscience, it
[1:09:43] hurts. A godly conscience hurts.
[1:09:49] one of the biggest, but it's one of the
[1:09:51] biggest blessings that we have.
[1:09:55] I believe it's a faithful friend. There
[1:09:57] in in Proverbs 27:6, there's um a
[1:10:00] scripture. It talks about a faithful
[1:10:02] friend. It says, "Faithful are the wombs
[1:10:04] of a friend, but kisses of an enemy are
[1:10:07] deceitful."
[1:10:09] I I truly believe that that's that's our
[1:10:11] conscience.
[1:10:13] When our our conscience is aligned with
[1:10:15] your the word of God, it'll hurt you.
[1:10:20] It'll dig at you every day. But it's
[1:10:23] telling you there's danger. There's
[1:10:25] danger. There's danger. What you're
[1:10:27] doing is wrong. What you're doing is
[1:10:28] wrong. What you're doing is wrong. What
[1:10:29] you're doing is wrong. Until you fix it.
[1:10:31] And he says, "Ah, how do you feel now?"
[1:10:35] That big burden of guilt is gone.
[1:10:39] Doesn't that feel good? That's why I'm a
[1:10:40] Christian, actually. Amen. Because I had
[1:10:43] a burden I could not bear. I I had a
[1:10:47] burden that was greater than than what I
[1:10:50] could do. I was driving myself crazy.
[1:10:54] If you looked at me, I look like a
[1:10:56] normal person. Yet within me was a
[1:10:59] turmoil.
[1:11:01] And we see that today where people they
[1:11:04] can't handle the burden to the point
[1:11:06] where they want to take their own lives.
[1:11:09] They want to go into drugs just so that
[1:11:11] they can ease the pain.
[1:11:13] But step into Christ and Christ says, "I
[1:11:17] have paid all of your debts."
[1:11:20] All of your guilt, all of your shame.
[1:11:23] Come unto me and confess them to me. Not
[1:11:26] so that I can judge you, so that I can
[1:11:28] take them away. Oh, praise
[1:11:31] God. That deserves a clap offering.
[1:11:35] Amen.
[1:11:37] That's why we're Christians
[1:11:39] today. That's why I'm a Christian. I
[1:11:42] didn't come to be a Christian because um
[1:11:45] I was I was raised in in the word. I was
[1:11:48] raised in all those things, but my
[1:11:50] nature wanted to go out there. I didn't
[1:11:52] become a Christian whenever I was born
[1:11:54] into a church. It was whenever I gave my
[1:11:58] heart to the Lord. It was when I I
[1:12:01] realized I couldn't carry every burden.
[1:12:04] then he forgave me. And whenever that
[1:12:08] guilt is gone, well, praise
[1:12:11] God. But that pain, it's
[1:12:14] needed. You know, I started thinking
[1:12:16] about it. It's it's kind of like your
[1:12:18] your sensory your sensory of pain. Pain,
[1:12:22] we don't like pain. When you wake up,
[1:12:24] your knees start hurting. Your back is
[1:12:28] all messed
[1:12:29] up. But pain is important. And it's
[1:12:32] telling you, hey, the engine light is
[1:12:34] on.
[1:12:36] Some something's wrong with your body.
[1:12:39] You know, whenever a child whenever
[1:12:41] they're playing next to the stove,
[1:12:43] everybody can tell them, we've all heard
[1:12:44] it, that you could tell them, "Don't
[1:12:46] touch it. Don't touch it. Don't touch
[1:12:47] it." But it takes that one
[1:12:49] time for them to touch it. That's the
[1:12:53] greatest lesson.
[1:12:55] That's the greatest teacher is whenever
[1:12:59] pain hits the body and it sends all the
[1:13:03] whatever happens goes all the way to the
[1:13:05] brain and says, "Ah, don't touch it
[1:13:08] again. That's danger right there." Well,
[1:13:11] you can't be like, "Oh man, that pain,
[1:13:14] oh, I hate it." No, it's you better
[1:13:16] thank it because that just saved your
[1:13:17] life.
[1:13:19] It's it's saying pain is there to tell
[1:13:22] you if you continue to do it, there's
[1:13:24] danger, possible death.
[1:13:27] So pain is letting you know, hey, there
[1:13:30] might be something wrong. You need to
[1:13:31] get it
[1:13:33] fixed. That's a conscience.
[1:13:36] Your conscience is there to say, whoa,
[1:13:39] you're getting a little too close to the
[1:13:40] fire.
[1:13:42] You're you're you're you're getting too
[1:13:44] close to danger.
[1:13:46] You need to correct yourself. Amen.
[1:13:50] Brother Brandham, he he
[1:13:53] says he says this and and three kinds of
[1:13:56] believers. He says, "And remember when a
[1:13:59] man, a human being or that woman or boy
[1:14:01] or girl that ever meets God is changed.
[1:14:04] He's never the same. He's changed from
[1:14:07] that time on." So God, he restored him.
[1:14:12] Restores that person, restores that
[1:14:15] girl. Says, "That's right. He will never
[1:14:17] be the same no matter what. He might get
[1:14:20] away from God, but God will never get
[1:14:23] away from him. Everywhere you go, this
[1:14:26] is what he says. This is what I like. He
[1:14:29] says, "You'll be haunted day and night
[1:14:32] if you ever meet God till you come back
[1:14:35] again." There's there's a
[1:14:38] hunting there. There's there's something
[1:14:40] that's saying, "Hey, you cannot continue
[1:14:43] on this way. You can't continue on." And
[1:14:46] a lot of times people are stubborn and
[1:14:48] they just keep trying to hush that
[1:14:50] conscience down. It's like, no, it's all
[1:14:53] right. I I I don't need it. I I'm okay.
[1:14:56] I'm all right. I'm okay. And we begin to
[1:14:58] reason within
[1:14:59] ourselves. We we be try to to retrain
[1:15:03] our conscience once more. He continues
[1:15:06] on. He says, "As I said this morning,
[1:15:09] how Pilate must have walked on the floor
[1:15:11] that night with his worried
[1:15:13] conscience trying to clean himself." He
[1:15:16] said, "My when no doubt he he had called
[1:15:20] through that night, I've I've washed my
[1:15:22] hands all night and I still can't
[1:15:23] understand. See, they're not clean. I
[1:15:27] can never go and meet him. I've got the
[1:15:29] blood upon my hands. Oh my." See, never
[1:15:32] be guilty of that. It's on your hands.
[1:15:36] He says there's only one thing you can
[1:15:38] get get it out and accept and that's
[1:15:41] accept it. That's right. Become part of
[1:15:43] it. That what it was shed for. Amen. So
[1:15:48] we've got a guilt that we can never wash
[1:15:52] you. Whatever you do, you cannot make it
[1:15:54] right. You only come to the blood. Only
[1:15:58] come to
[1:15:59] Christ. It'll all wash away.
[1:16:03] Praise God.
[1:16:05] So a man's conscience is like a warning
[1:16:07] line on a highway. It tells him what
[1:16:10] what he shouldn't do and it keep but it
[1:16:13] doesn't keep him from doing it. You see
[1:16:16] all the stop lines. You see the the uh
[1:16:19] white lines in the middle and and the
[1:16:21] white lines on the sides and you see the
[1:16:23] slow down the yields and all of that.
[1:16:26] Those those are all suggestions, but
[1:16:28] it's telling you be careful. Stop. Go
[1:16:32] slow.
[1:16:34] Don't turn around this way. Don't make a
[1:16:36] U-turn.
[1:16:38] Do all those things, but it can't stop
[1:16:40] you from doing that. Your conscience is
[1:16:42] not going to hold you back. It's just
[1:16:45] telling you, hey, don't do those
[1:16:50] things. He he um one of the things, one
[1:16:53] of the quotes that really helped me out
[1:16:55] when I was listening to uh brother
[1:16:57] Brandham is in the message enticing
[1:16:59] spirits.
[1:17:01] He said that someone come the other day
[1:17:03] and said, "Brother Brenham, do you think
[1:17:05] it's wrong to do a certain thing?" He
[1:17:07] was asking him about a certain thing. I
[1:17:10] said, "Why do you question about it?"
[1:17:13] See, if there's a question in your mind,
[1:17:16] leave it alone. Don't do it at all. Just
[1:17:19] stay with that. When you start, do
[1:17:22] anything. And if there's a question,
[1:17:23] whether it's right or wrong, stay away
[1:17:25] from it. Don't go into it at all. Then
[1:17:28] you know you're right. Amen. I
[1:17:31] understood whenever I was a young
[1:17:33] Christian that there's many things I
[1:17:35] couldn't find in the Bible. I didn't
[1:17:37] know how to navigate through the Bible
[1:17:38] and I couldn't find it. I couldn't find
[1:17:40] it um w with the messages and and
[1:17:43] preachers and all of that. And I said,
[1:17:45] "Is this right or is this wrong?" And
[1:17:47] that quote helped me because there was a
[1:17:50] question. There was a an alert in my
[1:17:53] heart saying, "Is this
[1:17:55] right? Am I going the right way?
[1:17:59] this doesn't feel like it's right. And
[1:18:01] whenever you feel that, just don't do
[1:18:03] it. You don't need you don't need
[1:18:06] constant answers of, oh, well, should I
[1:18:09] do this and should I do that? What does
[1:18:10] your conscience tell you? What does your
[1:18:13] heart say when you do that
[1:18:15] thing? Well, if it's there's an
[1:18:19] alert, if there's an engine light going
[1:18:21] on, don't do it.
[1:18:24] If there's a stop, if there's a yield,
[1:18:26] do it. Listen to that conscience in your
[1:18:31] heart. Just like Paul, he says, "I do
[1:18:34] exercise myself to always
[1:18:37] um to have always a conscience void of
[1:18:39] offense toward God and toward
[1:18:41] men." He speaks of having a conscience
[1:18:44] void of offense toward God and toward
[1:18:46] men. Meaning, he strives to live free
[1:18:49] from guilt or moral failure.
[1:18:53] And void it means to be empty and and uh
[1:18:57] offense. It means to uh refers to
[1:19:00] anything that violates his conscience or
[1:19:03] becomes a stumbling block.
[1:19:06] Paul's aim is to keep his inner life
[1:19:09] clean.
[1:19:10] Not just in how he relates to God, which
[1:19:13] is a vertical
[1:19:15] integrity, but it's also how he treats
[1:19:18] others, which is horizontal integrity.
[1:19:21] How does he treat others? How does he
[1:19:24] how does God look upon him? That's
[1:19:26] that's what we should be looking
[1:19:28] towards. Doesn't matter what anybody
[1:19:30] accuses
[1:19:32] you. Here in 1 Peter 3:16-1 17, it says,
[1:19:36] "Having a good conscience, that whereas
[1:19:38] they speak evil of you as evildoers,
[1:19:41] they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
[1:19:43] you of good of your good conversation in
[1:19:46] Christ. For it is better if the will of
[1:19:49] God be so that than to suffer um that ye
[1:19:53] suffer for welloing than evildoing.
[1:19:57] So if you're suffering but you're right
[1:19:59] with God, let it be. If you're being
[1:20:02] accused, if you're going those through
[1:20:03] certain things in your life, let it be.
[1:20:06] if the conscience is clear.
[1:20:09] A good day can be a a horrible day if
[1:20:13] you have a bad
[1:20:14] conscience. But a horrible day, a day
[1:20:17] full of accusations, a day full of
[1:20:20] heartaches is a wonderful day with a
[1:20:23] clear conscience. That's right. Oh, when
[1:20:26] you had a hard time at work, when you
[1:20:29] had issues, when you had somebody false
[1:20:31] accuse you, when when you're going
[1:20:32] through things at work and there's
[1:20:34] people you can't work around, when you
[1:20:36] can sit there and say, "Lord, I've done
[1:20:38] everything I could. I I I've acted
[1:20:41] right. I have my good conversation." Let
[1:20:43] them be ashamed of your goodness. And if
[1:20:46] they're not ashamed, then be be
[1:20:49] persecuted for God's will and not
[1:20:53] evildoing. Praise God. There's a French
[1:20:56] proverb that says, "There is no pillow
[1:20:59] so soft as a clear conscience."
[1:21:02] Oh, man. You know those nice cold
[1:21:05] pillows, you flip it and you just go to
[1:21:07] sleep. That's a clear conscience. When
[1:21:09] you can go to sleep at night and not
[1:21:12] worry, not have things in your mind, not
[1:21:16] have stress of the things that you could
[1:21:18] have done, the could a would a shoulds,
[1:21:21] but you could go to sleep and say, "Ah,
[1:21:25] praise God. I've done everything right."
[1:21:28] Now, when I was studying this, I I
[1:21:31] understood that there's another pillow
[1:21:33] just as
[1:21:34] soft. There's two types of people that
[1:21:37] can sleep good at night.
[1:21:39] a man with a clear conscience and a
[1:21:42] person with no conscience at all. Right.
[1:21:45] Right. Because a a person with no
[1:21:48] conscience at all, that they don't
[1:21:50] care. And that's where we don't want to
[1:21:52] be at. That's where the devil he he what
[1:21:55] he's trying to do every single day.
[1:21:59] Brother Brandham, he explains it
[1:22:02] perfectly how this what these two things
[1:22:05] are. Now, I was talking a little bit
[1:22:07] about the clear conscience here. He
[1:22:09] talks about it in um with no conscience
[1:22:12] at all. He says, and he said he he's
[1:22:15] talking um there there was a Native
[1:22:17] American that was explaining what a a
[1:22:20] conscience is. What is your conscience?
[1:22:22] What how does it work? Native American.
[1:22:25] He said, "It's a little thing that's got
[1:22:28] four points on it and they're sharps and
[1:22:31] they're sharp and it setits right in
[1:22:33] your heart and when you do something
[1:22:36] wrong, it starts
[1:22:39] turning." Said, "You keep letting it
[1:22:42] turn. It'll cut a streak right right
[1:22:45] through it and you can't feel it at
[1:22:47] all." So, I thought that was a pretty
[1:22:50] good
[1:22:51] expression. Our conscience is like a a
[1:22:54] little thing with four points on it set
[1:22:57] in your heart. Every time you do
[1:22:59] something wrong, it turns just a little
[1:23:02] and it hurts. But you continue and you
[1:23:05] continue and you continue and you
[1:23:08] continue to do those bad things. It'll
[1:23:10] turn and turn and turn and turn and turn
[1:23:13] and turn until you can't feel it at
[1:23:16] all. Now, the thing that you feel now,
[1:23:19] that means you still have it. Amen. That
[1:23:22] means God is still working on you.
[1:23:26] But those things when we allow ourselves
[1:23:30] just to keep breaking every single
[1:23:33] barricade when God
[1:23:35] calls, God calls you and God calls you
[1:23:37] and God calls you every single day
[1:23:40] saying, "Come to me. Come to me. Come
[1:23:44] with me." And we just keep going, keep
[1:23:47] going in our lives. There'll be one day
[1:23:49] where we just don't feel it.
[1:23:52] We just don't care
[1:23:55] anymore. The very
[1:23:57] thing, the very faithful friend that
[1:24:00] tells us that we're
[1:24:03] wrong, that tells us, "Hey, stop. Be
[1:24:07] careful. There's
[1:24:08] danger." Trying to pull us out, but he
[1:24:11] can't do nothing. He's just constantly
[1:24:13] crying out to you.
[1:24:16] He himself
[1:24:18] becomes defiled
[1:24:20] and desensitized and
[1:24:23] evil. That same conscience that was a
[1:24:26] faithful friend becomes the Bible says
[1:24:29] an evil
[1:24:30] conscience. Desensitized. The Bible even
[1:24:33] calls it in in Titus 1:15 a a defiled
[1:24:37] and unbelieving cons
[1:24:40] conscience where nothing is pure
[1:24:42] anymore.
[1:24:44] where where somebody begins to talk to
[1:24:46] you about the gospel and there's no
[1:24:48] reverence anymore
[1:24:50] there we don't care
[1:24:53] anymore why because we we've we've uh
[1:24:56] seared the Bible says in 1 Timothy 4 two
[1:25:01] uh 1 and2 it says that that their
[1:25:04] conscience has been seared with a hot
[1:25:07] iron it's it means to to be seared a
[1:25:11] conscience that is seared it means that
[1:25:13] there was a too much exposure to
[1:25:17] sin that that it's been exposed and
[1:25:20] exposed and exposed to sin to the point
[1:25:22] where it's seared and it's numbed away
[1:25:25] from God.
[1:25:27] Doesn't mean that God stopped calling
[1:25:29] you. It means your conscience has
[1:25:31] stopped responding.
[1:25:33] It means that the the little room that
[1:25:36] used to allow the Holy Spirit to come in
[1:25:38] and speak through the mic and say, "Hey,
[1:25:41] I'm still here for you. Hey, I'm still
[1:25:46] knocking. I'm still
[1:25:48] knocking." You're going to close that
[1:25:50] door and say, "I don't want to hear it
[1:25:52] anymore. Be quiet. I want to do what I
[1:25:55] want to do." Yeah, but there's danger
[1:25:57] ahead. There's danger ahead. There's
[1:25:59] danger ahead. Until you just don't hear
[1:26:01] it anymore.
[1:26:03] and to where those all those stop signs
[1:26:05] that you used to see, all those
[1:26:08] barricades that told you not to go to
[1:26:10] that place, all those things that said
[1:26:12] don't don't go there, all your mother's
[1:26:15] prayers, Brother Benham says, all the
[1:26:17] pastor's preachings that he's preached
[1:26:19] behind this pulpit, all those things
[1:26:22] will be broken down and then it'll
[1:26:24] become a red carpet straight to the
[1:26:26] thing you want to do.
[1:26:29] All those barricades will break every
[1:26:31] single one of them
[1:26:33] until then then we just don't care
[1:26:37] anymore. All those gospel songs, all
[1:26:40] those things. Brother Brandham says God
[1:26:43] doesn't send somebody to
[1:26:45] hell. We fight, are we?
[1:26:49] That there's there's barricades there.
[1:26:52] There's things your mother's prayers,
[1:26:55] her her her uh
[1:26:58] instructions, the pastor's
[1:27:00] preachings, all those things, those are
[1:27:03] all barricades
[1:27:05] saying, "Don't go there." And we keep
[1:27:07] fighting every single barricade. We keep
[1:27:10] breaking down every single thing until
[1:27:12] it becomes a highway.
[1:27:15] Matthew 7:13 it says, "Enter ye the
[1:27:18] straight gate, for wide is the gate, and
[1:27:21] broad is the way that leadth to
[1:27:23] destruction, and many there be which go
[1:27:27] therein." What is it? Whenever we break
[1:27:30] everything in, then there's an open
[1:27:32] door to destruction. There there's a
[1:27:35] wide highway for us to go. Why? There's
[1:27:38] nothing holding us back
[1:27:40] anymore. Our faithful friend isn't
[1:27:42] there.
[1:27:47] Brother Brandham, he says, "But when men
[1:27:49] and women let their hearts become
[1:27:52] seared," now this is this is hard, but
[1:27:54] he says, "It's demons, powers of the
[1:27:57] devil." There was never one but one
[1:28:00] thing in all the age that would strip
[1:28:02] men that was devils. Strip women rather,
[1:28:04] that's exactly or men. Either one. It
[1:28:06] looks like a bunch of prehistoric
[1:28:08] animals laying there stripped with no
[1:28:10] conscience. The Bible said they they had
[1:28:13] their conscience seared with a high
[1:28:15] iron. And the same people is the one I'm
[1:28:18] speaking in particularly that I know
[1:28:20] sings in choirs. Oh my. They got
[1:28:23] fellowship with groups surely, but the
[1:28:25] fellowship with Christ. What of it? So
[1:28:29] he's not talking about just sinners out
[1:28:31] in the world. Talking about us.
[1:28:35] I I've got to examine myself.
[1:28:38] I've got a the one that's going to be
[1:28:40] deceived in heaven is going to be the
[1:28:42] ones that think they were going to
[1:28:46] heaven. There there you see Christ
[1:28:50] standing at the door in the Ladyian age
[1:28:52] in
[1:28:53] Revelations knocking at the heart of the
[1:28:56] people knocking and knocking and
[1:28:59] knocking. And then you see he begins to
[1:29:01] explain the negative of what happened to
[1:29:04] the Garden of Eden. the Garden of Eden.
[1:29:07] These people were veiled with a holy
[1:29:09] veil in their eyes.
[1:29:12] Didn't mean that they were
[1:29:14] covered. They were they were never
[1:29:16] covered. They were always
[1:29:18] naked, but they were veiled in their
[1:29:21] eyes so that they never knew that they
[1:29:24] were naked. It was a holy veil.
[1:29:28] And whenever that veil was taken away,
[1:29:31] shame be to hit because they realized,
[1:29:33] "Oh my goodness, I've sinned. I'm naked.
[1:29:36] I need to cover
[1:29:38] myself." Then we find ourselves in this
[1:29:41] day in the same
[1:29:43] position where Jesus says, "You don't
[1:29:46] even know you're wretched, blind, and
[1:29:48] naked.
[1:29:50] You don't even know that you're in the
[1:29:52] same position as Adam and Eve, but now
[1:29:54] it's the negative. And it's a sinful
[1:29:57] veil over the people's eyes. And they
[1:30:00] don't even know that they're going
[1:30:01] through those things. They don't even
[1:30:05] know. It takes the Holy Spirit to come
[1:30:08] and to knock into your heart. And
[1:30:10] whenever you open your heart, then your
[1:30:12] eyes are open and say, "I've been doing
[1:30:15] this all wrong the whole time.
[1:30:18] I've been sinning. I've been doing this.
[1:30:20] And the more closer you you get with
[1:30:22] Jesus, the more communion we you get
[1:30:25] with him, oh, the uglier all those
[1:30:27] things get. What? He's restoring you
[1:30:31] back to those
[1:30:33] things. But that's what we find the
[1:30:36] world in, the church is in in this uh
[1:30:39] lollying and and they're no more
[1:30:41] conscience and you can hardly wake them
[1:30:43] up, brother Brandham says. and and the
[1:30:45] condition they said the Lord is coming
[1:30:48] but they devouring each other and
[1:30:50] backbiting and hating and all these
[1:30:52] things. What is it there? There's no
[1:30:54] more conscience. That's why you you've
[1:30:57] got to you've got to appreciate places
[1:30:59] like this where the word is preached
[1:31:03] where there no bars being let down. The
[1:31:05] word is here. Christ is here
[1:31:09] and whatever you need it can change your
[1:31:12] life.
[1:31:14] It hurts, but it's good for you.
[1:31:18] Oh, it's a faithful friend. The thing
[1:31:21] that we're feeling, that's a faithful
[1:31:23] friend.
[1:31:25] here here in closing there's this story
[1:31:28] of this of this woman and I'm not going
[1:31:30] to there's a lot of brother Brandham
[1:31:32] says the story and I'm not going to go
[1:31:34] verbatim of what he says but he was
[1:31:36] talking about this woman that used to go
[1:31:38] to the same church as his his pastor
[1:31:40] brother Orman Neville at that time and
[1:31:44] uh they were
[1:31:45] Methodists and she was you know she her
[1:31:48] her dad was a deacon and and he was a
[1:31:51] spiritfilled man Brandham says and she
[1:31:54] she's a young woman. She finds a man
[1:31:56] that was spiritfilled and and she
[1:31:59] married
[1:31:59] him and um yet her heart was never she
[1:32:04] never truly accepted the Lord. So she
[1:32:07] was in that position of like well I was
[1:32:09] born in the church. That's the thing is
[1:32:11] like those that have been raised in the
[1:32:13] church we have to find our experience.
[1:32:16] Amen. Those that are in the world,
[1:32:19] sometimes it's easier for them to accept
[1:32:21] the Lord because they're coming out of a
[1:32:25] horrible condition. They're coming out
[1:32:28] of of mental struggles. A lot of times
[1:32:32] we're so comfortable in our lives, us
[1:32:35] young people that are raised in
[1:32:39] church,
[1:32:40] right? So she she her dad was a deacon.
[1:32:44] She would married a spiritfilled man and
[1:32:46] and
[1:32:47] um conditions happened to to make them
[1:32:50] move because of certain conditions and
[1:32:52] they moved to another church and and
[1:32:54] brother Brandham says that that it was a
[1:32:56] church that here let me see what he says
[1:32:59] just
[1:33:01] so he says he he he went they went to a
[1:33:04] church that uh where is
[1:33:12] it that went to a church that wasn't
[1:33:15] very
[1:33:16] spiritual that didn't allow the Holy
[1:33:18] Spirit to come but it was very
[1:33:21] formal that allowed certain things and
[1:33:24] she noticed so they had to go to that
[1:33:26] and they noticed that the women would
[1:33:28] smoke cigarettes they w they noticed
[1:33:30] that that they do certain things she
[1:33:33] said oh well they do wow I didn't know
[1:33:37] we could do those things I didn't know
[1:33:39] we could do those things and and her
[1:33:41] husband he would work from far away and
[1:33:43] he would have to go out of town and and
[1:33:45] she began to see the way the women would
[1:33:48] act and the people would act and she's
[1:33:50] like, "Well, if they do it," her her
[1:33:52] reasoning began to work in her life, she
[1:33:55] says, "Wow, if they could do it, I could
[1:33:57] do it." But as as she begins to let down
[1:34:00] every single bar, break down a
[1:34:03] barricade, her conscience would say,
[1:34:05] "Hey, you're not supposed to do that."
[1:34:08] He says that her conscience and the Holy
[1:34:10] Spirit would begin to work in her, but
[1:34:14] then her intellectual would come and
[1:34:16] say, "Hey, but they do
[1:34:18] it. They're just as fine people. If they
[1:34:21] can do it, I can do it." She would push
[1:34:25] her conscience, the Holy Spirit. Brother
[1:34:27] Barham set her soul aside and she would
[1:34:30] continue
[1:34:31] on. Then they lived right next to
[1:34:34] brother Barham said a slicker. And as
[1:34:36] the husband was out, she would go and
[1:34:39] start talking to him at the
[1:34:42] gate. And and there they would they
[1:34:44] began to talk to each other to the point
[1:34:46] where where they got into an intimate
[1:34:49] relationship. And she left her husband,
[1:34:50] the spiritfilled man, and she ended up
[1:34:52] with
[1:34:53] him and her conscience telling her this
[1:34:56] that's not right. You shouldn't do that.
[1:34:58] You shouldn't do that. And she said,
[1:34:59] "Well, they're doing it. Why can't I?"
[1:35:03] She her intellectual reasoning that's
[1:35:05] the enemy of God's Holy Spirit. God's
[1:35:08] conviction is reasoning.
[1:35:11] Well, if I could do it, that was just
[1:35:13] the same thing as the children of Israel
[1:35:15] asking for Saul.
[1:35:17] We want a king. We want them. We want to
[1:35:20] be like them. And God says, "Man, you're
[1:35:22] rejecting me. You're not rejecting
[1:35:25] Samuel." So, she continues on. She ends
[1:35:29] up with this man. She's still she
[1:35:31] becomes a pianist at the at the church
[1:35:33] that she was going to. She's smoking
[1:35:35] cigarettes. She's um well while the men
[1:35:39] come from work, they're they're dressed
[1:35:41] a certain way so that they can, you
[1:35:43] know, have the men look at them and
[1:35:45] stuff. And that's just her life. She
[1:35:47] began to be that way. The man, he ended
[1:35:50] up finding somebody else and divorced
[1:35:52] her and now she's with somebody. Now
[1:35:55] he's with somebody else. And then she
[1:35:57] finds somebody else and she her life
[1:36:00] begins to be all messed up and yet her
[1:36:02] conscience continues and continues to
[1:36:05] cry out. But yet she just shuts it
[1:36:08] away. Even whenever she was with the
[1:36:11] spiritfilled man when he would say, "I
[1:36:12] don't think we should be that." She
[1:36:14] would snap at him right away and say,
[1:36:15] "Oh no, you get out of my
[1:36:18] business." When somebody would try to to
[1:36:21] correct but do a corrective action, she
[1:36:24] would shut it away right away.
[1:36:28] Then she finds herself
[1:36:31] sick and she's at the point in of of
[1:36:34] death and in her m and her life. Now
[1:36:36] this is a hard this is a hard story but
[1:36:38] this is a true story. It's not just a
[1:36:41] madeup story but she was she was at a
[1:36:43] the point of death and everything was
[1:36:46] okay. She she knew she believed she knew
[1:36:49] where she was
[1:36:50] going. And and brother Neville, he finds
[1:36:53] out that she's in there in the hospital
[1:36:56] and she he asked Brother Brandham, "Hey,
[1:36:58] uh, do you think I should go pray?" And
[1:37:00] I don't even think he asked. He just
[1:37:02] said, "I'm going to go pray for her."
[1:37:03] And he goes and he goes and talks to her
[1:37:06] and she said, "Ah, good morning. Good to
[1:37:09] see you." And he said, "Yeah, you used
[1:37:10] we used to go to the same church."
[1:37:13] and and he says, "I just came here to
[1:37:17] let you know. Are are you going to make
[1:37:18] those things right?" She said,
[1:37:21] "What? Make those things right? I'm as
[1:37:25] good as you are. What are you talking
[1:37:27] about? What happened?" She reasoned her
[1:37:30] conscience
[1:37:31] away to where she believed that she was
[1:37:35] right. Well, no. you your the way you're
[1:37:39] living the life that you're living the
[1:37:42] things that you're doing you're not
[1:37:43] supposed to be doing those have you
[1:37:45] asked the Lord Jesus for forgiveness
[1:37:48] what was it was the last call of
[1:37:50] forgiveness the last call of hope
[1:37:52] through this man saying haven't you
[1:37:56] repented yet and she says I have nothing
[1:37:58] to repent of
[1:38:01] I'm as good as you and she says by the
[1:38:04] way get out of here I already have my
[1:38:07] pastor I don't need you. She kicked him
[1:38:11] out. Brother Neville goes and tells
[1:38:14] brother Brandon. Brother Brandon's like,
[1:38:15] just just watch till the
[1:38:18] end. And there as as she's about to
[1:38:23] leave consciousness and she's about to
[1:38:26] pass
[1:38:27] away, all of her intellects. See, what
[1:38:31] we do if we're not careful is we'll
[1:38:33] begin to the reasonings begin to be
[1:38:37] strongholds. They'll begin to be
[1:38:39] structures in our mind and and it it'll
[1:38:41] structure our mind the way we want it to
[1:38:44] be. We begin to train our conscience to
[1:38:46] where we say, "Oh, everything is fine."
[1:38:48] And and we're taking a lot of mental
[1:38:52] power to make ourselves believe that
[1:38:55] we're okay.
[1:38:57] And that's what was going on with her.
[1:38:58] And whenever her mental faculties begin
[1:39:01] to leave
[1:39:02] her, her brother Bandham says her soul
[1:39:05] came
[1:39:05] back. Her conscience began to get a
[1:39:09] little louder again because her
[1:39:10] reasoning was
[1:39:12] leaving. Her intellect begin to leave as
[1:39:15] her conscience would
[1:39:16] leave. And it said, "You're
[1:39:19] lost." And she
[1:39:21] said, "I'm
[1:39:23] lost. I'm lost. I'm lost. I'm lost. I'm
[1:39:28] lost. And she began to cry out and she
[1:39:31] looked at her pastor and she said,
[1:39:32] "You're a
[1:39:33] liar. You told me I was okay. You told
[1:39:36] me I was okay." And the pastor said, "Go
[1:39:39] put a hypo needle needle on her so she
[1:39:41] can calm down." And brother Brandon said
[1:39:44] that stealed her
[1:39:45] confession, that she still had a chance.
[1:39:49] Her conscience came back and she was
[1:39:51] going to cry out to the Lord. But then
[1:39:53] they they stuck a needle in her so that
[1:39:55] she could go back uh in in uh to go to
[1:39:59] sleep and it stopped her
[1:40:03] confession. What was it? She she grieved
[1:40:07] away the Holy Spirit, grieved away her
[1:40:10] conscience. That's that's a rough
[1:40:13] thing for us to do that. We know that
[1:40:17] the young rich ruler did the same thing.
[1:40:19] Christ said, "Come follow me." He said,
[1:40:21] "No, I'm fine." By the end of his life,
[1:40:24] he's sitting there with all of his
[1:40:26] storehouses and he says, "Ah, I say to
[1:40:29] my soul, I am
[1:40:32] satisfied." Then where did he find
[1:40:35] himself? Looking
[1:40:37] up, looking up in hell, say, "God, God,
[1:40:41] help
[1:40:41] me." Abraham,
[1:40:44] Abraham, what was it? Everything came
[1:40:47] back. his gifts. He was, brother Baron
[1:40:50] said he would he had a gift to be an
[1:40:53] evangelist. He had a He had gifts. Um I
[1:40:56] I know that sister had gifts, but yet
[1:40:58] she abandoned God and and every gift,
[1:41:01] everything that she was supposed to be
[1:41:04] came back
[1:41:06] to. And he began to cry out and cry out.
[1:41:11] Brother Brandham, he says in a message
[1:41:13] without money or without price here in
[1:41:15] closing, he says, "God have mercy on us,
[1:41:19] brother. I would like to live in this
[1:41:21] life and my desire till even the least
[1:41:25] bit of his grieving, I'll know it in my
[1:41:28] heart. I should do something that I
[1:41:31] would grieve him, I'd be able to feel it
[1:41:33] in a moment." That's my prayer. Amen.
[1:41:37] that my prayer is that any little thing
[1:41:40] that I do to to hurt my God, I feel it
[1:41:43] in my heart.
[1:41:45] Oh, and then so that we can know the
[1:41:48] wings, the warmth, the breath of our
[1:41:51] Lord is still around us. I never want to
[1:41:54] feel that he's gone.
[1:41:57] I never want to feel like like, oh, God
[1:41:59] God is here yet he departed a long time
[1:42:02] ago. I never want to feel that. what you
[1:42:06] feel now. Cherish,
[1:42:09] cherish the pain. Cherish the
[1:42:12] convictions. Cherish the calling that
[1:42:15] God gives you. Don't use it as a curse.
[1:42:19] Say, "Thank you, Lord, that I'm still
[1:42:21] here. Thank you, Lord, that I'm still
[1:42:24] alive, that you're still calling me,
[1:42:27] that you're still
[1:42:29] asking for my repentance."
[1:42:34] If you'd like to stand and the P
[1:42:35] musicians come up, play something sweet.
[1:42:39] There's there's a story about a
[1:42:42] prospector how, you know, in the in the
[1:42:46] old uh I believe it was the early 1900s
[1:42:48] or in the 1800s where the there was the
[1:42:51] golden gold boom where everybody was
[1:42:54] mining, everybody was a prospector, and
[1:42:56] here's this man with his his faithful
[1:42:59] dog and he said, "You know what? I'm
[1:43:00] going to go and I'm going to strike it
[1:43:01] rich. I'm I I think I know exactly where
[1:43:04] to go. And he was there with his
[1:43:07] faithful dog. And every time his dog
[1:43:09] would see danger, if he would see a bear
[1:43:11] in the woods, it would tell him. And And
[1:43:13] they were just good friends, good
[1:43:16] buds. And there was this one time where
[1:43:20] finally all of his hard work paid off.
[1:43:23] He struck
[1:43:24] gold. And he said, "Finally." And he
[1:43:27] everything came rushing in his mind.
[1:43:30] Everything he would do. Oh, I'm gonna be
[1:43:32] the richest man in town. I'm gonna be
[1:43:34] this and I'm going to be that and and
[1:43:35] and he was so happy and he got all got
[1:43:40] found or he went back to his cabin and
[1:43:43] and and he began to celebrate and got
[1:43:45] drunk and and he said, "Oh, by tomorrow
[1:43:48] morning I'm going to be the richest man
[1:43:50] on
[1:43:51] town." And there is faithful dog there.
[1:43:55] him not knowing the whole time there was
[1:43:57] two men trailing him, watching him,
[1:44:01] ready to attack, ready once he struck
[1:44:05] gold, they were going to take everything
[1:44:07] he had and took his life. And as they
[1:44:11] were
[1:44:12] approaching, his dog, his faithful
[1:44:15] friend, began to bark, began to sound an
[1:44:19] alarm and begin to bark and bark and
[1:44:21] bark and bark. And and as he he was
[1:44:23] thinking of all the glories he would
[1:44:25] going to he was going to be in that that
[1:44:28] next day, he said, "Be quiet. Be quiet.
[1:44:32] I'm trying to enjoy myself here." The
[1:44:35] dog just kept barking and became an
[1:44:37] annoyance to him.
[1:44:40] Just think about it in our conscience.
[1:44:42] Think about the Holy
[1:44:44] Spirit. It became an annoyance. An
[1:44:47] annoyance. This faithful friend that
[1:44:49] took him through many
[1:44:51] dangers, helped him through many things
[1:44:54] that he could have he could have died
[1:44:55] in. Yet, he had his faithful dog. He had
[1:44:58] his faithful friend there. And now that
[1:45:00] he has everything, he's like, "I don't
[1:45:02] need you
[1:45:03] anymore. You keep bugging me. I don't
[1:45:06] need you. Why are you here? you I you
[1:45:09] were taking half of the food
[1:45:11] anyways. He gets a shotgun and he shoots
[1:45:14] the dog. He says, "Ah, there. Peace and
[1:45:17] quiet. I don't need him. I'm going to be
[1:45:19] the richest
[1:45:21] man." But that dog was telling him there
[1:45:25] was danger there. His faithful friend
[1:45:28] didn't care about the gold. Didn't know
[1:45:30] anything about all he was saying, "Watch
[1:45:33] out. Watch out. There's danger. There's
[1:45:35] danger. There's danger." and he killed
[1:45:37] his only thing that would help him. And
[1:45:40] those men took him, killed him, and took
[1:45:43] all of his
[1:45:45] gold. Brothers, that's the Holy Spirit
[1:45:47] today.
[1:45:50] He's our faithful
[1:45:52] friend. He's what calls us every single
[1:45:55] day when we're doing something wrong.
[1:45:57] When we go and hide and we do what we
[1:45:59] do, the Lord is calling.
[1:46:03] the Lord is is crying
[1:46:05] out when we don't want to listen to the
[1:46:08] Lord. He's the one. He's the faithful
[1:46:10] friend every single
[1:46:12] day. There's a there's a way if anybody
[1:46:15] has felt like they've they've seared
[1:46:18] their conscience. There's a way to sens
[1:46:20] reensitize your conscience. Hebrews
[1:46:23] 10:22, it says, "Let us draw near with a
[1:46:26] true heart full of assurance of faith."
[1:46:29] Who has a true heart full of assurance
[1:46:32] of faith? Who believes that God can
[1:46:34] restore them? Who believes that God can
[1:46:37] continue to work in their heart? He
[1:46:40] says, "Having our hearts sprinkled from
[1:46:43] an evil conscience and our bodies washed
[1:46:46] with pure
[1:46:48] water, every
[1:46:50] desire and every guilt will be washed
[1:46:54] away.
[1:46:56] If your conscience is evil, defiled,
[1:46:58] weak, or seared, God can come. We can
[1:47:02] come to the waters and he can
[1:47:05] restore to the point where we're in his
[1:47:08] presence. And those things that we were
[1:47:10] okay with, they become
[1:47:12] ugly. They become evil. And we begin to
[1:47:17] walk in his word. Walk in the Lord.
[1:47:21] I so thankful for the Lord that God
[1:47:24] always has a way out for
[1:47:26] us. Don't ever feel like there is no
[1:47:29] hope for you. Don't ever feel like your
[1:47:33] chance is
[1:47:34] gone. As long as you have breath in your
[1:47:37] lungs and a heart that is still beating,
[1:47:39] God is still
[1:47:40] calling. Maybe you're not sensitive to
[1:47:43] it yet, but ask the Lord and he will
[1:47:45] restore you back to that condition. Do
[1:47:49] you believe it? Amen. I believe it. Let
[1:47:51] us bow our
[1:47:52] heads. Heavenly
[1:47:55] Father, Lord, what a solemn moment,
[1:47:58] Father, to understand the the severity
[1:48:02] of our
[1:48:03] lives that it's just not eating and
[1:48:05] drinking and doing this and doing that
[1:48:07] and living life, going to work, but
[1:48:10] Father, there's a deeper meaning within
[1:48:13] all of
[1:48:14] this. That you are with us
[1:48:18] always, that you're there to protect us
[1:48:22] from evil.
[1:48:24] Whenever we're about to find ourselves
[1:48:25] in a bad situation, Lord, it's you
[1:48:29] there. When nobody's around, it's you
[1:48:33] there. When we're about to sin, it's you
[1:48:37] there. When nobody believes, but you do,
[1:48:40] it's you there. Praise God. I thank you,
[1:48:44] Lord, that you are there with us. Even
[1:48:47] if sometimes we feel like you're not, it
[1:48:50] doesn't matter what we feel, you are
[1:48:53] still there. You are not governed by my
[1:48:56] feeling. You are not governed by
[1:48:58] anything, but you are a sovereign God.
[1:49:00] And you are working in each and every
[1:49:02] person's life. And Lord, I ask that you
[1:49:05] make yourself known to them this
[1:49:08] morning. Let that little light shine and
[1:49:11] understand you're
[1:49:13] here. I thank you, Lord.
[1:49:17] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:49:19] Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. Let's just
[1:49:22] worship the Lord. Brother Daniel,
[1:49:26] create in me a
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:34] cleaner,
[1:49:36] oh God.
[1:49:41] and renew arise
[1:49:44] spirit within me.
[1:49:48] [Music]
[1:49:53] Create in me a clean
[1:49:58] [Music]
[1:50:00] heart, oh
[1:50:06] God, and renew a right
[1:50:10] spirit
[1:50:11] within me.
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:18] Cast me
[1:50:20] not
[1:50:22] away from thy
[1:50:26] presence, oh
[1:50:29] Lord, and
[1:50:31] take not thy holy spirit from
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:42] me.
[1:50:44] Restore unto
[1:50:48] me the joy of thy
[1:50:52] [Music]
[1:50:55] salvation and renew a right
[1:50:59] spirit within me.
[1:51:05] That feeling that we get when we do
[1:51:09] wrong, there's that inner voice that
[1:51:12] speaks to us, says you shouldn't have
[1:51:14] done that or don't do
[1:51:17] that. And as our brother said, that
[1:51:20] voice doesn't stop us from doing
[1:51:23] it. We make the decision. I'm am I going
[1:51:26] to listen to my conscience or I'm going
[1:51:29] am I going to go ahead and sin? And then
[1:51:33] when I
[1:51:34] sin after I've done it, am I going to
[1:51:37] listen to my conscience that says you
[1:51:39] need to make that
[1:51:40] right or am I going to go ahead and
[1:51:44] silent that voice? There will come a
[1:51:46] time that that voice will not speak
[1:51:49] anymore. There'll come a time when that
[1:51:52] conscience
[1:51:53] won't respond to sin and won't respond
[1:51:58] to doing wrong. And brothers and
[1:52:00] sisters, let's never cross that
[1:52:04] line. We all sin. We sin every day. But
[1:52:09] we also have a conscience conscience
[1:52:12] that tells us you shouldn't have done
[1:52:14] that. Make it right. Don't silent that
[1:52:17] voice, friends. Never silent it. Listen
[1:52:21] to
[1:52:22] it. Obey it. When it says change your
[1:52:27] way of doing things, change your life,
[1:52:31] follow that voice, follow what it says.
[1:52:34] Amen. Amen. Do you appreciate our
[1:52:37] brother Eli?
[1:52:38] [Applause]
[1:52:45] I got to
[1:52:47] admit, past few
[1:52:50] days as he was talking, I got to say,
[1:52:52] you know, I need to make that right. I
[1:52:54] probably should confess that and yeah, I
[1:52:58] should probably make that right. And
[1:53:00] yeah, I need to do that one, too. Over
[1:53:02] and over and over again. It's like, but
[1:53:05] but don't you feel good about that voice
[1:53:07] that tells you it feels good to say, you
[1:53:11] know what, I was wrong. There's
[1:53:13] something about saying I'm sorry that
[1:53:16] just kind of wipes it all away and and
[1:53:19] then just that love of the Holy Spirit
[1:53:22] enters back in.
[1:53:24] Amen. Amen. Daniel, you got another one
[1:53:26] for
[1:53:29] [Music]
[1:53:33] us?
[1:53:36] Amazing
[1:53:37] grace, how
[1:53:40] sweet the
[1:53:43] son that
[1:53:46] saved a
[1:53:48] rich like
[1:53:53] me. I
[1:53:55] once was
[1:53:58] lost, but
[1:54:01] now I'm
[1:54:03] found. Was
[1:54:05] blind, but
[1:54:08] now I see.
[1:54:14] It was
[1:54:15] grace that
[1:54:18] taught my
[1:54:21] heart to
[1:54:23] fear. And
[1:54:26] grace my
[1:54:28] fears
[1:54:33] relie. And how
[1:54:36] preious
[1:54:38] did that
[1:54:41] grace
[1:54:43] appear the
[1:54:45] hour I
[1:54:48] first
[1:54:53] believe was
[1:54:55] grace that taught my
[1:54:59] heart to fear
[1:55:03] and
[1:55:04] grace my
[1:55:07] fears
[1:55:09] [Music]
[1:55:11] freely. How
[1:55:14] preious
[1:55:16] did that
[1:55:18] grace
[1:55:21] appear the
[1:55:23] hour I
[1:55:26] first believe.
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:32] Amen.
[1:55:34] [Music]
[1:55:35] Amen. He said the check engine light
[1:55:39] comes
[1:55:40] on in our lives. You know, when that
[1:55:43] check engine light comes on in the
[1:55:44] vehicle, it's like, "Oh, man.
[1:55:46] Something's
[1:55:47] wrong." That's our conscience, brothers
[1:55:49] and sisters. That check engine light
[1:55:50] comes on, it's it's not a check engine
[1:55:52] light, it's a check your soul light. And
[1:55:55] that comes on, don't ignore it. as so
[1:55:58] many us of us do it with our cars. Don't
[1:56:00] ignore that because it means there's
[1:56:01] something not firing right. There's
[1:56:03] something wrong. Let's bow our heads.
[1:56:05] Our heavenly father, we are
[1:56:09] grateful. Lord, thank you for a
[1:56:11] conscience that we all have.
[1:56:15] Thank you, Father, that that you would
[1:56:17] place
[1:56:18] that down deep in our
[1:56:22] souls that the Holy Spirit could speak
[1:56:26] to us even in a even even if we're not
[1:56:29] where we should be with you, Lord. Even
[1:56:33] if we're we're found in sin or if we're
[1:56:36] found doing things that are just wrong,
[1:56:38] Lord, that there is a conscience that
[1:56:41] speaks to us and tells us you need to
[1:56:45] get right. We thank you for that,
[1:56:48] Father. And if there would be someone
[1:56:51] here in this congregation today that
[1:56:54] that light is
[1:56:56] on and something needs to be done,
[1:56:59] something needs to be corrected. Father,
[1:57:02] I pray for that person or those people
[1:57:05] that you would have your way in their
[1:57:06] life, Lord, that you would give them
[1:57:09] strength and give them the courage,
[1:57:11] Father, to change and make things
[1:57:14] right. Help all of us, Father, for all
[1:57:17] of us sin that comes short of the glory
[1:57:21] of God.
[1:57:23] And Lord, we are grateful that there is
[1:57:25] a guiding
[1:57:27] spirit that takes us away from our sins
[1:57:30] and points us in the right direction.
[1:57:32] Now Lord, let us just follow that
[1:57:33] guiding light. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:57:37] pray.
[1:57:38] Amen. One more song, buddy, before we
[1:57:41] dismiss.
[1:57:42] Chains are
[1:57:45] gone. I've been set free.

[1:57:52] savior, your brethren on
[1:57:56] me. And like a
[1:58:00] flood, his mercy
[1:58:04] reigns, unending
[1:58:07] love, amazing
[1:58:12] grace. And the
[1:58:14] Lord has
[1:58:16] promised good to
[1:58:19] me. His word my hope
[1:58:27] secures. He will my
[1:58:31] shield and
[1:58:34] portion as long as life ends.
[1:58:41] My chains are
[1:58:44] gone. I've been set
[1:58:47] free. My God, my
[1:58:51] savior rest on
[1:58:54] me. And like a
[1:58:58] flood, his mercy
[1:59:01] reign unending
[1:59:05] love. Amazing
[1:59:09] grace. And the earth shall soon
[1:59:15] dissolve like
[1:59:17] snow. The
[1:59:19] sun for bear to
[1:59:24] shine. The God who called me here
[1:59:31] below will be
[1:59:35] forever
[1:59:37] mine. My chains are
[1:59:41] gone. I've been set free.
[1:59:46] My God, my
[1:59:49] savior res
[1:59:52] me in life of
[1:59:55] love. His mercy
[1:59:59] reigns, unending
[2:00:02] love, amazing
[2:00:06] grace. Amen and amen. Praise God. He is
[2:00:11] good. He is so good.

[2:00:33] with you about, you're welcome to come
[2:00:36] forward after I
[2:00:37] dismiss and uh bring it before the Lord
[2:00:41] in prayer. We'll have tonight we won't
[2:00:44] have our normal service. We're going to
[2:00:46] just a prayer service. Tonight we'll
[2:00:47] sing some songs. I'll say a few words
[2:00:51] and then we will do the most important
[2:00:55] thing in a Christian
[2:00:58] life. We will go before our Lord and our
[2:01:01] Savior in prayer. We'll take about 30
[2:01:04] minutes of quiet prayer before the Lord
[2:01:07] this evening. You're welcome to come.
[2:01:10] Thank you all for being here this
[2:01:11] morning. May God be with you and take
[2:01:13] care of you and guide you. You're
[2:01:16] [Music]
[2:01:20] dismissed. And
[2:01:22] I was a
[2:01:24] wretch. I remember who I
[2:01:28] was. I was
[2:01:30] lost. I was
[2:01:32] blind. I was running out of time.
[2:01:37] [Music]
[2:01:39] Sin
[2:01:41] separated. The breach was far too
[2:01:44] wide. But from the far side of the
[2:01:49] chasm, you held me in your
[2:01:53] sight. So
[2:01:55] you made a
[2:01:57] way across the great divide.
[2:02:02] left
[2:02:03] behind heaven's
[2:02:05] throne to build it here
[2:02:09] inside. And there at the
[2:02:13] cross, you paid the debt I
[2:02:17] owe. Broke my chains, freed my soul. For
[2:02:22] the first time I had hope.
[2:02:26] So thank you Jesus for the
[2:02:31] blood
[2:02:33] applied. And thank you Jesus. It has
[2:02:38] washed me
[2:02:40] white. And thank you Jesus. You have
[2:02:45] saved my
[2:02:50] life. You brought me from the darkness
[2:02:54] into
[2:02:56] glorious
[2:02:59] light. And you took my place, laid
[2:03:04] inside my tomb, a sin.
[2:03:08] You were buried for 3 days, but then you
[2:03:12] walked right out
[2:03:14] again. Now death has no
[2:03:18] sting and life has no
[2:03:22] end. For I have been
[2:03:25] transformed by the blood of the lamb.
[2:03:30] So thank you Jesus for the blood
[2:03:37] applied. Thank you Jesus. You have
[2:03:42] washed me
[2:03:44] white. And thank you Jesus. You have
[2:03:49] saved my
[2:03:53] life and brought me from the darkness
[2:03:57] into
[2:03:58] glorious
[2:04:02] light. And there is nothing stronger
[2:04:06] than the wonder working power of the
[2:04:10] blood.
[2:04:13] The
[2:04:15] blood that calls us sons and daughters.
[2:04:20] We are ransom by our fathers through the
[2:04:26] blood. The
[2:04:29] blood. And there is nothing stronger
[2:04:34] than the
[2:04:35] wonderworking power of the blood.
[2:04:41] The
[2:04:43] blood that calls us sons and daughters.
[2:04:48] We are ransom by our fathers through the
[2:04:53] blood. The
[2:04:57] blood. Thank you Jesus for the
[2:05:02] blood
[2:05:04] applied. Thank you Jesus. It has washed
[2:05:10] me
[2:05:11] white. And thank you Jesus. You have
[2:05:16] saved my
[2:05:20] life. You brought me from the darkness
[2:05:24] into
[2:05:26] glorious light.
