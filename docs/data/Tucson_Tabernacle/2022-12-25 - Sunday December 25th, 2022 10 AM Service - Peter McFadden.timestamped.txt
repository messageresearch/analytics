[19:55] Lord Jesus father is
[20:00] the brother
[20:02] greeted you this morning and he
[20:05] mentions that great Resurrection
[20:09] that's what made the difference Lord
[20:13] was that great Resurrection
[20:16] we worship you for how you were brought
[20:20] into this world
[20:22] we worship you for the life you lived
[20:27] the atonement you provided for all of us
[20:29] in this actually for the sins of the
[20:33] world we're grateful for that
[20:37] but it's that great resurrection power
[20:39] that's inside of our heart
[20:43] is allowing us to worship you with
[20:46] revelation
[20:48] foreign

[21:02] as you offer yourself
[21:04] [Music]
[21:06] to us we want to offer ourselves to you
[21:09] this morning
[21:12] we could think of no better prayer
[21:17] than to
[21:19] ask you to help us to open up all the
[21:22] doors that are in our heart this morning
[21:25] every single one
[21:28] we'd ask that that great resurrection
[21:30] power would be upon the speaker
[21:34] but that that same anointing would be on
[21:37] the audience
[21:39] and that together you would be able to
[21:41] accomplish your will here on Earth
[21:45] as it is in heaven that's our reason for
[21:48] being here and so that you can change us
[21:51] Lord and so that you could make us Lord
[21:55] be fulfilled the purpose that you've
[21:58] given us
[22:00] would you do that Lord we would be so
[22:05] joyful and happy if you would accomplish
[22:07] that this morning that's what we want
[22:11] we thank you for the stripes you took
[22:14] for these requests for healing
[22:19] we're mindful of the pain you must have
[22:22] suffered
[22:24] for these
[22:25] two requests in particular which are
[22:27] spoken
[22:29] and those that are unspoken in the
[22:31] audience
[22:32] for Divine Healing
[22:35] as we pray this prayer Lord would you go
[22:38] and anoint the faith that's in the heart
[22:41] of the people
[22:44] to move under the anointing of those
[22:47] stripes that you provided
[22:51] would you do that Lord
[22:54] and Lord finally we just want to
[22:57] conclude this prayer Lord in the name of
[23:01] the Lord Jesus Christ and would you help
[23:04] us all of us
[23:05] to give ourselves to you this morning
[23:08] and to let you change us from the inside

[23:16] would do that in the name
[23:18] of Jesus Christ we ask this favor amen

[42:29] this is Isaiah 40 chapter Isaiah chapter
[42:32] 40 verse 1 come for ye
[42:35] come for ye my people saith your God
[42:39] speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem
[42:42] and cry unto her
[42:44] that her Warfare is accomplished
[42:47] and her iniquity is pardoned
[42:50] for she is received of the Lord's hand
[42:52] double for all her sins
[42:54] the voice of him that crieth in the
[42:56] wilderness
[42:58] prepare you the way of the Lord
[43:00] make straight in the desert a highway
[43:02] for our God
[43:04] every Valley shall be exalted and every
[43:06] mountain and Hill shall be made low
[43:08] and the Crooked shall be made straight
[43:10] and the rough place is playing
[43:13] and the glory of the Lord shall be
[43:15] revealed and All Flesh shall see it
[43:17] together for the mouth of the Lord hath
[43:19] spoken it amen and let's while you're
[43:22] standing also go to the Book of Matthew
[43:29] and we'll read chapter 2 and verse 11 in
[43:32] the Book of Matthew
[43:44] and when they were come into the house
[43:47] they saw the young child with Mary his
[43:50] mother
[43:51] and fell down and worshiped him
[43:53] and when they'd opened the treasures
[43:56] they presented unto him gifts gold and
[43:59] frankincense and myrrh hey man you may
[44:02] be seated
[44:13] this is a little bit different of a
[44:15] morning for me and so let me just say a
[44:19] few things and then we'll just preach
[44:22] okay so we'll just take a minute here
[44:26] and just say a few things
[44:28] um and the first thing that I like to
[44:30] say is
[44:33] if there's any sort of perception that
[44:35] what's going on here
[44:37] is me versus brother Daniel
[44:40] that's false that's of the devil that's
[44:42] not the way it is but the Daniels my
[44:44] brother and I believe that he would call
[44:46] me his brother and we just both want the
[44:49] Lord's will and we want to see I believe
[44:52] uh
[44:54] each one here and those that aren't here
[44:56] prosper and draw near to God and be
[44:59] filled with the Holy Ghost and so
[45:01] wherever that voice wherever that
[45:04] feeling would come in that oh there's
[45:06] this there's this politicking there's
[45:09] this campaign there's this you know
[45:11] who's who's gonna who's gonna you know
[45:13] step up and who's gonna step down
[45:16] we're all here to exalt the Lord Jesus
[45:19] to lift him up and the only way that can
[45:21] happen is if it were all step down
[45:23] humble ourselves and and come on our
[45:26] knees to the foot of the cross
[45:28] and so just let's let's kill that right
[45:31] now that that's sort of a spirit of of
[45:34] conflict and emulations that's not
[45:37] what's going on here
[45:39] um the other thing that I like to just
[45:41] say real quick
[45:44] um
[45:46] I approved the way that the the
[45:48] announcement was was written and at the
[45:49] time I thought it was
[45:52] you know exactly right and then just
[45:54] some some little things that maybe I the
[45:57] more that I thought about I thought a
[45:59] little bit differently and one of them
[46:01] is that in the announcement it said that
[46:03] I would present my vision for the church
[46:04] if I'm elected pastor
[46:07] and first off
[46:10] we're gonna have a vote for brother
[46:11] Daniel first so don't even don't even
[46:13] think of me until we get there and and
[46:15] just
[46:16] um
[46:17] just keep me in your prayers but um
[46:21] what I'm going to preach today I'm not
[46:23] going to preach and then give a vision
[46:25] I'm just gonna preach and in there I
[46:29] believe you'll see my heart and you'll
[46:30] see what my vision is
[46:31] so I'm not gonna you know split this up
[46:34] but I'm just gonna preach the word of
[46:36] God and I believe you'll see my heart
[46:38] and you'll see what I'm what I'm looking
[46:40] to
[46:42] um and the other thing is that this
[46:45] isn't my vision if I become pastor but
[46:48] this is just what I believe that the
[46:50] Lord's shown me for today
[46:53] and what I believe would be good and
[46:54] helpful for us as a body as a group of
[46:58] people seeking the Lord Jesus Christ and
[47:01] so this isn't um copyrighted this is
[47:03] mine and and brother Daniel can have
[47:05] this this is just what I believe is true
[47:07] and I believe it's true whoever's pastor
[47:10] and I believe that
[47:12] every word in here is yea and amen and
[47:15] it's all good and it's not well these
[47:17] are my scriptures and these are your
[47:18] scriptures but no let's let's just take
[47:20] all this book and let's Worship the Lord
[47:23] Jesus let's do our best just to to let
[47:26] this word this Living Word have the
[47:28] preeminence
[47:30] so
[47:32] now that's out of the way let's just
[47:34] have church let's just preach let's just
[47:36] look to the Lord Jesus and
[47:39] um
[47:40] this maybe is a little bit of a
[47:41] different kind of Christmas message
[47:46] but
[47:47] I've been thinking
[47:49] a lot about this myrrh that the wise men
[47:52] brought
[47:53] and so I was really encouraged when I
[47:55] talked to brother Ed in the back and he
[47:57] talked about these wise men these
[47:59] Magi Magi I don't know how you say it
[48:02] but
[48:03] they brought these gifts to the Lord
[48:06] Jesus and even as a young child one of
[48:10] the gifts that they brought him was this
[48:12] myrrh
[48:13] This Bitter perfume
[48:16] this prophecy of a death to come
[48:20] and
[48:23] and so
[48:24] I I thought about being real real punny
[48:27] and saying well this isn't a Merry
[48:28] Christmas this is a Murray Christmas but
[48:33] I don't want to be jokey I want to be
[48:35] sincere
[48:36] and myrrh is not you know a jokey
[48:39] lighthearted subject but it's death
[48:42] it's the way that they get myrrh it's
[48:45] it's this ointment that comes from a
[48:47] tree that it's not something that you
[48:49] know falls down from the North Pole with
[48:51] Christmas elves and Jingle Bells but the
[48:53] way that they get Myrrh is there's this
[48:55] tree that in the tree is healing for the
[48:58] tree there's this this sap this life
[49:01] blood of the tree is to keep the tree
[49:04] healthy and to keep the tree alive
[49:06] and this sap is for the tree
[49:08] and what they do is they come and they
[49:11] wound this tree they'll come and they'll
[49:13] drive spikes into it
[49:15] they'll cut it
[49:18] and that healing comes out
[49:21] what's inside comes out when you're
[49:23] wounded when you when somebody strikes
[49:25] you you find out what's inside
[49:28] how do you scream out
[49:30] do you scream out oh let Fire come down
[49:33] from heaven on you
[49:34] or do you say father forgive them
[49:37] they don't know what they're doing
[49:40] and this tree something about this tree
[49:42] something about the healing that's in
[49:43] this tree when it's wounded and when
[49:45] it's injured that comes out
[49:50] and other people can take it and they
[49:51] can use it and
[49:53] and it's got medicinal purposes and it's
[49:55] got good fragrance
[49:57] because this this tree was wounded and
[49:59] what comes out from it
[50:01] now can be used to help others this
[50:03] healing that was for the tree now it's
[50:05] for others
[50:07] and so
[50:08] I believe that as we look to this Lamb
[50:11] of God that takes away the sins of the
[50:13] world
[50:16] we a lot of times around this time of
[50:18] year we just like to look at at the baby
[50:20] side of things and just the the cute and
[50:24] the nice and happy side of things but
[50:27] when our lord Jesus was born he was born
[50:29] to die
[50:31] he came into this world to to destroy
[50:33] the works of the devil
[50:35] and he came to do that by offering
[50:38] giving himself as an offering for sin
[50:41] you can get this idea that he was just
[50:44] this
[50:47] you know just this good man that they
[50:49] came and killed and there's a truth to
[50:51] that but more than just this good man
[50:54] that was killed he said no man could
[50:56] take my life from me but I lay it down
[50:59] I give it it wasn't just that he was
[51:01] going around doing good and they snuck
[51:03] up and killed him but no his entire
[51:05] purpose his entire reason that he came
[51:08] was to lay his life down
[51:11] to give his life for you and me that in
[51:14] this world though we have tribulation we
[51:16] can have joy
[51:17] in the good times and the bad times and
[51:19] in the Happy Times the dark times when
[51:22] it's when it's night that we can say Oh
[51:25] Our Savior came and gave us life eternal
[51:29] he gave us a way
[51:32] but the way that he'd given us
[51:35] is the way that he walked
[51:37] and so he didn't come and and live in
[51:40] one way and then say okay now just
[51:43] um
[51:44] sing some happy songs and and I'm
[51:47] getting a little bit of feedback so
[51:48] maybe I just need to speak up I'll try
[51:50] to speak up a little bit
[51:52] um
[51:53] but he called us to follow him
[51:56] he called us to live this way that when
[52:00] we're born again of the spirit
[52:03] the gift that would be appropriate would
[52:05] be myrrh for us as well
[52:08] that we're born of the spirit to lay
[52:10] down our lives for one another that we
[52:12] could have such love for our friends
[52:13] that
[52:14] see my death
[52:16] is is not the sort of Redemptive death
[52:20] of the Son of God Jesus Christ when I
[52:23] lay my life down there's not that same
[52:26] atonement that can be made
[52:29] but
[52:30] if we'll lay our lives down one for
[52:32] another
[52:35] that's part of God's plan
[52:37] that's part of the way that this healing
[52:41] blood of Jesus Christ that now flows in
[52:43] our veins that's part of how this this
[52:46] life is expressed out
[52:48] that the people that are out there they
[52:50] need this life and
[52:53] unless the tree is wounded
[52:55] they can't come out
[52:58] it'll just stay inside and we'll have
[53:01] good for us you know good good life good
[53:04] healing
[53:06] but this was given to us that it it can
[53:08] go out from us
[53:11] that we can be the light of the world
[53:12] and so I want to read Isaiah 54 or 53
[53:19] and I've got a lot of scriptures to just
[53:21] pull and pray the Lord help us because I
[53:24] was thinking last night well this could
[53:25] be my first four-hour sermon and then I
[53:28] don't know uh I don't know how many
[53:30] friends I would have after that so let's
[53:32] just trust the Lord and believe that
[53:34] he'll help us today but Isaiah 53
[53:38] if I have a vision
[53:43] I pray that it's always a vision of
[53:45] Jesus Christ
[53:49] and he's the same yesterday today and
[53:52] forever
[53:54] and so if I have a vision maybe it would
[53:57] be this
[53:59] Isaiah 53
[54:01] says who hath believed our report
[54:05] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[54:06] revealed
[54:08] for he shall grow up before him as a
[54:10] tender plant
[54:12] and as a root out of a dry ground
[54:15] he has no form nor comeliness
[54:19] and when we shall see him there is no
[54:21] Beauty
[54:22] that we should desire him
[54:27] this gospel is in the gospel of outward
[54:29] Beauty
[54:31] we can twist it and make it beautiful
[54:33] and and make it
[54:35] hip and and cool
[54:39] but this man Jesus Christ
[54:42] when you really see him there's no
[54:44] Beauty there
[54:46] outwardly
[54:48] there's an inner beauty of holiness
[54:52] but he is despised
[54:54] and rejected of men
[54:57] a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
[54:59] grief
[55:01] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[55:05] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[55:10] and so when you say
[55:12] I want to follow this Lord Jesus I want
[55:14] to be a Christian I want to to go and
[55:17] walk in his footsteps
[55:21] you can only walk in those footsteps if
[55:23] you become like him
[55:26] if you take his nature these steps are
[55:29] not footsteps that can be walked with
[55:30] our old human nature
[55:33] but to walk to follow after him
[55:36] we must become this
[55:39] we must live in such a way that we're
[55:41] despised and rejected of men
[55:44] we must become men and women of Sorrows
[55:46] and acquainted with grief
[55:50] we all want to get to Easter we all want
[55:52] to get to Resurrection and we all want
[55:54] to get to Pentecost
[55:57] but the road there leaves leads to
[56:00] Gethsemane
[56:01] leads to Calvary
[56:05] and if we would want our lives to be
[56:08] good lives if we want our church to be a
[56:11] good church where people can be healed
[56:12] and people can receive what they need
[56:15] it's not going to come without a
[56:18] sacrifice
[56:20] without a dying to ourselves without a
[56:23] crucifixion of this flesh
[56:30] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[56:32] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[56:34] him smitten they're stricken smitten of
[56:36] God and afflicted
[56:38] but he was wounded for our
[56:39] transgressions
[56:41] he was bruised for our iniquities
[56:43] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[56:45] him and with his stripes we are healed
[56:49] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[56:51] have turned everyone to his own way and
[56:53] the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[56:55] of us all
[56:57] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[57:00] yet he opened not his mouth
[57:04] to that nature of Christ
[57:07] the ability to keep quiet
[57:10] sometimes that takes all the character
[57:12] in the world
[57:13] just to keep quiet
[57:16] did he opened not his mouth he was
[57:18] brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[57:21] and as a sheep before his sheer her
[57:23] shears is dumb so he opened on his mouth
[57:28] see the one thing we're in this time of
[57:30] sheep and goats right sheep and goats
[57:32] they're eating the same thing
[57:35] but a sheep will be led of the spirit of
[57:37] God to the slaughter
[57:39] the Sheep will go there a goat might go
[57:41] a little way and it's going to jump out
[57:43] of the chute
[57:44] he's not going to go all the way
[57:46] but that nature of a lamb that's the
[57:48] only nature that that Dove of the Holy
[57:50] Ghost will come and stay on
[57:53] that nature of a dove of a lamb will go
[57:56] all the way
[57:57] lay his life down
[58:00] he was taken from prison and from
[58:02] judgment
[58:03] and who shall declare his generation he
[58:05] was cut off from the land of the living
[58:07] for the transgression of my people was
[58:10] he stricken
[58:12] and he made his grave with the wicked
[58:14] and with the rich in his death
[58:16] because he had done no violence neither
[58:18] was any deceit in his mouth
[58:21] she when we're reading this we're
[58:23] reading this about the Messiah
[58:25] but we're reading this as what we must
[58:27] become
[58:29] that let it be said of us
[58:32] there's no deceit in their mouth
[58:34] whatever we say Let It Be True Let It Be
[58:37] genuine there's the spirit that you know
[58:40] I have to fight this this joking and
[58:41] this Folly and this Frolic and just say
[58:44] something because it it was good for the
[58:46] moment
[58:49] but let us be lovers of the truth
[58:53] lovers of the truth when it's on our
[58:55] side and lovers of the truth when it
[58:58] cuts us like a knife
[59:01] let there be no deceit found in our
[59:03] mouth
[59:05] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him
[59:11] he hath put him to grief
[59:14] when he shall make his soul an offer him
[59:17] for sin he shall see his seed
[59:20] any of his seat here this morning he
[59:22] sees you
[59:24] he knows you he's not forgotten you
[59:27] should prolong his days and the pleasure
[59:29] of the Lord shall prosper in his hand
[59:31] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[59:34] shall be satisfied
[59:35] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[59:37] servant justify many
[59:40] any Justified today
[59:42] how did that come was it just through
[59:44] good preaching
[59:46] just through
[59:49] you know some some superficial love
[59:52] know our justification came through that
[59:54] awful day on Calvary
[59:56] to that terrible sacrifice
[59:59] for us
[1:00:02] he should bear their iniquities
[1:00:06] and if we're his children will bear one
[1:00:09] another's burdens yes when one of us
[1:00:12] sins we won't just condemn them be quick
[1:00:13] to write them off and condemn them
[1:00:16] but will restore such a wonder and a
[1:00:18] spirit of meekness
[1:00:20] we don't just bear each other's burdens
[1:00:22] as you know
[1:00:24] just in the physical
[1:00:26] but if there's a spiritual need Among Us
[1:00:28] if there's somebody that's got a wrong
[1:00:30] Spirit see Jesus even turned to Peter
[1:00:33] and he said get thee behind me Satan
[1:00:36] sometimes you'll see in your brother or
[1:00:38] sister say well that's the devil
[1:00:41] you get ready just uh all right I'm
[1:00:43] gonna cut your head off I'm going to
[1:00:44] feed you to the birds right
[1:00:48] but no Jesus loved Peter
[1:00:51] he prayed for Peter
[1:00:53] let's be that way
[1:00:55] when you see iniquity in your brother
[1:00:57] your sister
[1:00:59] say oh God please help them to see it
[1:01:02] how can I lay my life down
[1:01:05] more that they can see you
[1:01:08] how can I provoke them to love and good
[1:01:10] works
[1:01:13] therefore
[1:01:15] because of this
[1:01:17] because of all those things that came
[1:01:19] before this
[1:01:21] therefore I will divide him a portion
[1:01:23] with degree
[1:01:25] you want to portion with the Great
[1:01:28] here's the map
[1:01:31] here's the way
[1:01:36] and he shall divide the store spoil with
[1:01:38] the strong
[1:01:39] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[1:01:42] death
[1:01:43] are we willing to do that
[1:01:46] to pour out our soul unto death
[1:01:51] and he was numbered with the
[1:01:52] transgressor transgressors
[1:01:56] and bear the sin of many
[1:01:58] and made intercession for the
[1:01:59] transgressors
[1:02:03] sometimes we've even just got to let
[1:02:06] ourselves look like the bad guy
[1:02:09] just be numbered with the transgressors
[1:02:12] we don't have to go fight for our
[1:02:14] you know make sure our reputation stays
[1:02:16] good
[1:02:17] if they spit on us if they hate us
[1:02:21] than to do the same to our Lord
[1:02:26] we don't have to go and and plead our
[1:02:28] own cause but vengeance is mine says the
[1:02:31] Lord
[1:02:32] he'll recompense he'll fight for us
[1:02:37] but we've got to be
[1:02:39] like that Lamb of God
[1:02:41] that's the only way that I see forward
[1:02:43] and and I'd love to see a church that
[1:02:46] just filled with the Holy Ghost and on
[1:02:48] fire and and just
[1:02:51] people coming to the altar people coming
[1:02:53] to be saved and coming to be healed
[1:02:58] but I think this is the way there
[1:03:02] is that we've got to get sincere
[1:03:05] we've got to get humble
[1:03:08] and I believe I was looking I couldn't
[1:03:11] find it
[1:03:13] but I believe I've heard that I believe
[1:03:16] I've heard it said that we've gone as
[1:03:17] far as we're going to go with God until
[1:03:19] we're willing to to pay a greater
[1:03:21] sacrifice
[1:03:23] so we'll be willing to be like Samson
[1:03:26] and just say
[1:03:29] let me now die with my enemies
[1:03:33] but let your name be glorified
[1:03:35] and just willing to bring down the whole
[1:03:37] thing though it cost us our death
[1:03:41] that there could be victory for the
[1:03:43] Lord's people
[1:03:48] and that's the only way that I see
[1:03:49] forward
[1:03:52] in John chapter 12
[1:03:54] and verse 20
[1:03:57] we know that there were certain Greeks
[1:03:59] among them
[1:04:00] Where She Came To Worship at the feast
[1:04:03] the same came there for the Philip
[1:04:06] which was the which was of bethsaida of
[1:04:08] Galilee and desired him saying sir we
[1:04:11] would see Jesus
[1:04:13] and really every person that you meet
[1:04:17] whether they know it or not
[1:04:20] that's what they're looking for
[1:04:23] they're looking for
[1:04:24] what we claim to have
[1:04:27] what we sing about what we come and and
[1:04:30] say that our lives is all about
[1:04:32] they're coming in there saying
[1:04:35] we would like to see him
[1:04:37] is it true is there any anything to this
[1:04:40] is it all just talk and smoke and
[1:04:42] mirrors
[1:04:45] when somebody comes in these doors
[1:04:48] they're not coming I hope to to see and
[1:04:51] hear us but they're coming to see Jesus
[1:04:55] and that's the only thing that'll help
[1:04:56] them
[1:04:57] not the best of our intentions and the
[1:04:59] best of our wisdom and the best of our
[1:05:01] programming and organization
[1:05:05] but if they can see Jesus they can be
[1:05:07] changed
[1:05:08] they could be set free
[1:05:11] and they can walk a newness of life
[1:05:16] and Philip cometh and telleth Andrew and
[1:05:18] again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus
[1:05:22] and Jesus answered them
[1:05:24] saying the hour has come that the son of
[1:05:28] man should be glorified
[1:05:30] they're thinking oh good
[1:05:32] this this sounds nice we've been waiting
[1:05:34] for this
[1:05:38] he says verily verily I say unto you
[1:05:42] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:05:44] ground and die
[1:05:46] that abideth alone
[1:05:48] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[1:05:51] fruit
[1:05:53] that was true then and it's true now
[1:05:56] that if we want to see spiritual growth
[1:05:58] and we want to see people added to the
[1:06:00] kingdom
[1:06:01] it's not enough just to be wheat
[1:06:04] say well I've got I've got it all
[1:06:06] you know I'm pure perfect wheat
[1:06:10] got it all figured out I've got the
[1:06:12] right spirit and everything
[1:06:16] unless that fall into the ground and die
[1:06:19] that abides alone
[1:06:24] and so
[1:06:26] if that's all we want
[1:06:29] it's just too bad alone
[1:06:32] then carry on we're okay
[1:06:38] but if we want to see God multiply this
[1:06:40] seed
[1:06:42] and we want to see our loved ones
[1:06:45] receive what we've been given
[1:06:48] it's not going to happen unless we die
[1:06:52] unless we lay down our lives
[1:06:54] if Jesus
[1:06:56] didn't have a way around this how can we
[1:07:00] if the Son of God the perfect sinless
[1:07:02] one
[1:07:04] needed to die
[1:07:09] how can we be as followers and just
[1:07:13] walking
[1:07:15] not go to Calvary
[1:07:19] he says he that loveth his life shall
[1:07:21] lose it
[1:07:22] and he that hateth his life in this
[1:07:24] world shall keep it unto life eternal
[1:07:28] If any man
[1:07:30] serve me let him follow me
[1:07:32] and where I am there shall also my
[1:07:36] servant be If any man serve me him will
[1:07:39] my father honor
[1:07:41] now is my soul troubled
[1:07:44] foreign
[1:07:47] what you're hearing in this Bible
[1:07:50] if it never troubles your soul
[1:07:55] maybe you need some ice to have
[1:07:57] because these words
[1:08:00] they cut Like a Knife
[1:08:02] they cut away things from your life that
[1:08:04] you thought were part of you
[1:08:06] but they're not part of you
[1:08:07] and it it hurts and it's uncomfortable
[1:08:10] and
[1:08:12] it's supposed to be that way
[1:08:13] it has to be that way
[1:08:16] we can never be formed into His Image if
[1:08:19] we're not willing to let go
[1:08:20] the way that we are
[1:08:24] my soul is troubled and what shall I say
[1:08:27] father save me from this hour
[1:08:31] is that is that our prayer no there's
[1:08:33] got to be some other way
[1:08:35] save us from this
[1:08:37] but for this cause came I into this hour
[1:08:41] that's why we were born of the spirit
[1:08:44] that's why we're here
[1:08:46] father glorify thy name
[1:08:49] Lord take me through Gethsemane don't
[1:08:52] take me to Calvary
[1:08:53] they'll have to lay down everything in
[1:08:55] my life
[1:08:56] father glorify thy name
[1:09:00] and there came also a voice from Heaven
[1:09:02] saying I have both glorified it and will
[1:09:04] glorify it again
[1:09:12] and the people therefore that stood by
[1:09:15] and heard it said that it thundered
[1:09:17] others said of angels speak to him Jesus
[1:09:20] answered and said this voice came not
[1:09:22] because of me but for your sakes
[1:09:25] this isn't just for the Lord Jesus this
[1:09:27] is for our sakes
[1:09:30] now is the Judgment of this world now
[1:09:33] shall the prince of this world be cast
[1:09:34] out that's what I want to have happen
[1:09:36] here is I want every Antichrist Spirit
[1:09:38] every Spirit that's not
[1:09:41] magnifying the Lord Jesus let's cast it
[1:09:43] out
[1:09:46] in my life let's cast it out
[1:09:50] everything that would bring hatred and
[1:09:52] strife
[1:09:53] let's cast it out
[1:09:58] but here's what I wanted to get to in
[1:09:59] verse 32.
[1:10:01] he says and I if I be lifted up from the
[1:10:04] Earth
[1:10:05] will draw all men unto me
[1:10:12] if we want to bring people to Lord Jesus
[1:10:16] we must lift him up
[1:10:18] whatever else we do could be good could
[1:10:19] be bad that's okay
[1:10:22] but we must lift up the Lord Jesus
[1:10:25] if we're to draw men to him
[1:10:28] and this he said signifying what death
[1:10:30] he should die
[1:10:32] there's no way to magnify and to lift up
[1:10:35] the Lord Jesus
[1:10:37] if we're also trying to magnify and lift
[1:10:39] up our flesh if we're trying to keep a
[1:10:42] good image for ourselves alive
[1:10:46] no flesh will lower in his presence we
[1:10:48] have a choice
[1:10:49] we can either lift up the Lord Jesus
[1:10:51] through our death
[1:10:54] or we can kill the word of God
[1:10:57] and lift ourselves up and so just like
[1:10:59] pilate said what shall I do with this
[1:11:02] Jesus
[1:11:03] he asked the crowd
[1:11:05] I've got this Jesus what do I do with
[1:11:07] him
[1:11:08] I said crucify him
[1:11:11] and that's always the answer of the
[1:11:12] flesh that's always the answer of the
[1:11:14] crowd
[1:11:15] unless the spirit of God moves
[1:11:20] because everyone loves baby Jesus
[1:11:24] but when he comes and he starts
[1:11:25] convicting men of sin
[1:11:28] he starts calling people whitewashed
[1:11:30] tombs
[1:11:32] and he starts saying
[1:11:35] if you'd known the prophets you'd know
[1:11:37] me
[1:11:39] things get uncomfortable
[1:11:42] people don't like to be uncomfortable
[1:11:43] they want to marry Christmas at all
[1:11:44] costs
[1:11:46] let's just be happy if it makes you
[1:11:48] happy it can't be bad
[1:11:50] that's the spirit of the sage just do
[1:11:52] what makes you happy
[1:11:55] it all work out
[1:11:57] it's not true
[1:12:00] we have One Life to Live
[1:12:05] with one opportunity
[1:12:08] to follow in the footsteps of our Lord
[1:12:10] Jesus
[1:12:15] so I was thinking
[1:12:18] I was going to read all that before I
[1:12:20] had you sit down aren't you glad I had
[1:12:22] you sit down that was going to be my
[1:12:24] opening two scriptures so maybe I'm
[1:12:27] learning
[1:12:30] that's why I switched to the other two
[1:12:34] I was thinking though
[1:12:36] about this Christmas thing right
[1:12:40] this is the day that's Christmas and so
[1:12:43] it was first going to be announced I was
[1:12:46] going to preach a Christmas message and
[1:12:48] I don't know what a Christmas message is
[1:12:50] like I I just I don't know
[1:12:53] um
[1:12:56] but I was thinking
[1:12:58] we believe that Christ was born with the
[1:13:01] Lambs in the spring
[1:13:03] just thinking well what is this
[1:13:05] time of year all about
[1:13:07] what is this
[1:13:09] Christmas about and and really if you
[1:13:12] look up the history of it it's a lot of
[1:13:14] pagan activity right a lot of
[1:13:16] of Hooten and hollering and worshiping
[1:13:19] the Sun
[1:13:20] and that sort of thing because on
[1:13:23] Wednesday it was the shortest day of the
[1:13:24] year
[1:13:26] and so it's it's the the days get
[1:13:28] shorter and shorter and then
[1:13:30] you get to this solstice time
[1:13:33] where then the light starts returning
[1:13:36] and so this Christmas the roots of it
[1:13:39] are people watching the Sun and saying
[1:13:42] okay something's going on and then
[1:13:44] whenever we see something that's going
[1:13:45] on we say okay we've gotta we've got to
[1:13:47] do something about this right the the
[1:13:49] universe needs our help
[1:13:51] hear the the sun's going away and and so
[1:13:54] we'd better go Hoot and Holler and light
[1:13:57] some fires and and get the sun to come
[1:13:59] back that's paganism right
[1:14:03] but
[1:14:06] I believe that God gave the light in
[1:14:08] heaven for signs and seasons for days
[1:14:10] and years
[1:14:12] so whatever's happening in the heavens
[1:14:14] there is
[1:14:16] some meaning to it
[1:14:18] there is something that's going on
[1:14:22] and so when we look at this
[1:14:24] this time
[1:14:27] we don't want to be like the heathens
[1:14:30] and we don't want to have a pagan
[1:14:31] approach to this where we say
[1:14:34] okay the light's going away and now
[1:14:36] we've got to go and and jump and holler
[1:14:38] and get the light to come back
[1:14:41] the light's coming back
[1:14:44] God God set this all in order
[1:14:47] son
[1:14:48] in its place the Earth's gone in its
[1:14:51] place
[1:14:51] the light's coming back
[1:14:54] we don't have to go and Hoot and Holler
[1:14:56] and make it happen and cut ourselves
[1:14:58] that's um
[1:15:00] that's bail worship when you cut
[1:15:02] yourselves and you you try to you know
[1:15:05] just
[1:15:06] Bend
[1:15:08] bend the the lights to obey you
[1:15:13] but there is something to do when it's
[1:15:15] dark
[1:15:17] and I thought of Jesus in Gethsemane
[1:15:19] praying
[1:15:21] the light's coming back but
[1:15:24] there's one group that they're just
[1:15:26] trying to to work something up
[1:15:28] there's another group that's sleeping
[1:15:30] that's the disciples
[1:15:32] just well times are times are not great
[1:15:34] wake me up when things are better
[1:15:39] two extremes right
[1:15:40] ones no come back son come on
[1:15:43] got the others ah it's okay
[1:15:46] see you in the morning
[1:15:48] that you got the Lord Jesus
[1:15:52] pray
[1:15:54] he's watching he's pouring out his soul
[1:15:57] unto death
[1:16:00] so in this dark time I believe the
[1:16:02] light's coming
[1:16:04] I believe there's coming a day
[1:16:06] a real glorious day
[1:16:10] but it's not in our ability to work
[1:16:12] things up
[1:16:15] come and
[1:16:18] whatever we do but let's be ready
[1:16:21] let's make ourselves ready let's be
[1:16:23] clothed in the righteousness of God
[1:16:25] let's be laying aside every sin and
[1:16:28] every weight and the things that you so
[1:16:29] easily beset us
[1:16:32] let's seek the Lord
[1:16:35] let's see if there's somebody that we
[1:16:36] can
[1:16:38] in another time of great darkness in the
[1:16:40] land
[1:16:42] in Egypt in Goshen
[1:16:45] it was a time to try to bring people in
[1:16:48] underneath the blood
[1:16:51] maybe we're okay and we could just spend
[1:16:53] the night sleeping but let's look out
[1:16:55] the window and see
[1:16:58] is one of our neighbors somebody that
[1:17:00] could be persuaded to come under the
[1:17:01] blood
[1:17:03] as one of our loved ones gone outside
[1:17:09] the light's coming but what we do here
[1:17:11] in the night is important too
[1:17:15] not to work ourselves up and cut
[1:17:17] ourselves with knives
[1:17:20] but just like Jesus did he found
[1:17:24] in prayer
[1:17:27] but he could get to the place where he'd
[1:17:28] say not my will but thine be done that's
[1:17:31] all we need to do it's not this
[1:17:33] self-crucifixion it's not well let me go
[1:17:35] find 10 ways to appear real holy and and
[1:17:38] okay I'm not um not washing my clothes
[1:17:40] anymore that might might be holy yeah
[1:17:42] that's just uncomfortable and stinky but
[1:17:45] what we need to come to is
[1:17:49] a place for our own will
[1:17:52] has been crucified
[1:17:54] we're not crucifying you know we're not
[1:17:57] actually going and driving spikes in our
[1:18:00] hands
[1:18:02] but we need to come to that place where
[1:18:04] we say not my will of God
[1:18:06] let thine be done
[1:18:07] whatever you do
[1:18:10] you slay me yet I'll trust you
[1:18:13] I will follow you
[1:18:15] wherever you lead
[1:18:19] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:18:21] God they are the sons of God
[1:18:25] not anything else
[1:18:27] but will you follow
[1:18:30] will you be led
[1:18:34] these are perilous times These are times
[1:18:37] that we don't believe every Spirit but
[1:18:38] we try the spirits whether they be of
[1:18:40] God
[1:18:43] this is a time when the spirits are so
[1:18:46] close
[1:18:47] that it'll deceive the very elect if it
[1:18:49] were possible
[1:18:52] and so it's easy to say well I'm Alexa
[1:18:54] it's not possible going to bed I'll see
[1:18:57] you
[1:18:59] but I believe part of the reason the
[1:19:01] elect's not deceived is because the
[1:19:02] elect loves the truth
[1:19:05] and they love the voice of the shepherd
[1:19:07] and they've got to be where they can
[1:19:09] hear his voice and feel his spirit
[1:19:14] that's why they can't be deceived
[1:19:19] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:19:21] that's in the world
[1:19:22] I mean it's not a time to be scared it's
[1:19:24] not a time to oh me is the sun going to
[1:19:27] come back
[1:19:28] the sun's coming back
[1:19:31] don't worry
[1:19:33] we'll hold them to the hand of God
[1:19:35] and don't believe any spirit will make
[1:19:39] sure it lines up with this word
[1:19:41] not just a couple verses here or there
[1:19:43] but make sure it goes all the way
[1:19:44] through Genesis revelation
[1:19:47] you can take see the letters killeth but
[1:19:51] the spirit gives life
[1:19:54] you can take any any portion of this and
[1:19:55] you could just go around killing people
[1:19:57] you know killing your neighbor well
[1:19:58] you're not right you're feeling here
[1:20:01] but what we need more than anything is
[1:20:04] the spirit of God to move
[1:20:06] because he's the only one that can open
[1:20:08] this book and divide it out in the right
[1:20:10] timing in the right spirit in the right
[1:20:13] way
[1:20:14] and so where you've got in the beginning
[1:20:16] you've got the Earth without form and
[1:20:18] void
[1:20:20] there was nothing the Earth could do to
[1:20:22] get out of that condition
[1:20:25] all the earth's best tricks and and
[1:20:27] whatever get all the dinosaurs to go
[1:20:29] over on this side and jump in unison
[1:20:32] wouldn't matter
[1:20:35] but it took the spirit of God
[1:20:38] brooding over the Earth
[1:20:42] moving upon the face of the waters and
[1:20:45] separating dividing the light from the
[1:20:46] darkness that's what it'll take for this
[1:20:49] church to be a success
[1:20:52] whatever we do
[1:20:56] let's allow that Spirit to move
[1:20:59] let's not grieve the spirit away with
[1:21:01] our unbelief with our insincerity and
[1:21:04] with our hatred and strife
[1:21:06] we could have everything good
[1:21:11] but if we don't have the spirit of life
[1:21:14] it's nothing
[1:21:17] I heard a story it was about Walt Disney
[1:21:20] one of the there see there's so much uh
[1:21:23] you say he's going to preach about Walt
[1:21:25] Disney well hmm not good well
[1:21:28] let's let's think about this
[1:21:31] this is the world of fakes this is the
[1:21:34] world of counterfeits this man Walt
[1:21:36] Disney was one of the first ones to
[1:21:38] realize that you could make something
[1:21:39] that's not real look
[1:21:41] interestingly real
[1:21:44] and so that I heard this story where he
[1:21:47] was building this um most magical place
[1:21:50] on Earth or whatever this this place
[1:21:52] this
[1:21:53] this little kingdom
[1:21:56] and he wanted to have some birds there
[1:21:59] what's a kingdom without birds so he had
[1:22:01] these fake birds and they were really
[1:22:03] really good fake Birds every feather was
[1:22:06] just right and the way that they were
[1:22:09] these these scientists and Engineers
[1:22:12] really studied to get just the best fake
[1:22:14] bird the world had ever seen
[1:22:19] and so they're all impressed and they're
[1:22:21] with themselves and they're ready to
[1:22:22] show this guy Walt Disney
[1:22:25] look at this bird isn't this just great
[1:22:28] and he says it's not breathing
[1:22:31] won't work
[1:22:34] and they said
[1:22:36] well uh people won't notice that he says
[1:22:39] people can feel
[1:22:41] perfection
[1:22:42] and sometimes real people
[1:22:44] can sense that genuine
[1:22:47] so I think what they did is they went
[1:22:49] and put in some sort of actuator to get
[1:22:51] these
[1:22:52] guys to breathe I don't know
[1:22:55] but to me that's still a fake bird
[1:22:59] I don't want a fake bird
[1:23:01] I don't want us to get to the place
[1:23:03] where okay we've got every feather is
[1:23:04] just right and every every fingernail
[1:23:07] and everything's just right
[1:23:09] over to churches and breathing
[1:23:12] oh this is a problem oh let's put in
[1:23:14] some sort of motor let's let's get a
[1:23:16] good music program make it seem like
[1:23:17] we're breathing
[1:23:19] no
[1:23:21] let's just let the spirit move
[1:23:26] let's just call in the name of the Lord
[1:23:28] and humble ourselves and turn our face
[1:23:30] towards heaven let's just repent of our
[1:23:32] sins
[1:23:34] see a broken and contrast Spirit he will
[1:23:36] not despise
[1:23:38] you say oh Lord where is your spirit
[1:23:41] well let's come the right way
[1:23:44] let's humble ourselves let's really love
[1:23:46] one another
[1:23:49] let's not have secret things hidden in
[1:23:51] our lives
[1:23:52] we've got the store of Aiken
[1:23:55] that this one man's sin this one man's
[1:23:57] hidden thing in his life caused
[1:24:00] his friends his brothers to die
[1:24:05] I believe we're coming back to the full
[1:24:08] sincerity of the Gospel to where
[1:24:11] we can't afford to have these hidden
[1:24:13] things that we've had these snakes that
[1:24:15] we've allowed just to keep us pet snakes
[1:24:22] I believe we need the spirit of God
[1:24:24] moving more than anything
[1:24:27] foreign
[1:24:30] so that's
[1:24:32] that's what I think our step one is
[1:24:36] get the spirit moving now by working it
[1:24:38] up not by oh let's make it look like
[1:24:41] we're breathing
[1:24:43] you know let's receive the Holy Ghost
[1:24:46] let's let it lead us
[1:24:49] to death
[1:24:51] to lead our lives for one another
[1:24:53] because if we can do that
[1:24:57] it doesn't matter really
[1:25:00] for a good preacher a good singer or
[1:25:02] whatever
[1:25:03] when the spirit of the Lord really came
[1:25:05] down to the Temple of Solomon the
[1:25:07] ministers couldn't even minister
[1:25:09] it didn't matter if he was a good
[1:25:11] speaker or not or
[1:25:13] you know if you had a nice tie
[1:25:15] but the spirit of God was moving
[1:25:22] I believe that's what we need
[1:25:27] for God to breathe into our nostrils the
[1:25:29] Breath of Life just like he breathed
[1:25:31] into Adam
[1:25:34] we're coming we're being built up into a
[1:25:36] habitation for this Holy One
[1:25:40] but unless he actually lives here
[1:25:44] it's just a house yes
[1:25:46] it's just walls
[1:25:51] let's make him welcome let's receive him
[1:25:53] into our hearts today
[1:25:56] let this Christmas be Christmas that we
[1:25:58] really really sincerely say oh God be it
[1:26:01] unto me according to your word
[1:26:10] to everything there is a season
[1:26:13] and a time to every purpose under heaven
[1:26:16] so don't get discouraged when
[1:26:18] you know where we're at and and what you
[1:26:21] see right now
[1:26:23] it's for a reason
[1:26:27] this word It Cuts Like a Knife but it
[1:26:29] also says comfort you comfort ye my
[1:26:31] people
[1:26:33] he also says she's already received from
[1:26:35] the Lord's hand double for her sins
[1:26:40] I believe though there's an anointing on
[1:26:42] us right now
[1:26:44] it says prepare the way for the Lord
[1:26:46] he's coming Let's Straighten Up let's
[1:26:50] make the the mountains High let's make
[1:26:52] the mountains low let's let's prepare
[1:26:54] for him to come
[1:26:56] maybe his spirit's not moving yet like
[1:26:58] we want it to move
[1:27:00] but how can we get ready
[1:27:02] how can we get out of the way how can we
[1:27:04] prepare a Manger if all we got for him
[1:27:07] to to be in our house we don't have a
[1:27:09] nice
[1:27:10] bassinet or whatever you whatever you'd
[1:27:12] like to have
[1:27:15] let's make our manger the best that we
[1:27:17] can for him
[1:27:19] whatever we've got let's let's make it
[1:27:21] ready that we can say Lord I don't have
[1:27:23] much but all that I have is yours
[1:27:28] if we're so in tears we'll reap enjoy
[1:27:33] if we'll go forth weeping bearing
[1:27:35] precious seed
[1:27:37] well doubtless come again rejoice and
[1:27:39] bear in our sheaves
[1:27:40] with us
[1:27:44] but we can't get to the joy we can't get
[1:27:46] to the sheaves
[1:27:47] without the Weeping without the sowing
[1:27:51] Without Really following the Lord Jesus
[1:27:54] matters what we do and matters how we do
[1:27:56] it we don't want to just realize the
[1:27:58] ark's got to get from here to here and
[1:28:00] and the cart would be a nice way to do
[1:28:02] it
[1:28:04] you know let's seek the Lord
[1:28:07] say Lord we know where we need to go
[1:28:11] show us how to do it
[1:28:14] lead us Lord because otherwise people
[1:28:17] are going to die
[1:28:19] people are going to get hurt
[1:28:25] it's not just you know Blaze ahead and
[1:28:27] and try something out and see if it
[1:28:29] works
[1:28:32] no we we have an example I love what
[1:28:34] brother Daniel said about this this
[1:28:36] leader
[1:28:38] of the Louisville fire department that
[1:28:40] he he was up ahead and and people could
[1:28:42] follow him
[1:28:45] I believe that
[1:28:47] that leader is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:50] and our job isn't to run ahead of him
[1:28:54] but our job is to point to him and say
[1:28:56] oh Lord Jesus I can see
[1:28:59] where you were lifted up
[1:29:02] I want to follow you
[1:29:05] and that's our job is not to go and
[1:29:07] Blaze a new Trail
[1:29:10] but to point to the one who's gone on
[1:29:12] before
[1:29:13] it's important to the captain of our
[1:29:15] salvation
[1:29:16] the first born among many brethren we're
[1:29:19] not going to have victory in a different
[1:29:20] way than he had victory
[1:29:22] but if we'll just follow
[1:29:26] he's the only mediator
[1:29:28] between God and man
[1:29:31] we take a lot of times the scripture
[1:29:33] that Paul
[1:29:34] told Timothy in in First Corinthians 11
[1:29:37] 1 and he says be followers of me even as
[1:29:41] I also am of Christ
[1:29:45] and that's true and I believe that and I
[1:29:47] think
[1:29:48] sometimes we only look at that partially
[1:29:50] and we kind of take it to say well
[1:29:52] at least myself let me just be honest
[1:29:54] with you guys sometimes I take that and
[1:29:56] just say well Paul had it figured out
[1:29:59] you're saying Timothy
[1:30:01] I'm pretty much there
[1:30:03] I've got to pretty much figured out so
[1:30:05] if you'll just do what I'm doing you'll
[1:30:06] be okay Timothy
[1:30:08] I think that's the way at least I
[1:30:10] interpret it sometimes right
[1:30:12] it's somebody that's got it mostly
[1:30:13] figured out
[1:30:14] and just do what they do
[1:30:16] and that's close enough
[1:30:21] but I believe there's more to this
[1:30:23] scripture than that and I believe in
[1:30:25] this scripture be followers of me even
[1:30:28] as I also of Christ
[1:30:30] I believe this is a prophecy of two
[1:30:32] deaths
[1:30:35] because Paul's story wasn't over when he
[1:30:37] wrote this
[1:30:38] but where he was following Christ
[1:30:42] was to lay his life down for this gospel
[1:30:45] that he was martyred
[1:30:47] I believe he was beheaded
[1:30:50] and Paul's following of Christ was not
[1:30:53] just I've got the right Doctrine
[1:30:55] I've got the right spirit
[1:30:59] it was Timothy
[1:31:00] I'm gonna die for this
[1:31:04] just like Jesus died for you
[1:31:07] and Timothy when that happens
[1:31:10] don't give up
[1:31:13] don't lose Heart Don't Run Away
[1:31:15] follow me as I follow Christ you can do
[1:31:18] the same and Timothy did
[1:31:20] Timothy was martyred as well
[1:31:25] and so it's not just this easy oh find a
[1:31:28] good man and do what he's doing
[1:31:30] but it's Jesus is the good man
[1:31:33] and we know what he did
[1:31:35] and that's where we're called
[1:31:37] that's where we're called to follow Paul
[1:31:39] Timothy and each one of us
[1:31:41] the way that we do that is different now
[1:31:44] there's different
[1:31:46] ways that we've got to fulfill different
[1:31:48] parts of the scripture and
[1:31:51] it may be that not one of us
[1:31:54] has a gun held to our head
[1:31:56] says are you a Christian
[1:31:58] are you not
[1:31:59] that may never happen to any of us
[1:32:03] but each one of us still has to choose
[1:32:06] will we lay our life down
[1:32:09] or will we keep part of it back
[1:32:16] I've got a
[1:32:18] I've got a contractual agreement
[1:32:21] that they
[1:32:22] the sales people call it life insurance
[1:32:27] well that's just a sales gimmick it's
[1:32:28] actually death insurance
[1:32:31] they don't pay me nothing if I keep on
[1:32:33] living
[1:32:34] but
[1:32:36] this life insurance thing it's not worth
[1:32:39] a penny to me
[1:32:41] or to my wife or my family
[1:32:44] unless I actually do the thing that I've
[1:32:46] contractually agreed to do
[1:32:49] which is to die
[1:32:52] and if I can do that my wife will be a
[1:32:55] rich woman
[1:32:58] if I don't do that she's not getting a
[1:33:00] dime
[1:33:02] and that's the way a lot of these
[1:33:03] promises are is that there are powerful
[1:33:06] promises powerful things that will
[1:33:08] happen for the believer
[1:33:10] if we'll just lay our lives down
[1:33:13] if we'll crucify our will
[1:33:16] the life insurance company doesn't care
[1:33:18] if you're mostly dead
[1:33:21] they want a scientific declaration there
[1:33:25] are no signs of life in this this guy
[1:33:27] Pete don't worry about him he's he's
[1:33:29] really dead
[1:33:30] then she gets the money
[1:33:37] are we willing to go all the way
[1:33:40] of this
[1:33:44] Jesus said in Matthew 16.
[1:33:48] and 24
[1:33:50] and then said Jesus unto his disciples
[1:33:54] If any man will come after me
[1:33:56] let him deny himself
[1:33:58] and take up his cross and follow me
[1:34:03] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:34:05] lose it
[1:34:07] and whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:34:09] sake shall find it
[1:34:12] what does a man profited if he shall
[1:34:14] gain the whole world and lose his own
[1:34:16] soul
[1:34:18] and what shall a man give in exchange
[1:34:20] for his soul
[1:34:24] in Romans 6
[1:34:27] verse 3.
[1:34:36] he says know you not
[1:34:38] that so many of us as we're baptized
[1:34:40] into Christ into Jesus Christ
[1:34:43] were baptized into his death
[1:34:47] don't you know
[1:34:49] when we get baptized up here that's what
[1:34:51] we're saying
[1:34:55] that will be with him in death will be
[1:34:57] with him in Resurrection
[1:35:00] that will love not our lives to the
[1:35:02] death
[1:35:05] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:35:07] baptism unto death
[1:35:09] but see it doesn't end there
[1:35:13] don't fear going into the valley of the
[1:35:15] shadow of death you're not going to stay
[1:35:16] there
[1:35:17] it's though I walk through
[1:35:20] the Valley of the shadow of death
[1:35:23] there's a promised land on the other
[1:35:25] side of Jordan
[1:35:27] for us death is a doorway into the
[1:35:29] promises of God to the land of the Holy
[1:35:31] Ghost
[1:35:33] where God can move
[1:35:36] it doesn't end just with being buried in
[1:35:39] baptism
[1:35:42] but if we're buried within in by baptism
[1:35:44] unto death that like as Christ was
[1:35:47] raised up from the dead by the glory of
[1:35:49] the father even so we also
[1:35:51] should walk in newness of life
[1:35:57] so once the jet crosses that sound
[1:35:59] barrier
[1:36:01] can do incredible things
[1:36:04] once we can get away from our own
[1:36:08] ability
[1:36:14] that we can cash in on that life
[1:36:16] insurance policy
[1:36:17] we can see God move and we can see God
[1:36:19] heal and and discern spirits and raise
[1:36:23] the Dead
[1:36:25] but we've got to go through God's
[1:36:27] provided way
[1:36:29] walk in newness of life
[1:36:31] for if we have been planted together in
[1:36:33] the likeness of his death
[1:36:35] we shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:36:38] resurrection amen
[1:36:41] that corner wheat doesn't stay in the
[1:36:42] ground rotten Undead
[1:36:44] but it's planted
[1:36:46] there is a resurrection
[1:36:49] knowing this that our old man is
[1:36:51] crucified with him
[1:36:52] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:36:55] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:36:58] for he that is dead is freed from sin
[1:37:03] dropping down into Romans 8 18.
[1:37:08] this this this goes all through Romans
[1:37:10] it's not just oh well you know you're
[1:37:13] just taking a couple scriptures out of
[1:37:14] context now go back and read it
[1:37:17] go back and read Romans and see if this
[1:37:20] isn't what Paul is talking about
[1:37:23] he says in Romans 8 18 for I reckon that
[1:37:26] the sufferings of this present time
[1:37:29] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:37:31] glory which shall be revealed in US
[1:37:35] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:37:37] creature weighed us for the
[1:37:38] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:37:43] verse 22 it says for we know the whole
[1:37:45] creation groaneth and travieth and pain
[1:37:47] together until now
[1:37:50] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:37:52] which have the first fruits of the
[1:37:53] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:37:56] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:37:57] wet the Redemption of our body
[1:37:59] are we groaning like that
[1:38:04] do we just say oh yeah that's me and
[1:38:06] then we go home and we're like totally
[1:38:08] satisfied
[1:38:09] totally happy with the way we are
[1:38:12] totally fine with the amount of the
[1:38:14] spirits moving in our lives
[1:38:17] we're in our service saying oh God I
[1:38:19] need
[1:38:21] something
[1:38:23] of life to burst forth from this dead
[1:38:26] seed
[1:38:28] and I'm not rotted enough yet Lord
[1:38:31] there's still something in me that's
[1:38:32] keeping that life from bursting forth oh
[1:38:34] God
[1:38:36] I've got the down payment
[1:38:38] I've received your Holy Ghost to the sea
[1:38:40] but Lord
[1:38:42] glorify thy name
[1:38:44] let it spring forth
[1:38:49] I believe there's a people that's
[1:38:51] groaning for that
[1:38:53] and the devil tries
[1:38:56] to mask that
[1:38:58] tries to distract us away from that
[1:39:00] smoke and mirrors and balls and get you
[1:39:03] looking at oh this one's wrong and this
[1:39:04] one's wrong
[1:39:05] now look to Jesus
[1:39:08] just keep your eyes on him don't look to
[1:39:10] the winds and the waves
[1:39:14] just walk to him
[1:39:22] then Romans 12 1 says I beseech you
[1:39:25] therefore brethren
[1:39:27] by the mercies of God that you present
[1:39:29] your body as a Living Sacrifice
[1:39:32] holy
[1:39:33] acceptable unto God
[1:39:35] which is your reasonable service
[1:39:41] this is the gospel
[1:39:44] of Jesus Christ
[1:39:46] this is the gospel that Paul said If any
[1:39:48] man preaches any other gospel then what
[1:39:50] I've preach unto you let him be accursed
[1:39:53] there's no life outside of this
[1:39:57] there's no good news out of
[1:40:01] this follow Christ
[1:40:05] yes you'll have to go through death
[1:40:08] but you'll share in his resurrection
[1:40:11] you'll share in his life
[1:40:16] but everything else outside of that is
[1:40:19] the spirit of antichrist
[1:40:20] and it's the spirit of Cain worship
[1:40:23] it just says let's let's fake a
[1:40:25] breathing bird
[1:40:27] let's make it look really pretty
[1:40:32] what is there life there
[1:40:34] is there death there
[1:40:37] is there Godly sincerity
[1:40:39] it's the word of God being received
[1:40:42] as it was spoken or are we twisting in
[1:40:45] some way
[1:40:49] when they wandered in the wilderness
[1:40:53] before they could cross over they had to
[1:40:56] circumcise their children
[1:41:00] they had to make sure that everyone
[1:41:02] was ready to go over
[1:41:06] I believe now we're getting ready this
[1:41:08] is a time that we're to go into Christ
[1:41:10] into these promises of God
[1:41:13] we need to make sure
[1:41:15] have we got the Holy Ghost
[1:41:18] have we put away all the things of the
[1:41:20] flesh have we have we let worldliness
[1:41:22] creep back in
[1:41:26] have we let our disputations and
[1:41:28] murmurines quenched the moving of the
[1:41:30] spirit of God
[1:41:34] or are we totally surrendered
[1:41:37] totally ready to have the Lord move
[1:41:41] he said circumcise the foreskin of your
[1:41:43] heart
[1:41:45] he said to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:41:47] and a hearken than the fat of lambs
[1:41:54] it says in Matthew that within Jesus Old
[1:41:57] Country he did not many mighty works
[1:41:59] there because of his unbelief
[1:42:02] what move into the spirit
[1:42:05] are we hindering by our unbelief
[1:42:08] by the thing is that we just won't let
[1:42:09] go of
[1:42:11] the areas in our lives that we just
[1:42:12] won't die
[1:42:17] let's let's go to
[1:42:19] Mark 10
[1:42:22] and 35.
[1:42:30] I don't think I have a full three hours
[1:42:32] left don't worry
[1:42:37] we get like this sometimes like James
[1:42:39] and John
[1:42:40] the sons of Zebedee that came unto him
[1:42:42] saying master
[1:42:43] we would that thou shouldest do for us
[1:42:45] whatsoever
[1:42:47] we desire isn't that our kind of
[1:42:49] religion sometimes
[1:42:50] God will you give me whatever I want
[1:42:53] he'll give you what's good for you
[1:42:57] and he said unto them
[1:42:59] what would you that I should do for you
[1:43:03] they said to him
[1:43:05] Grant unto us that we may sit one on thy
[1:43:08] right hand and the other on my left hand
[1:43:10] in my glory
[1:43:14] Jesus said but Jesus said unto them you
[1:43:17] know not what you ask
[1:43:20] can you drink of the cup
[1:43:22] that I drink of
[1:43:24] and be baptized with the baptism that
[1:43:27] I'm baptized with
[1:43:29] and I think that's a great question for
[1:43:31] each one of us
[1:43:33] say oh God I want to be with you
[1:43:37] I want to be like you
[1:43:39] but are we willing to drink the cup
[1:43:42] are we willing to take that baptism
[1:43:50] they said unto him we can and Jesus said
[1:43:52] unto them ye shall indeed drink of the
[1:43:54] cup that I drink of see this wasn't just
[1:43:57] a rhetorical question
[1:43:58] this wasn't just well could you oh it's
[1:44:01] not for you don't worry he says you're
[1:44:03] gonna drink it
[1:44:06] and with the baptism that I'm baptized
[1:44:08] with all shall you be baptized
[1:44:11] he's not giving them a different Holy
[1:44:12] Ghost than he's given us
[1:44:14] he's not giving them a different cup
[1:44:15] than he's given us
[1:44:19] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[1:44:21] left hand is not mine to give but it
[1:44:23] shall be given to them for whom it is
[1:44:25] prepared
[1:44:26] and when the ten heard it they began to
[1:44:28] be much displeased with James and John
[1:44:32] but Jesus called them to him and said
[1:44:35] unto them
[1:44:36] you know that they which are accounted
[1:44:38] to rule over the Gentiles exercise
[1:44:39] lordship over them
[1:44:42] and their great ones exercise Authority
[1:44:44] upon them
[1:44:46] but so shall not be among you
[1:44:51] these are Jesus words
[1:44:53] but whosoever will be great among you
[1:44:55] shall be your minister
[1:44:57] and whosoever of you will be the
[1:44:59] chiefest shall be servant to all
[1:45:02] you say okay well that's for the pastor
[1:45:06] that's for all of us
[1:45:09] can we be the footwash flunky
[1:45:12] can we be the one that says what do you
[1:45:14] need brother sister how can I help
[1:45:17] how can I minister to you
[1:45:19] not tell you you're wrong and here's why
[1:45:22] but how can I love you
[1:45:25] how can I wash your feet with my tears
[1:45:29] and dry your feet with my hair
[1:45:35] for the son of man came not to be
[1:45:37] ministered unto but to minister
[1:45:40] and to give his life a ransom for many
[1:45:50] that's if the musicians would come I've
[1:45:53] got more but let's go to First John 3
[1:45:56] and 14.
[1:45:59] if this seems heavy to you this seems
[1:46:03] like well count me out if that's it I
[1:46:05] can't do it
[1:46:08] the word of God says there hath no
[1:46:10] temptation taking you but such as common
[1:46:12] to man but God is faithful who will not
[1:46:14] suffer you to be tempted above that
[1:46:16] which you were able but what would the
[1:46:18] Temptation also make a way to escape
[1:46:19] that you may be able to bear
[1:46:22] if you desire to drink this cup
[1:46:25] to be baptized with this baptism
[1:46:28] this is for whosoever will
[1:46:31] this is for those that will say yes Lord
[1:46:33] I receive it
[1:46:36] let's let's read here in First John 3
[1:46:40] and 14.
[1:46:44] it says we know
[1:46:46] that we have passed from Death unto life
[1:46:50] because we love the brethren
[1:46:52] this is how we check up say God where am
[1:46:56] I at
[1:46:58] am I where I need to be have I laid my
[1:47:00] life down
[1:47:01] do you love your brother
[1:47:03] do you love your sister
[1:47:06] he that loveth not his brother abideth
[1:47:08] and death
[1:47:10] still something needs to die
[1:47:13] something needs to arrive
[1:47:16] whosoever hateth his brother as a
[1:47:17] murderer
[1:47:18] and you know that no murderer hath
[1:47:21] eternal life abiding in him
[1:47:23] hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:47:27] because he laid down his life for us
[1:47:30] and we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:47:32] the brethren
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:34] it's not just giving your life to give
[1:47:36] it just for the sake of let me let me
[1:47:39] show what a Christian I am
[1:47:42] we lay our lives down for the brother
[1:47:44] [Music]
[1:47:46] that we can give healing that we can
[1:47:48] give strength
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:52] that somebody can eat of the Fruit of
[1:47:54] the Spirit
[1:47:55] rest underneath the shade
[1:48:00] but whoso hath this world's good and see
[1:48:03] if his brother have need and shutteth up
[1:48:05] his bowels of compassion from him
[1:48:07] how dwelleth the love of God in him
[1:48:11] my little children
[1:48:13] let us not love in Word
[1:48:15] neither in tongue
[1:48:17] but indeed and in truth
[1:48:20] do you want to love like that
[1:48:22] if you can love like that
[1:48:26] I don't know if you'll have a Merry
[1:48:27] Christmas
[1:48:29] but I believe you'll have a good Easter
[1:48:32] I believe you'll have
[1:48:34] a wonderful Pentecost
[1:48:38] I believe your brothers and your sisters
[1:48:41] well thank God for you
[1:48:44] whatever happens I love you
[1:48:46] I'll pray for you
[1:48:48] don't fear there's no fear in love but
[1:48:51] perfect love casts out all fear
[1:48:53] so we don't need to be afraid
[1:48:55] we just look to Jesus the author and the
[1:48:58] finisher of our faith he's gone on
[1:49:00] before we just have to follow him
[1:49:02] let's stand and pray let's really pray
[1:49:08] dear Jesus
[1:49:12] you've shown us the way
[1:49:14] Lord You're our example our perfect
[1:49:16] example help us to walk
[1:49:19] after your ways Lord to follow after you
[1:49:21] Lord
[1:49:23] we cannot do it Lord without your spirit
[1:49:25] so I pray o God that you'd baptize us
[1:49:27] each one with your spirit a new Lord and
[1:49:29] anything that's that's crept in anywhere
[1:49:31] that we've backed through the Lord
[1:49:33] anywhere that our love has grown cold
[1:49:34] father
[1:49:35] circumcising in the foreskin of our
[1:49:37] hearts father and let us love you
[1:49:40] with all that we are and love our
[1:49:42] neighbors ourselves father

[1:49:46] Tucson Tabernacle and in our lives

[1:49:55] your gospel is never bad news Lord but
[1:49:58] your gospel is always good news Lord
[1:49:59] It's always a comfort to us do it though
[1:50:02] it convicts us Lord and though it causes
[1:50:05] us Lord to groan and and say oh God
[1:50:10] so Lord we're so thankful for it
[1:50:13] for your word Lord for your truth
