him for it and we just thank god for all of you tonight amen if you will we just grab our bibles amen we just go into the word of the lord and let's see what the lord has in store for us amen we're just turning our bibles to isaiah 44. now i don't know i can't remember that i ministered that here but nevertheless maybe god wants to uh remind us sometimes we be for forget who is god and who is in control of all things amen isaac the 44th chapter and we begin to read from verse 6 and verse 8. you have it by saying amen and it read thus says the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and besides me there is no god let's read that again thus says the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and besides me there is no god and who as i shall call and shall declare it and set it in order for me since i appointed the ancient people and the things that are come and shall come let them show unto them for you not neither be afraid have not i told thee from that time that i have declared it ye are even my witnesses is there a god besides me yea there is no god i know not any hallelujah came to church say amen in other words he's alpha and omega amen let's turn to psalms 45 and verse 5. thereby saying amen i'm sorry isaiah 45 i said songs didn't i know i didn't hear no leaves turn pages turn i was in trouble amen isaiah 45 and verse 5. and it reads i am the lord and there is none else there is no god besides me i girder thee though thou has not known me that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none besides me i am the lord and there is none else well that's that's reverence eddie that that's your brain consolation and your spirit amen i formed light i create darkness i make peace and create evil are you saying that god is evil no that's in everything everything has to come before god amen i the lord do all these things amen listen by his again father lord jesus we thank you for the reading of your holy word now sanctify it to our soul this reacts in jesus name amen and you may take your seat praise the lord we like to by the help of the lord uh we we look at exodus uh we got a few things i i'm sure i hope that it'll be a help to you that it will relieve your comforts amen and you really have more faith in god and you'll know that who is running everything there's nothing on the earth that can move that god don't know about our god is all wise he's all-knowing he know every fleet that hops god even knows every hair that is on your head god is acquainted with all of your thoughts he knows how thoughts are false so what is it that god don't know so we want you to realize that god controls everything somebody say everything and my thought to this evening is the sovereignty of god the sovereignty of god we look at the sovereignty god and who is controlling our earth affairs let us find out what says the scripture and the prophet the definition of the word sovereignty is one who abide the law and who has no governing body a king who's ruled sovereignly sovereignly from his dictate of his own heart whatever the king desire that's the way it would go and whoever decision is final oh my as the darkness around us depend and man learn more and more and man lean more and more to the glorification of themself rather than christ the needs grows more urgent for the teaching that the prophet preached the message the sovereignty of god many will confess that god rules the heavens but for the most part his rulership on earth is out doubt or outright denied why the modern intellectual uh thinker pushed more the creator and more into the background that's why we thank god today that god sent us a prophet and allowed us to see that god is a god that sits high and he looks low and he sees everything don't you think not one moment that god don't see everything and sometimes we feel like well lord don't you see what's going on god is not sleep god never sleeps he sees everything he even told us he said lord i am with you always in your darkest moment i am with you where do you think god was at when the hebrew boys had to walk into the fiery furnish he was already in there so he already sees he already knows every trial that you have to go through god already know those things can the church say amen so we look in our bibles as we return to uh exodus amen exodus the seventh chapter and we begin to look at exodus 7 chapter 1 through 6 are we there by saying amen and it reads and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy what prophet in other word a mouthpiece now this wasn't uh a president uh there wasn't uh some dictator but this was god telling moses i'm gonna make you a god and i'm gonna make your brother aaron he's going to be a prophet and that's right verse 2 and he says god shall speak all that i have commanded thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh and he send the children of israel out of the land oh my so the question is when well what god told moses when you go down there so can you imagine can i just paraphrase a little bit can you imagine i don't know was it day or night or god spoke to moses and moses go tell his brother era aaron we're going down to egypt and everyone's like okay because so you know brother brown will say that back in those days moses going down to egypt it was like going down to russia one man invasion but moses telling his brother look we're going down to egypt and god told me brother and aaron said okay i'm listen he said god told me i'm going to be god and you're going to be like oh the prophet and whatever i point you you know i said dust to the lord so we're going to work together and and aaron like wow brother are you sure about this yes i know it's god i know his voice how many you ever hear his voice and that's why you could move because i i know god told me that somebody said i don't know about that but i know god told me god told me to do this and i'm going to do it with confidence but then moses and aaron got together and i can imagine moses might have told his wife to poor amen we're going down to egypt honey uh we're going to settle our donkey and and we're going down there but moses was so excited about going down to egypt that he was going to in the presence of god and his son wasn't circumcised and sometimes we try to go in the presence of god and the heart is not circumcised your heart got to be circumcised so moses and aaron going down to egypt i could imagine going there and there they're thinking what they're going to say moses said you know man i'm a little nervous i've never done this before but i know it was god god told me to speak thus said the lord let my people go oh my oh my so i can imagine in their mind they know it's exactly how this thing going to play out moses is going to wave his hand and and moses is going to speak thus says the lord and his brother aaron's going to be standing there and the people gonna be amazed and and pharaoh gonna back up with his magicians and oh it's gonna be a time and that's the way we always got a picture in our mind how this thing's supposed to play out you know and you know and we have no idea how this body is going to change but we do know that we're going to be changed in a moment of a twinkling of an eye i have no idea what it's going to be like when i go back to be about 20 years old but i believe that but i just got off you know i just in my mind my little puny mind goes so far let's go blink we try to understand god we try to we need to let god handle his business you know you know as i get into my my lesson i i thought of the sovereignty of god you know and and i'm not into politic but you know during the time of the 44th president that was wrestling and and not to vote him and not to have and somebody said no i don't care when you cast your vote it's god that is controlling everything you say i got to get off of work early i got i got to go to the pool go to the phone god already know who's going to be president that's that's the that's the writing of the pale horse rider are you with me so god knows who's going to be president god know what president is going to be in the office to open the door to the same sex marriage and not a thing we could do about it somebody said well i didn't vote for him you don't have to god already got it figured out so what we need to do is lay back and relax and let god run his business can the whole church say amen i'm talking about the whole church now amen if we would just let god handle his business and just just relax this you know the prophet of god said in the in the church in the seal book he said don't try to manufacture nothing now just just walk just just just come to church this this place that sang just amen and when god get ready it's not on our time it's when god get ready we try to hurry up god we we come and we try to figure out oh i believe god's going to do how do you know god got everything scheduled and everything's going my fact the prophet of god says there's nothing oh this ought to bless you now that the prophet of god said there's nothing out of cater you say brother children you just don't know how i said there's nothing out of catered the prophet of god said there's nothing that can happen to a christian how many christians in here that god has an intent you say i don't know but you don't believe your bible that's why apostle paul said that romans 8 28 or 28 uh paul says all things know some things brother should you just don't understand when i go all things you know let me tell you what and i i've heard people get this pity pad we got we got to stop that you don't know what i'm going through you look look you ought to be happy you going through something i know some people are stuck and can't go through you ought to be happy i'm going through my trial brother brother children the fire trials that i'm going i thank god i have the opportunity to go through my trial and every one of my child come before me god put them there to build character by sometimes we want to tell god how how we want things to how we want to lay it out god i want to be like this and i want the church to be this way i want everybody just to like me oh you forget that god got everything in control you know i can imagine well you know i think that the bible said uh god uh i i can't remember whether job or one of the someone said that doll the potter right and i'm just to clay how many products is in here how many clays are in here so what is the problem so we're trying to tell god god takes you and he twisted you all you try to tell god god oh god lord you about to break it you know what he's doing he's made you and he knows exactly what you need to be a character all of us don't go through the same thing god allows things to happen because he's building character if i have gone through some of the trial that i'm going man some of the trials i go through is fiery trials my if i could tell you you would say what but you know what it does it made me a better christian it taught me how to love my enemies it taught me how to love those that persecute me and say all evil against me i realize if there's any evil in this city has not the lord god done it all things work together for the good god is a mercy for god let me just throw this in i just feel the present lord here i was just thinking i was just listening out of tape the other day when brother bradley was going out to kill that animal and that biscuit was with them y'all know where i'm going right ed bishop was with him but brother browning the vision saw an ed biscuit with a what a plaid shirt right but when brother brown saw ed biska ed biska didn't hat on a plaid shirt huh but oh listen to me church ed bischo amen later on as brother brownlee got father ed biscuit was behind oh church of the living god don't tell me god is concerned about his word amen amen god vision amen when the prophet spoke thus saith the lord it's not the prophet it's god well somehow the sovereignty of god he runs his own business he had ed biska somewhere behind but who told ed biscuit to put that plaid shirt in there the plaid shirt was in there the prophet saw the individual a plaid shirt a biscuit in the hat on a plaid shirt but somehow ed biscuit i think was crossing over a log or something and he fell in some water whatever and he had to change his shirt but when ed biska came in the presence of our prophet he said hey i thought you it said well my wife must have put it in there it was god it's trying to show you god said look i'm running this business you said lord i don't know i don't know what what's going to become our church just relax i'm not going to get my blood pressure up high amen just relax get yourself all worried and for what you know why why should you worry be happy you know if if god god is in control lord i need to straighten this out let's let god handle everything can the whole church say the whole church now moses and everyone goes down there and moses goes in the presence of a pharaoh and i can't imagine king pharaoh sitting on his throne with his wise man and his servant they're all sitting there just fanning him and can you imagine the door swings open and the guard's standing there and and moses come through with a dried up old stick in his hand amen going before king pharaoh but moses had thus said the lord now the reason moses went with i don't drive upstairs because he just knew when he go there and he poured his hand the truly israel will start coming that's what he thought and that's what we think we put you know i remember people just do their math and you know i remember in 96 they used to do their math and this plus that and that and this this this and over here according to that it looked like it's going to happen in 96 and we're still here god got his own time god's got his own time only thing i know it's going to be a few i do know one thing it won't be many that he'll put up there but i declare before god i'm going to be one of them that he adopted amen that's why i could go through my trial and hold my head up i ain't mad with nobody yeah you know what i've learned i've learned that people can't help themselves yeah i've learned lord had to teach me don't be mad with folks they might peep in them spirits you know we putting faces on them devils amen they ain't people don't spirits oh glory to god so you ought to love everybody that's why brother brandon you can't hardly tell who his enemy was he was nice to everybody that sold his tent from him amen and next they saw a brother brown riding in the car with his arm around him man and said brother brandon i thought you said brother brown said i told you to hate him are you hearing me even paul paul said demons has forsaken me loving this present world alexander the copper smell that deal mean much evil you think paul hated them paul couldn't hate them and plus preach love you got to know that all things work together for the good you say brother children i don't know i don't know if god see all this where i wish david was here i wish oh my god i wish david was here david will tell you man you don't know how much i honored saul and i loved saul almost i eat off the ground that man walk on i reverend that man and that man let me play his played in music and he put me in position but david said i don't understand why every time he tried to kill me it was building character and you see if thank god for this message because i declare and i declare i would have thought that saul was a serpent seed it's trying to kill huh and we try to judge and you know if you look at saul trying to kill david and jealous of him and are you hearing me and sometimes we try to just think that that right there don't judge nut before his time god allowed things to happen god allowed evil spirit to get on people to bring weight brain you where where you need to be positionally place you in the promised land hold somebody say amen you ought to thank god for it i feel good at night i feel like running back there but i'm going to stay up here and we try to judge things let god handle just walk this walk and let and the days are drawing nigh we we're getting ready to leave church yeah it won't be long there's pressure precious build character and power a character without power if i'm saying it right it's satanic but character with power is fit to rule you know i i want to be the man to glory to god i want to be the man that i am today if i had a lot of pressure a lot of pressure made me who i am today because of pressure and that what god doing god's turning up the heat and you you trying to figure out what is going on why is people god's doing it i don't understand why people's walking away god is having it done didn't the bible say there's going to be a fall away and that man of sin is going to be revealed we're brother and sister there's no more seed time it is harvest time everything is coming to ma man you can't hide this is a year dude hey let it all out be what you are yes ain't got nothing high amen amen my sin been washed away man so we have nothing to hide but look at god he's a sovereign god he runs everything you ought to be happy when you go through you know but during the the message i study the sovereignty of god i got off of work one day i ain't losing my note i'm just following the lord i got off from work one day and uh i went home and my wife wasn't there so i said uh i'm going back up to the restaurant y'all don't have crocodiles around here do you y'all do mine why we didn't go there and so i said well i'm going back to crocker barrel so i'm riding going back to crocodile with my car and and it was raining i was driving a little too fast i know y'all don't do that up here thank god and i was driving a little too fast for the condition of the weather amen and this older guy this slam on break and you know what happened and i ran right i tried to dodge him i tried to dodge him but god said no you're going to hit him i already saw you got to hit him and i wound right in the back oh lord i couldn't believe this had me a preacher why not lord i preach hard why not so i gets out and and and and uh and i said oh lord and uh the officer comes and all this and and long story short amen what the officer said you know he just told me he did what he had to do and said take it before the judge or whatever and and and buy and i said you're not going to take no points bye i wasn't going to ask him the third time so but my main thing what i'm trying to get to i wanted to go to kraken barrel that that was my heart desire to go to kraken barrel cracker barrel so i didn't want circumstances to hinder me and that's the way you got to be you can't let distraction stop you for reaching your destiny we got a destiny no matter what they do summon block in your way i had an accident but i went to crocodile and i sat down at the table and the waitress came in and said how are you doing sir i said well i'm doing great she said wow i said i just had an accident she said really and you in here i said yes ma'am i said you know what but my whole heart was to go to crocodile and that's the way you got to be you can't let nothing handle you you can't let one go in church stop your praise you was born to worship you come from a a family of worship amen you was with him amen when the morning starts shouting for joy you got to believe i was born to worship i know i'm not going to let nobody hinder me if i want to amen i'm going to amen i

house shall be called the house of what he's controlling everything and we with our little love little little brains try to outsmart god he even know what i'm going to put on before i even know it the prophet of god said he said you young people write this down see if it come to pass he said she gonna have on royal purple oh my god that was for the lady was even born she might have went in the closet to get yellow and she might have put it on and she might have spilled something on it y'all leave me alone i feel good amen but then she had to go back in the closet and get royal purple so god could look it ain't for those that scorn in the mess because they ain't gonna believe it anyhow somebody told me i know i i google it in and that is not really purple man i don't care what you're saying the prophecy come to pass 87 years it came to pass when jesus said don't let your flight be in the winter now on the sabbath day 40 years later titles came in the city it came to past church

light and popping tornado oh man oh god it's powerful church god is powerful well what about things that goes on around us man they don't know that is that they just don't know look how they're plotting uh so where you think god is at when we sit in that plot god's standing over our shoulder just looking how you heard man there ain't nothing that god and to think about it he allowed he allowed things to happen because they got you got to go that way my god look at joseph look at joseph amen a man that was well respect of the king right and the king laughed at joseph man joseph was a lovable young man well-mannered the king thought so much of him politics right thought so much am i right can i get a full amen uh amen so amen so powerful goes away and he put joseph in charge man joseph walking through the palace he's just looking you know he he's the man he's running the show but god said no son no i got something else for you but joseph is walking through this looking over over the palace and man and just make sure the pool is looking good and joseph just walking and all the maze and everything but literally that joseph knew god had to let this woman get anointed y'all need to help me preach now god i allow this woman to get anointed when she look at that young boy my husband be leaving in a moment she the lord god having it done because joseph needed to be in prison i wish i had a full amen in here joseph needed to be in prison oh po joe the pro joseph nothing god is controlling but then joseph goes there and and perhaps he out there swimming you know i

might be too high on your horses huh you want to ride them big king horses but god wants you to let people know you're not where you think you are i know a preacher minister came and and men's at the church man this brother could preach man this brother could take the seals and man he could break it down he's anointed and man he got the preaching and they went out to lunch and when they went out to lunch i'm just going to be me okay they went out to lunch and everybody would well respect him and he wanted me respect i told brother ed yesterday look ain't nothing good about me the only thing different i'm up here and y'all down there that's the only thing different and right now i'm just as nervous as i could be sometimes cause i don't know what god's getting ready for me to say are you hearing me but this man got lifted up but god said you know what you got too much pride you think you're the greatest preacher you think you're so great you you ever seen some people can look down on you huh they think they're a little bit better than you just uh just uh about a foot more better than you you know i'm a minister so i'm a little bit better than you huh they respect me i'm a little bit more than you whoa whoa well what man ever thought he was a little bit better wasn't for the blood of jesus man i've been going straight to hell y'all don't like that kind of preaching up here don't you amen but it's the god of heaven true who is man or thou mindful there ain't no holy man there ain't no holy church it's a holy god that's in the church ain't no holy mountain my son was on fire because god came down and wasn't for the holy ghost may i won't be worth a a dime but this man got lifted up got pride within himself he got lifted up and he they're going out to lunch and they brought bragging on him he's a mighty man he's a boy he's a thunder preacher but he could break it down and he was outside money has been is everybody glory to him he's the man of god this man got this and that and all of a sudden i don't know where that bird come from b-i-r-d god said bird go the bird didn't know why he was going that way but god's seen him i'm going to show this man up and the bird amen couldn't make it to the restroom huh and the bird just let it all out and that man hauled up a hollow out a mean curse and he said oh my god i'm sorry get on down get on down get on down you you thank you better you better look look there ain't no preacher can save you god god never did intend for man to run a church why do you think why you think churches in a mess what they are today because man got their little ideas that's why the prophet of god said in the seal book page 19 it might have changed but he said see only what the tape said and i'm not talking about a tape ministry that's why we got to stay with what the prophet said that's why i don't want no other commentary telling me nothing i want to say what dust said to the lord that's who i want to listen at that's who i want to play in my house yeah td jakes can't tell me nothing huh somebody what what the benny hand could tell me are you hearing me are you hearing me what old robbers could tell me amen i need to hear the voice for my day that's why i get raptured in faith can somebody say amen see all that other stuff amen it might be a stomach it stepped me to the next place but the bible said in the days of the voice of the seventh danger i told my wife i said it's okay to listen that different ministry if you want to listen that but you better make sure you stay with that tape teaching but somebody would have their own idea but god is running everything so moses moses goes up to pharaoh let my people go and and pharaoh's sitting there and with all his musicians right there and moses says let my people go for who told you all this god he said who is god well that's mighty strong and mo pharaoh say i know not god and moses almost saying what you're going to find out his error
