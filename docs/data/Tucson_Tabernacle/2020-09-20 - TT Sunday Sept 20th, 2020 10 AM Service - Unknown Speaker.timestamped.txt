[28:00] heavenly father
[28:03] lord jesus who ever was inspired to
[28:07] write the words of that song is exactly
[28:10] how we feel this morning
[28:13] your presence is
[28:18] critical and it's
[28:21] something we just appreciate and adore
[28:24] so
[28:24] much and with those words it's our way
[28:29] of
[28:29] welcoming you here this morning it's our
[28:32] way of saying
[28:34] we want you here
[28:38] it's another way we say of because of
[28:41] your great atonement
[28:44] we stand justified this morning in your
[28:47] presence that we might worship you
[28:50] and that we might ask for your
[28:51] leadership this morning
[28:53] for you are the head of this body
[28:57] you are the head you are the one that
[28:59] paid a price for
[29:00] all of us and we want to say
[29:04] thank you
[29:07] i wish we had words to
[29:10] express more how we feel about you
[29:14] but if you would take the meditations of
[29:17] our heart
[29:19] and consider that as a spirit of worship
[29:23] to you this morning
[29:25] we love you we appreciate you and as the
[29:28] brother
[29:29] said we want you here we want you to
[29:32] come and open doors in our heart
[29:34] that maybe we've kept a little bit
[29:36] closed
[29:37] maybe we didn't shut them but we just i
[29:40] know my own life sometimes i just
[29:42] kind of don't open that door all the way
[29:46] and
[29:46] so would you come this morning
[29:48] [Music]
[29:50] and visit every door in our heart
[29:53] and may we learn to open them and to
[29:56] give you the preeminence in your church
[29:59] that you deserve once again we'd like to
[30:05] tell you we love you and we want you to
[30:08] feel welcomed and pleased to move

[30:14] and we all want to give you the glory
[30:17] and we want to give you the honor
[30:20] in the name of jesus christ we ask these
[30:22] favors
[30:24] and if there is any here that's not
[30:26] feeling well
[30:27] spiritually or physically would you pay
[30:30] special attention to that as kings and
[30:33] priests we want them
[30:35] to sit under that great atonement

[58:42] my family is sick
[58:47] yes lord my
[58:51] [Music]
[58:55] the battle is over
[58:58] victory is won
[59:01] it's already done
[59:05] give the lord a praise offering with
[59:06] your hands this morning
[59:08] hallelujah
[59:12] hallelujah amen believe that
[59:15] praise god appreciate that worship god
[59:17] bless you amen i greet you this morning
[59:19] hebrews chapter 12.
[59:20] you just want to keep playing that just
[59:21] for a moment as they find their place
[59:23] just play that softly
[59:25] hebrews chapter 12 while you're finding
[59:27] your place i'd like to say that
[59:29] just one announcement that we have
[59:33] concerning sunday school it's been upon
[59:35] our heart to uh
[59:36] to implement a sunday school for the
[59:38] children and uh we haven't
[59:40] figured it all out yet i just wanted to
[59:42] put that forward to you that
[59:44] we are working on that and trying to
[59:46] structure it amen in a way that would be
[59:48] that would fit and would work
[59:50] not sure really yet of the ages
[59:53] um and where the classes how many
[59:55] classes we'll have
[59:57] but i just want to say that uh you know
[59:59] the bible says that you should train up
[1:00:00] a child in the way that he should go
[1:00:03] and that when he's old he won't depart
[1:00:05] from it and so
[1:00:06] we can see that pattern throughout the
[1:00:08] whole bible that
[1:00:10] david would repeat it jeremiah would
[1:00:12] repeat it i'll cause you to hear my
[1:00:14] words and
[1:00:15] then you shall teach it to your children
[1:00:17] and then their children shall teach
[1:00:18] their children another generation
[1:00:21] david repeats it over and over all
[1:00:22] throughout the entire bible and so we
[1:00:24] know it's important we know that
[1:00:26] that there's a there's a value in
[1:00:28] teaching the word of god
[1:00:30] that starts at the home from the mother
[1:00:32] amen and the sunday school teacher
[1:00:34] doesn't replace that
[1:00:35] you don't you don't come to church
[1:00:37] necessarily to
[1:00:39] to have a relationship with the lord now
[1:00:41] you can start here
[1:00:43] but church isn't about having a race a
[1:00:45] relationship or even a spiritual
[1:00:47] experience with the lord
[1:00:48] church is to enrich the experience you
[1:00:51] already have
[1:00:53] amen churches to take a spiritual
[1:00:55] experience that your relationship you
[1:00:56] already have your children are to know
[1:00:58] the lord from what they're told at home
[1:01:00] and then we help to instill that amen
[1:01:02] and so we believe it's important we want
[1:01:04] to have that
[1:01:05] and so there will be more announcements
[1:01:07] coming for
[1:01:08] the structure of that how that will look
[1:01:11] if you have a desire
[1:01:12] something upon your heart you want to
[1:01:14] say if i could be of help we can't use
[1:01:16] everybody but if you want to express
[1:01:17] that amen just let us know if you have
[1:01:19] you know have a desire to do that
[1:01:22] amen and we'll sure appreciate that you
[1:01:23] love the lord
[1:01:25] amen thank you for all the music book of
[1:01:27] romans if you have your bible we'll just
[1:01:29] have you turn
[1:01:30] i'm sorry hebrews chapter 12 book of
[1:01:33] hebrews chapter 12.
[1:01:34] we just want to read just a portion of
[1:01:36] scripture here and then have you be
[1:01:38] seated
[1:01:39] amen looking forward to tonight as for
[1:01:41] the lyle amen johnson to speak for us
[1:01:43] lord put that upon my heart so i'm in an
[1:01:45] anticipation for that amen but wanting
[1:01:48] to see what the lord has for us today i
[1:01:50] believe he has something amen specific
[1:01:53] amen for his children for you for me
[1:01:58] say lord i believe you have something
[1:01:59] specific something you want to say
[1:02:02] brothers if you have that power point
[1:02:03] you can display that whenever you want
[1:02:05] or the scriptures first would be fine
[1:02:07] hebrews chapter 12 verse 18 i just want
[1:02:09] to read a portion here
[1:02:11] i'd like to speak to you this morning on
[1:02:13] refuse not
[1:02:15] the voice refuse not
[1:02:18] the voice for you are not come
[1:02:23] unto the mount that might be touched and
[1:02:25] that burned with fire now
[1:02:27] we're going to read in deuteronomy 4 and
[1:02:29] 5 where what paul is referencing here in
[1:02:31] hebrews
[1:02:32] but he says for you are not common to
[1:02:34] the mount that might be touched
[1:02:36] and that burn with fire nor into
[1:02:39] blackness
[1:02:40] and darkness and tempest and the sound
[1:02:43] of a trumpet and the sound of words
[1:02:45] which voice they that heard
[1:02:49] entreated that the word should not be
[1:02:51] spoken to them
[1:02:52] anymore for they could not endure
[1:02:56] that which was commanded now notice and
[1:02:58] if so much as a beast
[1:03:00] touch the mountain it shall be stoned or
[1:03:03] thrust through with the dart
[1:03:04] and so terrible was the sight that word
[1:03:07] terrible
[1:03:08] is a word that we maybe would think
[1:03:11] you know in our english word terrible
[1:03:13] would be awful but uh this word here is
[1:03:15] actually
[1:03:16] would would you'd misunderstand if you
[1:03:18] understood it that way it actually is
[1:03:20] our english word
[1:03:21] awesome and so he says
[1:03:25] here in verse 21 and so awesome
[1:03:28] was the sight awesome is also a word
[1:03:32] that we could misunderstand
[1:03:33] because we think of cool we think of you
[1:03:36] know something great but that's really
[1:03:37] not what awesome means
[1:03:39] awesome is something that is grand
[1:03:42] glorious
[1:03:43] great hard to be fathomed hard to take
[1:03:46] in
[1:03:47] and he says that it was so awesome so
[1:03:50] magnificent so powerful
[1:03:52] that moses said now here's god's prophet
[1:03:56] i exceedingly fear
[1:03:59] and quake but you are coming to mount
[1:04:03] zion
[1:04:04] and unto the city of the living god the
[1:04:07] heavenly jerusalem
[1:04:09] and to an innumerable company of angels
[1:04:13] to the general assembly and church of
[1:04:16] the firstborn
[1:04:17] which are written in heaven and to god
[1:04:20] the judge of all i love this
[1:04:22] and to the spirits of just men made
[1:04:24] perfect
[1:04:26] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[1:04:29] covenant
[1:04:30] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[1:04:32] speaketh better
[1:04:34] things than that of abel
[1:04:37] see that you refuse not him that
[1:04:40] speaketh
[1:04:41] for if they escape not who refused him
[1:04:43] that spoke on earth
[1:04:45] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[1:04:49] away from him
[1:04:50] that speaketh from heaven whose voice
[1:04:54] then shook the earth but now
[1:04:57] he hath promised saying yet once more i
[1:05:01] shake not the earth only
[1:05:03] but also heaven and this word yet once
[1:05:06] more
[1:05:06] signifieth the removing of those things
[1:05:09] that are shaken
[1:05:10] as of things that are made that those
[1:05:13] things which cannot be
[1:05:14] shaken may remain wherefore
[1:05:18] we receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:05:22] moved i love that let us have grace
[1:05:26] whereby we may serve god acceptably with
[1:05:29] reverence and godly fear for our god
[1:05:32] is a consuming fire let's just bow our
[1:05:34] heads if you have a need something upon
[1:05:36] your heart you just want to raise your
[1:05:37] hand to the lord

[1:05:55] lord man can't
[1:05:57] you can't uh try to hype it up lord
[1:06:00] though many have tried
[1:06:01] but lord when that voice of god speaks
[1:06:03] to the heart of your child
[1:06:05] lord it's it's something that's unique
[1:06:07] something that's sovereign something

[1:06:14] done my part lord put myself aside in
[1:06:17] prayer
[1:06:18] lord in meditation now god come and
[1:06:20] break the bread of life to each and
[1:06:22] every single one for this
[1:06:23] sunday morning service we ask in jesus
[1:06:26] christ's name
[1:06:27] amen you can be seated this morning
[1:06:34] you could put my powerpoint if you could
[1:06:36] brothers up i believe one of the
[1:06:38] greatest
[1:06:40] one of the greatest blessings
[1:06:43] uh as a child of god as a son or
[1:06:46] daughter of god
[1:06:47] is the blessing to hear the voice of god
[1:06:51] and it's possible today to hear the
[1:06:53] voice of god
[1:06:54] sister asked me here recently brother
[1:06:56] matt how do you mention about hearing
[1:06:58] the voice of god and
[1:06:59] you know does that mean that it you know
[1:07:01] do you actually hear an audible voice or
[1:07:03] you know and and she was asking a
[1:07:05] reference because she's looked in her
[1:07:06] own life
[1:07:08] and i you know just said in my own self
[1:07:10] i said you know my testimony is
[1:07:11] is that god's voice is has spoken to me
[1:07:14] many times in my life and in many
[1:07:17] different ways
[1:07:19] you know he's spoken through men he's
[1:07:21] spoken through the agency of man he
[1:07:23] speaks when i open the word and i read
[1:07:25] the word of god
[1:07:27] it becomes more than just what i read or
[1:07:29] what i you know can intellectually
[1:07:31] understand but i hear the voice of god
[1:07:33] speaking solomon spoke of it and said
[1:07:36] the voice of my beloved
[1:07:38] you know and so you know the voice of
[1:07:40] your beloved
[1:07:41] i've heard it through the tapes of god's
[1:07:43] prophet i could hear the voice of god
[1:07:45] and i could hear what god's saying to me
[1:07:47] specifically
[1:07:49] i could hear the voice of god through a
[1:07:51] prayer
[1:07:52] maybe that someone prays and then other
[1:07:54] times god has came in my prayer closet
[1:07:57] and maybe that's not a literal place but
[1:08:00] sometimes my prayer closet is in my
[1:08:02] vehicle driving down the road
[1:08:03] sometimes it's at work sometimes it's at
[1:08:06] church
[1:08:06] sometimes it's laying on my laying my
[1:08:09] head on my pillow at night
[1:08:10] and just pondering the things of god and
[1:08:13] and then suddenly
[1:08:14] uh the voice of god begins to speak to
[1:08:17] my heart and i know that it's his voice
[1:08:20] say brother matt is that possible jesus
[1:08:22] said my sheep
[1:08:24] knows my voice they hear my voice and a
[1:08:26] stranger they will not
[1:08:28] follow you know brother branham says
[1:08:30] this here he says even of
[1:08:32] industry and let me turn this on here
[1:08:36] he says i'm just your brother but by the
[1:08:37] grace of god when the angel of the lord
[1:08:40] moves down it becomes then a voice of
[1:08:42] god to you
[1:08:43] maybe if i offended you by saying that
[1:08:45] forgive me
[1:08:47] but i felt that might be resented but i
[1:08:49] am god's voice to you
[1:08:51] see i say that again that time was under
[1:08:55] inspiration
[1:08:56] see i felt bad about it the first time
[1:08:59] but it repeated it i'm god's voice to
[1:09:01] you
[1:09:02] brother branham before he says this he
[1:09:04] said it becomes then when the angel of
[1:09:05] the lord moves down
[1:09:07] it becomes then a voice of god to you so
[1:09:09] it's more than just a kentucky
[1:09:11] hillbilly's
[1:09:12] uh seventh grade education or his his la
[1:09:15] his
[1:09:15] uh his grammar it becomes more than just
[1:09:18] a tape
[1:09:19] it becomes more than just a preacher but
[1:09:21] it becomes the voice of god to you
[1:09:23] it's speaking to you lip to ear
[1:09:27] and you say brother matt well then that
[1:09:29] then i just you know i just have to turn
[1:09:30] on the tape now listen to what brother
[1:09:31] branham says here because a lot of
[1:09:33] people have
[1:09:34] have have you know as they have done
[1:09:36] many times you can take any one quote
[1:09:38] and make a doctor and make an entire
[1:09:40] uh denomination out of it listen to what
[1:09:43] brother branham says to make sure you
[1:09:44] catch the thought here
[1:09:45] and he says now god could have sent the
[1:09:47] angel down couldn't he
[1:09:49] he could have let the angel come himself
[1:09:52] but instead of that
[1:09:54] he sent the angel to speak through the
[1:09:57] voice
[1:09:57] of a man god always
[1:10:01] used man for his work
[1:10:06] is that right he don't use organizations
[1:10:09] or so forth and mechanical devices
[1:10:12] but he uses men the holy spirit fell
[1:10:16] upon men that's
[1:10:20] god's instrument on earth
[1:10:25] now we know this here from the bible the
[1:10:27] bible
[1:10:28] goes on we can we can just really lay a
[1:10:30] really long foundation and have no time
[1:10:32] but he says here he says that it's a
[1:10:34] it's a voice
[1:10:36] backing up the hebrews here he says he
[1:10:38] has given us a promise and a warning
[1:10:39] about hearing his voice now listen to
[1:10:41] what he says here
[1:10:42] he says you are coming to mount zion
[1:10:44] unto the city of the living god
[1:10:46] the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable
[1:10:48] company
[1:10:50] of angels so you can hear the voice of
[1:10:52] god because you're not coming to the
[1:10:54] mountain of fire and quaking
[1:10:55] that can't be touched but you're come
[1:10:57] you've you've come to the
[1:10:58] the assembly of the firstborn mount zion
[1:11:02] listen what brother madam says here it's
[1:11:04] like this microphone that i'm speaking
[1:11:06] through
[1:11:06] that microphone is a mute unless there's
[1:11:09] something to speak
[1:11:10] through it it can't speak through itself
[1:11:13] it's got to have something to speak
[1:11:15] through so it's not the microphone
[1:11:18] it's the voice the noise behind that the
[1:11:22] microphone
[1:11:22] transmits to the airwave
[1:11:26] to your ear it was never about the
[1:11:29] literal voice
[1:11:30] it was never about the literal mountain
[1:11:32] it was never about the literal
[1:11:34] voice brother branham speaks about the
[1:11:36] literal blood and he says even if you
[1:11:38] had a
[1:11:38] literal vial a vial a real vial of the
[1:11:42] blood of jesus
[1:11:43] he said it wouldn't save you because
[1:11:45] it's not the it's not the chemistry
[1:11:48] it's the life that's in the blood
[1:11:52] so it's not about people get people can
[1:11:54] become catholicism has turned everything
[1:11:57] uh into natural things into natural
[1:12:00] uh rosary beads and hail mary's and
[1:12:03] people come and do their penance and
[1:12:05] somehow they think because they did a
[1:12:07] natural act that
[1:12:08] they that that you know something
[1:12:10] natural to them that appeases their
[1:12:11] conscience
[1:12:12] but brother madam said it's not about
[1:12:14] it's not about uh uh hail mary's or
[1:12:17] or or rosaries or or say your penance or
[1:12:20] your confession to a priest it's about
[1:12:22] the life behind the blood
[1:12:24] it's about the spirit of the of god
[1:12:27] speaking through the agency of man
[1:12:30] it's not about the words that i speak
[1:12:32] today it's not about my voice
[1:12:34] it's about what you hear if you hear the
[1:12:36] voice of god
[1:12:38] when the angel lord comes down it
[1:12:39] becomes a voice of god to you listen
[1:12:41] what brother branham says here
[1:12:42] now that's the way it is in preaching
[1:12:45] the gospel it's not we
[1:12:49] ourselves as ministers we are not the
[1:12:51] gospel
[1:12:52] but we are only transmitters
[1:12:56] that transmit the voice of god
[1:12:59] through our agency now he didn't leave
[1:13:01] he didn't bring it all to himself he
[1:13:03] didn't say i'm the only voice that god
[1:13:05] speaks through
[1:13:06] brother branham says but the preaching
[1:13:07] of the gospel is the voice of god to you
[1:13:11] say brother matt how do i hear the voice
[1:13:12] of god uh believe in god
[1:13:16] with all your heart the bible said jesus
[1:13:19] said it this way he said if you
[1:13:20] seek me with all your heart and i'll be
[1:13:22] found of you
[1:13:25] he's a he's a rewarder of those that
[1:13:27] diligently
[1:13:29] seek him he says we as ministers are
[1:13:32] only transmitters that
[1:13:33] transmit the voice of god through our
[1:13:36] agency of men
[1:13:38] to the hearer you believe that
[1:13:45] so you can hear as you say brother matt
[1:13:46] can we hear the voice of god today as
[1:13:48] clearly as samuel heard it
[1:13:50] as clearly as david heard it as clearly
[1:13:52] as paul heard it as peter heard it as
[1:13:54] the new testament church
[1:13:55] as john on the owl of patnas patmos
[1:13:58] heard it
[1:13:58] his voice has become clearer in this
[1:14:01] age than any other age
[1:14:07] and god's voice is speaking it's got a
[1:14:10] message we've been saying it to you for
[1:14:12] two weekends now
[1:14:13] the voice of god is speaking whether you
[1:14:14] hear it or not
[1:14:17] whose voice hebrews 12 26 whose voice
[1:14:20] then shook the earth but now
[1:14:22] he hath promised saying yet once more i
[1:14:24] shake not the earth only
[1:14:27] but also heaven and so
[1:14:30] god is speaking of something here and he
[1:14:31] says in hebrews
[1:14:33] verse 27 here verse 26 he says whose
[1:14:35] voice then shake the earth but now as
[1:14:37] promised i shake not only earth but also
[1:14:39] heaven
[1:14:40] so here's god's warning to to the family
[1:14:42] of god not to the heathen
[1:14:44] but to the believer here's his warning
[1:14:46] verse 25
[1:14:47] hebrews 12 verse 25 see that you
[1:14:50] refuse not him that speaketh
[1:14:54] amen for if they escape not who refused
[1:14:58] him that spoke on earth much more shall
[1:15:00] not we escape if we turn away from him
[1:15:02] that speaketh from heaven
[1:15:05] god's spirit's crying it's been crying
[1:15:07] for generation after generation
[1:15:09] come out of her my people be not a
[1:15:11] partaker of her sins
[1:15:13] why is god calling because god's got to
[1:15:15] have a people he's got to have an
[1:15:16] elected group of people
[1:15:18] who aren't troubled by the trouble of
[1:15:20] the last day who aren't shaken by the
[1:15:22] shaking of the last day
[1:15:24] hour who are in crisis though the rest
[1:15:26] of the world's at crisis
[1:15:28] he's got to have a generation of people
[1:15:30] who can
[1:15:31] hear the voice of god who can react to
[1:15:33] the voice of god
[1:15:34] who can live daily hearing that voice
[1:15:37] that speaks to their soul
[1:15:42] god speaks and it's a clear voice
[1:15:45] and you live by that voice those people
[1:15:49] are directed
[1:15:50] by that you say brother matt why do we
[1:15:52] need the voice of god because it's your
[1:15:53] direction in your life
[1:15:56] the sons of god are led by the spirit of
[1:15:58] god
[1:16:00] it gives you direction uh that voice
[1:16:04] is your comfort in the midst of
[1:16:06] troubling times what comforts you the
[1:16:09] voice of god
[1:16:10] who speaks to me maybe through a song
[1:16:12] maybe through a musical instrument maybe
[1:16:14] through a sermon maybe through a prayer
[1:16:16] maybe through his presence but he's
[1:16:18] speaking
[1:16:20] it's your guidance
[1:16:24] and the people of god are governed by
[1:16:26] the word of god
[1:16:29] i want you to notice this here as we
[1:16:30] just just bear with me as we lay this
[1:16:32] foundation
[1:16:33] god has always spoke to his children uh
[1:16:35] adam and eve the bible says in genesis 3
[1:16:37] 18 heard the voice of god
[1:16:39] speaking heard the voice of god speaking
[1:16:41] in the cool of the evening
[1:16:42] brother branham said god would come down
[1:16:44] and speak to his children
[1:16:46] uh it was even sin what was what was the
[1:16:49] bible says it was sin who came into the
[1:16:51] into their hearts that calls them to not
[1:16:54] hear the voice of god
[1:16:56] the but the bible says here that they
[1:16:58] heard the voice in the garden
[1:16:59] and was afraid
[1:17:03] so the same voice that brought comfort
[1:17:04] brought fear suddenly because of sin
[1:17:08] abraham the bible says the father of
[1:17:11] nations
[1:17:11] the father of nations the bible says
[1:17:14] that abraham
[1:17:15] notice this in genesis 22 18 you might
[1:17:17] just want to get some scriptures ready
[1:17:19] brother because i'm going to read a lot
[1:17:20] of them
[1:17:21] and i want to put them up genesis
[1:17:23] chapter
[1:17:24] 22 verse 18 this is the promise and in
[1:17:28] thy seed shall all the nations of the
[1:17:30] earth
[1:17:31] be blessed because this is genesis 22
[1:17:34] verse 18
[1:17:35] because thou has obeyed
[1:17:39] my voice
[1:17:44] he says this series says because that
[1:17:46] abraham has obeyed my voice look at
[1:17:48] verse 5
[1:17:48] genesis 26 verse 5
[1:17:52] because that abraham obeyed my voice
[1:17:55] kept my charge
[1:17:56] my commandments my statutes my laws what
[1:17:59] did my what was abraham doing
[1:18:01] he was not just hearing the voice of god
[1:18:03] he was becoming obedient to the voice of
[1:18:05] god
[1:18:08] he says in exodus 19 verse 19.
[1:18:11] and when the voice of the trumpet
[1:18:13] sounded long and waxed louder and louder
[1:18:15] moses
[1:18:16] spoke and god answered him
[1:18:19] by a voice
[1:18:22] god answered him by a voice
[1:18:26] so moses didn't do anything without
[1:18:28] hearing that voice
[1:18:30] always had to hear the voice of god for
[1:18:32] his life
[1:18:34] the bible says in exodus 19 24
[1:18:37] i want i want you to pick this up if you
[1:18:39] have it exodus 19 let's start with verse
[1:18:42] 21
[1:18:42] uh brother exodus 19 21 good and the
[1:18:45] lord notice this dialogue here
[1:18:48] and the lord said unto moses
[1:18:51] and the lord said unto moses look at
[1:18:53] verse 23
[1:18:56] verse 23 and moses said unto the lord
[1:19:00] the lord said unto moses and moses said
[1:19:03] unto the lord look at verse 24
[1:19:05] then the very next verse and the lord
[1:19:08] said unto him
[1:19:12] look at look at chapter 20 verse 1
[1:19:15] and god spoke what is it what is what is
[1:19:18] he saying here
[1:19:19] this is a this is this is more than just
[1:19:21] a religion
[1:19:22] this is more than just a a you know a
[1:19:25] worshiper out of duty this is a
[1:19:27] relationship you're reading about
[1:19:29] it's god speaking to moses and moses
[1:19:32] said unto the lord
[1:19:32] and the lord said to moses and moses
[1:19:34] said unto the lord
[1:19:36] and god spoke to moses and then moses
[1:19:38] said back what's he typing
[1:19:39] it's going to be more than just
[1:19:41] religious duty but the voice of god is
[1:19:43] going to speak
[1:19:44] and there's going to be a people to not
[1:19:46] only hear
[1:19:47] but a people who speak back to the lord
[1:19:54] and god's voice was speaking a voice
[1:19:57] that's alive a voice that says
[1:19:59] that's speaking he says in deuteronomy
[1:20:01] chapter 4
[1:20:02] and verse 10 gather me the people
[1:20:05] together
[1:20:06] and i will make them hear my words that
[1:20:08] they may learn to fear me all the days
[1:20:10] that thou shalt live upon the earth this
[1:20:12] is deuteronomy 4
[1:20:13] 10. uh uh he says and
[1:20:17] and they may teach their children notice
[1:20:20] this here
[1:20:20] they may live upon the earth that they
[1:20:22] may teach their
[1:20:24] children uh he says here in chapter
[1:20:27] and verse 12 and the lord spake unto you
[1:20:30] out of the midst of the fire you heard
[1:20:31] the voice of the words
[1:20:33] but saw no similitude only
[1:20:36] you heard a voice the lord spoken to you
[1:20:40] in the midst of the fire you heard the
[1:20:42] voice of the words
[1:20:43] but you didn't see the similitude what
[1:20:45] is the similitude it's the form
[1:20:48] in other words god is saying the form is
[1:20:50] not what's important
[1:20:52] brother branham said it this way he said
[1:20:53] god god
[1:20:55] changes his masks
[1:20:58] but his character never changes
[1:21:03] you you saw no similitude you saw no
[1:21:06] form because the form of the voice of
[1:21:08] god takes on many different
[1:21:10] forms it isn't going to be one form or
[1:21:14] one picture one portrait or one god says
[1:21:16] but you saw no
[1:21:17] you heard the voice what was important
[1:21:19] is that you heard the voice of god
[1:21:22] and i want you to notice this here he
[1:21:24] says you you saw no similitude
[1:21:27] out of the midst of the fire and and and
[1:21:29] he says here
[1:21:30] in in verse 33 did ever
[1:21:33] people hear the voice of god speaking
[1:21:35] out of the midst of the fire as thou
[1:21:37] has heard and live he says in verse 36
[1:21:41] out of heaven
[1:21:42] he made thee to hear his voice that he
[1:21:45] might instruct thee
[1:21:47] thou heardest his words
[1:21:52] thou earnest his words chapter 5
[1:21:55] the next chapter verse 24 and you
[1:21:58] said we have heard his voice we have
[1:22:01] seen
[1:22:02] this day that god does talk with man
[1:22:06] and live
[1:22:12] so there was there was a type for the
[1:22:14] chin of israel
[1:22:15] they now notice i want you to notice
[1:22:17] this shift i want you to notice this
[1:22:18] turn here because it's important
[1:22:20] and chapter 5 verse 25 now therefore
[1:22:24] why should we die for this great fire
[1:22:27] will consume us
[1:22:28] if we hear the voice of the lord our god
[1:22:31] any more
[1:22:32] then we shall die for who is there of
[1:22:35] all flesh that hath heard the voice of
[1:22:37] the living god speaking out of the midst
[1:22:38] of the fires we haven't lived
[1:22:40] go thou near and hear all the lord our
[1:22:43] god shall say
[1:22:44] and speak thou unto us all that the lord
[1:22:46] our god shall speak unto thee
[1:22:48] and we will hear it and we will do it
[1:22:51] isn't it amazing i i just want to i want
[1:22:55] to stop here just for a moment
[1:22:57] you notice this is this is what paul is
[1:22:59] speaking of in hebrews chapter 12.
[1:23:02] and he says he says here here they are
[1:23:05] they're they're they're they're israel's
[1:23:08] camped at mount sinai
[1:23:11] and they've they they were suddenly this
[1:23:13] great
[1:23:14] fire this great darkness just engulfs
[1:23:17] the whole mountain
[1:23:18] and the scripture says this blazing uh
[1:23:21] fire and this this
[1:23:22] thunderings and this this loud noise all
[1:23:25] of these things
[1:23:25] what was it it was it was a visible
[1:23:29] manifestation
[1:23:30] of jehovah who they had been following
[1:23:33] through a prophet through god's prophet
[1:23:35] through god's messenger
[1:23:36] and now god comes down himself and he
[1:23:39] lights the mountain on fire
[1:23:40] there's roaring there's thundering
[1:23:42] there's power there's glory there's
[1:23:44] lightning flashing
[1:23:46] thunder rolling and
[1:23:49] and and out of the midst god out of all
[1:23:52] of that god speaks
[1:23:55] and he says these words the lord spoke
[1:23:57] unto you
[1:23:58] unto all of your assembly deuteronomy 5
[1:24:01] 22
[1:24:02] and the mountain of the midst of fire of
[1:24:04] the cloud of the thick darkness with a
[1:24:05] great
[1:24:06] voice so now these mountains are on fire
[1:24:11] they're all
[1:24:12] uh and what was that it was a
[1:24:14] supernatural was the consuming fire
[1:24:17] and here this great power and glory of
[1:24:20] god as you could hear the thunder and
[1:24:21] see the lightning and
[1:24:23] and then through all of that through all
[1:24:25] of the all of the awesomeness
[1:24:27] here comes the voice of jehovah the same
[1:24:31] one who said to the darkness let there
[1:24:32] be light and there was light
[1:24:34] the same one who spoke to the sea oh
[1:24:36] spoke to the to the winds and the air
[1:24:38] and the water
[1:24:39] the same voice of creation oh brother
[1:24:42] benham said breathe upon seeds and life
[1:24:44] came forth
[1:24:46] and now that voice is speaking to the
[1:24:48] god's people
[1:24:49] and the and the bible says god's voice
[1:24:51] spoke utterly
[1:24:52] uh audibly and now all israel hears this
[1:24:55] and the scripture says paul says in
[1:24:57] hebrews is that they froze
[1:24:59] they were paralyzed by such a great
[1:25:02] voice
[1:25:03] and they were so convicted that they
[1:25:04] would die
[1:25:06] if the lord didn't stop speaking
[1:25:09] the bible says that even moses who was a
[1:25:12] friend of god
[1:25:13] exceedingly quaked and feared
[1:25:18] and then the the the thunder stops
[1:25:22] the lightning stops and
[1:25:25] and all of the glory you could just hear
[1:25:26] the thunder just
[1:25:28] suddenly get quieter and quieter and
[1:25:30] quieter and you imagine put yourself
[1:25:32] there with such an awesome experience
[1:25:35] such a such a power such a glory
[1:25:39] or it was more than any sacrifice it was
[1:25:41] it was it was beyond any any religion
[1:25:44] it was now the voice of the living god
[1:25:46] who spoke
[1:25:50] imagine after you came out of that kind
[1:25:52] of of of
[1:25:53] of encounter with god you would no doubt
[1:25:55] just be shaken for
[1:25:57] for months for years it would have such
[1:25:59] an effect on you
[1:26:02] and the bible says that after it all
[1:26:04] stopped
[1:26:05] they after that great you know powerful
[1:26:08] manifestation of this
[1:26:10] of the living god had stopped
[1:26:13] the bible says that israel calls a
[1:26:16] meeting
[1:26:21] all the heads of the tribes call them
[1:26:23] meeting and that you know you'd expect
[1:26:25] them to
[1:26:26] say oh moses oh it was such a powerful
[1:26:28] thing on such a glorious thing all the
[1:26:30] power of god the voice of god
[1:26:32] oh we just want more of that we just oh
[1:26:34] if that could just happen in every
[1:26:36] service if that could happen every day
[1:26:38] that's what you'd expect
[1:26:41] but actually it was quite the opposite
[1:26:44] they said you know this was amazing this
[1:26:46] was this was amazing this was this was
[1:26:48] powerful moses this was
[1:26:49] you know other people have heard the
[1:26:51] voice of god and lived and we heard the
[1:26:53] voice of god
[1:26:54] and and and we seen the fire we heard
[1:26:56] the thunder and we survived we're still
[1:26:58] here we can tell our grandchildren about
[1:27:00] this experience
[1:27:01] there was a day when god spoke to us you
[1:27:04] know the
[1:27:04] the the even you can imagine some of
[1:27:06] those levitical some of those priests uh
[1:27:08] saying oh oh well you know we've got
[1:27:10] such such a testimony to tell
[1:27:13] such a life uh altering experience
[1:27:20] and you could even hear don't forget
[1:27:22] this day we we've got to remember this
[1:27:24] day the day that the lord again they
[1:27:25] memorialized it
[1:27:28] we've experienced it firsthand the
[1:27:31] almighty
[1:27:32] god and we lived
[1:27:35] yet now the now they say now that we've
[1:27:37] had that experience
[1:27:40] moses we can't handle that again
[1:27:44] can't handle that kind of experience
[1:27:46] moses listen to what the the voice of
[1:27:48] their words say
[1:27:49] even in hebrews 12 the scripture we read
[1:27:50] here i want you to hold your bible open
[1:27:52] to that
[1:27:53] uh he says for they could not endure
[1:27:55] that which was command
[1:27:56] command notice verse 19 and the sound of
[1:27:59] the trumpet and the voice of words which
[1:28:01] voice they that heard entreated that the
[1:28:05] word
[1:28:06] should not
[1:28:09] be spoken
[1:28:14] what they baffled me when i read that
[1:28:16] wait a minute you just heard this great
[1:28:18] powerful voice and now you're asking you
[1:28:20] know that was good and all but
[1:28:21] no more moses that was just a little bit
[1:28:25] too much for us to handle
[1:28:28] and then they go further than that and
[1:28:30] they they say we don't we don't we can't
[1:28:31] handle it we don't want to hear god's
[1:28:33] voice like that anymore moses
[1:28:35] we don't want to hear that anymore we
[1:28:36] love the voice of god but but but but if
[1:28:38] he speaks in this way again
[1:28:40] you know from from now on what here's
[1:28:42] what we want moses we want to hear the
[1:28:44] voice of god but we want it to come
[1:28:46] through
[1:28:46] someone else will you hear god for us
[1:28:52] and then when you speak will you speak
[1:28:53] to us you see man doesn't they don't
[1:28:56] want the responsibility of hearing the
[1:28:57] voice of god directly for themselves
[1:29:00] so what have we done for generations
[1:29:01] we've passed it off to a priest
[1:29:03] or to a bishop or to a prophet or to a
[1:29:05] minister
[1:29:06] or to a pastor
[1:29:15] we don't want that responsibility i
[1:29:16] don't want that out you know moses
[1:29:18] here's what we'll do we got a plan moses
[1:29:19] you're god's prophet you go and speak to
[1:29:21] god
[1:29:21] hear the voice of god you experience
[1:29:23] that then you come and filter it down
[1:29:24] you know give it to us
[1:29:26] we can handle that we we we we don't
[1:29:29] want it directly we don't want this
[1:29:31] you know though as awesome as it may be
[1:29:34] we don't want the voice of god directly
[1:29:36] like that for her life
[1:29:37] oh my brother my sister but i believe
[1:29:39] there's a people who quite the opposite
[1:29:41] of that there's an elected family of god
[1:29:44] who is saying i don't need it through a
[1:29:45] preacher i don't need it through my past
[1:29:47] through my grandfather i don't need it
[1:29:48] through my family i need to hear it
[1:29:51] for myself oh intrigued to speak to me
[1:29:55] that way lord it's like at a funeral you
[1:29:57] hear about a man
[1:29:58] who's died and you know sometimes if you
[1:30:00] never got to know the man
[1:30:01] or the individual you never never knew
[1:30:03] much about him maybe a funeral is the
[1:30:05] only time you ever learned anything
[1:30:07] about them
[1:30:07] and someone gets up at a funeral and
[1:30:09] they begin to tell you and describe to
[1:30:11] you what he was
[1:30:12] and and how great he was and the
[1:30:13] accomplishments and great man
[1:30:15] and you know you sit there and you hear
[1:30:17] of this great man and hear how great he
[1:30:19] was and all the marvelous things he'd
[1:30:21] accomplished in his life hear about all
[1:30:24] of his accomplishments
[1:30:26] you hear about what he did in his life
[1:30:28] while he lived
[1:30:29] at a funeral you get to know that man
[1:30:31] through someone else's experience
[1:30:34] they can tell you what he did they can
[1:30:36] tell you how he lived they can tell you
[1:30:38] what he
[1:30:39] thought and what he liked and what what
[1:30:41] what made him happy and the things that
[1:30:43] he loved and you hear
[1:30:44] and for church sometimes church just
[1:30:46] becomes like a funeral service
[1:30:48] or people just hear about a god and they
[1:30:50] hear what he was and they hear how they
[1:30:52] thought
[1:30:52] but i believe there's a family of god
[1:30:54] who says i don't want some
[1:30:56] history lesson i don't want some funeral
[1:30:58] service
[1:30:59] i don't just want to know what he did i
[1:31:01] want to know what's he doing right now
[1:31:05] oh can you say a man this morning i
[1:31:07] believe there's a people who can say i
[1:31:10] don't just want to hear about what he's
[1:31:11] done but what's he doing right now
[1:31:14] i can read the word of god and it can
[1:31:16] tell me what he thought but what's he
[1:31:18] thinking right now
[1:31:19] i can hear about what he said you can
[1:31:21] read the bible to me
[1:31:22] and i can hear about what the word of
[1:31:24] god said but brother man what is the
[1:31:26] voice of god
[1:31:27] saying right now
[1:31:34] i don't just want to hear about a
[1:31:35] history i believe there's a family of
[1:31:37] god who says bring him up
[1:31:39] out of history what's he doing today
[1:31:41] what is jesus christ as the same
[1:31:43] yesterday today and forever
[1:31:49] you imagine this as they heard this they
[1:31:52] they they did they didn't want to they
[1:31:53] don't want to hear the voice of god
[1:31:55] they wanted a filter now therefore
[1:31:56] should we die we consume if we hear the
[1:31:58] voice of the lord our god anymore that
[1:31:59] we shall die
[1:32:04] because there's a responsibility
[1:32:07] there's a responsibility when you hear
[1:32:09] the voice of god
[1:32:11] and people don't want the responsibility
[1:32:14] we live in a generation of people today
[1:32:16] where they don't want to hear direct
[1:32:18] from god
[1:32:19] they don't want that direct relationship
[1:32:22] they want it filtered through
[1:32:23] through prop through through through uh
[1:32:25] through through proxy
[1:32:27] brother branham cried out against this
[1:32:29] and said you want it by proxy you want
[1:32:31] it through a priest you want it through
[1:32:32] a preacher you want it through a man you
[1:32:33] want it through a prophet
[1:32:35] and god speaks through all of those
[1:32:36] voices god speaks through all of those
[1:32:38] agencies
[1:32:39] but god is saying i want to speak to you
[1:32:41] directly child
[1:32:43] i want you to hear my voice directly
[1:32:45] child
[1:32:47] how many can say lord i want to hear it
[1:32:49] i want to hear it directly
[1:32:52] i want to hear it lip to ear i want to
[1:32:54] hear it in my in my heart i want to know
[1:32:56] that i've heard from the voice of god
[1:33:00] thousands people filling up churches uh
[1:33:03] wanting
[1:33:04] you know the a new gospel a new jesus
[1:33:07] says paul spoke
[1:33:08] of another jesus that teach that the
[1:33:10] blood of jesus didn't atone
[1:33:12] for sin or that you we can only hear god
[1:33:15] through a man's voice
[1:33:17] oh listen to me but my brother my sister
[1:33:19] deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 20 says as
[1:33:21] the nations which the lord destroyeth
[1:33:24] before your face so shall you perish
[1:33:26] because you would not be obedient
[1:33:28] unto the voice of the lord your god
[1:33:33] even david heard and spoke to the lord
[1:33:36] the bible says in psalms chapter 60
[1:33:38] verse 6
[1:33:40] we've read this here david says
[1:33:43] god hath spoken in holiness
[1:33:47] i will rejoice he says in ii
[1:33:50] samuel chapter 23 verse 2
[1:33:53] the spirit of the lord spoke by
[1:33:57] me second samuel 23 verse 2
[1:34:01] he says the spirit of the lord spoke by
[1:34:04] me
[1:34:04] and his word was in my tongue
[1:34:12] the rock of israel verse 3 says the rock
[1:34:14] of israel spoke
[1:34:15] to me
[1:34:18] god still speaks
[1:34:24] hebrews chapter one verse one god now
[1:34:26] you don't have to do to turn your god
[1:34:29] has in these last days spoken unto us
[1:34:32] unto us by his son
[1:34:36] who's his son jesus
[1:34:39] he says god at sundered times in diverse
[1:34:41] manner spoke in the past unto the
[1:34:43] fathers that's good you could put that
[1:34:44] spoken in the past by uh unto the
[1:34:47] fathers by the prophets
[1:34:49] so god says there was a generation there
[1:34:51] was a day uh you know when god spoke
[1:34:53] through prophets god still speaks
[1:34:54] through prophets god still through
[1:34:56] speaks to the fivefold ministry
[1:34:57] still spoke to us by the seventh angel
[1:34:59] prophet but but the bible says but god
[1:35:02] in these last days has spoken
[1:35:04] verse 2 and he says but hath in these
[1:35:07] last days spoken
[1:35:08] unto us by his son
[1:35:12] who what was the son of man ministry
[1:35:14] revealed through a prophet
[1:35:16] it was jesus christ speaking to us
[1:35:20] through his son
[1:35:25] some some people heard uh heard a man
[1:35:27] from kentucky i heard the voice of the
[1:35:29] lord
[1:35:31] and i still heard the voice of the lord
[1:35:36] some people heard nothing more than
[1:35:38] doctrine some people heard nothing more
[1:35:40] but dress code
[1:35:41] some people just heard religion but
[1:35:43] there's an elected family who heard the
[1:35:45] voice of their beloved
[1:35:48] some have just heard it some have just
[1:35:49] turned it into nothing more than in the
[1:35:51] nomination
[1:35:52] as as just an organization that you join
[1:35:55] but
[1:35:56] others heard the voice of the living god
[1:35:58] speaking directly
[1:36:00] lipped from his voice to your heart and
[1:36:02] you
[1:36:03] speak back and you say yes lord be it
[1:36:05] unto me god
[1:36:10] god in these last days has spoken to us
[1:36:12] through his son even paul
[1:36:14] even even saul uh who was then now paul
[1:36:17] then saul
[1:36:18] on the road to damascus the bible says
[1:36:20] suddenly uh there
[1:36:21] shined around about him a life from
[1:36:22] heaven and he fell to the earth and
[1:36:24] heard a voice in him saying saul saul
[1:36:25] why persecuted thou me
[1:36:27] what was paul doing he was hearing
[1:36:29] directly the voice of god
[1:36:33] he tells king agrippa i heard a voice
[1:36:35] speaking unto me and saying in the
[1:36:36] hebrew tongue
[1:36:37] and he said rise for i have appeared
[1:36:39] unto thee for this purpose even peter
[1:36:41] hears the voice of god in acts 11
[1:36:43] verse 7 and i heard a voice saying unto
[1:36:45] me arise peter
[1:36:47] slay and eat but i said not so lord but
[1:36:49] the voice answered me again from heaven
[1:36:51] and this was done three times
[1:36:54] what do you find moses heard from god
[1:36:57] david heard from god
[1:36:58] paul heard from god peter heard from god
[1:37:02] and jesus now no john notice john in
[1:37:05] revelations 3 verse 20
[1:37:07] he says behold i stand
[1:37:11] at the door and knock
[1:37:17] and if any man hear my voice
[1:37:20] and open the door i will come in unto
[1:37:24] him and will sup with him
[1:37:26] and he with me so the voice of god
[1:37:29] speaking
[1:37:31] the voice of god's a living voice
[1:37:37] say brother matt how do i hear that
[1:37:38] voice let me say more than hearing that
[1:37:40] voice
[1:37:41] you've got to become that voice notice
[1:37:44] what brother branham says here in our
[1:37:45] powerpoint
[1:37:46] very next slide brother if you have it
[1:37:48] you could just put it up
[1:37:50] brother adam says this side of the lady
[1:37:51] seeing church age of momentary
[1:37:53] consideration of the church history
[1:37:54] will prove how accurate this thought is
[1:37:57] in the dark ages the word was almost
[1:37:59] entirely lost to the people
[1:38:01] but god sent luther with the word the
[1:38:03] lutheran spoke for god
[1:38:04] at that time but they organized and
[1:38:06] again the pure word was lost for
[1:38:08] organization tends towards dogma and
[1:38:10] creeds
[1:38:11] and not simple word they could no longer
[1:38:13] speak for god
[1:38:15] then god sent wesley and he was the
[1:38:18] voice
[1:38:20] with the word in his day
[1:38:26] right brother madam says when i the
[1:38:28] angel lord comes down he says i'm god's
[1:38:30] voice to you
[1:38:31] luther was god's voice to his generation
[1:38:34] luther became the voice of god brother
[1:38:36] branham says in the very next line he
[1:38:38] said
[1:38:40] revelation the people so it wasn't let
[1:38:43] me let me just control it here the
[1:38:44] people who took his revelation
[1:38:47] yeah it's one thing to say oh oh god
[1:38:49] spoke through luther oh praise god he
[1:38:51] spoke through the message spoke to the
[1:38:53] messenger now all we have to do is just
[1:38:54] listen to that voice of that messenger
[1:38:56] no
[1:38:58] brother branham says luther became the
[1:38:59] voice of god to his generation
[1:39:01] and the people who's the people
[1:39:06] the people who took his revelation from
[1:39:08] god became the living
[1:39:10] epistles read and known of all men in
[1:39:14] their generation
[1:39:16] when the method is failed god raised up
[1:39:18] others and so it has gone on through the
[1:39:20] years
[1:39:21] until in this last day how many believe
[1:39:24] we're in the last day
[1:39:26] there is again another people
[1:39:31] there's another people you better
[1:39:34] recognize who the prophet messenger was
[1:39:36] for your generation
[1:39:38] it's important to know who your prophet
[1:39:40] messenger was because that was god's
[1:39:42] voice to you
[1:39:43] but it's just as important it is to
[1:39:44] recognize a prophet
[1:39:46] it's better to recognize who you are in
[1:39:48] all the mystery of god
[1:39:50] brother branham says again there's a
[1:39:52] people in the land who under their
[1:39:53] messenger will be the
[1:39:55] final voice can you say amen
[1:39:59] to the final age
[1:40:02] say what's a brother brother matt what
[1:40:04] what you mean we're going to speak and
[1:40:06] it's going to be our words or we have
[1:40:07] preachers preachers speaking
[1:40:08] listen to me brother that's a shallow
[1:40:10] understanding of a voice a voice is a
[1:40:12] life
[1:40:14] a voice is a life that's lived those
[1:40:17] people who took that revelation became
[1:40:19] the written epistles read and known of
[1:40:21] all men
[1:40:21] you are the final voice to the final age
[1:40:25] in other words the manifestation in the
[1:40:27] word
[1:40:28] uh the manifestation in the bride of the
[1:40:31] word
[1:40:31] is the final interpretation to the world
[1:40:38] it's not what the messenger not you you
[1:40:39] i just got to give them a book got to
[1:40:41] give them a tape that's important
[1:40:44] but what is that book and that tape
[1:40:45] produced in you
[1:40:50] you're the final voice to the final age
[1:40:52] what is the final voice it's the final
[1:40:53] life it's the final manifestation
[1:40:56] brother branham says it this way he says
[1:40:58] god never left the world without a
[1:41:00] witness
[1:41:03] and he says a witness who will stand and
[1:41:05] testify to him
[1:41:07] but the prophet of god speaks about
[1:41:08] witnesses and he says he's always had
[1:41:10] someone
[1:41:11] in every generation in spite of all of
[1:41:14] the accusations he says there's always
[1:41:16] been a witness
[1:41:17] a person who has a life who could stand
[1:41:19] for the testimony of christ
[1:41:21] and brother branham says you're the
[1:41:22] final voice you're the final
[1:41:23] manifestation you're the final
[1:41:25] interpretation
[1:41:26] you say brother man interpretation of
[1:41:28] what you're the final
[1:41:29] interpretation of what a christian is
[1:41:33] in 2020 by your words not by your words
[1:41:37] by your life
[1:41:39] by how you conduct yourself by how you
[1:41:42] live
[1:41:45] fathers you're the final voice you're
[1:41:47] the final interpretation
[1:41:49] of what a godly father is to a child in
[1:41:52] this generation
[1:41:53] teenagers you're the final
[1:41:55] interpretation of what a holy
[1:41:57] ghost-filled teenager
[1:41:58] is but listen to me husbands and wives
[1:42:00] your marriage is the interpretation
[1:42:03] it's the fruit of the word of god in a
[1:42:05] holy
[1:42:06] matrimony a holy covenant between a man
[1:42:09] and a woman
[1:42:10] do you realize that see why people don't
[1:42:13] want the voice of god because then the
[1:42:15] onus is put on you
[1:42:17] you are the final interpretation your
[1:42:21] life your
[1:42:22] witness well they will either prove
[1:42:25] christ a liar or prove he's the same
[1:42:27] yesterday today and forever
[1:42:31] under her messenger she'll be the final
[1:42:34] voice
[1:42:37] to the final age the final life
[1:42:41] find a witness listen to what brother
[1:42:43] adam says here he says the people uh
[1:42:45] yes sir the church is no longer the
[1:42:47] mouthpiece of god it's its own
[1:42:49] mouthpiece so god the church
[1:42:51] so god is turning on her he'll confound
[1:42:53] her through the prophet
[1:42:55] and the bride for the voice of god will
[1:42:58] be
[1:42:59] in say it together her
[1:43:02] say it together her
[1:43:05] the voice of god will be in
[1:43:11] yes it is from the last chapter of
[1:43:13] revelations verse 17 the spirit
[1:43:15] and the bride say they're saying
[1:43:18] something
[1:43:19] not with their voice not with their not
[1:43:21] with their words
[1:43:22] their life their manifestation
[1:43:25] of how they live of how they dress of
[1:43:27] how they act of how they
[1:43:28] think he says that the spirit and the
[1:43:31] bride say
[1:43:32] come once more the world will hear
[1:43:35] direct from god
[1:43:36] as at pentecost and i say lord
[1:43:40] let them hear your voice let my life be
[1:43:42] a manifestation how many want that today
[1:43:45] to say lord don't don't let me get my
[1:43:47] opinions out of it let me get my
[1:43:48] thoughts out of it
[1:43:49] i'm the final manifestation on the final
[1:43:51] interpretation
[1:43:52] then lord let my life be a clear voice
[1:43:55] let it be
[1:43:56] clear let it be distinct let the world
[1:43:58] not misunderstand
[1:44:02] let them hear direct as brother adam
[1:44:04] says the voice of god
[1:44:06] is in her
[1:44:09] and god's very careful who he speaks to
[1:44:14] we sing the song shut in with god
[1:44:19] in a secret place
[1:44:23] god says i'll speak it'll be through
[1:44:25] that little secret place
[1:44:28] i want to hear the voice of god you got
[1:44:30] to be shut in with god
[1:44:32] you've got to be shut in in that secret
[1:44:34] place
[1:44:37] you say brother man who does god speak
[1:44:38] to to those who value his voice
[1:44:42] to those who put emphasis on the voice
[1:44:45] of god
[1:44:46] in their life on those who are willing
[1:44:50] to get the world out
[1:44:51] jesus says when you pray enter into your
[1:44:54] secret closet
[1:44:56] and shut the door
[1:45:00] what are you doing when you shut that
[1:45:01] door is it a literal door you shut no
[1:45:04] it's that door of your mind of all of
[1:45:07] the problems and all the cares and all
[1:45:09] the worries and brother adam says what
[1:45:10] it is it's that dimension
[1:45:12] you shut that dimension out and it's you
[1:45:14] in christ you alone
[1:45:16] with the holy spirit and the voice of
[1:45:19] god begins to speak
[1:45:21] and the spirit of the lord begins to
[1:45:23] discern your heart
[1:45:25] and you lay all your life you say lord
[1:45:27] i'm laid out right now
[1:45:28] all out before you nothing in my heart i
[1:45:31] want to hide from you jesus
[1:45:34] you get alone with god notice the voice
[1:45:38] of god came to moses
[1:45:40] when he was shut up and he was alone
[1:45:43] with god
[1:45:44] even john the baptist the bible says it
[1:45:46] came to john
[1:45:47] in the wilderness the voice of god comes
[1:45:50] to jacob
[1:45:51] in the desert of haran god spoke to
[1:45:54] speaks to joshua
[1:45:55] when he leaves the camp and he goes
[1:45:57] outside of the camp
[1:45:59] so i don't hear the voice of god maybe
[1:46:01] you haven't been alone with god long
[1:46:02] enough
[1:46:06] the voice of god comes to paul in the
[1:46:08] desert
[1:46:09] the voice of the father comes to jesus
[1:46:12] what does it say
[1:46:13] alone in the mountain when he's praying
[1:46:18] god says you want to hear my voice and
[1:46:21] hear the voice of god
[1:46:22] you've got to be willing to be shut in
[1:46:24] with god
[1:46:26] in a secret place you know what drowns
[1:46:29] out the voice of god
[1:46:31] busyness
[1:46:34] and sometimes that busyness can be
[1:46:35] religious busyness
[1:46:39] jesus says in mark 4 verse 18
[1:46:42] he says these are they which are sown
[1:46:44] among thorns such as hear the word
[1:46:47] the word mark 4 18 such as hear the word
[1:46:50] and the cares of this world and the
[1:46:52] deceitful of rich
[1:46:54] the deceitfulness of riches and the lust
[1:46:57] of
[1:46:57] other things
[1:47:01] you know why put other things because
[1:47:02] there would be some things that are
[1:47:04] unnamed but they would be
[1:47:06] other things
[1:47:09] the cares of this world the
[1:47:10] deceitfulness of riches
[1:47:12] the lust of other things entering in
[1:47:15] choke the word
[1:47:16] and it becometh unfruitful
[1:47:20] you know what that word choke means it
[1:47:22] means to drown out
[1:47:24] to crowd out it crowds out the voice we
[1:47:28] have so many things in our life that
[1:47:30] crowd out the voice of god
[1:47:32] crowd out the voice of the lord
[1:47:35] sometimes those things are not sinful
[1:47:37] things
[1:47:40] sometimes those things are not anything
[1:47:41] that's
[1:47:43] of their own merit are wrong
[1:47:46] but but jesus says this is he who hears
[1:47:48] the word of god
[1:47:50] who accepts the word of god it's sown
[1:47:53] among thorns and they hear it
[1:47:54] but the cares of this world the
[1:47:56] deceitfulness of riches and you say well
[1:47:58] i don't have the cares of this world
[1:48:00] i don't have the deceitfulness of riches
[1:48:02] and the lust of
[1:48:03] other things
[1:48:07] choke the word and it becomes unfruitful
[1:48:11] other things drown out the voice of god
[1:48:15] god's voice speaks and it's clear and
[1:48:18] and you know when the voice of the lord
[1:48:19] is speaking to you
[1:48:23] and and and he says the joy of the of
[1:48:26] the lord
[1:48:27] you know what it was to hear the voice
[1:48:29] of god and the joy of the lord
[1:48:31] fills and floods your heart oh and
[1:48:33] there's such joy and there's such
[1:48:35] rejoicing oh but but then time goes on
[1:48:39] you still love the lord you still have a
[1:48:41] heart for god but
[1:48:42] other things lust of other things are
[1:48:45] crowding out the voice of the lord
[1:48:50] they're they're what does that crowd and
[1:48:52] i do it
[1:48:53] chokes the voice of god to you
[1:48:57] and then you say i'm so dry oh i'm so
[1:48:59] dry i'm so
[1:49:00] brother man i feel so so carnal i'm just
[1:49:03] i feel so lukewarm and
[1:49:05] and i just can't explain it i can't
[1:49:07] understand it
[1:49:08] oh but what is it it's other things in
[1:49:09] your life have choked out the voice of
[1:49:11] the lord
[1:49:13] how many are here to be honest today
[1:49:17] and then that voice gets quieter and
[1:49:20] that voice grows
[1:49:21] dimmer that light grows dimmer
[1:49:24] now that voice of conviction that used
[1:49:26] to convict your heart and just
[1:49:28] immediately pierce your heart
[1:49:30] but when you when you sh when you when
[1:49:31] you crowd that voice out it becomes
[1:49:33] quieter and that voice of conviction
[1:49:35] gets quieter
[1:49:36] quieter quieter as we said jesus said
[1:49:39] behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:49:42] and he's knocking and whosoever heareth
[1:49:46] my voice
[1:49:49] but brother madam says god is only
[1:49:51] obligated to knock once and he says the
[1:49:52] the more he says he comes he says that
[1:49:54] that that voice gets quieter
[1:49:57] quieter and quieter
[1:50:00] and it chokes and drowns out
[1:50:03] the voice
[1:50:08] you say then then that justice you know
[1:50:10] we've said this before
[1:50:13] you know the world is so sinful
[1:50:16] such a dark age and it is and we just
[1:50:18] you know it's so hard brother matt why
[1:50:20] is it so hard
[1:50:21] to pray and i've said it before
[1:50:22] sometimes it's so hard
[1:50:24] to get on your knees and contact the
[1:50:26] holy spirit
[1:50:28] and maybe in another day going by it
[1:50:30] wouldn't have been as hard or take you
[1:50:31] as long but now we live with so many
[1:50:33] vices in the world
[1:50:35] so many pressures that we're facing so
[1:50:37] many so
[1:50:38] so many spirits and and brother branham
[1:50:41] describes that he says
[1:50:42] he says even that that great ring around
[1:50:45] the
[1:50:46] the the earth he says was that that
[1:50:48] barrier
[1:50:49] with all the sins going up to that
[1:50:50] barrier which was christ the blood of
[1:50:52] jesus
[1:50:53] but that darkness gets thicker and now
[1:50:56] you have to wait in prayer and you you
[1:50:58] have to push through and you have to
[1:51:00] disconnect from so much
[1:51:05] you have to disconnect from so much of
[1:51:07] the world
[1:51:08] but you know often times it's not
[1:51:10] anything in the world it's disconnecting
[1:51:12] from things we've put there
[1:51:17] we have so much less time for the lord
[1:51:21] i thought about that uh even even in
[1:51:24] in my uh you know my phone i'm notorious
[1:51:28] known that my phone's always dead and
[1:51:30] it's not because they don't charge it
[1:51:34] it's always dead i look at it you know
[1:51:36] it's always it's always
[1:51:38] the battery's always dead it's always
[1:51:39] going dead it's always
[1:51:41] one ten percent i always got red i very
[1:51:43] rarely see white it's always red i gotta
[1:51:45] charge my phone
[1:51:46] anybody ever have that problem
[1:51:50] and i thought about it you know our
[1:51:51] batteries our spiritual battery we got
[1:51:53] spiritual batteries too
[1:51:55] and oftentimes our batteries are at 10
[1:51:58] and 5
[1:51:59] and 2 and some are dead
[1:52:04] so what do you got to do you got to plug
[1:52:06] into the charger
[1:52:08] you got to plug into the charger so you
[1:52:11] know what you do what i did what you do
[1:52:12] is you go and you say i'm so sick and
[1:52:14] tired of my phone being dead
[1:52:16] and so you buy a wireless charger you
[1:52:18] put it by your bed you buy a car charger
[1:52:20] you put it in your car then you buy the
[1:52:21] little usb
[1:52:22] where you have two or three usb ports
[1:52:24] and you plug four chargers you have a
[1:52:26] charger by your
[1:52:26] nightstand you have a charger in your
[1:52:28] kitchen have a charger in your car
[1:52:30] what are you doing you're making sure
[1:52:31] that at no moment
[1:52:33] are you dead you're always charging
[1:52:35] you're always plugged in
[1:52:36] and let me say to you my brother my
[1:52:38] sister and this age that we live in
[1:52:40] you need every available charger to your
[1:52:44] spirit that you can get you need to
[1:52:46] that's why paul said have a song
[1:52:47] upon your heart upon your lips uh read
[1:52:50] your bible pray to the lord have a tape
[1:52:52] playing
[1:52:53] even if you even if you're busy have a
[1:52:55] tape plan what is it doing it's charging
[1:52:57] your batteries
[1:53:02] that's what paul says assemble
[1:53:04] yourselves more as you see
[1:53:06] a symbol you're not assembled when
[1:53:10] you're at home
[1:53:12] but you come to the symboly of god
[1:53:14] amongst the family of god
[1:53:16] and paul says assemble yourselves more
[1:53:18] so
[1:53:20] as you see that day approaching say
[1:53:22] brother matt why is it important because
[1:53:23] you need it
[1:53:25] you need it your soul needs it
[1:53:30] why turn on that tape because your soul
[1:53:32] needs it
[1:53:33] your children needs it your family needs
[1:53:35] it your mind
[1:53:37] needs it i need it
[1:53:41] you know what i found though you know
[1:53:44] what i found
[1:53:45] i found that no matter how many chargers
[1:53:47] i had i still my phone was still dead
[1:53:51] say why brother matt because it's one
[1:53:54] thing to have a charger
[1:53:56] laying before you but you got to plug
[1:53:59] into that charger
[1:54:01] you got to have a connection to that
[1:54:03] charger
[1:54:04] and you can lay all the message books
[1:54:07] have the tape play and have the bible
[1:54:08] here
[1:54:09] put it all around you but if you're not
[1:54:10] tuning in and tuning out of the world
[1:54:13] and plugging into the world
[1:54:14] i say lord let me not just have a let me
[1:54:17] not just come to church and hear a
[1:54:18] sermon
[1:54:19] and sit through 60 minutes and through
[1:54:20] songs but how many could say lord let me
[1:54:22] disconnect
[1:54:24] from the world and let me connect to
[1:54:26] that dimension let me connect
[1:54:28] let it charge my battery
[1:54:32] i know it's so simple oh but it's so
[1:54:35] relevant it's so
[1:54:36] true you've got to connect unless you're
[1:54:38] connecting
[1:54:39] you're not getting a charge
[1:54:44] and god's speaking you know what god
[1:54:46] speaking god's speaking something fresh
[1:54:49] every day as many times i've missed that
[1:54:53] fresh word of the lord because of other
[1:54:54] things in my life
[1:54:56] but god's speaking something fresh every
[1:54:58] day the spirit and the bride say come
[1:55:00] the bible says this he that hath an ear
[1:55:03] let him hear what the spirit
[1:55:05] is saying not what the spirit has just
[1:55:09] said but what he's
[1:55:10] saying to the churches
[1:55:14] you got to be sensitive to the holy
[1:55:15] spirit because god's
[1:55:17] saying something to his family
[1:55:20] even if you're not listening god is
[1:55:23] speaking
[1:55:30] hebrews it says today if we will hear
[1:55:31] his voice hebrews 3 7.
[1:55:33] today hebrews 3 verse 7 if you will hear
[1:55:37] his voice today if you will hear his
[1:55:41] voice
[1:55:42] verse 8 hearted not your hearts
[1:55:47] if you will hear his voice hearten not
[1:55:50] your
[1:55:51] hearts let me tell you what god's voice
[1:55:53] is
[1:55:54] god's voice is a today voice
[1:55:58] it's speaking today it spoke yesterday
[1:56:02] it's going to speak tomorrow
[1:56:04] but it's speaking today it's speaking
[1:56:06] right now
[1:56:08] god's saying it's a today voice so don't
[1:56:10] harden your heart
[1:56:11] it's an up to the minute it's it's the
[1:56:14] very second there's
[1:56:15] something groundbreaking the lord's
[1:56:17] saying to his children
[1:56:21] but mark chapter four verse six and it
[1:56:23] says these are they likewise which
[1:56:26] are sown on stony ground this is the
[1:56:28] voice of god
[1:56:29] mark chapter 4 verse 16.
[1:56:32] these are they likewise which are sown
[1:56:35] on stony ground
[1:56:38] who when they hear when they heard the
[1:56:42] word immediately
[1:56:45] receive it with gladness and have no
[1:56:49] root in themselves
[1:56:51] and so endure but for a time afterward
[1:56:53] when affliction or persecution ariseth
[1:56:55] for the words
[1:56:56] sake immediately they're offended
[1:57:00] they love to hear the word with gladness
[1:57:03] with joy
[1:57:05] but the bible says here's the problem
[1:57:06] the word never sinks
[1:57:08] in the seed never takes root
[1:57:13] are you here today you know why because
[1:57:17] god's voice is there for a purpose
[1:57:19] it's there to take root in your life and
[1:57:21] it's there to
[1:57:22] change you it's there to change you
[1:57:27] oh can i just preach to you today it's
[1:57:30] there to change your heart
[1:57:33] it's there to change your spirit day by
[1:57:35] day by day by day
[1:57:37] glory unto glory the the the body of
[1:57:40] christ should be
[1:57:41] changing coming into the image of this
[1:57:43] of his son paul says i know not what we
[1:57:45] shall be when he appears
[1:57:46] here's what i know we shall be in his
[1:57:48] very image in his likeness
[1:57:50] so in order to do that you've got to be
[1:57:52] changing every day
[1:57:54] oh but paul says that there will be a
[1:57:56] change one day
[1:57:58] brother adam said suddenly you feel a
[1:57:59] sweep come over your body
[1:58:01] and he says and your entire elements all
[1:58:03] of your elements were changed from
[1:58:05] old to young from unhealthy
[1:58:08] to healthy from depressed to joy
[1:58:12] from anxiety to comfort into spirit and
[1:58:15] love and happiness
[1:58:16] paul says for this mortal shall put on
[1:58:19] immortality
[1:58:20] and this corruptible will put on
[1:58:21] incorruption we
[1:58:23] shall be changed
[1:58:26] how many say lord i want to be changed i
[1:58:29] want to be changed to see you all raise
[1:58:30] your hands but do you know
[1:58:32] the fact that your body will change is
[1:58:35] that you're changing right
[1:58:36] now under the preaching of the word
[1:58:41] the body change won't be some massive
[1:58:43] step you take it'll just be the next
[1:58:45] step in your journey
[1:58:48] you're serving god you're walking with
[1:58:49] the lord what will that body change be
[1:58:52] the bible says enoch uh uh uh served god
[1:58:55] and he was not for he had this testimony
[1:58:57] he pleased god
[1:58:59] it's a daily walk
[1:59:08] he says with glory joy and gladness the
[1:59:10] word doesn't sink in
[1:59:13] because why what why why doesn't the
[1:59:16] word
[1:59:17] that's preached why does the word
[1:59:19] preached
[1:59:20] change one and it doesn't change another
[1:59:23] why does the rain fall
[1:59:24] here on this person and even in the
[1:59:26] church you can have one person receiving
[1:59:28] the voice of god receiving the word from
[1:59:29] the lord rejoicing and another person to
[1:59:31] sit there
[1:59:33] unmoved unchanged
[1:59:38] jesus gave us the answer because this is
[1:59:40] the word which falls upon
[1:59:42] stony ground
[1:59:46] stony ground sadly today when we look at
[1:59:51] this
[1:59:51] here he says this is they which receives
[1:59:54] the word but because of
[1:59:56] state falls upon stony ground where are
[1:59:59] stony hearts in in the bar st on the bar
[2:00:03] stool
[2:00:04] out there on the street in drugs and
[2:00:06] alcohol no no no
[2:00:09] no sadly the hardest hearts can be found
[2:00:12] in church in god's house
[2:00:17] among those who don't even realize their
[2:00:20] heart
[2:00:21] has became hardened
[2:00:26] christians believers develop
[2:00:29] hard hearts
[2:00:32] that's why we read the scripture the
[2:00:33] voice of god speaks
[2:00:35] heart and not your heart because a heart
[2:00:38] heart can't hear the voice
[2:00:40] of god but god's speaking god's speaking
[2:00:44] and when you refuse that voice when you
[2:00:47] refuse him that speaketh
[2:00:49] that's why paul says refuse not him that
[2:00:51] speaketh
[2:00:53] don't refuse it
[2:00:56] because your heart becomes hard when you
[2:00:58] refuse the voice of god
[2:01:00] and that voice can speak through
[2:01:02] anything and many times we confuse it
[2:01:06] brother branham speaks about this and
[2:01:07] recognizing your day and its message he
[2:01:09] says oh if america could only recognize
[2:01:11] the constitution she's brought up
[2:01:13] she wouldn't be willing to take bibles
[2:01:14] out of the schools take the name of god
[2:01:16] off coins pledge allegiance under god
[2:01:17] but she doesn't recognize it why she's
[2:01:19] blind naked she can't recognize
[2:01:21] the blood of those things and he begins
[2:01:22] to speak of of of moses
[2:01:25] and he says he recognized his day in his
[2:01:27] calling
[2:01:28] when he saw the promises god of god's
[2:01:30] word for that day vindicated he knew
[2:01:32] then
[2:01:32] he realized what he was and what he was
[2:01:34] going to do by the promised word so he
[2:01:36] didn't fear what anybody
[2:01:37] said he wasn't ashamed of his message
[2:01:40] for every priest and every prayer
[2:01:41] everything every authority disagreed
[2:01:43] with him but he recognized when he saw
[2:01:45] that light
[2:01:46] the pillar of fire hanging in that bush
[2:01:48] that spoke to him
[2:01:49] the word that was promised for that day
[2:01:51] and said i've called you to go do it
[2:01:53] he feared not the greatest threats of
[2:01:55] the king he went down to bring those
[2:01:57] people to an exodus like the word of god
[2:01:59] had promised seeing
[2:02:00] the promise vindicated he made the
[2:02:03] people ready for their exodus
[2:02:04] when when he saw the promise when he
[2:02:08] what was it moses heard the voice of god
[2:02:12] he speaks of job and he says even job he
[2:02:14] says misunderstood
[2:02:16] his trials and he began to misunderstand
[2:02:18] why am i going through what i'm going
[2:02:20] through what job didn't see is that
[2:02:21] wasn't trials it wasn't
[2:02:22] wasn't it was it wasn't an attack from
[2:02:24] the it wasn't an attack from god
[2:02:26] it was the voice of god trying to say
[2:02:30] something
[2:02:32] and many times we have we we the voice
[2:02:35] of god's speaking to us but we don't
[2:02:36] recognize his voice
[2:02:39] we don't recognize the voice of god and
[2:02:42] sometimes he speaks through a trial and
[2:02:43] you say why is this happening in my life
[2:02:45] oh it's just the devil oh it's just
[2:02:47] sometimes it's not sometimes it is
[2:02:49] sometimes it's god trying to speak
[2:02:51] god uses the voice of storms sometimes
[2:02:55] sometimes god uses calamity in our life
[2:02:57] sometimes a lost
[2:02:58] job lost wages sometimes a health issue
[2:03:03] and what is it it's the voice of god
[2:03:06] trying to speak
[2:03:09] then paul says refuse not him that
[2:03:12] speaketh
[2:03:15] don't refuse it don't misunderstand it
[2:03:18] because it's not the voice it's not a
[2:03:20] it's not a
[2:03:21] it's not for your destruction that voice
[2:03:24] of god speaking to try to get your
[2:03:26] attention
[2:03:27] can you say amen this morning going to
[2:03:29] close i'm going to close here 11 30.
[2:03:32] musicians could you come don't want to
[2:03:35] be lengthy
[2:03:39] they fall upon stony ground
[2:03:42] and even the preaching of the word of
[2:03:44] god even the voice of god
[2:03:46] through the ministering of the word
[2:03:48] sometimes people's hearts get cold
[2:03:51] get hard
[2:03:54] the word doesn't sink in
[2:04:00] and every day god's calling even through
[2:04:03] prayer
[2:04:04] could play something softly even through
[2:04:07] prayer the voice of god is speaking and
[2:04:08] calling
[2:04:12] and is and and i thought about this even
[2:04:14] in your prayer closet
[2:04:17] god wants to speak to you wants to talk
[2:04:19] to you
[2:04:22] sometimes wants to point a finger and
[2:04:23] say hey hey you know that thing right
[2:04:26] there
[2:04:26] in your life yeah yeah that that thing
[2:04:30] it's causing that it's put something
[2:04:32] between us
[2:04:34] and the voice of the lord speaking god's
[2:04:36] saying you got to deal with that
[2:04:39] you got to make that right you got to
[2:04:42] change
[2:04:42] that god's calling out he he says in
[2:04:45] jeremiah chapter 7 verse 13
[2:04:48] i spake unto you rising up
[2:04:52] early and speaking but you heard not
[2:04:55] and i called you but you answered not
[2:05:01] i spoke unto you rising up early and
[2:05:03] speaking
[2:05:04] but you heard not i i called to you
[2:05:07] but you answered not i thought of that
[2:05:10] and thought lord
[2:05:11] how many times has your voice been
[2:05:12] trying to speak to my life
[2:05:14] and you rosa in the early in the morning
[2:05:16] god was speaking maybe it wasn't through
[2:05:18] maybe you didn't hear an audible voice
[2:05:21] but it was speaking through a problem
[2:05:22] speaking through a trial speaking
[2:05:24] through an issue speaking through
[2:05:25] something that happens in your life
[2:05:26] and we miss it we wreck it we don't even
[2:05:28] recognize this goes right over us
[2:05:30] and god says i spoke and you didn't hear
[2:05:33] i called
[2:05:34] you didn't listen you're so busy
[2:05:39] you're so busy bow your heads with me
[2:05:41] stand to your feet go ahead and stand
[2:05:43] by your heads there every head bowed
[2:05:45] every eye closed
[2:05:48] i spoke
[2:05:51] every head bowed every eye closed
[2:05:57] but you had your own interest your own
[2:05:59] on things you were doing your
[2:06:01] life that you were allowing but what it
[2:06:04] was
[2:06:04] what was it doing it was choking the
[2:06:06] word
[2:06:07] it's choking the word
[2:06:14] and that word becomes unfruitful
[2:06:20] [Music]
[2:06:22] how many can say today
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:26] lord i want to hear your voice
[2:06:29] and when i hear that voice lord i i
[2:06:32] don't want to refuse it
[2:06:33] [Music]
[2:06:35] i don't want to allow other things in
[2:06:38] life to
[2:06:39] choke out that word
[2:06:42] that word that's trying to speak that
