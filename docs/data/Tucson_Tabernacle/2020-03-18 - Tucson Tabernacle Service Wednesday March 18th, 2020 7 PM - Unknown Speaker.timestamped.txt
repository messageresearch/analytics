[46:57] [Applause]
[46:59] [Music]
[47:09] in this hole
[47:13] [Music]
[47:36] we were saying
[47:38] [Music]
[48:55] leaning on the everlasting arms what if
[48:59] I turned red or have I to fear
[49:05] [Music]
[49:36] thank you

[50:10] day to day
[50:16] [Music]
[51:29] [Applause]
[51:30] [Music]
[51:34] if I could just read a little passage of
[51:38] Scripture there was an encouragement to
[51:40] me its Amos 5 verses 1 to 4 I read it
[51:46] just before I came out and it was an
[51:47] encouragement to me maybe it'll be an
[51:50] encouragement to you it says here ye
[51:53] this word which I take up against you
[51:55] even a lamentation a house of Israel the
[51:59] Virgin of Israel has fallen
[52:01] she shall no more rise she's forsaken
[52:04] upon her land there is none to raise her
[52:06] up for thus saith the Lord God the city
[52:09] that went out by a thousand to leave by
[52:12] a hundred and that which went forth by
[52:14] hundreds to leave by ten to the house of
[52:16] Israel it doesn't sound like much of an
[52:18] encouragement there
[52:20] sounds pretty bleak but this verse for
[52:22] jumped out to me he said for thus saith
[52:25] the Lord unto the house of Israel
[52:27] Shiki me and ye shall live that's a
[52:31] pretty plain promise there's many people
[52:34] that will survive these days of this
[52:36] panic but they don't know true life
[52:39] that's in Christ
[52:40] but if we'll just seek him well we'll
[52:43] have life and life eternal so it was
[52:46] real blessing to me let's sing greater
[52:51] is He that is in me
[52:53] [Music]
[53:07] me
[53:10] [Music]

[1:00:38] [Music]
[1:00:42] amen Oh for grace to trust him
[1:00:45] we got a prayer request sent him
[1:00:50] so we'll mention a couple here
[1:00:56] Rebecca Fett Kevlar and for those of us
[1:01:01] have known her for some time she was
[1:01:02] Rebecca Joukowsky Cherie arrested for
[1:01:07] the boyfriend prayer for the boyfriend
[1:01:08] of her sister-in-law whose name is Chris
[1:01:11] Chris fell off a ladder 12 foot ladder
[1:01:15] and had skull fracture in two parts
[1:01:17] below both clavicles are broken in
[1:01:20] he has seized several times after the
[1:01:23] fall he's been in ICU on a ventilator
[1:01:25] and sedated and cat that's her
[1:01:30] sister-in-law told a Sunday afternoon
[1:01:31] that the accident they were planning to
[1:01:33] get married they were going to elope and
[1:01:36] then they are now closing down all
[1:01:39] visitors visiting hours do that due to
[1:01:41] the kovat so she'd been she had to leave
[1:01:44] this morning and won't be able to see
[1:01:46] him for at least two weeks she'll be
[1:01:49] able to check in with the nurses but
[1:01:52] that's it so she was requesting that we
[1:01:55] would remember that and also yesterday
[1:01:59] when my daughter Sarah came home after
[1:02:01] dialysis
[1:02:03] she was a little alarmed or a little
[1:02:07] apprehensive as is that not all the
[1:02:10] folks that are normally there going
[1:02:12] through treatment were not there so made
[1:02:15] her worried that that maybe this was
[1:02:18] affecting the possibility of treatment
[1:02:20] for some of those who desperately need
[1:02:23] it so she asked me she said tomorrow can
[1:02:26] you have the church pray about those
[1:02:28] that are going through treatments or a
[1:02:30] shut-ins
[1:02:31] she's specifically men at her meant
[1:02:34] herself sister Maryanne Salmeron Oh our
[1:02:39] sister Kelly Batman and I'm sure there
[1:02:41] are others and things like that so she
[1:02:45] requested prayer and then she went home
[1:02:49] and just a little bit after that she
[1:02:52] sent me a text and it had a quote of the
[1:02:55] prayer of the message she started
[1:02:57] listening to so I asked where the Jeremy
[1:03:00] if he could put it up as brother Brandon
[1:03:04] was preparing any prayed and he said we
[1:03:08] would pray for each and every individual
[1:03:10] and especially for those who are shut-in
[1:03:12] and cannot get to the services anywhere
[1:03:15] today go and be with them
[1:03:16] and may this Easter find a riddle easter
[1:03:19] for them erasing from the bed and a new
[1:03:22] health that they have never known before
[1:03:23] in life Granite Lord so it just it just
[1:03:27] encouraged her heart in those
[1:03:31] those are here and maybe even those at
[1:03:33] home would like to stand right now as
[1:03:36] will bow our heads and we'll believe
[1:03:40] we'll take God at His Word as we pray
[1:03:43] and if there is a request or a need
[1:03:46] those that are watching and listening
[1:03:48] and just believe it as we take it before
[1:03:51] the Lord as we we come to you Lord is
[1:03:54] you knowing all things there's nothing
[1:03:57] father that it would catch you by
[1:03:58] surprise and Lord we know through
[1:04:02] reading in the scriptures and and
[1:04:04] through the testimonies and our own
[1:04:06] experiences you're you're a healer Lord
[1:04:09] you heal all our diseases all our
[1:04:11] infirmities you're your God that has an
[1:04:14] answer to all the questions or there is
[1:04:16] nothing impossible for you just ask us
[1:04:19] to to ask and believe Lord so we're
[1:04:21] asking Lord for this this man named
[1:04:24] Chris Lord in the family that's involved
[1:04:27] in his fall Lord that in all this they
[1:04:30] would turn to you and look to you Lord
[1:04:32] and as as you would meet with him Lord
[1:04:34] it would just change our hearts towards
[1:04:36] you Lord and my daughter Sarah asking
[1:04:38] for those that there are in her in the
[1:04:41] same treatment and our sisters that are
[1:04:43] going through treatment and all these
[1:04:44] things Lord but your prophet had prayed
[1:04:47] this prayer Lord and we pray the same
[1:04:50] prayer Lord be merciful and each one
[1:04:52] Lord listening in and hearing it has a
[1:04:54] need Lord that you would go to them now
[1:04:57] Lord and may they believe and accept and
[1:04:59] confess what
[1:05:01] I mean of today Lord we thank you for it
[1:05:04] Norton now as we prepared to Minister
[1:05:07] the Word of God today we just ask you to
[1:05:09] have preeminence Lord letters let us kid
[1:05:12] ourselves a sign and let something be
[1:05:15] said Lord through the inspiration that
[1:05:16] you've placed in my heart Lord to share
[1:05:19] Lord that you're the same yesterday
[1:05:21] today and forever and there is no fear
[1:05:23] Lord we have that confidence even the
[1:05:25] songs that brother Peter was was singing
[1:05:28] with the congregation Lord how we have
[1:05:31] someone we can trust and we can lean on
[1:05:33] Lord and we can look up for a Redemption
[1:05:35] draweth nigh
[1:05:36] we ask it in Jesus Christ amen so be it
[1:05:42] appreciate the goodness of the Lord in
[1:05:45] His grace let's read that first
[1:05:48] Scripture brother Jeremy and proverbs
[1:05:51] chapter 12 verse 25 I was looking
[1:06:00] through and just looking for scriptures
[1:06:02] on this along this line and it says
[1:06:06] heaviness in the heart of man maketh it
[1:06:09] stoop but a good word make you fit glad
[1:06:12] and I I looked at another translation it
[1:06:17] says anxiety anxiety in a man's heart
[1:06:20] weighs it down but a good word maketh it
[1:06:23] glad
[1:06:24] so we have the good word of the Lord
[1:06:26] today so that's good you may be seated
[1:06:29] so those that are listening in or being
[1:06:32] streamed in God bless you and you be
[1:06:36] praying and you be pulling and you'll be
[1:06:38] asking God to speak also to what your
[1:06:41] need is and where you're at and that the
[1:06:44] Lord would speak to us and brother
[1:06:46] Branham says in a message God provided a
[1:06:50] way of healing and it was I read this
[1:06:55] the other day and I had some things this
[1:06:58] thought on my heart as to look at some
[1:07:02] of these scriptures and seeing some of
[1:07:03] the promises that God has given us and I
[1:07:06] was listening to a portion of brother
[1:07:09] Branham was was ministering and it was
[1:07:11] from the message God's provided way of
[1:07:13] healing
[1:07:15] he says let me pass something here
[1:07:17] quickly as our time is going listen he
[1:07:21] says did you know that the Bible
[1:07:22] predicts that in the last days that
[1:07:25] there'll be a germ warfare that diseases
[1:07:28] will break out upon the people and will
[1:07:30] fall on everyone without the baptism of
[1:07:33] the Holy Spirit but the angel or who had
[1:07:36] charged over these plagues was given
[1:07:38] orders to touch no one on whom the mark
[1:07:41] was why how much kind of teachers have
[1:07:45] we got to be brethren to get the church
[1:07:47] in order to be in that condition immune
[1:07:51] my arms are sore now from where the
[1:07:54] doctors has punched needles in to try to
[1:07:56] inoculate me from yellow fever and so
[1:07:58] forth I told them I didn't need it but
[1:08:01] they wouldn't listen to me but I'll tell
[1:08:03] you what God's going to do God's got a
[1:08:06] serum and it's called the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:08] when that serum goes in it will
[1:08:11] inoculate inoculate you and he says
[1:08:14] hallelujah and I know without a doubt we
[1:08:19] have the Holy Spirit so we have that
[1:08:21] serum we have that in us and so as I was
[1:08:25] looking at this and and and looking at
[1:08:27] some of the scriptures brother Branham
[1:08:30] says in the message principles the
[1:08:32] principles of divine healing and I found
[1:08:36] a few places where he makes a statement
[1:08:38] in different times he says now listen
[1:08:41] just a moment the Word of God will
[1:08:44] defeat the devil any place anywhere
[1:08:47] anytime on any condition when Jesus was
[1:08:51] here on earth the father was in him God
[1:08:53] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:08:55] himself we believe that all the fine
[1:08:59] qualities was was of the father was in
[1:09:01] him but when he met Satan look how he
[1:09:04] did it he brought it in your reach and
[1:09:07] yours yours and all of you see he never
[1:09:11] used his great gift and he says he went
[1:09:16] to the Word of God and said it is
[1:09:18] written
[1:09:20] so we can take the Word of God because
[1:09:24] it has been written it hasn't been given
[1:09:26] to us in second Timothy chapter 1 verse
[1:09:31] 7 and it says for God hath not given us
[1:09:38] the spirit of fear but of power and of
[1:09:42] love and of a sound mind not the spirit
[1:09:46] of fear and today as we see what's going
[1:09:49] on
[1:09:50] today in in the in the condition and
[1:09:53] every day if you're looking at the news
[1:09:55] or you opening up there's an update
[1:09:57] after an update there they're talking
[1:10:00] about the CDC the center of Disease
[1:10:02] Control and who the World Health
[1:10:05] Organization their recommendations what
[1:10:08] we should do what's coming up and you
[1:10:11] know you can hear from from doctors with
[1:10:13] great reputations and others who think
[1:10:15] they know as I was driving in this this
[1:10:18] afternoon there's evening coming into
[1:10:20] church and I was thinking Lord how
[1:10:25] should this come along I you know how
[1:10:27] should I not just read the scriptures in
[1:10:29] quote but what is it
[1:10:30] and I just began I looked out as I got
[1:10:32] onto the freeway and there's a rainbow
[1:10:34] down that I said well first of all God
[1:10:37] is mindful of us we can look at there
[1:10:39] was a rainbow there and everybody else
[1:10:42] going down the road I don't know if they
[1:10:44] looked at it
[1:10:44] but I did and it meant something to me I
[1:10:46] said father you're alright you're aware
[1:10:49] of these things and I began to think of
[1:10:51] that in the CDC and the WHO and I said
[1:10:53] but you know and let me just share this
[1:10:56] with you I got a chance today to talk to
[1:10:58] a specialist and and this specialist is
[1:11:03] he's not one could I say it's proud or
[1:11:08] boast on himself in any way that is not
[1:11:13] true in fact he can boast on himself
[1:11:17] because his words are true they've never
[1:11:20] failed and he's a specialist of
[1:11:23] specialists he he understands the
[1:11:26] simplest infirmities what we would say
[1:11:29] oh it's just a call door
[1:11:31] just a cut is just an abrasion or
[1:11:33] something like that to what
[1:11:35] stumps the doctors today and you know it
[1:11:39] was actually an opportunity to talk to
[1:11:41] him today and and was kind of nice cuz
[1:11:44] he knows me by name - and I know him by
[1:11:47] name - we happen to be very good friends
[1:11:49] in fact he told me he loves me he told
[1:11:52] me he cares for me
[1:11:53] in fact my condition and my well-being
[1:11:57] is in his personal care and brother
[1:12:01] branham called it blessed assurance not
[1:12:04] necessarily insurance but he called it
[1:12:06] blessed assurance I have this blessed
[1:12:09] assurance blessed assurance Jesus is
[1:12:12] mine so in talking to him and I was
[1:12:15] telling this to brother Peter a little
[1:12:16] bit I was saying Lord I don't know how
[1:12:18] to start this and how to how'd it go but
[1:12:22] this is just what he started telling me
[1:12:23] says you can talk to me you can ask me I
[1:12:26] can share with you I can you know and
[1:12:29] the opportunity to speak to the
[1:12:32] physician of physicians to the counselor
[1:12:34] of counselors to the Prince of Peace and
[1:12:37] actually have him sit there with you and
[1:12:40] he says hey it's not just a 15
[1:12:43] appointment minute appointment it's for
[1:12:44] eternity in this where we're in this
[1:12:47] together if we could say that so it was
[1:12:50] a comfort to me that just to know that
[1:12:52] we can talk to him and David said in
[1:12:54] Psalms 23 verse 4 David says and these
[1:12:59] are scriptures we all know yea though I
[1:13:02] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:13:05] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[1:13:08] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[1:13:11] comfort me and you know there's times we
[1:13:14] have to walk should we call it through
[1:13:16] this through the valley of the shadows
[1:13:18] through the valley of questioning and
[1:13:20] and sometimes that walk is right here in
[1:13:23] our own mind we're concerned we're
[1:13:26] wondering you know they're saying that
[1:13:28] this is really affecting the elderly and
[1:13:31] there was a time when I would look oh
[1:13:33] that's those people down there but now
[1:13:36] I'm having to look in the mirror a
[1:13:38] little bit say oh that's me too
[1:13:40] but you know he said though I walk in
[1:13:42] the valley of shadow of death I don't
[1:13:44] have to fear I don't have to be afraid
[1:13:48] you guide my steps you show me thy word
[1:13:51] is a lamp unto my feet and it shows me
[1:13:55] the way to walk so brother Branham says
[1:13:59] in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:14:02] and forever he said it is written man
[1:14:06] shall not live by bread alone so then a
[1:14:10] Satan always tries to coat the word went
[1:14:14] back and told him when he put him on the
[1:14:16] pinnacle of the temple and setting and
[1:14:18] he said it is written and he defeated
[1:14:21] Satan on the Word of God that shows that
[1:14:24] you can defeat Satan on the word of God
[1:14:27] no matter the Word of God will defeat
[1:14:30] Satan any place anywhere under any
[1:14:33] condition if it's in the belly of a
[1:14:36] whale or if it's in the lion's den or
[1:14:39] it's on the bed with a cancer or slain
[1:14:41] under yonder bleeding to death in an
[1:14:44] automobile accident the Word of God will
[1:14:46] defeat Satan anywhere and the weakest
[1:14:49] Christian can use it it's your god-given
[1:14:53] privilege to do it amen so just looking
[1:14:57] at David said I'm walking through this
[1:14:59] valley but I don't have to fear God has
[1:15:02] been there we know this footprints in
[1:15:05] the sands of time and we look at it and
[1:15:07] we the story that's written with it and
[1:15:10] it says God where were you I only see
[1:15:12] one set of footprints at this time and
[1:15:15] God tells them they were mine I was
[1:15:18] carrying you through that that time and
[1:15:20] sometimes when we feel all alone he says
[1:15:22] I will fear no evil thy rod and thy
[1:15:25] staff they comfort me
[1:15:26] you know just sometimes someone coming
[1:15:30] by putting their arm around you or maybe
[1:15:31] if if you raise some children and you're
[1:15:34] going and you just reach with a hand and
[1:15:36] you help them along and they look back
[1:15:38] and the smile on their face and their
[1:15:40] comfort of like mom and dad here with me
[1:15:42] I don't have to be afraid it's the same
[1:15:45] thing with the Lord he reaches down and
[1:15:47] lets us know he
[1:15:48] with us Psalms 27:1 the Lord is my light
[1:15:55] and my salvation whom shall I fear the
[1:15:59] Lord is the strength of my life of whom
[1:16:01] shall I be afraid and and sometimes we
[1:16:05] take whom and we might put that well of
[1:16:07] this person of whatever situation of
[1:16:09] whatever comes against us
[1:16:12] I don't have to fear you're gonna die I
[1:16:14] saw something written that somebody
[1:16:16] wrote and they posted it and and they
[1:16:19] were talking as as in in a way where
[1:16:23] they're saying watching the people today
[1:16:24] how they're reacting and in everybody
[1:16:27] trying to go and find all the supplies
[1:16:29] and and stalk them and get ready and
[1:16:31] they said I kind of laughed because
[1:16:35] you're living going through what I lived
[1:16:38] through every day because I am a person
[1:16:40] filled with the anxiety this is how I
[1:16:43] live my life daily
[1:16:45] I am always anxious I'm always nervous
[1:16:49] I'm always afraid and I'm seeing you act
[1:16:53] that way today and I it made me stop and
[1:16:56] I said Oh for the peace of God and and
[1:17:00] that comfort we get out of God's Word
[1:17:03] when he says I'll never leave you I'll
[1:17:05] never forsake you I'll be in you with
[1:17:08] you to the end of the world he says of
[1:17:10] whom of what shall I be afraid
[1:17:13] yeah and then in Psalms 34 for Davis
[1:17:17] says again I sought the Lord and he
[1:17:19] heard me and he delivered me from all my
[1:17:24] fears an anxious moment may come your
[1:17:28] way but as soon as you can get a hold of
[1:17:31] yourself I don't have to fear I don't
[1:17:34] have to be afraid he has delivered me
[1:17:37] from all my fears again in putting the
[1:17:41] whole armor of God brother Branham says
[1:17:45] we see you Lord we know we're at the end
[1:17:49] time and the people need strength
[1:17:52] Satan is charging at then
[1:17:54] and I'm putting the Word of God in their
[1:17:57] hands right now in their hearts we
[1:18:00] defeat Satan with this word come out of
[1:18:04] these people in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:18:06] look at their hands look at their faith
[1:18:09] God look at their hands look at their
[1:18:11] faith God Satan you're defeated leave
[1:18:14] them in Jesus name come out had cheer
[1:18:17] you by the Living God and you know
[1:18:21] there's so many of us today and and I
[1:18:24] say yes because I include myself
[1:18:26] well that was brother branham he had
[1:18:28] such faith but brother Branham said the
[1:18:31] weakest Saint on their knees causes
[1:18:34] Satan to tremble and there sometimes we
[1:18:38] argue who the weakest saint is because
[1:18:39] we're all trying to be the weakest saint
[1:18:41] that's me but it doesn't matter if you
[1:18:44] war or not second weakest third weakest
[1:18:47] we all can put him to a running David
[1:18:50] said that he says I sought the Lord and
[1:18:52] he heard me and he delivered me from all
[1:18:55] my fears there is nothing to to be it
[1:19:00] and you know fear is a strong spirit
[1:19:01] it's a very strong spirit those of you
[1:19:05] that maybe have have had to have that
[1:19:07] experience or have gone through
[1:19:09] something where you've been gripped by
[1:19:10] fear it can in mobilize somebody
[1:19:13] literally where they can't move they
[1:19:15] can't they react them you might have
[1:19:17] seen a video or something where somebody
[1:19:19] got scared and they're just there
[1:19:21] motionless frozen and then you see
[1:19:25] others who are the the scare is not even
[1:19:29] done and they're a mile down the road
[1:19:31] already
[1:19:31] running hard and and you've probably
[1:19:34] seen them when they prank somebody and
[1:19:37] do that they do it for laughs well the
[1:19:39] person they got pranked isn't laughing
[1:19:41] that's the person cause them right and
[1:19:43] sometimes Satan will come by that way
[1:19:46] and try to do because all it is is a
[1:19:47] prank he doesn't have power over you
[1:19:50] he doesn't have authority over you
[1:19:52] that's God's place and all he is doing
[1:19:55] too is trying just to pull something on
[1:19:57] you and wants you to get you to freeze
[1:20:00] or run off in another direction but if
[1:20:02] you can stand on the Word of God stand
[1:20:05] your ground
[1:20:05] and say no to it a simple thing that
[1:20:08] that granddaddy works in his dream when
[1:20:13] he he says he's Satan comes at him and
[1:20:16] begins to to boo at him and he saw
[1:20:19] himself shrinking and shrinking and
[1:20:20] shrinking and getting smaller and
[1:20:22] smaller and he finally said to himself
[1:20:24] if I hear one more boo I'm going to
[1:20:27] disappear
[1:20:28] so he said boo back and sometimes that
[1:20:32] first boo is just a little boo boo and
[1:20:35] he noticed it had a reaction
[1:20:38] so he said boo a little bit more and
[1:20:40] then boo a little bit more and then bill
[1:20:41] a little bit more and then just watch
[1:20:43] Satan shrink down to nothing and we can
[1:20:46] do the same thing it was a lesson God
[1:20:48] was showing him and that lesson can be I
[1:20:50] stand on God's Word Satan you're a liar
[1:20:53] God's Word I'm not standing my own
[1:20:56] ability I'm not standing because I'm the
[1:20:59] overcomer I'm standing here because the
[1:21:01] overcomers in me and his word is in me
[1:21:03] and God's Word defeat Satan anywhere
[1:21:06] anytime anyplace in any condition so we
[1:21:09] got to stand on that David says in
[1:21:12] Psalms fifty-six three and four what
[1:21:18] time I am afraid I will trust in thee if
[1:21:21] you go through through the Book of
[1:21:23] Psalms you see David on one side I can I
[1:21:27] can run through a troop and leap over a
[1:21:30] wall and on another side where he's
[1:21:33] saying at what time I am afraid I will
[1:21:35] trust in thee because I have found you
[1:21:38] have never failed me you've never left
[1:21:40] me you know he stood before Goliath and
[1:21:44] and had he not had the bear in the lion
[1:21:48] he would have wondered about Goliath but
[1:21:51] he said the same God that delivered that
[1:21:54] beer in my hands and delivered that it
[1:21:56] was going to take you down today he
[1:21:58] didn't say hey I'm so strong now I can
[1:22:00] tell you he said that same God that did
[1:22:02] that is now taking you down it's been
[1:22:05] guarded so David realized that and we
[1:22:08] think sometimes he was he was such a
[1:22:10] great man he was such a powerful man but
[1:22:12] read all of them songs read all of
[1:22:15] through the life of job
[1:22:17] read all and the Bible is very accurate
[1:22:20] in the description of it all they were
[1:22:23] like us they had their days they had
[1:22:26] their times but God's Word never fails
[1:22:31] never has never will
[1:22:35] verse 4 in God I will praise His Word in
[1:22:40] God I have put my trust I will not fear
[1:22:45] what flesh can do unto me you know
[1:22:49] though God's laid me job said I will
[1:22:52] trust him with these eyes I shall see my
[1:22:56] Redeemer there was there was something
[1:22:59] about that putting their trust in God
[1:23:02] then he says in 94 19 Psalms 94 19 in
[1:23:07] the multitude of my thoughts within me
[1:23:11] like comforts
[1:23:14] do you like my soul and you know how the
[1:23:18] multitude of thoughts can become double
[1:23:20] multitude and triple multitude and
[1:23:22] non-stop sometimes the little thing that
[1:23:25] started like this suddenly is this big
[1:23:27] and then suddenly it's it's it's a
[1:23:32] simple illustration that we've heard
[1:23:35] where they went to a football game and
[1:23:37] they had a huddle and this person has
[1:23:40] already caught up in the in the conflict
[1:23:42] of his mind and all and they're having a
[1:23:45] huddle and that person looks down and
[1:23:46] says oh no they all huddled up to talk
[1:23:48] about me and you say I'll come on but
[1:23:53] hey in the multitude of my thoughts
[1:23:56] he says thy comforts delight my soul
[1:24:01] what is God's comforts his word that's
[1:24:05] how he his comfort he's come and he's
[1:24:07] taken his word and he is has given it to
[1:24:11] us he's laid it out to us not only that
[1:24:13] but he's also showed us that it lives
[1:24:15] that it's a life that it's not just
[1:24:18] words in a book but it's something as as
[1:24:21] Peter and John found out now that same
[1:24:24] life that was in Jesus was in them and
[1:24:27] they said look
[1:24:28] upon us such as we have now in the name
[1:24:32] of Jesus Christ rise up and walk you
[1:24:36] know who was brother Nash that came down
[1:24:39] he remember a few years back and he was
[1:24:42] he was I don't remember what country it
[1:24:44] was he was in and they took him over to
[1:24:47] the hospital the Heart Hospital and he
[1:24:50] walks in and he comes in and they begins
[1:24:52] to pray for some of those folks and he
[1:24:56] began to pray for everyone in that that
[1:24:58] Heart Hospital where it was that and he
[1:25:00] made it sound like a very poor place so
[1:25:02] not probably weren't at the type of
[1:25:03] Heart Hospital that we would go into it
[1:25:05] but more just probably just more a lot
[1:25:08] of beds with people suffering but he
[1:25:09] prayed for every single one of them and
[1:25:11] then he leaves and then he returns later
[1:25:15] and there was a young lady at the door
[1:25:18] and she comes up to him and she says do
[1:25:21] you remember me and he looks at her and
[1:25:23] says no I don't
[1:25:24] she says you remember that when you
[1:25:26] walked in there was one thrown on the
[1:25:28] floor with no hope and you prayed for me
[1:25:29] that's me to where if I remember right
[1:25:33] he said the mayor of the city asked him
[1:25:35] if he would come and pray for everybody
[1:25:37] because everybody that he pray for
[1:25:39] walked out of that possible well was
[1:25:43] that brother Nash oh is that Jesus
[1:25:45] Christ the same yesterday today I'm
[1:25:47] forever you know you say well I'm
[1:25:50] insignificant I can't oh just a simple
[1:25:53] word is you're one of God's children
[1:25:55] I can't reach out and touch somebody
[1:25:56] David said like like comforts delight my
[1:26:02] soul in in in this thought as we were
[1:26:08] have we had the videoconference with
[1:26:10] brother Matt yesterday and we're
[1:26:11] discussing how we were going to proceed
[1:26:13] and brother Lyle Johnson said something
[1:26:17] out just some ideas and some things and
[1:26:20] he finished with prayer for one another
[1:26:23] and even if we're not all in there in
[1:26:27] the same place there that doesn't mean
[1:26:29] you can't go over to somebody's house
[1:26:31] and pray for them you know does it have
[1:26:34] to know any child of God who has God in
[1:26:37] them has that same authority they shall
[1:26:42] lay their hands on the sick and they
[1:26:44] shall recover they shall anoint with oil
[1:26:49] and they shall be made well only the
[1:26:52] priests only in the minister no every
[1:26:54] child to go out so we have these
[1:26:57] promises we do not need to fear we do
[1:27:01] not to be need to be afraid we not need
[1:27:04] to have be held captive by those chains
[1:27:07] Psalms
[1:27:09] I mean Deuteronomy 29 five and six and
[1:27:11] this one I just wanted to show how
[1:27:13] Jehovah is telling Israel it's 29 five
[1:27:21] and six maybe if I didn't give you that
[1:27:24] one
[1:27:26] I'll read it here and I have led you 40
[1:27:31] years in the wilderness he said your
[1:27:33] clothes are not waxen old upon you and
[1:27:36] thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot
[1:27:41] I'd like to find those clothes makers
[1:27:44] and those shoe makers wouldn't you buy
[1:27:46] one pair of shoes and never have to buy
[1:27:47] another pair again but no this was
[1:27:50] Jehovah God this was the guy one who
[1:27:52] kept his promise who was with them he
[1:27:54] says you have not eaten bread neither
[1:27:58] heavy drank wine or strong drink that ye
[1:28:01] might know that I am the Lord your God
[1:28:07] he tells them I'm the one that's done
[1:28:09] this for you and geez Jesus Christ the
[1:28:12] same yesterday today and forever
[1:28:14] now deuteronomy 31:6 again a promise of
[1:28:19] the lord here
[1:28:21] he says be strong and of good courage
[1:28:25] fear not how many times in the
[1:28:28] scriptures does Jesus use it
[1:28:30] fear not there are two spirits in this
[1:28:35] world there's a spirit of love which is
[1:28:38] God and there's a spirit of fear what
[1:28:41] you say if it's something that is
[1:28:44] driving you by fear holding you by fear
[1:28:47] intimidating you by fear that is not the
[1:28:49] Spirit of God God does not condemn God
[1:28:52] come VIX he goes into your heart and
[1:28:55] says son daughter child that's not good
[1:28:58] for you Satan thing goes and it says see
[1:29:01] you're not a son of God you're not a
[1:29:02] child of God or else you would have done
[1:29:04] those things or else you wouldn't had
[1:29:05] those thoughts or you in the back - like
[1:29:07] that God says hey you are my child I
[1:29:09] don't appreciate Jack let's work on that
[1:29:12] there's a lot of difference on how you
[1:29:15] do that even how you when you're dealing
[1:29:16] with your own children how you talk to
[1:29:19] them what attitude you deal with them as
[1:29:21] parents sometimes we get angry we get
[1:29:24] mad and we blow up but when we can talk
[1:29:27] to them in a way that's encouraging that
[1:29:30] is a strengthening and and tell him look
[1:29:32] I'm not mad at you I want you to learn
[1:29:35] from this I let's make this an
[1:29:37] experience to grow with that's how God
[1:29:40] works Satan says all your useless God
[1:29:42] doesn't even love you anymore
[1:29:43] and he dominates by a spirit of fear so
[1:29:46] he says be of good courage be strong in
[1:29:49] a good kid and fear not nor be afraid of
[1:29:52] them for the Lord thy God he that it
[1:29:56] that do Duff go with thee he will not
[1:29:59] fail thee nor forsake thee he can say
[1:30:03] one one at one paragraph and cover more
[1:30:07] that I could promise in a million years
[1:30:09] and keep it and never fail it you know
[1:30:13] it's you know brother Branham says we
[1:30:15] defeat Satan with the word and what
[1:30:17] we're telling you or we recording - is
[1:30:19] the word of God it does not change it's
[1:30:22] not any weaker today it's not been
[1:30:24] diluted in no way is it any less than
[1:30:28] the day he spoke
[1:30:29] it's no less when he says do not fear as
[1:30:32] when he said let there be light it's a
[1:30:36] promise of God do not fear
[1:30:38] therefore he puts love in your heart so
[1:30:41] you don't have to fear now watch this
[1:30:44] here in 63 God hiding himself in
[1:30:47] simplicity and I'm glad he does that
[1:30:51] because I'm a pretty simple person and
[1:30:54] it takes some simplicity so I can
[1:30:57] understand it he's not so educated was
[1:31:01] such high words with but he can if he
[1:31:04] needs to be but he can come down to your
[1:31:07] level he says so he went I mean let me
[1:31:11] read this so he went so he sent the be
[1:31:15] of death to sting him and as the bee
[1:31:18] began to hum around him you know beasts
[1:31:20] insects have stingers and death has a
[1:31:24] stinger but you know if an insect ever
[1:31:27] stings deep it pulls its stinger out so
[1:31:30] if it ever anchored in a man ignored him
[1:31:33] and if he had just been an ordinary man
[1:31:36] a prophet he had stung many a prophet
[1:31:38] and he died but when he stung that one
[1:31:42] he lost his stinger he did not have no
[1:31:45] more stinger of that god he anchored his
[1:31:49] flesh and in a manual and it pulled the
[1:31:53] stinger out of death Satan has no death
[1:31:59] no power of death no authority for death
[1:32:03] that's in God's hands
[1:32:06] because a stinger was left in cotton and
[1:32:10] you know and I thought about it and I
[1:32:11] said why is why is he the physician of
[1:32:16] physicians why is he the master of every
[1:32:19] situation because he went through
[1:32:22] everything in one of the situations he
[1:32:24] went through every sickness he went
[1:32:26] through death he went through hell he
[1:32:28] went through grave he went through all
[1:32:30] of it for you and from here you say I
[1:32:34] have a cold
[1:32:35] he had a cold you said I have a headache
[1:32:39] he had a headache he had injured he had
[1:32:43] insult he had wounds he had every bit of
[1:32:46] it in fact he died with every sin of
[1:32:51] mine on him he felt it he cried out
[1:32:55] father father why has thou forsaken me
[1:32:59] he understands loneliness he understands
[1:33:02] separation because he went for it for
[1:33:05] you and for me so here he says he took
[1:33:07] that stinger of death out of saying he
[1:33:10] buried it in himself therefore death has
[1:33:12] no power over you and I there's a
[1:33:15] resurrection promise there's even a
[1:33:18] promises for those who will not taste
[1:33:20] death Joshua 1:9 again he tells us have
[1:33:27] not I commanded thee be strong and of
[1:33:29] good ear
[1:33:30] of good courage be not afraid neither be
[1:33:34] thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[1:33:36] with you
[1:33:37] whither so ever thou goest because he's
[1:33:41] been there before he walked that path he
[1:33:45] went down to that place he walked all
[1:33:47] the way down to the well on the side
[1:33:49] there so he could meet with that woman
[1:33:51] by the way he went over to Simeon's
[1:33:54] house that great Pharisee or a high
[1:33:58] priest who he was knowing how he was
[1:34:02] going to be treated no he was gone but
[1:34:04] he went anyways because there was a
[1:34:06] prostitute woman that was going to me
[1:34:09] but he went anyways he put himself in a
[1:34:13] place to be ridiculed to be criticized
[1:34:15] to be gazed at to be made fun of to
[1:34:19] redeem one of his to reach out to one of
[1:34:22] his he says here again he says for the
[1:34:27] Lord thy God is with thee whether so
[1:34:30] ever thou goest he's walked this place
[1:34:33] he's been there before did not the Bible
[1:34:36] say at 12 years old that he confounded
[1:34:39] the wise the scholars the teachers he
[1:34:44] went to school now his school might have
[1:34:47] been a little different than our school
[1:34:49] but he learned the Bible says he learned
[1:34:51] through experiences he was subject to
[1:34:56] temptation as we are and he learned any
[1:34:58] overcame in Isaiah 41:10 he tells us
[1:35:06] fear thou not for I am with thee be not
[1:35:11] dismayed for I am thy God they put your
[1:35:15] name right there I'm Peter Scott for the
[1:35:19] our knees God I'm sister Holly's gone
[1:35:22] Holly right didn't get it wrong I'm
[1:35:27] sister Lily Anne is gone but your name
[1:35:29] in there brother Matthews God brother
[1:35:31] Jeremy is gone but the Jordan is gone
[1:35:33] but your name right there
[1:35:35] I am by God I will strengthen thee yay
[1:35:38] I will help the yay I will uphold thee
[1:35:41] with the right hand of my righteousness
[1:35:44] there's nothing to fear you know and
[1:35:46] when you have experienced that you know
[1:35:49] it to be the truth brother was a brother
[1:35:54] Tim that ministered last Sunday when he
[1:35:58] was talking if he doesn't go back to
[1:35:59] those places in your life where you know
[1:36:02] you
[1:36:03] where you know that was God there was
[1:36:06] not a shadow of a doubt that was gone
[1:36:08] and sometimes you just go and you walk
[1:36:10] back there and you say like he told
[1:36:13] Jacob go back to that place cuz that was
[1:36:16] gone I think back some of my experiences
[1:36:19] over time and I say that was God that
[1:36:23] was God being being delivered from a
[1:36:25] burden one time as a young man when we
[1:36:27] first came from California we were in a
[1:36:30] prayer meeting and my heart was so heavy
[1:36:32] but I didn't know what it was it was
[1:36:35] just a burden upon me and we were in
[1:36:38] prayer meeting and suddenly one of the
[1:36:40] brothers stood up and said we need to
[1:36:42] pray for this brother and we're all with
[1:36:43] our eyes closed and praying and seeking
[1:36:45] God and didn't know who he was talking
[1:36:47] to he's got such a heavy burden on him
[1:36:49] right now and next thing I know of some
[1:36:51] hands are laid up on my shoulder and he
[1:36:53] begins to pray for me I didn't even know
[1:36:57] what the burden was I just knew I had a
[1:36:59] heavy burden and he began to pray for me
[1:37:02] and suddenly and this is how I can
[1:37:04] describe it it was if somebody had been
[1:37:06] sitting on my shoulders and suddenly it
[1:37:10] was released and gone it was completely
[1:37:13] gone and I began to cry and worship the
[1:37:17] Lord and I remind myself when I feel
[1:37:20] tired and when I feel a burden I say God
[1:37:22] you're still the mighty God you're still
[1:37:25] that God that delivers and you're still
[1:37:28] the the God that come and can minister
[1:37:30] to us in a sweet quiet way you're also
[1:37:34] the God that can reach over and catch
[1:37:36] our attention in a good swift shakin
[1:37:38] sometimes hey I need your attention now
[1:37:41] pay attention now each one of us and
[1:37:43] we're reminded he says be Jesus I will
[1:37:47] uphold thee with the right hand of my
[1:37:49] righteousness he comes any ministers to
[1:37:51] us that way and I like that when he
[1:37:53] brother Scott was was talking about
[1:37:55] Tim's sorry was ministering that way
[1:37:58] just saying remind yourself sometimes go
[1:38:01] back to where you last met him if you
[1:38:03] have a Menem for awhile say hey Lord I'd
[1:38:05] like to have this experience again I'd
[1:38:07] like to have you come
[1:38:08] I like to have some fellowship with you
[1:38:13] lamentations 357 he said thou drew us
[1:38:21] near thou came here you came here in the
[1:38:24] day that I called upon thee and you said
[1:38:26] fear not how did he address Mary fear
[1:38:31] not
[1:38:32] don't be afraid fear not it's caught
[1:38:34] this is caught he says you drew near on
[1:38:37] the day that I called upon thee and I
[1:38:39] you told me you don't have to fear you
[1:38:42] don't have to be afraid there can be a
[1:38:44] peace about this now let's go to Matthew
[1:38:47] a few more scriptures here let's go to
[1:38:50] Matthew chapter 6 and we'll go from 26
[1:38:54] to 34 and this was another thing that it
[1:38:58] was in my heart now saying Lord were
[1:39:00] anxious about these days were anxious
[1:39:02] were already seeing the effects of this
[1:39:06] coronavirus and already the loss of jobs
[1:39:09] and yesterday I had a couple of
[1:39:15] homeowner appointments to take care of
[1:39:18] after in the lived in homes and I report
[1:39:22] them then to the service contractor for
[1:39:24] that company and her name is Nicole and
[1:39:28] she used to be my csr of the cabinet
[1:39:31] company and then when she moved to town
[1:39:33] she went to work for these folks and so
[1:39:35] I know her quite well and we work
[1:39:36] together so I call her and let her know
[1:39:38] these jobs are done so she said thank
[1:39:41] you very much he said was starting
[1:39:43] tomorrow we are canceling all homeowner
[1:39:46] appointments we do not want anybody
[1:39:48] going into anybody's homes and take
[1:39:51] something in with them or go into
[1:39:54] somebody's home and get sick from
[1:39:56] something they have so all homeowners
[1:39:58] appointments are cancelled as of right
[1:40:00] now
[1:40:00] and some some days that's two thirds of
[1:40:03] our work on some days it's minimal now
[1:40:07] I'm a salaried employee from the company
[1:40:10] I'm there's two of us the other one that
[1:40:12] works with us is a peace worker or a
[1:40:15] subcontractor and we give him work so I
[1:40:20] called him yesterday and I said ever all
[1:40:23] the jobs are in my my half a town today
[1:40:25] we split town in half so I said to him I
[1:40:28] said do you want to do any work or do
[1:40:30] you want the day off and he says I don't
[1:40:32] get paid if I don't work I said okay
[1:40:35] then I'll split it with you guys you
[1:40:37] know I'm the one that delegates the work
[1:40:39] so we split it and in then it but it
[1:40:43] realized now because he told me if I
[1:40:46] don't work I don't get paid and you
[1:40:48] could hear it his voice
[1:40:50] I've got to work he's older than me he's
[1:40:52] I think he's 63 64 and he's telling me
[1:40:55] his body's giving out on him because
[1:40:56] he's been doing this for so long and I
[1:40:59] could hear the fear in his voice but God
[1:41:02] says behold the fowls of the air for
[1:41:05] they sow not they don't get up at 6:00
[1:41:09] in the morning because got to be at work
[1:41:10] at 7:00 and they gotta work til or else
[1:41:12] they're not gonna get paid they sow not
[1:41:14] neither do they reap nor gather into
[1:41:17] barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth
[1:41:20] them and he says are you not much better
[1:41:24] than they that's his words to us
[1:41:31] and then let's continue that which of
[1:41:34] you by taking thought can add one cubit
[1:41:36] unto his stature we can't make ourselves
[1:41:39] a bigger better by your own thinking we
[1:41:41] might think we can but we don't and why
[1:41:45] take ye thought for raiment consider the
[1:41:47] lilies of the field and how they grow
[1:41:49] they don't toil they don't struggle
[1:41:51] neither do they spin yet I say to him
[1:41:54] that even Solomon in all his glory was
[1:41:57] not arrayed like one of these and all
[1:42:00] that Solomon did in all it did and it
[1:42:02] was this kingdom was glorious he goes
[1:42:04] but these simple lilies have more glory
[1:42:07] in them he says let's continue on
[1:42:11] wherefore if God so clothe the grass of
[1:42:13] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[1:42:16] cast into the oven shall he not much
[1:42:19] more clothe you O ye of little faith
[1:42:22] Jesus I say Lord help down my unbelief
[1:42:25] there sometimes I'm questioning there
[1:42:28] sometimes I'm wondering but your word
[1:42:30] says you'll not forsake us you'll meet
[1:42:32] us therefore take no thought let me say
[1:42:37] it this way therefore don't get anxious
[1:42:38] and worried saying what shall we eat or
[1:42:41] what shall we drink
[1:42:43] I just went to Walmart I just went to
[1:42:45] Costco and there was nothing on the
[1:42:47] shelves Lord I'll let him take it back I
[1:42:50] said well you know there was 12,000 once
[1:42:54] out there and I was ministering to them
[1:42:56] and they were hungry and there was just
[1:43:00] a couple of fishes and a couple of
[1:43:02] loaves of bread and I looked at it and I
[1:43:04] said more than Edith and he began to
[1:43:08] give and to give and to give and to give
[1:43:10] and there wasn't any less of it because
[1:43:14] when they finished they gathered up
[1:43:16] baskets of it left
[1:43:18] more than if he says wherefore if God so
[1:43:22] clothes the grass of the field I'm sorry
[1:43:25] take therefore take no Thought saying
[1:43:26] what shall we eat or what shall we drink
[1:43:29] or withal shall we be clothed he told
[1:43:33] them he says you went through those
[1:43:35] forty years your shoes never wore out
[1:43:37] and your clothes never wear I'm the same
[1:43:39] yesterday today and forever
[1:43:41] so here he's telling him the same thing
[1:43:43] again he said for after all these things
[1:43:46] do the Gentiles seek and I said you know
[1:43:51] I'm a Gentile I'm not a Jew in the
[1:43:54] natural but I said for after all these
[1:43:57] things do don't seek who get in line at
[1:43:59] two o'clock in the morning at a Costco
[1:44:02] and spend their whole day in line to
[1:44:03] hopefully get in something and they're
[1:44:05] anxious and they're fighting and all but
[1:44:08] my family father knows that what you
[1:44:11] have need he knows all those things and
[1:44:15] he can take one and make it ten and I'll
[1:44:19] prove it to you he said give me a tenth
[1:44:21] and see if I don't bless him and then he
[1:44:28] says but seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:44:31] God and His righteousness and all these
[1:44:34] things shall be added unto you I was at
[1:44:38] the store the other day I had stopped on
[1:44:40] the way home to get pick something up at
[1:44:42] the Family Dollar I think that they
[1:44:45] opened right by the house and then I
[1:44:47] heard somebody say what are you doing a
[1:44:48] narrator I was my daughter Elizabeth and
[1:44:51] I said well I came in to get something
[1:44:53] and she goes why should have told me I
[1:44:54] was just at Walmart I could have got it
[1:44:56] for you I said well you know you were it
[1:44:57] woman so she goes around the corner and
[1:44:59] this family dollar they still hand rolls
[1:45:01] a toilet paper
[1:45:02] so she says I'm gonna grab a couple of
[1:45:04] packs because I see them here and I'll
[1:45:06] take them so we have them and there was
[1:45:08] another gentleman there and he looks up
[1:45:11] and he goes I guess that's a smart idea
[1:45:13] it's not what I came for but I guess
[1:45:15] that's a smart idea
[1:45:18] and I'm thinking I said so what's this
[1:45:20] crazy thing did everybody assume we came
[1:45:25] in there was some for us and even he got
[1:45:28] some nothing to worry about I think the
[1:45:31] fear God said he would profile God said
[1:45:36] he would me it reminded me of this
[1:45:39] brother branham was with that group of
[1:45:41] men and they were travelling and the
[1:45:43] vehicle ran out of gas and brother
[1:45:46] Branham says what do you have he said we
[1:45:48] just got this jug of water and he said
[1:45:49] give it to me
[1:45:50] it goes back to when they asked Jesus at
[1:45:55] the the marriage here in Cana and said
[1:45:57] go ask him there's no wine is it
[1:46:00] bringing fill him up with water
[1:46:02] brother Brown just takes that same
[1:46:04] promise and he pours it right into the
[1:46:06] gas tank because now let's get in let's
[1:46:08] go now did it turn into gas or did God
[1:46:13] make that vehicle run on water does it
[1:46:15] make a difference the vehicle went he's
[1:46:19] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:46:21] and forever he says take therefore no
[1:46:23] thought for the morrow for the morrow
[1:46:25] shall take thought of these things of
[1:46:27] itself sufficient unto the day is the
[1:46:30] evil thereof don't stay up all night
[1:46:34] worrying about tomorrow rather Lord I
[1:46:38] lay my down myself down to rest I commit
[1:46:41] myself to you I'm going to trust in you
[1:46:44] for that that's God's Word and he
[1:46:48] remember you can take god cause where
[1:46:51] that satan and defeat him every time
[1:46:54] Saint John chapter 14 go to verse 1 and
[1:47:00] then we'll go to verse 27 let not your
[1:47:02] heart be troubled you believe in God
[1:47:05] believe also in me let not your heart be
[1:47:09] troubled
[1:47:10] don't let it get so anxious don't let it
[1:47:13] get so nervous
[1:47:14] don't let it begin to beat so hard and
[1:47:16] you feel it's going to blow out of your
[1:47:18] body he said believe in God believe also
[1:47:22] in me
[1:47:23] he says and then we'll go down to 27
[1:47:25] because he says peace I leave with you
[1:47:27] my peace I give unto you not as a world
[1:47:31] giveth give I unto you let not your
[1:47:34] heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:47:38] afraid that's what he's saying fear has
[1:47:43] no place in God not this type of fear
[1:47:47] fear in the sense of respect and
[1:47:50] reverence yes but fear being afraid like
[1:47:53] Adam and Eve when they were afraid and
[1:47:55] they ran from the presence of God but
[1:48:00] the the angel comes up to Mary and says
[1:48:03] fear not don't be afraid of what I have
[1:48:06] the news I have for you is something
[1:48:10] this world has desired that the earth is
[1:48:14] groaning all creation has been waiting
[1:48:17] on this since the fall for unto you this
[1:48:20] day a savior is born so he says let not
[1:48:24] your heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:48:26] afraid let's go to Philippians
[1:48:31] and let's take this attitude Philippians
[1:48:33] chapter 4 verses six way be careful for
[1:48:38] nothing be being nervous about nothing
[1:48:41] be troubled about nothing but in
[1:48:43] everything by prayer and supplication
[1:48:45] with Thanksgiving brother branham has
[1:48:49] taught us that when you you go and you
[1:48:52] ask God for some and you believe it then
[1:48:54] you begin to thank him for answering for
[1:48:58] meeting he also says praise and
[1:49:01] thankfulness waters that promise and
[1:49:04] brings it to grow thank you Lord for my
[1:49:07] heading thank you look for me to my
[1:49:09] knees thank you for making with us one
[1:49:11] dollar match that all the way to ten
[1:49:13] because I needed to hit God is able to
[1:49:15] do all those things he said but in
[1:49:17] everything by prayer and supplication
[1:49:18] with Thanksgiving let your requests be
[1:49:22] made known unto God and the peace of God
[1:49:25] which passes all understanding shall
[1:49:28] keep your hearts and minds through
[1:49:31] Christ Jesus sometimes you don't know
[1:49:34] why but he never I said figure out why
[1:49:37] he just said take him at his word and
[1:49:39] rest in that and then he finishes with
[1:49:41] verse eight finally brethren whatsoever
[1:49:46] things are true whatsoever things are
[1:49:49] honest whatsoever things are just
[1:49:52] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:49:55] things are lovely whatsoever things of
[1:49:58] are of good report if there be any
[1:50:00] virtue any strength in it and if there
[1:50:02] be any praise think on these things he
[1:50:07] tells us what how to take our attitude
[1:50:09] in this time and change it and make it
[1:50:12] where you can lay down at night go to
[1:50:14] sleep and you can get up in the morning
[1:50:17] with a smile in your face and you can go
[1:50:19] to work and know that God is with you he
[1:50:22] said think among these things what is
[1:50:24] true what is honest what is just what is
[1:50:28] pure it's God's Word God said he'd be
[1:50:31] with me he would never fail me he'd meet
[1:50:33] all my needs and sickness he has already
[1:50:35] held me in trouble he's already
[1:50:37] delivered me I can talk to him I can
[1:50:40] have a consultation with him I can have
[1:50:42] a
[1:50:43] with a physician of physicians and if
[1:50:45] I've got a question he knows all the
[1:50:47] answers I've said this many a times if
[1:50:51] you're in school and you're having
[1:50:52] trouble with a specific topic maybe it's
[1:50:56] in English maybe it's math maybe it's a
[1:51:01] science he's a God to put it all
[1:51:04] together he knows every language it
[1:51:06] exists he knows how it all works
[1:51:08] talk to him about it brother
[1:51:11] Greene I remember his testimony when he
[1:51:14] was in South America and he had just
[1:51:16] finished ministering and he this it was
[1:51:19] quite a collage convention and his
[1:51:21] sister comes up and and he knew that
[1:51:23] they had come and they would come up and
[1:51:25] give him nice gifts and they wanted to
[1:51:27] show their appreciation so he went down
[1:51:29] to where she came up to the alternative
[1:51:30] they listen to and she begins to talk to
[1:51:33] him in Spanish and he begins to answer
[1:51:37] her in English and the brother said I
[1:51:40] thought you didn't know Spanish she said
[1:51:45] well she was talking to me in English
[1:51:46] she goes she doesn't know English he
[1:51:50] goes well I don't know in Spanish but he
[1:51:52] does so brother green heard it in
[1:51:54] English and she heard in Spanish he's
[1:51:56] still Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:51:57] today and forever he hasn't changed you
[1:52:01] know he's the God so these things these
[1:52:03] things are true these things are lovely
[1:52:05] these things are of a good rapport think
[1:52:09] on these things
[1:52:12] and then Peter first Peter chapter 5
[1:52:16] verse 7 says will sum it up with this on
[1:52:21] the scriptures here first Peter 5:7
[1:52:25] casting all your cares upon him for he
[1:52:29] cares for you Lord I I'm not able to
[1:52:32] bear this I'm not able to hold it up I'm
[1:52:36] not able my shoulders are stooping my
[1:52:38] legs are tired is been he said cast your
[1:52:40] cares on me well let me bear them for
[1:52:43] you because I do care for you you're one
[1:52:45] of mine here my children he says on that
[1:52:48] view so this great doctor of doctors the
[1:52:53] one who who not only went or could I say
[1:52:57] it didn't go to school to study about it
[1:53:01] didn't spend time in the seminary to
[1:53:05] learn the word didn't but rather he was
[1:53:10] the Word made flesh he was but he did
[1:53:14] that by experience in the sense that he
[1:53:16] bore it upon himself he chose to do it
[1:53:19] so he could walk in my place and your
[1:53:22] place and understand
[1:53:24] when they thought there was a shortage
[1:53:26] he increased it when there seemed to be
[1:53:30] no way out he made a way in fact when
[1:53:33] there was no doorway he just went
[1:53:35] through the wall
[1:53:37] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:53:39] forever
[1:53:40] testimonies overtime that we have heard
[1:53:43] and we have we've got to witness or
[1:53:45] we've got to share that he's still the
[1:53:47] same yesterday in every situation in
[1:53:50] every country um we talk about the Peter
[1:53:54] walking on the water Jesus walk in the
[1:53:56] water there's a testimony of I believe
[1:53:58] it was in Africa there was a large group
[1:54:00] of believers going over to service and
[1:54:03] they walked they had to walk and they
[1:54:06] got to a swollen river and they said now
[1:54:08] we can't go to service this and the
[1:54:10] brothers said the disciples walked on
[1:54:13] water Jesus walked on water come on and
[1:54:16] they walked across the river well I
[1:54:18] understand because these Jesus Christ
[1:54:20] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:54:23] changes not a friend of my father's he
[1:54:26] was driving his car up through the hills
[1:54:28] and they had been ministering that day
[1:54:30] and they were headed back home and it
[1:54:32] got very foggy and somehow or another
[1:54:33] the car slipped and he went off the side
[1:54:36] of the road and it was hanging half off
[1:54:39] the side of the road down to fall down
[1:54:41] the side of the cliff and he was
[1:54:43] terrified because his wife and the
[1:54:45] children in the car didn't want to move
[1:54:47] and he hears a tap on the window and he
[1:54:51] turns around he opens the window and the
[1:54:53] man says call him by name he said I'm on

[1:54:56] it for you next thing you know this is
[1:54:58] the cars picked up put back on the road
[1:55:00] and they were gone

[1:55:06] they called me by name he's the same
[1:55:09] yesterday today and forever
[1:55:11] he can take a situation and say peace be
[1:55:16] still and the winds and the waves will
[1:55:20] be he's still the same yesterday today
[1:55:23] and forever

[1:56:25] time but if we'll take your word and

[1:56:37] work living away Lord where we're

[2:06:57] until then with joy I'll carry on hold
[2:07:02] on okay brother
[2:07:07] Matthew wants to post a video message
[2:07:10] here so they're gonna try to set it so
[2:07:16] it would also be under whatsapp let's
[2:07:18] see what this is
[2:07:28] hello and God bless you I greet you in
[2:07:31] the name of the Lord it's very hard to
[2:07:33] believe how rapidly things have changed
[2:07:36] for all of us in these last just two
[2:07:39] weeks and then I would be greeting you
[2:07:41] by way of a video message I think
[2:07:44] there's no question that we're living in
[2:07:46] a time that is unparalleled in history
[2:07:48] it's a time when the whole world is
[2:07:51] shaking the world's living in an
[2:07:53] atmosphere of fear anxiety and complete
[2:07:57] uncertainty
[2:07:58] I'm so glad tonight that its second
[2:08:01] Timothy 1:7 says that we haven't been
[2:08:04] given the spirit of fear but of power
[2:08:07] love and of a sound mind we've received
[2:08:10] Shalom it's so wonderful to know that
[2:08:14] Shalom is a word that means peace means
[2:08:17] harmony the means wholeness and
[2:08:20] completeness tranquility we don't fear
[2:08:24] the devil and I'll say that we're not
[2:08:27] going to participate in the atmosphere
[2:08:30] of panic a fear that we're seeing run
[2:08:32] rampant in the whole world today it's
[2:08:35] hard to believe that a virus that only
[2:08:37] has a 1% mortality rate has literally
[2:08:41] brought the world to its knees stock
[2:08:44] markets all of the systems of economy
[2:08:49] are shaking right now
[2:08:51] with the virus with a 1% mortality rate
[2:08:54] imagine if next year there's something
[2:08:55] worse with a higher rate makes me say
[2:08:58] like the songwriter said then I cry on
[2:09:02] Rock of Ages high thou me as of now I'm
[2:09:06] sure you're aware that we've been asked
[2:09:08] by President Trump to do everything we
[2:09:10] can to curb the spread of this virus
[2:09:13] he's requested I'm sure that you're
[2:09:16] aware that we don't gather in groups of
[2:09:18] more than 10 people the governor of
[2:09:20] Arizona and also the mayor of Tucson has
[2:09:23] declared a state of emergency I want to
[2:09:25] be clear that and point out that no one
[2:09:29] is asking us to deny our faith to deny
[2:09:31] our God so I believe that we owe this
[2:09:35] a Christian which brother branham said
[2:09:37] is living for others to help in every
[2:09:41] way we can to stop the spread of this
[2:09:44] virus I want to emphasize a couple of
[2:09:47] things to you that this isn't as some as
[2:09:49] suggesting a time of persecution it's
[2:09:53] not religious persecution it's also not
[2:09:56] a tribulation or plague because perhaps
[2:09:59] your hasn't happened because I'm here
[2:10:02] because you're still here
[2:10:03] this isn't as some has suggested the
[2:10:06] squeeze what's clear from the word is
[2:10:08] that the bride receives the squeeze and
[2:10:12] the pressure in an ecclesiastical way
[2:10:15] while other men have said it's Israel
[2:10:17] who receives it in a physical way
[2:10:19] brother Branham says and questions some
[2:10:21] answers so clearly that the bride won't
[2:10:23] go through that persecution but she'll
[2:10:26] be raptured but the church will what we
[2:10:29] face and the squeeze that we face is an
[2:10:32] ecclesiastical squeeze which is banned
[2:10:34] the anointing of God it's banned the
[2:10:37] gifts of the Spirit it's divine healing
[2:10:39] it's banned prayer lines and altar calls
[2:10:41] and worship in the spirit we don't need
[2:10:44] to fear corona virus we need to fear
[2:10:46] that virus as I already stated in the
[2:10:50] text to the whatsapp group
[2:10:51] that as we go through this time and
[2:10:54] until we get past this we'll be meeting
[2:10:56] with a small group of ministry musicians
[2:10:59] song leaders audio-video personnel and
[2:11:02] we'll be live-streaming our services to
[2:11:05] you through video and their telephone
[2:11:06] hookup which I'm very thankful that we
[2:11:08] have we're asking you that you don't
[2:11:12] come to church during this time but that
[2:11:14] you assemble yourselves with your family
[2:11:16] along with those who maybe don't have
[2:11:19] the internet capabilities I'm asking you
[2:11:22] to reverently stream the services until
[2:11:25] further notice I want to encourage you
[2:11:27] to make it a solemn assembly with
[2:11:29] reverence with prayer as I believe we're
[2:11:33] in a very serious time I believe this is
[2:11:35] just a sign of the time
[2:11:37] of course the situation that we see is
[2:11:40] ever-changing it's very fluid so I'll
[2:11:43] say to look for new announcements to be
[2:11:46] made often as we update you on how we'll
[2:11:48] continue
[2:11:49] and how we can convene in person again
[2:11:51] and when we can convene in person again
[2:11:53] and be all together I want to end this
[2:11:56] by encouraging you to view this no
[2:11:58] different as the children of Israel did
[2:12:00] in Goshen as they quarantine themselves
[2:12:04] in their own homes but a notice they
[2:12:06] didn't just close the door and hide in
[2:12:09] fear but they actually had Communion and
[2:12:11] worship it was a time of eating the word
[2:12:14] so I say to you seize this opportunity
[2:12:16] with your families I'm seizing it with
[2:12:19] mine this is the time more than ever
[2:12:23] before to listen to the message to read
[2:12:26] your Bible to reestablish the family
[2:12:29] altar in your home have worship and
[2:12:32] singing and create an atmosphere that
[2:12:34] the Holy Spirit is pleased to dwell in
[2:12:36] which is applying the token so I say to
[2:12:40] you apply a fresh coat of blood to the
[2:12:43] doorpost of your home and in your hearts
[2:12:45] and resolve to being a time of Passover
[2:12:48] during this time I'm United with you in
[2:12:52] my faith against this demon spirit that
[2:12:55] they've labeled Cova 19 we believe and
[2:12:59] we're taught we have a token we have
[2:13:01] rights and the word to stand against it
[2:13:03] and to curse it from our families and
[2:13:05] from our homes and if we get sick as
[2:13:09] with any sickness we believe in divine
[2:13:12] healing and we stand upon that we
[2:13:14] believe that we can receive healing that
[2:13:17] there's an atonement the same atonement
[2:13:19] that saves us also heals our body I'm
[2:13:22] not sure at this point
[2:13:24] right now as I record this if I'll be
[2:13:26] able to travel this weekend I'm still
[2:13:28] praying and asking the Lord for
[2:13:30] direction in that decision so I would
[2:13:32] ask you to pray for me I cover your
[2:13:34] prayers at this time it's very possible
[2:13:37] the domestic travel ban will be put in
[2:13:39] place I'm not sure it reminds me very
[2:13:41] much of the Apostle Paul in in first
[2:13:45] Thessalonians the Apostle Paul says
[2:13:47] wherefore we
[2:13:48] came unto you I Paul again I would have
[2:13:51] came unto you but Satan hindered us so
[2:13:54] if this happens we'll be ministering to
[2:13:57] you via a live stream streaming of a
[2:14:01] video and a phone hookup which I'm very
[2:14:04] thankful brother Jordan has already set
[2:14:05] up for us so we'll be streaming that
[2:14:07] from here and Buford to you and and and
[2:14:10] know this that I'm standing with you
[2:14:13] in faith and I encourage you to stand
[2:14:17] with me and in this time to stand
[2:14:19] against this demon spirit and to conduct
[2:14:22] ourselves as Christians I'm committed to
[2:14:25] you during these troublesome times and
[2:14:27] Lord willing we're gonna see you very
[2:14:29] soon look for what's at for further
[2:14:32] announcements I'll be streaming the
[2:14:33] services and I'll be in prayer with you

[2:14:43] very hard so how should we conduct
[2:14:50] ourselves what is our attitude I say
