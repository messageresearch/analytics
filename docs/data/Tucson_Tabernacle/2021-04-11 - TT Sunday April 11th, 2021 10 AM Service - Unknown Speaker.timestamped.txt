[50:22] it's kind of nice to have some music in
[50:25] the background
[50:27] when you're talking and getting prepared
[50:29] but just a few things that we need to
[50:30] bring to your attention
[50:33] i'd like to make brother eddie mcfadden
[50:35] welcome back
[50:37] stand up
[50:44] say graduated is that is that how you
[50:45] would say it from the national guard
[50:48] i thought i said you're straighter and
[50:49] you're taller
[50:52] i appreciate that he had desired in his
[50:54] heart to come back to
[50:55] being in arizona and the lord granted
[50:56] that so appreciate it
[50:58] god bless you brother eddie so good
[51:01] things to know that
[51:02] the lord is mindful of us so i
[51:04] appreciate that
[51:07] just to share testimony and then just
[51:09] some things to share with you
[51:12] um my daughter sarah last tuesday
[51:15] morning
[51:16] she was vomiting and that's the day she
[51:18] goes to dialysis
[51:19] and she had to report that to the
[51:22] dialysis center so
[51:23] that was a symptom of covid so they told
[51:26] her she couldn't come in
[51:27] to the to the place where she goes for
[51:30] dialysis and she would have to go
[51:31] to the the dallas center that's
[51:35] designated for covid
[51:38] so there was concern because now she's
[51:39] going into a place
[51:41] that people that have coveted so and she
[51:44] was asking
[51:45] the lord you know to help help her out
[51:47] and all and
[51:48] they gave her a test but they couldn't
[51:50] do a quick test it had to be three or
[51:51] four days out and they told her maybe
[51:53] she may have to go there
[51:54] for several weeks before she's allowed
[51:56] to return
[51:58] to where she normally gets her care so
[52:01] we were praying about and asking the
[52:02] lord to
[52:03] to to deal in that situation and of
[52:05] course she got nervous she got worried
[52:07] her blood pressure began to spike
[52:09] sarah's been off blood better blood
[52:11] pressure medication for two years now
[52:12] completely
[52:14] but her blood pressure got to extreme
[52:16] heights and all and
[52:18] you know as a family as her sisters mom
[52:20] and dad we we get
[52:21] worried we get troubled by it too so we
[52:24] prayed
[52:24] but yesterday after the
[52:28] memorial service we were talking here
[52:30] and
[52:31] i brought it to the brother's attention
[52:34] to remember her in prayer because she
[52:36] may have to go there for an extended
[52:37] time but
[52:38] the whole time my phone was buzzing
[52:41] and so after we're done talking i looked
[52:43] up and sarah said i just got my cova
[52:45] test back and i'm negative
[52:47] and i can return back so i appreciate
[52:51] and she goes and my blood pressure's
[52:53] going back down
[52:54] we get nervous we get worried and and it
[52:57] affects our body
[52:58] there's no question about it so thank
[53:00] the lord for him being mindful of us and
[53:02] i appreciate that it's
[53:04] it's um you know they're my children
[53:09] even though they're not little children
[53:11] they're still your children and you
[53:12] still love them you still care for them
[53:14] so
[53:15] but appreciate god being so good to us
[53:17] and
[53:18] heard the the thank you note from the
[53:20] fiatoa family and
[53:23] it's not something you want to have to
[53:25] do
[53:26] but there is something that you could
[53:28] say it's a privilege to be part of a
[53:30] family
[53:32] that knows the lord it's it's
[53:35] it's much easier to do something like
[53:37] that when you know
[53:39] that god's mercy is there that our
[53:41] brother has crossed into a place that
[53:43] we're all longing to go to
[53:46] and there's a joy in the midst of sorrow
[53:48] and
[53:50] they said thank you and much
[53:51] appreciated for those that came and were
[53:53] able to be here and
[53:55] and and and just uh support the family
[53:59] so
[53:59] i i said to sister grace i said you're
[54:02] not alone in this remember
[54:04] you have a family of god with you and
[54:07] take advantage of it
[54:09] brother jeremy prayed we're not in this
[54:11] alone
[54:12] let's put our shoulder the wheels let's
[54:14] work together so
[54:17] now next sunday at the end of service
[54:22] brother daniel andes has asked for an
[54:25] extension
[54:26] of for one month it didn't feel that
[54:30] for the time that he was here was enough
[54:32] for him to be satisfied with the
[54:34] decision one direction or another
[54:37] so he's asked if we would allow him to
[54:38] come for another month
[54:40] in the same the same way when he was
[54:43] here this past time
[54:45] so this sunday at the end of service
[54:47] coming sunday
[54:48] we will vote on that for those of you
[54:51] that are listening in
[54:52] on the phone hookup or stream
[54:56] if during the week you'd either call in
[54:59] or if you can
[55:00] could be here tonight or wednesday
[55:01] knowing you can't be here next sunday
[55:03] if you would put your vote with your
[55:06] name on it
[55:08] in the offering box therefore we know
[55:10] that it is one of the members of the
[55:12] church
[55:13] to be counted at the end of next sunday
[55:15] morning service
[55:17] and at that time we will give brother
[55:19] daniel the answer to that
[55:21] and then we can proceed further that
[55:23] says is that clear
[55:26] i don't think it's as clear as i can
[55:28] make it but if you have any questions
[55:30] ask
[55:31] ask myself brother jordan brother head
[55:33] brother arnie
[55:35] so that'll be a week from today so
[55:38] and we'll see how god wants to do that's
[55:41] what we want
[55:44] let god have his way you know
[55:47] because when we do it our way
[55:51] we get into a lot of trouble sometimes
[55:54] we just say lord how did i
[55:56] get here and he says well you wanted to
[55:58] go so i let you go
[56:01] but today we are coming in at service
[56:04] and
[56:04] thank you like i guess i could keep you
[56:06] here the whole time can i god bless you
[56:08] sorry
[56:10] sometimes it gets real quiet up here so
[56:14] um coming in this this this morning
[56:16] talking with my wife and
[56:18] she's such a blessed lady she gets to
[56:20] hear me all the time
[56:22] or maybe maybe it's the other way around
[56:24] pray for the pray for her
[56:27] just talking a little bit you know
[56:28] sharing things and
[56:30] i don't know how the other ministers but
[56:32] sometimes i get nervous sunday morning
[56:34] driving in thinking about
[56:35] and i just she happens to be the one
[56:38] sitting there she gets so she gets to
[56:40] hear it
[56:42] but just just talking about how
[56:44] sometimes we put ourselves into
[56:45] positions
[56:47] and then we say oh god how did i get
[56:49] here
[56:50] but you know he used that illustration
[56:52] of the prodigal son
[56:54] because he knows that there were times
[56:56] that we would get in that same situation
[56:59] but he didn't leave us there something
[57:02] in your heart
[57:04] and that was a call that that nature of
[57:06] god that that
[57:07] seed that said in my father's house
[57:12] there are slaves or servants
[57:15] that are doing better than me and he
[57:18] said i'm
[57:18] going back and the father didn't stand
[57:22] there
[57:23] and say well he's going to have to come
[57:25] up here and get on his knees
[57:26] and beg me for forgiveness and then
[57:28] we'll see and i'm going to put him on a
[57:30] 90-day trial
[57:32] the father looked out and saw and ran
[57:34] towards him
[57:35] and said that's my son welcome thou
[57:39] welcome back if you'll stand with me
[57:45] we love the lord with all our heart
[57:50] with all our mind with all our strength
[57:53] and sometimes we have to say lord i'm
[57:55] sorry i haven't paid as much attention
[57:57] to you
[57:58] as i should have but you know what he's
[58:00] mindful of us all the time
[58:02] so let's read the first scripture
[58:06] then we'll pray from hebrews chapter 12
[58:10] verses 1 and 2.
[58:14] the word of god is true
[58:18] it's living it's a life
[58:21] and it produces amen wherefore seeing we
[58:25] also
[58:25] are compassed about with so great a
[58:27] cloud of witnesses
[58:29] let us lay aside every weight and the
[58:32] sin
[58:33] remember sin is unbelief and it
[58:36] it manifests itself in our actions
[58:41] that so doth easily beset us
[58:44] and let us run with patience the race
[58:47] that is set before us
[58:49] now here is how you should be running
[58:51] looking unto jesus the author
[58:53] and the finisher of our faith who for
[58:56] the joy that was set before him
[58:59] endured the cross despising the shame
[59:03] and is set down at the right hand of the
[59:06] throne of god
[59:07] amen let's bow our heads lord we we've
[59:10] read your word and
[59:11] your word is life lord and you
[59:15] you keep your word here they weren't
[59:17] just read and
[59:18] written on a book and recorded just
[59:20] because there was nothing else to do but
[59:21] lord
[59:22] they are life-giving they are
[59:25] life-changing lord
[59:27] they're there if we could say they're a
[59:29] safety net
[59:31] they're everything we have need of to
[59:33] keep us safe today
[59:35] but it's not just the words printed on
[59:37] the bible or words spoken it's the
[59:38] spirit of god that is
[59:40] mixed in with that it's faith that takes
[59:42] a hold of that
[59:43] and puts it into action today lord so
[59:45] we're asking you to
[59:46] speak to our hearts have your own way
[59:50] lord if there's something in our lives
[59:51] right now as we just examine ourselves
[59:54] and say
[59:55] lord forgive me let me set that aside
[59:58] and let me listen hear and worship you
[1:00:01] in the name of jesus christ we ask you
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:05] you may be seated so
[1:00:08] we are so compassed about with many
[1:00:12] witnesses you know there's witnesses
[1:00:15] for both sides and sometimes
[1:00:18] if we're not careful who we get
[1:00:20] listening to
[1:00:22] what we pay attention to you know
[1:00:25] some people see something same thing you
[1:00:27] say and they get a different picture of
[1:00:28] it
[1:00:29] maybe they saw it from a slightly
[1:00:31] different angle or something
[1:00:33] that's why when there's a scene of an
[1:00:35] accident a crime or something they'll
[1:00:36] try they'll canvas the whole area and
[1:00:38] try to get all the witnesses
[1:00:40] to try to build a story that is accurate
[1:00:42] to try to try to determine
[1:00:45] because in in the scene of an accident
[1:00:49] and and we'll say both of them that were
[1:00:51] involved in the accident
[1:00:53] and nobody was seriously injured they
[1:00:54] get out both are waiting or wanting to
[1:00:58] to bring their point you know
[1:01:02] and and a lot of times the blame to the
[1:01:04] other
[1:01:06] every once in a while you're running a
[1:01:07] situation and the person will get out
[1:01:09] and say it was all my fault
[1:01:11] that doesn't happen too often you know i
[1:01:14] i
[1:01:14] it just the way things go and and
[1:01:18] but they want to establish what happened
[1:01:20] by looking at it from every angle
[1:01:23] what did brother roberts see you know
[1:01:26] what did sister shirley see what was
[1:01:28] that and you build a story around that
[1:01:32] and in this book
[1:01:35] there's ezekiel there's isaiah
[1:01:38] there's zachariah there's matthew each
[1:01:41] one
[1:01:42] expressing what god did with him
[1:01:45] but all of it is true not a point of
[1:01:49] view in here that is contrary
[1:01:51] to the other because it's the word of
[1:01:54] god
[1:01:55] but it takes the spirit of god in your
[1:01:57] life to make it
[1:01:59] to make it come to pass to put all the
[1:02:01] or there wouldn't be so many groups and
[1:02:02] so many churches so many denominations
[1:02:05] who use this same bible and come up with
[1:02:07] a different idea
[1:02:09] yeah but we're compassed about with many
[1:02:12] witnesses
[1:02:15] and they're telling us let us lay aside
[1:02:17] those things
[1:02:21] someone that has crossed the finish line
[1:02:23] can turn around and look back and
[1:02:24] encourage those
[1:02:26] that are still coming on and said it's
[1:02:28] worth it all
[1:02:29] and then looking unto jesus the author
[1:02:32] and finisher of our faith
[1:02:35] the beginning and the end it's him
[1:02:38] through the whole time it's not okay
[1:02:41] brother robert you're starting
[1:02:44] and i'll hang around here till you get
[1:02:45] to the end let's see what happens
[1:02:47] no i said i'll be with you even in you
[1:02:50] to the very end
[1:02:51] what a promise we have and as
[1:02:54] as i was looking in before brother
[1:02:57] daniel left
[1:02:58] on sunday he had spoke to brother peter
[1:03:01] and asked him to minister on wednesday
[1:03:04] night myself sunday morning
[1:03:05] and brother lyle for this evening
[1:03:09] so we we spoke about that and got made
[1:03:11] preparations to that and
[1:03:12] and when you know you're coming to stand
[1:03:14] behind the pulpit
[1:03:17] take a deep breath and you say okay lord
[1:03:19] what is it you have
[1:03:20] and sometimes god has been dealing with
[1:03:22] you sometimes you feel empty
[1:03:25] you feel dry you know but it's it's a
[1:03:28] training for each one of us
[1:03:30] he never leaves you um brother
[1:03:34] matthew had asked he goes is there a
[1:03:36] song special today
[1:03:38] and i said well i haven't heard any i
[1:03:40] said but let me go out there and see
[1:03:42] and i know there are those that have
[1:03:44] told me you can call on me
[1:03:47] so sister martha happened to be walking
[1:03:48] by me
[1:03:50] and i said sister martha do you have a
[1:03:51] song special
[1:03:53] and she said your daughters asked me to
[1:03:55] sing
[1:03:56] so and go after them no but they had
[1:03:59] asked for that song
[1:04:00] i can trust jesus how do you know you
[1:04:04] can trust him
[1:04:07] somebody tell me how do you know you can
[1:04:08] trust them
[1:04:11] somebody want to volunteer and answer
[1:04:14] brother peter be through the bible
[1:04:18] but because he's never failed you right
[1:04:20] he's what he's come
[1:04:22] now did he come as soon as you asked not
[1:04:25] necessarily
[1:04:26] there may be some training but he's
[1:04:27] never left you
[1:04:29] but so he's looking unto the author
[1:04:32] and the finisher of our faith
[1:04:36] he began it he'll finish it jesus
[1:04:40] and then he says by my example
[1:04:44] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:04:46] endured the cross
[1:04:48] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:04:52] the right hand
[1:04:53] of the throne of god the same can be
[1:04:56] said of you
[1:04:57] one of these days and i believe it's
[1:05:00] soon and very soon
[1:05:02] well done thou good and faithful servant
[1:05:04] enter now
[1:05:05] brother branham says in the message my
[1:05:08] redeemer liveth
[1:05:11] i was thinking lord you know i just
[1:05:16] what what what would you have us speak
[1:05:18] and
[1:05:19] i was listening to the a portion of the
[1:05:23] service at
[1:05:24] of the youth convention they had over
[1:05:26] brother pruitt's and brother danny
[1:05:28] steeman was ministering and just a
[1:05:31] portion of a quote he read stuck in my
[1:05:33] mind so i looked it up
[1:05:36] so that kind of started the thought
[1:05:39] but it's hard sometimes to just keep it
[1:05:42] right there then yeah
[1:05:43] find something else and like how do you
[1:05:44] harness it all into one
[1:05:47] so i was studying and looking at some
[1:05:49] things and
[1:05:51] i told my wife i said my it started over
[1:05:53] there and now it's over here
[1:05:54] how how we get it but i i i read this
[1:05:57] quote this was on voice of god
[1:05:59] the the daily quote and i already knew
[1:06:02] where my heart was so
[1:06:04] i said now today just imagine that is
[1:06:07] present
[1:06:08] being here today if you'll begin to
[1:06:12] think on it
[1:06:13] and you'll begin to it'll draw them
[1:06:14] close
[1:06:16] you know if you come this morning
[1:06:18] thinking oh
[1:06:20] is he going to be here well he said he
[1:06:22] would
[1:06:23] why don't you take that and god you said
[1:06:25] you would
[1:06:26] therefore you will be you know he says
[1:06:30] being here today the lord jesus is in
[1:06:32] another world or another dimension
[1:06:34] right here today in form of spirit his
[1:06:36] spirit is blending in with our spirit
[1:06:39] our eyes can't see him he says because
[1:06:42] they are physical yet
[1:06:44] unless there was something happen that
[1:06:46] we could see vision he said
[1:06:48] but he is here just as visible
[1:06:51] just as real as he was the day that he
[1:06:55] spoke to mary
[1:06:56] at the grave or he met cleopas on his
[1:06:58] road to emmaus
[1:07:00] his presence is here he said where two
[1:07:03] or three are gathered in my name
[1:07:05] i will be there and god keeps his word
[1:07:10] so it can be filled with that felt with
[1:07:13] the inner charge
[1:07:14] that's on the inside of the human body
[1:07:16] called the new birth
[1:07:18] the soul has been magnetized unto him
[1:07:20] and once in a while
[1:07:22] once in a while he says when you let
[1:07:24] your mind be concentrated on him
[1:07:26] putting aside everything else
[1:07:30] and it sure is worth it isn't it when
[1:07:32] everything else can just be set aside
[1:07:34] and i know sometimes the the trouble of
[1:07:37] the day the things of the day
[1:07:39] we have to pay attention to him but he
[1:07:42] never
[1:07:42] leaves he doesn't say well while you're
[1:07:45] working i can't be there
[1:07:46] he says i'll be with you but there are
[1:07:48] some times it says you can just get your
[1:07:50] minds concentrated
[1:07:52] believing on him after a while something
[1:07:55] a reality
[1:07:57] you can feel something sweep over your
[1:07:59] being he goes
[1:08:00] that's the vindication of his
[1:08:03] resurrection
[1:08:05] so if you have that vindication of his
[1:08:07] resurrection which is in you then you
[1:08:10] know
[1:08:10] you've got a resurrection coming for
[1:08:12] yourself
[1:08:14] and you know sometimes there are dry
[1:08:15] spells sometimes there's hard times
[1:08:18] sometimes as i believe it was
[1:08:22] ezekiel looked over the valley of dry
[1:08:24] bones
[1:08:25] and god asked me can they live again
[1:08:29] and ezekiel did not say no way lord
[1:08:33] they're nothing but dry bones they're
[1:08:34] powdery they're dust
[1:08:36] he said you know lord
[1:08:39] get into a situation where not you can
[1:08:41] turn on say you know lord
[1:08:43] therefore i put it in your hands
[1:08:46] and and so we know that now the patmos
[1:08:48] vision and this is where the
[1:08:50] the quote the portion and uh when he
[1:08:53] started the thought from the patmos
[1:08:54] vision
[1:08:56] now you can't do any good until you
[1:08:59] first get in the spirit
[1:09:01] god can't use you he says all your
[1:09:04] efforts are in vain
[1:09:05] until you do it in the spirit first do
[1:09:07] it in the spirit
[1:09:08] if i will sing i will sing in the spirit
[1:09:11] if i'll pray
[1:09:12] said paul i'll pray in the spirit now we
[1:09:15] know when we come to church
[1:09:16] we're going to sing we're going to
[1:09:19] but what's the attitude in doing it
[1:09:22] when you can get into the right mode in
[1:09:24] the right spirit what a difference it
[1:09:25] makes
[1:09:26] i know for me it does sometimes you get
[1:09:28] here hurry sometimes you get here tired
[1:09:30] you're still carrying the thoughts of
[1:09:31] the day or
[1:09:32] and and some of it is it's natural you
[1:09:35] know uh
[1:09:36] driving down the road you just about get
[1:09:38] t-boned
[1:09:40] you don't say thank you lord i just
[1:09:42] about got t when praise god
[1:09:43] most of the time it's for the next five
[1:09:45] miles you're watching every intersection
[1:09:47] trade
[1:09:47] you know we were human he said but i
[1:09:50] will do it in the spirit
[1:09:51] and then if there is anything that comes
[1:09:53] to me that's any good it has to be
[1:09:55] revealed to me by the spirit
[1:09:57] and confirmed by the word or made
[1:10:00] manifest by the results it bears
[1:10:05] and that's a thought manifestation by
[1:10:07] the results
[1:10:09] that are being born what is showing what
[1:10:10] it is he says
[1:10:12] now like other words if i say jesus
[1:10:15] christ promised
[1:10:16] in his word that if we would that i
[1:10:18] would repent
[1:10:19] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:10:22] christ i shall receive the gift of the
[1:10:24] holy ghost
[1:10:25] the first thing for me to do is repent
[1:10:28] it's revealed to me that that's true
[1:10:30] then be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:10:32] christ then the result
[1:10:33] is i'll receive the holy ghost boy
[1:10:36] that's simple
[1:10:40] but is it really that easy sometimes but
[1:10:43] it's the word of god
[1:10:44] brother brand name is telling here's the
[1:10:46] key getting into that spirit
[1:10:49] into that attitude he says if i am sick
[1:10:52] and he promised me
[1:10:54] if i would believe and have the elders
[1:10:56] of the church anoint me in oil
[1:10:58] and pray over me the prayer of faith
[1:11:00] shall save the sick
[1:11:01] lord i believe i follow your
[1:11:03] instructions let the elders pray over me
[1:11:06] anoint me with oil that settles it just
[1:11:09] go on
[1:11:09] it's all it's all over oh you say
[1:11:14] you don't feel any better though jesus
[1:11:16] wasn't born when god swayed him from
[1:11:18] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:20] when he was when he was a lamb of god
[1:11:22] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:11:25] but in god's own mind it was already
[1:11:27] done
[1:11:29] let this mind that was in christ be in
[1:11:31] you
[1:11:33] god said it therefore it's settled
[1:11:36] let the peace the anchor that holds you
[1:11:39] firm settled in your
[1:11:40] there you say brother brother and those
[1:11:43] are just words
[1:11:44] yeah but if you'll let the spirit of god
[1:11:47] he'll bring him to live in you
[1:11:50] now the next quote
[1:11:56] i believe it's um
[1:12:02] did i second part of the the second
[1:12:04] patmos vision i believe it was
[1:12:07] or the next part of that i wasn't there
[1:12:10] neither
[1:12:10] neither was you but in god's book if our
[1:12:13] names were ever there
[1:12:15] it was put on before the foundation of
[1:12:17] the world
[1:12:18] when god says anything
[1:12:21] it has to take place so when you meet
[1:12:24] god's qualifications just remember
[1:12:26] god will manifest himself and take care
[1:12:29] of the rest of it
[1:12:30] it's not your job to bring it to pass
[1:12:33] you just do what god said to do
[1:12:35] he says and you just go ahead it is a
[1:12:38] finished work oh
[1:12:40] isn't that wonderful oh my think just
[1:12:43] tell god and god said you do this
[1:12:45] and all do this well if i go do this
[1:12:48] he's got to do that that's not being
[1:12:51] arrogant
[1:12:52] that's taking god at his word lord you
[1:12:55] said so
[1:12:56] therefore i'm going to stand on that
[1:13:00] and then just a portion from uh
[1:13:03] x exposure exposition of the of the
[1:13:06] seven church age from the position
[1:13:08] patmos vision and just portion of the
[1:13:09] same quote but just another portion
[1:13:12] revelations 1 10 i was on the spirit on
[1:13:14] the lord's day and here and i heard
[1:13:16] behind me a great voice as of trumpet i
[1:13:19] was in the spirit
[1:13:20] isn't that just beautiful my i love that
[1:13:23] you could just call those words
[1:13:25] the whole of the christian life
[1:13:30] you know if we're going to live as
[1:13:31] christians we have to be in his spirit
[1:13:34] john was not talking about being in his
[1:13:36] own spirit
[1:13:38] that would not have brought these
[1:13:40] visions it had to be the spirit of god
[1:13:43] it had to be the spirit of god it has to
[1:13:46] be the spirit of god
[1:13:47] with us too or all our efforts
[1:13:50] are in vain you know
[1:13:55] and as he continues on there's
[1:13:58] a catching on into the spirit there
[1:14:01] there
[1:14:02] all right now was in the spirit on the
[1:14:04] lord's day now remember the first thing
[1:14:06] you have to do is what get in the spirit
[1:14:09] how these revelations are ever going to
[1:14:11] come to you get in the spirit have you
[1:14:12] ever
[1:14:13] have you ever gone going to how are you
[1:14:16] going to get
[1:14:16] the holy ghost get in the spirit get in
[1:14:18] the spirit
[1:14:20] now watch how he just describes some of
[1:14:21] this when you was a sinner and you went
[1:14:23] to a dance
[1:14:24] you got in that spirit oh my you started
[1:14:26] clapping your hands and patting your
[1:14:28] feet and shin digging
[1:14:29] and throwing your hat on the floor and
[1:14:31] going round and round and acting silly
[1:14:34] it was in the spirit of it could you
[1:14:36] imagine a fella was that a dance
[1:14:38] was a dance fan going to the dance say
[1:14:40] well and you all having a pretty good
[1:14:42] time i suppose oh they say you're a waff
[1:14:44] oh wallflower just get out of here you
[1:14:47] know i don't know i've never been to the
[1:14:48] dance i don't know how they go there but
[1:14:51] i think that's a pretty good description
[1:14:52] of it there he says oh they say
[1:14:55] he says go to the ballgame now i've been
[1:14:57] to some ball game so i know that one
[1:14:59] at the ball game and somebody knocks a
[1:15:00] home run or something another set look
[1:15:02] and say well i guess that's pretty good
[1:15:06] you know and i'll just tell you
[1:15:08] something here
[1:15:09] my dad used to take us to go watch the
[1:15:11] baseball games he liked to watch
[1:15:12] baseball
[1:15:13] never went to the dodger stadium or
[1:15:15] anything like that but we'd go watch the
[1:15:16] games
[1:15:17] and things and um but dad liked to leave
[1:15:21] about the sixth inning to get out ahead
[1:15:22] of traffic
[1:15:24] and beat the traffic out because my dad
[1:15:26] wasn't all that injury he just took us
[1:15:29] he wasn't screaming and yelling and
[1:15:30] jumping and shouting on things
[1:15:32] dad just took us to watch the ball game
[1:15:34] over here brother brown's talking about
[1:15:36] something he says
[1:15:36] no you wouldn't be a baseball fan you
[1:15:38] wouldn't be a real
[1:15:40] you wouldn't be in the spirit of
[1:15:41] baseball when somebody knocks a home run
[1:15:43] you raise up and holler whew my wind
[1:15:45] knocks somebody's head off his head like
[1:15:47] that nobody says a word about it
[1:15:49] everybody's happy about it hey man you
[1:15:51] know
[1:15:53] then in the church when you get in the
[1:15:55] spirit raise up and holler glory
[1:15:57] hallelujah praise the lord and somebody
[1:15:58] turn around and say oh you holy roller
[1:16:01] he says i'm going to ask you a question
[1:16:04] if we're holy rollers because we do
[1:16:06] that then them's unholy rollers out
[1:16:09] there
[1:16:10] i'd rather be a holy roller wouldn't you
[1:16:12] than an unholy one
[1:16:14] my certainly the unholy rulers now he
[1:16:17] was
[1:16:18] in the spirit he got in the spirit then
[1:16:21] things began to take place
[1:16:25] you know when i've gone to a baseball
[1:16:26] game i'm going because
[1:16:28] i want to see the baseball game or when
[1:16:31] i've gone to whatever it is that you're
[1:16:32] going out to do or participate in
[1:16:34] or one you know if you're go i ran cross
[1:16:37] country in my
[1:16:38] my highest one of my high school years
[1:16:39] and i ran
[1:16:41] to hopefully win but usually within the
[1:16:45] first 500 yards i knew i wasn't going to
[1:16:47] win
[1:16:48] they were already halfway down there and
[1:16:49] i was barely starting
[1:16:51] but i participated to the best of my
[1:16:53] effort and i cheered with the team and
[1:16:55] congratulated those that ran because we
[1:16:57] were part
[1:16:58] of the team and being part of the dream
[1:17:01] there
[1:17:02] comes an encouragement there comes a a
[1:17:04] backing uh
[1:17:05] you know if if if you're out there
[1:17:06] running the race and your whole team
[1:17:08] says you know
[1:17:08] we'll come back to particularly we're
[1:17:09] going to go have lunch
[1:17:12] you'd be you'd feel deserted but if your
[1:17:14] your team is following you
[1:17:15] you're you're you're leading they're
[1:17:16] they're calling out they're calling your
[1:17:18] name they're encouraging you
[1:17:19] to keep on getting in the spirit of what
[1:17:23] the lord
[1:17:23] is doing today you know
[1:17:27] not what he did yesterday that is a good
[1:17:29] thing to read
[1:17:30] and enjoy and learn from
[1:17:33] but you got to have your experience
[1:17:35] today it's
[1:17:36] getting in that spirit so so i would say
[1:17:40] because we're compassed about
[1:17:43] with so many witnesses let us
[1:17:46] run that race that is set before us
[1:17:50] and then philippians chapter 1 verse 6
[1:17:55] he says being confident of this very
[1:17:57] thing
[1:17:58] that he which have begun a good work in
[1:18:01] you
[1:18:01] will perform it until the day of jesus
[1:18:05] christ
[1:18:06] he that began the good work so he began
[1:18:10] it
[1:18:10] he's going to finish it
[1:18:13] romans 8 11. and i know you've never
[1:18:16] heard any of these scriptures before
[1:18:18] they're all new to you but no it's the
[1:18:19] word of god
[1:18:21] he said but if the spirit of him that
[1:18:23] raised up jesus from the dead
[1:18:25] dwell in you he that raised up christ
[1:18:28] from the dead shall
[1:18:29] also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:18:32] his spirit that dwelleth in you and
[1:18:35] brother branham says until you get into
[1:18:37] that spirit which is the spirit of god
[1:18:39] which he
[1:18:39] identifies the holy ghost in your life
[1:18:42] he said then these things can't begin to
[1:18:44] happen
[1:18:45] emotions yes excitement yes good
[1:18:49] feelings yes but a resurrection without
[1:18:51] the holy ghost no
[1:18:56] there's a big difference in the two the
[1:18:58] holy spirit brings that excitement it
[1:19:00] brings that joy it brings that
[1:19:02] worship and praise it brings all of that
[1:19:06] but then so do a lot of other things if
[1:19:09] i eat some good food
[1:19:10] i get pretty excited about it if i have
[1:19:13] a
[1:19:14] brother arnie was out here with some of
[1:19:16] that what is it kombucha water
[1:19:18] and he's talking about it there's some
[1:19:19] good things about it but that's not
[1:19:21] going to get me out of the grave
[1:19:24] there's only one thing that's going to
[1:19:25] get you out of the grave and that is the
[1:19:26] holy ghost the spirit of christ in you
[1:19:29] but those things that god allows us to
[1:19:31] do during while we're here on earth
[1:19:32] i thank him for that i thank him for the
[1:19:35] fellowship with friends
[1:19:36] and brothers and sisters and the
[1:19:38] different things that we get to do
[1:19:41] but i'm not going to be able to hook on
[1:19:42] to brother
[1:19:44] lyle's arm and say take me with you it's
[1:19:46] got to be in me also
[1:19:50] so he says if that same spirit that
[1:19:52] raised him from the dead it's going to
[1:19:54] react the same way
[1:19:56] now let's kind of look into where we
[1:19:57] were we're talking about being in this
[1:19:59] spirit revelations chapter 1
[1:20:02] we'll read verses 1 and 2 and 9 and 10.
[1:20:08] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:20:11] gave unto him
[1:20:12] it's god unveiling himself
[1:20:16] when god begins to reveal himself to you
[1:20:20] he begins to unveil himself show who he
[1:20:23] is
[1:20:24] not just words in a book
[1:20:29] but the life the one that wrote it
[1:20:32] giving you what he meant the the emotion
[1:20:36] the feeling of it the the part of it
[1:20:39] you know you could take something and
[1:20:40] just read it plain
[1:20:42] you know and i'll try to do it that way
[1:20:45] it's kind of hard
[1:20:46] now i beseech you brethren by the lord
[1:20:48] jesus christ's sake
[1:20:49] and for the love of the spirit that you
[1:20:51] strive together with me
[1:20:53] in your prayers to god for me amen
[1:20:58] it's still the word of god but i sounded
[1:21:00] like a robot a bad one at that but a
[1:21:02] robot
[1:21:04] but if i could say with some experience
[1:21:06] now my brothers
[1:21:08] he says you know listen to this
[1:21:11] being confident of this prayer there's
[1:21:13] something about that becomes life in you
[1:21:16] and you want to share it you want to
[1:21:18] express it not just in the words but the
[1:21:20] very life we live
[1:21:22] so here he says the revelation of jesus
[1:21:24] christ which god gave unto him
[1:21:27] to show unto his servants things which
[1:21:30] must shortly come to pass
[1:21:32] and he sent and signified them by his
[1:21:34] angel
[1:21:35] unto his servant john god himself
[1:21:37] unveiling himself
[1:21:39] that's what he was doing who bear record
[1:21:42] of the word of god
[1:21:43] and of the testimony of jesus christ and
[1:21:45] of all the things he saw now you know
[1:21:47] john was in the
[1:21:48] isle of patmos but john didn't know
[1:21:51] that's why he was going to the isle of
[1:21:53] patmos
[1:21:55] john hadn't read the book yet because
[1:21:56] and been written
[1:21:58] you and i have gotten to read it we've
[1:22:00] gotten to know
[1:22:01] but john is going because he's being
[1:22:04] persecuted for the gospel of jesus
[1:22:07] christ
[1:22:08] and god allowed that to get john to the
[1:22:11] isle of patmos
[1:22:12] so that he could pen these words that
[1:22:15] you and i would have today
[1:22:19] so some of the things even as brother
[1:22:21] jeremy prayed some of the things that we
[1:22:22] go through in the hard times
[1:22:24] god is allowing those things for a
[1:22:26] reason
[1:22:27] now sometimes we bring them on ourselves
[1:22:31] you know if we too late at night we
[1:22:34] don't feel good
[1:22:36] if we go too long without drinking water
[1:22:38] we don't feel good
[1:22:40] and we learned that hey we've got to
[1:22:42] want take some precautions
[1:22:44] we've got to do those things but god is
[1:22:45] mindful of us anyways
[1:22:47] he'll get our attention you know i i go
[1:22:50] into
[1:22:51] the homeowners and do things like that
[1:22:53] and the first thing most of them do is
[1:22:54] offer me water
[1:22:55] can i give you some water especially in
[1:22:57] arizona
[1:22:58] you know especially in this time of the
[1:23:00] year so the things that
[1:23:02] god is the same way with us he reminds
[1:23:04] us he tells us
[1:23:06] he says son daughter you know you're
[1:23:08] running a little bit low there but i've
[1:23:10] got plenty to give you
[1:23:12] he says you know so so here we're
[1:23:15] looking at he says
[1:23:16] john is in there for a reason
[1:23:20] versus the next two verses there
[1:23:25] i was eight nine and ten
[1:23:28] i john i'm also your brother
[1:23:32] and companion and tribulation i'm not
[1:23:35] any more than you
[1:23:36] i'm not any less than you because i
[1:23:38] stand behind the pulpit because i play
[1:23:40] the piano because i do this
[1:23:42] i'm your brother in tribulation i'm your
[1:23:46] sister
[1:23:46] we're in this together john says and in
[1:23:49] the kingdom and the patience of jesus
[1:23:50] christ
[1:23:51] was in the aisle that is called patmos
[1:23:54] for the word of god
[1:23:56] and for the testimony of jesus christ
[1:23:58] and then he says this
[1:23:59] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:24:02] and heard behind me
[1:24:04] a great voice as of a trumpet
[1:24:07] he had to be on the isle of patmos
[1:24:10] to get in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:24:13] and sometimes we have to say lord
[1:24:16] i need to get a place a quiet place away
[1:24:19] from all the commotion
[1:24:20] away from anything so i can get in to
[1:24:23] the spirit and concentrate
[1:24:24] on some things you have for me so
[1:24:28] if you go back and look into the things
[1:24:30] that brother branham says
[1:24:31] about being in the spirit on the lord's
[1:24:34] day
[1:24:35] in one place he called the lord's day
[1:24:37] sunday
[1:24:39] but he also called the lord say the day
[1:24:41] that god comes and visits you and is in
[1:24:44] your heart
[1:24:45] you were in that time in his
[1:24:48] now we we time we take him we put the
[1:24:51] word day and the bible use it too
[1:24:53] because we're creatures of time but when
[1:24:56] you get into what god is doing
[1:24:58] there is no time it's eternal
[1:25:01] god does is not bound by time nor limits
[1:25:04] god doesn't have to look at his watch
[1:25:06] and i got seven minutes for brother
[1:25:08] merle and that's all today
[1:25:10] no god says it's eternal i've got
[1:25:12] eternity with brother mural
[1:25:14] and he brings things to pass so john is
[1:25:17] saying i was in the spirit on the lord
[1:25:18] brother brahm says that
[1:25:20] but then he ties this and there were so
[1:25:22] many quotes i would have read 20 quotes
[1:25:24] to get to that
[1:25:25] where brother branham said the lord's
[1:25:26] getting in the lord's day is getting
[1:25:28] into the holy ghost
[1:25:29] getting into the spirit of christ being
[1:25:31] filled with the holy ghost
[1:25:33] being in that same that same frequency
[1:25:36] being in that same
[1:25:37] being tuned in the same station however
[1:25:39] you want to put it
[1:25:40] get it and sometimes we wonder why am i
[1:25:42] not getting a response why does it seem
[1:25:44] so hard
[1:25:45] let's look and see what where what maybe
[1:25:48] what day we're in if i could say it that
[1:25:49] way
[1:25:50] what's troubling me what's god what's
[1:25:52] got my mind he says
[1:25:56] now it made me think of something
[1:26:00] and the word was strive and
[1:26:04] and there's there's a definition of
[1:26:06] strive
[1:26:07] or should i say cinnamon synonyms
[1:26:10] cinnamon well not quite synonyms
[1:26:16] for strive to endeavor
[1:26:19] to labor even to strain or to struggle
[1:26:23] to sweat and toil to travail
[1:26:27] to tug to work to strive
[1:26:30] it's an effort involved it just doesn't
[1:26:33] happen i'm gonna sit on this rock
[1:26:35] rocking chair until the striped spirit
[1:26:37] strikes me
[1:26:39] no you're seeking you're looking you're
[1:26:42] anticipating you're working
[1:26:44] to get into that and i want to tithe as
[1:26:46] a striving to get into the spirit of god
[1:26:50] because if you go to genesis chapter one
[1:26:53] and we'll see how it started in the
[1:26:55] beginning
[1:26:58] genesis chapter one we'll read verses
[1:27:00] one to three
[1:27:03] and it says in the beginning god created
[1:27:05] the heavens
[1:27:06] and the earth simple
[1:27:09] a statement truth a lot happened
[1:27:13] in the very first scripture of the bible
[1:27:16] how much time i don't know could have
[1:27:18] been eternity not eternities it could be
[1:27:20] not eons and eons of time
[1:27:22] but in the beginning god created the
[1:27:24] heavens earth
[1:27:25] and the earth was without form and void
[1:27:29] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:27:30] deep
[1:27:32] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[1:27:35] face of the waters
[1:27:38] so how did god first begin to move
[1:27:42] with his spirit he said
[1:27:46] and god said let there be light
[1:27:49] and there was light i appreciate the
[1:27:52] fact that when god says something
[1:27:54] it's what it is let me just let me just
[1:27:57] read something here that they found
[1:28:00] at the air god said let there be light
[1:28:03] and there was light
[1:28:05] god did not create darkness
[1:28:08] but the darkness was there because there
[1:28:10] was no light yet
[1:28:13] but he settled out there see the spirit
[1:28:14] of god was the first
[1:28:16] mover it began to work it began to brood
[1:28:19] and begin to
[1:28:20] he moved upon the face of waters as a
[1:28:23] hand gathereth her chicken under her
[1:28:25] wings and hovers over them
[1:28:27] to warm and cherish them as the eagle
[1:28:29] stirs
[1:28:30] up on her nest and flutter through young
[1:28:32] that was the same wording that was used
[1:28:35] in there for these
[1:28:36] it's god's moving over his children
[1:28:40] just like he said let there be
[1:28:43] light
[1:28:46] and if we go down and now we know we can
[1:28:48] go all that god began to create god
[1:28:50] began to bring to pass
[1:28:52] and we don't know the amount of time
[1:28:54] that happened and again we're working in
[1:28:56] time here
[1:28:57] when god said let there be light to when
[1:28:59] light first came
[1:29:01] but it did come you know when god
[1:29:04] speaks it happens but it has its
[1:29:07] appointed time you know
[1:29:08] for us it has an appointed time okay
[1:29:11] so we know for that through the next
[1:29:13] five chapters from one
[1:29:14] going into chapter six is the the the
[1:29:17] story of the creation the unveiling and
[1:29:18] even
[1:29:19] the the adam and eve coming the fall and
[1:29:21] everything going
[1:29:23] but watch what happens now here in
[1:29:25] chapter 6
[1:29:26] and we'll go chapter 6 of genesis
[1:29:30] 1 and 1-3 also here we'll read those
[1:29:33] and it came to pass when men began to
[1:29:35] multiply on the face of the earth and
[1:29:37] daughters were born unto them
[1:29:39] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[1:29:41] of men that were
[1:29:42] fair that they were fair and they took
[1:29:45] upon them wives
[1:29:46] of all which they chose verse 3.
[1:29:53] and the lord said my spirit will not
[1:29:55] always strive with man
[1:29:58] for that he is also flesh yet his day
[1:30:01] shall be 120 years and that's where i
[1:30:04] tie the two
[1:30:05] my spirit shall not always strive with
[1:30:08] me
[1:30:10] there comes a time i believe when god
[1:30:12] says if you're not going to listen
[1:30:14] then i'm going to let you go you're
[1:30:16] going to go learn this on your own
[1:30:19] but he also tells us to strive
[1:30:24] press you know press into that kingdom
[1:30:28] of god
[1:30:28] work your way in not by works but
[1:30:32] in the sense of the flesh it is a
[1:30:34] struggle for us pray without ceasing
[1:30:37] sing songs as as we begin to sing
[1:30:40] alleluia and brother man just says
[1:30:42] acapella something about that song
[1:30:44] begins to work in you
[1:30:46] giving praise and the atmosphere changes
[1:30:50] but maybe it takes two or three times of
[1:30:52] singing it before you find anything
[1:30:54] there it is and then you can go from
[1:30:57] there to what a friend
[1:30:59] we have in jesus but you begin to create
[1:31:01] you begin to strive you begin to work
[1:31:02] because sometimes you come to service
[1:31:04] you've had to battle you've had to work
[1:31:07] through something
[1:31:08] maybe you were just about hearing a
[1:31:09] phone call and you got some bad news and
[1:31:10] now that
[1:31:11] so now you've got to set your heart and
[1:31:13] attitude so he said my spirit will not
[1:31:15] always strive with men i will not always
[1:31:17] tug on and pull on them strive with them
[1:31:20] you know yet he's god
[1:31:24] if you go back to genesis before this
[1:31:27] and he tells cain he says
[1:31:28] if you had done as your brother adam did
[1:31:31] you would be received
[1:31:33] he's a god of mercy he's a god of love
[1:31:37] but there's a time that i think he just
[1:31:39] says okay go learn on your own
[1:31:42] if you're not going to you're going to
[1:31:43] come
[1:31:45] it's just easier to come sometimes than
[1:31:47] to have to go through
[1:31:49] some of the things we put ourselves but
[1:31:52] again he says my spirit will not always
[1:31:54] strive with men
[1:31:56] for he is also flesh and his days shall
[1:31:58] be 120 years see this was not so in the
[1:32:00] beginning
[1:32:02] when he put adam and eve there in the
[1:32:04] garden of eden
[1:32:06] there was no striving there there was no
[1:32:09] flesh quote unquote there until the fall
[1:32:13] it it's i don't we can't really even
[1:32:16] imagine it
[1:32:17] to understand what it was like we can
[1:32:20] read about it we can hear about even
[1:32:21] brother branham talks about it
[1:32:23] when he's trying to explain after time
[1:32:26] he's trying to tell us in words what it
[1:32:28] was like
[1:32:29] and he says oh there's just not words to
[1:32:31] express that
[1:32:32] just don't miss it
[1:32:36] what is it the proof of the pudding is
[1:32:39] in the eating thereof
[1:32:41] you know it's good it's good it's good
[1:32:44] well
[1:32:44] find out is it good take a spoonful of
[1:32:48] it find out for yourself
[1:32:51] so galatians chapter 3
[1:32:55] verses 2 to 3 here 2-3
[1:32:59] this is paul speaking and paul tells us
[1:33:04] this only what i learned of you receive
[1:33:06] thee the spirits by the work
[1:33:08] of the law or by the hearing
[1:33:12] of faith are ye so
[1:33:15] foolish the word foolish
[1:33:18] do you really believe you can save
[1:33:20] yourself
[1:33:23] do you really believe you can earn your
[1:33:25] way to heaven
[1:33:27] do you really believe that there's a
[1:33:28] certain amount of good things you can do
[1:33:30] and therefore you earn that next
[1:33:32] medal the next award that next gold star
[1:33:35] he says
[1:33:36] are ye so foolish having begun in the
[1:33:39] spirit
[1:33:41] are you now made perfect in the flesh by
[1:33:43] the flesh
[1:33:45] paul says where did you begin what
[1:33:48] started this work in your life
[1:33:51] well it was my mother my father that
[1:33:53] prayed for me amen
[1:33:54] thank god for that but that was the work
[1:33:56] of the spirit
[1:33:58] that was god beginning to do what makes
[1:34:01] you think now you can work your way
[1:34:04] into heaven now do we throw out works no
[1:34:09] works is your appreciation back to god
[1:34:12] your love for him
[1:34:14] and in a sense you could say i owe it to
[1:34:17] him yes you owe him your all
[1:34:19] but this gift is freely given gift
[1:34:23] it's so hard sometimes i say something
[1:34:26] to receive a gift
[1:34:27] with grace because immediately you feel
[1:34:30] i
[1:34:31] owe back they were nice to me
[1:34:34] i got it and you should want to but a
[1:34:37] gift is given because someone desires to
[1:34:40] give the gift
[1:34:43] yeah but we feel obligated immediately
[1:34:47] this is the month of birthdays the next
[1:34:49] two months in our family there's five
[1:34:50] birthdays
[1:34:52] and it starts getting talked about at
[1:34:54] the beginning of the year oh no we've
[1:34:56] got the two expensive months coming up
[1:34:58] you know the gifts this mom's gonna
[1:35:01] mommy tells them what would you like to
[1:35:02] eat i'll make that
[1:35:03] and and the girls with each other it's
[1:35:05] just part of it
[1:35:07] rachel's was yesterday sarah's next week
[1:35:10] the following week is my wife's three
[1:35:12] weeks later is abby's and the week after
[1:35:14] that is naomi's
[1:35:16] so we'll work until we get enough to pay
[1:35:18] for it now
[1:35:20] um it's a part of that but then we begin
[1:35:22] as we do one we begin to plan the next
[1:35:24] one plan
[1:35:25] it's part of it but he said i give you
[1:35:27] freely
[1:35:28] nothing is owed back you can't
[1:35:32] earn this but you can show your
[1:35:35] appreciating your
[1:35:36] appreciation and your love back to you
[1:35:40] and show the work of grace that he's
[1:35:42] done in you by how you treat others
[1:35:45] by how you will live your life but how
[1:35:47] you react to the situations
[1:35:49] god you've been so good to me you've
[1:35:51] been so
[1:35:52] so merciful to me i didn't deserve any
[1:35:54] of this goodness
[1:35:55] i was worthy of hell but you saved me
[1:35:58] you loved me
[1:35:59] so therefore would you extend that mercy
[1:36:01] through me to somebody else
[1:36:03] and i would reach out and say come my
[1:36:05] brother come my sister
[1:36:07] come go with me to the house to this
[1:36:09] place
[1:36:10] because i love the lord but those aren't
[1:36:13] works
[1:36:13] those are appreciations of god's grace
[1:36:16] we have to be careful what works become
[1:36:18] in our life and here he says
[1:36:19] have you now been made perfect in the
[1:36:21] flesh
[1:36:23] we have to be careful with that finding
[1:36:25] the balance of that
[1:36:27] brother brown says you can never pray
[1:36:29] enough
[1:36:32] so that means if you prayed 24 hours a
[1:36:35] day
[1:36:35] you could never pray enough now watch
[1:36:39] he's just telling you to watch that
[1:36:41] spirit
[1:36:42] he's not telling you to stop praying in
[1:36:45] fact he says the scripture tells us
[1:36:47] pray always pray without ceasing
[1:36:50] but don't base your salvation on how
[1:36:52] much you pray
[1:36:55] because we would be lost because there
[1:36:58] are people that pray
[1:36:59] a whole lot more than i do
[1:37:03] they pray constantly
[1:37:06] but a attitude of our heart should be
[1:37:09] in god i have put my trust
[1:37:13] now so he says your works
[1:37:16] treating one another there are things
[1:37:18] that we should do
[1:37:19] already but we're not
[1:37:23] noting them we're not counting them
[1:37:24] there's not a tally book
[1:37:27] the only thing that brother branham saw
[1:37:30] when the book was open was the blood
[1:37:34] that said nothing is held against you
[1:37:39] nothing sister grace
[1:37:42] peterson nothing is held against you
[1:37:45] because the
[1:37:46] blood is there for you
[1:37:49] but on the bottom in parentheses but
[1:37:51] sister grace played the organ 4
[1:37:53] 528 hours when she was here so therefore
[1:37:56] she gets about
[1:37:56] no the blood that jesus shed
[1:38:02] thank god for that thank god for that
[1:38:06] take a moment to thank god for that
[1:38:07] right now say thank you lord jesus for
[1:38:09] your grace for the blood that was shed
[1:38:11] for me
[1:38:14] paul tells us have you come have you or
[1:38:18] is it the spirit of god that works in
[1:38:20] you
[1:38:24] timothy chapter 2 verses 4 and 5.
[1:38:29] now look here and we won't be too much
[1:38:31] longer here
[1:38:34] no man that worth entangleth himself
[1:38:36] with the affairs of this life
[1:38:40] brother eddie when you were going
[1:38:41] through training it was just like from
[1:38:44] eight to eleven then you had two hours
[1:38:46] on your own and then from
[1:38:48] one to four and then the rest it was
[1:38:49] your time right
[1:38:51] oh armies changed so brother
[1:38:54] matt they pretty well owned you didn't
[1:38:56] they kind of
[1:38:58] told you where to go and how many of you
[1:39:00] have served in the military here
[1:39:05] there's a few should i fortunate or
[1:39:07] unfortunate ones i don't know how you
[1:39:08] want to look at that but thank you
[1:39:10] but but but you give yourself to that
[1:39:13] when he signed
[1:39:14] the dotted line now he may not know
[1:39:17] everybody could have told him what it
[1:39:19] was going to be like but he had to go
[1:39:20] experience that himself
[1:39:22] now again no man that worth
[1:39:26] entangles himself with the affairs of
[1:39:28] this life
[1:39:29] that he may please him who have chosen
[1:39:32] him
[1:39:33] to be a soldier
[1:39:36] it's kind of funny that god chooses some
[1:39:38] to be a soldier doesn't he
[1:39:41] everyone has a part he says everyone who
[1:39:43] serves as a soldier keeps himself from
[1:39:46] becoming
[1:39:46] entangled in this world's business
[1:39:50] so that he may satisfy the officer
[1:39:54] who enlisted him
[1:39:58] now joshua says are you
[1:40:02] for us or are you against us took out
[1:40:04] his sword
[1:40:06] and says we've walked into a land that
[1:40:08] we're taking over
[1:40:09] but i don't know whose side you're on he
[1:40:10] says i'm the captain of the host
[1:40:13] he is the one who enlisted you the
[1:40:16] captain
[1:40:17] of the host i'll be with you
[1:40:20] even in you he said i'm the lord that
[1:40:22] keepeth thee that fighteth all your
[1:40:24] battles
[1:40:25] he says so no men and i just like the
[1:40:28] way this was said everyone who serves as
[1:40:29] a soldier
[1:40:31] every one of us keeps himself from
[1:40:34] becoming entangled in this world's
[1:40:36] business but it's hard sometimes
[1:40:40] the the the things that are going on
[1:40:42] around you the news that that you hear
[1:40:44] the the situation work or whatever it
[1:40:47] might be
[1:40:49] he says so that he may satisfy because
[1:40:52] who
[1:40:52] are we pleasing one another
[1:40:55] no him but in pleasing him
[1:40:59] we please one another we serve one
[1:41:01] another we love one another
[1:41:03] i think they taught you that i think no
[1:41:06] no
[1:41:06] if i heard right you were the only one
[1:41:08] there right
[1:41:10] the whole place was empty no there was
[1:41:11] people you were part of an army
[1:41:13] you were part of a group you ran
[1:41:15] together you marched together you did
[1:41:16] everything together
[1:41:18] you were there if your buddy fell you
[1:41:20] were there to help to pick him up
[1:41:22] you weren't you weren't supposed to kick
[1:41:24] him right shoot him he's no good
[1:41:26] no we're here together i didn't know you
[1:41:29] were going to be here i
[1:41:30] didn't even know these scriptures were
[1:41:31] there for you or for us
[1:41:33] i didn't know he had come yet but we
[1:41:36] don't entangle ourselves we don't get
[1:41:37] caught up
[1:41:38] i would go help you but i don't have
[1:41:39] time i'd go help you but i'm too busy in
[1:41:41] this
[1:41:42] i'm old no he said don't get entangled
[1:41:45] in those things
[1:41:47] and he said in verse 5 and if a man who
[1:41:50] strive again
[1:41:51] who pushes who pursues who endeavors who
[1:41:53] labors
[1:41:56] for masteries yet is not he not
[1:42:00] crowned except he strive lawfully
[1:42:04] i did a little bit of the looking at
[1:42:06] this as this was paul's writing
[1:42:08] we know paul was in rome we know all of
[1:42:10] that and and the
[1:42:11] um what do they call it the world games
[1:42:15] and all that that we do today come away
[1:42:16] from way back then
[1:42:18] those competitions and paul looked down
[1:42:19] and he said the one that's running in
[1:42:21] that race
[1:42:23] the one that's participating in the
[1:42:24] javelin throw the
[1:42:26] there are rules and there are things
[1:42:27] that they set they're supposed to do if
[1:42:29] you ever watch any of the competitions
[1:42:30] uh
[1:42:31] the hammer throw or whatever it might be
[1:42:33] uh the
[1:42:34] the sprints there's lanes that they run
[1:42:36] there's a starting time
[1:42:38] if they jump the gun they start it over
[1:42:40] i think if they do it twice they get
[1:42:41] disqualified
[1:42:43] there's rules and things that you set
[1:42:45] there because
[1:42:46] so he says and if a man strived for
[1:42:48] mastery
[1:42:49] yet is not crowned except he strived
[1:42:53] lawfully
[1:42:55] or in a simplex way to say if a man take
[1:42:58] part in a competition he does not get
[1:43:00] the crown
[1:43:01] if he has not kept the rules
[1:43:05] i remember i think it was a new york
[1:43:07] marathon
[1:43:09] and there was a girl that had supposedly
[1:43:12] won the race
[1:43:14] but she only ran the last 10 miles of
[1:43:17] the race
[1:43:18] she kind of slid in and started running
[1:43:22] but there was so many people who came up
[1:43:25] and said wait a minute we never saw her
[1:43:27] run by the first part of the race
[1:43:31] and they found out she had not kept the
[1:43:33] rules
[1:43:34] she was not the winner there are those
[1:43:37] that have run and i've seen it i ran
[1:43:38] cross country they had a marked course
[1:43:41] when you ran we would go run in a new a
[1:43:43] new another school
[1:43:45] and you never run before you kind of
[1:43:48] asked the other guys had run the air
[1:43:49] before how does this course run where
[1:43:50] does it go
[1:43:52] some of them were in a clear mark field
[1:43:54] you ran around the
[1:43:55] the the track others were through the
[1:43:57] streets and all over you didn't know
[1:43:59] where they go you had to know where to
[1:44:00] go
[1:44:02] you had you couldn't cut shorts you
[1:44:03] could you know well for one thing you
[1:44:05] could end up somewhere you didn't even
[1:44:07] know where you were at
[1:44:08] so you stayed you followed there was a
[1:44:10] course there was a run there was a track
[1:44:12] set before you
[1:44:14] there's a life to live
[1:44:17] there's a race to be run this is what
[1:44:19] paul's saying
[1:44:20] but run it lawfully run it through by
[1:44:23] what the word of god says to do
[1:44:26] pray without ceasing love one another do
[1:44:29] those things that are
[1:44:30] part of this race
[1:44:33] because we strive we've worked hard with
[1:44:36] him
[1:44:38] and he doesn't you don't hear well done
[1:44:40] thou good and faithful servant
[1:44:44] now you're not striving or trying to
[1:44:46] earn your points
[1:44:47] to get there because he's already made
[1:44:50] the way
[1:44:51] but you're striving because you're part
[1:44:53] of him
[1:44:54] you have a representation to pull the
[1:44:57] spirit
[1:44:57] of god running and doing those things by
[1:45:00] the spirit of the lord
[1:45:03] now this is a whole body
[1:45:07] minus a toe and i tell this now
[1:45:11] i will continue to say it one of these
[1:45:14] days
[1:45:15] i'm going to look down and i'm going to
[1:45:16] have my toe back and i'm going to know
[1:45:18] the resurrection is on
[1:45:20] we're about ready to go home because i'm
[1:45:21] going whole i'm going back
[1:45:24] i'll be restored into a body that's
[1:45:26] holding complete
[1:45:27] yeah i can laugh about it because i know
[1:45:29] it's true
[1:45:30] i had somebody tell me how could you
[1:45:32] laugh about this
[1:45:34] surgery you went through how could you
[1:45:36] have such an attitude
[1:45:37] and i said it was either that moan and
[1:45:39] cry and be in despair
[1:45:40] and i chose not to do that now
[1:45:44] i've shared this we were we were in were
[1:45:46] there with the doctor after the surgery
[1:45:48] and
[1:45:49] and and the doctor looked at it and i'm
[1:45:50] looking at the doctor's face and
[1:45:52] my wife has got her phone with the video
[1:45:54] camera up and she's got it right over
[1:45:56] where the toe is cut the opening first
[1:45:57] time we're going to see it after it
[1:45:59] happened
[1:46:00] but i can't see it because of the
[1:46:01] position of the foot so i'm watching the
[1:46:03] doctor's face
[1:46:06] is his eyes and his face going to show
[1:46:09] an alarm
[1:46:10] then guess what's going to happen to me
[1:46:12] when i see that the same result
[1:46:15] but my wife is just right down there
[1:46:17] videoing it and taking pictures of it
[1:46:20] and he kind of stands up a little bit he
[1:46:23] looks at the nurse and he says my this
[1:46:26] is kind of amazing
[1:46:27] i'm looking at his face there's some
[1:46:28] amazement in there
[1:46:30] and i take this breath
[1:46:33] there's nothing wrong and he looks at me
[1:46:36] goes this looks
[1:46:37] very good he said in fact he said i
[1:46:40] really thought
[1:46:41] you're going back into the hospital back
[1:46:42] into surgery and you're going to get
[1:46:43] more surgery done
[1:46:45] he said but we're going to wrap it up
[1:46:46] we're going to let you rest today and
[1:46:47] we'll come and look at it again tomorrow
[1:46:50] the next morning he does the same thing
[1:46:52] again he opens it up and
[1:46:54] this time he stands straight because i
[1:46:56] don't believe that
[1:46:57] you're healing already two days after
[1:47:01] so then he asked me he says what do you
[1:47:03] do for a living
[1:47:05] i said well you know i'm on my feet a
[1:47:06] lot i do this and this and this i said
[1:47:08] but
[1:47:08] but i'm also serving as an intern pastor
[1:47:10] of a church right now
[1:47:12] and his words were oh that's the reason
[1:47:15] you had people praying for you
[1:47:17] that simple he goes that's the only
[1:47:18] explanation i got for that
[1:47:22] that's how the family of god works
[1:47:25] god so we're sitting there and
[1:47:29] in you know just go tell you how it was
[1:47:30] we're now in in you know for the week we
[1:47:32] were in there and the kids were there my
[1:47:34] wife different people come to visit
[1:47:36] and all and
[1:47:39] some were more worried about nervous
[1:47:42] about it than i was
[1:47:43] you know and some of them were just like
[1:47:45] me who my wife says can't you ever be
[1:47:47] serious
[1:47:48] you know so there was a brother sitting
[1:47:51] there and we're talking and he says you
[1:47:53] know brother aaron and
[1:47:54] this will make you laugh but he says you
[1:47:57] know that when we have communion and
[1:47:58] foot washing everybody's going to want
[1:48:00] to wash yours right
[1:48:03] i won't say john yarbrough's name honest
[1:48:07] i said why and he goes because you're
[1:48:09] going to have less to wash
[1:48:13] there was another brother and his wife
[1:48:14] sitting on this side and they
[1:48:16] got this look on their face how dare you
[1:48:20] and then after they left brother john
[1:48:21] goes that wasn't offensive was that
[1:48:24] i said no but it was expected you and i
[1:48:27] know each other
[1:48:28] you know when you know who god is
[1:48:34] when you've met him in the spirit on the
[1:48:36] lord's day
[1:48:38] the fear is gone
[1:48:41] it is because you can say though god
[1:48:44] slay me yet i'll trust him
[1:48:47] he's proven himself over and over and
[1:48:50] over
[1:48:50] how many times have i failed him but
[1:48:52] he's never failed me
[1:48:55] brother branham talks about that time
[1:48:57] and here's a man that had gone through
[1:48:59] many a hard lessons
[1:49:01] lost his wife and lost his baby because
[1:49:04] he listened to the voice of his
[1:49:06] mother-in-law
[1:49:08] you would have thought this is god's
[1:49:10] servant the prophet of god
[1:49:11] god would have struck his mother-in-law
[1:49:13] dead no brother branham had to learn
[1:49:15] had to pay that way and each one of us
[1:49:17] too whatever
[1:49:19] we've gone through we look back in our
[1:49:20] lives and we say oh lord that i had
[1:49:22] never done that
[1:49:23] oh lord that i had never said that oh i
[1:49:26] wish it but it had its reason
[1:49:28] and its purpose even if
[1:49:31] all the reason is for you to be able to
[1:49:33] say don't go that way
[1:49:36] i've been there and that's a hard way to
[1:49:37] go but you can put your
[1:49:40] your shoulder your arm around come on
[1:49:42] brother come on sister we can do this
[1:49:44] but to see it cost him everything
[1:49:48] until he finally said lord i'll
[1:49:50] surrender myself to you
[1:49:52] i'll do what you want me to do. he
[1:49:54] listened to the men
[1:49:56] in africa and it cost him his health
[1:49:59] for such a long time again you would
[1:50:02] have think god would have struck those
[1:50:04] men for lying to the prophet
[1:50:06] but no god has a reason why he puts you
[1:50:08] what he puts you through
[1:50:11] you say well i i i thought i deserve
[1:50:13] better
[1:50:14] but god knows what he's doing now watch
[1:50:18] when brother branham goes into that
[1:50:19] little restaurant
[1:50:20] and he talks about seeing that woman and
[1:50:22] that man and the
[1:50:24] policeman and he gets such an attitude
[1:50:29] that he goes he walks on he said god
[1:50:31] destroy them
[1:50:32] how can you stand that brother brandon
[1:50:36] was really justifying himself
[1:50:38] before god i'm much better than them
[1:50:41] not in the words but that was his action
[1:50:43] so what does god have to do he takes him
[1:50:45] in a vision and begins to show him
[1:50:47] directly
[1:50:48] what he looked like without the blood
[1:50:51] he said you would be no different
[1:50:54] because
[1:50:55] he said every one of your sins are
[1:50:57] coming up and bouncing
[1:50:58] off of me by the blood
[1:51:02] oh thank you lord praise god for his
[1:51:05] mercy
[1:51:06] and his grace so again we are here we're
[1:51:09] saying we're striving
[1:51:11] to stay under and into the spirit of god
[1:51:14] what are you doing today
[1:51:16] why are you moving this way lord what is
[1:51:18] it about which way do you want me to go
[1:51:22] this flesh is going to rebel but put it
[1:51:25] under subjection
[1:51:27] say no lord i yield to you i surrender
[1:51:31] you
[1:51:31] paul sits there and he says i could
[1:51:33] argue with you
[1:51:35] if you want to talk about the flesh have
[1:51:38] you earned this in the flesh
[1:51:39] is it by your works he said if you want
[1:51:41] to compare let's compare notes
[1:51:43] let's show all our degrees let's see
[1:51:46] your diplomas i've got some of the best
[1:51:48] i was trained i was born i was this
[1:51:51] but i've counted of no value whatsoever
[1:51:55] that i may gain
[1:51:58] christ
[1:52:01] paul says i'll strive for that i'll run
[1:52:04] the race
[1:52:04] lawfully i'll go by the again paul said
[1:52:08] the same thing
[1:52:08] lord lord three times i talked to god
[1:52:11] about this
[1:52:12] if you would do this for me i know i
[1:52:15] could serve
[1:52:16] you better lord because i know better
[1:52:19] than you obviously
[1:52:21] really think about it that's what paul
[1:52:23] is telling lord i could do a much better
[1:52:25] job than i'm doing right now if you'll
[1:52:27] do this
[1:52:28] and the lord goes no you couldn't i have
[1:52:32] this for a reason
[1:52:34] and sometimes we do that lord if you
[1:52:37] would make it go
[1:52:37] this way and this way i know that i
[1:52:39] could get these results
[1:52:41] i just know that lord and he's looking
[1:52:44] at really and then he says go
[1:52:46] and then you're sitting there a couple
[1:52:47] days later how did i get here lord where
[1:52:49] were you in all this he said you wanted
[1:52:51] to go you said you could figure it out
[1:52:54] oh precious jesus hold my hand
[1:52:58] let me trust in you always as the
[1:52:59] musicians would come up
[1:53:01] lord let me stay in the spirit on the
[1:53:03] lord's day
[1:53:04] and this is the day that the lord hath
[1:53:06] made i will rejoice
[1:53:08] what is god doing today it's wonderful
[1:53:12] to read about what he's done tomorrow
[1:53:13] because we get encouraged by
[1:53:15] the testimony and the joy of that and we
[1:53:17] know what we're looking for
[1:53:20] but i'm living today lord i need you
[1:53:22] right now
[1:53:25] in my life be glorified let's stand
[1:53:28] in my life be glorified as power hands
[1:53:34] lord take these words i believe you gave
[1:53:38] them to me lord
[1:53:41] if for nobody else they were for me say
[1:53:43] lord
[1:53:45] but let us yield ourselves in certainly
[1:53:46] lord we will never be made perfect in
[1:53:48] the flesh
[1:53:50] nor in the thoughts of our mind or
[1:53:52] sometimes our mind can just go
[1:53:54] to places where we wonder how we got
[1:53:56] there
[1:53:57] sometimes we're affected by that which
[1:53:59] we see
[1:54:02] we can get hurt we can get moved we can
[1:54:05] we can see something maybe interpret it
[1:54:07] wrong or
[1:54:08] catch the meaning that we thought it
[1:54:09] wasn't it wasn't
[1:54:11] and then we're offended and we're hurt
[1:54:13] lord
[1:54:14] but i feel that if if we'll let the
[1:54:17] spirit of god have preeminence in our
[1:54:19] lives
[1:54:20] the mind of christ brother branham said
[1:54:22] he's the holy spirit
[1:54:24] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:54:26] the one who wrote the book
[1:54:29] lord we can ask you what did you mean
[1:54:30] when you said this
[1:54:32] and you can interpret it and brother
[1:54:33] brahm says the prophet of god says
[1:54:36] you interpret it by bringing it to pass
[1:54:38] lord i don't understand how there can be
[1:54:40] peace in this situation how this boat is
[1:54:43] being tossed around but you said there's
[1:54:45] peace
[1:54:45] and he brings peace lord we send our
[1:54:48] into ourselves to you lord
[1:54:50] may we strive when we put an effort may
[1:54:53] we put a greater effort than we have
[1:54:56] to stay in that anointing of the mind of
[1:54:59] christ today lord
[1:55:01] we ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[1:55:18] be glorified
