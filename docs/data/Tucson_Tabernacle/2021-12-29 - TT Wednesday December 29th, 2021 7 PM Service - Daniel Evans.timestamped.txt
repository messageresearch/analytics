[23:27] she says please pray for my cousin
[23:30] michelle lujan
[23:31] she'll be having surgery tomorrow
[23:33] morning at 7 30.
[23:35] she's asking for a successful surgery
[23:37] and a healthy recovery
[23:39] she also thanks you for your prayers on
[23:41] her behalf these past few months
[23:44] so we want to keep that in prayer i was
[23:45] talking
[23:46] our brother daniel evans will be
[23:48] ministering for us this evening and i
[23:49] was just talking to him and he
[23:51] mentioned a prayer request some
[23:54] men that he met earlier today that are
[23:56] going through some difficult times and
[23:59] with their wives and so we want to
[24:01] remember them for
[24:02] the pain and and uh believe that the
[24:05] lord could heal the situation
[24:07] he could help them with uh whatever
[24:09] they're going through and their names
[24:11] are mark
[24:12] and david
[24:13] and jennifer and anna
[24:15] and so we want to just believe that the
[24:17] lord is mindful that need
[24:19] and if you have a need let's just
[24:22] stand and raise it up to the lord by
[24:24] faith
[24:25] believing that he knows about it
[24:27] [Music]
[24:31] lord jesus
[24:33] your word tells us that you're the high
[24:35] priest that can be touched by the
[24:36] feeling of our infirmities
[24:39] and lord we're told that you wept at the
[24:41] tomb of lazarus
[24:44] father you wept as a man but you
[24:47] spoke the words come forth and he came
[24:50] [Music]
[24:51] i believe that same resurrection power
[24:53] lord is
[24:55] tabernacled in these
[24:57] bodies of clay
[25:00] father forgive us where we've hindered
[25:03] you're moving lord by unbelief we know
[25:06] as we heard on sunday that
[25:09] unbelief doesn't hinder your
[25:11] your moving lord
[25:13] that you'll still have your way but lord
[25:15] we don't want to
[25:18] we don't want to slow you down at all
[25:19] and we don't want to kick against the
[25:21] pricks lord take away all unbelief from
[25:23] us
[25:24] all sin from our lives anything that
[25:26] would stand in the way of these prayers
[25:27] being answered father
[25:30] grant that we could just have testimony
[25:32] after testimony that
[25:35] you're the same yesterday today and
[25:37] forever lord
[25:39] that people would see you and see your
[25:41] moving lord that you would receive all
[25:43] the glory

[25:47] sister michelle
[25:50] it all would be well
[25:52] it helped the doctors and the nurses and
[25:54] everybody involved and just have mercy
[25:56] on her and bless her father
[26:00] pray for these ones lord
[26:02] mark and david and jennifer and anna for
[26:04] the needs that they have
[26:08] and for every knee lord that was
[26:09] unspoken
[26:11] or do you know it

[26:15] that you paid the price
[26:17] that it is finished at calvary lord help
[26:19] us

[33:34] to read anything into it
[33:36] but it sure did encourage me
[33:40] and uh what happened was i had just
[33:43] arrived in tucson
[33:46] and
[33:48] i uh i went to a gathering and it was
[33:51] this church
[33:53] and we were we were in a place that
[33:56] there was a courtyard it could have been
[33:57] here at the church

[34:04] sitting uh sitting in the courtyard in a
[34:06] chair
[34:07] and and she was
[34:09] very happy and everybody was just
[34:11] everyone was so happy
[34:13] and then i saw a brother aaron
[34:15] and aaron
[34:17] comes in and he was so excited and he
[34:20] looked and he looked so young he looked
[34:22] like he was about 25 years old
[34:24] black hair
[34:25] and uh i just admired him i thought nice
[34:28] a good looking guy you know and
[34:31] he was broad shoulders you know and and
[34:33] he came in and he was excited and he
[34:36] says he says i just witnessed to the
[34:38] church across the street and he said and
[34:41] to the apostolic church down the road
[34:43] and he said there's going to be people

[36:01] they just needed a little bit of hope
[36:02] and and then i woke up and so excited i
[36:06] couldn't wait till stephanie woke up to
[36:07] to tell her the dream and you know
[36:10] that next morning i said i had just i
[36:11] was so encouraged i had
[36:13] just the best dream so
[36:15] i'm encouraged and i'm just excited
[36:18] about the church i'm excited about
[36:20] tucson
[36:21] and like i said
[36:23] it may be nothing to it but it sure
[36:24] meant something to me
[36:29] so i'd like to talk about
[36:32] this
[36:34] great thing
[36:35] that happened with joshua now joshua was
[36:39] with moses
[36:42] all these years
[36:43] 40 years in the wilderness
[36:46] and all those old fighters had passed
[36:49] away and the problems when they were out
[36:51] in the wilderness wilderness wandering
[36:53] around for 40 years
[36:55] back and forth and
[36:56] the geographic area that they were in
[36:58] was fairly small
[37:00] you could you could walk across it and
[37:02] many times in a few days or even shorter
[37:05] so they they were they were going around
[37:08] and i would assume that they were fairly
[37:11] discouraged
[37:13] moses
[37:14] went up on the mountain
[37:17] and went to be with the lord
[37:19] joshua
[37:21] i was there
[37:23] and
[37:24] it was a time as you know the story that
[37:27] that the jordan river
[37:29] which separated where they were at from
[37:32] the land that was promised
[37:34] to abraham we call it the promised land
[37:38] and they knew that they were given this
[37:39] land
[37:41] but they wandered around and finally
[37:43] they come to this time and they come to
[37:46] that jordan river that separated them
[37:49] from the promised land and it was a
[37:52] flood
[37:53] as we know
[37:55] and it's such a such a strange time for
[37:58] god to lead the people to that jordan
[38:01] river
[38:03] at that time of year many times that's
[38:05] what god does
[38:06] and he does these things
[38:08] we say
[38:10] to show his glory
[38:12] he led he led them to the red sea
[38:15] the red sea parted
[38:17] and they went through
[38:18] and then
[38:20] now the same thing happens and they get
[38:23] to the jordan river now i want to read
[38:27] a lengthy
[38:29] quote from the bible you know brother
[38:32] branham said that we can say
[38:34] we can say things wrong and we can do
[38:36] things wrong but every service is a
[38:39] success if we read this wonderful book
[38:44] so i want to i want to read a lengthy
[38:46] a lengthy segment out of joshua we'll
[38:48] start with joshua 1 1
[38:50] and and we'll go through
[38:53] these scriptures
[38:54] just to lay a foundation
[38:57] to uh to the scripture that i read at
[38:59] the beginning of the service joshua 1 1
[39:02] now after the death of moses the servant
[39:04] of the lord it came to pass that the
[39:06] lord spake unto joshua the son of nun
[39:09] moses is minister now that word minister
[39:11] means servant
[39:13] moses is minister saying moses my
[39:15] servant is dead
[39:17] now therefore arise and go over this
[39:19] jordan thou and all this people under
[39:21] the land which i do give them even
[39:24] to the children of israel
[39:26] every place that the soul of your foot
[39:29] shall tread upon that have i given you
[39:31] as i said unto moses amen
[39:34] from the wilderness
[39:35] and this lebanon even unto the great
[39:38] river the river euphrates and all the
[39:40] land of the hittites and unto the great
[39:42] sea
[39:43] toward the going down of the sun shall
[39:46] be your coast
[39:47] and there shall not be any man be able
[39:50] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[39:52] life
[39:52] as i was with moses so i will be with
[39:56] thee i will not fail thee nor forsake
[39:59] thee
[40:00] be strong and of good courage for unto
[40:03] this people shall thou divide for an
[40:06] inheritance the land which i swear unto
[40:08] their fathers to give them now listen to
[40:10] this only be thou strong and very
[40:13] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[40:16] do according to all the law which moses
[40:19] my servant commanded thee
[40:21] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[40:24] the left that thou mayest prosper
[40:27] whatsoever thou goest
[40:29] god says right here to moses he says
[40:31] refer
[40:33] back to the prophet's words
[40:36] and how often do we do that how often do
[40:39] we come to church and we don't refer
[40:41] back to the prophet's words we do every
[40:43] time
[40:44] and it's it's the precedent is set right
[40:46] here
[40:48] this book of the law shall not depart
[40:50] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[40:53] therein day and night that thou mayest
[40:56] observe to do according to all that is
[40:59] written therein for then thou shalt make
[41:02] thy way prosperous
[41:05] and then thou shalt have good success
[41:09] in other words in that scripture he says
[41:11] never stop reciting these teachings you
[41:14] must think about them night and day so
[41:16] that you will faithfully do everything
[41:19] written in them only then will you
[41:22] prosper and succeed
[41:24] and friends we have a greater
[41:27] opportunity
[41:28] to do what joshua did because we have
[41:32] the prophet's tapes we listen to those
[41:34] and how many listen to these tapes
[41:38] right here
[41:40] god's telling us
[41:41] he's telling these people telling joshua
[41:44] listen to moses
[41:45] keep listening to him keep reciting
[41:48] these things verse number nine
[41:51] have not i commanded thee
[41:53] be strong and of good courage and be of
[41:55] good courage be not afraid
[41:57] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[41:59] thy god is with thee wheresoever thou
[42:02] goest i'm going to claim that scripture
[42:04] for my own
[42:06] and i think all of us can claim that
[42:09] now the rest of chapter 1
[42:11] joshua is getting the people ready to
[42:14] cross over into the land that god has
[42:16] promised them
[42:18] and promised as i said hundreds of years
[42:20] years earlier
[42:21] the prophet abraham
[42:24] and then he tells the people he says in
[42:26] three days we're going over
[42:29] get ready
[42:32] so then
[42:34] in chapter 2
[42:36] and we won't read out of chapter 2 on
[42:38] this one
[42:39] but in chapter 2 is a very familiar
[42:42] story to all of us that's when joshua
[42:44] sends the two spies over
[42:47] and they go into the land
[42:49] and let me tell you those jericho
[42:52] people they were shaking in their boots
[42:55] they were and you can read in chapter
[42:57] two they did not want any part of that
[42:59] bunch of people over there they probably
[43:01] heard that the red sea parted
[43:02] they had probably heard that everything
[43:04] every place that they went to god gave
[43:06] them
[43:07] and here they go coming up to the jordan
[43:10] and it's like this river swollen but
[43:13] those folks over in jericho
[43:15] they're like this is not going to be
[43:17] good
[43:19] so
[43:20] joshua sent the two spies over they
[43:22] heard about this
[43:24] they searched the city for them you know
[43:25] the story about rahab
[43:27] and then they left they spent three days
[43:31] over there they left
[43:33] they
[43:34] came back
[43:36] and told joshua gave joshua a report
[43:38] joshua said we're going over in the
[43:40] morning
[43:42] chapter chapter 3 verse 1.
[43:45] i love reading this word
[43:52] and joshua rose early in the morning
[43:55] and they removed from him and came
[43:57] to jordan he and all the children of
[44:00] israel and lodged there before they
[44:02] passed over
[44:04] and it came to pass after three days
[44:06] that the officers went through the host
[44:09] and they commanded the people saying
[44:11] when you see the ark of the covenant
[44:13] of the lord your god and the priests
[44:16] and the levites bearing it then you
[44:18] shall remove from your place and go
[44:21] after it
[44:24] so joshua says get up and follow that
[44:27] ark
[44:29] he said that ark was a supernatural sign
[44:32] to israel wherever that ark went you
[44:36] were safe
[44:39] it was like the pillar of fire
[44:41] that was with moses
[44:43] and and we see
[44:45] we see that supernatural sign that they
[44:47] could see and they could look at that
[44:48] ark they could see they could see the
[44:50] pillar of cloud in the day and they
[44:52] could see the pillar of cloud
[44:54] at the pillar of fire at night and they
[44:56] had this they had something that they
[44:59] could look at and they could see
[45:02] and then
[45:03] we'll shoot forward a
[45:05] long time
[45:07] i don't know 1500 years or so
[45:09] and then we see it the day of pentecost
[45:13] and we see what happened at the day of
[45:14] pentecost they saw
[45:17] the pillar of fire
[45:19] among
[45:20] each person
[45:22] and friends we have something that we
[45:23] can look at now it's not something we
[45:25] worship or we get weird about
[45:27] but
[45:28] we have a picture
[45:30] of the pillar of fire the same one that
[45:32] was at the day of pentecost the same one
[45:34] that was moses was following at night
[45:39] there's probably a picture right out
[45:40] here in the foyer of that same pillar
[45:42] fire
[45:44] it's a gift to us that we can hold fast
[45:47] to that
[45:50] verse number four
[45:52] yet there shall be a space between you
[45:54] and it about two thousand cubits by
[45:56] measure
[45:57] come not near unto it that ye may know
[46:00] the way by which you must go for ye have
[46:03] not passed this way before
[46:07] and joshua said unto the people sanctify
[46:09] yourselves
[46:10] for tomorrow the lord will do wonders
[46:13] among you
[46:14] and joshua spake unto the priests saying
[46:16] take up the ark of the covenant and pass
[46:19] over before the people
[46:21] and they took up the ark of the covenant
[46:23] and went before the people and the lord
[46:25] said unto joshua
[46:27] this day will i begin to magnify thee in
[46:30] the sight of all israel
[46:32] so that they may know
[46:34] that
[46:35] once again he says it as i was with
[46:39] moses so i will be with thee
[46:43] for time's sake let's skip
[46:46] to verse 17
[46:50] and and the priests that bear the ark of
[46:52] the covenant of the lord stood firm on
[46:54] dry ground in the midst of jordan
[46:57] and all the israelites passed over on
[47:00] dry ground until all the people were
[47:03] passed
[47:04] clean over clean means all the way over
[47:09] now let's go to chapter four
[47:14] friends i could just read this and not
[47:16] say anything
[47:18] what a blessing that we have this
[47:20] this holy book here in front of us
[47:23] joshua chapter four verse one and it
[47:25] came to pass
[47:26] when all the people were clean passed
[47:28] over jordan that the lord spake
[47:31] unto
[47:32] joshua saying
[47:34] take you twelve men
[47:37] out of the people
[47:38] out of every tribe of man
[47:41] and command ye them
[47:43] saying take you hence out of the midst
[47:45] of jordan out of the place where the
[47:47] priest's feet stood firm
[47:49] 12 stones
[47:51] and you shall carry them over with you
[47:53] and leave them in the lodging place
[47:56] where you shall lodge this night
[47:59] then joshua called the twelve men whom
[48:01] he had prepared of the children of
[48:03] israel out of every tribe of man
[48:05] and joshua said unto them passover
[48:07] before the ark of the lord your god into
[48:09] the midst of jordan
[48:11] and take you up every man you a stone
[48:13] upon his shoulder according to the
[48:14] number of the tribes of the children of
[48:16] israel that this may be a sign among you
[48:19] that when your children ask their
[48:21] fathers in time to come saying what mean
[48:24] ye by these stones
[48:26] then
[48:27] you shall answer them that the waters of
[48:29] the jordan were cut off before the ark
[48:31] of the covenant of the lord then it
[48:34] passed over jordan the waters of jordan
[48:36] were cut off and these stones shall be a
[48:39] for a memorial
[48:41] unto the children
[48:43] of israel forever for the heathen
[48:45] memorial
[48:46] as we were talking earlier today
[48:50] and the children of israel did so as
[48:52] joshua commanded and took up 12 stones
[48:54] out of the midst of jordan and the lord
[48:56] spake unto joshua according to the
[48:58] number of the tribes of the children of
[48:59] israel and carried them over with them
[49:03] unto the place where they lodged and
[49:04] laid them down there and joshua set up
[49:08] 12 stones in the midst of jordan and the
[49:10] place where the feet of the priests
[49:12] which bear the ark of the covenant stood
[49:14] and they are there unto this day
[49:22] for time's sake
[49:25] let's let's go to verse 19.
[49:30] and the people came out
[49:31] up out of jordan
[49:33] on the tenth day of the first month in
[49:36] encampton gilgal
[49:37] in the east border of jericho
[49:40] and those 12 stones which they took out
[49:42] of jordan did joshua pitching gilgal
[49:45] and he spake under the children of
[49:47] israel saying when your children shall
[49:49] ask their fathers in time come
[49:52] saying what mean these stones then ye
[49:55] shall let your children know saying
[49:57] israel came over this jordan on dry land
[50:01] for the lord your god dried up the
[50:03] waters of jordan from before you until
[50:05] you were passed over as the lord your
[50:08] god did to the red sea which he dried up
[50:11] from before us
[50:13] until
[50:14] we were gone over
[50:16] that all
[50:17] the people of the earth might know the
[50:20] hand of the lord that it is mighty
[50:24] that ye may fear the lord your god
[50:27] forever
[50:30] the reading of
[50:31] of the book of joshua
[50:34] and
[50:34] and what happened
[50:37] on that day
[50:38] and i love the lesson that the lord
[50:40] teaches us in the bible
[50:42] he teaches us
[50:45] once these things happen
[50:47] to bring our children
[50:50] back
[50:51] to these things that have happened
[50:54] and tell them
[50:56] this is what happened right here
[50:59] tell them this is what happens right
[51:00] here at this tucson tabernacle this is
[51:03] what happened in sabino canyon this is
[51:05] what happened in colorado this is this
[51:08] these things really happen my
[51:10] my grandfather i have two grand grandpas
[51:12] have obviously gone to be with the lord
[51:14] now i have a grandpa wheeler and i have
[51:16] a grandpa evans
[51:18] grandpa wheeler was a deacon in brother
[51:20] brahms tabernacle
[51:22] grandpa evans you've heard brother brown
[51:24] talk about him on tape quite often he's
[51:26] one of brother branham's closest friends
[51:28] they were both
[51:32] they were both
[51:34] in colorado
[51:36] when brother branham got the group
[51:38] together
[51:40] and he said now there's a storm coming
[51:42] the weather man says that there's a
[51:43] storm coming
[51:45] and
[51:46] we can we might get get stuck up here
[51:48] for a week you know it's gonna get cold
[51:51] it's gonna be dangerous
[51:52] we can go back down the mountain until
[51:55] the storm passes go home or we can stay
[51:59] you look to my grandpa evans
[52:01] and he says brother evans what do you
[52:03] want to do
[52:05] when grandpa knew who was with him just
[52:08] as you were caleb you would know who
[52:10] joshua was
[52:12] my grandpa knew who was with him and he
[52:14] said he said brother branham he said we
[52:16] came up here to hunt
[52:19] and brother bram said okay
[52:21] we'll
[52:22] we'll stay
[52:23] so then he gave instructions there was
[52:25] about half the group i think or more
[52:26] than half left and went down
[52:30] and then a small group stayed and it was
[52:33] my two grandpas i believe it was my
[52:34] uncle ronnie i believe it was vernon
[52:36] mann who is like a grandpa toomey
[52:39] for the woods
[52:42] i can't remember looking at the picture
[52:44] in my mind and i don't know if brother
[52:46] billy was there or not i think he was he
[52:48] was
[52:49] so
[52:51] he tells everybody as soon as that first
[52:54] snowflake falls
[52:57] then you make haste right back to camp
[52:59] because you could get lost you get stuck
[53:00] out there you freeze to death
[53:02] so my grandpa evans went up with brother
[53:06] bran
[53:07] and they went hunting up high in the
[53:09] mountain
[53:10] my grandpa wheeler now i know these
[53:12] stories very well because i've heard
[53:14] them since i was this
[53:16] my grandpa wheeler went along the creek
[53:19] bed because he knew when the blizzard
[53:21] hit he could just follow the creek right
[53:22] back to camp
[53:24] so
[53:26] my grandpa evans is with brother branham
[53:27] and
[53:28] and it started
[53:30] kind of rough
[53:31] out there
[53:32] and brother branham
[53:34] tells my grandpa he said brother evans
[53:37] he says i'm going to go right up over
[53:39] here
[53:41] and that was a very nice way of saying
[53:43] you go somewhere else
[53:45] so
[53:46] he uh
[53:48] brother branham went up over a saddle my
[53:50] grandpa said
[53:52] and the wind started blowing
[53:55] and the blizzard started coming down
[53:58] and it was freezing cold my grandpa said
[54:02] he said the worst was the wind the wind
[54:04] was blowing so hard and he said he
[54:06] leaned up against a tree
[54:08] to block the wind he was already way too
[54:10] far to ever try to make it back to camp
[54:12] the snow was coming down brother branham
[54:15] couldn't have been over a couple hundred
[54:16] yards away
[54:19] from him
[54:20] and he's leaning up against the tree
[54:23] trying to stay warm not knowing what to
[54:24] do
[54:26] now my other grandpa brother wheeler
[54:28] he's down at the bottom
[54:30] of
[54:31] the mountain by the creek
[54:34] they were very obedient
[54:36] when that first snowflake came
[54:39] he turned and he started running
[54:43] back to camp you know my grandpa he's
[54:45] like six four big lanky guy and he was
[54:47] going
[54:48] and
[54:50] there's my grandpa evans and he's up
[54:51] behind a tree and my grandpa wheeler and
[54:53] he's running along the creek bank during
[54:56] the blizzard
[54:58] my grandpa evans says all of a sudden
[55:02] the sky
[55:05] began to clear
[55:08] and it started to get warmer the wind
[55:11] stopped
[55:12] very quickly
[55:14] the sky began to clear and it seemed to
[55:16] part like this
[55:18] my now brother wheeler was down he's
[55:20] running and he's not noticing that it's
[55:23] sunny outside and he's sweating
[55:25] and he stops and the snow's starting to
[55:28] melt
[55:29] and
[55:30] man you know so so he gets back to camp
[55:33] my grandpa evans comes back to camp
[55:36] brother branham
[55:38] uh stayed and you know the story if you
[55:40] listen
[55:41] to this to the story on tape it's
[55:43] beautiful that's when he had
[55:44] time with god
[55:48] it's a it's a story that i grew up with
[55:51] and it's one of those stones
[55:54] that we can come back to these things
[55:56] really happened i'm a witness
[55:59] that these things happen i grew up with
[56:02] two different perspectives of that storm
[56:04] in colorado there's another there's
[56:06] another story you know and when i've
[56:08] been to africa
[56:10] the the africans love this story
[56:13] and that's when
[56:15] my family the evanses would drive up
[56:17] from um
[56:19] georgia
[56:20] to jeffersonville and they'd drive up
[56:23] almost every whenever brother branham
[56:24] would be they followed brother branham
[56:25] everywhere my grandpa would work all
[56:26] week to get up enough money to follow
[56:29] him to go to his meetings
[56:31] so
[56:33] they drove up
[56:35] and they were out to eat in louisville
[56:38] how many people have been to
[56:39] jeffersonville here so i know who i'm
[56:41] talking about
[56:42] okay so you know louisville is on the
[56:44] south side of the ohio river which is a
[56:47] giant river
[56:50] so they were they were
[56:51] eating
[56:54] and somebody stole their car
[56:57] and
[56:59] they got a ride to brother branham's
[57:01] house
[57:03] brother branham got the family together
[57:06] and they my grandpa said they got on
[57:08] their knees
[57:09] and they prayed and you know if you
[57:11] listen to the tape brother branham said
[57:14] that they sent the angel
[57:16] after
[57:18] the man that stole the car
[57:21] well
[57:22] brother branham in the meantime he says
[57:24] you take my car his brother evans take
[57:26] my car you know and you go and enjoy
[57:28] your with your family so so they they
[57:30] went out and and uh
[57:33] after a few hours they're driving
[57:36] now remember it was stolen in louisville
[57:39] they're driving in jeffersonville
[57:42] in a place called i don't know if you're
[57:43] familiar with eastern boulevard where it
[57:45] goes up underneath
[57:47] interstate 65
[57:49] my dad
[57:51] says look
[57:53] there's their car parked right there
[57:56] not in louisville where it was stolen
[57:58] but over the river on the north side in
[58:00] jeffersonville
[58:02] right where their stomping grounds were
[58:04] they would have never found it but they
[58:06] drove right by it they're in
[58:07] jeffersonville my my dad's the one that
[58:09] saw it
[58:10] and and we know that story and the
[58:12] africans i don't know why they love that
[58:14] story so much but but you get a place
[58:16] like this and they all yeah you know
[58:18] they just go crazy over that
[58:22] another one of these stones that i want
[58:24] to bring us back to
[58:26] is marriage and divorce
[58:29] and and you know that
[58:31] brother branham gives a testimony during
[58:32] marriage and divorce my my grandpa i'll
[58:34] tell you i'll tell you you deacon
[58:36] brothers
[58:37] i want to tell you i want to tell you a
[58:38] story about the deacons that you
[58:39] probably didn't know my grandpa wheeler
[58:41] was a deacon
[58:43] and they were having uh it was who is
[58:45] this melchizedek and
[58:46] the marriage and divorce and these this
[58:48] meeting that they had and they had it at
[58:50] the
[58:52] junior high school in jeffersonville
[58:55] and the people were just piled in
[58:58] waiting to get in waiting to have these
[59:00] doors open
[59:02] well
[59:03] finally the deacons go and they opened
[59:06] the door and the doors flew open and
[59:08] they all ran in and they all got their
[59:10] seats
[59:12] didn't sell well with the deacon
[59:13] brothers
[59:15] they rounded everybody back up and said
[59:18] you're gonna go back out and come in
[59:20] like christians
[59:23] so so then so then they came back in but
[59:26] but the story about marriage and divorce
[59:28] brother brahm gives a testimony of
[59:30] seeing here in tucson
[59:31] seeing the pillar of fire
[59:33] up on the mountain
[59:35] and he gives a story about my uncle
[59:36] ronnie
[59:37] and ronnie saw that
[59:39] and and
[59:41] he saw brother branham soon afterward
[59:44] and he said brother brandon you're up in
[59:45] the mountain i said no no no
[59:47] he was taken back
[59:49] that that they saw that
[59:52] again
[59:53] witness
[59:54] that it happened
[59:57] so much so
[59:59] the founder of this church and you know
[1:00:01] the story
[1:00:02] the perry green
[1:00:05] he was brother brahm was praying for the
[1:00:07] sick and brother aaron and i were
[1:00:08] talking about it in the back back there
[1:00:11] brother branham was praying for the sick
[1:00:12] he said bow your heads and brother green
[1:00:14] he peaked
[1:00:15] a little bit you know the story the
[1:00:17] young man
[1:00:18] that had no eyeballs in his socket
[1:00:21] he watched and he saw those eyeballs
[1:00:24] perform the supernatural
[1:00:27] brother green the man that stood in this
[1:00:29] pulpit he saw that
[1:00:32] right the uh
[1:00:36] you know
[1:00:36] daniel let me tell you something my son
[1:00:38] there
[1:00:39] your dad me
[1:00:41] was dedicated as a baby right here
[1:00:45] right here that my parents brought me up
[1:00:47] and brother green dedicated me in this
[1:00:49] church so it's special to me that's
[1:00:51] where my ministry started is is is right
[1:00:54] here when i was when i was a little boy
[1:00:58] you know
[1:00:59] i think about the tabernacle and i think
[1:01:01] that that
[1:01:03] just after my dream and just being so
[1:01:05] excited the work here
[1:01:07] is not finished you know this church was
[1:01:11] the only church in tucson
[1:01:14] it was packed it was full
[1:01:17] and then churches started splitting off
[1:01:20] of it that's not a bad thing by the way
[1:01:24] that's good it's not that's not a bad
[1:01:26] thing
[1:01:27] churches started splitting off of it and
[1:01:29] forming their congregations
[1:01:32] and brother branham
[1:01:34] when
[1:01:35] somebody started criticizing um junior
[1:01:38] jackson and don ruttle you know those
[1:01:41] two brothers
[1:01:42] they started criticizing that and
[1:01:44] brother branham addressed it from the
[1:01:46] pulpit
[1:01:47] they said brother branham they're
[1:01:48] splitting the church brother brahm said
[1:01:50] no
[1:01:51] he said good he said let's empty out the
[1:01:54] church
[1:01:55] send him to these other places and we'll
[1:01:57] fill it back up again and then we'll
[1:01:59] empty it out again if we have to and
[1:02:01] we'll fill it back up again and the
[1:02:03] gospel
[1:02:04] spreads that's the right attitude
[1:02:07] everybody we all worry so much about
[1:02:09] splitting churches and you know and oh
[1:02:11] well you know they used to be one of us
[1:02:12] they're not they're not of us um what
[1:02:15] does it say they went out from us
[1:02:16] because they were not office which is a
[1:02:18] misinterpretation of the scripture by
[1:02:19] the way
[1:02:21] but
[1:02:22] they want to say that but no no no no
[1:02:24] they went out because they were probably
[1:02:25] led of the lord to go out so put
[1:02:27] somebody else back in the seat
[1:02:30] and whose job is that
[1:02:32] brother it's not just yours
[1:02:35] it's not just mine it's your job
[1:02:38] all of our jobs
[1:02:40] is to put people in the seats not to
[1:02:42] fill up the church not to pay tithes not
[1:02:44] to do that but because those people need
[1:02:46] it there's a need in the world
[1:02:50] and it's to bring the people back to
[1:02:53] these stones
[1:02:56] and let me tell you i want to be
[1:02:59] one of those stones that joshua that
[1:03:02] those men carried they picked up these
[1:03:04] stones out of the river they they're
[1:03:06] probably like this
[1:03:08] because they could pick them up on their
[1:03:09] own they put them on their shoulders and
[1:03:11] they carried these things and they
[1:03:13] dumped them in this place called gilgal
[1:03:15] where they camped
[1:03:17] and it was important to joshua because
[1:03:19] god told him
[1:03:20] bring people back
[1:03:22] to this place
[1:03:24] and that's what i believe this tucson
[1:03:26] tabernacle is by there
[1:03:28] bring people back to this we all know
[1:03:32] people that have left not gone to other
[1:03:34] churches
[1:03:35] but have left
[1:03:37] have left
[1:03:39] the fold
[1:03:40] and let me tell you it's not because
[1:03:42] they're bad people they're suffering
[1:03:45] get them back
[1:03:46] bring those people back because it will
[1:03:48] be a blessing to them
[1:03:51] we all need to work towards doing that
[1:03:55] these stones now our love
[1:03:58] i'll
[1:03:59] close with another scripture
[1:04:03] that will bring it all together
[1:04:07] and that's in first peter
[1:04:10] chapter 2.
[1:04:16] one of the stories one of the
[1:04:18] stones that i wanted to present to you
[1:04:20] is on my list i looked over it
[1:04:23] was
[1:04:24] my grandfather
[1:04:26] was uh i'll tell you from the beginning
[1:04:28] we have a few minutes um
[1:04:31] the evans is would follow brother
[1:04:32] branham around
[1:04:34] all over the place and he didn't know
[1:04:35] who they were you know they they they
[1:04:37] just my grandpa heard a radio broadcast
[1:04:41] and this man was preaching on there and
[1:04:43] he said wow
[1:04:45] this this brother's something special
[1:04:47] and it was actually it was a broadcast
[1:04:49] that came from cleveland tennessee
[1:04:52] and somehow
[1:04:54] it got all the way down to south georgia
[1:04:57] america
[1:04:59] and my grandpa was listening to it at
[1:05:00] the end of the sermon the the announcer
[1:05:03] came on there said that was william
[1:05:04] branham he will again be in cleveland
[1:05:06] cleveland tennessee tomorrow
[1:05:10] and uh
[1:05:11] at six o'clock or whatever it was my
[1:05:13] grandpa said
[1:05:15] cleo was my my grandma's name he said
[1:05:17] cleo pack up the kids we're going
[1:05:19] so they went
[1:05:21] and they went to cleveland tennessee
[1:05:23] their lives changed they saw that this
[1:05:25] man had something that
[1:05:28] in
[1:05:29] this man
[1:05:30] was this bible not just teaching it
[1:05:34] but this bible came to life
[1:05:36] everything that was written in this book
[1:05:38] of acts that should be among the
[1:05:40] believers this man had
[1:05:43] and he said he's got something and
[1:05:45] friends
[1:05:46] let me tell you about
[1:05:48] my
[1:05:49] relationship
[1:05:50] with brother branham's message
[1:05:52] is brother branham had something that i
[1:05:55] genuinely desire
[1:05:57] i want that relationship with the lord
[1:05:59] jesus that he had
[1:06:01] he gets so many there's so many people
[1:06:03] that criticize him
[1:06:05] say that he said things wrong say that
[1:06:08] that there was
[1:06:10] he contradicted himself he lied he did
[1:06:12] this he did that
[1:06:14] but
[1:06:16] i want that relationship that he had
[1:06:19] no one can deny that
[1:06:21] he came and and he
[1:06:23] the lord healed the sick through his
[1:06:25] ministry he preached the gospel how many
[1:06:29] people came to the lord jesus through
[1:06:31] his ministry
[1:06:33] there's
[1:06:34] there's
[1:06:35] very there's a lot of weirdness
[1:06:37] associated with this message people go
[1:06:40] too far
[1:06:41] and then they start drawing circles and
[1:06:43] cutting everybody else out and then
[1:06:45] there's this other side where they they
[1:06:47] hate brother brown
[1:06:49] because maybe they've been hurt
[1:06:51] maybe it's been presented to them wrong
[1:06:54] but then there's right down the middle
[1:06:55] of the road
[1:06:57] there's a prophet
[1:06:59] that brought a message to us
[1:07:01] that's true
[1:07:02] and i forgot what i was talking about i
[1:07:04] was talking about the story that uh that
[1:07:07] my parents were my my grandparents were
[1:07:09] following brother brown my dad and all
[1:07:10] of them their fallen brother branham
[1:07:12] around and they um they got to
[1:07:14] philadelphia
[1:07:16] and one of the campaign managers he saw
[1:07:20] these people and he'd seen them all over
[1:07:21] the country brother and they were just
[1:07:23] there all the time probably sitting in
[1:07:25] the front row they wanted to be close
[1:07:27] so
[1:07:28] he approaches my grandpa and says um
[1:07:31] seeing you around
[1:07:32] would you like to meet brother branham
[1:07:35] grandpa said yes i would
[1:07:37] that would be wonderful
[1:07:39] so
[1:07:40] i don't know this was in the mid 50s i
[1:07:43] think early to mid 50s
[1:07:45] and uh
[1:07:47] they um
[1:07:48] they had breakfast
[1:07:50] brother branham sister branham
[1:07:53] i think brother joseph was a little boy
[1:07:56] he was there and then my grandma and my
[1:07:58] grandpa and there was a there was a
[1:08:01] picture on the wall
[1:08:03] and it was a picture it was like a
[1:08:05] painting of a lake
[1:08:08] and brother branham looked up at that
[1:08:11] picture
[1:08:13] and he said it looks like a nice place
[1:08:15] to fish doesn't brother evans
[1:08:18] now
[1:08:19] let me tell you what happened the
[1:08:21] weekend before

[1:08:36] there's fishermen here and there's a
[1:08:37] limit on bass
[1:08:40] well
[1:08:41] my grandpa evans didn't subscribe to
[1:08:43] that limit
[1:08:45] he's a good fisherman
[1:08:47] and they had three
[1:08:49] like potato sacks
[1:08:51] filled with bass and i think they one of
[1:08:53] those probably seven
[1:08:54] and then hundreds
[1:08:56] of fish in these bags
[1:08:58] and uh violating the law so what

[1:09:23] fish
[1:09:24] and they search the car
[1:09:26] no fish

[1:13:22] together and a little bit of blood came

[1:13:33] stories of course i heard from my
[1:13:34] grandpa evans but i heard it from my dad
[1:13:37] many times over the years another one of
[1:13:40] those stones now we can bring these
[1:13:42] people back and they say you're crazy we
[1:13:44] say no we're not god sent a prophet in
[1:13:48] this day
[1:13:49] and he did say the same things that that
[1:13:52] the prophets before him did
[1:13:55] joshua parted the the jordan river
[1:13:58] you know brother branham healed the sick
[1:14:01] the pillar of fire the picture was taken
[1:14:03] over his head you know and and it was
[1:14:06] all done when i say brother branham
[1:14:07] healed the sake i mean jesus christ of
[1:14:09] course healed the sick
[1:14:10] through his ministry
[1:14:13] one after the other after the other
[1:14:15] now let's go let's go to my scripture
[1:14:18] here
[1:14:19] first peter chapter 2.
[1:14:25] peter says this
[1:14:27] he says we're for laying aside all
[1:14:29] malice and all guile
[1:14:31] two one through five we're for laying
[1:14:34] aside all malice and all guile and
[1:14:36] hypocrisies and envies and all evil
[1:14:38] speakings as newborn babes desire the
[1:14:42] sincere milk of the word that ye may
[1:14:45] grow thereby
[1:14:48] if so
[1:14:50] if so be
[1:14:51] ye have tasted that the lord is gracious
[1:14:55] to whom coming
[1:14:57] as unto a living stone
[1:15:00] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[1:15:03] god and precious now he's speaking of
[1:15:04] the lord jesus christ here
[1:15:06] and he's saying that this lord jesus was
[1:15:10] a living stone this is better than
[1:15:13] bringing them back to joshua's stones
[1:15:16] this is someone that's alive
[1:15:19] he was he was this stone that wasn't
[1:15:22] dead that wasn't a story like i'm
[1:15:24] telling
[1:15:26] he was alive
[1:15:28] now the best part

[1:15:47] you also as living stones are built up a
[1:15:51] spiritual house
[1:15:53] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:15:56] sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus
[1:16:01] christ he's saying that we
[1:16:03] are these stones but not a story like
[1:16:07] i've been telling
[1:16:08] but a living stone
[1:16:11] friends i have seen with my own eyes i
[1:16:15] saw a man sort of my wife and my son
[1:16:17] saw a man that was dead for an hour
[1:16:20] raised to life
[1:16:22] we hear the tape of brother way
[1:16:24] when we saw brother brother way it was
[1:16:26] quick
[1:16:27] this man was dead for an hour or more
[1:16:31] and we saw it you remember buddy of
[1:16:33] course you remember
[1:16:34] we saw this man rise to life
[1:16:37] alive jesus christ alive today
[1:16:42] and friends what i want to do what i
[1:16:44] want to see and i'm i'm just so i'm so
[1:16:47] excited because the lord
[1:16:49] led me here to tucson i didn't know
[1:16:51] what's gonna happen i don't know what
[1:16:54] he's gonna do in the future
[1:16:56] but
[1:16:57] i want to have a part in this gospel
[1:17:01] and i sure you do too don't you
[1:17:03] and i want to be one of these lively
[1:17:06] stones that peter is talking about do
[1:17:09] you
[1:17:11] will you
[1:17:12] will you be one of these you can't just
[1:17:14] sit there
[1:17:16] and listen to a tape and think that you
[1:17:18] got it
[1:17:19] let me tell you this let me let me say
[1:17:21] this and
[1:17:22] um
[1:17:25] brother peter's a lawyer so
[1:17:27] these are these are my cl where's
[1:17:30] brother peter where'd he go
[1:17:31] there he is these are my closing state
[1:17:34] statements so no objections please
[1:17:36] okay i will present my evidence here in
[1:17:38] a moment
[1:17:40] um
[1:17:44] if believing
[1:17:46] brother brahm's message we know the
[1:17:48] evidence of the holy spirit
[1:17:50] is believing the word for your day
[1:17:54] but let me also say that acts 19
[1:17:58] that paul that there was a group of
[1:18:00] people
[1:18:01] that came that paul came and i believe
[1:18:04] was in ephesus
[1:18:06] that
[1:18:07] paul came to them and they said ah we
[1:18:10] believe jesus
[1:18:11] you know we we
[1:18:12] john the baptist you know there was this
[1:18:14] man named apollos he was a great
[1:18:16] preacher he came in he introduced us to
[1:18:18] this christ and what did paul say paul
[1:18:20] says yes but have you
[1:18:22] received the holy spirit
[1:18:24] since
[1:18:25] you've believed
[1:18:26] james in his epistle
[1:18:30] they said the same thing to james
[1:18:32] they said we believe and james says oh
[1:18:34] you did good good for you you believe
[1:18:36] he said the devils believe
[1:18:39] and tremble
[1:18:41] there's more to it friends
[1:18:43] if
[1:18:44] saying
[1:18:46] that just because we listen to tapes
[1:18:49] or just because we believe brother
[1:18:51] branham if saying that
[1:18:55] makes us the bride then there is no holy
[1:18:58] spirit associated with this message
[1:19:00] but there is a holy spirit associated
[1:19:02] with this message brother branham had it
[1:19:05] we've seen it we've seen these
[1:19:07] testimonies that i've said there is a
[1:19:09] holy spirit associated with this message
[1:19:12] but we have something to do
[1:19:15] amen
[1:19:17] we have something to do friends if you
[1:19:20] want to take part if you want to have
[1:19:22] something to do
[1:19:24] if you have
[1:19:25] souls that are burdened
[1:19:27] on your hearts
[1:19:29] don't let it go
[1:19:30] go to those people all of us
[1:19:33] have people that we know that need to be
[1:19:35] here that need to fill up these pews
[1:19:39] for them
[1:19:40] can we stand
[1:19:41] stand together
[1:19:44] brother peter
[1:19:52] it means so much to me
[1:19:55] it means so much to me i was brother
[1:19:57] peter i read a uh
[1:19:59] a
[1:20:01] prayer request of some folks that i met
