[26:18] you
[26:19] every part of me lord is in great of you
[26:22] but lord
[26:24] said blessed are they longer and first
[26:26] after right
[26:42] thanks in jesus name amen
[26:47] i'm glad to be here let's let's turn
[26:49] while you're standing to jeremiah
[27:50] which come to worship in the lord's
[27:52] house
[27:53] all the words
[27:56] that i command thee to speak unto them
[27:59] diminish not a word
[28:02] if so be they
[28:04] will hearken and turn every man from his
[28:06] evil way
[28:07] that i may repent me of the evil which i
[28:10] purpose to do unto them
[28:11] because of the evil of the doing
[28:15] and let's go to matthew 4 and 4.
[28:28] this is
[28:30] jesus
[28:31] when the tempter is coming to him just
[28:33] like the tempter comes to every one of
[28:35] us
[28:38] this is
[28:39] jesus answering
[28:41] says in matthew chapter 4 verse 4
[28:45] but he answered and said
[28:47] it is written
[28:49] and shall not live by alone
[28:51] but by every word
[28:53] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[28:56] amen you may be seated
[28:58] and lord out of his blessings the
[29:00] reading of his word i believe
[29:02] that if we're to go home
[29:04] now and we were to
[29:06] go through the puddles and the rain and
[29:08] everything
[29:09] it would have been worth it for us to
[29:11] come
[29:12] because we've read this holy book
[29:15] and these words he said
[29:18] his words
[29:19] our spirit and their life
[29:22] i
[29:24] believe that's true and so
[29:27] in my great need that i see that my
[29:30] my own life is inadequate
[29:33] i need his life
[29:34] i need i see my own spirit inadequate i
[29:37] need his spirit
[29:39] and
[29:40] in this word
[29:43] is that spirit and that life that i i so
[29:45] need
[29:47] and
[29:49] i want to just come and give a
[29:52] theological lecture or something like
[29:55] that but i just want to share my heart
[29:57] with you
[29:58] that
[29:59] i'm hungry
[30:01] i want more god
[30:03] and i want
[30:05] i want to be closer to him than i've
[30:07] ever been
[30:08] i want to be more sensitive to his
[30:11] spirit than i've ever been
[30:13] and
[30:16] look at the way that our lord jesus did
[30:19] things
[30:20] he went and he he preached and great
[30:23] crowds came
[30:25] and they they loved his word right
[30:28] i said wow we've never heard a man speak
[30:30] like this this is great
[30:34] loved the word
[30:36] but they didn't love every word
[30:39] they just loved part of it
[30:41] and it's always been that way it's
[30:43] always that time of jeremiah
[30:46] god had to speak to these
[30:48] prophets
[30:50] speak all the words that i command
[30:53] don't diminish
[30:55] because
[30:57] some of these words are easy to love
[31:00] some of these words cut us like a knife
[31:05] but all through the bible there's many
[31:09] time after
[31:10] messages
[31:12] we can't live
[31:14] just part of it
[31:16] we can't just take the parts that are
[31:18] easy to deploy and
[31:22] everybody can enjoy
[31:24] um
[31:25] but we've got to take it as it is we've
[31:28] got to take it in its entirety
[31:32] and that's how it is spirit and life
[31:35] but if you try to
[31:37] chop it up and take this part of it
[31:39] without this other part of it
[31:42] you take the life out of it
[31:44] you kill it
[31:46] and and what you end up having
[31:48] is you end up having instead of this
[31:50] good news this
[31:52] world that will set you free
[31:55] that'll break the chains and give that
[31:57] spirit in life and
[31:58] let you live above sin
[32:01] and let you be born again and baptized
[32:04] in the spirit of god
[32:06] instead
[32:07] you just get something that's
[32:10] natural
[32:12] just the thoughts of
[32:15] of man
[32:16] once you change it once you take away
[32:18] from it
[32:20] it's like
[32:21] when they ask you to testify in court
[32:24] and they bring you up to
[32:26] come and give your witness
[32:28] they don't just say
[32:30] will you tell the truth
[32:33] because
[32:34] partial truth can be misleading
[32:37] and
[32:38] an innocent man can be hung
[32:40] on a partial truth a guilty man can get
[32:42] away on a partial truth
[32:44] so what they do they don't just say will
[32:46] you tell the truth because
[32:48] that in itself is not enough
[32:50] but what they say is
[32:52] will you tell the truth
[32:54] all truth
[32:56] and nothing but truth
[32:59] and that's what i want
[33:02] that's what i believe will bring the
[33:04] power of god if we'll stay with this
[33:06] word
[33:08] genesis revelation all the parts in
[33:10] between the parts that i don't
[33:11] understand
[33:13] it's many
[33:14] but i'll just say lord help me
[33:16] understand
[33:17] i have a desire for this word
[33:20] i have a desire to know you because
[33:22] to know him christ the word
[33:26] his life
[33:28] his word is spirit and life and
[33:30] i want to know that
[33:32] i want to know
[33:34] the one who wrote this book
[33:36] the one who hung the stars the one who
[33:39] made the rain and the wind
[33:41] and this book says that i can know him
[33:44] in the power of his resurrection
[33:47] i want that
[33:49] that's my heart's desire
[33:51] it says i can know him in the fellowship
[33:52] of his sufferings
[33:56] i want that too
[33:58] i want everything that's in here
[34:01] because
[34:03] i believe that we are living
[34:05] in a very
[34:08] a very important age very
[34:11] difficult age
[34:13] and i believe that
[34:14] the way that we live
[34:16] has a great effect
[34:19] and if you look at
[35:31] that really
[35:32] doesn't matter much to me
[35:35] except for
[35:37] those individual people
[35:39] have a value
[35:41] they have their presence and the sight
[35:43] of god and they're precious in our sight
[35:45] our friends and family that are not here
[35:58] but if you can i know you can use me
[36:03] so help me to get out of the way
[36:05] they wouldn't see me but they see you
[36:30] they heard it they had
[36:32] intellectual understanding of it
[36:36] and then they uh
[36:37] is that enough
[36:40] for them to go and change the world
[36:43] it wasn't enough
[36:44] see that
[36:46] they were with jesus for three and a
[36:48] half years
[36:49] they listened to the words
[36:52] they heard the miracles
[36:54] they were right there they slept with
[36:56] them they ate with him
[36:57] i mean
[36:59] what an experience
[37:01] opportunity that was
[37:03] you think well
[37:06] this was christ the person
[37:09] and i so
[37:11] i so appreciated what brother matthew
[37:13] watkins came in and speak to us about
[37:15] the balance
[37:17] that we need
[37:19] and talked on one side there's there's
[37:22] the jumping and shouting
[37:25] and then on the other side there's no in
[37:27] the bible he talked about
[37:29] we need everything
[37:31] we need every word and and there's so
[37:33] many
[37:35] ways that you can look at the bible and
[37:37] and so many ways that you can just take
[37:39] the part the side that you want
[37:41] you can take law or you can take grace
[37:45] and you can just major on that and leave
[37:47] the other side out and you could come
[37:49] and you could always just preach oh well
[37:51] god loves you
[37:52] peace peace
[37:55] well that wouldn't bring the spirit
[37:58] that wouldn't bring the life
[38:00] because that's not
[38:01] the word of god it's part of the word of
[38:04] god
[38:05] it's true but it's not the whole truth
[38:08] and on the same side you could come and
[38:10] you could preach law and you could
[38:11] preach holiness and you could preach
[38:13] repentance and and boy you could just
[38:15] really
[38:16] kill everybody with that sword
[38:21] it is true
[38:23] but it is not the whole truth
[38:26] so
[38:27] let us just come and
[38:30] if we'll really
[38:32] surrender to that
[38:35] if we'll really just get serious about
[38:37] seeking him
[38:39] as he is
[38:42] i believe the lord will do great things
[38:44] in our
[38:45] i believe if we can really
[38:48] get in one mind in one accord
[38:52] if there will be a fire
[38:54] that same fire that same holy ghost you
[38:56] know i was talking to
[38:58] to abel my son
[39:01] about fire and fire is one of these
[39:03] great mysteries in life
[39:05] it's it's one of the
[39:07] the most supernatural natural things you
[39:10] can see
[39:11] it's it's it's amazing
[39:14] but if you look at
[39:16] the requirements for fire it's really
[39:18] simple
[39:20] you just need wood something to burn
[39:23] some fuel doesn't have to be wood but
[39:25] some fuel
[39:26] you need oxygen
[39:28] and you need heat
[39:31] and it's going to burn
[39:34] most everything that you see in this
[39:36] world it's it's just
[39:38] you know it's under this air that's
[39:40] everywhere just like the spirit of god
[39:42] is everywhere where could i go from your
[39:44] presence where could i hide from it
[39:45] nowhere
[39:47] just like the air that's all around us
[39:50] and each one of us potentially we're on
[39:53] fire for god
[39:55] pretend we're we're fuel
[40:00] maybe we just need
[40:02] some heat
[40:04] maybe we just need to
[40:06] to draw
[40:07] close to that
[40:09] that spark of life that same
[40:12] same word that
[40:14] that one word went and
[40:16] created heavens and earth
[40:19] one word brought light
[40:23] if we can just really
[40:26] get on fire
[40:28] and then if we can
[40:30] keep from being so scattered
[40:32] keep from being
[40:35] so far from one another but if we can
[40:37] really love one another
[40:39] until we're just really close
[40:45] we want to know
[40:46] christ the word we want to know every
[40:48] part of it
[40:49] well his word says that if we say we
[40:52] love god and we hate our brother
[40:55] we're a liar
[40:57] the truth's not even in us
[41:01] so if you say well i finally got it all
[41:03] i'm gonna
[41:04] go up on my mountain and retire
[41:06] just me and god alone
[41:09] because i've really got it now
[41:14] maybe you missed it because i believe
[41:15] that if you really got
[41:17] what these men in the bible had what
[41:20] these disciples had
[41:22] you wouldn't be up on the mountain alone
[41:25] but you go find your brother and your
[41:26] sister
[41:28] and you go light them on fire
[41:31] not with anything of of your own self
[41:33] but just
[41:36] with that part of your life
[41:37] you surrender to the holy ghost
[41:40] because his power is the same
[41:44] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[41:46] and forever and
[41:49] some of you all got to see that
[41:52] some of you all have seen miracles
[41:55] we've all heard of them
[41:58] but how much do we believe them how much
[42:01] are we hungering for that
[42:03] how much are we willing to say lord
[42:07] whatever parts of your word that i've
[42:09] discarded
[42:10] that i've diminished
[42:12] as it says in jeremiah that i've just
[42:14] taken
[42:15] and decreased the font size a little bit
[42:17] so i can read over it quicker
[42:19] if we just say lord
[42:21] i don't want to do that
[42:23] i just want to take every word
[42:25] i want to take the whole truth and i
[42:27] just want to know you
[43:00] bring that same life and that same power
[43:03] that same
[43:04] manifested
[43:06] life of god
[43:07] but if we'll just stay true to this
[43:10] where it hurts where it kills us where
[43:13] it
[43:14] where it just cuts us to pieces
[43:18] i believe we'll see
[43:20] that same original life
[43:23] it says in the book of hosea
[43:27] i really like this
[43:30] hosea chapter 6
[43:32] and verse 1 we'll just read through here
[43:35] the first three
[43:37] three verses of hosea
[43:40] we've heard of the the former rain and
[43:42] the latter rain these these movements of
[43:44] the holy spirit
[43:45] how many want to be part of that
[43:48] how many want to just be
[43:50] in that great rain that that reviving
[43:52] washing cleansing rain
[43:55] but
[43:56] but look
[43:57] look at the lead-up
[43:59] to this rain
[44:01] there's pain before the rain
[44:04] it says hosea six and one if we can put
[44:06] it put it up
[44:08] and we'll read down to verse three
[44:13] it starts with
[44:15] a sermon in one word
[44:19] and i believe if we would just really
[44:22] obey this this one word
[44:26] with all our heart
[44:29] we'd get to that reign
[44:32] you know what this word is let's let's
[44:34] put this up hosea 6 and 1.
[44:38] the word has come
[44:43] hosea
[44:47] before we can do anything else
[44:50] let's just
[44:52] get where he is
[44:55] before we worry about our theology and
[44:58] and
[44:59] everybody else
[45:01] and even our sins
[45:04] let's just
[45:05] get in his presence
[45:09] i believe that if we just took that one
[45:11] word
[45:14] we could have
[45:15] a real good service with that
[45:18] if we just said oh god
[45:21] if that's in your word i want to do that
[45:24] i want to come to you
[45:26] i want to be where you are i was
[45:27] preached a sermon the other day by my
[45:30] dog
[45:31] said that's quite a dog that can preach
[45:33] yeah
[45:35] god speaks that way he speaks through
[45:36] donkeys
[45:38] and chickens
[45:41] this dog is a real friend to my kids but
[45:43] i'm like the disciplinarian
[45:46] and samia and this dog
[45:49] we're not even the best friends
[45:52] i'm kind of the mean guy
[45:54] but something in this dog
[45:57] he knows that i'm
[46:00] i'm kind of the the leader of his pack
[46:04] and he just wants to be where i am
[46:08] and we're outside and he's eating i'd
[46:10] gone outside he just came to eat
[46:12] and then as soon as he starts eating i
[46:14] leave to go inside
[46:15] he forgot the food
[46:17] and he just came and followed me
[46:20] he just wanted more than anything in
[46:22] this life
[46:23] just to be right where i was
[46:26] i thought
[46:28] i'm not even nice to this dog
[46:31] and he just wants to be in the same room
[46:33] with me
[46:35] more than anything in this world
[46:38] this is just a dog
[46:40] i don't even think he's a christian
[46:42] really
[46:43] but
[46:45] he uh
[46:46] he has that desire and i thought
[46:51] i'm supposed to be so in love with jesus
[46:54] christ
[47:00] that we're getting married
[47:03] that i'm part of his bride
[47:07] and i got convicted because this dog
[47:11] just wants to be where i am
[47:13] i thought
[47:15] am i that way with the presence of god
[47:18] that all i want to do is be where he is
[47:21] and as soon as his spirit leaves the
[47:23] room i say i don't care there's food
[47:25] here i'm out of here
[47:27] i'm gonna get where he is
[47:33] what if we live like that
[47:36] what if that was our primary concern
[47:39] it's just to be where his spirit is
[47:44] just to come
[47:46] and reason together
[47:48] and let him take away the sins of this
[47:50] world
[47:52] take this sin that was a scarlet and
[47:54] make it white as snow
[47:58] but the devil's whole plan is just to
[48:00] keep you away from that to distract you
[48:02] away from that
[48:04] to get you to sell your birthright for a
[48:07] little bit of porridge
[48:09] we read that in the bible and we say oh
[48:11] esau
[48:12] how could you do that
[48:15] how could you sell your birthright so
[48:17] cheap
[48:18] for a little bit of stew a little bit of
[48:20] porridge whatever it was
[48:24] isn't our birthright greater than esau's
[48:28] esau's birthright was
[48:31] some blessings
[48:32] some some little blessings
[48:37] our birthright is
[48:39] the holy ghost
[48:42] to have communion with the lord of lords
[48:44] and the king of kings the the creator of
[48:47] heaven earth that we could
[48:48] talk to him
[48:50] and have him talk to us
[48:53] we could say lord
[48:55] i have these sins in my life
[48:58] would you cleanse me
[49:00] would you change me lord i don't care
[49:03] about you and i don't care about people
[49:04] like i should
[49:06] lord give me your love
[49:08] my love is not enough
[49:11] lord my joy is not enough
[49:14] i need your joy
[49:16] my peace is not enough i need your peace
[49:18] that's your birthright
[49:20] to go and kneel
[49:22] where he is
[49:24] and know that he's not looking down at
[49:26] you in wrath but he's looking down in
[49:28] love he's not seeing you as the wretch
[49:31] that he should see you of as
[49:35] but he sees you through the blood as
[49:37] spotless as perfect
[49:40] look at how much greater our inheritance
[49:43] our birthright is
[49:45] an esau
[49:48] and look how cheap we sell it
[49:52] spend time
[49:54] joking
[49:56] looking at the news
[49:59] looking at the internet
[50:04] thinking about how to get rich
[50:08] hating one another
[50:10] being jealous
[50:12] you're trading that for that
[50:15] we do
[50:17] i do
[50:20] but there's a desire in me
[50:23] to be where he is
[50:25] there's a part of me that says
[50:27] i've got to throw aside these
[50:30] weights that i picked up
[50:32] that are dragging me down away from him
[50:36] i've got to tear away
[50:38] not in my own strength but by his
[50:40] strength
[50:41] these carers of this life that have
[50:43] choked this life out of me
[50:46] this life that should be shining
[50:48] such a light to my loved ones
[50:52] that's just being choked up
[50:59] i don't want to sell my birthright that
[51:00] cheap
[51:02] but i just want to be where he is
[51:08] come
[51:10] and let us return unto the lord
[51:14] for he hath torn
[51:17] oh don't talk about that part of the
[51:18] gospel
[51:22] sometimes god has to break us
[51:26] sometimes he has to tear us
[51:28] sometimes we have to go through years of
[51:30] pain
[51:32] before we can get to the place that he
[51:33] can pour his blessings on us
[51:36] but he loves us too much to leave us the
[51:38] way that we were
[51:40] to leave us in our sins
[51:43] to leave us in despair and hopelessness
[51:47] so he tears that away from us though
[51:48] it's
[51:49] grown in so close that it tears me apart
[51:52] to tear it out
[51:54] he knows what he's doing
[51:57] by the word
[51:58] that
[52:00] sharp two-edged sword that's quick and
[52:02] alive
[52:05] he knows what he's doing
[52:08] and though he cuts away everything
[52:09] that's not of him
[52:11] it won't hurt that seed of god that he's
[52:13] placed down inside
[52:16] he knows how to
[52:17] operate
[52:19] that he can tear
[52:20] but he will heal us
[52:24] he has smitten
[52:28] and he will bind us up
[52:32] if you want to be healed
[52:34] and bandaged
[52:38] you've got to get
[52:41] where he can
[52:42] operate on you with this word
[52:46] this is the only way that he can tear
[52:49] and smite away the sin from our life
[52:52] the things that we really need free of
[52:54] the things that are keeping our loved
[52:55] ones from seeing jesus christ
[53:00] but if we'll come
[53:02] if we'll return to the lord everywhere
[53:04] in our lives that we've gotten far away
[53:07] everywhere that we've lost our first
[53:08] love
[53:10] and our hearts have grown cold
[53:13] say lord i want to come back
[53:15] just like samson there his eyes gone out
[53:20] i said oh once more lord
[53:25] maybe years ago we were filled with the
[53:27] holy ghost and we were alive and we're
[53:29] rejoicing
[53:32] maybe we're far from that
[53:37] but if god's still calling you
[53:40] come
[53:40] return to me
[53:43] there's a way back
[53:45] today if you can hear his voice harden
[53:47] not your heart
[53:49] say oh god
[53:52] i want to come into your presence
[53:56] want to take every word though it tears
[53:57] me
[53:59] so it shows
[54:02] the things that i've let to bind me
[54:05] the prison of my own making and allowing
[54:11] though it sheds light on that
[54:17] oh dr jesus
[54:19] come and operate
[54:23] but see he doesn't chase us down
[54:26] and beat us over the head
[54:28] and operate in some alley
[54:32] he's a gentleman
[54:35] he's waiting for us to come
[54:37] he's waiting for us to want to be healed
[54:41] he's waiting for us to want to be with
[54:43] him
[54:44] he's not going to make you love him
[54:46] if you want to live your whole life and
[54:49] and just love him a little bit
[54:52] that's your
[54:54] that's your free will your choice
[54:58] but oh i want to love him
[55:01] i don't want to love him just with my
[55:02] own
[55:04] failing feeble love
[55:08] but i want to come to him that he can
[55:10] heal me
[55:12] and give me his love
[55:14] that i could love unconditionally
[55:16] that i could love
[55:18] everybody that i could just
[55:21] draw other people close
[55:23] that we could light on fire together
[55:27] that we could glorify his name
[55:30] see
[55:32] god doesn't really
[55:35] delight in all the hours
[55:37] of our singing
[55:39] i just came to glorify glorify his name
[55:43] he doesn't delight in that as much as he
[55:45] delights in one sinner that comes to
[55:47] repentance
[55:51] and i'm not saying one of you sinners
[55:52] i'm saying
[55:54] i need to repent
[55:57] i need healing
[55:59] i've been looking
[56:02] through this bible and i'm lacking
[56:05] i'm not living like these
[56:09] that we're really surrendered or we're
[56:10] living
[56:13] but i believe he's the same
[56:15] and i believe he's calling in a full
[56:17] answer
[56:18] that we'll see the same
[56:22] i believe we could live
[56:23] in such a way we say you know
[56:25] i was walking over to church
[56:29] and you know how god is
[56:32] my shadow fell on somebody and they were
[56:34] healed
[56:36] because that's just how our god is
[56:39] that's still how he is
[56:47] but we just say oh i'm
[56:49] that that's a little hard
[56:51] let me let me just keep with
[56:53] the part of the gospel that makes me
[56:54] feel good
[56:57] let me just
[56:59] get in his presence a couple times a
[57:01] year
[57:03] get right before communion and that's
[57:05] enough for me
[57:07] i'm busy
[57:08] got things to do places to be
[57:13] but i want to live in his sight
[57:15] he says after two days will he revive us
[57:18] in the third day he will raise us up
[57:20] and we shall live in his sight
[57:23] verse
[57:24] three says
[57:31] it's
[57:32] hosea 6 and 3
[57:37] after this it says then shall we know
[57:40] after this after we come
[57:43] after we're torn and healed
[57:46] it says then shall we know
[57:48] if we follow on to know the lord
[57:51] his going forth is prepared as the
[57:53] morning
[57:54] and he shall come unto us as the rain
[57:58] as the latter and former rain upon the
[58:01] earth
[58:04] that rain is going to come
[58:11] are you going to be ready for it
[58:15] where is it going to pass you by
[58:18] fall on somebody else
[58:21] i don't want to pass me by
[58:23] if god's getting somebody to the place
[58:27] that they love him with all their heart
[58:31] why not me
[58:35] why can't i just come
[58:38] god's no respecter of persons
[58:41] what he did for them back then
[58:43] he'll do the same for you
[58:47] god doesn't honor any man's person he
[58:49] honors faith
[58:51] how do we get that faith
[58:53] by going climbing a mountain or beating
[58:55] our chest or
[58:57] good music
[58:59] faith comes by here
[59:01] hearing the word of god
[59:03] so lord anoint our ears give us ears to
[59:06] hear and eyes to see
[59:08] see here's the thing about this it's
[59:09] easy to take and say well
[59:12] it's about every word and it's all about
[59:15] these these preachers that diminished
[59:17] part of the word and you know if i could
[59:19] just get a good church boy i could
[59:21] really be a good christian but
[59:23] the ministry here
[59:25] you know not not so good and so they're
[59:27] leaving stuff out and so it's their
[59:30] fault
[59:32] some other life maybe i could be a good
[59:33] christian
[59:38] verse 1 doesn't say come and
[59:41] come to your pastor
[59:44] but
[59:45] let him bring you to me it just says
[59:47] come
[59:51] if we'll just seek the lord
[59:54] it's an individual thing
[59:56] and god knows what we have need of
[59:58] and here's the thing if we'll really
[1:00:01] come hungry
[1:00:03] say lord feed me from your throne today
[1:00:07] this bible says he doesn't
[1:00:09] give the child that asks for a fish a
[1:00:11] stone
[1:00:12] or the child that asks for bread a
[1:00:13] serpent
[1:00:15] so if you really come hungry
[1:00:19] god will find a way to feed you
[1:00:23] and there were there are people
[1:00:26] that
[1:00:27] listen
[1:00:28] listen to brother branham every day
[1:00:33] but they don't hear
[1:00:35] the whole word
[1:00:36] they don't hear every word
[1:00:38] you can have the best preacher in the
[1:00:40] world
[1:00:42] you can have the best church in the
[1:00:43] world
[1:00:45] but if you're not hungry
[1:00:48] if you're not coming to the lord and
[1:00:50] saying lord
[1:00:51] would you operate on me
[1:00:55] that word is not going to be effective
[1:00:56] in your life
[1:00:58] because you're not receiving every word
[1:01:00] we don't receive this just
[1:01:01] intellectually
[1:01:03] it's not just in our saying okay well
[1:01:05] i've got to get a really good
[1:01:06] understanding on the law and i've got to
[1:01:08] get a really good understanding on grace
[1:01:10] and then then i'll have the whole word
[1:01:12] and then i can manifest
[1:01:16] but it's
[1:01:18] god coming and revealing it in
[1:01:19] simplicity
[1:01:23] that he can give you the faith to
[1:01:24] believe it
[1:01:26] and give you the heart to receive it and
[1:01:29] and where you don't know how to apply it
[1:01:31] he can give you the wisdom on how to
[1:01:32] apply it
[1:01:34] he does use other
[1:01:36] other people he does use
[1:01:39] the ministry he does use your brothers
[1:01:41] your sisters to
[1:01:43] to shine this light in such a way that
[1:01:45] we can receive it aren't you glad that
[1:01:47] we're not in this alone we don't just
[1:01:48] have to go and
[1:01:50] and get all weird by ourselves
[1:01:54] but we can be with god's people
[1:01:57] and we can say i know that's right
[1:01:59] something in me says
[1:02:01] that's god moving in my brother my
[1:02:03] sister's life
[1:02:05] that's an encouragement to me
[1:02:08] because i know
[1:02:09] they're human like i'm human
[1:02:12] if god will draw them and change them
[1:02:15] god will do the same for me
[1:02:18] if i'll just come and receive it see
[1:02:21] jesus said to peter
[1:02:22] blessed art thou
[1:02:24] simon barjona for flesh and blood hath
[1:02:26] not revealed it to me
[1:02:28] but my father which is in heaven
[1:02:32] we're never going to get there by
[1:02:34] by our intellect by our
[1:02:36] our own doings
[1:02:39] but it's by his grace
[1:02:43] if we just come to him
[1:02:45] stay with him
[1:02:48] just like that dog
[1:02:50] just wants to be where i am
[1:03:04] but are we hungry
[1:03:07] this is the day
[1:03:09] that
[1:03:11] we've waited for
[1:03:14] that the men of old had longed to see
[1:03:18] this is the day of christ's return
[1:03:22] our bible tells us he stands at the door
[1:03:25] and knocks
[1:03:29] if any man
[1:03:32] opens
[1:03:34] here's my voice
[1:03:36] opens the door
[1:03:37] i will come in that's a promise
[1:03:40] we'll sup with him
[1:03:43] it says if any man
[1:03:45] and i believe that applies to our
[1:03:47] sisters too
[1:03:52] but if we
[1:03:54] have we stopped hearing him
[1:03:56] knock are we listening to other things
[1:04:00] our minds on other things or our hearts
[1:04:02] on our other things
[1:04:05] where your treasure is that's where your
[1:04:06] heart's going to be
[1:04:09] and all this is going to burn
[1:04:18] where is my treasure
[1:04:20] what do i think about
[1:04:24] you know i was thinking
[1:04:26] you think of getting over there to
[1:04:27] heaven
[1:04:29] people come
[1:04:31] well i was
[1:04:32] i was one of those that
[1:04:34] gave my life as a martyr
[1:04:37] back
[1:04:38] back in the coliseum it's good to meet
[1:04:40] you
[1:04:42] oh you you were from the very end
[1:04:45] you were from that final day what was
[1:04:46] that like
[1:04:48] how did you how did you overcome in that
[1:04:50] day
[1:04:52] oh well i went to church when it was
[1:04:55] open and
[1:04:56] prayed 10 minutes
[1:04:58] a day
[1:05:01] worked pretty hard at my job
[1:05:04] people in the community thought i was
[1:05:06] pretty good and so you know
[1:05:08] just
[1:05:09] that's what i did wasn't too hard
[1:05:15] we deceive ourselves
[1:05:19] we take part of the word
[1:05:22] but there's going to be someone there
[1:05:26] maybe some little sister
[1:05:28] that just says well
[1:05:30] i didn't do anything really
[1:05:32] i just love the lord jesus
[1:05:36] i just stayed where he was
[1:05:40] and his grace brought me through
[1:05:51] it's serious times
[1:05:54] we have an enemy that
[1:05:56] has been doing this for a long time
[1:05:59] and is very good at
[1:06:00] getting us to to leave out part of the
[1:06:02] word to kill the life
[1:06:08] but we have a god that's greater
[1:06:11] we have a god
[1:06:12] of restoration
[1:06:15] we have a god that knew you before the
[1:06:18] foundation of the world
[1:06:21] and said to as many as received him
[1:06:26] this
[1:06:26] in its entirety
[1:06:30] the truth the whole truth nothing but
[1:06:32] the truth as many as received that
[1:06:36] he gave power
[1:06:38] to be the sons of god
[1:06:41] to be just like jesus christ
[1:06:46] i believe if we'll really
[1:06:49] seek that with all our heart
[1:06:52] to know him
[1:06:54] to know this word that's spirit and life
[1:06:58] i believe we're coming to the point
[1:06:59] where
[1:07:00] our lives are gonna be so so like his
[1:07:03] that
[1:07:05] people aren't gonna see the difference
[1:07:07] they're not gonna see us anymore they're
[1:07:08] just gonna see jesus christ
[1:07:12] i believe that with all my heart that
[1:07:14] we're coming to that time that time
[1:07:17] that's going to show
[1:07:19] that that corn of wheat that fell on the
[1:07:21] ground and died
[1:07:23] did it for a reason
[1:07:25] to bring forth much fruit
[1:07:29] see when we talk about
[1:07:31] knowing this
[1:07:33] this word talk about knowing christ
[1:07:37] we're not talking about just knowing
[1:07:38] knowledge
[1:07:40] that you can know the law side or you
[1:07:42] can know the grace side
[1:07:44] we're talking about knowing a person
[1:07:48] the person of jesus christ
[1:07:51] to know him as life
[1:07:54] we can put up this is
[1:07:57] this is what i've really been convicted
[1:07:59] by
[1:08:00] this this next scripture
[1:08:03] is john 15 4 and 5.
[1:08:08] but these scriptures that are there to
[1:08:10] convict us
[1:08:12] they're there to heal us
[1:08:14] that they're to bring us to the place
[1:08:17] that we're meant to be
[1:08:19] this is jesus word
[1:08:22] it says abide in me
[1:08:25] and i in you
[1:08:29] i believe we could we could just take
[1:08:31] that for the next six months
[1:08:34] and if we'd really
[1:08:35] take it with all our heart i believe
[1:08:36] we'd see a revival
[1:08:39] if we just say oh god let me abide in
[1:08:41] you
[1:08:44] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:08:46] itself
[1:08:48] except it abide in the vine
[1:08:50] no more can ye except you abide in me
[1:08:54] i am the vine ye are the branches
[1:08:57] he that abideth in me
[1:08:59] and i in him
[1:09:01] the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:09:05] that's a promise
[1:09:07] if you will come
[1:09:10] let his word operate on you if you'll
[1:09:11] abide in him
[1:09:13] your life will bring forth through
[1:09:16] say oh but i'm nothing i've i've messed
[1:09:18] everything up i'm too far gone
[1:09:21] nobody even cares about me those are
[1:09:22] lies
[1:09:24] the king of heaven cares about you
[1:09:28] he's looking at you with love
[1:09:30] he's saying son daughter come on up
[1:09:34] come on back
[1:09:36] to where you left me
[1:09:38] and if you'll just abide in him
[1:09:42] look what else is there
[1:09:45] says he that abides in me
[1:09:47] and is pretty smart
[1:09:49] and has
[1:09:51] things figured out
[1:09:53] it just says abides in me
[1:09:57] don't you love how simple that is
[1:10:01] any one of us can do that
[1:10:05] it just comes down to our desire
[1:10:08] is that the first desire in our life or
[1:10:10] is it not
[1:10:12] you can't do it if it's your second
[1:10:14] desire
[1:10:16] if you care about food more than that
[1:10:19] you'll abide in him until the food comes
[1:10:21] out
[1:10:22] then you'll be gone
[1:10:23] if you care about friends more than that
[1:10:25] you'll abide in him until the friends
[1:10:26] come out
[1:10:27] they're gonna be gone
[1:10:32] in the old testament there's joshua and
[1:10:34] caleb that they just stayed in that
[1:10:36] tabernacle continually
[1:10:38] they were the minority
[1:10:41] but it says oh they they just stayed
[1:10:43] there
[1:10:47] our example
[1:10:48] christ jesus
[1:10:50] he was god in flesh
[1:10:55] say
[1:10:56] he didn't really
[1:11:00] need anything right
[1:11:03] but where was he
[1:11:05] in his free time
[1:11:07] he was praying
[1:11:10] he was caring for people
[1:11:12] he was always about the father's
[1:11:13] business
[1:11:15] he is our example the devil will try to
[1:11:17] tell you no just live a
[1:11:19] kind of halfway christian life and you
[1:11:21] know come to church it's fine
[1:11:23] we're not called to that we're called to
[1:11:25] be like jesus
[1:11:27] he said the
[1:11:28] they that believe he that believes on me
[1:11:30] the works that i do
[1:11:32] he shall do also
[1:11:34] and greater than these
[1:11:36] he didn't say you can be
[1:11:40] you know one-tenth of what i am
[1:11:42] he said
[1:11:43] i'm gonna give my life
[1:11:45] where i am you can be also
[1:11:51] but is that our desire
[1:11:54] what is the most important thing in our
[1:11:56] life
[1:11:57] where is our treasure
[1:12:07] sister martha would come to the piano
[1:12:10] that last verse
[1:12:12] has just been on my mind so much
[1:12:15] with many things that we want to do many
[1:12:17] many of these are good things
[1:12:20] i want to be a good dad
[1:12:22] i want to be a good husband i want to be
[1:12:24] a good employee i want to be a good song
[1:12:26] leader
[1:12:27] these different things that i want to do
[1:12:29] they're good things
[1:12:33] i can't do any of them
[1:12:36] jesus says
[1:12:40] i'll fail at everything i try
[1:12:43] unless i'm abiding in him
[1:12:47] i'll only hurt my family i'll only hurt
[1:12:49] this church only
[1:12:51] fail everybody i love
[1:12:54] if i do it in my own strength
[1:12:57] if i just take part of this word
[1:13:01] but if i'll just take every word
[1:13:04] and abide in him and seek him
[1:13:08] and say oh lord i hear you knocking
[1:13:10] won't you come inside
[1:13:17] he promised we would see fruit
[1:13:20] what is that fruit
[1:13:22] it's the fruit of the spirit
[1:13:25] it's love joy peace
[1:13:27] long suffering long suffering gentleness
[1:13:30] goodness
[1:13:34] don't you want that
[1:13:36] don't your loved ones need that
[1:13:40] mind you
[1:13:47] let's let's just pray
[1:13:50] let's stand
[1:13:51] sister martha if you just play something
[1:13:53] softly

[1:24:12] earth
[1:24:14] and it had put yourself in the body of
[1:24:17] flesh
[1:24:20] and it came that place there
[1:24:22] but gethsemane where you have to had to
[1:24:24] make that decision
