like never before oh [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen if you have your bible we'll go to john the book of john thank you amen for our musicians thankful for them tonight john chapter 14. we just want to begin reading here with verse 1 real familiar amen scripture to us i'd like to speak to you tonight on a sudden change a sudden change let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself thank you lord that where i am there you may be also what a promise that is we have as a believer are you thankful for that promise amen blessed hope blessed rest for my soul john 14 that where i am that's just where i want to be lord i want to be where you are and he says and whither i go you know in the way you know thomas said unto him lord we know not whether thou go and how can we know the way jesus said unto him i am the way let me add to that i am the way and i am the truth and i am the life no man cometh unto the father but by me first corinthians one more scripture we'll have you be seated first corinthians chapter 15 amen brothers i sent a powerpoint also a pdf you could have that powerpoint ready first that'd just be fine uh let's just begin reading there's a lot i want to catch from this but let's just begin reading in verse 14. verse 13. let's back up to that no let's go to verse 12. now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen you see how important resurrection is let's read it again in verse 13 but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen and let's make it worse if christ is not risen then are preaching vain in other words we're wasting our time and your faith also vain yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins thank god he's raised i said thank god he's raised then let's keep going verse 18. then they also which are fallen asleep those who have passed in christ are perished and then here's this famous verse here i love so much i love it because i identify so much with it if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable now i want you to catch what paul is saying here he's saying that if in this life we have hope in christ it's good i'm glad i have hope in christ and i'm glad in this life i have hope with christ but paul says if it's only hope in this life then i am of all men most miserable because my hope of christ in this life points to a hope in the next life but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man also the resurrection of the dead by man also came the resurrection of the dead for as an adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christ at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet and some of those enemies will be christ and you putting under your feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death let's just move on down here just for a minute let me just uh maybe maybe we'll just pray let's do that since i've had you standing for so long then i'll we'll read it one more seated in verse 51 lord jesus we thank you lord for your word lord we just feel so unworthy lord as we stand here today we feel so lord unworthy of the grace that you've bestowed upon us how we can read these words lord and it's not like reading a novel it's not reading the newspaper it's not reading just the local events of what transpired in the sporting event or what transpired last week in the white house lord but when we read these words they mean so much to us lord they're our life story we're they're interwoven as part of us lord and we stand here today unworthy of that kind of grace but with hands raised we say thank you lord jesus that your mercy has been bestowed upon us that we can believe that we have the ability to believe your word in a world that's unbelieving in a world that's lord turn their back on you lord yet father you've placed something in our heart lord where you mean everything to us lord what manner of love is this that you've bestowed upon us we thank you for it may god you come with your spirit lord now i pray god that you would come and speak your word to your children we ask it in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated just move down there in your bible to verse 51 and we'll just keep reading there and then i'll have you turn also to one more we're using again here on our sunday nights teaching i believe it's as we've said many times it's extremely important amen is is teaching it's one thing to believe false doctrine but it's almost just as bad to believe no doctrine and so we know what we know that that the lord has given us something to believe and we're grateful for that but we want to know what to believe and so i believe that teaching is important so just bear with me here tonight amen as i just deliver what the lord told me to minister here tonight behold verse 51 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a moment just like that in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump that twinkling of an eye is uh there's no exact that i can find specific uh correlation that we could give a modern-day term to correlate that but as if as i've studied it it's like the light uh coming into the iris when uh when a light strikes your eye and there's a just a moment of a sparkle that hits the iris and paul is just using an example here's here's what he's trying to say it's going to happen and it's going to happen very fast it's going to happen very quick in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible incorruptible the dead shall be raised without need for any prophet or any ministry or any man to perfect their body hello the dead will be raised already incorruptible why we don't need a the brother branham to come back and as people have labeled him too to come back and to do some work he finished his work now it's our work now it's what are we going to do are we going to finish our race that they there's a ministry coming and brother bannon will all receive our body change well then tell me how are they in need of a body when the bible says they raise out of the ground incorruptible already and so he says the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed i need to change i got so much about me that needs to change and i'm changing day by day glory unto glory he's changing me he's changing me but the last change is not a change that takes place in your mind or in your spirit it takes place at the at the uh the the molecular level when your body's changed and this mortal shall put on immortality in this corruptable shall put on incorruption i'm looking forward to that day he says that in verse 53 for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up and victory o death where is your sting o grave where is your victory and so we know here in first thessalonians we're just going to go through these just for a moment i want you just to follow along with me if you have a bible i'd be good if you use it first thessalonians chapter 4 if not they have it on the screen for us first thessalonians 4 furthermore we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please god so that you would abound more and more now i know this scripture has been all of these the ones we read in corinthians and the one in thessalonians make things so clear for us in in as far as what we have set our expectation to it's amazing sadly how that some have even believed and some have suggested that that the body chan that the resurrection is already passed it's amazing you find that spirit even in the day when paul wrote this and there are some even today uh who would who would try to to to promote a false doctrine that the resurrection's already taken place and we must have misted him there are some even who suggested to me that we're currently right now in the great tribulation and that covet 19 is the great tribulation and this is germ warfare that brother branham spoke of you got to be so careful how we so many times let me just back up here just for a moment to make sure i don't gloss over this you have to be so careful in your understanding because your understanding of of of truth will then determine your expectation and how you live in other words if you're if you're if you're living like the lord is coming tomorrow then the bible says you purify yourself but when you don't live like he's coming tomorrow then you don't purify yourself you don't live a sanctified life if that day's already passed if we're not an expectation that it could happen in the morning so it's important what we believe it's important what is taught and that it's based upon the word because brother branham was a bible prophet in other words he was a bible-based prophet he didn't come with a new doctrine or a new theory or some new doctrine the message of the hour is not a conglomeration of doctrines given to william branham but the message rightly seen was a message that was a restoration of the apostle paul's message i couldn't say it more simply than that the message did not come to take us beyond paul that's false doctrine how could you go beyond paul's ministry how could you go beyond be how could you go beyond the abstract how could you go beyond the the alpha church it was a restoration back to the truth because the truth is not a doctrine the truth is not a story the truth is the truth is not a denomination the truth is not brother branham the truth is not just the bible or the message the truth is a person and he's revealed in his own word it's important that we clarify that he's revealed in his own word he's the person of the word is he jesus of nazareth yes he was is he jesus who we heard about in sunday school yes he was but who is jesus today he's jesus revealed in his own word and so that's why brother branham says they've crucified the word of god afresh they've crucified christ not that jesus came back and was born in a virgin again and then he was crucified but he had became the word and they rejected the word they crucified when he preaches indictment he's indicted a generation for the second crucifixion of the word so it's important how we it's important what we say let me come back to my thought here for a moment it's so important that we that we're that we are have a proper understanding that because there's so many things that you'll find and i'm speaking from experience here there's so many things that you'll find that maybe you've heard and you say didn't brother you ever said this before didn't brother branham say something about this over here you ever said that oh yeah i know brother branham didn't he say i can't really exactly find where he mentions this exactly and and you know what's amazing i was looking for something the other day and i was trying to find something that i just knew brother branham said and i go back and i'm having trouble searching it finding it searching it and i'll call another minister another brother a few other brothers i know i've heard yeah brother man i've heard that too and finally when i got down to the bottom of what he actually said it was so different it was close but it was preached through maybe a brother a preacher a person who said it at a table drinking coffee and then somehow we get that oh brother branham said that when he never really said it and if he didn't say if he did say it he didn't say it the way maybe that we've twisted it to say and so there's so many things even even let me just stop here for a moment you know with with with germ warfare you know and we we have the quote where brother adam talks about this in german warfare what you'll realize when you go back and you read the context of what brother branham is talking about german warfare that he's talking about happens in the tribulation period then what is covet brother matt it's a germ yeah so is the flu so was the bird flu so was the dog flu or the cat flu or whatever other foods they've had the other strains that they've had of the flu it's all germs it's part of the curse that happens in the garden of eden but it's not the plagues of the tribulation and when you believe that and you get an expectation you can almost create listen listen you can make the message say whatever you want it to say you take snip a little quote here and snip a little quote there you know jesus said to those on the road to emmaus he says you fools you fools and slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken you remember that now watch how i can just change the words of that you fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophet spoke you believed it all you see just a little inflection and you changed the whole meaning or i could say you fools and slow of heart to believe all the prophets have spoken it's different two different meanings so you've got to be careful that we make sure we bring it back so many times we've been so guilty in the message of just saying brother branham said brother branham said and we never take it back and tie it into where he got it from the bible and we don't have a biblical understanding of the doctrine and so therefore we can hybrid it if we're not careful amen and so even even i had a brother even just just a good brother godly sincere this brother was just wonderful didn't mean anything by at all and he starts telling me yesterday you know he starts looking at some of the things a restaurant that he got shown during cove and he said you know i'm realizing now all these things brother branham said he talks about how the shutter you couldn't buy or sell you know and and how that it's taken on what you know taking away you know the and it was again like i said it wasn't in any way you you you hear so much of this so many times that that sometimes even you yourself go yeah i think so i think i've i think i've heard that before and i think brother branham said that over here and maybe it was said in a certain way you know and as we said you've heard it over here in a certain way and and and then then we can just we can go so far as we said we can make it say whatever we want to say if we don't go back ourself if we don't go back ourself and study it out for ourselves we can come up with so much it's amazing because the brother was beginning to say he said now this is you know i can see it right here they're even limited they'll be able to buy or sell and and you know brother adam talked about that i'm thinking and i stopped i said wait a minute hold on just pause for one moment that's revelations chapter 13 where it talks about he that had the power you know they took the mark in the forehead a spiritual mark and he had the power to to to cease from you know the the scripture speaks about i think he even had it written down he had he had power to give life to the image of the beast that is tribulation that's not pre-tribulation that happens in the tribulation and just so carefully so quickly we can try so hard to apply certain things that are even happening in our world today and we misapply them and brother branham says when you disjoint the word of god you've done a terrible disservice to the word when you disjoin it i'm so glad we had a prophet who was vindicated and we could go back to what he said can you say amen tonight i'm just being careful with where i go so to make sure we don't we don't lose our train of thought here but i want to make sure we cover all of this he says here for the lord himself shall descend from heaven notice this here in verse 14 again or verse 16. for the lord himself no we didn't read that sorry brother let's go back to verse 13. first thessalonians 4 13. he says but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again i believe that do you believe that even sow them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord notice that this is by revelation this is for a word from the lord for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord we which are alive and remain shall be caught up now we know that the coming of the lord here that he's speaking of when he says the lord himself shall descend brother brandon picks this up and he says in the seals he says now christ did all three in his dissension so he says christ did all three in his dissension when he descended the shout the voice the trump what was the shout it was the message of the hour it was come out of her my people and be you not partakers of her sins so that you receive not her plagues that was the message of this of the generation that you're living in come out of her and a shout went forth who was shouting brother branham no it was christ doing all three he does the shout he does the voice and he's the trump so brother branham says he now notice this it's not you you you know i want to say this just here for a moment the message of the hour is not brother branham's message it's not it's not the message of william branham no more than amos's message and amos 4 was amos's message amos was just a mailman amos received the word of the lord and god gave him his message you know go read the words of jeremiah it's not the words of jeremiah to israel it's not the word or the message of jeremiah's heart but god takes jeremiah a vessel of god and god has something to say to israel so he takes a vessel and he baptizes him with his thoughts his words and his feelings and then jeremiah becomes the mouthpiece or the messenger of that message from god it wasn't amos's message it wasn't jeremiah's message it wasn't william branham's message that's why brother madam says i was just standing there when he appeared but let me stop and say this but because it was god's message then to get mad at jeremiah you're just getting mad at the mailman he's just delivering the message you might get mad at me the preacher but i'm just the mailman i'm just delivering the message don't get mad at me take it up with god but to reject amos because amos had the word from god then to reject amos you weren't rejecting amos you were rejecting god to reject jeremiah you weren't rejecting jeremiah you were rejecting jehovah and that's why when people turn away from the message they're not turning away from a kentucky man from kentucky they are turning away from jesus christ and it's not that brother branham was jesus christ and that's not what i'm saying you got to be careful because people so misconstrue things well we worship the god that's in william i don't worship the god that sent that was in william bran and i worship god worship god we're just worshiping the god that's in the man well what does that mean what does that even mean and it's so sly and so just carefully worded and carefully said well we're not following a man well uh when you're praying to that man when you're getting married to the with that man's voice when you're burying people with that man's voice i think you're i think you're you're pretty well following a man when you believe that when you have communion and you play a tape from brother branham coming to that communion service that brother branham is actually in spirit in that service serving communion you know what brother branham called that spiritualism and then he said it's of the devil communing with demonic spirits you don't commune with spirits of saints who have gone over the men and said is that spiritualism that's demonic worship you say brother man are you crying out against people not at all good godly people love the people real good godly people various brother branham said very sincere but very very sincerely wrong may god help us i said may god help us as paul says as such were some of you hello so it's not it it was it was notice this here because he says i i just want to go just if you have that power point brother peter i want to get to this to make sure we get to this tonight even if we run out of time i want to make sure we get to this brother aaron i hate to do this would you do me a favor and grab my power cord we have lost all power here in just a minute we're going to lose all power and i want to make sure we have the power point on the screen we'll need somewhere to plug that in sorry oh you don't my goodness well that's that's going to be important that we have that let me make sure i sent it to the right address i sent it to brother jeremy but jeremy may be to the uh the email i typically send it to could you go back there and get that pulled up thank you brother aaron you mind plugging that in for me you love him tonight sometimes you gotta depend on wires sometimes you know i forget what brother said it but he said uh that's not gonna reach maybe maybe it will it will good he said you know i'm so glad there won't be any liars in heaven and there won't be any wires in heaven either did he get that brother uh brother peter if he got that that'd be wonderful amen brother jeremy you're getting it okay if you could get it pulled up that'd be good so i want you to as we read some of these quotes as the brothers are just getting it pulled up i want you to watch how the prophet of god says this because as we said it's so important to follow some of the progression and and i'm being careful how i how we lay this out because i want to make sure that we we don't just gloss over it if we gloss over then it just creates more questions and i believe in having us things that are clear amen and not things that are misunderstood but you'll watch how brother baron begins to say some of the things that we're about to read in some of these quotes because so many even some have started to assert beyond those that have said the resurrection has passed and and that you know the rapture has already taken place and we miss the coming of the lord and we're in the tribulation now this is all tribulational stuff going on as off as that can be there are there are some things brother branham said that if you don't follow them in their proper context and their proper timeline of when he said them you'll misunderstand and say well hold on brother matt brother madam says this over here how does he say this over here so let's follow them today just here just for a moment prophet of god says what we need today i believe first is some good old-fashioned persecution to run us together now notice 1955 we find out that when the church is really persecuted i believe that god is permitting communism to hit the land just keep going to the next slide there brother peter go to the next one and he says and oh is that the next one or maybe that's the third one go to this yeah but i believe my brethren there is coming an hour that when a real ranked persecution will run us together and you'll notice that if you go and search this out in the message he says this in a few places to if you type in to run us together i believe there's a persecution my brethren there's come in an hour that when a real ranked persecution will run us together then we will be one the church will come together i believe it's all in the making of god after painting this picture to you so notice what it's all for to bring us together to run us together to unify us now brother branham says this in the midst of a denominational church now you've got to understand he preaches a message called the seed shall not be heir with the shock you go back and listen to that message after he's pushed out of that denominational system after he's all the doors are closed after all the pulpits have shut him out he realizes it was even the revival that he thought was he was a part of was not the real revival because the real revival hadn't came yet and so he begins to say a real persecution that will really run us together he says then we will be won the church will come together i believe it's all in the making of god what's important to understand and we're going to make this as an important point brother brandon prior to the seals not that any things that not that we take we put on the shelf things that were pre-sealed not at all but prior to the seals brother burnham has a church view of the bible he has a church view of the bible or a denominational view of the bible or his baptist church view of the bible he looks at everything through those lens so when you read things like this you have to understand he's reading things or saying things from the lens of a church view and the entire bible even the book of revelations is a church view you said for the matter oh then it must have all but no no no no no the church had a lot of it right a lot of it right it's not that we just say oh the church view oh denominational view denomination of you has it very right we believe a lot of what they believe so the message of the hour was not a separation it was a further revelation it was more like to something you were already looking at it was to tie the loose ends even people brother brandon plagiarized larkin brother brandon plagiarized this man over here i i don't know how they can think that when brother branham himself admits you're only plagiarizing when you don't tell people who you're copying and brother and over and over says i've read larkin's dispensational truth i've read his books over here i've read the even before he preaches the seals he said i had studied and read them all and read them all and written all the notes down for it and he says oh what a terrible mistake i was about to make and he says until the angel showed up about two or three or four this afternoon and he said and showed me where i had it all wrong so he has a even his bible remember it's after the seals that brother branham says this became a brand new book hello this became a brand new book looked at it totally differently not that he threw out everything but now the picture has been focused it's clear he says but i believe my brother now even before that you say brother matt i have trouble with that i have trouble you saying that brother branham uh you know changed that that that he had a church well well then let's let brother branham do it himself here go to the next quote and oh this is the first seal and oh i would have absolutely today and i hope that people are spiritual i would have had a horrible mistake on that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock i was wrong there when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that i was writing down to say prior to the seals brother branham preaches that the white horse writer in the book of revelation is jesus christ you go on the table and you go search it up and you can listen to tapes and you hear brother adam say that now does that mean that we preach that the white horse writer in the book of revelations is christ well brother branham said it and that you got to say what he said hold on a minute brother branham says i would have made a horrible mistake god corrects him on that and he says that's not christ that's the spirit of the antichrist so notice this here he has so in other words if you can give brother branham grace to change that after then surely you can give brother baron him grace to change anything else that he brother branham says the angel of the lord had corrected him on that he says i wish you would i would have made a horrible mistake had it been notice this here uh he says it again continue to follow just this thought how are we going to lose this great face now notice the date this is 64 april he says how are we going to lose this great race it's because we're divided how we going to do it we got to stay together we're all believers in god the holy ghost takes us all in it'll be a paradox if god ever gets us together but he will just trust him the virgin birth he knows how to send the persecution that will run us together many have looked at these kind of statements that he said and said see brother the man it's coming they're going to come and close the doors they're going to shut down our churches and we won't be able to to preach anymore and they're going to hunt us down like dogs because there's a quote where brother brandon makes reference to that even though in that reference it's in the tribulation somehow people have pointed that and said that happens to us we'll all suffer we'll all have to be given our we'll have to give our lives we'll all be persecuted there's coming a great persecution he knows how to send the persecution that will run us together and in the court trial 64 in april 12 he says there is where i knew all the pentecostal groups come together then it'll take a persecution to run you people together you'll never believe it but when that time comes now if we were to stop there if we were just to pause there just for a moment let me make sure i don't want to display uh the second i sent also brother jeremy a pdf just forgive me friends can you give me a little grace here tonight i want to make sure i don't want to miss any of this and it was it was just too important to just skip over let me open it up on my screen to make sure that i didn't miss anything that i want the brothers to display and if i do you're just have to pause that just hold that there and so brother branham says he says uh he comes now we'll continue there i'll have you display that pdf in a moment he comes to this place and he's saying this now something takes place something happens the same exact way that it happened in the seals something takes place in august of the same year brother branham is going to preach the feast of the trumpets now even prior to this trumpets brother brandon buys himself a plane ticket actually goes to israel thinking he's preached the seals next will come the viles then the trumpets and and and brother branham's wondering is this my place and the holy spirit stops him and says no no it's not your it's not the time and it's not your place because what the seals were to the gentiles the trumpets are to the jews and so he preaches this message the feast of the trumpets and something takes place in that message i don't have it here on the screen to display the the correct quote but i just want to go on i want to show you what is the tribulation for if you'll pull that pdf up brother you can do that because here's here's what here's what it uh the great tribulation that the bible speaks of uh calls it a day that will never ha there's never been a day like it and no there'll never be another day like it the great day of the lord remember that in the bible and so what is the tribulation for what's its purpose why does god need to send this tribulation let's find out and the seventh seal you can just on the bottom right there there's a plus button you can go quite a bit bigger than that just go till they can yep it's a little bit you maybe have trouble seeing that for the peter going up up up up right there down right there click click click keep clicking you in the back can you see that perfect you can just scroll over just a little bit we're cutting off some of the right edge there amen just scroll over just a little bit you should be able to do that i yeah just try to scroll in try to scroll in again until it does that keep going keep going one more time right there can you see that maybe once more there perfect he says the first thing was the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation for purification she had to be purged is the tribulation it's the purging he says she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period he cares do you care we're at the end time and we see we're at the end there's no not no way to build upon that corruption how can we build a city upon the charred ruins of sodom of a sodom and gomorrah how can we do it there's only one phoenix left and that's the coming of the lord jesus oh my a purification through the tribulation period to bring back a restoring of a world for a people who are just in the sight of god and live by his word you say brother matt what is the tribulation period for the tribulation is for the earth what the baptism of the holy ghost is for you now the tribulation period to the earth which remember the earth is just not to be cast off it's not a new earth it's not brother madam says what is it he said it's this same earth remodeled it'll be completely redone because how you say brother matt why wouldn't he just create in the earth because brother brandon says it's part of the book of life it's an eternal attribute of god mother earth mother the earth that you came from it's part of god it's an eternal attribute of god even the apostle paul says all creation all the earth groaneth and traveleth within itself waiting for the manifestation what's it doing it's in birth pains the same exact way that you look at sin and your life and go i don't want it lord get get rid of it god clean me of it god purge me of it is the same way the earth is groaning at sinful mankind saying get rid of it lord burn it god get annihilate it and brother branham says one day he will one day the elements shall mur shall melt with fervent heat what's it going to be it's going to already been it's already been baptized under noah's baptism it's already been sanctified by the blood at calvary it's only needing a fiery cleansing when all of the elements melt with fervent heat and it will purge itself can you say man to bring back he says a purification through the tribulation and bring back a restoring of a world for a people why is the earth purged for you because the earth has to match the purification that's inside of you you say i don't have it right now but one day we will one day the bible paul said i know not what we shall be when he appeared but here's what we know we shall be like him in his very image i say lord i'm looking forward to that day when i match this when i look in the mirror and i see this looking back at me when me and this become as brother adam says what you never dreamed possible and the earth has to match the condition the atmosphere is the earth matches what god has done in his family can you say amen he says now notice this this is questions and answers then at this time then at that time see the gentile bride is in heaven the sleeping virgin the gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved but has been rejected in the bride she only goes through the tribulation period for the time of purification because she has rejected christ not jesus of nazareth the word not a story not a sunday school lesson but she's rejected christ the word uh he says he says uh for her purification then she had to suffer for her deeds but the bride are you the bride who has become the word a complete atonement was made of christ because he is the word the body was rendered and when that body was rendered the bride was in that body because it's all the word amen you see it he says in conflict between god and satan there's no place where the church ever goes through the tribulation period christ's blood and the fullness of the application of the blood of jesus christ cleanses all sin now pull up my power point if you could i want you to notice brother branham has asked this specifically and questions and answers he's asked very very specific the next quote after that one brother branham will the bride go through the persecution as the early apostolic church did drum roll please you ready for this long theological get out your pins and papers no that's it that's it no i just explained that a few minutes ago no next thing is a rapture now remember we're at the promised land we're at the border you understand the march of israel no will the bride be persecuted no the next thing for the bride is rapture say brother matt why does that make you excited because then that tells me no matter what happens in this earth in my time on earth no matter what happens tomorrow at the white house or no matter where you want to point to it doesn't affect me because the next thing for me is to get out of here one day he says no the next thing is the rapture the next slide if there isn't he says no notice but i was thinking is this precious godly brother john go to the next one i may i may skip that next one there back up there he sees the martyr's altar he says now they were not under the altar of sacrifice mine wasn't but these they were martyrs mine wasn't under the martyr's altar i want you to tell i want you to listen real close and i'll close honestly about in 10 minutes he says go to the next slide there he says look they were not my the ones that the lord showed me the bride she was not under the martyr's block no the sacrifice altar of the martyrs but had received white robes by accepting in the pardoning grace of the living word christ had to give them a white robe she wasn't under the martyr's block is there one after that brother oh don't you see where we're at don't you see now this is in feast of trumpets he says don't you see why them trumpets means nothing to us means nothing to us they all sounded under our sixth seal you see why the holy spirit wouldn't let me speak it now i don't have i apologize i wanted to have this i don't think let me just check and go to the next one there that should be there it is thank you lord jesus i do have that there this is in feast now paul's that just for a moment now remember how we said brother brandon before the seals he says before he says i was about to make a terrible mistake and he said just about to make a terrible mistake he said till the lord jesus showed up now up until this point brother branham is you read persecution's coming watch the squeeze watch the third pull then when it will really manifest itself he says you watch there will be a persecution that comes to run us together but now watch everything change and you say when did it change brother matt well let's read when it changed back up one more quote i want to read the one we just read again oh don't you see where we're at don't you understand why them trumpets mean nothing to us they all sound another six seal you see why the holy spirit wouldn't let me speak about it speak it and the heavenly father knows with this bible before me that's the truth didn't know it till yesterday i didn't know it until yesterday he says in my room just like in the seals in my room there where he revealed it come to me and spoke to me i come back i said wife i've got it now he just met me in there and told me here it is honey see there it is see perfectly just in harmony you see brother brother matt was that important because that means that prior to yesterday which would have been the saturday before this everything brother branham had looked at was persecution persecution persecution and now he says then the angel of the lord came and revealed to me that has nothing to do with us yeah amen is right praise the lord is right thank you jesus is right some of some believers ought to be going thank god but isn't this what the bible teaches we're not we're not we're not ordained to wrath that's not what the bride that's not what the body of christ is ordained to jesus says though that you may escape these things and stand before the son of man he says i didn't know it till yesterday day before yes in my room where he revealed it go keep going brother oh people without him get in quick it might be the last opportunity you will ever be able to have you don't know what time he might come so was brother branham still looking for the coming was he still looking for the coming of the lord or had that already passed did that happen on the ohio river that wasn't the coming of the lord brother branham says the coming of the lord he says it's a physical keep going in the next slide there he says now people say what about the early saints i think i have it he says that was the changing of the dispensations that was under persecution which if you was here to hear this church is now this is questions and answers this is just the next month he says if you were to hear the church ages and to see how they went into that darkness and had to do that i had to do that then that shows where they had to take that persecution keep going because each one of the church ages and everything began to show that they were darker and darker so they finally went to a complete place that they denied his name and picked up another name that they lived and were dead and sardis and then it come on out thy tyrus sardis then come out began to come out to philadelphia and so forth then come to the time of the calling out of the bride which was to escape somebody say this together all damnation calling out of the bride to escape all damnation it counted worthy to escape all this damnation and wrath that's to come upon the earth that you might be counted worthy to escape it not go through it escape it that's him quoting the book of luke that you'd be sober that that you'd be not drunken with the cares of this life or surfing he says that you may be counted worthy to stand before the son of man and escape all these things and he says it kind of worthy he says not he says he says that you might be kind of worthy to escape it not go through it escape it do you understand now everybody i understand thank you lord next one here brother if we got an if we got another one another slide there just go to the the powerpoint or the the pdf then notice he says this he says where where we were in the in the pdf that you had pulled up he says there's no place where the church ever goes through the tribulation period christ's blood and the fullness of the application of the blind you say brother matt does that mean hold on pause that brother man oh good i escaped tribulation no you missed it that means i escaped any kind of purging no you missed it you see the only difference is is that your tribulation which is to be purged is happening right now so that you don't have to have purging there christ is purging you now he says there's no place where the church ever goes to the tribulation christ's blood and the fullness of the application of blood jesus cleanses all sin and why do we have to be purged we are purged daily no tribulation listen listen what jesus said saint john 5 24 that hear with my words believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come to the judgment but is passed from death unto life questions and answers standing in line to get into the church is going to be only a memory what's going to happen this is a question if we're not going through the tribulation are we to be see are we to be seen same some suffering if we're not brother branham gets he starts to read the question are we going to see some suffering now i want to pause here and say brother matt that means we don't suffer at all no the bible says all who live godly we heard it wednesday all who live godly in christ will suffer persecution we have brothers and sisters over in syria and in turkey who are persecuted daily you want to talk about serving the lord and and having to have a real testimony go live in syria go live in turkey we got a brother of jason to mars who travels there and is missionary to there that's real living faith every day persecuted there's big saints of he said brother matt is that unique no that's been happening since the days of the apostles amen i don't feel we need to even say any more on that you understand that he says tribulation are we to be some suffering if not this question is probably i'm trying to hurry i'll not do this ought to lay these back because there's a place you could stay in on an hour just tear it down i'll stop keep going keep scrolling down nope other way keep coming down he says look the people are wanting to say thinking that the church is going to hit the tribulation see it won't it can't because it's already redeemed now the church the nominal believers like lot he's going through the tribulation period and be saved as if it was by fire noah went through the tribulation period just the type carried above it come out with him ham who polluted the earth again see lot came out his own daughter slept with him and had children by his own daughter see but abraham brought forth the royal seed brought forth the seed of the promise enoch went to glory in the rapture just took a walk and went home he never went through the tribulation period you see there you are the bible cannot he says these types can't fail it does not predict that the bride now the church will go through the tribulation period now the people say what about the early saints that was the changing of dispensations we've already read that keep going down to 233. he says the church the lukewarm anything outside of the elected bride will go through the tribulation they will not raise in the first resurrection the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years just the four ordained predestinated elected bride god's own election who is it brother branham so arrogant and so elite of course it's me who is it brother branham i love this who is it then brother branham oh i love how he says it i don't know i can't tell you who it is but i know it's going to be there because the lord said they would they are the ones that will go up from the tribulation but the rest of them will go through the tribulation who is it brother branham i don't know but there will be somebody i say put your name there have enough faith to say lord if it's going to be somebody let it be my life let it be me lord let it be this church let it be my home god there's no elitist title that because you go to this church or this was your pastor you were part of this family none of that even the prophet himself he was asked in another place is your name on the lamb's book of life but the random says i don't know but i believe by faith that it is i have that same faith notice this here he says he says uh keep keep going down brother just keep scrolling that down what is it done in the cunningness he said he come like unlike flatteries and what has he done he is bringing the protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slider just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride how loose in the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations upon the bride so what is the bride while while the while the israel receives a physical persecution the gentile bride is persecuted spiritually ecclesiastically by an ecclesiastical church spirit that tries to destroy our churches tries to take away the power of the preaching of the word of god tries to make us cold and formal and lukewarm and indifferent and traditional you say brother man what spirit is going to come and attack our church it won't be a physical army that comes and shuts this church down it will be a demonic force that presses against us and rushes in like a flood and tells us to stop preaching the word of god stop trying to stop hurting the people's feelings itching ears to try to get a teacher to tell them something they want to hear it'll be a spirit that tries to make us cold formal lukewarm and powerless but the bible says when the spirit comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises up a standard against him that's the spirit that you've got to fight bring them to the slaughter he says not upon the nominations behind the bride but here you'll get it let's get it the bride will not go through that time the bible says the church will but not the bride can't you see ministers can't you see that brethren you say the church has got to has to go through the persecution the church has to go through the persecution for the perfection of it brother branham says the blood of jesus christ perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment even those who believe in a post a pre-trib and post-trib rapture people who believe in a post-tribulation rapture i think how how would that even make sense that you believe that god's going to rapture us out after all of the persecution i thought i was his wife that's the same thing brother branham goes to i thought she was the elected lady who he's purchased with his own blood that so ought you men to love your wife so as christ loved the church and gave himself for it and you mean to tell me he's going to espouse us it'd be like a man be like a man espousing getting engaged and then uh physically abusing his future wife beating her and then saying okay now that's all over now let's uh let's go have dinner or something you realize you'd laugh but that's exactly what you'd have to believe if you believe in a post-tribulation rapture listen how brother brandon picks this up you say the church has got to go brother adam says the blood of jesus perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace too with her she's found grace with him he engages to her and if there's anything in other words if anything comes up in her life he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them oh you ought to rejoice church you want to say thank you jesus for that grace and so it will be upon the bride and so is it on the bride we unworthy creatures can you can you identify with that deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it that's the reason i do believe that when the bride is called and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven oh this is my blessed hope here that'll take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that'll take her from the earth in a rapturing grace god promised it i don't care how many science how many astronauts they signed up and everything else how many million miles they can see i don't care nothing about it there is a heaven and there is a literal jesus christ there that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth god said so that's what believers believe that's what believers believe lights on if you could brothers no matter how old the story gets there is a literal not spiritual there is a literal physical bodily form of jesus christ that's going to come back one day and he's going to take you and your family and your children he's going to take us all to glory i want to close here just just here in just a moment can you give me oh my we're out of time can you give me about 10 minutes can you can i hear a good amen give me about 10 minutes thank you first thessalonians 4. let's go back to that here just brother jeremy just here for a moment he says for this we say by the word of the lord let me let me make sure i got the right the right spot here yes he says let's just pick up verse 16. for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead and christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up now this word caught up is the word harpazo amazing because this word's used multiple times in the bible it's a it's a word here i want to read it just one more time it says we which are alive shall be caught up that word in english means to be snatched to be snatched you ever snatch something out of someone's hand out of your child's hand maybe you snatch it out of their hand you're snatching something you're you're saying give me give me that back children do that to their brothers older brothers do that to the younger sisters give me that back that's mine what are they doing they're snatching it out of their hand this is exactly what the bible is saying we shall be snatched we shall be pulled out of it we shall be at the moment destruction's about to fall god will come down and snatch us out of it what's he going to do he's going to be taking back what's his hallelujah notice this here this word means to seize to carry off we shall be harponzo we shall be seized we shall be carried off by force to seize on to claim for one's self eagerly to snatch out or away this word harponzo was found 17 times in the new testament and the greek new testament and 13 and 13 different verses and every single time you'll find this word we're going to look at some examples here harpanzo it's referred to as a quick that's why paul says in the moment in a moment in the twinkling of an eye just that fast it'll it'll happen just that quick it's every time you read about it it's a fast quick violent rapid pulling away and he says it's a thing of thinking of an idea so it's used it refers to now notice here's something else important we shall be caught up together did you know called up that word harpazo specifically when i clicked on it and i thought this was just amazing it says not spiritually but literally so every single time it's used it's never used in a spiritual sense it's used physically literally substantively something happened something happens and in fact every time it's used it's used as a physical bodily snatching a removal from one place to another place from one sphere to another sphere from one condition to another condition from a world that's in chaos to a world that is peace snatched away the five times harponzo is used it it talks about people you notice you remember the scripture we'll turn there if we could turn to the book of acts if you have your bible just turn over to the book of acts or they could display it may be quicker to acts chapter eight uh brother maybe you can just write it down just for so for time's sake in acts chapter eight used very uh very literally here i want you you've probably read this before in your bible he says here in acts chapter eight and let's just skip on down to uh let's go to verse 38 37 and philip said if thou believeth with all the heart thou mayest and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god this is acts 8 39 and when they were come up out of the water display that if you could brother peter brother yeah thank you and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord harpazo the spirit of the lord snatched the spirit of the lord grabbed the spirit of the lord violently pulled peter caught him away philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way the next time philip's seen he's in another city you see the rapture that we're waiting on there's already been raptures that you can go read about in the bible you just think of enoch the bible says he walked with god and he was not think of elijah who was caught up in a chariot philip who was translated philip who was raptured philip who was harpazo snatched away god just pulls him out and the eunuch saw him no more what did the eunuch do it went on his way rejoicing and the next time philip hassini's in another city what was it it was the power of god physically not spiritually physically pulling removing a person from one place and putting them in another place what is the rapture it's the removal from this place to another place a real place brother brandon said it wasn't i i realized it wasn't us brother me and brother neville over there on harps floating around on clouds he said it was a real place with real people living real life breathing a real world jesus said to that day that he's preparing a place could you imagine how beautiful that place must be even this world that you live in do you know that the world that you have contacted since the day you breathed your first breath is a world that is under a curse it's a cursed earth yet it's beautiful it's a curse have you ever thought about that it's a cursed earth yet you can see some of the prettiest things in this earth you make postcards about it you take pictures and think oh how beautiful do you realize that is the earth under a curse imagine the beauty when the curse is lifted you think it's beautiful now jesus said i'm going to prepare a place that where i am there you may be also snatched pulled out seized you love him notice this here even paul you can go read and we won't we won't take time to read it when paul uses uses this word and he speaks of this in second in second corinthians and paul says i knew a man now he's speaking of himself in the third person he says who was called up who was translated that that's the word harponzo to the third heaven and seen things that is not lawful to be uttered i knew a man christ above 14 years ago whether in the body i cannot tell whether out of the body i cannot tell such on one harponzo called up snatched up to the third heaven verse three let's keep going there and he says and he says and he and he he says he heard things that were unlawful to speak up he paul couldn't even speak about it just go to the next verse if you got it brother brother uh verse three you got it pulled up we might as well read it now second corinthians 12 verse three and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i could not tell god know us verse verse 4 just keep going how that he was caught up into paradise snatched up seized up and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter even the bible speaks of this in even in luke uh chapter 24 at the ascension notice what happens with jesus it says in luke chapter 24 and verse 15 he led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up his hands and he blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was harpazo he was snatched he was parted for them and carried in fact it's the word carried he was carried up into heaven snatched away pulled away suddenly in a moment in the twinkling of an eye her pazzo physically not spiritually physically something happened something's going to happen one day to the whole entire world to the entire earth isaiah warns of this and isaiah begins to speak of a time where the bible says in isaiah if you want to put that up isaiah chapter 24 i'm going to close here isaiah speaks about a time in isaiah chapter 24 verse 1 isaiah tells us in the last days he says behold the lord maketh the earth empty and maketh at waste and turneth it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof he's going to you think they think that covet has turned the world upside down they have not seen nothing yet when the lord isaiah says on that day the day of the lord the day of the lord when it's the lord's day you had a day of the tank you had the day of the military the day of the air force and unless you had air force you you didn't stand a chance you had the day of the chariot and you unless you had a chair you had the day of the calvary and then there matured and it was the day of the military army well guess what there's a day of the lord and unless you've got the lord your tanks and your planes and your nuke bombs won't do nothing to defend you he'll turn it upside down isaiah says what a what an illustration he turneth the world judgment that's belching waiting his brother branham says what are we seeing today you say brother matt what do you believe covet is pre-tribulation signs as we read here before from a brother from africa who wrote that poem a dress rehearsal they think this is bad it's only going to get worse it's only going to get so bad until the world is turned completely upside down and in a single hour the bible says judgment's coming upon the earth and in one hour within just a short span of time the whole world will witness destruction upon not just a city not just upon a nation but the entire world john gives us this in revelation in revelations 18 verse 8 he says in one day death and mourning revelations 18 8 and one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong as the lord god who judgeth her for in one hour verse 17 for in one hour notice this so great riches is come to nothing one hour the vatican will be destroyed in one hour just 60 minutes in one hour it says so great riches has come tonight and every shipmaster and all the company and ships and sailors and as many as trade by the st stood afar off keep going and cried when they saw the smoke of a burning saying what city is like unto this great city isaiah begins to prophesy this and says every house is shut up it says the city in isaiah 24 10 the city of confusion is broken down every house is shut up so that no man may come in the entire world will be left desolate upside down the city is left in desolation and the gate is smitten with destruction in just a moment everything will change everything will change we think covet has changed things there's come in a day that's going to permanently change everything suddenly suddenly cataclysmic destruction on a scale never before seen what will it be for the matter to be the strike of god's judgment his final cup of wrath that is poured out the bible says the earth will begin to reel within itself and isaiah says there will be nowhere for man to escape he says in isaiah 24 verse 6 it says the lofty proud city he layeth it lo my he says and that they that dwell there and are desolate therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned and few men left the lofty verse 5 the the 26 chapter 26 sorry chapter 26 isaiah 26 5 the lofty proud city he layeth it low even to the ground he bringeth it even to the dust you know what will happen when that happens chaos like they've never seen before every civic activity will cease every every leisure activity will cease every worldly pleasure will cease everything will suddenly change preaching to you tonight on a sudden change suddenly everything's changed that's why we said it's a dress rehearsal covid everything suddenly changed look at what's changed in your world right now what's different about now than it was this time last year but they'll experience such a cataclysmic change everything will stop disorder massive disorder government won't be able to stop it they'll be helpless there won't be a task force they put together the kova task force there won't be a tribulation task force big enough smart enough intellectual enough with a big enough plan to stop it no state trooper no policeman no national guard no army man no air force no council no eu no no uh uh uh uh any kind of any kind of of human nation or human power will be
