each other oh you made it no I'm glad to see you I'm glad we're all home amen we have our brother Paul durksen and his wife sister Holly is that right did I get that [Music] right looks like that's what brother Dan wrote with visiting with us so God bless you good to have you now is with brother dawn your father okay I think it was around 1976 77 the first time he preached here at the Tabernacle and we ever just had just come to Tucson and then him and my father got to spend some time together cuz my dad had done a little bit of work for a family that was moving up to South Dakota and he gave him the message while he was talking to him um one the the little boy the little brother was was choking and the other brother dad said Daddy he got that glass what he thought was water was bleach and he had just drunk it and your dad and my father went and prayed for him and all the symptoms disappeared right then and there so the family's looking at and said well this God you serve is real now when he moved I don't know where where they went and I don't know the name but it was a testimony and it was it was your dad that was there praying for him so God is still the same yesterday today and forever amen he's so good to us let's look at um Joshua CH 24 vers 15 16 and 17 Joshua is saying here and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose ye this day whom you will serve it's whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but then Joshua says but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord and I like the answer here back from the congregation on verse verse 16 there and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods 17 for the Lord Is Our God he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great Great Signs in our sides and preserved Us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed so I choose today to serve him we know him as our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen so we had no prayer requests that were were written or turned in but if you have something you would say Lord remember me I have a need I have a desire let's just bow our heads Lord we we come this evening Lord on a Wednesday night and a midweek service and Lord uh with the things that have gone on through the day maybe at work or at home or traveling whatever it might be Lord but we're set the sight of time because you said where two or three are gathered in your name you'd be in the midst Lord so we're trusting in that you saw each hand that was raised Lord you know their hearts desire their need Lord so that you would come by even as our brother Daniel would prepare tonight Lord to begin to to lay out the books and the scriptures and the in this word of God Lord that is true and and it is still as powerful from the beginning as today as it ever was Lord

Jessica that heard her voice and the Lord called out her name when she was walking and she stopped and thought the the young ladies that were following her the sisters had called her they didn't call

call upon the same God that Adam called upon Lord the same God that Noah Enoch Methuselah Abraham called upon and Lord you are the same today as you have always been we're GR Lord we humbly invite your presence into our Bible study tonight and ask father that as your word is read that the Holy Spirit the same holy spirit that originally wrote it father would be with us tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all you can take your seats it's good to see everyone we're we're a little short tonight not not too many people I think uh they heard that I was going to preach tonight and that I had coid um but I'm not contagious anymore I promise it's uh but it is good thank thank you to everyone for your prayers it was um I don't think I've ever been that sick in my life I've had Co before but not like that um so now I can sympathize with the folks that have had it a little worse than than I got it um sister Grace God bless you welcome to church good I got a call or I got a text this morning from a good friend of mine brother Caleb pz from um Los crusis brother Caleb said hey there there's a sister that she she needs a place to go she she needs a church and I said sure I said uh I said you want me to get in touch with her he said well if if it'd be okay so I I got that in the morning and I was thinking about your sister all all morning and then when I broke for lunch I said well I need to call her and when I when I got in touch with sister Grace she said brother she says I was just praying she says I was praying that that if the pastor would call me that and invite me to church that I'll come to church so sister you're are welcome to come it's it's good to have you and from now on you don't need an invitation okay just just come to church it's good to see you it's good to meet you in person Brother David sister Sharon family God bless you welcome it's good to good to see you here my friend brother Paul sister Holly durksen uh we listened to uh about a week and a half ago uh week ago on Sunday we listened to brother Billy Paul's testimony and brother Paul I believe it was at your church wasn't it I saw you in the background there it was a real blessing to to everyone and um we just uh I know I miss I'm sure you do too I miss our friend brother Billy Paul I know you were close with him and uh he's greatly missed I am the first time I met brother Paul um that I remember meeting you is we were in Zimbabwe and I had just started I just came um from the US GE iCal survey and I had just got a new job at voice of God Recordings and Brother Joseph sent me and a group of us over to Zimbabwe and uh there I got to meet and spent some time with brother Paul Dirks and that was about 2006 I believe and uh I still remember that everything was going good and I was feeling great and we had like a youth meeting and and I got to talk a little bit to the youth and it's feeling good there's a maybe maybe a couple hundred and then we had meetings um I believe they were Friday Saturday and Sunday at the rainbow Towers in Harari and I was supposed to to speak and we walked into the auditorium and there were 8,000 people there I was like whoa and I was just on the job for two months brother Paul didn't seem bothered at it at all you you did a a great great job brother Paul would you mind coming up and saying a few words to the people brother Paul is a pastor in canisto and he's as I said he's a dear friend and he's somebody that he knows brother brandom's message like no one I've ever met and the brother knows he knows how to rightly divide the word there's a book that's required reading for most young people it's um courtship and dating marage marriage courtship and dating brother Paul is the one that put that together it's something that was sitting on my desk when I was in Jeffersonville all the time and I would always refer to it when we get questions about courtship and dating so brother Paul if you bless you my friend good well it is a privilege to be here brings back lots of good memories we uh first heard heard about the message in 1973 and we came down here to see what we could learn about brother brandom and we came down here and my goodness we found people that actually believed that there were prophets in the 20th century and we thought we were in a in a hot bed of of a cult or something and we wanted to get out of here but God had supernaturally led us here and my dad says no let's just stay and and see what we can learn here and we we went from here and we brought some tapes back home and started listening to them and God moved and we had a group of about 75 young people they all embraced the message and from that day on just a couple years later my dad was pastoring that's when he would have been down here 7677 we'd come to the meetings every year brother Perry would have it for quite a few years so I have memories of this as a young man and and it's good to be here and I have memories with brother Dan as well just uh we made a point when we'd go to to uh Jeffersonville there to uh the vgr offices to to just stop in and see brother Dan I've always appreciated that genuine Christian love and warmth that I felt there and we just had good Fellowship all the time and it was a real privilege and so we've had chances even now that he's left the vgr and his is over here we've had time too that we get together and can just really just Fellowship around the word and with the Lord and we're thankful for that so we wanted to make sure we had a chance to stop in and just to see how things were going and I know he's just been been here a little while the church has kind of had some changes the last couple years and so I thought we'd just stop in and just put our shoulder to the wheel and and bring our lick a little lick of fire and and put it with yours and just see if the Lord would move what's on my heart as a pastor and as we see things going you look at what's taking place in the world right now yes Amen to it it's it's beyond comprehension amen the anti-Semitism that is all of a sudden exploded around the world there is no logical explanation for that that is demonic and I believe that it is the the things that the scriptures the thing that the message talked to us about and told us and prophesied it is fixing to happen we are in the process of it now and I believe that it is lamp trimming time for us I believe that it's time that we need to check up and make sure that there is nothing because things could be different in the morning and we need to be ready constantly and so just don't let anything keep our take our eyes away from the things of the Lord and and to for his soon coming and we want to just be about our father's business I've been emphasizing when I have U been speaking for the last two years and it just keeps coming up and coming up but from Ephesians 4 where he says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit that is the vocation wherewith we've been called that is our vocation what's a vocation well it's could be our career what we do for our job our life our living could be a farmer could be an engineer that would be our our vocation in the natural but as Christians our vocation is to be a a an example and an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ and he says to walk worthy of the vocation which we've been called it has to do he says with meekness with humility with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit and I just want to leave this thought with you we have a Unity of the spirit I I like to do this I I'll ask brother Dan have have you maintained your U 200 foot yacht this this year yet no cuz he doesn't have one you can't maintain something that you don't have we have the unity to spirit because we've been born of the same spirit and therefore we have our part to do to maintain it and that takes humility death to self longsuffering forbearing one another and patience and so I believe that that's more important than ever we are in the closing hours days of time let's make sure we have our eyes on the prize have our heart right with the Lord and so the Lord bless you as we come into His presence tonight I'm looking forward to what the Lord would use our brother Dan to bring God bless [Applause] you one thing about brother Paul and uh and our conversations that we've had over the past few years is we are both exactly we see things exactly eye to eye on what brother Paul just said and I think that so often in in the past we've we've had different doctrines and we've had these wonderful Revelations that have come forward and they're they're but when a revelation separates the body of Christ it doesn't do us any good and I look at brother Paul and brother Paul is a master teacher he hopefully brother Paul you can preach for us sometime soon it would it would be a great honor to hear this brother I've heard him many times to hear him break down the word of God and brother Paul sees that the thing that is missing is a Unity of the Gospel as I've preached many times from this Pulpit that Jesus said that he would know us by our love for one another and not even that not so not even more than that that the world would see that Jesus Christ is the Messiah because of the love that the disciples have for each other the world hasn't seen that yet but it will see it and I want to be part brother Paul I want to be part of that Unity of the gospel and we are moving in that direction like you said it's there we just have to it has to come together we have to do our part each person each person whether it be husband and a wife whether it be a brother and sister whether it be friends we have to do our part and if everyone starts doing their parts then the Lord will come I really believe that with all my heart I appreciate brother Paul and his stand and brother Paul it's not always so easy to make us stand for Unity you think if we're standing for Unity that oh everybody's going to love us it's not like that is it brother Paul no it's not Unity requires leadership brother Paul is one that I've have seen he provides leadership for his group there and if uh he'll be speaking I assume at brother po this weekend let's make sure friends that we go and hear Brother Paul speak I think it would do all of us a lot of good and I sent out WhatsApp this morning that uh brother Israel's um services at Shalom Tabernacle Friday night Friday night at 7 Saturday night at 6 and then Sunday morning at 10: Sunday afternoon at 5: so please let's let let's go over there and and I know that uh brother Pro is a tremendous speaker and um I know that whoever is going to be speaking it'll be a blessing but um I think he's my favorite um God bless you all it's it's important brother Paul what we've been doing over the past about nine months is on Wednesday night I wanted to do a Bible study and we started with the book of Acts and we went chapter by chapter verse by verse word by word all the way through I believe there's 28 chapters in the book of Acts we started with chapter one and we went we went all the way through and we finished it we did a couple Recaps and in praying about it I thought that it please the Lord in doing that and and in moving the church forward thought Lord what would be the best thing that we can do first of all as as I said last last time I ministered I I said that the word is a lamp into our feet and it doesn't light the way all the way down to the end of the trail it just lights our next step so what that means is always be ready to change directions as we're learning so what I feel to do is we're going to start in Genesis and we are going to learn every single book in the Bible now we're going to do this we're not going to drill down too far we're just going to kind of fly over and and as as something that uh is a highlight we can telescope down in on that point but I want this church to learn our Bibles I wanted to I want you to learn what is Genesis Genesis is obviously means the beginning what is it what does that word mean what is what is the book about I me we all know Adam and Eve are in there but but there's a lot of others there's Enoch is in there there's Methuselah that I'll talk about today there's all the way there's Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph it's it's a beautiful book and it starts The Narrative of the Bible brother brandom said that the devil hates two books in this Bible the most he hates the Book of Genesis at the beginning and he hates the Book of Revelation at the end because it exposes those two books more than any other book in the whole Bible those two books expose the devil more than any other because the Book of Genesis Genesis shows where he began and the Book of Revelation shows where he ends and if the Lord carries we're going to get all the way through but again this light we may change directions the Lord may lead us in another Direction but tonight we'll start with the Book of Genesis so let's turn in our Bibles this is an easy one to find Genesis chapter one now Genesis has two distinct different parts it has basically how everything got started and how everything got ruined at the beginning the first 11 chapters and then from 12 to 50 it talks about about pretty much one man in his family and that man's name is Abraham and the rest of the book goes from from 12 to 50 talks about this man family this man Abraham's family so what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to get all the way to chapter I'll try to get all the way to Abraham maybe dig into a little bit of Abraham and then I'm gonna pass it over to brother Lyall next week and brother ly will bring us from Abraham all the way way to Joseph next next week so if the Lord's willing that's what we're going to try to do tonight Genesis chapter 1 verse one says this in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth that scripture right there friends is probably the hardest thing for anyone who wants to serve the Lord to accept is that all of this it's proba the hardest step to take in our walk with the Lord for all of this that we're in we look up at the stars and we say that yes God created those Stars we look down at the ground we say that yeah God created the Earth he created the heavens and the Earth and he is able to do anything and that's the thing that's hardest for for any man or woman to believe that he is able he's able to accomplish anything that he sets his mind to in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters here just in the very second sentence of the book we have excuse me the godhead being explained we have in the beginning God the father created the heavens and the Earth and then this was all without form and it was void and there was chaos and and all of this that was created had no order to it but we see now the holy spirit moves on the scene and upon the face of the waters and it starts setting things in order and I think about excuse me how the holy spirit in a Christian God created all of us he loves us and and he placed us on this Earth and then we get so worked up in society we get so worked up with problems and our families and and everything that's going on and we forget that that Holy Spirit is sent to set everything in order when you receive that Holy Spirit you are set aside to service of our Lord and in the church and here right here right at the very beginning of the Bible we see this Holy Spirit start to set things in order in the world I mean if God can take a hydrogen atom and add a proton and a neutron and a electron to it make a helium atom and then you can take a helium atom and make another atom over here and all the way way to carbon and oxygen and all this and then put them all together and make water with a couple hydrogens and a and an oxygen and then put some carbon in there and make and make a a amino acid or whatever it is and all the way to to higher forms of life if he can do that certainly he can straighten out our lives if they get messed up and God said I love this part and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day in the darkness he called night in the evening and the morning were the first day so on the second day God creates the sky and the atmosphere and he separates the liquid water from the water vapor and on the third day God creates the dry land separates the sea from the land creates plant life and grasses and trees and day four the celestial bodies are formed he creates all the stars and the heavenly bodies and it's so beautiful because he says that man can even tell what time it is by these celestial bodies that are in the sky and then on day on day five he creates the life that lives in the water and the fish and the whales and and he creates the birds and the insects and then on six on day six he creates the animals that are on dry ground and every other animal that wasn't created yet on day five and let's skip to verse 26 here I summarized that for time sake and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over the all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them notice he mentioned twice that God created Mankind in his own image and many of the times when I'm ministering and I'm talking about communion I talk about how if God if we are made in God's image and we want Fellowship as a father with my son Daniel my daughter meline my wife how I would like I like to be around I like to have fellowship with them and if we are made in God's image do you think maybe God would like to have fellowship with us and how we should spend in time with in prayer in the father talking to him and fellowshipping fellowshipping with him and speaking to him and and not always asking him Lord please bless my food and Lord please bless this and please bless that and help me out of this problem and that problem but how about sometimes saying Lord I love you and here is God as he created this man for fellowship with himself God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them remember God said remember Jesus said in John 4 4:24 he says God is the spirit and they that worship Him must Worship in spirit and in truth so this first creation you'll see in the Book of Genesis here there's two this first creation here is in God's Own image which is a spirit because God as Jesus said is a spirit and God blessed them and God said un them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the Earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed to you it shall be for me meat and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is life I have given every green herb for meat and it was so and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good in the evening and the morning were the sixth day notice as you read this when you go back and you read it God keeps saying and it was good and it was good and it was good Genesis chapter 2 verse one thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and sanctify it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God had created and made these are the generations of heavens of the heavens and the Earth where they were created in the day that God had made the earth and the heavens every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for God for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in the in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed let's ver let's skip down to verse 17 then he God gives Adam this man he gives him all of this creation this beautiful garden that he had planted and he says it's yours and he said of every tree on I'm sorry in verse 16 and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou May free thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die right now God is right here God is giving mankind a choice we always have a choice and our choice is always whether are we going to sin or are we not going to sin we have a choice and we can do either we can turn against God and to turn against God is to embrace death but to make that decision that we love God and to do what he says is to embrace god notice that the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it had both in the tree so there's good and there's evil there and you see that that he says stay away from that he says he says don't eat of that fruit even though that there's good there because he he doesn't want us to have the attitude of I can make my own decision I can do it myself you know it's good and evil I'll just pick good but no God says no stay away from that and the warning but Paul this is beautiful this warning is in perfect context because it tells us what this tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is the very next verse and the Lord God said it is not good that man that the man should be alone I will make him a helpmate a helpmate for him so right here he's saying touch this don't go in this direction he doesn't say don't touch it there but he says don't eat of this fruit and then right afterwards he says Ah it's not good that man's alone I need to make him a mate I need to make him a wife and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field let's skip to verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her under the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of the man therefore shall man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh this is the first marriage that was ever performed and God performed it right here notice he said cleave unto his wife so this man Adam and this woman eve were married and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed that verse 25 is important it's foreshadowing of something very important that will come to play into play just here in a little bit now so Adam and Eve they're in this beautiful garden everything is going well they have they have dominion over everything and they're eating of the fruits of the trees and they're enjoying in Adam's naming all the animals and and things are going well and then we see something come in right here verse chapter 3:1 now the serpent was more subtle than any east of the field of which the Lord God had made and he saith unto the woman y hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of every fruit we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest you die now do you remember before just before Eve was born just before Eve was formed God spoke to Adam and he said don't eat of the fruit of this tree not Eve he tells Adam this and then God forms Eve so here Eve is saying listen God said that ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it so I assume that this was her husband telling Eve because this was told to Adam before Eve was born before Eve was formed that Adam said listen God said don't God said don't eat of it and he said don't you even touch it he said stay away from this warning his wife and the serpent said unto to the woman remember she said that we're going to die if we eat if we do this thing now here is the Serpent's Seed this is how the serpent acts and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die exactly what God Said No God said don't do it and he said it's not that bad I know the word says this but it's not God didn't mean it like that here is how the serpent gets in and he gets his claws into the people and it's when you know the word says something and then you go and you do something through the councel could be of a pastor it could be of a friend it could be your own desires but you do something that the word prevents uh prohibits you from doing for God doth know that in the day that this is the serpent talking for God doth know and he's not a snake by the way snakes don't talk it's a uh this is a man this is someone that that is talking to Eve and reasoning with Eve in fact he's even more Sly than a man is so this is this is for all intents and purposes this is a man speaking to Eve for God doth know that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave unto her husband also with her and and he did eat and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew they were naked so they knew so whatever happened between this man The Serpent and this woman Eve and then to her husband it caused them to cover certain parts of their body very strange result from eating metaphorically of fruit and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord called and the Lord God called unto Adam and said Where Art Thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told you who told thee that thou was naked God immediately knew what they had done hast thou eaten of the tree where of I commanded thee that thou should us not eat there's only one way that you could have known that you were naked and that is if you had done this certain thing exactly what God said not to do and the man and the man said the woman whom thou gave Gest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat so God asks Adam and then God the Lord God said unto the woman what is that that thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat notice that God has respect to his two children for an explanation but he didn't give the serpent the same the same thing he didn't ask the serpent for anything and the Lord God said said unto the serpent he didn't ask he didn't ask what have you done and he said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all the cattle and above every beast and above of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life now he's changing from this manlike creature into a snake and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bre bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now I mentioned the godhead in chapter one where we have God created the heavens and the Earth and then we see the Holy Spirit move on the face of the deep and now we have the third part of the godhead mentioned right here but notice it came after sin it came because now they have sinned now they have fallen now they need a savior and it says this and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now here right here is the fall of mankind and now we need Jesus Christ on the scene and immediately God prophesies that this man is coming and right here we see that it couldn't be the seed of a man that it would come through usually you would you would think we're going to get to Abraham's seed and we're going to get to all of these different genealogies that go through and they're very important but it couldn't come through that it had to come through the woman because she doesn't have a lineage if it came through the man who would be like oh my dad's name is Joseph like like Jesus like they thought Jesus was but no it had to come through a woman because it had to be a virgin birth without a Earthly father and right here is prophesying of the coming Messiah because of a sin that had been committed the sin of adultery how do we know that it gets even better watch this verse number 16 God speaking and he said unto the woman he says you've done this and here's his children standing before him he curs the snake The Serpent and here's his two children and he said unto the woman I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception right here he's saying Eve daughter you're pregnant and in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children not a child but two twins children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and Hast eaten of the tree of which I command thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and thistles shall it bring before thee and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field and the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken dust Thou Art and unto dust Thou shalt return ashes to ashes and dust to dust and Adam called his wife wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living and again we know that because this was the sin of adultery here Adam is not the all he's the first man but he's not the father of all living but she is the mother of all living and unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them here we have a very another very very important the reason I'm spending so much time on just this first little bit of Genesis is because it is so important and it goes all the way through the end of the Bible this very this start right here we have the first sin we have the prophecy of the Savior coming and now right here the scripture I just read we have the first sacrifice unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe them you can't take an animal's skin off of it without killing it so God goes and it was probably I would assume it was a lamb that he he took he killed imagine this was God's his his animal his pet his his beloved creation that he had made and here he goes and he kills it rips the skin off of it wraps up Adam and Eve and thus we have the first sacrifice and we see that Sacrifice from this point we see it now through the rest of the Bible now then so Eve's pregnant she has these two kids she has Cain and Abel one of them understood things and you'll look with when Abel makes when when they make sacrifices to God Abel understood God killed those animals took the skin wrapped Mom and Dad up with it so I understand now that I have to take the not the not just a lamb or not just a animal but the very best lamb the Bible says and he took the the flock and the the fat thereof so he took the very best one the fat one the good one and he took that and he sacrificed it on the altar to God and his brother Cain over here he probably number one the the vegetables and things that and the flowers and pretty Altar and everything that he made it probably wasn't worth a whole lot this fatling was worth a lot and he goes and he makes this beautiful Altar and God says I refuse your offering and I accept your brother abeles because abeles was right so many times we try to make an offering to God sometimes because it pleases us oh I think I'll do this but make sure when you were making an offering when you doing something something for God make sure that it pleases him or else it's it's done for not so we see Cain and Abel we go through and we see all of a sudden now right after this fall people start multiplying they start breeding and and we see C's line going over here and these these great men and they they they built great buildings and we see even down the line with Cain the there's violence in the cities that they're building and there's problems and even all the way down to one of these people down the line of Cain he's the first one to take more than one wife showing you that polygamy even though it's through the Bible it wasn't right in the beginning and it was actually a descendant of Cain that started polygamy so we go through if we go to chapter five this is great if you go to chapter 5 we see the lineage of Adam so Cain gets mad gets jealous he kills his brother Eve and Adam have another son this man's this man's name is Seth and it's and it's strange she says that God has appointed me another seed outside of Abel if really if Cain would have been Adam's son then that lineage would have come down through Cain but because it wasn't Adam's son Eve she understood she said that God gave me another one because Abel was killed so he so God gives Seth and then through this line of Seth we see how long these people these people lived it said here it says in verse eight that Seth was 912 years and he died and you see this in this chapter five you see a common occurrence that had never happened before and he died and he died and he died all the way through and he died 900 years 950 years 920 years 890 years and he died and he died and he died and death started there in the Garden of Eden all the way down 2,000 years or so this one's maybe 1500 years thousand yeah 1500 years we get down to this man named Methuselah let's go to verse 21 this is very very interesting a lot packed in these next few scriptures and Enoch lived 65 years and begat Methuselah and Enoch walked with God walked with God after he begat Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so here we see a Rapture take place a man that was not sick that did not die God just took him happened again with Elijah and it's going to happen again very soon because as brother Paul was saying we are getting right to the end we're we're seeing everybody start to turn on this country Israel which I believe is in Ezekiel or Zachariah that says all nations will come against Israel we're getting to that point for a Rapture of more than one but many and I want to be part of that so Enoch God took him and then we have this guy Methuselah that's born very interesting thing right here we have Enoch his son was Methuselah then Methuselah is born and the name Methuselah means it means a couple different things but this is what struck me when he is dead it shall be sent yes so Methuselah is born and then 969 years later what happens how old was Methuselah when he died 969 years so meusel is born 969 years past about there's I mean wasn't maybe to the day but then something big happens so imagine if you knew Methuselah and you knew that his name maybe under prophecy said when he is dead it shall be sent and you're thinking okay Methuselah is getting kind of old in fact he's probably older than anyone has ever lived in their life and there's a prophecy that says his name means that when he is dead it shall be sent um continue feeding methusa that organic food because you want this guy to live a long time because what is going to happen when he dies I mean it can't be the end of the world right it was Methuselah lived 969 years and in that same year that Methuselah died it something happened that had never happened in the history of the world it rained not only did it rain from the skies the water gusted up from the ground and killed every living creature on earth including every human being except for this man named Noah and his family an amazing thing that happened 969 years after methusa was born so then Noah is Noah is on the earth and and right before it started to rain God looked out upon the Earth and things were just going bad you know it started it started there when when Adam and Eve were there and The Serpent and he messed everything up and now we have death and we have fighting we have murder and we have all of these problems and and these these young men are starting to marry outside with these worldly girls and vice versa it was just a big mess and it got worse and it got worse and worse and all of a sudden now there was more violence than there's ever been and God looked out upon the Earth and he sees that it's filled filled with violence violence verse number 10 verse number 11 chapter 6 it says this and the Earth was corrupt before God and the Earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the Earth and behold it was corrupt for All Flesh had corrupted his way upon the Earth and God said to Noah the end of All Flesh has come before me and the Earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth and Jesus Christ himself said before I return in the time that I return he says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be we see all the violence we see the hatred as brother Paul said the anti-Semitism against these people these are descendants of Noah these are descendants of Noah Noah's son Shem these are descendants of of the man named Abraham and violence all through it all hating these people and now it's all coming up and Jesus said when I come back it's going to be like it was in the days of Noah so then God floods the Earth kills all the people the ark floats Noah and his family to safe they after I think it was 150 days or or it was a lot of days um they they finally land on dry ground and God verse chapter number chapter nine God blessed Noah and his sons and he said unto them be fruitful and multiply when they came out of the Ark and replen the Earth exactly what had happened there at the in at the beginning In the Garden of Eden verse number 14 and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the Earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud and I will remember my Covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of All Flesh and the wat shall be shall no more and the water and the Waters shall no more become a flood and Destroy All Flesh and the bow shall be seen and the bow shall be in the cloud and I I will look upon it that I may remember the Everlasting Covenant between God and every living creature of All Flesh that is upon the Earth and God said unto Noah this is the token of the Covenant which I have established between me and All Flesh that is upon the Earth but sin already had a foothold but I think for everyone here and for the young people here when you look up and you see that rainbow remember God's looking at the same rainbow and he's reminding himself he's remembering that no I am not going to destroy this Earth no matter how angry he gets I'm not going to destroy this Earth anymore with a flood but Peter said the next time it's going to be burned with fire so then they started building C ities again as the Book of Genesis goes on they started building more cities and again sin had a foothold and they started to cause problems and and and then they build this great Tower of Babel they were so advanced in the way that they were living and in their technology they build this Tower and God looks down and he says the same thing that he says when it was in the Garden of Eden he says now look at they're becoming like us here and just like they had done when they ate of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so he comes down and he comes down in a different way this time and he confounds their language and everyone couldn't communicate the tower fell chapter 11 we'll get to Abraham and the earth and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and Tara lived 70 years and begat Abram nahor and Heron now these are the generations of Tara Tara begat Abram nahor and Heron and Heron begat lot and Heron died before his father Tara in the land of his Nativity in the in the land of his Nativity in her and in the caldes and Abram and nahor took them wives and the name of Abram's wife was Sarai and the name of nahor's wife milka the daughter of Heron the father of Mila and the father of Isa but Sarai was Baron she had no child and Tara took Abram his son and lot the son of Heron and his son's son and Sarai the daughter-in-law and his son Abram's wife and they went forth with them from ER of the Cales to go to the land of Canaan and they came to Heron and dwelt there and the days of Tara were 205 years and Tara died notice something that happened right there very strange so from Noah's time everyone was living to be 900 years old and then when it started raining all of a sudden very quickly lifespan started to shorten I don't know if it was an atmospheric thing I don't know if it was a physical thing I don't know what happened but the lifespans of the people began to quickly shorten until Abraham was about 125 years old so they went from 900 all the way down to 125 years in a very short time and once so Abraham starts or God starts to deal with this man Abram Abram later as you know his name was changed to Abraham and he tells Abram to come out as I just read of this land and go into this land of Canaan so Abram goes and he goes with his nephew lot as I just read they they go out and they started squabbling all of his people Abraham's people and lot's lot's people all the herdsmen they started squabbling with each other and Abram's like hey we can't get along you need to go your way and I'll go my way where do you want to go Abram looks down and he sees this ferle Valley in this city down there called Sodom so lot takes the fertile Valley and then Abram goes and goes his way to another place now in verse 13 they they separate ways that I'm sorry then in chapter 14 Abraham lot gets in trouble he gets down there and immediately he gets in trouble he gets taken captive by these Four Kings and Abra Abram must musters up an army of his soldiers arms them and they go down and they defeat these Four Kings rescue lot and then they come back and they meet this mysterious ious man called MDC just a couple verses about MDC mzc brings the bread and the wine and they have communion there and then from that time The Book of Psalms mentions this man mzd the book of Hebrews mentions this man mzc you've heard brother Brandon preach a whole sermon on who is this man mzc he's a very mysterious person but it turns out that this man is the almighty God in the form of a human being that meets Abraham so in chapter 14 he he meets he meets this man mzc and Abraham had been promised as I read earlier that his seed was going to spread throughout the world and that God was going to make a great nation from his seed from his children but there was just one problem and that problem is Abraham and his wife couldn't have children so it got of course Abraham was was really down and uh we'll end we'll end with this chapter 15 and then I'll turn it over to brother Lyall next week after this but I thought that it would be really nice to read this chapter 15 Abraham's down he had just met this man mzc conquered these Kings rescued lot and after these things chapter F 15 and after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abraham said Lord God What wilt thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this elaser of Damascus so Abraham had this servant in his house and it was the custom back then that if you did not have an heir if you didn't have a son that that Steward of your house would act as your son and inher be the inheritance elzer was a great servant we'll get to I'm sure brother ly will get to him in the next the next service Abraham said behold thou Hast given me no seed and lo one born in my house is mine Heir and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine air and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward the heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be this is a man that couldn't have children aging and he believed in the Lord and counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of UR of the C to give thee this land to inherited inherited and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take me a heer 3 years old and a she goat 3 years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided not and when the fowls came down upon the carcass Abraham Abram drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and low a horror of great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a in in a land that is not there and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years but the LI will be talking about that at the end of his seron his sermon next Wednesday and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with a great substance now we go into the book of Exodus God is prophesying here and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace and thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and it shall come to and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto the thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river of Euphrates it's fitting let's all stand it's fitting that the Battle Cry for the Philistines is from The River To The Sea and we read right here that no no no no no that land was given to Abraham to his son Isaac to his son Jacob and to all the sons of Jacob was it given and not to anyone else and they are in their inherited land today brother Aaron if you could sing a song as as we um close in this beginning of the book of Genesis we see the fall of mankind we see the genealogies come through and we see how God after Noah that he took this man Shem and from Shem this man Abraham and now the rest of the book is about this man Abraham and his Descendants the whole Bible he's there with Aaron for my soul would be had it not been for a [Music] man for the old rug C had it not been for a man called Jesus then Forever My Soul am man he he's mentioned this man Jesus as I said is mentioned right there in the Garden of Eden saying that that he was going to come and and he was going to crush the head of that serpent he's going to crush the head of sin but before that was finished that that sin would bruise his heel and he would die on the cross all the way through friends all the way through the Lord Jesus Christ from the start to the Finish he's in the Bible This Book of Genesis we see where Satan started he caused sin to come into the world we see it all the way down through the genealogies but we see that God had chosen his his people to serve him and now we have gotten to Abraham and the closing of the rest of the book is about this man Abraham and his family brother Paul would you come and close in prayer I want to pull on you one more time [Music] amen let's bow before the [Music] Lord heavenly father as we heard these important scriptures Lord that the devil hates so much because it does reveal where he came from it also reveals the beginning of our promises Lord that we today we are the royal Seed of Abraham through Christ and so Lord we know that even as that first commission was given there in the Garden of Eden was given to a spirit man before he was placed in flesh he was commission to be fruitful to multiply to replenish the Earth because as brother Bram said it was a spiritual Eternal commission we saw it tonight as Noah came forth from the ark that Commission Miss was repeated to go forth into the Earth to replenish and Lord that was not just and most importantly it didn't really involved the the bringing forth of the bodies and the temples of man but it was the spirits of man that would dwell in those temples that was what was of interest to you Lord and here we are father that commission is still ours when Jesus said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel there's that commission again we're under that Commission I pray Lord that we would have a burden in our heart for lost souls yes Lord we see the end Upon Us gross darkness is on the land lord we don't know maybe there's just one or two left that need to come in but may we have such a burden on our heart to reach out to let you work through US father as we see these scriptures these first chapters of Genesis Lord it brings down the reality and the importance of of where we're at today now this whole story is coming to its final end and then we go once again Immortal Eternal and we'll see you face to face thank you for being with us here tonight Lord I pray that this won't just be a simple Bible study or Bible lesson but Lord that you would reveal it to our hearts that it would change us increase our faith and give us more love for you and for one another we ask it all in jesus' name amen amen [Music] amen had it not been for a Hill Called Mount [Music] calary had it not been for the old R it CR had it for a man Jesus then forever my soul will [Music] beong I want to read just one more time as brother Paul was was praying and friends there are lost souls that are out there that need the Lord Jesus Christ in their lives we are seeing history play out before us pretty soon there's not going to be anymore it's going to be over this Rapture that happened to Enoch that I read about that happened to Elijah it's going to happen to a group of people and I want to be in I want to be in that Rapture but I want others to come reach out for first to our friends our families Members First to our loved ones and then reach out to more again it said God promised the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates I gave you this land and they are in that land today standing strong flying that star of David and pretty soon one one of these days it's going to be over so as brother Paul said let's get that last one in God bless you brothers and sisters pray that the first part of the Book of Genesis was a blessing I pray that you learn something remember it says in the Book of John that that the Word was God so as we learn more about this blessed old book The more we're learning about our Lord God bless you all you're dismissed oh Lord you are so preious to me and Lord You Are so preious to and I love love you yes
