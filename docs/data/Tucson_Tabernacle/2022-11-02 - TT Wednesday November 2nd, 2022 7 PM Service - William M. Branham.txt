Pains of Hell get hold upon me I found trouble and sorrow [Music] then I called upon I called upon the name of the Lord O Lord I beseech thee deliver my soul gracious is the Lord and righteous yet our

you've got to eat every day you have a good meal Sunday after a little while you better keep eating too not just wait till next Sunday so we ended up in one of the same houses again and he had his radio on and he's listening to a preacher I said well I don't know if I had that effect on him but that was good he was feeding himself some more so I appreciate the goodness of the Lord to us amen

place a wonderful place amen come go with me that's my plans how many plan to be there how many have made their reservations made their heart ready for that amen all the time so tonight we're going to listen to a message God's provided approach to Divine Fellowship God provides a way he makes a way now it's up to you what are you gonna do with it you know sometimes it's hard to believe when somebody says it's free you can go we kind of we get kind of that really what's the trick behind it what's that you know you get something in the mail you open it up and says oh you get a free dinner and then you keep reading because there's got to be a catch to it you know but God said this is what I'm going to do for you because I love you and you're my own so as we stand it's right about it's right at 60 Minutes long and has listened to it today and it ends very abruptly so I think maybe that's where the tape cut off but brother Brandon was just speaking then it stops so I told sister Martha you can't wait till it sounds like he's ending when I come up it's about ready to end because it just ends different but I appreciate that he's provided a way for us to enter into his presence amen and fellowship with me that's where life is only believe all things are possible how many knows that to be true all things are possible amen sometimes it it may look hopeless it may look how can it just be but God makes a way that's why David said what he said in that Psalms there because of you I'm alive today and that's the only reason why they mean oh Maybe oh baby all things are possible oh maybe [Music] all things are possible and Lord I believe Lord I believe gave all things are possible Lord I Am Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe [Music] thank you son offering ourselves Lord to thee as living sacrifices dedicating ourselves holy to that cause and to thy great gospel in this last days as Pentecostal believers as a worshiper of the one true and living God how we thank thee today that thou has made for us a refuge in a time of trouble a tower that we can run into and be safe when the storms are raging and the winds are high the lightning flashing yet we can rest just as surely on the promise of God as a baby would feel secured in his mother's arms we're so glad to have that we thank thee for this Full Gospel Fellowship of these businessmen for their stand in the last day of uniting the body of the Lord Jesus together we pray Lord that this convention will rise constantly until we see the coming of the Lord we pray for brother or Roberts your Noble servant and as we walk into this building tonight and see what the faith of one man can do we thank thee for Him Father and we pray that you'll bless his ministry wherever he goes and what he does may it prosper in your hands bless every Minister that's here all the children of God pour out your spirit upon us tonight and correct us and bring us into a a greater Fellowship than we've ever known before with Jesus Christ granted Lord for we asked it in Jesus name and for his sake amen I want to take the subject tonight um God's provided approach to Divine Fellowship take that far enough subject if I should call it that God's provided approach to Divine Fellowship all day long uh everything seemed to be different this certain day I don't know looks like there's times like that comes in life when people just begin to see things a little different than what they've once seen them this has been an unusual day the weather even seems strange eyes noticing as far my first Bible I ever knew was Grand Old Mother Nature you just follow that you won't be too far off the road watching nature how it works it was that that led me to God knowing that there was a god watching nature I was coming down the mountain looking out upon the beautiful Lake ambe Gog which leads out into the Androscoggin river I noticed the robins all seem to be getting together and giving their little chirping songs once in a while you would hear the snort from the male deer and looked like if they were getting ready for something it was coming winter and they were getting ready to yard as I plowed on down through the underbrush to meet my friend Warwick parked a canoe there was a he was sitting on a log waiting and I noticed out into the lake on baygo such a great swarm of ducks I've never seen so many Harley in my life and Bert my friend said what do you make of that Billy I said well they are getting ready to fly south I said that's the reason that sun set this afternoon did you notice how before it peeped over the mountain how that it looked so red it's getting ready to snow Bert and some kind of a special instinct that God has put in animal life to make ready to get ready to move flying time comes I said did you notice the birds today and uh the robins and so forth they're getting ready for their winter flight also the deers are getting ready to yard because that there's coming a storm as we dipped our panels into the uh Lake and started down I believe ever duck all up and down daniscoggin river had come into Lake umbagog getting ready for the flight and all of the quacking only as ducks can do just carrying on and Bert said what do you think they're talking about Billy I said they're having a little time of Fellowship before the flight and then is this Indian friend of mine and I moved on down the river to our certain camp and the moon begin to get pale as we knew the storm was coming in our paddles begin to make a little ruffle in the water then as the waves begin to rise I thought on this surely sometime before we take the flight we'll have a time of Fellowship when all churches can come together on one ground and all have a time of fellowship before we take the flight 10 years passed I was a local Baptist pastor at that time at Jefferson villain and his years passed on I come into this great Full Gospel businessman's Fellowship then I began to notice that how that they would spend their money and go from place to place and meet Across the Nation yes and the world and when they come together they were no differences among them they were not one saying I belonged to this certain assembly in another a certain assembly they all had things in common so I thought that must have been what I was thinking of that night of a fellowship of getting together before the flight starts now I've noticed Sam there in this great Pentecostal move that did not seem to be any condemnation among them you mean in a hotel room they'll throw their arms around one another right in the face of the other celebrity or whatever it is and hug each other and praise the Lord and cry a little while and Shout a little while and just act like they do anywhere else and I thought you know that's real that's there's something about that the women likewise it just seemed to be a great Fellowship and I wondered wonder what causes that and why is it we all can't do that why is it all people all human beings can't feel that way no condemnation just as free as you can be I thought well why can't everyone be that way now I believe we can but there is and the reason that we do that first is because that there's something in the human life that desires that something that calls for it today on the plane coming from Louisville down here I'll taking me two and a half hours of flying and take me all day to make it delayed planes and maybe God had a hand in it when I got on it Louisville there was a young lady got on the plane and sat down by me and she said you mind if I sit here I said not at all and as we went on they were serving uh lunch on the plane and I prayed well and she said are you a minister I said yes ma'am I am and she said I am a believer too and she told me of her certain denomination I said that's nice and I noticed we had a little package of cigarettes on the plane and uh lost to see what she'd do about it so as soon as the dinner was over she began undoing that package of cigarettes and she fumbled one a little bit and she stuck it towards your mouth and she took it down again and after a while she lit it up she said you don't mind if I smoke I said you don't mind if I tell you I do I said I said I I do because she said why I said I can't understand why a nice little lady with a personality that you've got would have to do a thing like that she said oh I get satisfaction out of it I said that's only a substitutionary satisfaction if you would just take what I tell you and would turn your life completely to God there's something that you're missing and you're trying to make cigarettes fill up that longing that's in your heart give you a false satisfaction which will soon give you cancer or degrade your body and you'll be gone and I said God made a person to thirst to thirst after him and then if they do not accept that then the devil gives them a false conception of pleasure and they try to satisfy it with the things of the world she'd made about two little drawers off the cigarette she said I'm 22 years old she said my engaged boyfriend is 32 that he told me I've been overseas for three months he begged me to smoke no more and she said this is the first time that I have smoked missing the plane and she said sir I'll take this promise now she put the cigarette out got man God loves to fellowship with his creature in the Garden of Eden we are told that when man walked in the uprightness of God God came down in the cool of the evening and fellowship with his children then one day there was a voice came up in the presence of God and said though your loved ones your children has fallen and they have sin that have did that which was wrong you know God didn't just select some Angel to go down and look it over to see if it was so or not are a certain cherub in all the heavens but God came his self-crying Adam Where Art Thou God himself come crying for his Lost Child when he found him hiding in the bushes behind sold fig leaves he said who told you you were naked and he could not come out and have Fellowship no more with God now if there is a True Fellowship and God is love and love Demands a fellowship like the young couple when the boy meets the girl and he says to her he thinks she's so pretty and and she's a fond of him they want to have Fellowship a real Fellowship but before they can have this Fellowship there has to be an agreement before they can enter into wedding wedlock there has to be an agreement for this certain fellowship and it's based upon the truces of our pledges to each other and then holy wedlock and then we enter into a lifelong Fellowship but before we can enter into that Fellowship there has to be a an agreement first and when Fellowship was broken between God and man there had to be some sort of an agreement some sort of an arrangements to restore again that lost Fellowship and God found the plan and it was through the blood of an innocent victim that God restored man back to fellowship with him again there's been many substitutes tried Adam tried it we've tried to educate people to it we've tried all different forms but there's nothing that brings men back into fellowship with his maker but the blood of his son Jesus Christ it's the only appropriation God has is the blood an innocent victim died for a guilty person that brought the fellowship back to God and man again then Adam covered by this Blood could stand in the presence of God and worship again oh I love that there's something about it when you speak of blood blood has life without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sins you can have everything in the world you can have any kind of a thing that you wished you any object to worship any Creed to live by but you can never come into Fellowship Divine fellowship with God until first you come under the blood that's God's holy and ordained and provided way for our human beings to fellowship with him through the blood of his son the Lord Jesus Christ that was God's plan it's still God's plan it will forever be God's plan no other plan but through the shedding of the blood the Old Testament and the journey Israel from their homelands going over or out of Egypt rather going to their homelands on their way over God made a preparation through the blood we want to thank now on the 19th Chapter of numbers God told Moses and Aaron go take a red heifer now the symbol of red many times is a bad color or danger but red also means an atonement go get a red heifer all red not a spot owner she represented of course Christ and this heifer must never have a yoke up on its neck if it ever was yoked then it is it's condemned it must not be yoked up with the world that's the way the church is today Christ when he came he never yoked himself with the world he stayed with God and he was not yoked up at the world the church that worships God today is yoked with Christ under the blood then we find that this heifer wants to be killed in the evening time in the presence of all of the church Ella easer wants to catch her blood upon his fingers and walk towards the door of the Tabernacle and sprinkled the blood seven times or otherwise put seven Stripes over the door of the congregation then the heifer was to be burned hoofs horns hide flesh and all and in this burning of the heifer it was to be mixed with Joseph yes if I'll be the better word fart pronounce that way hyssa scarlet and Cedarwood Scarlet in the scripture was wool off of a Rams back that was dyed red representing the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world was to be mixed into this because this would be the Waters of Separation to cleanse the unclean worshiper that he might be presented in the presence of God what are we basing trying to find the real true way to genuine fellowship with with God we've tried to do all kinds of things to make it educate organized but there's only one divine plan that's the blood outside the blood there's no Fellowship there's not even cleansing of sin until we get to the blood now notice then this wall died red represented Abel's Ram that he offered on the Block of stone in the garden outside the Garden of Eden for his sins what we took its little head and held it back and hacked it with a piece of rock I don't suppose they had any knives or lances in that date and hacked its little throat until the blood gushed out all over this little wolf and it died bleeding crying it symbolized the Son of God some 4 000 years later hanging on the cross bleeding his locks bleeding and he was dying crying my God my God why is I forsaken me that was a Scarlet that was put into the Waters of separation and then Cedarwood Cedarwood is red over White red through red makes life you look through something red add something red it makes it white assemble that when God looks through the red blood of his son the Lord Jesus at our red Scarlet sea and say become white as snow Wash Me In The Blood and I'll be as white as snow no other thing could you could you ever have I appreciate the old Salvation Army song oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow no other Fountain no nothing but the blood of Jesus that's the fountain that's filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins when Sinners plunged beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains the red to red and then I found searching to see what his supplies hyssop is just a common weed found in Egypt and all so it's found in Palestine and sometimes it grows out of the walls where the dirt it's just a common ordinary weed with a little blade on it with a little white flower and history was always used to sprinkle the blood in the days of the Passover Moses commanded to take discipline dip it in the blood and splashing upon the door posting on the little zip playing of the blood and hyssop being just a common weed in this Great Waters of Separation represents common faith the believer coming must not be some Supernatural oh I don't know what some kind of a fella that's so highly educated to leave hey God knows all more than Webster does and he doesn't have to be any great Theologian he just has to use common Faith the hyssop pick it up anywhere and it was all mixed together and burned and then it was kept outside the courts that the unclean before he could come into the fellowship I don't remember God always did and never will any other place but meet men under the blood that's the only place you have fellowship with God is under the blood you're only approaching until you get to that place all Israel gathered were the sacrificial lamb was killed and under that blood they had Fellowship outside the blood there was no Fellowship always has been God's provided program the meat man under the blood it's cause he looks at men through the blood and sees him white outside of that he's a sinner nothing you couldn't clean yourself there's nothing you could ever do to make yourself any better you cannot reforms and so forth do what just like a leopard kind of Licky spots off of him it just makes it brighter and all of our self-made ideas that we're just as good as the next man we are not until we've come beneath the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ tried that's God's only place of meeting man under the blood then when Israel come to the place of worship all going at a unclean person come first he had to come to the outer courts and this Blood of this water of separation which is called by the New Testament we are Washed by the Water of the word the Waters of separation is a word of God Faith cometh by hearing and this man coming in was sprinkled with this Waters of separation then like the sinner comes in and listens to the gospel he begins to realize condemnation he's a sinner he realizes that in this water separation is the Scarlet someone died for him an innocent substitute to bring him into worship and relationship with God again he realizes that he's out of the way by the preaching of the word I say this that the gospel yet in its Simplicity preached in the power of the blood is the greatest drawing card the world has ever known they're hungry today for power I've seen some time ago where a certain gasoline under a certain condition of a certain uh stiff leg would lift the Sphinx off the ground two foot and they were bragging about their gasoline us reading the magazine on a plane and I threw it back and said yes but praise God I know something more powerful than that that two thoughts of the blood of Jesus Christ so if the sinner that's lost and take a prostitute off the street and make a sight out of her take a conquer out of the gutters out there and make a saint of God a preacher of the Gospel that's what's the power of one drop of the blood of the Lord Jesus amen that's what the world needs no power today God's got a provided way and when the Gentile are the unclean person desired fellowship with God the first thing he had to do was come first to the Waters of Separation then be sprinkled now what does that represent or type the believer today the man that wants to believe comes to the church and listens to the gospel Christ died for sinners in their the red the Scarlet the Hasa fan he applies that with common faith that uh that a two-year-old child could use just believe on the Lord Jesus Christ there's so much of it today there's so many of us if someone says what can I do to be safe quit your line quit your stealing quit your smoking quit your drinking I believe they should do that too but that doesn't answer his question you're telling him what not to do he won't know what to do Paul said to the Philippine sailor he never told him to put up your sword and do all this another he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved thy and thy house please have faith how can I have that faith brother Brandon it's just as simple as reaching it in the house of the plow the blood believe it for yourself believe that Christ died for you believe that he was the innocent one that died in your place as a sinner and guilty same applies by Divine Healing just simple Faith to take him at his word or if they tried to complicate it to try to make it so great that's why the great Revival broke out in England then his church had it so complicated only they're educated could understand him and God when the church gets in that condition God always sends a Revival of Simplicity and breaks a thing to pieces it's right that's what we need today is the simpleness that's what the nation needs today is the Simplicity of faith in Christ to surrender themselves unselfishly with their whole heart soul and mind and all they are to the Lord Jesus just simple you don't have to learn nothing at all just believe that Jesus died to give you the blessing that it's yours by faith as soon as you pick up the house of faith and apply the blood something happens in every man's heart or a woman that does that hey man I feel religious right now yes sir because I know that that is the truth if it saved me it'll save anybody blood of Jesus Christ here's some years ago they had a religions of the world met I was reading in a book the address lady macby from Oklahoma here there's rest in our own might have been a toss or one of these places she was running through the street driving a stagecoach smoking a cigar breaking the speed limits for the stagecoach and when they all the religions different religions raised up and told their part of their religion how great it was the Muhammad priest told how great his religion was the Buddha told how great his religion must and a certain little Minister I can't call his name now is representing the religion out America Christian religion and when he got his time to the platform he told a story of this great final woman how low down she was to even they didn't want to get around her to even get close enough to a retired Senator she was so immoral she was so degraded there was nothing could help her then he said gentlemen all the religions of this world can your religion produce anything that would cleanse the hands of this certain vile person everybody sit still right on in their seats no one said nothing then he jumped in the air and screamed and kicked his heels together he said the blood of Jesus Christ will only clean her hands by the cleaner heart and make her as purely the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ takes away sin us from all of our iniquity and makes us new creatures in Christ Jesus nothing else will do it Creed's Farms or nothing else will take his place it's been trying but it takes the blood that's the only place for divine Fellowship is under the blood that's the only remedy God knows he faced it he's infinite what he says first he has to always remain with that through this program now when they have come to the courts realizing if they're defiled setting in the congregation knowing they're wrong by faith they apply the blood believe it accept it the water the washing of the Water by the word cleanses them then and makes them ready now here's where the thing comes here's where the point comes most people says when I believe that's all I have to do now there's where the rub comes the man that the Waters of Separation could not get enter into the holiest of holies he could not yet come into the congregation he accepted it believed it I believe it was for him and he was sprinkled but the Waters of Separation but as he went Journey on towards the place of Fellowship the first thing you had to meet there at the door was seven stripes for the seven Church ages of God in all ages nothing but the blood and he had to know that going on before him when a sacrifice please recognize the blood before he could come get communication not only when he come under this Blood and he walked into the congregation into the presence of the Shekinah Glory of God and then was in full Fellowship worshiping under the blood what a beautiful picture of Christ at Pentecost bringing his church into full Fellowship it's like the young couple that I was speaking of when they get married that's not the whole thing they haven't done nothing but taking a ceremony the minister has only said I pronounce you husband and wife it's not ready yet what does he do he takes her to his house that he's prepared for her now many people here might disagree with me by this but you don't live but in a three-room house or you may have many other rooms but you've really only got three rooms that is the kitchen the living room and the bedroom you may have three or four bedrooms and you may have a kitchen and a dining room and so forth but really a person only lives in a three-room house you live in a three-room house in your body soul body and spirit God lived in a three-room house father son Holy Ghost everything is in a three and a three is a triangle take a triangle and shine a light on it with where three meets in one place will produce seven different colors seven different colors is a rainbow the rainbow is a covenant oh it just keeps going on and on and on and on because in that God made a covenant through these three things the house of scarlet and so forth and the light of God shining upon this makes a covenant a covenant of God made now when the woman is brought the Young Bride all how he loves her but yet they're not truly in full Fellowship yet now the first thing what is the kitchen to do is where you eat that's like it is in the first course of the church you eat here come sit on the back seat listen to the word and the first thing you know you begin to oh God that meant me you accept him as your personal Savior by faith you grasp it then you begin to eat the word you begin to to feel that you have accepted Christ as your personal savior you begin to Feast upon the work you enjoyed or used to you to get up and walk out of the building a preacher didn't say something that suited you not right you get up and walk out but after you once accepted Christ you've been separated then the waters by the word of separation separated you from your evil thinking then the next thing comes is into the the living room were you take your little bride she takes her veil off you're coming a little closer then when you do your put your arms around her talk to her Embrace her that's how it comes into the Fellowship of the Lord Jesus before you do you are separated from your sins then you embrace the Lord's gospel you embrace the the written word you believe it with all your heart God it doesn't matter what you want me to do whatever you have planned in my life I'm ready now to receive it that's in the the living room then still you say isn't this far enough no sir the next room is the bedroom then when you go to this bedroom then if you come into fellowship and relationship you become into a relationship then you have complete Fellowship because you cannot have complete Fellowship until you become relationship anyone knows that I listen so is it with the church today we got two we got too many of them that's a shame they're going to complete relationship with God to New Life and new births if we're the bride of Christ then why can't we go into a relationship that all the shameness and backwardness all is gone from us if we come into complete relationship been born again I don't care the president of the United States could be standing on the street you'd shout hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah you don't care because you're coming to relationship you're born again you're a new child you're in the Shekinah Glory with god fellowshiping with him that's what the chart we need today brother is a worship under the blood a worship incomplete relationship to dial while the little bride said now wait a minute I I just I don't know uh I don't know what married life consists of such things he would never come into fellowship with her husband she could never come into a relationship or Fellowship until she first comes into a relationship that's what Samara at the church today and say oh I don't believe in that their kind of religion makes you shout and called a heartfelt religion and I don't believe in such things as that no wonder you've never come into it yet you into it and really get under the Shekinah Glory of God when the power of the Holy Ghost is falling down upon you you know something happened to your to you that life and become a new creature God is first how was it Charles Finney that time that made the statement about how I used to he was I believe it was Charles Finney that he had been preaching or someone he might not have been him I've just read it somewhere that he was the preaching he had sermons and two Little Women was praying for him and he would get the Holy Ghost and he told me he had the Holy Ghost and one day he went out behind the his office to pray and knelt down where an old tree had blowed down and while he was praying my stick broke he thought someone was coming up and he jumped up and said looked around he thought somebody's iron scene praying then he sat down and he said if I was talking to my boss in the office [Music] but here I'm ashamed of somebody to see me speak to my Lord there they come our conviction through all his coca Madison hatred and strong his fake cried out before God I told God feeling with the Holy Ghost then something happened he was different he got the starch out of him something taken place because he'd come into that kind of Glory into the relationship of God and fellowship divine hear the people into a fellowship for the Holy Spirit God whenever you get rid of that you're going back to babbling in you might as well bury yourself that's exactly right when we get to a place to where we get away from that kind of Glory that Praises of God that unfresh anointing that breaks down all the religious barriers and things that makes us one in Christ Jesus free for all condemnation that's what we need tonight that's what the church that's Divine Fellowship that's what I found in these conditions is places where men and women they are they're not ashamed they're not ashamed of the Gospel they're ready to testify saying about it shout about it I've even heard them speak in tongues once in a while don't hear too much of it no more but once in a while they do oh don't you never lose that if you ever lose that the place to where you get a shame to go into relationship with Christ let him dwell in you God and man making himself known to the People by his Spirit a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people ah different from the world blood and satisfied from the things that hey man that's old time sex for us preaching but it'll save a man from sin and I'll clean a person up and make them it won't white wash but it'll wash your white it'll take all this already from you I've seen a little woman so bashful the chance straight away let her go down the Altar and come into that Shekinah Glory God he'll stand there and testify they'll shake the shingles on top of the house sir while she's in presence of God she's met somebody that's real life has become a new thing and she's no more Countdown by the world because she's in Divine Fellowship of Christ for me to live is Christ said Paul that's what I call real spiritual that you cannot do that by your Creeds you cannot Creeds will never satisfy a hungry Soul they're all right I'm nothing gives them but what we need today is divine Fellowship there's only one way to get it to the ground into the Shekinah Glory in the Old Testament the high priest went in once the year once a year and that bearing the blood before him he was anointed oh I like to stay I was anointed with the with anointing or I believe David cried How Sweet It Is for a brother to dwell together in unity it's like the precious anointing oil that was on the the beard of Aaron it run all the way to the hymns of His Garment all makes things run easy soft you know when a man gets really anointed and ready for God oh no just like a always felt sorry for a Mew a a mule was the dumbest thing I ever looked at you can whistle to him call too many sticking his ears out and look at you he don't know the gentleness like a horse though see he he does he hasn't got that much gumption and another thing a mule he doesn't he doesn't know where he come from don't you never say God ever made a mule that was man did that no don't you put God guilty of something like that that was crossbreeding the the mayor to the the Jack but don't you never don't you never lay that on to God God wouldn't do a thing like that no sir you know I like a pretty pedigreed horse you know a pretty pedigree to horse he's really nice and he knows who his papa was he knows where his mama was he knows exactly where he's standing but an old mule don't know who his papa was his mama was and here's another thing about it he cannot cross himself back again he's ruined for life but it's been about a lot of it puts an amount of a lot of people that call themselves Christians talk about the blood of Jesus said with their ears out set her like Buckeye they don't even know what the call means that's right you don't know who your papa was or your mama was but I'm telling you if you've ever come under the real Divine Fellowship been baptized with the Holy Ghost you know who your father you know where you're standing standing in all the good you know the holy spirit that barns you and give you new life you know where you come from you know who your father is we got too much new Religion Today I believe uh I really believe it no dishonor the high priest once the year went in one time a year with the blood before him I'm worshiped in the Shekinah Glory all anointed oh I love that anointed walking and he had garment on that had a pomegranate in the bell and he had to walk but that is such a step that played holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy unto the Lord packing the blood before him as he went what a beautiful picture of the church today walking into the and you know the reason he made them Bells the people on the outside didn't know where he was alive or not unless he's making some noise I'm telling you brother a dead Church don't make any noise Something's Happened yes sir they haven't entered that holy holy God is over where you find God you find a lot of noise it's exactly right when Jesus went into Jerusalem they broke down palms and Galilean peasants begin to sing Hosanna to him that cometh in the name of the Lord some of those Pharisees said oh that makes Shields got my back that's sacrilegious oh don't you do make him hold your feet Jesus said if they hold their piece of rock so let me do they cry has to take place when Christ comes in but he took the blood to the mercy seat and only he alone could go in once a year but when Jesus died on the day of the atonement he rent the panel in two not only a high priest but whosoever will may come anytime in a glory of Glory isn't of the Holy Ghost into a real Pentecostal Fellowship amen into a place in the presence of God for the power of God cleanses us from all unrighteousness we become new creatures in Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost falls upon us and all of our backwardness and shameness we become into relationship with God isn't the church the bride well shouldn't the bride be bringing forth children you're crying have our father Wonder we can't produce ourselves anymore if we ever get away from that Shekinah Glory get away from there and don't know who your papa is don't know who your mama is out from under the blood Pentecostal grandchildren is David duplicitous call it God don't have any grandchildren no sir God only has Sons somebody's like I said here sometimes always talk about David said people come in the Methodist has come in they were born sons of God then there are children they take them to church and well because I was a Methodist and my children is a Methodist now that's not really children that's grandchildren see but now God don't have any grandchildren every man every woman every boy got to have an experience of entering in to the holiest of Holiness and being born again it's too bad the Pentecostal church is getting that way too we got some Pentecostal grandchildren let me tell you God don't have any the church has it but God don't have it every man that comes to God's got to come to the blood ever by every girl that's because something went before him to die for him before they can come into that Shekinah Glory be clean from a life of sin and become amen how he entered into this holy place the whole is of the holies to offer this Blood job the oldest book in the Bible even before Genesis has ever wrote job lived on the earth and you remember job all of his troubles all of his trials and his friends even accusing him his friends against him yet job maintained the the promise of God he maintained the fellowship in the hours of trial in so much that he cried he said I know my redeemer liveth when he was suffering and even his wife said job why don't you curse God and die job was under the blood he'd offer the burnt sacrifice which he knowed he was righteous because that's what God required he'd come under the blood and had Divine fellowship with God even in the last hours of his great Temptation he cried me yeah I'll trust him hey man that's what the church needs today is a no soul Fellowship under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ even death can't even darken it out I stood by the bedside watch them die with a cold handshake I've seen him standing here and die shouting the Praises of God because it had Fellowship they knowed where they were standing oh how I could go through experiences of knowing of experiences I've seen with people how they don't never don't never try to get to God anything other than under the fellowship under the uh to fellowship with God but under the blood that's the only way God knows that's the only way God will recognize you must first be Washed by the Water of the word then cleanse through the blood and enter into the Shekinah Glory go into there into the fellowship then you know where you're standing at Daniel another one it's perfect in his heart he wouldn't defile himself for the king's meat when he was taken down into Babylon he maintained his Fellowship in the presence of lines that was ready to kill you yesterday Daniel held his Fellowship God sent an angel and stood by in that night and blood of the eyes and shut the mouth of the line because Daniel had fellowship with the supernatural Daniel had Fellowship for the god of Heaven because he was under the blood that's how he maintained his stand the Hebrew children right in the middle of the fire furnace no matter what you do to him UK Scorch that Fellowship away from him you can't throw him under enough trials to make him denied a man that's ever been under the blood of Jesus Christ and become filled with the Holy Ghost all the devils in Hell couldn't root it out of him before he's saying if you felt like I did you'd jump up in your seat and do the same thing but listen brother a baby that's born and don't cry don't whimper there's something wrong with that baby it's born dead that's right that's what's the matter there's too much of the churches today too much of the people call themselves Christians they are born dead still birth it's no good what they need to know what the doctor doesn't want to make a whimper he picks him up and turns him over and gives him a couple of good reps and he lets out a Squall that's what the church sees today is another good old time Holy Ghost baptism shaken of the church tell her to spank all the world out of it get it back to real Pentecost so blessing a real preacher that'll stand up and take the gospel and beat the whole the golden like the old beaters used to they'd beat the gold and turn it over and beat till all the drosses out of it how do you know it was ready when he could see his own reflection in it then he know the goal was ready the dross is out of it that's what the Holy Spirit does by the word it beats all the world out of the church until the refresh of Jesus Christ appears into the church and the people when God can see his reflection of his power like he did on the day of Pentecost when he sent the Holy Ghost down and the power of God made the people jump like new wine and they said what are these men full of new wine he said this is that which is spoken by the prophet Joel it'll come to pass the last day saith God I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy I'll show wonders in the heavens above and in the earth below signs and pillars of fire and smoking paper it shall come to pass before the noble day of the Lord shall come notable day whosoever call upon the name the Lord shall be saved what we need is a beating beating people back in backers to straighten the church up to pull it out of the Kate said it's in and come back under the Fellowship of the blood again into Shekinah Glory into a Pentecostal experience like ahead back many many years ago like we used to have years ago but we need like we did in the days of John Wesley way back in the days of Calvin not way back all the way to Pentecost what we need is a relationship again with God so men are waiting to die out to themselves in the secret chamber with God until New Life is produced until they become a new creature let a man do that if he's a little coward he'll go out and win souls because why he's becoming Divine relationship with God in the secret room to himself with him and God is Anointed and went in there with tears rolling over his cheeks and saying God give me the Holy Spirit I don't care if it costs my wife my children my girlfriend my everyone I am just fill me Lord till I can stand in your presence and feel the Shekinah Glory moving surging over me and through me thankfulness Mr Iverson Ned's father wrote that famous song a spirit of God moving me that's what we need move fresh fall upon me Lord stand there until God takes you in to the holiest of holies shuts the curtains behind you shut the world out and shut you up with Christ so you don't care who's around what else about it you're walking in the spirit led by the spirit doing the things the spirit would have you to do saying the things the spirit have you to say that's when you come into Divine Fellowship may God grant that to everyone yes the Hebrew children right in the middle of the fiery furnace they still maintain their Fellowship the five furnace didn't stop it stop it certainly not they still had just as much Fellowship as they ever had little Stevens after he had come under the blood and stood there and preached until his face shine like an angel I don't believe it shine like one of those lights certainly not an angel isn't that don't always have to meet a Shining Light an angel is a messenger somebody that knows what they're talking about I believe when Stephen stood up there that morning at the Saint Hadrian courts when they had him kind of condemn him and so forth he said which one of your fathers has and condemned the holy ghost or turn it away which one of them did you said you stiff that's uncircumcised the heart and ears knowing it would cost his life why did he care he knows what he was talking about why he'd come out of the blood and been up there Pentecost and his other Shekinah Glory and he didn't care what anyone said mean nothing to it you're so sure and so filled with the spirit until they begin to run up on me nice your teeth and vest uh break his head in with the rocks and things like that even death didn't even hide his Fellowship he raised his hands and said I see Jesus amen now you'll be Baptist shout we'll show you in a minute let me tell you brother even death Kanata could not hide it death could not do nothing you couldn't hide him from the fellowship because he's still maintained that perfect fellowship with Christ even the Rocks has beaten his head in he and Paul stand their soul it was then holding his garments looking at it it never did get away from him he's seen that that man had something although he was so full of Creeds and Theology and learned stuff though he looked at that man and he's seen that man had something his Creeds didn't produce he's seen the glory of God upon his face when Stevens looked up and said I see Jesus standing at the right hand of God still having Fellowship in the hour of his death because he come by God's appropriated way by the blood of Jesus Christ and it enter into the Shekinah Glory where real Fellowship was real Fellowship the Praises and powers of God Romans 5 1 saying therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God Fellowship restored all our love had fellowship with God peace restored back wow through the blood of the Lord Jesus in my own City in Louisville Kentucky some few months ago there's an old fellow there that thought he was just an old bum he um he'd get out tracks and then he's down on the street and he was crossing one day he lived a little shady down close to the slummy part of the city there and what we call a Haymarket and he was uh lived down there but he done a great work going around giving out um little tracks it's true his clothes wasn't always as neat as I guess it could have been he's an old Bachelor and he was crossing the street one day in an automobile just struck him and just I looked like broke every bone and him roll right over him and they got him in an ambulance to the police ambulance and taking him up there to a certain Hospital and they began to examine him the city hospital they looked at his bones and so many bones they and they put the X-ray over him and found out his all broke up and the doctors went to hold a little counsel a little Fellowship among themselves over in one corner they thought the old fellow was out they said well the doctors come to this decision it's not worth our time after all he's nothing but just a bum and there's no money in it so it's nothing but just a bum so why would we waste our time here all day long trying to patch up that old bum and they thought there wasn't they decide they just covering back over and let him go but when they walked over there he wasn't as dead as they thought they were is that just a minute gentlemen he said I am worth something too his eyes were so much so God sent his son that he might die in my place and give me a Grace and a fellowship with him years ago I embraced that to my heart real fellowship with God he said and right now it's sweeter than it ever was in all my life he said sure I'm worth something God so lovely that he gave his son for me and he shed his blood that I might come into a fellowship with him in his sufferings and in his presence and he said I have maintained that all these years and now it's sweeter than it ever was you can imagine the embarrassments on those doctors faces at that time sure you're worth something each one of these worth something God gave his life for you why can't you give yours for his why can't you dedicate yourself in time all together come if you stay away if you don't come the right approach now if you just go and start turn over a new Leaf that won't work you've got to come God's way come under the blood then get into Shekinah Glory in the presence of God then you can Worship the Lord God sure Psalm 1900 years ago over Calgary let's take a little view for a few minutes as we're passing on it was one a horrible morning oh there never was a morning and never will be like that they've been a trial that morning a mock trial in the courts I had an innocent man had been condemned and I see now I hear an old something bumping over the street going out towards Calvary and as a look there was a little fella the Bible said there's not no beauty that we should desire him he had a cross on his shoulders the blood streaked across his back in a mocking crown of thorns on his face in the spittle of the cruel drunken soldiers hanging off his face dragging down the street the whole cross dragging out the bloody Footprints of the barrier as he starts up the mountain I sees garment is soaked in blood splashing against the sides of his leg a sight that no man had ever known what that man could look at it his remain the same there he was oh the devil always doubted him the devil thought he was just a prophet the devil was sure the end of that was just a prophet because how could God ever let somebody spit in his face how could God ever be beat into into a pub why it was the same reason it couldn't be a prophet it couldn't be an angel it had to be God who come to Honey's Lost Child In the Garden of Eden did he send an angel did he send a prophet he came himself that's how God Came manifested In the Flesh in the person of his son Jesus Christ here he goes up the hill pulling the cross and that bee of death began to buzz around him then I you know I seen him up there he quoted some scripture to me but I'm sure now he's nothing but a man because look could God let somebody spit in his face and get by with it he did it for your sake he did it he didn't have to do it but he did it for my sake and your sake he did it that he might sanctify and cleanse us from sin he might give us an example of how to be humble and how to live right how to offer the other cheek or go to the second mile or or give the quote to the brother that needed it he practiced what religion was a Jehovah's religion he he had it in him and there he was going up the hill I see that old bumblebee of death whirling around him looking him over good said look at there could God ever be that could that be Emmanuel certainly not it could not be he never let somebody spit in his face and put a mocking Crown of Thorns over his head and give him a false scepter in his hand and beat his back into a pup you don't have something about a prophet he's done me a lot of trouble so I'll certainly get him in a few minutes at Calvary let me tell you brother when he made his buzz and stung him at Calvary something happened when he anchored that Stinger into Emmanuel's flesh you don't want a bee stings deep he pulls his stinger out when he comes and when he stung that time he stung more than a prophet he stung Emmanuel what was it he left his stinger in there today to the Christian believer that comes under that blood that he shed their calorie under the Divine Fellowship the real Full Gospel Pentecostal fellow ship with the Pentecostal blessings and Pentecostal signs and Pentecostal lives Pentecostal attributes when you come out of that death doesn't have any Stinger anymore it can buzz and Buzz I know a cruel hook knows Jew at one time bitter and indifferent Stone Stevens is on his road down to Damascus one day and fell under the power of God what happened he came into the place to come into that Divine fellowship with the Son of God one day down in Rome they was building a sacrifice block to cut his head off for public execution under the Roman government and when he was ready to die that bee come down and starts humming around him but you know what he said he said oh B worries your stinger oh grave or is your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us a victory through our Lord Jesus Christ what was it even an hour of his death he still maintained that Fellowship that he had found up there in that Pentecostal blessing they were one of the Pentecostal disciples that was up there maintained that Fellowship right on down through trials tribulations nothing could separate them from the love of God that was in Christ and today there's only one basis for real genuine Fellowship that Fellowship is Full Gospel Fellowship when a man has come through the waters of Separation recognize the blood for the cleansing and come into the Shekinah Glory then you're in real genuine Pentecostal Full Gospel Fellowship then you're not ashamed Christ or is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth amen amen it's a good oh you might say it's just the ABCs but that's what it takes I always believe Christ through the blood we can come into His presence [Music] through the blood we can come into His presence through the blood [Music] Jesus Christ has made the way we can come into His presence through the blood through the blood through the blood we can come into His presence through the blood Jesus Christ has made no way we can come into His presence through [Music] you know it's in a sense it sounds too simple it sounds too easy there's got to be something that I can do to to Merit it to earn something of it all he asks is for you to come and accept what he's done you know and it's sometimes it's just hard it's his grace it's his Mercy to us once you've gotten to know him once you've you've he's he's become real to you and there are some times that maybe it gets it it Slips Away a little bit but you just know where to go back to to get back into that presence [Music] of Jehovah God almighty friends [Music] and hearts are mended in the presence of the king oh in the presence of Jehovah God almighty [Music] Prince of Peace [Music] and hearts are mended [Music] in the presence [Music] you know when you get into his presence Life Changes things change as we're singing that the thought Aaron's Bud his his staff taken into her the Shekinah Glory of God was and left there and when the priest came back a year later it had butted it had given life and in his presence sometimes you might think yourself what what good I am there's nothing there's nothing good about me get into his presence and let him begin to bring his life and the evidence and the fruit of it will be God's word everything that he has said about you yes sister
