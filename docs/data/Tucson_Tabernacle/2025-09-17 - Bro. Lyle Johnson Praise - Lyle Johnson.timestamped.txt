[0:06] Oh, I can face tomorrow
[0:12] because
[0:14] he lives.
[0:15] [Music]
[0:18] All fear is gone
[0:24] because I know
[0:29] [Music]
[0:31] he holds the future
[0:36] and life is worth the living
[0:42] just because he lives. Verse one,
[0:49] God sent his son.
[0:54] Oh, they called him Jesus.
[1:01] He came to love,
[1:07] heal, and forgive.
[1:13] He lived and died
[1:20] to buy my pardon.
[1:26] An empty grave is there to prove my
[1:33] savior

[1:58] All fear is gone
[2:04] because I know
[2:09] [Music]
[2:10] he holds the future
[2:14] [Music]
[2:16] and life is worth the living just
[2:23] because he lives. And then one day,
[2:27] let's sing that verse. And then one day,
[2:32] [Music]
[2:34] oh, I'll cross that river.
[2:41] I'll fight life's fine
[2:47] over
[2:49] with pain
[2:53] and fed as death
[2:59] gives way to victory.
[3:05] I'll see the lights of gloryy
[3:10] and I'll know he reigns.
[3:17] Oh, because
[3:19] he lives
[3:23] I can face tomorrow.
[3:27] [Music]
[3:30] Because
[3:31] he lives,
[3:36] all fear is gone
[3:42] because I know
[3:48] he holds.
[3:51] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[3:54] And life is worth the living
[3:59] just because he lives.
[4:03] [Music]
[4:05] And life is worth the living
[4:10] just because
[4:13] he lives. One more time.
[4:17] And life is worth the living
[4:23] just because
[4:25] he lives.
[4:30] Key of G.
[4:34] Jesus is the answer
[4:38] for the world today.

[4:47] Jesus is the way.
[4:52] Jesus is the answer
[4:56] for the world today.

[6:16] Brother Daniel's going to open up in
[6:17] prayer. That message was true when the
[6:20] apostles first preached it. It was true
[6:22] 50 years ago when Andre Crouch wrote
[6:24] that song. And it's true today. One more
[6:28] time. Jesus is the answer
[6:34] for the world today.
[6:38] Above him there's no other.
[6:42] Jesus is the way.
[6:46] Jesus is the answer
[6:50] for the world today.
[6:54] above him there's no other
[7:00] way.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I I appreciate it when like
[7:05] brother Josiah just did when he gives a
[7:07] little background to that that song. I
[7:11] I didn't know that. I didn't know the
[7:13] author of that song. We've all sang it
[7:14] before, but it's nice sometimes to get a
[7:17] little background. It'sif song that's 50
[7:20] years old written by what' you say?
[7:22] Andrew Crouch. Andre Crouch.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Andre Crouch.
[7:26] Welcome. Is your name Isaac in the back?
[7:30] Welcome. Welcome. It's uh it's good to
[7:32] have you.
[7:36] God bless you. And uh who uh was it
[7:40] Debbie that invited you to come tonight?
[7:43] Well, welcome. We're honored to have
[7:45] you. It's good to have you. We have a
[7:47] Where is There you are. hiding over in
[7:49] the side. Um it's good to have you,
[7:52] brother. We we have a Bible study
[7:54] usually on Wednesday night. We've um
[7:57] taken the subject of praise and worship
[8:01] that our brother Josiah here started
[8:03] last week and we're going to continue on
[8:06] this evening with Lyall Johnson, one of
[8:08] our ministers here with that subject. I
[8:11] um
[8:13] appreciate appreciate our ministry here,
[8:15] Tabernacle. Appreciate our leadership.
[8:23] [Applause]
[8:25] My little girl's here. She's holding my
[8:27] grandbaby for another couple months.
[8:34] I can't wait till I can hold it.
[8:35] Sweetheart,
[8:38] God bless you. I don't uh brothers, I
[8:40] didn't get any prayer requests. Are
[8:41] there any any in the back? So we don't
[8:43] have any written requests and but
[8:45] friends let's never take it for granted
[8:49] that we can raise our hand in the name
[8:52] of Jesus Christ if we have something on
[8:54] our hearts and that he will look down
[8:57] and he will see that we made the effort
[8:59] to raise a hand and then we can rest
[9:02] assured that he saw it and that he will
[9:04] answer.
[9:06] So, let's bow our heads
[9:09] and friends, if you have a request on
[9:12] your heart that you would make known to
[9:15] the Lord Jesus, lift up your hand with a
[9:19] prayer request in your heart and hold it
[9:22] before him as we approach his throne.
[9:26] Almighty God,
[9:30] Lord, you look down upon our little
[9:34] gathering tonight.
[9:37] And Lord, how many gatherings like this
[9:40] have there been throughout history where
[9:44] you have made yourself known, Lord, and
[9:46] you have answered prayers.
[9:49] Lord, we lift these requests up before
[9:52] you in the name of Jesus Christ,
[9:53] according to your word.
[9:56] And as is it is written in the book of
[9:58] John spoken by Jesus himself and said if
[10:03] you ask anything in my name I will do
[10:06] it.
[10:08] Father we bring these requests before
[10:09] you in the name of Jesus Christ and ask
[10:12] that you would father meet the needs
[10:15] that we have. We love you and we pray
[10:18] that your blessings would be be upon our
[10:20] service tonight in Jesus name. Amen.

[14:59] God.
[15:03] There is none
[15:05] like you.
[15:26] I have a little testimony to share.
[15:32] In January,
[15:35] the Lord healed me when we were singing.
[15:37] I was at brother Israel's and they sang
[15:39] only believe.
[15:41] And the presence of the Lord swept
[15:43] through there and he healed me instantly
[15:45] of something that I was asking him to. I
[15:47] just felt it in my body. It was just
[15:50] really supernatural. But we were singing
[15:52] only believe. And um the Lord,
[15:57] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[15:58] forever. and he's my God
[16:02] and he's so supernatural and so
[16:04] personal.
[16:06] So sing it with me if you will.
[16:14] [Music]
[16:30] All things are possible
[16:36] only.
[16:41] [Music]
[16:54] All things are possible

[17:17] from
[17:19] into

[17:31] in earth.
[17:33] All power
[17:36] above
[17:37] [Music]
[17:39] is given
[17:45] [Music]
[17:47] his love.
[17:51] Lord,
[17:52] I believe.
[17:56] Lord,
[17:58] I believe.
[18:03] All things are possible.
[18:08] Lord, I
[18:11] believe.
[18:14] Lord,
[18:16] I believe.
[18:20] Lord,
[18:21] I believe.

[18:31] Lord I be
[18:37] fear not
[18:39] little
[18:43] he go
[18:46] ahead
[18:48] your sheer
[18:51] selected
[18:53] the path you
[18:59] Theers
[19:02] of my
[19:04] feeling
[19:07] for thee.
[19:10] He drank all
[19:13] the
[19:16] blessing
[19:18] me.

[20:14] Whatever
[20:16] your light,
[20:19] he enters
[20:22] or
[20:25] doors being
[20:28] locked.
[20:30] He never
[20:33] forsakes.
[20:38] is gone.
[20:41] So count on his presence
[20:46] in darkness
[20:49] and
[20:53] Jesus
[20:55] is here.
[20:58] Jesus
[21:00] is here.

[22:13] All things are possible.
[22:16] [Music]
[22:18] Lord, I receive.
[22:29] Thank you, sister.
[22:33] you'd all stand as brother Lyall's going
[22:34] to come. I didn't have this one back
[22:37] there, but can you can you put up the
[22:38] lyrics to Above All
[22:42] [Music]
[22:48] whenever something bad or tragic
[22:49] happens, it's always really sad and
[22:54] you get to thinking about what the Lord
[22:55] did.
[22:58] He was above everyone. He was more
[23:01] powerful.
[23:03] The perfect mighty God.
[23:05] [Music]
[23:07] Didn't even get a Jewish death. Didn't
[23:10] even get a Jewish stoning at the temple.
[23:12] Got hung on a on a cross by pagans
[23:16] and suffered and died.
[23:19] [Music]
[23:21] There's no way to measure what he did
[23:22] for us.
[23:27] Above all powers,
[23:32] above all kings,
[23:36] above all nature
[23:39] and all created things,
[23:43] [Music]
[23:45] above all wisdom
[23:48] and all the ways of men.
[23:53] Think of this.
[23:55] Oh, you were here before the world
[24:00] began. Above all kingdoms,
[24:03] above all kingoms,
[24:06] [Music]
[24:08] above all thrones.
[24:10] [Music]
[24:12] Above all wonders
[24:15] the world has ever known.
[24:18] [Music]
[24:27] There's no way to measure.
[24:29] [Music]
[24:38] Crucified,
[24:40] [Music]
[24:43] laid behind a stone.
[24:47] You live
[24:48] to die.
[24:51] You checked it and alone.
[24:57] [Music]
[25:02] You took the fall
[25:06] and thought of me
[25:11] above all. Let's sing those verses
[25:14] again. Above all powers,
[25:17] [Music]
[25:18] above all kings,
[25:22] above all nature
[25:25] and all created things,
[25:30] above all wisdom
[25:33] and all the ways of man.
[25:38] Oh yes, you were here before the world
[25:43] began. Above all kingdoms, above all
[25:48] kingoms,
[25:50] above all thrones,
[25:54] above all wonders the world has ever
[25:59] known.
[26:02] Above all wealth
[26:05] and treasures of the earth,
[26:11] there's no way to measure what your
[26:15] worth.
[26:19] Crucified,
[26:23] laid behind the stone.
[26:27] You live
[26:29] to die.
[26:31] Rejected and alone
[26:34] like a rose
[26:37] trampled on the ground.
[26:42] You took the fall
[26:45] and thought of me
[26:50] above all.
[26:52] [Music]
[26:57] Thank you. Such love. Such love that he
[27:03] would do that not only for all of us but
[27:06] for each of us.
[27:10] Wonder if we could get the uh first
[27:12] slide up.
[27:16] I hope you all can read that.
[27:19] Good evening. It's so good to be back
[27:21] with you, Heather. and I
[27:26] I'm glad to be back with you.
[27:30] Heather and I were gone for several
[27:32] weeks visiting family in Washington and
[27:34] Oregon. Started with a wedding, then
[27:37] multiple birthdays, including twin
[27:39] grandsons turning 18, ending with
[27:43] Heather's oldest sibling turning 80.
[27:47] And in the midst of all of it, we were
[27:49] able to see and hold our newest great
[27:51] grandchild, Suie Anne Johnson, when she
[27:54] was less than a day old and pray with
[27:56] her and her parents in the hospital
[27:59] room. So, it was a wonderful trip,
[28:02] but we're so glad to be back.
[28:06] Last Wednesday evening, as our pastor
[28:08] mentioned, Brother Josiah AO started a
[28:11] series on praise and worship.
[28:14] The thoughts I want to share this
[28:15] evening are on the same topic. Praise
[28:18] and worship.
[28:20] Praise of the Lord, I think, is always a
[28:23] form of worship.
[28:25] Worship of the Lord doesn't always
[28:28] include praise.
[28:30] Or does it?
[28:33] Before we read our opening scriptures,
[28:35] let's start by uniting our hearts once
[28:37] more in prayer.
[28:41] Lord Jesus, it's such an honor to be
[28:43] here.
[28:45] Lord, to be among the people that you
[28:47] died for, that you paid the ultimate
[28:49] price.
[28:52] Lord, it's it's a responsibility to be
[28:55] here. Lord, I pray that you would help
[28:58] the the thoughts that are to be
[29:00] expressed this evening, Lord, to be the
[29:02] way you want them to be expressed, to be
[29:04] the thoughts you want expressed, that
[29:05] they would be heard in the way that you
[29:07] want them to be heard, Lord. Lord, I
[29:09] thank you so much for our musicians and
[29:11] worship leaders, Lord, to help set the
[29:13] atmosphere, to help us set aside the
[29:16] weights of this world and the troubles
[29:18] and the thoughts and the concerns, Lord,
[29:20] that we can just focus our attention,
[29:23] our hearts, our lives, our souls, our
[29:25] spirits on you. That's our desire this
[29:28] evening, Lord, to worship you, to praise
[29:30] you, to exalt you, to lift you up. Lord,
[29:33] be with us this evening. Forgive us,
[29:35] Lord, and forgive me for we've fallen
[29:38] short, Lord. Cleanse my heart. Cleanse
[29:41] my thoughts, Lord. We're here to worship
[29:44] you. We love you, Lord Jesus. Thank you.
[29:48] Amen.
[29:55] This image is of the Hebrew text from
[29:58] the Lengrad Codeex of the very first
[30:01] time a word translated as praise occurs
[30:05] in the Bible. I I've enclosed the word
[30:08] in a box. I'm sure you can read it. It
[30:09] says Odette.
[30:12] Any guesses
[30:14] as to who uttered this first recorded
[30:19] praise of the Lord?
[30:21] It was I'll tell you later.
[30:27] Our topic verses are found in the book
[30:29] of Genesis chapter 29. The context is
[30:32] that of Jacob. He's fled from the wrath
[30:35] of Esau because Jacob in conjunction
[30:38] with his mom had deceived his father
[30:40] Isaac into giving Jacob the blessing of
[30:43] the firstborn. Jacob ran away. He
[30:46] settled in Syria. Jacob's working for
[30:49] his uncle Laban and after seven years
[30:52] has been allowed to marry Laban's
[30:54] daughter, Jacob's own first cousin.
[30:57] He thought he was marrying Rachel, but
[31:00] woke up to find her older sister, Leia,
[31:03] next to him.
[31:06] Jacob and Laban then worked out an
[31:09] additional seven-year obligation, and
[31:11] Jacob married Rachel a week after
[31:13] marrying Leia.
[31:15] Not a happy situation.
[31:18] But remember, our study is about praise
[31:21] and worship.
[31:23] What's going on? Let's read from Genesis
[31:26] 29 starting at verse 30.
[31:30] And Jacob went in also unto Rachel, and
[31:32] he loved also Rachel more than Leia, and
[31:36] served with Laban yet seven other years.
[31:41] And when the Lord saw that Leia was
[31:43] hated, now some translations say she was
[31:46] despised or she was unloved. But the
[31:49] Hebrew word sane literally means hate.
[31:55] When the Lord saw that Leia was hated,
[31:57] the Lord opened Leia's womb.
[32:00] But Rachel was barren, unable to become
[32:03] pregnant. And Leia conceived and bare a
[32:07] son. And she called his name Reuben.
[32:11] Look, a son. Jacob, you're a dad. You
[32:16] have an heir. Your firstborn is a son.
[32:20] She said, "Surely the Lord has looked
[32:24] upon my affliction. Now therefore,
[32:26] because of this birth, my husband will
[32:29] love me."
[32:33] conceived again and bare a son and said,
[32:37] "Because the Lord has heard that I was
[32:41] hated, he hath therefore given me this
[32:43] son also." She called his name Simeon.
[32:47] She
[32:48] means to hear or be heard.
[32:53] and Leia conceived again and bare a son
[32:57] and said, "Now this time will my husband
[33:00] be joined unto me because I have borne
[33:03] him three sons." Therefore, his name was
[33:06] called, we say Levi, it's Levie
[33:10] means joined to note Moses the greatest
[33:15] prophet of the Old Testament was
[33:17] descended from this Levi
[33:20] as were the priests which ministered.
[33:23] ministered to the Lord and the Levites
[33:25] which took care of the tabernacle and
[33:27] later the temple and all of its
[33:28] instruments.
[33:30] They're all descended from this third
[33:32] psalm.
[33:34] But wait, there's more. You may be
[33:37] thinking, "Brother Wild. Why read about
[33:40] an unhappy marriage? What does this have
[33:44] to do with praise and worship?"
[33:50] And Leia conceived again.
[33:52] and bear a son.
[33:55] And notice the change in her attitude.
[33:59] She said, "Now will I praise the Lord."
[34:04] Praising the Lord, one of our topics.
[34:06] Therefore, she called his name Judah.
[34:10] Yehuda,
[34:11] praise,
[34:13] and left bearing.
[34:15] Please be seated.
[34:19] So, so back to our question, who was the
[34:23] first to offer praise to God that's
[34:26] recorded in the Bible? Was it Adam, the
[34:28] first human communed with God every
[34:31] evening until the fall? Abel, the first
[34:35] to offer a sacrifice that God accepted.
[34:38] Seth, Enoch, who walked with God and was
[34:42] not.
[34:43] Noah, who survived the flood by careful
[34:46] obedience.
[34:48] Abraham, who received the promises of
[34:50] God.
[34:52] Isaac, the the patriarch who never left
[34:55] the promised land. Jacob, whose name was
[34:58] changed to Israel and was the progenator
[35:00] of the nation. Were any of these the
[35:03] first to offer praise to God?
[35:07] No.
[35:09] The first recording of praise to the
[35:11] Lord in the entire Bible. The first use
[35:13] of the word is attributed to Leia, the
[35:17] hated, unwanted spouse of Jacob.
[35:22] Do a word search on praise if you want
[35:24] to verify this.
[35:26] If somebody told me that, I'd do a word
[35:28] search. I'm such a trusting guy.
[35:32] I want to draw your attention to the
[35:34] sequence. Here's a woman who was snuck
[35:38] into Jacob's marriage bed after his
[35:40] father-in-law Laban made sure Jacob was
[35:42] drunk and the night was dark.
[35:46] How do you suppose Jacob felt when he
[35:48] woke up?
[35:51] And to our point, how do you think Leia
[35:54] felt knowing she was being substituted
[35:58] for her little sister?
[36:00] Knowing Jacob didn't want her from the
[36:02] outset of his sojurnn with her family,
[36:05] being ignored by him for seven years as
[36:08] he gazed with longing on her baby
[36:10] sister. Rachel this and Rachel that.
[36:14] Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.
[36:16] When Reuben was born, Leia says the Lord
[36:20] has looked on her affliction. The fact
[36:22] that her husband was using her but hates
[36:25] her. Thinks that by bearing him a son,
[36:27] Jacob will realize what a treasure she
[36:29] is. and will genuinely love her.
[36:33] She's hurting.
[36:35] She's looking for comfort, soulless,
[36:39] wanting love from her mate.
[36:42] Didn't happen.
[36:44] No. Okay, time for sidebar.
[36:47] It didn't happen till many years later.
[36:50] Remember, Jacob had fled home because he
[36:52] stole the blessing of the firstborn from
[36:54] Esau. Later, Reuben, Jacob's firstborn
[36:57] and possessor of the birthright, will
[37:00] sacrifice his birthright and stain his
[37:02] blessing of the firstborn, the things
[37:04] that Jacob so highly valued to force
[37:07] Jacob to finally give Leia her proper
[37:10] place.
[37:12] And we read the result at the end of
[37:14] Genesis where Jacob asks to be buried in
[37:17] the family tomb to be laid beside
[37:21] Leia.
[37:24] reminds us of the story of David's
[37:26] selection as Saul's successor. The part
[37:30] where God tells Samuel to not see as man
[37:32] sees, but God looks on the heart. Saul
[37:36] was descended from Rachel. David was
[37:39] descended from Leia.
[37:41] Sorry for the distraction. I can't help.
[37:44] I love that part of the story.
[37:46] Well, back back to our topic with son
[37:50] number two. Leia confesses she's still
[37:52] hated, but knows that God has heard of
[37:55] her plight.
[37:57] Leia is still focused on her situation.
[38:01] Completely understandable,
[38:03] 100% human
[38:05] with son number three. She's still
[38:08] looking to be joined to her husband.
[38:10] Joined in heart, I think, is a safe
[38:13] interpretation of her desire, of her
[38:14] longing.
[38:16] But look what happens with son number
[38:22] At last, Leia looks beyond her personal
[38:26] situation,
[38:27] her pain. It hasn't changed. Jacob's
[38:31] still a rotten husband regarding her.
[38:34] Maybe she's given up on him ever truly
[38:36] loving her, but her expression is no
[38:39] longer one of despair.
[38:42] Her hope is no longer towards Jacob.
[38:45] In the midst of her ongoing affliction
[38:48] and longing, she turns to the Lord. Not
[38:52] as an agent to correct her predicament.
[38:54] Lord, please make my husband love me.
[38:56] No, but to praise the Lord in spite of
[39:00] her circumstances,
[39:02] to look to him for what she needs, not
[39:07] as the agent, but as the solution.
[39:12] Let's look at the name she gives to this
[39:15] fourthborn.
[39:17] Judah, we say in English, Yahuda in
[39:21] Hebrew, the the one word interpretation
[39:23] is praise.
[39:25] This Bible study, we can go deeper than
[39:28] one word. So, let's let's dig a little
[39:30] bit. The root word of this name is yada,
[39:35] a verb. In its most primitive form, it
[39:38] means to throw or shoot or cast.
[39:41] The noun form of this word is yad, which
[39:44] is hand, which kind of suggests why we
[39:46] like to raise our hands when we praise
[39:49] the Lord.
[39:51] Depending on how it is used in a
[39:53] sentence and its verb form, it's used in
[39:55] the Bible in four different ways.
[39:56] There's a simple active form like
[39:59] raising your hand. There's an intensive
[40:02] act of like throwing something, casting
[40:05] down your crown. There's a a causitive
[40:09] action like saying thank you when
[40:11] someone does something nice for you.
[40:14] And then there's what they call the
[40:16] intensive reflexive. It's an intense
[40:18] action on yourself like repentance
[40:21] leading to baptism
[40:23] or praising the Lord in the midst of
[40:25] your troubles like Leia.
[40:30] Strongs tells us yadas to use to hold
[40:32] out the hand physically to throw
[40:34] something to revere or worship with
[40:37] extended hands intensively to be moaned
[40:40] by ringing the hands.
[40:43] In Hebrew, Judah's name Yehudah includes
[40:48] the name of God Yahweh as well as the
[40:51] root word of praise.
[40:54] The rabbis tell us that the name Yehudah
[40:57] envelopes God's name in praise.
[41:02] Yehudah is the only one of Jacob's sons
[41:06] whose name includes the name of God.
[41:10] Okay, some of you are either still awake
[41:13] or you've tattooed your eyes so that you
[41:16] look like you're awake, but it's okay.
[41:17] You can wake up now. Now, I want to ask
[41:20] a question.
[41:22] Which of Jacob's sons was the ancestor
[41:26] of David?
[41:29] Was it Reuben,
[41:30] Levi, Dan, Joseph, Benjamin? No, Judah.
[41:37] One more question.
[41:40] To which of Jacob's sons do the
[41:42] genealogies recorded in Matthews and
[41:45] Luke's gospels link Jesus?
[41:49] Judah.
[41:58] Have you ever wondered why the accounts
[42:01] of Matthew and Luke make a point about
[42:04] the ancestry of Joseph?
[42:08] Since Jesus was the only begotten son of
[42:10] God, how could he be of the line of
[42:12] Judah?
[42:14] What's going on?
[42:18] In Matthew 1, we read the book of the
[42:20] generation of Jesus Christ, the son of
[42:24] David, the son of Abraham.
[42:27] We we see that son simply means
[42:29] descendant. And and now we trace a
[42:32] lineage. Abraham begat Isaac. Isaac
[42:35] begat Jacob. Jacob begat Judas. That's
[42:38] translated from the from the Greek
[42:41] Judah. Yehudah and his brethren. And
[42:44] Judah begat Ferz and Zarah of Tamar. We
[42:47] we know the story
[42:50] several verses down many generations.
[42:53] Elude begat Eleazar. Eleazar begat
[42:55] Matan. Matan begat Jacob. Not the Jacob
[42:58] we normally think of. Jacob begat Joseph
[43:01] the husband of Mary. Of whom was born
[43:06] Jesus who was called Christ anointed
[43:08] Messiah.
[43:10] Joseph listed as the husband of Mary,
[43:14] not as the father of her son.
[43:19] Curious what what does Luke have to say
[43:21] about this? Luke chapter 3. Jesus
[43:24] himself began to be about 30 years of
[43:26] age being as was supposed the local
[43:30] rumor mill did not require AI or Tik Tok
[43:33] or social media or news outlets to
[43:36] spread gossip and halftruths.
[43:39] being as was supposed the son of Joseph,
[43:42] again skipping many generations, the son
[43:44] of Phz, which was the son of Judah,
[43:47] Yehuda, the son of Jacob, the son of
[43:49] Isaac, the son of Abraham.
[43:55] Both gospel accounts make it clear that
[43:58] Joseph wasn't Jesus' biological dad.
[44:02] So, what's the big deal?
[44:04] Why? How would this information be here
[44:07] to convince Jewish readers that Jesus
[44:10] was in fact a son of David?
[44:14] Ever wonder how these serve to overcome
[44:17] objections that might be raised about
[44:19] his ancestry?
[44:21] I confess I I wondered about it. In
[44:24] fact, it was just earlier this week
[44:26] preparing for this lesson that I I
[44:29] either I got it or or I think I did.
[44:34] So, if you'll uh if you'll bear with me
[44:37] just a moment.
[44:45] This is a technical thing. It has I
[44:46] think that's an off switch. I think that
[44:49] that means on. Yeah, it lights up. I
[44:52] need to get a couple of people here from
[44:54] the audience.
[44:59] Yeah, I think would it be okay if I uh
[45:03] borrowed Kayla and Hadasa for a moment.
[45:08] Come on, girls. Come on. You can do
[45:10] this. You can do this.
[45:14] Let's
[45:16] come this way.
[45:24] And just just have a seat here. Just
[45:25] make yourself comfortable, as
[45:27] comfortable as you can sitting next to
[45:28] an old guy like me.
[45:31] So, your name is
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Hadassa.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; What's your last name?
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Bagot.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Hada Bagot. Your name is
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Michaela.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Michaela
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Bagot.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Michaela Bagot.
[45:45] Was that always your name?
[45:47] &gt;&gt; No.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Was that always your name?
[45:49] &gt;&gt; No.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; No.
[45:51] How did you get your new name?
[45:56] How did you get your new name? Was it uh
[46:00] perhaps because you were adopted?
[46:04] They're shaking their head. That means
[46:05] yes, the microphone didn't pick it up.
[46:07] If I shook my head, you hear a rattle,
[46:09] but they're they're a little more solid
[46:10] than I am.
[46:12] So So does that make Brother Jeremy and
[46:15] Sister Angela your dad and mom?
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. Your dad and mom.
[46:23] I think I might have a couple of
[46:24] questions for them. Let's let's walk
[46:26] back that way. But but first first I
[46:29] want to thank you for your help.
[46:35] Okay, there's two of you. That's a $2
[46:37] bill. Let's go this way.
[46:40] [Applause]
[46:49] So
[46:51] I I just heard that these are your
[46:53] adopted daughters. Is that true?
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Okay. Um, so in the eyes of
[47:00] the law
[47:04] they're your daughters.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; They've taken your name. They are now
[47:08] part of the tribe of Bagot.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; They are descendants of the tribe of
[47:13] Bagot.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, now if brother Merl's dad had
[47:18] been named Amos Judah,
[47:22] then these kids would be named Judah and
[47:24] they'd be part of the tribe of Judah.
[47:27] Except they're part of the tribe of
[47:28] Bagot. Got it.
[47:31] So that also means they have the full
[47:33] rights including inheritance. Is that
[47:35] right?
[47:36] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; That's correct. Full rights of
[47:38] inheritance. Wow. Wow. Thank you. Thank
[47:42] you.
[47:45] [Applause]
[47:55] Thank you.
[48:02] Does the Bible have something to say
[48:03] about that?
[48:06] In Romans 8, we read, "For as many as
[48:09] are led by the spirit of God, they are
[48:12] the sons of God. And Paul explains with
[48:14] an illustration from the law and culture
[48:16] of his time. For you have not received
[48:18] the spirit of bondage again to fear, but
[48:21] you've received the spirit of adoption,
[48:25] whereby we cry, abba, father,
[48:30] the spirit itself, bearing witness with
[48:32] our spirit that we are the children of
[48:34] God.
[48:36] It's about adoption. We have no record
[48:39] of any sort of formal proceeding, but
[48:41] Joseph clearly filled the role of an
[48:44] adoptive father, Joseph, who very
[48:47] clearly is of the tribe of Judah. Recall
[48:50] in the temple at age 12, Mary telling
[48:53] Jesus, she didn't say, "Joseph and I
[48:55] have been looking for you." She didn't
[48:57] say, "My husband and I." She said, "Your
[49:00] father and I have been looking for you.
[49:08] I spent a bit of our time about Judah,
[49:11] Yehuda, because it was important enough
[49:14] to God that he made sure Jesus was tied
[49:18] to him and helped underscore how
[49:21] important praise is to God.
[49:28] Dr. Gary Chapman, a Baptist minister,
[49:31] wrote a book about loving relationships
[49:33] in 1992. You may be familiar with the
[49:36] five love languages. He identified five
[49:38] primary ways we express love to one
[49:41] another. Although all five are
[49:43] important, people generally have one
[49:46] primary love language or maybe more than
[49:49] one. The five love languages in no
[49:52] particular order of importance that
[49:54] depends on the individual are words of
[49:56] affirmation, acts of service, receiving
[50:00] gifts, quality time, physical touch.
[50:05] Since we are a created species in the
[50:08] image of God, it seems reasonable to me
[50:11] to to think that God also values these
[50:14] and our relationship to him.
[50:18] For example, brother Daniel's series on
[50:20] prayer emphasizes quality time. Isn't
[50:24] that what prayer is partly all about? Is
[50:27] building that relationship with quality
[50:29] time? Our current focus on praise
[50:31] certainly qualifies under the heading of
[50:33] words of affirmation.
[50:36] We know God likes praise. Isaiah 6 tells
[50:38] of a multitude of saraphim flying around
[50:40] the throne crying out, "Holy, holy,
[50:43] holy."
[50:45] As for the other three, Perhaps we'll
[50:48] see them in the future.
[50:51] For now,
[50:53] let's take a look at some examples of
[50:55] praise.
[50:57] In 2 Chronicles 5, we read of the
[51:01] dedication of Solomon's temple. In the
[51:05] first verses, we read of a procession of
[51:08] the sacrifice of a great number of
[51:10] animals. The ark containing only the
[51:13] stone tablets placed by Moses was
[51:15] carried into the Holy of Holies.
[51:20] In verse 11, we read, "It came to pass
[51:23] when the priests were come out of the
[51:25] holy place, the Holy of Holies, where
[51:27] they had just placed the ark." It says,
[51:29] "For all the priests that were present
[51:31] were sanctified and did not then wait by
[51:34] course."
[51:35] By course. You might recall in the
[51:38] gospels in the story of John the Baptist
[51:41] that his dad was a priest and went by
[51:43] course. He he went to Jerusalem from
[51:45] time to time when it was his shift, if
[51:48] you will. He spent his week or month or
[51:50] whatever down there and then went back
[51:51] home until his course came up again.
[51:56] So this verse in 2 Chronicles tells us a
[51:59] book was written many years after the
[52:01] events it describes because it it is
[52:04] careful to point out that they weren't
[52:05] doing it by course. Then in the Hebrew
[52:07] Bible Chronicles is the last book
[52:10] because it was the last book that was
[52:13] written.
[52:14] It came to pass when the priests were
[52:16] come out of the holy place for all the
[52:17] priests that were present were
[52:18] sanctified and did not then wait by
[52:20] course. Also the Levites, which were the
[52:23] singers of them, of Asaf, of Hemmon, and
[52:27] Yedithan, with their sons and their
[52:28] brethren, being arrayed in white linen,
[52:31] having symbols and sulties and harps,
[52:34] stood at the east end of the altar,
[52:36] and with them 120 priests sounding with
[52:40] trumpets.
[52:43] It came to pass.
[52:47] Is that text big enough for you to you
[52:49] can see that? Okay, you can always move
[52:51] up closer.
[52:52] It came to pass as the trumpeters and
[52:55] singers were as one
[52:58] unity
[53:00] to make one sound
[53:03] to be heard doing or saying what in
[53:08] praising and thanking the Lord. And when
[53:13] they lifted up their voice with the
[53:16] trumpets and symbols and instruments of
[53:20] music and praised the Lord, saying, "For
[53:23] he is good. His mercy endures forever."
[53:28] Something happens.
[53:30] when we're in unity, not in discord, but
[53:34] with one voice, praising the Lord, that
[53:38] then and not until then, the house was
[53:42] filled with a cloud, even the house of
[53:45] the Lord, so that the priests could not
[53:47] stand to minister by reason of the
[53:49] cloud. For the glory of the Lord, now
[53:52] we'd say, the presence of the Lord,
[53:56] filled the house of God.
[54:02] Sounds a bit like Acts chapter 2. Now we
[54:08] are the temple. And when we are in unity
[54:13] and praising and worshiping the Lord,
[54:16] then the Holy Spirit can move in our
[54:20] midst just as it did in Solomon's day,
[54:23] just as it did in the upper room.
[54:29] Let's look at another example. This is
[54:31] many years later dur during the reign of
[54:33] Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.
[54:36] What sort of man was this Jehoshaphat?
[54:38] We're going to talk about 2 Chronicles
[54:40] 17 tells us that the Lord was with
[54:43] Jehoshaphat because he walked in the
[54:44] first ways of his father David. He
[54:47] sought not unto Balum but sought the
[54:49] Lord God of his father. He walked in his
[54:52] commandments. His heart was lifted up in
[54:54] the ways of the Lord. It even tells us
[54:56] that in the third year of Jehoshaphat's
[54:59] reign, he sent to his princes to teach
[55:01] in the cities of Judah. And with them he
[55:04] sent Levites and with them priests and
[55:06] they taught in Judah
[55:09] and had the book of the law of the Lord
[55:11] with them and went about throughout all
[55:14] the cities of Judah and taught the
[55:16] people.
[55:17] This is the kind of man that Jehoshaphat
[55:20] was.
[55:22] I want to read now from 2 Chronicles
[55:24] chapter 20. I'll I'll read a good
[55:26] portion of the chapter. It's about
[55:28] praise. That's our topic tonight.
[55:31] Remember that this is about praise.
[55:36] It came to pass after this also that the
[55:40] children of Moab and the children of
[55:42] Amman and with them other besides the
[55:45] Ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to
[55:47] battle.
[55:49] And there came some that told
[55:51] Jehoshaphat, saying, "There cometh a
[55:53] great multitude against thee from beyond
[55:56] the sea in this side of Syria, and
[55:58] behold, they be in Hazantamar, which is
[56:00] in Getty."
[56:03] I'll show you that location in a map in
[56:05] a moment. Yahos feared
[56:08] and called the officers of his
[56:10] considerable army. No, no. Visited the
[56:13] armory to be sure he had arrows and
[56:15] lances and chariots.
[56:18] No, no, no. The king set himself to seek
[56:21] the Lord and proclaimed a fast
[56:25] throughout all Judah. This is a serious
[56:28] time. This is a serious threat. Judah
[56:32] gathered themselves together to ask help
[56:34] of the Lord. Even out of all the cities
[56:37] of Judah, they came to seek the Lord.
[56:41] The Lord wasn't their last resort. He
[56:44] was their first resort. It's a good
[56:47] example.
[56:49] Jehoshaphat
[56:50] stood in the congregation of Judah and
[56:54] Jerusalem in the house of the Lord
[56:56] before the new court and gave a pep
[56:58] talk. Oh no, no, it doesn't say that. He
[57:02] said
[57:04] he's praying before the people.
[57:09] Oh Lord God of our fathers, art not thou
[57:13] God in heaven? rulest not thou over all
[57:16] the kingdoms of the heathen, and in thy
[57:18] hand? Is there not power and might, so
[57:21] that none is able to withstand thee?
[57:25] Art not thou art God, who did drive out
[57:28] the inhabitants of this land before thy
[57:30] people Israel, and gave it to the seed
[57:32] of Abraham thy friend forever?
[57:36] and they dwell therein, and have built
[57:38] thee a sanctuary therein for thy name,
[57:42] saying, If when evil come upon us, as
[57:46] the sword of judgment or pestilence or
[57:48] famine, we stand before this house and
[57:51] in thy presence, for thy name is in this
[57:55] house.
[57:57] Baptism we take on his name. Thy name is
[58:00] in this house and cry unto thee in our
[58:03] affliction. Then wil thou hear and help.
[58:06] And now, Lord, behold, the children of
[58:10] Amman and Moab and Mount Seir, whom thou
[58:14] wouldest not let Israel invade when we
[58:17] were coming through. You told us to
[58:19] leave them alone. When they came out of
[58:21] their land of Egypt, but they turned
[58:22] from them and destroyed them not.
[58:25] Behold, I say, how they reward us to
[58:29] come to cast us out of thy possession
[58:31] which thou hast given to us to inherit.
[58:35] Oh our God, wilt thou not judge them?
[58:38] For we have no might against this great
[58:41] company that comes against us,
[58:44] and we don't know what to do, but our
[58:47] eyes are upon thee.
[58:52] And all Judah, all Yehuda
[58:55] stood before the Lord with their little
[58:58] ones, their wives, their children.
[59:03] Then
[59:05] upon Yahazael,
[59:08] how many have read the prophet Yazael?
[59:11] There was no prophet Yahaziel.
[59:14] Upon Yahaziel, the son of Zachchariah,
[59:17] the son of Banayiah, the son of Yael,
[59:19] the son of Mataniah, a Levite of the
[59:21] sons of Asaf,
[59:24] came the spirit of the Lord in the midst
[59:27] of the congregation. Notice he's he's
[59:29] he's not a prophet, not that we know of.
[59:33] He he's probably a singer being a Levite
[59:35] and descended from Asaf, who wrote many
[59:38] of the psalms.
[59:40] And he said,
[59:43] "Hearken ye, oh Judah, ye inhabitants of
[59:46] Jerusalem, and and thou, King
[59:49] Jehoshaphat." He brings it down from the
[59:52] nation to the city to the king, the
[59:55] leader.
[59:58] That's pretty impent this guy addressing
[1:00:01] the king like this. Thus saith the Lord
[1:00:04] unto you.
[1:00:08] Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of
[1:00:11] this great multitude, for the battle is
[1:00:13] not yours, but God's.
[1:00:16] Tomorrow go ye down against them,
[1:00:20] opposite them. Behold, they come up by
[1:00:23] the cliff of Ziz, and you shall find
[1:00:25] them at the end of the brook before the
[1:00:27] wilderness of Yurel.
[1:00:32] You've got your opera glasses, you can
[1:00:34] you can read that. There's a map showing
[1:00:36] the lay of the land. We have Jerusalem
[1:00:38] up here. Here's Engeti down here. This
[1:00:42] is the Dead Sea. And this is the ascent
[1:00:45] of Ziz. I've covered it up with that red
[1:00:47] mark there, but there's a brook there
[1:00:49] that that goes up. And it goes up, you
[1:00:52] come out of there near Takcoa and then
[1:00:54] go north to Jerusalem. And that's about
[1:00:58] 11 miles or so between Jerusalem and
[1:01:00] Takcoa.
[1:01:03] Got that firmly implanted? You can refer
[1:01:08] to it now as we go on. You shall not
[1:01:11] need to fight in this battle. Set
[1:01:14] yourselves.
[1:01:16] Stand ye still.
[1:01:19] See the salvation of the Lord with you,
[1:01:21] oh Judah and Jerusalem. Fear not, nor be
[1:01:25] dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them,
[1:01:27] for the Lord will be with you.
[1:01:33] And Jehoshaphat,
[1:01:35] look at his humility. Jehoshaphat bowed
[1:01:39] his head with his face to the ground.
[1:01:42] And following Jehoshaphat's example, all
[1:01:44] Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:01:46] fell before the Lord, worshiping the
[1:01:50] Lord.
[1:01:52] And the Levites of the children of the
[1:01:53] Kathites and of the children of the
[1:01:55] Korites stood up to praise the Lord God
[1:01:58] of Israel with a loud voice on high.
[1:02:04] This is before anything's happened.
[1:02:06] There's this guy that's proclaimed this
[1:02:10] and they're rejoicing. They're
[1:02:11] celebrating. They're praising God.
[1:02:16] And they,
[1:02:18] king, priests, army, the inhabitants,
[1:02:22] the people rose early in the morning,
[1:02:26] and went forth into the wilderness of
[1:02:28] Takcoa, again about 11 miles to the
[1:02:30] south. Is that with all the kids and
[1:02:33] stuff? That's maybe a three-hour walk,
[1:02:37] maybe a little longer. And as they went
[1:02:39] forth,
[1:02:40] Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Hear me, O
[1:02:44] Judah, and to the inhabitants of
[1:02:47] Jerusalem, believe in the Lord your God,
[1:02:52] so shall you be established. Believe his
[1:02:54] prophets, so shall ye prosper." This is
[1:02:59] faith before the fact. They're marching
[1:03:02] to see deliverance
[1:03:05] or engage in battle and see destruction.
[1:03:10] Hasn't happened yet. They just got this
[1:03:11] word.
[1:03:13] And when Jehoshaphat had consulted with
[1:03:16] the people,
[1:03:18] it's cooperation,
[1:03:20] agreement,
[1:03:22] unity.
[1:03:24] He appointed singers unto the Lord, and
[1:03:27] that should praise the beauty of
[1:03:29] holiness as they went out before the
[1:03:32] army, and to say, "Praise the Lord, for
[1:03:35] his mercy endureth forever."
[1:03:40] And notice the timing.
[1:03:44] When they began to sing
[1:03:47] and to praise,
[1:03:51] the Lord sent ambushments against the
[1:03:53] children of Amman, Moab, and Mount Seir,
[1:03:57] which were come against Judah, and they
[1:04:00] were smitten.
[1:04:02] For the children, this is how the Lord
[1:04:04] did it, the children of Amman and Moab
[1:04:07] stood up against the inhabitants of
[1:04:09] Mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy
[1:04:12] them.
[1:04:14] These are their allies. These three
[1:04:16] armies are together. And now these two
[1:04:17] are attacking the third. And when they
[1:04:19] had made an end to the inhabitants of
[1:04:21] Seir, Moab and Aman had killed those of
[1:04:24] Mount Seir. And I'm sure they suffered a
[1:04:27] few casualties. Everyone helped to
[1:04:29] destroy another. They couldn't stop
[1:04:31] killing each other.
[1:04:33] And when Judah came toward the
[1:04:35] watchtower in the wilderness there at
[1:04:37] Takcoa,
[1:04:38] they looked unto the multitude, and
[1:04:41] behold,
[1:04:42] they were dead bodies fallen to the
[1:04:45] earth. None escaped.
[1:04:49] We see faith,
[1:04:51] commitment,
[1:04:53] leadership,
[1:04:55] all united as one. We see a people
[1:04:58] turning to the Lord. We see the Lord
[1:05:02] responding, his word being fulfilled
[1:05:04] when the people are focused on him,
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; not on the problem that they're trying
[1:05:09] to solve and praising the Lord. And then
[1:05:15] and not until then, the Lord moves.
[1:05:21] In the case of the temple dedication,
[1:05:24] the presence of the Lord fills the
[1:05:26] place. In the case of the attack of the
[1:05:29] invading army against Judah, the Lord
[1:05:32] spreads the opposite of unity. He uses
[1:05:35] discord to weaken and destroy the
[1:05:40] invaders.
[1:05:42] Proverbs chapter 6 tells us that the
[1:05:44] Lord hates he that sweth discord among
[1:05:48] the brethren.
[1:05:50] Here we see what discord what lack of
[1:05:53] unity does.
[1:05:56] Our worship, our praise of the Lord is
[1:06:00] vital
[1:06:02] along
[1:06:04] with our unity. Remember Jesus prayer?
[1:06:07] Our pastor read that to us recently.
[1:06:10] Father, make them one as we are one.
[1:06:16] The book of Psalms is full of examples
[1:06:19] of praise and worship. The authors,
[1:06:22] there are many. It's not just David. The
[1:06:25] authors consistently
[1:06:27] encourage us to praise the Lord.
[1:06:32] I want to read you just a few examples,
[1:06:34] just a line here and there moving
[1:06:36] through the Psalms.
[1:06:44] Sing praises to the Lord which dwelleth
[1:06:47] in Zion. Declare among the people his
[1:06:50] doings.
[1:06:52] 18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto
[1:06:55] thee, oh Lord, among the heathen, and
[1:06:56] sing praises unto thy name.
[1:07:00] 223
[1:07:02] But thou art holy, oh thou that inhabits
[1:07:07] the praises of Israel.
[1:07:12] 476 Sing praises to God. Sing praises.
[1:07:16] Sing praises to our king. Sing praises.
[1:07:20] The next verse, for God is the king of
[1:07:24] all the earth. Sing ye praises with
[1:07:28] understanding.
[1:07:31] 68:4
[1:07:34] Sing unto the Lord. Sing praises to his
[1:07:37] name. Extol him that writeth upon the
[1:07:40] heavens by his name. Yah, and rejoice
[1:07:43] before him.
[1:07:47] You know, the last psalm in the book of
[1:07:51] Psalms that's attributed to David, not
[1:07:53] necessarily the last one he wrote, but
[1:07:55] in the order of the book, is Psalm 145.
[1:08:00] I I I'd like to read it.
[1:08:03] I'd also like to ask the worship team to
[1:08:05] come at this time. Now, don't get your
[1:08:07] hopes up. I'm not done yet. I want to
[1:08:10] mix things up a little bit this evening.
[1:08:13] Psalm 145 is called David's Psalm of
[1:08:17] praise. Notice the word praise doesn't
[1:08:19] occur in every verse, but every verse is
[1:08:21] praise. I will extol thee, my God, O
[1:08:25] king, and I will bless thy name forever
[1:08:27] and ever. Every day will I bless thee. I
[1:08:30] will praise thy name forever and ever.
[1:08:34] Great is the Lord, greatly to be
[1:08:36] praised, his greatness unsearchable.
[1:08:39] One generation shall praise thy works to
[1:08:42] another shall declare thy mighty acts. I
[1:08:45] will speak of the glorious honor of thy
[1:08:47] majesty, of thy wondrous works. Men
[1:08:51] shall speak of the might of thy terrible
[1:08:53] acts, and I will declare thy greatness.
[1:08:57] They shall abundantly utter the memory
[1:08:59] of thy great goodness, and shall sing of
[1:09:01] thy righteousness.
[1:09:03] The Lord is gracious, full of
[1:09:05] compassion, slow to anger, and of great
[1:09:09] mercy. The Lord is good to all, and his
[1:09:12] tender mercies are over all his works.
[1:09:15] All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord,
[1:09:18] and thy saints shall bless thee. They
[1:09:20] shall speak of thy glory, of the glory
[1:09:24] of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power,
[1:09:28] to make known to the sons of men his
[1:09:30] mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of
[1:09:32] his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an
[1:09:34] everlasting kingdom. Thy dominion
[1:09:37] endureth through all generations. The
[1:09:39] Lord upholdeth all that fall, raisth up
[1:09:42] all those that be bowed down.
[1:09:46] The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou
[1:09:48] givest them their meat in due season.
[1:09:52] Thou openest thine hand, and satisfy the
[1:09:54] desire of every living thing. The Lord
[1:09:58] is righteous in all his ways, holy in
[1:10:02] all his works. The Lord is nigh to them
[1:10:05] that call upon him, to all that call
[1:10:08] upon him in truth.
[1:10:11] He will fulfill the desire of them that
[1:10:14] fear him. He also will hear their cry
[1:10:17] and will save them. The Lord preserveth
[1:10:20] all them that love him, but all the
[1:10:23] wicked will he destroy.
[1:10:25] My mouth shall speak of the praise of
[1:10:27] the Lord, and let all flesh bless his
[1:10:30] holy name forever and ever.
[1:10:35] You know,
[1:10:37] a lot of times what may be spoken up
[1:10:38] here about our lives and conduct can't
[1:10:41] always be immediately applied. You have
[1:10:43] to go outside and and do it right. But
[1:10:46] it's absolutely appropriate to practice
[1:10:48] what we're preaching or teaching or
[1:10:50] sharing this evening right here, right
[1:10:54] now. Verse 21 of David's psalm,
[1:10:59] his psalm of praise is on the screen.
[1:11:02] Let's sing.
[1:11:05] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[1:11:11] forever.
[1:11:13] I will sing.
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:16] I will sing.
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:20] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[1:11:26] forever.
[1:11:27] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
[1:11:35] With my mouth
[1:11:38] will I make known
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:42] thy faithfulness.
[1:11:46] Thy faithfulness
[1:11:49] with my mouth
[1:11:52] will I make known
[1:11:57] thy faithfulness to all generations.
[1:12:04] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[1:12:09] forever.
[1:12:11] I will sing.
[1:12:15] I will sing.
[1:12:17] [Music]
[1:12:18] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[1:12:24] forever.
[1:12:25] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
[1:12:32] With my mouth
[1:12:36] will I make known
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:40] thy faithfulness.
[1:12:43] Thy faithfulness
[1:12:47] with my mouth
[1:12:50] will I make known
[1:12:54] thy faithfulness to all generations.
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:13:01] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[1:13:06] forever.
[1:13:08] I will sing.
[1:13:12] I will sing.
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:15] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[1:13:20] forever.
[1:13:22] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
[1:13:30] We should always be ready to praise the
[1:13:34] Lord.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Let's look at a few more examples as we
[1:13:38] continue through the Psalms.
[1:13:41] Psalm 68:32, sing unto the Lord, ye
[1:13:44] kingdoms of the earth. Sing praises unto
[1:13:46] the Lord. Saha means think about that. I
[1:13:50] will declare forever Psalm 75, I will
[1:13:53] sing praises to the God of Jacob.
[1:13:57] We will not hide them from their
[1:13:59] children, showing generation to come the
[1:14:01] praises of the Lord and his strength and
[1:14:04] his wonderful works that he hath done.
[1:14:08] Psalm 92. It's a good thing to give
[1:14:12] thanks unto the Lord, to sing praises
[1:14:14] unto thy name, oh most high.
[1:14:18] Psalm 108, I will praise thee, oh Lord,
[1:14:20] among the people. I will sing praises
[1:14:23] unto thee among the nations.
[1:14:27] Psalm 135, praise the Lord, for the Lord
[1:14:31] is good. Sing praises unto his name, for
[1:14:35] it is pleasant.
[1:14:37] It's a good thing to give thanks. The
[1:14:40] Lord is good. Right.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. Well, let's sing in praise
[1:14:45] and worship again. This time about the
[1:14:48] goodness of God.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; For your mercy
[1:14:59] fails me.
[1:15:02] All my days
[1:15:04] I've been held in your hands.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; From the moment that I wake up
[1:15:14] till I lay my head, I will sing
[1:15:21] of the goodness
[1:15:23] of God. Is this true for you? All my
[1:15:27] life,
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; all my life you have been faithful.
[1:15:33] [Music]
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; All my life you have been so so good.
[1:15:44] With every breath that I am able,
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:51] I will sing
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; of the goodness
[1:15:55] of God.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; I love your voice.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; You have led me through the fire.
[1:16:08] In darkest nights,
[1:16:11] you are close like no other.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; I've known you as a father.
[1:16:21] I've known you as a friend.
[1:16:25] I have lived in the goodness
[1:16:29] of God.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Worship and praise everyone.
[1:16:35] All my life you have been faithful.
[1:16:41] [Music]
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; All my life you have been so so good.
[1:16:50] With every breath that I am able,
[1:16:56] I will sing
[1:16:59] of the goodness
[1:17:01] of God.
[1:17:05] the goodness of God.
[1:17:08] He's so good to us, undeserving, but we
[1:17:11] are his children.
[1:17:14] He's helping us grow, to mature.
[1:17:18] Can't help but love him.
[1:17:22] A couple more lines from the Psalms.
[1:17:26] 144. I will sing a new song unto thee,
[1:17:29] oh God. Sometimes we like to hear the
[1:17:31] songs we're familiar with.
[1:17:34] I will sing a new song, oh God. Upon a
[1:17:37] sultry and an instrument of 10 strings
[1:17:39] will I sing praises unto thee. God
[1:17:42] continues to inspire. He didn't stop
[1:17:45] inspiring a 100 years ago or 50 years
[1:17:48] ago or 300 years ago. He's still
[1:17:51] inspiring today.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Psalm 146, while I live will I praise
[1:17:58] the Lord. I will sing praises unto my
[1:18:01] God while I have any being.
[1:18:04] 147
[1:18:07] Praise ye the Lord. It is good to sing
[1:18:09] praises unto our God. It is pleasant.
[1:18:13] Praises calmly
[1:18:16] while I live while I praise the Lord.
[1:18:18] You You've all heard my testimony from a
[1:18:21] few years ago when I had the heart
[1:18:22] attack.
[1:18:25] I was sitting over here roughly where
[1:18:29] your wife is sitting
[1:18:31] and we Heather and I would come into
[1:18:34] service and I just didn't have any air.
[1:18:36] this this heart attack happened on
[1:18:38] Thanksgiving and or the day after and
[1:18:42] and so we'd be worshiping and I'd get
[1:18:45] maybe the first few lines out kind of
[1:18:48] singing and then after that
[1:18:52] I was just lip syncing because I had no
[1:18:54] air. I had no breath. One Wednesday
[1:18:57] night
[1:18:59] there was no prayer line. There was no
[1:19:01] particular
[1:19:03] thing going on really. It was just a
[1:19:05] good Wednesday night service.
[1:19:08] And towards the end of the service
[1:19:10] there, we were worshiping and I just
[1:19:11] felt like the Lord was telling me, L,
[1:19:13] just raise your hands and worship me.
[1:19:15] Just praise me. Well, yeah, that's why
[1:19:19] we're here. So, so that's what I did
[1:19:24] that Sunday morning. The people that
[1:19:26] were sitting near where Heather and I
[1:19:29] sat didn't want to sit there anymore
[1:19:31] because I didn't run out of air. I was
[1:19:33] singing the whole entire 25 minutes or
[1:19:36] so that we were singing. While I had
[1:19:38] breath, I was praising the Lord. While I
[1:19:41] had life, I was praising the Lord. I'm
[1:19:43] 75 years old, right? We're told about
[1:19:46] 70. So, I used to say that that I was
[1:19:51] well, I don't know what I used to say
[1:19:52] because I'm old and I forgot, but I'm on
[1:19:54] bonus time. I'm on bonus time. The
[1:19:57] Lord's given me breath. The Lord's given
[1:20:00] me life. So, like the Psalms say, while
[1:20:03] you have breath, while you have life,
[1:20:06] praise the Lord. Like we just sang,
[1:20:12] one last thing.
[1:20:14] We're told that hallelujah is a Hebrew
[1:20:17] word or phrase. It's actually two words
[1:20:19] meaning praise the Lord. Right? You've
[1:20:22] been told that. You've been taught that.
[1:20:25] I don't imagine anybody's here above the
[1:20:28] age of six or seven that's not familiar
[1:20:30] with that. But have you ever done a word
[1:20:31] search of the Old Testament, the Hebrew
[1:20:33] Bible, and found it? Do a word search? I
[1:20:37] did many times. I never found it. What's
[1:20:39] all this about hallelujah?
[1:20:43] Did you know that the final five psalms
[1:20:47] all begin and end with hallelujah?
[1:20:51] The opening words, opening phrases,
[1:20:53] hallelujah. And the last phrase of each
[1:20:55] of those psalms is hallelujah.
[1:20:58] But if you look in your Bible, it
[1:21:00] doesn't say hallelujah
[1:21:03] because the translators translated it.
[1:21:07] Well, a note in the Bible we used for
[1:21:09] morning devotions indicated this. I just
[1:21:11] discovered this yesterday morning. Being
[1:21:13] the trusting soul that I am, I looked it
[1:21:16] up in the Hebrew. Yeah, right. I'm not
[1:21:18] sure who edited this edition. Right.
[1:21:22] Sure enough, those five psalms begin and
[1:21:25] end with hallelujah.
[1:21:28] So, our closing scripture reading for
[1:21:30] this evening will be the last psalm
[1:21:32] number 150. It's said that the last five
[1:21:36] psalms were read during the dedication
[1:21:39] of the second temple and and we're
[1:21:41] coming up to the 60th anniversary
[1:21:43] dedication of of this church. Psalm one,
[1:21:47] the very beginning, the book ending the
[1:21:48] psalm. Psalm 1 begins with blessed is
[1:21:51] the man whose delight is in the law of
[1:21:53] the Lord who meditates in it day and
[1:21:55] night. The opening psalm is one of the
[1:21:57] Lord blessing us.
[1:22:00] Well, let's read this closing psalm.
[1:22:03] You may please join me in reading it.
[1:22:06] I'll put it on the screen. I've taken
[1:22:07] the liberty to substitute the word
[1:22:09] hallelujah where it occurs in the
[1:22:10] original. And it's a call for us to
[1:22:13] bless the Lord, to praise him. Psalms
[1:22:16] begin with the Lord blessing us and his
[1:22:19] very last word is hallelujah. Us
[1:22:22] blessing him.
[1:22:24] Psalm 150.
[1:22:28] And I'll read it, but feel free to make
[1:22:31] your voice heard. Don't lip sync with
[1:22:33] me. Hallelujah.
[1:22:35] Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him
[1:22:39] in the firmament of his power. Praise
[1:22:41] him for his mighty acts. Praise him
[1:22:44] according to his excellent greatness.
[1:22:47] Praise him with the sound of the
[1:22:49] trumpet. Praise him with the sultry and
[1:22:52] harp. Praise him with the timberal and
[1:22:55] dance. Anybody here starting to get
[1:22:57] enough freedom to dance? Praise him with
[1:23:00] stringed instruments and organs. Praise
[1:23:03] him on the loud symbols. Praise him on
[1:23:06] the high sounding symbols. That
[1:23:08] literally means the clanging symbols.
[1:23:10] Let everything that hath breath praise
[1:23:15] the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; That is the closing song.
[1:23:24] That's as long as we have breath, we
[1:23:29] should praise him.
[1:23:31] Remember Leia?
[1:23:33] In her darkest hour of pain and
[1:23:36] rejection,
[1:23:38] she turned to the Lord in praise.
[1:23:42] So much so that Jesus came as the lion
[1:23:46] of the tribe of praise.
[1:23:50] Why are we here this evening? Let's
[1:23:53] close this portion of the service as we
[1:23:55] sing about that very purpose. Here I am
[1:23:58] to worship.
[1:24:03] Light of the world, you step down into
[1:24:09] darkness.

[1:26:24] to see my sin

[1:26:33] know
[1:26:35] how much
[1:26:38] to see my s to see my s
[1:26:43] upon
[1:26:44] I'll never know I'll never
[1:26:49] know

[1:26:56] myself
[1:26:58] upon that cross.
[1:27:02] I'll never know
[1:27:06] how much it cost
[1:27:10] to see my sin

[1:28:39] I'll never
[1:28:41] know
[1:28:43] how much it costs
[1:28:47] to see my sin
[1:28:51] upon that cross.
[1:28:56] Amen.
[1:28:58] you know, of all the things
[1:29:01] that I know of,
[1:29:03] I can come up here
[1:29:06] and I can open this Bible
[1:29:09] and I can read the words in this Bible
[1:29:12] and I can expound on the words,
[1:29:17] but
[1:29:19] it really can't compare to the unity
[1:29:23] that comes when we worship together.
[1:29:26] We may see the scriptures different. We
[1:29:28] may not see the things the same. But
[1:29:31] when we truly worship together, then we
[1:29:35] can unite. Some people like the old
[1:29:38] songs.
[1:29:40] The people that like the new ones sing
[1:29:42] the old ones to the Lord, too. The
[1:29:45] people that like like the the old songs
[1:29:48] and when we sing the new songs, sing the
[1:29:50] new ones to the Lord, too. The Bible
[1:29:53] says, "Whatever you do, do it unto the
[1:29:55] Lord." I tell you, when brother Lia was
[1:29:58] telling that story, I like to I like to
[1:29:59] tell that story about Jehoshaphat
[1:30:02] when he was putting together this army
[1:30:05] to go out and meet the enemy. And it was
[1:30:08] like like if I was Jehoshaphat, it was
[1:30:11] like Christopher, Zeke, and Daniel, and
[1:30:14] Isaac back there. Get these kids up
[1:30:16] there, these these young men up there,
[1:30:19] big, strong, intimidating kids. put them
[1:30:21] out there in the front and say, "Okay,
[1:30:23] give them a sword and and they're there.
[1:30:25] They're battle hardened. They're ready
[1:30:27] to they're ready to fight and these are
[1:30:30] our best warriors and set them out
[1:30:32] there." And then the Lord comes through
[1:30:35] a prophecy and says,
[1:30:38] "Send out Katie first."
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. But but she's she's
[1:30:45] pregnant. Send out hope with her.
[1:30:50] They can't fight, but they can sing
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:30:54] and they can worship. And that's exactly
[1:30:57] what happened in that story in 2
[1:30:59] Chronicles. He had the battle in array
[1:31:04] and the word came to one of these
[1:31:07] worship leaders, a prophecy, and said,
[1:31:09] "Send out the worshippers.
[1:31:12] Send out the singers."
[1:31:16] And they were no match, brother Ly. They
[1:31:19] were no match for that worship. And I
[1:31:22] love the way brother Lyall said and
[1:31:24] everyone was in unity.
[1:31:28] And you watch what happened. They won
[1:31:30] the battle. They didn't what did what
[1:31:32] did he say? That that the battle is the
[1:31:34] Lord's. And it was. Let's all stand.
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:40] Josiah
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; awesome.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; He is. So let's just worship him. He is
[1:31:47] awesome. So now we've heard the word.
[1:31:49] Now let's just worship him.

[1:32:15] heals me when I'm broken.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; I've been
[1:32:24] forever.

[1:32:37] Keep me in the valley.
[1:32:42] Guide me from the rain.

[1:32:50] Heals me when I'm broken.
[1:32:54] And strength where I've been weaken
[1:32:58] forever. He reigns.

[1:33:34] Awome.
[1:33:37] My God is awesome.
[1:33:40] Savior of the whole world, giver of
[1:33:46] salvation.
[1:33:48] By his stripes I heal.
[1:33:53] Oh my God is awesome.
[1:33:57] Today I am forgi.
[1:34:00] His grace is why I'm living.
[1:34:05] Praise his holy name.
[1:34:10] My God is awome.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:15] Awesome.
[1:34:19] Awesome.
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:23] Awesome.
[1:34:26] My God is awesome.
[1:34:31] Awesome.
[1:34:36] Awesome.
[1:34:38] Awesome.
[1:34:41] Sing that again. My God is awome.
[1:34:45] [Music]
[1:34:48] Awome.
[1:34:52] Awesome.
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:56] Awome.
[1:34:58] My God is awome.
[1:35:04] Awome.
[1:35:07] Awome.
[1:35:11] Awome.
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:17] He is awesome.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Isn't he great? Just give the Lord a
[1:35:22] clap offering and tell him you love him.
[1:35:27] [Applause]
[1:35:32] We always think, "I want to go to
[1:35:34] battle. I'm going to draw my sword,
[1:35:36] Satan. I'm going to I'm going to take
[1:35:37] you out. And right here with brother L's
[1:35:40] sermon, it was like, praise him.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Just worship him and then watch the
[1:35:46] demons flee. Why? Watch everything just
[1:35:48] kind of fall away. Well, I have problems
[1:35:51] with this. I have problems with that.
[1:35:52] Don't worry about the problems. Just
[1:35:54] praise him.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Well, but I'm struggling, pastor. I'm
[1:35:58] struggling with this. I know. Just
[1:36:01] praise him.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Just praise him. And you and you watch.
[1:36:05] You just get your mind focused on him,
[1:36:07] your mind praising him. And and then we
[1:36:09] come together, brother Jonathan, and and
[1:36:11] now we have two people praising him. And
[1:36:13] now we have 20 people. Now we have 50
[1:36:14] people praising him all together. And
[1:36:17] then everything just all the bad stuff
[1:36:20] just just goes away. You know, it it's
[1:36:22] it's just away right now. Just keep it
[1:36:25] away, friends, as you go. Brother
[1:36:27] Jeremy, can I pull you away from your
[1:36:30] lineage?
[1:36:32] As brother Lyall said, that was good.
[1:36:34] That was really good. But I really like
[1:36:36] that adoption. That was excellent.
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:45] Made me think. Believe Brother Lyle read
[1:36:48] out of uh Romans chapter 8 that talks
[1:36:52] about You know what? Let me let me just
[1:36:54] as brother Jeremy's coming, let me just
[1:36:56] read it. Maybe get our minds softened
[1:37:00] and and ready for brother Jeremy to
[1:37:02] pray.
[1:37:06] believe it's Romans believe it was
[1:37:08] Romans 8 by the L. I think it was
[1:37:16] almost there.
[1:37:21] [Music]
[1:37:34] Here it is.
[1:37:37] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:37:40] God, they are the sons of God.
[1:37:44] For you have not received the spirit of
[1:37:46] bondage again to fear,
[1:37:50] but you have received the spirit of
[1:37:52] adoption
[1:37:54] whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." Amen.
[1:38:05] Let's bow our hands. Gracious heavenly
[1:38:07] father, we just love you, Lord. We thank
[1:38:10] you, Lord, that we can
[1:38:15] we can look to you,
[1:38:18] the author and finisher of our faith,
[1:38:22] and even seek that city
[1:38:25] that is to come whose author and maker
[1:38:28] is God. We just count it a privilege to
[1:38:32] gather again.
[1:38:34] Bless each one here. Have mercy on us as
[1:38:38] we travel and go our separate ways.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; And let us be your light, Lord, whenever
[1:38:44] you need us.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; In your precious name, Lord Jesus
[1:38:48] Christ. Amen.

[1:42:38] Worship him in your car.
[1:42:41] You know, it doesn't have to be talk
[1:42:43] radio or a country of music. It can be
[1:42:45] worship music.
[1:42:47] You can listen to him. You can praise
[1:42:49] him. Praise him in your car. Praise him
[1:42:52] at home. Praise him in the morning. And
[1:42:54] praise him in the evening.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Praise him all the time. Friends, he is
[1:42:59] worthy. So as you go, friends, don't
[1:43:02] ever don't stop praising him. And if
[1:43:05] things get hard, praise him that much
[1:43:07] more. Just praise him. Praise him for
[1:43:10] the trials because you know he's going
[1:43:12] to come through. Praise him if if you
[1:43:14] get sick. Praise him for your healing
[1:43:16] because you know it's going to come.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brothers and
[1:43:20] sisters. Praise him as you go. You're
[1:43:24] dismissed.
