Praise the Lord. Brother Ed, could you come open in a word of prayer tonight? I didn't get any prayer requests sent to me. Uh, Brother Daniel sent me something he wanted to say. He said, "Please greet the congregation for me. Tell them I love them and I wish I was there in all caps." And he said, "This project going on has been in the work for a couple years now." I know it's pretty stressful and a pretty big deal. I don't know exactly how or why it's a big deal, but I know it's a big deal. Let's pray for him tonight. Brother Ed, [Music] it's good to be in the house of the Lord. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, we're thankful to be here tonight.

Use them for your honor and glory. give him that which he has need of to accomplish his work. Lord, those that aren't able to be with us, we'd ask that you'd be with them also. Those that are streaming, go forth and just bless them, Lord, as we would be blessed tonight. Be in the remainder of the service in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Thank you, brother Ed. Shake someone's hand. Try to shake at least three hands before you sit down. Sister hope, if you want to get ready. You can all have your seats.

And there's not a reason, Lord, why we could not or should not bless you and worship you, Lord. You're our life. You're our strength. You're our everything, Lord. Without you, we are nothing. We just want to say we love you and we appreciate you, Lord. Where would we be without you, Lord? Thank you for for allowing us to be here, Lord. But even more, thank you for you being here with us today, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Thank you. You may be seated. Thank you. Good to be in the house of the Lord today. There are many that would love to have a place to fellowship and they don't. But God's good to us. So, Brother Dan sent me a text earlier today asking if we would be ready and I said yes. I responded, "Hey, are you busy?" And he said, "Very, very busy." back there and also sent a text to brother Jordan knowing that they were back on towards the east coast and checking to see if they had uh the storms had been but they said they had gone to the west side of North Carolina so they were away from the coast and and so just God watches over us. This evening, I just I had had this thought already when brother Dan asked me if I could minister and he asked if we could still stay on on the line of of prayer, of seeking the Lord. And I said, I've already had a thought in mind, and that was the word that came to mind was seek, seeking. And I said, "So, we can tie that in because when we're seeking the Lord and his ways, a lot of that is in prayer. We can read his word. We can we can see what he says." But he wants to talk with us and he wants to to just share himself with us. And you say, "Well, I'm not I'm not worth it. I I'm not worthy of it." You know how much he thought of you? He died for you. So he considered you worthy of of his fellowship, worthy of his time. It reminded me as I was thinking about this when brother Brandham was up on the mountains and the storm came over and brother Brandham turned to go back to get away from the storm and the and the Lord said, "I'm enjoying my fellowship with you. Why don't you just speak that storm away?" And you know, it's sometimes we we we feel that Lord, why would you want to talk to me? Why would you want to be around me? Look at look at how I am. Look at who I am. And he says, "Because I care for you. I love you. You're part of me." He said, "I cared for you so much that I knew that I would have to give my life for you." And I said, "I'll do it." So it's, you know, so it shows that his desire for you is great that he would give his life. show. Hebrews 11:6 and I don't know if I gave you this the scripture or not because I just added it on it. It's but without faith it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. So sometimes maybe my thought of the word diligence to do my do diligence or some may be a little different than somebody. So I I just pulled up a defi definitions diligently diligence having or showing care and consciousness in one's work or duty. performing task with thoroughess and an effort from start to finish where one can be counted on to follow through on the commitment and the responsibilities. Now God did that already. You know he was there on the cross and he or he was coming to the cross and he asked father or was on the cross is there another way we could do this than what I'm having to go through right now but he said not my will but thy will be done. And as diligent is to be active, persistent and there's attentiveness, paying attention to it, you know, uh careful and persevering in carrying out tasks or duties. Today I I uh we were been working in the car and I I took it by the shop there where Eleaser and JJ have and we were talking about maintenance, taking care of something before it becomes a problem. And you know, a lot of times we take the car into the shop when it's a problem and you there your newer cars, they have all kinds of the lights that go on and tell you there is something going on, you know, but there's maintenance, there's oil changes, there's checking the pressure on the tire, there's certain things that you can do daily that will keep the car running better, you know, and and things like that. But it's usually when there's a problem that we go to the mechanic or we do it ourselves. And sometimes it's with God the same way. We begin to seek God when we got a problem. &gt;&gt; When everything's smooth, everything seems going good. Hey, thank you, Lord. And then we get on our way and we get going. But you know, he wants that fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; He wants to talk with you. He wants to share with you and and it's not he's eternal. You can't you can't come to the end of the book. There is no end of the book. It's eternal. &gt;&gt; It's daily. So So again, he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. So you give time, you give effort. And I know sometimes at the end of the day, you're tired. It's been a long day. It's been frustrating. But five minutes in his presence can undo everything that went wrong on the day. &gt;&gt; Uh he'll come and meet with you. And it's just something we do. So as I got these thoughts and I began to think about it and brother Daniel asked me if I would could minister and I said okay. And he said can you keep kind of on the same subject with especially with prayer and I said yeah I'm already on that line there. And as I just began to think about this and and it's making an effort to seek the kingdom of God. We make an effort for a lot of things. Um you know to prepare ourselves for this to go over there to you know whatever it is. We they there there was a a memorial service this this past Saturday here at the church and came in and got here early and got the sound system ready. help them get set up and do because there was we were making preparations for it to go as as as well as it could, you know, and then of course after it's all done then there's cleanup which is still part of what you're doing. It doesn't stop just because everybody left there there's there's a continual thing going on. And and it started with this when I was thinking I said, you know, I looked up the word seek in the Bible and there was quite a few times the word seek is used. And I was looking specifically where God is asking or saying something long, seek me, look for me, call upon my name. Not go seek like David said, go seek if so and so was here. That's not we're talking about let's let's let's seek God. But it brought me to this Genesis 3 8 and9 because the first one that came seeking was God came seeking Adam and Eve there that day. So Genesis 3:8-9 and they heard the voice of the Lord God walk God walking the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, "Where art thou?" God knew what had happened. There was no surprise. There was like a, "Hey, hey, I I'm going to have to go find out what we're going to do about this." He knew exactly what had happened. Yet, he came down to talk with him &gt;&gt; to knowing what's going and he said he came down and and he said, "Where art thou?" knowing where he was, Adam had to respond. And sometimes God will get you in a situation and he'll ask you, "Why are you here? What got you here? &gt;&gt; What was the cause?" Why? Because we want to. He wants to work on that. Wants to begin to Okay. A good teacher, a good school teacher didn't fill out the answers for you. They gave you the test. They gave you the lessons. and they helped you learn. And that's how God works. And we're going to go through this together. 1 Chronicles 28:9. And it's, "And thou, Solomon, my son, know that one's kind of cut off there. Let me read it here. And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind. For the Lord searches all hearts, and understand all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee. But if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off forever. It says, "If you'll look for him, he will be found of thee." And sometimes in our seeking and and our looking and our our wanting, we may go a certain direction, a certain way. We think this would be the best way. Um and and but God knows the way to get your attention and draw you. We know that Moses had had left Egypt. He had fle flown out back and he's on the back side of the desert and he's walking taking care of the sheep. God knew where Moses was going to come through and he met him in that burning bush of fire. God was there already because knowing that there was going to be a meeting place there. Sometimes you get in a situation you wonder how did I get here? God says because you're going we're going to meet here and we're going to have some fellowship. It it reminds me of the time and I I said, "Well, brother Brandon was was up there on that mountain and he turns to go from the storm and God says, "Speak to it because we're having fellowship. I'm I'm enjoying my time with you." And then on in 2 Chronicles 15:15 and it says, "And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire, and he was found of them, and the Lord gave them rest roundout." They sought him. They looked at him. They said, "Lord, we wanted we want to be where you are. We want you to be where we are. &gt;&gt; You know what Moses said? He says, "If you don't go with us," when he's telling the Lord, if you're not going to go with us and if you're going to destroy the people, you're going to have to come through me because a desire of of him knowing God and the fellowship goes and him wanting Israel to have that same thing. It's the spirit of Christ in you actually seeking God. And that's that's a promise that he gives us. 2 Chronicles 15:15. And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with their heart and sought him with their whole desire, and he was found of them, and the Lord gave them rest roundout. When you seek the Lord and you find God and you fellowship, the blessings that come with it, the fellowship, the peace, the rest, even if if if everything around you seems to be going upside down and backwards, knowing that God is there with you, there's a peace and a rest. He's never failed, and he's not going to start fighting failing today. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. 1 Chronicles 16:10 and 11. Glory ye in his holy name. Let the heart of their of them rejoice that seek the Lord. Seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his face continually. Now, it's easy to to prepare for a Wednesday night service, Sunday morning service, Sunday evening service, but God likes a Monday service, a Tuesday service, a Wednesday service, a Thursday service, a Friday service. You know, I um I got a text from Stephen, my son-in-law, letting me know that our supervisor that I had worked under quite some time for quite a few years. We went back from probably the mid 90s back, I guess, that he would be retiring next month. So, I sent him a text. I said, "I hear hear you're retiring." We got to talking a little bit. So, he asked me, we're kind of texting. He said, "What's it like?" I said, "Well, the hardest time thing for me right now is figuring out what day it is. First day of the week is Saturday. The second day of the week is Saturday. The third day of the week is Wednesday. And then it's Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, and Sunday." He goes, "What do you mean?" I said, "Well, I go to church on Wednesdays and Sundays. Those two days I know where they are. The other days I have to look at the calendar because it's You understand what I'm saying? It it it's not it's not a Wednesday Sunday with God. It's every day. &gt;&gt; He'll meet with us here, &gt;&gt; but he loves to have fellowship every day. In the morning when I rise, during the day, in the cool of the evening, and at night before I go to bed, I fellowship with him. Psalms 9:10. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee. For thou, oh Lord, has not forsaken them that seek thee, he'll never turn his back on you. Even when things, let me just put it, even when you do didn't do it right, even when you failed, even when you made a mistake, even when you threw your hands up and said, "I quit." He'll never forsake you. There are many times we get to that point where we just feel like throwing our hands up in the air and say, "I don't want to do this anymore." Psalms 27:4 and 7 and 8. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. He says, "All the days of my life, not just in the morning a little bit, not all the time seeking the Lord. Can you do work and seek the Lord?" Yes, you can. Can you drive down the road on your car and seek the Lord? Yes, you can. God is not limited to a specific spot or a specific place. I I I remember that the last part of of work for me was a lot of driving time, crisscrossing town, doing things. And sometimes it was a 45 minute, let's say if I was going from my house to Benson, it was a little over an hour's drive. There was a good hour to talk to the Lord, with my eyes open. I promise. And I never did drive down the road praying with my eyes closed. But God answered. God spoke back. It was fellowship. No, you know, so he says, "One thing have I desired, and that will I seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice, have mercy also upon me, and answer me." And when thou saidest, seek ye my face, my heart said unto thee, thy face, Lord, will I seek. And it's it's not um God doesn't ask a a certain set of rules to approach him. You got to meet this, got to meet this, you got to go that, you got to do this, you got to wash. He did the priest. He had to wash their hands. He had there was so many rituals that they went through to get to that point. But God says just turn your heart back towards me &gt;&gt; and I will be there with you. And then Isaiah 55 6-9. Seek ye the Lord while he may be found. Call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way and the righteous unrighteous man his thoughts. and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, who will abundantly pardon, who will abundantly pardon. And he says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts." And I appreciate that, that his thoughts are pure and true, and he keeps his word. Neither are your ways my ways, sayaeth the Lord. But he can be touched by the filling of our infirmities. I've been there. I've been attacked that way. I was tempted that way. But I overcame and you can overcome. He says, "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." And I'm glad because if he thought sometimes the way I think, I'd be very disappointed in him because I sure get disappointed in myself sometimes. But he has it all under his control. He's not He's not pushed and pulled this way. How do I do now? What I do? He's It's already taken care of. &gt;&gt; David cries out, "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil." &gt;&gt; How do you get to a place like that? when you've walked through that valley and you've overcome. When you've gone through that hard time and you've overcome or when you hear the testimony of someone sharing and you see the joy in their life, the blessing of it, it encourages you. You know, somebody gives their testimony of the goodness of God. It's a blessing every time. You know, and maybe we do get a little bit of jealous. Lord, I'd like that blessing, too. And then says, okay, I'm going to put you through that. And say, well, I don't know, Lord. Can I do that? Well, you ask for that blessing. You get that blessing by going through that trial. Wow. &gt;&gt; Okay. He know he knows how to bring his children up. You know, raising six daughters. And I see Abby there and looks like Dena and Sarah. And they're all six daughters, but each one had a little different nature about them, a little different way about them. Some things was in general, but some things were individual. you know how and that's the way the Lord is. He might deal with brother Jonathan a certain way and sister Lily a certain way, but then there are some things that we all hear, but God knows how to deal with you, how to talk to you, you know. So, I like this Jeremiah 29 uh there 29 11 through13. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord. Oh, you know the thoughts that you think towards me. You also know the thoughts that I think towards you. And sometimes that's a little scary. Say, Lord, help me. But watch what he says. Thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end. That which I have purposed is what's going to happen. Not let's but to just just think that I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayeth the Lord not of evil but of good. Then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken. I will listen. I will pay attention to you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart. And searching for God with all your heart requires an effort because we get pulled in a lot of different directions, a lot of different things. But giving your all your heart when when you're talking to him and setting everything else aside and be willing to say, "Lord, whatever it takes, deal with me. If it's there something wrong, show it to me. Help me. Show me to make it how to make it right. Show me how to fix that. And then Lord, you're going to have to show me again because I didn't learn my lesson the first time. Help me the second time. And to God, when he's forgiven it and cleaned it, it's the first time again. That's hard to understand sometimes. But you get before him the father, I I made a mistake again. And he looks and shows you his book and he says, there's nothing there. It's already been cleaned. It's us that struggle with that part. Now in the in in in in the New Testament when Jesus was here on earth and and he walked with his disciples and and we are fortunate to have everything that has been recorded in the scriptures and in today with everything they have found there's so many things that they have found and discovered that back that that that show those things really did happen. it was not somebody's imagination. But even more than that is when you have those same experiences that they had in here, then it really becomes real to you. God cares for me. God knows what I'm doing, where why I'm here, and what he's doing about it. Matthew 6:33, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and then all these things will be added unto you, seeking him first." Um, a lot of times and and we've all done it, you know, as as the the girls were growing up and and as my grandchildren are here as they're growing up, I've watched them try to do it themselves and they want to, you know, and mama can tell you more about that. And then they finally have to come in and said, "Can you help me?" And sometimes we're trying to do it ourselves. &gt;&gt; She doesn't ask you if you can help her. I saw sister Angela and her kind of laughing. But you know, there comes a time that we have to say, "Help, I surrender. I need help, you know, and it said, but he says, seek ye first the kingdom of God." And he repeats this in the in the gospels and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. And then in Luke 12:31-32, he says, "But rather seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you. Fear not, little flock, for it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. &gt;&gt; The joy that we you have as as a father, as a parent, or maybe even an older brother to a younger brother or to a good friend of being able to give something and help with them, you know, just to see them, you know, and and then also the joy, especially now with the with Khloe and Ashers. Thank you, Papa, you know, it just means something to you. And when he has done for you and you realize what he's done for you, you run and say, "Lord, I just appreciate your goodness, even though I've walked through the valley of shadow of death, I will fear no evil," David said, because thou art with me, and I don't have to. I may fall, I may trip, I may make a mistake, but you said you'd watch over me. Fear not, little flock, for it's for it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Matthew chapter 7 verses 7 and 8. Ask and it shall be given you. Ask Lord. You're you're you're such a great God. You're you're you're so powerful. You're so righteous. You're so holy. You're so And you describe who he is. And I'm nothing. But I haven't found anywhere that the scripture says that the only way I can talk to him is when I match him. I never could talk to him then. But he says, "Ask and it shall be be given you. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be open unto you." You know, he said, "That's enough to get my attention. How do you not? Get on your knees. Said, 'Lord, I want to talk with you. Lord, I want to have some fellowship with you. Maybe when you're driving down the road, Lord, while I'm driving down the road, I want to hear from you. It doesn't have to be and and I know we all set a a place aside sometimes and and I know some places that I go to pray when I set my my time aside, it's specifically right there that I am going to seek the Lord. I set that aside, that time or that place. But if I'm driving down the highway, I could still talk to him. If I'm up in the mountains, I can still talk to him. If I was in prison, I could still talk to him. He'll watch over you. So again, in Matthew, ask and it shall be given you. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be open. Then he answers it. For everyone that seeketh or askketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knockketh it shall be opened. So just say, "Brother Josiah came to my house to visit me or looking for me," which he hasn't yet, but maybe one of these days he will. And he stands, but he didn't tell me he was coming. and he stands outside of my front door and he just stands there, but I don't know he's coming. I'm not expecting him. And he doesn't knock and he doesn't ring the bell and he doesn't call me on the phone. I don't know that brother Josiah's out there unless I happen to look out. And then I'll ask him, "Why didn't you knock? Why didn't you call? Why didn't you ring the the doorbell?" Well, I'm afraid I was going to disturb you. Well, then why did you come? Sometimes we do that with the Lord. We're just on our knees, but we're not even asking or talking to him. Just on our knees. But he says, "Ring the doorbell. Call. I'm here for you." Says, "He that knockketh, it shall be open." And so, Brother Josiah, I'll expect a knock or a doorbell or a call ahead. Okay, we know that just you'll remember something like that. It's that simple. I've got to pray for 10 hours. I've got to read my Bible. I got to hear five messages. I got to listen to this preacher before I can get to God. No, you can get on your knees and talk to him. &gt;&gt; Wherever you at, wherever you find yourself, you can talk to him. Matthew 6:19-21. Lay not up for yourself treasures upon the earth. Where moth and dust rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal. And if you watch anything in the news, it's just rampant today. Breaking in here, stealing, that making all the young guys running in and just breaking into a store and stealing stuff. just wide open today. And he says, "That's not where your treasure should be at. That's not where your heart should be at." He says, "But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal." Now, does that mean a physical place in in heaven? No. That's between you and God. There will come a time where we will be on that side, but right now, I'm not there. But there's a place that I can get to where it's just me and him. And he says, "That's where you should lay that. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." I remember my dad. Um many years ago, he had bought a brand new truck in 1964, a Chevy pickup, and it was a Cardinal red. And he would say, "We're going to the park." And there he would drive us to the park and he would take a a bucket of water and he would wash the truck and shine the truck, clean it all up and keep it nice, everything. He treasured that truck. I mean, it it was always clean. It was always nice. And he let us get in it and go with him, which was a good thing, too. Sometimes people clean it up and don't let nobody touch it. But he, you know, and you know, God will clean you up and and wash you up because he wants to abide with you. He wants to be with you. He wants to go. He wants to fellowship with you. And I I still remember that. Now before we moved to to um Tucson in in 76 um 75 actually dad had promised to sell the truck to a friend of his and he did the man bought it. It was not no longer not my dad's truck. But I remember my dad would get so aggravated when he would see his friend driving down the road and the truck wasn't clean and he was racing it up and down the road and it would make my dad so mad. But it was no longer my dad's truck. Satan will get angry at you and frustrated with you and wants to make a mess out of you, but you're not his anymore. You belong to God. He lost to one who has given his heart. He wants to make a mess out of you. But God says, "No, he's mine. I'll clean him up. I'll change your life. I'll do this work on him." He says, "Because where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. And when you're God's treasure, his heart was for you. And he gave his life for you." He said, "They can't do it on their own. I'm going to be there with them." Matthew 6:25-32 I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat and the body than reignment? Jesus is saying okay you have to these are things that we have to do to to you know to be on this earth and all but when that becomes our priority he said there's a greater priority than that there's something there he says behold the fowls of the air they don't sow they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedth them are ye not much better than they I looked at that and it just in reading that we have u in the backyard we got two uh uh goodsized trees out there and we have all the birds out there and the bird take person takes care of the birds out there. My wife is constantly putting food out there for them, making sure the water's full. And now the rabbits have found out that she puts the some of the vegetables that are getting old, they get up and put out there. And and she just enjoys watching them do it. Now, it's for them. And some of those rabbits think it's just for them. They fight each other for what's there even though there's 10 pieces there, you know, just watching in the nature. We get we get out and watch them. And now there's two hawks that decided that that's a good place to hang around now because there's plenty of food out there. And uh she doesn't like it at all. My wife, go away, hawks. Those are my rabbits. Those are my birds. Those are my squirrel. We're getting a whole extra of us, you know. But you know, when when God takes care of them, how much more do you mean to him? And when Satan comes around and begins to argue and fight for you, God said, "No, those aren't mine. I died for them. I gave my life for them." Yeah, but look at this one, what he did. Look at this one what she did. Look what he says, I know, and that's why I died for him and shed my blood. &gt;&gt; He says, and he tells him, are ye not much better than they? Then he says, which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? In other words, how can you uh get all caught up in your mind, get all frustrated with us, doing all this, and increase yourself? You can't. You need to learn to rest and and let him do the work. It's it's one of those things that if um I'll just you sister Lily Sister Katie on the piano, they make it look so easy. I've tried it. It never sounds anything like that. I can do one finger. If I try two, they get lost. Now, I don't know if Sister Katie or it could play the saxophone. I can play the saxophone. I have my part. She has her place. But God will fit you where you're needed to be. What you need to do, the part of the body you're part of. He says, "Take no thought, but which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto your stature? And why take ye thought for reignment? Consider the liies of the field not how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin. There's no that little flower doesn't come out, dig the ground around, go grab the hose and water itself. No, the seed is there and my wife goes out there and gets a hose and puts the water down or God sends the rain along and they grow. And then he says, "And yet I say unto you," this is Jesus speaking, "that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these." sometimes going down I know when we were up in Idaho and and those places just to see the fields covered in grain and in in wheat or whatever they were growing and other places and just when we went back to the Midwest to see the corn that was about 10 ft high I'd never seen didn't realize corn could get up that high but just to see those things God takes care of all of that he's made a way and he'll take care of you if you'll let him do it. And he says, "Where wherefore if God clothe the grass clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast in the oven, shall he not much more clothe ye? Oh ye of little faith, I I looked at that. Oh, ye of little faith. Lord, yesterday it was you did such a wonderful thing for me, but Lord, where are you today? 15 minutes ago I was praising the Lord. And 15 minutes later, I say, "Where are you? Where did you go?" He's never left you. But he likes to test you. He wants you to also understand that there's a growth possibility, that there's a way to grow up some more in the Lord. And then he says, "Therefore, take no thought, saying, what shall we eat? What shall we drink? Or wherewith all shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all these things." He knows he's already made provision in the natural and in the spiritual. You know, it's it's sometimes we get a little bit frustrated because we want things to happen quicker and faster. Um it's a little different here in uh in the summer because boy, you really have to water everything that's planted outside. You really got to watch the shade in the water because it'll get eaten up in no time. you know, and and there's other places in this country that it just seems like they all that stuff just grows up without without any help. It seems I've talked to enough folks that they say, "I love Arizona from about late October till about March or April, but I do not want to be here in the summer." Well, sometimes I feel the same way, too. But God has his reasons and his wise, you know, but God has made a provision. God has made a way. Okay? He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you." But he didn't say you wouldn't go through any problems. He never said that you wouldn't have some downtimes. He just said, "I'll be with you and I'll never leave you." Our lessons learned are what we go through, what we learn from. Eventually, you learn hopefully not to touch touch a hot pan. Hopefully, it doesn't take 15 or 20 times to learn something like that because it hurts. Some lessons need to be learned quickly so you don't injure yourself. Some lessons take time. There's uh brother Sean here who who's a pilot on a what 767 I believe he said. you know, um, they just called you up one day while you were at home and asked you if you wanted to fly an airplane, right? Okay. Well, don't ever go on that airplane then with him. No, there was lessons. There was learning. He was uh in the National Guard, learned to fly. It took time, but today he gets on a plane. I hope he gets on the plane anyways. He's supposed to be flying it. But no, there is lessons learned. You can, you know, I don't I I don't know. It's just a freight, right? you guys just haul freight. So, not too worried too much about it. They don't doesn't freight doesn't complain too much. But, you know, but it's a lesson learned. And I and I've shared this. Just because you've been around something all day long or all your life doesn't mean you know how to operate it. I there was a young man that we hired and they asked me to teach him in the laminate shop working with laminate and solid surfaces and stuff. And my question was to him is uh what have you done with this in in this you know any of this type of work and he just shared with me how his grandpa had a shop and how his dad worked in it and we went around for 5 to 10 minutes and I said he doesn't get it. I want to know what do you know? I'm not hiring your dad and I'm not hiring your grandpa. I'm hiring you. And then I remembered and the musicians can can make their way up now. And I I remember just thinking about this and I said, you know, my dad used to take us over to the airport there in Ontario and buy us an ice cream and my younger brother and we would watch airplanes land and take off and we had a great time doing that, especially with the ice cream, too. you know, we were just kids, watch them take off. And then we moved to Tucson and I had bought a camera and I used to go take pictures. I love to be I loved airplanes, just never never had one, never flew one myself, but I used to like to be around them. And then a company that I worked for, uh, the photographer and, um, from the company I was learning to take picture stuff. So he used me as the model of the as a person that was standing there that you can operate this machinery if you go through our system. And one was sitting in a LAR jet. Another one was up on a giant lithography machine. Um there was three or four things that I had no clue how to use, but they just wanted to show somebody. So, I told this young man, I just said, "You know, I've loved airplanes all my life. I've been around them. I worked for one company and I used to clean the owner's lit. I even cleaned the inside. I got to sit inside it." And I went, I've always watched him. I said, "You know, I think I could fly one. You want to go flying with me today?" And he goes, "No." Why not? probably valued his life, but I he goes, "I've never done this before." I said, "Thank you. Now I know where to start you." If we're honest before the Lord, Lord, I'm struggling with this. I'm having a hard time with this. Brother Brandham says in and this my Christian friends and sinner friends, whatever you do, if you believe me to be sent from God, you seek the kingdom of God just as quick as you can and get into it. Not be around it all day, not admire those who are in the kingdom, but you get into the kingdom of God. He says, for that's the only safety we have today. The world's at the end of the age. Only in Christ are you saved. He says, "Now all things ought to be considered prayerally. Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added." I am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul, their thinking, their attitude will be perfect in the sight of God, that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed. [Music] You know what it just it's me and you. He's saying you and I get into that place. Uh yeah, but I fail. Yes, we know we fail, but God is merciful. and he said, "Come back in. Come up. Spend some more time with me. Learn the lesson again. Get get uh stronger in it. Um you're past the first chapter. Let's get into the second chapter now. Let's get to the end of the book. Let's learn from it." So if God said so, God keeps his word. He has never failed. And I would say, Lord, let that be my heart's desire. I want to I want to come to that place where I would hear the same voice. Speak to that storm. I'm having fellowship with you. Come on, stay here. He goes, cuz I want to talk with you. Shut him with God in a secret place. There in the spirit beholding his face. Gaining new power to run in the race. Oh, I long to be shut with God. Just one more time. shut in with God in a secret way. There in the spirit beholding his face gain a new power to run in the race. Oh, I long to be shine with God. [Music] How do we get shut in with you, Lord? How do we get to that place where we're not afraid to enter that with you? When there's such a fellowship, when there's such a that character, that nature becomes to the same and it's your desire to to to be with us as we desire to be with you, Lord. And it becomes evident in in in what we're doing and how we're acting and what we're saying, Lord. It is it pleases you, Lord. Not anything we could do of ourselves, Lord. Not any way we could save ourselves, Lord, but just to draw close to you, Lord. And you would say, just speak that storm away. We're having fellowship now. That trouble that came your way, just speak to it and say, I'm having fellowship with my savior. You go away, Lord. We It's sometimes we make it too difficult. Sometimes we make the only way God will listen to me is if I prayed for 24 hours straight, but if we'll just call on you, Lord, you will answer and you'll draw nigh to us, Lord. Lord, let us take take it full advantage of that, Lord. And when someone would see, they would see Christ in us and then they would ask, "How can I have that same Christ that's in you?" And then we could share our experience with them. and be just like Peter said, "Such as I have, I give unto you." In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, rise up and walk, Lord. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [Music] Could you all stand? Brother Aaron asked that we'd sing Psalms 34. Before we leave, it's not cliche, but let's just not let this be a song right now. We all want the presence of the Lord here, don't we? We all want to feel his glory. Make him feel welcome here just before we go. Can we sing this song? The heart of worship tonight. I sought the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from every fear. [Music] Those who look on him, it's a promise, are radian. They'll never be ashamed. They'll never be ashamed. This poor man. This poor man cried. And the Lord heard me and saved me from my eneies. The son of God surrounds his saints. Do you really believe that he will deliver them? He will deliver them. Magnify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name together. Glorify the Lord with me. Come exalt his name forever. Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. Oh, blessed is he who hides in him. [Music] Oh, fear the Lord, oh you saints. He'll give you everything. He'll give you everything. Sing it. Magnify. Magnify the Lord with me. Oh, come exalt his name. together.

[Music] Come exalt his name forever. Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. He'll give you everything. He'll give you everything. He'll give you everything. Almighty God, prince of peace, everlasting father is willing to come down and talk with you, walk with you, share a meal with you, just sit down by the river and just have fellowship with you. He is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. yet he'll humble himself to fellowship with you. He desires it. So give him that opportunity. So we'll gather again Sunday morning. Brother Daniel, you should be back here. Bring your liquifier and expect God to deal with you. So God bless you. Go ahead. One more song. I bless your name. [Music] I bless your name.
