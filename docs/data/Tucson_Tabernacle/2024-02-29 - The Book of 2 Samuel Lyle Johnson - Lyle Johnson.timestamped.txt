[25:35] Thursday yeah Thursday we were out front
[25:38] here and uh I was just walking the dog
[25:41] and just standing in front of the church
[25:43] and and uh this man walked towards me
[25:46] and uh he said do you go to church here
[25:47] and I said yeah I go to church here and
[25:50] he says uh do you have Spanish do you

[26:00] a I'm a minister I'm a Baptist
[26:03] Minister and so he said uh I was here
[26:06] before there was a man called David some
[26:09] David that uh invited him and uh this
[26:12] David went to Europe or something moved
[26:14] away but gave him some books and tapes
[26:17] and he said I I've read them and he said
[26:19] I'd like to come back this is many years
[26:22] ago so uh I said that's wonderful he
[26:25] said Do you believe it's the end time
[26:26] and I said oh absolutely I said we
[26:29] believe it's the end time and he said
[26:31] yeah that's what those books were
[26:32] talking about and uh so he said uh you
[26:36] believe it's the end time I said well
[26:38] just like the scripture said uh in the
[26:41] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[26:44] it be in the coming of the son of man so
[26:46] we we traded some scripture and he just
[26:50] it was just uh a drawing I had his name
[26:53] is George pray for him he will drop in
[26:56] I'm sure he'll drop in he won't make
[26:57] make a it known but he'll drop in and so
[27:00] we were talking and uh he said by the
[27:02] way he said your church is growing he
[27:04] said what how do you how do you grow
[27:07] your church because since Co he said our
[27:10] church we don't have attendance anymore
[27:13] and and you can't get people to come out
[27:15] to church he said they'll stream but
[27:18] then you know you won't see them for two
[27:20] or three weeks and then just if it's
[27:22] convenient they'll show up so I said
[27:25] well that's that's around the world
[27:27] that's that's what Co has done that's
[27:29] that's what the enemy has tried to do
[27:31] right amen that's true brother true it's
[27:34] true it's it's it affects all of us and
[27:37] so uh I said but he said well how do you

[27:42] lost and I said you know I said you just
[27:45] get the people on fire amen you just
[27:49] keep get the people on fire and then
[27:51] they'll tell someone else and that fire
[27:54] will go from one to another to a
[27:56] coworker to a neighbor to someone sick
[27:59] in the hospital someone gets healed amen
[28:02] I said you just do that and I said you
[28:04] get on fire for God and the people will
[28:06] see it in you and you and they'll start
[28:08] to to pick that up you see what we the
[28:11] way we preach if we're preaching under
[28:13] that anointing that that's what you feel
[28:16] you preach that fire into the people you

[28:44] free to come anytime you want so as we
[28:46] were talking like that he he when he was
[28:49] asking me how do you grow your church I
[28:51] said well you know because we're living
[28:53] in the end time God's going to draw all
[28:57] all men unto himself if we lift up Jesus
[29:00] am he'll draw all men Amen to himself if
[29:03] we lift up Jesus if we if we reflect
[29:07] Jesus and uh I said who who was it in
[29:10] the days of Noah that told the animals
[29:13] to come into the
[29:14] ark and he said well it was God I said
[29:18] yes I said God did it because it was
[29:21] that time and I said as it was in the
[29:23] days of Noah so shall it be God is going

[33:52] people leaving his church it is the most
[33:56] important thing that we can do on Earth
[34:00] is to lead somebody to a living Jesus
[34:04] Christ amen
[34:07] amen I have to give a testimony about
[34:09] the
[34:11] speaker um sorry brother Lyle but it's h

[34:27] man preach that absolutely changed his
[34:31] life so he started ordering his tapes he
[34:34] started following him around the

[34:38] this man's
[34:40] Ministry so he would get his
[34:44] tapes Brother Martin and uh he bought
[34:46] him a big speaker like the one that

[37:41] David this is we heard how David grew up
[37:46] and he was anointed as a very young man
[37:48] to be king and he lived through this
[37:51] ministry of King Saul I believe Saul's
[37:54] Ministry was 40 years
[37:57] and it wasn't but about a year and a
[37:59] half two years into Saul's Ministry that
[38:02] he stopped serving the
[38:04] lord and then
[38:06] that anointing that that kingship went
[38:12] to this young man David and he waited
[38:14] for I don't know 20 or 30 years
[38:18] patiently as the Lord built the
[38:21] character in him and then brought him to
[38:26] the place
[38:27] that we are going to now learn from our
[38:30] brother ly in this book of 2 Samuel

[41:23] evening Welcome to our ongoing w
[41:26] Wednesday evening Bible study not in
[41:28] depth th sections of scripture to derive
[41:31] Doctrine or practice but an overview to
[41:35] provide familiarity with the concepts
[41:38] contents and themes of the various books
[41:41] that comprise our Bible to see God's
[41:44] fingerprints on the lives actions and
[41:48] interactions of the people whose stories
[41:51] are told and here in the Old Testament
[41:55] looking for references to the Messiah
[41:58] hopefully encouragement for each of us
[42:01] to read each book individually amen
[42:05] before we read our opening scriptures
[42:06] this evening let's approach the Lord one
[42:08] more time and seek his guidance and
[42:12] presence Lord
[42:15] Jesus we're in awe of
[42:17] you we're humbled Lord to stand before
[42:21] people that you have
[42:23] purchased by your own blood by your
[42:26] Sacrifice by your love to rescue us from
[42:29] our own sins our own impulses our own
[42:32] desires our own inclinations Lord and to
[42:35] draw us to yourself as as a brother said
[42:37] Jesus said all the father hath given me
[42:41] will come I won't lose one we're so
[42:45] grateful for that promise because we
[42:47] rest in it Lord we thank you for your
[42:48] love and grace and mercy be with us this
[42:51] evening Lord as we turn into this book
[42:52] lord to see what you have for us 3,000
[42:55] years is after the events that are
[42:57] recorded that apply to us today we thank
[43:00] you for this opportunity to be together
[43:03] in Jesus precious name
[43:07] amen
[43:09] tonight we begin looking at the book of
[43:12] 2 Samuel God willing next Wednesday
[43:15] we'll finish looking while we're
[43:17] standing let's
[43:20] read of course from Deuteronomy chapter
[43:25] 17 beginning at verse 14 this passage
[43:29] includes five simple direct easily
[43:33] understood commands from the Lord to
[43:36] every King who might rule over the
[43:38] descendants of Israel we found in
[43:41] Genesis that Jacob had one command
[43:45] couldn't keep it we'll see how well the
[43:47] Kings keep these five as we continue our
[43:50] overview of the books of the Bibles
[43:52] Deuteronomy 17 beginning at verse 14
[43:55] when thou art come into the land which
[43:56] the Lord thy God giveth thee and shalt
[43:58] possess it and shalt dwell therein and
[44:00] shalt say I will set a king over me like
[44:03] as all the other nations that are around
[44:04] about
[44:06] me thus predicting the people would
[44:08] eventually demand a traditional King
[44:11] Thou shalt in any wise set him King over
[44:14] thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose
[44:18] indicating that the Lord would choose a
[44:20] man who would take on this
[44:21] responsibility and this would be one
[44:23] from among thy Brethren shalt thou set
[44:25] King over thee thou mayest not set a
[44:27] stranger over thee which is not thy
[44:29] brother so the king must be a descendant
[44:32] of Jacob and chosen by the Lord not by
[44:36] popular vote that's the Commandment to
[44:38] the people regarding a
[44:43] king but now come the Commandments to
[44:46] the King number one he shall not
[44:48] multiply horses to himself nor cause the
[44:51] people to return to Egypt to the end
[44:53] that he should multiply horses sounds a
[44:56] little strange but horses are Swift and
[44:58] Powerful they were used primarily for
[45:00] displaying military Advantage those days
[45:03] calvalry and chariots the Lord's our
[45:05] strength not the horses for as much as
[45:08] the Lord has said unto you you shall
[45:09] henceforth return no more that way
[45:12] neither shall he rule number two
[45:14] multiply wives to
[45:16] himself why not that his heart turn not
[45:20] away but as our brother just mentioned
[45:23] in his testimony Brothers
[45:26] you should each love your wife as Christ
[45:29] loved the church it's a very very
[45:33] important relationship neither shall he
[45:36] three greatly multiply to himself silver
[45:41] and
[45:42] gold and it shall be when he sth upon
[45:44] the throne of his kingdom that he shall
[45:47] for write him a copy of this law in a
[45:51] book out of that which is before the
[45:54] priests and Levites the king is subject
[45:57] to he's not above the laws of God
[46:01] Amen and it shall be it what the copy of
[46:06] the book of the law shall be with him
[46:07] why that he shall rule number five read
[46:11] therein all how many all the days of his
[46:16] life and hopefully follow each of the
[46:18] Commandments concerning a king that he
[46:20] may learn to fear to respect to honor to
[46:23] Revere the Lord your God his God to keep
[46:27] all how many all the words of this law
[46:32] and these statutes including these five
[46:34] we've just read to do
[46:37] them why well now we're told why that
[46:40] his heart be not lifted up above his
[46:42] Brethren right think of Jesus as the
[46:45] ultimate servant leader and that he
[46:48] turned not aside from the Commandment to
[46:50] the right hand or to the left to the end
[46:52] that he may prolong his days in his
[46:54] kingdom he and and his children in the
[46:57] midst of Israel that's right please be
[47:02] seated in the Book of Judges we learned
[47:05] that without strong leadership people
[47:07] drifted off into sinful behavior and
[47:10] left following the
[47:11] Lord last Wednesday evening brother
[47:13] Daniel brought us an overview of the
[47:15] book of 1
[47:17] Samuel he did 31 chapters in one night
[47:20] it's going to take me two nights to do
[47:21] 24 I'm not sure what the lesson is there
[47:24] but but but we learned of Samuel's birth
[47:27] about Eli raising him in the Tabernacle
[47:30] at Shiloh about the corrupt children of
[47:33] Eli and later of Samuel that caused the
[47:35] people to cry out for a method of
[47:37] government like the other nations around
[47:41] them don't you find it curious that the
[47:44] thing that they were objecting to that
[47:46] this guy who was a good leader had
[47:48] children who were incompetent or corrupt
[47:51] leaders and they didn't like that so now
[47:53] they're demanding a king which which is
[47:56] exactly a hereditary thing they're
[47:57] demanding to enshrine in law the very
[48:01] thing that they were trying to escape
[48:03] anyway I I don't claim to understand why
[48:07] but we saw how the Lord told Samuel that
[48:09] this desire of the people was a
[48:11] rejection of the Lord being their leader
[48:14] in L of a king leading them remember
[48:17] under the judges God picked the
[48:20] successor it wasn't a hereditary
[48:22] succession though many judges and The
[48:24] Offspring of most Jud judges tried to
[48:26] make it that way after warning the
[48:29] people what would happen under a king
[48:31] the Lord had Samuel anoint Saul as King
[48:34] in accordance with Deuteronomy and after
[48:37] Saul's failed leadership Samuel anointed
[48:40] David to succeed Saul not one of Saul's
[48:43] Sons we learned that David refused to do
[48:46] anything against Saul because Saul had
[48:48] been anointed to be king by the prophet
[48:50] Samuel at the direction of the
[48:54] Lord David show showed respect to the
[48:57] office that Saul held but not
[49:00] necessarily falty to the person of
[49:03] Saul first Samuel ended with the death
[49:06] of Saul and his son Jonathan while and
[49:07] yet another battle with the Philistines
[49:10] killed in battle at a place called Mount
[49:13] gilboa and thinking about how to
[49:16] approach second Samuel I realize that
[49:19] most days when I checked my email
[49:21] account I often scan some of the news
[49:23] headlines if we were to gather some
[49:26] headlines from the first half of the
[49:28] book of 2 Samuel they they might read
[49:30] something like
[49:34] this if you read or scanned these
[49:36] headlines would you have a reasonable
[49:38] picture of the events of the book of
[49:41] second Samuel some of them might draw
[49:44] you into the accompanying article
[49:45] beneath each headline others you might
[49:47] glance at and move on not being
[49:49] particularly
[49:51] interested how did David hear of Saul's
[49:54] death who who is Ish bosette what's with
[49:58] Abner what's this about an arc is it the
[50:01] one Noah
[50:02] built who is Nathan that he can scold
[50:05] the
[50:06] king it takes more than headlines you
[50:09] need context you probably need to dig a
[50:12] little deeper into the article and
[50:13] Beyond and that's assuming that you
[50:15] trust the reporting carried by the daily
[50:18] parchment but from these headlines I
[50:21] think one thing is clear the daily
[50:23] parchment has a lot of articles about
[50:26] this fellow named
[50:27] David last week we learned about David
[50:30] from his selection as being the next
[50:31] king to his Fame spreading throughout
[50:34] Saul's Kingdom to the death of Saul all
[50:38] in the book of 1 Samuel when reading our
[50:41] Bibles and seeking to understand what's
[50:43] written we should always keep in mind
[50:45] that parchment and ink the knowledge of
[50:48] reading and writing were precious in
[50:50] ancient times we need to keep context in
[50:53] mind not take things in is
[50:55] isolation not project our culture in our
[50:58] times into their culture in their times
[51:01] some things are left
[51:02] unsaid because either they're said
[51:05] elsewhere or because in the context at
[51:07] the time that they were written they
[51:09] were well known and didn't need to be
[51:11] explicitly
[51:14] stated let's give an example from 1 and
[51:17] 2 Samuel let's read the article
[51:19] following the first headline David hears
[51:21] of Saul's death this is found in 2
[51:23] Samuel chapter 1
[51:26] now it came to pass after the death of
[51:28] Saul when David was returned from the
[51:30] slaughter of the amalekites and David
[51:31] had Abode two days in ziklag we'll see
[51:34] where that is in a moment it came to
[51:36] pass on the third day after Saul's death
[51:39] that Behold a man came out of the camp
[51:41] from Saul with his clothes rent and dirt
[51:44] on his head and so it was when he came
[51:47] to David he fell to the Earth and did
[51:51] obedience and David said unto him from
[51:55] whence comest
[51:58] thou and he said unto him out of the
[52:01] camp of Israel am I
[52:03] escaped and David said unto him how went
[52:06] the matter I I pray you tell me and he
[52:09] answered that the people are fled from
[52:11] the battle and many of the people are
[52:13] also fallen and dead and Saul and
[52:15] Jonathan his son are dead
[52:19] also and David said to the young man
[52:22] that told him how knowest thou that Saul
[52:25] and Jonathan his son be
[52:27] dead and the young man that told him
[52:30] said as I happened to chance upon Mount
[52:33] gilboa behold Saul leaned upon his Spear
[52:37] and lo the Chariots and Horsemen
[52:39] followed hard after him and when he
[52:41] looked behind him and he saw me he
[52:45] called unto me and I answered and said
[52:48] here am I and he said unto me who are
[52:53] who are you and I answered him I am an
[52:56] amalekite and he said unto me again
[52:58] stand I pray thee upon me slay me
[53:02] anguish has come upon me because my life
[53:05] is yet whole in me so I stood upon him
[53:08] and slew him because I was sure he could
[53:12] not live after that he was fallen and
[53:14] and I took the crown that was upon his
[53:16] head and and the bracelet that was on
[53:18] his arm and have brought them thither to
[53:20] my
[53:21] Lord then David took hold on his clothes
[53:24] and rent them likewise all the men that
[53:26] were with him this was a sign of grief
[53:28] and mourning in that culture at that
[53:31] time and they mourned and wept and
[53:35] fasted until the evening for Saul for
[53:39] Jonathan his son for the people of the
[53:41] Lord for the house of Israel because
[53:44] they were Fallen By The
[53:47] Sword and David said unto the young man
[53:51] that told him where are you from where
[53:54] are you from and he answered um the son
[53:57] of a stranger an
[53:59] amalaki and David said unto him how is
[54:02] thou not afraid to stretch forth thine
[54:04] hand to destroy the Lord's
[54:06] anointed and David called one of the
[54:09] young men and said go near fall upon him
[54:12] and he smote him that he
[54:14] died and David said unto him thy blood
[54:18] be upon thy head for thy mouth hath
[54:20] testified against thee saying I have
[54:22] slain the Lord's anointed
[54:27] but last week we read another account of
[54:30] this found in 1st Samuel 31 let's read a
[54:32] brief ex just a couple of verses here
[54:35] now the Philistines fought against
[54:37] Israel and the men of Israel fled from
[54:39] before the Philistines and fell down
[54:40] slain in Mount gilboa and the
[54:43] Philistines followed hard upon Saul and
[54:45] upon his sons and the Philistines slew
[54:47] Jonathan and abinadab and rushia Saul's
[54:50] sons and the battle went s went badly
[54:53] against Saul
[54:56] The Archers hit
[54:58] him he was sore wounded of The Archers
[55:00] he was mortally wounded by an arrow he
[55:03] was going to
[55:05] die then Saul said to his armor
[55:08] Bearer draw thy sword thrust me through
[55:12] there
[55:13] with lest these uncircumcised come and
[55:16] thrust me through and and abuse
[55:19] me but his armor Bearer would not for he
[55:23] was too afraid therefore Saul took a
[55:27] sword and fell upon
[55:28] it and when his armor Bearer saw that
[55:31] Saul was dead he fell likewise upon his
[55:33] sword and died with
[55:36] him now if you only read 1st Samuel 31
[55:38] you conclude Saul committed
[55:40] suicide there's no mention of the
[55:43] amalaki but in 2 Samuel chapter 1 fills
[55:48] the space between verses four and five
[55:51] of 1st Samuel 31 we see that Saul
[55:53] already more Al wounded attempted
[55:57] suicide but failed to end his life
[55:59] quickly and instead added to his torment
[56:02] he was suffering horribly from an arrow
[56:04] as well as after intentionally falling
[56:06] on his own weapon a sord orous spear the
[56:09] amalekite came heard Saul's anguish plea
[56:13] and ended his misery as Saul
[56:17] requested Saul's armor Bearer refused
[56:19] Saul's command to kill him and stayed
[56:21] with him as he suffered Agony the the
[56:25] amalekite complied with Paul's request
[56:28] when the armor Bearer saw that Saul was
[56:30] dead he killed
[56:31] himself when David heard the report of
[56:34] the amalekite he ordered him
[56:38] killed David's an aoral quandry I think
[56:42] on the one hand David had suffered
[56:44] persecution under Saul yet he respected
[56:47] Saul's office and refused to defend
[56:51] himself what would David have done if he
[56:54] he happen to come upon Saul at this
[56:56] moment instead of the unnamed
[57:00] amalekite would he stay with him
[57:03] mortally wounded and watch him suffer
[57:06] and die in agony as he begged David to
[57:08] end his misery like he'd asked his armor
[57:11] Bearer would David obey the man who held
[57:14] the office he was respecting seeing his
[57:17] hopeless case and intense suffering and
[57:20] comply with Saul's request to quickly
[57:23] and mercifully end his pain
[57:27] which do you think he would have
[57:30] done which do you think he should have
[57:33] done what if it were you and
[57:37] Saul what would you have
[57:41] done second Samuel like the history
[57:45] preceding it and as we'll see the
[57:46] subsequent history of the descendants of
[57:48] Jacob is full of
[57:50] violence we need to remind ourselves
[57:53] that the cultural Morality In values
[57:55] placed on human life 3,000 years ago was
[57:58] Far different than our modern Western
[58:00] values and
[58:01] mores and that even today stripped of
[58:04] these values people are still given to
[58:06] the lust for personal power and a
[58:09] willingness to make or allow others to
[58:12] suffer horribly to achieve those goals
[58:15] today we can look at the horrific
[58:18] conditions of the people of the Ukraine
[58:20] as they're Meed in a desperate struggle
[58:22] for survival under the cruel onslaught
[58:24] of Putin and his Russian army the
[58:26] Ukrainian people have been depending on
[58:28] the Promises of a Fickle and polarized
[58:31] government of the United States to help
[58:33] Supply them with the means for
[58:35] survival and we see our own politicians
[58:37] are willing to break those promises
[58:40] willing to let them suffer and die in an
[58:44] effort to seek personal political
[58:46] Advantage at
[58:47] home so while second Samuel is on the
[58:49] one hand ancient history on the other
[58:52] hand it's a mirror of our world world
[58:55] today and its lessons are still relevant
[58:59] to each of us living here in Tucson in
[59:02] the 21st century
[59:04] ad well let's get back to second
[59:10] Samuel some more headlines David Mourns
[59:14] the death of Saul especially his son
[59:16] Jonathan who is very close to David in
[59:19] chapter two the Lord directs David to
[59:21] move from ziklag where he was when he
[59:24] got this message to
[59:27] heon he goes there along with his two
[59:29] wives he's anointed king over the tribal
[59:32] lands of
[59:33] Judah now we'll learn in chapter five
[59:36] that he was 30 years old when he got to
[59:39] heon and began to
[59:41] Reign well if Saul reigned 40
[59:45] years this means that Saul had been King
[59:47] for 10 years before David was even
[59:50] born and he had been King for well over
[59:53] 20 years at the time of the contest with
[59:57] Goliath David will rule in he for seven
[1:00:00] and a half years he discovers that the
[1:00:02] men of yabish Gilead recovered the
[1:00:04] bodies of Saul and his sons and buried
[1:00:06] them David extends his thanks to them
[1:00:09] meanwhile the commander of Saul's Army
[1:00:11] fellow named Abner installs one of
[1:00:14] Saul's surviving Sons as king over
[1:00:16] Israel the man's name is ishbosheth and
[1:00:19] he ruled from a place called
[1:00:21] mahanaim he was 40 years old at the time
[1:00:24] we he reigned for two years I know the
[1:00:26] math gets a little weird we're not going
[1:00:28] to go into it that's not the point
[1:00:30] tonight so I hope you can see this map
[1:00:33] those of you sitting in the back I'm
[1:00:35] sure brought your binoculars I've
[1:00:37] mentioned that many times so what you
[1:00:39] have here is in the upper part there
[1:00:42] circled in yellow Mount
[1:00:44] gilboa that's the place in Israel where
[1:00:47] Saul and Jonathan were killed and just
[1:00:49] across the Jordan River is a place
[1:00:51] called yabish Gilead that's where the
[1:00:54] people people came recovered the bodies
[1:00:56] of Saul and Jonathan and so forth and
[1:00:58] and buried them
[1:01:00] there we see uh this town mahanaim just
[1:01:05] below yabish gilad where this fellow
[1:01:07] wish boet uh has been installed as a
[1:01:10] king down here at the lower part you see
[1:01:13] an arrow from ziklag to Hebron that's
[1:01:15] where David moved the Lord told him to
[1:01:18] get out of ziklag which was essentially
[1:01:20] Philistine territory and get up to Hein
[1:01:23] um and I've left a scale of miles in
[1:01:26] there because you can see it's a fair
[1:01:27] distance from Mount uh gilboa down to
[1:01:30] ziklag that's why I took that fell it
[1:01:32] was the third day when he got there he'd
[1:01:34] been you know running a marathon for a
[1:01:37] couple of days here just above Jerusalem
[1:01:41] you can see this star around this place
[1:01:44] called
[1:01:45] gibian um and we'll uh we'll talk about
[1:01:51] gibian probably this is a good time
[1:01:56] there's a battle there chapter 2 ends
[1:01:58] with a strange battle in that town of
[1:01:59] gibian it's really a second Civil War
[1:02:02] the first being the near destruction of
[1:02:04] The Tribe of Benjamin recorded in judges
[1:02:06] here joab leads an army of David Abner
[1:02:09] leads an army of ish boset a battle
[1:02:12] ensues David's Army prevails along the
[1:02:15] way of all this stuff Abner winds up
[1:02:17] killing one of joab's Brothers in the
[1:02:19] end they say you know this is stupid
[1:02:22] we're all descendants of Jacob we
[1:02:24] shouldn't be killing each other so they
[1:02:25] agreed maybe it's a bad idea to be
[1:02:27] killing each other so they stop and they
[1:02:29] go home adner goes back to isbet joab
[1:02:32] goes back to
[1:02:33] David chapter three lists six Sons born
[1:02:37] to David and heon by six different women
[1:02:39] three of whom were his wives one of
[1:02:42] those Sons is a fellow named Absalom
[1:02:44] we'll see him we'll meet him next week
[1:02:47] second half of the book meanwhile
[1:02:49] David's arm is getting stronger ish
[1:02:51] boets is getting weaker then a
[1:02:53] disagreement ensues between uh between
[1:02:57] isbos and Abner over a concubine that
[1:02:59] had been part of Saul's
[1:03:00] household a concubine it's a strange
[1:03:03] word we don't use it today but it's a
[1:03:05] woman who cohabitated with a man was not
[1:03:07] his wife but otherwise legally bound to
[1:03:10] him so this argument between Abner and
[1:03:13] isbet causes Abner to decide to abandon
[1:03:16] isbet and turn to David as their King
[1:03:19] influence Israel to unite once again
[1:03:22] under a king
[1:03:24] so Abner and David agree to a meeting
[1:03:27] David requires return of one of his
[1:03:30] wives Michael who was the one of Saul's
[1:03:32] daughters who' been his wife and been
[1:03:34] separated now she was living in Israel
[1:03:36] under isbos she's married off to some
[1:03:38] other guy so isbet returns Michael adner
[1:03:41] meets with David they strike a deal
[1:03:45] Abner's on his way back meanwhile joab
[1:03:47] comes into town doesn't trust Abner says
[1:03:50] the guy's no good and so he goes out
[1:03:53] sets a trap kills
[1:03:55] Abner this it states is in Revenge for
[1:03:58] Abner having killed his brother back at
[1:04:00] the Battle of
[1:04:02] gibian David wasn't aware of this
[1:04:04] treachery he Mourns the loss of Abner
[1:04:06] and he curses joab for his
[1:04:10] deceit some more headlines in chapter
[1:04:13] four to angry Captain angry I'm sorry
[1:04:17] I'm old sometimes I see the right number
[1:04:19] of syllables but get the wrong word two
[1:04:22] Army captains I maybe they weren't angry
[1:04:25] plot against and kill isbos they bring
[1:04:28] his head to David in
[1:04:31] Hebron hopefully they had it in a bag
[1:04:34] David is angry with them has them
[1:04:37] executed and buries is bit's head in
[1:04:40] Abner's town in
[1:04:42] heon ab's Tomb in
[1:04:45] heon Focus L and chapter 5 the elders Of
[1:04:49] The Scribe of the tribes other than
[1:04:51] Judah come to David and heon and accept
[1:04:53] him as their King thus reuniting all the
[1:04:55] tribes under one leader David conquers
[1:04:59] Jerusalem he establishes a district
[1:05:01] there that's called the city of David
[1:05:02] and sometimes referred to as David
[1:05:04] stronghold when it says David goes into
[1:05:06] his stronghold that's in the city of
[1:05:08] David this District in Jerusalem hyram
[1:05:12] king of Ty sends Cedars carpenters and
[1:05:15] Masons to build a house for David in
[1:05:17] Jerusalem David meanwhile acquires more
[1:05:20] wives and concubines during his 33-year
[1:05:23] reign in Jerusalem
[1:05:24] 11 sons and daughters are named who were
[1:05:27] born to him in Jerusalem including a
[1:05:29] fellow named
[1:05:30] Solomon we'll meet him in First Kings
[1:05:34] mostly or beginning anyway the chapter
[1:05:37] concludes with another pair of battles
[1:05:38] with the Philistines they're always
[1:05:40] fighting the Philistines I I think that
[1:05:42] means something both take place in the
[1:05:44] nearby Valley of refaim which is about
[1:05:46] three miles west of Jerusalem and after
[1:05:48] the Second Battle the Philistines are
[1:05:49] pushed out of the Hill Country and back
[1:05:52] down to the coastal plain
[1:05:56] when are you going to stop reading
[1:05:57] headlines brother Lyall soon next we see
[1:06:00] that the Arc of the Covenant which the
[1:06:02] Philistines had captured and then
[1:06:04] returned as we learned in 1 Samuel last
[1:06:06] week is going to come to
[1:06:11] Jerusalem so this map shows the the
[1:06:15] location of kirat urum kirat juram and
[1:06:19] the distance that it goes to Jerusalem
[1:06:20] and and it's only about 8 miles it's
[1:06:22] about the same distances from here to
[1:06:24] the entrance to Tucson International
[1:06:26] Airport we're not going really far here
[1:06:28] and I don't know where along the way
[1:06:30] that dotted line is the road of the time
[1:06:32] but I just put a red X there because
[1:06:34] there's a problem somewhere along the
[1:06:36] way that that we're going to read about
[1:06:38] um so that gives you a an idea of where
[1:06:42] things are and this Valley where the
[1:06:44] Philistines were pushed out of is
[1:06:46] roughly where you see the number six on
[1:06:48] the uh scale of miles there that's
[1:06:51] approximately the valley of refaim where
[1:06:53] the they had had the big battles with
[1:06:54] the
[1:06:55] Philistines okay enough for geography no
[1:06:58] test coming up so let's move
[1:07:02] along 2 Samuel chapter 6 let's read the
[1:07:05] article behind the headline Again David
[1:07:08] gathered together all the chosen men the
[1:07:10] elite troops of Israel
[1:07:12] 30,000 that is a big deal and David
[1:07:15] arose and went with all the people that
[1:07:17] were with him from Baal of Judah to
[1:07:20] bring up from th the Ark of God whose
[1:07:23] name is called by the name of the Lord
[1:07:25] of hosts that dwelleth between the
[1:07:29] cherubim and they set the Ark of God on
[1:07:31] a new cart well the Philistines had done
[1:07:34] that they put the Ark on a cart and send
[1:07:36] it to Israel so work for them might as
[1:07:38] well work for
[1:07:39] us and brought it out of the house of
[1:07:41] abinadab that was in giba now gibba is a
[1:07:44] word that means Hill so it's not the
[1:07:46] town of gibba but it's on the hill the G
[1:07:49] the giba the town was cuat urum as we
[1:07:52] learned in 1st Samuel chapter 16 and
[1:07:54] seven and saw on the map and usza and
[1:07:56] AIO the sons of abinadab drove the new
[1:08:00] cart and they brought it out of the
[1:08:02] house of abinadab which was at gibba
[1:08:04] that the hill of kirat urum accompanying
[1:08:07] the Ark of God and AO went before the
[1:08:11] ark and David and all the house of
[1:08:14] Israel played before the Lord on all
[1:08:17] manner of instruments made of furwood
[1:08:19] even on Harps sometimes known as liars
[1:08:23] and on sultes otherwise known as loots
[1:08:27] on timberl tambourines cornets these are
[1:08:30] wooden castets not brass horns remember
[1:08:33] these are made of
[1:08:34] furwood and on
[1:08:36] symbols well I didn't know what a liar
[1:08:40] looked like l y r i know what an l i a r
[1:08:43] looks like sometimes but not an l y r e
[1:08:47] um these homonyms but and I didn't know
[1:08:49] what a salry was so I got a couple of
[1:08:52] pictures here to give you an idea yeah
[1:08:54] so so if they're playing on a lie or a
[1:08:55] harp Little David play on your harp
[1:08:57] Hallelujah you probably know that song
[1:08:59] from Sunday School uh that guy in the
[1:09:01] red shirt there is is playing a liar the
[1:09:04] loot I couldn't find an example of an
[1:09:06] ancient loot apparently they're not very
[1:09:08] popular these days but this is a a clay
[1:09:11] statue that was excavated from
[1:09:14] Mesopotamia uh Middle East that dates
[1:09:16] back to about Christ time between 2
[1:09:19] Century BC and and and Christ and you
[1:09:23] can see that it's a long stringed
[1:09:24] instrument that's
[1:09:26] plucked uh they didn't have bows in
[1:09:28] those days they just use those for
[1:09:30] arrows but they they like to pluck
[1:09:32] strings so I thought you'd be interested
[1:09:35] in seeing that we'll move on when they
[1:09:38] came to nun's threshing floor usza put
[1:09:43] forth his hand to the Ark of God and
[1:09:45] took hold of it for the oxen shook it it
[1:09:47] was going to fall off the cart he didn't
[1:09:48] want this precious thing damaged so he
[1:09:52] stepped into protect
[1:09:55] protected and the anger of the Lord was
[1:09:58] kindled against Jah and God smoked him
[1:10:02] there for his error and there he died by
[1:10:05] the Ark of
[1:10:07] God David was not a happy camper he was
[1:10:11] displeased because the Lord had made a
[1:10:13] breach upon usza he called the name of
[1:10:16] the place Perez usza perz means breach
[1:10:18] so breach of usza to this
[1:10:21] day and David was afraid of the Lord
[1:10:23] that day and said how shall the Ark of
[1:10:26] the Lord come to me so David would not
[1:10:30] remove the Ark of the Lord unto him into
[1:10:32] the city of David but David carried it
[1:10:34] aside into the house of obededom the
[1:10:37] gitite and the Ark of the Lord continued
[1:10:40] In The House of obededom the Getti three
[1:10:43] months and the Lord blessed obededom and
[1:10:46] all his household now brother brandham
[1:10:49] talked about this event calling it doing
[1:10:51] God of service in this case bringing the
[1:10:53] the ark without meaning outside of his
[1:10:56] will the method of Transport the ark was
[1:10:59] not to be touched it was to be carried
[1:11:01] on poles through rings on either side of
[1:11:03] the Ark and only on the shoulders of
[1:11:05] Levites specifically the descendants of
[1:11:07] Kath we learned this in numbers 330- 31
[1:11:11] glad you remembered that okay so what
[1:11:15] happens here it was told King David
[1:11:18] saying the Lord has blessed the house of
[1:11:20] obad Edom and all that pertaineth unto
[1:11:23] him because of the Ark of God so David
[1:11:26] went and brought up the Ark of God from
[1:11:28] the house of obededom into the city of
[1:11:30] David with
[1:11:32] gladness well wait a minute last time it
[1:11:36] ended in disaster this time with
[1:11:38] gladness what happened brother L glad
[1:11:41] you asked the king complied with the
[1:11:44] commands of Deuteronomy 17 our opening
[1:11:46] scripture the detail that he read is
[1:11:50] found in 1st Chronicles 15 let's let's
[1:11:52] just jump to 1ron Chronicles for a
[1:11:54] moment here David called for zadak and
[1:11:57] abat the priests and for the Levites for
[1:12:00] uel and asiah and Joel and shemiah and
[1:12:03] elel and aminadab and said unto them ye
[1:12:06] are the chief of the fathers of the
[1:12:07] Levites sanctify
[1:12:10] yourselves both ye and your brethren
[1:12:12] that you may bring up the Ark of the
[1:12:14] Lord God of Israel un the place that I
[1:12:16] have prepared for it for because you did
[1:12:20] it not at the
[1:12:21] first David understands what going on
[1:12:24] the Lord Our God made a breach upon us
[1:12:27] for that we sought him not after the due
[1:12:30] order so the priests and Levites
[1:12:32] Sanctified themselves to bring up the
[1:12:34] Ark of the Lord God of Israel and the
[1:12:37] children of the Levites bear the Ark of
[1:12:40] God upon their shoulders with the staves
[1:12:42] thereon as Moses commanded according to
[1:12:45] the word of the Lord so it's now been
[1:12:47] transported property properly remember
[1:12:49] the duty of the king is to study and
[1:12:53] conform form to apply the law now he's
[1:12:57] doing it we go back to 2 Samuel we
[1:12:59] understand why they're happy now and so
[1:13:01] it was that they bear the Ark of the
[1:13:03] Lord the Levites when they'd gone six
[1:13:05] Paces David arranged to have sacrificed
[1:13:08] oxen and
[1:13:10] fatlings and David danced before the
[1:13:12] Lord I can't do it with all his might
[1:13:16] and David was girded with a linen ephod
[1:13:19] now how many of you have ever worn a
[1:13:21] linen
[1:13:22] ephod no what a linen ephod what what is
[1:13:25] that it it's a priest's upper garment
[1:13:28] think of it as a kind of a long
[1:13:30] vest he was exuberantly happy because he
[1:13:34] knew where he had failed before he knew
[1:13:37] why the problem had occurred and he was
[1:13:38] confident the ark would now be
[1:13:40] successfully transported to its prepared
[1:13:42] place he was
[1:13:44] celebrating in his
[1:13:47] obedience to the Lord something about
[1:13:49] Sunday and obedience I thought so so we
[1:13:52] read here that David and all the house
[1:13:54] of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord
[1:13:57] with shouting and with the sound of the
[1:14:00] trumpet Somebody's Watching from a
[1:14:03] window Michael Saul's daughter and one
[1:14:06] of David's wives saw him and was
[1:14:09] embarrassed she scolded him about his
[1:14:11] behavior and he said he'd do it again
[1:14:13] and more so Michael remained Barren as a
[1:14:16] punishment from the Lord for her
[1:14:21] attitude be careful what you say
[1:14:26] back to the Daily parchment headlines
[1:14:28] with the ark secure in Jerusalem you now
[1:14:30] come to chapter
[1:14:33] 7 this is perhaps my favorite chapter in
[1:14:36] 2
[1:14:37] Samuel so let's read it
[1:14:40] together it came to pass when the king
[1:14:43] sat in his house and the Lord had given
[1:14:46] him rest roundabout from all his
[1:14:51] enemies he could can relax nice fire
[1:14:55] going in the fireplace feet
[1:14:58] up one of his friends is there a fellow
[1:15:00] named Nathan Nathan happens to be a
[1:15:03] prophet he also happens to be his friend
[1:15:06] the king said unto Nathan the Prophet
[1:15:08] this is a conversation between friends
[1:15:11] Fellowship sharing enjoying each other's
[1:15:13] company see now well look here consider
[1:15:16] this Nathan I dwell in a house of Cedar
[1:15:20] but the Ark of God dwelleth within
[1:15:22] curtains that's just doesn't seem right
[1:15:24] to me my
[1:15:26] friend and and Nathan though a prophet
[1:15:29] was now speaking as a friend who knew
[1:15:32] David very very well Nathan said to the
[1:15:36] king go do all that is in thine heart
[1:15:39] for the Lord's with you David you're a
[1:15:42] good guy you've got a good heart this is
[1:15:44] on your heart go for it
[1:15:47] bro now we
[1:15:49] see that not everything a prophet says
[1:15:52] is thus saith the Lord regardless of
[1:15:56] office we're all
[1:15:58] humans so Nathan told him one thing and
[1:16:01] it came to pass that night that the word
[1:16:04] of the Lord came unto Nathan oh now he's
[1:16:07] a prophet saying go and tell my servant
[1:16:11] David thus saith the Lord so now it will
[1:16:15] be thus saith the Lord Nathan is a
[1:16:17] prophet though still a friend thus saith
[1:16:20] the Lord shalt thou build an house for
[1:16:22] me to dwell in whereas I have not dwelt
[1:16:25] in any house since the time that I
[1:16:27] brought up the children of Israel out of
[1:16:28] Egypt even to this day but have walked
[1:16:31] in a tent and in a Tabernacle in all the
[1:16:34] places where I have walked with all the
[1:16:36] children of Israel spake i a word with
[1:16:39] any of the tribes of Israel whom I
[1:16:41] commanded to Feed My People Israel
[1:16:44] saying why build ye not me a house of
[1:16:49] Cedar now therefore so shalt thou say
[1:16:52] unto my my servant David thus saith the
[1:16:56] Lord of
[1:16:57] hosts I took thee from the Sheep coat
[1:17:00] from following the Sheep to be ruler
[1:17:03] over my people over Israel whose people
[1:17:06] were they brother
[1:17:08] Aaron The Davids no they were the Lords
[1:17:12] they were the Lords and I was with thee
[1:17:15] withs soever thou wentest and have cut
[1:17:18] off all thine enemies out of thy sight
[1:17:20] have made thee a great name like unto
[1:17:22] the name of the great men that are in
[1:17:24] the earth moreover I will speaking of
[1:17:28] the
[1:17:29] future I will first appoint a place for
[1:17:33] My People Israel and will plant them
[1:17:36] that they may dwell in a place of their
[1:17:38] own and move no more and second neither
[1:17:42] shall the children of wickedness afflict
[1:17:45] them anymore as before time and as since
[1:17:48] the time that I commanded judges to be
[1:17:50] over My People Israel and have caused
[1:17:52] thee to rest from all thine enemies also
[1:17:56] in addition to these things the Lord tth
[1:17:59] thee that he will make thee in house
[1:18:03] what David has a house of Cedar that's
[1:18:06] what started this whole conversation
[1:18:08] he's wanting to make a better place for
[1:18:09] the ark God speaking of other things
[1:18:14] Dynasty and when thy days be fulfilled
[1:18:17] you're going to die David you're going
[1:18:18] to go the way of All Flesh and thou
[1:18:20] shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set
[1:18:23] up thy seed one one of your descendants
[1:18:25] after thee which shall proceed out of
[1:18:27] thy bowels shall he's not born yet David
[1:18:30] and I will establish his kingdom now
[1:18:33] there's two things going on here there's
[1:18:36] two levels two two things going on can
[1:18:40] you tell what the each
[1:18:42] are he this descendant
[1:18:45] shall might
[1:18:49] perhaps shall build an house for you no
[1:18:54] for my name and I will establish the
[1:18:56] Throne of your no the Throne of his
[1:19:01] kingdom
[1:19:03] forever I will be his father he shall be
[1:19:07] my son if he commit iniquity I'll
[1:19:10] chastise with the rod of men with the
[1:19:11] stpes of their children of men but my
[1:19:13] Mercy shall not depart from him as I
[1:19:17] took it from Saul whom I put away before
[1:19:20] thee and thine house and thy kingdom
[1:19:23] shall be established forever before thee
[1:19:26] and thy Throne shall be established
[1:19:30] forever how through this descendant that
[1:19:33] he's referring to according to all these
[1:19:36] words and according to all this Vision
[1:19:39] so did Nathan speak unto
[1:19:41] David well when Nathan shares this David
[1:19:45] breaks into worship it's exactly what
[1:19:48] God desires from us worship I I
[1:19:51] personally feel that
[1:19:53] the 15 20 minutes before
[1:19:56] service then when the worship leader
[1:19:58] comes in the next 15 or 20 minutes I
[1:20:00] think those are some of the most
[1:20:01] important minutes in the entire service
[1:20:03] because we're ministering to the Lord
[1:20:06] not the Lord ministering to us although
[1:20:09] we often does but we're ministering to
[1:20:11] him what's more important him or us
[1:20:15] brother Daniel put a virtual sign up
[1:20:18] here on Sunday morning said it's all
[1:20:21] about him I don't know if you can read
[1:20:23] that sign but it's there it's there you
[1:20:27] just keep looking one of these days
[1:20:28] you'll see
[1:20:30] it so uh it's even if we like David
[1:20:36] apparently don't completely understand
[1:20:38] what he's saying to us at first glance
[1:20:40] you might think Nathan and therefore the
[1:20:41] Lord is speaking of Solomon and the
[1:20:43] temple that Solomon built and at one
[1:20:45] level that's that's true but David's
[1:20:49] physical Dynasty as king did end right
[1:20:53] the kingdom split at Solomon's death and
[1:20:55] David's descendants for few hundred
[1:20:58] years ruled Judah not all of Israel and
[1:21:01] then they ruled absolutely
[1:21:04] nothing the Lord's looking far beyond
[1:21:06] that more than Solomon this is a
[1:21:08] prophecy thus saith the Lord about the
[1:21:11] Messiah yes it's about Jesus not yet
[1:21:15] born God will be his father not like a
[1:21:18] father to him but I will be his father
[1:21:22] and he shall
[1:21:23] be my son right the only begotten right
[1:21:27] this isn't Solomon it's Jesus and this
[1:21:30] house of the Messiah will be established
[1:21:33] forever it was established 2,000 years
[1:21:36] ago and it's still in existence it's not
[1:21:38] the chain of descendants of David
[1:21:40] leading to the final conquest and deart
[1:21:42] under Nebuchadnezzar some 500 years
[1:21:44] later the temple Solomon built was
[1:21:47] destroyed and rebuilt and destroyed
[1:21:51] again the Temple of the lord it's in our
[1:21:54] hearts it's in his people what we call
[1:21:57] the body of Christ it's part of that
[1:22:00] body we should Worship the Lord with joy
[1:22:03] and
[1:22:07] gratitude
[1:22:09] headlines David's victories chapter
[1:22:12] eight details conquest by David and his
[1:22:15] army but in
[1:22:16] this I think we see a dark side to
[1:22:20] David's character and some of these
[1:22:22] Victor let's just read a couple of
[1:22:23] verses here 2 Samuel
[1:22:26] 8:2 and he David smoked Moab we remember
[1:22:31] Moab from Ruth a couple of weeks
[1:22:33] ago
[1:22:36] and this is just I measured them with a
[1:22:39] line casting them down to the ground
[1:22:42] even with two lines measured he to put
[1:22:44] to death and with one full line to keep
[1:22:46] alive in other words he had this people
[1:22:49] in this place who conquered lay down lay
[1:22:51] down lay down on the ground lay lat on
[1:22:52] lat
[1:22:54] on okay I've got this link there okay
[1:22:57] this group here group a you go see joab
[1:23:00] joab kill them
[1:23:03] all okay group two um go see joab joab
[1:23:08] kill them all group three
[1:23:12] uh go see this guy he's going to send
[1:23:15] you to the goolag you're you're slaves
[1:23:17] now this next group go see joab he's
[1:23:21] going to kill you can you
[1:23:23] imagine can you imagine being a moabit
[1:23:26] and being put through that can you what
[1:23:29] what is David thinking doing that I
[1:23:32] don't know I to me I see a dark side of
[1:23:35] his character perhaps I'm wrong so the
[1:23:37] moabites became David's servants and
[1:23:40] brought
[1:23:41] gifts David SM also had edzer son of
[1:23:45] Rahab king of zoba and as he went to
[1:23:48] recover his border at the river
[1:23:50] Euphrates and David took took from him a
[1:23:53] th000 chariots and 700 Horsemen and
[1:23:56] 20,000
[1:23:57] footmen and David hoed all the Chariot
[1:23:59] horses what does that mean hod anybody
[1:24:02] know what that means hamstr strong means
[1:24:04] that he got the tendons in their back
[1:24:06] leg crippled the horses perhaps killed
[1:24:09] them if they couldn't walk anymore to
[1:24:10] get to food and to Graves and so forth
[1:24:13] this is the very thing that Levi and
[1:24:15] Simeon did that in Genesis 49 when uh uh
[1:24:19] Jacob is making his you know
[1:24:23] uh Joseph will be like a branch going
[1:24:25] overall making all these predictions and
[1:24:26] prophecies he said Simeon and Levi have
[1:24:29] nothing to do with these guys they're
[1:24:31] evil Wicked people they they they did
[1:24:34] this to ox and found and Sheck
[1:24:38] them so he did this to the horses but
[1:24:40] reserved for them a 100 chariots why he
[1:24:43] did that why he didn't just kill the
[1:24:45] horses I I don't know but it just seems
[1:24:48] like a cruel thing to do to the
[1:24:51] horses now with a centralized government
[1:24:54] we have to have an Administration right
[1:24:57] officials a cabinet a bureaucracy
[1:25:00] there's a part of Verse 18 that can
[1:25:02] cause confusion I'm going to read you
[1:25:03] the second half of Verse 18 of of
[1:25:06] chapter 8 here in three different
[1:25:08] translations in the King James version
[1:25:11] Verse 18 ends it says David's Sons were
[1:25:13] Chief rulers if you read in the NIV or
[1:25:16] the ESV it says David's Sons were
[1:25:19] priests if you read in the NLT it says
[1:25:22] David son served as Priestly
[1:25:24] leaders they can't be
[1:25:27] priests they can't be priests it's a
[1:25:29] long tribe they can't do it but the
[1:25:33] Hebrew word is Cohen in the plural cenim
[1:25:36] and it usually is translated as priests
[1:25:39] but but the root of the word it means
[1:25:41] Minister one who
[1:25:44] intervenes and that's the root so it
[1:25:46] doesn't mean that they assumed any
[1:25:48] religious Priestly office so be careful
[1:25:50] when you're reading and you come
[1:25:52] across and it says David's son served as
[1:25:55] priests you know that can't be right dig
[1:25:58] in find out what's going on so just just
[1:26:02] a note to just be a little bit careful
[1:26:05] back to the Daily
[1:26:07] parchment chapter
[1:26:09] n contrasts the barbarity of chapter 8
[1:26:12] with David's kindness to Jonathan's
[1:26:14] surviving son
[1:26:16] mbishi he was injured resulting in being
[1:26:19] lame in both feet we told and he was is
[1:26:22] hidden during the confusion after
[1:26:24] Abner's death several years before we
[1:26:26] talked about that earlier this evening
[1:26:28] David assigned to mbth all the
[1:26:32] inheritance pertaining to Saul and
[1:26:34] Jonathan and he regularly dined with
[1:26:37] David as one of the king's
[1:26:41] Sons chapter 10 relates a series of
[1:26:44] battles between Israel and the ammonites
[1:26:46] and the
[1:26:47] syrians resulting in victories for
[1:26:51] Israel
[1:26:53] now we come to one of the saddest
[1:26:55] stories of personal moral collapse in
[1:26:57] this portion of the scripture 2 Samuel
[1:27:00] chapter
[1:27:01] 11 it sets the stage for some things
[1:27:05] here David's Army is out fighting the
[1:27:08] ammonites David for whatever reason
[1:27:12] stays behind in
[1:27:13] Jerusalem one afternoon he walks out on
[1:27:16] the roof of his house it's quite common
[1:27:18] in those days no air conditioning not
[1:27:20] even swamp coolers
[1:27:22] the roof was one of the coolest places
[1:27:24] if you read any history of the City of
[1:27:26] Tucson you'll find that it was very
[1:27:28] common practice here as well people
[1:27:29] would go up on the roof in the afternoon
[1:27:31] sleep up there in the evening and so
[1:27:33] forth because it was cooler than down at
[1:27:35] ground
[1:27:36] level well he's strolling around the
[1:27:39] roof of his Palace and he looks over and
[1:27:42] he sees a woman washing
[1:27:44] herself David decides he wants
[1:27:47] her David knows she's the wife of Uriah
[1:27:51] Uriah is listed among David's Mighty Men
[1:27:54] as one of his top 37 Warriors David
[1:27:58] knows this guy this guy has put his life
[1:28:00] on the line for David Time and Time and
[1:28:02] Time Again listed in 2 Samuel 23:39 and
[1:28:06] 1st Chronicles
[1:28:08] 11:41 and he had to be a man of some
[1:28:11] rank or he couldn't have had his house
[1:28:12] right next door to the
[1:28:14] Palace location location location isn't
[1:28:17] just about modern real
[1:28:19] estate so he sends for her any
[1:28:22] way and has relations with her he knows
[1:28:25] what he's doing she becomes pregnant
[1:28:29] David tries to hide his sin so he sends
[1:28:32] for Uriah her husband to come home from
[1:28:34] the front lines for a weekend's rest
[1:28:37] figuring he'll probably be with his wife
[1:28:39] during that time and this will hide
[1:28:41] David's
[1:28:43] soon Uriah is a better man than that he
[1:28:46] doesn't do it David sends him back to
[1:28:48] the
[1:28:49] Battlefront and he has Uriah carry a
[1:28:52] written message to joab the Army
[1:28:55] commander and in it in the message that
[1:28:57] he has Uriah carry Jacob David directs
[1:29:02] joab to put Uriah into the thickest of
[1:29:04] the fighting and then withdraw and
[1:29:05] abandon him to be killed by the enemy so
[1:29:08] we not only violate uriah's wife he
[1:29:10] makes Uriah carry his death notice
[1:29:12] without even knowing
[1:29:14] it joab does this Uriah is killed joab
[1:29:20] sends a messenger to David telling of
[1:29:22] uriah's death David tells joab to keep
[1:29:26] quiet about it saying well the sword
[1:29:30] devoureth one as well as another and
[1:29:33] encourages joab to fight on and take the
[1:29:36] ammonite
[1:29:39] City uriah's wife baath Sheba learns of
[1:29:43] the death of her husband and goes into
[1:29:46] mourning at the end of the time of mour
[1:29:48] David sends for her and she becomes
[1:29:50] another of his men many wives she gives
[1:29:54] birth to an unnamed son the result of
[1:29:57] her pregnancy by
[1:29:59] David David pretends nothing ever
[1:30:02] happened cover up reminds me of a bit of
[1:30:06] something that was called Watergate back
[1:30:08] about 50 years ago in my
[1:30:12] lifetime let's see what happens
[1:30:13] afterward from chapter 12 which will be
[1:30:15] the last chapter that we draw from this
[1:30:18] evening 2 Samuel 12 verse1
[1:30:22] and the Lord sent Nathan unto
[1:30:26] David and Nathan came unto him and said
[1:30:29] unto David there were two men in one
[1:30:32] city one was rich David this guy was
[1:30:36] just dirty rich the other guy was dirt
[1:30:38] poor the rich man had many flocks and
[1:30:42] herds the poor man had nothing but but
[1:30:45] he had one little you lamb which he had
[1:30:48] bought and nourished up they grew up
[1:30:51] together with him and with his children
[1:30:54] it it ate of of of this man's food drank
[1:30:57] of his own cup lay in his bosom was unto
[1:31:01] him as a daughter she he really loved
[1:31:04] this little lamb she was greatly
[1:31:07] loved and there came a traveler unto the
[1:31:10] rich man and and the rich man spared to
[1:31:14] take of his own flock and of his own
[1:31:16] herd I've got 10,000 I don't want to
[1:31:18] have
[1:31:20] 99,999 to dress to prepare a meal for
[1:31:23] the wayfaring man that was come unto him
[1:31:25] but took the poor man's lamb and dressed
[1:31:28] it he stole the poor man's you and
[1:31:30] slaughtered it for the man that was come
[1:31:35] to visit
[1:31:36] him
[1:31:38] why simply because he
[1:31:41] could reminds me of events 30 years ago
[1:31:45] in the White House and
[1:31:47] Clinton's remorseful statement was I did
[1:31:50] it simply because because I could power
[1:31:54] so David's anger was greatly kindled
[1:31:58] kindled means inflame you start a fire
[1:32:00] with kindling before it bursts into big
[1:32:02] Flames was greatly kindled against the
[1:32:04] man and he said to Nathan as the Lord
[1:32:09] liveth the man that has done this thing
[1:32:12] shall surely die he shall restore the
[1:32:15] lamb fourfold because a he did this
[1:32:19] thing and B because because he had no
[1:32:26] pity and Nathan said to David Thou Art
[1:32:31] the man look in the mirror David you not
[1:32:35] only took the you representing basba you
[1:32:38] also had zero pity but killed Uriah all
[1:32:43] David simply because you
[1:32:47] could thus saith the Lord God of Israel
[1:32:52] I anointed thee King over Israel I
[1:32:56] delivered thee out of the hand of Saul I
[1:33:00] gave thee thy Master's house and thy
[1:33:02] Master's wives into thy bosom and gave
[1:33:05] Thee the house of Israel and of
[1:33:07] Judah and if that had been too little
[1:33:10] David if that wasn't good enough I would
[1:33:13] moreover have given unto thee other
[1:33:16] things such and such
[1:33:18] things
[1:33:20] wherefore in light of all of this David
[1:33:24] why hast thou
[1:33:26] despised the Commandment of the Lord to
[1:33:29] do evil in his
[1:33:31] sight and thou has killed Uriah the
[1:33:35] hittite with the sword and has taken his
[1:33:38] wife to be thy wife and has slain him
[1:33:41] with not your own sword but you use the
[1:33:45] sword of the children of
[1:33:49] Ammon now therefore for because of this
[1:33:53] the sword shall never depart from thine
[1:33:57] house because thou
[1:33:59] Hast what what did you do David you've
[1:34:05] despised me the Lord you ignored my
[1:34:09] commands to a King and has taken the
[1:34:12] wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy
[1:34:16] wife thus saeth the Lord behold
[1:34:22] I will raise up evil against thee out of
[1:34:25] thine own house and I will take thy
[1:34:30] wives before thine eyes and give them
[1:34:34] unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with
[1:34:37] thy wives in the sight of the son not
[1:34:41] hidden for thou did it secretly but I
[1:34:45] will do this thing before all Israel and
[1:34:49] before the son in plain sight
[1:34:56] openly and David
[1:34:58] said in a massive understatement unto
[1:35:02] Nathan I have sinned against the
[1:35:05] Lord Nathan said unto David the Lord
[1:35:10] also hath put away thy
[1:35:12] sin God has forgiven you David you're
[1:35:16] not going to die your sins forgiven but
[1:35:20] you're not going to go on punished Paul
[1:35:23] reminds us of this in Galatians 6 be not
[1:35:27] deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a
[1:35:30] man Seth that shall he also
[1:35:33] reap he that Seth to his flesh shall
[1:35:36] reap of the flesh corruption he that
[1:35:40] Seth to the spirit shall of the spirit
[1:35:43] reap life
[1:35:45] Everlasting back to 2 Samuel how be
[1:35:49] it your con consequences here David
[1:35:53] because by this deed thou Hast given
[1:35:56] great occasion to the enemies of the
[1:35:58] Lord to
[1:36:00] blaspheme David you have really messed
[1:36:04] up your
[1:36:06] testimony the child also that is born
[1:36:09] unto thee shall surely die innocent
[1:36:13] child didn't do
[1:36:16] anything his life will be forfeit and
[1:36:19] Nathan departed un to his house and the
[1:36:23] Lord
[1:36:25] who the Lord struck the child that
[1:36:28] uriah's wife bear unto David and it was
[1:36:32] very
[1:36:33] sick well David fasts and prays for the
[1:36:36] child which after all is
[1:36:38] innocent after seven days of illness the
[1:36:42] unnamed son the baby
[1:36:45] dies David he's been fasting he's been
[1:36:49] praying he gets up cleanses himself sits
[1:36:52] down to eat doesn't
[1:36:54] mourn his staff are surprised then said
[1:36:58] his servants unto him what thing is this
[1:37:00] that thou Hast done thou do fast and
[1:37:03] weep for the child while it was alive
[1:37:05] but when the child was dead thou just
[1:37:07] rise and and eat
[1:37:10] bread and David said while the child was
[1:37:13] yet alive I fasted and wept I said who
[1:37:17] can tell whether God will be gracious to
[1:37:19] me that the child may live live but now
[1:37:23] he's dead why should I fast can I bring
[1:37:27] him back again I shall go to him but he
[1:37:31] shall not return to
[1:37:37] me verse
[1:37:41] 24 David comforted bath Sheba his wife
[1:37:44] and went in unto her and lay with her
[1:37:46] and she bear a son and he called his
[1:37:48] name Solomon in Hebrew schomo means
[1:37:50] peaceful
[1:37:52] and the Lord loved
[1:37:53] him and he sent by the hand of Nathan
[1:37:56] the prophet and he called his name yadia
[1:37:59] meaning beloved of yah because of the
[1:38:04] lord we often think that Solomon was
[1:38:08] conceived and born shortly after the
[1:38:10] death of the first baby but the listings
[1:38:13] found elsewhere suggest that he was the
[1:38:15] fourth living son that David had by ba
[1:38:17] Sheba in Jerusalem who was several years
[1:38:20] later later see 2 Samuel 5:14 and
[1:38:24] especially 1st Chronicles
[1:38:26] 3:5 for the list of his sons by Beth
[1:38:30] Sheeba and in both cases the fourth name
[1:38:33] is Solomon implying that he was the
[1:38:35] fourth
[1:38:36] born chapter 12 and thus the first half
[1:38:39] of 2 Samuel ends in a flashback to the
[1:38:42] time shortly before or shortly after
[1:38:45] uriah's death joab defeating R Rabbi the
[1:38:49] Royal City of the ammonites joab AB
[1:38:51] summons David to come and finish the job
[1:38:53] so the credit for the victory will go to
[1:38:55] David and not to
[1:38:58] joab David does
[1:39:01] so David is a very complex person he's
[1:39:04] not the two-dimensional child hero with
[1:39:07] a sling killing Goliath that we picture
[1:39:09] him from Sunday school or on a flannel
[1:39:11] graph we saw how he loved the Lord
[1:39:15] danced with all his might yet in Moab we
[1:39:19] saw he could be cruel and
[1:39:21] hard he was willing to kill one of his
[1:39:24] best warriors to hide his own sin quick
[1:39:28] to see and rail against sin and
[1:39:31] others I don't know about you but I can
[1:39:35] certainly see myself reflected in many
[1:39:37] of David's
[1:39:39] shortcomings Lord help me to see and
[1:39:42] overcome my many faults if the musicians
[1:39:45] would please
[1:39:46] come we saw how David's desire to
[1:39:49] elevate the Lord to build build a better
[1:39:51] place for the ark than a mere tent led
[1:39:53] to one of the clearest Prophecies of the
[1:39:55] coming Messiah we've seen so far in our
[1:39:58] review of the books of the Bible not
[1:40:00] just a prophet like me as Moses said but
[1:40:03] now is revealed to be the son of Jehovah
[1:40:06] to rule an everlasting
[1:40:09] Kingdom we saw in the Book of Ruth where
[1:40:13] one from a despised people the Lord
[1:40:15] didn't want in the congregation Rose to
[1:40:18] become an ancestor of David and through
[1:40:21] the prophecy recorded in 2 Samuel 7 an
[1:40:24] ancestor of the Messianic line here we
[1:40:27] see a victim of an act of selfishness
[1:40:30] and sin the victim becomes another
[1:40:34] ancestor of the Messiah ba Sheba the
[1:40:38] third of only three male ancestors of
[1:40:41] Jesus adoptive parents recorded in the
[1:40:43] gospel of Matthew the only three ladies
[1:40:46] that we know of Rahab Ruth basba
[1:40:52] you may recall when we concluded the
[1:40:54] Book of Genesis I said that the theme of
[1:40:56] Genesis could be summed up in one
[1:40:58] word
[1:41:00] Grace we see the first half of 2 Samuel
[1:41:03] and we'll see in the second half next
[1:41:04] Wednesday evening Lord willing see the
[1:41:07] prophecy against David in chap 12: 10
[1:41:10] and 11 fulfilled in the second half but
[1:41:14] I think all of second Samuel can be
[1:41:15] summarized with the same
[1:41:18] declaration it's about
[1:41:21] God's grace it's all about
[1:41:24] him the love unmar favor bestowed upon
[1:41:29] us through the Redemptive Act of
[1:41:33] Calvary as brother Daniel Comes to close

[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:26] sins makes me feel very
[1:44:31] sad it's story brother the ly closed on
[1:44:34] and we all know
[1:44:36] it but
[1:44:38] how Uriah the wonderful man one of
[1:44:43] David's Mighty
[1:44:46] Men how David took his wife and and then
[1:44:50] he goes goes to the
[1:44:53] Prophet The
[1:44:55] Prophet tells him that story and do you
[1:44:57] see how David
[1:45:00] judged and David said that man will die
[1:45:04] but do you see how God came in and
[1:45:08] Nathan said David you are that man and
[1:45:12] you're not going to
[1:45:13] die and I thought it was
[1:45:17] beautiful how I don't know how many
[1:45:19] times I've read that story brother a
[1:45:21] while and I I see David and and I know
[1:45:24] that he stopped fasting when the when
[1:45:27] the boy died and and
[1:45:32] then he eats and he says I can't bring
[1:45:35] him back he says but I'm going to go see
[1:45:38] him one day and I thought that's just
[1:45:42] that's
[1:45:43] beautiful to think how David and so many
[1:45:47] of
[1:45:48] us as brother said there are
[1:45:51] consequences to our
[1:45:53] sin those
[1:45:55] consequences aren't necessarily
[1:45:59] hell because of the grace of our Lord
[1:46:02] Jesus Christ and and the blood that was
[1:46:04] shed on Calvary but when we sin in the
[1:46:11] flesh we will answer for our sins in the
[1:46:15] flesh there are consequences that we
[1:46:17] have to pay just because we have come to
[1:46:20] the altar we've given our hearts to the
[1:46:21] Lord we've repented of those sins there
[1:46:24] are still consequences to those sins and
[1:46:29] that story of David I don't
[1:46:32] understand how David could be a man
[1:46:34] after God's Own Heart and such a
[1:46:38] tremendous tremendous story of David and
[1:46:40] a tremendous character but how he could
[1:46:43] have done some of the things that he
[1:46:45] did tell you the truth by the while I
[1:46:47] just don't understand it but
[1:46:51] I do in that whole story as brother
[1:46:54] Lyall said I see such Grace such Grace
[1:46:59] from the Lord Jesus and I love the way
[1:47:01] David he didn't deny it he didn't say he
[1:47:04] didn't try to make excuses he just said
[1:47:06] I have
[1:47:07] sinned and he just threw himself there
[1:47:11] at the altar of
[1:47:13] God and God had mercy on him brother Joe
[1:47:16] would you come up and close in prayer
[1:47:19] let's all stand
[1:47:22] I do appreciate brother Lyle's
[1:47:26] sermon and uh it's a very hard
[1:47:31] thing to tell some of these stories but
[1:47:35] I
[1:47:39] just both of you come up here come here
[1:47:42] come here both of you no both of you
[1:47:44] come
[1:47:45] up that was my fault come up
[1:47:49] here
[1:47:53] you told me a
[1:47:54] testimony the other day right
[1:48:01] good God bless you God bless you my name
[1:48:04] is brother Joe as
[1:48:07] well there's not many of us but yes I I
[1:48:11] was speaking with brother Dan um maybe
[1:48:15] last Wednesday night and just shared
[1:48:17] briefly a testimony and he uh it struck
[1:48:20] him and he said you know maybe I get you
[1:48:22] to share that with the
[1:48:23] church uh it was let me
[1:48:29] think I guess it was 20 2019 and I was
[1:48:34] in a uh coffee
[1:48:36] shop and uh a gentleman came up to me uh
[1:48:41] and asked me if I was um Joe coffee and
[1:48:44] I said I I was and he said he had sent
[1:48:46] me a message on LinkedIn saying that um
[1:48:49] introd ucing himself and he was a writer
[1:48:52] and he was looking I work in marketing
[1:48:54] and he was uh looking for some
[1:48:56] employment and some advice and so he had
[1:48:59] reached out to me on LinkedIn and uh
[1:49:01] asked for uh you know a meeting with me
[1:49:04] and he recognized me in that coffee shop
[1:49:06] he came up to me and and asked me if I
[1:49:08] was a Joe coffee and I said I was and he
[1:49:10] wanted to to speak and I said I'd be
[1:49:13] happy to chat with you I I can't speak
[1:49:15] with you at this very moment cuz I was
[1:49:17] just about to have a meeting but I said
[1:49:19] when I'm done I'll come over over to you
[1:49:20] and I'll uh be happy to chat with you so
[1:49:22] I had my meeting and and just me being
[1:49:25] the way I am I I just uh just honestly
[1:49:28] forgot about the guy and I walked out of
[1:49:30] there and um just it didn't come back to
[1:49:33] my mind to to go over to him and finish
[1:49:35] the
[1:49:36] conversation and so the next day I was
[1:49:39] at my desk working and the Lord just
[1:49:41] brought it back to my remembrance about
[1:49:43] this this gentleman and so I felt I felt
[1:49:47] bad and rather than just you know forget
[1:49:50] about it um I did what I could and I
[1:49:52] went back to my LinkedIn messages and I
[1:49:54] thought maybe I can find this guy and
[1:49:57] and follow up with him that way so I did
[1:50:00] and I was going down to the messages and
[1:50:02] I I I the man was from somewhere like in
[1:50:05] India or Bangladesh or maybe that part
[1:50:07] of the world and so I was looking for
[1:50:09] somebody that that looked like looked
[1:50:11] like that and and so the first person I
[1:50:12] saw in my messages that resembled that I
[1:50:15] said oh that must be him so I I sent I
[1:50:18] sent him a message and I said uh sorry
[1:50:20] about forgetting to walk up to you and
[1:50:24] finish the conversation why don't you uh
[1:50:26] give me a call at this number and and we
[1:50:27] can
[1:50:28] chat so a little bit later my phone
[1:50:31] rings and so I I answered and I
[1:50:34] said are you the guy from the coffee
[1:50:37] shop that I forgot to follow up with and
[1:50:39] he said
[1:50:42] no so I realized I had contacted the
[1:50:46] wrong person on on LinkedIn this wasn't
[1:50:49] the person you know from the coffee shop
[1:50:52] and again I just I felt instead of just
[1:50:55] ending the call I I said well you've
[1:50:58] called me and we're talking and uh you
[1:51:02] obviously were also in my LinkedIn
[1:51:03] messages so why don't you tell me about
[1:51:06] yourself why why were you contacting me
[1:51:08] and so he introduced himself his name
[1:51:10] was Vel Shaw and he gave me a quick
[1:51:14] overview of of what he did for a living
[1:51:16] and and why he had contacted me and I I
[1:51:19] said okay that's you know nice to chat
[1:51:21] with you I I really didn't have any
[1:51:23] further business with him and and we
[1:51:25] hung up and I went further down through
[1:51:27] my messages and I found the the guy from
[1:51:29] the coffee shop and I I settled that and
[1:51:31] dealt with it but what was interesting
[1:51:33] was was that um I guess a few weeks
[1:51:35] later maybe this this this gentleman Vel
[1:51:39] who I never should have talked to it was
[1:51:41] a accidental uh call really he came back
[1:51:44] to my mind and and because he had
[1:51:47] mentioned a certain type of work that he
[1:51:48] did and uh so suddenly I needed that
[1:51:50] kind of a skill set and so I I reached
[1:51:52] out to him and I said I might have a
[1:51:53] project that we could work together on
[1:51:56] and uh he was at the time he was
[1:51:59] underemployed uh he's a very bright
[1:52:01] person who was uh doing a master's of
[1:52:04] business um at our University and he was
[1:52:07] working at a gas station um at night and
[1:52:10] he was he was in a very low Point uh
[1:52:13] making minimum wage and um he had he had
[1:52:17] already uh he had converted from
[1:52:19] Hinduism to Christianity to nominal
[1:52:22] Christianity and he was going to a
[1:52:24] Pentecostal Church in our area and he
[1:52:26] was just feeling drier and drier and
[1:52:28] drier spiritually and he was just just
[1:52:31] going through a really dark time and so
[1:52:34] he he was about to leave uh Newland and
[1:52:37] and and but then we met you know in this
[1:52:40] really accidental way and so when I said
[1:52:44] to him here's a project would you like
[1:52:45] to you know I was testing him um and he
[1:52:48] was just desperate for for gainful
[1:52:50] employment and so he he took the project
[1:52:53] and and he did an excellent job on it
[1:52:56] and I I just saw some real talent in
[1:52:58] this man and I gave him more more
[1:53:01] challenges and things and U then a
[1:53:03] monthly contract and and he he just
[1:53:05] started to really step up and
[1:53:08] contribute so we were we were on a call
[1:53:12] with a potential customer and the the
[1:53:16] customer the prospect said you know if
[1:53:19] you're in our area we should go out for
[1:53:21] a beer and I you know I don't always do
[1:53:25] it but you know I try to take those
[1:53:27] opportunities to drop a little seed amen
[1:53:29] and I said to the prospect I said well I
[1:53:32] I don't drink beer but I I like black
[1:53:35] coffee and you know if if I'm in the
[1:53:38] area we can grab a coffee and so that
[1:53:40] was just a little little witness and and
[1:53:42] when we hung up Vel called me and he
[1:53:44] said uh he said I don't I don't drink
[1:53:46] beer either because I I didn't know
[1:53:48] anything about V really uh at that point
[1:53:51] just that he was good at you know
[1:53:53] certain types of work and uh that just
[1:53:57] that previous night I had got down and I
[1:54:00] had asked the Lord to confirm for me if
[1:54:03] Vel was somebody that he had sent my way
[1:54:06] that he had put me in my path or if it
[1:54:09] was just kind of my own thoughts that
[1:54:11] that this person was special and that
[1:54:14] very next day we had this call with this
[1:54:15] Prospect and when when he called me and
[1:54:19] he said you know I don't drink beer
[1:54:20] either I said to him well I don't the
[1:54:22] reason why I don't drink alcohol is
[1:54:24] because I'm a Christian and he said so
[1:54:26] am I I'm a Christian and right then that
[1:54:29] prayer came back to my mind and I said
[1:54:31] Thank You Lord that's that's the the
[1:54:33] reassurance I needed that if I show is
[1:54:36] somebody special you know because I
[1:54:38] really I was also praying can I trust
[1:54:40] this person and you know should I start
[1:54:42] to try to pull him in closer and closer
[1:54:44] uh in in in our work you know and so
[1:54:48] that that was a a turn turning point for
[1:54:50] he and I and he started to ask me
[1:54:53] questions about where do you go to
[1:54:54] church and so I told him and and we were
[1:54:57] having special meetings that weekend and
[1:54:59] so I invited him to come come to those
[1:55:02] meetings and that Sunday morning he was
[1:55:05] sitting in in the church with me and you
[1:55:08] know with the congregation and I you
[1:55:10] know the the message was being preached
[1:55:12] and I I thought how's how is this going
[1:55:14] you know U just wondering how he was
[1:55:17] receiving it all and and so we were
[1:55:19] after that we had a fellowship and I was
[1:55:21] driving to the my parents home with him
[1:55:23] for this fellowship and I said to him
[1:55:25] what did you think of the service and
[1:55:27] and he he said I've been asking the Lord
[1:55:29] to lead me to a church where the focus
[1:55:32] is the new birth and the Rapture amen
[1:55:35] and I just I was astounded I just said
[1:55:37] well brother you you are in the right
[1:55:38] place like that that like you know
[1:55:41] that's really all all we uh talk about
[1:55:44] it always comes back to those two
[1:55:46] things and so he just kept coming to
[1:55:48] church and and just remember this is a
[1:55:50] wrong number this this this this should
[1:55:52] have never happened you know um just a
[1:55:55] total accident and you know we he he was
[1:55:59] he was very um diligent in his uh
[1:56:03] evaluation of the message he didn't just
[1:56:05] dive in and accept it all and you know
[1:56:07] he wanted to understand it he wanted to
[1:56:09] see it for himself and so he went
[1:56:11] through a year or more of of
[1:56:12] scrutinizing and asking a lot of
[1:56:14] questions and uh doing his own study and
[1:56:17] so forth and the Lord was dealing with
[1:56:18] him and um I guess the end of the story
[1:56:21] or or you know not not the end of it but
[1:56:23] uh the next big milestone was he wanted
[1:56:25] to be baptized in in the name of the
[1:56:27] Lord Jesus Christ and and so I I
[1:56:29] personally baptized
[1:56:33] him and and he just his testimony was so
[1:56:36] beautiful that he gave to the church
[1:56:38] because he just told us what a how he
[1:56:40] was just coming to the end of of himself
[1:56:42] during that time and just through that
[1:56:44] encounter God turned his whole life
[1:56:46] around you know he went from working at
[1:56:48] a gas station to working in his field
[1:56:50] and being challenged and and the the
[1:56:53] church uh that he was looking for the
[1:56:55] fellowship and the warmth of the
[1:56:56] Believers and the word and all these
[1:56:58] things uh he just immediately went from
[1:57:01] day like from night to day and and he he
[1:57:03] all of his uh everything that he'd been
[1:57:05] praying God just in a moment uh gave it
[1:57:08] all to him so he he continues to grow in
[1:57:11] the faith and and he's a trustee now in
[1:57:13] our church and he he's just such a help
[1:57:15] and a blessing and and we can't imagine
[1:57:18] you know not having him so it's just
[1:57:20] it's just the grace of grace of God and
[1:57:22] I just encourage you to you know God has
[1:57:24] placed you in your job or in your
[1:57:27] neighborhood uh or maybe in an
[1:57:29] accidental place at some you know
[1:57:31] accidental time he he'll put you in a
[1:57:33] situation with somebody just to be a
[1:57:36] light and a witness and it could be
[1:57:37] something so simple but God can do
[1:57:39] something so big just just through you
[1:57:41] and and your simple testimony God bless
[1:57:44] you
[1:57:48] amen
[1:57:51] wow I was all
[1:57:56] sad it's all torn up and as I like the
[1:58:01] way he says and uh um my name is Joe
[1:58:05] [Laughter]
[1:58:07] too but you see how brother Joe was a
[1:58:10] wrong
[1:58:11] number it was a
[1:58:13] mistake wow that he made and look at the
[1:58:17] mistake of David
[1:58:20] David made a mistake he did something
[1:58:23] wrong and God took that mistake and
[1:58:27] brought probably the greatest King that
[1:58:31] had ever been the most prosperous King
[1:58:34] in David's son
[1:58:36] Solomon from that Union with basheba and
[1:58:40] Solomon built the first temple of God
[1:58:44] all from a mistake and as always
[1:58:47] listening to our brother's testimony my
[1:58:49] the The Joy just returned to me saying
[1:58:52] no God can take a mistake and turn it
[1:58:55] around and use it for his glory amen
[1:58:59] brother Joe if you could
[1:59:02] [Music]

[2:00:09] while and now there's many Joe's there's
[2:00:12] many Rachels there's many
[2:00:15] Johnson's there's many there's many many
[2:00:19] people here it's it's not about as many
[2:00:22] Daniels it's not about you it's not
[2:00:26] about
[2:00:27] you hallelujah it's not about
[2:00:31] you and uh some of us have really good
[2:00:35] lives and don't understand why the book
[2:00:39] of Samuel is
[2:00:41] about
[2:00:44] David I do I
[2:00:47] do and and uh look back on all these
[2:00:53] mistakes such horrible
[2:00:59] mistakes and Jesus Christ has blessed
[2:01:01] every single one of
[2:01:03] them bringing me a
[2:01:07] son bringing me a family bringing me
[2:01:11] bringing me a
[2:01:13] church bringing everything from every
[2:01:16] mistake I've
[2:01:18] made
[2:01:19] even bringing me up
[2:01:23] here you're not
[2:01:26] Joe you're Jesus
[2:01:28] Christ Even in our family I was Joe in
[2:01:31] the
[2:01:32] family and then another sister married
[2:01:36] and Joey and he has Jose my son's
[2:01:42] Joseph I'm not even Joe and my
[2:01:46] family so you kind of relate to the
[2:01:48] Bible and well you think Joseph of Many
[2:01:52] Colors Joseph the father of Jesus or
[2:01:56] the the many Joseph's
[2:02:00] there it's better to identify in J Jesus
[2:02:04] Christ it's better to identify in that
[2:02:07] name that it's not about you it's about
[2:02:11] his purpose and what's going to be
[2:02:13] happening in his he's he's training Us
[2:02:16] in in in all these chapters of the Bible
[2:02:19] we know the Bible we've read the Bible
[2:02:21] but we're bringing it together and
[2:02:23] reading it together and understanding it
[2:02:25] together and understanding these pieces
[2:02:28] together because we're going somewhere
[2:02:31] and he's using us for something that's
[2:02:34] why he's building this church and that's
[2:02:36] why he's building the strength in the
[2:02:38] people in this church in you not not the
[2:02:42] people around in you Jesus Christ is
[2:02:46] working in you
[2:02:50] and because of that let's worship him
