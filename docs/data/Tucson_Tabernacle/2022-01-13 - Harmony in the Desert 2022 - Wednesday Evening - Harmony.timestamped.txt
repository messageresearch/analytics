[0:09] to me
[0:13] is so
[0:15] wonderful
[0:28] [Music]
[0:33] is
[0:45] one more time tell them oh how i love
[0:47] jesus
[1:02] oh
[1:11] [Applause]
[1:30] brother vic bernal brother vic comes up
[1:33] to open in prayer
[1:35] welcome this evening god bless each one
[1:37] of you good to have you with us tonight
[1:39] so
[1:41] amen
[1:49] [Music]
[1:59] before we go to prayer if it'd be
[2:00] appropriate i'd like to
[2:03] read something psalms 133 was up here
[2:05] earlier
[2:07] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[2:09] for brethren to dwell together
[2:12] in unity
[2:14] how many wants
[2:15] more unity
[2:18] we need it church
[2:19] i'd like to share with you something
[2:21] brother brown said on thirsting for life
[2:24] he said how did this great pillar of
[2:27] fire
[2:28] the angel of god the logos that went out
[2:30] of god
[2:32] that led the children of israel through
[2:34] the wilderness
[2:36] when he come among the people listen
[2:38] when he come among the people it
[2:40] separated itself
[2:43] and great licks of fire began to come
[2:46] upon each one
[2:48] as the pillar of fire began to break up
[2:51] and to god dividing himself
[2:55] among his people
[2:57] oh that ought to tear the heart out of
[3:00] everybody
[3:01] god tearing himself apart
[3:04] that he might divide himself
[3:07] a little bit with each one of us
[3:10] that all together you see what it means
[3:13] can you see now why i'm standing for
[3:16] unity of every church
[3:18] every full gospel church every believer
[3:22] we ought to be in one heart
[3:25] one mind and one accord
[3:27] no matter how much different
[3:30] we no matter how much we different in
[3:33] the scriptures
[3:34] that might be oh might see this that way
[3:38] one might see it this way or that has
[3:41] nothing to do with it but in principle
[3:44] we ought to stand
[3:46] one great
[3:48] mighty army of god marching on
[3:51] because each one of you
[3:55] in your peculiarity
[3:58] god has proved that he's ignoring
[4:00] ignoring your doctrine
[4:03] because he gave you the holy ghost
[4:06] and the bible said he gave them the holy
[4:09] ghost that obeyed him
[4:11] listen to this last
[4:13] verse now if i obeyed him in my peculiar
[4:16] way
[4:18] and you obedient obeyed him in your
[4:20] peculiar way
[4:22] he give us both the holy ghost
[4:24] so we ought to be christian brethren and
[4:28] sisters enough
[4:29] to arm up together
[4:31] and march on for one great purpose
[4:36] the gospel
[4:38] let's bow our hands

[11:00] we have a song special is my daughter
[11:02] sarah so
[11:04] thank you
[11:23] i've stood on the banks of a
[11:26] wide-ranging river
[11:29] trusting that i'd get across
[11:33] i've made my way through some valleys
[11:37] and deserts believing i'd never get lost
[11:43] i've stood out the front of what felt
[11:46] like mount everest knowing i'd have the
[11:49] strength for the climb
[11:53] it's through every trial each test and
[11:57] temptation
[11:58] there's one thing that's sure every time
[12:03] over and over again and again god is
[12:08] faithful
[12:11] over and over
[12:13] again and again through it all
[12:16] he's made me able
[12:20] to stand and survive to come through
[12:24] alive when it sure looked like i
[12:27] couldn't win
[12:29] but jesus is with me so i'll claim the
[12:33] victory
[12:35] over and over again
[12:39] if you ask me why i have no hesitation
[12:44] god does what he says he will do
[12:49] i'd simply say every battle has taught
[12:53] me there's nothing he won't bring me
[12:56] through
[12:59] so why should i dwell on the heartaches
[13:02] and struggles when i look just beyond
[13:05] them i see
[13:08] the way this will end is in great
[13:11] celebration
[13:13] and deep in my heart i believe
[13:18] over and over
[13:20] again and again god is faithful
[13:24] [Music]
[13:25] over and over again and again through it
[13:30] all
[13:31] he's made me a
[13:34] to stand and survive
[13:37] to come through alive when it sure
[13:40] looked like i couldn't win
[13:44] but jesus is with me so i'll claim the
[13:48] victory over and over again
[13:54] over and over again and again our god is
[13:58] faithful
[14:01] over and over
[14:03] again and again through it all
[14:07] he's made us
[14:08] able to stand and survive
[14:12] to come through alive
[14:17] [Music]
[14:19] but jesus is with us so we'll claim the
[14:23] victory over and over again
[14:28] [Music]
[14:36] our god is faithful
[14:38] about nine years ago around this time
[14:42] sarah called mom up said can you take me
[14:43] to the doctor i just don't feel good
[14:46] thought maybe she had a cold or
[14:48] something
[14:49] and they started checking her out
[14:53] around two o'clock in the afternoon they
[14:54] told us she has congestive heart failure
[14:57] her kidneys quit working
[14:58] they didn't give her much hope
[15:01] fed one doctor told her you've got about
[15:02] two weeks to live that was nine years
[15:04] ago
[15:05] our god is faithful amen appreciate it

[26:09] hard to imagine him as a little baby
[26:12] crying for his mama
[26:14] but in order to be touched by the
[26:16] feeling of our infirmities he went
[26:18] through it all
[26:20] so when i say i heard

[26:23] understands
[26:25] what a mighty god we sure amen

[26:30] the message jesus christ the same
[26:32] yesterday today and forever
[26:34] preaching 61 here
[26:37] right in this very building
[26:39] only believe only belief
[26:42] are things still possible
[26:45] without brother branham being here is it
[26:46] is he still possible is because jesus
[26:48] christ is the same yesterday
[26:53] oh maybe
[26:57] [Music]
[27:06] are
[27:07] possible
[27:12] [Music]
[27:25] all things are possible
[27:30] [Music]
[27:34] now tell him you believe
[27:35] [Music]
[27:37] lord i believe
[27:42] lord i
[27:46] believe all things are possible
[27:52] lord
[27:54] [Music]
[27:58] lord i believe
[28:01] [Music]
[28:08] all
[28:09] things are possible
[28:13] lord i will be
[28:19] when jesus spoke to that man there at
[28:20] the altar and he said do you believe he
[28:23] says yes lord i believe but help thou my
[28:26] unbelief
[28:27] sometimes you get to looking at yourself
[28:29] and you wonder
[28:30] look to him
[28:32] he's the same yesterday today emperor
[28:34] you may be seated
[28:36] as they begin the tape tonight like i
[28:38] said it's about two hours long so
[28:40] worship the lord and
[28:42] listen to what god has for us today
[28:59] i was so thrilled when i heard that song
[29:02] down from his glory
[29:04] ever who that brother was that's saying
[29:05] that i heard he was dedicated to me i
[29:07] sure appreciate that that's my favorite
[29:10] hymn
[29:11] wrote by a personal friend of mine
[29:13] uh brother william booth cliven
[29:17] it expresses in there the deity of our
[29:20] lord jesus christ
[29:23] today when they try to make him just
[29:24] another man or or a prophet or something
[29:27] i think that expresses what he was he
[29:30] came down from glory
[29:32] god was manifested in the flesh in
[29:35] christ jesus his son
[29:37] he expressed in his flesh what god was
[29:41] and god can express to us what he is if
[29:45] we'll just let him through the
[29:47] righteousness of christ
[29:50] then our unrighteousness is not counted
[29:52] to us
[29:53] it is reckon our faith is reckoned that
[29:56] it will be counted to us as faith and
[29:59] righteousness in his sight
[30:01] which we have none of our own that we
[30:03] could offer
[30:05] i just trust that it will be a great
[30:09] time again that i can come back to to
[30:12] this city
[30:13] this morning i
[30:15] was speaking in such a lovely
[30:17] little audience here of such a
[30:19] responding audience
[30:21] i feel if we could stay with you a
[30:23] little while so we get to know each
[30:25] other
[30:27] my ministry is a little odd
[30:30] and
[30:31] therefore
[30:32] not being able to express it all at
[30:37] one little service then it makes you
[30:39] wonder about this or that
[30:41] but when we are
[30:43] for a quite a while visiting
[30:46] you can see night after night and watch
[30:49] what's spoken see if it happens and that
[30:51] then you begin to realize and
[30:54] what it
[30:55] the ministry is and that
[30:57] it makes us
[30:58] uh understand one another much better
[31:01] i certainly appreciate the invitation
[31:04] that a pastor here gave me to come here
[31:07] to the church for all you people
[31:10] and for
[31:11] all the churches throughout
[31:13] the city
[31:14] i hope someday it could be the will of
[31:16] god
[31:17] that i could come back and stay a more
[31:20] extended service in the city where we
[31:22] could get
[31:23] all the
[31:24] peoples together the churches the
[31:26] ministers
[31:28] and tonight it's pretty rough on the
[31:30] ministers maybe man there's sick people
[31:33] had to get permission to come down to be
[31:35] prayed for
[31:36] and i wish i could express my feelings
[31:39] to the pastors that turn their
[31:41] congregation
[31:43] out tonight that they could come to hear
[31:45] the service and to be prayed for
[31:48] may the lord ever bless man like that
[31:51] man of
[31:52] of great
[31:53] of great integrity someone who's got a
[31:56] real heart for sick and needy people i'm
[32:00] sure that they will
[32:02] prosper in doing things like that
[32:04] now
[32:06] i think there's several churches here i
[32:08] just had a letter open a few moments ago
[32:10] from the pastor of the first assembly of
[32:13] god here in the city
[32:15] and he had someone real sick here in the
[32:18] hospital and
[32:20] and if i
[32:21] don't know he's in church at this time i
[32:23] suppose
[32:24] and i
[32:25] certainly will be in prayer for that
[32:28] person if
[32:29] any of their people are here
[32:32] christ is the same yesterday today and
[32:34] forever he never can fail
[32:38] and i
[32:39] trust that
[32:41] he'll bless each of us tonight and we'll
[32:43] leave here with the glory of god in our
[32:45] hearts
[32:46] now i would like to say this because of
[32:49] just passing through
[32:51] and praying for the sick and saying a
[32:53] healing service
[32:54] now we that's not all my ministry we
[32:58] believe the first thing is salvation
[33:01] because if you get healed you'll live
[33:04] any time you'll probably be sick again
[33:06] but when you receive christ you've got
[33:08] eternal life and how much more
[33:12] uh is eternal life and just the healing
[33:15] of the body
[33:16] but
[33:17] divine healing christ used it and divine
[33:20] healing to attract the attention of the
[33:23] people
[33:24] and about 86 percent of his ministry was
[33:27] in divine healing
[33:29] therefore
[33:30] it's something that shows the
[33:32] supernatural
[33:34] now
[33:34] all that could ever be done for a person
[33:37] for you i or anyone was completed and
[33:41] finished at calvary
[33:44] now when i
[33:46] many i've heard many say if they had
[33:48] healing in their hands and that that may
[33:50] be all true i don't know
[33:53] but the way i believe it is that
[33:56] our healing is completed
[33:58] with our salvation he was wounded for
[34:01] our transgressions and with his stripes
[34:03] we were healed it's a past tense
[34:06] now the only way that we can receive
[34:09] anything from god
[34:10] is i catch this
[34:13] is not to look for something
[34:15] uh say my hands crippled i was prayed
[34:18] for my hands doesn't straighten out a
[34:20] moment that doesn't mean i'm not healed
[34:22] no that doesn't do i have one thing to
[34:24] do with it see
[34:26] because i've noticed in 31 years
[34:30] in the ministry
[34:31] 15 years or
[34:33] round around the world
[34:35] that sometimes you pray for a person
[34:37] it'd be a week or two before it ever
[34:39] happens
[34:41] and i was thinking of a case just now
[34:43] i've often referred to it a lady came
[34:45] into the meeting
[34:47] and it was in the prayer line and the
[34:49] holy spirit began to tell her about who
[34:51] she was and what was wrong she had a
[34:54] tremendous ulcer in her stomach
[34:57] and
[34:57] and then it told her that that's what
[35:00] the holy spirit's saying she knows
[35:01] there'd be something to reveal that
[35:04] she recognized it and she wanted to act
[35:07] upon it
[35:08] and then down the line a little farther
[35:10] was her neighbor and her neighbor had a
[35:12] growth
[35:13] on her neck
[35:14] and she was prayed for and the holy
[35:16] spirit had pronounced her heel
[35:18] well when she went home she said well
[35:20] perhaps i'll just go ahead and eat now
[35:22] i'm all right
[35:24] so she started to eat and made a real
[35:26] sick
[35:26] and three or four weeks passed and still
[35:29] she would try to have faith to move on
[35:31] and her husband told her said
[35:34] honey i don't mind you
[35:37] having faith like that but said you're
[35:39] just bringing reproach upon the very
[35:41] cause of christ
[35:42] how little that husband know
[35:45] she can't do that as long as she's
[35:46] confessing his word
[35:48] or he is the high priest
[35:50] of our confession he cannot do one thing
[35:53] for us the first we confess
[35:56] you people have been saved
[35:58] you know this you can come there at the
[36:00] altar and cry
[36:02] and lay on the altar and confess
[36:04] and all you want to and cry and pray and
[36:07] beat on the altar for year after year
[36:09] and you'll never be saved until you
[36:12] accept his pardon
[36:16] see if something you accept
[36:20] it's yours it belongs to you healing is
[36:22] yours you've got to accept it
[36:24] and until you accept it the book of
[36:27] hebrews says he's the high priest of our
[36:30] confession or profession both translate
[36:32] the thing
[36:34] when we confess it he's the high priest
[36:36] to make intercessions on what we confess
[36:39] and we confess his finished work
[36:42] at calvary
[36:43] this woman was doing that
[36:45] one morning she was washing her dishes
[36:48] and
[36:49] all at once said she was thinking about
[36:51] the meeting and her husband told her a
[36:52] night before it said honey i believe you
[36:54] better stay strictly to your diet and so
[36:57] forth and stop saying about being healed
[36:59] said he may heal you sometimes she said
[37:01] hubby
[37:03] if that man could tell me
[37:06] what the things of my life that i have
[37:08] done and he was correct
[37:09] and he told me thus saith the lord i'm
[37:12] healed i'll believe it until i die
[37:15] that's the way
[37:17] that if he forced all what i was had
[37:20] done surely he can tell me what i would
[37:21] do
[37:22] and her husband went to work and she was
[37:25] washing she said the dishes and she felt
[37:27] a real cool feeling strike in her
[37:30] she wondered what's that
[37:32] she got real hungry now after getting
[37:34] hungry she thought i just got to eat a
[37:36] piece of toast
[37:38] she'd taken a little toast and eat it
[37:40] and we usually started vomiting the
[37:42] duodenal officer and
[37:44] vomit but it
[37:46] it didn't vomit then some of the
[37:48] children had left in her place behind
[37:49] mother of bee
[37:51] from their children some oatmeal and
[37:53] that just burned her up when she eat
[37:54] that oatmeal and then the starches and
[37:57] so when she taken a few spoonfuls of
[37:59] that didn't bother her
[38:01] so then she eat the rest of the dish of
[38:03] the oatmeal didn't bother
[38:05] but she fried her up some bacon and eggs
[38:07] and had a gastronomical jubilee and
[38:09] drank her a big cup of coffee
[38:11] and she just had a great time and that's
[38:13] why she waited a couple hours and
[38:14] everything is all right she just feeling
[38:16] so fine she's running around screaming
[38:18] she ran down the street to tell her
[38:20] neighbor
[38:21] and when she got down there it's around
[38:23] 9 30 at 10 o'clock
[38:24] her neighbor was standing the floor
[38:26] screaming and she thought somebody died
[38:28] in there
[38:29] so she ran in and they both threw their
[38:30] arms around one another and her neighbor
[38:32] had a sheet in her hand
[38:34] so what's the other sheet said i'm
[38:35] trying to find that thing it left my
[38:37] throat just a while ago before i got up
[38:39] he said that place went off on my throat
[38:42] and they drove i guess about 300 miles
[38:45] to catch up at the meeting or more to to
[38:47] tell the experience that's one of
[38:49] thousands what was it
[38:52] the very angel of the lord that knows
[38:55] what has been and predicts what will be
[38:57] he can't always come to your rescue in a
[38:59] second
[39:00] the clergy knows that daniel prayed in
[39:02] 21 days before the angel could get to
[39:04] him
[39:05] but it passed through the neighborhood
[39:07] confirming the word
[39:09] and they were well
[39:11] that's the way it is we must remember
[39:13] that healing is a finished work at
[39:16] calvary
[39:17] and the only thing that anyone can do
[39:19] now a minister that's taught in the word
[39:22] he can stand up and preach the word to
[39:24] you
[39:25] now if he preaches the word faith cometh
[39:28] by
[39:29] hearing hearing the
[39:31] word of god
[39:33] that's the original
[39:34] but then god is the good god is our
[39:37] good friend brother oral roberts
[39:39] expresses he is a good god and then yet
[39:42] if we don't take his word part
[39:45] then
[39:46] besides that
[39:47] if we don't take his word he's got
[39:50] another way
[39:51] he'll send he's got gifts in the church
[39:54] there's nine spiritual gifts set into
[39:56] the local each local body should be in
[39:58] full operation in everybody every church
[40:02] and in that is a gifts of tongues and
[40:05] interpretation of tongues and now that
[40:07] just isn't repeating us
[40:09] something or making a vain repetition
[40:11] is saying something directly to be
[40:13] interpreted for a certain person in that
[40:15] congregation or something that make way
[40:18] tongues by interpretation is prophecy
[40:22] and it's prophetic utterance given to
[40:24] the people to to tell them what to do or
[40:26] something to correct them or if the
[40:29] great church of the living god would
[40:30] always be set in order
[40:33] i find it
[40:35] then besides that he's got five
[40:37] ministerial offices first is apostles or
[40:40] missionaries the word apostle means one
[40:43] cent a missionary means one saint
[40:47] secondarily prophets evangelists pastors
[40:50] and so forth those are god-given gifts
[40:52] that set into the church they're
[40:54] predestinated of god and set to the
[40:56] church you can't make yourself a
[40:58] minister you god's got to call you to be
[41:00] a minister
[41:01] prophets are for ordained their prophets
[41:03] now he's a gift of prophecy in the
[41:06] church that could be on one then the
[41:07] next one the next one the next one so
[41:09] forth a prophecy paul said you may all
[41:11] prophesy one by one
[41:13] but there's a lot of difference between
[41:15] a prophet and a prophecy
[41:17] prophecy has to be judged by three
[41:19] witnesses two or three before it can be
[41:21] given are accepted in the church
[41:23] according to the scriptures but a
[41:25] prophet like the old testament prophet
[41:27] they had the word of the law
[41:29] the translation was right to them and
[41:31] they were known because the bible said
[41:33] if there be one among you spiritually or
[41:35] a prophet i the lord will make myself
[41:37] known to him speak to him in visions and
[41:39] reveal myself in dreams and if what this
[41:42] man says comes to pass then hear him
[41:44] before i'm with him if it doesn't then
[41:45] don't hear him i'm not with him don't
[41:48] fear him
[41:49] now you see therefore that divine
[41:52] healing is something that christ did for
[41:55] us
[41:56] now we must have faith
[41:58] now i find two classes of people in my
[42:01] travel
[42:02] one of them is fundamental
[42:04] the other one is pentecostal
[42:07] now the fundamental positionally knows
[42:09] what they are
[42:11] but they don't go deep enough
[42:13] they know positionally if they are sons
[42:15] of god
[42:16] but they don't go deep enough
[42:19] like uh thought about our precious
[42:21] brother billy graham
[42:22] when he was in our city i met him
[42:24] several times without his ministerial
[42:26] breakfast he said
[42:28] paul went into a city and
[42:30] preached the gospel and one man was
[42:32] converted he went back a year later said
[42:35] he had 30 converts to met one but i'll
[42:37] go into steady and stay six weeks and
[42:39] have 20 000. come back in another six
[42:42] months and i can't find 20.
[42:44] he said what's the matter you lazy
[42:46] preacher she said set with your feet up
[42:48] on the desk instead of going out and
[42:49] visiting
[42:50] now the evangelist had something here
[42:52] but he didn't have all of it
[42:54] who was the one taking that one for paul
[42:57] paul took him deep enough in christ
[42:59] until he was filled with the holy ghost
[43:00] and it's burning so he'd set the whole
[43:02] town of power but when you just ask them
[43:04] to stand except christ the savior set
[43:06] back down they haven't went deep enough
[43:08] to know what to do
[43:09] you must take them on into the baptism
[43:11] of the spirit
[43:12] therefore i find fundamental people they
[43:15] positionally know what
[43:17] they are but they have no faith then i
[43:20] find the pentecostal people that has a
[43:22] lot of faith but don't know who they are
[43:26] it's just like a man one man's got money
[43:29] in the bank but can't write a check the
[43:30] other can write a check and has no money
[43:32] to bank
[43:33] if you could ever get those together the
[43:35] gospel will pay off great
[43:37] that's right
[43:38] get some fundamental teachings in a
[43:40] pentecostal church or pentecostal faith
[43:42] and fundamental meetings then you've got
[43:45] to know positionally first christ where
[43:47] you stand
[43:48] you are heir to this it's your personal
[43:51] property
[43:53] it belongs to you it's god's gift to you
[43:56] nobody can take it away from you it's
[43:58] yours
[43:59] what you ask the father in my name that
[44:01] i'll do who can deny anything there
[44:04] verily verily i say unto you if you stay
[44:06] this mountain be moved don't doubt your
[44:08] heart but believe that what you've said
[44:10] shall come to pass you can have whatever
[44:12] you said
[44:13] what promises not limited just the
[44:16] healing but the whatsoever
[44:18] now you've got to find your objective
[44:21] and your emotive and then the will of
[44:23] god if it is the will of god and your
[44:25] motives right and your objective is
[44:27] right then the mountain will fall but
[44:30] outside of that you could scream till
[44:31] you got hoarse and died and there would
[44:33] move i think your first thing it's got
[44:36] to be the will of god
[44:37] the next thing it's your objective and
[44:39] going into it and then the motive you
[44:41] have you want to be some big person
[44:43] is one thing that
[44:45] jesus christ lacked when he was on earth
[44:47] that was
[44:48] showmanship he wasn't a showman
[44:52] you couldn't let's say him to be a
[44:53] stuffed shirt he kept away humble he
[44:56] kept his meeting so he could go wherever
[44:58] the father led him to go
[45:00] and one of his brothers said if you can
[45:02] do these things why don't you come up to
[45:04] campus to get amongst the big classics
[45:06] and the rabbis and do it so everybody
[45:08] can see you what you doing hanging out
[45:10] with a bunch of holy rollers or no i
[45:12] mean that like that i mean fishermen and
[45:14] so important
[45:20] i was just thinking about what
[45:22] one of the brothers of the church that i
[45:23] just come from
[45:25] well
[45:26] that's it you see but christ wasn't a
[45:28] showmanship
[45:30] he said your times always
[45:33] that is right he came to his own and his
[45:36] own received him not that's the most
[45:38] pathetic thing i know of in the
[45:39] scriptures he came to his own and his
[45:41] own receiving not
[45:44] now as we approach the word tonight i
[45:46] want you to bear that in mind
[45:48] that
[45:49] we a person that
[45:51] remember that god doesn't have stuffed
[45:53] out shirts
[45:55] when you get to a place that you're
[45:56] willing to be nothing then god can make
[45:58] something out of you
[46:00] but as long as you're trying to be big
[46:02] and a lot of flowerly advertising and
[46:04] all this stuff and going on
[46:06] my opinion
[46:08] something's happened
[46:09] see
[46:10] jesus went along doing good going to the
[46:13] poor and needy he never made himself any
[46:16] a reputation
[46:18] did you ever think of that he made of
[46:20] himself no reputation the man that made
[46:22] an artificial tooth made a reputation
[46:24] for himself but the one that made the
[46:26] real tooth made of himself no repetition
[46:29] the man that made an artificial arm made
[46:31] a reputation for himself but the man who
[46:33] made the real arm made of himself no
[46:35] reputation
[46:36] the way up is down
[46:39] always remember that be humble be sweet
[46:42] and kind be creative let christ being
[46:45] you do you ever see people you love to
[46:47] be around
[46:48] just love to be around them because they
[46:50] create an atmosphere heavenly and you
[46:52] like to be around others seem to be good
[46:54] people but yeah
[46:57] i have to get away once in a while that
[47:00] you know what i mean
[47:01] and yet they seem to be good people it's
[47:03] not creative
[47:05] and
[47:06] man was made to be a god we know that
[47:09] genesis 1 26 he had domain over the
[47:12] whole earth
[47:13] and he was made to be an amateur god
[47:16] and now when he receives god he becomes
[47:18] the son of god again he is made in the
[47:20] image of god
[47:22] god had hands god had feet
[47:24] and so therefore a man was made like him
[47:27] so he is an amateur god but
[47:30] sin has blinded every fiber in his body
[47:34] in his mind
[47:35] in his heart but now don't never try to
[47:38] study it out you cannot figure it out in
[47:40] the garden of eden
[47:42] satan chose his part of the man his head
[47:45] his intellectuals
[47:46] god took his heart
[47:48] the intellectuals will reason why well
[47:50] i'm i'm this way and i'm that way
[47:52] you'll never get anywhere with god there
[47:54] but your heart your faith will make you
[47:56] believe things that your mind knows
[47:57] nothing about
[47:58] it casts down reasons
[48:00] you must be positive
[48:02] and you stay there until you are
[48:04] positive man when you're positive
[48:06] nothing can turn you
[48:08] now
[48:09] let us bow our heads just a moment
[48:11] before we approach the the author of
[48:13] this word as we read it
[48:16] i wonder tonight with our heads bowed
[48:18] and our eyes closed is there any here
[48:21] that would like to be remembered in
[48:22] prayer and let it be known by your
[48:24] uplifted hand you'd say lord i need thee
[48:26] i need thee for my health i need you for
[48:29] my soul
[48:30] god bless you god bless you that's good
[48:34] father lead me
[48:35] i need thy guiding spirit
[48:39] our heavenly father
[48:41] as we come approaching again
[48:44] in the name of the lord jesus
[48:46] you said that we would ask abundantly
[48:49] that our joys would be full
[48:51] now we're coming to ask
[48:53] of our mercy first for our own sins
[48:57] the things that we have thought and did
[49:00] that was contrary to your leading
[49:03] we pray that you forgive us
[49:05] as we stand here in this holy sanctuary
[49:10] for the holy spirit present
[49:13] know how i have often wondered
[49:17] how i would feel if i could hold in a
[49:19] glass just two drops of his literal
[49:22] blood
[49:23] how i would draw it up to my bosom and
[49:26] weep
[49:27] because i know it was that blood that
[49:29] saved me
[49:31] but tonight thou has given me a greater
[49:34] than that the very purchase of his blood
[49:37] to speak to
[49:39] boy he loved the world so much that he
[49:41] gave his only begotten son

[52:27] in saint john 12 20.
[52:32] and there were certain greeks among them
[52:34] that came up to the feast to worship
[52:36] the same came to philip which was a
[52:38] bethesda of galilee
[52:40] and desired him saying sir
[52:43] we would see jesus
[52:47] and my text is found in hebrews 13 8
[52:50] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[52:52] and forever
[52:55] now
[52:57] just not to hold you but to get your
[53:00] attention for a few moments
[53:02] to build a faith around or each one of
[53:05] you to be healed
[53:08] as i look in the church tonight see a
[53:10] man here
[53:11] coughing
[53:13] a darling linger some mothers precious
[53:16] babies a big water head dying
[53:19] dear old woman sitting in a wheelchair
[53:21] and so forth
[53:23] oh if there was some way something that
[53:25] i could do
[53:28] and maybe these in a wheelchair and so
[53:29] forth would live an ordinary life and
[53:31] maybe a good healthy looking man or
[53:33] woman sitting out or a young person will
[53:35] be dead by tomorrow in a heart attack i
[53:38] mean
[53:39] these may outlive him a long time we
[53:42] don't know see the white canes the
[53:44] people walking blind
[53:46] or if there's just something i can do to
[53:48] help you
[53:49] if i didn't think i could help you i
[53:51] would never come by here if i didn't
[53:53] think i could help the people it isn't
[53:55] for money that i don't take
[53:57] and uh
[53:59] i'm 51 years old i've been preaching for
[54:02] 31 years and never took offering all my
[54:04] life so i i do not we keep money out of
[54:08] it we keep our meetings small so we
[54:09] don't have to have big programs and
[54:11] things to operate so we can go to the
[54:13] smallest of church or wherever the lord
[54:15] leads that's where we go now i'm not
[54:18] condemning the brethren who has those
[54:20] big programs and television tests and so
[54:22] forth that's fine i thank god that
[54:25] there's man in the world that he can
[54:26] trust with money like that that can that
[54:29] but for me i i just couldn't do it i'd
[54:30] have to take up money and i i've never
[54:33] done it yet and i pray god will help me
[54:35] i never have to
[54:36] so i'm here to help you
[54:39] and if i didn't think i could help you i
[54:40] sure wouldn't be here i'd be home
[54:42] tonight with my wife little boy and two
[54:44] little girls
[54:46] i'd be sitting up there for the fire
[54:47] somewhere tonight in the east
[54:50] enjoying with them but i'm almost a
[54:51] stranger to them i just see them now and
[54:53] then
[54:55] traveling the world around
[54:57] but
[54:58] there was a question asked here in the
[55:00] scripture
[55:02] and uh this morning
[55:04] i
[55:05] left off speaking on the word of
[55:08] expectation
[55:11] to expect
[55:13] now i trust that you talk at home with
[55:15] you and search through the scriptures to
[55:18] find out
[55:19] what to expect
[55:21] god's
[55:23] word
[55:24] tells us what we can expect and if we
[55:26] receive this word without any doubt
[55:29] mixed into it we will receive what we
[55:32] come for
[55:33] but if you go away say well
[55:36] uh just as i expected i
[55:39] well you won't see a thing
[55:41] but if you come expecting to see the
[55:43] lord jesus manifest itself amongst the
[55:46] people you'll go away satisfied
[55:48] you certainly will you'll know that
[55:50] something happened
[55:52] but if you say well i
[55:54] just as i expected just another oh an
[55:57] evangelist stand up speaking and and uh
[56:00] that that's what's all you'll get you
[56:02] usually get what you're looking for
[56:04] so open up your heart tonight and take
[56:07] down the umbrella and just no just
[56:09] receive it god in your heart and go away
[56:13] go back to your churches wherever you're
[56:14] from and tell your pastor that truly the
[56:17] lord jesus is the great healer and he's
[56:20] the one who saves and fills the believer
[56:22] with his spirit and makes him a new
[56:24] creatures in christ the pastor said how
[56:26] you know that's uh i'm experienced
[56:29] i know
[56:31] a brother
[56:32] not long ago that disagrees upon christ
[56:35] being the healer he makes me some
[56:37] historical god he said
[56:40] oh i don't believe anything would happen
[56:42] said i still don't believe in divine
[56:44] healing i said certainly not it wasn't
[56:46] for you it wasn't for unbelievers it was
[56:49] for those who believe
[56:51] it's just meant for belief
[56:53] that's he didn't he didn't purchase our
[56:56] healing for unbelievers he purchased for
[56:58] them that believe the promise is not the
[57:00] unbelievers but to them that believe
[57:03] so
[57:04] these greeks come up to the feast now
[57:07] the greeks was learned people
[57:09] and they came up to this feast of
[57:11] pentecost to to worship
[57:14] and while they were at the temple they
[57:16] had heard about the lord jesus
[57:20] and somehow another
[57:22] i don't believe that there is anybody
[57:25] who can ever hear that lovely name
[57:27] called
[57:28] whatever
[57:30] but what would desire to see
[57:33] our new year of jesus there's something
[57:35] about that name
[57:37] of the lord jesus that it inspires and
[57:41] you can never feel the same
[57:44] it's a name above all name
[57:47] he came down from heaven
[57:49] and the world gave him the lowest name
[57:52] there was on the earth
[57:54] beelzebub a fortune teller
[57:57] a devil
[57:59] and he went to the lowest city there is
[58:01] in the earth jericho
[58:03] and was sold to the smallest man the
[58:06] city had to look down on him to see
[58:08] exactly
[58:10] but when he
[58:11] paid the price of redemption god gave
[58:14] him a name above every name
[58:16] even all the family in heaven and earth
[58:18] is named jesus
[58:20] and exalted his throne so high till he
[58:22] has to look down to see heaven that's
[58:24] the difference so way the world treated
[58:26] him the way the father treated him when
[58:28] he come up
[58:30] now
[58:31] so these greeks were a cureth
[58:34] and then heard about him heard of his
[58:35] great work so to perhaps curiosity or
[58:39] maybe for sincere benefits they came and
[58:42] said sirs
[58:44] we would see jesus
[58:47] and i believe if i could interpret the
[58:50] mind of this church tonight these people
[58:52] that's the desire of our heart how many
[58:54] here would like to see jesus
[58:57] sure
[58:58] well i'm going to ask you a question
[59:02] did they did they get to see him yes sir
[59:05] philip tuck them to see him
[59:08] tell them to other brothers and they
[59:09] take them to see
[59:10] jesus so if they inquired and desired to
[59:14] see jesus
[59:16] they were given the privilege of seeing
[59:18] him by one of his servants
[59:21] now
[59:22] if hebrews 13 8 is correctly inspired
[59:26] scripture
[59:27] that said jesus christ is the same
[59:30] yesterday today and forever then if
[59:32] that's our desire then why can't we seed
[59:38] now
[59:39] remember this word is either the truth
[59:42] art isn't the truth
[59:44] there's no contradiction in it
[59:47] i've offered anyone
[59:49] oh i get a hundred dollars a week and i
[59:52] i'll offer anyone your salary you can
[59:55] show me a contradiction the word don't
[59:56] straighten itself out with it's not
[59:58] there
[59:59] it's hidden from the eyes the wise and
[1:00:01] fruity and revealed to babe such as
[1:00:04] we'll learn jesus thanked the father for
[1:00:06] doing that
[1:00:08] the word's not mixed up it's the people
[1:00:10] mixed up
[1:00:11] it's not the word
[1:00:13] so the holy spirit wrote the word it
[1:00:15] takes the holy spirit to interpret the
[1:00:17] word
[1:00:18] it'll all work just exactly right now if
[1:00:21] jesus christ is the same yesterday and
[1:00:23] forever and god forgive me for saying if
[1:00:26] because it sounds sacrilegious he is the
[1:00:28] same yesterday day and forever
[1:00:30] all right then if you desire to see him
[1:00:34] then why can't you see him
[1:00:37] we are his servants
[1:00:39] so why can't you see him would you love
[1:00:40] to do it
[1:00:42] love to see him all right
[1:00:44] i believe that he made this promise
[1:00:47] that whatever two or three are gathered
[1:00:49] in my name there i'll be in their midst
[1:00:54] now is that true now if that isn't true
[1:00:56] then the bible isn't true and your
[1:00:58] salvation isn't true and we're lost and
[1:01:00] miserable of all people we're the
[1:01:02] miserables because we got a a bogus
[1:01:05] thing we're thinking of a christ that's
[1:01:07] a coming and a heaven to go to and there
[1:01:09] is no such well if this word's wrong
[1:01:12] then that word is him
[1:01:14] and then all's wrong
[1:01:16] but if it's right then every one of it's
[1:01:19] right it isn't some for one time sum for
[1:01:22] another it's all the time the same
[1:01:24] where he can find believers
[1:01:26] now
[1:01:28] if jesus will come into this audience
[1:01:30] tonight miserable
[1:01:33] now he could not come in a corporal body
[1:01:35] because that's that's on the throne of
[1:01:37] god
[1:01:39] but he can come in here by the holy
[1:01:41] spirit and show you himself being here
[1:01:44] working in his church you believe that
[1:01:48] he has to be there everything in the
[1:01:50] same principle
[1:01:51] you have to have the same love the same
[1:01:53] compassion same word same manifestation
[1:01:56] if he is the same yesterday today and
[1:01:59] forever
[1:02:00] now remember jesus when the works was
[1:02:03] being done jesus did not heal anyone
[1:02:07] he said i cannot heal no one
[1:02:11] he said it's not me that doeth the works
[1:02:13] it's my father
[1:02:15] and he dwelleth in me
[1:02:18] that right he dwelleth in me
[1:02:23] and a little while when he went away he
[1:02:25] said and the world will see me no more
[1:02:28] yet ye shall see me for ah
[1:02:31] i is a personal pronoun i will be with
[1:02:36] you
[1:02:37] even in you
[1:02:38] to the end of the consummation to the
[1:02:41] world comes to the end
[1:02:43] ah
[1:02:45] and the works that i do
[1:02:47] shall you do also
[1:02:49] if you abide me in my works than you ask
[1:02:52] what you will and it shall be given
[1:02:55] all those great promises
[1:02:58] how they trill my soul
[1:03:00] in the day when atomic missiles
[1:03:04] russians got sputniks in the air and
[1:03:07] all these
[1:03:08] well there's no rest nowhere only in
[1:03:11] christ
[1:03:13] there's not one thing our nation we
[1:03:16] cannot build our hopes upon because any
[1:03:18] little nation can throw a bomb over here
[1:03:20] and blow us off the earth
[1:03:23] warfare is about over you just need one
[1:03:26] man to pull a lever
[1:03:27] at all
[1:03:29] go to pieces
[1:03:30] and we see you can't build your hopes on
[1:03:33] nothing else
[1:03:34] but one thing
[1:03:36] not
[1:03:37] quote eddie pruitt here when he said all
[1:03:40] hail the power of jesus name let angels
[1:03:43] prostrate fall bring forth the royal
[1:03:46] diadem a crime lord of all
[1:03:48] for on christ the solid rock i stand all
[1:03:51] other grounds of sinking sands
[1:03:54] all other grounds of sinking sand
[1:03:57] our only hope
[1:04:00] they're trying to build a hole down the
[1:04:01] ground crawl into it they got a bomb
[1:04:04] that'll blow up
[1:04:06] a hole in the ground 500 foot deep
[1:04:10] and for almost 100 miles square well if
[1:04:13] you were 10 000 feet below the earth it
[1:04:15] break every bone in your body the
[1:04:17] concussion of it
[1:04:19] but there is a shelter
[1:04:22] oh it's not made out of steel but it's
[1:04:24] made out of feathers
[1:04:26] under his wings
[1:04:28] i like that shelter
[1:04:30] sweetly peacefully abide
[1:04:34] knowing this that as soon as before that
[1:04:37] bomb even gets a whistle to start on his
[1:04:40] wings he'll bear us up
[1:04:43] oh that's what i'm looking for that
[1:04:45] great rapture and approach of our lord
[1:04:47] jesus
[1:04:48] and to see it coming so close our hearts
[1:04:51] just jump for joy
[1:04:53] to know that it's a joy
[1:04:57] someone said brother branham said you
[1:04:59] scare the people by telling them the
[1:05:02] lord jesus is coming the end of the
[1:05:03] world i told my not christians oh
[1:05:08] paul said i have fought a good fight
[1:05:10] i've finished the course i've kept the
[1:05:12] faith
[1:05:13] and henceforth there is there for me a
[1:05:15] crown of righteousness that the lord the
[1:05:17] righteous judge will give me at that day
[1:05:19] and not only to me but all those who
[1:05:23] love his appearing
[1:05:26] what greater thing could happen and
[1:05:28] jesus come right now
[1:05:30] apparently our trials will be over
[1:05:33] we just keep holding on until he gets
[1:05:35] here
[1:05:36] working conserving the time and making
[1:05:39] every minute count for him
[1:05:42] wherever we are
[1:05:43] speak a little word for him
[1:05:45] now if he's been so real to us
[1:05:48] and we have ceni's mercy and seen what
[1:05:52] he wants
[1:05:53] now
[1:05:54] and we are under expectations tonight of
[1:05:56] seeing him
[1:05:57] then why can't we see him
[1:06:00] i'll tell you
[1:06:02] he's everywhere if you just look around
[1:06:04] the trouble of it is that people don't
[1:06:06] look around enough to find him
[1:06:09] we live on the ohio river
[1:06:11] and oh it's a great place for fishing
[1:06:14] there's a little boy in our city that
[1:06:16] used to play down the river with an old
[1:06:18] fisherman
[1:06:20] and he uh
[1:06:21] asked his mother one day they belonged
[1:06:23] to a great church in the city
[1:06:25] he said mommy god is such a great person
[1:06:28] could anybody see him she said i can't
[1:06:30] answer you that son
[1:06:32] said you asked your sunday school
[1:06:33] teacher
[1:06:34] and he asked the sunday school teacher
[1:06:36] and she said i don't know you asked the
[1:06:38] pastor
[1:06:39] so he asked the pastor and the pastor
[1:06:41] said no sonny no man can see god and
[1:06:44] live said you just can't see
[1:06:46] it didn't satisfy the little land he
[1:06:48] went down on the river and this old
[1:06:50] fisherman it was a deacon in my church
[1:06:53] so he he was up the river one day at the
[1:06:55] six mile island fishing
[1:06:57] and on the road down coming back down
[1:07:00] the river they come up a storm and they
[1:07:02] had to bank their little craft for a few
[1:07:04] moments the storm blowed over
[1:07:06] in indiana and around the eastern
[1:07:08] countries where the hardwoods that rain
[1:07:11] falls and washes off all the leaves and
[1:07:14] that little breeze blows just when an
[1:07:16] oramon can only tell the tip of the oars
[1:07:18] and tips those waves the music it makes
[1:07:20] on the water
[1:07:21] oh no wonder the spirit of god moved on
[1:07:23] the water first
[1:07:25] to see how that at going down this old
[1:07:28] fisherman
[1:07:29] great old spirit-filled brother pulling
[1:07:32] these oars like this and lifted his oars
[1:07:34] tip on the water
[1:07:36] is looking back heading he was going
[1:07:38] west and looking east and there's a
[1:07:40] rainbow came out
[1:07:42] the old man his companion had been gone
[1:07:44] years
[1:07:45] he's watching that rainbow and over his
[1:07:47] silver beard there come little trickles
[1:07:49] of tears running off his beard the
[1:07:52] little boy was sitting in the stern of
[1:07:53] the boat got so enthused he ran up to
[1:07:55] the center of the boat
[1:07:57] and he said fell down at his lip
[1:07:59] limbs and said
[1:08:01] sir
[1:08:02] i'm going to ask you a question to my
[1:08:04] mother's sunday school teacher neither
[1:08:05] pastor can satisfy me
[1:08:08] he said can
[1:08:10] anyone see god
[1:08:12] and it overcome the old fisherman he
[1:08:14] pulled the oars in the boat
[1:08:16] braced the little lad in his arms and he
[1:08:18] stroked his little hair and said god
[1:08:20] bless your little heart sonny all i've
[1:08:23] seen for the past 50 years has been god
[1:08:26] so much on the inside he could see him
[1:08:29] out
[1:08:30] say the rainbow wherever it is
[1:08:32] that's what it is if you're looking at
[1:08:35] him from an intellectual standpoint
[1:08:36] she'll never know him you've got to look
[1:08:39] through him let him come into you and
[1:08:40] show his self
[1:08:42] what he is
[1:08:44] we can see god if we'll just look around
[1:08:47] and i'm afraid some of us might look too
[1:08:50] late
[1:08:51] there's a lady in a 10-cent store in
[1:08:53] louisville across the river from us a
[1:08:55] few months ago
[1:08:56] she had a little boy
[1:08:58] a little bitty lad about three years old
[1:09:00] and the people noticed she go around
[1:09:02] pick up things and try to show him off
[1:09:04] the 10 cent door counters
[1:09:07] and he just stared a little lad
[1:09:10] so she come to another counter she began
[1:09:12] to get hysterically
[1:09:14] and she picked up something else like a
[1:09:16] little boy that age ought to notice and
[1:09:18] rang the little bell on the little
[1:09:19] trinket said look honey look honey the
[1:09:21] little boy just sat staring
[1:09:24] she was exhausted and she just fell over
[1:09:26] the counter screaming oh no no it isn't
[1:09:28] so
[1:09:29] and this bystanders rushed to the lady
[1:09:32] to see what had happened
[1:09:34] she said my little boy
[1:09:36] a few months ago just started staring
[1:09:38] right in his face
[1:09:40] nothing that off to attract him attracts
[1:09:42] his attention
[1:09:44] and said i took him to the doctor and
[1:09:45] the doctor said he was better but said
[1:09:47] he isn't that he just sets and stares he
[1:09:50] won't look at things that he ought to
[1:09:51] look at for a little boy of his age and
[1:09:54] how true that is with the church today
[1:09:57] we've had great men across this country
[1:09:58] like old roberts and great gifts has
[1:10:01] come into the church
[1:10:02] and they the church just sat in stairs
[1:10:06] the baptism of the holy spirit struck
[1:10:08] the nation and many churches have been
[1:10:10] filled with the spirit and great
[1:10:12] revivals has taken place and the world
[1:10:14] just sets and stares in space
[1:10:17] when god does anything he expects people
[1:10:19] to look at it and believing
[1:10:21] miracles and signs and wonders that god
[1:10:23] does is a little something you're
[1:10:25] shaking before the church to wake up the
[1:10:27] church
[1:10:28] that is soon coming
[1:10:31] my son and i
[1:10:33] recently we visit india
[1:10:36] and i read a piece in the paper that we
[1:10:38] got uh on the plane
[1:10:40] and said i guess the earthquake is over
[1:10:42] a few days before the earthquake come
[1:10:44] in india they just pick up the rocks and
[1:10:47] make fences and walls and so forth they
[1:10:50] don't have the woven wire and the stuff
[1:10:52] that we have here they're very poor
[1:10:54] people 470 million there and about look
[1:10:56] at me a million beggars
[1:10:58] and very pathetic sight
[1:11:01] some of the minister brother and if you
[1:11:03] ever see them sites you you can never
[1:11:05] feel satisfied here no more there's
[1:11:07] something them thousands of screaming
[1:11:09] and crying to hear the story of jesus in
[1:11:11] here you have to almost persuade people
[1:11:13] to come to church
[1:11:14] but they're they're hungering there for
[1:11:16] god
[1:11:18] and
[1:11:19] the paper went on to read that all the
[1:11:21] little birds that makes her nest up in
[1:11:23] the crevices of the rocks and things
[1:11:25] flew away out into the field and sat in
[1:11:27] the trees
[1:11:29] and all the sheep and cattle stood
[1:11:31] around the big wall
[1:11:32] went out into the field and leaned
[1:11:34] against each other
[1:11:36] for about a day and all at once our
[1:11:38] coming earthquake and shut the walls
[1:11:40] down
[1:11:42] and then for a day the little birds
[1:11:44] stayed away and the cattle stayed in the
[1:11:46] field finally they began to come back
[1:11:48] around the shade again what part of the
[1:11:50] walls was left what was it the same god
[1:11:54] that could call them into the ark
[1:11:57] could call them away from them walls
[1:11:58] that lost your lives that they'd stayed
[1:12:00] around there
[1:12:01] and surely if the holy spirit can still
[1:12:05] have inspiration and by instinct direct
[1:12:08] an animal away from danger and a bird
[1:12:11] how much more ought to do to his
[1:12:12] children
[1:12:14] born of the spirit of god to get away
[1:12:16] from the things that's not godly stay
[1:12:19] away from it come out lean on each other
[1:12:22] oh i love that old story the song we're
[1:12:25] leaning on the everlasting arm i like
[1:12:28] that
[1:12:29] just trust him simplicity of the trust
[1:12:32] just lean your shoulders against his and
[1:12:36] adore him with all the adoration that
[1:12:38] you can pour out and walk with him daily
[1:12:41] now you'll see
[1:12:43] now
[1:12:46] the only way i perhaps tonight we got
[1:12:48] methodist baptists and and this the
[1:12:51] coast into mexico we probably got many
[1:12:53] mexican catholic and so forth all mixed
[1:12:57] together
[1:12:58] now that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:13:01] god loves all of his children they're
[1:13:04] mixed in all organization
[1:13:06] loving god trusting christ for their
[1:13:08] salvation
[1:13:10] then if i'd say to the catholic
[1:13:13] would you see jesus
[1:13:15] well let's say our church represents him
[1:13:18] i'd say to the baptist
[1:13:20] the would you see jesus uh our church is
[1:13:24] the one who shows him
[1:13:26] the methodist the pentecostal and
[1:13:28] different ones would all have a
[1:13:30] different idea of it i think tonight to
[1:13:33] bring it down to
[1:13:34] a simple thing
[1:13:36] that the best way to find out
[1:13:39] what he is is to go back and find out
[1:13:42] what he was
[1:13:44] well he was yesterday if he's the same
[1:13:47] yesterday today and forever what he was
[1:13:49] he must be the same thing today
[1:13:52] would that be sufficient for all
[1:13:54] churches then you can you can suit that
[1:13:57] to yourself
[1:13:58] whether your church teaches it this way
[1:14:00] or not find out what he was
[1:14:03] and if he is the same yesterday and
[1:14:05] forever what he was he must be the same
[1:14:07] today
[1:14:09] uh let's go back i'm reading out of
[1:14:10] saint john the first chapter of saint
[1:14:13] john and we'll go back and see what he
[1:14:15] was now you can take it and approach it
[1:14:17] from any word in the scriptures we can
[1:14:19] hold a two weeks meeting and just on
[1:14:21] what he was or two weeks
[1:14:24] two centuries and never get out what he
[1:14:26] was but just to get a few highlights
[1:14:30] of what he was then if he'll be the same
[1:14:33] today right here as he was then that
[1:14:36] makes him the same
[1:14:37] that ought to settle the question y'all
[1:14:40] believe it
[1:14:41] that's good now
[1:14:44] we found out we was born to the virgin
[1:14:46] birth we had that this morning and then
[1:14:49] we found out immediately the holy spirit
[1:14:51] came upon him he was led into the
[1:14:52] wilderness and was tempted of the devil
[1:14:54] for 40 days and came out
[1:14:56] preaching the gospel
[1:14:59] now
[1:15:00] we find
[1:15:01] the first
[1:15:02] of his ministry he started
[1:15:05] praying for the sick
[1:15:06] the sick people being healed
[1:15:09] and we noticed that his congregation
[1:15:12] come from the
[1:15:14] the poor people
[1:15:16] the the outcasts
[1:15:19] the ones that were probably cast away
[1:15:22] didn't have much education like the man
[1:15:24] he gave the keys to the kingdom peter
[1:15:26] couldn't even sign his own name
[1:15:28] the bible said he was ignorant and
[1:15:31] unlearned
[1:15:32] but by his faith it pleased jesus to
[1:15:34] give him the keys to the kingdom because
[1:15:37] he had the revelation of him
[1:15:40] who does man say are the son of man out
[1:15:42] one said our of the elijah and one said
[1:15:44] you're the prophet and you're so and so
[1:15:47] he said but who do you say
[1:15:49] he said the art the christ the son of
[1:15:51] the living god
[1:15:52] now the catholic says that he build his
[1:15:54] church upon peter if he did he backslid
[1:15:57] right away
[1:15:58] then if the protestant said he built it
[1:16:00] up on himself are different from that it
[1:16:03] wasn't upon himself either up on peter
[1:16:05] but upon the revelation
[1:16:07] i say unto thee the heart simon
[1:16:09] all right peter
[1:16:11] flesh and blood does not reveal this to
[1:16:13] you but my father which is in heaven has
[1:16:15] revealed and upon this rock i'll build
[1:16:18] my church and the gates of hell cannot
[1:16:21] prevail against it amen
[1:16:23] see if
[1:16:24] it's the revelation
[1:16:26] of christ if he can reveal himself
[1:16:29] tonight to you that he's present
[1:16:32] then you are in that church
[1:16:35] by the revelation notice
[1:16:38] we take his early ministry the first one
[1:16:41] we want to start off with here was
[1:16:44] andrew
[1:16:45] a fisherman
[1:16:46] he found him and perhaps he went back
[1:16:48] and told his brother simon
[1:16:51] come see who we found
[1:16:53] we found the messiah
[1:16:56] now they were looking for a messiah they
[1:16:58] thought john was the messiah many people
[1:17:01] believed he was
[1:17:02] but notice now we're going to find out
[1:17:04] what he was
[1:17:05] and when i can imagine peter saying not
[1:17:08] just a minute
[1:17:09] of course his name is simon then
[1:17:12] he said uh andrew you probably got off
[1:17:14] on a deep end somewhere on some kind of
[1:17:16] a tantrum
[1:17:18] i know when the messiah comes
[1:17:20] my whole father told me said son one day
[1:17:23] when we were sitting down for the lake
[1:17:24] after fishing i can see his gray hairs
[1:17:27] he said simon my boy your dad is always
[1:17:31] long to see the day when the messiah
[1:17:34] would arise
[1:17:35] but i'm getting old now i perhaps won't
[1:17:37] see it but simon don't you forget this
[1:17:41] that when he comes there'll be
[1:17:43] many things taking place
[1:17:45] you must remember simon
[1:17:48] you be scriptural the bible says our
[1:17:52] readings tell us
[1:17:53] moses the prophet said when the messiah
[1:17:56] comes he will be a prophet
[1:17:59] for it is written in the book of the law
[1:18:02] the lord god shall raise up a prophet
[1:18:04] like an unto me
[1:18:06] is that scripture
[1:18:08] and remember you'll not be just a fancy
[1:18:11] person but he'll be a a plain man a
[1:18:14] prophet a great prophet a god prophet
[1:18:17] when he comes
[1:18:19] and you've been well instructed in that
[1:18:22] so when andrew come and told him come
[1:18:26] see
[1:18:27] jesus of nazareth
[1:18:29] he is that prophet
[1:18:31] i can imagine simon saying now just a
[1:18:34] minute
[1:18:35] i don't know what's happened to you but
[1:18:37] surely you haven't forgot the teaching
[1:18:39] of the scripture
[1:18:40] but just for old time's sake i'll go
[1:18:42] with you when he walked up into the
[1:18:44] presence of the lord jesus
[1:18:46] jesus looked him in the face and said
[1:18:48] your name is simon
[1:18:51] and you are the son of jonas
[1:18:54] peter recognized it right quick that
[1:18:56] that must be him
[1:18:58] not only did he know who he was but he
[1:19:00] know who his father was
[1:19:03] there was one staying there by the name
[1:19:04] of philip the one we read about tonight
[1:19:07] it thrilled his heart in such a way he
[1:19:09] had to go tell his friend about it
[1:19:12] there's something about knowing jesus
[1:19:13] christ when you ever really find the
[1:19:15] real christ you can't sit still you've
[1:19:17] got to tell it somewhere
[1:19:20] so we see philip
[1:19:23] taking off around the hill if he's ever
[1:19:25] in palestine
[1:19:26] see where jesus is preaching around the
[1:19:28] world his friend nathaniel lived it's
[1:19:31] about 15 miles
[1:19:34] no doubt he ran around that mountain
[1:19:36] let's this dramatized it for a moment i
[1:19:39] can see him knock at the door
[1:19:41] little sick children here i want him to
[1:19:43] get it
[1:19:44] there's simple little faith
[1:19:46] knocked at the door perhaps mrs
[1:19:48] nathanael came to the door
[1:19:51] he said didn't have time to
[1:19:53] have much kind of a greeting he said
[1:19:55] where's nathanael said oh he's back into
[1:19:58] the uh orchard back there of praying
[1:20:01] back in the orchard
[1:20:02] and back to the orchard he went and he
[1:20:05] already found him under a tree praying i
[1:20:07] believe a philip being a christian man
[1:20:10] he didn't interrupt him when he was
[1:20:11] praying actually he got through his
[1:20:13] prayer and said amen got up and dusted
[1:20:15] off his clothes
[1:20:17] and just then he looked around and seen
[1:20:18] his friend phillip he said philip i'm
[1:20:21] glad to meet you
[1:20:23] again
[1:20:24] have you come to visit me my brother
[1:20:28] well there's something about it when a
[1:20:30] man gets
[1:20:31] ahold of god and god gets a hold of the
[1:20:34] man
[1:20:34] he went right straight to the point that
[1:20:37] come see who we have found
[1:20:41] come and see
[1:20:43] jesus of nazareth the son of joseph
[1:20:48] and now you know
[1:20:49] nathanael was a staunch
[1:20:51] orthodox believer
[1:20:53] now wait a minute phillip
[1:20:56] i've known you to be a good solid man
[1:20:59] but
[1:21:00] could that come any good thing out of
[1:21:03] nazareth
[1:21:04] i think he gave him the best answer that
[1:21:06] any man could give don't sit home and
[1:21:08] criticize it come see
[1:21:12] come look it over yourself examine it by
[1:21:15] the scriptures and see if it's right
[1:21:17] that's a good idea
[1:21:19] come see for yourself
[1:21:22] don't criticize come and find out
[1:21:26] oh
[1:21:27] our imagination nathaniel said now wait
[1:21:29] what organization did he come through
[1:21:32] that would be the 1961 version of it
[1:21:36] but
[1:21:37] he didn't say now wait a minute we know
[1:21:39] if messiah comes you'll come to
[1:21:41] cahephasis campus is the high priest
[1:21:44] he's the greatest religious in the
[1:21:45] country or we know he'd come to the
[1:21:47] bishop or the general overseer or
[1:21:49] somebody like that but god goes where he
[1:21:52] wants to and the son of our business
[1:21:53] what he does
[1:21:55] he does it to suit himself amen
[1:21:57] certainly he never come to anyone but he
[1:21:59] come to the porn fishermen and in a
[1:22:02] manger
[1:22:03] and the shepherds and so forth
[1:22:06] notice
[1:22:08] as they went on their way i can imagine
[1:22:10] them talking having a little
[1:22:12] that do you remember
[1:22:14] uh nathanael you are a well versed
[1:22:17] scholar
[1:22:19] tell me nathanael
[1:22:21] what is this messiah to be that's
[1:22:24] promised us
[1:22:25] how will we know him according to the
[1:22:27] law
[1:22:29] that while he'll be a prophet
[1:22:32] because moses said the lord your god
[1:22:33] shall raise up a prophet like and unto
[1:22:35] me he'll be a god prophet you know the
[1:22:38] jews always believe they're prophets
[1:22:41] for the bible said if there'd be one
[1:22:43] among you who's spiritual or prophet i
[1:22:45] the lord will make myself known to him
[1:22:47] and what he says comes to pass then
[1:22:49] hearing or i'm with him that's the way
[1:22:52] to judge this meeting tonight
[1:22:55] if the word says so in the holy spirit's
[1:22:57] true it'll manifest it if it doesn't
[1:22:59] then it's not the holy spirit
[1:23:01] that's
[1:23:02] judge it by your own self and by the
[1:23:05] word
[1:23:06] then
[1:23:07] he said you remember that old fisherman
[1:23:09] that you bought the fish from that time
[1:23:11] down on the river and he couldn't sign
[1:23:12] his name for your receipt yeah
[1:23:14] you know his name is simon yes
[1:23:17] his brother brought him to the meeting
[1:23:18] yesterday before i left and as soon as
[1:23:21] he walked up in the presence of jesus he
[1:23:24] looked at him and said your name is
[1:23:26] simon
[1:23:28] you remember his dad sure
[1:23:30] and he said your father's name is jonas
[1:23:34] that was jesus yesterday
[1:23:37] that's why jesus made himself known
[1:23:40] as the messiah
[1:23:42] if that's the way he did it yesterday
[1:23:43] he'll have to do it today if he's the
[1:23:44] same yesterday today and
[1:23:46] forever he'll be the god prophet
[1:23:51] watch what he did
[1:23:53] he said it wouldn't surprise me if he
[1:23:55] didn't tell you who you were when you
[1:23:56] come up in the meeting ah
[1:23:58] i have to see it finally they arrived
[1:24:02] maybe he walked into the prayer line
[1:24:03] where jesus praying for the sick
[1:24:05] maybe he set out the audience i do not
[1:24:08] know
[1:24:08] but however when jesus fastened his eyes
[1:24:11] on him he said behold an israelite
[1:24:14] and whom there's no guile
[1:24:17] how did he know him
[1:24:19] oh he's saying where he dressed oh no
[1:24:21] all of them dressed the same the
[1:24:22] easterners wore turbans he could have
[1:24:24] been a greek he could have been
[1:24:25] arabian they wore turbans and loose
[1:24:28] hanging garments he
[1:24:30] didn't astonished himself until he
[1:24:33] stopped and said
[1:24:35] rabbi means teacher
[1:24:39] when did you ever know me
[1:24:41] well you never see me in your life
[1:24:43] how do you know that i'm a was an
[1:24:45] israelite and an honest and just man
[1:24:49] i could see those eyes look back at him
[1:24:51] again and say before philip called you
[1:24:53] when you were under the tree i saw you
[1:25:00] day before and 15 miles around the
[1:25:02] mountains what eyes
[1:25:05] what did this fella say
[1:25:08] the rabbi
[1:25:09] thou art the son of god you're the king
[1:25:12] of israel
[1:25:14] sure
[1:25:15] he was taught
[1:25:17] he knowed what you believed he know that
[1:25:19] was the prophet that moses spoke of
[1:25:22] god the son of god
[1:25:25] god the king of israel
[1:25:28] and jesus said because i told you this
[1:25:31] you believe now i said yes he said then
[1:25:33] you'll see greater than this
[1:25:37] or you'll see angels descending and
[1:25:38] ascending
[1:25:40] but there was some standing there who
[1:25:42] didn't believe that
[1:25:43] the great scholars of the day
[1:25:46] they had to answer their congregation
[1:25:48] because the congregation is going to ask
[1:25:50] them the question
[1:25:51] so you know what they said
[1:25:53] they couldn't figure it out how he knew
[1:25:54] those things
[1:25:56] perceived their thoughts
[1:25:57] so forth and was a prophet you could
[1:25:59] tell them what was and what was coming
[1:26:01] see it so perfectly because the
[1:26:02] scripture said that would be the messiah
[1:26:05] if that was a sign of messiah yesterday
[1:26:08] the same stein is the sign of messiah
[1:26:11] today
[1:26:12] not because some men walk down the
[1:26:14] street with scars in his hand
[1:26:16] blood and oil pouring from him or
[1:26:18] whatever it might be with a robe on that
[1:26:20] could be a hypocrite
[1:26:22] but brother the life inside the vine
[1:26:25] tells what it is
[1:26:27] jesus said i'm the vine you're the
[1:26:28] branches if the first branch come out of
[1:26:31] that vine produced the pentecostal
[1:26:32] church and wrote a book of acts behind
[1:26:34] it
[1:26:35] if that same vine produces another
[1:26:37] branch they'll do the same thing behind
[1:26:39] it
[1:26:40] a grapevine puts forth grapes
[1:26:43] but cheeto is
[1:26:44] is western people here
[1:26:47] i've seen the citrus tree here in
[1:26:48] arizona i believe that about eight or
[1:26:50] nine different kinds of citrus fruit on
[1:26:51] it
[1:26:52] but it's grafted
[1:26:54] and today we got too much grafted into
[1:26:56] the church
[1:26:58] the it can't bear the fruit you put up
[1:27:00] an orange tree and put a lemon branch in
[1:27:02] it it'll bury lemons
[1:27:04] it lives off the life of the tree but it
[1:27:06] bears its own fruit lemon
[1:27:08] and so is that today we got churches
[1:27:10] that call themselves christian churches
[1:27:13] but they bear the marks of theology
[1:27:16] and of organization
[1:27:18] but if that pentecostal vine
[1:27:21] that made a pentecostal church ever put
[1:27:23] forth another pentecostal branch it'll
[1:27:26] be like it was at the beginning
[1:27:27] exactly right
[1:27:29] if jesus christ appears in the church
[1:27:31] he'll be the same as he was back there
[1:27:33] it won't bear lemons or grapefruits
[1:27:35] that'll bear oranges if it's an orange
[1:27:37] tree and it puts forth its branch
[1:27:39] it'll not be organizations it'll not be
[1:27:41] denominations it'll be christ
[1:27:45] correctly amen
[1:27:47] notice they stood with their hands
[1:27:49] behind him they know they had to answer
[1:27:51] because he didn't speak well of them
[1:27:53] well they said he does this to the power
[1:27:56] of the elder bub
[1:27:59] elder above the devil
[1:28:01] and anybody knows that fortune telling
[1:28:03] is of the devil
[1:28:05] all those things are of the devil and
[1:28:07] everything the devil has is something is
[1:28:09] perverted from real
[1:28:11] the devil cannot create he's not a
[1:28:13] creator he's only one creator that's god
[1:28:16] he can pervert what has been created
[1:28:19] a good woman can be in the world more
[1:28:21] and just the devil can pervert her and
[1:28:23] make her wicked one what is the lie
[1:28:25] is the truth misrepresented
[1:28:28] what is evil is righteousness perverted
[1:28:32] that's what
[1:28:33] what is unbelief is belief
[1:28:36] perverted
[1:28:37] the devil perverts but cannot create
[1:28:40] he's no creator is one creator that's
[1:28:42] god
[1:28:44] you could create anything you wanted to
[1:28:45] if he was a creator but only one creator
[1:28:47] and that is god
[1:28:49] now we find those fellows that are
[1:28:52] saying that this man was doing this to
[1:28:53] the power of the devil
[1:28:55] listen
[1:28:56] listen close now don't miss this
[1:29:00] jesus turned to them and said
[1:29:04] i forgive you for that
[1:29:08] calling him a devil calling the spirit
[1:29:10] of god that was doing those works a
[1:29:12] devil
[1:29:13] said i forgive you but someday
[1:29:16] the holy spirit's coming
[1:29:18] to do the same thing
[1:29:20] and one word against it will never be
[1:29:22] forgiven in this world neither in the
[1:29:24] world it is to come
[1:29:26] do you see where we stand
[1:29:28] all right
[1:29:30] we noticed that was jesus yesterday
[1:29:32] oh how we could go however down there in
[1:29:35] the city of
[1:29:36] jericho i imagine little zacchaeus got
[1:29:39] up in a tree and said now i'm going to
[1:29:41] watch him pass by
[1:29:42] but of course i heard my wife say that
[1:29:44] if he could pursue
[1:29:46] discern the thoughts of mine and think
[1:29:48] not only i'm doing any of that on me so
[1:29:50] i'll be set up here in a tree i'll watch
[1:29:52] but when jesus is coming around
[1:29:54] hallelujah avenue and down glory road we
[1:29:57] turn the corner there and you're still
[1:29:59] zach gets up in the tree all camouflaged
[1:30:01] maybe a leaf just raised up looking out
[1:30:04] oh i'd like to see him he said when he
[1:30:06] passed by i heard my wife say that he
[1:30:09] could speak the thoughts of the mind and
[1:30:11] he could do these things to tell me he's
[1:30:13] the prophet but i'll tell you you sure
[1:30:16] be some prophet you know where i was at
[1:30:18] but i fully now got behind these bushes
[1:30:20] here sitting on a fork and limb that's
[1:30:22] where a lot of people sets where your
[1:30:23] way in god's way meets
[1:30:25] you gotta take one of them
[1:30:27] oh seems sitting up there looking over
[1:30:30] this leaf looking down jesus walking
[1:30:32] straight and quietly come down the tree
[1:30:35] and lift you up
[1:30:36] said zacchaeus come on down going home
[1:30:40] with you today
[1:30:41] oh
[1:30:42] mom
[1:30:44] that was jesus yesterday
[1:30:46] he's the same yesterday and forever be
[1:30:48] jesus today
[1:30:51] remember
[1:30:52] when he went through he didn't do that
[1:30:54] himself saint john 19 we could go to
[1:30:56] that well let's go to saint john 5 19.
[1:30:59] jesus said he passed through the gate
[1:31:02] called beautiful
[1:31:04] and uh
[1:31:05] the pools rather bethesda
[1:31:07] i get to that in a few minutes to get a
[1:31:09] beautiful day he passed through besides
[1:31:12] the gate where the pool was
[1:31:14] and that was great multitudes of lame
[1:31:16] blind halt withered laying there
[1:31:19] probably all kinds of afflicted people
[1:31:22] the bible said great multitudes and he
[1:31:24] passed by them never touched in one of
[1:31:26] them yet full compassion
[1:31:28] full of love walked around till he found
[1:31:31] a man laying on a pallet
[1:31:33] how many of you don't know what a pallet
[1:31:35] is
[1:31:36] or what part of kentucky are you from
[1:31:40] i was raised on one
[1:31:42] sleep in the door hot weather
[1:31:44] and this man is laying on a pallet
[1:31:46] perhaps he he might have had prostrate
[1:31:48] trouble or he might have had two burglar
[1:31:50] it was he had it 38 years
[1:31:52] but remember jesus knew all about it
[1:31:54] knew where he was laying and he came to
[1:31:56] him and said will thou be made whole
[1:31:59] passing by the rest of them
[1:32:01] will thou be made old he said i have no
[1:32:03] one to put me in the water he could walk
[1:32:05] said while i'm coming somebody else
[1:32:07] outruns him gets in the pool first
[1:32:10] and he said take up thy bed and go into
[1:32:12] the house
[1:32:13] and then jesus's question of it
[1:32:16] if he come to this city and did the same
[1:32:18] thing tonight he'd still be questioning
[1:32:21] but what did he say
[1:32:22] listen
[1:32:23] think john 5 19 verily verily i say unto
[1:32:27] you the son can do nothing in himself
[1:32:30] but what he sees the father doing that
[1:32:33] do it the son likewise
[1:32:35] jesus never performed one miracle
[1:32:38] without the father showing him first or
[1:32:40] he told something wrong there
[1:32:43] verily verily i say unto you the son can
[1:32:45] do nothing in himself
[1:32:47] no doubt this sin why didn't you heal mr
[1:32:49] jones over there he's sold pencils on
[1:32:51] the street for so long here's old sister
[1:32:53] cass horn over here well she's at arthur
[1:32:55] right a few years why didn't you heal
[1:32:56] her she's a good woman she's a member of
[1:32:58] my synagogue he said i do just as the
[1:33:00] father shows me the father worketh and i
[1:33:03] work in the other jews
[1:33:05] oh i asked jesus yesterday that's jesus
[1:33:07] today
[1:33:08] the same jesus works as the father shows
[1:33:12] him amen
[1:33:13] we noticed it
[1:33:15] we see a woman coming through and she
[1:33:17] said if i could just touch the hymn of
[1:33:19] his garment saint john if i could touch
[1:33:22] the hem of his garment ivy made well
[1:33:25] and she pressed through now he couldn't
[1:33:26] feel her touch just by simply feeling it
[1:33:29] physically because the palestinian
[1:33:31] garment hangs loose
[1:33:33] and had underneath garment to keep dust
[1:33:35] off their limbs then they had that's
[1:33:37] reason they washed feet
[1:33:38] and the hem of his garment i couldn't
[1:33:40] tell you to touch my coat
[1:33:42] and how about that garment hanging loose
[1:33:44] but he felt the spirit
[1:33:46] oh man was around him but that little
[1:33:48] woman touched him and she stood up for
[1:33:50] she stayed within herself if i could
[1:33:52] just touch the bar of his garment i'll
[1:33:54] be made well
[1:33:56] and jesus stopped and said who touched
[1:33:59] me
[1:33:59] and simon peter said rebuked him and
[1:34:02] said why do you say a thing like that
[1:34:05] say well all of them is touching it he
[1:34:07] said but i perceive that i have gotten
[1:34:09] weak virtues gone from me
[1:34:12] and he looked around over the audience
[1:34:13] until he found the little woman and he
[1:34:16] told her a blood issue and said thy
[1:34:18] faith has saved thee
[1:34:21] that was jesus yesterday
[1:34:23] and tonight at the clergyman the bible
[1:34:26] said that jesus christ tonight is a high
[1:34:29] priest setting in glory that can be
[1:34:31] touched by the feeling of our
[1:34:33] infirmities
[1:34:35] if you touch jesus night like that woman
[1:34:37] did then how would he act he'd act the
[1:34:40] same way he did then
[1:34:41] if he's the same yesterday and forever
[1:34:43] he'd turn and say you had so and so but
[1:34:47] now thy faith has healed thee
[1:34:49] if he's the same
[1:34:51] now remember there's only it's closing
[1:34:54] there's only three classes of people or
[1:34:57] three
[1:34:57] um
[1:34:58] nationalities really in the world
[1:35:03] that's ham shame and japan's people
[1:35:06] that's the three sons of noah we believe
[1:35:08] the bible and all the human race sprang
[1:35:11] from them three sons
[1:35:13] if we're gonna believe the word
[1:35:15] that was jew gentile and samaritan
[1:35:18] now remember the samaritans and the jews
[1:35:21] uh samaritans had jew and gentile so
[1:35:24] they were looking for a messiah
[1:35:27] and the real true in heart he revealed
[1:35:30] himself to them and that was his
[1:35:32] decision
[1:35:34] remember
[1:35:35] his decision to make yourself knowing as
[1:35:38] messiah
[1:35:39] for showing them that sign
[1:35:41] them that believed him had eternal life
[1:35:44] those that rejected him went off into
[1:35:46] everlasting destruction
[1:35:49] now we find him that's how he made
[1:35:51] himself known to the jews we could go
[1:35:53] look at blind bartimaeus
[1:35:55] and how oh
[1:35:57] the scriptures we could refer to
[1:35:59] now remember
[1:36:01] he also said
[1:36:03] he had need to go by samaria saint john
[1:36:05] 4.
[1:36:07] he was on his road to jericho he had to
[1:36:09] go up around the hill to samaria
[1:36:11] and when he got to the samaria he sent
[1:36:14] his disciples into the city to buy some
[1:36:16] food around noon
[1:36:19] he sat on the well a panoramic something
[1:36:21] like this
[1:36:23] there was a i'd say a beautiful young
[1:36:25] woman came out
[1:36:27] we were here in america as being a
[1:36:29] prostitute
[1:36:30] she had bunches of husbands she
[1:36:33] lived with
[1:36:34] and she came out to get her water maybe
[1:36:36] because you've been out all night and
[1:36:38] slept up to noon
[1:36:39] usually the virgins go to the well early
[1:36:41] in the morning you ought to watch them
[1:36:43] how they wind all that water out and put
[1:36:45] a five gallon jar on top of their head
[1:36:46] and one on each hip and walk and talk
[1:36:48] like ladies can never spill a drop of it
[1:36:51] but
[1:36:52] pardon me
[1:36:54] now
[1:36:55] but maybe
[1:36:56] she couldn't come with the nice people
[1:36:58] she had to come when all the estimate
[1:36:59] got their water
[1:37:01] so we find her coming out to the well
[1:37:04] and she starts to let her a little put
[1:37:06] the little hooks in the handles on the
[1:37:08] side
[1:37:09] of the jug and let it down to window up
[1:37:12] some water and she heard a voice saying
[1:37:14] woman
[1:37:15] bring me a drink
[1:37:17] and she looked over
[1:37:19] and she seen a jew sitting there
[1:37:22] a young man
[1:37:23] he looked well he was only 30 but the
[1:37:25] bible said he looked 50.
[1:37:27] you know that i guess his work done that
[1:37:28] to him
[1:37:30] well they said in saint john 6 chapter
[1:37:32] you say that you have seen abraham
[1:37:35] and you're a man not over 50 years old
[1:37:37] he said before abraham was i am
[1:37:42] i am within the burning bush you know
[1:37:45] so
[1:37:46] he said you're not over 50 years old so
[1:37:48] he's standing over against the wall and
[1:37:50] asking this woman for a drink now they
[1:37:51] had segregation there like they used to
[1:37:53] have in the south she said it's not
[1:37:55] customary for you jews to ask
[1:37:57] samaritan's samaritan woman that's not
[1:38:00] customary in these days listen to the
[1:38:02] conversation
[1:38:04] don't miss it
[1:38:07] he said if you knew who you were talking
[1:38:10] to
[1:38:12] hey
[1:38:15] i wonder not the church really knew
[1:38:18] the presence of the lord would share
[1:38:22] if you only knew who you were talking to
[1:38:26] you'd ask me for a drink
[1:38:29] not give you water that you don't come
[1:38:31] here to draw
[1:38:32] she said the wells deep you have nothing
[1:38:34] to draw with and the conversation what's
[1:38:36] he trying to do contact your spirit
[1:38:39] the father had sent him up there he
[1:38:40] didn't know why
[1:38:42] but this woman come out he's trying to
[1:38:44] contact her spirit
[1:38:46] he said um
[1:38:48] he said uh she said you say worship at
[1:38:50] jerusalem our fathers worshipped in this
[1:38:53] mountain you said jerusalem jesus said
[1:38:55] god's a spirit they that worship him
[1:38:57] with worshipping spirit and truth the
[1:38:59] conversation went on for a few minutes
[1:39:01] until he found water trouble was now
[1:39:03] listen
[1:39:05] it'll do you good in a few minutes
[1:39:07] see
[1:39:09] he talked to her until he found her
[1:39:11] trouble
[1:39:12] and he said go get your husband and come
[1:39:14] here
[1:39:16] she said i have no husband watch he's
[1:39:18] making them samaritans now he jumped
[1:39:20] into the jew
[1:39:23] said go get your husband and come here
[1:39:24] she said i have no husband he said you
[1:39:26] said well
[1:39:27] you've had five
[1:39:29] therefore the one you're living with now
[1:39:30] is not your husband you said the truth
[1:39:33] what did she do
[1:39:35] she know more about god and half the
[1:39:37] preachers does
[1:39:38] and her in that condition
[1:39:40] more than they did then anyhow she said
[1:39:43] sir she didn't call him blc bub a
[1:39:45] fortune teller
[1:39:47] said sir i perceive that you are a
[1:39:50] prophet
[1:39:52] i listen we know
[1:39:55] that when messiah comes which is called
[1:39:57] christ he'll tell us these things
[1:40:00] sign of the messiah
[1:40:02] we samaritans know
[1:40:04] that the messiah will do this sign so
[1:40:07] you must be his prophet
[1:40:09] jesus said i'm he that speaks to you oh
[1:40:12] my god
[1:40:14] see
[1:40:15] she is taught to know what the messiah
[1:40:18] would do
[1:40:19] not how he would dress but what he would
[1:40:21] do
[1:40:24] not what kind of teaching he'd have but
[1:40:25] he said if i do not to worse to my
[1:40:28] father then don't believe me
[1:40:31] they knew he'd be a god prophet
[1:40:34] she said you must be a prophet
[1:40:37] now we know when the messiah comes which
[1:40:39] you call christ
[1:40:40] he'll tell us all these things
[1:40:43] see that's the sign he would do but who
[1:40:45] are they who are you
[1:40:47] he said i'm he
[1:40:49] what she do she left the water pot she
[1:40:52] ran into the city and said come see a
[1:40:54] man
[1:40:55] who told me the things that i've done
[1:40:57] isn't this the very messiah
[1:41:00] and the bible said that the man of the
[1:41:02] city believed on him
[1:41:05] because the woman's testimony that he
[1:41:07] told her
[1:41:09] what her troubles was
[1:41:11] if that was his sign yesterday
[1:41:13] it's his sign today
[1:41:16] now look
[1:41:17] hunt through the scriptures and you'll
[1:41:19] never see one time he did that sign
[1:41:21] before a gentile
[1:41:24] why
[1:41:25] gentiles we angled saxon had clubs on
[1:41:27] our back in this caveman
[1:41:29] we wasn't looking for an old messiah
[1:41:32] messiah only comes to those who are
[1:41:34] looking for him
[1:41:36] now in closing my last comment i might
[1:41:39] say this
[1:41:40] i don't look at that clock back there
[1:41:41] and it makes me nervous
[1:41:43] notice there's so much to be said so
[1:41:45] much you could tie in
[1:41:47] but now remember ham sham and japan
[1:41:49] steeple
[1:41:50] the jews the samaritans and the gentiles
[1:41:53] now the jews and samaritans was looking
[1:41:56] for a messiah
[1:41:59] and he made himself known to them
[1:42:01] as a messiah by being able to show them
[1:42:04] that he was the prophet that moses spoke
[1:42:07] up that would come amen
[1:42:10] i all understand say amen
[1:42:12] all right
[1:42:14] now
[1:42:15] the gentiles has had 2 000 years
[1:42:18] and now the gentiles are coming to the
[1:42:21] end
[1:42:23] now
[1:42:23] what did we say this morning if god ever
[1:42:26] makes the decision and does anything one
[1:42:28] way he's got to do it the next time the
[1:42:30] same way or he did it wrong the first
[1:42:32] time
[1:42:34] you understand it now
[1:42:36] now just one more little scripture
[1:42:38] forgive me for just a moment i just got
[1:42:39] to get this here jesus said in luke 16 i
[1:42:42] believe it was
[1:42:44] as it was in the days of sodom
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:48] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[1:42:50] of man do you ever read that
[1:42:52] i watch what happened in sodom
[1:42:55] out closely now we're going to start the
[1:42:57] prayer line
[1:43:01] there's always three classes of people
[1:43:04] abraham represented that called out
[1:43:06] church he was called out he separated
[1:43:09] himself from sodom
[1:43:12] and then there was a sodomite
[1:43:14] the wicked
[1:43:16] and there was also lot and
[1:43:20] the nominal christian down there
[1:43:22] lukewarm believer
[1:43:24] but he had separated himself from
[1:43:26] abraham because abraham was too poor
[1:43:30] out of the bearing grounds and took the
[1:43:32] rich places that's what the big classic
[1:43:34] churches have done today
[1:43:37] the rich
[1:43:40] but the true group the called out church
[1:43:43] now remember there's three classes
[1:43:46] two of them
[1:43:47] is down in sodom the satellite
[1:43:50] and also the uh
[1:43:52] the
[1:43:53] borderline believer lot
[1:43:56] and then there was abraham the called
[1:43:58] out group
[1:43:59] one day while sitting under his dope
[1:44:02] there was three men came up
[1:44:04] they had on clothes like man dust all
[1:44:07] over them and said they were strangers
[1:44:11] but they were more than strangers
[1:44:13] abraham being a man
[1:44:16] full of god believing god
[1:44:18] as soon as he's seen him he know there
[1:44:20] was something strange about him
[1:44:22] my sheep know my voice
[1:44:27] and so he ran out and met him and said
[1:44:29] come in and step out of the old and i'll
[1:44:32] fetch you a little water wash your feet
[1:44:34] and have a marshal of bread and then go
[1:44:35] on about your business
[1:44:37] you run into the tent
[1:44:39] told sarah said need
[1:44:41] some flour
[1:44:43] some meal make some
[1:44:45] takes on the earth
[1:44:47] and he ran out got a calf and killed it
[1:44:49] give it to his servant and said dress it
[1:44:52] and when they dressed it
[1:44:54] brought it out and they sat there and
[1:44:55] eat man
[1:44:57] eating like man
[1:45:00] and one kept looking down towards sodom
[1:45:04] finally two of them went down to sodom
[1:45:08] and this one and stayed behind
[1:45:11] told abraham said i'll not keep it a
[1:45:14] secret from you what i'm going to do
[1:45:17] he said i i've heard about the sodom
[1:45:19] being in that condition i've come down
[1:45:21] to investigate
[1:45:23] abraham knew that was god
[1:45:26] now a minister said to me not long ago
[1:45:28] and i made that remark he said do you
[1:45:30] mean that that man was god i said
[1:45:33] abraham said he was
[1:45:35] he's called el or him
[1:45:39] see if it isn't right
[1:45:41] elohim he said
[1:45:43] in a body of flesh i said absolutely you
[1:45:46] don't know how great our god is
[1:45:49] i said einstein walk out of heaven reach
[1:45:52] out we made out of 16 elements petroleum
[1:45:54] potassium cosmic light and petroleum
[1:45:57] he just got a handful that
[1:45:58] that step in your gable
[1:46:00] reached over another and stepped into
[1:46:02] another angel
[1:46:03] stepped into one himself and stepped
[1:46:05] right back out of it again i'm so glad i
[1:46:07] know him someday when i'm nothing but
[1:46:09] dust he'll call me and i'll answer him
[1:46:14] he'll call you you'll answer
[1:46:16] he's elohim
[1:46:19] self-existing one
[1:46:21] certainly
[1:46:22] now watch watch the sign he's done to
[1:46:24] the believer the called out church
[1:46:28] now there was a modern billy graham and
[1:46:29] them went on down and preached to them
[1:46:31] in sodom they didn't do no miracles only
[1:46:33] blinded him
[1:46:34] well the gospel blinds the unbeliever
[1:46:37] anyhow
[1:46:38] so they didn't do any miracles but
[1:46:41] called lot out of there him and his wife
[1:46:43] and children
[1:46:44] out of sodom but watch the one that's
[1:46:46] come to the elected church the one in
[1:46:49] the minority
[1:46:53] he close
[1:46:53] his back to the tent women and them days
[1:46:56] not like they are now after out take
[1:46:58] their husband's place and do all the
[1:46:59] talking they stay back in the tent where
[1:47:01] they belong so then he was
[1:47:04] wasn't brazing as they are all my
[1:47:07] that's your old business brother
[1:47:09] straighten that out but anyhow
[1:47:11] notice
[1:47:12] this man
[1:47:15] sat with his back to the tent and he
[1:47:17] said abraham
[1:47:20] where is your wife sarah
[1:47:24] how do you know he was married
[1:47:26] how do you know his wife's name is sarah
[1:47:29] now watch the bible said
[1:47:32] abraham said
[1:47:33] she is in the tent behind you
[1:47:37] and he said abraham ah
[1:47:41] i personally pruned him again
[1:47:44] i'm going to visit you according to the
[1:47:46] promise i gave you
[1:47:47] sarah was 90 years old and i'm going to
[1:47:50] visit you according to the promise to
[1:47:52] give us you're going to have that baby
[1:47:54] and sarah
[1:47:56] in the tent
[1:47:57] laughed in herself
[1:48:00] and the angel with his back turned said
[1:48:02] why did sarah laugh
[1:48:08] what was that
[1:48:10] knowing her name was sarah
[1:48:12] give him the promise and note she
[1:48:14] laughed at herself in the tent
[1:48:17] jesus said
[1:48:18] as it was in the days of sodom
[1:48:23] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:48:25] of man
[1:48:27] the gentiles had two thousand years of
[1:48:29] theology
[1:48:30] like the samaritan did
[1:48:32] now
[1:48:33] what was it an angel
[1:48:36] god to be working in human flesh
[1:48:40] that's what it was
[1:48:42] it was god in a human form
[1:48:44] now christ when he died he sanctified a
[1:48:47] church that he himself might come back
[1:48:49] and live in this church
[1:48:51] and do the thing that he did
[1:48:54] shall you do also is that right
[1:48:57] pardon me
[1:48:58] now if he's the same yesterday and
[1:49:00] forever he'll do like he did yesterday
[1:49:03] and we'll do it today and we'll be
[1:49:05] forever is that right
[1:49:07] now
[1:49:09] sirs
[1:49:10] we would see jesus
[1:49:13] where is he today
[1:49:15] he's in his church
[1:49:16] who is his church to call down
[1:49:19] what kind of a sign will he do as he
[1:49:22] promised
[1:49:24] how will he work at the same way he did
[1:49:26] when he come to abraham the same way he
[1:49:27] did when he comes to the jews the same
[1:49:29] way he did when he come to the
[1:49:30] samaritans and promised it at the end of
[1:49:32] the gentile age
[1:49:34] now
[1:49:35] if we can see him
[1:49:37] come on the scene no matter how much he
[1:49:38] would anoint me he's got to annoy you
[1:49:40] too when he come to his own city and
[1:49:43] many mighty works he could not do
[1:49:44] because of their unbelief so he has to
[1:49:47] know and shoot he has to anoint me and
[1:49:48] that makes the world see
[1:49:51] that jesus christ is the same because
[1:49:53] he's working in his church in human
[1:49:56] flesh that he is sanctified with his own
[1:49:58] blood
[1:49:59] for the purpose of manifesting himself
[1:50:01] making himself the same yesterday today
[1:50:04] and forever
[1:50:05] a little while and the world won't see
[1:50:08] any more now the world their spell is
[1:50:10] the greek word cosmos which means the
[1:50:12] world order see the world won't see me
[1:50:14] no more yet ye shall see me
[1:50:17] ye that's the believer the church for i
[1:50:20] will be with you even in you to the end
[1:50:24] of the world jesus christ the same
[1:50:26] yesterday today and forever do you
[1:50:29] believe it
[1:50:30] with these few promises that i've
[1:50:33] said to you tonight
[1:50:35] not because he dressed different not
[1:50:36] because he belonged to any clan not
[1:50:38] because he belonged to an organization
[1:50:40] there wasn't such a thing in them days
[1:50:43] that didn't make him jesus
[1:50:44] that didn't make him god
[1:50:46] but the works that he did
[1:50:48] prove that his commission that he said
[1:50:50] he would stand on was truth
[1:50:53] is that right
[1:50:55] well if he's the same yesterday and
[1:50:56] forever and promised the same work that
[1:50:58] he did the church would do
[1:51:00] don't you believe it if it doesn't then
[1:51:03] his words are true
[1:51:05] than if he done it to the samaritans but
[1:51:07] to the jews and promised it to the
[1:51:09] gentiles in the last day before the
[1:51:12] coming of the son of man
[1:51:14] oh what day we're living in brother
[1:51:17] we're here
[1:51:19] we're at the end time brother sister
[1:51:22] it's most any time it can happen
[1:51:24] remember when they turned it down
[1:51:27] you know what happened sodom burned
[1:51:30] the jews was destroyed
[1:51:33] and now we're at the gentile age of 2
[1:51:35] 000 years oh listen
[1:51:37] the prophet said
[1:51:38] there will be a day that will be dismal
[1:51:41] it can't be called night or day
[1:51:43] but in the evening time it shall be
[1:51:45] light
[1:51:46] is that right now the same sun rises in
[1:51:50] the east sets in the west
[1:51:52] the s-o-n who came in the east to
[1:51:56] eastern people and poured out the spirit
[1:51:58] upon them in the eastern we've had two
[1:52:00] thousand years of church organizations
[1:52:02] just a dismal day enough to see how to
[1:52:04] join the church and live a good life
[1:52:06] but at sunsetting time
[1:52:09] the same sun with the same thing that he
[1:52:11] had in the east shines it on the earth
[1:52:13] again in the west
[1:52:15] and we're on the west coast if we go any
[1:52:17] farther civilizations travel with the
[1:52:19] sun we'd be back east again so we're in
[1:52:22] the evening time with evening light with
[1:52:25] the same holy spirit that was on him is
[1:52:28] in the church doing the same things
[1:52:30] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:52:33] and forever that's our head
[1:52:35] gracious god
[1:52:39] one word from you will be more than any
[1:52:41] man could say in a lifetime
[1:52:44] we read that it's true oh god but the
[1:52:47] people are saying now let's see if it
[1:52:49] works
[1:52:51] certainly lord
[1:52:52] it's got to work
[1:52:54] it's got the zero to the target
[1:52:56] it's got to be so you promised it
[1:52:59] i pray that you'll manifest yourself
[1:53:01] tonight lord these people love you and
[1:53:03] they're sick
[1:53:04] this man sitting here holding this
[1:53:06] little waterhead baby
[1:53:08] this poor old dad sitting over here
[1:53:10] coughing
[1:53:11] this mother sitting in a wheelchair one
[1:53:13] earth of cane
[1:53:15] white in the hand
[1:53:17] oh god
[1:53:19] they cry past me not old gentle savior
[1:53:22] you're my humble cry
[1:53:25] while on others our calling do not pass
[1:53:28] me by
[1:53:29] for thou the stream of all my comfort
[1:53:32] more than life to me
[1:53:33] whom are thou on earth decide thee are
[1:53:36] whom in heaven but thee
[1:53:38] let it be known this night lord i have
[1:53:40] spoke of you i speak it i have told the
[1:53:42] truth father that will confirm the word
[1:53:44] and these people will believe and
[1:53:46] they'll be healed and go home happy and
[1:53:49] grant that there'll be a revival break
[1:53:50] out here in this city and literally
[1:53:52] thousands of souls will be won to christ
[1:53:54] and every church packed out new churches
[1:53:57] built it may be an example of people
[1:53:59] come from east and west to see the glory
[1:54:01] of god
[1:54:02] grant it lord we committed all in your
[1:54:04] hands now i am finished there's no more
[1:54:06] i can say it's up to you to speak now
[1:54:09] father because the people sees it's a
[1:54:11] promise just a few minutes here to
[1:54:13] lecture a little bit i trust that the
[1:54:15] holy spirit will take the word right
[1:54:17] down deep in their heart that they'll
[1:54:18] not fail to get it i pray in jesus name
[1:54:22] amen
[1:54:30] pardon my coughing i'm preaching all
[1:54:32] time i got just the preacher's throat
[1:54:34] and the other day i got real wet and
[1:54:36] kind of been a little hacky sensitive up
[1:54:38] there in
[1:54:39] in
[1:54:40] beaumont texas
[1:54:42] so now
[1:54:44] i
[1:54:44] i want you to remember now
[1:54:48] if we could see him tonight come and do
[1:54:50] just like he did then
[1:54:52] would we be like those who went home
[1:54:53] from emmaus
[1:54:55] they walked all day with him and didn't
[1:54:57] know it
[1:54:58] that night he act like it passed by he
[1:55:01] may act the same way to you now like
[1:55:02] he's going to pass by you
[1:55:04] you might not have a prayer card you
[1:55:06] might not even be in the line but he
[1:55:08] won't pass you
[1:55:09] just invite him to let me touch you lord
[1:55:12] see what he does
[1:55:13] oh he's not a challenge
[1:55:16] think of that
[1:55:19] it's more of a challenge than to walk
[1:55:21] down to this woman in a wheelchair and
[1:55:22] say and stand up and walk
[1:55:24] certainly she could actually do that
[1:55:26] through psychic power
[1:55:28] right mentally she could do it for
[1:55:30] christian science faith
[1:55:32] it's been done
[1:55:33] but when you see christ come into the
[1:55:36] people and do the same manifestation of
[1:55:38] the spine of heaven given back in
[1:55:41] fulfilling of the word
[1:55:43] what a miracle
[1:55:45] what a power
[1:55:46] anything here i am in this silly night
[1:55:49] there's not a soul here that i know it i
[1:55:51] can look at and see
[1:55:53] not but my tape boy sitting right here
[1:55:55] brother gold
[1:55:57] the only person i know
[1:55:59] god knows every one of you
[1:56:01] now
[1:56:02] i am not him
[1:56:05] he's hero
[1:56:07] and now we can't call all that prayer
[1:56:09] cards at one time
[1:56:11] and i just like them come just a few at
[1:56:13] a time
[1:56:14] as they call her awake and i'm sure he
[1:56:17] said he'd give out cards words bill
[1:56:20] where
[1:56:21] oh
[1:56:22] eight
[1:56:24] one two hundred
[1:56:26] all right
[1:56:28] let's begin at one number one man who
[1:56:30] has prayer card a number one i'll call
[1:56:32] them so we can pack those that's in the
[1:56:33] wheelchairs and get them not the bible
[1:56:35] the other night that both of them can't
[1:56:36] be right
[1:56:37] one's right and the other is wrong let
[1:56:39] the god of the bible speak
[1:56:44] south africa
[1:56:46] same way before about 250 000
[1:56:50] oh he's still god
[1:56:52] when the witch doctors
[1:56:54] just put the shame standing there
[1:56:57] the enemy the flight
[1:56:59] the next morning
[1:57:02] about seven or eight big van loads of
[1:57:04] just crutches and wheelchairs and planks
[1:57:06] that have been packed on was going down
[1:57:08] the street when sydney smith the mayor
[1:57:09] of durban called me said brother brown
[1:57:11] look out your window over towards the
[1:57:12] seacoast there come hundreds of people
[1:57:16] the day before was on crutches and
[1:57:18] wheelchairs with seven of them gripping
[1:57:20] african bands as long as them two posts
[1:57:22] together powell plum ha full of that
[1:57:25] coming with their hands up been at war
[1:57:27] with one other tribe walking the next
[1:57:29] day saying all things are possible only
[1:57:31] believe glory
[1:57:33] 25 000 healed at one time
[1:57:37] wow they wasn't all indoctrinated with
[1:57:40] everything they were virgin they heard
[1:57:42] the bible they believed it accepted it
[1:57:44] and it taken place
[1:57:47] i'll be a real reverend keep your seat
[1:57:49] be quiet
[1:57:50] i don't mean say you can't praise god
[1:57:52] but just keep quiet listen now
[1:57:58] now in the name of jesus christ the son
[1:58:01] of god i'll take every spirit in here
[1:58:04] under my control for the glory of god
[1:58:06] now be careful
[1:58:08] answer that
[1:58:10] now
[1:58:12] i guess that in this prayer line here
[1:58:15] every one of you are strangers to me is
[1:58:17] that right raise up your hand if your
[1:58:18] strangers raise up your hand
[1:58:20] i do not know you
[1:58:22] now if i could heal you and wouldn't do
[1:58:24] it i'd be a hypocrite
[1:58:26] but i can't do what god's already done
[1:58:29] i can only what if he was standing here
[1:58:30] tonight with this suit on it he gave me
[1:58:32] you say lord will you heal me you know
[1:58:34] what he'd say my child have already done
[1:58:36] that
[1:58:37] i can't do it twice i've just done it
[1:58:40] once
[1:58:41] as you must believe it but then he might
[1:58:43] show
[1:58:44] show you something to prove that he was
[1:58:46] the messiah
[1:58:47] now not the nail prince because anybody
[1:58:49] could have nail prints in their hands
[1:58:51] but he'd do the same sign that he did
[1:58:52] the first time
[1:58:53] as he promised he would do he'd never go
[1:58:55] beyond his promises what he promised
[1:58:57] he'll do now here's a woman
[1:59:01] you were strangers to one another all
[1:59:03] right
[1:59:04] you read my book
[1:59:05] she said she'd read my books and she
[1:59:07] thought she almost knowed me by reading
[1:59:09] my books
[1:59:10] all right then my sister
[1:59:13] i have a mother at home tonight
[1:59:16] he's praying for me
[1:59:19] i didn't come down here to be a defeat i
[1:59:21] come here to be a brother
[1:59:24] i didn't come to take the doctor's face
[1:59:26] i come to help his patients
[1:59:28] to get well
[1:59:30] i know never come representing any
[1:59:32] certain church just the lord jesus
[1:59:34] christ
[1:59:35] now this is the first time as far as i
[1:59:38] know we've ever met
[1:59:40] then
[1:59:41] if i would come you perhaps if you're in
[1:59:44] the prayer line you'd be sick and if i'd
[1:59:46] say i want to put my hands on you and
[1:59:48] say receive your healing in the name of
[1:59:49] the lord jesus go believe you'd have a
[1:59:51] right to do that that's true that's
[1:59:53] right but now what if he would come here
[1:59:57] and tell you something that you have
[1:59:58] done
[2:00:00] or like you did the woman at the well
[2:00:02] talked to her and revealed to her what
[2:00:04] what her trouble was
[2:00:06] then you'd know that it wasn't me
[2:00:08] wouldn't it because i don't know you
[2:00:10] i've never here's my hands i
[2:00:12] hold my hands to god over his bible i've
[2:00:14] never seen her in my life i know nothing
[2:00:15] about it
[2:00:16] and that's true i don't know one person
[2:00:18] in that prayer line or no who are out
[2:00:20] there as i can see but those that are
[2:00:21] called the name
[2:00:23] but now christ remains the same doesn't
[2:00:25] it
[2:00:26] now if he will if this woman
[2:00:29] let her be the judge
[2:00:31] if you all know her here at the church
[2:00:32] or wherever she's from
[2:00:34] if if she if he can tell her what she
[2:00:37] has been what something is wrong with
[2:00:38] her or what she share for it maybe
[2:00:40] domestic finance uh i don't know but if
[2:00:43] he can reveal that will that make him
[2:00:45] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:00:48] how many will believe that i'll raise up
[2:00:49] your answer i love him and believing
[2:00:51] thank you
[2:00:53] almost a hundred percent
[2:00:57] now if you do not believe it
[2:00:59] but be quiet because you know what
[2:01:02] happened
[2:01:03] lots of times
[2:01:04] afflictions goes from one to another
[2:01:06] it's got to find a place you remember in
[2:01:08] the bible
[2:01:09] then it'll go from one to another oh
[2:01:11] i've seen so much done like that so just
[2:01:14] as a brother i'll say if you don't
[2:01:15] believe it
[2:01:17] just set reverently and keep your head
[2:01:18] down so it's over
[2:01:20] now the words that i've spoke of jesus
[2:01:22] christ now has to be manifested or
[2:01:24] either i've told a liar his bible told
[2:01:27] something wrong
[2:01:29] now if anybody don't believe it wants to
[2:01:31] take my place you're welcome to come up
[2:01:33] here and take
[2:01:37] but as long as god made a promise he
[2:01:39] keeps his promise
[2:01:41] when the age of the lord met me up there
[2:01:43] 14 years ago and told me these things i
[2:01:45] was born to do and noted all my life and
[2:01:48] the baptist brethren tried to tell me it
[2:01:50] was the devil and everything
[2:01:52] they come to find out the very god of
[2:01:53] heaven trying to get to me i believed it
[2:01:56] ever since
[2:01:57] it's alarmed the world i've seen
[2:01:59] literally millions come to crime
[2:02:01] around the
[2:02:02] world now here it is in tucson for the
[2:02:05] first time here it is the bible here's
[2:02:07] the promise but will it work it'll work
[2:02:09] when he works
[2:02:11] that's all
[2:02:13] uh if the lord reveals to me what's
[2:02:15] wrong with the woman how many of us go
[2:02:17] to accept him as your healer
[2:02:20] you're with both of us with our hands up
[2:02:22] we've never met before in life you said
[2:02:24] she'd read my book so she has some idea
[2:02:27] of what would take place if he would do
[2:02:29] it now whether he will or not remember i
[2:02:31] don't know if he doesn't do it then i'll
[2:02:33] just simply go down the prayer line
[2:02:34] praying for the sick and let it go up
[2:02:36] fast that's all i could do but he's
[2:02:38] never failed me i don't believe he will
[2:02:40] tonight
[2:02:42] i want to talk to you just an adventure
[2:02:44] the first person all right our lord did
[2:02:46] the woman that so well he's trying to
[2:02:48] contact your spirit very beautiful to be
[2:02:50] a woman the first one in the prayer line
[2:02:52] just got through that of saint john 4.
[2:02:54] now
[2:02:55] i can just see him sitting there
[2:02:58] and see that woman come out to get what
[2:03:01] and he began to question me
[2:03:04] i believe now you know the lyric has to
[2:03:06] almost take my word for that i believe
[2:03:08] he is trying to contact her spirit the
[2:03:10] father had set him up there he had needs
[2:03:11] go by and he said he did nothing till
[2:03:14] the father showed him so the father had
[2:03:15] to show him first that's why he found
[2:03:17] out where her trouble was he told her
[2:03:19] what her trouble was and she said
[2:03:21] well that's the sign of the messiah
[2:03:24] i know when he comes he'll tell us all
[2:03:25] things so you must be a prophet
[2:03:27] he said i'm he
[2:03:29] and she went and told the city
[2:03:31] would that be your attitude towards it
[2:03:33] knowing it me being your brother and
[2:03:35] don't know you never seen me in my life
[2:03:38] we're born probably miles apart and
[2:03:40] years apart and here's our first time
[2:03:42] meeting and if he will reveal to me what
[2:03:44] your trouble is will you accept him as
[2:03:46] messiah you will you do
[2:03:55] the woman shattered to death
[2:03:57] the dark shadow hangs over
[2:04:00] and she's suffering with cancer
[2:04:04] that is right if that's right raise up
[2:04:06] your hand
[2:04:08] now do you believe it
[2:04:14] now i feel that coming to me again he
[2:04:17] guessed that don't think that you can't
[2:04:19] hide yourself now he's here
[2:04:22] already anointed now
[2:04:26] i never guessed that well wait a minute
[2:04:29] let's put a stop to that now
[2:04:31] you're fine person i don't know what he
[2:04:33] told you the only thing he told you i
[2:04:34] have to find on this paper and see what
[2:04:36] he said it's just like going back down
[2:04:38] to the stream of life somewhere inside
[2:04:40] y'all see it coming again
[2:04:42] yeah it's a shadow it's darkness it's a
[2:04:44] cancer
[2:04:45] now if i'll tell you where that cancer
[2:04:47] is would you believe me to be his
[2:04:49] prophet
[2:04:50] it's on both frets that's right raise up
[2:04:52] your hand
[2:04:54] another thing to that your doctor told
[2:04:56] you it's going into the spine also
[2:04:58] that's right working just fine faith
[2:05:03] if the lord jesus will
[2:05:05] tell me who you are
[2:05:06] without making the same god you could
[2:05:08] sit with that right
[2:05:10] miss hall

[2:05:13] you're from a coal country real coal is
[2:05:16] full of mountains is colorado that's
[2:05:17] thus stay at the lord do you breathe on
[2:05:20] him with all your heart return and be
[2:05:22] healed in the name of jesus christ and
[2:05:24] may his blessings and mercy dress up on
[2:05:26] you and give you the prayer
