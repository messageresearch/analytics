[21:50] blind but
[21:53] now I see let's bow our
[21:57] heads our heavenly
[21:59] father once again we thank you that we
[22:01] can open up this
[22:03] Bible and learn more about your word and
[22:07] therefore learn more about you Lord pray
[22:10] that wisdom would be here with us
[22:13] tonight as we open up This Book of
[22:16] Joel and father
[22:18] that if there' be a need in the church
[22:22] this evening or any of those that are
[22:23] streaming in father that you would meet
[22:25] that
[22:26] me most of all Lord we want your will
[22:29] not our will or the will of the world
[22:32] but your will Lord in Jesus name we pray
[22:36] amen amen you can be
[22:40] seated God bless you
[22:42] all it's good to see everyone out in the
[22:45] house of the Lord tonight Book of Joel
[22:47] is a um it's it's a really it's a great
[22:52] book it's an amazing book it's there's a
[22:54] lot of unknowns about Joel We don't know
[22:57] really we don't know When It Was Written
[23:00] because he doesn't name a
[23:01] king and we don't necessarily know if he
[23:05] was prophesying to the northern um tribe
[23:10] of uh of Israel the 10 tribes of Israel
[23:13] in the North or if he was uh prophesying
[23:16] to the southern tribes of Judah we don't
[23:20] we don't know the the um historic
[23:23] context of this but the Book of Joel is
[23:26] written to it doesn't really matter
[23:29] it does matter in in other books but the
[23:31] Book of Joel is a standalone book and
[23:35] it's um it's a book that's has a pretty
[23:40] amazing way that that we go through it
[23:43] and it's a book that has real life
[23:48] events that are
[23:49] happening and Joel and the Lord are
[23:53] taking these real life events that are
[23:56] happening and then they are used in a
[23:59] prophetic way saying that these times
[24:03] are coming into the
[24:05] future and so he's taking a a plague of
[24:08] locusts that comes through and just
[24:11] decimates the entire the entire land and
[24:15] he's saying that this is going to happen
[24:19] again in the future and he he uses it
[24:22] maybe as a as metaphorically speaking it
[24:25] happened actually and metaphorically
[24:27] speaking and prophetically speaking so
[24:29] as we dig into it in this book you'll
[24:32] see that the things that are happening
[24:35] right now in this book are a
[24:40] foreshadowing of things that are going
[24:42] to happen and then things that we are
[24:44] yet looking to see now the theme of The
[24:49] Book of
[24:50] Joel is the day of the Lord and you'll
[24:53] see that Joel mentions this multiple
[24:57] times through through the book and it's
[25:00] mentioned more actually by the prophet
[25:03] Joel than it is mentioned by any other
[25:05] prophet in the Bible so that's that's
[25:07] really the theme of The Book of Joel and
[25:11] what's what's going on is there's
[25:15] this as I said a plague of locust you
[25:17] know what a locust is it's like a
[25:19] grasshopper and in Northern Africa some
[25:23] they get big their uh their wingspan is
[25:26] is fairly big and they will um they
[25:29] could go for this this swarm of locust
[25:33] can go for tens of miles long and hund
[25:39] over a 100 feet tall so when this plague
[25:43] of locust comes over it will it'll block
[25:45] out the Sun and get dark and I'm I
[25:49] assume it's really a creepy thing when
[25:51] when they fly over and it's just
[25:53] absolutely devastating so we're going to
[25:57] be talking about this plague of locust
[25:59] that comes through and then Joel is
[26:01] going to be explaining the significance
[26:04] of this in the
[26:06] future so let's dig right into it let's
[26:09] dig into the The Book of Joel Joel
[26:11] chapter one and what we'll do is we'll
[26:13] read word by word at least for the first
[26:15] chapter maybe for the second chapter
[26:17] also and we'll see how time is going and
[26:20] then um we'll get through there's it's
[26:21] only three chapters we'll get through
[26:23] the third chapter and then I'd like to
[26:25] read um some things that brother brand
[26:28] said um about this Book of Joel at the
[26:32] end the word of the
[26:34] Lord that came to Joel the son of pul so
[26:38] now we know who wrote the Book of Joel
[26:41] and uh Joel is considered one of the
[26:44] minor prophets in the bible a minor
[26:47] prophet in the Bible just means that his
[26:50] book is
[26:51] shorter doesn't mean that he's any less
[26:54] than Isaiah or Jeremiah or Moses it just
[26:57] means that less is written from that
[27:01] Prophet so that's when we say a minor
[27:03] Prophet it's not in any way saying that
[27:05] this Prophet is less it's just saying
[27:07] that there's less that the prophet wrote
[27:10] In the book but this these prophecies
[27:13] that come from Joel
[27:16] are
[27:18] powerful amazing prophecies so in these
[27:22] three chapters is squeezed all kinds of
[27:26] great things
[27:29] hear this ye old men and give ear all ye
[27:32] inhabitants of the land hath this been
[27:34] in your days or even in the days of your
[27:37] fathers tell your children of it and let
[27:41] your children tell their children and
[27:43] their children tell another generation
[27:45] this right here is a tremendous verse
[27:48] and I love the way Joel just puts this
[27:49] right up in the front to tell your
[27:53] children and then your children will
[27:55] tell their children it's it's kind of
[27:57] like Joshua how Joshua told the stories
[28:01] that that happened with all the plagues
[28:03] that came on Israel and coming across
[28:05] the Jordan and he said now you tell your
[28:07] children and then you bring them back to
[28:10] some of these these things that we have
[28:11] set up and when they ask like this pile
[28:14] of stones where did this pile of stones
[28:16] come from what is this pile of stones
[28:18] then you can tell them how the children
[28:20] of Israel walked over walked through the
[28:24] the walked over the Jordan River on dry
[28:26] land and this
[28:29] what the what this Prophet Joel is
[28:31] saying here he's he's saying tell your
[28:34] children of what's going on right now
[28:37] and basically tell them what I'm
[28:38] saying and you know if you come
[28:43] especially on Wednesday nights and
[28:45] Sunday nights I'll give a lot of
[28:47] testimonies from my family about brother
[28:50] Brandon and about all the amazing things
[28:53] that happened in his ministry and really
[28:56] this is what I am doing
[28:58] is telling the people that these things
[29:02] actually happened I wasn't there but my
[29:07] parents told me and my parents were
[29:09] there and my parents saw these things
[29:12] but they did exactly what this Prophet
[29:14] Joel is saying tell your children about
[29:17] these things that happened they really
[29:18] did happen and then I tell my children
[29:21] and I tell you all and encourage you you
[29:24] tell your children that these things
[29:27] that many of my parents my grandparents
[29:31] and many of all of our parents and
[29:33] grandparents witnessed they happened and
[29:36] they were real and you can go back to
[29:39] those and you can draw strength from
[29:41] those knowing that God manifested
[29:44] himself in a mighty way back then and we
[29:47] can apply that to our own lives and
[29:50] Joel's here he's saying listen tell your
[29:53] children about these things that are
[29:55] happening that you're witnessing these
[29:57] great calamities and then have them tell
[30:00] their children then he says
[30:03] this that which the Palmer worm hath
[30:06] left the Locust eaten and that which the
[30:09] Locust hath left hath the cankerworm
[30:12] eaten and that which the cankerworm hath
[30:15] left the caterpillar
[30:19] eaten so we have this plague of Lo
[30:21] locust come
[30:23] through and he's describing it and he
[30:26] uses these words let me read another
[30:28] translation keep that one up there and
[30:31] it says this listen to this this is the
[30:32] English Standard
[30:34] Version what the cutting Locust left the
[30:37] swarming Locust has eaten what the
[30:40] swarming Locust left the hopping Locust
[30:44] has eaten and what the hopping Locust
[30:47] left the destroying Locust has
[30:51] eaten all of these the cankerworm and
[30:54] the Palmer worm and the Locust they are
[30:56] all the same
[30:58] bug they're the same grasshopper they
[31:02] are just at different levels of their
[31:06] maturity so when he's saying this he's
[31:08] saying that all of these things have
[31:11] come through they have have have grown
[31:14] up and each one of them does its own
[31:16] type of damage but it's the same little
[31:20] animal that's doing
[31:21] it a wakey drunkards now he's going to
[31:24] he's going to say now you've seen this
[31:26] this plague of locust come through you
[31:28] need to repent because God is in this
[31:31] and we know that from the prophets and
[31:33] we're starting into brother Lyall went
[31:35] into Hosea last week and you'll see a
[31:38] theme actually we've seen it through the
[31:39] whole Bible the prophet the people will
[31:42] sin the prophet will bring correction
[31:45] and then God's mercy will be manifested
[31:48] it's almost in every book and this one's
[31:50] no
[31:51] different awake ye drunkard and weep and
[31:54] howl all ye drinkers of wine because of
[31:56] the new wine for it is cut off from your
[31:59] mouth for nation is come up upon my land
[32:02] strong and without number whose teeth
[32:05] are the teeth of the
[32:06] lion and he hath the cheek teeth of a
[32:10] great
[32:11] lion so the locusts come in but now it
[32:16] looks like a foreign Nation so we we see
[32:20] the plague of the Locust and now it
[32:22] looks like these locusts now represent a
[32:24] foreign Nation invading Israel
[32:28] now this could be as I said we don't
[32:30] know we can't really Place This Book of
[32:32] Joel in historic context we don't know
[32:35] exactly when it was this could be this
[32:38] Assyrian evasion Invasion that uh they
[32:41] took the C the captives in the northern
[32:43] part of
[32:45] Israel possibly it could be the
[32:48] Babylonian Invasion that we've gone
[32:50] through with the Book of Daniel and
[32:51] Jeremiah and
[32:53] Ezekiel and it could be another Invasion
[32:55] we don't know but it's showing here that
[33:00] this is an invasion coming from another
[33:02] country also and we'll see that it's
[33:04] proven a little bit later he hath laid
[33:07] my Vine
[33:09] waste and barked my fig tree he hath
[33:12] made it clean clean bear and cast it
[33:16] away the branches thereof are made white
[33:19] so we know first of all we know that
[33:21] this fig tree usually when a fig tree is
[33:23] mentioned in a symbolic way it
[33:25] represents the country of Israel
[33:28] so we we know that this this plague of
[33:32] locust that's coming on and as I said it
[33:34] could be hundreds of feet high and it
[33:36] could be tens of miles long and they
[33:39] come in so thick that they can black out
[33:41] the Sun and they just they eat
[33:44] everything
[33:46] and the the plagues that that he's
[33:50] describing happened it's happening
[33:53] against Israel now for their sins but do
[33:56] you remember it happened happened
[33:58] against
[34:00] Egypt years and years ago with one of
[34:03] the plagues I believe it's the E eth
[34:05] plague that came from God to on the
[34:09] Egyptians when Pharaoh's heart was
[34:11] hardened and he wouldn't allow the
[34:13] Hebrews to go and worship so God brought
[34:17] down these 10 plagues and brought
[34:18] pharaoh to his knees one of those
[34:20] plagues was
[34:23] locusts and now these this same plague
[34:27] is coming coming upon Israel for their
[34:31] Disobedience and he says this lament
[34:33] Like a Virgin girded with sackcloth for
[34:35] the husband of her youth the meat
[34:37] offering and the drink offering is cut
[34:39] off from the house of the Lord the
[34:41] priests the Lord's ministers mourn so we
[34:44] look and he's telling the ministers he
[34:46] your pastors and your ministers you
[34:48] repent and you
[34:50] pray the field is wasted and the land
[34:53] mourneth for the corn is wasted and the
[34:55] new wine is dried up the oil Land
[34:57] languishes languisheth
[34:59] so this is what happened when this
[35:03] plague of locust come through they they
[35:07] eat up everything so now there's no food
[35:12] let's say they eat up the wheat and and
[35:13] the the wheat's ready to harvest they
[35:15] they come through they they eat up all
[35:18] the the food they eat even the bark off
[35:21] the trees it says they eat the fruit off
[35:23] the trees they eat the grain everything
[35:27] is destroyed when this plague of locust
[35:30] come through so then what
[35:32] follows
[35:35] this a
[35:37] famine because there's no food to eat
[35:40] and if the rain and if there isn't rain
[35:42] late in the
[35:44] season then they're also going to
[35:46] probably be suffering the next year
[35:48] because their trees are destroyed so
[35:51] they want this rain to
[35:53] come and they don't have any food now
[35:58] so they're not going to have any food
[36:00] until they can regrow some crops and
[36:02] it's probably going to be a year so
[36:05] things are going to be really really
[36:07] hard starvation and these plagues of
[36:10] locust it doesn't just take the food
[36:12] right now it makes it to where you don't
[36:13] have any food for until the next Harvest
[36:17] so very very devastating thing this
[36:19] plague of locust I was um when I was in
[36:23] Jeffersonville we were working with u a
[36:26] group in Loi there was a typhoon that
[36:29] came through and just destroyed the
[36:32] country flooded the country flooded
[36:35] their crops so we had all of this
[36:38] runoff and all the corn and stuff that
[36:41] was planted it all got washed down so
[36:45] now they had
[36:48] nothing and they didn't have the hope of
[36:50] having anything because it wasn't time
[36:53] to plant the crops and they wouldn't
[36:54] grow until they planted them the next
[36:56] spring so that's when we were able to
[37:00] bring in food that they could eat to get
[37:02] them through until they could plant the
[37:05] crops and and get something the next
[37:07] year but a plague like this the plague
[37:11] of locust is like this this typhoon that
[37:13] came through it just
[37:14] destroys and that's kind of the key word
[37:17] it's a destroying
[37:19] thing be ashamed oh ye husband and how
[37:23] oh ye Vine dressers for the wheat and
[37:26] for the barley because the Harvest of
[37:28] the field is perished so everything's
[37:31] gone all their food is gone the vine is
[37:33] dried up the Fig Tree languisheth the
[37:36] pomegranate tree the palm tree also and
[37:38] the apple tree even all the trees of the
[37:40] field are withered because the joy is
[37:42] withered away from the sons of
[37:45] men I'm going to read some quotes at the
[37:48] end of service if we have time that will
[37:53] be um very applicable to that
[37:56] scripture good G yourself and lament ye
[37:59] priests howl ye Ministers of the altar
[38:02] come lie all night in sackcloth you
[38:04] Ministers of my God for the meat
[38:06] offering and the drink offering is
[38:08] withholdeth withholden from then from
[38:10] the house of your God sanctify ye a fast
[38:14] call a solemn assembly gather the elders
[38:17] and all the inhabitants of the land into
[38:19] the house of the Lord your God and cry
[38:22] unto the Lord so the prophet is crying
[38:24] out to the ministry and to the
[38:25] population of people to repent repent
[38:28] and to make a holy fast to gather the
[38:30] people together and cry unto the Lord
[38:33] because this is your only hope you don't
[38:35] have any food you need a miracle you
[38:38] need the Lord to come down and protect
[38:40] you like what we're praying for for this
[38:43] um for this state of of Florida right
[38:46] now and this hurricane that's bearing
[38:48] down only God can protect it and only
[38:52] God can allow it to be to to just
[38:55] destroy it's up to him man man does not
[38:58] have that power and here he is he's
[39:00] saying that the only thing that you
[39:02] have is you cry out to God and repent
[39:06] because he
[39:08] can
[39:10] alas for the day for the day of the Lord
[39:14] is at hand and as destruction from the
[39:17] almighty shall it
[39:19] come as I said the day of the Lord
[39:22] that's the theme of This Book of Joel
[39:25] It's mentioned multiple times and
[39:28] the the day of the
[39:30] Lord is something that it can be
[39:33] something that's great or it can be
[39:36] something that's terrifying and horrible
[39:40] and really it depends on which side
[39:42] you're
[39:43] on the day of the Lord came from no for
[39:46] Noah he had built this Ark it started to
[39:50] rain the water came up out of the
[39:52] ground that was a day that was the day
[39:56] of the Lord that came for Noah no Noah
[39:58] was saved and it was a wonderful day for
[40:01] Noah because he was safe and he saw the
[40:03] power of God and all the evil that
[40:05] surrounded him was destroyed but it was
[40:08] a horrible day for those Sinners that
[40:13] weren't on God's
[40:14] side it's the same thing with Moses the
[40:17] day of the Lord came from Moses came
[40:19] from Egypt and it comes and and here is
[40:22] here comes all the plagues and it was
[40:24] terrible for Pharaoh but it was
[40:26] wonderful
[40:27] for the Hebrews and they saw the power
[40:30] of God they saw hail come down like fire
[40:32] they saw the the Locust they saw
[40:34] Darkness they saw all of these great
[40:36] things and God protected them but he
[40:41] destroyed those that didn't serve
[40:43] God so we see the day of the Lord It's a
[40:47] wonderful thing and it is a terrible
[40:50] thing and it really depends on which
[40:52] side that you're
[40:55] on Jesus or Paul said in first
[40:57] Thessalonians he prophesied that the day
[40:59] of the Lord would come as a thief of in
[41:01] the
[41:02] night we look forward to that day we're
[41:07] praying Lord come Lord come quickly we
[41:10] want to see you we want to we want you
[41:12] to come and redeem this world and then
[41:14] there's others that if the Lord comes
[41:17] they would be cast out into Everlasting
[41:18] Darkness into the Lake of
[41:21] Fire it's a horrible thing there and
[41:24] it's a wonderful thing here
[41:27] is not the meat cut off before our eyes
[41:30] the food yay joy and gladness from the
[41:34] house of our God the seed is rotten
[41:37] under their clouds and the Garner lay
[41:39] desolate the barns are broken down for
[41:41] the corn is withered how do the beasts
[41:44] Gran the herds of cattle are per
[41:47] perplexed because they have no pasture
[41:49] ye the flocks of sheep are made
[41:52] desolate so not only are the people
[41:54] suffering and we think about us it's
[41:56] like oh the the Locust came in and ate
[41:59] my fig tree or they ate my crops but
[42:03] don't forget if you're a
[42:04] Rancher you don't
[42:06] have food you don't have grass to feed
[42:09] your cattle or to feed your sheep so
[42:14] you're so these sheep and these cattle
[42:16] they're going to die too because these
[42:17] locusts came in this famine is coming
[42:20] down because all the food is gone and it
[42:24] has a residual effect all the way
[42:26] through
[42:30] oh Lord to thee will I cry for the fire
[42:34] hath devoured the pastures of the
[42:36] Wilderness and the flame ha burned all
[42:38] the trees of the field the beasts of the
[42:40] field cry also unto thee for the rivers
[42:42] of water are dried up and the fire ha
[42:44] devoured the pastures of the
[42:49] Wilderness chapter
[42:52] 2 blow ye the trumpet in Zion and S
[42:57] sound an alarm in my Holy Mountain let
[42:59] all the inhabitants of the land tremble
[43:01] for the day of the Lord
[43:03] cometh for it is nigh at
[43:06] hand and you can see it was a it was a
[43:09] dire need the day of the Lord was there
[43:12] for them remember it's
[43:15] twofold he's saying that this is what's
[43:17] happening right
[43:19] now and he's going to say that it's also
[43:23] going to happen in the future and it's
[43:24] going to be way worse than staring to
[43:27] death because of a
[43:30] famine a day of darkness and gloominess
[43:34] a day of clouds and a thick Darkness as
[43:36] the morning spread upon the mountains a
[43:38] great people and strong there ha there
[43:42] hath not been ever ever the like neither
[43:44] shall anym after it even to the years of
[43:48] many
[43:50] generations so he's he's foreshadowing
[43:52] yeah you're seeing this but there is
[43:54] something big that's coming let's turn
[43:57] to Matthew chapter
[43:59] 24 and here the Lord Jesus actually
[44:02] refers back to
[44:06] Joel
[44:08] Same Spirit as the Lord Jesus is
[44:11] prophesying Matthew 24 let's start with
[44:14] verse
[44:15] three now we know that this is the
[44:18] Tribulation
[44:19] time this is a hard time that the Lord
[44:22] Jesus is prophesying that's
[44:24] coming it's the six seals
[44:27] that are in this Matthew 24 it's the
[44:30] tribulation it's the plagues there's all
[44:32] kinds of Calamity that's happening here
[44:35] and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives
[44:37] speaking of the Lord Jesus the disciples
[44:39] came to him privately saying tell us
[44:42] when shall these things be and what
[44:44] shall be the sign of thy coming and of
[44:46] the end of the world and Jesus answered
[44:48] and said unto him take heed that no man
[44:51] deceive
[44:52] you a Commandment that is constantly
[44:57] told be careful don't be
[45:04] deceived for many shall come in my name
[45:07] saying I am the Christ many shall come
[45:09] in my name what is that I come in the
[45:11] name of Jesus Christ is what they would
[45:13] say it's easy to say that but are you
[45:16] really sent from God he's saying that
[45:19] these false prophets will come take heed
[45:21] that no man de deceive you for many
[45:23] shall come in my name saying I am the
[45:24] Christ and shall deceive many and ye
[45:26] shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[45:29] see that ye be not troubled for all
[45:31] these things must come to pass but the
[45:33] end is not yet for nation shall rise
[45:35] against nation and Kingdom against
[45:37] Kingdom and there shall be famines and
[45:39] pestilence and earthquakes in diverse
[45:42] places all these are the beginning of
[45:45] Sorrows this is just the beginning of
[45:49] it then shall they deliver you up to be
[45:51] afflicted and shall kill you and you
[45:53] should be hated of all Nations for my
[45:55] name's sake and then shall many be
[45:58] offended and shall betray one another
[46:00] and shall hate one another one of the
[46:02] signs of the end is this great
[46:04] Discord especially among the religious
[46:08] churches especially among the religious
[46:10] people there's this bickering and this
[46:12] fighting and it's a sign right here
[46:14] Jesus says it's coming and many false
[46:16] prophets shall arise and deceive
[46:19] many and because iniquity shall abound
[46:21] the love of many shall wax cold
[46:27] but he that shall endure to the end the
[46:29] same shall be saved trust in the Lord
[46:33] endure keep your testimony keep trusting
[46:36] in God and this Gospel of the Kingdom
[46:38] shall be preached in all the world for a
[46:40] witness unto all nations and then shall
[46:43] the End
[46:44] come skip to verse
[46:47] 29
[46:49] immediately after the tribulation of
[46:51] those days shall the sun be
[46:54] darkened and the moon shall not shall
[46:56] not give her light and the Stars shall
[46:58] fall from Heaven and all the powers and
[47:00] the powers of of the heavens shall be
[47:02] shaken and then shall appear the sign of
[47:05] the son of man in heaven and then shall
[47:07] all the tribes of the earth mourn and
[47:09] they shall see the son of man coming in
[47:11] the Clouds Of Heaven with power and
[47:14] great
[47:15] Glory it's like in the Book of Joel
[47:17] there was a time of tribulation but
[47:19] there's always hope God always gives you
[47:23] a way out he always gives you hope and
[47:28] he will always make a way for those that
[47:30] truly love him and those that put him
[47:34] first and he shall send his angels with
[47:36] a great sound of a trumpet and they
[47:39] shall gather together his elect from the
[47:41] Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the
[47:43] other now learn a parable of the Fig
[47:45] Tree we know what the Fig Tree is as I
[47:47] said before when his branch is yet
[47:49] tender and putteth forth leaves you know
[47:53] that summer is
[47:54] nigh then the last verse 44 says this
[47:58] therefore be ye also ready for in such
[48:00] an hour as you think not the son of man
[48:03] cometh now with that Prophecy from the
[48:07] Lord Jesus that Spirit let's go back to
[48:11] Joel chapter 2 verse
[48:14] three a fire
[48:17] devoureth before them and behind them a
[48:20] flame burneth and the land is as a
[48:22] Garden of Eden before them and behind
[48:24] them a desolate Wilderness yay and
[48:27] nothing shall Escape them the appearance
[48:30] of them is the as the appearance of
[48:32] horses now he's talking about these
[48:33] locusts the appearance of them is as the
[48:36] appearance of horses and of Horsemen and
[48:38] they shall
[48:40] run let's turn to Revelation chapter
[48:46] n
[48:47] again this is one of those things where
[48:50] this is an application to the
[48:54] Future Revelation verse chapter 9 ver
[48:56] verse one and the fifth angel
[49:00] sounded and I saw a star fall from
[49:02] Heaven under the Earth and to him was
[49:04] given the key of the bottomless
[49:06] pit and he opened the bottomless pit and
[49:09] there arose a smoke out of the pit as
[49:12] the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun
[49:14] and the air were darkened by reason of
[49:16] the smoke of a pit and there came out of
[49:19] the smoke
[49:21] locusts upon the Earth and unto them was
[49:23] given power as the Scorpions of the
[49:26] Earth have power and it was commanded to
[49:28] them that they should not hurt the grass
[49:31] of the earth neither any green thing
[49:33] neither any tree but only those men
[49:36] which have not the Seal of God in their
[49:39] foreheads that seal of God is nothing
[49:42] short of the Holy
[49:44] Spirit and to them it was given that
[49:48] they should not kill them but that they
[49:50] should be tormented five months and
[49:51] their torment was as the torment of a
[49:54] scorpion when he striketh a man and in
[49:56] those days shall men seek death and
[49:59] shall not find it and shall desire to
[50:02] die and Death Shall flee from them and
[50:05] the shapes of the Locust were like under
[50:07] horses prepared under battle remember I
[50:09] just read in Joel and the shapes of the
[50:12] Locust were like un horses prepared
[50:15] under battle and on their heads were as
[50:17] it were crowns like gold and their faces
[50:19] were as the faces of men and their hair
[50:22] as the hair of women and their teeth as
[50:24] the teeth of lions
[50:27] and they had breastplates as it were
[50:29] breastplates of iron and the sound of
[50:30] their wings was as a sound of Chariots
[50:33] of many horses running to battle and
[50:36] they had tails like unto scorpions and
[50:39] there were stings in their
[50:41] tails and their power was to hurt men
[50:44] five
[50:45] months and they had a king over them
[50:47] which is the Angel of the bottomless pit
[50:50] whose name in the Hebrew tongue is aaden
[50:53] but in the Greek tongue hath his name
[50:58] apalon one woe is passed and behold
[51:01] there come two woes more Hereafter very
[51:05] similar to what we're reading right now
[51:08] in the Book of Joel back to Joel chapter
[51:10] 2 verse
[51:12] 5 like the noise of Chariots on the tops
[51:15] of mountains shall they leap like the
[51:17] noise of a flame of fire that devoureth
[51:19] the stubble as strong people set in
[51:22] battle array before their face the
[51:24] people shall be much pained all their
[51:27] faces Shall Gather
[51:28] Blackness they shall run like Mighty Men
[51:31] they shall climb a wall like the men of
[51:33] war and they shall March everyone on his
[51:35] ways and they shall not break their
[51:37] ranks neither shall one thrust another
[51:41] they shall walk everyone in his path and
[51:44] when they fall upon the sword they shall
[51:46] not be wounded they shall run to and fro
[51:49] in the city and they shall run upon the
[51:51] wall and they shall climb up upon the
[51:53] houses and they shall enter in at the
[51:55] Windows like a thief
[51:58] the Earth shall Quake before them and
[52:00] the heavens shall tremble and the sun
[52:02] and the moon shall be dark and the Stars
[52:05] shall withdraw their shining remember
[52:07] back to what Jesus said in Matthew
[52:09] chapter 24 Matthew 24 and the Lord shall
[52:13] utter his voice before his army for his
[52:15] Camp is very great for he is strong that
[52:18] executed the word for the day of the
[52:20] Lord is great and very terrible and who
[52:24] can abide it so now God's sending in his
[52:28] power to counter this other power that's
[52:32] coming another translation in verse 11
[52:35] says this the Lord utters his voice
[52:37] before his army for his Camp is
[52:40] exceedingly great he who executes his
[52:43] word is powerful for the day of the Lord
[52:46] is great and very awesome and who can
[52:49] endure
[52:51] it therefore now therefore also now
[52:54] sayeth the Lord turn ye even to me with
[52:57] all your heart and with fasting and with
[52:59] weeping and with mourning a common theme
[53:02] as I've said before turn to the Lord
[53:07] repent and Rend your heart and not your
[53:10] garments and turn unto the Lord your God
[53:13] for he is gracious and merciful and slow
[53:15] to anger and of great kindness and
[53:18] repenteth him of the evil so he's saying
[53:21] don't take the traditional thing of
[53:23] tearing open your garment
[53:26] he's telling them to tear open your
[53:28] heart
[53:30] instead don't just go through the
[53:32] motions don't just make it look like
[53:35] here I'm repenting really repent get
[53:39] down on your knees and cry out to God
[53:42] and then a promise right here as always
[53:44] God will forgive you God will take care
[53:47] of it who knoweth if he will return and
[53:50] repent and leave a blessing behind him
[53:52] even a meat offering and a drink
[53:54] offering unto the Lord your God blow the
[53:57] trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast call a
[53:59] solemn assembly gather the people
[54:01] sanctify the congregation assemble the
[54:03] other Elders gather the children and
[54:05] those that suck the breast let the
[54:07] bridegroom go forth of his chamber and
[54:09] the bride out of her closet so Joel is
[54:12] saying bring everybody bring the babies
[54:16] you just got married skip the honeymoon
[54:19] come
[54:20] down everybody come everybody come in
[54:27] let the priests the Ministers of the
[54:29] Lord weep between the porch and the
[54:31] Altar and let them say spare thy people
[54:34] oh Lord and give not thine Heritage to
[54:37] rep to reproach that the Heathen should
[54:40] rule over them wherefore should they say
[54:42] among the people where is their
[54:44] God then will the Lord be jealous for
[54:47] his land and pity his
[54:50] people yay the Lord will answer and say
[54:53] unto his
[54:54] people and remember here we go we're
[54:57] going to start getting into the
[54:59] prophetic yay the Lord will answer and
[55:02] say unto his people behold I will send
[55:04] you corn and wine and
[55:07] oil and ye shall be satisfied therewith
[55:11] and I will no more make you or reproach
[55:14] among the Heathen so he saying humble
[55:16] yourself whether there's famine that was
[55:19] on Israel at this time or in a future
[55:22] time humble yourself before the Lord and
[55:24] I'll take care of it with me all things
[55:26] are possible but I will remove far off
[55:30] from you the northern Army and will
[55:32] drive him into a land Barren and
[55:34] desolate with his face towards the E
[55:37] East and his hinder part towards the
[55:39] utmost sea and his stink shall come up
[55:42] come up and his ill saver shall come up
[55:46] because he hath done great things fear
[55:48] not Oh Land be glad and rejoice for the
[55:52] Lord will do great
[55:53] things be not afraid
[55:57] believe Stephanie I were talking the
[55:58] other night I believe that's the most
[56:00] common commandment in the Bible don't
[56:03] fear not don't be afraid be Not Afraid
[56:06] ye Beasts of the field for the pasture
[56:08] of the Wilderness do spring for the tree
[56:11] beareth her fruit and the Fig Tree and
[56:12] the vine yield their strength be glad
[56:15] you children of Zion and rejoice in the
[56:18] Lord for for you for your God rejoice in
[56:21] the Lord your God for he hath given you
[56:23] the former Reign moderately
[56:26] for he will cause to come down for you
[56:29] the rain the former rain and the latter
[56:32] rain prophet of
[56:34] Joel is
[56:36] referring to that when you sew the seed
[56:40] so when you have a field and a
[56:42] husbandman by the way is the King James
[56:46] version of the a farmer the one that
[56:49] that owns that takes care of the field
[56:51] so when this farmer goes and he SWS the
[56:55] seeds
[56:57] you need rain you need some sort of
[56:59] moisture to fall on that that's the
[57:02] former rain that's the first rain that
[57:04] you need and then that that seed is
[57:06] germinated in the ground it takes root
[57:09] and then your crop starts to grow and
[57:11] then it grows through the summer and
[57:13] then towards the fall at the end of the
[57:15] of the Harvest when the Harvest is
[57:17] coming you need another rain to really
[57:20] ripen that fruit and to make sure you
[57:22] get the best fruit before you you pick
[57:24] it you need some rain in there that's
[57:27] the latter rain so you have the rain
[57:31] that falls
[57:32] first and then you have the latter rain
[57:36] that really ripens that
[57:38] fruit James
[57:41] 5:7 says be patient
[57:44] therefore Brethren unto the coming of
[57:47] the Lord behold the husbandman the
[57:49] husbandman remember that's the farmer
[57:52] the husbandman waiteth for the precious
[57:54] fruit of the earth and hath long
[57:56] patience for it until he receives the
[57:59] early and the latter
[58:01] rain so be also be also patient
[58:05] establish your hearts for the coming of
[58:07] the Lord draweth nigh so we plant the
[58:10] seed the Lord sends the rain to
[58:12] germinate that seed and then he sends
[58:14] the rain to ripen the Harvest the former
[58:17] and the latter
[58:19] rain and the floors back to Book of Joel
[58:24] verse number 24 and the the floors shall
[58:26] be full of Wheat and the Vats shall
[58:28] overflow with wine and oil so this is a
[58:30] time of prosperity and I will restore to
[58:33] you the
[58:34] years that the Locust hath eaten and the
[58:37] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[58:40] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[58:43] among you so again back to that
[58:46] same Locust at different stages and God
[58:49] is saying that he's going to restore
[58:51] what was lost during that time and you
[58:55] shall eat plenty
[58:56] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[58:58] the Lord your God that hath dealt
[59:01] wondrously with you and my people shall
[59:03] never be
[59:05] ashamed my people shall never be put to
[59:09] shame and ye shall know that I am in the
[59:13] midst of Israel and that I am the Lord
[59:15] your God and none else and my people
[59:18] shall never be ashamed now a prophecy
[59:22] that we are all very familiar with
[59:26] and it shall come to
[59:28] pass
[59:30] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[59:32] upon All
[59:33] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[59:36] shall prophesy and your old men shall
[59:39] dream dreams and your young men shall
[59:41] see visions and also upon the servants
[59:43] and upon the handmaids in those days
[59:45] will I pour out my
[59:47] spirit one of the greatest days in
[59:49] history is what this is
[59:51] prophesying and I will show wonders in
[59:53] the heavens and in the earth and blood
[59:55] and fire and pillars of smoke and the
[59:57] sun shall be turned into darkness and
[59:59] the moon into blood before the great and
[1:00:01] terrible day of the Lord come and it
[1:00:03] shall come to pass that who whosoever
[1:00:05] shall call upon the name of the Lord
[1:00:08] shall be
[1:00:09] delivered for in Mount Zion and in
[1:00:12] Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the
[1:00:14] Lord hath said and in the remnant of
[1:00:17] whom and in the remnant whom the Lord
[1:00:20] shall
[1:00:22] call now let's fast forward about who
[1:00:25] knows it could be 400 years it could be
[1:00:28] 800 years but let's fast forward from
[1:00:30] that time to Acts chapter
[1:00:34] 2 we saw in the book of Acts that the
[1:00:38] Lord Jesus had promised that if I go
[1:00:41] away then the comforter will return so
[1:00:45] here they are they're in this Upper Room
[1:00:47] 120 people in this upper room and they
[1:00:50] knew this promise Jesus said just to
[1:00:52] wait there until you are endued with
[1:00:54] power from up on high and here they are
[1:00:57] and then here comes the Holy Spirit into
[1:01:01] the building like sounds like a rushing
[1:01:03] Mighty Wind there was tongues of fire on
[1:01:06] each of them they go out they're filled
[1:01:09] with the Holy Ghost they go out they
[1:01:11] start prophesying they start speaking in
[1:01:12] other tongues they start doing Miracles
[1:01:15] this great thing
[1:01:18] happened and then other people see it
[1:01:22] they're like we want that
[1:01:27] and that's how we should be as
[1:01:28] Christians friends let me tell you
[1:01:30] wherever we go whatever we do if the
[1:01:33] people that that you work with if the
[1:01:35] people that you see if the people are
[1:01:37] not uh taking you in in high regard and
[1:01:42] saying I want what that person has then
[1:01:45] we are doing something
[1:01:47] wrong and let me tell you the most
[1:01:49] important thing is that love 1
[1:01:52] Corinthians chapter 13 when we lose that
[1:01:55] love
[1:01:57] then we lose the admiration of the world
[1:02:00] here in the book of Acts chapter 2 they
[1:02:03] wanted their hearts were
[1:02:05] cut and they said what do we need to
[1:02:08] do but Peter lifting up but Peter
[1:02:11] standing up and they and some were
[1:02:12] making fun of them they're saying oh
[1:02:15] they're
[1:02:16] drunk you know it's the the third hour
[1:02:19] of the day or whatever it was and
[1:02:21] they're they're already drinking and
[1:02:22] they're drunk and they're stumbling
[1:02:23] around they're doing all this strange
[1:02:24] strange stuff and Peter standing up with
[1:02:27] the
[1:02:28] 11 lifted up his voice and said unto
[1:02:31] them you mean of Jud you Judea and all
[1:02:33] that dwell at Jerusalem be this known
[1:02:35] unto you and hearken unto my words for
[1:02:38] these are not drunken as you suppose
[1:02:40] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[1:02:42] day what is that brother L is that 9:00
[1:02:43] in the
[1:02:44] morning thing this seeing this is but
[1:02:47] the third hour of the day but this is
[1:02:49] that which was spoken of by the prophet
[1:02:53] Joel Peter knew the scriptures
[1:02:56] he had read this book that we're reading
[1:02:58] tonight and he says that's it this is
[1:03:01] the Fulfillment of that
[1:03:05] scripture and it and then now Peter goes
[1:03:08] back and he quotes this Prophet it shall
[1:03:11] come to pass in the last days saith God
[1:03:13] that I will pour out my spirit upon All
[1:03:15] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[1:03:16] shall prophesy and your young men shall
[1:03:18] see visions and your old men shall dream
[1:03:20] dream dreams and on my servants and upon
[1:03:22] my handmaids will I pour out in those
[1:03:25] days of my spirit and they shall
[1:03:27] prophesy it had just happened that is so
[1:03:30] awesome to
[1:03:31] me that this prophecy was sitting in the
[1:03:35] book for hundreds of
[1:03:37] years just there how many priests how
[1:03:42] many rabbis read that and had no idea
[1:03:45] what it
[1:03:46] means and that's brothers and sisters we
[1:03:49] have we have to be careful in doing that
[1:03:51] we can hear a
[1:03:54] prophecy but
[1:03:56] really we don't know what any prophecy
[1:04:00] is until it happens the interpretation
[1:04:03] of a prophecy is the Fulfillment of the
[1:04:07] prophecy and that is what happened right
[1:04:09] here with Peter he remembered these
[1:04:12] words of Joel and he says this is that
[1:04:14] which was spoken of by the prophet Joel
[1:04:17] where was I Verse 18 and on my servants
[1:04:20] and upon my handmaids will I pour out in
[1:04:22] those days of my spirit and they shall
[1:04:24] prophesy so it is a just that Holy
[1:04:26] Spirit had just come they go out and
[1:04:28] they're stumbling
[1:04:29] around and they're speaking in these
[1:04:32] strange tongues and it's it's it's um
[1:04:36] recognizable to the different ones that
[1:04:38] are there and they're like wow they're
[1:04:39] speaking my
[1:04:41] language and there there there's these
[1:04:44] great things going on and Peter's like
[1:04:47] yeah this is that and he comes and he's
[1:04:49] preaching this sermon and I will show
[1:04:51] wonders in
[1:04:53] heaven and signs on in the Earth beneath
[1:04:56] in the earth beneath blood and fire and
[1:04:58] Vapor of smoke and the sun shall be
[1:05:00] turned into darkness and the moon into
[1:05:02] blood before the great and notable day
[1:05:04] of the Lord CA come I wonder I wonder if
[1:05:08] he had his Bible if he had his scroll or
[1:05:10] if it just came to him if he just
[1:05:13] remembered and he just quoted well we'll
[1:05:15] never know we'll ask him one day but
[1:05:17] it's said Peter did you have your Scroll
[1:05:19] of Joel with you or did you just
[1:05:22] remember
[1:05:24] it what it took the interpretation came
[1:05:27] down to Peter and he said this is the
[1:05:29] Fulfillment of
[1:05:31] that where was I 20 and the sun shall be
[1:05:34] turned to Darkness and the moon into
[1:05:35] blood before the great and notable day
[1:05:36] of the Lord and it shall come to pass
[1:05:38] that whosoever shall call on the name of
[1:05:40] the Lord shall be saved ye men of Israel
[1:05:42] hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man
[1:05:45] approved of God among you by Miracles
[1:05:47] and wonders and signs which God did by
[1:05:49] him in the midst of you as you yourself
[1:05:52] know him being delivered by the
[1:05:54] determinant counsel and the the for
[1:05:56] knowledge of God ye have taken and by
[1:05:58] Wicked hands have crucified and
[1:06:01] slain whom God hath raised up not only
[1:06:04] is this
[1:06:06] prophecy about the Holy Spirit coming
[1:06:08] down but Peter takes it and he uses it
[1:06:11] like we should do every time you take
[1:06:13] something that the prophets say and it
[1:06:16] should always point to Jesus
[1:06:18] Christ and this is what's happening
[1:06:20] right
[1:06:23] here where was I
[1:06:28] sorry whom God hath raised
[1:06:31] up having Loos the Pains of death
[1:06:34] because it was not possible that he
[1:06:36] should be Holden of it for David
[1:06:37] speaketh of him concerning I foresaw the
[1:06:40] lord always before my face for he is on
[1:06:43] my right hand that I should not be moved
[1:06:45] therefore did my heart rejoice and my
[1:06:48] tongue was glad moreover also my flesh
[1:06:51] shall Rest In Hope
[1:06:55] so many say that
[1:06:58] acts and many of the the the readings
[1:07:02] that you'll read about this this
[1:07:05] prophetic Ministry of Joel many say that
[1:07:08] that is just to the
[1:07:10] Jews but it's not because Peter said for
[1:07:14] This Promise is unto you and your
[1:07:15] children and many that as many that are
[1:07:18] far off me and
[1:07:22] you even as many as our Lord God shall
[1:07:24] call that's
[1:07:26] me let's go to chapter
[1:07:31] three for behold in those days and in
[1:07:35] that time when I shall bring again the
[1:07:38] Captivity of Judah and in Jerusalem in
[1:07:41] Jerusalem I will also gather all nations
[1:07:43] and will bring them down into the valley
[1:07:45] of Jehoshaphat and will plead with them
[1:07:48] there for my people and for my Heritage
[1:07:51] Israel whom they have scattered among
[1:07:53] the Nations and parted my land
[1:07:56] and they have cast lots for my people
[1:07:58] and have given a boy for a harlot and
[1:08:00] sold a girl for wine that they might
[1:08:03] drink yay and what have ye to do with me
[1:08:06] oy and ziden and all the coasts of
[1:08:10] Palestine will you render me a
[1:08:12] recompense and if you recompense me
[1:08:14] Swift recompense me swiftly and speedily
[1:08:17] will I return to recompense upon your
[1:08:19] own head because you have taken my
[1:08:21] silver and my gold and have carried into
[1:08:23] your temples my goodly
[1:08:26] Pleasant things the children also of
[1:08:28] Judah and the children of Jerusalem have
[1:08:30] you sold to the grecians that might be
[1:08:33] that might remove them far from their
[1:08:36] border behold I will raise them out of
[1:08:39] the place whether ye have sold them and
[1:08:41] will return your recompense upon your
[1:08:43] own head and I will sell your sons and
[1:08:45] your daughters into the hand of the
[1:08:46] children of Judah and they shall sell
[1:08:49] them to the sabians to a people far off
[1:08:51] for the Lord has spoken it procla
[1:08:54] Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles
[1:08:58] prepare War wake up the Mighty Men let
[1:09:02] all the men of War draw near let them
[1:09:05] come up beat your plow shears into
[1:09:09] swords and your pruning hooks into
[1:09:11] Spears let the weak say I am strong
[1:09:14] notice he calls the Gentiles
[1:09:17] to this is
[1:09:20] contrary to a scripture in Isaiah that
[1:09:23] says the very opposite
[1:09:25] it says here beat your plow shares into
[1:09:28] swords and your pruning hooks into
[1:09:30] Spears those are those are um tools that
[1:09:32] you use to to till the ground and he
[1:09:35] says take those and make weapons out of
[1:09:38] those but in
[1:09:40] Isaiah he says take your
[1:09:43] swords and make them into tools that you
[1:09:46] can tell tell the
[1:09:50] ground this prophecy here from
[1:09:54] Joel Isa
[1:09:55] that prophecy is coming that peace is
[1:09:58] coming the Prince of Peace the Mighty
[1:10:01] God but
[1:10:04] now late
[1:10:07] 1940s this was fulfilled with Israel and
[1:10:11] here comes from the Holocaust and all
[1:10:14] these horrible things that happened here
[1:10:16] come the Jews back to their Homeland as
[1:10:19] God had commanded I'm going to bring you
[1:10:21] back brings them back and you see
[1:10:24] pictures of when they when they started
[1:10:26] in the 30s and in the 40s here they are
[1:10:30] they have a rifle in one
[1:10:32] hand and they're picking oranges with
[1:10:35] the other and taking care of things and
[1:10:38] and and ready to fight and look what's
[1:10:40] happening right
[1:10:41] now they've got F35 stealth Fighters
[1:10:46] they've got the they've got the greatest
[1:10:48] of all the militaries and and they're
[1:10:50] they're they're protecting themselves
[1:10:52] and here they are they have beaten those
[1:10:55] those
[1:10:57] stuff to Tool the ground and they have
[1:10:59] made weapons with it to protect
[1:11:02] themselves you go back we went through
[1:11:04] the book of Nehemiah there they are they
[1:11:06] standing they're they're building this
[1:11:08] wall they got a brick in one hand they
[1:11:09] got a sword in the other hand and here
[1:11:12] they are and still these Jews are ready
[1:11:15] to go man don't shoot at them because
[1:11:19] they shoot
[1:11:21] back and that's how that's what's going
[1:11:23] on right now they they are ready to
[1:11:29] fight Joel's prophesying that
[1:11:35] here and it's coming Peace by the grace
[1:11:39] of God the Prince of Peace is coming
[1:11:41] where everything's going to be wiped out
[1:11:42] but there's going to be some hard times
[1:11:44] coming Joel says assemble yourselves and
[1:11:48] Come All Ye Heathen and gather
[1:11:50] yourselves together roundabout tother
[1:11:52] cause thy Mighty ones to come down oh
[1:11:54] Lord
[1:11:56] let the Heathen be wakened and come up
[1:11:58] into the valley of Jehoshaphat for there
[1:12:01] will I sit to judge all the Heathen
[1:12:03] roundabout put ye put ye in the sickle
[1:12:06] and harvest The Ripe come come get you
[1:12:09] down for the Press is full the fats
[1:12:11] overflow for their wickedness is great
[1:12:14] multitudes multitudes in the valley of
[1:12:17] decision for the day of the Lord is near
[1:12:19] in the valley of
[1:12:21] decision the sun and the moon shall be
[1:12:23] darkened and the Stars shall withdraw
[1:12:25] their
[1:12:26] shining and the Lord also shall Roar out
[1:12:29] of
[1:12:30] Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem
[1:12:34] and the heavens and the Earth shall
[1:12:35] Shake but the Lord will be the hope of
[1:12:37] his people and the strength of the
[1:12:39] children of Israel so shall ye show that
[1:12:42] I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion
[1:12:46] my Holy Mountain then shall Jerusalem be
[1:12:49] holy and there shall no strangers pass
[1:12:52] through her
[1:12:53] anymore and shall come to pass in that
[1:12:56] day that the mountains shall drop down
[1:12:58] new wine and the hills shall flow with
[1:13:01] milk and the rivers of Judah shall flow
[1:13:04] with Waters and the fountain shall come
[1:13:06] forth out of the house of the Lord and
[1:13:08] shall water in the valley of sham Egypt
[1:13:11] shall be a desolation and Edom shall be
[1:13:14] a desolate Wilderness for the violence
[1:13:16] against the children of Judah because
[1:13:18] they have shed innocent blood in their
[1:13:21] land wow what a current scripture
[1:13:26] but Judah shall dwell forever in
[1:13:29] Jerusalem from generation to generation
[1:13:31] for I will cleanse their blood that I
[1:13:33] have not cleansed for the Lord dwelleth
[1:13:37] in Zion and the close of the Book of
[1:13:42] Joel what a
[1:13:44] powerful powerful book of of things that
[1:13:47] are going on then with
[1:13:50] Joel and they represented things to
[1:13:53] come now I want to
[1:13:56] I want to
[1:13:57] say on uh on Sunday night I
[1:14:01] um I shared as we were sharing some
[1:14:05] testimonies and oh I heard some just
[1:14:07] wonderful things brother Stephen um what
[1:14:09] what just tremendous um testimony that
[1:14:12] you gave and and really that that
[1:14:15] everybody did and um it was just it was
[1:14:17] just a really good night I especially um
[1:14:20] appreciated sister Martha's testimony
[1:14:22] where sometimes we just need Lord I just
[1:14:25] need a
[1:14:26] touch and we get into that place well
[1:14:30] then I came up and I I shared some
[1:14:31] things at the end and just wanted
[1:14:36] to warn congregation just be careful
[1:14:41] about the spirit of the sectarian
[1:14:45] denominational Spirit where we draw a
[1:14:49] circle around ourselves and say we are
[1:14:50] special it's not right and let me tell
[1:14:53] you it is not if you
[1:14:56] claim and most of us
[1:14:58] do I don't see anyone here that is
[1:15:03] new if you claim to believe brother
[1:15:06] branam brother brandham did not teach
[1:15:08] those
[1:15:09] things This Book of
[1:15:12] Joel in my opinion and I've I grew up
[1:15:16] listening to brother brandom most days
[1:15:18] of my life really I listened to every
[1:15:21] tape from 1947 to 1965
[1:15:26] and I um I love them everyone I know it
[1:15:30] I know it and one
[1:15:33] thing that is a common theme in brother
[1:15:37] Brown's message very very common I would
[1:15:41] say the most common theme is from This
[1:15:46] Book of
[1:15:47] Joel now he doesn't quote it I mean
[1:15:50] quotes it all the time but brother
[1:15:52] brandom Likens this this
[1:15:56] Locust this evil little creature that
[1:16:02] destroys the plant he Likens it to the
[1:16:06] denominational system and the
[1:16:08] denominational
[1:16:10] spirit I can categorically say he
[1:16:13] preached more about that than anything
[1:16:15] else in his whole
[1:16:16] Ministry he came to tear that thing down
[1:16:20] and let me tell you William brandom
[1:16:22] hated the denominational sectarian
[1:16:25] spirit and if you don't believe me I'd
[1:16:28] say turn on a tape pick one anyone and
[1:16:31] he'll be saying that I want to read a
[1:16:34] few quotes to
[1:16:36] you that he talks
[1:16:38] about these this evil little
[1:16:45] creature Palmer worm Locust cankerworm
[1:16:48] caterpillar
[1:16:50] 1959 now what do they do what has their
[1:16:54] translators
[1:16:55] or the men done that uh that quote was
[1:16:58] correct or the or the church men
[1:17:02] done what's the organization done
[1:17:05] wrapped up an old denominational rag
[1:17:08] around in order to be popular with the
[1:17:10] rest if I have to eat soda crackers and
[1:17:13] drink branchwater and be martyred I'll
[1:17:15] stand for God's truth and die on the
[1:17:18] stump that's right that's not no man the
[1:17:22] pope of Rome or bishop or Cardinal can't
[1:17:24] withstand that yes sir what's the matter
[1:17:27] what the Palmer worm left what the
[1:17:30] Methodist left the Baptist eaten what
[1:17:34] the Baptist left the Pentecostal
[1:17:37] eaten what a place the lifelines are all

[1:17:59] enough let me have principle enough let
[1:18:01] me be man enough let me be Christ enough
[1:18:04] to stand alone if I stand have to stand
[1:18:08] that way and tell the truth and stand
[1:18:10] yes sir I'd rather preach the gospel to
[1:18:13] five people than have the millions that
[1:18:14] does here tell tell the truth I'll never
[1:18:18] compromise I wanted this because God had
[1:18:20] told me these Great Signs and things
[1:18:23] that's being produced like the
[1:18:25] manifestation of his resurrection and so
[1:18:27] forth it's for the church those poor
[1:18:30] people out there and bound in them

[1:18:36] undocumented like embalmed God bless
[1:18:38] your heart I won't leave you in that
[1:18:42] condition I'll tell you what God Said
[1:18:45] but I will restore to you all that the
[1:18:47] caterpillar has eaten and the canker
[1:18:49] worm has eaten and all that the Palmer
[1:18:51] worm has eaten I will restore sayeth the
[1:18:53] Lord so help me I make this Prophecy
[1:18:57] Before the coming of the Lord the true
[1:18:58] Apostolic Faith the true Apostolic
[1:19:00] teaching the true Bible Spirit the true
[1:19:03] it's on its road now trying to eat its
[1:19:05] way up and grow out again the
[1:19:07] Pentecostal had it to start
[1:19:10] with what did they do they draw a little
[1:19:14] rind around it and begin to to
[1:19:17] nominate and he cut it off and he cut it
[1:19:21] right
[1:19:22] off that's exactly right here come along
[1:19:26] where the Lord sent these gifts these
[1:19:27] humble little gifts that he gave me they
[1:19:29] kept coming and they wanted me to be a
[1:19:31] lad rain
[1:19:33] outp made an organization out of it
[1:19:35] wanted me to come to join the assemblies
[1:19:38] I've stood right in the midst of every
[1:19:40] bunch that's hanging out there right
[1:19:42] there at the stump of the tree and said
[1:19:44] this is the foundation cut off these Old
[1:19:47] Rag lines here so the life can get into
[1:19:50] you that you'll have prophecies and
[1:19:52] you'll have discernment you'll have the
[1:19:54] spirit you'll have power you'll have the
[1:19:57] restoration of the true church when you
[1:19:59] get back to the True Vine and the true
[1:20:02] life it can't come through a rag that
[1:20:05] drops right down and says it was another
[1:20:08] day it's another day it's forever the
[1:20:10] same he is Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:20:12] and the end absolutely you'll have to
[1:20:14] come back to the foundation for Upon
[1:20:17] This Rock I'll build my church and the
[1:20:19] gates of hell can't Prevail against it
[1:20:21] what is that rock you tape listeners
[1:20:23] that rock is the that's this is Peter
[1:20:26] and Jesus that rock is the revelation of
[1:20:28] who Christ
[1:20:33] is next
[1:20:38] quote it gets better brother Aaron I
[1:20:41] mean it's good
[1:20:42] now watch back in Joel in the second
[1:20:45] chapter where I preached on here not
[1:20:46] long ago the four insects what the
[1:20:48] Palmer worm left and the caterpillar eat
[1:20:50] with the caterpillar eat the Locust
[1:20:52] eaten you remember the preaching on that
[1:20:54] I think it was here in California at the
[1:20:56] breakfast I believe it was in Phoenix
[1:20:57] what the Methodist left the Baptist
[1:20:59] eaten what the Baptist left the
[1:21:01] Pentecostal eaten and tore the whole
[1:21:03] Vine down but i r restore sayeth the
[1:21:06] Lord and watch that same insect is the
[1:21:09] same thing only in different stages the
[1:21:12] Palmer worm becomes a caterpillar and so
[1:21:14] forth and on down and it's an insect and
[1:21:17] that's an
[1:21:18] insect starting eating off brotherly
[1:21:22] love I read it again started eating off
[1:21:25] brotherly
[1:21:27] love taking the Bible and substituting
[1:21:31] something
[1:21:34] else I'll read that one again taking the
[1:21:38] Bible and substituting something else
[1:21:41] and I give the four major things and
[1:21:43] proved it by the scripture the things
[1:21:45] that eat out the teaching of the true
[1:21:46] word of God brotherly love as Paul said
[1:21:49] already started in 1 Corinthians 13 all
[1:21:52] those things how they eat it up and just
[1:21:54] eat the church plumbed down to a stub
[1:21:58] but he said I will restore sayeth the
[1:22:00] Lord that's right all the years that
[1:22:04] they had eaten and all the things that
[1:22:06] they had done notice Israel notice
[1:22:09] Israel when you has always been the Fig
[1:22:12] Tree when you see this tree putting
[1:22:14] forth its buds what the generation that
[1:22:16] sees Israel become a nation that
[1:22:18] generation will not pass until it be
[1:22:20] fulfilled watch don't you see it here
[1:22:23] look at them now God God has always had
[1:22:25] to drive the Jews and they never had the
[1:22:27] Holy Spirit many of them wouldn't even
[1:22:29] believe their prophets they Messengers
[1:22:31] and he had to drive them and that's what
[1:22:33] he's going to have to do to the Gentile
[1:22:36] Church he's going to have to break down
[1:22:38] these denominational
[1:22:41] barriers we're letting communism start
[1:22:44] eating eating around us and then we'll
[1:22:47] all have to come together God will make
[1:22:49] his word fulfilled because the Covenant
[1:22:52] is unconditional not if you will will we
[1:22:55] don't make a deal with God not if you
[1:22:58] will I will but I have already done it
[1:23:00] that's right oh I love that that just
[1:23:03] makes me feel religious does me
[1:23:06] too next next quote then this little
[1:23:09] fellow died out he become a locust that
[1:23:13] was the next
[1:23:15] stage that was the next stage was a
[1:23:17] locust now what does that Locust do a
[1:23:20] locust eats the leaves that's right a
[1:23:24] locust takes onto the leaves what the
[1:23:26] Palmer worm left he left the leaves he
[1:23:29] eat the fruit off the tree then what
[1:23:31] took then what took in the locust come
[1:23:34] to eat eat what the Palmer worm left now
[1:23:36] what did he
[1:23:37] do what did this Palmer worm do
[1:23:40] destroyed the leaves what's the leaves
[1:23:42] for destroying Divine
[1:23:44] Fellowship that's right now he's a
[1:23:48] presbyterian we don't have nothing to do
[1:23:50] with them are you
[1:23:53] serious now now he's a presbyterian I
[1:23:56] won't have nothing to do with
[1:23:58] him and how many times have we heard
[1:24:00] something like that from our churches oh
[1:24:03] they're Baptist they're Presbyterian
[1:24:05] they're
[1:24:06] nominal do you think brother Brandon was
[1:24:08] for that kind of a spirit yet it's
[1:24:10] rampant he was not for
[1:24:13] that he's a presbyterian we won't have
[1:24:15] nothing to do with him he's Nazarene
[1:24:17] he's Pentecostal he's this or that or
[1:24:19] the other we won't have nothing to do
[1:24:21] with him because he don't belong to our
[1:24:23] group have a meeting up here for healing
[1:24:24] of the sick huh our church don't even
[1:24:26] believe in it see there you
[1:24:29] do what did the old old Locust what did
[1:24:32] the little old Locust do he cut off the
[1:24:34] he cut the fellowship off and that's
[1:24:36] right he took all the fellowship what is
[1:24:39] fellowship what does the leaves do it
[1:24:41] makes it cool where the birds fly under
[1:24:44] the leaves cool off there's your tree
[1:24:48] again and he shall be like a tree that's
[1:24:50] planted see all right where the people
[1:24:52] can come and sit down under the The
[1:24:54] Fellowship of the Holy Spirit and cool
[1:24:56] off a bit I'm going to brag for a minute
[1:24:59] this is the and I told somebody this is
[1:25:02] the best church I have ever
[1:25:05] seen as far as welcoming people come sit
[1:25:08] down in the shade enjoy service we're
[1:25:12] going to love you and I want us to
[1:25:14] continue I want us to get even
[1:25:16] better next
[1:25:19] quote and I said to a little woman the
[1:25:21] other day poor little woman she belonged
[1:25:23] to a great dignified Church down she
[1:25:26] said she's dying with cancer went down
[1:25:29] to pray for her brother Roy Roberson
[1:25:30] here one of the trustees sent me down
[1:25:33] there and the poor little thing sitting
[1:25:35] there dying with
[1:25:37] cancer and she said I
[1:25:40] said I
[1:25:42] said are you a
[1:25:44] Christian she said sir I don't know what
[1:25:47] to
[1:25:48] say said I went to a certain
[1:25:50] church and said she started crying
[1:25:54] I said' what's the matter she said I
[1:25:56] just couldn't dress
[1:25:58] right said they looked down upon me H oh
[1:26:03] there you are see you're there you're
[1:26:06] uncomfortable see but the Bible said
[1:26:09] that we are to assemble ourselves
[1:26:11] together in Heavenly places oh my what
[1:26:14] all
[1:26:15] alike why I I tell you what what this
[1:26:18] will do it'll make a pair of overalls in
[1:26:20] a tuxedo suit put their arms around each
[1:26:22] other and call each other brother sure
[1:26:24] will it'll make an old Calico dress I
[1:26:26] have no idea what that
[1:26:28] is do you sisters know
[1:26:32] Sister Sister Heather you know what that
[1:26:34] is calico
[1:26:36] dress I
[1:26:38] don't okay old Calico dress put her arms
[1:26:42] around silk and satin and say sister how
[1:26:44] are you this morning praise God I love
[1:26:47] that that is just brother John that's
[1:26:50] that's our church man and it's it feels
[1:26:53] good and we need to continue on on
[1:26:54] that's right it will it's joy peace
[1:26:59] love Faith in the word longsuffering
[1:27:02] gentleness patience set down in Heavenly
[1:27:05] places in Christ Jesus cool off a little
[1:27:08] while that's what the leaves
[1:27:10] did but what did the old locust did he
[1:27:14] come around eat them leaves off and said
[1:27:17] you belong to ours or you don't belong
[1:27:18] to
[1:27:20] anybody so he took all the cool coolness
[1:27:23] out of the spirit
[1:27:24] took all the coolness of the spirit out
[1:27:27] he fixed himself a Creed all right now
[1:27:30] we got to go on I could stay on I could
[1:27:32] stay a long time on that old Locust I'm
[1:27:35] sure he could we can
[1:27:38] close as I
[1:27:42] said my understanding of brother bram's
[1:27:45] message this was his
[1:27:49] core was against this sectarian
[1:27:52] denominational way
[1:27:55] and he likened it to this Critter that
[1:27:59] swarms in and kills the plant it kills
[1:28:05] the fellowship it kills the ability for
[1:28:09] you to invite someone to church and for
[1:28:12] them to feel comfortable
[1:28:14] here it destroys that it destroys as he
[1:28:18] said in these in and I read I don't know
[1:28:20] how many quotes he kept going back to
[1:28:22] love
[1:28:24] and how it destroys that love because of
[1:28:29] certain doctrines and we brothers and
[1:28:32] sisters we are I'm not saying us I'm
[1:28:36] saying the message ranks is guilty of
[1:28:40] that it has always been my greatest
[1:28:43] desire to have a church that we can
[1:28:46] invite people to and that they could
[1:28:48] come here and they could feel
[1:28:50] comfortable I believe we have it and I
[1:28:52] want to continue on but that is not the
[1:28:55] case in other places and as you said as
[1:28:59] as I read this from brother brandom that
[1:29:02] woman said I can't I don't look like
[1:29:05] they look and brother brandom said ah
[1:29:08] there it is right
[1:29:10] there so we need to always be careful I
[1:29:14] believe we're headed in the right
[1:29:15] direction I do not sacrificing Holiness
[1:29:18] by no means continue on serving the lord
[1:29:21] we need to pray more we need to be more
[1:29:23] of a Christ we need to always do more
[1:29:26] and more and
[1:29:27] more but we also have to understand if
[1:29:31] we say we believe this man we have to
[1:29:35] know what he
[1:29:37] preached and we have to see his number
[1:29:40] one
[1:29:42] focus and that was this denominational
[1:29:46] spirit that is the same as this Locust
[1:29:49] that comes in and
[1:29:51] destroys Daniel you can come to close
[1:29:56] I could read quote after quote I tell
[1:29:59] you what pick pick a tape just pick one
[1:30:03] go into the
[1:30:06] table pick
[1:30:08] one and tell me if he doesn't preach
[1:30:10] about it it was his message and it's a
[1:30:13] wonderful message and I think that we
[1:30:15] should get back to it we should get back
[1:30:17] to what he taught because he had he had
[1:30:21] something that we need
[1:30:24] that's why I love way the way Joel
[1:30:27] starts this he said tell your children
[1:30:30] about
[1:30:31] it teach your children about these
[1:30:35] things tell them for those that knew him
[1:30:40] what kind of a man he was tell them
[1:30:43] about the Miracles that you
[1:30:45] saw show them that God's Alive
[1:30:49] today because this time's coming these
[1:30:51] prophecies that come out of This Book of
[1:30:53] Joel they are are
[1:30:55] powerful and they're the closing of
[1:30:58] time Jesus quoted
[1:31:00] them Peter quoted him the Book of
[1:31:05] Revelation says the same thing it's a
[1:31:09] hard time
[1:31:10] coming but our hearts need to be right
[1:31:13] and we need to be right
[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:19] Daniel Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord
[1:31:26] Open the Eyes of My
[1:31:30] Heart I want to see

[1:32:44] Heart I want to see
[1:32:50] you I want to see
[1:32:58] I'm looking for a
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:09] scripture the Apostle John I remember
[1:33:12] brother brandom telling a story about
[1:33:13] him when he got in his old
[1:33:18] age he's the only one of all the
[1:33:20] disciples that died of old age and here
[1:33:23] is here is in his old
[1:33:25] age and he would just cry out Children
[1:33:28] love each other just love one
[1:33:31] another even in his old age he saw that
[1:33:34] that is the most important thing and he
[1:33:37] himself wrote these three words he said
[1:33:39] God is love it is so important brothers
[1:33:43] and sisters it is this
[1:33:46] denominational
[1:33:48] system started with the Catholic
[1:33:51] church and boy did it do
[1:33:55] damage and what it does is it brings it
[1:33:57] doesn't breathe love it brings jealousy
[1:34:00] and it brings it breeds hatred it bre
[1:34:03] breeds
[1:34:04] division it breeds a um
[1:34:08] fear it it breeds a spirit that that you
[1:34:12] think that that you're better than
[1:34:14] someone
[1:34:15] else and it just plays on the weaknesses
[1:34:18] of human
[1:34:20] beings and it is today it's a strong as
[1:34:24] it's ever
[1:34:25] been and
[1:34:27] that
[1:34:29] destroying
[1:34:31] Locust comes in and takes the leaves it
[1:34:33] takes the all the way takes the bark off
[1:34:35] of it and kills the plant and then and
[1:34:38] then when he when he kills all of the
[1:34:39] fruits when he kills the ability of the
[1:34:42] plant to be able to bring forth food for
[1:34:47] the
[1:34:48] people then it brings a
[1:34:51] famine and that famine is prophesied to
[1:34:54] come and not just a famine for food but
[1:34:56] a famine for hearing the word of God and
[1:34:59] we're living close to those days brother

[1:40:28] welcomed let's always keep that Spirit
[1:40:31] brothers and sisters I believe that is
[1:40:35] one of the things that I used to do is I
[1:40:37] used to ride my bike around town in
[1:40:39] Jeffersonville and I talk to Old Folks
[1:40:41] sitting on their porches and try to get
[1:40:43] stories about brother Brandon one of the
[1:40:46] things and this was
[1:40:49] universally that all of them who never
[1:40:51] went to church and never they they
[1:40:53] didn't they didn't follow his teachings
[1:40:55] or anything but one thing that he that
[1:40:58] they always said is he was my one of my
[1:41:02] best friends he made everyone feel like
[1:41:06] they were very special I remember one
[1:41:08] time I was I rid my bike up to this this
[1:41:10] lady she was sitting outside these
[1:41:12] low-income apartments on um on 10th
[1:41:15] Street and um no it was on uh 8th
[1:41:20] Street and I went up to her and she had
[1:41:25] a circle around her
[1:41:27] mouth where she had been smoking
[1:41:29] cigarettes for so long and and her mouth
[1:41:31] was she just looked at and and her lips
[1:41:34] were stained from the
[1:41:35] nicotine and I walked up to her and and

[1:41:56] family and told me a couple stories

[1:42:03] lady was to have met him and the
[1:42:05] impression that he made on her why
[1:42:10] wasn't the Miracles it was the love that
[1:42:13] that man had and that's the love that I
[1:42:16] desire to have I believe that's a love
