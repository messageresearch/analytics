our heart we just want to say amen i want to make sure we get to it numbers chapter 33. i sent you brothers a powerpoint if you have that i'm going to go ahead and display that that'd be fine uh acts i'm sorry i got that backwards we're gonna hold your place in numbers 33 but first we're going to read acts 15. amen god bless you you love the lord jesus good to be here in his house good to see all of you amen here this morning trust that you just came amen with an expectation amen to see the lord i believe he has something for us the lord just pressed this upon my heart so strong you know you always feel burdened as a minister you preach something but then there's other times you just feel in almost an indescribable indescribable way the lord's just pressing something upon you and i was pressed with it last sunday but the lord told me you can't preach it yet you got to lay a foundation but today i've been looking to this day knowing what the lord had upon my heart and then want to come to something i believe is is from the lord acts chapter 15 we'd like to just continue speaking here on rebuilding the tabernacle of david rebuilding the tabernacle of david and after the and after they had held their peace this is verse 13 if you have your bible james answered saying men and brethren hearken unto me simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles and here's his purpose to take out of them a people for his name and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle of david which has fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up verse 17 that the residue of men might seek after the lord and that all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the lord who doeth all these things known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the gentiles are turned to god numbers chapter 33 will read and then have you be seated i want to begin reading here at verse 50. amen numbers chapter 33 and i'm going to try this again this clicker here give it a shot there we go good okay praise the lord just stay with me here as we read this and i have seen it just these two verses a few verses here and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying speaking to the children of israel and saying to them when you are passed over jordan into the land of canaan then you shall drive out how many how many oh a a-l-l-o he says when you're passed over then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you destroy all their pictures destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places and you shall dispossess that's an important word the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein that's god's ultimate purpose and here's the colon you see this here here's a promise for i jehovah have given you laos the people the family of god the land to possess it now here's a big uh condition but if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which you let remain shall be of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns and your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i thought to do unto them let's pray lord jesus we we're so grateful lord of your grace today lord we have a heavy heart lord and sometimes the word has a way to do that father lord your word comes as the bible says that the word of god is profitable for teaching lord for reproof for rebuke lord that we may stand perfect lord jesus i pray god that you would come this morning lord by your spirit not the spirit of a man lord i pray that as i just right now lord step away i step aside lord and i'm just asking you to take over granted lord and speak to every heart we pray in jesus name amen amen you can be seated this morning we have a lot we want to get to i've asked for aaron garrett to minister for us tonight so i don't have this evening service and lord put that upon my heart looking forward to that but i have a lot i don't have i can't get to tonight so i'm not going to go into your time brother aaron but um i'm going to take my time is that okay i want to back up here in acts and we're just gonna lay a little foundation we could be uh theological about this uh this prophecy here in acts 15 but we're not really doing that today um so we just want to cover it just real briefly here i want you to look at verse 16 again because this was a verse uh 14 again because this was the this this made meaning or the purpose of the plan of god and what we find in numbers this was prophetic prophesied and it was a fulfillment of christ come when christ came simeon hath declared how that god at first notice verse 14 did visit the gentiles and here's why to take out of them a people for his name now that word is loosely used we say that often gentile and sometimes that would maybe someone would say well what are we those are jews they're jews and then there's gentiles how are we a gentile that gentile word simply means nations so anytime you read it in the bible the bible uses two different words here and when he says here god notice god hath simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them now when you look at that word film he's speaking of gentiles nations and then he says a people for his name that people word people is leos which means the jew knew that meant him specifically so this was a conflict how is god going to take his people were your people or abraham's seed is what they told him but the term gentile doesn't really describe who someone is but it really just means who you're not and that means that you're not a jew a gentile is one who belongs to the nations to the in to the group of people who are not jews that's me and that's you the bible has a lot to say about this but god was prophesying here that the tabernacle of david would not just consist of jews but it would be the whole world that other nations we would be grafted in and you know as we said before we've been grafted in we're the you know we're we're the we're the side event the main show is god revealing himself to his people to his brethren amen that's a whole nother sermon there but we we won't get into that today verse 16 and he says and after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen down in other words you've rejected it this is they rejected christ this was who was christ as we preached last sunday he had the key to the house of david he was the temple amen that they that they were looking for he was the fulfillment of all of the prophets we notice here he says that which has fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up so we know that god originally had this in his mind that god was going to bring out a people who were separated unto himself now separation is a word that we don't really like very much none of us like separation we could say covet has separated us no one likes separation but there's a godly separation that god calls for every believer and and it doesn't just refer to jews but god's family the bible says you're a peculiar people you're to be separated unto the lord and you know when you really serve the lord jesus and i'm going to be practical this morning so don't don't lose me here this morning i just want to speak real direct to you this morning there's there's when you have the power of god in your life when christ has really regenerated you by the baptism of the holy ghost you don't have to separate yourself the word does the separating you know i learned that as a 16 year old boy when i gave my heart to the lord and i came to all of my friends now my friends were not worldly friends they were church friends and you know i came to my friends with this and the lord had done something uh had started working on my heart at 11 12 13 at 16 you know i came in a service and the lord just anointed faith inside of my heart and i said i want to give my whole life to jesus i want to sell out to the lord i want to i want to dedicate my myself i want to give you my whole being i don't want to hold any of me back and i gave my heart to jesus and he still has it this morning and and but you know what what's amazing is that is that i i thought i'd you know i'd come to my friends and i thought we were all going to serve the lord together you know everybody this is all one for one and one for all you know the problem was is that i didn't want to do the things they did anymore i didn't want to to sneak out and and you know and do things behind my parents back i didn't want to listen to that kind of worldly music anymore because there had been a change inside of me i was looking for something different i wanted to be changed and i wanted it to i wanted everybody to get what i got and you can only say that when the lord really does something for you and you could sometimes you don't know how to pray for somebody and you look at someone who's lost or maybe bound you don't really know how to say lord i you don't really know what to say so sometimes you just say lord do for them what you did for me because i know you did something real in me and you could do it to them but separation occurs when you come to christ there's something god says i want you to be separate even in second corinthians chapter six the bible says come out from among them verse 17 word i'm just going to quote it to you come out from among them and be separate says the lord do not touch what is unclean and i will receive you i will be a father to you and you shall be my sons and daughters i want to be his son and you want to say lord i want to be your daughter i want to be your son this morning so the bible begins this and we don't have time to to to minister this entire sermon on separation but the scripture is really clear in leviticus it says you'll not walk in the statutes of the nations which i am casting out before you i am the lord your god who has separated you from the peoples you shall be holy to me for i am the lord for i the lord i'm holy and have separated you from the peoples that you should be mine when israel deuteronomy entered canaan now notice this is what god commands them he says for you're a holy people to the lord your god the lord your god has chosen you to be a people for himself a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth says that again he says that he will set you high above all nations which he has made in praise and name and an honor that you may be a holy people to the lord your god just as he has spoken in first kings 8 53 says you separated them from among all the people of the earth to be your inheritance as you spoke by your servant moses when you brought our fathers out of egypt oh lord god so god had chosen them to be a special people a peculiar nation the jews were separate they were different there was to be no mixing there was to be no mindy no moldy no mixing together like you'd mix up a piece of clay because they were different there was a different quality there was they had been chosen they had been purchased they had been bought with a price they weren't to marry intermingle their marriages they were to marry their people they were to marry within their people and any time that we could we could give you story after story after story of how god's family went outside of the covenant of what god gave them to marry people from the world and the destruction and the collateral damage that it that it caused that it would be years and years and years of catastrophe after catastrophe and god's people today god's family god's elected we're no different because we've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb we've been purchased can you say amen this morning that means we're to be different but not just different we're to be separate we're to be separate hebrews 7 26 for such a high priest was fitting for us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and has become higher than the heavens notice what he says here in titus 2 verse 13 jesus christ gave himself for us that he might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for himself his own special people zealous for good works i love this one this is my favorite in first peter two verse nine but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation gentiles not just a holy jew but a holy people a chosen separate elected predestinated seed he says you're you're a holy nation a special people who wants or not a people but are now the people of god who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy we know the message of the hour what was the seventh angel's message what was he crying in revelations 18 come out of her come out of her that harlot system come out of her my people lest you share in her sins unless you receive of her plagues so god had something he said i want you to be separate i want you to be different there should be no mixing there should be no mixed marriages your friendships even the bible says that the believer is not to be unequally yoked even in business you think it wouldn't apply to marriage not to make an affinity or a league that's what exactly what brother adam taught he said you you christian businessman god's made you different you don't you don't run your business by the principles of the world but but god says i want you to be different you're to be a holy nation a separate people we notice here he says this in in numbers we want to come back to this and i'm just going to take my time with this here in numbers 33 says the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab i put these on the screen so that you could just follow along real closely with me he says the lord spoke unto moses in the plains of moab now if you go read numbers chapter 3 if you go read the beginning of this numbers 33 it's a chronological list of the encampments all the way through the wilderness and you could read about it they camped here then they picked up then they moved here then they moved here then they moved here it was a journey one that took much longer than it should have but it was a journey and they finally come here they are to come to canaan this was god's promise this was god's promise to abraham and his seed this was god's this was god's people's inheritance it's a type of the holy ghost it's a type of every gift every every blessing every promise that god has given to the believer and and here they come to the border of their inheritance and god as moses we know doesn't doesn't go into the land god told him he wasn't going to be allowed to go in but joshua was going to lead them in and joshua was not he who was joshua he was a type of the holy ghost that's what brother branham said he was a type of the holy ghost and so so moses the bible says that moses instructs them they're they're on this side they're not in they haven't crossed jordan yet they've not went into canaan yet they've not crossed over and moses who's moses the prophet he's going to give them the word he's going to give them the instructions and god says by moses in the plains of moab this is the last one near jericho saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them this is this is the word of god he says in speaking to the children of israel and say unto them when you're past over jordan into the land of canaan then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you destroy all their pictures destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it now these were heathens these were these canaanites now remember what god says i think it's in deuteronomy he says not for the righteousness of you that i that i'm using you what was israel going to be they were going to be a weapon they were going to be a weapon in the hands of god to destroy a wicked people now we could take time to show you how wicked the canaanites were but we're not going to do that this morning but the canaanites were a wicked people uh uh just even even just the the sexual immorality of of canaan in the temple in in the places of worship was more than i could even say here in a mixed audience but if you go read your bible it was a wicked people people look at the scripture and say wow god is it's genocide god's going in there just wiping out everybody well this was a god had promised and promised and promised and warned and warned and warned this is the people who hated god despised god very much like our culture american culture today america is not a christian culture it's a secular atheistic culture but where did that start you know you can go back to the age of enlightenment and say what was the age of enlightenment it was it was the enlightenment was sent from god for a purpose but what did it bring even men like isaac newton and you can go in and study the the that with when mine began when the ma when the mind of man began to rationalize and thought that they could figure it out that's the age of the daunting of invention i'm thankful for it i'm thankful for modern invention i'm thankful for modern medicine i'm thankful that that we don't live we live on this side of the of man subduing the earth i'm glad we live on this side you know in the ages before they were bleeding people because they didn't know where diseases came from i'm glad i don't live in that day it's a lot you should be thankful for but but but man the enlightenment of man what what started brother adam said anytime man he says the further he goes towards civilization education he says the further he goes away from god oh i began to think about this and i thought you know here were these people and and these were canaanites they had high places notice they had molten images they had pictures they had groves the bible speaks of these uh altars the bell the altar of belle and the altar of asteroth and the god of el and the god of nebu and you could go and read about all these false gods well it's amazing i was we were having a just a little time with the family yesterday and i said to my children i said where do you think where did this come from where you know when you take man just man and of himself if you separate him from religion you take even the the sentinel island if you're familiar with the sentinel island and the sentinel people it's a aborigine island that a missionary just recently tried to go there on a canoe and was killed these are people these are complete uh who brother adam said in the millennium the but the word the gospel would go to the heathen those who never had a chance to hear of the gospel of jesus christ the whole world will hear and and you hear today and you hear over and over and over and over and over and over and over again that's why jesus says that the men of nineveh will rise up in judgment of this generation they didn't have a bible in nineveh yet they repented at the preaching of jonah yeah this nation is heard preaching and preaching and preaching in sermons and sermons and sermons and they sit in lasciviousness and sin but the sin no people with no god yet they have yet pictures will show you they they have a temple they worship gods they're religious they're spiritual where did they learn that where did where did man learn that from where did he learn to be religious where did cain even cain and abel there was something even in the very beginning that is an eight in every human being there is something inside of everybody that you were made to worship are you with me here this morning it's inside of every single boy little boy or little girl little baby that's born you don't teach them that there's something inside of them because they're created in the image of god they are created to worship god there's a purity that god puts in every life that has a soul and they're to give reverence they're to give aw they're to give worship they are to give their adoration and the whole world is spiritual did you hear me you say brother matt what about the atheist the atheist is spiritual too the atheist is religious too the only difference is his religion is himself so the atheist doesn't worship anything wrong the asia with the atheist worships the difference is he doesn't worship god he worships this right here he worships his intellect and what he thinks god bless you brother will just seen you he worships what he thinks he worships what what what what he's figured out what he's by science or by deduction or by rationalizing has learned but what i'm trying to get you to understand is that there's something in everybody that gives worship to something it's in every person you don't have to teach it they give themselves to something why do you think that as we said the aborigine that the tribes even the indian they worshiped the great spirit brother adam said why they knew there was something before the enlightenment they knew that the indians knew there was there was a higher power you didn't find atheism you didn't find intellectualism that says there's no god and creation was from a big bang and it was all just you know uh you know it was all just everything came from nothing how silly is that the man said i'll believe in the big bang but just tell me who pulled the trigger because when you go back and you go back and you go back and you go back there had to start with something but what was it is that man was created to worship something even these heathens who we read about here they were worshiping a bell they were worshipping in asherah there was something spiritual inside of them because it's inside of every single person to worship something and the entire world today whether they are in a church on sunday morning worshiping the living god or they're worshiping a denominational system that's ruled by the antichrist and brother brandon said they'd go to church thinking they were worshiping god to worship the devil didn't even know it whether they're at a bar stool whether they're in whether they're at a football game whether they're not at church they've never been at church they're worshiping something let me say this to you young people you will worship you will give your worship to something or somebody you will give your worship your adoration you will bow your need to something whether it's a dollar whether it's money whether it's popularity whether it's the culture whether it's drugs or whatever whatever it would be brother branham said that was a pure a pure uh a a desire god put it inside a man in purity but satan will give him every every substitute said satan will give him every substitute to take that pure thirst and quench it with a a a a a a demon spirit something that quenches that thirst inside of him he preached thank you man's filter he says but he says a holy man holy man's taste is the word of god david said this is my portion this satisfies me i don't need anything out there i'm not looking for ever i'm not craving it well you say hell brother matt boy you're you're something it ain't me it's the holy spirit god has taken the taste for the world out of me except for the madness i mean you don't you don't you're not tempted absolutely i still deal with this old flesh here that thirst for the things of god of the of the world as paul said wretched man that i am who shall deliver me but there's something spiritual why do you think you live in the age of of of american idol american americans got america's got talent britain's got talent they got that that talent show is not just in america or britain they've got india's got talent they've got thailand's got talent they've got china's japan's got talent so do you say boy this was this phenomenon because it would come in this generation where the bible says men shall be lovers of their own self it's prophecy it should tell you where you're at but what is it it's to give worship to something why do you think the comic books who marvel studios and the different uh superheroes in the where did superman come from where did where did all these where did these superheroes come from well what with even a little boy from a very young age well there's something that he just takes into a superman or he wants to wear their cape or have some superstar or some super hero what is it it's inside of you because why you needed a superman to save you and it wasn't a man wearing a cape it was a man with nail scarred hands he saved me when i couldn't save myself that's the superman i give my worship to but it's an inside of every single person you want it's inside of every single individual to worship something we can say a lot more on that but we've just got too much to get to then you shall drive out all notice what he says here all the inhabitants of the lamb from before you destroy all their pictures destroy all their molten images quite plugged down all their high places and you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the landfill and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it it's a promise oh but then there's verse 55 but that's a big word but if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy other molten images and quite plug down other high places notice what he says here then you shall drive out i'm in the wrong i mean yeah verse 55 if you will not drive then it shall come to pass that those which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes thorns in your sights notice that that that that curse that god said was going to come upon them if you choose not to it shall be a prick in your eye you know a thorn hitting a a toy a cactus and getting a thorn in my in my in my you know my foot or my leg or my hand could be painful could you imagine in your eyeball and god says that this is that if you don't drive them out what was he saying to drive out not just the people lord you want us to go and annihilate the canaanite the head the the perizzite the hittite you want us to destroy this people because they're they're a wicked people and god says not for your righteousness but for their wickedness do i do this thing it's not about your righteousness it's not about your your works or your good works god says but you're to destroy all of them and you could say hold on lord hold on i told my we were there with my children yesterday i said now wait a minute now why wouldn't have been enough for for for them to to destroy the people you say lord aren't we getting a little carried away you know we're going to just there won't be already told us to to kill them you already told us to destroy them you told us to annihilate them dispossess them and annihilate them or get them off of your property but you want to go further than that lord you want us to destroy their pictures their images their high places which was that were they were they worshiped they're false gods you know what god is trying to say god is starting to say there's more it's not the people that it's not necessarily the person that does the harm it's the culture are you with me here this morning there's a certain culture in the world listen to me young people when you go to school there's a certain culture there's a certain there's a certain way of the world we don't go that way we don't go that way there's a certain culture us in society and god says i want you to destroy it all show their pictures their high places their own images you're not you're to be separate you're to be different i don't want your children amen this is who god said god said i don't want your children those that you love those are the inheritance of the lord i don't want your children affected by the culture that's around them you're to be separate and he says and he says here moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you that as i thought to do unto them now god comes over and god says i want you to destroy everything destroy their high places their images their pictures everything their images because an image has an importance what you gaze upon you become right your diet go to get get a good diet but your diet consists of more what food you eat it also means what movies you watch what music you listen to what places you go what you do on social media what you what you what what your affinities and leagues and affiliations are that's your diet he says destroy it all now god gives this word through moses the prophet and they go over to the land now i want you to to notice this they go over they have all of this you know this hype this this great excitement we're going over everything we've waited for we're going to cross jordan we're going to go over jordan we got joshua to lead us we're going to go over into canaan we're going to dispossess man there was a lot i'm sure a lot of emotion you know i can do this i've got this i got the holy spirit i got the promise of god you know and they're going to go over and drive out now let's see let's let's read the record of what the bible says judges chapter 1 judges chapter 1 verse 19. now this is the record of what took place here's the the the campaigns and the lord was with judah and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain praise god somebody said praise the lord but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had iron chariots of iron now what did god say god said drive out all verse 21 and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin and jerusalem and to this day meaning the day that was written verse 27 and 28 neither did manasseh drive out the inhabitants of beth sheehan in her town's nortanik in her town's door to inhabitants of door in our towns or the inhabitants of iblim in our towns nor the inhabitants of meg they go in their towns you say well just we get the point why why list all of these little cities and we got the point he didn't get he didn't win you see this was a record this was a record of their life thought about this you said brother matt you're preaching you feel like you're preaching at me i'm preaching right here this was a record of their life i i as i read this even early this morning i said lord this was a record of victory or defeat and god was going to list he was going to take time the writer here is going to take time and say he had victory here and here and here but oh but but this spot here no and it seemed he never could get over that sema just went on and on and on and and ibli and no magdago megiddo no and her towns canaanites would dwell verse 29 neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwell in gaza but the canaanites dwelling gazer among them neither did zebulon drive out the inhabitants of catron or the inhabitants of nahalo but the canaanites dwell among them verse 31 neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of echo he list all of these neither did zebulon needed a manasseh uh neither did neptula drive out the inhabitants of beth sheehan or beth shamath north inhabitants it goes on and on and on and and and and and you look at the story and you say now they had a prophet they had a promise they had the word you know what what more did they what more did they need they go over and there's there's no victory this one gets victory up here in the mountain but not in the valley this one over here you know war war could sometimes go a long time and could be long and drawn out you know and you could have a long drawn-out war you said brother i'm just defeated today listen it doesn't matter if your war is long and drawn out just win the war just make sure you come up on the upside and not the downside just don't settle for defeat oh did you hear me church don't settle don't just let the devil stay there in your life even if he's there today don't lose your fight don't lose your intensity don't lose your zeal to say i may not be perfect but i'm striving for perfection i may not have it all but i'm striving to get there lord i'm not going to quit i'm not going to stop i'm not going to slow down i'm going to rid the devil out of my life but they they the bible says all of this now judges chapter 2 judges chapter 2 verse 1 and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bocom notice what notice the way the angel says this an angel of the lord came from the old god of bocom and said i made you now that's a strong word i made you i forced you this was in other words god was attributing this and saying this is what i did i made you to go up out of egypt god said i've heard the cries of my people and i'm coming down to deliver them they were helpless couldn't help themselves but god delivered them and god says i made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you into the land which i swore to your fathers and i said i will never break my covenant with you there's always two sides to every story that god could say now this is what i did but this is what you did now this is what i said but this is what you said and you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall throw down their altars but you have not obeyed my voice let me ask them a question why why why have you done this and no doubt the rebuke comes the the feeling the the let down god says wherefore i also said i will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns and your sides and their gods shall be a trap their gods shall be is that what the bible says there god shall be a snare unto you and it came to pass the story goes on when the angel of the lord spoke these words and to the children of israel that the people lifted up their voice and wept the people lifted up their voice and wept but you know what they didn't do they didn't do anything else they wept the bible doesn't say that they wept and left from there dried off their tears and then drove out the inhabitants of their land no they just wept and sometimes people just weep you know the word of god is so you have to be so careful how when god begins to use words and god uses a sermon god could use anything he could use a prayer he could use an encouragement he could use a phone call a text message from a friend a bible verse that you read something you hear about and god is always always preaching at you even nature's always preaching at you and god says well god said brother madam says that you may not reject the voice of a preacher he's you may not you know you may not ever reject and he brother madam says you may not ever come up and say well i just reject the lord and i just don't want anything to do with jesus you'd say i don't know that would never be remember that but brother adam says but what about that little voice in your heart that's speaking unto you he says do you accept that or do you reject that the prophet says you'll be accountable not not just because you walked away from the faith or said i don't love the lord anymore he says but anytime the voice of god is pulling on your heart tugging on your heart speaking to your heart it's not enough to weep you come under the effect and people come into the effect of the conviction of the preaching which the word of god should be convicting the bible says when when peter preached the sermon they were pricked in their hearts stabbed in their hearts that what shall we do to be saved the word should be considered conviction but beyond conviction it should bring repentance and then repentance true repentance turns to righteousness repentance cleanses and cleans and you get a desire to say i don't just want to be clean and empty i want to be clean and full of the holy spirit they wept they wept they they cried at the words of this angel but the bible goes on in the history that the story just keeps keeps telling it says and the people serve the lord all the days of joshua the people served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived joshua who had seen the great works of the lord that he did for israel and joshua the son of none died the judgement son of the son of the lord died being 110 years old and also all that generation were gathered under their fathers now what's amazing when i read this today or yesterday we were reading it know this struck a chord in my heart and i said it's amazing because here god gives this gives god comes down and he brings this rebuke and chastisement and he and the bible says that that they serve the lord god says it'll be a curse unto you it'll be a snare unto you and here's this here's this here's what the lord the lord gives them this word he says i will no longer drive them out from before you but they shall be pricks in your eyes should be thorn in your eye thorn in your side and shall the the scripture says and shall vex you in the land wherein you live wherein you dwell but you read the next verse and the bible says and the people serve the lord people serve the lord they they they served him all the days that joshua as long as joshua was alive as long as joshua was there as long as the figurehead was there long as the patriarch was there serve the lord joshua dies all the inhabitants his bible says all the inhabitants of the land and all and notice what he says here joshua's servant of the lord died being 110 years old also other generation we're gathered in our fathers also all that notice the bible's going to be real specific here that entire generation serves the lord so who was the curse for not driving out the inhabitants for not tearing down the high places for not destroying the culture for not destroying the images who was it going to affect not the parents but the bible says and there arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor the works which he had done for israel i read this yesterday and i thought an entire generation of people an entire generation is now doesn't know the lord it means the children grow up and because of incomplete victory in parents lives children raises up and they don't know the lord nor the works which he had done and the bible says and they the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and served balaam and they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods the gods of the people this was who they will serve they will serve the gods either the god you put before them or the god of the people around them they forsook the lord their god the god of their fathers they they they they kept their religion but they had lost the way of the of jehovah there rose an entire generation who knew not the lord nor the works of his father they they served they they forsook the lord god of their fathers brought them around the land of egypt followed other gods of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the lord anger now do you realize now why it was a thorn in their side a thorn in their eye do you know why now because parents had to watch with their eyes children not grow up to serve the lord that they rose them or raised them to serve and it was a prick in the eye it was a thorn something they had to see and and the scripture says that entire generation lived lived on but the children the entire generation raises up doesn't know the lord because they don't have victory they forsook the lord and served bell and asked heroth they serve baal and ashtaroth now notice this high place here what does god tell them to do he says when you're to go over there this is this is how you get complete victory this is how you have total victory this is how you overcome you drive out all of the devil you don't leave a portion you don't leave a hint you don't leave a cent you keep him out of your life you resist the devil the bible says submit to god resist the devil and he'll flee from you it's not complicated it's not rocket science it's right here say i want to have a home that serves the lord i want to have children to serve the lord then submit to god resist the devil and he'll flee from your family god says destroy all the high places destroy all the remote images notice what he's what he's going to say here i want you to destroy the culture i want you to destroy everything around you i want you to have no no images no pictures and your bible you'll read in your old testament and i don't believe i've never seen it in the new testament maybe it is stand correction but you'll read about this high places and you read about it especially in the book of kings you start it start you hear about it at first in the life of the man who we preached on last sunday night and sunday morning solomon you read it uh 117 times in the old testament the bible mentions high places yesterday i was speaking you know and i said i said now what were these high places you know what what what did it represent and the bible says that a high place was a center for uh canaanite idolatry an idol idolatry and an idol worship the jews the bible says that god had commanded them you shall have no other gods before me but the canaanites these these spiritual people this religious this this culture that was in the world all around them the bible says that these high places you'll read about them over and over and over again they that the hebrew word for a high place is the word bama and it simply means a mountaintop or an open air elevated no which we call a knoll back home like a hill and it's in and anytime you'd enter to a city you enter tucson long before you see the metropolitan well long before you come to the city center you you see city limits welcome to tucson city limits and maybe they'd have a picture maybe you know some some some plants there something that would welcome you well this is what canaanites had and hit titan and jebusites in their cities they would have great mounds built and as you came into the city you'd see this great mountain smoke you know no doubt coming in fire maybe on the top of the mountain of a sacrifice something they were worshiping this is what a high place was it was a canaanite way of worship and the bible says that in first kings the canaanites built for themselves high places and sacred pillars and asheram on every high hill and beneath every luxurant tree even this is what god is saying when moses says destroy it annihilate it tear it down tear all their high places down rip all the pictures this uh annihilate it dispossess it completely destroy it and god warns them it says destroy it you know what what are those high places that god is god is speaking of it's the bible says the bible says it this way casting down vain imaginations or any high thought any thinking that that conflicts with the word of god what is a high place today it's right here we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities spiritual wickedness and high places what are high places high places is where you think the atmosphere you live in the atmosphere you dwell in and the bible says that now god moses has destroyed them but but but for years solomon is going to introduce something as we said the very twilight of his of his life not the beginning not not as he was a young man and he served the lord but at the end of his life as we preached last sunday he gets concubines and wives and and they defile him through their gods because they weren't jewish girls he didn't marry within the faith he married outside of he unequally yoked himself and the scripture says that solomon brings in these high places and now for 800 years 800 years 800 years because solomon you never find this in david david's tabernacle you'll never find david introducing high places you find david doing a lot of wrong things but you won't find that but solomon introduces this way of worship this hybriding this mixing he brings in this other religion's way and the bible says for years it plagues the family of god for years 800 long years you have you find this in the scripture i want you to look here with me in this first one in jehovah's now this was a king i don't know who the writer was of kings but the bible says that kings that the writer of kings wrote it this way he would write this was after remember kings comes after judges so you have judges judges what was before judges you have moses telling them destroy the high places don't leave anything then you go through and what did what what do you find after we read there in judges too and then our generation raises up and you keep reading there it says god sent them judges who would begin to deliver them out of the hand of their enemy the philistines and but now here comes here comes david and all through david then through solomon then you have all of these you have all of these kings who rules the over over uh over israel you have prophets that come to israel you have priests the age of priests and you have the age of kings and jesus fulfilled all three that's why he was a prophet he was a priest and he was a king he was saying i'm i'm all of it to you i'm the consummation of every single bit of it but but these under this age of kings solomon would are the writer of not solomon but the writer of kings would say and in the year of this man and in this third year and this fourth month king began this king began to reign over israel he reigned this many years his mother name was zebedee of this land over here and then he would always listen he'd say and he did that which was and it would even either be right or it would be wrong or evil he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord or he would say and he did that which was good a right in the sight of the lord all of his days were in this man instructed him and he and he'd list and then he'd go on and say then this man dies then another king raises up and this man did right now i want you to read here now remember a high place solomon introduces it for 800 years now you see this i want you to notice this in your bible follow along with me jehovah in the seventh year second kings 12 12 in the seventh year of jehu jehosh began to reign and 40 years reigned he in jerusalem his mother's name was zibiya of beersheba and jehosh did that which was say it together right amen johash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all his all his days were in either priest instructed him but it sounded good but there's a problem there's an elephant in the room but the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places you had this much victory did that was right on the side of the lord let's go to another one amaziah psychics 14 in the second year of joash son of jehovah's king of israel reigned a messiah the son of joash king of judy was 25 years old he began to reign right 29 years in jerusalem his mother's name was jehovah and he did verse 3 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord yet not like david hold on a minute david wasn't his f we just read david wasn't this man's mother it wasn't he did his this is his father david notice this notice what the bible is going to say here i love this he did that which was right yet not like david his father he did according to all things as joash his father did how be it the high places or not taken away that's why he didn't worship the lord like david's tabernacle worship the lord not that he wasn't a good man not that he wasn't a good person not that he wasn't godly it's just he didn't worship the lord in the way that david worshipped the lord he worshipped the lord the way his father worshipped the lord as zariah uzziah notice this in the 20th and seventh year of jeroboam king of israel began azariah the son of amazing king of judah 16 years old what a young boy he was when he began to reign and he reigned 22 and 50 years in jerusalem and he verse 3 did that which was say it together right in the sight of the lord according to all according to all that his father amaziah had done save accept but the high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burn instant steal in the high places notice what the scripture keeps going to even jotham in the second year of peak of the sun in the second year of peak of the son of remeliah king of israel began jotham son of uzziah judah to reign five and 20 years old wasn't begin to reign verse 34 he did that which was right in the sight of the lord he did according to all that his father it was very easy for son to do what dad did it was very easy for as much victory as mom and dad could get it was natural son would also get that much victory but wherever dad stopped sun stopped are you catching the picture here wherever the previous generation got to that's where the last generation was held back to wherever father do you see the importance dads do you see the importance moms do you see the importance church do you see the importance this morning the testimony not what we say with our lips but the testimony of the fruits of our life will be the sermon that our children hear it won't be the sermon they'll hear things i say they'll hear my types and my different quotes i read they'll see my hands waving they'll hear my voice but they'll they'll come under the influence of what sermon you're living not the sermon i'm preaching and wherever father could get victory as far as he could go the son oh yeah he he went that far how be it no notice verse 35 how be it the high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burnt incense still in the high places he built the higher gate of the house of the lord over and over as far as he went as far as he could get was as far in the ways let me just say it to you very simply dad you're a leader whether you realize it or not mom you're a leader whether you realize it or not and a leader can only lead someone to somewhere they've already been themself if you tell me how do you get to you know uh nogales i've never i've been maybe maybe close but i couldn't tell you i've never been there but take someone who has you know you want that as your leader not me so brother matt how do you how do you get to you know this place over here in in nevada well i've never been there but maybe someone who has can lead you there i could try but you know what we're gonna do we're gonna get lost we're gonna make a lot of u-turns a leader can only lead you to where he's been so if if if there's to be spiritual teenagers if you want the let me say it this way say i want my children filled with the baptism of the holy ghost how many mothers would say that with an uplifted hand and a heart would say lord i want that more than anything else for my children i want them filled and sealed into your kingdom i don't want them destroyed with the wicked world i want them raptured out of here i want them to have heaven as their home i want an eternal inheritance for my children we can all say that today then let me say this to you that we must make sure that the example this generation of what we testify of what we believe about the message what we believe about the bible what we believe about christ we've got to make sure we've been there first give the lord a handclap of praise hallelujah he's worthy of it he deserves it [Applause] say i want that more than anything in life it's important as far as he could go oh i thought it was so amazing where did my clicker go brother branham tells a story paradox and i've read this here before he begins to tell about a boy and this boy's dating this girl and he does something awful to her and and the prophet of god they call him in and they say we just want to know what's wrong with our son and and and so brother adam starts now now what you don't read from the story that that i'll give you a little uh tidbit here just a little insider information this was brother branham's nephew now he doesn't tell that but this is his nephew he's referring to his his own nephew now listen to what he says he says for instance a few days ago i was caught in on a scene of little something going on there was a fine young man very fine boy he was going with a girl little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl as much as had promised her to do a certain thing and then he didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do it just wasn't in him to do it and the father and mother called me to the scene and said we would desire to know what is wrong with our boy now it's not easy to do some time but you must be truthful and honest i'm glad he was truthful and honest it must be truthful and honest therefore the boy was a christian now you've got to follow real closely here brother branham delineates he separates this year the boy was a christian boy notice as far as a believer he had repented been baptized and had his position among the believers but yet had not received the baptism of the holy spirit that means you could be a christian you'd be believer be baptized even repent what is what does this baptism save you no does repentance save you no it's all of all of all of it's a work of salvation brother madam says but he had not received the baptism of the holy spirit no matter how much he thought he had you think and you have it and having it is two different things can you say amen to the word you might be able to try to say you have and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing hello somebody unless your life is vindicating what you're professing how do i know the holy ghost i believe the message well the devil believes the message it's getting the holy ghost saying i believe the message no brother madam says if your life isn't vindicating what is the proof that you can say amen to every word and it's not a verbal amen i believe it that settles that that doesn't do anything for you my brother my sister saying amen to the word of god is what mary did when she said be it unto me lord and she received the word which was christ what is the evidence that mary received the holy ghost what is the evidence that she was pregnant she didn't need to prove it it was living outside of her it was visible to everybody brother branham says and now having it notice what he says you might be able to show some evidence of emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still don't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump run sensations speaking in tongues or shouting life has to vindicate it or whatever you might lay it upon which is all right it's all right it's good but he says i believe in all of that too but unless your life not your word not the verbal things you speak not the church you go to not where you pay your tithes unless your life unless your life oh you say brother matt what are you preaching i'm saying lord i'll just raise my hands now and say let my life vindicate what i believe lord let it be more than just lip i believe it i'm not ashamed of it i'm proud to say i believe it i believe the message with all my heart i believe in christ with all my heart but lord let my life vindicate to the world what i believe that's what will save the sinner that's what will save your unsaved loved one that's what'll get them in the house of god and fill them with the holy ghost it won't be what you say it's what you live he says unless your life copes with the word he says unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells you what it is jesus says by their fruit you shall know them now this young fellow not only goes back to the boy now this young fellow this young fellow's parents his mother is german now why does he go to the parents because brother branham understands generational curses or generational blessings you know you're the family you come from where you come from you a lot of i'm i i'm a living example i i'm i am i'm not some are not as fortunate but i say i'm blessed today to have a parent a mother and a father who served the lord who raised me in the admonition of the lord blessed today generation of my children as a reflection of the generation of my grandmother my grandfather who sat in brother branham's meetings uh that and not just because they were there but the testimony in life that they lived bled into the life of my dad filled him with the holy ghost when he was a young man raised his children that way what is it a generational blessing and and brother brandon begins to go to his parents and he says now his mother was notice this his mother's german i hope you're not german today i'm just kidding no reflection on the german but there's a strain in that family a strain that's what he calls it a strain in that family and that is they'll just sit you could talk to them they'll just stare at you right in the face some people do that in church you preach to them and they just stare at you right in the face you're not sure what they're thinking i like when i talk to someone i like them to go uh-huh yeah yeah and when i preach to somebody i would like them to say amen amen that's right i believe that brother says they'll just sit there and they'll stare at you he says and you can talk to them they'll just stare right in your face in the face they got this girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister i've come down the street many morning and this young lady be sitting out in the yard i'd say good morning to you she just look at me i'd stop and i'd say sure fine morning she'd just stand look right at you an intelligent woman and i'd say come up to see us sometime she'd just stand and look well her brothers are that way and here's why father and mother are that way a prophet of god in one place called it the i think he calls it the grab bag or the bag he says the grab bag of life he says sometimes you get certain traits just out of the grab bag of life nothing you even did to deserve it he spoke about men who were high passion he said maybe that was bled down from another generation a man a father with a temper and he says and that would affect the children and affect the children's children affect the next generation you see it's generational and brother random even picks it up and he says you he says you girls here that are sitting there and he had some girls who were disrespectful when he was preaching he said you sit there and you dress his skin tight like that he said a slick going up your skirt he said why do you do that he says your mother she was a choir a flapper and he said and she did that then you watched that and that's what you became and your mother was a choir girl and he says what is it it's a generational curse it passes down from one generation to the next generation and he says but also a generational curse he said there's a generational reward he said look at levi he said who paid ties to melchizedek that's what brother brandon said he was attributed to him because of something his father did right god attributes the righteousness to him you say brother matt what's it take it takes one person to take a stand for jesus christ in that family and say i'm this far it's came and it's not going to go any further i'm going to choose to be different and you know what it'll do it'll affect not just you and affect your children and your children's children the next generation brother branham says it was his father notice what he says he says she just stand and look he says well our brothers are that way father mothers that way now the father thought she was getting off the hook dad father the boy is strictly an irishman it's his family it's brother branham's family strictly an irish man and he says moody high tempered high strung that's his whole family like that except one other out of the family converted say what makes the difference conversion makes the difference jesus makes the difference he says now in this this boy the father and his mother both are christians filled with the holy ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the lord and now the young man is about 17 18 years old something along there very fine kid he's been a real model boy at home nice kid he's got a brother that's just vice versa amazing you can have one in one family and the other family and just totally opposite and brother branham says but the girls the mother's family lives close to the a fine church but do you think they'd ever come over there no he goes back to the mother you've got to follow it he says now the mother says she goes to this fine church you know he says but this this father his church oh would they ever come oh no they'd never darken the door brother random says he says find church but do you ever think they'd come up no and they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning they just won't do it it's just not in them now the genes in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they who's he's speaking of mom and dad no matter how much they are converted still remains the flesh that's been interbred out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him brother man it says the grab bag of life is things that you didn't even ask for it's inside of you you didn't ask for it but it's been interbred into you and there's none of us that has holy blood all of us are just a mixed bag of all kinds of things all of us here i care how righteous you're for how if they were righteous they were saved filled with the holy ghost but no matter how good you think you're you know how spotless your family was i guarantee you we we all come from we all come from for all fallen flesh and fallen clay and marred human beings every single one of us and all of us has different complexes and different strains brother branham says and your strain my strain is not better than your strain and your strength is not better than mine say what does that mean that means i've got something to overcome you've got something to overcome i may not have to overcome what you have but you don't have to overcome what i have so don't try to tell me how to overcome what's strange in mind i won't tell you how to overcome what's in yours you say what do we need we all need the holy spirit individually not collectively to each person and he says it stands for the father and mother no matter how they're converted therefore the boy's got a complex just like the mother's family they're not forgiving they won't apologize that's where the boy stands now i said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up i said now look at you out of your family all of them drunks fighting shooting cutting that's brother branham's own family he's speaking of all of them drunk shooting cutting remember my brother and i'm talking about his own daddy looks at him and says that's the only boy i've got you imagine having a father like that brother man says is it just a bootlegger a drunk alcoholic and he says i said now look at you your family drunks fighting shooting cutting so forth now look at your family to the mother brother adam says this there are a bunch of people just sit there won't speak very independent so forth irreverent to religion but i said it's not you it says but it's not you now your family mother there are germans they're like that but not you and he says they're people they said he says but i said it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you're sweet you're kind forgiving what does that your tree part of that family tree yet you have received the holy ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people i love that so much it's not your people anymore it's your christ that lives inside of you i say lord i don't i don't want my people anymore the spirit of the world anymore i want the christ inside of me that's what makes the difference i said to the boy look at your family this is the father practically all the drunks so far they said and how moody how high tempered high high strong but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the holy spirit you're no more what you are it's christ in you how many could say i want that this morning i don't want to be anymore how i am i want christ in me to change me break the generation off i've got a strain in my family a complex in my family god can free you of that today god can set you free of that today he'll make you a new creature in christ jesus i said we're not americans i'm not a republican i'm not a democrat not neither i'm a christian because i've been changed i've been reborn i'm not who i used to be he says now what is it the holy spirit you're no more you are i said now that's this now he says i said now the same that same thing has to happen to your son and the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of jesus christ water baptism in the pool said i know my son has come to christ i said that may be all right all the outward emotions he might be identified as a believer with the believers but until he is regenerated born again what burns and annihilates the old nature the new birth to be borne by the spirit of god say where does that start it starts with repentance it's it comes to baptism what does baptism do it cleanses you it cleans you it gives you a fresh you say what is what is baptism brother matt what does water represent water represents two things water represents death water represents life what comes first and first in life water same water that gives life can also kill the waters of separation of jordan we're representing death baptism what is it represented it's a cleansing of the conscience you know what real baptism is baptism is grace for dirty people and i was a dirty person but god saved me i was dirty but i know for the filth of the world in my own mind but god gave me grace i'm so thankful for amazing grace and that cleansing repenting led to a sanctified of my life and then god sealed me with the baptism of the holy ghost say brother matt does it take one year maybe does it take ten maybe but maybe it takes one second one moment it doesn't have to be a long drawn-out process it could happen like that as he yeah as no cornelius's house as peter yet spoke these words the holy ghost fell upon them and he testified this is the same thing they received at pentecost until he's regenerated born again i'll advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ comes in i love the wisdom of brother branham he says until that gentle forgiving sweet spirit i recommend him i'd recommend don't marry make a woman's life miserable why just like that high place the thing that cursed no matter how good you are no matter how good of a boy he was no matter how nice it was good model boy good kid at home but unless that spirit of christ comes in and changes him the only thing that can change him is i recommend him not to marry he'd make a woman's life miserable you know how divorce happens separation happens because two people took took things you know what god says god says to moses we just read it he says destroy the molten images pluck down all the high places he says and then dispossess and then dwell notice the order god says don't go over there and live and build houses and then say hey you got to leave he says because if you do they'll vex you in the land wherein you live and when you take something i don't know why i'm saying this but i'm going to obey the holy spirit here before you're married you better you better say lord i want to read out and root out everything that's unlike you lord i don't want to take this into my marriage and let it vex me in the land of my marriage i want to deal with it now say brother matt what's your recommendation what's the prerequisite for marriage get the baptism of the holy ghost makes all the difference means you'll have a perfect marriage wrong answer but it means it won't be two it'll be three two individuals it'll be three who unify into one you could always consult that third person you can always go to him and say lord i we need you right now brother adam says in forgiveness till the spirit of christ comes in then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it he can't do it friend in your best of intellectuals you will never overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it christ will have to overcome it when he lets christ in then he's already overcome it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the spirit of god because he tears down the high place there was one man a man named two men actually but we're gonna read a one hezekiah remember those kings we read about we're closing right here now that came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of eli allah king of israel the hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign 25 years old to begin to reign he reigned 29 years in jerusalem his mother's name was abby the daughter of zechariah and he did that which was say it together right in the sight of the lord but there's going to be a difference between hezekiah and azariah and uzziah notice what the bible says he did that which was right in the sign of the lord according to all that david his father wasn't david but god traces the lineage and says you're going to go remember what brother branham said it's not your parents anymore it goes beyond that generation before you now it goes to your father christ and you reflect your father christ you're looking you look like your father you talk like your heavenly father the bible says he did that which was right in the sign of the lord according to all that david his father did the very next verse he removed the high places and broke the images and cut down the groves and broke into pieces the brazen serpent why because he was how was any different brother that was any different than azerite no was it any different than usain no was it different than the amish mri no it wasn't any different than any of them the only difference was he had a father who didn't serve the lord but hezekiah said i'm not going to go just as far as the previous generation because i can do all things through christ who gives me strength and i choose to break that generational curse out of my life i choose to break it here and i'm not going to let it go any further you ever tried to give something up you ever tried to give something up sometimes you give things up other times you try to give things up you try and you try and you try you come back time and time and time again failure time and time and time again tried it so many times try to get rid of that sin like a little thistle like a little thorn it grew back even stronger in your life and people could get to the point where they give up musicians could you come i want you to know i'm finished here musicians people get to the point to where they they get discouraged and they give up no matter what it is in their life no matter what vice or what sin enemy throws it right back in your face all the way from solomon all the way to hezekiah you have 30 kings 30 men if you could play something softly you have 30 men 30 kings from solomon to hezekiah 30 12 kings of judah 18 notice and all of those failed to remove failed to go further always came back to that one thing even good men asa was a good man ace a lot of them is life joseph fat take good kings good men but that high place that little thing always stayed there something something in his life just couldn't figure it out didn't know why [Music] but there came a there came something inside of hezekiah's heart as a young man bow your head's with me every head bowed ever i closed [Music] somewhere inside hezekiah's heart god began to do a work it's a work of the holy spirit it's the same work that needs to happen in every teenager under the sound of my voice every young person maybe you're not a teenager maybe you're later down in life somewhere christ has got to come in and make the difference though he's trying his best to overcome it with all his intellect he's trying he's trying greater teeth iron will trying brother adam says but he can't he'll never overcome it christ will have to come and overcome it that's what makes the difference [Music] lord jesus bow my head today father [Music] knowing lord that your word was your word that it went forth and i know lord jesus that it dropped down into avenues beyond avenues of people's heart it went to addresses and knocked on the door [Music] and i pray lord as it knocks on that heart this morning that that that one individual maybe two maybe three whatever whoever it is not to me i got my head bowed my eyes closed i'm not even going to look lord lord but i pray father if the word knocked on that heart that there would be a response [Music] there would be something lord that down inside of the inside of the inside maybe it has to go past all the layers and layers and layers and layers what we thought what's happened where we feel like we are [Music] i pray lord that that word would that individual would respond that's all lord they could in whatever re whatever way they respond lord as long as they respond i pray it'd be more than just weeping be more than just a conviction be more than just a even just lord a intellectual faith but lord let him respond with his with the zeal of the holy spirit to say lord i'm removing the high places out of my life i'm cutting down the groves i'm tearing down the culture i'm going to rip down the society i'm going to serve the lord god of uh lord the the same god who saved me the same god who sanctified me the same god who filled me with the spirit i'm going to live a testimony to my children i want to live a testimony more than what i tell them but my life i want them to see i'm not perfect i'm by no means perfect i got all kinds of mistakes i want them to see that lord i want my children to know i'm messed up as messed up as anybody could be but jesus has made a difference in my life and he can make a difference in your life if you'll just let him if you'll let him in today he'll change you oh he'll make you a new creation in christ he'll take all those old habits all those sins all those things he'll he'll take it if you'll give it to him he'll break that generational strain if you'll give it to him granted lord jesus we pray father to every heart every life
