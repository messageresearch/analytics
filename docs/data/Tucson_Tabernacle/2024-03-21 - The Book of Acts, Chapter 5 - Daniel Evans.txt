good it's good to have you I don't see I don't see any other visitors um Olivia you're not a visitor God bless you um it's a good service this morning I was so thankful to see um these those three Souls come to baptism it was it was a blessing to me brother Manny the young man that was baptized first as I said this morning he talked to me after service on on Sunday last week and he said brother he said the Lord's been working on my heart he said I'd like to be baptized and I said well it's funny you say that that I plan on speaking on the new birth and about baptism maybe the next week so let's let's plan on that and then um I was walking back here before service this morning I like to go back um to the back and shake the brother's hands that are that are doing the um the monitors and stuff and as I was turning the corner Heath catches me and he goes he goes hey brother he says uh um can I talk to you for a minute I said yeah so we stepped aside he goes it was he goes bro I need to be baptized and I said good I said how about this morning goes uh like this morning I said yeah how about this morning I said I said there's somebody else going to be baptized he goes well um he says yeah he says um just in my clothes like this and I said well we have we have stuff up there so then he uh it made me feel good and then as we were calling for the baptism this morning then it was really nice to see that sister come up there and and wanting to give wanting to change your life and give her heart to the Lord you can see she struggles you can you can tell that she's struggled in her life maybe had a hard life and um the drugs and living living in that area of society and wanting a change she told somebody after service she said she says now she says I want a job she doesn't want to fix my teeth she says I I just I want to change and I thought hey man you know his sister and it really encouraged me sister Amelia caught me after service and she said bro Daniel she says I wanted to tell you a testimony she says about about the sister that was baptized this morning she said she asked me she said I'd like to talk to the pastor about baptism and she's a brother I haven't had a chance to tell you yet so thank the lord we got to get to preach a sermon on it and and she followed that call friends when these people come we have to have patience they're not they may many of them maybe haven't come up like we've come up they haven't had the Privileges that we've had being talked though the way that we've taught been taught and and we see that maybe they might not act like we Act but have patience because this is a soul that God loves just as much as he loves you or me so so when these people come in remember that that's what we're here for we're here to bring them to this cross right here uh brother uh Kevin and I on Friday night we had that Gathering out at the um at the park and brother Kevin and I um we're talking with brother Isaac osario as a pastor of the church um down they're down by the airport Spanish Church and just he is if you haven't met brother Isaac he is just a precious precious brother but I was talking with him and I said um I said brother Isaac what have you been preaching on lately and he said uh brother he says we started preaching on the book of Acts he says we've got through the first two chapters I was like yes you know we don't want to over spiritualize something you know and we don't we don't want to say we don't have to give as I've I said many times we don't want to give God credit for something that he didn't do or think that something's a sign when it when it's really not but man that is encouraging really really just a little blessing from our Lord it may not be a miracle or some great thing but I believe it's God sending down his little love letters and telling us that that he loves us now back to the book of Acts I love this book I I love I love everything about it I just I see that we can place ourselves in this and first a little bit a little bit of a review um Acts chapter 3 really really important miracle happened you remember what it was Am I by myself what happened the miracle at the gate called Beautiful right and we had this man that all of these people knew God chose him to have this miracle happen he'd been crippled since he was born and and the Lord Peter and John came to him and Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have I give to you rise up and walk and the man that had been crippled for his whole life over 40 years rose up in the name of the Lord Jesus and the key to all of that is everybody sought and then we move on to Acts chapter 4 and I talked about we have these two different um groups in Judaism we have these these two different priests remember who they are Pharisees and the Sadducees you remember who were with with the do you remember who didn't believe in the resurrection the Sadducees and they then we have the Pharisees and they were they were they were the Sadducees were the temple workers they were the priests in the temple the sagitt the Pharisees were spread out around Judea and they were like the local pastors and the the Pharisees were the ones that gave Jesus probably the most trouble at the beginning when he was there but then these these Sadducees they agreed with the Pharisees to crucify Jesus now these Sadducees now that Jesus was resurrected these Sadducees start saying hey we don't believe in a resurrection so you're preaching something that's false when you're preaching the resurrection and Peter and in his sermons he just really stuck it to him he says he says the one that you crucified rose from the dead and we see that this in Acts chapter 4 we see that here we have the first persecution that starts among this newly formed Christian Church here at Jerusalem and let's let's go back to to Leia Foundation let's go back to Acts chapter 4 verse 29 and start reading there and now this is a this is the brother's preaching when they when they'd come back from being persecuted and now Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus now that's how important you know we've talked many times we talk about miracles Miracles are important an important part of Christianity there are important part of our belief because one of the reasons right here in the book of Acts it shows that there is an almighty God that's alive and living and it's not just this intellectual conception that these Pharisees and Sadducees had this God is alive and he's this Jesus Christ came and he showed these things happen and now this Same Spirit that was in Christ is in their Ministry so you see when Jesus was here it was limited to this one man and then when the Holy Spirit fell back to Acts chapter 2 that same Spirit of Christ came down and it dwelt in human beings and then to put it in in modern terms then the ministry and healings went viral it went everywhere and it started here in Jerusalem and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one Soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which possessed was his own but they had all things in common look at the unity in the church and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought them and brought brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need and Joseph who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas which is being in interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the country of Cyprus now Cyprus is an island that's north and west of Israel south of Turkey having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet it's the end of chapter four now let's go to chapter five Acts chapter 5. but that's a rough way to start a chapter but so we know something good is not going to happen here a certain man named ananias with Sapphira his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet notice that they just kept back part of it they they didn't keep back all of it they didn't it was just it was just this this one part that they kept back and I talked this morning about a new birth and we think about if you apply that really quickly to our walk with the Lord you see ananias and Sapphira they were willing to give everything that was theirs in the first place they were willing they said that they were going to give everything except one little bit of it and it's like our walk with the Lord we can we can say Lord I'm going to follow you I'm going to serve you but if we don't completely give everything to him to give all of our heart to him then it's not enough Jesus requires everything he said he tells the disciples earlier he said take up your cross and follow me that cross Jesus gave it all he gave any talents that he had he gave any any type of potential that he had he gave everything for the gospel and those bloody footprints that he walked he said now you take up your cross and you walk in these same footprints but Peter said ananias why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land whilst it remained was it not thy own and after it was sold was it not the in thine power own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart thou Hast not lied unto men but unto God now notice this is an important part of this there's Cults and groups that can take this scripture and form these things that are not right notice that ananias is very plain here he was not required to give anything that wasn't that wasn't part of the deal that wasn't they weren't they weren't compelling people to give anything this man Barnabas he did it of his own choosing and you know you see like today it's real popular and it started with the televangelists way back I don't know 20 or 30 years ago where they're always trying to get the people's money they're always trying to get the people to give to make an offering or or to to put more money in the in the plate and and to and to write a check oh if you give a check for this much then you'll receive 10 times that amount that's not anywhere in this Bible it it's not there when these brothers when they made a sacrifice to give to the church it was gone that was a sacrifice otherwise if you're saying well if you if you give this amount of money then you're going to win the lottery no no no no then you're benefiting from it and it's not a sacrifice anymore these brothers and sisters they gave freely and with this ananias and Sapphira they maybe saw Barnabas and and this man and how respected he was and they saw that Barnabas took this money and and gave it and then maybe they said you know what for our own standing we're gonna give this amount of money and it looks to me like because they kept back some that at the very beginning their motives are wrong they they maybe and it doesn't say this but it seemed like they wanted the respect of the church so they they gave this money but they made a pact between themselves that hey let's we'll sell it for this much we'll give the church this much and uh and then we just won't tell them they're not telling them was the mistake that was that was the big thing they own the land and you can see right here that they're under no obligation to give anything really but they own this land and they said we've given everything and it wasn't the right it wasn't the right statement and that is why this persecution that's why that this happened to ananias and Sapphira ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear Came Upon all them that heard these things now this is the third miracle that has happened that's recorded in the book of Acts the first one as I mentioned on in Acts chapter 3 was was at the gate called Beautiful when the crippled man was healed and then in Acts chapter 4 that they were they were thanking the lord for for suffering persecutions and there was they were worshiping and then the place that they were in this whether it be a it was a building it was a church or a house or something this place shook with the power of the holy spirit because they were in just such unity and as it seems like God was just so pleased so then we see that this third miracle happened and the young men arose and wound them up and carried them out and buried him and it was not this about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in and Peter had answered answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much and she said yeah for so much and Peter said unto her how is it that you have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out and she fell down and she died right there and and we see right here I want to I want to point something out that we as Believers and and as people that highly regard brother branham's message we have we have seen that he had this just powerful and wonderful gift of what we call discernment other people call it the the gift of knowledge but when people would come up to the platform he was able to maybe never meeting them before he could say your name is Lyle Johnson you have done this and this and this go and be healed in the name of the Lord Jesus and people took what brother Branham did took that gift and brother Branham called that gift he said that that was the sign of the Messiah but they have taken that gift and they have said that this brother Branham maybe is in that position because of this gift was so powerful but I want to point out right here that the Apostle Peter had the same gift and did the exact same thing to ananias and Sapphira then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up The Ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband and great fear Came Upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things I'll bet it did you think about what just happened these people they lied a simple lie and they were struck down probably in front of other people we know that there was other people there that carried them out and you got to think if that would happen here in the Tucson Tabernacle and that spirit is here in the same spirit of God is here imagine if that happened here at the church and then imagine if you witnessed to someone afterwards be like hey you know a friend you have a co-worker at work you gotta come to the Tabernacle here's what happened these two people came up and they lied about about some money that they were said they were going to give and they didn't give all of it and then they all they died right there come to church it'll be great think about that but there was also that church was growing there was the power of the Holy Spirit there to where those people saw that happen and all of these Miracles were just starting and there was unity in the church and love in the church and people wanted they wanted to be there where are we at verse number 12. and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch and the rest there's no man join himself to them but the people magnified them and the Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women um remember let me stop right here and it just came to mind that um I mentioned that Luke wrote This Book of Acts and he also wrote the the um the Gospel of Luke one thing Luke does is many times and you see it in the verse I just read Luke mentions women while the other gospels don't really mention the women as much and in the book of Acts it often includes the women but you have to look at the author Luke who was who who spoke Greek the other the other brothers Matthew mark and John they were Hebrews they were they were writing this from a Hebrew perspective this Luke is writing this for the gentile people and the Gentiles while the Jews don't include women in genealogies and all that you'll see that Luke does because the Gentiles the Romans and the Greeks and all of them they didn't see the same as as the Jews did they revered women in a different way that they were that um not that they were more important but they were more part of it so you'll see again you'll see Luke again mentions women well the other gospels might just say men and and it's or the the Old Testament or the um some of the other Epistles might just say men but Luke is playing in saying women also let's see where are we at verse number 15. let me let me go back to 14. and believers were the more added and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes of both men and women and so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them what a testimony to Peter now was Peter's Shadow anointed I don't I don't see that but Peter lives such a life before these people and he had such a spirit about him and they had such confidence in Peter that just they just wanted to be in his presence and they know that it wasn't Peter but it was the presence that Peter had and the Lord the holy spirit that was promised was upon Peter and if they could just come into Peter's presence and just his shadow they had the faith that they would be healed it's it's really it's very similar to to Jesus when he was walking along and that little lady that had the blood issue the bleeding and how she she just revered him so much she had heard so much about the Lord Jesus and she said if I could just touch that tassel that that him of His Garment hanging down she said if I could just touch that I know I will be healed and he comes by and she goes over and touches it and immediately she's healed and Jesus says he says strength has gone out of me and he says sister your faith your faith has made you whole she had faith that that if she could touch that garment we see in Acts chapter 19 that will come to later on that they took from the garments of Paul and they they took him and they said this is just with Paul and and laid it on the people and the people were healed just from his government Was His Garment anointed it was the spirit that Paul had and that faith that they have it was a point of Faith the same thing that we when we anoint with oil we take the oil and we anoint the people and it represents that of the Holy Spirit and it becomes a point of faith for us to increase that Faith that's why you see so many different ways of healing you see the the Gentile coming coming to to Lord Jesus and he says I'm not worthy it's you even come under my house and Jesus said I haven't seen such great faith in Israel and Jesus just spoke the word there in other places he had to come and lay his hands on and in other places we see laying a garment from from Paul or anointing with oil it is anything that helps that is gives us that point of faith and it's by the grace of God how wonderful that he gave us so many things in this word that we can receive our healing because he wants to heal us there came also a multitude out of the Cities round about Jerusalem bring sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone that's that is beautiful every single one would come and be healed there also came a multitude I just said that then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the Sadducees and were filled with indignation and they laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison but the angel of the Lord by Night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life now the gospel is being openly proclaimed they weren't ready to go out and do this before Acts chapter 2. before this Holy Spirit said fell but now that they're filled with the Holy Ghost God puts them on display in front of the people brother Branham said many times he said that these people going out and preaching with signs following them is the gospel on display are his words and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the Senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told saying the the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keeper standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man Within now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them whereunto this would grow think about this it's like oh great you know first this guy gets healed at the Temple Gate brother so and so Mr so-and-so gets healed at the Temple Gate then the walls of their Church shake with power of the Holy Ghost then those that couple that lied they dropped dead and then all of these other people are being healed what is going on here then then came one and told them behold the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people I can't win for losing brother then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned look at this they uh they say they're they're gonna go They're gonna go take these people and they say hey preacher hey priest listen wait a minute these guys have preached deliverance from your nonsense these guys I was in that building maybe when those walls shook I knew brother so and so when he was at the gate called Beautiful there at the temple I remember him from years and years ago he was always crippled I knew his mom and his dad I know all of them and now you're gonna take these people and you're gonna throw them in prison are you going to beat them no you're not so they say well we'll bring them without violence would you mind Peter and John would you mind coming with us people are there what are you gonna do well would you mind coming with us so they go and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them saying did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this name and behold you have filled Jerusalem with your Doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us Peter and John were like oh oh sorry we forgot we forgot you told us that yeah I'm sorry we we it's a bit it's a mistake no Oh and about the filling Jerusalem with this Doctrine can you imagine brother Jonathan can you imagine filling Tucson with this Doctrine can you imagine feeling Lusaka with this doctrine that Jesus Christ is risen from the dead and people are getting healed and they say you're filling you're filling this whole city with this Doctrine and then they say this and this Burns me and intend to bring this man's blood upon us speaking of Jesus look who is speaking just a few weeks earlier they said let his blood be upon us and our children and now they're afraid that they're going to get some rocks thrown at them so they're saying now now you're bringing this man's blood upon us how soon they forgot what they did to the Lord Jesus what a shame oh you know these people that they were oppressing that they were that they were holding under their their rule probably scaring them to death all the time and preaching things this these fear tactics said oh if you go do this or if you go do that you're going to be you're going to be cast out or whatever and now they're afraid because they pick up a few rocks and they're going to throw them at them then Peter and the other despite this the other Apostles answered and said we ought to obey God rather than men huh I think I might have I don't know that what they said you're bringing this man's blood upon us how dare they say that when just a few weeks earlier they said let his blood be upon us the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you slew and hanged on a tree him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel and and forgiveness of sins look at how sweet this message is and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him and when they when they heard that they were cut to the heart and they took counsel to slay them then stood there up one in the Council of Pharisees a fair of the a Pharisee named gamalia Gamaliel a doctor of the law had her had in reputation among them among all the people and commanded to be to put the apostles forth a little space he was like Hey chill out with these guys you know Paul this man Gamaliel he was a great great man of that time he was his his family came from the lineage he was a Pharisee his family came from the lilies of priests I believe it was his dad that was one of the greatest Pharisees in all of Israel and he was in fact the teacher of this young man named Paul named Saul back then until God changed his name and he had the authority and you can see this Authority when when he stands up and he says wait a minute with the Sadducees and everyone listening to them to him and he said unto them ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men for before these days rose up through this boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to not after this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing and Drew away much people after him and he also perished and all even as many obeyed him were dispersed these two men they're they're in history you can you can look up there's other writings besides the Bible about these minutes probably them and they're false leaders they may have been I didn't read it very thorough but they may have been insurrectionists they may have been cult leaders but we see that that they rose up and they they got people to follow them and and to lift them up to a place of leadership and how many times do we see that and they're they're people here right now that have experienced people raise up with a certain Doctrine or a certain vision and this this vision is is maybe some new revelation maybe some some big powerful thing that make maybe comes from it's so common The Book of Daniel or somewhere in in the Book of Revelation and they take these scriptures and they create these doctrines around it and they're so compelling in the way that that they say it brother Rome you remember uh probably 25 years ago remember the the the men that will go around with the message books that were all marked up and remember how they they just pull on us and and then they'd say look at this quote you know and then they give you this and and it was it was always some some big Fandango Revelation and then they try to get you to follow them and to follow their leader and we see that many of these people they ended really badly one of them is in a couple of them in Prescott we all know those other ones were they they went to they went to Colorado they brought this people out they started Living sinful lives following a certain man and then it just many of them fell into sin and in drugs and and all kinds of problems and it all came to not there's two of them that and mentioned their names but there's two of them right there that just that we have all seen most of us that we know about and here is this this Gamaliel and he's saying listen do you remember what happened with this person do you remember what happened was that that person don't worry about it let them go leave them alone if if if it is what you think it is it's gonna come to not it's gonna fail but if it's not listen to this and I say unto you now I say now unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this Council or this work be of men it will come to not but if it be of God you cannot overthrow it lest happily you be found even to fight against God what wisdom you can see while gamalia was raised up to that position that he was and to him they agreed I could I could mention some there's famous cults that have risen up calling themselves Christians over the years and probably the most famous one was Jim Jones and how he he was this charismatic man and and he brought these doctrines that resonated with some of the people but you'll notice that all of these these men these cult leaders they always they always vary from Christ and it becomes more about them or their Revelation rather than about the Lord Jesus it's just a Tell-Tale sign every single time it fails because it's not about Christ but these Brethren here in the book of Acts it was about Christ that's why it didn't fail but here is gamalia he's saying that it's gonna fail if it's false just like all these other ones have failed and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and they let them go again stop doing that stop preaching about this Jesus it's costing us all kinds of trouble it's getting everybody stirred up so so far that did you see our priests were there and they picked up stones and we're going to throw rocks at them and these are the same priests that would would Stone someone for committing a crime and these Brethren I love it that they stuck up for the disciples these Brethren picked up Stones like don't mess with them and then we see how much hatred in these Pharisees and Sadducees for these new Christians and we see it so much today we see that you can be anything that you want in life as long as you're not a Christian if you are a Christian in in this country now you're automatically labeled a racist or you automatically labeled a homophobe or you're automatically labeled a discriminator or or you all you're automatically labeled and they're the the Christians are the the one true people that actually love people they actually want to see people come to Christ they want to see people rehabilitated but the world just hates them and you see right here in this book of Acts here is this Spirit right then they were only doing good show me where anywhere here that any of these brothers or sisters persecuted anyone you can't the book of Acts these new Christians this new church show me where that they came against anyone you see with Stephen I mean he let them have it which we're gonna we're gonna see a little bit later but they were about to Stone him Peter let him have it but they were going to kill him these Christians were good sweet loving people that wanted to see their sick healed they wanted to see the Lost saved and just because it didn't line up with these Pharisees and Sadducees they took them as their enemy and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name that's the same today I'll suffer shame for the name of Jesus Christ anytime I love him and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus Christ his gospel was always in their conversation they were always talking about the Lord they were always talking about the word they were they were always witnessing they were always about the father's business remember I said at the beginning and you can see it it really the musicians can come we'll close here in a few minutes um it really meant something to me brother Lyle when I read that that they were willing to give everything it struck me and I read it over and I was I was thinking Lord that they were born again Christians they were willing to do whatever it took and I was thinking it my mind kept going to Jesus carrying that cross and him giving his life and him saying take it now you take up your cross and follow me now you do the same and they did it they accomplished it and we see Miracles just going out from among them we see that they were persecuted and they rejoiced over their persecution Peter and the the apostles they prayed Lord let us be bold let us be bold Christians and that's what got them beaten their boldness that's what got them persecuted their boldness that's what got them thrown in prison was their beholdeness and then they come back and they said Lord let us be bold let us be even more bold it's because they had it right they had something that this world had never seen before they had the same Spirit of this man that died on the cross within them and they went out preaching the gospel talking about the word all the time and let me close with two scriptures here Proverbs chapter 20. verse 20 . Solomon speaking he said my son attend to my words incline nine a year unto my sayings let them not depart from Thine Eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart for their life under the those that find them and health to all their flesh keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of Life he's talking about the word let this always let it not depart from your eyes keep it in the midst of your heart then Deuteronomy chapter 6. I love this one sister if you could start this is this is just a beautiful scripture Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 5. and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sittest in thy house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou lie us down and when thou arises up talking I was talking this morning about our children talk to them about this word let it always be a point of conversation in our homes and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be as frontless between thine eyes let this always this word always be in me and thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house upon the ports of thy house and on thy Gates how beautiful friends is the word how important is the word that we can read this book of Acts and and go every verse I was kind of rejoicing the other day thinking when we finished this book of Acts we're going to have read every single verse so let's not skip any we will have read every verse in front of the congregation and to think that that scripture I just read in Deuteronomy how we are able we're able to teach this word we're able to listen to it we're able to talk with our families with our wives and with our husbands about it and just rejoice in it Rejoice sometimes we we look at the book of Acts and and we look at ananias and the fire are coming and and and dying there and we think we think wow you know this really happened what if it happened in my church and and the thought came and I thought it was it was kind of funny like I'm gonna witness to people and tell them this is what's going on in our church but I'll tell you what if the power of God was with us people would want to be here and another thing they would want to be more honest they would want to be more Christian they would want to just live this life this book of Acts how beautiful is it I just sometimes I'll read it I just say yeah you know I love it and then other times I look at the Sadducees I'm like oh you guys are creeps why did you do that why did you act that way and then I see that same spirit in in today and how people treat each other and and I just think Lord let this book be written on my heart the Bible says with an iron pen let this these scriptures always be on my mind I want to talk with my wife about it all the time I want to talk with my son about all the time let this book this book of Acts let it be my ax how I act in this these coming days until Wednesday Lord let it be let it go before me as the ark went before and let me be part of this word amen do you love the book of Acts I love it so much that acts chapter 5 is just it's tremendous I was thinking I got done in 40 minutes I was thinking there's no way it's gonna take me two hours to get through this but sometimes you can just read
