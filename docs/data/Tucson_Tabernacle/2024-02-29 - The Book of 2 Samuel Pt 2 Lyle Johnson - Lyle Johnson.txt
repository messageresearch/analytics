Heaven and Earth adore him what a mighty God we serve and Jesus is a God we serve Jesus is a God we serve Angels bow before him Heaven and Earth the amen God bless you all it's a good day to be a Christian every day is a good day good day to be a Christian um before we get started there's a couple announcements I want to make uh first we have uh our brother Eli Castillo is going to be preaching for us on this uh this coming Sunday morning and then on Sunday night I've been praying about what to do and I had in my mind I was listening to um to a service and uh I've been going over and over and over in the past past week or so past couple weeks and it just brother brandom lays out such a beautiful doctrines he talks about serpent seed and he talks about marriage and divorce and he talks about the godhead and he talks about baptism and he he he talks about just so many wonderful things and I thought this would be really really good for the church to hear and I was praying about it and uh I felt like the Lord said no that's that's not what I want for this Sunday and I said okay and then I started praying about maybe he wanted me to minister on Sunday night and um I felt like no he didn't want that either um so and uh then a couple of the brothers brother Marlon there's one of them and and another brother um gave me a couple testimonies and and I said well maybe maybe that's what the Lord wants for this Sunday evening so I I prayed about that and I felt like the Lord said yes that's that's where the direction we should go on Sunday night now I could be mistaken about that um as I always say the Lord willing so we're going to continue to put that before him but the Lord willing Sunday morning brother eleazer Castillo will be ministering and then Sunday night we will have testimony and praise service brother Marlon are you good for Sunday night good good well it's I think it's going to be a blessing to all of us um and uh the prayer requests prayer requests that our Brother Marlin mentioned he's coming from the Amish community and there's when people believe that they have the message of the hour when people believe that this is the only right way then when you start to see Lord might have a a higher Revelation for me or or maybe that no you're not quite right in the way that you think there's something that always comes in and that is fear and that fear will it'll start to consume your thoughts and and the people that love you the most they are fearing that you're sinning or that you're straying from the Lord and it's it's something that Satan uses that we should never ever we shouldn't have any part of it in our own lives how many times did Jesus say and did the angel say when they come from the Lord fear not we should not have any fear if we believe that we are moving right in the Lord then we have nothing to fear because God is with us and when God is with us yes we will make mistakes because we're carnal but if God is with us he's going to take these mistakes and he's going to work them out for the best so brother Marlon I know my brother I think I I can I know how you feel and don't fear don't fear don't you feel for your family either because God knows who they are God God loves them you just pray for them put them in the hands of the Lord and let me tell you something if you've ever heard anything that I say listen to this God's hands are better than your hands they're better than my hands so put them into his hands and all will be well we have a special couple of special visitors tonight neither one of them told me they were coming um brother Craig Brewer I've never met you but I know your name well and God bless you welcome uh your wife's name is sister Anna am I right God bless you brother it's good to have you maybe um we will have our service maybe you could say a few words at the end of service would you be willing you have to if the pastor calls you up you got to do it you know how it is God bless you my brother minister of the gospel and um true servant of the Lord Brother welcome it's an honor to have you here and and uh special another special guest and somebody that's very special to me and that's our brother meno freen here um people know brother meno from around the world he is a true pillar when we talk about brother brandom's message and we talk about what has happened over the years and it's gone around the world brother meno has been a man that so many of us can look towards and say that man is the man that brother brandom described as a true Christian um brother menow do you have a few minutes that you could come and greet the congregation and sing or take the service whatever would be on your heart my brother please please come up thank you number one brother God bless you all tonight it's uh good to be here it's a familiar place I kind of missed it this year no Harmony in the desert uh one of the brothers called me and I said find out if there's Harmony in the desert he called me said no no Harmony in the desert no pun intended but uh I know there's Harmony in the desert there's Harmony in Christ Jesus amen I I appreciate that brother Dan uh one of the good reasons why we know this message is right because the pillar of fire is going before us remember the pillar of fire returned in this day to pick up a bride this is the message itself it's a Vindicated message not just enthused or excited about something but it's the Vindicated word promised Living Word in this day and brother Craig good to see you I don't know where you've land Ed up is this year just visiting right oh yeah kind of thought and um uh Ohio just got the best of you and it took off out of there I understand and I don't think I've seen you since you left Ohio I'm not so sure well we both come from there Ohio is a good place to come from but also go some precious Saints around the world and I'm not sure are you sister schs daughter right right I I you know what at my age you're kind of uh there's a lot of things get gray but your mama fed us real good last February when we were at her house house it was a great great reunion in that area and U I'm uh I'm I hate to think of how long I go back but it's been a long long time I've been on this road and it's been a good road um I wouldn't trade it for anything because I know I started when I was young and um um the Lord started it rather but I believe he started it before the foundation of the world and uh it's so nice to know that you've always been and that you're not that you're just dropping into a a sphere here to uh uh fulfill what God already foresaw but we didn't know it we didn't know we were we didn't know we were predestinated we didn't know if we were coming or going but one day that still Small Voice that inner man begin to be quickened and U I'm so grateful that this match is you know I feel like brother Bram said that time about his own uh uh struggles and trials that he had and uh you know when that doctor said uh uh did you keep your religion through all this trial when his wife died and baby died and said did you keep your religion he said no sir he said My Religion kept me and I get I just guess I've been a Christian since about 19 oh 60 and all these years I can only say one thing I didn't keep myself he kept me with all the confusions around reality there's only one can keep you one of the greatest things that we can do in the middle of this age is to keep our heads spiritually speaking about all the fanaticism that follows the true word but that's where Satan zeroed in he's got the rest and uh I'm just so glad tonight to say this uh this world is not our home I was going along a while and just uh since he take take a little liberty so I just say this I want to do you know Palms of Victory you know that song now you we'll do the we'll try the best we can can D you learned it oh did you I was driving along one day you like we all do and we get to get alone talk to the Lord and and uh uh something we talk you know how we think about our conditions you know our wife our family our children and and always praying Lord um I like those promises that say and thou and thy house shalt be saved and thou and thy Offspring with thee we like to use those quotes because that's God's promise and the one thing we do confession is to say the same thing that he said and I say oh I confess this I confess just confess what he said if he said you had eternal life before the foundation of the world and predestined on the adoption of sons say amen that's confession but I was driving along and something said you know you don't own a single thing on this Earth you don't take there's not one thing you own on this Earth if you're a millionaire today you don't own it the time you pass by the grave you take nothing with you but there's one thing we take with us the supernatural character of the Soul I'm so glad that's the part that makes me happy you know and this little song says it pretty good doesn't always say the words like we heard him in this age but but we're pilgrims we're strangers here seeking a city whose building maker is God so that was the character of our great great father Abraham the father of the faith which of course was Christ but he was a pilgrim and stranger on this Earth all my life that I've walked and I think and I keep looking over my shoulder one of these mornings the dead in Christ rise amen I saw Wayward Traveler in garments SED clad he was traveling up the mountain and it seemed that he was sad his back was heavy laden his strength was almost gone but he shouted as he journeyed Deliverance will come then Palms of Victory crowns of Glory p arm of Victory I shall wear I saw in the evening the sun was sitting low he had overcome the mountain and he reached the veil below he saw that Golden City his Everlasting home and he shouted glad hosana for Deliverance with will come then Palms of Victory crowns of Glory Palms of Victory I shall wear and while gazing on that City just or the narrow flood a band of Holy Angels Came From The Throne of God they bore him on their p iions say for The Dashing foam and join him in his Triumph for deliv had come then Palms of Victory crowns of Glory Palms of Victory I shall wear it seems I hear the angels around the throne so Grand they've shouted glad hosana we've reached the promised land when we have reached that City our race on Earth we've run we'll all shout loud hosana Deliverance has come then BS of victory Of Glory Palms of Victory I shall wear amen God bless you all I did see that elect lady walk out sister I saw your mom back there and she's with her mom sorry sister Rachel I didn't see you she just walked out but uh sorry but God bless you it's so good to see you here tonight it's good to be here tonight Shalom thank you so much that song I don't know a few months ago I sent brother Jordan a text of a video of a brother singing that song and I asked him I said can you sing this brother Jordan learned it for me and uh and we sang it in church so it's I love that song it's it's um it's a blessing and I certainly love brother menow God bless you thank you so much sister Rachel I didn't recognize um recognize you back there in Sister Williams God bless bless you it's good to have you I feel like I'm kind of brother L I feel like I'm kind of sandwiched in between royalty here you know we got brother Craig over on this side and brother minnow over on this side and me and brother Lyall are we're stuck here in the middle but I tell you what that's two good good book ends to be between so for tonight um let's let's all stand for tonight uh we will continue on for our visitors what we're doing is we've devoted our Wednesday night service to a Bible study and the the first time we did this we went through the book of Acts and we went chapter by chapter word by word all the way through the book of Acts it took us uh I don't know the better part of a year to do it and uh the people enjoyed it and I believe that it was edifying to the body so I I was praying and I thought Lord what would you want to do this was a real blessing how do you want us to handle Wednesday nights do you want us to continue on with this Bible study the thought came to my mind let's start in Genesis and let's just go through the whole Bible book by book service by service so we started in Genesis now we're in the book of second Samuel we're on the second half of 2 Samuel we know that the book of 1 Samuel we had an introduction to what some people call the last judge this great one of the greatest prophets has ever walked the Earth his name was Samuel and we know that Samuel anointed this King Saul and Saul served the Lord a little while and then he um he failed got himself in the way and um it wasn't just a couple years into his ministry into his kingdom that he failed and the Lord turned his eyes to David Saul continued on he ended up being the king for 40 years and now the um the blessing has passed to this man David I went through the first brother Lyall last week went through the first part of the book we saw how David was truly as a man after God's Own Heart but even that he was still a man he was still a human being and he still failed and it was we ended the service last week and it it seemed like a sad note but then brother Joe gave a testimony about how he made a mistake and he called the wrong person and God took that mistake and he turned it into a blessing and that person gave his heart to the Lord and now he's serving the lord in the church that you go to right up uh up in the Frozen country so is the same with David God can take a mistake no matter how bad our mistakes are and he can turn it around and give one of the greatest Kings really that Israel has ever seen the one of the most successful Kings and that is Solomon from David's mistake with basba the the the child died but then later on the lord gave them that blessing so brother ly if you would come brother Aaron if you would sing a song as brother L's coming hey he is my everything he is my all he is my everything both great and small he gave his life for me made everything new he is my everything now how about you folks may ask me some folks may say who is this Jesus you talk about every day he is my savior he said me free now listen while I tell you what he means to me he is my everything he is my all he is my everything both great and small he gave his Life For Me made everything new he is my everything now how about you God bless you all good evening green lights on the green lights on there we go we have a green light we can go once again we have the privilege of opening our Bibles and seeing what the Lord has for us from its Pages this evening will conclude the book of 2 Samuel when I was a kid in the 1950s there were three te TV networks in major cities 24-hour television didn't exist we live not far from San Francisco so we had all three channels cable didn't exist no cell phones no streaming no internet no email we had an antenna on the roof of the house pointed toward San Francisco as did every other house in our area for a while boxing was the favorite sport carried by all three Networks I remember hearing the sports announcer exclaim thee Wednesday night fights are on the air we never watched the boxing matches but I could hear that announce in my mind as I read this portion of 2 Samuel because this is Wednesday night and the next several chapters are about a big fight a fight over the Throne of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah and about a nation deeply divided as a result of Sin Sin at the top S at the bottom thank you and just like on those Wednesday nights sometimes we have technical difficulties but but we overcome them and is this is this problem this nation divided as a result of sin is this ancient history or is it today's United States of America before we read our opening scriptures this evening let's approach the Lord one more time and seek his guidance Lord Jesus we're in awe of your word that you inspired men over many years many generations in many places Lord to bring us a love letter it's it's Valentine's Day and you've given us a love love letter as we open its Pages Lord Make It live for us make it live in our hearts Lord bring forth in us what you desire from your word this evening Lord and help us to please you and to serve you and to pursue you we thank you forgive us where we fall short in Jesus name amen while we're still standing we'll read from second s Psalm 32 it's a Psalm that's attributed to David and likely composed during this period that we'll be reading about in 2 Samuel it says blessed is he whose transgression is Forgiven not he who never transgresses whose sin is covered blessed is the man un whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose Spirit there is no gu David says when I kept silence when I didn't confess or confront my sin my bones wax old through my roaring all the day long for day and night thy hand was Heavy upon me my moisture has turned into the drought of Summer sa SAA means stop think about this I acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgest the iniquity of my sin say la for this shall everyone that is Godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto him Thou Art my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from TRU trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with songs of Deliverance Palms of Victory say la I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine eye be not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bid and Bridal lest they come near unto me seek work make effort to understand did I hit the wrong one no there we go many Sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the Lord Mercy shall Compass him about and for this reason if no other be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye righteous shout for Joy all ye that are upright in heart please be seated last Wednesday evening we explored the first half of the book of 2 Samuel it it began with the death of Saul we followed the life and exploits of David and some of his officials from the beginning of his reign in heon to his conquest of Jerusalem the construction of his Palace and his desire to build a temple for the Lord we also caught glimpses of his dark side saw him destroy one of his Valiant defenders in a vain attempt to cover up his sin a a premeditated transgression followed by premeditated murder which resulted in this prophecy which dominates the second half of the book The Prophet Nathan speaking to David now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house thy Dynasty thy descendants because thou Hast despised me the Lord you you ignored my commands to a King and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thy wives from before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son for thou did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel before the sun in plain sight openly and and David in sorrowful repentance said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also put away thy sin Thou shalt not die David your sins forgiven but your Deeds won't go unpunished oh wait it it looks like another edition of The Daily parchment has arrived let's look at the headlines for the remainder of 2 Samuel we see many of them related to Absalom one of David's Sons as we expect David is in most of them this is a difficult section of scripture yet in the midst of the turmoil and pain human tragedy and anguish we see glimpses of the Messiah who will come some 10 centuries later a little background when David became king of Judah after Saul's death he lived in Hebron for seven years and we read in 2 Samuel should say chapter three up there and unto David were Sons born in Hein his first born was amnon and thus the Crown Prince of aoem the jezel and the second kab of Abigail the wife of nabal the carlite and the third Absalon the son of Maka the daughter of talai king of Gasher so that third son was from the result of a political marriage absolum Ammon and absolon pay an important role now as well as David's daughter named Tamara a sister of absum and note that absum is a nephew to talmi the king of Gasher a district then of Syria David's eldest son amnon thinks that he's in love with his half sister Tomar amnon pretends to be sick asks for Tomar to come to his bedside prepare some food he then forces himself on her compounds his sin and her humiliation by sending her away afterward she lives in her brother absalom's house absum plots Revenge two years later at sheep sharing time you might remember sheep sharing time when we studied Genesis and we had the uh incident between Judah and another person named tomor absum convinces David to have all of his sons come this is going to be a big party at the height of it when amnon is drunk absum has him killed the rest of David's Sons Flee for home absolum takes flight to gisher a region not not a town some 8200 miles away recall his mother was the daughter of the king of Gasher so he's going to his uncle for Refuge some three years later having gotten over the death of amnon David Longs to see absolum once more joab the commander of David's Army and a longtime companion seeing the longing in David arranges for a woman to pretend to seek judgment from David she tells a tale that David sees through but by it convinces David to allow absolum to return to Jerusalem David summons joab and asks him to bring absolum back from Exile so joab arose and went to gisher brought absum to Jerusalem and the King said let him return to his own house let him not see my face so absum returned to his own house and saw not the king's face but in all Israel there was none so much praised as absolent for his character oh didn't say that his Integrity uh his wisdom no for the vanity of his Beauty from the soulle of his foot to the C crown of his head there was no blemish in him absum is the definition of a self-absorbed narcissist when he pulled his head that means when he cut his hair I guess that just happened for it was at every Year's End that he cut it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he cut it he weighed the hair of his head I never thought about weighing the hair when I had a haircut but it weighed 200 shekels after the the king's weight this is weight not money it's about 5 lbs I'd be luy to get a half an ounce over a period of a year but then I'm not unblemished from the soulle of my foot to the crown of my head either unto absum we read There were born three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar the same name as his sister she was a woman of fair countenance so absum dwelt two full years in Jerusalem and son the king's face David still wouldn't see him he had after all murdered the Crown Prince In Cold Blood absum twice asked joab to come to him so he can ask joab to intervene with David and joab doesn't come he refuses to come to absum so absum says I how to get his attention and he has his servants set joab's barleyfields on fire not your favorite neighbor then joab arose and came to abson to his house and said unto him why have thy servants set my field on fire absum answered joab behold I said unto thee saying come hither that I may send thee to the king to say wherefore am I come from gisher it had been good for me to have been there still now therefore let me see the king's face and if there be any iniquity in me let him kill me so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called for Absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the King kissed Absalon notice something strange about that verse it never says David it says the king he's not approaching him as a Father's son David kissing him in this way is emphasizing this is a royal Act of Pardon to absum uhoh next headline absalom's conspiracy the stage is now set absum has been pardoned by David which then allows absum to sit in the gate of Jerusalem an ancient times this was a place where judges and important officials sat and conducted business we saw that in the Book of Ruth with Boaz he uses this position to build favor with all who come through over a period of years telling everyone he ought to be the judge and he would give them Justice he takes their hand kisses them the consumate politician but there's a difficult passage in here let let's read this 2 Samuel 15:6 on this manner greeting and kissing did absam to all Israel that came to the king for judgment so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel and it came to pass after 40 years that Absalom said unto the king I pray thee let me go and pay my vow which I have vowed unto the Lord in heon well it's impossible for him to have sat in the gate for 40 years and then go to David we 25 to 30 years into David's 40y year reign now 40 years from when absum was pardoned David would have been dead for 20 maybe 30 years so we have to ask what's going on what is that 40 years refer to well let's take a closer look some translations attempt to get around this by stating that well the text must have been corrupted in ancient times it should read four years not 40 and so you'll see in some translations of the Bible they say four years rather than 40 some commentators claim that well 40 is a symbolic number it represents testing it doesn't really mean 40 years it means there's a test that's coming brother brandom never spoke on this particular verse that I could find our guidance from him is God watches over his word well I I checked the Dead Sea Scrolls of the most ancient Hebrew text that I could find to see if it would shed a little bit of light on this what what's going on among all those Scrolls there are two copies they came from cave 4 scroll 51 and 53 for those of you who are Scholars of the Dead Sea Scrolls they're both fragmentary as are many of the Scrolls one of the copies completely lacks verse S the other one lacks the part of verse S that includes the number well however others point out that this narrative is detailing a conspiracy regarding kingship and suggests that the 40 years begins when Samuel anointed David to become king in 1st Samuel 16:13 we it it says that Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed David in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward David took the throne some 10 between 10 and 20 years after that this understanding fits well with the timeline of David's Reign the probable ages of his children and the rest of the events of his life so personally I'm going to say that the text isn't corrupted and that the 40 years refers to the anointing of David to be king by Samuel you don't have to accept that that's that's how I see it based on this evidence getting back to 2 Samuel and absol's request of David to allow him to go to Hein absil goes on to say for thy servant vow to vow while I abod at Gasher in Syria saying if the Lord shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem then I will serve serve the Lord absum is manipulating David how do you know when absum is lying when his lips are moving the king said unto him go In Peace So absum arose and went to Hein but absum sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel saying to these coconspirators as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say absolum reign and heon and with absolum went 200 men out of Jerusalem that were called they they went in their Simplicity they didn't know anything about this they were unwitting accomplices and absolum sent for aiel the gilonite David's counselor from his City even from gilo while he absum offered sacrifices in Hebron and the conspiracy was strong the people people increase continually with absolum Not only was David blinded regarding this yearslong conspiracy and undermining of his authority but David's advisors counselors even the the spies the people that he had that heard rumors and investigated things they were all either blind to it or part of it in verse 12 here we see that even one from David's Inner Circle of his most trusted advisers a hopel abandoned him for absolum not everyone cast their lot with Abraham with Absalom sorry there came a messenger to David saying the hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem arise let us flee we shall not escape from absolum make speed to depart lest you overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword that prophecy the sword will not depart David still with the heart of his Shepherd if I stick around not only will he kill me but these innocent people in Jerusalem are going to suffer as well we've got to draw these forces away the king's servants said unto the king Behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my Lord the king shall appoint many come with David I'd read this entire chapter with you but for time but I encourage you to read it maybe you already have as you read your Bibles at home in conjunction with a series of Wednesday night studies David leaves 10 of his concubines kind of second rank wives in Jerusalem to take care of the palace the king said also to zadok the priest art thou not a Seer return into the city of peace and your two sons with you ahas thy son and and Jonathan the son of abiatar see I I'll carry in the plain of the Wilderness and until to come word from you to certify me he's setting up a counter Espionage operation he wants to find out what's going on zadok therefore and abathur carried the Ark of God again to Jerusalem and They Carried there now this next verse is one that brother brandham used as a text or referred to in at least 30 sermons a foreshadow of Jesus Jesus in his final days as David went up the ascent David went up the ascent of Mount olives the future Gethsemane and wept as he went up had his head covered and he went Barefoot and all the people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went and one told David saying hipel is among the conspirators with absolum and David said oh Lord I pray thee turn the counsel of a hopel into foolishness sometimes the Lord takes a while to answer our prayers and sometimes they're answered before we finish asking it came to pass that when David was come to the top of the mount where he lamented his Misfortune and asked God why me no no he knew why Nathan had told him the sword would not depart from his house instead showing his character his heart that God loved he gets to the top of the hill and David worshiped God and behold in worship after that request hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent and Earth upon his head unto whom David said recognizing God had just answered him if thou passest on with me then Thou shalt be a burden unto me I'll be responsible for you but if you return to the city and say unto Absalom I will be thy servant O King as I have been thy father's servant hitherto so will I now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me defeat the councel of a hopel and Hast not there with thee zadok and abiatar the priests therefore it shall be that what thing whatsoever Thou shalt hear out of the King's house Thou shalt tell it to zadak and to abather the priests behold they have there with them their two sons ah Zak's son and Jonathan abiatar son and by them you shall s unto me everything that she can hear so hushai David's friend came into the City and absolum came into Jerusalem now hopel hushai these are people we've not read about earlier in the scripture and won't read about again in the scripture they're just very relevant to this particular story so as David is cresting the hill of the mount a fellow named Zeba meets him Zeba was the chief of the Servants of mephibosheth Jonathan's son whom David had seated at the king's table treating him as a son because of his friendship with Jonathan Zeba has with him a couple of Saddle donkeys and various foods and for David and the people there and they're talking a little bit David's asking what's this all about and zeas says by the way mobos remains in Jerusalem expecting God to restore the kingship of Saul to him then said the king to Zeba behold thine are all that pertained under mobosi in other words David gives all of sa's apprpriate inheritance to Zeba taking it from MTH based on zeba's statements and Zeba said I humbly beseech thee that I may find Grace in thy sight oh Lord King well not all is well here chapter 16 verse5 when King David came to bahim that's about two miles Northeast of Jerusalem on the road to gilgal in Jericho is within the modern city borders behold there came then out of a man of the family of the House of Saul thus a benjaminite whose name was shami the son of Gara he came forth and cursed still as he came he cast stones at David and at all the Servants of King David all the people the mighty man that on his right hand and on his left he's throwing rocks at these guys thus said shimi when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man thou man of bile the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the House of Saul in whose stead thou Hast reigned and the Lord ha delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalon thy son behold Thou Art taken in thy Mischief because thou art a bloody man David's men want to kill Shen yeah but David said to let them be he said my own son wants to kill me how much danger can this guy do God told him to curse me perhaps the Lord will see my suffering today and reward me good for this cursing so they passed by Shi cursing and throwing stones and dust at them the whole time absum enters Jerusalem and the counselor hit theel accompanies him hushai comes to absum and convinces absum that he wants to serve him just as he served David accepting this absum asks counsel of ayapel who tells him to have relations with Dave's concubines to show that he abor his father David and that doing this will strengthen his hand among his followers Absalom SS up a tent on the top of the palace and does just that in the sight of all Israel more of Nathan's prophecy fulfilled and we read that the councel of ayapel which he counseled in those days was as if a man had inquired at the Oracle of God as if they'd gone to the Tabernacle before the um and Thum and so was all the Council of a hopel both with David and with absum this guy had influence he was trusted he had a track record ayapel advised absum to immediately dispatched 12,000 troops to catch David while he's on the run and kill him absum turns to hushi and asked is this a good idea is that we should do hisai says not so fast not so fast gather from all the people from Dan to Bersa then go after David with a huge army with absolum personally leading them David won't stand a chance against such an attack absolum agrees with hushi hushi then gets word to zadex and abith our sons who go and tell David David and his followers leave that night and cross the Jordan a hopel sees his counsel is not followed he goes home and he hangs himself here I think we see another somewhat strange foreshadow of the Messiah how in a parallel of Judas Judas was a disciple he was a trusted confident of Jesus he was the treasurer and it has David ascends them out of all as he receives word of ael's treachery just as Jesus was confronted in Gethsemane by the Enemy by Judas Treasury and like Judas when his plot doesn't go the way he thought it wood he hangs himself cursed be he that hangs from a tree as absolum gathers his army David comes to mahaim that's the same place you read about last week where ishbosheth ruled for two years over Israel in the throws of the Civil War for power after Saul's death absum places amasa as fellow named amasa is the commander of the army joab had remained with David he crosses Jordan and so Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead and it came to pass when David was come to mahanaim that shi the son of nahash of rabba of the children of Aman remember about the children of Aman God's anger at Aman and Moab for not providing food and water to Moses and the Israelites on their way to Canaan we talked about that when we studied the Book of Ruth did anyone from Ammon learn from that well let's see and maker the son of emel of Lo the bell and Bartel the gileadite of ralim they brought beds that's sleeping mats and basins Earth and vessels clay pots wheat barley flour parched corn that means roasted grain beans lentils and parched pulse pulses seeds of peas and beans so these are roasted seeds of peas and beans and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of cow's milk for David and for the people that were with him to eat for they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness they did exactly what their forefathers should have done David organizes his army he divides it into three brigades he wants to lead them but the people say David no you stay here you're the reason we're doing this if something happens to you we lose everything you stay here okay David bows to their wishes but the King David commanded joab and abashi and IAI the three Brigade commanders saying deal gently for for my sake with the young man even with Absalom this is David the father's feeling for his son and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absum the people were looking to David as the king whereas he was looking at absum as his son the son of his father well the battle takes place in a forest absum is riding on a mule and apparently it was not just after a haircut because as it passes under an oak tree his hair gets Tangled in the bow and he comes off the mule dangling from his hair joab hears of this finds absum and he that's joab took three darts in his hand and thrust him through the heart of absolum while he was yet alive in the midst of the Oak and 10 young men that be joab's armor compassed about circled him and smote absum and killed him and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing after Israel for joab held back the people he stopped the pursuit and further Carnage turns out that there were 20,000 people of Israel that were killed in that battle and they took absum and cast him into a great pit in the wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all Israel fled everyone to his tent now absam in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself his Facebook page a pillar which is in the king's Dale the pin valley in Jerusalem for he said I have no Sons to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called unto this day absalom's place this this photo is of an ancient tomb traditionally assigned as absalom's Monument brother Daniel spoke about this a few weeks ago so ABS must have done this when he was young because he read earlier this evening that he had three sons as well as a daughter named Tamar well a runner arrives and tells David absum has been killed and the King was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said oh my son absolum my son my son absolum would God I had died for the absum my son my son sometimes it takes a friend willing to risk that friendship to help us see how our self- Focus can have unintended consequences on others in this case joab is that friend joab is a complex and somewhat mysterious person he's with David from the beginning back when he was hiding in a cave from Saul I think he was the second name listed of the people that were hiding with David he arranged a way to get David's attention to bring absolum back to Jerusalem when he you saw that David wanted him back but he's also the one who assured absum was killed when David had specifically asked that he be spared he did this ending the contest for the throne to which Samuel had anointed David and it was told joab behold the king weeps and Mourns for Absalom and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day how the King was grieved for his son and the people get them by stealth they tiptoed quietly that day into the city as as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle but the king covered his face and the King cried with a loud voice oh my son absolum absolum my son my son and joab boldly came into the house to the king and said thou Hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines and that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends David wake up for by your behavior thou Hast declared this day that thou regardest neither princes your family nor servants for this day I perceive that if abselet lived and we all had died this day then it had pleased thee well now therefore arise get up David go forth and speak comfortably un thy servants reassure your people for I swear by the Lord if thou go not forth there will not t one with thee this night and it will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now David get a grip so David heads South he comes to the Jordan River the the men of Judah meet him near gilgal and shm the man who cursed David comes with a thousand benjaminites and begs forgiveness and shimi said to the king let not my Lord impute iniquity un to me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my Lord the king went out of Jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart for thy servant does know that I I have sinned therefore behold I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my Lord the King David's men want to kill shimi David spares him perhaps thinking back on his sin with ba Sheba that the Lord forgave him when he repented and in this whole context he wrote in Psalm 32 which we read in our opening blessed is he whose transgression is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and whose Spirit there is no guile let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me said ji I acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgest the iniquity of my sin we're told if we want forgiveness we must forgive you recall as David was fleeing from Jerusalem Zeba came and told him that mbth was happy absum toose David and MTH expected to become king mbth now meets David as he enters Jerusalem and mbth the son of Saul came down to meet the king and had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day that the king departed until the day that he came again in peace it's not the actions of a man who's expected to be crowned King it came to pass when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king that the king said to him why didn't you come with me mbth and he answered my Lord oh King my servant Zeba deceive me for I said I will saddle me and ass that I may ride thereon and go to the king because I'm lame and Zeba hath slandered me unto my Lord the king but my Lord the king is an angel from God therefore do what is good in thine eyes David continues to show kindness and victory but the grumblings of future problems are present and the men of Israel and Judah exchange barbs chapter 20 tells of another immediately following Rebellion by Israel led by a man named Sheba also the son of Benjamin remember Benjamin was Saul's tribe and they are all smarting over losing the kingship under Saul Saul but this Rebellion is also suppressed we find that when Saul was King he sought to kill the giban ites the Lord sends a famine on Israel and after three years the Lord tells David that it's because of Saul's actions to the gibit David asked the gibeonites what he can do to make them happy and stop the famine and I'll let you read what happened and your devotions and Bible reading at home I'm not going to SPO it for you sometime later David and his army go to war David is exhausted and nearly killed after this he is persuaded to not go to war it's too personally risky for him David's getting old chapter 22 is a song it's very like Psalm 18 Again you should read that and rejoice in it it's it's beautiful chapter 23 records David's life last words that's followed by a list of David's Warriors some 37 names including Uriah the hittite beba's husband included in this is a flashback to an incident in the time David was hiding in a cave Saul was King the Philistines Garrison had control of Bethlehem and David's no I'm not going to spoil that for you you need to read that too understand that things that are written in the Bible are not necessarily chronological they're written to make a point they can Flash Forward flash back so we just had David's final words but now we're flashing back we're going to an earlier time we don't know when in David's Reign that this event happened I I think it's likely to have occurred shortly after David became king over all Israel in Jerusalem and wanted to know the extent of his kingdom what what am I really controlling here 2 Samuel chapter 24 the Final Chapter again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and he who the Lord moved David against them to say go number Israel in Judah for the king said to joab the captain of the host which was with him go now through all the tribes of Israel from Dan even to Bersa and number ye the people that I may know that I may know the number of the people joab said unto the king now the Lord thy God add unto the people ever how many they may be a h hundredfold that the Eyes of My Lord the king may see it but why does my Lord the king Delight in this thing notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against joab against the captains of the host and joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel but there's a parallel account of this found in 1 Chronicles chapter 21 it says and Satan stood up against Israel and provoked David to number Israel like the Book of Job the Lord allows Satan to do something and David said to joab and to the rulers of the people go number Israel from Beva even to Dan and bring the number of them to me that I may know it as in 2 Samuel joab resists but complies but we get another detail here Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them for the king's word was abominable to joab and God was displeased with this thing therefore he smote Israel why we'll see why in a moment back to 2 Samuel verse 10 David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people David said unto the Lord I have sinned greatly and that I have done and now I beseech thee Oh Lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for I have done very foolishly again we see David's heart he's saying Lord this is on me I have sinned forgive me for when David was up earlier in the morning the word of the Lord came unto the prophet G David's Seer saying go and say unto David thus sayeth the Lord I offer thee three things choose thee one of them that I may do it unto thee so Gad came to David and told him and said shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wil thou flee three months from before thine enemies while they pursue thee or that there be three days pestilence in thy land advise see what answer I shall return to him that sent me and David said unto God I am in a great Strait let us fall now into the hand of the Lord for his mercies are great let me not fall into the hand of man so the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from Dan even to Beva 70 thousand men why a pestilence why a plague on the people the short answer is that's what the law required what remember Deuteronomy the commands to the king to write that book and read in that book every day understand it David says in the Psalms Thy word have I placed in my heart that I might not sin against against thee well there's a law regarding taking a census Exodus 30 we read the Lord spake unto Moses saying when thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number then shall they give Every Man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord when thou nbest them but what if they don't that there be no plague among them when thouest them so the Lord then gives directions as to the amount to be collected it to be used to support the Tabernacle not Tucson Tabernacle but that Tabernacle David didn't perform a census to support the Tabernacle he took it for his personal gratification that I may know there's no indication in second Samuel or first Chronicles that a census tax was collected and provided for the Tabernacle thus a plague occurred back to 2 Samuel in 1 Chronicles and when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem it's the end of this plague he's come to Jerusalem stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it the Lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the Lord was by the threshing place of Arona is also called Oran the jebusite in Chronicles it says David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord hovering standing between the Earth and Heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem then David and the Elders of Israel who were clothed in sacko not kingly Priestly robes fell on their faces back to Samuel David spake unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smokee the people people and said whoo I have sinned I have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thine hand I pray the be against me and against my father's house remember David was a shepherd He has the heart of a shepherd and God came that day to David and said unto him go up rear an altar unto the the Lord in the threshing floor of AR the jebusite meanwhile in Chronicles and Oran that's ARA turned back and saw the angel and His Four Sons with him hid themselves I imagine pretty quickly now ornin was threshing wheat and as David came to ornin ornin looked and saw David and went out of the threshing floor where he was hiding and bowed himself to to David with his face to the ground then David said to ornin grant me the place of this threshing floor that I may build an alter therein unto the Lord Thou shalt Grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from all the people and ornin said to David take it to the and let my Lord the king do that which is good in his eyes I I I give the the oxin also for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and wheat for the meat offering I give it all the king said to AR nay but I will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth cost me nothing so David bought the threshing for and The Oxen for 50 shekels of silver the final verse of second Samuel David built there altar unto the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so the Lord was intreated for the land and the plague was stayed from Israel but between those two sentences there are things going on which are recorded in first Chronicles we read David built an altar unto the Lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the Lord and the Lord answered from Heaven by fire upon the altar of the burnt offering and the Lord commanded the still plainly visible angel with his sword drawn that he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof at that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing floor of orn the jebusite when he saw the angel sheath his sword then he sacrificed there this latter portion of 2 Samuel details the problems that befell the nation through failed leadership not simply of David but a continuation from the days of the judges through Saul to David we'll see more of this as we progress through the books of kings and Chronicles the Lord wanted Jacob's descendants to follow him to be examples to the rest of the world but instead of being the influencers they became the influenced worship of the Lord became a a religion imperfectly followed rather than a relationship passionately pursued God's correction is often harsh he allows problems and tragedies to come our way these are not for him to discover our weaknesses they are for us to understand them to overcome and to grow David's sins were forgiven but the consequences of those sins were still to be born sadly many times others suffer as a result of our failures we need to be aware that our actions as well as our inactions have consequences in our lives we need to like the kings of old keep the word in our hearts read from the book every day and read with understanding if the musicians would please come the Commandments to Kings we read last week are good rules for us to follow regardless of our position or calling yesterday Heather and I celebrated our 53rd wedding anniversary when we were courting I didn't just sit down and wait for her to drop in my lap I pursued her sadly once we were married I thought I had achieved what I sought not so it's taken me many many years to realize what a gem she is someone not to be taken for granted as a result in recent years our love has grown to new heights and its roots have reached new depths I don't take her presence her love for granted nor she mine we're a team in this together for the Long Haul and neither should we any of us take the Lord's Grace his love his presence for granted we're in this together with him for the long hul as we close this portion of the service let's sing I could never out love the Lord starting with the chorus I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more for I could never ever out love the Lord there been times when giving and and loving brought pain and I promised that I'd never let it happen again but I found out that loveing is well worth the risk and that even in losing you win I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more love for I could never ever I love the Lord he showed us that only through dying we Liv and he gave when it seemed there was nothing to give he loved when loving brought heartache and lost he forgave from the old ruged cross I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to [Music] love love till there's just no more love for I could never ever out love the Lord I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give going to love love till there's just no more love I could never never out love the Lord can imagine those two men very gifted men in husi and hiel men with callings upon their lives both of them gave the right counsel but one chose to follow the wrong person ayapel husi chose to follow and to be loyal to David both of them equally gifted and whoi won because he was able to deceive absum into making the wrong choice and ayapel saw as brother Lyall pointed out he saw that his time was over and he had betrayed the wrong person in the King the same as Judas and I I must admit that I always wondered brother Craig I always wondered about numbering the people and why was that such a sin for David when we see the people numbered many times in the scriptures and it shows how important it is for us that call ourselves ministers or pastors that we have a Ministry that we follow this word to the letter David in in numbering the people maybe he didn't do wrong but he did it in the wrong way and he left out as brother Lyall pointed out he left it out that tax on the people and therefore he got out of God's will shows us how important it is that we don't take this word for granted that we we hold it with as much reverence as we can and we we pray about it before we bring it to the people because if we bring something wrong look at look at the consequences of doing something wrong and we see with with David and how the people suffered because of numbering the people and we see the the advice of ayapel and he made the wrong choice and the man he chose a man that didn't have character and hushi chose the man that was after God's Own Heart even though all the mistakes that he made he was a great king and I love these first and 2 Samuel because it shows the humanity of David shows that he was this great man that we all know he was but he was also a man that had many faults and made many mistakes and I love David for his mistakes because it shows me that that no matter what I do if my heart is right and Lord I'm trying you see that I got out of your will Lord forgive me the grace of God is there to forgive us brother brother Lyall thank you my brother brother Craig if you come up my brother and say a few words to the people brother Aon if we could sing that song [Music] again that's a good one my life Mercy r [Music] I I should have fall my soul cast down God's Mery rro my life it's good to be with you again I think it's been a couple years since we've been

to help with the funeral and I'm kind of dancing I've got a meeting in h Dallas so we're flying to Dallas tomorrow and then we'll be flying back next week for the uh for the funeral but we're happy to be with you appreciate the word of God I too I too love the scriptures showing as brother brandom said the Bible tells the truth amen and it tells both sides and there's a part of the scripture said the Lord said unto my Lord the Holy Spirit came upon David and the Bible said David in the spirit said and uh brother brandham said it was a great difference between David and David in the spirit Spirit there's a great difference between the church and the church in the spirit but when David was in the spirit the Holy Spirit would come upon him and literally act out Jesus Christ 800 years later going up the Mount of Olives David in the spirit manifesting Christ then David typing Christ in the Millennium how many believe we at the coming of the Lord Jesus Israel's like just a boiling cauldron the world is in fragments we've been waiting for a long time but he shall come and there was a bunch of Gentiles that believed him and they just rallied around him and they drew their swords and began driving back the enemy and we realized that that was a spirit speaking of a gentile people that would see the anointed word of this day would draw our swords and while the World Turns it away turns Christ outside the church the word of God the Living Word of God that we would draw our swords and we would come against the enemy pushing back the powers of Darkness declaring Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever just happy to be a part of that too God help us to be a people in the spirit and we just appreciate the word of God we appreciate you standing appreciate brother Daniel uh We've Come Close in crossing paths over the years just missing each other so we just met just here and I'd pastored in Lima for some time and uh brother minow would come in just like
