Um, let's just welcome them. There will be mountains that I will have to climb. And there will be battles that I will have to fight. Victory or defeat. It's up to me [singing] to decide. How can I [music] expect to win? If I never try, I just &gt;&gt; I [singing and music] just can't give up now. &gt;&gt; Oh, I've come too far. &gt;&gt; Too far [singing] from where I started from. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, nobody told me. God told me [singing] the road would be brought [singing and music] me this far to leave me. &gt;&gt; Never said there wouldn't be trials. Never [music] said I wouldn't [singing] fall. Never said that everything would go the way I wanted to go.

[applause] One day we're going to sing that song and the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords is going to lead us through that heavenly city. He's going to say, "You going to live here and you're going to live there and it's just going to be it's going to be the greatest time it's ever been." Let's uh let's be seated. I want to say a few words. First of all, welcome to all of our visitors. God bless you all. It's good to see you. Ellen, it's hadn't seen you. I used to work with that lady down there. God bless you. Welcome. It's It's good to see you and and all the family and my friend Stephen Bryant jumped on a plane and came out. God bless you. It's so good. So good to see you today. Family, friends, welcome. &gt;&gt; Last night we had a great service. &gt;&gt; It was good, man. It was something special. And what it was is we had some people from the church come up and give their personal testimonies about what the Lord has been doing been doing in their lives over the past few years. And we we had a full plate and one of them we had to put off. And I'll tell you what, I just Brother Manny, I couldn't get through this weekend without having you testify, my friend. So, we're going to continue on from last night. We're going to finish up the testimony service. I have one more that I want to share with the group. And this is a dear friend of mine. I've seen the Lord work in his life amazingly. And your testimony is one of the most spiritual and powerful testimonies I really have ever heard. And we're just going to get a little piece of it tonight. And I I got to tell you, this is just like the cherry that's on top. And there's a whole Sunday underneath it that Brother Manny could give. So, brother Manny, come on up. This is Brother Emanuel Cosio. And uh yeah, let's let's go to this one right here. And again, last night we had these testimonies. And I talked to the congregation. Sometimes we can't put our scriptures together just right. If somebody asks you, "Well, what church do you go to?" Or if you ask them if they're a Christian, and you just get maybe to that next sentence, and you think, "Oh, I just don't know what to say. Hey, I I can't I can't put the scriptures together and I can't quote the right ones. Listen, don't ever worry about that. You just tell them how you got your candle lit and that is what's going to mean the most to everyone. It's you can tie in the scriptures and that's good. But do you think Mary Magdalene was opening up her Old Testament and explaining to everyone how that this man that that came Jesus was the Christ? No. &gt;&gt; No. She was telling, "I saw that man when he came out of the tomb after he was dead for three days. &gt;&gt; I saw that man raise the dead. I saw that man heal the sick. I was It was me that seven devils were cast out of. That's what meant the most probably those people that Mary Magdalene was testifying to." Brother Manny, God bless you, my friend. &gt;&gt; Everybody, it's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I'm going to start off. Um, I grew up a Catholic. I was never a a church goer, you know. Uh, I didn't like to go inside the church to see Jesus on the cross. I would start crying and they would tell me, "You have a demon in you." I said, "No, it just don't feel right." I felt out of place. So, I stopped going. So, I would just hang around with my cousins in the neighborhood. I come from one of the oldest neighborhoods in Tucson. My family been there since it was Mexico because Arizona didn't become a state till 1912. So I I grew up in a prideful neighborhood. We were all proud being where we were from. And growing up in the 80s in that neighborhood was was rough. Like the streets would tell stories. You would see the this the the murder scene with the yellow tape, the chalk lines. You know, it was rough growing up in the 80s in my neighborhood. You know, you had to be real or you're not going to make it. So it was really rough. You know, it was different times, different era. My dad, he was like one of the most feared mans in my neighborhood. You know, uh he was very mean, abusive, drug user. My mom was alcoholic. Uh my dad was a drug dealer. You know, that's what he taught us. Uh if you didn't have his money, he would you know what happens, you know. And then I remember it was like I was like seven or eight years old. It was summertime. I went to my grandma's and he was there with his friends and he forced me to smoke a joint and I didn't want to but if I didn't do it he would hit me and I remember his friend telling him man don't get your son eye and he said shut your mouth not in those words but you know he said you don't tell me what to do so then I didn't want to hit him he said don't be a so I just want I I just want to make my dad proud cuz I didn't want to get hit so you know it just went on and then uh around 15, I just got tired of being his punching bag and I left to the streets and I went to the neighborhood where I'm from and became a a gangster, I guess, whatever you want to call it, a gang member. And I was like 15 and and I I was out in the streets and my my friend told me, "Let's go to Aunt Mary's." I go, I really don't want to go there because she was a drug dealer, but it was a safe haven. Like, it's better than getting my butt whoop. So, I went there. I stayed there and before I knew it, I became what I hated the most, a drug dealer. At 15, stopped going to school cuz I thought school wasn't wasn't for me. You know, I was making that fast money and it would just it wasn't right. You know, I was just waiting for my mom or my dad to come get me, but they never did. So, I just ended up just becoming ruthless, heartless, and became I started walking in darkness. You know, when you walk in darkness, you do wickedness. &gt;&gt; And my uncle did 25 years and he came out and tried to tell me about Jesus. And I said, "Where was Jesus when your dad when my dad was beating me up, you know what I mean?" And I said, "Where was God at?" I go, "I don't got time for that." But they're like, "It pricked me." And I I still get the goosebumps. And he's kept on talking about him and I'm like, "Yeah, whatever, dude." You know, and then then like one day he just said, "You got to read it." So I started reading Matthew. He said, "Just just read Matthew." And I started reading Matthew and it got me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It got me. And I like I was like, "Whoa." And then then I started drifting away from the world, but still, you know, you still have your cousins, you spirits me. And then I go back to the world, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I stayed there for a long long long time. doing the work of the devil, destroying lies, marriages, you know, selling selling poison. Like I was like that poor man that oppresses the poor and leaves no food. I didn't know what kind of man I was till I went to prison. You know, I was so selfish that I was taking money from people. Didn't realize that they had bills. Didn't realize they had children. &gt;&gt; I just wanted me is all about me. I was selfish, greedy. My heart was like like titanium. If you have something I want, you didn't want to give it, you're going to give it either way. You're going to break it. You know what I mean? So, uh, like in 2009, uh, my my my wife, my first wife got cancer and, uh, she died of it and it changed it. It really did a number to me. Uh, I was on probation and and and I I was trying to get help. They they sent me to cope, my uh my probation officer. She sent me to cope and uh she goes, "I I want you to meet Danzelle Buchanan." And I was already being a big guy. I go, "Damn, he's a black dude." I like, "Dang." And he goes, "He's from the south side of Chicago. He's up your alley." I like, "Oh, wow. He's going to be a mean guy." And when cuz I'm already reading my Bible, so I'm still reading my Bible. When I see him walk in, I look at him, he has this this white glow around him. And he says, "Who you mad dogging?" I said, "I'm not mad dogging you." I go, "You got the Holy Spirit on you." He goes, "Who you talking to?" I said, "He's telling me." Then he goes, "You know what? I'm going to to school to become a pastor." &gt;&gt; And when we became best friends and and and he baptized me, and then then uh there's that whisper again, got into that whisper, got caught, went to prison, went to prison, I came out, started started walking with God, and once again in that neighborhood, started back in darkness. and and I stayed there till about probably almost 3 years ago. Uh my son and I I was still selling weed and whatever, you know. I had a job, but I still doing doing it because that's more addicting than anything is the money. So, uh we were cruising around doing deliveries and on river and was it Stone and River at the old Sweet Tomatoes. This guy pulls on the side of me and I tell my son, "Look at this guy with the ski mask." I said, "Brace yourself." He said, "For what?" And he shot like four times. He hit me on the side of the head. My son lost his eye. And I think that was like just a sign for God like, "Dude, you went to prison for this. Why you being like the dog returning to his vomit?" &gt;&gt; Right? So sometimes God works in mysterious ways. It might take a little sting like that to Hey, I I got you. I thought I was going to die, but I did. You I was like, my son said, I don't want to die. I think I'm dying. Look at all the blood I'm dripping on. And and my son, I had he's he's a big boy. And I was rocking like he was a baby. I said, "You're not going to die." And I was crying like, "You're not going to die. You're not going to die." So, I'm going to die before you. And then, thank God just it was just birdshot. And thank God it was birdshot. It was a saw off shotgun because if it was a a fuller barrel, I probably wouldn't be here. And I tell everybody, you got to you can't tell me God wasn't with me. &gt;&gt; And that's when everything changed for me. I stopped, put everything away. I told God, separate everything that ain't of you from me. And that was everybody, my cousins, my friends. And I was alone. And I was like, what's happening? Then I remember what you asked for. So, so uh about uh about two years ago, I I met I met this I met this girl uh Grace Sella. Her family came here since for the long time. And uh I asked for God. I asked God, I need a God. I need a woman of God. And I don't care how she comes broken. Care what color she is. Long as she has the same belief I have. And he sent grace. am. That was like one of the best things that ever happened to me that he sent me. My my woman of God, my virtuous wife, she's prudent. She's she's strong in the Lord and she's making me strong. My mother-in-law, she she's has a big influence on me coming to church cuz like I said, I wasn't really a church cohort. And she invited me one day. We were going to Brother's Bakers. That's way out there. and my my mother would work like a 12 or 13 hour shift on Saturday. Don't sleep, go home, shower, and go to church. That's that's a soldier. &gt;&gt; That's a soldier for for for the God for you know what I mean? And so, you know, I just started hanging around and my my heart started chipping that that that titanium. So, it started chipping away. And when uh I got baptized, I went in the water and when I came out cuz I cast all my cares and worries on him and and when I got off of when I came off of that water, I felt all those chains just released &gt;&gt; and and I still feel them. I feel this rush and I don't know how to explain it, but I my cousin said, "You're crazy." I said, "Well, if Jesus is crazy, I'm crazy. I'm crazy for him. &gt;&gt; But that's my testimony I want to share. If Jesus could change a wicked, wretched man like me, he could change anybody. &gt;&gt; You got to keep your faith in him &gt;&gt; and your hope in Jesus because he's the truth, the way, and the life. &gt;&gt; No one comes to the father except through him. Remember. Amen. Thank you. [applause] [applause] Brother Manny walked up there when I was baptizing and didn't expect him to come up. He didn't ask before service or anything. He just he just came up there and uh baptized him. And then a week later, he got my phone number and he texted me and he gave the testimony. He said, "I've done drugs about every day of my life since I've been seven years old." And he said, "When I came up out of the water," he said, "That was the last time I've done drugs." And he said, "It's been seven days now. I wanted to wait till a week was over before I told you." And now that's been over a year. [applause] We have a special blessing tonight. Our brother Steve Brasson is he's tremendous, [snorts] wonderful preacher, very very deep in the scriptures. And uh he's you saw his family here. His family is a testimony to him sitting here in the front row. And you know the Bible teaches us that a pastor is to be judged in part by their family. that their family must be in order and subjection and and respect of their dad. Brother Steve certainly checks all the boxes, but we can see that that's a very very good box that he checks. He's become a good friend of mine over the past few months and I am really excited. He he did a tremendous job last night and I'm really looking forward to what he has for us here this evening. So, let's all stand. Josiah, if you could help me, please. when he reached down his hand [singing] for me. and he reached down his hand for me. I was lost and undone without God [singing] or his son. when he reached down his hand for me. Would you raise your hands to the Lord and sing that again as brother Steve comes? When he reached down his hand for [singing] me. Oh, and he reached [singing] down his hand for me. [singing] I was lost and undone without God or his son. when he [singing] reached down his head &gt;&gt; for me. &gt;&gt; Sing it again. When he reach when he reach out his hand for me. [music and singing] Oh, when he reach out his hand for me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I was lost [singing] standing on with our God for his son.

We're all witness. &gt;&gt; We all witness tonight of the precious grace of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to thank brother Dan for the invitation for all this.

So, we're going to read Psalm chapter 34:E8. If you're there, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and save it such as be of contrite spirit. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we we want to thank you tonight. We are gathering your name. It's a special event for this church and want to celebrate and dedicate this building to you, Lord. But Lord, we also want to remember that we are we are your temple &gt;&gt; and we also want to dedicate oursel to you tonight. You've also Lord did beyond renovate us. Lord, you made us a new creature. And Lord, I pray that you may take this moment tonight that we are in your presence that's you may speak to our hearts and inspire this service. Take control, Lord, of every spirit tonight. So you may have the freedom to move in this place. Move from heart to heart that we may be gathering, Lord, in in one spirit tonight, in one faith, Lord, that we may be edified by your spirit, Lord. We pray. Have your way tonight. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. If I could give this a title tonight, uh, just give me the control. Thanks. So, um, I want to entitle this built from brokenness. And I feel like, you know, in hearing the testimonies, um, last night and tonight, I feel it's appropriate to have this kind of title. But also something that really the Lord touched me. I'm I'm coming back from Congo. We preached several service over there and on the plane from moving around in the country over there, something really struck me and I want to share that with you tonight. And so just to give you a little bit of background about my life, I was I was uh my mom gave her life to the Lord in 1979. So I was two years old. So, I was raised I was raised in the church and and um when I was seven years old, my father left uh left our our life and so I'm Greek. So, he moved back he did move back to Greece. And the night that he announced his departure that he would he would leave us, my mom said I cried all night and she was kind of desperate because she was a bit afraid that I would come like never get over it. It was I was so devastated. I don't remember that. But she said the next day I got up and went to school and seems like I'd forgot about it and I was fine. You know, sometimes is as as kids we we underestimate the impact when something bad happened to them because seems like a couple of days after they're like, well, he's just fine. But they're they're not fine. It's just that there's a co coping mechanism that they'll they'll move on, but it's it stays inside of them. And after that I became uh an anxious an anxious child with a anxiety uh disorder what I fought I fought all my life with that. It's until uh uh later in my life I realized that I was I was affected by that. And I I always thought my mom, you know, she was a Christian, so she prayed, Lord, I I pray that that my son would never be affected by the fact that this dad left and and and so I heard my mom said that. And I always thought that, you know, it was not a big deal. You know, I was raised with my mother and and and you don't know what you're missing if it's not there. It's kind of an invisible pain which is is is it's kind of a tricky because if I've heard the the testimony of a brother here tonight and and he had he had a father that was present and he he he did hurt him. So you can't identify the pain the bruise you can't identify but something that's a bit tricky is that when when when father leaves to be raised in a home with a f father fatherless home is a bit tricky because it's an invisible womb. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's it's a pain caused by something that you've lacked, but you don't know what you've because you don't know what you don't know, but it follows you. And so I was raised I was raised in church and and it was not a positive experience especially for my mother. Uh she struggled for many many years, 15 years in church wondering if her sins were forgiven and she would go see the pastor, do I have the Holy Spirit? And the pastor's yes, you have it. And and there was a lot of spiritual struggle. And so my my mom, you know, being in church and being supposedly being you're in church and you're supposed to be close to the Lord, but she was always affected by this this uh h um lack of spiritual security, feeling that I'm being accepted by God. My sins are being forgiven. And so there's always been a a a level of a certain sadness around our home because something was was spiritually something was lacking. And so I was raised just with my mom and my mom was working obviously she had to make a living and so she uh she was working. So I was I found myself most of the time I was just by myself and so I can I can spell loneliness and you know just wandering in the streets and trying to find some friends and and and I I for me when I remember my childhood I I I I just see the streets and me riding my bicycle going nowhere and and it's it's it's it's a it's a feeling that stays with you and and so I I grew up like that and you know in church and in church and you struggle because you you're in church and they you know that he's a holy God and and this is holy word and there's a call for a holy life but you don't have no victory. So, you're sitting in church and you feel like a hypocrite because because you don't have victory in your life and you know you're you're you're overwhelmed and overcome by sin. And I remember playing guitar in church and it was communion service, brother. Communion service was that when they would announce communion service, I was so afraid. I was like, "Oh Lord, judgment day." And and and and so I remember sitting and being sitting in front, me and my cousin, we're pretty much in the same rut. like we wouldn't have no victory in our life and playing music in church and remember everybody moves forward taking communion and we're sitting there you know like pity and not moving not feeling wordy and and that night would be Lord you know I will do my best and and it's the last time I do this and I'm I'm going to be I'm going to be a better Christian just to find yourself a week later going back to the same thing and living a defeated life in church is is is horrible. It's not like you're you're out there in a bar and like, okay, you can take a stand and give your life to the Lord and go to church. You're in you're in church and so you're supposed to be close to the thing, but you're so far. And so I my mom got spiritually got discouraged when I was 16. She backslid and she left and she even left the home and she went on to live with a man. And just to just before I forget now she when when God called me to the ministry she never missed one service and she was still in the world then because I came back before her and just be before I forgot because sometime I tell the bad part of my mother's testimony and I don't give the good part because I forget and so since I started ministering many years ago she never missed a service. She always wanted to hear a son preaching and she ended up giving her life back to the Lord and she's in our church right now and so she's serving the Lord. And what is amazing [applause] she what is amazing is when she came back she came back on a solid foundation and having a revelation of the grace of God the cross and and and how you know her sins were forgiven and she she never looked back and that the sin question was settled for her and which is which is a good news because it's horrible to spend 15 years in a church wondering if God has accepted you and has my sins been forgiven or there's God is holding this against me and So going back uh uh uh to so at 16 she she backslid and she she left and she even left home and so at 16 I end I ended up living by myself in the house and I never realized that what's you know when you're young you just go with the flow you don't think you just you know it's it's you go by instinct so you just go with it it's just until my son got 16 and I looked at my son he was 16 and like really &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; is that age I found myself alone in the house like oh my goodness that was that was not good like I don't imagine doing that to my son you know but my mom out of despair and with the sadness and all that she she was trying to find happiness somewhere and so I when she left I'm like no I'm going to stay you know I'm going to stay and and and I'm going to serve God I'm not in I'm not serving God I'm not in church because of my mother I'm there because I I made a decision because I I got baptized at 8 years old I forgot to say that and I remember I was playing in in the house and and something came down on me and and and I I I and I got up and I went to see my mother and I says I want to be a Christian and that was sincere really the presence of God came on me and it was like one of my first experience with God but then after that I started struggling with many things you know holiness and you know sexual temptation and all that you know and you fall and you get up back up and you fall again and that you get discouraged of living a defeated life. And so at 17, I ended up backsliding and going in the world for four years and and I went and everything I I I could. And I I remember though when I left uh I I was raised uh our our church was in Montreal and it was downtown and so it was a rough part of Montreal and and so I've seen drug addict before and I've heard many testimony of drug addiction. And so when I when I when I left church and I went in the world, I remember I told myself there's I I've I've put only one limit. I'll I'll never do drugs because I knew that there is nothing there because I've seen so many people coming out of it and with their testimony uh like we heard tonight when you hear that as a kid it's you get you get it that okay there's nothing there. And so I went in the world and you know you know the bars and sports and I did a lot of things and and the girls and everything but but you're you're seeking for pleasure you know you're you're going for pleasure and and and at one point you know you it's it's the bars and then the bars close up and that during that time they started to do some raves. So raves was that that where you go places you have to take ecstasy. So, uh, after the bar closed, then you go and then after the rave was not enough. They invented the after rave. So, that the the sun would get up and then you go on the beach and then there's that music and all that. But you So, you go full around the clock, but I had a problem. I was not doing drugs and I was surrounded by people on ecstasy, you know, and and they can go around the clock because they're they on speed, but you're not. And so, at one point, I had to make a decision. If I want to follow that kind of pace, I need to do drugs. And that's where I realized that I was not going anywhere. And during that period of time, you know, with that lifestyle, I was I was working on in a printing uh business and I was doing like $825 an hour, but my lifestyle was more much more expensive than that. So, I had a problem with money. Uh I was short on money but my friend was always coming and he he had this you know you know he was paying you know all right guy you know it's on me and he would I was like and I knew like he was working in another shop and he was not doing much more money than you know he's like where do you take all that money bro like ah you know forget about it you know so he always had this big chunk of money and and he's like and I and I kept you know I kept bugging him I was like I want to know where do you get this money and he didn't want to and this this this this guy, we grew up in in church together and um he backslid before me and when I started to drifting, I started to hang out with him and he was he was all cool, all nice and he he he became a real friend, but a bad friend, but he was a real friend. He was all nice with me and he never wanted to influence me for me to leave church. He never said anything. He just what he did, he cared for me. He loved me and he was a good friend. And that's what I needed. I needed a good friend, somebody who cared for me. And and that's why sometime when you don't have the real love and the real attention, you'll go you'll you'll go get it somewhere else. And and and that's where you end up with having bad friends. A lot of people a lot of young people end up in gangs and street gangs and all that. And they they at first they don't do that to become evil or to do bad things. The first portion sometime is just that well it's it's my only family. They accepted me and they look for care. They look for acceptance and and and they get it there and then it comes with the rest. And so I ended up backsliding and and and and I I was bugging him. I wanted to know where you get all that money. I want that kind of money. Me too. And he finally told me that he was he was he was stealing money in stores. And the way he was doing is that in in the groceries these days, you know, the the manager would go from cash cashier to cashier. He grabbed all the money, put that in a tube, and then they would put that in a in a tube and and it would go up, you know, in in the office there. And so while they were going from casher to casher, we you you could grab the envelope at the end and then just run away with it. And so that's what he was doing. So I'm like, "Yeah, that seems like a good idea. I want to do that, you know, because I wanted the money to support my lifestyle." And so but we we we planned another coup that another old up that we wanted to do. It was a big store and during those days people were paying there was a lot of cash going on. and it was less plastic and credit card. And so we kind of planned this that when he was leaving the store at 9:00, he was he was driving his car and getting close to getting close to the bank and he was doing that night deposit, you know, just open put the money and and so my my friend had a a shotgun. And so we we kind of prepare that and we were we were supposed to rub him. And so one night, so every Thursday night, which was the big night, uh uh we we watch couple of Thursday night, we watch him doing his deposit. Okay. He was always on time. We were parked there in the parking lot just looking at him. Okay, he's is this he's on time and all that. And so one night, one Thursday night, we decided, okay, let's go. Let's let's go do this. And so I was the driver and um he had the shotgun. And so I had my own car, not the plates, not covered like it's a it's like just, you know, junior uh junior Bandido. And so the manager comes with his car, get out of his car. My friend is sitting just by the just on the sidewalk there and he's waiting for him to to get out of his car just to pull out his gun, grab the money. But the the manager get out of his car, pass by him, and my friend doesn't move. And he does a disobite. He leaves. He leaves. And then I was so mad. So I got in my car and I came to close to him. I started yelling, "What's your problem? What's your what?" He said, "I don't know. I froze, man. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just froze. I I I couldn't do it. And I was like, "Man," and I was so mad. I was mad after him, but I don't know I would have the courage to do it myself, but I was the driver, so I was doing my part. And so he says, "No, man. I'm sorry. Next week we're going to do it next week." So I says, "Well, you better like next week we're going to do this." And uh so finally the next week uh we're supposed to do that at 9:00. But he comes around and he says, "You know what? we going to do? We going to we going to uh uh do go to this grocery store and we going to go, you know, and so he wanted and that was like a $3,000 robbery, a small one. The other one with the big store was probably 50 50,000 maybe 100,000. There's a lot of money going on. And so he decided and so just like that, we decided to do this small little hold up and think like not much. And then we got caught on that one. So after when you become a Christian, you realize probably Angel of God was standing there for him to froze because God that's not what that was not my calling. So God wanted to make sure I got a short career in in in in crime in crime. And so I got caught for a small thing and I ended up in jail that night. And and that was one of the first, you know, one of her first blow where where God knocks at your door. I cried. I remember I had broken with my girlfriend the day before. And I was I was broken. I was crying. And I was just this little church little boy. Now I'm 18year-old. And I remember I did the old up with my church shoes. And I remember when they got me into jail, you know, they rip my shoes apart and you know, they treat you rough. And I remember the they always the detective comes, you know, and there's the good cup and the bad cup, the ones the rough guy and the and so he's they wake me up at 4:00 in the morning and and sat me there and and then the rough cup starts, you know, and they wanted to lick me link me with all the oldups that happened in the city. Like they they didn't believe I was I was a starter. [laughter] And so I said, "No, it's my first. It's my first." And then he bang on on the table and he he he he was trying to rough me up and it worked cuz I started crying. So when I started crying, he's like, "Okay, this is not a tough guy. This is like this is like a this is a softy." So he then the the good cop came and he says, "Okay, let's call the somebody you want to call." And I called my mom and but but something broke something broke there inside of me. And and and the next step was when I was doing raves and I then I realized the next step I needed to take drugs and I realized I saw the line that I draw myself and I'm like now do I do I step over this line or not? And that's where I realized and that's I was going nowhere and that God was calling me home because I knew I knew better. And I remember that night I I went by my bed and I was not crying. I was not emotional. There was this was a r rational decision. I just, you know, went on my knees just by my bed and I said, "Lord, I've been leading my own life for four years and I'm going nowhere. I'm going in circle." And I knew I was going nowhere. And just the fact that Lord, I'm going nowhere and I'm giving you my life. I I repented of my sins and I said, "Lord, I'm giving you the control of my life. Take the control back." And I started going back to church and I was really on fire for God. And then I got an experience with God. Holy Spirit came in my life and that's where I started to have a call for the ministry. In the same time that happened, the call for the ministry, God showed me that Esther was would be my wife. And it it's weird because I was struggling because all the youth, all the young people knew in in our church that Esther had a special call that she would marry a minister. So when God started dealing with me that I would should marry her, I was like, "No, Lord, like she's reserved for a minister. Like I'm I'm this is not a question. I will I cannot marry her." and and at the same time separately two separate box God was calling me to the ministry and I was struggling and I was fighting it and I was fighting it and I was so I was fighting both ideas separately and the day that God really clenched the nail is that he I remember I was working on the night shift at a printing shop and and God came down it's it was not an audible voice but it felt like one and God told me the minister that Esther is going to marry is you. And then it dawned on me like, "Wow, I never thought about that." And that that day it was settled. And so we moved on and and we got married and I was ministering during that time and we started to have children. And this is where the part of the min the the the meeting that my testimony that I want to convey to you. And so I had accepted the Lord as my savior. He has saved me from my sins. He saved me from a from the filth and perversion and all that. He cleansed me and and when I when he called me to the ministry, he became he became my lord. He became because there's a difference between savior and lord. &gt;&gt; You know, as savior, he saved you from something. He pulls you out of the water. But lord is after he pulled you out of the water, your reaction is is now Lord, I want to follow you. You're going to be my Lord. Which is a different thing. And and when that happened, you know, there's a difference between uh uh when he when he saves you and the difference when he becomes your Lord. There's, you know, in modern religion, modern Christianity today is, you know, Jesus says, you know, come as you are. And it's true. Come as you are. Jesus will accept you as you are. Come as you are. But the next step is Jesus message. Jesus message is not stay as you are. &gt;&gt; He has a life for you. &gt;&gt; He has a plan for you. Yeah. He save you as you are. But then if you keep your heart open to the Lord, he's going to re he has a life for you. And when he has a life for you, he has a plan for you. If if I if if you'd have told me when I was 18, when I gave uh when I was 21 and I gave my life to the Lord, if you'd have told me that one day I would be a pastor and I would travel and I had five children and and all of that, I would have panicked. I had no clue that when he got me out of the world, this little little boy, no name and nobody anxious little nobody that when God called me, he had a full life ahead of me. &gt;&gt; Every detail was already prepared. He had children. He had a wife. He had a life. He had a calling. He had so many things. But I was clueless. But that's where he became my Lord. So I started to have children one after the other. We we had a lot of children in a short time. We had five in seven years. And I do not advise anyone to do that. Now today I don't I don't regret it. It's it's it's it's marvelous. They're all almost the same age and they have a lot of fun. But at first it was it was a big challenge and and I owe a lot to my wife because she came from a balanced what let's call it a normal family a father and a mother Christian serving the Lord and she had they were they were five and so she knew what family life was she knew what a father was she knew what a mom was and so but for me I came from such a broken family and I never imagined I would be affected as a father I never imagined that it would it would hinder me. And so I owe a lot to my wife to kind of kept the balance and and so I was I was a minister. I loved the Lord, the Holy Spirit, and God used you in your ministry. But when you come back home, I was a poor father because something was lacking in my life. Something was missing. But at first, I didn't know it. And it's until until that I got my third child started to realize that something was lacking in my life. And and all those years even though I became a Christian and I was serving God and had supernatural experience with God, a call in my life, when the anointing was on me preaching, I felt I felt invincible. I felt so happy. I felt like I was on top of everything. But when the anointing was leaving, I was fighting depression. I was fight I felt I felt broken. And that brokenness followed me all the time. And it became it. So I would I was carrying that he heaviness and I was wondering why. And so it made me a father that was distant that was not really involved and and and so and I was wondering what's wrong with me. I'm a Christian. I'm sure I I'm supposed to be happy. But that brokenness I was carrying this I would I would struggle to get up in the morning. Always this this dark cloud following you. And when the anointing was on me, that cloud would leave me and God would use me. But after that, I would I would go back to my default settings. Now, I had the Holy Spirit. I loved the Lord, but something was lacking in my life. And I didn't know what it was. And I carried that for many, many, many, many years. And I and I tried to to to to bring these things to the Lord and pray. And Lord, you know, there's my heart is trouble and I don't know what it is. And I did a lot of things. Tried to find the answer. But I I couldn't find I I couldn't find the answer to that brokenness, through those defeated thoughts, that depression, that that depressed feeling that I was carrying. When I got close to 40 years old, I decided to look for my father. And I had this thought. I said I said if I don't do it now, uh my father was around 70 years old. And I and so I my father reappeared in my life when I was 22 when I was about to get married. So he stayed he was at my wedding and then he disappeared again for all those years. So when I'm 40 years old around I think I was 38 I start to look for him start to wanted to find him and so I I went on Facebook and I so my father's Greek so I had to type his name and and then type his name type I have two brothers over there in Greece that doesn't know I exist and so I was typing I I know their names so I was typing their names and and I spent hours and hours on Facebook trying to find them and and I couldn't find it until I see a picture of my father doing barbecue. He's cooking some meat with his son, which is my brother. And when I saw that picture, it's like it's like I was hit by a truck. The the the negative impact it was it was in my heart my my my head started spinning and that question was so that sorry that picture was so violent. That picture was so brutal because that picture was asking a question. It was asking the question that I had in my heart and I was not aware the level of pain when that picture when I saw that picture all that pain came out as a volcano and I was overwhelmed. I was I was it was it was too much because that picture was like this is my brother. He's allowed to be with his father. He's my father. He's my brother. But I'm out of that picture. Why? Why that question? Why? Why I was not allowed to have a normal family? Why I was not allowed to be raised like other like my friends? They had a father. They could do projects. They could do this. And I never had that. And so I'm a pastor. I'm a minister. I have five children. But still that that that that that pain that I carried, it was still there. That brokenness was still there. And so I ended up contacting my mother. We contacted a friend because my my my father was a restaurant owner when he was in Quebec and his friend was a restaurant owner. So make a long story short, he contacted my father. My father called me and we ended up making a couple of phone calls. And dur during the first phone calls, he's like, "You know what, Steve?" He said, "Yep." He says, "You're going to come to Greece?" And he says, "I'm going to have you at my home and I'm going to introduce you your brothers." And and so when I was on the phone, I was so excited. I was like, "Finally, I'll have a family. Finally, my father's going to receive me in his home." And I was so excited. I was so I was so looking forward to do this this trip in Greece. And finally, because you know what? The the a mother's great, but what makes it home is the father's home. And I never realized that I never felt at home even. And that's why I was wandering in the streets because I was never I never felt I belong anywhere. And even when I started my own home with my children, I was still wondering. I was still I would often leave my wife for the children and go out and restaurant. Guess what? I was almost born in a restaurant. My father was a restaurant owner owner. And I would leave and my wife would be would be puzzled. What what's wrong with my husband? Like when he doesn't feel good, he leaves the house and he doesn't come until late in the afternoon. I was wondering and wondering and and it's until I realized that my father never received me in his home that wandering spirit feeling like you don't belong nowhere. Now I was a Christian. I still I still felt that way. And so the next phone call my father called me again. He says, "You know what, Steve? I thought I thought about it and and during that time Greece was going through a financial crisis and there's riots in the streets and my brother has lost their business. They lost their money and so my father said, "You know what, Steve? It's not a good time. Your brother doesn't do good and it's not time to come up with, you know, family issues like that." So, you know what? She says, "When are you going to come? We're going to meet in a restaurant." And when he said that, I just like I just like crush. I hung up the phone and I sat on my lazy boy in my office and I was I was crushed. Like I thought I thought I could make it finally and like you're getting your door slam in your face. That was so brutal. And I was so in pain. I remember I open I opened my Bible and when I opened my Bible is that remote you can maybe switch. Uh, okay. When I open my Bible, I'd open in John 14 verse one and it says, "Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. And if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. Oh, my heart felt so much joy. I remember I went up and went to see my wife and it says, "Honey, look, the Lord just spoke to me." And it was the first time, remember I said, "God God was my savior." That was that was that was clear as clear can be. And he he became my Lord. I was a I was like a soldier. If if God asked me to do something, yes, Lord, he was my Lord. I would, but I was like a soldier. But it was the first time that God spoke to me as a father. And that was totally new to me that he would speak to me in the channel of being my father. And now when my father let me down, God stepped in the scene and he became my father. And he said, "That man won't receive you in his house, but I I prepared a place for you. So let your heart not be troubled because I was deeply troubled. But now my father in heaven stepped down to to step down in that brokenness. And he told me he said and and he used that scripture and I was so I was so blessed. I was so touched but still my mind was set. I want I want that natural father which is a good desire. There's nothing wrong about it. And so I kept and so I did two trips in Greece with my wife and I met him and I remember one of the I think it's yes it's on the first trip we were sitting there at the the at the table and he kept he start to talk to me and when he talked to me he he he he touched my arm like this and when he touched my arm my head started like you know like you know when everything shift and I look at him and I was like whoa the touch of a father. I didn't know what it was. And so me be be being so distant with my own children. Guess what? When I came back from that trip, I knew now the power of a father, just a touch of a father, what it means for a child. You actually you're telling your son, you're telling your daughter, you actually you exist. You're affirming them. you're and so that's where I got the revelation. I was 40 some but when my father touched me I realized oh my goodness and so the third trip we went and I wanted my father to meet my children. So guess what you know at grandpa usually you meet your grandkids one at a time every year, two years, three years. He met his all five within 15 minutes. And so they all went on the on the in the separate room and all dressed nice and we were sitting in the living room and then I I I I introduced every child one at a time and this is uh William and this is Mary and oh nice to meet you Mary and we all sat in the living room and when we sat in the living room the one of the first thing he told my kids is you are Greek and it was so important for him for for my children to understand you're not Canadian you're not from Quebec. You are Greek and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You have Greek blood and you are Greek. And so that's him talking in the living room and all kids looking and thinking that was quite funny. And and I realized that for him, you know, the origin was really important. And that really inspired me a message that I'm not preaching tonight, but what is our real origin? When Jesus came on earth, he says, "I come from God. and I go back to God. On your first birth here on earth, born of this flesh, you have origin. You're from Tucson. You're from this. You're from that country, that country. But when you're born again, there's something different setting in. Your origin isn't from heaven because you're born of the spirit of God and and your name was in that book and that's your true origin and that changes everything. And so we were sitting there in the living room and then we we moved on to the kitchen around the table and we started talking and and and my father's Greek so he's the Greek are like that, the Arabs are like that and I think the Jews are like that. So the lineage is really important. The lineage goes through the son. So I have four daughters but one's missing is my my my son, my oldest son. He's he's married and he has a he has a baby, so he doesn't follow us anymore. So he has his own life now. But so my father totally turned towards my my son and and yeah the girls are nice. Oh, you're cute girls. But now he focused my son because now he wanted to transfer all his wisdom. You know when the Bible says that that uh Greeks require a sign, but the uh Jews require a sign, but the Greek seeks after wisdom. I've witnessed that. He was sitting there at the table and you look he's like this and he's he's talking to his his his grandson. is like, you know, you got to think, son. And he's trying to transfer all his wisdom and he's there giving all kinds of advice about life and about this and but he's not a Christian. So all his wisdom was not worth much because it was not based on the Bible. So, we're all listening to him and and and but he's at my son and he's like, you know, William, now you need to realize this is really important in life and when you get married, you got to find this kind of wife and and don't let her and this and that and oh, he had a lot to say. And we're all sitting there and listening. And then at one point he get to this and he said, he says, "You know what, William?" He said, "There's something I want you to learn." He says, "There's a song I want you to listen." He says, "I want you to listen to that song every day." And he says that song if you listen it to every day you're going to get something out of that song every day. It's like for us when we read the Bible we might have read the verse many time but the word is alive. It's not just letters. It's more than letters. It's spirit and life. So you read the scripture you know it but but it's alive. You get something out of your Bible even though you read it before. And so he was applying the same principle for that song. And he says it's really important. We were all curious what is that song? He says William it's really important. you got to listen to this, listen to that. And so at at one point it says and the song is he says it's it's I did it my way from Frank Sinatra. But now brother Matt Watkins uh Matthew you know you know he's he's been here one of my close friend. And so he had been at our church a couple of months before and he had spoke about that song of Frank Sinatra. I did it my way. And he he told the church he preached and he says this is one of the most satanic song out there because it's I did it my way. And actually Elvis Presley one of his last show maybe his last show he pulled out a paper out of his pocket and he turned to his band and that's what he sang. He's saying, "I did it my way." Because that song is like it pretty much it says, you know, I've I've I've I've lived the life I wanted and I and I sometime, you know, I I took a bite that I could barely chew, but at the end I don't, the song says pretty much I live the life I wanted and at the end I don't regret it. Why? Because I did it my way. &gt;&gt; And so it's self-will, you know, and all that. And so, Brother Matt had preached that this is so this is the most satanic song. And there my father's trying to tell my son that he needs to listen to that every day and he going to learn something and get something out of it every day. So we all look at each other around the table with a smirk, you know, respectfully. We I respected my dad. We didn't say nothing but we were like, "Okay." And so that night I went to bed and I don't know if I slept that night because my that night felt like a vision and all I can remember is that the full night was God showed me my whole life and that was an appointment that night that God had set up for me. I I I didn't see it coming. And the first thing he did is he showed me when I was in the street wandering and he showed me at a young boy and he showed me the street of my of my youth where I was wandering in the streets and he showed me that I was going from store to store and one of the store was a sports store because for me when I was young I I try to compensate that that emptiness and that anxiety with like and trying to find some comfort and find some identity in sport. So I was I was in sport heavy a lot. And so he showed me I'm I'm I'm I'm in the window and looking at the sports store. Then I go to the next store and it's an adult, you know, a perversion, sexual stores with with all and and and he shows me all the temptation of my childhood and how I'm wandering and I'm and I'm and I'm have nowhere to go and I'm I'm going into one temptation after the other. And then God told me and he said, "Then he showed me my son and my dad talking at the table, but now I'm outside the picture and I'm looking and he says, "You see now," he says, "you see your father how he's talking to your son." He says, "Your son would have been you." And he said, "If I would have let you being raised by that man, he would have fill you and confuse you and fill your head with all that nonsense." &gt;&gt; And and he showed me and then it it struck me because yes, William was me and that was my father. And he so God told me, he says, "That's why I removed this man out of your life because I had a call for you. had a special call and I didn't allow that man to stay in your life to confuse you because he has no part in the inheritance and in the call I have for you. &gt;&gt; And then he showed me that at a at a young age where my mom brought me to church and that the voice of my father was replaced by the voice of the prophet William Brham and that was the male voice that carried me all my childhood. A voice that would guide me. a voice on earth that would guide me. &gt;&gt; And then he showed me while I was driving from Athen to Patras, which is the city of my father. I was driving the car and kids were sleeping in the back and I had a message of William Brown playing and he showed me, he says, "You see," and he showed me me in the car listening to that voice and God told me and he says, "I've I've replaced the voice of your father by that voice." And he said, and he says, 'The reason why I did that is because I have I have called you and you have a special call. And now when God talks to you like that, I can say that when I went to bed that night, I went to bed as a victim of life, a fatherless kid, broken. And I was still carrying that brokenness with me. Even though I was loving the Lord, I was married. I had I had wonderful kids. I had a ministry. I would carry and fight that brokenness. But when that night God revealed that to me, I can say that I went I went in bed that night as a victim of life. But when I get up that morning, I I I got up out of the bed as a VIP of the Lord. I felt special. I felt reserved. And that's where God stepped in my life in a greater measure than my savior, my lord. But that's where he became my father. And he revealed to me the purpose of my life which I already partially knew because I was preaching. I knew I was serving God. But it took such a level such a it it filled my heart in such a level. I've I've never been the same man after that. It it that experiences transformed me because God has revealed to me the purpose of my life. If God would not have a purpose behind your trial, &gt;&gt; if God would not have a purpose behind your broken life, &gt;&gt; I've heard testimony in all testimony, you had a I would say a more broken background. Mine was soft, but it broke me anyway. &gt;&gt; If your heart's broken, it's broken. So, it's not about who got broke the more the most. &gt;&gt; Broken is broken, brother. But God wants to come down and reveal the reason. He has a plan. And what I thought was unfair, what I thought was a mistake, what I thought what God where was God, where did did he did he see that and did nothing. &gt;&gt; But when God steps down in your life and reveal I have a purpose. &gt;&gt; I am doing something. And your childhood is part of a plan of something I want to do for you later. And I remember one day I was like, Lord, why why I'M SO BROKEN? WHY WHY WAS I raised in such a sad environment? And it was just such brokenness. And and and there also another thing God told me. He said, God says, I want to use that. &gt;&gt; This is why in my in not my ministry, but the Lord, the ministry he gave me, I have such a burden for family. I have such burden for youth. I have such burden for people who have such a broken background because I I feel it. But I'm also a witness that God God wants to step down in your life and have a personal conversation with you. &gt;&gt; And that night, God told me, he said, "I would have told you before, but he says, you didn't want to listen &gt;&gt; because that day on the lazy boy, God already said I am your father, but I kept wanting that my way. I want that. I want that." and I had to go to that journey. But there was an appointment for me in Greece that night. I woke up that morning a different man. And that night felt like I I felt like I didn't sleep. I felt like my whole night was a vision where God was speaking to me. And what is amazing is that when God tells you something, when God reveals you something, he doesn't give you information. A revelation from God is not information. A revelation from God is like he's downloading in you a new identity. &gt;&gt; When I got up that morning is not like, oh, now I know that this was better. When I got up that morning, I became that. &gt;&gt; It's not I know. I feel it. This is now who I am. Now when I got up that morning, I would have been the one to say that was the best for me. That was the best thing he could do because what God had in store for me was better than whatever my dad could provide for me. &gt;&gt; Now, that story doesn't apply to everyone. Some of you have had good fathers, Christian fathers, or even a good father who was there for you. And so, that story doesn't apply. You don't have to kick your father out of your life to for God to be your father. But it's just an example that whatever whatever was broken in your life, whatever whatever you think that is it it it was a mistake and it was an injustice and it was never supposed to be that way. I invite you to have a conversation with Lord with the Lord and say Lord because the victim question is why did I go through this and it was an injustice and the victim questions because we still we ask victim questions we remain a victim &gt;&gt; because the dialogue is all about me being a victim and me suffering and I and and I know what it is. I've asked victim questions way too long. But the other question is a freedom question is Lord was there a purpose for that &gt;&gt; did did like you just looking somewhere else and then Satan sleeping and destroy my family or was it part of a plan and Lord if that was part of a plan what were you doing can you show it to me and that changes you because you're no more a victim of life you're part of a greater plan. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus says in the same scripture John 14 we read verse 1 2 and three but John 14 verse 18 it's the Lord says I will not leave you comfortless now the word comfortless in Greek is orphanos orphanos which mean fatherless which is sense but it's not just orphan because orphan in America and the way we use is both parents are missing but in that Greek word the general meaning of that Greek word comfortless which mean orphan or fatherless means deprive of parental protection. So sometime you had parents but you were not protected and a child has not been protected will be broken. But Jesus said I will not leave you deprived of parent parental protection because he says I will come to you. Jesus says I will come to you. That's a promise and I'm a witness tonight that he came. And some of you might say he came late. Yeah, he came late because I start to ask those question late. And then when I start to ask those question, I asked those questions for many years and the Lord says I would have told you I would have come before. But says you didn't want to. Because sometimes you know what we ask a question but we already want the answer we want. &gt;&gt; Why I didn't have a father? Because I I I feel pity for myself. Why? It is because I'm a victim. Because well, nothing good can happen to me. I was always negative. If something bad, you're doing something, you're doing your project and it fails. Now, of course, of course, it fails. Of course, because I touch it's going to fail. Yeah, I know. And and we feel this way. And it's and and and when we speak like that, we speak from our brokenness. And my wife would like, Steve, stop talking about it because she didn't feel this way. No, it didn't work. So you you you do it and it's going to work. No, no, no. It's because I touched it. Everything I touched doesn't work. And you're mad. You're mad after life. You're mad everything. And of course, after a while, you just sabotage yourself. You kind of auto prophesy yourself to failure. And it's a vicious cycle. It's a defeated life. But when we when we're like that, we do it from our brokenness. But God says Jesus says, "I will come to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's his desire. and and I'm a witness tonight that he did it for me. And if he did it for me, he can do it for you. &gt;&gt; Psalm 68 says that he wants to be a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is God in his holy habitation. So fatherless here in the Old Testament means to to be lonely. He wants to be a father to those who are lonely. I can spell spell lonely. There's I'm sure there's people here who knows that. But I want you to know that God wants to be the father of those who's been lonely. He's He's real. And that's our opening scripture we talked about here. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart. He's nigh. He wants to come close to you. But sometime we feel like because we have that brokenness, we feel that this disqualify us from having a relationship with God. And what I want to show you through the scripture is that the Lord's promise is that I'm getting close to those who are broken. But for us, we feel disqualified. Lord, I'm way too broken. I'm I'm shattered to pieces. There's nothing you can do. I'm not I'm no good for nothing. But the Bible says the contrary. He health the broken in heart. Now, broken heart here in the Old Testament, if you break up the word is inner man broke in pieces. The inner man is broke in pieces. &gt;&gt; And we had testimony yesterday. I think I heard that, you know, shattered inside. You might look great outside, but inside it's shattered. It's broken. The Lord says, "I want to be close for to to them that are brokenhearted." He's interested in you. But sometime we feel our brokenness disqualify us. But Jesus says, "No, that's not the case." And so when we talk about the good news of the gospel, you know gospel means good news. There is a good news &gt;&gt; and that was prophesied in the Old Testament in Isaiah 61 when Isaiah prophesies the spirit of the Lord of God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings uh unto the meek and he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty. So when Jesus was in the temple and he opened the scroll that's the scripture he read and you find out in the book of Luke 4:18 and he repeat that same scriptures and he read it and he says the spirit of the lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel. What's the meaning of the word gospel? Gospel mean it's a good news. The good news is what? I came to heal the brokenhearted. I came to heal those that the inner man is broken and shattered in pieces &gt;&gt; which we felt for many years that that was that would disqualify us that would keep us away. We don't deserve to be in church. I'm way too broken. People in church are perfect. And that's why I was talking yesterday as a church. We need to be geared toward receiving people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That are broken. And the reason I open my heart tonight is maybe you look at me as a pastor and says, "Well, he got all figured out and he has beautiful children. They all No, you need to know that God can take a broken pieces, broken vessel and restore it and build it and give it a life. [applause] That call is not for perfect people or people who look good. He take us there on the side of the streets and he built us back. That's my title tonight. Built from brokenness. &gt;&gt; That's why I opened my heart because sometime people they come to church and say, "Oh, people in church, they look all perfect." That's why even though you are in church for many years, never forget where you come from. &gt;&gt; Because if you forget where you come from, you'll never able to receive broken people. That's good. &gt;&gt; But if you remember where you come from, you're never that far in saying, "Lord, you did it to me. You can do it for this man. Come out of the street and he's all broken and all he's all in pieces, but you receive it with our wide arms." Because like you you and you have a testimony, God, I was broken like you were broke. There's hope &gt;&gt; and you become a witness in your own church. And that's how a church can be welcoming. It's a church. The church is supposed to be a hospital. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus says, "I came to heal the brokenhearted." That's the first when he gave his mission. That's what he says. That's why I came. I came to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, and set at liberty them that are bruises. Do you know that there's a link to all those words? It's a link of cause and effect. Because brokenhearted, when you're brokenhearted, it will lead you to captivity. Because out of our brokenness, that's that's why we that's WHY WE DRINK. THAT'S WHY WE DO DRUGS, because we're trying to find comfort. That's why we go in sexual perversion because we're trying to kill the pain and alcohol and per sexual perversion. These are all painkillers &gt;&gt; and and and well, you know, you know, well, well, I was really bad. I went so far. But you know what? If you take aspirin, if I see you take one aspirin, tilenol, I'm like, okay, you know, you got a headache. You know, I understand you take one. But if I see you take the whole butt onto like, "Oh man, he's really in pain." I mean, woo. All right. It's the same thing. How far went you did you go to the word in the world? How deep did you go? Will tell me how much pain you had inside. &gt;&gt; You had to go so far just to try to find comfort. &gt;&gt; The devil has a lot of violent substitute. But Jesus said, "I will send you the comforter." &gt;&gt; Amen. For many years, I wondered why why why comforter until God showed me be my own brokenness because I didn't realize I was carrying that heaviness and that brokenness and I didn't realize I was carrying it. I thought I was all right because I was a Christian. &gt;&gt; I thought I thought me becoming Christian has fixed me everything. &gt;&gt; But when I realized that I was not handling my family right and I was looking in my own children eyes that they they they were afraid of me. There was something that was lacking. I said, "Lord, there's something I'm broken. I'm not able to give. &gt;&gt; I didn't receive it. I'm not able to give it. &gt;&gt; So, was I condemned? Was I condemned to be a poor father all my life? Or God was able to restore me &gt;&gt; so I can become the father that I didn't have? &gt;&gt; So that generational curse can stop. &gt;&gt; And that's why the the privilege of the new birth is so amazing because it stopped generational curse. Your family was drinking and they were drunker and they were destroying the family. New birth. God steps in your life and say it stops with you. &gt;&gt; This is the good news. It stop with you and I will not change you on the outward. I will heal your brokenness because all your bad behavior is caused by the brokenness inside of you. So I'm going to heal, restore, remove that brokenness. And your taste and your thirst and your desire will change. You won't desire destruction anymore because I'll remove the destruction from inside of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So brokenhearted leads us to captivity. We become captives. We become we become bound to addiction. Why? Because we're broken. &gt;&gt; And when we're captive, it brings us in blindness. We become blind to the style of life. Like our brother testified. He says, he says, "I didn't realize I destroyed life. I didn't realize I destroyed family because why? Because of the brokenness. You become captive. You become addicted. And be when you're addicted, you become BLIND TO TO ALL THE BAD THAT we do. &gt;&gt; And when we do that, WE GET BRUISED EVEN MORE. YOU SEE THE CYCLE? And out of that bruise, out of our brokenness, we repeat the cycle and we go down. we go down until the Lord steps in our life and brings light and brings the blood of Jesus that can cleanse our heart and change our life and heal that brokenness and that is the good news of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In closing, I'm just coming back from Congo and I preached to a lot of people. I preach to most people I never seen in my life. Thousands of people can't go there, big churches and and and I and I and I and I preach on the these kind of things and because you know what sometimes churches they get caught up into they want the big spiritual things, the mysteries and the depth of God and it it's all good. I don't I don't despise that. It's part of the gospel. But sometime we forgot the basics and while we feast on great spiritual things and we go back in our home and our homes are still broken. &gt;&gt; And so I did this family series in two cities in Congo and pre preached to thousands of people and I was I was exhausted. I was it's it's it's really asking you a lot. And then I got on the plane and I they closed the line in the plane. People are falling asleep and I'm sitting there and suddenly it strikes me and God showed me the little boy I was in my little when I was young this little broken boy that I was and then he showed me preaching to thousands of people and then I started crying and that's where God showed me he says you know what I took this little boy this broken little boy but because you gave that brokenness goodness to me. &gt;&gt; I was able to take you and bring you and use you in a way that you never thought would be possible. &gt;&gt; And it reminded me of that story of that little boy. You know, one day there was thousands of people. They were starving. Jesus finished preaching and there's no food and people are starving and they're looking for bread and they're looking and and finally there's a little boy who steps in. He has a lunchbox and that that boy steps in with his lunchbox and he has five loaf of bread and two small fish. That's all he had which was which compared feeding 5,000 men is nothing. And there's a there's a powerful lesson there because that lunchbox in the hands of that boy was nothing. But when when that young boy brought that lunchbox to the Lord and gave whatever he had, God took that and was able to feed 5,000 men, not counting the children and not counting the the woman. And that's what God showed me in that plane. He says, "Because you gave me your brokenness. You didn't run away from me. You came to me." And sometime we feel so little. Especially if you're a new convert, you're just coming to church. You feel overwhelmed. Lord, like where where do I start? And and I see those Christians, they've been there for years. And what can you do with me? And and and the devil want to step in and discourage you like there's you're nothing and you're never amount to nothing. And my my my final say tonight is bring your two fish and your five bread. Well, I don't have five forever. Bring whatever you had. Bring your nothingness to the Lord and see him multiplied for his glory because it won't be about you. I'm not here tonight about myself. Even though I gave my testimony, it's not about myself. It's about what God wants to do in your life. It's about you tonight. Bring this brokenness. bring this life of you think you some some of us were so broken we despise our I was so had such a spirit of such a defeated spirit I would I would despise myself that's what brokenness do we we don't we we have such a low self-esteem so we feel like running away from God like I'm not worthy and it's not even you even though if I don't show up at church nobody cares even God won't see it and and we we carry those thoughts those defeated thoughts, negative thoughts. Imagine if that young man, young boy sitting there, he's looking his lung brush like, forget it. Like, who has food? Like, better hide it. Stop hiding whatever you have in your life. &gt;&gt; It's not much. It's negative. I have nothing to bring. Bring this nothingness. Believe me tonight if you can hear my voice. Bring whatever you have and give it to the Lord and watch for the miracle. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Now, I want you to a lot's been said, but I want you to pause tonight and meditate on those things. And maybe the Lord maybe while I was preaching the Lord was showing your life. You had pictures coming to your mind. You had you had images of your childhood. You have images of your brokenness. Maybe some of you had tears while I'm talking because you still feel it inside. And my words tonight that are inspired by the Lord gave you hope. Lord, if you did it for for this man, you can do it for me. And we want to invite the Lord tonight to step in the scene to come in your pew to come to your chair. And while that we they sing this song, I want you to keep your eyes closed and let those words in that song and the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit speak to your heart. And I want you to invite Jesus to your chair to your heart tonight and say, "Lord, can you take Can you take that brokenness? Was there a purpose for this life? I never thought that it would make sense, but is it possible, Lord, that you were shaping me? Is it possible that you were molding me for a plan for the future? Is it possible that this pastor right now, is it possible that he's saying the truth? that there's hope for me that from that nothingness that brokenness actually you were doing something that maybe Lord even you're going to use that &gt;&gt; while this song is singing right now take that time with the Lord open your heart to the presence of the Lord let him mend your heart let him soften your heart in the name of Jesus the healer [singing] of my heart. The maker and the [singing] God of [music] all we are. &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, I was the broken [singing] [music] vessel [singing] in your hand.

You can stay here. last week, you know, Brother Steve, he mentioned that he didn't have a dad. And then the Lord showed him that no, he did. He had a mentor all these lives and he was listening to these sermons. Well, I had a good dad that loved me very much, but I have the same mentor that Steve had. And one of the things that he struggled with the most, and it's the same thing that the Lord Jesus struggled with, was that person that they won't admit that there's something that they need in their life. They think, "I have it. I I want to see other people come to the altar. I want to see other people give their heart to the Lord, but I'm okay. And that's the spirit that is hardest to deal with. I was this past week, we tore out all the concrete in the back and and u we're getting ready to pour new concrete and there's all these piles of rubble in the concrete mason. It's one of the finest Christians I think that I've ever met. as a [music] sweet family. And I I got here and he was standing there and he was looking at the the pieces of concrete there on the ground. And and I walked up to him and and he looked back at me and he says he says, "Hey, [music] pastor." He says, "Um, Hispanic," he's a Hispanic brother. And he said, he said, "You see all this these pieces on the ground?" He said, "That's me." And he said, "God has to tear me down. He has to break me up." And then he says, "And then he rebuilds me." And he says, "We're going to rebuild all of this, pastor, and it's going to look really good." He says, "But this all this concrete here," he says, "that's me." He says, "I thank God that he would tear me down like he's done." And I thank God that he can rebuild me up. And I said I said, "Brother, you're you're right. And and I feel like he does it to me every day. And if I would just let him [music] tear me down, if I would just let these pe pieces just be broken and fall down and and and say, "Now, Lord, now it's just a big pile. Now, Lord, would you just put it all back together and would you make it better than it was before?" That's a true Christian, friends. &gt;&gt; Sisters, can you sing it again? You are the [music and singing] healer, the healer of my [singing and music] heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; The maker [singing and music] and the God of all we are. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] I was the [singing] broken [music] vessel [singing] in your hand. [music] You looked beyond the hurt and [singing] made me whole again. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh dear God, we thank you. &gt;&gt; Healer of the broken. &gt;&gt; We thank you, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You touched my [singing] heart and made it new. &gt;&gt; Now my whole life I surrender. Lay it down before the men. [music and singing] Lord, I give my heart to you. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Love that saw before I knew you &gt;&gt; has brought me near. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; has brought me near to where you are. [music] &gt;&gt; Now I live [singing] to praise [music] you ever. May I praise you, healer of my [singing and music] heart. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Nothing [singing] compares Lord to [music] knowing you. Go and [music and singing] see what the grace of God can do. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You faithfully serve me [singing] and call me your own. [singing] Then made a [music] way to bring my [singing] wondering heart back home. Let's just sing it now. Just sing it, friends. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand, friends. Stand and let it rebuild you. &gt;&gt; You touched my heart [music and singing] and made it. &gt;&gt; Now my whole life I surrender. [singing] Lay down before the men. Lord, I give my heart to [singing and music] you. Love [singing] that's all before I knew [music] you brought me near brought [singing] me near to where you are. &gt;&gt; Now I live to praise you ever may I praise [singing] you. Healer of my [music] heart. [singing] &gt;&gt; Bow our heads, [music] friends. And the sweet spirit that's here. There's a time to be broken down and then there's a time to rebuild. Allow him, friends. Allow yourself to surrender to the Lord Jesus. Allow yourself to be seen as a broken person before him. saying, "Now, Lord, would you take these [music] pieces as maybe the the potter had broken them and he brought he brought them back together and this [music] concrete was broken up and then Lord, you poured a fresh new piece there. [music] Allow him, friends, to to change you. Let that heart that may have been once stony, let it be broken and be soft and tender now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Allow the Holy Spirit [music] to correct and to nurture and to teach us. Lord God, we thank you father for this testimony and how Lord you have been a father to so many of us and Lord many of us had earthly fathers and many of us didn't but there was always a father there that was looking after us and taking care of us and oh God we're thankful for for that father that was there from the time we were born until this time now. And Lord, we pray that you would build build us back up, Father. May we be [music] better person, a better Christian, a better believer as we leave this place, Lord, that we might that our lives wouldn't be wasted, Father, wasted on ourselves or on chasing something else, but our lives would be used by you to win souls to you and to build you up. Oh God, you said if you would be lifted up that you would draw all men to you. Lord, let us lift you up. Let us point to that cross and say, "My friend, you may be broken. You may be hurting, but I came to that cross and it built me back up and it can do the same to you, Lord. We thank you, Father. We pray that, Lord, that we could just find your will, Lord. That we could just walk in the light of the gospel all the time, Lord. And Father, each day, day by day, Lord, tear us down and rebuild us, Father. Let there be no Daniel Evans even anywhere near me. I pray that it would all be Jesus Christ. Oh dear God, that Christ would just flow from me and Lord that it would flow from each person in this audience and father that it would flow out into others and it would just spread and deeper and deeper until Father that the whole world would just Lord be at least ex introduced to it. Then I believe that you would come for Lord the book closes with the bride crying out in the spirit Lord come. Father we pray that while you were Terry that we could be a witness. Lord that you'd be with us all. May your will be done. And then Lord, as we go, this meal that's been provided, Lord, we pray that you would bless the hands that provided it. Those that work so hard so that we might enjoy fellowship and a meal tonight. Bless them, Father, many times over from the blessings that they've given us. We pray. [music] And Lord, we pray that the Holy Spirit would be with us as we fellowship and that the food would be sanctified in Jesus' name. And Father, for your glory, we pray. Amen.
