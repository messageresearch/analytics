[54:05] themselves Psalms chapter
[54:11] 78 I'd like to preach to you something
[54:13] here this morning I'd like to title free
[54:16] from
[54:17] Fear free from Fear listen here in
[54:20] Psalms chapter 78 and brothers if you
[54:22] have that on the screen you can display
[54:24] that just verse one we'll read all all
[54:26] the way down through give ear oh my
[54:29] people to my
[54:31] law incline your ears to the words of my
[54:35] mouth just keep going in the ver the
[54:37] verses here verse
[54:41] two I will open my mouth in a parable I
[54:45] will utter dark sayings of
[54:48] old which we have heard and known and
[54:51] our fathers have told us we will not
[54:54] hide them from their children showing to
[54:57] the generation to come the Praises of
[54:59] the Lord and his strength and his
[55:02] wonderful works that he hath done now
[55:04] watch how David begins to recount this
[55:07] and he starts off by saying give ear and
[55:10] he and he says here hear the words of my
[55:12] mouth I'm gon to I'm going to speak
[55:14] something here and it's going to have
[55:16] it's going to have an effect it's going
[55:17] to have power and he begins to rehearse
[55:20] and he says I'll utter things from old
[55:23] uh previous in the past and he says and
[55:26] we're not going to hide the past from
[55:29] our
[55:30] children we're not going to cover up
[55:32] what the Lord did we're not going to
[55:34] forget about it how many times does the
[55:36] Lord say forget not the works which the
[55:38] Lord has done for you and so now here's
[55:41] David and he begins to recount and he
[55:44] says for he established a testimony in
[55:47] Jacob appointed the law in Israel which
[55:49] he commanded our fathers that they
[55:51] should make them known this is a
[55:53] commandment this isn't a suggestion did
[55:55] you ever catch this here it's a
[55:58] Commandment that he commanded us that we
[56:01] should make them known to their
[56:04] children verse six keep going brother
[56:07] that the generation to
[56:09] come might know them even the children
[56:13] which should be born who should arise
[56:16] and declare them to their children verse
[56:20] seven we'll just keep going that they
[56:23] here's the purpose that they might set
[56:26] their hope in God and forget not the
[56:29] works of God but keep his Commandments I
[56:34] want you to move to verse 12 he did
[56:37] Miracles notice this marvelous things
[56:40] did he that marvelous is our English
[56:43] word miracle and so he says he did
[56:46] miraculous things marvelous things did
[56:49] he in the sight of their fathers in the
[56:50] land of Egypt in the field of zoan so
[56:53] David begins to recount this he divided
[56:56] vers verse 13 he divided the sea and
[56:59] caused them to pass through he made the
[57:01] waters stand up as a heap he guided them
[57:04] in the daytime also he led them with a
[57:07] cloud and all the night with a light of
[57:10] fire he notice this he clav that means
[57:13] he split he broke open the rocks in the
[57:17] wilderness and gave them drink as out of
[57:20] the great depths verse 16 he brought
[57:23] streams also out of the Rock and called
[57:26] caused Waters to run down like rivers
[57:31] and so David begins to recount and he
[57:33] says here's What the Lord Has Done don't
[57:36] forget about it make sure you keep it in
[57:39] remembrance and make sure you're
[57:40] teaching it to the next Generation now
[57:43] these were what we would call Sunday
[57:46] school lessons what we've learned from
[57:47] children story of the children of Israel
[57:50] C in the Red Sea but notice to David
[57:53] these weren't 2,000 year historically
[57:56] events but this was things that God had
[57:59] done in David's
[58:02] generation so it's one thing for us to
[58:04] teach our children what God did uh years
[58:07] ago 2,000 years ago but what about what
[58:10] God's doing right now amen praise the
[58:13] Lord I'd like to just to pray if you
[58:15] have a need something upon your heart
[58:17] you just want to make it known by an
[58:19] uplifted hand and we'll just go to the
[58:20] Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we know
[58:23] Lord that you are in control father
[58:26] you're Supreme Lord you're you're
[58:29] Sovereign that means Lord that at your
[58:32] discretion you choose you're not you're
[58:35] not influenced by any external thing
[58:38] your your choices that you make the
[58:40] decisions that you've made are Eternal
[58:43] Lord your purposes David said are
[58:45] established from eternity and so God we
[58:48] know that that's our confidence this
[58:50] morning Lord that you've seen this
[58:53] Sunday morning you've seen this day
[58:56] and David said this is the day that the
[58:59] Lord has made I'll rejoice and be glad
[59:01] in it today father is the day of
[59:04] salvation let us help us to forget
[59:07] yesterday help us to put aside for a
[59:10] moment tomorrow and let us focus in on
[59:13] your word we believe that it teaches it
[59:16] exhorts it transforms it encourages it
[59:19] challenges so we raise our hands with
[59:22] the needs Lord with every person that's
[59:24] have a hand that has a hand raised ident
[59:26] ified by a need would you come this
[59:28] morning would you meet it Lord move me
[59:30] as my prayer out of the way Lord and may
[59:33] your word be preeminent we ask Grant it
[59:36] Lord to each and every single person
[59:37] here this morning in Jesus Christ's name
[59:40] amen you can be seated this
[59:44] morning Jesus made a prediction and it
[59:48] was prophetic that the last days that
[59:51] we're living in would be a time of
[59:54] unprecedented fear that's a word that
[59:57] you hear a lot if you watch the news or
[59:59] listen to the news uh of any kind no
[1:00:02] matter what outlet that you listen to
[1:00:05] you you'll hear this word unprecedented
[1:00:09] how many's heard that lately and so we
[1:00:12] know that it it's an unprecedented World
[1:00:15] things are happening at an unprecedented
[1:00:18] in other words there's no precedent for
[1:00:19] it there's many things that are that are
[1:00:23] taking place today there is no history
[1:00:26] historical record for us to go back and
[1:00:28] identify and say it's just a cycle
[1:00:31] repeating and this is very important
[1:00:33] because for years history has just
[1:00:35] repeated itself uh the prophet of God in
[1:00:38] the Ephesian Church age mentions that
[1:00:40] and says history just keeps repeating
[1:00:42] itself in one generation we have Israel
[1:00:45] and he said there's just a cycle and he
[1:00:47] says but but there there there there's
[1:00:50] going to come a junction and brother Bon
[1:00:53] preaches a message called the junction
[1:00:54] of time
[1:00:56] back and listen to that message the
[1:00:58] prophet is making the point that there
[1:01:01] that there was there was important spots
[1:01:04] there was specific important times and
[1:01:08] Seasons that were Junctions they meant
[1:01:12] something they weren't just like last
[1:01:14] year they weren't like the year before
[1:01:17] but there there was something unique and
[1:01:19] and and brother B says and every time he
[1:01:22] says God reveals himself at a junction
[1:01:24] of History you're familiar with with
[1:01:26] that and and so Jesus refers to this
[1:01:29] Junction in Luke 21 and I I want you to
[1:01:32] put it on the screen if you could
[1:01:33] brother Jeremy in verse 25 he's going to
[1:01:36] re he's going to point to a junction
[1:01:38] that's coming upon the world and he says
[1:01:42] he says it would be a time of
[1:01:44] unprecedented fear here's his words here
[1:01:46] and he says and there shall be signs in
[1:01:49] the Sun and in the moon and in the stars
[1:01:51] and upon the Earth distress that's a key
[1:01:56] word there
[1:01:58] distress uh among the Nations notice
[1:02:01] this uh there there will be distress of
[1:02:03] nations with
[1:02:08] perplexity these these words here to me
[1:02:10] are in bright neon green when I read
[1:02:13] them or red or whatever color you want
[1:02:15] to use they're bright lit up
[1:02:18] flashing because it w it's it's it's so
[1:02:22] identifiable of 2020
[1:02:26] and even more than that we have a we can
[1:02:28] have a tendency just to lock into oh
[1:02:30] 2020 has been so bad and oh man they've
[1:02:32] made so many you know different kind of
[1:02:35] memes about 2020 and how bad it is and
[1:02:38] but you know really friends uh the world
[1:02:40] may have just woke it up to how terrible
[1:02:44] the the the the condition of the of
[1:02:46] mankind is in but we've known that since
[1:02:48] a prophet declared it to us 30 years ago
[1:02:52] that there's perplexity and and in this
[1:02:55] age you see more than ever before you
[1:02:57] don't have to look very far into the
[1:03:00] eyes of a person to see the distress to
[1:03:04] see the Calamity to see as Jesus called
[1:03:06] it the perplexity he says this he says
[1:03:10] the sea uh the waves and the waves
[1:03:13] roaring verse
[1:03:15] 26 uh the seves and the Rays were in
[1:03:17] men's Hearts now notice this was this
[1:03:20] was uh this was a junction this was a
[1:03:23] time specific that men's
[1:03:26] Hearts would fail for
[1:03:29] fear failing them literally heart heart
[1:03:34] failure that their hearts there would
[1:03:37] come a time that was so dark perplexity
[1:03:41] distress and he says men's Hearts would
[1:03:44] fail for
[1:03:46] fear and for looking after those things
[1:03:48] which are coming on the earth for the
[1:03:50] powers of Heaven shall be shaken we know
[1:03:54] the scripture very well in Matthew
[1:03:56] 24 and he says Nation shall rise against
[1:03:59] nation and Kingdom against Kingdom there
[1:04:03] shall be famines and
[1:04:06] pestilences and
[1:04:08] earthquakes and then he
[1:04:10] says all these are the beginning of
[1:04:16] Sorrows lately I I've looked at this
[1:04:18] scripture and I I just begin to look at
[1:04:21] this and with all of the Calamity that
[1:04:23] that we're facing in the world today and
[1:04:25] all of the
[1:04:26] uncertainty he says this is just the
[1:04:29] beginning of Sorrows almost what we
[1:04:32] would call the
[1:04:34] contractions you sisters know that real
[1:04:37] well or familiar with that us men can
[1:04:38] only say it and sound like we know what
[1:04:40] we're talking
[1:04:42] about but
[1:04:44] contractions uh I remember contractions
[1:04:47] I remember my wife having contractions
[1:04:49] and the birth
[1:04:50] pains and and he says it's just the
[1:04:53] beginning this is just the contractions
[1:04:55] com on this is just the just as the
[1:04:58] prophet preached the message birth
[1:05:00] pains waiting to be born we know we've
[1:05:03] preached here before on the groanings
[1:05:05] within that all nature groans within
[1:05:09] itself uh he says and many false
[1:05:12] prophets shall arise and deceive many
[1:05:14] iniquity shall abound and because of
[1:05:17] abounding iniquity the love of many
[1:05:19] shall grow cold and he goes on to say
[1:05:22] and there shall be Great Tribulation and
[1:05:25] and that not that since was not from the
[1:05:27] beginning of the world nor ever will be
[1:05:31] not of this world or the world to come
[1:05:33] and he says for thou sh there shall
[1:05:35] arise false Christ and false prophet
[1:05:37] showing great signs and wonders and then
[1:05:39] he gives this last warning in Matthew 24
[1:05:42] watch therefore for you know not what
[1:05:46] hour the Lord doth
[1:05:49] come so the the the world is ring in
[1:05:54] fear we we know that this is there's a
[1:05:57] there's a uh uh if anything there's a
[1:06:00] fear pandemic Co pandemic but there's a
[1:06:03] fear pandemic upon the world and there
[1:06:07] the entire world is is affected this
[1:06:10] isn't just North America but it's the
[1:06:12] entire world affected by economic
[1:06:16] systems and and uh and and and health
[1:06:19] systems and government structures
[1:06:22] there's such uncertainty and and and you
[1:06:25] know we're we're very familiar with that
[1:06:27] even even the long before covid there
[1:06:32] was such an unpredictability I'm just
[1:06:34] preaching here common things things that
[1:06:36] we all know but there was such an such
[1:06:40] things that were just so unpredictable
[1:06:42] even even the weather uh across the
[1:06:44] world if you if you follow and as and I
[1:06:47] I do it maybe it's just a how the Lord
[1:06:49] made me but I follow not just this the
[1:06:52] the national stage but the world stage
[1:06:54] and you try to put that as a
[1:06:56] conglomerate to watch you know what what
[1:06:59] what what stage is the entire world at
[1:07:01] because you you'll be able to the
[1:07:03] prophet of God said that he said look at
[1:07:05] he preached a message called modern
[1:07:06] events made clear by prophecy and so
[1:07:09] there's there's events that are
[1:07:10] happening now that have been made clear
[1:07:12] there's not an uncertainty within the
[1:07:14] family of
[1:07:16] God but the weather even has became uh a
[1:07:21] just a an innumerable number of
[1:07:24] calamities and hurricanes even just this
[1:07:27] year
[1:07:28] Louisiana uh just coming up through the
[1:07:30] gulf coming right past Marty martyr City
[1:07:34] just hurricane after Hurricane after
[1:07:37] Hurricane and you say well what's
[1:07:39] happening go back to prophecy go back to
[1:07:41] the message the prophet of God preaches
[1:07:43] the oncoming storm and his inspiration
[1:07:47] for that message is a hurricane that's
[1:07:49] coming up through the gulf and going to
[1:07:50] strike Florida and brother mam says what
[1:07:52] is it it's birth pains it's judgment
[1:07:56] it's it's it's evidence that man has
[1:07:59] spurned
[1:08:01] Mercy he's forsaken as the scripture
[1:08:04] says I in the I think it's in Isaiah
[1:08:07] says you've forsaken your own
[1:08:11] mercy and so even the uncertainty and
[1:08:13] the Calamity that we see in in just
[1:08:16] earthquakes you could you could just I
[1:08:19] could show you charts and graphs and I'm
[1:08:20] sure some of you who follow that could
[1:08:22] you could just go to the uh the the the
[1:08:25] you know there's websites you can go to
[1:08:27] just to watch in real time earthquakes
[1:08:29] that are taking place and I I can say
[1:08:31] this one word it's
[1:08:34] unprecedented and it's really in the
[1:08:36] last few years it's almost there's
[1:08:39] almost been an
[1:08:41] acceleration there's almost been an
[1:08:43] accelerated Pace towards
[1:08:47] disaster and it's times you can't hardly
[1:08:50] keep up with it we've watched the world
[1:08:53] and just just just the last few months
[1:08:56] since February March of this year we
[1:08:59] watched the entire world turn upside
[1:09:01] down right before our very eyes and our
[1:09:04] lives become disjointed in ways that we
[1:09:07] would have never thought
[1:09:10] possible the whole world has been turned
[1:09:12] upside down uh and and it's as I said
[1:09:16] it's not just National it's this is
[1:09:18] global and and and even you look beyond
[1:09:21] that you could look at the just the
[1:09:23] metric of crimes you could look at the
[1:09:25] Met
[1:09:26] I could show you charts and graphs of
[1:09:28] the rate of divorce the rate of
[1:09:31] suicide and it would all come back to
[1:09:33] this one word
[1:09:35] unprecedented that it's unprecedented
[1:09:38] it's a time where it seems impossible to
[1:09:42] curb crime crime in in in in this
[1:09:46] metropolitan cities crime in the rural
[1:09:48] areas crime in the schools your children
[1:09:51] are going to imagine an unsafe Place
[1:09:56] being an elementary school that you
[1:09:58] would send your children to and it's
[1:10:01] it's just society that has just gone
[1:10:05] completely insane and out of their minds
[1:10:08] and more than ever before this is the
[1:10:10] the time Jesus referred to that said
[1:10:13] men's Hearts would fail
[1:10:16] them because of fear now fear is such an
[1:10:19] amazing thing uh and and we're just
[1:10:22] going to take just a moment here to look
[1:10:23] at it but to the fear is such an amazing
[1:10:27] thing that it's actually a fear is
[1:10:30] actually as much a real energy as faith
[1:10:35] is a real
[1:10:37] energy we could say this that if Faith
[1:10:41] activates the promises of God's word in
[1:10:43] my life then fear activates the devil's
[1:10:47] schemes and attacks and plans in my life
[1:10:51] if faith is a conduit for all the
[1:10:54] benefits and blessings of God because we
[1:10:56] know that it is uh whoever Jesus said if
[1:11:00] uh you must first believe that he is and
[1:11:03] that he's a rewarder of them that
[1:11:04] diligently seek Him for without faith
[1:11:06] it's impossible to please God for by
[1:11:09] faith the elders obtained a good report
[1:11:11] for by faith Enoch for by faith uh you
[1:11:14] know the the the the the scripture there
[1:11:16] in Hebrews and so while Faith activates
[1:11:20] the promises of God faith is a
[1:11:23] conduit faith is the
[1:11:27] channel by which God can move through in
[1:11:29] your life if you'll just have
[1:11:32] faith but just as Faith activates God
[1:11:36] fear activates
[1:11:39] Satan are you here this morning we could
[1:11:42] say fear is the conduit by which now I'm
[1:11:45] not talking about Godly fear we've
[1:11:47] preached on that here before there's
[1:11:48] good things to fear we teach our
[1:11:50] children to fear fire and that's a good
[1:11:52] fear it's a healthy fear I teach my
[1:11:55] children children a a fear of firearms
[1:11:57] and it's not a fear of Terror but it's a
[1:11:59] fear of
[1:12:00] respect that you understand the
[1:12:02] capability of something so we're not
[1:12:04] talking about Good fears it's good Godly
[1:12:07] fear and the fear of God is the
[1:12:09] beginning of wisdom and so but it's I'm
[1:12:12] not talking about that kind of fear but
[1:12:13] I'm talking about phobia I'm talking
[1:12:16] about
[1:12:17] Terror and fear is something that all of
[1:12:20] us every single person here today no
[1:12:23] matter how young how old every single
[1:12:26] person deals
[1:12:28] with whether it's the fear of some
[1:12:30] phobia that you have or the fear of
[1:12:32] losing everything or the fear of your
[1:12:34] losing your salvation the fear of going
[1:12:36] to hell the fear of
[1:12:38] dying all of us have a some type of fear
[1:12:42] that that we have but the Bible says
[1:12:44] that he's he who's he the Lord has not
[1:12:48] given us the believer the family of God
[1:12:52] the spirit of fear so we know that
[1:12:55] there's fears but then there's a spirit
[1:12:57] of fear that's upon the nation that's
[1:12:59] upon the world that's upon the the world
[1:13:02] system and and and and but the Bible
[1:13:04] says he's not given us in other words
[1:13:06] he's not put that upon us and if we've
[1:13:09] got it it's came from the devil not from
[1:13:11] our father
[1:13:13] above and fear is he's not given us the
[1:13:16] spirit of fear but of
[1:13:20] power and of a sound
[1:13:23] mind sound meaning it has Integrity
[1:13:27] meaning that that it can stand the test
[1:13:29] meaning that it has strength and so
[1:13:32] you're born we know naturally with the
[1:13:34] fear uh it's part even of the sin nature
[1:13:37] it's amazing when you go back and you
[1:13:39] look in the The Book of Genesis and
[1:13:42] you'll find out that the Bible doesn't
[1:13:44] say that God breathed into at his
[1:13:46] nostrils he became a living soul and
[1:13:47] then he was
[1:13:49] afraid no but you actually don't find
[1:13:51] the word afraid until after sin enters
[1:13:54] in in the fall
[1:13:56] and actually it's the first response by
[1:13:59] Adam I was
[1:14:03] afraid and so I hid myself what do we do
[1:14:07] in fear we run even Adam's uh
[1:14:10] exemplifying it for us as an example I
[1:14:13] was afraid I was scared there was a fear
[1:14:17] that here comes God who before God came
[1:14:20] down and fellowshipped with him in the
[1:14:21] cool of the evening and there was no
[1:14:22] fear there was no worry there was was
[1:14:24] only joy and Bliss and now that same
[1:14:27] presence that same God comes down and
[1:14:30] Adam's
[1:14:32] afraid and so we know it's part of the
[1:14:34] sin nature I was afraid so I hid myself
[1:14:40] and we know that this world that we live
[1:14:42] in is an age Beyond any other time that
[1:14:45] this is fearful times Jesus called it
[1:14:48] perplexing and and and the entire world
[1:14:50] knows that they
[1:14:52] know no new administration's going to
[1:14:54] fix anything no no existing
[1:14:56] administration's going to fix anything
[1:14:59] because at the end of the day men have
[1:15:01] failed us governments have failed us
[1:15:05] plans have failed us what what has it
[1:15:07] gotten us there's no it almost seems
[1:15:09] that no one has a
[1:15:13] solution you just look at how
[1:15:17] rapidly uh entertainment has declined
[1:15:20] and we and and I'm just speaking of
[1:15:22] worldly entertainment here you can look
[1:15:24] at how fast movies and Hollywood who
[1:15:27] brother brandom says there was Satan's
[1:15:30] uh
[1:15:30] headquarters and you look at how much of
[1:15:33] a rapid decline what you would think was
[1:15:36] so oh my you know 20 years ago what they
[1:15:39] were throwing in films was so just
[1:15:42] mindblowing and just so horrific and so
[1:15:44] corrupt but now look today it's it's it
[1:15:48] would be it would be I have a g rating
[1:15:50] compared to what they've rated the the
[1:15:52] entertainment industry today
[1:15:57] you say why is that important because it
[1:15:58] shows you the rapid
[1:16:00] acceleration brother bandam says in his
[1:16:03] visions and he has he has uh we there's
[1:16:06] actually a tape you could go back and
[1:16:08] and and read about the seven visions
[1:16:10] that the prophet of God has and and and
[1:16:12] in those Visions are are leading up to a
[1:16:16] climax to very end they're in
[1:16:17] chronological order and then it comes to
[1:16:21] uh one of the last visions
[1:16:25] he sees the the the the the
[1:16:28] morality had so
[1:16:30] eroded amongst
[1:16:33] people and he speaks of of women he says
[1:16:36] that would almost be completely it would
[1:16:38] be a whol sale he calls it
[1:16:40] stripes and he said to where they would
[1:16:42] almost be completely
[1:16:44] nuded and he said to where there was
[1:16:46] just nothing covering them he says I've
[1:16:48] seen the morality he says of women just
[1:16:50] declin at such a rate and he says now
[1:16:53] what was it it wasn't just a prophet
[1:16:54] pointing at sin but he was pointing it
[1:16:58] as metrics he was pointing it as
[1:17:00] Junctions to say when you see
[1:17:03] this when you with your eyes witness
[1:17:06] this you know where you're
[1:17:08] at he comes to that and he says it was
[1:17:11] moral
[1:17:12] Decline and boy have we ever seen that
[1:17:16] today and beyond that he says then the
[1:17:18] next Vision I had he said was of a he
[1:17:20] said a a
[1:17:22] president and he says he says seen a
[1:17:25] woman I've seen her that's his exact
[1:17:27] words I've seen her and he says and he
[1:17:31] says she was a cruel hearted going
[1:17:33] another place outside of the church
[1:17:34] hbook he said she was a a cruel-hearted
[1:17:37] woman beautiful he says but
[1:17:40] cruel-hearted and he says I've seen her
[1:17:42] rise to great power and he said in the
[1:17:46] United States of America he says that he
[1:17:48] says and he says and it would be a woman
[1:17:51] he says she'll either be president or
[1:17:54] vice president
[1:17:57] and he says though I knew this could be
[1:17:59] the rise of the Roman Catholic church
[1:18:01] now I'm just I'm not preaching a
[1:18:02] Doctrine here so don't nobody go out and
[1:18:04] say brother Matt believes Camala Harris
[1:18:07] is the you know the now now does brother
[1:18:10] Matt I don't know that it could
[1:18:12] be I can tell you this that for years
[1:18:15] we've looked at what brother Bram said
[1:18:16] about that and thought uh it's the Roman
[1:18:19] Catholic church because we can see that
[1:18:20] she brother Adam said she would control
[1:18:22] everything and that's happened already I
[1:18:25] controls
[1:18:26] everything
[1:18:28] amen and he says but it could be it
[1:18:31] could be I knew it could be he says but
[1:18:33] I seen her and he says a woman VI
[1:18:36] president or vice president you think
[1:18:38] that was an accident that that little
[1:18:40] Andor was put in there no it was the
[1:18:43] spirit of God speaking through a
[1:18:47] prophet and he said she be president or
[1:18:49] vice president now friends if we've ever
[1:18:52] if we we ever going to fulfill that
[1:18:55] that that Vision that brother bandam has
[1:18:56] it's going to happen here in January
[1:18:59] what is it January 21st
[1:19:01] or 20th the inauguration day and he says
[1:19:06] then what happens after that he says the
[1:19:09] next Vision was America he said just in
[1:19:12] smoldering smoking
[1:19:16] ruins and he said in some atomic bomb or
[1:19:19] some nuclear bomb had had had went off
[1:19:22] and so we know that this is prophesy
[1:19:25] it's what Jesus prophesied as we read in
[1:19:27] Luke and in Matthew that it would be
[1:19:29] perplexing times it would be a a time
[1:19:31] you say brother Matt what does that
[1:19:33] produce it produces fear that that age
[1:19:36] that we're living in produces a fear
[1:19:38] that grips people and even Believers can
[1:19:42] be susceptible to that
[1:19:46] Spirit are you here
[1:19:48] today if you never get covid and you
[1:19:51] never uh you maybe you maybe you go
[1:19:53] through this entire pandemic and you're
[1:19:55] never diagnosed a positive diagnosed
[1:19:57] with Co and the praise the Lord for that
[1:20:00] but be careful that while bypassing the
[1:20:02] virus you ingest the fear that surrounds
[1:20:05] the
[1:20:06] virus because sometimes that can be more
[1:20:08] damaging than the virus
[1:20:13] itself the Bible says this in
[1:20:15] Ecclesiastes 1:18 you don't have to to
[1:20:18] turn I'm just going to read it he says
[1:20:20] and this is Solomon here in much wisdom
[1:20:24] is much
[1:20:25] grief and he that increaseth
[1:20:28] knowledge
[1:20:30] increaseth
[1:20:32] sorrow boy isn't that
[1:20:34] true the older you get the more
[1:20:37] knowledge you get the more susceptible
[1:20:39] to sorrow you
[1:20:41] are it's a it's an age of complete fear
[1:20:46] you know and and and and Fear Can can
[1:20:49] become such a common thing for all of us
[1:20:51] here today and and even for us and and I
[1:20:54] know I've read this here before I'm just
[1:20:56] going to read it here just again as the
[1:20:57] Lord just leads me through this you can
[1:21:00] you you there's there's so many
[1:21:02] definitions of common fears or what we
[1:21:04] would call phobias I'm going to read it
[1:21:06] to you from uh good old brother
[1:21:09] Wikipedia let me let him talk here for a
[1:21:12] minute fear is a distressing notice this
[1:21:15] I didn't have time to put it up fear is
[1:21:17] a distressing negative sensation induced
[1:21:22] by a perceived threat now I want to read
[1:21:23] you something here before before I go
[1:21:25] there let me read you something from the
[1:21:26] prophet in God's way that's been made
[1:21:29] for us and I wish I had time to put this
[1:21:31] up and it just didn't so just just
[1:21:34] listen imagine it's on the screen okay
[1:21:37] he says brother mam says after through
[1:21:39] the services of this week trying to show
[1:21:42] people that there's no need to be
[1:21:44] scared the worst thing Satan the devil
[1:21:49] can put upon you the worst thing the
[1:21:52] worst thing
[1:21:55] cancer uh uh tuberculosis the worst
[1:21:58] thing devil could put upon me no listen
[1:22:00] to what brother random says the worst
[1:22:02] thing the devil can put upon you is
[1:22:05] fear notice how he says that the worst
[1:22:08] thing he can put upon you so what what
[1:22:12] what happens when a person Satan puts
[1:22:14] fear upon somebody fear upon some
[1:22:17] situation and he says is the worst thing
[1:22:19] the devil could put upon you if you even
[1:22:21] had a Cancer and didn't fear here and
[1:22:25] believe God would heal you you wouldn't
[1:22:27] be in a bad too bad of a
[1:22:29] shape God take care of could take care
[1:22:32] of that if you were sick whatever it is
[1:22:35] if you didn't
[1:22:38] fear if you didn't fear he says so fear
[1:22:44] is one of the worst things Satan can
[1:22:47] place upon the
[1:22:52] person now this week he says I tried and
[1:22:55] to prove it by the scripture that the
[1:22:57] man that's born again of the kingdom of
[1:22:59] God has nothing to
[1:23:02] fear you love that has nothing to fear
[1:23:07] so I want you to listen to some of these
[1:23:09] common fears as we know them as phobias
[1:23:12] so but here's the definition of fear
[1:23:14] fear inside of us is a distressing
[1:23:16] negative sensation induced by a
[1:23:19] perceived threat it is a basic survival
[1:23:22] mechanism occurring in response to a
[1:23:25] specific stimulus such as pain or the
[1:23:29] threat of danger in short fear is the
[1:23:33] ability to recognize danger leading to
[1:23:37] an urge to confront
[1:23:40] it or flee from
[1:23:44] it two big differences there and how we
[1:23:48] manage fear you either confront it or
[1:23:52] you flee from it
[1:23:55] some of us I confront it I don't ever
[1:23:58] run it leads to an urge to either
[1:24:01] confront it or to flee from it it's also
[1:24:04] known as the fight or
[1:24:06] flight response the fight or flight
[1:24:10] response but in extreme cases of fear
[1:24:14] Terror which is an extreme case of fear
[1:24:17] uh but in extreme cases of fear a freeze
[1:24:20] or paralysis response
[1:24:25] is
[1:24:26] possible so some fight it some face it
[1:24:31] some most if not all run from
[1:24:35] it and then some
[1:24:39] freeze and some lock up some go into
[1:24:43] paralysis some just never go
[1:24:48] forward one of the worst things Satan
[1:24:50] can do to you is to get you in this
[1:24:55] spot to where you're not going forward
[1:24:58] you're not going backwards you're just
[1:25:01] Frozen are you
[1:25:04] here it's a paralysis
[1:25:07] response uh and he goes on to he goes on
[1:25:09] to talk about uh uh different
[1:25:12] psychiatrists that have looked at this
[1:25:13] suggesting that fear belongs to a small
[1:25:15] or basic uh innate emotions set also
[1:25:19] includes the emotion of joy and sadness
[1:25:20] and anger fear should be dis
[1:25:22] distinguished from the related emotional
[1:25:24] state of anxiety which typically curs
[1:25:26] with any certain or immediate external
[1:25:27] threat additionally fear is frequently
[1:25:30] related to the specific behaviors of
[1:25:32] escape and
[1:25:34] avoidance and and so it's so so amazing
[1:25:38] I I I don't I did this for young people
[1:25:40] for for the for the Youth one time back
[1:25:42] home and I displayed a little video uh
[1:25:45] and it was it was such a it was
[1:25:47] hilarious if I could show it to you
[1:25:49] you'd get a good a good laugh out of it
[1:25:51] but it was it was a perfect
[1:25:53] demonstration
[1:25:55] of the fight or flight response and
[1:25:58] maybe I've told this here before but
[1:26:00] it's a video a real video of a man who
[1:26:02] was going to play a PR prank on people
[1:26:04] and so he gets inside of a a garbage can
[1:26:07] that's empty and as people come to take
[1:26:10] their trash uh and open the can as soon
[1:26:13] as they open it he's got a mask on and
[1:26:15] he just jumps
[1:26:16] out and the funniest thing is not the
[1:26:20] women who is you know terrified and
[1:26:22] jumping in fear and screaming the
[1:26:23] funniest part is the big Burly
[1:26:26] men that that literally are just
[1:26:29] immediately so scared you can just and
[1:26:32] they they they slow framed they they
[1:26:34] stopped the camera and they zoomed
[1:26:37] in oh boy I wish I had it to show you
[1:26:40] her this morning they zoomed in on some
[1:26:41] of these men's face who was very you
[1:26:44] know just very uh uh uh just refrained
[1:26:48] you know you could tell in the face is
[1:26:49] very subdued just walking into the trash
[1:26:51] can and this face that's just totally
[1:26:54] Cal immediately just in slow
[1:26:58] motion and you can almost see it goes
[1:27:01] back to a child when a child gets scared
[1:27:03] and they begin to cry and this full
[1:27:05] grown man looks like he's about to break
[1:27:06] down like a little
[1:27:08] baby and it's showing the the the flight
[1:27:11] and immediately they're they're you know
[1:27:13] they're 10 meter 10 feet behind the you
[1:27:15] know running the other
[1:27:17] direction but it's the it's it's the
[1:27:20] fight or flight uh response but one guy
[1:27:23] was very
[1:27:25] different and he goes to open that trash
[1:27:28] can and man as soon as that guy opens up
[1:27:30] it's immediate just
[1:27:33] boom and he just clocks this guy and
[1:27:36] this guy goes falling backwards and
[1:27:38] immediately gets into a boxer's pose
[1:27:40] ready to fight what was it it was
[1:27:43] immediately you're either going to fight
[1:27:45] or you're going to run oh when the Devil
[1:27:48] comes knocking and comes attacking our
[1:27:50] lives do we realize when he attacks our
[1:27:52] family our children our marriage and he
[1:27:55] attacks our marriage he attacks our home
[1:27:57] he attacks our health we're going to
[1:27:59] respond in one of two ways we're either
[1:28:02] going to take the word of God and stand
[1:28:04] up to the devil that's plaguing
[1:28:07] us or we're going to back down in in
[1:28:09] fear some of the most common fears that
[1:28:13] that that are they they did a survey and
[1:28:15] you can go and if you study any kind of
[1:28:18] uh an Google analytics you you can you
[1:28:21] can narrow down Search terms based upon
[1:28:24] what people are searching for and so
[1:28:27] they they took the analytics from data
[1:28:30] from Google search the when someone
[1:28:32] would type the fear of and they did it
[1:28:34] to aggregate all the uh information that
[1:28:38] that would that that they could call it
[1:28:40] what are the most common there were some
[1:28:42] outliers but the most common
[1:28:45] fears amongst people is the fear of
[1:28:51] ghosts the existence of evil
[1:28:55] Powers
[1:28:58] cockroaches
[1:29:01] spiders snakes I heard a sister say Amen
[1:29:04] some of you Brothers if you were honest
[1:29:06] you'd say Amen
[1:29:07] too Heights some people are afraid of
[1:29:10] heights some people so afraid of water
[1:29:13] this is a common fear some have enclosed
[1:29:15] spaces like
[1:29:17] claustrophobia the fear of tunnels the
[1:29:19] fear of bridges the fear of needles the
[1:29:22] fear of social rejection the fear of
[1:29:24] failure the fear of examinations or
[1:29:27] tests the fear but but out of all of
[1:29:30] them out of every fear the fear of
[1:29:33] flying the fear of death the fear of
[1:29:35] rejection the fear of people the fear of
[1:29:37] snakes the fear of failure the fear of
[1:29:40] driving it's amazing when you tally all
[1:29:42] this up and look at how fearful some
[1:29:45] people
[1:29:46] are but out of all of them the most
[1:29:49] common fear search the most common fear
[1:29:52] amongst people it's amazing is the fear
[1:29:55] of public
[1:30:00] speaking the fear of public
[1:30:03] speaking and it no one wants to be hurt
[1:30:06] isn't it amazing that Satan would put
[1:30:08] more emphasis on keeping a person
[1:30:11] silence than he would anything the fear
[1:30:14] of speaking in public the Bible says let
[1:30:16] the redeemed of the
[1:30:18] Lord say it again let the redeemed of
[1:30:20] the Lord say so if you're redeemed say
[1:30:23] so
[1:30:25] say so because there's importance in
[1:30:27] your words that's why brother Ram said
[1:30:29] you speak against the enemy you speak
[1:30:31] against the devil you use the words that
[1:30:34] God puts in your mouth and say I rebuke
[1:30:36] you Satan off of my children I rebuke
[1:30:38] you off of my body I rebuke you out of
[1:30:41] my mind and brother ROM says he's the
[1:30:43] high priest after your
[1:30:47] confession right not what you think not
[1:30:51] what you what what your sister Hattie WR
[1:30:53] what done any good if she brother random
[1:30:55] says anything you say uh the pro prophet
[1:30:57] of God says anything you say sister had
[1:30:59] wouldn't have done any good had she
[1:31:01] thought it but with her
[1:31:05] mouth are you with
[1:31:07] me the fear of public speaking to speak
[1:31:12] in public it it's it's it's so amazing
[1:31:15] because you look at this and and I'm
[1:31:17] just going to be real real practical
[1:31:19] here just the way the Lord led me uh
[1:31:21] here this
[1:31:22] morning but it's a amazing because most
[1:31:26] or I should say so many people are bound
[1:31:29] and they're actually we're not talking
[1:31:31] about sinful things here we're talking
[1:31:32] about gifts God puts in people's lives
[1:31:35] some people are so bound uh by fear that
[1:31:39] they're actually kept from what God has
[1:31:41] for them in their natural life because
[1:31:45] they're afraid of making a mistake
[1:31:46] because they're afraid of looking
[1:31:48] foolish they're afraid of fear that the
[1:31:50] the they're they're afraid of failure
[1:31:52] and the fear of rejection the fear of
[1:31:54] looking foolish do you know how many
[1:31:56] people will never achieve anything for
[1:31:59] the kingdom of God because they're
[1:32:00] afraid they'll look foolish in
[1:32:03] trying a powerful profound statement by
[1:32:06] a man I read it in his entire book it
[1:32:08] was just amazing and he makes a
[1:32:10] statement he says he says it's the the
[1:32:13] the the the places in the earth he says
[1:32:15] it's not the oil fields these say
[1:32:18] underneath the Earth where the oil is he
[1:32:20] says you would think that the greatest
[1:32:21] treasure in the earth is in an oil field
[1:32:23] he said it's not you think that the
[1:32:25] greatest what is the where is the
[1:32:26] greatest treasure in the earth buried if
[1:32:28] you were to go find the greatest
[1:32:30] treasure that God has given in the earth
[1:32:32] he said you won't find it in the oil
[1:32:33] field buried waiting to be tapped into
[1:32:35] you won't find it in Africa and a D in a
[1:32:37] mine somewhere waiting to be discovered
[1:32:39] it he says you won't you won't find it
[1:32:41] there he says but the greatest treasures
[1:32:43] that are buried in the earth you'll find
[1:32:45] at your local
[1:32:50] Cemetery I thought about that I thought
[1:32:54] my goodness the greatest
[1:32:58] treasures the greatest chances the
[1:33:00] greatest gifts the greatest talents gift
[1:33:03] of ministry gift of singing gift of
[1:33:05] helps the Bible speaks about all of
[1:33:08] these gifts gifts of wisdom Gifts of
[1:33:11] prayer and God has gifted the body of
[1:33:13] Christ God has gifted this
[1:33:16] body but the greatest treasures in the
[1:33:19] earth it holds back all of the treasures
[1:33:22] it would be buried in a grave because in
[1:33:24] a graveyard is the stories of of of of
[1:33:27] the gifts that God has put in someone's
[1:33:30] life that were never
[1:33:33] expressed the Bible speaks of this and
[1:33:35] it says that men's in this last day
[1:33:38] men's Hearts would fail them for fear
[1:33:41] such a paralysis such a such just such a
[1:33:44] shaking a fear you know I've I've
[1:33:46] experienced I've seen that fear first
[1:33:49] firsthand uh one time I was flying back
[1:33:51] from Edmonton and uh I was was coming
[1:33:54] back from preaching meetings and was
[1:33:56] there for for many days in the flight
[1:33:58] that morning had left it I think it was
[1:34:00] a Redeye flight 4:00 in the morning or
[1:34:02] something really really late and I was
[1:34:04] so tired and you know some people are so
[1:34:06] afraid of
[1:34:08] flying some people are just so fearful
[1:34:12] uh I mean I'm I'm serious some people
[1:34:14] just go their entire life and they've
[1:34:16] never flown in an
[1:34:18] airplane cuz they're afraid of flying I
[1:34:20] thank God I don't have that
[1:34:22] fear but but they're so afraid of of of
[1:34:25] flying said brother M can you get of
[1:34:27] course we can all become fearful but I'm
[1:34:29] talking about someone who's who's so
[1:34:32] paralyzed brother there's a brother back
[1:34:34] east and he says I'm he says I'll just
[1:34:36] admited I'd rather get in a car and
[1:34:37] drive 50 hours than get in a plane and
[1:34:39] two hours to be here he said I'm just
[1:34:41] he's terrified he says I I guess I took
[1:34:43] Jesus seriously when he said lo I Am
[1:34:46] With You
[1:34:50] Always and he was serious he was really
[1:34:54] scared and I took this flight back and
[1:34:56] this this young lady right beside me I
[1:34:59] was on the in the window seat and I hate
[1:35:01] the window seat worse than any seat uh
[1:35:04] you say he heard it worse than the than
[1:35:06] the middle no I I would have rather sit
[1:35:08] in the middle because at least I could
[1:35:09] not off and go to sleep but the the
[1:35:11] window seat and so this man's on the
[1:35:13] aisle This Woman's in the middle and I'm
[1:35:15] I'm on the in the window and I'm so
[1:35:18] tired I'm just wanting to go to wanting
[1:35:20] to go to sleep have you ever just wanted
[1:35:22] to go to sleep
[1:35:24] and you'd almost pay to go to sleep be
[1:35:25] able to to fall asleep and and it's just
[1:35:28] so you just want even on a plane you
[1:35:31] know you're wanting to to get plain I
[1:35:34] call it plain sleep and and I'm just
[1:35:36] wanting to fall asleep you know and I'm
[1:35:39] just noty not and I remember the flight
[1:35:41] oh boy here it comes when the captain's
[1:35:43] coming we haven't even taken off didn't
[1:35:45] push back and This Woman's talking to
[1:35:47] this man and she's just so nervous this
[1:35:49] is my first time flying I'm so scared
[1:35:51] and I just I don't know what to expect
[1:35:53] and I you know and I i' I've watched you
[1:35:55] know she started talking about how that
[1:35:57] she's watched these uh uh or seen these
[1:35:59] plane crash videos and and now I'm
[1:36:02] thinking why in the world would you
[1:36:03] afraid of flying you go watch
[1:36:06] that and so so she she's talking about
[1:36:09] how scared she is and and I'm just
[1:36:11] sitting here you know not just you can't
[1:36:12] help but you're listening right beside
[1:36:14] you and I'm not really taking part to
[1:36:16] sort of you know just thinking about the
[1:36:18] services and and they're over here just
[1:36:20] going he's he's trying oh no ma'am he
[1:36:22] says you you have nothing to worry about
[1:36:24] you know uh there's nothing to be scared
[1:36:26] of you know and she said well I'm just
[1:36:27] so worried about what it's going to take
[1:36:29] you know a little bit of turbulence and
[1:36:30] and that's just going to scare me out as
[1:36:32] bright as hope it's a smooth light and
[1:36:33] man they're just really going talking
[1:36:37] and so we go to and I'm thinking oh
[1:36:38] great you know you want to make me
[1:36:41] miserable uh put me beside someone
[1:36:43] that's scared of flying you make
[1:36:45] yourself you make you almost start
[1:36:47] getting scared
[1:36:50] yourself and she's so afraid of flying
[1:36:52] it almost puts thoughts in your mind
[1:36:54] like what's going to happen you know and
[1:36:56] and and so she's just going on and on
[1:36:58] and on and on and on about this and I'm
[1:37:00] thinking oh Lord just help me go to
[1:37:01] sleep please let me just fall fast
[1:37:03] asleep and so they we get up in the air
[1:37:06] and he takes off and the take off is
[1:37:07] smooth the whole time I mean I've never
[1:37:10] really I i' sort of in the my peripher
[1:37:12] had seen her and I could tell she's
[1:37:14] really scared like this isn't a put on
[1:37:16] she's really nervous and so we go to
[1:37:18] take off just a little bit more and then
[1:37:20] we get up to her chrisian altitude and
[1:37:22] and and and every little just I mean
[1:37:25] little bitty noticeable turb she would
[1:37:28] immediately say what was
[1:37:30] that what was that and and he would and
[1:37:33] and she'd get scared and he'd and and
[1:37:35] you could just tell she was just you
[1:37:36] know Breathing heavily and and and he
[1:37:38] starts oh no no it's it's just normal
[1:37:41] and you know the turbulence is just
[1:37:42] normal just a little bit you know uh uh
[1:37:44] air air winds that are blowing across
[1:37:46] the he's trying to get into the you know
[1:37:48] the science of turbulence with her and
[1:37:52] I'm just listening here just comes a
[1:37:53] little bit more what was that what was
[1:37:55] that you know what was that and and and
[1:37:59] and and he's just going on and so
[1:38:01] finally I remember uh they're talking
[1:38:04] and just go I'm having trouble so
[1:38:05] finally I spoke up and said man I said
[1:38:08] listen I've flown I start toing all the
[1:38:11] places in the world I've traveled I said
[1:38:13] I've flown you know and I start at that
[1:38:15] time I knew the statistics Delta they
[1:38:17] fly you know this many flights and
[1:38:19] there's the statistics of getting you
[1:38:21] know all the stories you get More's
[1:38:22] chances struck by light more chance of
[1:38:24] all this and I'm giving her all these
[1:38:26] statistics and you know and I'm really
[1:38:28] thinking man I'm really winning you know
[1:38:29] she's really she's getting this it's PE
[1:38:32] I could see the peace coming down upon
[1:38:35] her and she's coming and just coming
[1:38:38] okay okay I think I'm fine and I'm
[1:38:40] thinking oh Lord please let me just go
[1:38:42] to sleep and I'll never forget I finally
[1:38:45] just dozed off just where you just sort
[1:38:48] of you you're in that sleep and and
[1:38:50] everything's gone and you know and I
[1:38:53] don't know what happened we must have
[1:38:55] hit some turbulent bump and I'm not
[1:38:58] kidding you out of nowhere she grabs my
[1:39:02] arm and she says are we gonna be
[1:39:06] okay and I literally woke up went I
[1:39:09] don't
[1:39:11] know just as louder than
[1:39:14] her I said I don't
[1:39:17] know and and and I look and there's
[1:39:20] people everyone's turning around now no
[1:39:21] one looked at her but they're all
[1:39:22] looking at me like what's this guy's
[1:39:25] problem and I'm
[1:39:29] just you know trying to calm down you
[1:39:32] ever been woken up by your wife in the
[1:39:34] middle of the night when she hears a
[1:39:35] sound it's never a little gentle hey
[1:39:37] honey it's always wake up and it's just
[1:39:40] immediate you're Jed what's happening
[1:39:43] and you think someone's G to be standing
[1:39:45] over your your bed ready to kill
[1:39:47] you and that's how this was it just Jed
[1:39:50] me and what was that and she looked at
[1:39:52] me she said like I'm so I'm so
[1:39:56] sorry needless to say I did not sleep
[1:39:59] the rest of that
[1:40:00] flight I just stayed with her and she
[1:40:04] was but I you know it's a funny
[1:40:07] story and laughter's laughter is a good
[1:40:10] medicine right but it it's amazing
[1:40:13] because out of all of that I begin the
[1:40:16] Lord begin to deal with me and the Lord
[1:40:19] began to say you know when you take this
[1:40:22] flight of life
[1:40:24] there's something amazing about
[1:40:27] flying it's it's maybe most of the time
[1:40:31] I can just tell you from fly most of the
[1:40:32] time you never even see the Pilot's face
[1:40:35] before you get on the
[1:40:36] plane never see him you definitely don't
[1:40:39] get to know him unless you're you know
[1:40:41] some lucky have some privilege you don't
[1:40:43] get to find out unless they announce it
[1:40:45] you don't know if he's a novice did he
[1:40:47] get out of training today has he been a
[1:40:49] veteran is you know you don't know any
[1:40:51] of that you just put your trust in
[1:40:54] someone you've never
[1:40:57] met you put your trust in someone you've
[1:41:00] never seen most likely you don't know
[1:41:03] and the entire flight they're behind a
[1:41:06] closed door you never hear them you
[1:41:10] never you never see them you never have
[1:41:12] a conversation when there's a turbulent
[1:41:14] moment you can't say hey Captain is
[1:41:15] everything okay is that
[1:41:18] normal but you've put your trust in
[1:41:20] order to fly you have to put your trust
[1:41:23] in somebody who's invisible to
[1:41:28] you and the Lord begin to to to to to
[1:41:31] speak to me and say in this life you've
[1:41:33] got to put your trust not just your life
[1:41:37] but you got to put your your wife's life
[1:41:39] your children's life your family's life
[1:41:42] you've got to put everything that's
[1:41:44] important and dear to
[1:41:47] you because if you don't you're going to
[1:41:49] live like that woman you're going to be
[1:41:50] in constant fear and constant anxiety
[1:41:53] and and Afraid and every little
[1:41:54] turbulence that comes in life and every
[1:41:56] little uncertainty and you're not so
[1:41:59] sure you'll question everything and and
[1:42:02] and and doubt and fear will begin to
[1:42:04] paralyze you is anybody here
[1:42:07] today but God says do you trust me have
[1:42:11] you put your life or are you grappled
[1:42:13] and and Paralyzed by fear to every
[1:42:15] situation every problem or do you know
[1:42:18] I've got it all under control and I'm
[1:42:20] the pilot of your life not just your but
[1:42:23] your entire family I'm in control of the
[1:42:26] turns I'm in control of the turbulence
[1:42:28] the Bible says this about the Lord David
[1:42:31] said in Psalms he says he's the Lord who
[1:42:33] sth upon the
[1:42:35] flood you ever caught that before I'm
[1:42:38] the Lord who sth upon not in not of but
[1:42:41] I'm on top
[1:42:43] of I'm on top of the flood I put my
[1:42:47] throne here it say I got a flood in my
[1:42:49] life he's the Lord who sth upon your
[1:42:51] flood I've got a fire in my life he's
[1:42:54] the Fourth Man in the middle of your
[1:42:56] fire I'm drowning he's the one uh
[1:42:58] reaching a hand to pull you up out of
[1:43:00] the water Peter do you trust
[1:43:03] him do you have faith to face your your
[1:43:10] fear a captain at every moment who's in
[1:43:16] control you know what's so
[1:43:19] reassuring so reassuring if you ever
[1:43:22] flown you go through a a lot of
[1:43:23] turbulence and you're wondered and
[1:43:25] people almost start looking at each
[1:43:27] other like I don't know is this normal
[1:43:29] and you know what's going on everybody
[1:43:31] looks calm I guess it's
[1:43:33] normal and you're you're you're you're
[1:43:35] you're startled because of something
[1:43:37] maybe going through a storm there's
[1:43:38] nothing ever more reassuring than
[1:43:40] hearing the
[1:43:42] captain hello ladies and gentlemen this
[1:43:45] is your captain speaking from the flight
[1:43:46] deck little bit of turbulence here we're
[1:43:48] going to try to go up to a little few
[1:43:49] thousand feet higher to get out of this
[1:43:51] there's nothing more
[1:43:55] why why because you hear the captain's
[1:44:00] voice and sometimes in life there's
[1:44:02] nothing more reassuring than saying Lord
[1:44:03] let me just hear your voice if I could
[1:44:06] just hear you speak in the middle of all
[1:44:08] the turbulence if I could just hear the
[1:44:10] captain come on and say it's going to be
[1:44:13] okay it's going to be okay child I've
[1:44:15] got this under control a little bit of

[1:46:50] here with me this is very familiar
[1:46:52] Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of
[1:46:54] gold whose height was three score cubits
[1:46:57] and the breadth thereof six cubits and
[1:46:59] he set it up in the plane of dura in the
[1:47:02] province of Babylon then an arrow I want
[1:47:04] you to just follow me along if you could
[1:47:06] just Advance it uh verse two brother
[1:47:09] Jeremy then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent
[1:47:11] together the princes the the governors
[1:47:13] the captains the judges the treasurers
[1:47:15] the counselors the sheriffs all the
[1:47:16] rulers of the provinces to come to the
[1:47:19] dedication of the image which
[1:47:20] Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up so
[1:47:22] all the important people all of the all
[1:47:25] the most prominent are there then the
[1:47:27] princes the governors captains judges
[1:47:29] Treasures counselors sheriffs rulers
[1:47:30] provinces were gathered together in the
[1:47:32] dedication of the image that
[1:47:33] Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and
[1:47:34] they stood before the image that
[1:47:35] Nebuchadnezzar had set up verse four
[1:47:37] then an Aral cried aloud this is this is
[1:47:40] this is a decree from the King then in
[1:47:42] Herald cried aloud to you it is
[1:47:46] commanded oh people Nations and
[1:47:50] languages he says that at what time
[1:47:53] you hear the sound of the Cornet the
[1:47:55] flute the harp all of these beautiful
[1:47:57] instruments is going to have an entire
[1:47:59] stage of instruments all it says all
[1:48:01] kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship
[1:48:06] the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
[1:48:08] King has has set up uh he says and who
[1:48:12] so falleth not down and
[1:48:15] worshipthe same hour be cast into the
[1:48:18] midst of a burning fiery furnace
[1:48:23] verse seven just keep going therefore at
[1:48:25] the time when the people heard the sound
[1:48:26] of the Cornet the flute the harp sack
[1:48:28] with suttry and all kinds of music and
[1:48:29] all the people the Nations languages
[1:48:31] fell down and worshiped the golden image
[1:48:34] that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
[1:48:38] so everyone everyone in unison bows down
[1:48:43] now of course these were these were uh H
[1:48:46] Babylonians here they they had 30 gods
[1:48:50] in the trunk of their car this was just
[1:48:52] another it wasn't anything for them to
[1:48:54] Bow oh it's all they did in their entire
[1:48:57] life was to Bow Down and Worship
[1:49:00] right but but there's only this entire
[1:49:03] decree is not in other words the fear
[1:49:05] and and the
[1:49:07] intimidation that the devil that
[1:49:09] Nebuchadnezzar has set up is only there
[1:49:13] to afflict three
[1:49:17] people the whole system the whole stage
[1:49:19] the whole world no one is going to have
[1:49:21] a problem going with the the flow except
[1:49:24] three Jewish
[1:49:25] boys who's been taught who's been raised
[1:49:29] who's been raised differently in fact
[1:49:31] their names he Shadrach Meek and abedo
[1:49:34] are not even their names that's the
[1:49:35] names that he uh Nebuchadnezzar renames
[1:49:38] them there their hananiah and mishel and
[1:49:40] Azariah was their Hebrew names and their
[1:49:43] names have totally different meanings
[1:49:45] completely
[1:49:46] different but he names them this and he
[1:49:48] says he says you're to bow down and so
[1:49:50] now the Bible says here and he says and
[1:49:53] and just keep going he verse 8 wherefore
[1:49:56] at a certain time certain chians came
[1:49:57] near and accused the Jews verse 9 they
[1:50:00] spake and said to the Nebuchadnezzar oh
[1:50:02] King live forever thou oh King has made
[1:50:04] a decree that every man that shall hear
[1:50:06] the sound of the Corn now all the music
[1:50:07] shall follow Down and Worship the image
[1:50:09] verse 11 and who so falleth not down and
[1:50:11] worship that he should be cast into the
[1:50:13] midst of a burning fiery furnace there
[1:50:14] are certain
[1:50:16] Jews whom thou set over the Affairs of
[1:50:18] the province of Babylon Shadrach Meshach
[1:50:20] and abedo these men oh King have have
[1:50:22] not regarded thee they serve not thy
[1:50:25] Gods nor worship the golden image which
[1:50:27] thou has set up verse 13 the
[1:50:31] Nebuchadnezzar in his
[1:50:33] rage and fury commanded to bring
[1:50:36] Shadrach meach and abedo then they
[1:50:39] brought these men before the
[1:50:40] King Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto
[1:50:43] them now notice how he says this here's

[1:53:35] the children of God I'm not even going
[1:53:38] to talk to you I'm not even going to
[1:53:39] reason sometimes we make our biggest
[1:53:41] mistake when we start reasoning and
[1:53:43] talking with the devil and trying to
[1:53:45] reason things well I think maybe I can
[1:53:48] give a little here I guess I could
[1:53:49] compromise I won't be too bad the shadra
[1:53:52] m check and abedo said we don't you
[1:53:54] don't even deserve an answer we don't
[1:53:57] we're not under we're not subservient to
[1:53:59] you we're not of your
[1:54:02] kingdom this is what you ought to tell
[1:54:04] the devil you don't deserve my time you
[1:54:07] don't deserve an answer you don't even
[1:54:09] deserve my

[1:56:14] save my God's able to deliver and that's
[1:56:18] what my faith says my brother my sister
[1:56:20] that is not the kind of fa Faith verse
[1:56:22] 17 Faith is not faith that faces
[1:56:28] fear let me show you what is Verse 18
[1:56:32] this is the kind of faith we need
[1:56:36] but
[1:56:37] if
[1:56:42] not but if not think about
[1:56:48] that think about what they were saying
[1:56:52] what their faith was
[1:56:54] projecting Our God verse 17 our God is
[1:56:57] able and he will but here's faith that
[1:57:00] faces and defeats fear here's faith that
[1:57:03] rebukes the enemy here's the kind of
[1:57:05] faith that shuts the mouth of the devil
[1:57:07] here's the kind of faith that silences
[1:57:10] his Whispers And His words upon your
[1:57:12] life even if
[1:57:16] not in other words even if he doesn't
[1:57:19] even if what Shadrach even if he doesn't
[1:57:22] show up in the fire and I perish by the
[1:57:25] fire even if it doesn't happen here's
[1:57:29] what my faith says but if not be it
[1:57:31] known in other words this was not this
[1:57:34] was for for for Shadrach M and abedo
[1:57:38] this is a firm answer this isn't a shaky
[1:57:41] answer this is this is something it was
[1:57:43] a principle it shows you their mind was
[1:57:46] made up and that it was with them it was
[1:57:48] a matter that was already over
[1:57:53] that even if he doesn't deliver me make
[1:57:59] sure you know this Satan make sure you
[1:58:04] know this make sure you hear it come out
[1:58:06] of my mouth we will not serve your
[1:58:12] Gods we will not worship the golden
[1:58:16] image which thou has set up be it known
[1:58:19] make sure you know it Satan that even if
[1:58:22] I go through the fire and I perish even
[1:58:25] if God doesn't heal me that doesn't mean
[1:58:27] he's not a Healer even if God doesn't
[1:58:30] save me that doesn't mean he's not a
[1:58:32] savior can I get an amen this morning
[1:58:34] even if he doesn't deliver me that
[1:58:36] changes nothing about my
[1:58:39] faith can you do that to today friend
[1:58:42] can you say that to the Lord Lord it
[1:58:44] doesn't matter it doesn't change
[1:58:46] anything the prophet of God said even if
[1:58:48] he sends me to hell even if he sends me
[1:58:50] to Hell he's done enough for me for the
[1:58:52] rest of my life to thank him and to
[1:58:54] praise him this is the faith that meets
[1:58:57] The
[1:59:01] Impossible and you know what happened
[1:59:03] because they got to verse 18 Faith verse
[1:59:07] 19
[1:59:08] comes then was Nebuchadnezzar full of
[1:59:11] Fury you want to make the devil mad have
[1:59:14] Verse 18 Faith because Satan always
[1:59:17] looks at symptoms he always says I do
[1:59:19] this and how do they
[1:59:21] respond I attack them here and their
[1:59:23] hands go down their mouth Zips they
[1:59:24] don't worship they don't praise see know
[1:59:26] what it does he keeps working he keeps
[1:59:28] pushing he keeps pressuring what makes

[1:59:50] I'm about to go over I'm raising my hand
[1:59:52] saying Lord you're worthy of my
[1:59:55] praise he was full of Fury changed
[1:59:58] musicians come Meshach and abedo
[2:00:00] therefore he spoke and commanded them
[2:00:01] that they should heat the furnace one
[2:00:03] seven times more than it want to be
[2:00:05] heated verse
[2:00:06] 20 and he commanded the most mighty men
