just your need this from this morning has been on our hearts this afternoon and the lord knows everything and i was just thinking there as we were singing brother john you put a little ben out there in the fellowship hall and come up here and talk to the people about testimonies and i know i haven't written one and i'm sorry brother john but it's been on my heart and i've had the envelope i even took the envelope to idaho and oregon with us and but i started thinking as we were singing i thought here's a testimony in the making amen the lord knows everything not sure it may have been conveyed real well this morning but her need is a serious need but we have a god that can deliver and answer prayer and as we feel led this this evening maybe sister rebecca brother lyle was talking about anointing you with oil at the end of the service if you would like and so we just want to remember you in prayer and all the needs that were brought this morning as well but that one just really touched my heart and let's just remember her surgery on tuesday or maybe the lord would intervene before then and it's not necessary and the doctors find it say all is well no no problems amen amen let's sing nothing but the blood amen what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of jesus what can make me hold again nothing but the blood of

but the blood of jesus amen you get the impression from this author nothing but the blood of jesus amen you might say it's a little bit repetitive but i think there's a reason for it for us to realize and know what christ did for us saved us from death and giving our our life and going to hell amen amen let's just sing another song he's coming soon he's coming soon then we'll go to the needs this evening he's he's coming soon he's coming soon he's coming soon with joy will welcome his returning it may be more it may be night or new we know he's coming soon oh yes he's coming soon he's coming soon with joy will welcome his returning [Applause] may be more it may be night or new we know he's coming [Music] he's coming soon with joy will welcome his returning it may be more it may be night or [Music] maybe we didn't have any requests turned in specifically this evening but i did bring up sister rebecca zambrunin's request again this evening so let's just remember her let's remember sister yarborough's grandson hudson that was mentioned this morning as well sister connie carey as well and also brother aaron sent me a message just a few moments ago he said they just got home everything was safe and i want to thank everyone for his prayers safe traveling mercies i think he said over 3000 miles so sound like they were really enjoying themselves i was starting to think of their kind of home bodies they might get up there and realize they didn't want to be traveling too much and it was wore them out but nina said they were really enjoying it so that's really good to hear and glad they were able to see some wonderful things in god's creation and so forth amen let's just stand this evening this thing jesus breaks every fetter [Music] jesus breaks every feather brother peter mcfadden jesus breaks jesus breaks [Music] every factor [Music] i will never doubt my savior i will never doubt my savior i will never ever [Music] amen it's good to be here in the house of the lord i think of that one that said lord i believe help thou my unbelief so i can't in myself promise this but by his grace i believe that he'll take care of us and help us just a little praise that we're thinking about today there was a someone on the counter left a bottle of lotion and it was the kind of lotion that we used to put on abel when he was young because he had really really dried up skin and it was really just something that was a big burden for us when he was young was he had really bad skin we had to put this lotion on and we we just asked the lord to heal him and we've forgotten that this isn't a part of our lives to to deal with that dry skin he has good skin the lord answered that prayer and you know we're so quick to forget sometimes all the things that the lord's done for us but the only reason we're here the only reason we're here with the right mind is by his grace this this world is crazy and we always say that we focus on that but here's a people that are in their right mind that have the mind of christ that love the lord jesus that loving one another what a blessing what a thing to thank the lord for to say my brother my sister is still standing by his grace and through his blood let's just thank him father we can't glorify you enough for your goodness lord for your grace for your kindness lord and father we know that you're the same yesterday today and forever and lord your arms not shortened you're still the savior there's still the healer lord you're still the truth the way in the life father oh god [Music] thank you that we can come into your presence once again lord that presence that there is no way into that presence father but you made a way you came and lord you bore my sins my my failings my unbelief lord you came and nailed that to the cross father you purchased our salvation you even purchased our healing lord so forever we need healing lord as a body and as individuals lord in our minds and our spirits our souls our bodies lord whatever it is father you're that same healer or give us faith that we could reach out and touch you you sent your word and healed our diseases lord we believe that there's a finished work but lord we believe we're still bearing the dividends of that we're still receiving the benefits of that lord that we can leave here father healed pray lord for the rest of this service for brother lyle that you'd anoint his lips lord anoint our ears and father would you receive all the glory and all the honor would you this week lord as we go from here just help us to honor you lord and to love you more love one another more father you know every need that we have and you've already paid the price help us to believe lord and thank you that it is well it is finished we love you lord and commit the rest of the service into your hand in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ amen i'll just sing a few more verses of this song as we turn the service over to brother lyle i am now on the altar [Music] i am now on the altar [Music] i am now on the altar which was made which was me for me i will rest on his promise i will rest [Music] his promises i will rest on his promise i

will shout hallelujah [Music] amen thank you so much good evening so good to be back in the presence of my brothers and sisters the family of jesus christ it's a privilege to be assembled together it's an honor it's an honor you know we know that today marks the 21st anniversary of a brutal attack on our nation by some people that hated us hated what we stood for as a nation despised those of us who were christians people whose interpretation of their religion taught them to kill those that don't believe the way that they do is doing god a service a service for which they will receive eternal life offsetting the penalties of their sins earning salvation through violence against others the attack was a wake-up call from complacency living in a society with a false sense of safety yet today we see increasing violence on our streets our schools our neighborhoods a deterioration of respect for life the loss of respect for others we heard the sermon this morning about respect for god a nation deeply divided being bombarded with a constant stream of commentary masquerading as truth by peddlers of influence it's a sad time it's a dark time it's an increasingly dangerous time but tonight i want to speak not of the attack in 2001 but of another day i want to speak of a day that's the greatest day in the history of our planet a day of hope i trust it will be an encouragement to you but before we approach the word let's approach the author together lord jesus it is such a humbling experience to be standing before those that you have purchased with your blood not because i'm anyone because you've purchased me by that same blood but lord jesus says we're here together to worship you to hear from you lord we pray that you would speak to us lord i ask that you set me aside forgive me lord of the sin the unbelief in my life the weakness the timidity the the the the cowardice lord and just help me lord to share what you've placed i believe in my heart and help those that are here that hear to hear through the ears that you want them to hear to hear what you want said lord we commit the remainder of this service to you and we thank you so much for the privilege we have to be together we ask these things in the name of our lord and our savior jesus christ that name above all names amen tonight we're going to be sharing about faith about hope about knowledge and revelation about the cross and the tomb and about an obscure participant who made one of the most profound statements of faith in the gospels if not in the entire bible one whom we don't often think of and generally don't think much of but our first topic versus while we're standing in respect of the word are found in the gospel of saint luke the 24th chapter the context is on the afternoon of that first easter sunday two were walking from jerusalem to emmaus emmaus let's join them for for a few minutes as they as they walk along we read in luke 24 starting at verse 13 and behold two of them who followers of jesus went that same day the first easter the day of the resurrection of jesus to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about three score furlongs you don't have to look at your apple watch to see how much that is that's about seven miles approximately so it's a two or three hour walk over hilly terrain and they talk together of all those things that had happened the events of the past few days during the passover commemoration in jerusalem and it came to pass that while they communed together while they discussed while they talked and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them so we see two people walking along they're discussing what they saw what they heard a third person a stranger to them they think joins them on the path and starts walking with them uh those of you that have been to heather's in my house you've probably seen this picture hanging on the wall that was painted by a good friend of ours from a photograph but this is what we believe to be the site of emmaus you can see the ruins in the foreground of a fourth century church there was a a baptistery and a and a mosaic there and brother arne you may recall that it was in an upper room there that we had communion in 1976 with brother greene and the and the tour that came through my my brother paul lived in the sub-basement of this building for a few years and we went there trying to fix this place up uh it's in the valley of iolan you may recall joshua 10 12 when the sun stood still and the moon stood still over iowa this is that location emmaus their eyes were holden that they should not know him in other words they didn't recognize him jesus is so often throughout the bible was now in a different theophany and jesus said unto them what manner of communications are those that you have one to another as you walk and are sad the niv reads he asked them what are you discussing together as you walk along and they stood still their faces downcast i want you to take a good look here in your mind's eye these two people are downcast they're sad jesus is walking next to them on the most triumphant day of his ministry and they're sad and one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him are you only a stranger in jerusalem and haven't known the things which have come to pass here in these days cleopas seems a bit taken aback that anyone coming on the road from jerusalem could be ignorant of the events that this stranger must have overheard them discussing reading on and jesus said to them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people and and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted other translations read had hoped that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done trusted had hoped had been it's all past tense now they're without that hope they're sad they're downcast they saw jesus as a prophet now deceased read more of this encounter in a bit read another couple of places before we're seated this time from a letter that paul wrote hebrews chapter 11 the first couple of verses it's very familiar to us now faith is what foolishness or ignorant or silly people karl marx's opiate of the people to help them live their miserable lives no faith is a substance it's real of things hoped for so it starts with hope no hope no faith we had hoped the evidence of things not seen for by it by faith by that substance of hope the elders obtained a good report and through faith rather than our physical eyesight and natural intellect we understand the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen the physical universe around us were not made of things which do appear and finally the gospel of john the first chapter what paul's epistle is referring to regarding the creation we read in the beginning was the word and the word was with god no no not only that the word was god the same was in the beginning with god and all things were made by him that's exactly what we just read in hebrews without him was not anything made that was made skipping down to 14 the word that is to say god jehovah the invisible creator that paul wrote of was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten or could be interpreted uniquely begotten of the father full of grace and truth speaking we know of jesus please be seated to help provide some context for this for the next few minutes i'd like us to try and imagine a world without cars without electricity no indoor plumbing microwave ovens no internet no computers not even telephones no radio television movies no documentaries no hollywood no books no advertising no walmart no costco no amazon no trains no planes a world where almost everyone worked hard talking physical labor every day just to scrape by to get enough to eat your home is probably made of mud brick or perhaps if you're fortunate it might be made of stone there's no heating in the winter there's certainly no air conditioning or evaporative cooling in the summer this is a hot place where you live simple clothing it's usually homemade there's no brand names or labels straightforward sandals no enclosed shoes no heels no socks if you are what we think of his school age if you're a child there's no school as soon as you're old enough you go out there and work in the fields to help grow the food to feed your family dawn to dusk rain or shine hot or cold and every so often a soldier comes by not one of your countrymen but an invader a foreigner who's conquered your territory he's got his weapons with him and he demands and takes what he wants from your meager provisions whatever he wants he takes and if you don't want to give it to him you risk injury captivity or even death welcome to judea you've been told all your life god is merciful he'll deliver you and your neighbors from these invaders he's stronger than they are but every day you see the invaders are still there on your sabbath day one day a week you're able to go to a we'd think of it as a church a synagogue and hear someone read from a scroll you're told to memorize these words meditate on them you can't read or write and even if you could you couldn't afford a scroll for generations you and your ancestors have been told to meditate on these writings beginning with words that came through a prophet named moshe moses some 15 centuries before the parts you find easiest to remember are called psalms they're poetry there's music melody rhythm to them that you can hear in your mind it helps you remember a famous king named david wrote many of them but that was about a thousand years ago and his kingdom that was promised to be everlasting was split by a civil war 40 years after his death its territory was completely overrun and conquered by assyrians and babylonians within 400 years the holy temple was utterly destroyed lay in ruins for almost a century before your ancestors were allowed to repair it allowed by a foreign conqueror yours have been a conquered people for some 600 years a number too big and a time too long to have much meaning to you an uprising a century or two ago led by a fellow called you to maccabee resulted in a brief period of self-rule but it quickly turned into a fractious power struggle and a few decades the romans swept it all up and installed a puppet ruler a collaborator named herod some 70 years prior but recently there's been a young preacher named yeshua wandering about the region of galilee and speaking about hope and peace and love he's gathered a following there are many reports of miracles especially of healings even some stories if you can believe them of dead people rising up from their death beds or even in a funeral procession his students his disciples include simple folk like fishermen not rabbinical students not priests not levites none of the elite pay much attention to this fellow at least one of his group is a member of the zealot party advocating violent overthrow of the government another disgustingly as a collaborator with the hated roman occupiers a publican no less one who steals money from everyone under the guise of taxes the worst kind of trader to his own people yeshua this fellow we know is jesus seems to get much of his financial support from a group of women of means what's up with that well let's turn now to an event fairly early in jesus ministry as recorded in mark chapter 4 matthew chapter 8. jesus is taught by the seaside it's the lake side really of the canarit this picture to your left is a is a view of the canary what we read as being the sea of galilee it's mostly a shallow lake the deepest part is 144 feet but the surface of this lake is 600 feet below sea level the lowest place we have in america is about 120 feet below sea level this is 600 feet below sea level it gets hot there it's in a deep valley that runs basically north to south you can see in this photograph from space there's the sea of galilee there's the dead sea jerusalem would be about there but what happens here is there's often a confluence of winds you have cold air coming from mount hormone the snow-covered slopes to the north hot air coming up from 1200 feet below sea level to 600 coming up from the dead sea you get winds coming off the mediterranean that's only 30 miles away and really hot winds home seem we called them when we lived in israel coming from the deserts of saudi arabia and so forth to the east and this confluence of winds often leads to sudden storms the lake can have waves over 10 feet high that appear without warning there's no weather wrap on your smartphone to warn you there's no eas tones to give you a national weather service advisory well let's let's join them now we've we've got the setting here mark 4 verse 35. the same day when evening was come jesus said unto them his small group of students his disciples let's pass over to the other side let's cross the lake jesus has been sitting in a boat near the edge of the lake teaching the people when jesus stands up he might be reading or preaching but when he sits down he's teaching and when they had sent away the multitude the large crowd that had gathered to hear him speak over the sound of the breaking waves on the lakeshore without the benefit of an av system they took him even as he was in the ship the small boat from which he had been addressing the crowd and there were also with them other little ships you think ships what do we think of as a ship we think of something that crosses the ocean now these this is what they mean by ships you can see it's relatively small maybe 20 feet long three or four people can manage the whole thing there's no keel it has very shallow draft this is a first century ship that was recovered from the sea of galilee and it's in a museum people standing by you can get an idea of the size so jesus is in a small lake boat there's other small watercraft as well it's a fishing village area so with that that picture in your mind let's read on let's see what happened it says there arose a great storm of wind later in the bible we hear of a rushing mighty wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full it's going to capsize remember some of these disciples made their living on this very lake so this is one of those storms that comes up very quickly it's violent it's especially dangerous in a small craft like this with shallow draft these men of the lake didn't see it coming they didn't say whoa lord we see a cloud rising let's wait until tomorrow to cross the lake no they were crossing the lake the waves were high enough that even these experienced boat men turning the craft to face the waves to minimize the amount of water that would come in or to prevent the thing from flipping over they're dealing with water that's filled the interior of the boat and jesus was in the back of the ship the hinder part asleep asleep he must have been weary completely exhausted drained remember how brother branham said sometimes they had to virtually carry him off the platform after a healing service we have no record of this day having been one of healings but whatever the cause jesus is exhausted he's sleeping resting on some sort of a cushion or a pillow and they awake him that must have taken some doing the boat's being tossed about the wind is howling the waves are crashing there's cries of fear people are in danger of losing their lives on a wickedly violent sea and is asleep but somehow they're able to rouse him and they say to him master rabbi teacher is the meaning of the word carest thou not that we perish how can you sleep we need help don't you realize we're in danger of losing our lives including you wake up lend a hand help us keep this boat afloat there's great fear here and what happens and and jesus arose oh it was a deep sleep it wasn't like he was instantly awake he's not a magic guy he's a human being oh oh so taking a moment to see then he rebuked the wind and he said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and jesus said to his small student group why are ye so fearful is it that you have no faith now jesus is clearly aware of their extremity he names it fear but he says a very curious thing how is it you have no faith why is there no evidence of your hope your confidence in god again we note they were fearful but now they've been delivered they should be rejoicing right they should be happy i i remember that time i've told you the story when we were coming from israel and the plane lost compression to 747 at 40 000 feet we went to a steep dive into the mountains of what was in yugoslavia people were screaming and fearful when the plane leveled out people stopped screaming they stopped being fearful they were really quite happy okay so these guys should be happy they've just been rescued so let's read the next verse we'll see what happens after the calming of the storm they were fearful and now they feared a little their fear ceased no now they feared exceedingly their fear increased they said one to another what manner of man is this who is this guy in the boat with us that even the wind and the sea obey him it's a good question but why the extreme heightened fear after miraculous rescue by a person that they've seen perform miracles on a regular basis maybe perhaps they recalled a passage from the tanakh the bible of jesus day a section of scripture perhaps that raised an alarm within them remember these people could not read nor write the knowledge of the scriptures that they possess is what they memorized what they recalled so why moses told them to meditate day and night recite the words of the law in the morning at noon at night repeat repeat repeat repetition drive it into your mind drive it into your heart don't forget so that you don't sin against god david writes in the 119th psalm starting at verse 9. he says wherewithal or how shall a young man cleanse his way how shall a young man live a clean life by taking heed according to thy word david writes with my whole heart have i sought thee let me not wander from thy commandments how thy word have i hid in mine heart not in my cell phone that i might not sin against thee blessed art thou o lord teach me thy statutes he goes on with my lips have i declared all the judgments of thy mouth he's talking about meditation he's talking about recitation a memory aid i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches i will meditate in i will remember i will recite i will recall thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways i will delight myself in thy statutes i will not forget thy word memory is enhanced through repetition i recall learning the gettysburg address when i was in grade school i would read it recite it go back and reread then recite with my brothers or my parents listening to correct me and repeat until i knew it all 272 words years later i still knew it today no not so much i haven't meditated on it to remember it to rehearse it in my mind for many years well as i mentioned earlier in jesus day the people knew the scriptures by memory paul tells us faith comes by hearing the word people couldn't read that's how you're going to expose yourself to the word is by hearing it and frankly it seems to me sometimes our ability to read has lessened our ability to remember because we can grab the book we can refer to it okay so what happens let's get back to that just calmed storm on the lake why did the level of fear increase with these men why weren't they rejoicing in their salvation from that storm i think they recalled a psalm psalm 89 verse 6 says for who in heaven can be compared unto the lord who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the lord as you know the psalms are poetry is the kind of poetry that's a doublet a phrase is made and another phrase with the same meaning repeats it to reinforce it its couplets its pairs god is greatly to be fair feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him o lord of hosts who is a strong lord like unto thee or to thy faithfulness round about thee thou rulest the raging of the sea when the waves thereof arise thou stillest them they sang this probably pretty much like we sing he is the master of the wind thou rulest the raging of the sea they had just witnessed a fulfillment of psalm 89 9. they knew that only god the lord jehovah the one they worshiped could speak to a storm on the sea and still it but they also knew god is a spirit but this was a man that spoke fear confusion what manner of man is this they confess the shema here o israel the lord our god the lord is one how could this guy in the boat somehow be god himself it just doesn't make sense so they feared greatly after that storm was calmed what manner of men is this oh we know from the psalms only god himself can do this this man was just napping in the boat with us and asked us about our faith and then ruled over the raging sea and still what's going on confused fearful well let's move on a few months later in jesus ministry the scene here jesus is walking down the road with his disciples and they're talking right passing the time as you walk together among friends right this is a very familiar passage to us it's recorded in three of the gospels matthew's account is the most complete so let's listen in now on matthew 16 beginning at verse 13. when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi coast is again king james it just means the borders it got to the city limit sign that said entering caesarea philippi elevation so and so founded such and such a time he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said oh some say you're john the baptist some elias some jeremias or one of the prophets he said unto them well whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ you're the anointed the son of the living god and only matthew records this next part jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church the gates of hell shall not prevail against it we've heard this many times the rock the revelation of who jesus is but a revelation to be revealed if you think of a statue and you pull the cloth off and it's revealed but do you still really understand the statue you can see it it's been revealed it's been exposed did peter really grasp at that time that revelation he did later but if he or any of the others really understood would they have abandoned him in gethsemane did they really understand that he was not simply the anointed one the christ that he wasn't just a specially selected human when he later said i and my father are one if you've seen me you've seen the father he said to philip have i been so long with you did they really understand now we know on the day of pentecost peter really had the revelation and the understanding of what was revealed to him of who jesus was i love peter's first sermon we'll take just one line of it the the punch line the climatic statement that led to the conversion of three thousand we could spend considerable time on just this one verse and i put fresh batteries in the in the microphone here but but i'll try not to run them down so we'll just read this one verse from acts 2 36 therefore let all the house of israel know what sure ridley based on the things that i just told you there can be zero doubt that god hath made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ lord if this were in hebrew and said to greek it would be in all capitals not just one anointed by god but the god who anointed god himself in human flesh so human that that body could and did die but we could spend all night on just a little couple verses of acts too but i no lie don't do that we spoke here one evening a few months ago about confession that paul had people imprisoned and even killed for the simple statement jesus is lord because the claim was capital l o r d the claim was that jesus was jehovah that was what the religious leaders of his day were upset with jesus about to the point they had him killed in a most brutal fashion we read in john 10. jesus is speaking to these folks and he says i and my father are one well they knew exactly who he meant when he said father then the jews took up stones again to stone him to kill him by throwing rocks at him smashing his body breaking his bones jesus answered them many good works have i showed you from my father for which of those works do you stone me the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy because of thou being a man maketh thyself god you being a man make yourself god the ultimate blasphemy unless of course it's the truth the fulfillment of isaiah's prophecy that they knew very well isaiah 9 verse 6 reads unto us the jewish people yes a child is born a human baby a man a person unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever it's not talking about kicking the romans out how is this going to be done the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this there was great certainty in isaiah's prophecy it's one thing to study something centuries old think well someday this is going to happen discuss it ponder it interpret it teach that interpretation keep it at some distance it's quite another to witness it realize that if you are witnessing as true then all that theology understanding and teaching was wrong if what you're seeing is really it after all we saw in acts 2 36 peter by then realized it and risked his life to tell it to preach it to a crowd and instead of retribution instead of a riot bringing the roman soldiers to restore peace there was instead a revival 3 000 were added the church in jerusalem was suddenly 20 times larger than it had been that morning why was that sermon so powerful no i'll be here all night if i talk about that as much as we focus on peter there was another disciple that had that realization the understanding of peter's revelation perhaps before peter did he was certainly the first to unequivocally state it in the gospels go back with me to that first easter we were with those gentlemen walking down the road to emmaus let's go earlier in the day before sunrise there was a disciple confused not understanding but determined to go and see jesus prophecy fulfilled on that third day that he would rise from the dead and went to the tomb and who was it it wasn't peter it wasn't john it wasn't james it wasn't jesus mother it was mary magdalene on this most glorious of mornings it has ever been on the crowning day of jesus ministry and life the proof and confirmation of it all that the work of the cross really had meaning was there a crowd of those who had followed him sat at his feet that had then gone out and preached the gospel to the surrounding towns and villages those who had hung on his words and believed him when he said he'd be killed but rise from the dead on the third day no they were hiding just mary a vulnerable woman one who deeply loved jesus would do anything for jesus we find her walking alone in the pre-dawn darkness an arrested city crowded with pilgrims you can be sure there were plenty of opportunists to take advantage of the crowds just mary alone out the city gates down a dark path illuminated only by the moon into a cemetery to a tomb a crypt sealed with a massive stone guarded by soldiers let's go to john 20 verse 1. the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark under the sepulcher and see if the stone taken away from the sepulchre we talked about that before this particular phrasing means that it was tilted it was out of place it hadn't been rolled away and she runs and comes to simon peter into other disciples we know is john and said to them they've taken away the lord master out of the sepulcher and we know not where they have laid him we know peter and john hurried to the tomb they went inside they saw the grave clothes no body no jesus no angels no earthquake nothing they left the site returned to the group of mourners in hiding fearful skipping now to verse 11. but mary remained she stood without it means outside of the sepulcher she'd stoop she looked it she was weeping she didn't hurry away with peter and john with the safety of being accompanied by these two men returning back into the city she was alone she was in great sorrow more sorrow than we've seen in these past few days at the passing of queen elizabeth and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulcher and saw two angels peter and john didn't see them two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet were the body of jesus at lane remember when jesus went to the home of jairus his daughter had died people were mourning jesus said she's asleep they laughed he said get everybody out of here i don't want any unbelief around me and raised her from the dead here we have peter and john and they had to leave mary was still there and we see what they say to her woman why weepest now she said unto them they've taken away my lord i don't know where they've laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back she couldn't continue the conversation she was overcome and she saw this guy standing it was jesus but she didn't know that and jesus said to her exactly the same thing the angels had said woman why weepesta whom seek us thou lady you're so sad why are you crying are you looking for someone she supposing him to be the gardener i love that the second adam was thought to be a gardener and the first adam's job was to be a gardener but she's this this person she thought was the gardener turns to him and said sir if you've taken his body from here tell me where you've laid him and i'll take him away jesus said to her mary she turned herself and said to him rabboni which is to say master robonai is a very personal thing it's not rabbi it's rabona my master my teacher she saw him knew he was jesus but didn't really understand who he was not yet my teacher jesus said to her touch me not i'm not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them that i ascend to my father and your father to my god and your god mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord the master the teacher and that he had spoken these things unto her but they didn't believe her mark confirms that mary magdalene was the first to see him in mark 16 verse 9 we read now when jesus was risen early on the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had deceit of her believe not rejected her testimony they're in mourning they're sad they're downcast not recalling or perhaps choosing not to believe what he'd told them several times that he'd lay down his life and take it up again he'd be killed even to the specific death of crucifixion and he would rise from the dead on the third day after his death such a thing had never happened we read that peter and john went to the tomb they didn't see jesus or even any angels mary magdalene returned to the tomb with the other mary another gospel says and jesus appeared to the two of them and they were allowed to touch him at that time another group of women joanna with others with the anointing spices came to the tomb and saw angels but didn't see jesus it was only mary magdalene or ones that were accompanying mary magdalene that saw jesus that morning if you were not with mary magdalene that morning you did not see the risen lord jesus what an honor what a recognition of faith and how hurtful to be disbelieved by those you'd walked with for so many months across so many miles those who knew you how could they doubt you about something so momentous what rejection isolation humiliation you're just distraught deer none of the brothers saw him here have a cup of tea it'll soothe you well let's move on to that afternoon again back to emmaus the road where we started this evening luke 24 we'll we'll start again at verse 19. jesus said unto them what things they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty indeed in word before god and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done and then they continued the narrative and yeah and certain women also of our company made us astonish which were early at the sepulcher we've moved up from three days ago the events that have made them sad to that very morning and when they found nada's body they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive as you can see the story has changed just a little bit here that's how it happens and you repeat things to people and repeat things and certain of them which were with us which we know were peter and john went to the sepulcher and found that even as the women had said but they didn't see him this point jesus has had quite enough he said unto them o fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ who have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them and all the scriptures the things concerning himself don't you find it striking what the two were telling jesus he asked them what happened why are you so sad and they talked about the arrest and the crucifixion and the death of this prophet who they thought was the messiah but sadly apparently he wasn't he was dead you see they were sad because they were looking at the cross and not accepting not realizing what the cross meant because they didn't really understand who jesus was they didn't understand who jesus is so on that day of days they were reflecting on his death not his life and then what then they told him the testimony of the women regarding the empty tomb that some of the brothers had gone to verify and saw the empty tomb but didn't see jesus if jesus were really risen he would have appeared to peter and john when they went with mary she must have been distraught emotional it's all just too much for her poor mary so they discounted the testimony of the women even though they heard testimony from reliable witnesses of his resurrection they refused to believe it not too surprising i guess such a thing had never happened but if they only held jesus to be a prophet just a guy with a special gift they could discount the reports that they said left them astonished but as i said at this point jesus had had quite enough so he upgraded them he scolded them for rejecting both the testimony of the women and thus of his own foretelling of the very thing that the women's testimony confirmed when they rejected their lady's testimony they were rejecting jesus own testimony about himself he then led them through the scriptures patiently instructing and teaching not holding a king james bible and going from page to page not reaching into somebody's backpack and pulling out a scroll and reading it not doing a search on the internet but reciting from memory that's how they knew the scriptures in that day he led them through it all reminded them of things written of the messiah he could do this with them because they were devout jews they had committed many portions of the bible of their day to memory they were familiar with the word they might not have understood it after they realized who we was we know the story they ran back several miles to jerusalem and knew exactly where to find the disciples who were hiding referred to as the eleven as they were exchanging these stories thomas apparently left the assembly because we're told elsewhere that when jesus appeared thomas was absent let's read carefully what happened next luke 24 verse 36 and as they cleophus and his companion thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you hebrew shalom they were terrified and affrighted supposedly they had seen a spirit it wasn't wow jesus it's true you're alive it's ah what's happening he said unto them why are you troubled why do thoughts arise in your hand and your hearts and he said behold my hands my feet it's i myself handle me and see touch me a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones as you see me have and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered this isn't the modern i wonder if that's really true but this is the wonder as in awe amazement astonishment in other words they're so overcome with joy that they can hardly believe their senses they're just amazed in john 20 20 it says they were glad notice they didn't believe it was him until he showed them his wounds he said unto them have you hear any meat they gave him a piece of broiled fish honeycomb he took it he ate it he said these are the words that i spake unto you i told you about this beforehand don't you remember while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures i suspect for cleopas and his and his partner who i originally thought might have been named eor but i don't think so anymore that the two of those that had just come from emmaus it must have seemed like a replay jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father but by me why because he is the father we just read that in isaiah and according to his own testimony to the jewish leaders i and my father are one but they they still didn't understand that at least we have no record of any of them saying they did they would make such a declaration on the day of pentecost some 50 days later but not then john's account starts out the same john 20 verse 19 then the same day and evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you shalom allah and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad a bit of an understatement after what we just read in luke when they were glad when they saw the lord and again this version of the word lord does not necessarily imply deity so here again we're told they're glad they're full of joy when they see him but there's no declaration of the revelation of who he really was that they really understood in fact in the first chapter of acts they're asking him if he's going to restore israel at that time you're going to kick the romans out now the then current perspective they still had in their head about what the messiah would do but let's let's read on let's get down to verse 24. we read but thomas one of the twelve called didymus did he miss means twin we don't know if he had a twin sibling or maybe he was a lookalike to one of the disciples maybe he was a look-alike to jesus we don't know but thomas was not with them when jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord the same testimony that they had rejected of the women they are now giving to jesus or giving to thomas but but he said to them except i shall see in his hands are printed the nails and put my finger in the front of the nails and thus my hand into his side i will not believe i want the same experience you had he was still skeptical for whatever reasons and he's asking for the same thing that jesus had offered okay after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas was with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you shalom allah this is exactly the same set up as it happened eight days earlier then saith he to thomas because he had already said it to the others reach hither thy finger behold my hands reach hither thy hand thrust into my side be not faithless but believing the same thing that he had said to the others eight days earlier and look at thomas's response thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god and my god deity thomas had a revelation and understood at that moment who jesus really was not just a messiah an anointed prophet but god himself no record that he touched jesus maybe he did only that he proclaimed that jesus was more than a teacher a prophet or god's unique son that he was in fact god himself thomas was a jew he had been taught from birth that there is but one god and this is the first time in the gospel accounts that any of the disciples called jesus god the first time that any disciple called jesus deity jesus said unto him thomas because you've seen me you've believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed blessed are they that will accept the word of the testimony it seems that thomas one of the disciples we hear almost nothing about other than his name was likely the first to realize and actually comprehend who jesus was he's mostly known for his doubt we speak of doubting thomas and not his declaration brother branham used him as an example of a person who needs a sign or something other than the word to believe and have faith this was eight days after the resurrection it was 42 days before pentecost my lord and my god it was personal my lord and my god making it very clear that when thomas saw the risen lord jesus he realized he was in the presence of jehovah peter would later preach it paul would later persecute anyone making that very declaration then go on to declare it himself preaching with the same zeal that he had previously persecuted with now you may argue and say no no no peter really had the full understanding of his resolution revelation of who jesus was before thomas or that all the other nine did after jesus taught them the first time that he appeared and you may be correct but the real point the really important thing is if you individually like peter and like thomas have not just a revelation but the revelation and understanding of the revelation of who jesus is and that you have entered into a right relationship with jesus christ the very god that created all things very few people even among christians recognized that jesus was god in flesh not one-third of a committee of three beings the same one who walked in the garden with adam and eve who wrestled with jacob spoke with moses met with abraham time and again appeared in the old testament in forms we call theophanies the musicians would please come at this time thank you hebrews 13 8 tells us that jesus christ is the same we're told elsewhere that god does not change that jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new that the holy spirit is the indwelling christ in us as temples his body on earth do we really understand that not just to repeat it or say it or claim it as a revelation but do we really grasp christ in us the hope of glory is a portion of the god that created this universe that he loved us as a tiny portion of his vast creation to the point that he demonstrated that love to us by sacrificing himself as a human to remove not cover but obliterate our sin and restore fellowship relationship with him we read some this evening about mary magdalene how her testimony was rejected how it must have hurt her having taken such a personal risk to go to the tomb that morning how must jesus feel if we reject his testimony his gift to us provided at such personal cost i'd like us to to pray together one more time lord jesus we thank you for your word lord and i pray that each of us myself included would have a true grasp a true understanding of the revelation of who you are and lord that we all would have such a relationship with you that we can walk with you and talk with you that you will guide us that you will lead us we can depend on it not be fearful like the disciples what manner of man is this but we know what manner of man this is lord i thank you for this time that we could share together lord i just pray that you'd help your word to sink deep in our hearts to take root and to grow we love you lord jesus we love you
