[8:53] forever amen you may be seated
[8:57] we have some requests some prayer
[8:59] requests too
[9:00] you bring your attention and just a few
[9:03] things here
[9:05] my daughter Elizabeth had asked to be
[9:08] remembered in prayer after the two
[9:11] extractions and she went through the
[9:13] prayer line and began to heal but
[9:15] he felt like she got a cold so she's
[9:17] struggling breathing and all and Aston
[9:21] and then the Vogel family
[9:23] um I got a text from Brother Renee
[9:25] yesterday Brother Gary had been on life
[9:27] support and the family chose to to
[9:30] disconnect him yesterday so sometime
[9:33] yesterday afternoon Brother Gary passed
[9:35] away passed over to the other side so
[9:38] we're remembering the Vogel family
[9:41] and bro I was talking with brother Dan
[9:43] here and I just brought back to memory
[9:47] the Vogel family had been here many
[9:49] years ago and then they they had gone
[9:52] and brother Renee and sister Trish they
[9:55] were they were she was pregnant with the
[9:57] child and the possibility of losing that
[10:00] child
[10:01] and Trish told Renee
[10:03] said he used to go to a church that
[10:05] believes in prayer and healing and they
[10:07] came to be prayed for
[10:09] I didn't know that Renee had been raised
[10:12] right down the street his mother lived
[10:13] there I didn't know that at the time
[10:14] from us
[10:16] but that's brought the Vogel family back
[10:19] to serving the lord so
[10:22] until Brother Gary has gone on so they
[10:24] really asked us to remember them in
[10:26] prayer
[10:28] and a text from Brother Peter this
[10:30] morning and they are in Connecticut with
[10:32] brother Craig brewer today so hoping to
[10:35] be in Boston tomorrow but if they've had
[10:37] a good journey
[10:39] and I asked the brother Al Peterson and
[10:42] them and brother Arnie I'm sorry
[10:45] yesterday was a memorial family had the
[10:48] memorial for brother Al
[10:50] and I just want to pay my respects back
[10:52] to
[10:53] to brother Al
[10:55] and the Peterson Family
[10:57] I asked brother Dan I asked the family
[10:59] that I'd be okay this morning
[11:01] I was just a young man had just started
[11:04] attending the Tabernacle my early 30s
[11:08] where the hell Peterson asked myself and
[11:09] brother Jerry McFadden
[11:11] to help just greeting the people and
[11:14] ushering and
[11:15] and we did that
[11:18] and then about six months later brother
[11:20] Jerry
[11:21] asked Brother Ali said could I go back
[11:23] and sit down and help Mama with the
[11:25] children and brother Al said you do that
[11:28] brother Jerry
[11:29] so I said brother Al I have more
[11:31] children than he does so maybe I should
[11:33] go help
[11:34] and brother Al said no brother and you
[11:36] stay back here with me
[11:38] and he mentored me
[11:40] I saw a living example of a Christian
[11:44] I saw how he treated people I saw how he
[11:47] acted I saw him be human and then say
[11:51] hey I'm not perfect
[11:54] didn't make excuses for it but just be a
[11:56] good Christian
[11:58] and it wasn't too long of after that
[12:00] that I asked brother Jerry I said I feel
[12:02] like I took your place
[12:04] you've been here longer you've even
[12:06] ministered
[12:07] and brother Jerry said I had a dream
[12:09] yesterday and I was asking brother bran
[12:11] I'm in the dream what should I do and
[12:13] brother brother Brown told me he said
[12:14] brother Jerry you don't speak Spanish
[12:17] and right after that the group of
[12:19] Spanish people came that would sit up
[12:20] and we would and I helped all of them so
[12:23] there were just things that happened and
[12:24] brother brother Al just was such an
[12:27] encouragement
[12:28] such a brother just just just thinking
[12:32] and I just wanted to pay tribute to that
[12:34] and you can see it in his family
[12:36] Christians that love the Lord that are
[12:38] willing to put their shoulder and
[12:40] so he's gone on to the other side
[12:44] and I pray God not too long we'll all be
[12:46] going home but I just wanted to to honor
[12:49] that if you haven't eat I know our
[12:50] sister Amelia said she's having some
[12:52] some problems with with her foot she
[12:54] said it seems like it wants to burst out
[12:56] of the
[12:57] the strap that she's wearing I said well
[13:00] maybe it just it's about getting healed
[13:02] and she's going to be walking and
[13:04] dancing and shouting how many believe
[13:06] that God is more than able to do that so

[34:18] [Music]
[34:23] I was returning I want to speak this
[34:25] morning
[34:26] on the importance of setting an example
[34:29] [Music]
[34:32] start with verse 11.
[34:37] it says you're dearly beloved I beseech
[34:39] you as strangers and pilgrims abstain
[34:42] from fleshly lusts with war against the
[34:45] soul how having your conversation honest
[34:48] among the Gentiles that whereas they
[34:51] speak against you as evildoers
[34:54] they may buy your good works which they
[34:58] Shall Behold
[34:59] glorify God in the day of visitation
[35:02] submit yourselves to every ordinance of
[35:05] man for the Lord's sake whether it be to
[35:07] the king as supreme or unto Governors as
[35:11] unto them that are sent by him for the
[35:14] punishment of evildoers and for the
[35:16] praise of them that do well
[35:19] for so is the will of God
[35:21] that with well-doing you may put to
[35:24] silence ignorance of foolish men
[35:27] as free and not using your Liberty for a
[35:30] cloak of maliciousness
[35:31] but as the Servants of God
[35:34] honor all men love the Brotherhood
[35:37] fear God and honor the king
[35:40] God bless you you can be seated may the
[35:42] Lord add the blessings to the reading of
[35:44] his word
[35:46] thank you
[35:48] um
[35:49] as I said title of my sermon is the
[35:52] importance of setting an example
[35:54] and speaking of an example brother Aaron
[35:57] mentioned this morning about brother Al
[35:58] Peterson
[35:59] a man of God passed away this week
[36:02] and brother I was a wonderful man
[36:05] he was he was precious brother uh Ed
[36:07] told me
[36:09] we were on the phone the other day and
[36:10] he said he was the best Deacon he had
[36:12] ever seen
[36:14] and um appreciate his legacy in in the
[36:17] Peterson family and all that they do for
[36:19] all of us
[36:20] and their their
[36:24] all will always willing to serve the
[36:27] body and all that they do I think that
[36:30] it's just it's a blessing
[36:33] to have known brother Al one time I was
[36:36] I was jogging
[36:37] when Stephanie and I got married we were
[36:40] living over by Sabino Canyon it was out
[36:42] running one time and this thunderstorm
[36:44] came out of nowhere
[36:46] and I was and it just started thundering
[36:49] and lightning and just pouring and This
[36:51] SUV as I was running I was a long way
[36:54] from home and This SUV pulls up in front
[36:56] of me and the door flies open
[36:58] and I jumped in and it was brother Al
[37:02] right and he said come on in it in I uh
[37:06] I'll never forget that and that's how it
[37:08] was that's that he was just he was a
[37:10] wonderful man of God
[37:12] um and precious to to so many of us
[37:17] um I'll uh
[37:20] on the calendar for the next few for the

[38:34] um
[38:34] that the church has to some decisions
[38:37] that we have to make I want to I want to
[38:38] feel I want to get a feeling how you are
[38:40] thinking for Sunday school and uh some
[38:43] other things like um some of the
[38:46] displays out there I've heard I've heard
[38:48] some comments about that
[38:50] um
[38:51] and uh just some different things I
[38:53] think it'd be a nice time of Fellowship
[38:55] and I'd like to hear what you all have
[38:58] to say I asked the church on Wednesday
[39:00] night to pray
[39:01] about those things and um so come pray
[39:06] it up and ready to have a good
[39:08] conversation about some of the
[39:09] directions that we're going to move as a
[39:11] church
[39:13] um
[39:13] I uh Daniel
[39:16] yesterday went to a I went to a
[39:19] basketball game my brother-in-law David
[39:21] he's got season tickets and he he
[39:25] couldn't go so
[39:27] um he asked me if I wanted him so I gave
[39:28] him to Daniel and he he went to this
[39:31] game and it was a big game it was the
[39:33] the two top teams in the Pac-12 and and
[39:36] everything was a big big hype and and
[39:39] you know the place was just packed and
[39:41] and there's he's sitting next to this
[39:44] old man
[39:45] who doesn't miss a game he hasn't missed
[39:48] a game for probably decades and he just
[39:51] loves U of A basketball
[39:54] and he was there and he recognized
[39:55] Daniel he'd seen Daniel before he
[39:57] recognized him and and and he's just so
[40:00] excited and he's just feeling so good
[40:03] and and the the crowds just going and
[40:06] the team's winning and he's just so
[40:08] happy and he tells Daniel he says he
[40:10] says everybody's here
[40:13] he's and he was just he was so happy and
[40:16] then the game came right down to the end
[40:19] and U of A one
[40:22] and the old man was just on top of the
[40:26] world and he just gives Daniel a big hug
[40:30] and I was thinking
[40:32] that's that man's Church
[40:36] he's so happy to see the fellowship
[40:39] and he was just he was so excited to see
[40:42] his team win
[40:45] and as Daniel's telling me the story I'm
[40:49] I'm thinking wow that's what he has
[40:53] that's his Joy
[40:55] and and I I thought about
[40:57] what if
[41:00] what if that old man
[41:02] what if he had what we have
[41:05] how he was so happy that this ridiculous
[41:09] ball game which it's like oh that's good
[41:11] you know it's nice it's It's
[41:13] Entertainment or whatever but he's he's
[41:16] happy that
[41:17] his team won
[41:19] what if he knew that our team won not
[41:24] only our team but our champion has won
[41:26] that battle
[41:28] and we can have whatever we have need of
[41:33] imagine if he just found out that he was
[41:37] healed
[41:38] or imagine if you just found out that
[41:41] the Lord Jesus died for his sins you
[41:45] talk about standing up and cheering
[41:47] that's how we should be and it's not
[41:50] about you know the ball game is fine I
[41:52] have nothing against that but it's it's
[41:54] a type of this real thing
[41:57] and I think sometime I'd like to witness
[42:00] to this old guy Daniel and talk to him
[42:02] and say you know we've got a church
[42:05] and we are happy not because that this
[42:09] team won
[42:10] but because we know the end
[42:14] and this battle will soon be over the
[42:18] greatest battle in history
[42:21] and we are going to be Victors through
[42:24] the blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[42:27] Christ
[42:28] so welcome to our visitors God bless you
[42:31] my brothers from New York here
[42:33] um brother Amos I've never met you God
[42:36] bless you my name is Peterson I saw you

[42:43] wonderful Legacy it's it's good to see

[42:49] little wife God bless you we all gave
[42:51] you a hand before welcome
[42:53] we have uh some other visitors that I
[42:55] that I don't recognize God bless you all
[42:57] and thanks for coming I pray that that
[43:01] you can that this one this Gathering
[43:04] that this is the real thing and it's not
[43:07] a ball game it doesn't matter who's
[43:09] ranked what or whatever there is one
[43:12] person that died for our sins and we are
[43:14] here to promote him
[43:16] I heard we had some we had last weekend
[43:19] was really I think it was really a
[43:23] special service we've had some
[43:25] I think we've had actually we've had a
[43:27] special week
[43:29] um the the prayer service that we had on
[43:32] Wednesday
[43:33] really encouraged me and the Lord really
[43:36] answered some of my questions and I I
[43:38] gave a little testimony after the
[43:42] service of that
[43:43] but uh let me read a testimony this one
[43:46] was from Sister Elizabeth Garrett
[43:48] brother Aaron's daughter our brother and
[43:50] his daughter
[43:52] um sister-in-law
[43:55] it says here
[43:57] good morning Saints I just wanted to
[44:00] give a testimony of God's healing power
[44:02] last Sunday in the prayer line I asked
[44:04] brother Aaron to anoint me with oil he
[44:06] anointed me but instead of praying for
[44:09] me he said to thank God for my healing
[44:12] I felt the Lord touch me I had some I
[44:16] had suffered from stomach issues since
[44:17] last November then the next morning I
[44:20] woke up completely healed
[44:23] may all the glory and honor be to our
[44:25] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[44:30] then uh my little bride here had a
[44:33] testimony too from Wednesday night and
[44:36] she was she opened up her Bible to Psalm
[44:39] 37 4.
[44:41] and it says this it says Delight thyself
[44:43] also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee
[44:46] the desires of thine heart
[44:48] so Stephanie was looking at that
[44:50] scripture and
[44:51] and like we should we shouldn't just
[44:53] read over a scripture and not understand
[44:55] it we should get the meaning behind it
[44:58] and she said Lord how do I Delight
[45:00] myself
[45:03] in the Lord
[45:04] what does that mean
[45:06] to really Delight myself
[45:10] in the Lord
[45:12] so she looked at her Bible and there was
[45:15] a there was a note in the margin
[45:18] and it said Isaiah 58 14.
[45:22] and so she went to Isaiah 58 14 and and
[45:26] she actually went back to 58 13 and she
[45:30] started reading and it reads like this
[45:34] if thou turn away thy foot from the
[45:37] Sabbath
[45:38] which
[45:40] more Modern English it says if you keep
[45:43] your feet from breaking the Sabbath
[45:47] from doing thy pleasure on my holy day
[45:50] and call the Sabbath a delight
[45:53] the holy of the Lord
[45:55] honorable and shall honor him
[45:59] not doing thine own ways nor finding
[46:02] thine own pleasure nor speaking thine
[46:05] own words
[46:07] he's talking about honoring the Sabbath
[46:08] I think he's talking about going to
[46:10] church here and if you're not thinking
[46:13] about doing your own thing on Sunday
[46:15] going going over here going doing going
[46:18] shopping or watching the ball games or
[46:20] doing this or that but if you honor this
[46:24] and you go into the house of the Lord
[46:29] then Thou shalt Delight thyself in the
[46:32] Lord
[46:33] and I will cause thee to write upon the
[46:35] high places of the earth and feed thee
[46:37] with the heritage of Jacob thy father
[46:39] for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it
[46:43] and and Stephanie was all excited after
[46:45] our Wednesday night service and she said
[46:47] honey
[46:48] she said and she gave me that testimony
[46:49] she said it's really he's talking about
[46:52] going to church and it Delights the Lord
[46:55] that we would make a sacrifice and not
[46:59] do our own things on this special day
[47:01] but we would come into the house of the
[47:03] Lord it Delights him and then we will
[47:06] receive the benefits from it
[47:10] so I was given merely that testimony
[47:13] last night my mother-in-law I was
[47:15] telling her I was telling her all this
[47:17] that that Stephanie had said and merely
[47:20] is writing a she's writing a card to one
[47:24] of her grandkids
[47:25] a birthday card
[47:27] and she says Dan look at this and on the
[47:32] birthday card it was Psalm 37 4. Delight
[47:36] thyself also in the Lord and He Shall
[47:38] give Thee the desires of thy heart amen
[47:40] so a little bit of confirmation God's
[47:43] timing is perfect a little bit of
[47:46] confirmation that hey if you delight
[47:48] yourself in the Lord in these things of
[47:51] God then he will return those blessings
[47:55] brother Lyle you have a you have a
[47:57] testimony also right do you want uh do
[47:59] you want to come up you want me to bring
[48:00] your microphone down why don't you why
[48:02] don't you come up
[48:13] good morning
[48:16] you know Psalms 105 6.
[48:19] says let everything that hath breath
[48:22] praise the Lord amen praise ye the Lord
[48:24] I turn in a prayer request Wednesday
[48:26] evening starting off with that Psalm the
[48:29] last couple of months I've had a an
[48:31] issue where I have shortness of breath
[48:33] and I get easily fatigued I I never used
[48:36] to take naps in the daytime but starting
[48:38] a couple of months ago I I got something
[48:40] that I call s-o-n-s the Suns it means
[48:43] sudden onset napping syndrome that's
[48:47] that's just one that I made up but but
[48:49] I've I've had this issue of just doing
[48:52] not much and feeling really fatigued
[48:55] afterwards well I I was at the
[48:57] cardiologist and of course the
[48:59] cardiologist sees everything to the lens
[49:01] of the heart so on Friday morning I went
[49:04] in for uh to to see I told the nurse
[49:08] show that I'm here to see nurse Angie
[49:10] and she looked at me and I said the
[49:12] Irish nurse angiogram and it took her a
[49:15] while to understand that I meant I was
[49:16] there for an angiogram but so anyway so
[49:19] I went into this procedure and and the
[49:21] car cardiologist is the same one that
[49:24] had done a procedure on me four years
[49:27] ago almost exactly it was an early 2019
[49:30] and had noted a few things in my heart
[49:32] this and that well they went in they
[49:35] didn't find any problem with my heart
[49:37] I want to say that again they didn't
[49:40] find any problem in fact he said
[49:45] that when he went in that everything
[49:48] looked exactly
[49:50] as it had four years ago now if you know
[49:52] anything about coronary artery disease
[49:54] and all that it's a progressive disease
[49:56] they they put in stents they do things
[49:58] and then a few years later they go in
[50:00] and things a little more clogged and
[50:01] they put in some more stents and and
[50:03] then after a while then they get out
[50:04] their skill saw and they start doing
[50:06] bypass surgeries because it's a chronic
[50:09] ongoing thing my brother-in-law is a
[50:11] physician and he was telling me the same
[50:13] thing well when they go in there you
[50:14] know they're going to find this and
[50:16] they're going to find out no they didn't
[50:17] find that because God healed my heart I
[50:20] gave that testimony in April of 2018
[50:23] where I I'd had the heart attack in uh
[50:27] in November of uh 2017 Thanksgiving week
[50:30] and and I was running at 62 percent of a
[50:34] heart after that and then one Wednesday
[50:36] night here the Lord touched me and and
[50:39] as I've said many times people don't
[50:41] want to sit too close to me anymore not
[50:43] because I sing and I don't run out of
[50:44] breath so they have to listen to me and
[50:46] they want to move a little further back
[50:48] but but the the the real Point here the
[50:51] real testimony isn't isn't about fatigue
[50:54] and stuff we're still trying to figure
[50:55] out what's causing all that but the
[50:58] testimony is that the Lord healed my
[51:00] heart he doesn't do a halfway job he
[51:03] healed it it still healed there's still
[51:05] nothing wrong with my heart it's exactly
[51:07] the same as it was four years ago
[51:09] there's nothing wrong with my coronary
[51:11] arteries they're exactly as they were
[51:13] four years ago God is faithful we just
[51:16] have to trust the Lord and that's my
[51:19] testimony God bless you
[51:22] thank you very much
[51:24] [Applause]
[51:26] that ain't the Arizona Wildcats
[51:29] that's the real deal
[51:32] the Lord Jesus is alive today we had
[51:36] prayer on Wednesday night for brother
[51:37] Lyle Island and I I was given a
[51:39] testimony about her brother I was so
[51:41] tired he was he was fatigued but he was
[51:44] the one that knew how to put up this
[51:46] tent back here for Harmony and he didn't
[51:49] complain he just went out there and I
[51:50] was noticing he was his shoulders were a
[51:52] little slumped and and I asked him and
[51:55] and he told me that he was struggling
[51:58] with what he was struggling with
[52:00] and uh and then we had prayer Wednesday
[52:04] night with a while and thank the Lord
[52:06] you know we serve
[52:09] a god
[52:11] that says that Jesus Christ is the same
[52:14] yesterday today and forever amen has
[52:18] anybody else have any testimonies about
[52:21] about Sunday on the prayer line or
[52:23] Wednesday
[52:25] the the
[52:27] um
[52:27] the prayer service that we had
[52:30] I know of her
[52:31] I'll bring you a microphone how's that
[52:33] sound
[52:36] Amos come here could you could you run
[52:38] this back for me
[52:45] thank you my brother all the way to the
[52:47] back back there
[52:59] maybe future deacons here
[53:02] maybe even ministers
[53:05] thank you brother Amos
[53:08] stay there
[53:10] I'm gonna need that back
[53:12] so Sunday when we had the prayer line I
[53:17] I well I don't really have anything I
[53:18] want prayer for I mean pressing but then
[53:21] I thought
[53:22] I'm going to go up and support the
[53:24] church I'm going to pray for continued
[53:26] unity and love that's going to be my
[53:28] request
[53:29] so I did that and held out on my heart
[53:31] but as I got
[53:32] to the closer to the light I had been
[53:36] for weeks now waking every
[53:38] up every morning around between 5 5 30
[53:42] with a really nervous stomach just
[53:45] horribly nervous to wear I just didn't
[53:47] know what to do you just get so just
[53:49] awful anyway as I got closer I just put
[53:52] my hand over my stomach and I just held
[53:55] it there I didn't ask the Lord didn't
[53:57] say anything and then my dad anointed me
[54:00] with oil and I went through the line
[54:01] held my hand over my stomach without
[54:04] thinking about it
[54:05] and the next morning I woke up and I
[54:09] woke up past the time I'd been waking up
[54:11] every morning for several weeks and I
[54:14] looked over at Stephen and I said it's
[54:16] gone amen I don't have any more nervous
[54:18] stomach and I've been sleeping in every
[54:20] morning past that time without that
[54:23] horrible feeling it's completely gone
[54:25] amen thank the Lord
[54:32] I see any more hands about this week
[54:36] right here we have two good uh sister
[54:39] Naomi first and then come over to Sister
[54:42] Amelia
[54:44] well mine isn't necessarily about Sunday
[54:47] or Wednesday but I had told myself that
[54:50] if they asked for any Praises I would
[54:53] give it thank you so I work at Pima
[54:56] college at the west campus and Thursday
[54:57] was the first day of school for the
[55:00] semester and we had an incident where
[55:02] the school had to go on lockdown for
[55:03] about half an hour
[55:05] so
[55:07] um we shut down the bookstore because
[55:08] that's where I work and we brought
[55:10] everybody that was in there the
[55:11] employees as well as
[55:13] um any students to the very back room
[55:17] um it's mostly secure they have we have
[55:20] a really high window like we do here in
[55:21] the church
[55:23] and um I was fine these incidents
[55:26] thankfully never turn into anything
[55:28] serious but one of the ladies that we
[55:31] brought back there was very very nervous
[55:32] and she was trying to find the corners
[55:34] trying to hide and stuff so I told her
[55:38] okay this will be the best place for you
[55:39] to hide and I positioned her directly
[55:41] underneath the window
[55:43] and that morning when I was getting my
[55:46] lunch ready I grabbed four bags of chips
[55:49] they're just small little leaves
[55:51] different flavors
[55:53] and one of the flavors that was
[55:54] available it's actually
[55:57] um Smart Food popcorn and I don't care
[56:00] for it but I just like I'm just gonna
[56:02] take it anyway if I get really desperate
[56:04] and hungry I'll eat it
[56:06] so while we're locked in the back room
[56:08] this lady asked does anybody have any
[56:11] popcorn
[56:12] and I look at her and like what kind of
[56:16] popcorn thinking she meant like
[56:17] microwavable popcorn
[56:19] it's just like you know like the
[56:20] pre-popped kind the kind that's already
[56:22] made
[56:23] and I was like oh I I do actually he's
[56:25] like you do yes I do so I bring it out
[56:29] and I give it to her and it helped her
[56:31] calm down and she ate it and stuff I
[56:33] pass out the rest of my chips but it
[56:35] didn't hit me until I was going home
[56:37] that night that that is why I took the
[56:39] popcorn amen because the Lord already
[56:41] knew amen he's the god of the big things
[56:44] he's the god of the little things too
[56:46] praise the Lord
[56:49] bless you Sister Amelia
[56:51] I had a few oops sorry I had a few uh
[56:55] prayer requests on my mind when I went
[56:56] to the line
[56:58] and uh towards the end there was
[57:00] Brothers there that I really didn't know
[57:02] towards the end of the line um uh this
[57:06] brother
[57:07] um I don't think I knew him he started
[57:09] praying for me for asking um he said uh
[57:13] prayers for this mother for the
[57:15] Salvation of her sons and daughters and
[57:18] grandchildren I said how does his
[57:20] brother he doesn't know me and I I
[57:23] thought well maybe maybe brother it was
[57:27] brother Lyle because he was right close
[57:30] to him and uh so I mentioned it to him
[57:33] and he said you know of course he just
[57:34] said no they have a children and
[57:37] grandchildren and but uh that's what the
[57:40] brother prayed for and that was one of
[57:41] my prayer requests and that's my prayer
[57:44] uh prayer to God every day and so I was
[57:47] really really blessed with that prayer
[57:50] amen there was a sister one time
[57:53] that
[57:55] she had that same prayer
[57:58] brother Branham
[57:59] was as you know he was squirrel hunting
[58:02] and this little lady named Hattie Wright
[58:06] she said the right thing
[58:09] and then
[58:11] brother Branham said ask anything what
[58:14] you said please the Lord ask anything
[58:17] and it'll be given to you
[58:20] and she said I'd like to have the
[58:22] salvation of my two boys
[58:24] and that is when the spirit of the Lord
[58:26] came down and brother Brown liking that
[58:29] to the third pole
[58:30] powerful powerful situation sister
[58:33] Amelia the same thing we can't ask for
[58:36] anything greater than that
[58:38] God bless you all that's the um like I
[58:41] said this past week was was special
[58:43] special to me I am
[58:47] all of this you know if we we Delight
[58:49] ourselves in the Lord then he will he
[58:51] will meet these needs
[58:53] and
[58:55] we set an example
[58:58] for the world like this old man that was
[59:00] at that ball game
[59:02] he was so excited he was so happy
[59:05] because these people that he liked to be
[59:07] around were there
[59:10] and and the team won and just
[59:14] I guess you can't say it praising the
[59:16] Lord but just up and shouting and
[59:17] jumping
[59:19] and it's like Lord
[59:22] but there's a real
[59:25] there is a real church here
[59:30] there is something that our healing can
[59:34] come like brother Lyle our Salvation can
[59:38] come
[59:39] our
[59:40] even little things sister Naomi that the
[59:43] Lord just tells us I'm with you
[59:46] you know these little love letters
[59:48] you know with sister Elizabeth and her
[59:50] healing of her stomach and and
[59:53] um
[59:53] the the different things that happen God
[59:58] you're with us
[1:00:00] and we want to worship you and we want
[1:00:04] to cheer for you Lord Jesus because you
[1:00:07] are great you are the champion this
[1:00:10] isn't a three-pointer or a slam dunk
[1:00:12] this is the end of ends this is this is
[1:00:16] the Alpha and the Omega
[1:00:18] so in my sermon today I want to talk
[1:00:20] about like I said the importance of
[1:00:22] setting example
[1:00:24] and I want to take my text
[1:00:27] from second chronicles as we read in
[1:00:30] Peter about how important that these
[1:00:33] examples are
[1:00:34] but in second chronicles we see the
[1:00:39] influence
[1:00:40] of a man that is dear to my heart
[1:00:45] and he's a man that you've probably
[1:00:46] never heard of
[1:00:48] he was a priest
[1:00:50] and he lived in the time
[1:00:53] just after Ahab came
[1:00:57] and he had a very special wife also and
[1:01:01] this man's name was jehoiada
[1:01:04] and he had a very special family and he
[1:01:10] was a great influence on all of the
[1:01:14] tribe of Judah
[1:01:16] and God blessed that whole Kingdom just
[1:01:20] because of this one man he wasn't the
[1:01:22] prophet
[1:01:23] he wasn't even I don't even know if he
[1:01:25] was a high priest he was a good man that
[1:01:29] God had his hand on and I think all of
[1:01:32] us can relate to this man and I don't
[1:01:35] know if I'll get all the way I have two
[1:01:37] sermons today so I can pick it up
[1:01:39] tonight if I don't get all the way to
[1:01:41] the jehoiah and his ministry
[1:01:43] but I want to lay a foundation of what
[1:01:46] was happening at that time
[1:01:48] now we we read in Chronicles and Kings
[1:01:52] these two books they tell basically the
[1:01:55] same stories they just have different
[1:01:57] authors it's kind of like Matthew Mark
[1:01:59] Luke and John they're different
[1:02:01] perspectives on the same things that
[1:02:04] have happened
[1:02:05] now we start with this King Saul who was
[1:02:08] the first king of Israel and then we go
[1:02:11] to David and then we go to Solomon and
[1:02:15] the those three kings we have a united
[1:02:18] front in Israel we have these 12 tribes
[1:02:22] and they're all together but what
[1:02:24] happened after Solomon died
[1:02:28] was sin entered into this Israel and it
[1:02:34] split into two different countries one
[1:02:38] country was called Judah and that's
[1:02:40] where Jerusalem was and that had two
[1:02:42] tribes that had Judah and it had
[1:02:44] Benjamin and then the other tribe the
[1:02:47] other country was Israel the capital of
[1:02:51] Israel was Samaria and that had the
[1:02:53] other ten tribes
[1:02:55] so so we have these two sometimes they
[1:02:57] got along sometimes they didn't
[1:02:59] and as time went on
[1:03:03] um
[1:03:04] there came Kings
[1:03:08] throughout history and if you look you
[1:03:12] see Judah and you see Israel going side
[1:03:15] by side Judah had some good Kings
[1:03:18] Judah had like ASA and Jehoshaphat and
[1:03:21] and Hezekiah they had some good ones
[1:03:23] they had a lot of bad ones Israel never
[1:03:27] had a good King
[1:03:29] after Solomon died there was never a
[1:03:32] good king after that
[1:03:35] so whenever you see when you're looking
[1:03:37] at the Kings and you say I wonder if he
[1:03:39] was Judah or Israel if he was good he
[1:03:41] was never Israel it was Judah
[1:03:43] so these we see that the lineage coming
[1:03:47] down and we see that this man named Ahab
[1:03:53] came on the scene a very evil man
[1:03:58] and and this is in Israel
[1:04:01] Ahab married someone that was outside of
[1:04:05] his faith
[1:04:06] and that was this woman named Jezebel we
[1:04:09] all know who these people were
[1:04:13] they um
[1:04:15] and then as Ahab and Jezebel are
[1:04:18] governing over here in Israel then there
[1:04:20] was a righteous King named Judah
[1:04:24] that was governing I'm sorry named
[1:04:26] Jehoshaphat that was governing over in
[1:04:28] Judah good man prayed when he made
[1:04:32] decisions
[1:04:34] and
[1:04:35] so they were they were running side by
[1:04:38] side and they interacted and
[1:04:41] jehoshaphat's son when Jehoshaphat died
[1:04:45] his son took over and this man's name
[1:04:48] was jehorah
[1:04:50] and he was he became the king of Judah
[1:04:54] he married
[1:04:57] Ahab and Jezebel's daughter
[1:05:01] Wicked woman named athaliah
[1:05:05] so
[1:05:06] they uh they were they were together
[1:05:09] and we we see that durum johoram let's
[1:05:15] let's go ahead and read it let's go to
[1:05:17] um II Chronicles chapter 21.
[1:05:22] we'll start with verse four
[1:05:28] now when joram was risen up to the
[1:05:30] kingdom of his father he strengthened
[1:05:32] himself and slew all his Brethren with
[1:05:34] the sword and divers also of the princes
[1:05:38] of Israel
[1:05:39] johoram was 30 and 2 years old when he
[1:05:41] began to Reign and he reigned eight
[1:05:43] years in Jerusalem
[1:05:46] and he walked in the ways of the Kings
[1:05:48] of Israel now remember he was king of
[1:05:51] Judah
[1:05:52] and he walked in the way of the Kings of
[1:05:54] Israel like as did the house of Ahab
[1:05:59] for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife
[1:06:02] and he wrote that which was evil
[1:06:05] in the eyes of the Lord look at the
[1:06:08] influence that his wife had on him this
[1:06:11] woman athaliah
[1:06:12] Jerome's dad as I said was a good man
[1:06:15] and righteous but this woman comes in
[1:06:17] and she loved the things of the world
[1:06:21] she took after her mama Jezebel she was
[1:06:24] a murderer as you know
[1:06:27] and
[1:06:29] it goes to show
[1:06:32] this man johoram probably wasn't a very
[1:06:34] strong man in his faith it goes to show
[1:06:37] how important it is who we marry
[1:06:42] and what spouse we choose whether
[1:06:44] whether we be a young lady and we're
[1:06:46] choosing a husband or a young man and
[1:06:48] we're choosing a wife
[1:06:50] because this influence that we have on
[1:06:53] us it could completely ruin our lives
[1:06:57] it could end up in divorce it could end
[1:07:00] up in in just complete misery
[1:07:05] or for some of us
[1:07:08] it could just end up in joy
[1:07:10] end up that we have this soul mate that
[1:07:13] God gave us this person to share our
[1:07:16] life with us and to and to give us
[1:07:19] strength also
[1:07:21] but joram jehoram he never served the
[1:07:24] Lord let's go to verse 11.
[1:07:27] moreover he made the high places in the
[1:07:29] mountains of Juna Judah and caused the
[1:07:32] inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit
[1:07:34] fornication
[1:07:36] and compelled Judah there too
[1:07:41] so we see jehoram
[1:07:43] he builds these idols and what he does
[1:07:47] is he encourages
[1:07:51] this immorality
[1:07:53] among the people in his country
[1:07:57] he encourages these and it sounds bad
[1:08:01] but it's not preached enough
[1:08:03] he encourages
[1:08:07] marital relations before marriage
[1:08:10] and we see that in the world today we
[1:08:12] see it we see it everywhere that it's
[1:08:15] it's encouraging this immorality among
[1:08:17] our young people
[1:08:19] and they're not told they're not taught
[1:08:22] against it
[1:08:23] it used to be in the schools that they
[1:08:25] would teach against it now they teach
[1:08:27] for it
[1:08:28] they encourage this in in with our youth
[1:08:31] in in their schools and where they they
[1:08:34] go to learn
[1:08:36] and this was this johoram he encouraged
[1:08:40] this type of thing in his country
[1:08:43] and it ended up ruining Judah
[1:08:49] he uh
[1:08:51] if
[1:08:53] let me say a little bit about the Bible
[1:08:55] here when we see the word fornication it
[1:08:58] generally means marital relations before
[1:09:01] you're married
[1:09:02] when we see the word adultery it means
[1:09:05] those same relations with someone other
[1:09:07] than your spouse
[1:09:08] so that's the difference between
[1:09:10] fornication and adultery and johoram
[1:09:15] encouraged these things and he encourage
[1:09:17] sin
[1:09:19] in his country aside from what his
[1:09:22] righteous father taught the taught the
[1:09:25] people he encouraged this sin so
[1:09:28] Elijah's a prophet he's still on the
[1:09:30] scene when we see jehoram here
[1:09:33] and he writes him a letter
[1:09:35] and he basically says you're a creep
[1:09:40] don't try to search creep in your Bible
[1:09:42] I probably won't find that part but he
[1:09:45] does
[1:09:46] and Elijah lays the ax here to the root
[1:09:48] of the tree and he says you've made
[1:09:51] Judah to walk in the ways of Israel
[1:09:55] not the ways of Your Righteous father
[1:09:57] Jehoshaphat or Your Righteous Grandpa
[1:10:00] this other guy named ASA this other king
[1:10:02] another good man
[1:10:05] and he killed
[1:10:07] when when he took the when he took the
[1:10:10] kingdom
[1:10:11] this man johoram ends up killing all of
[1:10:14] the other seed
[1:10:15] so he wouldn't have any competition
[1:10:18] and Elijah calls him out he said he says
[1:10:20] you taught Judah to fall into the traps
[1:10:23] of the world like Israel did
[1:10:25] you have killed your brethren and he
[1:10:28] said because of this
[1:10:30] I'm going to bring sickness God's going
[1:10:32] to bring sickness onto the land
[1:10:35] and you're going to die of that sickness
[1:10:37] too
[1:10:39] so johar did as the prophet said johoram
[1:10:41] got sick and he died he died a terrible
[1:10:44] death
[1:10:45] and the the in fact the leaders of
[1:10:47] Jerusalem saw what a bad man this was
[1:10:49] and they wouldn't even bury him
[1:10:52] with the Kings his fathers they buried
[1:10:55] him in a place that was set aside
[1:10:57] because he was not even worthy to be in
[1:10:59] the same ground as they were
[1:11:02] we go
[1:11:04] to Second Chronicles
[1:11:06] 22
[1:11:08] and let's read let's let's start with
[1:11:10] verse 1.
[1:11:13] and the inhabitants now now he and this
[1:11:15] woman athalia
[1:11:17] now johoram's dead he dies he dies from
[1:11:20] this disease and his wife this daughter
[1:11:23] of Jezebel and Ahab
[1:11:25] is still there
[1:11:28] and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made a
[1:11:30] hazia
[1:11:32] his youngest son King in his Stead for
[1:11:35] the band of men came with the Arabians
[1:11:37] to the camp and had slain all the eldest
[1:11:40] so ahasia the son of johoram King of
[1:11:43] Judah reigned 40 and two years was
[1:11:45] ahasia when he began to Reign and he
[1:11:48] reigned one year in Jerusalem and his
[1:11:50] mother's name also was athaliah the
[1:11:53] daughter of Omri now it's
[1:11:57] sometimes when the Bible talks when it
[1:11:59] says a daughter or a son it's not
[1:12:01] talking about the direct descendant it's
[1:12:03] talking about a descendant like Jesus
[1:12:05] the son of David and that's that's why
[1:12:08] it doesn't actually disagree with each
[1:12:10] other it actually lines up perfect
[1:12:13] he also walked in the ways of the House
[1:12:15] of Ahab for his mother was his counselor
[1:12:19] to do wickedly
[1:12:21] wherefore he did evil on the sight of
[1:12:23] the Lord like the house of Ahab for they
[1:12:26] were his counselors after the death of
[1:12:30] his father
[1:12:31] to his destruction
[1:12:33] and remember I'm talking about here
[1:12:35] setting a good example and how important
[1:12:38] it is and how important these examples
[1:12:40] are his example was his mom and his dad
[1:12:45] and he learned these these behaviors he
[1:12:50] learned that from watching his parents
[1:12:52] one time I was I was praying
[1:12:55] and I was I read I read a scripture
[1:12:59] um and I believe it was in Deuteronomy
[1:13:02] and it said something to the effect of I
[1:13:06] will visit the sins of the parents upon
[1:13:09] the children
[1:13:12] and I didn't understand that
[1:13:14] and remember when we're reading our
[1:13:16] Bible friends don't just read over it
[1:13:18] and go to the next verse
[1:13:20] if there's something that you don't
[1:13:22] understand there it's very important I
[1:13:24] believe the Lord would want us to
[1:13:26] understand even if it's just one
[1:13:28] sentence more than reading in a whole
[1:13:31] chapter and not understanding what we
[1:13:32] read
[1:13:33] so pause on those things that you don't
[1:13:36] understand and I was I was reading that
[1:13:38] and I said Lord I know that later on it
[1:13:40] says that that it was unlawful to punish
[1:13:44] the children for the crimes of the
[1:13:48] parents but here it says that I will
[1:13:53] visit
[1:13:54] the sins or the iniquities of the
[1:13:56] parents upon the children
[1:13:58] I didn't understand that
[1:14:00] and I was on my knees and I was praying
[1:14:03] and I said Lord it doesn't seem fair
[1:14:07] and I know there's many things in the
[1:14:08] Bible it's not us to decide what's fair
[1:14:10] and what's not God is just
[1:14:13] but I was reading and I said Lord I
[1:14:14] don't understand it doesn't seem fair
[1:14:17] maybe I don't understand this how can
[1:14:20] the sins how can I suffer
[1:14:23] how can I be punished for something that
[1:14:25] my mom or my dad did
[1:14:28] I was praying about it
[1:14:31] and I feel like I spoke about hearing
[1:14:34] God's voice a couple weeks ago
[1:14:37] and I feel felt that still Small Voice
[1:14:41] speak to me
[1:14:43] and it said this
[1:14:45] it said because they are taught that way
[1:14:50] oh
[1:14:52] so we're not being punished for
[1:14:55] something our parents did we learn that
[1:14:58] behavior
[1:15:00] and then we go and we do the same
[1:15:04] behavior because that's how we've grown
[1:15:05] up
[1:15:06] that's that's what we've learned how to
[1:15:08] do and then we commit the same sin and
[1:15:12] then yes we will be punished for that
[1:15:15] same sin
[1:15:16] and I look at this this ahasia
[1:15:20] and look at the example
[1:15:23] that he learned from
[1:15:25] with athaliah this Wicked Woman
[1:15:29] and johoram
[1:15:31] this weak Wicked Man
[1:15:34] and how they taught all of Judah to sin
[1:15:38] both sexual immorality and murder and
[1:15:41] all the things that and bring in these
[1:15:43] idols and all of that and he learned
[1:15:47] this young man
[1:15:49] and then he went and he started doing
[1:15:52] the same thing
[1:15:55] and I'm thinking as parents
[1:15:57] as we are raising our children
[1:16:02] we need to teach our children the things
[1:16:05] that are written in this book
[1:16:09] show them where these things are
[1:16:12] teach them why
[1:16:15] we believe the way that we do
[1:16:19] now look at I look at hazia
[1:16:22] growing up and listening to his parents
[1:16:25] talk
[1:16:27] and the type of conversation that they
[1:16:29] had
[1:16:30] and I think of myself as I go back as a
[1:16:34] child something that we always did is we
[1:16:38] always had supper together
[1:16:41] you may think that that's not important
[1:16:44] but it is
[1:16:45] getting that family together
[1:16:49] eating a meal
[1:16:52] talking about the Lord
[1:16:56] giving testimonies about about what's
[1:17:00] happened during the day or about things
[1:17:02] of old I remember growing up and sitting
[1:17:04] and listening to Mom and Dad and they
[1:17:07] were talking about all of they would
[1:17:09] talk about the word and they were
[1:17:10] talking about testimonies they were
[1:17:12] talking about miracles and how good God
[1:17:14] was and it Formed my character
[1:17:20] raise up a child child right
[1:17:23] and then these things will come back I
[1:17:26] may have strayed I may have done things
[1:17:29] that were wrong and I did
[1:17:31] but I had a foundation built within me
[1:17:35] and that Foundation brought me right
[1:17:39] back to this word
[1:17:41] and I look at my family now and I'm
[1:17:43] looking my my two brothers are serving
[1:17:46] the lord
[1:17:47] my sisters serving the lord all of them
[1:17:50] have Ministries
[1:17:52] and I've talked about like I've talked
[1:17:54] about my brother Adam and and the the
[1:17:56] Ministry we started in Jeffersonville
[1:17:59] with all of the with all of the um inner
[1:18:02] city youth
[1:18:04] these these mostly black kids that come
[1:18:08] out of Central Louisville and and just
[1:18:10] having a terrible life and one thing
[1:18:13] that they all have in common
[1:18:15] almost all of them
[1:18:16] they don't have a dad
[1:18:19] the world has taken the father out of
[1:18:23] the family
[1:18:26] and it's
[1:18:28] basically it's a demasculinization of
[1:18:30] the American man
[1:18:32] he is no longer the head of his house
[1:18:34] that is shunned by the world and
[1:18:37] sometimes I think it's shunned in our
[1:18:39] churches
[1:18:41] instead of having the amen the the dad
[1:18:45] who is the head of the house
[1:18:47] now remember First Corinthians chapter
[1:18:50] 11 says that
[1:18:52] that the man is the head of the woman
[1:18:55] Christ is the head of the man
[1:18:58] so tell me
[1:19:00] how righteous is Christ compared to you
[1:19:04] and me
[1:19:06] he is the head
[1:19:10] he is the more righteous so the the dad
[1:19:15] how much more righteous how much more
[1:19:17] holy how much better should the dad live
[1:19:22] than those that are in the family
[1:19:25] but do we follow that
[1:19:28] are the men in our family are they
[1:19:30] stepping to the plate are they living a
[1:19:32] life that is worthy of this gospel
[1:19:36] are we as dads are we putting this
[1:19:38] before our children all the time
[1:19:42] we need to
[1:19:45] a dad needs to be the head of the house
[1:19:48] and I see so often
[1:19:51] that we get stuck in what's called
[1:19:53] legalism
[1:19:55] especially in our ranks of people
[1:19:59] so we want a book of rules
[1:20:01] we want to say that a Scourge should be
[1:20:03] this long a hair should be this long and
[1:20:05] and the pain should be this and and the
[1:20:07] men should wear dad pants and white
[1:20:10] tennis shoes
[1:20:12] I like Dad pants you know they're fine
[1:20:15] but then we start becoming all the same
[1:20:19] but the dad
[1:20:22] needs to be able to make these decisions
[1:20:25] and it shouldn't have to always it
[1:20:27] shouldn't have to come from this pulpit
[1:20:31] the man is the head
[1:20:33] of the family
[1:20:36] and instead of having a book of rules we
[1:20:39] should have holy spirit filled fathers
[1:20:43] making these decisions as I said the
[1:20:46] other night brother but Aaron you don't
[1:20:47] want me telling your wife or your
[1:20:49] daughter how to live
[1:20:51] it's not the job here we should present
[1:20:54] this as I am now
[1:20:56] but we as men should step to the plate
[1:21:00] and that is what this man of hazia
[1:21:03] didn't have
[1:21:05] he did not have that leadership
[1:21:08] in his life of this of a Godly father
[1:21:15] and I I think about
[1:21:18] with us
[1:21:20] and trying to raise my children right
[1:21:23] and and and Daniel having our devotions
[1:21:27] at night like we did every night
[1:21:30] putting this message before my children
[1:21:35] all the time
[1:21:37] trying to live it in front of them
[1:21:41] Daniel used to wake up with me at 4 30
[1:21:43] every morning
[1:21:45] when he was a kid
[1:21:46] when he's he's still a kid when he was
[1:21:48] this kid like this big
[1:21:51] study the Bible with me
[1:21:53] as a little boy
[1:21:56] and he'd walk he'd walk in there I'd be
[1:21:58] sitting there I'd have my Bible open
[1:21:59] Daniel would walk in he was so sweet he
[1:22:02] his little guy bring me a blanket
[1:22:05] and then he'd go sit down on on the
[1:22:07] couch and I'd be studying and he would
[1:22:12] you know but he was trying
[1:22:15] and he built something inside of him
[1:22:18] now there's a Time
[1:22:21] when
[1:22:22] Our Youth and us
[1:22:27] when we will be presented with questions
[1:22:30] on what we believe
[1:22:32] we've heard this
[1:22:34] these comments so often
[1:22:38] and this fighting
[1:22:40] that's going gone on within brother
[1:22:43] branham's message of
[1:22:46] the absolute
[1:22:48] what a ridiculous argument
[1:22:51] it really is
[1:22:52] the absolute is whatever you and your
[1:22:54] life put as the absolute
[1:22:58] but we hear Brother Branham say these
[1:23:00] things
[1:23:02] and we need to know where these are in
[1:23:06] the Bible because there may be a time
[1:23:09] parents young parents
[1:23:12] future parents there may be a time
[1:23:16] when your children say you know what I
[1:23:18] don't believe brother Branham anymore
[1:23:21] that time May Come
[1:23:24] but will they have the foundation of
[1:23:26] this word
[1:23:28] then this becomes the absolute
[1:23:31] and then they will be able to say no
[1:23:34] actually
[1:23:35] it says it right here in the Bible
[1:23:39] you know we look at
[1:23:41] we talk about so often well and it's too
[1:23:44] much we talk about a woman's dress and
[1:23:47] and and all of these different things
[1:23:49] and
[1:23:51] we look at Paul
[1:23:53] First Timothy chapter 2.
[1:23:56] Paul said a woman shall Adorn herself in
[1:23:59] modest apparel would shame-facedness and
[1:24:01] sobriety not with gold
[1:24:06] or pearls
[1:24:08] or costly array
[1:24:11] we see that right here in the Bible
[1:24:15] and then people say well I don't believe
[1:24:17] it was random anymore and then they run
[1:24:20] and they start dressing the way that
[1:24:23] they want to dress and they start
[1:24:24] looking the way that differently than
[1:24:27] than they should be looking
[1:24:29] and what they're realizing is that ain't
[1:24:31] brother Branham
[1:24:33] he's not the one that taught that
[1:24:36] gold and pearls and costly way all right
[1:24:41] brother branham's actually his his angle
[1:24:44] on it was hey don't be so legalistic
[1:24:47] you can wear a wedding ring
[1:24:50] but if you just took the if you just
[1:24:52] took what Paul said to be like no no you
[1:24:54] can't wear any of that but brother
[1:24:56] Brandon the prophet said no a wedding
[1:24:58] Ring's okay if and he made the comment
[1:25:00] if your husband buys you a a brooch
[1:25:03] to pen to your your garment or if he
[1:25:07] buys you a necklace
[1:25:09] he says that'd be okay
[1:25:11] he said but just don't look like I think
[1:25:13] he he said his words were to let you
[1:25:15] walk through a dime store with a magnet
[1:25:17] attached to you
[1:25:20] but we look at we look at these things
[1:25:22] and when the time comes what is the
[1:25:25] absolute you can say wait wait wait wait
[1:25:27] wait a minute that wasn't brother
[1:25:29] Branham
[1:25:30] that was Paul
[1:25:32] that was the Bible
[1:25:34] don't don't pin that on him he was just
[1:25:37] preaching the Bible
[1:25:39] and he was preaching it with a wonderful
[1:25:41] wonderful perspective
[1:25:43] you know he talks about a woman having
[1:25:45] long hair
[1:25:48] you know first thing you know I don't
[1:25:50] believe brother Brandon anymore it comes
[1:25:51] off wait wait wait a minute that wasn't
[1:25:54] brother Branham
[1:25:56] that was first Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:25:59] you know it says very plainly that a
[1:26:02] woman should have long hair because it's
[1:26:03] recovering
[1:26:05] that's that is that but but so but
[1:26:09] because people don't understand they
[1:26:11] don't know their Bible all they hear is
[1:26:14] brother Brandon said brother Branham
[1:26:15] said brother Branham said well what
[1:26:17] happens when they say I don't care what
[1:26:18] brother Branham said
[1:26:21] I care you care
[1:26:24] but what happens when we face that this
[1:26:27] Foundation needs to be built then the
[1:26:31] absolute becomes this
[1:26:33] and it's a little bit different for
[1:26:36] people in today's society saying I don't
[1:26:38] believe that
[1:26:40] it's a little bit harder to say
[1:26:43] but if we can build that in our youth
[1:26:46] build that in each other
[1:26:48] then we have a little bit stronger
[1:26:51] foundation and answering these questions
[1:26:55] and that's what this man of hazia he did
[1:26:58] not have
[1:26:59] he didn't have
[1:27:01] that family around the supper table
[1:27:05] you know the guy that was at the U of A
[1:27:07] game the basketball game
[1:27:09] you know he was so happy
[1:27:12] he was so happy because he says you know
[1:27:14] these are my people
[1:27:16] this is this is what I was what I like
[1:27:19] let me tell you I am so happy I am so
[1:27:23] happy today because these are my people
[1:27:25] this is what I like to be around I love
[1:27:29] being here with people that actually
[1:27:32] care about this book
[1:27:36] I love it
[1:27:37] this book is my life it has been for a
[1:27:41] long time
[1:27:43] and it's and I love being around someone
[1:27:45] else that cares
[1:27:48] that
[1:27:49] they're not setting it aside like a
[1:27:52] hazia did
[1:27:53] they're not setting it aside for their
[1:27:55] own thoughts
[1:27:58] verse number five he said he he also
[1:28:00] walked after their counsel
[1:28:02] and went with johoram the son of Ahab
[1:28:05] king of Israel to war against Hazel the
[1:28:09] king of Syria
[1:28:10] at Ramos Gilead and the syrians smoke
[1:28:14] smoke jorm now joram was the king over
[1:28:18] in um Israel
[1:28:22] now you remember
[1:28:24] when I talked about the other day about
[1:28:26] the still Small Voice the Elijah in the
[1:28:28] cave
[1:28:30] do you remember what the still Small
[1:28:31] Voice told him it told him to go out
[1:28:35] and anoint
[1:28:37] a few people
[1:28:39] it said anoints Hazel king of king of
[1:28:42] Syria I believe it was and it said
[1:28:44] anoint this guy named jehu
[1:28:47] this guy was a warrior jehu was a strong
[1:28:53] powerful General turned out to be not
[1:28:57] such a good guy
[1:28:59] but annoyed him and then jehu you know
[1:29:01] what he did he walked in he came in with
[1:29:04] all of his chariots and everything and
[1:29:06] there's a there's Jezebel up on the
[1:29:08] rafters
[1:29:10] and she's looking like Jezebel and she
[1:29:12] sticks her head out and he says Hey
[1:29:14] throw her down
[1:29:17] and Jezebel it's in the Bible I'm okay
[1:29:20] to say it
[1:29:21] those are down
[1:29:24] you know Splat right on the ground
[1:29:28] dogs ate her
[1:29:29] you know I know it's
[1:29:31] kind of a horror movie but it's true
[1:29:34] I mean this is the real thing
[1:29:37] so this man jehu rolls in
[1:29:41] and
[1:29:43] he ends up killing
[1:29:45] this man ahasia
[1:29:49] let's go to verse 10 if you could my
[1:29:50] brother
[1:29:52] but when athalia I called her athelia
[1:29:55] athalia the mother of ahasia
[1:29:58] saw that her son was dead
[1:30:00] she arose and destroyed all the Royal
[1:30:04] seed all the seed Royal of the house of
[1:30:07] Judah
[1:30:08] a woman took the opportunity to take the
[1:30:11] kingdom to herself
[1:30:14] just like her mama
[1:30:15] you know
[1:30:17] she was taught wrong too
[1:30:21] now
[1:30:24] and uh I'm gonna close and I'm gonna I'm
[1:30:27] gonna get to this this evening and um
[1:30:31] the musicians if you would come
[1:30:34] but now we see introduced a wonderful
[1:30:40] wonderful example
[1:30:43] to the people of Judah
[1:30:47] but jehosha Beth
[1:30:50] the daughter of the king
[1:30:52] now
[1:30:54] there was this baby
[1:30:57] that they had
[1:30:59] athaliah came in and she starts killing
[1:31:03] all of the seed
[1:31:05] so she could have it her son ahasia died
[1:31:08] so afterlaya she's going out and she's
[1:31:11] killing all of these people so she
[1:31:13] doesn't have any competition so she can
[1:31:15] have the Kingdom so she can have the
[1:31:18] power
[1:31:22] but when ethaliah the mother of hazia
[1:31:24] saw her son was dead she Rose and
[1:31:26] destroyed all the seed Royal of the
[1:31:29] house of Judah
[1:31:30] but Jehoshaphat the daughter of the king
[1:31:33] took joash
[1:31:36] the son of ahasia and stoled him from
[1:31:39] among the king's sons that were slain
[1:31:41] and put him and his nurse in a bed
[1:31:44] chamber so jehoshaph joshabeth the
[1:31:47] daughter of King joram johoram the wife
[1:31:50] of jehoiada the priest
[1:31:53] for she was the sister of ahasia hid him
[1:31:56] from athaliah
[1:31:58] so that she slew him not
[1:32:01] so that this lady
[1:32:03] Jehoshaphat
[1:32:05] protected this baby who was of the royal
[1:32:07] seed
[1:32:09] this was being purged and these things
[1:32:11] were going on
[1:32:13] but she made a stand
[1:32:15] for God
[1:32:17] she made a stand for what was right her
[1:32:20] husband was a great man powerful man and
[1:32:23] in the Kingdom
[1:32:26] but this Jehoshaphat
[1:32:28] unlike
[1:32:31] Jezebel
[1:32:33] and unlike at thelaya she wasn't
[1:32:36] thinking about her own skin
[1:32:39] she was thinking about Lord what is the
[1:32:42] right thing to do and she risked her
[1:32:44] life
[1:32:45] to do what was right
[1:32:49] and he was hid with them
[1:32:51] in the house of God six years
[1:32:55] and athaliah reigned over the land
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:32:59] this dear sister
[1:33:04] she as I said she was an important lady
[1:33:07] in Judah
[1:33:10] she had what she needed to get by
[1:33:13] but she
[1:33:15] was willing to pay the ultimate
[1:33:17] sacrifice
[1:33:20] that
[1:33:22] this young man this little baby I think
[1:33:24] he was probably two years old or one
[1:33:27] year old or whatever it was that he
[1:33:29] would live
[1:33:31] and she protected him
[1:33:33] and I think about and I'm going to talk
[1:33:35] tonight
[1:33:37] about her husband jehoida who is one of
[1:33:40] my absolute heroes in the Bible
[1:33:45] but she and her husband protected this
[1:33:48] baby
[1:33:49] raised him up right
[1:33:52] in the Lord this baby named joash
[1:33:56] taught him right maybe sat around the
[1:33:59] supper table
[1:34:00] talked about
[1:34:03] the things of the Lord
[1:34:06] and today friends as as
[1:34:09] we
[1:34:12] are
[1:34:13] trying to do things right
[1:34:16] we are we are trying to serve God we see
[1:34:21] Satan coming in in all directions trying
[1:34:25] to distract us
[1:34:27] with any way that he can
[1:34:29] whether it be with our phones or whether
[1:34:31] it be with the television or whether it
[1:34:34] be with social media or whatever it is
[1:34:37] and and making it
[1:34:39] to where we don't have that family life
[1:34:42] anymore
[1:34:44] and I was thinking about
[1:34:47] I was thinking about Lord how our
[1:34:49] children
[1:34:51] and how all of these things are forced
[1:34:54] on them as I said the immorality that
[1:34:55] comes from the schools and and and all
[1:34:58] of these different voices that they hear
[1:35:01] and then we put social media in their
[1:35:04] hands and as I've said before I'm not
[1:35:06] against social media I think it could be
[1:35:09] used for the Lord
[1:35:11] but look what happens
[1:35:13] it takes the mom and dad
[1:35:16] takes them out of the equation and now
[1:35:19] they're all talking with each other all
[1:35:21] the time there's no more family time
[1:35:24] and they're raising themselves
[1:35:28] and they're being an influence on
[1:35:30] themselves
[1:35:32] and Mom and Dad aren't even there
[1:35:36] back and forth and back and forth
[1:35:40] if we could build a strength in our
[1:35:44] children
[1:35:45] and it comes from that home life
[1:35:48] it comes from Raising it comes from
[1:35:49] loving them it comes from teaching them
[1:35:52] so when the enemy comes in
[1:35:56] and he does when he comes in like a
[1:35:57] flood as Isaiah said that God will raise
[1:36:00] up that standard
[1:36:03] against him
[1:36:05] and we teach our children
[1:36:08] that hear
[1:36:10] this is God's word
[1:36:13] brother Branham we refer to him so much
[1:36:15] he preached this
[1:36:17] brother Branham lifted up
[1:36:20] this man named Jesus Christ
[1:36:25] and
[1:36:27] children if you could just meet this man
[1:36:32] Jesus
[1:36:34] this one that I have met
[1:36:36] this one that saved me
[1:36:39] this one that I was baptized in his name
[1:36:43] if you could just meet him
[1:36:48] then the sins that you commit the
[1:36:51] mistakes that you make and you will make
[1:36:53] them
[1:36:55] you can come back to that because he
[1:36:58] loves you
[1:36:59] a hazia didn't have that taught to him
[1:37:04] he had the world talk to him
[1:37:07] so I'm speaking mostly As
[1:37:09] I spoke a lot to the dads and the future
[1:37:12] dads
[1:37:13] today make sure that we are living a
[1:37:16] life
[1:37:17] that's worthy of the Gospel make sure we
[1:37:20] are living that life so our wives
[1:37:25] can look to us feel comfortable looking
[1:37:28] to us for leadership
[1:37:29] make sure of that and then mothers make
[1:37:33] sure we're teaching our children that
[1:37:36] this word
[1:37:38] it's the truth and it is the absolute
[1:37:42] make sure that that is taught because
[1:37:44] there is coming a time for all of them
[1:37:48] and all of us
[1:37:50] that those doubts come in
[1:37:53] and when those doubts come in that
[1:37:55] standard of the word
[1:37:59] that's inspired by the Holy Spirit
[1:38:02] it'll stand
[1:38:04] it'll stand against The Wiles of the
[1:38:08] devil
[1:38:09] so let's all stand
[1:38:11] brother Aaron if you could come and
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:20] it's a special time friends
[1:38:24] I believe that the Lord
[1:38:26] will soon return
[1:38:28] I know brother Peter said that but the
[1:38:31] law he said that 2000 years ago and he
[1:38:32] was expecting it
[1:38:34] but there's a lot of things that had to
[1:38:36] happen
[1:38:39] and if they haven't all happened
[1:38:42] they're all getting pretty close
[1:38:45] but we know that the devil is stronger
[1:38:48] today he is more influential he has more
[1:38:51] tools than he's ever had
[1:38:53] but never ever underestimate the power
[1:38:58] of sitting around the supper table
[1:39:01] never underestimate that fellowship with
[1:39:05] family
[1:39:06] that fellowship with loved ones
[1:39:10] and we're trying to build that
[1:39:13] Fellowship here with each other
[1:39:15] and we can lean on each other we can
[1:39:18] rely on each other you know when when
[1:39:20] the storms come
[1:39:22] and the Sheep they they get together and
[1:39:25] they'll all huddle up
[1:39:27] out in the fields and they just kind of
[1:39:29] lean on each other when those Storms
[1:39:32] Come they stay really tight together
[1:39:35] and that's how we should be is leaning
[1:39:39] on each other and loving one another
[1:39:41] protecting one another speaking for one
[1:39:44] another praying for one another that's
[1:39:47] what we need to be because we can look
[1:39:50] and we can see in this word we can see
[1:39:51] these examples
[1:39:53] and how so many times parents have
[1:39:57] failed because they've they've forgotten
[1:40:00] how important these things and they've
[1:40:03] fallen into the world
[1:40:05] but friends let's
[1:40:06] bow our heads
[1:40:13] thinking on the things of God
[1:40:17] thinking how important that Bible is to
[1:40:20] us
[1:40:21] thinking how important
[1:40:23] the words are in that Bible
[1:40:26] and how we just we should understand
[1:40:30] everything in there there's so much it's
[1:40:33] so rich
[1:40:34] Lord just let us let us have a little
[1:40:38] more revelation of your word
[1:40:41] Lord we love you we thank you
[1:40:44] feel your spirit
[1:40:46] of Love here this morning
[1:40:50] Lord we're just grateful

[1:40:55] these stories we can read them

[1:41:00] grateful for each other
[1:41:02] that we have each other Lord

[1:43:37] Peterson
[1:43:42] in the influence that he had upon us
[1:43:46] I watched him how he handled people how
[1:43:49] he talked to people how he greeted
[1:43:50] people
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:43:52] I saw his future son-in-law brother Mark
[1:43:57] and him in the back there get into a
[1:43:59] little tussle back there
[1:44:01] and I saw brother Peterson be a
[1:44:03] Christian
[1:44:05] and I saw brother Mark come back a
[1:44:06] little while later and say I'm sorry I
[1:44:08] was wrong
[1:44:10] it's all part of life
[1:44:14] we had the men's meeting
[1:44:16] on that Saturday morning
[1:44:19] I shared something with with with Vamp
[1:44:22] the brothers
[1:44:24] and that was Mom and Dad will have some
[1:44:27] some of this
[1:44:28] we're human we have we have situations
[1:44:31] back
[1:44:33] and a lot of times
[1:44:35] the kids see that the children see that
[1:44:38] but they don't see daddy and mama say
[1:44:40] I'm sorry I was wrong
[1:44:43] but if they can see both sides they'll
[1:44:45] see the balance of it they'll see
[1:44:48] God working in action honey I was wrong
[1:44:53] for you forgive me
[1:44:55] and that's how God works they watch us
[1:44:58] we were driving home myself and my
[1:45:00] daughter Sarah one day
[1:45:02] and I turned to her look
[1:45:04] and she was probably in her 20s already
[1:45:06] and I said tell me something about your
[1:45:08] dad and mom
[1:45:09] did you appreciate it yourself
[1:45:12] you stopped for a moment she said the
[1:45:14] fact that you and Mom were consistent
[1:45:17] if you said no Mom said no if you said
[1:45:20] yes Dad said yes
[1:45:22] we knew we couldn't ask you and if we
[1:45:24] didn't like the answer we could get a
[1:45:26] different answer from Mom
[1:45:29] but this is where that works
[1:45:31] if you stay true to the word of God he
[1:45:34] said I'll be with you I'll lead you I'll
[1:45:36] guide you
[1:45:38] or you'll have your days
[1:45:40] you'll have them times that you go to
[1:45:42] the to the room and say Lord help me
[1:45:45] help me be a true father help me be true
[1:45:47] a mother help me be a good
[1:45:49] bigger brother older sister
[1:45:52] and be a Christian amen
[1:45:55] blessed be the tide that binds
[1:45:58] what is that tie
[1:46:01] is that the family tradition
[1:46:03] no the tithe that binds us together
[1:46:06] is the word of God in our life

[1:47:18] to you fathers and you mothers who have
[1:47:20] made mistakes
[1:47:22] and done things wrong and are willing to
[1:47:24] admit say raise my hand
[1:47:25] [Music]
[1:47:27] we all do them
[1:47:30] you might have said well I'm I'm not as
[1:47:32] good as these Christian Brothers here
[1:47:34] we've all had our failures we've all
[1:47:36] made our mistakes
[1:47:38] but how many of us are willing to say we
[1:47:40] were sorry
[1:47:42] and we made it right
[1:47:45] okay
[1:47:47] for you that might question that hey it
[1:47:49] can be done I just wanted to show you
[1:47:51] that all of us are failures in ourselves
[1:47:55] but Paul said it this way I can do all
[1:47:57] things through Christ who strengthens me
[1:47:59] all of us will look back and say I wish
[1:48:00] I could have done that better I wish I
[1:48:02] couldn't end this but today you have
[1:48:04] that opportunity to start to build that
[1:48:06] block again to get that confidence back
[1:48:09] I trust that that will help you the next
[1:48:11] verse

[1:49:01] cried you've asked God for privacy to
[1:49:03] help you through the situation but
