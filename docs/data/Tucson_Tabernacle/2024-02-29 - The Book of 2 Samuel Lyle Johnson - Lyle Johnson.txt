testimony to share we want to give brother Lyall as much time as possible because he's he's got a lot to cover today I mentioned to brother Daniel one day when we get to Psalms I hope that's not just on one night that's going to be hard amen God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen it's just nice to be able to be here for a while and just get the feel of the church just get the feel of the spirit and the character of the church musicians the songs the worship the preaching it's you know the prophet said that the beauty of the church is the character of the people it's it's the character of Christ in you and and I feel that I feel that in the worship I feel that in the fellowship and it's just a wonderful it's beautiful you know God's bride is beautiful I I just uh was speaking to brother Dan Sunday we were talking and uh just uh quickly I want to give the Lord the glory on Saturday I had an attack of uh vertigo and it it started kind of Friday Friday afternoon we were fellowshipping with a Merl and sister Roberta and it started then and then it just that night it just came on strong and I could hardly stand up and the room went around and I'd had it before and it took me three weeks wow to get through it and it it was really dark it's a really bad thing and brother Reagan uh Donnie Reagan we talked and he said he had the same thing and I just want to thank the Lord for healing me I want to confess that I feel good amen and I'm not dizzy amen so I wanted to give God the glory for that and by the way uh it was my wife that prayed and and I believe God heard her prayer amen so you treat your wives good Brothers amen you never know when you're gonna they're going to pray for you amen so we were talking Sunday and uh it was Friday afternoon or no it wasn't Friday my goodness it was Thursday yeah Thursday we were out front here and uh I was just walking the dog and just standing in front of the church and and uh this man walked towards me and uh he said do you go to church here and I said yeah I go to church here and he says uh do you have Spanish do you have Spanish translation I said no I don't know I I said there's Spanish people here and I'm I'm sure there's translation for you and he said well I'm a I'm a minister I'm a Baptist Minister and so he said uh I was here before there was a man called David some David that uh invited him and uh this David went to Europe or something moved away but gave him some books and tapes and he said I I've read them and he said I'd like to come back this is many years ago so uh I said that's wonderful he said Do you believe it's the end time and I said oh absolutely I said we believe it's the end time and he said yeah that's what those books were talking about and uh so he said uh you believe it's the end time I said well just like the scripture said uh in the as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so we we traded some scripture and he just it was just uh a drawing I had his name is George pray for him he will drop in I'm sure he'll drop in he won't make make a it known but he'll drop in and so we were talking and uh he said by the way he said your church is growing he said what how do you how do you grow your church because since Co he said our church we don't have attendance anymore and and you can't get people to come out to church he said they'll stream but then you know you won't see them for two or three weeks and then just if it's convenient they'll show up so I said well that's that's around the world that's that's what Co has done that's that's what the enemy has tried to do right amen that's true brother true it's true it's it's it affects all of us and so uh I said but he said well how do you do it I said and I just thought about brother Dan and he's burdened for the lost and I said you know I said you just get the people on fire amen you just keep get the people on fire and then they'll tell someone else and that fire will go from one to another to a coworker to a neighbor to someone sick in the hospital someone gets healed amen I said you just do that and I said you get on fire for God and the people will see it in you and you and they'll start to to pick that up you see what we the way we preach if we're preaching under that anointing that that's what you feel you preach that fire into the people you preach that burden for Souls into the people and I just had such a burden for this man and me and George we just HD it off it was just like we were old friends and we walked together down the street and he said you know what he paid me a compliment he said you know what I feel you really love the Lord he said uh that was the greatest compliment he could ever pay me I said Thank You George and and I'll be praying for you little church and you know just come you feel free to come anytime you want so as we were talking like that he he when he was asking me how do you grow your church I said well you know because we're living in the end time God's going to draw all all men unto himself if we lift up Jesus am he'll draw all men Amen to himself if we lift up Jesus if we if we reflect Jesus and uh I said who who was it in the days of Noah that told the animals to come into the ark and he said well it was God I said yes I said God did it because it was that time and I said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be God is going to draw all men he's going to draw backsliders he's going to draw our loved ones our our family that is not saved he's going to draw them yes sir and I said you know he's able of these stones to raise up children if if people are you know uh Church get a church spirit and then they don't show up they'll they God will take people off the street right amen he'll take he'll take Stones he'll take like like I said those rocks there and I pointed to the rocks and and as I was pointing to the Rocks this young girl walks up to the front of the church and she starts pulling on the doors she's pulling on the doors and and brother Arie walked up and uh and I said brother Arie there's there's a young girl trying to get in the church you better go see her because I wanted to talk to the to the minister so just as I was saying that here's this young girl trying to get into the church and you know and she wasn't dressed too well but you know my wife and I had a chance to to talk to her brother Arie talked with her and we you know she was just a broken girl that that found herself on the street and she wasn't like a homeless person she was cleaner than that and she wanted help so we just had a burden for her my wife and I drove her to the to the rescue mission and uh you know got her on her way and gave her what she had need of and you know and uh we just both wept because we had such a burden for this girl amen and we told her you come you come don't you know you those doors are always open God's house is always open for anyone any sinner amen so you know it was such a privilege I just wanted to share that with uh brother Dan and you know I thought boy I should I should get out there on on the front of the church more often amen you know I should just stand out there with my Bible and sub tracks you know in Africa uh what they do we just bought a sound system for a little church that's on a main road and all the all the people walk by it and so he said I want a sound system I want a speaker like that and he said then I'll play The Prophet's messages and I'll play singing and worship and and as they're going by they'll they they listen to it so uh I think it was the last time I was here there was a sister and I'm not going to say who she was and she's she's she knows who she is and uh she gave a little offering and we bought that sound system amen and they got it in front of the church may we should start playing stuff in front of the church it would it would either drive them away or bring them in amen so you know that's how they do it over there so anyway God bless you amen you know uh God is going to draw Sinners God is going to draw our loved ones amen and I I I was just here last night praying and and my brother who's not saved he just came on my heart so strong strong amen I I just believe God's going to save them amen God bless you we love you [Applause] amen I told Brother Lyall you can have two or three services so we'll be okay you know you see the you see the gift operating and brother martin you can see why he's been successful in what he's doing he's got a burden for these people people when the Lord places a burden on your life a burden on your heart then and he and if he doesn't just place it on the husband sister Margie places on the wife too and you see that love come forward and you see people come in and brother martin there's nothing we could do more than to love these people and if if the churches aren't if the people aren't coming into the churches the Lord Jesus he gives the Parable he says go out into the highways and the hedges and go out under the streets and go out among these homeless people and bring them in because my table will be full prise God I would hate to be one of those people that don't get the spot at the table wow because it wasn't important to me well it is important to that young lady that was trying to get in the church it was important to the man the Baptist Minister that saw the people leaving his church it is the most important thing that we can do on Earth is to lead somebody to a living Jesus Christ amen amen I have to give a testimony about the speaker um sorry brother Lyle but it's h just a few minutes so my grandpa he heard way back in the early 1950s he heard this man preach that absolutely changed his life so he started ordering his tapes he started following him around the country and he just fell in love with this man's Ministry so he would get his tapes Brother Martin and uh he bought him a big speaker like the one that you're talking about and he put it on top of his house in tiffon Georgia and he hooked he ran the wire down to the to the real toore tape player and he plugged it in and he blasted it so the whole neighbor could no the whole neighborhood could hear brother Brandon well the sheriff got called and he comes to his house and he says Mr Evans he says you can't play that speaker on the top of your house he said the neighbors are complaining he says okay I'm sorry I'm sorry oh um I won't do it anymore so he takes his speaker takes it down brother Joel from the house and and he brings it to his shop to his his guest his service station on the other part of town in tiffon Georgia and he puts it on top of the service station he runs the wire down to the Real toore Player and he turns it on and he lets the whole area there listen to brother brandom and the sheriff came he said Mr Evans he saysi told you he said you can't put the speaker up on the building he said the neighbors are complaining he said I'm sorry I'm very sorry I won't I won't put it on my my shop either Sheriff leaves he goes up there grabs the speaker takes it down screws it to the top of his car and he runs the wire and an inverter down down to his back seat and he's got the real toore they didn't have tape players in the cassette players back then he runs it down to the real toore tape player in his back seat and he starts driving around tiffon Georgia playing brother brandom's message and brother martin they do that today in Africa and in Latin America they will put those speakers on the roofs of the cars and and they will drive around playing brother brandom's message so that's nothing new brother it's been going on for a long time let's let's all stand brother Aaron if you could lead us in a song while we introduce our brother Lyle Brother Martin thank you I love that gift in your life that love that you have for the Lord and that that love that you have for God's people and let me tell you it doesn't go unnoticed it doesn't go unnoticed by us and I know that it doesn't go unnoticed by the Lord God bless you now as as brother Lyall comes he's going to be talking about this great man David this is we heard how David grew up and he was anointed as a very young man to be king and he lived through this ministry of King Saul I believe Saul's Ministry was 40 years and it wasn't but about a year and a half two years into Saul's Ministry that he stopped serving the lord and then that anointing that that kingship went to this young man David and he waited for I don't know 20 or 30 years patiently as the Lord built the character in him and then brought him to the place that we are going to now learn from our brother ly in this book of 2 Samuel brother [Music] mesty worship His mesty unto Jesus be all glory honor and praise [Music] oh [Music] mesty Kingdom Authority flows from his throne unto his own his anthem [Music] R so exalt lift up on

condemners neither do I condemn thee just go and sin No More Hell had the same thought today [Music] bless so exalt lift up the name of Jesus magnify come glorify Christ Jesus the king m [Music] mesty worship His mesty Jesus who died now glorified king of all Kings thank you amen good evening let me try that again good evening good evening Welcome to our ongoing w Wednesday evening Bible study not in depth th sections of scripture to derive Doctrine or practice but an overview to provide familiarity with the concepts contents and themes of the various books that comprise our Bible to see God's fingerprints on the lives actions and interactions of the people whose stories are told and here in the Old Testament looking for references to the Messiah hopefully encouragement for each of us to read each book individually amen before we read our opening scriptures this evening let's approach the Lord one more time and seek his guidance and presence Lord Jesus we're in awe of you we're humbled Lord to stand before people that you have purchased by your own blood by your Sacrifice by your love to rescue us from our own sins our own impulses our own desires our own inclinations Lord and to draw us to yourself as as a brother said Jesus said all the father hath given me will come I won't lose one we're so grateful for that promise because we rest in it Lord we thank you for your love and grace and mercy be with us this evening Lord as we turn into this book lord to see what you have for us 3,000 years is after the events that are recorded that apply to us today we thank you for this opportunity to be together in Jesus precious name amen tonight we begin looking at the book of 2 Samuel God willing next Wednesday we'll finish looking while we're standing let's read of course from Deuteronomy chapter 17 beginning at verse 14 this passage includes five simple direct easily understood commands from the Lord to every King who might rule over the descendants of Israel we found in Genesis that Jacob had one command couldn't keep it we'll see how well the Kings keep these five as we continue our overview of the books of the Bibles Deuteronomy 17 beginning at verse 14 when thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say I will set a king over me like as all the other nations that are around about me thus predicting the people would eventually demand a traditional King Thou shalt in any wise set him King over thee whom the Lord thy God shall choose indicating that the Lord would choose a man who would take on this responsibility and this would be one from among thy Brethren shalt thou set King over thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy brother so the king must be a descendant of Jacob and chosen by the Lord not by popular vote that's the Commandment to the people regarding a king but now come the Commandments to the King number one he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to Egypt to the end that he should multiply horses sounds a little strange but horses are Swift and Powerful they were used primarily for displaying military Advantage those days calvalry and chariots the Lord's our strength not the horses for as much as the Lord has said unto you you shall henceforth return no more that way neither shall he rule number two multiply wives to himself why not that his heart turn not away but as our brother just mentioned in his testimony Brothers you should each love your wife as Christ loved the church it's a very very important relationship neither shall he three greatly multiply to himself silver and gold and it shall be when he sth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall for write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests and Levites the king is subject to he's not above the laws of God Amen and it shall be it what the copy of the book of the law shall be with him why that he shall rule number five read therein all how many all the days of his life and hopefully follow each of the Commandments concerning a king that he may learn to fear to respect to honor to Revere the Lord your God his God to keep all how many all the words of this law and these statutes including these five we've just read to do them why well now we're told why that his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren right think of Jesus as the ultimate servant leader and that he turned not aside from the Commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and and his children in the midst of Israel that's right please be seated in the Book of Judges we learned that without strong leadership people drifted off into sinful behavior and left following the Lord last Wednesday evening brother Daniel brought us an overview of the book of 1 Samuel he did 31 chapters in one night it's going to take me two nights to do 24 I'm not sure what the lesson is there but but but we learned of Samuel's birth about Eli raising him in the Tabernacle at Shiloh about the corrupt children of Eli and later of Samuel that caused the people to cry out for a method of government like the other nations around them don't you find it curious that the thing that they were objecting to that this guy who was a good leader had children who were incompetent or corrupt leaders and they didn't like that so now they're demanding a king which which is exactly a hereditary thing they're demanding to enshrine in law the very thing that they were trying to escape anyway I I don't claim to understand why but we saw how the Lord told Samuel that this desire of the people was a rejection of the Lord being their leader in L of a king leading them remember under the judges God picked the successor it wasn't a hereditary succession though many judges and The Offspring of most Jud judges tried to make it that way after warning the people what would happen under a king the Lord had Samuel anoint Saul as King in accordance with Deuteronomy and after Saul's failed leadership Samuel anointed David to succeed Saul not one of Saul's Sons we learned that David refused to do anything against Saul because Saul had been anointed to be king by the prophet Samuel at the direction of the Lord David show showed respect to the office that Saul held but not necessarily falty to the person of Saul first Samuel ended with the death of Saul and his son Jonathan while and yet another battle with the Philistines killed in battle at a place called Mount gilboa and thinking about how to approach second Samuel I realize that most days when I checked my email account I often scan some of the news headlines if we were to gather some headlines from the first half of the book of 2 Samuel they they might read something like this if you read or scanned these headlines would you have a reasonable picture of the events of the book of second Samuel some of them might draw you into the accompanying article beneath each headline others you might glance at and move on not being particularly interested how did David hear of Saul's death who who is Ish bosette what's with Abner what's this about an arc is it the one Noah built who is Nathan that he can scold the king it takes more than headlines you need context you probably need to dig a little deeper into the article and Beyond and that's assuming that you trust the reporting carried by the daily parchment but from these headlines I think one thing is clear the daily parchment has a lot of articles about this fellow named David last week we learned about David from his selection as being the next king to his Fame spreading throughout Saul's Kingdom to the death of Saul all in the book of 1 Samuel when reading our Bibles and seeking to understand what's written we should always keep in mind that parchment and ink the knowledge of reading and writing were precious in ancient times we need to keep context in mind not take things in is isolation not project our culture in our times into their culture in their times some things are left unsaid because either they're said elsewhere or because in the context at the time that they were written they were well known and didn't need to be explicitly stated let's give an example from 1 and 2 Samuel let's read the article following the first headline David hears of Saul's death this is found in 2 Samuel chapter 1 now it came to pass after the death of Saul when David was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and David had Abode two days in ziklag we'll see where that is in a moment it came to pass on the third day after Saul's death that Behold a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent and dirt on his head and so it was when he came to David he fell to the Earth and did obedience and David said unto him from whence comest thou and he said unto him out of the camp of Israel am I escaped and David said unto him how went the matter I I pray you tell me and he answered that the people are fled from the battle and many of the people are also fallen and dead and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also and David said to the young man that told him how knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead and the young man that told him said as I happened to chance upon Mount gilboa behold Saul leaned upon his Spear and lo the Chariots and Horsemen followed hard after him and when he looked behind him and he saw me he called unto me and I answered and said here am I and he said unto me who are who are you and I answered him I am an amalekite and he said unto me again stand I pray thee upon me slay me anguish has come upon me because my life is yet whole in me so I stood upon him and slew him because I was sure he could not live after that he was fallen and and I took the crown that was upon his head and and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them thither to my Lord then David took hold on his clothes and rent them likewise all the men that were with him this was a sign of grief and mourning in that culture at that time and they mourned and wept and fasted until the evening for Saul for Jonathan his son for the people of the Lord for the house of Israel because they were Fallen By The Sword and David said unto the young man that told him where are you from where are you from and he answered um the son of a stranger an amalaki and David said unto him how is thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lord's anointed and David called one of the young men and said go near fall upon him and he smote him that he died and David said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying I have slain the Lord's anointed but last week we read another account of this found in 1st Samuel 31 let's read a brief ex just a couple of verses here now the Philistines fought against Israel and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain in Mount gilboa and the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons and the Philistines slew Jonathan and abinadab and rushia Saul's sons and the battle went s went badly against Saul The Archers hit him he was sore wounded of The Archers he was mortally wounded by an arrow he was going to die then Saul said to his armor Bearer draw thy sword thrust me through there with lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and and abuse me but his armor Bearer would not for he was too afraid therefore Saul took a sword and fell upon it and when his armor Bearer saw that Saul was dead he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him now if you only read 1st Samuel 31 you conclude Saul committed suicide there's no mention of the amalaki but in 2 Samuel chapter 1 fills the space between verses four and five of 1st Samuel 31 we see that Saul already more Al wounded attempted suicide but failed to end his life quickly and instead added to his torment he was suffering horribly from an arrow as well as after intentionally falling on his own weapon a sord orous spear the amalekite came heard Saul's anguish plea and ended his misery as Saul requested Saul's armor Bearer refused Saul's command to kill him and stayed with him as he suffered Agony the the amalekite complied with Paul's request when the armor Bearer saw that Saul was dead he killed himself when David heard the report of the amalekite he ordered him killed David's an aoral quandry I think on the one hand David had suffered persecution under Saul yet he respected Saul's office and refused to defend himself what would David have done if he he happen to come upon Saul at this moment instead of the unnamed amalekite would he stay with him mortally wounded and watch him suffer and die in agony as he begged David to end his misery like he'd asked his armor Bearer would David obey the man who held the office he was respecting seeing his hopeless case and intense suffering and comply with Saul's request to quickly and mercifully end his pain which do you think he would have done which do you think he should have done what if it were you and Saul what would you have done second Samuel like the history preceding it and as we'll see the subsequent history of the descendants of Jacob is full of violence we need to remind ourselves that the cultural Morality In values placed on human life 3,000 years ago was Far different than our modern Western values and mores and that even today stripped of these values people are still given to the lust for personal power and a willingness to make or allow others to suffer horribly to achieve those goals today we can look at the horrific conditions of the people of the Ukraine as they're Meed in a desperate struggle for survival under the cruel onslaught of Putin and his Russian army the Ukrainian people have been depending on the Promises of a Fickle and polarized government of the United States to help Supply them with the means for survival and we see our own politicians are willing to break those promises willing to let them suffer and die in an effort to seek personal political Advantage at home so while second Samuel is on the one hand ancient history on the other hand it's a mirror of our world world today and its lessons are still relevant to each of us living here in Tucson in the 21st century ad well let's get back to second Samuel some more headlines David Mourns the death of Saul especially his son Jonathan who is very close to David in chapter two the Lord directs David to move from ziklag where he was when he got this message to heon he goes there along with his two wives he's anointed king over the tribal lands of Judah now we'll learn in chapter five that he was 30 years old when he got to heon and began to Reign well if Saul reigned 40 years this means that Saul had been King for 10 years before David was even born and he had been King for well over 20 years at the time of the contest with Goliath David will rule in he for seven and a half years he discovers that the men of yabish Gilead recovered the bodies of Saul and his sons and buried them David extends his thanks to them meanwhile the commander of Saul's Army fellow named Abner installs one of Saul's surviving Sons as king over Israel the man's name is ishbosheth and he ruled from a place called mahanaim he was 40 years old at the time we he reigned for two years I know the math gets a little weird we're not going to go into it that's not the point tonight so I hope you can see this map those of you sitting in the back I'm sure brought your binoculars I've mentioned that many times so what you have here is in the upper part there circled in yellow Mount gilboa that's the place in Israel where Saul and Jonathan were killed and just across the Jordan River is a place called yabish Gilead that's where the people people came recovered the bodies of Saul and Jonathan and so forth and and buried them there we see uh this town mahanaim just below yabish gilad where this fellow wish boet uh has been installed as a king down here at the lower part you see an arrow from ziklag to Hebron that's where David moved the Lord told him to get out of ziklag which was essentially Philistine territory and get up to Hein um and I've left a scale of miles in there because you can see it's a fair distance from Mount uh gilboa down to ziklag that's why I took that fell it was the third day when he got there he'd been you know running a marathon for a couple of days here just above Jerusalem you can see this star around this place called gibian um and we'll uh we'll talk about gibian probably this is a good time there's a battle there chapter 2 ends with a strange battle in that town of gibian it's really a second Civil War the first being the near destruction of The Tribe of Benjamin recorded in judges here joab leads an army of David Abner leads an army of ish boset a battle ensues David's Army prevails along the way of all this stuff Abner winds up killing one of joab's Brothers in the end they say you know this is stupid we're all descendants of Jacob we shouldn't be killing each other so they agreed maybe it's a bad idea to be killing each other so they stop and they go home adner goes back to isbet joab goes back to David chapter three lists six Sons born to David and heon by six different women three of whom were his wives one of those Sons is a fellow named Absalom we'll see him we'll meet him next week second half of the book meanwhile David's arm is getting stronger ish boets is getting weaker then a disagreement ensues between uh between isbos and Abner over a concubine that had been part of Saul's household a concubine it's a strange word we don't use it today but it's a woman who cohabitated with a man was not his wife but otherwise legally bound to him so this argument between Abner and isbet causes Abner to decide to abandon isbet and turn to David as their King influence Israel to unite once again under a king so Abner and David agree to a meeting David requires return of one of his wives Michael who was the one of Saul's daughters who' been his wife and been separated now she was living in Israel under isbos she's married off to some other guy so isbet returns Michael adner meets with David they strike a deal Abner's on his way back meanwhile joab comes into town doesn't trust Abner says the guy's no good and so he goes out sets a trap kills Abner this it states is in Revenge for Abner having killed his brother back at the Battle of gibian David wasn't aware of this treachery he Mourns the loss of Abner and he curses joab for his deceit some more headlines in chapter four to angry Captain angry I'm sorry I'm old sometimes I see the right number of syllables but get the wrong word two Army captains I maybe they weren't angry plot against and kill isbos they bring his head to David in Hebron hopefully they had it in a bag David is angry with them has them executed and buries is bit's head in Abner's town in heon ab's Tomb in heon Focus L and chapter 5 the elders Of The Scribe of the tribes other than Judah come to David and heon and accept him as their King thus reuniting all the tribes under one leader David conquers Jerusalem he establishes a district there that's called the city of David and sometimes referred to as David stronghold when it says David goes into his stronghold that's in the city of David this District in Jerusalem hyram king of Ty sends Cedars carpenters and Masons to build a house for David in Jerusalem David meanwhile acquires more wives and concubines during his 33-year reign in Jerusalem 11 sons and daughters are named who were born to him in Jerusalem including a fellow named Solomon we'll meet him in First Kings mostly or beginning anyway the chapter concludes with another pair of battles with the Philistines they're always fighting the Philistines I I think that means something both take place in the nearby Valley of refaim which is about three miles west of Jerusalem and after the Second Battle the Philistines are pushed out of the Hill Country and back down to the coastal plain when are you going to stop reading headlines brother Lyall soon next we see that the Arc of the Covenant which the Philistines had captured and then returned as we learned in 1 Samuel last week is going to come to Jerusalem so this map shows the the location of kirat urum kirat juram and the distance that it goes to Jerusalem and and it's only about 8 miles it's about the same distances from here to the entrance to Tucson International Airport we're not going really far here and I don't know where along the way that dotted line is the road of the time but I just put a red X there because there's a problem somewhere along the way that that we're going to read about um so that gives you a an idea of where things are and this Valley where the Philistines were pushed out of is roughly where you see the number six on the uh scale of miles there that's approximately the valley of refaim where the they had had the big battles with the Philistines okay enough for geography no test coming up so let's move along 2 Samuel chapter 6 let's read the article behind the headline Again David gathered together all the chosen men the elite troops of Israel 30,000 that is a big deal and David arose and went with all the people that were with him from Baal of Judah to bring up from th the Ark of God whose name is called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubim and they set the Ark of God on a new cart well the Philistines had done that they put the Ark on a cart and send it to Israel so work for them might as well work for us and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in giba now gibba is a word that means Hill so it's not the town of gibba but it's on the hill the G the giba the town was cuat urum as we learned in 1st Samuel chapter 16 and seven and saw on the map and usza and AIO the sons of abinadab drove the new cart and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at gibba that the hill of kirat urum accompanying the Ark of God and AO went before the ark and David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of furwood even on Harps sometimes known as liars and on sultes otherwise known as loots on timberl tambourines cornets these are wooden castets not brass horns remember these are made of furwood and on symbols well I didn't know what a liar looked like l y r i know what an l i a r looks like sometimes but not an l y r e um these homonyms but and I didn't know what a salry was so I got a couple of pictures here to give you an idea yeah so so if they're playing on a lie or a harp Little David play on your harp Hallelujah you probably know that song from Sunday School uh that guy in the red shirt there is is playing a liar the loot I couldn't find an example of an ancient loot apparently they're not very popular these days but this is a a clay statue that was excavated from Mesopotamia uh Middle East that dates back to about Christ time between 2 Century BC and and and Christ and you can see that it's a long stringed instrument that's plucked uh they didn't have bows in those days they just use those for arrows but they they like to pluck strings so I thought you'd be interested in seeing that we'll move on when they came to nun's threshing floor usza put forth his hand to the Ark of God and took hold of it for the oxen shook it it was going to fall off the cart he didn't want this precious thing damaged so he stepped into protect protected and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Jah and God smoked him there for his error and there he died by the Ark of God David was not a happy camper he was displeased because the Lord had made a breach upon usza he called the name of the place Perez usza perz means breach so breach of usza to this day and David was afraid of the Lord that day and said how shall the Ark of the Lord come to me so David would not remove the Ark of the Lord unto him into the city of David but David carried it aside into the house of obededom the gitite and the Ark of the Lord continued In The House of obededom the Getti three months and the Lord blessed obededom and all his household now brother brandham talked about this event calling it doing God of service in this case bringing the the ark without meaning outside of his will the method of Transport the ark was not to be touched it was to be carried on poles through rings on either side of the Ark and only on the shoulders of Levites specifically the descendants of Kath we learned this in numbers 330- 31 glad you remembered that okay so what happens here it was told King David saying the Lord has blessed the house of obad Edom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the Ark of God so David went and brought up the Ark of God from the house of obededom into the city of David with gladness well wait a minute last time it ended in disaster this time with gladness what happened brother L glad you asked the king complied with the commands of Deuteronomy 17 our opening scripture the detail that he read is found in 1st Chronicles 15 let's let's just jump to 1ron Chronicles for a moment here David called for zadak and abat the priests and for the Levites for uel and asiah and Joel and shemiah and elel and aminadab and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that you may bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel un the place that I have prepared for it for because you did it not at the first David understands what going on the Lord Our God made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order so the priests and Levites Sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel and the children of the Levites bear the Ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord so it's now been transported property properly remember the duty of the king is to study and conform form to apply the law now he's doing it we go back to 2 Samuel we understand why they're happy now and so it was that they bear the Ark of the Lord the Levites when they'd gone six Paces David arranged to have sacrificed oxen and fatlings and David danced before the Lord I can't do it with all his might and David was girded with a linen ephod now how many of you have ever worn a linen ephod no what a linen ephod what what is that it it's a priest's upper garment think of it as a kind of a long vest he was exuberantly happy because he knew where he had failed before he knew why the problem had occurred and he was confident the ark would now be successfully transported to its prepared place he was celebrating in his obedience to the Lord something about Sunday and obedience I thought so so we read here that David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet Somebody's Watching from a window Michael Saul's daughter and one of David's wives saw him and was embarrassed she scolded him about his behavior and he said he'd do it again and more so Michael remained Barren as a punishment from the Lord for her attitude be careful what you say back to the Daily parchment headlines with the ark secure in Jerusalem you now come to chapter 7 this is perhaps my favorite chapter in 2 Samuel so let's read it together it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the Lord had given him rest roundabout from all his enemies he could can relax nice fire going in the fireplace feet up one of his friends is there a fellow named Nathan Nathan happens to be a prophet he also happens to be his friend the king said unto Nathan the Prophet this is a conversation between friends Fellowship sharing enjoying each other's company see now well look here consider this Nathan I dwell in a house of Cedar but the Ark of God dwelleth within curtains that's just doesn't seem right to me my friend and and Nathan though a prophet was now speaking as a friend who knew David very very well Nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the Lord's with you David you're a good guy you've got a good heart this is on your heart go for it bro now we see that not everything a prophet says is thus saith the Lord regardless of office we're all humans so Nathan told him one thing and it came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan oh now he's a prophet saying go and tell my servant David thus saith the Lord so now it will be thus saith the Lord Nathan is a prophet though still a friend thus saith the Lord shalt thou build an house for me to dwell in whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a Tabernacle in all the places where I have walked with all the children of Israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of Israel whom I commanded to Feed My People Israel saying why build ye not me a house of Cedar now therefore so shalt thou say unto my my servant David thus saith the Lord of hosts I took thee from the Sheep coat from following the Sheep to be ruler over my people over Israel whose people were they brother Aaron The Davids no they were the Lords they were the Lords and I was with thee withs soever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth moreover I will speaking of the future I will first appoint a place for My People Israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more and second neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them anymore as before time and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over My People Israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also in addition to these things the Lord tth thee that he will make thee in house what David has a house of Cedar that's what started this whole conversation he's wanting to make a better place for the ark God speaking of other things Dynasty and when thy days be fulfilled you're going to die David you're going to go the way of All Flesh and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers I will set up thy seed one one of your descendants after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels shall he's not born yet David and I will establish his kingdom now there's two things going on here there's two levels two two things going on can you tell what the each are he this descendant shall might perhaps shall build an house for you no for my name and I will establish the Throne of your no the Throne of his kingdom forever I will be his father he shall be my son if he commit iniquity I'll chastise with the rod of men with the stpes of their children of men but my Mercy shall not depart from him as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee and thy Throne shall be established forever how through this descendant that he's referring to according to all these words and according to all this Vision so did Nathan speak unto David well when Nathan shares this David breaks into worship it's exactly what God desires from us worship I I personally feel that the 15 20 minutes before service then when the worship leader comes in the next 15 or 20 minutes I think those are some of the most important minutes in the entire service because we're ministering to the Lord not the Lord ministering to us although we often does but we're ministering to him what's more important him or us brother Daniel put a virtual sign up here on Sunday morning said it's all about him I don't know if you can read that sign but it's there it's there you just keep looking one of these days you'll see it so uh it's even if we like David apparently don't completely understand what he's saying to us at first glance you might think Nathan and therefore the Lord is speaking of Solomon and the temple that Solomon built and at one level that's that's true but David's physical Dynasty as king did end right the kingdom split at Solomon's death and David's descendants for few hundred years ruled Judah not all of Israel and then they ruled absolutely nothing the Lord's looking far beyond that more than Solomon this is a prophecy thus saith the Lord about the Messiah yes it's about Jesus not yet born God will be his father not like a father to him but I will be his father and he shall be my son right the only begotten right this isn't Solomon it's Jesus and this house of the Messiah will be established forever it was established 2,000 years ago and it's still in existence it's not the chain of descendants of David leading to the final conquest and deart under Nebuchadnezzar some 500 years later the temple Solomon built was destroyed and rebuilt and destroyed again the Temple of the lord it's in our hearts it's in his people what we call the body of Christ it's part of that body we should Worship the Lord with joy and gratitude headlines David's victories chapter eight details conquest by David and his army but in this I think we see a dark side to David's character and some of these Victor let's just read a couple of verses here 2 Samuel 8:2 and he David smoked Moab we remember Moab from Ruth a couple of weeks ago and this is just I measured them with a line casting them down to the ground even with two lines measured he to put to death and with one full line to keep alive in other words he had this people in this place who conquered lay down lay down lay down on the ground lay lat on lat on okay I've got this link there okay this group here group a you go see joab joab kill them all okay group two um go see joab joab kill them all group three uh go see this guy he's going to send you to the goolag you're you're slaves now this next group go see joab he's going to kill you can you imagine can you imagine being a moabit and being put through that can you what what is David thinking doing that I don't know I to me I see a dark side of his character perhaps I'm wrong so the moabites became David's servants and brought gifts David SM also had edzer son of Rahab king of zoba and as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates and David took took from him a th000 chariots and 700 Horsemen and 20,000 footmen and David hoed all the Chariot horses what does that mean hod anybody know what that means hamstr strong means that he got the tendons in their back leg crippled the horses perhaps killed them if they couldn't walk anymore to get to food and to Graves and so forth this is the very thing that Levi and Simeon did that in Genesis 49 when uh uh Jacob is making his you know uh Joseph will be like a branch going overall making all these predictions and prophecies he said Simeon and Levi have nothing to do with these guys they're evil Wicked people they they they did this to ox and found and Sheck them so he did this to the horses but reserved for them a 100 chariots why he did that why he didn't just kill the horses I I don't know but it just seems like a cruel thing to do to the horses now with a centralized government we have to have an Administration right officials a cabinet a bureaucracy there's a part of Verse 18 that can cause confusion I'm going to read you the second half of Verse 18 of of chapter 8 here in three different translations in the King James version Verse 18 ends it says David's Sons were Chief rulers if you read in the NIV or the ESV it says David's Sons were priests if you read in the NLT it says David son served as Priestly leaders they can't be priests they can't be priests it's a long tribe they can't do it but the Hebrew word is Cohen in the plural cenim and it usually is translated as priests but but the root of the word it means Minister one who intervenes and that's the root so it doesn't mean that they assumed any religious Priestly office so be careful when you're reading and you come across and it says David's son served as priests you know that can't be right dig in find out what's going on so just just a note to just be a little bit careful back to the Daily parchment chapter n contrasts the barbarity of chapter 8 with David's kindness to Jonathan's surviving son mbishi he was injured resulting in being lame in both feet we told and he was is hidden during the confusion after Abner's death several years before we talked about that earlier this evening David assigned to mbth all the inheritance pertaining to Saul and Jonathan and he regularly dined with David as one of the king's Sons chapter 10 relates a series of battles between Israel and the ammonites and the syrians resulting in victories for Israel now we come to one of the saddest stories of personal moral collapse in this portion of the scripture 2 Samuel chapter 11 it sets the stage for some things here David's Army is out fighting the ammonites David for whatever reason stays behind in Jerusalem one afternoon he walks out on the roof of his house it's quite common in those days no air conditioning not even swamp coolers the roof was one of the coolest places if you read any history of the City of Tucson you'll find that it was very common practice here as well people would go up on the roof in the afternoon sleep up there in the evening and so forth because it was cooler than down at ground level well he's strolling around the roof of his Palace and he looks over and he sees a woman washing herself David decides he wants her David knows she's the wife of Uriah Uriah is listed among David's Mighty Men as one of his top 37 Warriors David knows this guy this guy has put his life on the line for David Time and Time and Time Again listed in 2 Samuel 23:39 and 1st Chronicles 11:41 and he had to be a man of some rank or he couldn't have had his house right next door to the Palace location location location isn't just about modern real estate so he sends for her any way and has relations with her he knows what he's doing she becomes pregnant David tries to hide his sin so he sends for Uriah her husband to come home from the front lines for a weekend's rest figuring he'll probably be with his wife during that time and this will hide David's soon Uriah is a better man than that he doesn't do it David sends him back to the Battlefront and he has Uriah carry a written message to joab the Army commander and in it in the message that he has Uriah carry Jacob David directs joab to put Uriah into the thickest of the fighting and then withdraw and abandon him to be killed by the enemy so we not only violate uriah's wife he makes Uriah carry his death notice without even knowing it joab does this Uriah is killed joab sends a messenger to David telling of uriah's death David tells joab to keep quiet about it saying well the sword devoureth one as well as another and encourages joab to fight on and take the ammonite City uriah's wife baath Sheba learns of the death of her husband and goes into mourning at the end of the time of mour David sends for her and she becomes another of his men many wives she gives birth to an unnamed son the result of her pregnancy by David David pretends nothing ever happened cover up reminds me of a bit of something that was called Watergate back about 50 years ago in my lifetime let's see what happens afterward from chapter 12 which will be the last chapter that we draw from this evening 2 Samuel 12 verse1 and the Lord sent Nathan unto David and Nathan came unto him and said unto David there were two men in one city one was rich David this guy was just dirty rich the other guy was dirt poor the rich man had many flocks and herds the poor man had nothing but but he had one little you lamb which he had bought and nourished up they grew up together with him and with his children it it ate of of of this man's food drank of his own cup lay in his bosom was unto him as a daughter she he really loved this little lamb she was greatly loved and there came a traveler unto the rich man and and the rich man spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd I've got 10,000 I don't want to have 99,999 to dress to prepare a meal for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it he stole the poor man's you and slaughtered it for the man that was come to visit him why simply because he could reminds me of events 30 years ago in the White House and Clinton's remorseful statement was I did it simply because because I could power so David's anger was greatly kindled kindled means inflame you start a fire with kindling before it bursts into big Flames was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that has done this thing shall surely die he shall restore the lamb fourfold because a he did this thing and B because because he had no pity and Nathan said to David Thou Art the man look in the mirror David you not only took the you representing basba you also had zero pity but killed Uriah all David simply because you could thus saith the Lord God of Israel I anointed thee King over Israel I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul I gave thee thy Master's house and thy Master's wives into thy bosom and gave Thee the house of Israel and of Judah and if that had been too little David if that wasn't good enough I would moreover have given unto thee other things such and such things wherefore in light of all of this David why hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight and thou has killed Uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with not your own sword but you use the sword of the children of Ammon now therefore for because of this the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou Hast what what did you do David you've despised me the Lord you ignored my commands to a King and has taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to be thy wife thus saeth the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of the son not hidden for thou did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son in plain sight openly and David said in a massive understatement unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord Nathan said unto David the Lord also hath put away thy sin God has forgiven you David you're not going to die your sins forgiven but you're not going to go on punished Paul reminds us of this in Galatians 6 be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap he that Seth to his flesh shall reap of the flesh corruption he that Seth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting back to 2 Samuel how be it your con consequences here David because by this deed thou Hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme David you have really messed up your testimony the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die innocent child didn't do anything his life will be forfeit and Nathan departed un to his house and the Lord who the Lord struck the child that uriah's wife bear unto David and it was very sick well David fasts and prays for the child which after all is innocent after seven days of illness the unnamed son the baby dies David he's been fasting he's been praying he gets up cleanses himself sits down to eat doesn't mourn his staff are surprised then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou Hast done thou do fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou just rise and and eat bread and David said while the child was yet alive I fasted and wept I said who can tell whether God will be gracious to me that the child may live live but now he's dead why should I fast can I bring him back again I shall go to him but he shall not return to me verse 24 David comforted bath Sheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her and she bear a son and he called his name Solomon in Hebrew schomo means peaceful and the Lord loved him and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet and he called his name yadia meaning beloved of yah because of the lord we often think that Solomon was conceived and born shortly after the death of the first baby but the listings found elsewhere suggest that he was the fourth living son that David had by ba Sheba in Jerusalem who was several years later later see 2 Samuel 5:14 and especially 1st Chronicles 3:5 for the list of his sons by Beth Sheeba and in both cases the fourth name is Solomon implying that he was the fourth born chapter 12 and thus the first half of 2 Samuel ends in a flashback to the time shortly before or shortly after uriah's death joab defeating R Rabbi the Royal City of the ammonites joab AB summons David to come and finish the job so the credit for the victory will go to David and not to joab David does so David is a very complex person he's not the two-dimensional child hero with a sling killing Goliath that we picture him from Sunday school or on a flannel graph we saw how he loved the Lord danced with all his might yet in Moab we saw he could be cruel and hard he was willing to kill one of his best warriors to hide his own sin quick to see and rail against sin and others I don't know about you but I can certainly see myself reflected in many of David's shortcomings Lord help me to see and overcome my many faults if the musicians would please come we saw how David's desire to elevate the Lord to build build a better place for the ark than a mere tent led to one of the clearest Prophecies of the coming Messiah we've seen so far in our review of the books of the Bible not just a prophet like me as Moses said but now is revealed to be the son of Jehovah to rule an everlasting Kingdom we saw in the Book of Ruth where one from a despised people the Lord didn't want in the congregation Rose to become an ancestor of David and through the prophecy recorded in 2 Samuel 7 an ancestor of the Messianic line here we see a victim of an act of selfishness and sin the victim becomes another ancestor of the Messiah ba Sheba the third of only three male ancestors of Jesus adoptive parents recorded in the gospel of Matthew the only three ladies that we know of Rahab Ruth basba you may recall when we concluded the Book of Genesis I said that the theme of Genesis could be summed up in one word Grace we see the first half of 2 Samuel and we'll see in the second half next Wednesday evening Lord willing see the prophecy against David in chap 12: 10 and 11 fulfilled in the second half but I think all of second Samuel can be summarized with the same declaration it's about God's grace it's all about him the love unmar favor bestowed upon us through the Redemptive Act of Calvary as brother Daniel Comes to close the service tonight let's worship with the song marvelous Grace marvelous grace of our loveing Lord Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt Yonder on calvary's Mount outpour there where the blood of the Lamb was spilled Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that will pardon and cleanse within Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that is greater than all our sin dark is a stain that we can not hide what can Avail to Wash It Away look there is Flowing a crimson TI quieter than snow ye may be today Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that will pardon and cleanse Within Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that is greater than all our sin marvelous infinite matchless grace freely bestowed on all who Bel all who are longing to see his face will you this moment his grace receive Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that will harden and cleanse within Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that greater than all our [Music] sins makes me feel very sad it's story brother the ly closed on and we all know it but how Uriah the wonderful man one of David's Mighty Men how David took his wife and and then he goes goes to the Prophet The Prophet tells him that story and do you see how David judged and David said that man will die but do you see how God came in and Nathan said David you are that man and you're not going to die and I thought it was beautiful how I don't know how many times I've read that story brother a while and I I see David and and I know that he stopped fasting when the when the boy died and and then he eats and he says I can't bring him back he says but I'm going to go see him one day and I thought that's just that's beautiful to think how David and so many of us as brother said there are consequences to our sin those consequences aren't necessarily hell because of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and and the blood that was shed on Calvary but when we sin in the flesh we will answer for our sins in the flesh there are consequences that we have to pay just because we have come to the altar we've given our hearts to the Lord we've repented of those sins there are still consequences to those sins and that story of David I don't understand how David could be a man after God's Own Heart and such a tremendous tremendous story of David and a tremendous character but how he could have done some of the things that he did tell you the truth by the while I just don't understand it but I do in that whole story as brother Lyall said I see such Grace such Grace from the Lord Jesus and I love the way David he didn't deny it he didn't say he didn't try to make excuses he just said I have sinned and he just threw himself there at the altar of God and God had mercy on him brother Joe would you come up and close in prayer let's all stand I do appreciate brother Lyle's sermon and uh it's a very hard thing to tell some of these stories but I just both of you come up here come here come here both of you no both of you come up that was my fault come up here you told me a testimony the other day right good God bless you God bless you my name is brother Joe as well there's not many of us but yes I I was speaking with brother Dan um maybe last Wednesday night and just shared briefly a testimony and he uh it struck him and he said you know maybe I get you to share that with the church uh it was let me think I guess it was 20 2019 and I was in a uh coffee shop and uh a gentleman came up to me uh and asked me if I was um Joe coffee and I said I I was and he said he had sent me a message on LinkedIn saying that um introd ucing himself and he was a writer and he was looking I work in marketing and he was uh looking for some employment and some advice and so he had reached out to me on LinkedIn and uh asked for uh you know a meeting with me and he recognized me in that coffee shop he came up to me and and asked me if I was a Joe coffee and I said I was and he wanted to to speak and I said I'd be happy to chat with you I I can't speak with you at this very moment cuz I was just about to have a meeting but I said when I'm done I'll come over over to you and I'll uh be happy to chat with you so I had my meeting and and just me being the way I am I I just uh just honestly forgot about the guy and I walked out of there and um just it didn't come back to my mind to to go over to him and finish the conversation and so the next day I was at my desk working and the Lord just brought it back to my remembrance about this this gentleman and so I felt I felt bad and rather than just you know forget about it um I did what I could and I went back to my LinkedIn messages and I thought maybe I can find this guy and and follow up with him that way so I did and I was going down to the messages and I I I the man was from somewhere like in India or Bangladesh or maybe that part of the world and so I was looking for somebody that that looked like looked like that and and so the first person I saw in my messages that resembled that I said oh that must be him so I I sent I sent him a message and I said uh sorry about forgetting to walk up to you and finish the conversation why don't you uh give me a call at this number and and we can chat so a little bit later my phone rings and so I I answered and I said are you the guy from the coffee shop that I forgot to follow up with and he said no so I realized I had contacted the wrong person on on LinkedIn this wasn't the person you know from the coffee shop and again I just I felt instead of just ending the call I I said well you've called me and we're talking and uh you obviously were also in my LinkedIn messages so why don't you tell me about yourself why why were you contacting me and so he introduced himself his name was Vel Shaw and he gave me a quick overview of of what he did for a living and and why he had contacted me and I I said okay that's you know nice to chat with you I I really didn't have any further business with him and and we hung up and I went further down through my messages and I found the the guy from the coffee shop and I I settled that and dealt with it but what was interesting was was that um I guess a few weeks later maybe this this this gentleman Vel who I never should have talked to it was a accidental uh call really he came back to my mind and and because he had mentioned a certain type of work that he did and uh so suddenly I needed that kind of a skill set and so I I reached out to him and I said I might have a project that we could work together on and uh he was at the time he was underemployed uh he's a very bright person who was uh doing a master's of business um at our University and he was working at a gas station um at night and he was he was in a very low Point uh making minimum wage and um he had he had already uh he had converted from Hinduism to Christianity to nominal Christianity and he was going to a Pentecostal Church in our area and he was just feeling drier and drier and drier spiritually and he was just just going through a really dark time and so he he was about to leave uh Newland and and and but then we met you know in this really accidental way and so when I said to him here's a project would you like to you know I was testing him um and he was just desperate for for gainful employment and so he he took the project and and he did an excellent job on it and I I just saw some real talent in this man and I gave him more more challenges and things and U then a monthly contract and and he he just started to really step up and contribute so we were we were on a call with a potential customer and the the customer the prospect said you know if you're in our area we should go out for a beer and I you know I don't always do it but you know I try to take those opportunities to drop a little seed amen and I said to the prospect I said well I I don't drink beer but I I like black coffee and you know if if I'm in the area we can grab a coffee and so that was just a little little witness and and when we hung up Vel called me and he said uh he said I don't I don't drink beer either because I I didn't know anything about V really uh at that point just that he was good at you know certain types of work and uh that just that previous night I had got down and I had asked the Lord to confirm for me if Vel was somebody that he had sent my way that he had put me in my path or if it was just kind of my own thoughts that that this person was special and that very next day we had this call with this Prospect and when when he called me and he said you know I don't drink beer either I said to him well I don't the reason why I don't drink alcohol is because I'm a Christian and he said so am I I'm a Christian and right then that prayer came back to my mind and I said Thank You Lord that's that's the the reassurance I needed that if I show is somebody special you know because I really I was also praying can I trust this person and you know should I start to try to pull him in closer and closer uh in in in our work you know and so that that was a a turn turning point for he and I and he started to ask me questions about where do you go to church and so I told him and and we were having special meetings that weekend and so I invited him to come come to those meetings and that Sunday morning he was sitting in in the church with me and you know with the congregation and I you know the the message was being preached and I I thought how's how is this going you know U just wondering how he was receiving it all and and so we were after that we had a fellowship and I was driving to the my parents home with him for this fellowship and I said to him what did you think of the service and and he he said I've been asking the Lord to lead me to a church where the focus is the new birth and the Rapture amen and I just I was astounded I just said well brother you you are in the right place like that that like you know that's really all all we uh talk about it always comes back to those two things and so he just kept coming to church and and just remember this is a wrong number this this this this should have never happened you know um just a total accident and you know we he he was he was very um diligent in his uh evaluation of the message he didn't just dive in and accept it all and you know he wanted to understand it he wanted to see it for himself and so he went through a year or more of of scrutinizing and asking a lot of questions and uh doing his own study and so forth and the Lord was dealing with him and um I guess the end of the story or or you know not not the end of it but uh the next big milestone was he wanted to be baptized in in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and so I I personally baptized him and and he just his testimony was so beautiful that he gave to the church because he just told us what a how he was just coming to the end of of himself during that time and just through that encounter God turned his whole life around you know he went from working at a gas station to working in his field and being challenged and and the the church uh that he was looking for the fellowship and the warmth of the Believers and the word and all these things uh he just immediately went from day like from night to day and and he he all of his uh everything that he'd been praying God just in a moment uh gave it all to him so he he continues to grow in the faith and and he's a trustee now in our church and he he's just such a help and a blessing and and we can't imagine you know not having him so it's just it's just the grace of grace of God and I just encourage you to you know God has placed you in your job or in your neighborhood uh or maybe in an accidental place at some you know accidental time he he'll put you in a situation with somebody just to be a light and a witness and it could be something so simple but God can do something so big just just through you and and your simple testimony God bless you amen wow I was all sad it's all torn up and as I like the way he says and uh um my name is Joe [Laughter] too but you see how brother Joe was a wrong number it was a mistake wow that he made and look at the mistake of David David made a mistake he did something wrong and God took that mistake and brought probably the greatest King that had ever been the most prosperous King in David's son Solomon from that Union with basheba and Solomon built the first temple of God all from a mistake and as always listening to our brother's testimony my the The Joy just returned to me saying no God can take a mistake and turn it around and use it for his glory amen brother Joe if you could [Music] close hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah let's Close Our Eyes let's make it real melodic for him in the key you want it doesn't have to match let it be God's sound coming from your voice reach the Jesus inside of you and reach out to the Jesus outside of [Music] you Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's not about you well I was Joe in this church for a while and now there's many Joe's there's many Rachels there's many Johnson's there's many there's many many people here it's it's not about as many Daniels it's not about you it's not about you hallelujah it's not about you and uh some of us have really good lives and don't understand why the book of Samuel is about David I do I do and and uh look back on all these mistakes such horrible mistakes and Jesus Christ has blessed every single one of them bringing me a son bringing me a family bringing me bringing me a church bringing everything from every mistake I've made even bringing me up here you're not Joe you're Jesus Christ Even in our family I was Joe in the family and then another sister married and Joey and he has Jose my son's Joseph I'm not even Joe and my family so you kind of relate to the Bible and well you think Joseph of Many Colors Joseph the father of Jesus or the the many Joseph's there it's better to identify in J Jesus Christ it's better to identify in that name that it's not about you it's about his purpose and what's going to be happening in his he's he's training Us in in in all these chapters of the Bible we know the Bible we've read the Bible but we're bringing it together and reading it together and understanding it together and understanding these pieces together because we're going somewhere and he's using us for something that's why he's building this church and that's why he's building the strength in the people in this church in you not not the people around in you Jesus Christ is working in you and because of that let's worship him just one more time and then we'll go back to our prayer oh hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelu hallelu [Music] hallelujah hallelujah I first sung Hallelujah that song at the top of my voice in a mental hospital and I sang it to the person who taught it to me from this church we listened it to it together and that person came to themselves because of that song and we came back and then we created another church child that living breathing person exists because of that song that restored my family all the mistakes that I've made in my life God has used each and every one of them I am blessed and you are blessed and we know this and in this
