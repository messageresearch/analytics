believe all things are possible Lord I be all right you may be seated God bless you our heavenly father this is Thy word it is said in the book in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so if the word was God is still God so we're thankful to have the word before us tonight now we realize that this book has been written in such a way that you've hid it from all the scholars the wise and prudent and you said you would reveal it to babes such as would learn now we're willing to learn tonight that's why we're here and we're here expecting the great teacher to come and teach us tonight the things that we should know the holy spirit of God and sanctify our hearts tonight father move back all doubts and fears and may the great Holy Spirit just come right down and speak to our hearts each one of us and save all the the Sinners Lord that's uh unkind to you we pray that you'll just deal with their hearts tonight the backsliders bring them back home father and we pray that you'll heal the sick get Glory out of the service for we ask it in Jesus name amen and Luke the 7th chapter and the 36th verse I'll just read one verse and when you go home tonight perhaps you read the rest of this chapter it's very outstanding and I'll just read this just to start with the 36th verse and one of the Pharisees uh I like this to begin with um desired him that he would sit with him at at me and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet I may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of that word um of a story that happened long years ago now the uh I love the Lord Jesus with with all my heart and I know you do too so now while we're talking let's just open up our hearts let the Holy Spirit come in and speak to us now there's something wrong here in the beginning with our text tonight there's just something it's not right what did this Pharisee want with Jesus you know usually man ask you to come eat with them when they love you and they want to sit down and have some fellowship with you and um usually that's the way Brother Joseph and I has a lot of Fellowship we get out here to one of these places and get us a hamburger and some french fries and we have a lot of Fellowship over those hamburgers we love each other and but what could this fairy want with Jesus he hated Jesus and why was he asking uh Jesus to come eat with him one the Pharisees didn't like Jesus they didn't they didn't believe in him and they hated him and why would the Pharisee ask Jesus to come eat with him there's just something wrong somewhere they just don't cooperate together when the Pharisees hated them so bad and here one of the chief Pharisees is asking to come eat dinner with him come to one of these a great banquet he's going to have and eat with him there too much difference there that's the way it is just no uh people usually that hang around together while they have fellowship with each other when they got things in common now if you got things in common like a uh a little children they they play with each other they have things in common the Bible speaks of that Isaiah said the little children playing in the street now when you see little children they all maybe one can speak German the other can speak Swedish the other English but they got a lot of things in common because they're children they spend their tops and play with their dolls and things they've got things in common when you see a little like a little girl hanging around with Grandma there something wrong there now when you see a little girl hanging around with Grandma there's too much difference in their age now there's something wrong either she's Grandma's pet or she maybe grandma might have a sack of candy in her pocket you see so might be some reason there that some motive as that little girl is hanging around with Grandma because there's too much difference in their age now young people have things and they associate together and have things in common and the middle age have things in common and and the old people have things in common and like clubs the Kanas they have things in common they like to get together and eat together the Kanas Club because they talk about the Affairs of the city and how taking care of the poor and so forth they have things in common as my mother used to say the old proverb birds of a feather flock together there's a whole lot to that did you know that that's why you all are here tonight that's why we' together tonight we got things in common that's why you're not out to Road houses and picture shows tonight you you come here to the Church of God tonight we got things in common we like to talk over things and have Fellowship one with another we all believe in the same thing we got the same purpose that's why all these ministers are sitting around here and so forth we got and that's why that spirit is moving Among Us like it is we have things in common Jesus you know when the Holy Ghost fell they were in one place and one Accord everything in common they were waiting for the Holy Ghost to come they had things in common everyone was waiting for the promise of the father and that's why we are here tonight we are have things in common because Jesus said wherever two three are gathered together in my name I'll be in their midst and whatever they ask I'll give it to them so now we have things in common we believe in the Full Gospel we believe in the Holy Spirit we believe in the second coming of Jesus we believe in Divine Healing that's why we've all gathered around the have we got things in common birds of a feather we flock together I'm so glad to have your kind of feathers and so we can have this Fellowship now that is true the old proverb birds of a feather you ever notice you take for instance crows and doves they don't have any fellowship with each other because why their diet is different they couldn't invite one another to dinner because the crow is a scavenger he just eats on an old dead carcass somewhere and the dove doesn't have any Gall so if it eat that stuff it would kill it of The Sinner and the Christian I mean when he's a a Christian see now the dove will sit down in the wheat field and eat all day long with her kind and coup and the old crow will sit over there on a no dead carcass and call and eat all day long see they don't have no fellowship at all but now the strange thing is if the dove would go eat on the on the dead carcass it would kill the dove but the crow can eat there and also eat the wheat also that makes him a Hypocrites see so you have to watch that we have to watch that see the the dove the real true Christian cannot go over and indulge in the world but the hypocrite can be a low down hypocrite and be a sinner now and go out and act like a Christian that's bad that's real bad but the real Christian can't come over here and partake in this he hasn't got any go he can't digest the things amen I hope you know what I mean and I'm not trying to hurt your feelings Center but that's right that's just what it is he couldn't go in a barroom and drink and go out and Gamble and things like that he he just hasn't got the gall to digest it that's all something else has t place he's been changed he's had an operation amen God laid him out on the operating table and took the gall out of him when he give him the Holy Ghost and he just can't take those things no more that's right so he can't have Fellowship but something's wrong with the picture when this Pharisee now to my opinion the crow but he's he's trying to bring Jesus down there to have like you wanted fellowship with him but there's something wrong it just won't work the first thing you know what Pharisee means the word Pharisee means actor the Greek word for Pharisee means the actor somebody who acts put on you know America's so full of that anyhow Act I preach in Los Angeles my next meeting is down in Los Angeles and I noticed there you take the people the screen people there the movies and so forth they're before the camera so much to their acting like somebody else impersonating somebody and they dose so much of it before the camera that when they get on the street they're still actors you know that's not only in Hollywood that's that's in Chicago too you just look at televisions and movies and things like that then you try to act like that you Pharisee quit doing that not right you shouldn't be that I don't like that stuff I like I like to be original don't you just be yourself and you know a lot of times that's among [Music] preachers but that's true actors they get in a pull pit and then they get a pull pit voice you know Brethren oh you Pharisee quit acting like that talk be yourself people like you better if you just be yourself oh but they have a pull pit voice and a street voice I like when you be this on a pull pit Like You on the street be the same person don't be a Pharisee you know and some of our sisters get that on them too act in home they say jump Tom jumps like he was shock get out of here you know better than that how' you do that far the telephone rings pick up the receiver oh [Music] hello Pharisee stop doing that be original be yourself oh I don't like a putt on I like to be genuine I like to see people who genuine I was enjoying that beautiful holy ghost singing a while ago you see a lot of actors and singing that's right I've seen singers I went to a place one time and see an overtrained voice overtrained hold a note till they're blue in the face and hold on for dear life and come back down making an argle and don't even know what they're saying EST that's no good they're not singing to the glory of God to me I love oldfashioned Pentecostal singing hands up in the air and singing to the glory of God you lose the organ piano and everything else and just sing to the glory of God Amen turn loose and be yourself yes I love original the glory of God there's nothing closer to heaven and hearing that uh real beautiful singing don't you believe S I was sitting behind that curtain a while ago wiping tears out my eyes when I heard those Brothers sing and peeped around the curtain see the glory of God on their face who my is any life in you that'll sure bring it to top right but when you get this where you have to go that way Y and hold on and turn blue in the face you're just just trying to get somebody hear you D I like real sing I like to be yourself not an actor Pharisee that's bad sun was almost going down I seen standing there this Courier had run all day long his feet was dirty and his face full of sweat his master had said to him now you must find he crossed Palestine trying to find him the sun was almost down thousands were sitting listening to One speak that never a man spoke like him people were standing on their tiptoes looking over they could only see and I can see The Courier who has come from this Rich Pharisees house looking over to see if he on his tiptoes to see what he could see after a while he quit speaking then he began to minister to the sick oh I'd love to been there wouldn't you I can see this Courier making his way through the crowd till he gets up and he bumps into somebody who's standing there wouldn't let him go any farther might have been philli or Nathaniel or one of them I don't know who it was somebody was standing there and he bumped into said I would like to speak to your master sir and being busy keeping the people away from Jesus so he could pray one at a time I can imagine him plac him back to stand aside and leave the master alone he's busy and um then he pushed on again he said but I have a message from my master a very prominent man in our country I must see your master and I can see them the Philip probably take him up to where Jesus was and he politely bowed before him and he gave him the message my master Master uh Pharisee Simon the Pharisee who's a great man he's great in the church and you'll be honored sir and he is sent for you to come on a certain certain date to his banquet and he's going to have a great feast and he's a rich man and he's all he can put on the real kind of Fe and you're invited to come could you imagine what Peter would say to him about like I would have said are you oh Jesus that Pharisee he just making a trump card out of you why you he don't need you he's got all the wealth of this world that he needs and and he don't have any need for you he's just going down there and make a show make a make you a show card that's all don't go look at the thousands here that's calling for you your time is needed here don't go with that down to that Pharisee perhaps Andrew run up said Jesus don't do that Master don't go down there but yet all the persuading that they could do Jesus politely I can see bow his head and say I will be there Jesus is never invited unless he comes just remember that if you want him into your house invite him he'll come no matter who you are how rich or how poor how bad off or how well off he'll come if you'll invite him he never turns down an invitation Jesus never did and he never will so they see he bow he and the CER sigh a little bit and oh brush back his hair out of his dirty face and back down across Palestine he'd go to take his to take his message back down how could he ever do it what was the matter with that CER that runner flunky from his master's house how could he have done it i' have said something different from that wouldn't you if IID ever got in the presence of Jesus I'd have fell at his feet first and have worshiped him but that's what's the matter with too many of us couriers today we've got to talk about our denomination talk about everything that we belong to and forget about being in the presence of Jesus we got too many things to think about other things that interest us seemingly more than Jesus how a dignity and how we can conduct ourselves and how we can make our voice sound and how we can put on this program and that program forget it what we need is get in the presence of Jesus and worship him sometimes we have a Revival and the L's agid got to put on there's and this has got to do this and this has got to do that the first thing you know there's no room for Jesus we so teared up with all of our societies and things that we forget what the Revival's about let's don't do that in Chicago this week let's invite him and and worship him when he comes when we get his presence forget about who you are what are you anyhow six foot of Earth that's right worth 84 cents if you weigh 150 lbs not very much to you anyhow so then here he was up there in the presence of jesus carried out his master's orders the man he was talking to would be his judge some day and he failed to recognize it and in these meetings where the Holy Spirit comes down and speaks to the people shows signs and wonders and heels of blind death dumb paralytics and so forth people turn away sometimes well we They Carried that church too late tonight Pharisee what's the matter with you you're in the presence of Christ if you can ever be sure that you see his Works moving you ought to fall on your face and say God be merciful to me but we got time for other things oh I wish should hurry up and quit preaching 20 minutes is long enough for any preacher to preach wow you you're starving to death you're send you look like a shadow you need a good 4our sermon sometime fatting you up on gospel vitamins that's what the church needs today just quit you put your pastor fellow said the other day there's no place for jokes I don't believe it but he said he preached the sermon for 10 years 20 minutes as all the people are let him preach and he had to time himself to 20 minutes and one Sunday he preached about an hour the deacons called him back and said pastor why'd you do that far I said well my time machine didn't work right said what was it said well when I start to preach I put a LIF saer in my mouth and it always takes me just 20 minutes to suck it down and said I missed it this morning put a button in my mouth never did get it out oh my what we need today is some good old button sermons amen don't be in a hurry that fellow as soon as he could get his message out and what he was there for his motives was just a please his master and the way he went hallelujah what we need today is hold on stay there here he goes had to go all the way down in Palestine oh I can see that big Pharisee when he come back and told him that Jesus said he would come I can see him walking up on his great Persian rugs in his floor rubbing his little fat chubby hands and I did not think of that before said my I'm going to have a big banquet everybody knows I'm Simon the Pharisees oh I'm so religious they still got him oh you know I'm the doctor of the church everybody in this city looks at me and they know that I'm a religious man because I am Pastor Simon the Pharisee that great big fat rly poly Pharisee walking up and down the floor trying to get my Lord Jesus there why he ain't no Prophet why certainly is not all we faires know there's nothing to him it's mental telepathy if I could ever get him down here and bring in what will Pharisee Jones say about that oh won't it be a joke and Pharisee Jones hears that I've got that there so-called Prophet down here for my meeting won't he won't he be a surprise when he sees that this year Jesus of Nazareth has come down to my meeting now to my banquet I tell you what I'll do I won't have it inside I put it outside because you know I can really fix a dinner a real dinner the people around here all poor and everything but that man was rich brother he got the cuts at the temple besides his salary and he could really put on a feast and so he he was worthy he had plenty of money he was a rich man and he said then the public if I can get them all up here in front of my place out on The Veranda somewhere I'll fix it out there and I'll put my table and those grap clusters of grapes it's just now ripe and everything you smell good and I'll have it in the evening it'll be cool and all how it all had it all planned out how it was going to fix it and have everything just to the place and I'll take my table and Scoot it out there and and I'll have all the Dr Jones and Dr PhD so and so and so and so and I'll have them all over and then all the people of the city will know that I am a great man I can do this and I can do this I I I what's an awful habit people have isn't it I I I God has no place in it at all oh all he could do how he ought to have thought of that before to get this this appointment with Jesus now he said I'll push my table out now in in the oran you almost have to be there to know how they eating things now uh you know a lot of the little children for instance this little boy here setting his front the little checked shirt on he's leaning over on his hand like this P mama knows that he likes to eat that way too yeah at the table he likes to lay over on his on his arm now I got little children home too and I know they like to eat like that did you know what you're right Mama trying to make you sit up like this but that's the way they used to do it a long time ago that's way Jesus eat see they didn't sit out at the table like we do they have a big table and then and when they do they kind of scoot a couch in angle WS like this and everyone instead of sitting down he goes down here sits down the end of the couch and lays down and puts his hand up like this and eats that way that's the way you like is it yes sir well that's the way Jesus eat that's the way they eat in Palestine and those they still do now had this table out there and oh could they serve my they could really serve and they some of those um uh people in Palestine they even was rich enough them Pharisees to have Indian waitress which a waiters is which there they're the most famous in the world and they had on shoes that little bell on the end that they could they'd play music as they walked and could they know how to put it on they put the platter in their hand like this and they would have lamb cooked with spice stuff real good and oh my they bring it out and the poor would stand on the eyes side smelling that odor and they'd serve it in such a way just make you hungry to look at it so they know how to put it on and them Pharisees know how to do it so this fell was no exception he knew how to put on a real feast so then he get everything ready and get all fixed up ready for the people to come well finally the the evening Drew near that when they was going to have the banquet and the first thing you know as soon as everything was fixed up in the out in the plaza and in the yard under the Clusters and everything was just to its place just where it ought to be just everything so SP and span a great ch drove up outside and Dr Jones I hope there's not a Dr Jones here tonight but anyhow he got out of the Chariot and my you know the the be the hospitality of Palestine as soon as he you get out of the The Chariot or wherever you come if you're invited the host when he invites you well then you come the first thing most of the travel is by foot and when Dr Jones got out course first Pharisee went and greet him hello Dr Jones I'm so happy to see you why enter into my place and up com another Chariot and the groomers taking their horses and put them in the stables and fed them and so forth and taking care of and then if someone come on foot they all those Pharisees had a lot of flunkies around their place one fellow to do one thing and one another and the first thing when you entered into the place the lowest most paid flunky of a whole bunch was a foot washer the first thing you did when you walked into a place you got your feet washed and I think of my Lord that's what proves to me he was God when he came from the highest position in heaven and become the lowest funky on the earth who do we think we are CA we own a change of clothes the god of Heaven came down and became a flunky the worst paid person in the category of the homes was a foot washer and Jesus my Lord became a foot washer and who are you now and who am I what are we so big about when we can ride in a big fine car and everything and stick our nose up and think we're somebody and the god of Heaven become a flunky foot waser shame on us what a Pity is customarily the first man that met the man when he was invited the hospitality of the orent in Palestine in those days there was um when the travel was by foot they didn't have paved streets like you got here and they had Dusty roads and um uh the palestin garment comes down as a Rob but the underneath garment buttons just uh below the knees and uh when they had robes on and sandals in those days if they could for sandals or they walk barefooted and their travel was by foot and when they would um uh along those little old trails and things where they walk um many Caravans and animals went down the trail and the droppings from their animals the birds would Peck in it and then the twisted around on the road and it would the dust it would dry and it would get Dusty and the Trav were walking like this while the dust would rooll would pick it up it get on his feet and all that um droppings from the animal and along the roads and stink and a person's feet was dirty and really needed washing before they could come into a nice home like they had there this Pharisees house so the custom was that they would bring um the foot wash uh flunky he would come out and when the man came he would take his foot and put it up under his arm like this remove his sandal wash his feet take a towel and wipe him set his sandals up on a place and reach over and get a pair of satin slippers like which that was courtesy of the host that ided him and he Tri on his feet until he got the the ones that would fit him just right and and then the next thing he would pass him on when he come back out he pull off the slippers walking all those fine rugs and things and he would be refreshed by his feet now the next thing the Palestinian Sun the direct rays of there make a real hot and blisters of face and they had oil that they would anoint and the next man when he come into a little place while they would anoint you your hands give you some or and you'd rub that put it on your neck and around your face like that and it was soothing now Oro will get old in a few days we know that but they had some sort of a little bean it comes out of Arabia like a rose when it's done and there's a little apple there and you can take that little apple and put it in your hand and rub it and it goes so deep into your pores with perfume until weeks you can still smell it on your hands and they would take that and make a perfume and put it in this anointing oril that they use to anoint their face that was part of the treasures that the uh the Queen of Sheba brought to Solomon very expensive sper so they did anoint the face and so forth now had his feet washed and dried and slippers put on and all the stink of the road was off of him and now the Rays of the sun he would rubed his face real good and Tuck a towel and wipe the oil from it now the next courtesy the host showed when he walked into the door as he went in while the host would be standing there when his visitor came and when he came up to the door he would reach over and get him by the right hand and he would kiss him on one side of the cheek then take him by the other hand and kiss him on the other side of the cheek now when he was kissed he was welcome he was a full brother then he felt welcome he could go in go the ice box get what he wanted he was at home he was kissed welcome well then all these Pharisees and things taking their place the first thing you know we look around and find setting over in the corner Jesus how could it happen what was the matter with the funky at the door he was sitting there with unwashed feet unano head not kissed he wasn't made wellcome why Pharisees Simon the Pharisee was too busy cracking jokes with Doctor Jones and all of them he didn't have time he let Jesus slip by and get in and the flunky let him slip by oh I wish I could tuck that flunky's place an opportunity to wash Jesus feet and to anointed him and made him welcome that's the way it is he invited him and then didn't make him welcome that's what we do we invite him and then won't make him welcome when the president would come to this city or any City you'd hang out the streets full of flags you'd stroll the streets of flowers you'd send the band down to the to the depot where he got off the train you do everything to make him welcome but Jesus can come to your city into your home and you'll give him a place in the Attic a little prayer room out in the CER maybe down in the basement if your compan is there you have nothing to do with him you wait till last your while maybe he's at the house you slip up in an attic and shut the door and say a few little words to him and come back down ashamed of him that's the way Simon was he was ashamed of him will you come anyhow Jesus yeah will you take second place yeah I'll take second place I'll take any place to give me remember not long ago when you went to church before you was saved of course on Easter Sunday in you wore your gorgeous go dress your beautiful little Easter hat set on the side of your head you went out and struggled through a 20 minute sermon and come back and hung it up and said that's enough religion for this year Jesus didn't rebuke you for it he accepted it you give it to him whatever you want to give him what little time he'll take it he never rebuked you and you asked him to come to your church sometime and he'll fall in a old passioned way and you're ashamed to let loose let him have his way you quench him away you invite him to your home and then you're ashamed of him before your neighbors let him sit there unentertained Jesus wants to be worshiped he wants to be entertained how do you entertain Jesus say come Lord Jesus Come into my heart I love you Lord entertain him if someone come at your house and you didn't entertain them they wouldn't come many time time maybe that's what's the matter tonight maybe that's what's the matter around our homes around our churches we are afraid or ashamed to entertain Jesus you're afraid somebody hear you say Amen you're afraid to raise up your hands and give him praise you're ashamed cuz your neighbor sitting there somebody else why I care about your neighbor Worship the Lord you asked him you invited him than worship him when he comes hallelujah what we need tonight is an oldfashioned Jesus Christ entertaining place where men and women can forget their themselves and entertain Jesus but he comes anyhow if you just give him five minutes a day over in a closet down in the basement he'll take it he'll take whatever you offering he'll take it that shows to me he's God to me amen you know big men act little little peanut brain acts big when you see a guy that thinks you something just remember there's nothing to him I've got with some of the biggest man in the world and they make you think you're the big man when you get away from them but some of these guys that's got to change the clothes or something other Pastor something other or some big church while they want you to think there's something big that's the person becomes nothing notice Jesus had entered this Pharisees home I believe he left a little early he's never late and Jesus always keeps his appointment Hallelujah Jesus is here tonight Jesus keeps his appointments no matter how where you are he kept his appointment with Jonah in the belly of a whale he kept his in the Lion's Den he kept his appointment with the children in the Hebrew children in the fire furnace praise God he kept his appointment with me on the deathbed he's here tonight wherever two or three are gather together in my name I'll be in their midst Jesus keeps his appointments always he leaves Glory maybe a little early so he can get here on time he keeps his appointments and here he is setting in this Pharisees house and got walked in the door and nobody paid any attention to him they were too busy and that's what we are today we're too busy making proales we're too busy to see if this person's baptized correct or not we're too busy to see what position he has and what we could do with him in the church we're too busy with the people and the things of the church and let Christ come by without entertaining him we were too busy to see that the everything's carried on just so and so we failed to entertain Jesus after we have invited him to our place many times you're too busy home in your home life you got to so many things you have to do you can't take time to pray just too busy that's what happened there oh I wish I could have been that flumpy there at the door if I know his coming brother I'd have had the pan of water and waiting but before I wash his feet I say Lord I'm not worthy to wash to worship you after you wash your feet let me worship you first oh I'd love to have done it but there he sets unwelcome think of it unwelcome sitting over in the corner nobody paying any attention to him and Pharisee too busy with his doctor friend he didn't notice Jesus sitting over in a corner and he's sitting with his head down you know I'd imagine he never feels very welcome around there are rich people that don't want to entertain him he said he feels more at home with the people who was willing to himself entertain there he is sitting with his head back his disciples Standing Outside they could wasn't invited so they couldn't come in you had to be really had to be invited to be in one of those Banquets but the disciples couldn't come and here he is sitting over there in the corner nobody paying any attention to him he's so uncomfortable you think that's the way he would be here tonight if he'd come you think that's the way he is in your home uncomfortable sitting there with dirty feet think of it Jesus with dirty feet they call him Jesus When I Think Jesus with dirty feet that does something to me to say it Jesus my Lord sitting in a religious house with dirty feet unwelcome parching cheeks unwelcome not kiss just welcome the very feet that was going to be pierced with the nails was sitting there dirty with dung from the road and swept all over his feet smelled and in that great fine home with his head bowed unwelcome nobody washed his feet oh I I wish I could be there wish I could have been there don't you I wish I could have been standing there oh how to run to him how'd that monkey let him get by I don't know unwashed feet dirty feet Jesus my Lord with dirty feet somebody neglected somebody has neglected their Duty and there he is sitting there oh so uncomfortable in the house nobody paying any attention to him and but dirty feet sming back the people passing by look on the outside there where all the Easter are Gap anyhow they was looking over to see Pharisee and smelling of their food and things the line draw they couldn't come no farther and Pharisee over there just a rejoicing with his friends and so forth and Jesus sitting there with dirty feet think of it I see walking along the side of the crowd on the outside a little woman with a veil over her face I hear somebody punch another and say look who's come up the Bible said that she was a awful sinner we won't have to go in detail about that she was a prostitute a foul woman listen sometimes you push them people back but remember somebody introduced her to that life before there can be a foul woman there has to be a foul man that's right maybe some boy uh fell in love with her and enticed her and made her promises and ruined her life and introduced her or such and then pushed her off to one side and run off to get some other woman that might have started her she's some mother's daughter I think oh we're so righteous though you know oh my we can't go down and talk to people like that if they don't live in the finest of homes and they have the best societies while we don't want to bring them into church brother Jesus said go the hes and byways and bring them in no matter who they are sometimes they're the ones who receive the kingdom of God before some of these stiff necked Soul Souls will there she comes by she's looking around someone say look look like come up to Pharisees dinner oh look who she is we know keep her distance she walks by she knows she's hated nobody that's shelf righteous go her give her stand back give her room but I see her go up and she looks over there and she sees him oh she says that can't be surely is that it that must be him well it is him and he's got he's not welcome he he's got dirty feet and he's unano and nobody's paying any attention to him she said it's surely somebody's got to do something something and I see her put her a little Shaw up around her and down the street she goes as hard as she can she goes up in a little creaky steps up into her little room and she goes into a little chest and gets out a little sock or something there with some money in it and she said she said no no no I I can't do this I can't do it and she starts weeping she said all those eyes how he looked over at me nobody can ever look at Jesus and ever be the same she said it I must be beside myself look I know he's a prophet and he'd know where I got this money he'd know how I got it I can't take this to him I just can't do it she puts it back she's weeping said oh think of it oh nobody wants him oh I've got to do something about it and she takes her little sock out again her little chest and she looks at it she said oh surely but it's all I got it's all I can do surely he'll understand I see her Puck her little money down in her bosom and throw her Shaw over down the street she goes and she goes into a little juice store down there where they're selling some sper and stuff in a perfume shop and she goes in and some old fell sting back there grouchy counting out his money M it's been a bad day didn't hardly make the rent oh my

Fountain you've got only Fountain anybody's got is make your way to Jesus if you have to Elbow your way through every denomination everything else get to him quickly oh my she got beside of him and she there said Jesus she took a hold of me she didn't know what to do she fell down before him she was weeping the tears was rolling down her cheeks and off her chin and the first thing you know she picked up his feet and she began to rub his feet she was so happy she was standing by the fountain she was standing by the only cleansing place that her soul could ever be cleansed she was standing by the only Fountain of Life that ever sprung up in the earth there she was in her condition she was rubbing his feet and the first thing you know she she got beside herself she didn't know what she was doing and she was crying the tears running off her cheek and she was rubbing his feet and she found herself washing Jesus dirty feet with her [Music] tears what a water washing Jesus dirty feet with her tears the greatest water that ever come the tears of a pent inent sinner washing the feet of the Lord Jesus I he wept and she was washing his feet she she was beside herself she didn't know what to do God help us to get beside herself long enough to get saved anyhow sure she broke all the rules of the party what was the party taking place now what we care what the party was doing how many rules she broke she was getting before Jesus and getting saved and that's what we need to do tonight is to get before Jesus and get saved no matter what you're breaking the rules of the regul that has nothing to do with it the thing of it is is get before Jesus and she was washing his feet with her tears and she was W first thing you know she was so excited she started to raise up and all of her hairs that she had pinned up on her head fell down and she be to wipe his feet with her with the hairs of her head it'll be a hard time for a lot of our Christian sisters to do that have to stand on their head to do it they got a hair a wifey seat with her that's right I don't say that for a joke but let me tell you something the Bible said a woman's hair is her glory yes sir look what a beautiful place that fit there her tears of repentance she was washing his feet and the only decent thing she had about her was her hair and her glory fell down Hallelujah her glory she was wiping jesus' feet with her Glory Hallelujah God let me everything around wipe his feet wash his feet worship him in the spirit do everything I can to make him welcome in my heart say dear Lord Jesus here take me and make me yours she was wiping his feet with her hairs of her head and the first thing you know she found herself kissing his feet and I tell you Pharisee Jones turn white and then red the devil really took a hold of him I can see oh what a rage he was breaking up his party it would ruin his church don't you know why he said look here if that man was a prophet he had know what kind of a woman that was around him listen well that would ruin his reputation no he's wrong Jesus reputation is made where Sinners are now Sinners coming to him never ruins his reputation it makes his reputation we need more of that Sinners before Jesus makes him a reputation because they're ready to repent there wiping his feet kissing his feet and she was oh show beside herself she was weeping she was going on she was just simply she didn't know what she was doing that's what we want to do get before Christ so you can lose yourself the old song said Let Me Lose Myself and find it Lord in thee let me lose all the presage I got let me lose everything so I can find myself in thee then one of the first thing you know Pharisee began to speak and she raised up Jesus looked over he said Simon I have somewhat to say of about you said I come to your house on your invitations and you never wash my feet he said but this woman and had and said you never give me any kiss you never made me welcome you never give me any anointment to go on my head but said this woman ever since she's come in has never ceased to even kiss my feet he turned to the woman for that gallon act he said and I say unto thee thy sins which are many are all forgiven thee oh what would we care what the world would say as long as I can hear them words thy sins which are many are all forgiven me oh God someday when life is all over I I I want to crawl up to his feet I want to just Pat his feet them feet that was going to be nail scarred in a little while sitting there dirty and she washed him with tears of

she had she laid all of her glory down all of her money down everything she had and spent everything she could on him and there she was kissing his feet and her lips all oh greasy with the AR the tears running down her cheeks her hair hanging down and wet with the greas and all on his feet like that when she broke the spiger box and poured it all over his feet every bit of it she never just
