support one another Jesus is the comforter so I'm going to read these prayer requests if any of them strike you particularly then be sure and hold that one before the Lord hold these needs before your own needs before the Lord first we have a a note please pray for sister Roberta baggot who is not feeling well and desires a healing touch also brother Jeremy is at home with a little one who's

have to have a knee replacement right now they're working on the fourth brace for my leg please keep me in your prayers sister Amelia she's reaching out because the Lord can heal the leg we know the Lord can do that if the Lord chooses that it be a knee replacement then the the Lord can do that too we depend on the Lord for all of these things let's just join our hearts together now and go to the Lord in pray Unity is one body before the Lord Jesus Lord Jesus we don't know how to thank you for the privilege that we have that we can come to you that we can call on your name Lord that in this in

with you there God bless you Sister welcome it's good it's good to have you it's good to be in in the house of the Lord today um Elijah is here he's gone through a hard time with um in a traumatic

idea when he woke up that morning that that was going to be his last day on Earth and brothers and sisters one day is going to be our last day on Earth everyone here so we always need to be ready and I think that uh this sermon that I'm going to preach this morning in this subject I believe will help us get ready for that time I um obviously a lot has changed since last Sunday I look I look a little different and uh the church looks a little different I like change brother Manny you look different too man it's good he shaved it too God bless you um I'm going to tell you something you already know the chairs that you're sitting in are very very uncomfortable right now and it's because they haven't been um they haven't been worked in so we'll try to have them all worked in and and much more comfortable for you uh next uh by by the next service I was uh it's funny we were I was I took off my shoes and the best way to work them in is you take off your shoes and you just go from chair to chair and I started over here the other night and uh young Kenneth Peterson was watching me I was going from chair to chair you know having fun and and he looks at me and I look down at him and he says can I do that I said yeah so it was funny how kids think wow I get to walk on the chairs in church so Kenneth and I we we made it we made a dent I mean his little feet you know they don't do much but uh he was he was with me in spirit um speaking of change I really do I I do like change and I I think God likes change in his people he gives us new things and those things encourage us and so we don't get stuck in a rut stuck in the same way that we do things what I want to do on uh on our Wednesday night services we'll continue on with a character in The Bible brother Lyle has been absolutely hitting home run with Joseph and doing and and explaining his life and and it's really it's been a blessing but I want to um throw some more in there and what I would like to do is on on some Wednesdays is I would like to take a topic brother Jordan suggested this and I thought it was a really good suggestion a more topical study for our Wednesday night Bible Bible study so what I'm going to do is I will take the the first subject this Wednesday is going to be on prayer and then we're going to be going through at Le probably every other week or every third week and uh we will be going teaching on a subject and bringing out that subject from the Bible for our Wednesday night bible study and then what I would like to do now here's the change you probably already knew that what I would like to do on the following Sunday we're not going to do it next Sunday but we will start uh um subsequent to that what I would like to do is I will teach on Wednesday night on a subject let's say it's it's on the schedule to teach on sin and then on the follow that's on Wednesday and then on the following Sunday night I would like to have some of the brothers give a 10 or a 15 minute sermon on that subject that we T that I taught on on Wednesday night and what gave me the idea was of uh some of you have been to the ministers meetings that we have here in Arizona they've been just a a tremendous success and I mean we get 40 or 50 minutes ministers at at each meeting and what they do is they have a main speaker and then they have some of the minister Brothers they will speak for about 10 minutes on the subject of the meeting and it's been really a blessing and I've been praying about doing it I'd like to do it now this doesn't you don't have to meet the qualifications of a pastor or a deacon to do this you could give a testimony about the subject or you can teach a small lesson on the subject and what furthered this is I had a a meeting with a um a new friend of mine he's a pastor in uh in Quebec and he was giving a testimony um about a a mutual friend of ours and this brother was in Jeffersonville at uh another friend of mine's Church um Nathan Bryant he was there and brother Nathan had some of the brothers in his his church come up and do the same and this brother that was from Canada when he was there he was so touched by these brothers coming up now they might not have been polish speakers they might not have been um real maybe versed in the word but they went up and they poured their heart out for this short amount of time and when this brother went back home it changed him and he said wow he said God can use anyone to preach the gospel it doesn't have to be the pastor in the Pulpit doesn't have to be a prophet it can be a brother in church gets up there and gives a message and it really changed this brother's life and then that was I don't know maybe a year ago or two and now that brother that was down there now he's the pastor he started up a new church now he is the pastor of a church and it all came from that one uh service in brother Nathan's Church in Jeffersonville so I I feel good about it so look at the subjects on the calendar and get with me or one of the deacons if you have something on your heart that you would like to speak on and we will uh as I always I try to keep it to an hour so we'll either have a 10 minute or a 15 minute session for each brother that goes up there 10 or 15 minutes you can get a lot done in 10 or 15 minutes I promise so so we'll move forward on that and we'll see how the Lord the Lord leads there as I said I need I think change is important and we should always re-evaluate Our Lives constantly be re-evaluating our lives that's one of the things that is so important about communion communion gives us a chance to examine ourselves we really should do it every day but we we need to look at ourselves and say Lord am I am I doing right and I feel in my own life just my personal walk with the Lord I feel like the Lord has started to change in me and I'm excited to see which direction it's going to go but I definitely feel that I am changing and I Lord I don't know what what direction that that you want this to go or or what you have in store but I know that if he's changing me that it's going to be to serve you all because that's my job that's why he placed me here so I'm I'm excited to see where he's he's going in this um the uh subject today is this Parable that we must understand it's it's a the parable of what we call it is the sewer sewing seeds what a first of all we have to understand what a parable is and I've heard that a parable is it's an Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning it's like yeah it sounds pretty good I guess it's not not my my favorite way to explain a parable it it comes from the Greek word parabole parabole and it basically means means a comparison and Strong's Concordance says that uh that a parable parables are distinctive teaching method to convey confy a profound truth in a related relatable and memorable way they often involve everyday situations and characters making them accessible to a wide audience while also containing a deeper meaning for those willing to seek them in Jewish tradition Parables were a common teaching tool used by rabbis to confy ethical and Theological lessons Jesus's use of Parables was both was both Innovative and rooted in Tradition allowing him to communicate complex spiritual truths in a manner that was both engaging and thought-provoking Parables often contain elements of surprise or reversal challenging listeners to think critically and this is key to think critically and ref reflect on their own lives and beliefs it's really it's a simple narrative that illustrates a universal truth I've seen people take Parables I've seen ministers especially take Parables and they try to drill it down to a parable and try to Define Everyone by these Parables the wise fo the wise virgin and the foolish virgin is a very common one in our circle of people they try to say well this is the wise verg virgin and this is what the wise virgin believes and this is the foolish virgin over here and and this is this church and this is that church and this is this group of people and this is the wise virgin holds true to this and the foolish Virgin Goes to that don't do that that's not what a parable is meant for a parable is meant for you to take this story of something that you see every day and then apply it to your own life and it's really a masterpiece the way Jesus did it is he took things that that people see every day and then he says now here is the meaning of this so so in this one these these people that were listening to Jesus they're going to walk by a farm or probably most of them were farmers or work working on a farm and now they're going to think about these things that Jesus said every day day you know we might tell a parable of a more modern thing driving a stoplight or whatever and it's something that will bring those things to our remembrance but don't miss the foundational purpose of a parable a parable should be used to judge yourself and not to judge others which means that you should not try to divide others into these different different groups but you can and you should take yourself and put yourself into these different groups that Jesus separates apart now to understand this parable of of the sewer and the seeds you have to understand the basics of farming and I'm not talking about modern Farms today where they they have the big tractors and they they till the ground and then they lay the seeds and it's it's the same concept but back in Jerusalem time 2,000 years ago probably the people that were listening to him as I said were probably mostly or a good portion of them were farmers so they knew all of these things that Jesus is talking about he talks about the different types of soils and that's the key to this Parable is the soil it's not the SE and it's not the seed it's the soil and we are the soil in this Parable that's key to understand this you know we always think about the seed being the main focus here but it's not it's if that seed will find fertile ground so Jesus talks about different types of of farm different types of seeds that are spread out across the field so you have have a field that's tilled and then the farmer will go out and he will spread his seeds in that field while some of the seeds will fall all beside the field and there were trails that that walked along these fields and those Trails Were Meant to walk on so they were pressed hard and and they they didn't they weren't meant for farming they were meant for walking or driving your your riding your horse on or your chariot or whatever so they were hard packed and then outside of the field there were other places that didn't get necessarily tilled that the weeds were growing up and and you see that around the edges and then there were Fields there were areas in the Judean landscape and and many of you have been there as I have been there that you see a lot of Bedrock on the sides of these Hills and then you'll see some Terraces there and those areas have just a little bit of soil on top of them and then below them it's Bedrock so it's very hard for something you couldn't you couldn't Farm in those areas because the Bedrock is so high and the soil is so thin so he's going to talk about those different places and talk about how a farmer will go out and sew his his his seed so the um and it it will talk about four different types of people and Jesus had already done great Miracles he had already really established himself as a prophet and people a lot of people were following him so what Jesus does in this case is it's there's too many people around so he gets in a boat and the boat is pushed off a little ways off of the bank and then he's preaching to the crowd from this boat just to give you a sense of what's going on here so let's get it to it let's um start with Mark chapter 4 and this Parable is in three different gospels Matthew Mark and Luke and in Luke when Luke starts this same narrative Luke points out he says this he says soon afterwards Jesus began a tour of the nearby towns and Villages preaching and announcing the good news about the kingdom of God he took his 12 disciples with him along with some women Luke is very um careful to point out the women in this one along with them some women who had who had been cured of evil dis evil spirits and diseases among them were Mary Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons Joanna the wife of chuza herod's business manager Suzanna and many others who were contri contributing from their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples so Luke is quick to point out that this isn't just men that this Parable is for everyone it's for women it's for men it's really it's for the old it's for the young amen and he's when Jesus is talking about a parable he's going to start separating people and these parables as you'll see from some of the things that Jesus said they are serious we think of them just being oh this is a nice story then I can remember no we're going to read here in this in this Parable that Jesus says that if you can't understand this Parable that I'm talking about right now you're not going to understand anything else that I say that's how important this Parable is he says if you can't understand this one then you're not going to understand any of the other Parables that's how important what I'm saying in uh this morning is vitally important we have to understand this one Mark chter 4 verse one it says this and he began again to teach by the seaside and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land and he taught them many things by Parables and said unto them unto them in his Doctrine hearken behold there went out so he says listen to me so he's he's talking and then he probably raised his voice and he said Hey listen listen to what I'm saying hearken behold there went out a s to sow the S is a farmer as I said earlier this one's he is the one that's planting his field and it came to pass it went out a SE or to se and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the wayside and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up and some fell on Stony ground where it had not much Earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of Earth but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away and some fell among thorns and and the Thorns grew up and choked it and yielded no fruit and the other fell on good ground and it did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some 30 some 60 and some a 100 and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear what a statement that he says just right there he that has ears let him hear and he the the the NLT translation says anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand everyone who was in that crowd that day they all probably I would assume they all had ears and he's looking out and he said every one of you listen to what I'm saying because this is very important in other places he said don't Harden your heart Hebrews chapter 3 verse 14 says for we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end while it is said now he's going to quote a Psalm this is this is the Apostle speaking today if you will hear his voice do not Harden your hearts as in the Rebellion for who having heard rebelled indeed was it not all who came out of Egypt led by Moses the prophet and later on he says so we see that they could not enter in because of their unbelief they hardened their hearts they hardened their ears to where they wouldn't hear God's word this Parable that it's all about the word it's about the word and it is about the soil verse number 10 Mark Mark uh chapter markk chapter 4:10 and when he was alone they were about him with the TW with the twel asked they that they that were about him with the twel asked of him the parable and he said unto them unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without to them that are outside all these things are done in Parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them what an odd statement what a s strange thing for Jesus to say he says I'm speaking this in stories so that you can understand and that they won't understand you would think that Jesus would be up there saying I want everybody to understand and I want everybody to listen to me and then everybody everybody will be saved but that's not what he says right here he says so that some won't understand and that they won't repent but unto you it is given the kingdom he's actually Jesus is quoting a prophecy that was given by the prophet Isaiah you know the story about Isaiah when when he came before the Lord and He Saw God sitting on the throne grown and he saw all the angels surround about around about him flying around with wings on their feet to cover their feet and and wings over their faces to cover their faces in the Holy presence of God and the other wings that they flew and and he and and Isaiah looked up and he says oh he he came in the presence of God he says I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among people of unclean lips it just struck him how low he was and how great God is and here's Isa Isaiah and he says he even says he says I saw God you know in the Bible it says that is Isaiah was sought in half in history brother Lyall I assume it's in the talmid the reason that Isaiah was sought in half is because he said that I saw God and they all said no you can't see God no man can see God and live so they put Isaiah to death but here's Isa isah and and he and he's he's seeing all of this and then and he says I'm a man of unclean lips and I'm so low and and then the voice comes out and said who will go and then Isaiah says oh Lord here am I send me now we know that story but what was he supposed to do that's the thing that we may not not have known well you just keep reading and it says this then I said Isaiah chapter 6 verse 8 then I said here am I send me and he said go and tell this people to keep on hearing I'm reading the new King James version keep on hearing but do not understand keep on seeing but do not perceive make the heart of this people dull and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and return and be healed so this this whole story with with the the The Throne of God and and Isaiah and he says Lord send me these are his instructions and now Jesus in this Parable he is saying here is the Fulfillment of that the New Living Translation of Mark 4:1 says he replied you are permitted to understand the kingdom of God but I use Parables for everything I say to Outsiders so the scriptures might be fulfilled when they when they see what I do they will learn nothing according Isaiah when they hear what I say they will not understand otherwise listen to this brother Joel otherwise they will turn to me and be forgiven then Jesus said to them if you cannot understand the meaning of this Parable how will you understand all of the other Parables so look at the importance here and he's saying that there's going to be these other people they're going to come and I'm speaking to them in Parables and they're not going to understand and they're going to be lost and you are going to understand and you're going to be saved but if I was straight with them maybe they wouldn't be lost it's strange huh what he saying is there are different classes of people coming to hear these stories some are coming because they heard of the fishes and the Loaves and they're hungry like man I'm going to go up there that guy feeds everybody he fed them fish and bread and this last one I'm going to go up there I'm going to get some fish and bread others are coming to criticize they're coming to be Skeptics he's a false prophet because he doesn't preach what the Pharisees preach others are coming it's just like well my mom wanted me to come to come to church today to hear this Prophet so I'm going to go you know just I just pacifier there's others coming like that some people come because they want to see a miracle they want to be entertained oh I've heard all of these Miracles like going to the circus oh I want to see I want to see this oh that's going to be cool some of them really did come for that but then others came because they were sick others came because they needed to be healed others came because they were repenting and they knew that they were wrong and they wanted salvation they heard that this man was the Messiah of God and they wanted to bow down before him and say Lord forgive me of my sins there's those that that also so there are different classes of people coming and here is Jesus and he's saying that they're coming some of them are going to be blind some of them are going to be dull of hearing the other ones are going to live so he's that's what he's saying in this it's amazing pretty much every PR Parable that we hear really addresses two classes of people there's the ones if you can understand them and then Place yourself in these classes of people it IT addresses those people and then IT addresses the people that aren't Believers two different groups a parable really they bring judgment you come there you're not worthy you go there because you just want to be and it's same thing with church this is all all about the word when we come to church it's not because we have a potluck in the fellowship hall it's not because we have kids up in the upper room that you can fellowship with it's not because that we have a pickleball game we come to church to hear the word that is why we are here and then we take that word and then you see the different people you'll see these these different soils some will take it and they come here just to criticize and if you look for something to criticize you'll find it just as they looked at Jesus Christ and found stuff to criticize on him they say you hang out with a bunch of worldly people you hang out with a bunch of drunkards prostitutes Tax Collectors that's who your friends are Jesus how could you be a prophet of God they came to criticize but others truly came for what they needed they needed a change in their life they needed to be healed they there was something within them that said I need change the critic showed up to see a miracle showed up to see a prophet showed up to maybe other on showed up to shout in the spirit others showed up to run to the altar others showed up to prove that they are the bride of Christ and they all say I went there I wanted to shout and we didn't shout I wanted to praise we didn't praise I wanted to see a prophet we didn't see a prophet I wanted to see prophets I you know what he did he told a story about a farmer wasn't even a good story it was just about a farmer and how he he swws the field and then some of the seeds don't germinate you see Isaiah prophesying some came and they were blessed others came and they didn't care verse number 13 and he said unto them know ye not this Parable how then will you know all the Parables so if you don't understand this you're not going to understand any of them I remember when I was in when I was in college and I I took this class is brother Tim here I took this class electricity and magnetism it was one of the physics classes for engineering and I started in there and wow I had no idea what was going on I was like I'm history there is no way and I imagine these disciples when they were listening to Jesus and he said if you don't understand this you're going to fail the class if you don't understand this then you're not going to get anything and I see Peter like dude I have no idea what he's talking about but then Jesus explains to them more the swer SWS the word this is the only explanation of the s in the entire Parable in all three gospels we focus on who is sowing the word we focus on the prophet we focus on the pastor we focus on the Apostle the Evangelist the teacher we focused on all those things and here Jesus is saying hey if you don't understand this you don't understand anything anything and that's the end that's the swer doesn't even have a a really big place in this whole thing he is just putting out the word we were talking as I said I want to have some of the brothers come up they're spreading the word that's what I'm doing I'm spreading the word and they will fall on good ground and then it will also fall on people that really don't care it's like I'm here yeah he's got he always finishes right at 11:35 so we have 30 minutes it's here then there's others that are listening and say what's he trying to say and get offended at it but then there are others that are truly here to say Lord I want to accept your word I wanna Lord I want to know I want to I want to be better I want to serve you this Ser he's a farmer he's not the most important thing in this the important thing is where these the important thing is the seed or else no life could come forward and then it's the ground and there's four different kinds of ground three of them are bad one of them is receptive and one of them is good and these are they by the way side where the word is sown but they have heard but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts so the word comes to them they hear it but they don't have ears to hear they hear it they don't care and not even a blade of grass shoots up nothing happens they might come to church and it's like yeah whatever I I you know I just I don't like it that path that I was talking about earlier it's hard it can't take a seed it can't grow anything and it's quickly eaten by the birds or the mice or or whatever it is that eat seeds and then those they don't even have a chance to sprout they're not coming to receive correction they're not coming to be a better person they are coming for something else maybe it's to do a favor to Grandma maybe it's it's for Mom I I I'll show up to church and they and then and then I you know I won't have to do anymore you know maybe it's watching YouTube of this video so they can criticize it's they sit in service and and and listen the minds wander as I said you're counting down the time watching the clock thinking and there's no service tonight no I'm serious think about it why are you here this morning this is an important morning this may be the most important morning of your life and you're here and you're just sitting in the Pew as the chairs are uncomfortable they were sitting on the ground here and it was probably Rocky I've been to the Sea of Galilee it was not as comfortable as our chairs thank you I like them you're going to love them too they will be comfortable I'm not you don't have to sit on a rock um stand on the Rock Amen there are I see two classes of people here brother I see one group as I just said that really could care less they're just here for another reason and then I see another group one thing is I'll I'll tell one story on this group that that they don't really want to be here I was ministering a while ago and I noticed the church was pretty full and I noticed that there was a man that I didn't recognize and he was sitting right about where you are brother Jeremiah and and I read this scripture to start the service 1 Corinthians chapter 6 don't you don't have to go there but it says this no you yourselves do wrong and cheat and you do things to your brethren do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor homosexuals nor sodomites nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revelers nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you and man that guy got up and left he was and I could tell he's like no I'm not going to come in here to be preached at he if he would have stayed the sermon was like Hey we're all Sinners but he's like no I'm not going to be preached that and he got up and man he stormed out it's like okay well that's that group and I'm not condemning that brother I don't know who he was and I've never seen him before I never seen him since but I know the Lord knows him but second there's that group they really don't want to be here they don't want they don't want the Lord but second and I hate to say this but is the religious man or a woman hard ground this is what I believe and if it doesn't doesn't match that then I don't believe it hard ground second Timothy says that they shall Heap for themselves teachers having itching years and I've witnessed it over and over again brothers and sisters there a couple years ago when remember the Asbury Revival at the college was going on it was an exciting time and it was it was even the news and a minister texted me and he says what do you think about all this and I told him I said I'm all for it he responded I'm seeing a lot of women in pants a lot of long-haired men a lot of CER college students brother they were praying all night that ground is hard there is no place God no no seed of God can take root in that place critic criticize and that religion religious spirit let's uh let's just go let's go to Second Timothy 4 for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts that word lust and our modern language has a sexual connotation that's not the case here after their own desire s after their own wants they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away from turn away their ears from the truth and it shall be turned to fables let me read another translation the Amplified version says this for the for the time will come when people will not tolerate sound Doctrine and accurate instruction that challenges them with God's truth but wanting to have their ears tickled with something pleasing they will accumulate for themselves many teachers one after another chosen to satisfy their own desires and to support the errors they hold that's the truth and will turn their ears away from the truth and wander off into myths and man-made fictions and will accept the unacceptable these are people in churches and what they want they want the preacher to preach their own Doctrine they want the preacher to preach their own narrative so that's who they put in front of them because this agrees with the way that I think it this is a prophecy from Paul to Timothy saying that this time will come there are certain things that they want to hear and instead of hearing something new something fresh like the teachings of Christ they want to hear what feels comfortable to them the word of God is not comfortable it challenges you that's and I know a lot of people don't want to hear it a lot of people don't want to know that Jesus actually preached against preached hell and he preached against sin he talks more about hell than he does about heaven it's like no no no no no no no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah if you if you don't want to hear those things don't open this book because it has condemnation in there the Bible is not comfortable it's not it challenges you to change every single one of us and these verse number 14 Mark and these are they likewise which are sewn on Stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately they receive it with gladness so this is different from that hard spirit that hard either atheist Spirit or doesn't care about God or from that hard religious spirit this is something different there's actually some ground there there's some soil to receive it this is this is there is something to this person these are the people who come to church and they have a good attitude but it's not important enough to them to stay with it they don't study at home they don't spend time in prayer they don't get their families together to read the Bible brother Manny I got to tell you you blessed me so much yesterday I talked to um brotheru on the phone and he told me he says sometimes brother he says on my break or on my lunch he says I just call up Grace and we read the Bible we talk about the word that's what it is you have to have it all the time that's that good soil but this rocky soil didn't have that it sprung up it's like I like it a little bit but it doesn't there's nothing there to get your roots into do you take it home or do you just come to church on Sunday morning some of you just come to Sunday on Sunday morning that's not enough some of you come on Sunday morning and Sunday night that's twice as good but it's not enough some of you come on Wednesday and Sunday morning and Sunday night that's three times as good but it's not enough you need to live this life you need to stay in this word all the time that seed that's within you has to be watered constantly that is the good ground this Rocky ground there's nothing there as I said earlier it just has just a little bit of soil and it can't hold the moisture the key to this whole thing is the moisture the key to a crop in in Israel is that you get moisture to it and the proper moisture the rock or let's say gravel here it doesn't hold anything you know you can have a pile of rocks in your yard and it rains and you can see some little weeds popping up in there but when it stops raining and the Sun comes out and the heat is put on it they just die they just go away and that's with us when we may Sprout we may be doing good and everything's great but when the heat comes down are we able to stay with it when the Temptation comes the temptation to sin are we are we able to stay with it I planted a tree yesterday and it was a mosquite tree and the roots for mosquite they go way down and as I was digging the hole um I hit kichi after like a foot and man that stuff's hard so and it doesn't it doesn't hold any moisture it's just it's just a it's a like concrete so what I did is I dug with a pick I dug down in there and kept going down as far as I could get down in there and then replaced it with some with some soil that had some good Organics in it I I got some the bags of Mo or the bags of the top soil and I mixed it up with the soil and then put it down in there so that tree had a place to put out its roots and that's with our soil if it's just hard kichi that tree is not going to get big that tree is not going to bear fruit you need to have a good base a good hole with good soil in it that can hold the water or else you're going to be watering the thing every day and then if you go on vacation the dumb thing's going to die why because it it doesn't hold water many times water represents the word in the Bible they said coming to church is important but more than that the soil has to have this constant flow of moisture Jeremiah 177 says this blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord and who whose hope is in the Lord for he shall be like a tree planted by Waters which spreads out its roots by the river and will not fear when the heat comes but its Leaf will be green and will not be anxious in the year of drought nor will cease from yielding fruit that's that tree that's planted in good soil that has water in it if you throw a bunch of seeds as I said out out in the gravel they might Sprout up but they they die verse number 17 they have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time and afterwards with Affliction or P persecution arises for the word sake immediately they are offended most translations say immediately they fall away soon as they get embarrassed in front of their friends for not drinking soon as they as soon as they get embarrassed for making a stand against some of these ridiculous woke ideas that we have today as soon as they get embarrassed when the pastor condemns sin and maybe calls out something that they are doing I'm not going back the gospel as I said it's offensive there are consequences to our sins in this very example there are three failures and one success and that's usually how it is and these are they which are sown among Thorns such as hear the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things enter in choke the word and it becomes un and it becometh unfruitful so the Thorns the these fell on good ground this is the saddest one of all of to me this fell on good ground good water good soil and it Springs up and it's looking good full of moisture but there is no separation in this one between God and the world and if you don't separate yourself from the world and you try to live both the world's going to win 100% of the time if you will not separate yourself the world's going to win these are the people they have one foot in church they have the other foot in sin you have good soil brother you have good soil sister and Christianity might grow but you can even you can even apply these Christian principles to your own life and you can be successful at work but while that seed of God is prospering in your life so is the seed of Satan prospering in your life this is so common and you see people walking one foot in the world one foot in with God it's popular to say you're a Christian and you feel like you're making a s stand to say you're a Christian but your life the Love of Money the desire to be respected the desire to have an important position the desire of fle Flesh through sexual indiscretions not going to church because you stayed up too late the night before playing video games or watching movies what's more important to you they're growing this they're growing which one's which one's going to choke the other one out you're up too late last night playing video games or watching a movie surfing the web watching YouTube shorts Tik Tok Instagram and here you are this morning is it really important to you there's a number 20 and these are they which are swn on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some 30-fold some 60 some 100 and here's what happens when that good ground receives the word it produces fruit you've changed so your husband starts coming your wife starts coming your children see your change and they want the same thing that you have your friends see the change in you and then they want that change that is the good soil the soil that you see out in the farm with the wheat growing it's been fertilized the rocks have been taken out and throughout the world here in Southern Arizona too you'll see along in farming areas or former farming areas you see these walls made of rock made of stones and what has happened is when the farmer and the workers are tilling the the soil and they see a stone there they pick it up and they take it out and they set it over on the side and then they continue so they get those stones out and that's how it is for us we could we don't have that Stony ground and the better the more that we work the more stones are taken out of our our lives and the better Our Lives go toward serving God and then instead of the wheat instead of the weeds choking out the wheat pretty soon the wheat will choke out the weeds and what does it produce remember this is the parable that we need to understand before we can understand anything else it produces Fruit by their fruits you shall know them the seed of the word didn't produce anything on the other ground the musicians can come and close that s sewed the seed it didn't produce anything on this hard ground and then in the Rocks yeah i' Sprout it up but it was worthless it didn't produce anything and then on the on the side of the of the field it was choked out by the weeds and it didn't produce any fruit but out in the field out in that good ground It produced something so I ask brothers and sisters here this morning why' you come why do you go to church why do you claim to be a Christian don't be secure and what you think that you are always examine yourself and look am am I this good field or am I staying up too late the night before am I doing things that I shouldn't and letting that those weeds grow with the good crop am I do I get offended and and as soon as as soon as something comes up as soon as the pastor says something or a deacon says something or somebody says something to me I'm out how many people come to church they come and visit and they say oh those people judge me because of the way I look those people judge me because of my tattoos those people judge me because of of of my background when it's them they're the ground that's not fertile but it's when they condition that soil and say you know what I got these things but I don't care I love the Lord I'm coming to church because I want to be a better person I'm coming to church because I want to live my life better and that Parable that the pastor talked about I understand that I want to be that good soil and now we lay this found foundation for the other Parables saying that there are different classes of people really there's two there's ones that accept the word and then there's ones that don't really care they say that they care but they care more about serving themselves than they do about serving God you with me you understand what I'm saying do you understand this Parable it's the most important we have to understand [Music] it you with me brother Josiah verse one brother Tim Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you to see you high and lift it up

Eyes Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart oh I want to see you oh I want to see you brothers and sister S I want to say [Music] this I um brother Jeremy baggot texted me I believe it yesterday and said one of the most profound things I was talking about wasting our time and Jeremy said he said they scroll all day rather than taking up the scroll and reading it I really appreciated that all of us have a weakness towards all of these different types of soil every one of us does just make sure that you're taking that soil like I did for that tree digging out all the kichi digging out all the rough stuff and mixing in that good fertile soil so that that seed has a chance to grow I told Daniel my son last night as I I said I believe that there might be somebody or people at the altar tomorrow morning and here's Heath right here saying Lord I need something Lord I need I want to be that good soil I want to be that sincere person that doesn't just come to church that doesn't just waste waste the Lord's time I want to be Lord what this Parable say say I should be and I want to understand it Lord and help me there's things in my life I need to get rid of there's things in my life I need to change the gospel is not a comfortable thing Jesus said it he quoted Isaiah and he said make their ears to where they can't hear he said make their minds to where they can't understand and then he goes back and he says now he that has an ear let him hear and let him understand these things bit of a paradox but I believe I one of those ones that do have ears to hear I believe I'm one of those ones who's willing to change this year I believe the Lord is doing something in my life I can't wait and I want him to do it in all of our Liv lives more consecration more word let those seeds go out and then now you start spreading those seeds and may they fall on good ground when we get under these different Parables there's they tell the same stories over and over and over Lord help us to understand it's not just that you say you believe it we must understand it we must understand understand it and be able to apply it to our lives let's all stand Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you Lord I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Brothers brothers
