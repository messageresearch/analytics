think I recognize you back there God God bless you welcome it's good it's good to see you and your family I um there's really nothing sweeter than a mother I asked sister Jessica to sing that song um because El Shai has a very special meaning it means it means the the breasted God the god that can nurse life into an infant into a helpless a helpless person and it's such a loving spirit that this El Shai has and as I said it's it's so applicable to Motherhood before we get started brothers and sisters I want to say that just over the past couple days that I've been contacted by a few people and and I'm just so proud I'm so proud of our congregation I'm so proud of the individuals that are going through all of us are going through something but to see character rise up above a trial is just it's such a blessing it's so encouraging to me and we should never ever say a a bad or a critical word about anyone either if it's if it's to their face or behind their back or even to your husband and wife if if you even a husband and a wife talking in private we should never even say a word about someone else even in our private Chambers it brothers and sisters it can do such harm point out when someone is speaking negative don't necessarily try to correct them but point out that Christ was Perfection and Christ is the one that we look to Jesus is the one that taught us not to say a a critical or a negative word ever he and he set the example he was spit upon they spread rumors about his mother that she had an affair with a heathen Roman soldier those rumors followed him for his whole life they accused him as he started in the ministry they accused Jesus of betraying the very Jehovah who was his father and yet he cried out to God for for to forgive those who spoke against him if we are not Christians if someone does us wrong and we are not a Christian then we have every right to fight back we have every right to speak evil of them if they speak evil of us we have every right to apply an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth if you do me wrong I can do you wrong if you are not a Christian but if you are a Christian if you truly believe in Jesus then you have no you forfeit those rights no matter what someone says about you you have no right to respond none that's what a Christian says twice yesterday brothers and sisters experience this one once someone who was hurt by someone by someone else that was offended by someone else and that someone else ended up coming to his rescue saving him from from a very difficult situation someone who was he was they were offended at and then yet this person later on comes and goes out of his way to take care of the person that was offended and then another time a brother felt condemned he he let his temper get to him and and he texted me and he asked me to pray for him and because he he he had said something wrong last week and he couldn't wait to get back to work to make it right on Monday and he said brother what do I do and he confessed these to me and I said brother said that just proves I said you're awesome I said what you just told me just proves that you are a Christian that there is that spirit that holy spirit inside of you that is is causes repentance and you're sorry and you want to make it right shows me there's something very special about that brother shows me that he has that Spirit of Christ we make mistakes and other people make mistakes in dealing with us us also but remember as a Christian we forfeit our rights no matter how bad someone treats us no matter what they do we are not permitted to do them evil harm speak against them in any way because we're a Christian Jesus said in Matthew chap 5:38 has been on my heart the past few weeks as you know you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile goeth him Twain give him that asketh thee give to him that ask asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that it have been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy if you're for remember as I said if you're a Christian you forfeit that but I say Jesus speaking but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you persecute you that was Jesus Christ's first sermon we're talking about the Rapture and we're talking about the son of man Ministry and the resurrection of the Saints and the Heavenly City and the bride of Christ brothers and sisters none of us are going to see that unless we have that Foundation none of us will see those things unless we have the foundation which is of Christ and what Christ taught we can't expect that we're that we're entitled to something if someone says something behind our behind our backs or whatever it is if you are despitefully you used love that person if you're cursed behind your back if you're cursed to your face pray for that person Jesus commanded that it may s it may see seem simple but how many people really do it Jesus said straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there will be that find it do you think he was just talking to himself it wasn't he was talking to us I'm thankful for that one text I got yesterday I can see that it's doing something a church the ministering and and and and what we're doing here as a as a the Tucson Tabernacle it's having an effect at least on a few people bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth the rain on the just and the unjust if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans do so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that word perfect in Modern English means blameless brothers and sisters if we can't get the very basics of Christianity the very first sermon that Jesus preached how can we expect to see him when he returns let that sink in these things are basic Christian principles and he said so that you might be the children of your father if you do these things when God came to Abraham in Genesis chapter 17 he changed Abram's name to Abraham he changed Sarah Sarah's name sarai's name to Sarah he gave Abra abam a covenant of circumcision and he promised Abraham that although he was 99 years old and his wife was 90 that they were going to have a child and Not only would they have a child Sarah and Abraham both would have this child but God would make nations from them nations from Abraham and Sarah it was a promise and when he came to Abraham to give him these promises when God came to Abraham to give him all of those promises that I said and even the Covenant of circumcision that was told that you were one of God's people when he gave that commandment he came in a certain name he announced himself as El Shai the god that can nurse love life into a child as a mother can nurse life into an infant Genesis chapter 17 verse1 says this and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God the original Hebrew word for that this particular scripture is El Shi walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations so this Same Spirit the same elai this loving spirit that came to Abraham Was the Same Spirit and when Jesus said come unto me all ye labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest there it is manifested itself later on and then you will be able to overcome if you really truly understand this El Shai then you'll be able to overcome when someone speaks evil of you when someone hates you when someone lies about you you'll speak positive things about that person and you'll get down on your knees and you'll cry out for Mercy for that person that's what else should I will will produce and the closest thing that I have ever seen to Eli This Love that Jesus had and this love that when God came to Abraham is the love of a mo mother to a child it's the closest thing to perfect love that I have ever seen when my daughter was born meline we took her home and Stephanie laid her on the bed and and Stephanie just started weeping she said she's so helpless she says I am completely responsible for this precious little baby I don't believe Brothers I don't believe that the love of a man even for our own child can compare to that love that a woman has when God separated man and a woman a woman had strength certain strengths and the man had certain strengths and he gave that love that El should die he gave that love to the woman it's something that she just has and me as a father I remember when when meline was born I mean I was just in love with her when Daniel was born the same thing the kid I was just like oh you know this this is he came out and and Stephanie was just so happy and here's the difference between a dad and a mom I picked him up and I turned him to the doctor and I said is he supposed to look that way he looks like Yoda except he's red I said are feet supposed to look like that Stephanie thought he was perfect my wife looked at that little boy and he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen when I was born my dad looked at me picked me up saying thing and he says is this chin supposed to be like that made my mom cry there's this there's a difference and that love of a mother is just so beautiful Susanna Wesley she was the youngest of 25 children how is that even possible my my sister she went to she had she was on her fifth child for for the sisters that have some children she was she was on her fifth child and and she thought she knew what was going on and and she went to the doctor and and the doctor said uh yes she said uh you're you're pregnant you're going to have a child and this will be your your fifth child um she saides and she said said well how many children are you planning on having she said three her husband Susanna Wesley's husband was Samuel Wesley and Susan Susanne Wesley's life was filled with hardships she and her husband had 19 children but nine of them died as infants two there was two sets of twins that died and then one of the babies died when the maid acally smothered it she was tasked so she was tasked with raising the remaining 10 children and it was under very very difficult circumstances when the children were young her husband who was a minister her husband left her after they had an argument and he was gone for over a year and she was left trying to provide for these children they were in a in a place that they and moved later on they moved and they started a church that he was he was placed in a church that hated their doctrines very a very liberal area and they were a conservative group and they they were under a very hostile environment so she didn't have the community she didn't have a husband that would take care of her and there she was watching over these kids when he was gone when her husband was gone she wrote him this letter she said a woman she said but I'm also the Mistress of a large family and though the superior charge of the souls contained it lies upon you yet your long absence I cannot but think but look upon every soul that you leave under my charge as a talent committed to me under a trust I am not a man or a minister yet as a mother and as a mistress wife I felt I ought to do more than I had yet done I resolved to begin with my own children in which I observed the following method I take such a proportion of time as I can spare every night to discourse with each Child Apart on Monday I talk with Molly on Tuesday with Hattie Wednesday with Nancy Thursday with Jackie Friday with Patty Saturday with Charles she took time with every child and even though Suzanne was doing everything that she could to feed the children she made this statement she said I am not a man or a minister yet as a mother I feel I ought to do more than I have yet done I resolved to begin with my own children and she felt that she wasn't doing enough as a Christian and look she was working her fingers to the bone no husband there no Community to help her and here she is with these 10 children doing everything that she can and you know what she says I haven't done enough she saysi can do more and instead as many people do they want to reach out to someone to outside maybe for their own benefit they want to start a Ministry over here or over there and they neglect the greatest need that's right under their nose and that's what Suzanne Wesley had she said that I'm going to start with my children and it changed the world her saying that in my opinion that was the greatest decision that she ever made was focusing right there on her family and she ended up it affected millions of people she took the time with every child to read them the Bible to pray with them she loved her children and she built that respect from the children for her and her husband finally returned to his family but he never provided he was never good husband he was a minister but he went to prison twice because of his financial issues all that time he was away from his family and when he was with his family he really wasn't a good dad to him 1 Corinthians 113 113 says this but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of every woman is the man and the head of Christ is God so in the order of the household it puts the man as the head of the woman and suanna Wesley honored this she gave her husband the preeminence in the family it didn't matter to her that her husband wasn't living up to his responsibilities she had a responsibility and the word said this it doesn't it is not a qualifier if someone else is living up to their responsibilities as a Christian as if you have to live up to yours you have to live up to your responsibility no matter how someone else treats you she lived up to that and in in that it says that Christ is the head of the man and the man is the head of the woman so Brothers as we are husbands to our wives loving our wives we should act like we would want Christ to act to us he wants to hear us we want to we want him to hear us we want to be able to speak to him we want him to answer we want to have that loving relationship with our lord and there we are say okay I want this but I'm not going to give it to my wife we should be that loving caring husband as Christ is to the Man 1 Peter chapter 3 says this likewise ye wives be in subjection verse one likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives amen while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear so a wife can win her husband to the Lord just by her behavior who's adoring let it not be outward adoring of plated hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of the meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this man in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned thems being Sub in subjection to their own husbands even as Sarah we just talked about Sarah and Abraham even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement Peter here is saying you're a daughter of this this woman that lived over a thousand years ago and you should you are her daughter so you can have that same faith if you follow these even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well you are not afraid with any amazement likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel that word weaker vessel is physical the man's bigger and stronger and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so if you're not treating your wife correctly if you're you're bickering and you're arguing then your prayers Brothers we're talking about husbands then your prayers won't even be heard by God we like to say the women we can we can say a lot of things that a a woman is disqualified as far as her prayers being heard but if the man's not treating his wife like he should brothers our prayers aren't hurt either family starts see how important a family Unity is that love one another it's not just it's not just not doing things it's not just giving up drinking or smoking or whatever it is we also have to work together as a family unit as parents so our very prayers will be heard and we understand we're too different people men and women Brothers you know when our wives say you don't understand me they're right we don't understand them they're hard to understand and it's we are hard for them to understand but we love each other and we work together for these things Susanna Wesley was a good mother and even though her husband had problems she didn't waver she didn't complain she didn't divorce him their house was burned down twice young boy John Wesley almost died in one of those fires she had to separate her family because they didn't have a house to live in she had to put the kids in different homes and to make things worth they were as I said they were hated in that area because they because of their political and their religious views Samuel was was like a trump supporter preaching in like Seattle wasn't popular it wouldn't be well received but with her husband not being a good provider the people around her hating her and their doctrines and whatever they they were doing she still she kept her testimony and even with all of his Seminary education John Wesley Charles they they went to these highlevel seminaries and even with their great education that they have John Wesley said I learned more about Christianity from my mother than from all the theologians in England she raed she raised two of the greatest men that have ever walked the Earth in Charles and John Wesley and it started a Revival that swept the whole world John Wesley rode a horse all over Europe preaching the gospel sometimes four times a day preaching sermons and the spirit that was on Wesley to teach the people then spread from John Wesley and went around the world an exposition of the seven Church ages says this since the fifth age had brought a great dissemination of the word through printing the sixth age was quick to take advantage of it the age was the second stage of the restoration and as we have stated previously was the tassel age education abounded this was the age of intellectual Men Who Loved God and served him missionaries abounded around the world and spread all over the world abounded and the word spread all over the world it was an age of Brotherly Love it was an age of the open door and this was the age that John and Charles Wesley started they spearheaded it and it started from a mother teaching them at home Suzanne Wesley changed the world and it was hard biographer for Suzanne Wesley wrote this although she never preached a sermon or published a book or founded a church she is known as as the mother of methodism why because two of her sons John Wesley and Charles Wesley as children consciously or unconsciously will applied the example and teachings and circumstances of their home life what they learned at home they applied in their life and millions came to Christ through the meth Methodist Church it was the age of the open door and how much did those individual prayers and bible studies how much did they have to do with that when our children brother and sisters when our children hear our words when they see how we handle situations when they see us lose our temper it makes them lose their temper when they see us complaining about around the supper table it makes them complain when they see us wanting to get our way it makes them want to get their way it create our weaknesses create weaknesses in our children or when they hear us praying in private or when they see us studying our Bibles or when they when we're talking around the Lord about the Lord around the supper table that creates strength in our children when they see us handle a situation that in a way that may be the harder way but it was the right way that builds a character in our children my mom I never heard my mom complain about anything in my life and I never heard her she say she was tired she died brothers and sisters she died a terrible suffering death I've never seen seen anybody suffer like my mother suffered for days and weeks and months but she always kept her testimony from the time I was born until the time she passed away that woman had a testimony and it never wavered and it had an effect on us her four children every morning I was always the first one up Mom would squeeze me fresh grapefruit juice and and she she always make me a bowl of oatmeal and she'd she'd take the oatmeal and she'd put the brown sugar and then a thing of butter on the top and she wouldn't mix it in but she just put it right there and then she'd give it to me and I just loved it I would eat around all the way and then I'd get to the Sweet buttery stuff in the middle right and that was the last couple bites I just loved the way that she did that and it was early morning it was like 5:00 Rock would' be up and we'd be talking about the Lord and and just she would ask me little questions what what do you think about this and and it was just it was a precious time and it built a character in me from my mom my brother Jeremy is serving the lord and voice of God Recordings he's a man of integrity and he's honest he's doing everything that he can everything knows how to to get the message out to this Dying World my brother Adam he's preaching every Wednesday he is preaching to Inner City young people he's winning Souls these kids most of them almost none of them have dads or none of them have even met their dad some of them are 25 30 years old and Adam is teaching the Bible that they've never heard before and he's making a difference started with just a few people now there's like 70 of these boxers these Fighters coming on Wednesday night and he's winning these Souls my sister I mentioned her she's she's got five kids at least the last time we counted and she's one of the best Mothers I've ever seen she's stays home to raise the kids they made Financial sacrifices so she could be a mom to them and those kids are absolutely precious you talk about sweet kids and it's because they they got a mom that loves them I think all of this is a testimony to my mom and how she taught us and she made time with each of us and each one of us had that personal relationship with our mother and it produces something in the future it's so important our time is with our children our time with each other and I'll get to this in a minute but sisters you do not have to have biological children to be a mother I really don't think that has anything to do with it it is a spirit that God gave you it is that El Shai that is manifested in a woman of God and it is just it is without equal the Apostle Timothy we've all read the letters to Timothy when Paul writes both of his letters to the Corinthians his letter to the phiman his letters to the Thessalonians to the Romans to the Philippians to the Colossians both the letters to the Thessalonians and even the letter to the Hebrews Timothy's mentioned he listed at the beginning that he seems to co-author Corinthians second Corinthians Philippians Colossians both the letters to Thessalonians and to philimon seems to be a co-author on those Timothy went before Paul to certain places probably to prepare for Paul's arrival and Paul took him with him when he went to Corinth and thessalonica and to Macedonia to preach the gospel of Christ and eventually Paul placed Timothy to be the pastor of the Ephesian church one of the most advanced churches in the New Testament you read the book of Ephesians and it is deep and it is powerful and Timothy was placed to be Pastor over that church this man Timothy was one of the greatest Servants of the Lord in the whole new testimony and he was unique because his mom was Jewish and his dad was Greek and Timothy was one of these new Believers one of these new converts and he may not have looked at looked or act like one of the traditional Jews but Timothy had a gift that Paul identifies and Paul identifies where this gift comes from 1 Timothy chapter 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my dearly beloved Son he's calling him Timothy his son in the gospel to Timothy my dearly beloved Son grace mercy and peace from God the father in Christ Jesus our lord I thank God whom I served from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly Desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy look at the relationship ship that Timothy and Paul had the greatest of all the apostles in Paul with this man Timothy Timothy must have been a man of impeccable character verse five when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first brother Jeremy am I in the right spot okay glad I had your attention First Timothy that's second Timothy I'm sorry second Timothy verse one let's go to let's go down to verse five when I call to remembrance see that's why you gotta use the good old Bible you know and and not and not the electronics all the time they are a blessing verse five when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in my grandmother in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice I am persuaded I am persuaded that is in thee also wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by putting on of my hands for God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind Paul is saying that the gift that's in Timothy was first in his grandmother Lois and then in his mother Eunice and that gift was passed down from eating oatmeal in the morning and talking about the Lord from studying the Bible down to Unice and then Unice had learned from her mother and she was serving oatmeal to her little boy Timothy and she was talking about the Lord and she was talking about the Messiah and she was she was teaching this young man about the word of God and she was instilling not only the word in him but this great character because she had a great character she had a gift as the Apostle said and here it is and it goes right into Timothy the boy and he changed the world he was one of those first ones pastoring one of the greatest churches that's ever been close with one of the greatest Apostles that ever been I wonder how it was growing up in Timothy's House El Shai must have been present in that home really to produce such a great man the um this word elai to me just hearing sister Jessica singing it and and being and listening to it over the past day how beautiful this these words are and what it represents that it's this God that comes to the helpless person and this God is able to pour out that spirit and that love and to take care of that person and to nurture nurture him up comes to Abraham and says you're Barren Sarah you're Barren I know that but look at the Spirit really that our mothers have come and give them a child give them covenants give them a promise encourage our hearts encourage us to do great things but today we don't see that elai anymore now we see that it's it's a it's a shame many times for a woman to have a child to kill it before it's born it's a shame for a woman to have like my sister to have five of these beautiful little babies little little kids running around but she's proud of them I'm proud of them amen and there's not time that's spent we all we all want to blame the world brothers and sisters if you send we want to blame the school system if you send a bad kid to school at 8:00 in the morning you're going to get a bad kid when he gets off the bus at 3:30 but if you send a good kid to school one that has come up in the gospel one that understands the word one that has good parents if you send that kid to school not only is is the kid going to come back a good kid but that kid's going to make other good kids and he's going to have or she's going to have an influence on the others that Spirit of the family and of the parents is going to continue on and as I said in closing we can have the musicians come a woman brothers and sisters doesn't a mother doesn't doesn't mean that she has to have biological children you can still have that Spirit of a mother as a nurturing that elai Spirit where you're taking care of of of a child or or of someone else that nurturing way my aunt Jacqueline she never she was never married she never had children but she's quick to tell you that she has 10 children because that's how many grandmothers she had or how many Grand child children she has and she loves every one of us like a mother loves their children and we're thankful all of us are for the love that we have and it's that Spirit of el Shai coming out in a woman and she's always the Lord's always willing to bring that precious little baby which is you and me into his bosom to take care of us there's one last mother that I'll mention and that's Mary the greatest mother that has ever lived in my opinion she was she had this child brothers and sisters it wasn't even hers it wasn't Joseph's child this was God took a fertilized seed and placed it into this woman and she had that child she loved that child like her own she cared for him Joseph was a good dad he passed away at a at a um when when Jesus was young but it shows you that that love of a mother goes far beyond biology that love of a mother is it's it's a love of God is what it is and as I said it's not from the world this comes directly from the Lord Jesus I want to I want to have one I want to read one more scripture I think I have a few minutes Ephesians chapter 1 verse one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will we consider ourselves Sons and Daughters of Christ but it says here that we are adopted and yet he loves us just as much much as he does his own children shaat and and and um Hannah the Jewish people are the rightful Sons and Daughters of God they have a claim to that but us through adoption we are now his sons and his daughters and we see that that El Shai Spirit come unto me all ye that labor in our heav lad and I will give you rest everyone come to me yes he is Mother amen he has that wonderful spirit that brother Joe you and I could never understand but God has it amen and he wants us all to come in he wants us all to be part of him and I want all of us to benefit from the mothers that we
