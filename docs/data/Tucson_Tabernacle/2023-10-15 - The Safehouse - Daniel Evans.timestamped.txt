[53:29] good to have you back good to have you
[53:31] out of the hospital on your way to
[53:33] recovery welcome back God bless
[53:39] you I um had something on my heart to
[53:43] minister about this morning and it
[53:46] started last week after our service on
[53:51] Sunday I talked about Israel it's not
[53:52] something I talk about very often um
[53:56] because I I know that sometimes and as I
[53:58] said last week sometimes we can go too
[54:00] far in in looking at the signs around us
[54:04] and and remember as I said last week
[54:06] that that prophecy that the
[54:09] interpretation of Prophecy is the
[54:12] Fulfillment of that prophecy it's not
[54:15] what we say about it it's not our ideas
[54:17] about it but it's when it happens is
[54:20] when those prophecies um are interpreted
[54:23] and they're made known just as Peter at
[54:25] the day of Pentecost when Peter saw he
[54:29] saw the pillar of fire come down and
[54:31] resting upon the 120 in the upper room
[54:34] and he saw that they were they were
[54:35] speaking in unknown unkknown tongues and
[54:37] he said this is that which was spoken of
[54:41] by the prophet Joel so when he saw it
[54:44] happen he he saw that it was real and
[54:47] this was what the prophecy was talking
[54:49] about and when I speak this morning I'm
[54:53] gonna stay on the same subject as I was
[54:55] I was last week and as I said I'm
[54:59] careful I don't want to introduce any
[55:01] strange doctrines I don't want
[55:03] to point anybody to anything other than
[55:08] our Lord Jesus Christ and him only as
[55:10] that song that brother Jordan was
[55:12] singing says but I also want to
[55:16] not just close our eyes and not see the
[55:19] things that are going on around us I was
[55:22] on my knees and I was praying
[55:26] early last week I was praying
[55:29] about the um the situation going on in
[55:33] Israel and how we are warned that these
[55:36] things are going to happen it seems like
[55:37] everything always you read the Bible and
[55:41] everything always seems to come back to
[55:43] Jerusalem and Israel there's all kinds
[55:46] of of problems that are going around and
[55:47] it seems like it all everything always
[55:50] just comes back to this one little place
[55:54] in the world world and I think we're
[55:56] seeing that again today and what's
[55:59] happening is as I was praying about that
[56:00] I was asking the Lord I said Lord is
[56:02] written in your word to pray for the
[56:04] Peace of
[56:05] Jerusalem and I see that because
[56:09] everything comes back to that one place
[56:13] that if we're praying for the Peace of
[56:15] Jerusalem that peace also spreads around
[56:18] the world so when we're praying about
[56:20] the Peace of Jerusalem we're also
[56:21] praying Lord for your peace all over
[56:25] over the place and as I was praying for
[56:28] the for Jerusalem and for all of these
[56:31] these men and women that have died and
[56:33] and and become captive and and in a very
[56:37] very difficult
[56:39] situation I finished my prayer and I
[56:43] said these words very common words that
[56:46] should never be common to us I said
[56:49] these words I said in Jesus
[56:53] name and and it struck me really
[56:58] strongly wait a minute they don't have
[57:01] that
[57:02] name they don't understand this man
[57:06] Jesus Christ and what an honor that we
[57:09] have just to bow down on our knees and
[57:12] pray in the name of Jesus Christ when we
[57:15] pray to God it's not just like Lord
[57:17] bless this food in Jesus name amen never
[57:19] say anything like that that's not how we
[57:21] pray when we pray in the name of Jesus
[57:24] it is as if Jesus himself is talking to
[57:28] the father in jesus' name if you go
[57:32] somewhere in the name of the Tucson
[57:35] Tabernacle you are representing the
[57:37] Tucson Tabernacle if you go somewhere in
[57:40] the name of your work you are
[57:43] representing your work and your work is
[57:45] the one responsible for backing you
[57:48] up and the same when we go before the
[57:52] father in the name of Jesus Christ we
[57:54] are praying as is if it's Jesus himself
[57:58] speaking so we should never take those
[58:00] things lightly and I was as I was
[58:03] praying it just struck me I was really
[58:05] taken back that I that I'm able to pray
[58:08] in that
[58:09] name and my mind went to a friend of
[58:14] mine many of you know him he was uh
[58:18] Peter mcfaden and and his wife had met
[58:22] him and and he had just this young man
[58:25] was he he's a
[58:28] Jew
[58:29] and Peter had uh invited him to church
[58:33] and I believe it was on a Wednesday
[58:34] night and I was preaching this is over
[58:37] well over a year
[58:38] ago and uh maybe about a year ago and I
[58:43] felt on my heart to preach about
[58:47] baptism and as I was as I was
[58:50] ministering on baptism it was I pointed
[58:53] out that it's very important that when
[58:55] we are baptized we are baptized in a
[58:59] name and not in something that is a a
[59:03] title or something that doesn't mean
[59:06] much but in a name and there is a name
[59:10] ass associated with our walk with the
[59:13] Lord and as I was ministering the the uh
[59:17] the young Jewish man was here in the
[59:19] front and he's actually a he was in the
[59:23] IDF for a while he's
[59:25] Soldier and uh and really a great man if
[59:28] if you know him he's um just you look at
[59:33] him you see he's a
[59:34] warrior this guy is I believe he's a um
[59:37] now he's a professor um he works at the
[59:39] U OFA we go to lunch every once in a
[59:42] while and I was uh so I started thinking
[59:46] about
[59:47] him and he just really came on my heart
[59:51] because of all this that's going on in
[59:53] Israel and these these armies that are
[59:55] that that are now mobilizing to invade
[59:59] Gaza and so I reached out to him a
[1:00:03] couple days ago he didn't answer my
[1:00:07] call and I thought well I'll I'll just
[1:00:10] leave him alone so then I tried to call
[1:00:13] him again the next day he didn't answer
[1:00:15] my call but he text me
[1:00:16] back and I I feel that it would be okay
[1:00:19] with him if I if I read his text to
[1:00:23] you think
[1:00:28] about he's he's Jewish again he was in
[1:00:31] the Jewish
[1:00:33] military he says this he says hi brother
[1:00:36] Dan I'm
[1:00:38] sorry I'm just too overwhelmed with
[1:00:41] emotion and Life to talk at this
[1:00:44] moment I'm sure you
[1:00:46] know that the entire people of Israel is
[1:00:49] locked in
[1:00:51] horror and I noticed that our brother's
[1:00:54] very educated and and when he says this
[1:00:57] he says the entire people is locked in
[1:00:59] horror is is a singular verb and it
[1:01:04] represents a
[1:01:06] singular people in one
[1:01:09] body he says the entire people of Israel
[1:01:12] is locked in horror many of us are stuck
[1:01:15] in the first stage of grief and
[1:01:19] denial how can this possibly have
[1:01:22] happened to us on the most joyous day of
[1:01:25] the year simcat Torah the rejoicing of
[1:01:28] the Torah when we celebrate God's word
[1:01:31] by dancing with the Torah Scrolls and
[1:01:35] thousands of my brothers and sisters
[1:01:37] were slaughtered and brutalized and
[1:01:39] kidnapped on this
[1:01:41] day their blood cries out to
[1:01:45] me my
[1:01:47] soul is in
[1:01:49] unbearable
[1:01:52] anguish it's a
[1:01:55] read his
[1:01:57] text
[1:01:59] thought look at the
[1:02:01] burden that this
[1:02:04] man has for his own people look at the
[1:02:08] love that he has for these people like
[1:02:10] they are his closest friends his his
[1:02:13] brothers and his sisters and yet he
[1:02:15] probably knows very few of
[1:02:17] them yet he says their blood is crying
[1:02:20] out to
[1:02:22] me and it took me back saying Lord do I
[1:02:25] have that type of love in my
[1:02:30] heart I look
[1:02:33] at what's going on there in in Gaza and
[1:02:37] and and the fighting that's going on and
[1:02:40] there are
[1:02:42] hundreds or thousands maybe of Americans
[1:02:46] that are
[1:02:47] stranded and yet we won't send an
[1:02:50] airplane our government won't send
[1:02:53] transportation to bring them back home
[1:02:55] and countries throughout Europe they
[1:02:56] have to get they have to get on a flight
[1:02:57] and go to Europe and then come
[1:03:00] home and we our own
[1:03:03] countrymen we won't
[1:03:06] send help to bring them
[1:03:09] out and I read David's text and I
[1:03:12] thought look at the difference between
[1:03:15] me as an
[1:03:16] American and this man how much he loves
[1:03:20] his
[1:03:22] people made me think about Matthew 24
[1:03:25] and if we could turn in our Bibles to
[1:03:27] Matthew 24 verse4 our lord Jesus is
[1:03:31] speaking gives us warning of the end
[1:03:34] time warning of when that the second
[1:03:38] coming of Christ is at hand and he says
[1:03:41] this take heed that no man deceive
[1:03:46] you for many shall come in my name
[1:03:48] saying I am the Christ and shall deceive
[1:03:51] many and ye shall hear of wars and
[1:03:53] rumors of wars see that you be not
[1:03:55] troubled for all these things must come
[1:03:58] to
[1:03:59] pass but the end is not
[1:04:01] yet for nation shall rise against nation
[1:04:04] and Kingdom against Kingdom and there
[1:04:06] shall be famines and pestilence and
[1:04:08] earthquakes in diverse places these are
[1:04:10] the beginning of
[1:04:12] Sorrows and they shall deliver you up to
[1:04:14] be afflicted and shall kill you and you
[1:04:16] shall be hated of all Nations for my
[1:04:18] name's sake and then shall many be
[1:04:21] offended and shall betray one another
[1:04:24] and shall hate one another and many
[1:04:27] false prophets shall
[1:04:31] arise tell and deceive
[1:04:35] many and because iniquity shall
[1:04:39] abound the love of many shall wax
[1:04:44] cold reading that and thinking where is
[1:04:47] the love that was present where is the
[1:04:50] love that's present in this man's text
[1:04:54] to
[1:04:54] me where is that love among the people
[1:04:58] of the world that they they love each
[1:05:00] other so much that they would be willing
[1:05:02] to do
[1:05:04] anything to help
[1:05:08] them and the love of many shall actx
[1:05:11] cold I thought truly we are in this last
[1:05:15] day this Matthew chapter
[1:05:17] 24 I'm going to tell a
[1:05:19] story from the last few chapters in The
[1:05:23] Book of
[1:05:25] judges
[1:05:26] and it it starts with in there in those
[1:05:30] days there was no king in Israel there
[1:05:32] was no leadership in Israel so it's kind
[1:05:34] of given the the the qualifying
[1:05:37] statement like hey this is because there
[1:05:39] wasn't any good leadership in Israel so
[1:05:42] I want to qualify it with that and it
[1:05:45] ends with the same statement saying that
[1:05:48] there was no king in Israel and Men did
[1:05:50] what was right in their own
[1:05:52] eyes so what happens in this story and
[1:05:55] as I said it's in the last three
[1:05:56] chapters of the Book of Judges and I'm
[1:05:59] going to give you the watered down
[1:06:00] version um and the reason I'm going to
[1:06:03] give you the water down version is
[1:06:05] because there's some pretty
[1:06:06] heavyduty um things going
[1:06:09] on that it's maybe not
[1:06:13] appropriate for me to uh say it from the
[1:06:18] uh the pull pit so with the kids um if
[1:06:22] you want to know some of the det s uh
[1:06:25] ask your parents after service and maybe
[1:06:27] you can talk about it um and good luck
[1:06:30] parents with with explaining this story
[1:06:34] I think about you know I think about how
[1:06:36] good how wonderful this book is and and
[1:06:38] how interesting it is and and just how
[1:06:40] blessed it is I think about I've told
[1:06:42] the story a couple times I think about
[1:06:44] Nathan Taylor stood over there you
[1:06:46] standing out in the field with your
[1:06:48] cousin and you guys are reading out of
[1:06:50] the Book of Genesis and just the
[1:06:52] excitement that you both had this book
[1:06:54] is full of excitement it's full of great
[1:06:57] stories it's it's full of love it's got
[1:07:02] everything in it so this man in judges
[1:07:06] he's a levite he from the tribe of
[1:07:08] Levi he goes and and he has what's
[1:07:11] called a concubine and a concubine back
[1:07:13] then was was somebody that maybe a woman
[1:07:16] that maybe back then wasn't worthy of
[1:07:17] marriage to this man but he he still may
[1:07:20] have loved her or um it it was it was to
[1:07:23] have children or whatever it might be
[1:07:25] well this man this levite his concubine
[1:07:28] had left him and she had gone to be with
[1:07:29] her dad and and he goes and finds her
[1:07:33] and he tracks her down and and and he
[1:07:35] talks with the with the dad and he ends
[1:07:38] up bringing the
[1:07:40] girl his for uh his wife for his
[1:07:44] concubine back with him and he's going
[1:07:48] home and it's getting dark and he comes
[1:07:51] to the city and one of the men that was
[1:07:54] with him was was like well let's stay in
[1:07:57] this city and he says no he says don't
[1:07:59] feel comfortable staying in this city
[1:08:01] because these are not our people they're
[1:08:04] not Jewish people of course Levi was of
[1:08:07] the one of the 12 tribes of Israel the
[1:08:09] the ancestors to the Jewish people he
[1:08:12] says let's go on to this next
[1:08:15] town and so it's continued to getting
[1:08:18] dark and he goes down to this next town
[1:08:20] which is
[1:08:21] giba and he can't find anybody that he
[1:08:24] can stay with them so he stays he goes
[1:08:27] and he sets up camp in the city Square
[1:08:30] in the middle and this old man comes up
[1:08:33] to him and he's like hey what what are
[1:08:35] you doing and they're like well we're
[1:08:36] gonna stay stay here the night he's like
[1:08:38] no it's not such a good idea here why
[1:08:41] don't you come and stay with me so he
[1:08:43] goes with with his concubine and with
[1:08:46] with the other guys that were with him
[1:08:48] and he stays with this man well there
[1:08:50] were some very evil men that were were
[1:08:54] watching all of this happen perverted
[1:08:58] men and they followed this man to this
[1:09:02] old man's house and they knock on the
[1:09:05] door and they say hey send this new man
[1:09:09] out because we want to basically do the
[1:09:13] same thing that happened in Sodom and
[1:09:15] Gomorrah
[1:09:17] and he said remember I'm trying to give
[1:09:19] the Fairly maybe PG rated version of
[1:09:23] this and he says well he says and things
[1:09:25] were different back then he says well
[1:09:27] take just ends up sending out his
[1:09:29] concubine and they take this woman and
[1:09:32] they ended
[1:09:33] up um abusing her and ended up killing
[1:09:37] her and leaving her on the doorstep of
[1:09:39] the old
[1:09:40] man and so the levite picks her up
[1:09:44] throws her on his
[1:09:46] donkey and goes
[1:09:48] home very
[1:09:51] upset so he gets her home
[1:09:55] and he sends out packages to all the 12
[1:09:58] tribes of
[1:10:00] Judah all 12 tribes of Israel saying
[1:10:03] here's what
[1:10:05] happened and again ask your parents what
[1:10:08] was in the
[1:10:09] packages and
[1:10:11] um sometimes your Bible you're like you
[1:10:13] look at it you're like whoa no
[1:10:16] way yeah it's
[1:10:19] there and so he sends these packages out
[1:10:23] and he gets all of Israel fired up
[1:10:27] really upset and they come as one
[1:10:30] unit and they say okay what are we going
[1:10:33] to do against this town of giba which is
[1:10:36] of the tribe of Benjamin one of the 12
[1:10:39] tribes so they end up organizing a force
[1:10:42] and they ask the Lord about it and he
[1:10:44] says go forward they end up organizing a
[1:10:46] force and going to battle and these men
[1:10:48] of Benjamin were really the greatest
[1:10:51] warriors in all the country that they
[1:10:53] were fighting against so they lose tens
[1:10:56] of thousands of people and then they go
[1:10:59] back and they go fight them again and
[1:11:01] again Benjamin The Tribe of Benjamin
[1:11:03] wins and then
[1:11:05] finally they send
[1:11:07] out the armies again and they Conquer
[1:11:12] The Tribe of Benjamin they conquer it so
[1:11:17] strongly that it almost wipes out the
[1:11:20] entire race the entire Tribe of Benjamin
[1:11:25] so
[1:11:26] then the other 11 tribes they feel bad
[1:11:31] about this this whole situation though
[1:11:33] so they say we can't let one of our own
[1:11:36] tribes go
[1:11:38] extinct there's only I think 600 men
[1:11:41] left in Benjamin so and they killed they
[1:11:46] killed all the women they killed all the
[1:11:47] children they killed everybody when they
[1:11:50] went into this when they fought against
[1:11:52] this Tribe of Benjamin so
[1:11:54] it ends up to where they they go and
[1:11:57] they conquer another city and they kill
[1:11:59] everybody again except
[1:12:01] for certain women and they take those
[1:12:04] women and they marry them off to the
[1:12:07] Tribe of Benjamin I know it's a very
[1:12:08] strange story um but it's it's really
[1:12:10] strange if you read it but it's um it's
[1:12:13] the
[1:12:14] word so they they end up doing this but
[1:12:18] you see there you see the rage that was
[1:12:22] produced
[1:12:24] when just this one Mo woman that
[1:12:27] belonged to this
[1:12:31] levite what happened to
[1:12:34] her and you see
[1:12:37] Israel how they they took such care in
[1:12:41] their own people they conquered them and
[1:12:43] then they said well we can't wipe them
[1:12:45] out so we got to help them you see this
[1:12:47] comaraderie that's not anywhere else I
[1:12:49] believe in the world and remember these
[1:12:53] people people in Israel today are
[1:12:55] descendants maybe 3,000 years ago or
[1:12:57] whatever it is they're descendants of
[1:12:59] these 12
[1:13:02] tribes so
[1:13:04] now we look and we see that Israel as I
[1:13:10] said last week it's been almost it was
[1:13:14] 1900 and something
[1:13:16] years that
[1:13:18] Israel the the early
[1:13:21] 1900s we see
[1:13:24] this anti-Semitism
[1:13:26] start and we see the Jewish people they
[1:13:30] start to be pulled back to their
[1:13:35] Homeland and there's always been this
[1:13:38] great
[1:13:39] hatred of of these Jewish
[1:13:42] people and they they start they come
[1:13:46] back they start coming back to their
[1:13:48] Homeland there was these 12 people that
[1:13:51] came from Europe and there was 10 men
[1:13:54] and two women and they started in the in
[1:13:58] the early 1900s they they came home they
[1:14:02] they ran away from the persecution that
[1:14:04] was happening there and they started a
[1:14:06] farm just south of the Sea of Galilee
[1:14:09] called the
[1:14:10] kots and so they they started this Farm
[1:14:14] the farm grew and then these these
[1:14:16] little settlements they started going
[1:14:19] they started popping up all over this
[1:14:21] land of Israel those are going to come
[1:14:23] up later
[1:14:25] on and as this anti-Semitism grew in in
[1:14:29] Russia and millions of of them started
[1:14:31] being exterminated and it started to
[1:14:33] grow with Hitler in Germany and in
[1:14:38] Poland and millions of Jews started
[1:14:42] being exterminated they wanted a place
[1:14:45] to go where they could be
[1:14:48] safe and as history suggests the only
[1:14:51] place that they feel safe is is among
[1:14:53] their own
[1:14:55] people so as
[1:15:00] this anti-Semitism and as as this
[1:15:03] extermination of the Jews continued on
[1:15:06] in World War II and in stalling Russia
[1:15:10] they came
[1:15:12] home and they formed this country called
[1:15:19] Israel and we know
[1:15:21] that that in
[1:15:24] 1948 Israel the United Nations publicly
[1:15:28] announced that this Israel would become
[1:15:30] a nation and their plan was the un's
[1:15:34] plan was to
[1:15:36] partition Israel into an Arab side and a
[1:15:39] Jewish
[1:15:41] side and the Jews said we agree the Arab
[1:15:45] says no we don't agree so the day
[1:15:50] after that they had made this nation
[1:15:53] the Arab countries attacked
[1:15:56] Israel and it
[1:15:57] was it should have been a Slaughter they
[1:16:00] had no organized army they had no really
[1:16:02] way to fight they they had a few people
[1:16:04] that were trained what happened was
[1:16:07] American Jews started coming in with
[1:16:09] fighter fighter
[1:16:10] planes totally outgun outnumbered and
[1:16:13] then the Lord fights for Israel and
[1:16:18] protects
[1:16:19] them and then we see after that
[1:16:25] we see that in
[1:16:27] 1967 the Arab Nations they got together
[1:16:31] they got their buddies together with
[1:16:32] Iraq and Lebanon and and Jordan and and
[1:16:37] um especially Egypt and they again
[1:16:40] attacked these Jewish people and God
[1:16:43] again delivered them in amazing amazing
[1:16:48] way Miracle after Miracle after Miracle
[1:16:52] trying to exterminate at these people
[1:16:54] Genesis 121 says this now the Lord said
[1:16:58] unto Abraham get thee out of thy country
[1:17:01] and from thy Kindred and from th
[1:17:02] father's house and unto the land that I
[1:17:04] will show thee and I will make of thee a
[1:17:07] great nation and I will bless thee and
[1:17:10] make thy name great and thou shalt be a
[1:17:12] blessing and I will bless them that
[1:17:14] bless thee and curse them that curse
[1:17:16] thee and in thee shall all the families
[1:17:19] of the earth be
[1:17:22] blessed so we see that that this nation
[1:17:25] of Israel whether you agree with them or
[1:17:28] not they are blessed by the word of
[1:17:31] God Zechariah 12 verse one says this the
[1:17:35] burden of the Lord for Israel saith
[1:17:39] sayeth the Lord which stretcheth forth
[1:17:41] the heavens and layeth the foundation of
[1:17:43] the earth and forth the spirit of man
[1:17:44] within behold I will make Jerusalem a
[1:17:47] cou of trembling unto the people round
[1:17:49] about when they shall be in The Siege
[1:17:52] both against Judah and against Jerusalem
[1:17:55] and in that day will I make Jerusalem a
[1:17:57] burdensome stone for all the people all
[1:18:01] that burden themselves with it shall be
[1:18:03] cut in pieces though all the people of
[1:18:06] the
[1:18:07] earth be gathered together against
[1:18:12] it prophesying here that everyone is
[1:18:16] going to be against this little country
[1:18:18] but I the Lord will fight for them
[1:18:21] Ezekiel chapter 38 listen to this and
[1:18:24] tell me which side that you want to be
[1:18:26] on Verse 18 and it shall come to
[1:18:30] pass at the same time when Gog God
[1:18:34] represents the countries from the North
[1:18:36] and the East like Russia and Iran and
[1:18:39] others shall come against the land of
[1:18:41] Israel sayeth the Lord God that my Fury
[1:18:45] shall come up in my face for I for in my
[1:18:49] jealousy and in the fire of my wrath
[1:18:52] have I spoken surely in that day there
[1:18:55] shall be a great shaking in the land of
[1:18:58] Israel so that the fishes of the Sea and
[1:19:01] the fowls of the Heaven and the beasts
[1:19:02] of the field and all the all the
[1:19:04] creeping things that creep upon the
[1:19:06] Earth and all men that are upon the face
[1:19:08] of the Earth shall shake at my presence
[1:19:11] and the mountain shall be thrown down
[1:19:13] and the Steep places shall fall and
[1:19:15] every wall shall fall to the ground and
[1:19:19] I will call for a sword against him
[1:19:21] throughout all my mountains sayith the
[1:19:23] Lord God every man's sword shall be
[1:19:25] against his brother and I will plead
[1:19:27] against him with pestilence and with
[1:19:30] blood and I will reign upon him and upon
[1:19:32] his hands and upon the many people that
[1:19:35] are with him and overflowing rain and
[1:19:38] great hailstones and fire and brim
[1:19:40] Stones thus will I magnify myself and
[1:19:44] sanctify myself and I will be known in
[1:19:47] the eyes of many nations and they shall
[1:19:49] know that I am the Lord
[1:19:54] which side do you want to be
[1:19:56] on God is fighting for
[1:20:00] Israel then immediately after this 1967
[1:20:05] war that they won they had an Arab
[1:20:07] Summit in
[1:20:10] Sudan they said the three famous NOS all
[1:20:15] of these Arab groups got together three
[1:20:17] NOS no recognition of Israel's right to
[1:20:21] exist as a nation
[1:20:23] no peace we will never have peace with
[1:20:27] Israel and no negotiations these things
[1:20:30] are not
[1:20:32] negotiable they made their stand and
[1:20:35] they reiterated that stand that we will
[1:20:37] not have peace with this
[1:20:41] country and then in
[1:20:43] 1973 the yam Kapur War happened in
[1:20:47] October and again the Arab countries
[1:20:49] gathered all their friends together and
[1:20:51] they came against Israel Israel and
[1:20:54] Israel fought for their lives once again
[1:20:55] and Israel defeated
[1:20:57] them now 50 years
[1:21:00] later that was the last time that Israel
[1:21:03] declared war on another
[1:21:05] Nation exactly 50 years to the
[1:21:08] day the attack was made from Gaza onto
[1:21:14] the Israeli
[1:21:16] people Prim back in we know what Gaza is
[1:21:20] back in 2005 and I'm trying to lay
[1:21:22] Foundation of what's going on so we all
[1:21:24] kind of understand the situation over
[1:21:26] there in 2005 the prime minister of
[1:21:29] Israel Ariel Chiron he made a decision
[1:21:31] to withdraw the troops out of Gaza
[1:21:34] brother if you can put that picture up
[1:21:36] just so we know where we're
[1:21:38] at that they could withdraw all the
[1:21:42] troops out of the Gaza Strip now Gaza
[1:21:45] here you see it down in the lower left
[1:21:47] part of Israel where the pointer is
[1:21:49] there that's a it's a small place but
[1:21:51] there was there were thousands of Jewish
[1:21:54] settlers there there were thousands of
[1:21:55] farmers there there was the the Israeli
[1:21:59] defense um force and then there was also
[1:22:02] police and all that so Ariel Chiron says
[1:22:05] okay we'll give you the Gaza Strip we'll
[1:22:08] pull out all of our
[1:22:10] people that was in
[1:22:14] 2005 and and you can see there in Gaza
[1:22:18] it it borders Egypt and and you see
[1:22:21] Israel well the people came out the the
[1:22:23] Jewish people came out of that
[1:22:25] area and that was in 2005 thank you
[1:22:28] brother Jeremy that was in 2005 then in
[1:22:32] 2006 they elected this group called
[1:22:36] Hamas to govern they had a vote and they
[1:22:40] elected this group Hamas to govern um
[1:22:44] Gaza this newly independent area of
[1:22:47] Israel called
[1:22:48] Gaza and um Hamas is an acronym for the
[1:22:51] Islamic resistance movement it was
[1:22:53] started by a militant group called The
[1:22:55] mus Muslim Brotherhood and that was the
[1:22:58] last time that they
[1:23:00] voted and the Hamas Charter and I'd like
[1:23:03] to read a couple things that this Hamas
[1:23:05] Charter says and it's a a series of 36
[1:23:10] articles in it Article 13 says this
[1:23:13] there is no solution for the Palestinian
[1:23:16] question except through Jihad sort of
[1:23:19] like a religious war and fighting and
[1:23:22] initiatives proposals and international
[1:23:25] conferences are a waste of time and vain
[1:23:31] Endeavors and all of these different
[1:23:33] articles that they have there are
[1:23:35] basically laying a foundation for this
[1:23:39] the the situation with Israel and it's
[1:23:41] basically we will never recognize these
[1:23:44] people we want them
[1:23:46] gone and I as I was reading these
[1:23:49] articles I did I
[1:23:50] did think one part of it was a little
[1:23:53] bit humorous and it defines the role
[1:23:55] article 18 defines the role of women as
[1:23:57] Homemakers and child rearers and I think
[1:24:00] wow the LI the Liberals support
[1:24:03] Palestinians and uh I thought but if a
[1:24:06] pastor preaches that kind of thing he
[1:24:07] gets
[1:24:10] attacked Hamas attacked Israel on the
[1:24:13] 50th
[1:24:14] anniversary of the yam Kapur
[1:24:18] War and what did it
[1:24:20] accomplish like to ask you all to ask
[1:24:23] yourselves what why would they do this
[1:24:27] they know they can't win and if they're
[1:24:29] backed by Iran why would what would aan
[1:24:31] hope to accomplish by having these men
[1:24:34] fly over the walls go under the walls
[1:24:39] and go through the the the walls and to
[1:24:41] attack these these areas the kabut I
[1:24:46] don't know what the plural of Kuts is
[1:24:48] but these little farms in these
[1:24:51] settlements what did they hope to do
[1:24:54] they're not going to win a war with
[1:24:56] Israel no they don't think
[1:24:59] that but I think
[1:25:02] that
[1:25:04] Israel has been actively seeking peace
[1:25:07] and negotiations with their neighbors
[1:25:10] Saudi Arabia in
[1:25:12] particular and you look at what's going
[1:25:15] on J you can turn you can put the M map
[1:25:17] off so you see what's what's going on
[1:25:20] there why would Iran and these militant
[1:25:23] groups why would they
[1:25:25] encourage the Israelis or why would they
[1:25:28] encourage Hamas to go and attack these
[1:25:31] innocent
[1:25:32] people what they want to
[1:25:35] do is they want to
[1:25:39] see dead women and children
[1:25:45] Palestinian women and children on the
[1:25:49] news I'm not picking on the news media
[1:25:55] but what do they want to see they want
[1:25:58] to see these
[1:26:00] images of these dead Palestinian
[1:26:03] children because Israel remember the
[1:26:05] story in in U judges Israel is going to
[1:26:09] come in and they are going to fight and
[1:26:12] these people are there's going to be
[1:26:14] innocent lives lost and they are going
[1:26:17] to show these people on the
[1:26:21] news and it's going to
[1:26:24] create a negative opinion of this
[1:26:28] country of
[1:26:29] Israel that's why you always he use
[1:26:34] restraint use restraint and and many of
[1:26:37] us are like yeah go get them fight them
[1:26:39] they they attacked you go get them and
[1:26:41] kill them but wait a
[1:26:43] minute if they go
[1:26:46] in people are going to die innocent
[1:26:49] people are going to die children are
[1:26:50] going to die women are are going to die
[1:26:53] and they're going to put those people on
[1:26:55] the news to sway public
[1:26:58] opinion and now even we look at Saudi
[1:27:01] Arabia they started to turn from Israel
[1:27:03] now over to
[1:27:05] Iran in their talks and we're already
[1:27:09] seeing it on college
[1:27:12] campuses Israel has no right to go in
[1:27:14] there and they're going to start showing
[1:27:16] these images of these these dead
[1:27:19] people and it's going to sway
[1:27:23] opinion and that's the whole thing every
[1:27:27] country all countries are going to come
[1:27:29] against this Israel how is that going to
[1:27:32] happen I'm not saying that this is I'm
[1:27:34] not trying to prophesy or saying that
[1:27:36] this is going to be the way it happens
[1:27:38] but look at what's going on they watch
[1:27:41] on
[1:27:43] television these dead
[1:27:46] Palestinians it's Israel's fault how
[1:27:48] dare
[1:27:50] they and it starts to change public
[1:27:54] opinion and if they go too far you're
[1:27:57] going to see everyone saying hey you're
[1:27:59] going too far
[1:28:02] now and it could bring all countries
[1:28:05] against this Israel and here is Israel
[1:28:11] these people that have come through the
[1:28:13] Holocaust they have been attacked
[1:28:16] defenseless men women
[1:28:20] babies killed in this
[1:28:24] attack and you look back at the fifth
[1:28:28] seal we understand from Brother brandom
[1:28:30] teaching that here are these Souls that
[1:28:33] are under the Altar and they're crying
[1:28:35] out to avenge our
[1:28:38] blood how long Lord are you going to
[1:28:41] wait until you avenge our blood here's
[1:28:44] the Rage of these people that have been
[1:28:46] done wrong they want
[1:28:50] revenge and and now we see them going
[1:28:55] in I believe in the Lord's
[1:28:58] will but now watch how everyone is going
[1:29:01] to
[1:29:03] see this happen we see in Revelation 11
[1:29:07] we see that there would come to these
[1:29:10] Jewish people in Jerusalem there would
[1:29:11] be these two
[1:29:13] witnesses they would be preaching the
[1:29:17] gospel and yet they would be killed and
[1:29:19] lay in the streets for three days and
[1:29:22] the whole world would see it how would
[1:29:25] the whole world see
[1:29:27] it without
[1:29:30] this spoken of in Revelation 11 how can
[1:29:33] the whole world see something well you
[1:29:36] see it because it's on
[1:29:37] television it's on the
[1:29:40] internet so they see this all of this
[1:29:43] that's going on in Gaza and you watch
[1:29:46] these these protests are going to get
[1:29:48] more and they're going to get more as
[1:29:49] this if they do have a ground invasion
[1:29:52] and people start dying and they have
[1:29:55] to because they build their they build
[1:29:58] their safe houses underneath hospitals
[1:30:01] and underneath schools and all that it's
[1:30:04] going to happen and you're going to see
[1:30:06] more and more negative sentiment come I
[1:30:09] pray that he has Mercy I pray that this
[1:30:13] isn't the beginning of something really
[1:30:16] big so we see we see all of this
[1:30:19] happening and as I said don't get too
[1:30:22] caught up as I said last week with the
[1:30:25] alarm clock God's time
[1:30:28] piece we see it there and it should wake
[1:30:31] us
[1:30:32] up that these time the time is
[1:30:36] late now if the time is late what about
[1:30:40] us what are we
[1:30:42] doing how are we getting our lives
[1:30:48] straight when they
[1:30:50] went when Hamas
[1:30:53] attacked it was in an hour no one
[1:30:56] thought it was going to happen how many
[1:30:59] times have you heard Jesus say in
[1:31:01] reading your Bible it'll be in an hour
[1:31:04] when you think not that the Lord will
[1:31:06] come he'll come as a thief in the night
[1:31:10] it's going to be like it was in the days
[1:31:12] of Noah they're like oh everything's
[1:31:14] good I'm just going on living my life
[1:31:16] and everything's good marrying and and
[1:31:19] giving in marriage and eating and
[1:31:20] drinking like nothing else is happening
[1:31:23] and then boom it's over and you missed
[1:31:26] it I missed it if we're not
[1:31:30] ready
[1:31:32] so when Hamas
[1:31:34] attacked it was a secret they kept it
[1:31:38] very
[1:31:40] hidden they had bulldozzer come in and
[1:31:44] knock down the fence and they came in
[1:31:46] through motorbikes there that way they
[1:31:48] flew in with ultral light air planes two
[1:31:52] of them on top on those and flying in
[1:31:55] and and coming in and attacking then
[1:31:57] they went under the tunnels they had
[1:31:59] every way that they had they sent these
[1:32:01] drones over and they had grenades or
[1:32:03] bombs on them they they would drop them
[1:32:05] on the on the communication devices so
[1:32:08] the Israelis couldn't talk to each other
[1:32:10] they came in in as quiet and as easy as
[1:32:13] they could and then they started
[1:32:15] massacring
[1:32:17] people and I want to relate us to
[1:32:20] this they come in the Israeli people had
[1:32:26] these things called safe
[1:32:27] houses and there are places that they
[1:32:30] would go to in their house a safe room
[1:32:33] that's fortified so when the bombs start
[1:32:37] dropping they had a place to go that was
[1:32:41] safe the attackers knew where these
[1:32:44] places
[1:32:45] were they knew these homes they knew
[1:32:48] what these Israelis had been trained to
[1:32:50] do when the siren starts going off they
[1:32:54] knew to go into your safe house because
[1:32:57] they're used to the bombs coming from
[1:32:59] the
[1:33:02] sky so
[1:33:04] when this
[1:33:07] happened they came
[1:33:10] in
[1:33:12] and they all went to their safe their
[1:33:15] safe
[1:33:16] houses and the attackers knew exactly
[1:33:20] where they would be they
[1:33:24] came and they were locked they're in
[1:33:27] there and they would either kidnap them
[1:33:30] kill them burn their houses around them
[1:33:34] they knew where these people would be
[1:33:37] but there were a few there was a there
[1:33:39] was a
[1:33:42] grandfather he heard that this attack
[1:33:44] was going on he had a he had a pistol
[1:33:47] this grandfather gets in his car and
[1:33:49] goes to his grandchildren with his
[1:33:52] pistol and fights off the attackers and
[1:33:54] saves his
[1:33:55] grandchildren there's another one I just
[1:33:57] read this morning that there's a man
[1:34:00] that he was he was in his safe house
[1:34:01] with his family and they barricaded the
[1:34:04] door and the the the attacker started
[1:34:07] shooting through the door and he could
[1:34:09] see the little holes and he had his gun
[1:34:11] in there and he returned
[1:34:14] fire and then they left they came back
[1:34:18] with a grenade
[1:34:20] launcher got it up to his shoulder boom
[1:34:22] he shoots the guy in the leg they take
[1:34:25] off he protects his family he protects
[1:34:27] his his his loved
[1:34:30] ones it's not
[1:34:33] all friends it's not all about
[1:34:36] defense it's not all about just hiding
[1:34:40] in your safe
[1:34:42] house that's what where so many people
[1:34:45] make their mistake is I'm going to just
[1:34:47] I'm just going to get in my little house
[1:34:49] I'm going to hide and I know that if the
[1:34:51] bombs come I'm going to be safe but what
[1:34:53] if the enemy comes right into your house
[1:34:56] are your children
[1:34:58] trained are you
[1:35:00] trained to fight
[1:35:03] back Tim I'm not talking about a
[1:35:05] Insurrection reprising here I'm talking
[1:35:07] about spiritual things see it in the
[1:35:10] paper this guy's trying to start a
[1:35:12] [Laughter]
[1:35:14] war
[1:35:15] but they they were able to fight back
[1:35:18] those ones that could fight instead of
[1:35:20] just hunkering down in our little our
[1:35:23] little safe house it could be our
[1:35:28] tomb we must be able to come out and to
[1:35:32] fight for the Lord how do we fight we
[1:35:35] fight in prayer we fight in study we go
[1:35:37] out and get the lost loved ones and
[1:35:40] bring them back not hunker down in our
[1:35:43] safe house afraid that something's going
[1:35:46] to happen to us that's right teach our
[1:35:48] children here is the word here here is
[1:35:51] how you preach the gospel here is how
[1:35:53] you go out and you get a lost soul and
[1:35:56] bring that person back just like these
[1:35:58] old generals there were 65 70 year old
[1:36:02] generals that when this when they heard
[1:36:04] this was going on on their phones they
[1:36:07] got what they had and they went to
[1:36:10] battle against these
[1:36:12] Invaders God blessed them saved many
[1:36:16] because they were
[1:36:19] trained and the same for us
[1:36:23] we
[1:36:25] must not hunker down and be afraid of
[1:36:29] the devil coming against
[1:36:32] us the gospel is not always
[1:36:37] defensive sometimes you go on the
[1:36:39] offense and you go and you get those
[1:36:42] lost souls and you bring them
[1:36:45] back Ephesians chapter
[1:36:50] 6
[1:36:53] says
[1:36:54] this verse
[1:36:56] 10 the Apostle Paul speaking he says
[1:36:58] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:37:01] Lord and in the power of His might put
[1:37:04] on the whole armor of God that you may
[1:37:06] be able to stand against the Ws of the
[1:37:08] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:37:11] and
[1:37:12] blood but against
[1:37:14] principalities it's
[1:37:16] not in this case what I'm speaking of
[1:37:19] today it's not a flesh and blood B
[1:37:22] battle for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:37:24] and blood but against principalities
[1:37:26] against Powers against the rulers of
[1:37:28] Darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:37:30] wickedness in high
[1:37:32] places the stakes are higher from for
[1:37:36] us and the devil coming into our homes
[1:37:39] to kill us than it is for our
[1:37:45] flesh
[1:37:47] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:37:50] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:37:52] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:37:59] stand stand therefore having your loins
[1:38:01] gir about with
[1:38:04] truth and having your bless breastplate
[1:38:07] of
[1:38:07] righteousness and your feet Shaw with
[1:38:10] the
[1:38:11] preparation of the gospel of
[1:38:15] peace and above all take the shield of
[1:38:19] Faith wherewith you shall be able to
[1:38:20] Quin all the fiery darts of the
[1:38:26] wicked look at this everything that I've
[1:38:29] said is
[1:38:30] defensive you're covered with armor
[1:38:33] you're holding the shield of Faith you
[1:38:35] have the helmet of salvation on these
[1:38:37] things are defensive to protect us and
[1:38:39] our families this is this safe house
[1:38:41] yeah we fortify this so if the bombs
[1:38:43] come raining down we can get to safety
[1:38:49] but take the h and take the helmet of
[1:38:52] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:38:55] which is the word of
[1:38:58] God it's not all getting into the safe
[1:39:01] house and hunkering down a sword is not
[1:39:04] a defense defensive weapon a sword is
[1:39:08] for offense a sword is used to strike
[1:39:10] the enemy and how do we do
[1:39:14] that praying
[1:39:16] always with all prayer and supplication
[1:39:18] in the spirit and watching there unto
[1:39:20] with all perseverance and supplication
[1:39:22] for All
[1:39:24] Saints remember David's
[1:39:27] text what a burden that he had for his
[1:39:31] people says right here with all
[1:39:35] perseverance and supplications for All
[1:39:37] Saints how much do we fall
[1:39:40] short a brother or a sister is going
[1:39:43] through something
[1:39:45] hard and we just get into our safe house
[1:39:50] put our feet up watching on Fox
[1:39:55] news or are we going to battle for these
[1:39:59] people are we really praying for them is
[1:40:02] there really a burden in our hearts in
[1:40:05] my
[1:40:06] heart is there a burden that should be
[1:40:10] there or is it just well it's a long way
[1:40:13] away doesn't really matter to
[1:40:17] me watching there unto watch the enemy
[1:40:21] moves know his
[1:40:23] tactics he wants to get inside your
[1:40:28] home he wants to lock you up and think
[1:40:31] that you're in a safe house and then
[1:40:33] he's going to burn it around
[1:40:37] you and as for
[1:40:39] me that
[1:40:41] utterance that utterance may be given
[1:40:43] unto me that I may open my mouth
[1:40:48] boldly and make known The Mystery of the
[1:40:50] Gospel
[1:40:51] for which I am an ambassador in bonds
[1:40:54] that therein I may speak boldly as I
[1:40:56] ought to
[1:40:57] speak we close if the musicians could
[1:41:03] come I'm talking about this Safe House
[1:41:06] friends and we get as I as I spoke a
[1:41:09] couple weeks ago about this simulation
[1:41:11] of
[1:41:13] Christianity and It
[1:41:15] produced a lot of questions among the
[1:41:18] people and there were a number brothers
[1:41:21] and sisters that came to me and they
[1:41:22] said listen I feel like I'm flying
[1:41:25] around in a video game and this whole
[1:41:27] Christianity thing isn't real I need
[1:41:29] something
[1:41:31] real and the question always came how do
[1:41:33] I get
[1:41:35] it what do I need to do to get that real
[1:41:40] thing to receive that new birth what do
[1:41:43] I have to
[1:41:45] get and the answer is it has to be the
[1:41:49] number one most important thing in your
[1:41:52] life it's more important than your job
[1:41:56] it's more important than than your
[1:41:58] friends it's more important that than
[1:42:00] your social status everything must go
[1:42:03] back to Lord I have to have that new
[1:42:06] birth I have to be filled with your
[1:42:08] spirit and if you don't care if it's not
[1:42:12] that important then you're not going to
[1:42:14] get
[1:42:16] it it has to be number one in our lives
[1:42:20] and instead we think just because we're
[1:42:22] in this fortified house like these Jews
[1:42:25] were that we're safe because the alarm
[1:42:29] went
[1:42:30] off well the alarm went off and it
[1:42:34] didn't come like they thought it was
[1:42:35] going to come the attack didn't come
[1:42:38] from up here the attack came from down
[1:42:41] here totally
[1:42:44] unexpected and that's where many of us
[1:42:46] are we think that we're in this safe
[1:42:48] house because oh we have a message or we
[1:42:51] have a a good church or we have any of
[1:42:55] this and it's it's a safe house it is
[1:42:58] safe there's nothing wrong with it but
[1:43:00] there is
[1:43:01] more because the enemy can come from a
[1:43:04] different
[1:43:06] angle and you look at the
[1:43:10] gospel the Bible says in Ezekiel that
[1:43:13] only those that sigh and cry for the
[1:43:16] sins of the city would be saved
[1:43:21] how
[1:43:23] many how many of us are in that place or
[1:43:27] are we just sitting in a safe house
[1:43:29] saying I'm good I'm
[1:43:32] good I got a message I got a church I
[1:43:36] live a good
[1:43:37] life it's a safe house but don't burn in
[1:43:42] that safe
[1:43:43] house because the enemy is coming he's
[1:43:46] coming for each of
[1:43:48] us and if it's not the most most
[1:43:50] important thing in our
[1:43:53] lives that we have that relationship
[1:43:56] with Christ I ask you to please
[1:43:59] re-evaluate your
[1:44:02] relationship do you know
[1:44:05] him is he
[1:44:09] real is it the most important thing in
[1:44:12] your life Lord I will give
[1:44:15] everything whatever it is Lord I'll give
[1:44:18] it and sometimes you have to draw your
[1:44:21] sword remember when he tried to come
[1:44:23] into my
[1:44:26] house I drew that sword and I had to to
[1:44:32] protect my
[1:44:34] family because Satan was on his way he
[1:44:36] was coming in not past me I'd rather
[1:44:40] die there's that man with his gun and
[1:44:43] he's got a door between him and death
[1:44:46] between his family and
[1:44:49] death and he protected them the old man
[1:44:53] going to protect his grandkids with a
[1:44:57] pistol against automatic weapons and he
[1:45:00] was successful because God was with him
[1:45:04] and it's the same with us the
[1:45:07] prayer of a righteous man the Bible says
[1:45:10] availeth
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:13] much don't think because you are in a
[1:45:18] safe house don't think
[1:45:25] because you don't see sin around you
[1:45:29] don't think it's not
[1:45:30] coming don't think it's not already
[1:45:33] there there is something
[1:45:36] more the enemy comes in like a
[1:45:39] flood comes in everywhere Isaiah said
[1:45:43] but God will raise up a standard against
[1:45:45] him that standard today is the Holy
[1:45:49] Ghost it's Jesus Jesus Christ Living in
[1:45:53] the
[1:45:55] individual and the rage that happens and
[1:45:58] what we're seeing overseas right now
[1:46:00] we're we're we're seeing maybe a change
[1:46:03] remember this is the worst
[1:46:07] day last Saturday was the worst day in
[1:46:12] Israel's history yes since back to
[1:46:16] 1948 it was the worst day of that
[1:46:19] country
[1:46:21] more people lost their lives in that one
[1:46:24] day than any other day in all of these
[1:46:26] Wars one
[1:46:28] day and it came in through a a sneak
[1:46:31] attack when everything was going on just
[1:46:34] good everything's
[1:46:36] fine and as our as the Apostle Paul says
[1:46:40] here he says our battle is not with
[1:46:43] flesh and
[1:46:45] blood our b battle is a spiritual
[1:46:48] battle and I encourage you you friends
[1:46:51] it is the most important thing in the
[1:46:53] world don't be caught up in the safe
[1:46:56] house as I was talking about the
[1:46:57] simulation of Christianity and flying
[1:46:59] around in a in a jet
[1:47:01] simulator just because you're flying and
[1:47:03] just because you have all the cockpit
[1:47:05] and everything going doesn't mean you
[1:47:08] are a Christian you may look like a
[1:47:11] Christian act like a Christian talk like
[1:47:13] a Christian but un until you receive
[1:47:16] that new birth that the Lord Jesus
[1:47:18] talked about you are not there you're
[1:47:21] just in a safe
[1:47:25] house don't forget the word not only is
[1:47:29] defensive but it's also
[1:47:33] offensive let's all
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:38] stand I felt in my
[1:47:42] heart to cancel service tonight I want I
[1:47:47] want you to spend time with your
[1:47:49] families
[1:47:51] talk to each
[1:47:53] other be a blessing to each other talk
[1:47:55] about what's going on in the
[1:47:58] world love one another encourage one
[1:48:01] another to know Jesus Christ we may be
[1:48:05] in this safe house but ask yourself do I
[1:48:09] really know what the blood of Christ is
[1:48:11] about do I understand
[1:48:14] it or is I am I just going along like
[1:48:19] I've been warned not to
[1:48:22] do let's bow our
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:30] [Music]
[1:48:33] heads can't get over that text that
[1:48:36] David sent
[1:48:39] me the passion that he
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:44] had as I look across our
[1:48:49] audience
[1:48:52] how many people here are being attacked
[1:48:54] and may not even know
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:49:05] it Lord
[1:49:09] God pray that your hand would be
[1:49:12] upon all those overseas father all those
[1:49:15] in
[1:49:18] Israel father have mercy on the
[1:49:22] innocent and father we pray
[1:49:26] that peace would
[1:49:29] rain we know that it's one day it's not
[1:49:32] going to rain and one day that that
[1:49:35] there will be a war and all guns will be
[1:49:37] pointed at
[1:49:41] Israel Lord we ask that you would stay
[1:49:43] your
[1:49:45] wrath so that we might go and witness
[1:49:48] and bring up others to
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:54] Christ father forgive us of our
[1:49:57] weaknesses
[1:49:58] and thinking maybe more highly of
[1:50:01] ourselves than we should
[1:50:04] think pray father that your will would
[1:50:08] be
[1:50:10] done and that we would be in your
[1:50:12] will and that we would truly have that
[1:50:17] sword which is the word of God
[1:50:21] may it be so
[1:50:24] Lord we love you we thank
[1:50:28] you father I pray for each person that's
[1:50:32] here you knew all of us you knew who
[1:50:34] would walk in these

[1:50:43] that for all who have come
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:49] today
[1:50:51] that the spirit of God would deal with
[1:50:53] each
[1:50:55] one father that your
[1:50:57] hand would be upon
[1:51:01] them Lord that that your spirit would
[1:51:05] speak to them not not a church father
[1:51:08] but but greater than a church God
[1:51:11] himself speaking to the individual may
[1:51:14] it be so Lord may we all know
[1:51:18] you better and understand you better
[1:51:23] Lord and we'll do our best father in
[1:51:27] Jesus Christ's name we
[1:51:29] pray

[1:55:48] thee near
[1:55:51] to
[1:55:53] thee brothers and
[1:55:55] [Music]
[1:55:56] sisters there is coming a
[1:55:58] [Music]
[1:56:01] time when this Life as we know it is
[1:56:05] going to come to an
[1:56:06] end there's coming a time when these
[1:56:10] prophecies from all the prophets are
[1:56:12] going to come to
[1:56:15] pass it's going to happen and my burden
[1:56:20] is to see all of you brothers and
[1:56:23] sisters don't think that you are
[1:56:27] safe just
[1:56:29] because you built this shelter around
[1:56:35] you that's good and you
[1:56:38] should but there is a walk with Christ
[1:56:43] that we all need to have and that walk
[1:56:46] with Christ is not a church it's not a
[1:56:50] message it's not anything
[1:56:53] other
[1:56:55] than the Holy Spirit dwelling in human
[1:56:58] fa in human flesh and that's you and me
[1:57:01] I pray that this church WIll point you
[1:57:03] that I know the message of the hour
[1:57:06] point you to
[1:57:07] that but make sure you don't
[1:57:10] stop keep
[1:57:12] moving understand God learn more about
[1:57:15] him get into this book don't just go go
[1:57:19] home into your safe house put your feet
[1:57:22] up and watch all of this stuff happening
[1:57:25] around you get in the fight get in the
[1:57:29] battle if an old man can go and fight
[1:57:33] for his people all of us can too and we
[1:57:37] fight as the Apostle Paul said not with
[1:57:39] flesh and blood amen but with our
[1:57:41] prayers amen with our witness with our
[1:57:46] testimony laying hands on the sick and
[1:57:49] them recovering yes amen leading souls
[1:57:51] to Jesus Christ through

[1:58:08] to you and happen to anybody else as
