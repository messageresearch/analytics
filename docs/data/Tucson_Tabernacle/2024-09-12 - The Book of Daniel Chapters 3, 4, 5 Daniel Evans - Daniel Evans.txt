Brothers welcome all the way back and there back there is is Justin called Johnny welcome good to see you again there's and brother Daniel and your wife God bless you welcome we appreciate all of our visitors we appreciate the word of God the Bible I want to get right into the Book of Daniel we have three chapters to cover tonight we have um for those visitors we on Wednesday night it's a Bible study we've been going through every book of the Bible I wanted to take some time to dig into this Book of Daniel it's just so interesting it's got so much just meat there so instead of taking one service for the Book of Daniel we're going to take a number of services last week we had chapters one and two introduction to Daniel and uh his his first vision and then we had a um introduction to this man Nebuchadnezzar we we met him in the book of Jeremiah and uh he was a this hot-tempered mean-spirited uh incredibly um uh Adept at War and uh he was he was just he was this very very powerful King and actually at this time he's pretty much ruling the entire en world this man Nebuchadnezzar Daniel interprets tells him his dream and interprets his dream for him Nebuchadnezzar was basically in awe of this man Daniel how can you tell someone not just interpret their dream any of us can take a stab at that but how can you tell someone their dream without even knowing it and that's what this man Daniel did to the King Nebuchadnezzar so Nebuchadnezzar was taken back um by Daniel and his abilities we go from Daniel chapter 2 and then in Daniel chapter three we see what I believe is the result of Daniel showing these great powers of God to this man Nebuchadnezzar and let's go ahead and let's just dig right in to chapter 3 and we'll start with verse one so after this had happened Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and its bread there thereof six cubits and he set up in the plane in the plain of dura in the province of Babylon now when we measure a cubit a cubit back in um the oldtime days a cubit is the measurement from your elbow to the end of your fingers there it's about about a foot and a half about 18 inches so when we talk about cubits we're talking about a foot and a half then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rules of the province to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up then the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the province provinces were gathered together you know Daniel has a style of writing and he repeats himself a lot he wants to make sure that we are getting the point and all these people that are here we gathered together unto the dedication of image that Nebuchadnezzar had the king had set up and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then a Herald cried aloud to you it is commanded oh people Nations and languages that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet the flute the harp the sackit the sultry the duler and all kinds of music that you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up and whosoever fth not down and and worships shall the same hour be cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace so the king makes this decree and he basically says anyone who doesn't follow this decree you're going to be thrown into this fiery furnace and I'll tell you what I think the fiery furnace is here in a little bit but let's so what happens is the Jew remember they were taken captive out of out of Jerusalem out of Judah they were brought to Babylon do you remember how many how many invasions there were and how many captivities how many times they they invaded and took captives three times right Daniel was taking dur taken during which time first time so he was brought over now we have this population of Jews that are here in Babylon and and Nebuchadnezzar wanted them to assimilate into society so what he did he even changed their names to the common Babylonian names he told them he wanted them to eat this type of food he wanted them to be like everybody else in Babylon which as I said last time is exactly what the world wants us to do today they want you to not say anything just assimilate just be like everybody else have the same lashes have the same have have the same Facebook page have the same Instagram page have the same Snapchat you look like everybody else and if you look today they all look the same and it's because they all paint up the same everybody looks the same and that's what's the world going on today is they want us to assimilate so what happens is these tattlers come back to the king and say Hey listen these Jews remember these ones that came out of that we brought out of Jerusalem and brought them here they're not doing what you're saying King they're not falling down every time we hear the trumpets blowing all this stuff and all the music playing they're not falling down and worshiping this image that you sat set up remember this King has a bad temper verse number 12 says this these are the tattlers there are certain Jews whom thou has set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach meach and Abednego these men oh King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou Hast set up so he sets up this golden image and remember we see in number of cubits we see how big the thing is the thing's really big but what is this image of most Scholars most historians think that it is an image of the king himself Nebuchadnezzar which would make sense because the kings are generally narcissists they're generally people that love themselves they're generally people that want to leave a legacy so why not set up an image to yourself but it doesn't quite make sense that look at the placement of this image in the Bible it happened right after Nebuchadnezzar actually fell down and worshiped Daniel so what is this image brother the random said one time he said let's take the Hebrew children because they stood and would not tolerate with image worship they refused to bow down to an image that the king of the nation had made it was made after a holy man too the image of Daniel not only that but belto Shazer which the king named Daniel later on we are going to read that it is the name after Nebuchadnezzar's God and not only that but you'll notice that everybody has to fall down and the ones that don't are only three people how come Daniel was not with these three if you make up an image to a god it doesn't make sense that you worship your own image So Daniel would have been exempt from worshiping this big statue if this was of Daniel and further with all these things in mind we we look at Nebuchadnezzar and remember Nebuchadnezzar had many gods he didn't didn't just have one God he was what's called an idolator he had many gods the Jews have one God Nebuchadnezzar it's no big deal to just make up another God why not make it of Daniel so if you look at if you line all of these things up really I believe that that image must have been of the Prophet Daniel it makes sense then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury we've seen that before in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach meach and abedo commanded to bring Shadrach mhach and abedo and they brought these men before God so these are the three men that would not fall down and worship this image Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh Shadrach me and abedo do not ye serve my gods no worship the golden image which I have set up if now if ye be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet the flute the harp the sackit the Salt Tree and the duler and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made you do well but if you do but if you worship not you shall be cast the same out power into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is that God who is that who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hand so he's giving them another chance which is strange for Nebuchadnezzar he hasn't given any anybody else any other chances but I think he knew these these these young men and he knew that they were friends with Daniel so he's giving them another chance very kind of him you can either Fall Down and Worship ship or I'll burn you to death I'm going to give you another chance Shadrach mhach and Abednego answered and said the said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter that's old English say the the the modern translation Shadrach mhak abedo in the English Standard Version answered and said unto the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we have no need to answer you in this matter new King James says the same thing NIV says King Nebuchadnezzar we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand oh King but if not I love this part he's they say our God can deliver us out of this fiery furnace but if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou Hast set up so it doesn't matter Our God's able to deliver us but even if he doesn't that's up to him he's a sovereign God even if he does not deliver us we're not going to do it we are not going to bow down to your Idols then can't guess what happens next then Nebuchadnezzar was full of Fury and the form of his VIs was changed against Shadrach Meshach and abedo so he was given him a chance and now you see The Temper rise up in him therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was want to be heated so what is this fiery furnace let's just think about what this was it could have been a furnace that they used to make charcoal out of so you burn this wood and then and then you take it and and you can use it for for fuel or whatever but it was probably because this is well into the Iron Age now it was probably some sort of a furnace used for either melting metals or smelting or into into a metal so basically for our intents and purposes it was something used to melt metal it was very hot just normally so that's the Gospel According to Daniel that's what that's what I think that this fiery furnace was is something used to melt metal so just its regular temperature was super hot more than enough to kill someone and enough to probably melt metal could have been a smelter it could have been some sort of a large furnace as I said to melt metal but but it was it was something that was very hot so what the king says is in his anger it was plenty hot enough before but in his anger make it seven times worse really melt these guys and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach mhach and abedo and to cast them into the fiery furnace then these men were Bound in their coats their hosen their hats and other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was Ur urgent the furnace was exceeding hot the Flames of the F fire slew the men that took up Shadrach mhach and abedo so it must have been a place to put the fuel into the fire to put the charcoal or to put whatever they were burning to get it hot enough to melt the metals it it must have been something that they had to walk up to and then put the fuel in so they brought these young men up to the place to put them into the fire and then it got it was so hot that something happened to where the men that were holding Shadrach Meshach and Abed ago were burned up now let's come back to the Natural and we'll do the Gospel According to Daniel again it could have been that there was something covering the top to keep the the heat inside and when they pulled it off it was something called like a backdraft where the oxygen comes in and then the fire is smoldering and when it gets that oxygen it rushes out and grabs someone sister L you're shaking your head you have firefighter experience you know what that is where that oxygen comes in and it now it reaches out it's very dangerous for firefighters it could have been that or it could have been something that's called a flashover and what a flash over here is it says it is the near simultaneous ignition of most of the directly exposed combustible material material in an enclosed area when certain organic materials are heated that's wood coal any anything that's basically burnable that has Organics in it that any fuel that the Babylonians will put into that F furnace they undergo this quick decomposition and release flammable gases so it could have also been this so basically it's you have it's smoldering smoldering it reaches this temperature and then boom it goes out whatever it was whether it was this type of explosion or that type of explosion something came up and scorched the soldiers holding these Hebrews caused the Hebrews to fall into the furnace they were bound it wouldn't matter if they were bound with handcuffs or iron shackles or whatever they would have melted right off these men these strong men some of his best men Nebuchadnezzar's best men this fire came up and cooked them and here goes the Hebrew children into the fiery furnace and these three men Shadrach mhach and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished and he rose up in haste and he spake and said unto his counselors so he's looking and he's looking down down into this now The Flash probably went back down and now he's able to look into this this vat or whatever it was that's heated seven times hotter and he looks down there and he says hey I thought we weren't there three guys that were cast into the fiery furnace and he looks Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished he rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the and said unto the king true king he answered and said lo I see four men loose not bound anymore walking in the midst walking around in the midst of the fire seven times hotter than it takes to melt metal walking around in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth so there's Shadrach mhach and abedo walking around in their hats and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God other translations says like a Son of God I don't believe they're right like the Son of God what could that have been brother Jeremy maybe a theop amen a a previous manifestation of the Son of God Jesus Christ in that burning fiery furnace how incredible there's Jesus and there's those three men that was probably the safest place on Earth right there right in the midst of that fiery furnace that there with there with Jesus Christ Christ then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said Shadrach mhach and abedo you Servants of the most high God come forth come hither and Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came forth of the midst of the fiery furnace came forth from the midst of the fiery furnace of the midst and then the princes and governors and captains and the Kings and counselors being gathered together saw these men whose bodies the fire had no power nor was a hair of their head singed neither were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had even passed on them then Nebuchadnezzar remember his dream he was probably like whoa it's happening again with these young men then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said bless blessed be the god of Shadrach meach and Abednego who has sent his Angel and delivered his servants that trusted him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God so Nebuchadnezzar in all his of e evilness and all of his temper and everything bad about that man sometimes we see some goodness in him sometimes we see see some Revelation for heaven's sakes he he saw and realized that that Fourth Man in the fire right was the Lord Jesus brother Lyall you stole my thunder about who it was in there with your song but it was it was a previous manifestation of the Son of God Nebuchadnezzar spake let me read it again Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach in a bigo who have set his Angel and delivered his servants that trusted him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God therefore I make a decree Here We Go Again The King's going to make another decree he hasn't learned that his decrees are just not that successful that every people nation and language would speak anything amiss against the god of Shadrach Meshach and abedo shall be cut in pieces and the their houses shall be made a dungill because there is no other God that can Del deliver after this sort then the king promoted Shadrach Meshach and abedo in the province of Babylon chapter 4 is a unique chapter in all the Bible it's does do we know what race of people wrote this Bible the Jews from Genesis written by Moses all the way to Revelation written down by who John who was a Jew we have Jews from the beginning all the way to the end Moses who was from the tribe of Levi where the Jewish um really race starts with Jacob and his 12 sons as we've gone through Moses writes from uh from Genesis down and then we have other Jews Ezra and Nehemiah and those that that take up the mantle and begin and write all the way down till now in Daniel and we see something different in Daniel chapter 4 that's never happened in the Bible and it never happens again where chapter 4 is written by a gentile King not even a Jew it's written by King Nebuchadnezzar so he himself gets to have his own chapter in the Bible Daniel chapter 4 Nebuchadnezzar the King this is him writing he writes this letter and he says Nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people Nations and languages that dwell in all the Earth peace be multiplied unto you I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that God hath wrought toward me how great are his signs and how Mighty are his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and his Dominion is from generation to gen generation so we see that this man Nebuchadnezzar has experienced some Revelation in his life and it's came from Daniel and these three Hebrew CH these three Hebrew children so now he knows that Daniel can interpret dreams he he knows that Daniel is this Gifted Man and he says I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house and flourishing in my Palace and I saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me therefore made I a decree to the beginning and all the wise men of Babylon before me that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream sounds familiar doesn't it then came in The Magicians and the astrologers and the calans and the soothsayers and I told the dream before them this is different than the first time first time Daniel told him the dream now Nebuchadnezzar he brings in all of his wise men and he tells them this dream that he has but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof but at the last Daniel came in before me whose name was built to shazar according to the name of my God and whom and in whom the spirit of the Holy gods and before him I told the dream saying oh belshazzar oh Daniel Master Of The Magicians do you remember who these wise men are these magicians these are the ancestors to the wise men that came and gave the gifts to the baby Jesus many years later oh belshazzar Master Of The Magicians because I know that the spirit of the Holy Gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen and the interpretation thereof thus were the visions of mine head in my bed and I saw and behold a tree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was great the tree grew and was strong long and the height thereof reached into the Heaven and the sight thereof to the end of the Earth the leaves thereof were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all was food for all and the beasts of the field had Shadow under it and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof and all the flesh was fed of it so this great tree the the animals in the field would come under it and enjoy its shade and the the birds would would make their nest in it it was just this great tree and I saw in the vision of my head my bed and behold a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven and he cried aloud remember this is his dream and he cried aloud loud and said said thus Hue down the tree cut down the tree and cut off its branches shake off his leaves and Scatter his fruit let the Beast get away from under it and the fowls from his branches nevertheless leave the stump of its of his roots in the earth even with a band of iron and Brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the de of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts in the in the grass of the Earth let his heart be changed from a man's and let a BEAST's heart be given unto him and let seven times pass over him this matter is by the decree of the Watchers and de and the demand by the word of the Holy ones to the intent that in the LI in the living may know that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and Seth up over the base the bases of men this dream I Nebuchadnezzar have seen now thou oh belshazzar declare the interpretation thereof for as much as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation but you are able for the spirit of the Holy Gods is in thee now Daniel is going to give the interpretation of the dream like he did before but this time Daniel's a bit hesitant to tell the king and you're gonna see why remember Nebuchadnezzar's temper before the interpretation was good now listen to this then Daniel whose name was belto shazar was astonished for one hour that means perplexed he was dismayed and his thoughts troubled him the king spake and said belto shazar let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee Bazar answered and said my Lord the dream be to them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies so he's saying King he's saying this ain't going to work out well for you this dream a tree the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached unto the Heaven and the sight thereof to all the Earth so it was something that was looking out throughout the whole earth king over the Earth and whereas the king I'm sorry ver number 22 verse number 20 the tree which thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached to the Heaven and the sight thereof to all the Earth whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and it was meat for all food for all under which all the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation it is thou oh King this tree is you Thou Art grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown and reaches unto heaven and thy Dominion to the end of the Earth remember last week we talked about the dream that he saw in the head of gold that was Nebuchadnezzar first Dream and that head of gold it was the greatest of them all and that was Nebuchadnezzar whereas and whereas the king saw a watcher a holy one coming down from heaven and saying heue the tree down and destroy it yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of iron and brass and tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the de of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts of the field seven times pass over him so he's he's recounting the dream that the that the king had this is the interpretation oh King and this is the decree of the most high which has come up upon my Lord the king here's what this part of this of your dream means that they shall Drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with the Dew of heaven and seven times seven periods of time shall pass over thee till thou know that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and giveth it to whosoever he will so Nebuchadnezzar he's saying you're going to learn that God is greater than you are and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree of the tree roots thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee and after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule so remember job and he saw that tree that was cut down and then he saw that when water hit the tree that it started to sprout and started to grow again so he's saying here that you're going to be like that tree you're going to get cut down but there's still hope here Nebuchadnezzar whereof oh King wherefore O King let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy sin sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by showing Mercy to the poor if it be if it may be a lengthening of thy Tranquility do you remember the story of Elijah the prophet when he prophesied to Ahab and said you are going to the dogs are going to lick your blood what Happ what Ahab did Ahab repented and sat an ases and it stayed God's Wrath for a while it eventually came true Ahab died in battle and when they washed off the The Chariot that he was in the dogs came and they licked the blood off of the ground but but Ahab repented and it stayed the wrath of God and here's what the prophet is Danel Daniel is saying to this King he's saying listen King he said if you can just be kind give to the poor be humble then God's Wrath will be stayed remember this is Nebuchadnezzar writing and all this came upon the King Nebuchadnezzar you know I enjoy when I hear a testimony probably my favorite testimonies to hear is when someone says here's what I did wrong here's how I suffered for doing wrong and here is how God brought me out and how God blessed me I love those testimonies if the Lord's willing this Sunday morning we hear a a testimony of that very thing how someone did wrong they admitted it and then they found the joy of God even though they have suffered for what they did wrong that would be this Sunday morning at the end of 12 months he walked in the Palace of the kingdom of Babylon so later on maybe forgot about this interpretation from Daniel this warning for from Daniel and the King spake and said is not this great Babylon that I have built for the house of the Kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my Majesty remember when Herod in the book of Acts we go way back to the book of Acts remember when Herod when he gave that incredible speech in front of the people and they said oh it's like God speaking and Herod did not give credit to God and he dropped down dead right there and the Bible says that he was eaten of worms and here this Nebuchadnezzar is doing the best he's looking at he says look at what I did this is my kingdom I have created this and it was the greatest Kingdom on Earth had giant walls around it these beautiful streets it was a beautiful prosperous nation and here is Nebuchadnezzar looking out and say look what I did and while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from Heaven saying oh King Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall Drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field remember his dream in Daniel's interpretation and thy and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen seven times seven periods of time shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will God's in charge Nebuchadnezzar I don't care who you think you are he is the king God is the king and you may not believe you may not do anything but you are still subject to him the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men he did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the Dew of Heaven till his hairs were grown out like eagle feathers and his nails grew out like Bird's Claws and at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar so he would he would be out he'd eat grass like the cows he was so crazy he lost his mind that his nails grew out really long his hair was really long and the Dew that would fall because he'd sleep out in the fields would fall upon his back and he'd wake up wet and at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto heaven and my understanding returned to me and I bless the most high and I praised and honored him that liveth forever whose Dominion is an everlasting Dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation he honored him one person he didn't honor them those different gods he honored him singular he honored god Jehovah not the plurality of gods but one God and all the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my Kingdom Mine honor and brightness returned unto me and my counselors and my lords sought unto me and I was established in My Kingdom an excellent Majesty was added to me so when you make a mistake as this King what a horrible mistake went crazy for probably seven years or ever long it was and yet he repented and God restored it so brothers and sisters when we make a mistake don't dwell on it repent give God the glory and he might just restore things even better than they were before and here's Nebuchadnezzar saying he even blessed me higher than before now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the king of Heaven and all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in Pride he is able to AB base he knows because he's been there what a testimony that's why I love those testimonies here's what I did wrong here's how I suffered for it and here's Nebuchadnezzar saying I was the king I was everything yet in my pride God brought me down to the lowest of the low now we go to chapter 6 and we assume that Nebuchadnezzar checks out he's um I assume he died some time past and then his son Bazar takes over I want to tell I want to give a testimony first before we get into uh Daniel chapter 5 on uh June the 8th 1961 my mom my dad my mom's family my dad's family were in Bram Tabernacle in Jefferson Mo Indiana and the sermon went forth the sermon title was Revelation 4 part three towards the end of the service after the the sermon was over it came time to pray for the sick and if you listen to the sermon and it's recorded You Hear the People start to shout and start to scream and even the tape recorder stopped for a moment just just maybe for a moment and and what had happened my mom was there and I've heard my mom tell me tell me the story many times I called my aunt Jacqueline today and I Saidi just want to make sure I'm right in this story that I told my Aunt Jacqueline was there my dad was there my both of my grandpas both sides of my family all of them were there what had happened they were sitting in church and on the wall there came a light and the people saw it the light started to move my dad said he was my dad was was really close to it he said the light was like alive it was moving like this and they saw it on the wall and it began to move up and you can listen and the people start shouting and the fear comes in the in the audience brother Brandon was in the Pulpit he says wait wait he says basically don't fear that it starts moving up and as it got to the ceiling it went into the ceiling didn't reflect on top of the ceiling went into the ceiling and disappeared people were shouting there was a great fear that came upon the audience I talked to my aunt Jacqueline today she said she told the same stories my dad told my mom told everybody it was a it was something that was moving there something Supernatural my grandfather wheeler who was a deacon in the church came back I don't know if it was the next day or a couple days later he and I think it was brother Hickerson another Deacon in the church they they went and they tried to duplicate the light on the on the on the wall and they couldn't do it they even took a flashlight and shined it on the wall and tried to get it to go into the wall and they couldn't it it always reflect reflected off the ceiling there was no no way to duplicate the light it was a supernatural experience that had happened right there witnessed by hundreds of people and the reason I'm telling it is something similar happens right here in this Daniel chapter 5 Bel Shazer is Daniel the king's num the King's son is name Bazar similar names similar spellings so we're going to see right now what happens when you don't respect God and you disrespect the things of God chapter 5 verse one Bazar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his Lords and drank wine before the thousands so he's having this big drunken party and when you drink and you get drunk you do things that you would not normally do but let me tell you no matter how drunk you are and no matter no matter what you're taking to make you do this you are still responsible for what you do even if you may be out of your mind with some other chemical or alcohol I mean you can go out and you get in the car you can drink to where you can't you you don't know what you're doing you can go out and kill somebody you're going to go to jail for murder but I didn't know what I was doing you but you knew when you started drinking and here this King's son who is now King he knew better Bazar whilst he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the Temple which was in Jerusalem that the king and his princes his wives and his concubines might drink therein so all of this party going on and laughing and and doing everything hey go get the the uh the vessels that you brought out of the temple God's Temple Jehovah's temple in Jerusalem let's use those haha that'll be fun let's make fun of these Jews so they bring these sacred vessels into their part party fill them with wine start laughing drinking doing their thing and as they were partying making fun of this Jehovah God there came a writing on the wall they all saw it fear swept through everyone that was there the king Bazar he looks at it and he was so afraid that his knees were knocking together and he he slumped over and he saw and there's there was this thing written across he didn't know what it mean meant scared to death brings in his people says hey can you interpret what this said nobody can interpret it so his his wife tells him she's like hey hey Bazar she says uh do you remember your dad remember the letter he wrote remember your dad talking about this man Daniel that could interpret dreams that had that was that was that that had this ability this gift do you remember that man and he said yeah why don't you call him Daniel's an old man by right now skip to verse 17 so he brings Daniel in Daniel answered and said before the king so he offers to Daniel he says if you come in he says I'm going to give you all of these gifts gold and all this and he says I'm going to make you the third ruler in the entire Kingdom he says you're going to be the number number three men Rich beyond measure in this great city of Babylon you're going to be it Daniel then Daniel answered and said before the king let thy gifts be to yourself and give thy rewards to another yet I will read the writing unto the king and make known to him the interpretation oh Thou King most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom in majesty and glory and honor and for the Majesty that he gave him all the people Nations and languages trembled and feared before him whom he would he would whom he would slew whom he whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive and whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down but when his heart was lifted stood up and his mind hardened in Pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him and as he was driven from the sons of men remember the story I just told going out into the field thinking he was a cow and as he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the Beast and his dwelling was with the wild beast they fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the Dew of Heaven till he knew that the most high God ruled in the Kingdom of men and that he appointed over it whomsoever he will and thou his son oh Bazar hasth not humbled thine heart though thou knewest all this you read his letter you're his son you know what happened to him you saw your dad's mind mind fail you knew better I love it I love it when these prophets do stuff like this he's standing before the king remember when Ahab when Elijah did it to Ahab say not even due or rain or fall until I call for it boldness of a prophet where are we at first number 23 but H has lifted up thyself against the Lord of Heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy Lords and thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine with them and thou has praised the gods of silver and gold and brass and iron and wood and stone which see not nor hear they dumb Idols there's not alive nor no and the god in whose hand thy breath is and whose are thy way or are all thy ways hast thou not glorified the prophet is saying he says there is one true God and I don't care who you are as I said before you may be a sinner whatever you are you still answer to God you may not say that you do you may say you're an atheist you might say that there's no God you're still subject to God no matter what you say he's saying that even you Bel shazar the breath that you are breathing comes from God then was the part of the hand sent from him God's hand came down and this is the writing that was written again the pro prophetic gift of Daniel telling him what happened and and this is the writing that was written mean mean te a Parson this is the interpretation of the thing meaning God hath numbered thy kingdom numbered numbered God has numbered thy kingdom and finished it he's numbered the days of your Reign and they have come to an end Bazar tle Thou Art weighed in the balances and found wanting you have been weigh on the scale of righteousness and you have been found deficient perz thy kingdom is divided and given to the mes and Persians then commanded Bazar and they clothed Daniel with scarlet and put a chain around his neck and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the Kingdom as this is going on the very same night as the as the handwriting was on the wall and as he got Daniel and Daniel's interpreting this what he didn't know they had no idea that this Kingdom called the mes there was a river that ran into the city of Babylon they were sneaking in maybe waiting under the walls of Babylon sneaking into the city as they were doing their they they're drinking and partying and all this and making fun of all the Jews and here comes this invading Army sneaking under the cover of Nightfall surrounding infiltrating this city Daniel is giving the interpretation in that night was Bel AR the king of the caldian Slade slain and dasas the median took the kingdom being about three score and two years old and thus there is the end of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar and his son Bazar then we close with that and the musicians can come the end there of Daniel chapter 5 very scary Time Imagine put yourself in this king's this king's place and he's partying he's he's doing all this and how many times have we just gotten slack fooled around said things that we shouldn't done things that we we we shouldn't have done and here this this King loses the entire Kingdom not knowing that as he is sinning as he's doing all this here comes the invad invading Army and destroys his kingdom Daniels Daniel chapter 3 4 and five I know it's kind of scary it's true it's um really amazing Stories brother the Josiah fourth Fourth Man in the [Music] fire the moment now has come there's nothing to be done my accusers stand before me end there's nowhere left to run so it ends this way there's nothing more to say I will pay the price give my life for the choice that I have made oh but suddenly what is this I see as I'm cast Into the Fire there is one who stands by me I saw the Fourth Man between the flames and I when there was no hope at all he saved me just in time holding back the forces pressed on every side I am saved by the Fourth Man in the fire now the test is p but it was not the last my accusers seek to find me weak and constantly attack searching to and fro constantly they go in my desperate hour seek to devour and strike the Fatal blow but I am not afraid and they are much dismayed for between us stands the son of man and the standard he has raised oh I saw the Fourth Man between the flames and die when there was no hope at all he Sav me just in time holding back the forces pressed on every side I am saved by the Fourth Man in the fire I am saved by the Fourth Man in in the fire Jesus fights Jesus fights for [Music] me in my hour of need standing at my side he's holding back the tide and when there was no hope at all save me just in [Music] time I saw the Fourth Man between the flames and I and when there was no hope at all he saved me just in time holding back the forces I'm saved by the Fourth Man in the fire oh holding back the forces that pressed on every side I am saved by the Fourth Man in the fire I am saved by the Fourth Man in the fire [Music] [Applause] Daniel these stories I was talking about Parables on Sunday morning these are not Parables these things happened this King Nebuchadnezzar and all of his rage and all of his Fury and and all of his kingdom and all of his greatness was brought to his knees by the Mighty God and then He restored him to write Daniel chapter 4 what what an amazing thing isn't that just like God I just no matter how many times I fail how many times I do things wrong and I don't think I've done anything as wrong as Nebuchadnezzar has but he restore and he's always there for us and boy is he powerful so in summary we we see this fiery furnace these young men they were not Bow Down and Worship even though I believe and I think we all are on the same page that that was an image of the Prophet whom they followed and whom they believed but they would would Bow Down and Worship Him they said no no no no that's reserved for one that's reserved for my Creator and I love when they said oh it's just so beautiful they said our God Nebuchadnezzar we don't care how great you are we don't care what what powerful you king you are and all these men with these swords ready to take our heads off and and about to be thrown into this fiery furnace God can deliver us but even if he doesn't we're still we are not going to conform to your image of worship how beautiful in Nebuchadnezzar we see how this dream that he has how this great tree Daniel said you were that tree but he said Nebuchadnezzar if you would just humble yourself and then he forgot what Daniel said and he looked out with the pride of a king and he looked out and said look what I've built look how great I am and immediately strucking down right there Heard a Voice come from heaven and strike him down and he lost his mind lowered brother Paul lowered down to the lowest of the low and then God had mercy on him and he came back then his son took over and disrespected disrespected the things of God I said on Sunday morning certain things just don't say just be careful be careful of your your speech don't take the Lord the lord's name in vain don't disrespect him don't disrespect his Messengers don't disrespect his Bible don't make fun of it and it's so easy to do because the world makes it so light to us [Music] but God he rever this book and he reveres the things that are written therein but this this young man [Music] Bazar he sinned and that handwriting came on the [Music] wall and my mom my dad both of my grandp parents my family they saw something similar to that and how it was an unexplained Supernatural event just witnessing that God is real and he's alive in our day and then this man dasas he invades and he takes over we're going to hear more about him the kingdom went from the Babylonians now and now it's in this this dual Kingdom between Cyrus and dasas the mes and the Persians Persian being Cyrus and the me being dasas and then from the rest of the Book of Daniel they will have Rule and it's exactly as the King's dream earlier that the mes and the Persians would take over and that next as the as the image in Daniel 1 and two came down exactly the King's dream and as Daniel the Prophet interpreted it beautiful do you enjoy the Book of Daniel oh it's so interesting it's so amazing it's just to me it's man I just read and I read and I read over and I read over and I think wow this is amazing and how many
