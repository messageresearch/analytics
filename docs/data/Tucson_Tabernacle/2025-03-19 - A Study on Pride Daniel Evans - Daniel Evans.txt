[14:33] brother Lyall if you could come open the
[14:35] Service in a word of
[14:37] prayer I believe there were prayer
[14:39] requests this evening forgive me I'm a
[14:42] little bit of a mess I left them back
[14:44] there if you have a request on your
[14:47] heart the Lord sees it that's the most
[14:49] important thing you can hold it before
[14:51] him in your heart or with your
[14:53] hand brother L if you'd open up
[14:59] [Music]
[15:05] good evening God bless you it's good to
[15:08] see so many people out this evening
[15:10] Wednesday night Hearts United together
[15:13] to Worship the Lord and to hear the
[15:14] words that he's given to our pastor to
[15:17] speak to us we have a prayer request
[15:18] here from Sister Nina Vil it says please
[15:21] pray for the children of my classroom
[15:24] several of them have had coughs that are
[15:25] lingering for weeks pray that sickness
[15:28] will leave our class
[15:30] there were also requests earlier today
[15:31] for sister Ellie Troutman who's uh in
[15:34] the hospital and she's there kind of
[15:37] getting things stabilized a little bit
[15:39] they haven't found any major things
[15:40] wrong with her they're just waiting for
[15:42] her to uh become a little
[15:44] more uh not stabilized because she is
[15:48] stable but a little more alert and
[15:49] awakened so they can uh find out a bit
[15:52] more what's going on and of course our
[15:54] brother Koo was scheduled for that major
[15:56] surgery today I hav't heard any results
[15:58] on that I don't know if he's still in
[16:00] surgery or if it's
[16:04] going
[16:06] postponed it's postponed so praise the
[16:08] Lord so there's still there's still that
[16:10] chance that the Lord can step in and
[16:12] intervene and have it not be required
[16:14] and that's certainly the burden in the
[16:16] prayer that's on our heart but above all
[16:18] we want the Lord's will let's join our
[16:20] hearts together now as we approach our
[16:22] Lord in prayer Lord Jesus it's such an
[16:24] honor it's such a
[16:26] privilege it's such an opportunity and
[16:29] it's something that we love to do to
[16:30] gather together in your name with our
[16:32] brothers and sisters Lord to draw closer
[16:34] to you to draw closer to one another to
[16:37] to feel your spirit move in our midst
[16:39] Lord and and the reality of uh of of you
[16:42] Lord we were at uh at at a funeral
[16:45] service yesterday and a memorial service
[16:47] Lord for our brother Roberts Lord and
[16:50] and we just know that he's it's sounds
[16:53] almost like a platitude or something to
[16:55] say well he's in a better place and
[16:56] without pain but it's true he is in a
[16:59] better place and he is without pain and
[17:01] Lord we just cling to that promise and
[17:03] that hope and that truth that there is a
[17:05] resurrection Lord you said in the mouth
[17:07] of two or three witnesses that the major
[17:10] things would be established and you gave
[17:11] us Witnesses through the mouth of job
[17:13] through the mouth of Jesus Through the
[17:15] writings of Paul Lord we know that it's
[17:17] true we know that it's real we worship
[17:19] you and we love you this evening Lord we
[17:21] just ask that you'd anoint our pastors

[17:25] heart Lord for us and Lord that we be

[28:07] we're seated let's turn in our Bibles to
[28:10] Proverbs chapter 6 verse
[28:20] 16 Proverbs
[28:23] 616 something that we've probably all
[28:26] heard this scripture and I want to dig a
[28:29] little bit deeper into it tonight I I
[28:31] think it'll be a blessing to us it's a
[28:33] very difficult subject
[28:36] but sometimes difficult to hear but I
[28:39] believe it'll be it'll be a
[28:41] blessing Proverbs Chapter 6 ver 16 says
[28:45] this these six things do the Lord hate
[28:47] yay seven are an Abomination unto him a
[28:51] proud look a lying tongue and hands that
[28:55] shed innocent blood a heart that div us
[28:58] Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift
[29:02] and running to Mischief a false witness
[29:05] that speaketh lies and he that Seth
[29:09] Discord among the Brethren amen let's
[29:12] bow our heads our heavenly
[29:14] father Lord we come here tonight to
[29:18] learn more about you through your word
[29:21] and we pray father that as I open these
[29:23] scriptures and and read this blessed
[29:26] word that Lord Lord that the Holy Spirit
[29:29] would be The Interpreter to our hearts
[29:32] and Lord that we would leave here better
[29:34] people and we came in Jesus name amen
[29:40] amen you can be seated God bless
[29:43] everyone it's good to good as I said
[29:46] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[29:48] it's it's always good to gather good to
[29:51] gather with with people that love each
[29:54] other and uh I was very proud of our
[29:57] church
[29:58] the L mentioned um the funeral I was
[30:02] very proud that so many of us showed up
[30:04] and and I know it was a real blessing to
[30:07] the family so if you went to the funeral
[30:09] God bless you and thank thank you
[30:12] for um representing our
[30:16] church Sister Sarah Roberts and the
[30:18] Roberts
[30:19] family they uh they're going they have a
[30:22] long road in front of them now that
[30:24] dad's gone brother Dan was younger than
[30:26] me
[30:28] bread winner for the
[30:30] family and uh many many of us knew
[30:33] brother Dan and just please keep the
[30:36] family in prayer again I was I was very
[30:39] proud of our group and so many of us
[30:41] showed
[30:43] up this scripture in Proverbs is kind of
[30:48] the seven worst sins and the the seven
[30:53] really really bad ones it says these
[30:55] things the Lord hates
[30:58] and seven are Abomination to him and it
[31:01] starts with a proud look You' think it
[31:05] would start with something else start
[31:07] with murder or something like that but
[31:09] it starts with a proud look as always as
[31:13] always praying about Lord what direction
[31:16] do you want us to go in our Wednesday
[31:17] night bible study where where is the
[31:20] next subject and brother Lyall is going
[31:24] to start on David and his life we just
[31:28] got through finished with Joseph and
[31:31] I've been going through topic by topic
[31:33] and I think that this is going to be a
[31:35] little bit of a um of a series that
[31:38] we're going to do on this thing called
[31:40] pride and pride is a it's really a bad
[31:44] one and after tonight I think that I
[31:47] hope that we can understand more that
[31:49] how bad it is so as I was looking doing
[31:52] research on Pride I looked it up in the
[31:55] dictionary dictionary.com
[31:58] says this a feeling of deep pleasure or
[32:02] satisfaction derived from one's own
[32:05] achievements the achievements of those
[32:08] with whom one is closely associated or
[32:11] from the qualities or possessions that
[32:13] are widely admired well that doesn't
[32:16] seem like such a bad thing doesn't seem
[32:19] like such a
[32:21] harsh sin this sin of Pride just saying
[32:25] that that you're proud of what you've
[32:26] done
[32:28] and this pride is one of the top things
[32:35] that God
[32:36] hates Pride leads the way as far as the
[32:40] as far as sins there has never I I'll
[32:43] put it this way there has never been a
[32:45] fight between you and your spouse
[32:48] without Pride dominating that argument
[32:51] right or wrong there has never been a
[32:54] church split without Pride being the
[32:57] dominating fact Factor whether it's on
[32:59] one side or on both sides with pride it
[33:02] was Pride that prevented Cain from
[33:05] receiving the blessings of God in the
[33:07] very
[33:07] beginning it was Pride that destroyed
[33:10] Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel it
[33:12] was Pride that constantly produced
[33:15] failure in King Saul the first king of
[33:17] Israel it was Pride that caused Lucifer
[33:22] to be cast out of
[33:24] Heaven it was Pride that prevented the
[33:27] pH and the Sadducees from accepting
[33:29] Jesus
[33:30] Christ it was Pride it is pride that
[33:33] destroys
[33:35] relationships it is pride that ruins
[33:38] careers it's Pride that destroys
[33:41] churches it's Pride that prevents an
[33:45] understanding of the
[33:47] scriptures I'll say that one again it's
[33:50] Pride that prevents an understanding of
[33:53] the
[33:54] scriptures it's Pride that prevents a
[33:56] walk with God
[33:58] unfortunately it's a prideful person a
[34:01] prideful person is the most difficult
[34:05] person to reach with the
[34:08] gospels you can reach a homeless person
[34:11] you can reach somebody that's that's sin
[34:13] somebody that's committed adultery and
[34:15] and feels bad you can you can reach many
[34:18] many people with the gospels but a
[34:21] prideful person is the most difficult
[34:24] person to
[34:25] reach Pride produces a
[34:28] strong religious
[34:31] spirit that's adverse to any correction
[34:35] and it's always correcting or looking
[34:37] down on someone else that's this thing
[34:40] pride and pride prevents
[34:44] Improvement it prevents us from making
[34:46] Headway in many many things I had a I
[34:49] knew a a friend of mine that was one of
[34:53] the best athletes that I had ever seen
[34:56] in my life
[34:58] and I've been around Sports I was around
[35:00] Sports the the first half of of my life
[35:04] I mean it helped me get through college
[35:05] and and I I was I was involved with a
[35:08] lot of athletes and this guy was the
[35:13] best athlete I had ever seen he was in
[35:16] high school at the time and I was older
[35:18] so I I could see the talent that He had
[35:22] he was bigger taller than all the other
[35:25] players on the team he was F faster than
[35:29] all the other players on the team he was
[35:31] more athletic than anybody else on the
[35:34] football team he
[35:36] was
[35:37] stronger than most of the other players
[35:40] on the team this guy was like a blue
[35:43] chip recruit to
[35:46] college but yet the kid had so much
[35:49] pride that he couldn't take coaching he
[35:53] wouldn't listen to his coaches he
[35:55] wouldn't do what the coaches would tell
[35:56] him because he was his attitude was you
[35:59] can't tell me what to do so he sat the
[36:02] bench his whole High School career he
[36:04] never got to college and this was
[36:06] literally the best athlete I think I had
[36:10] ever
[36:11] seen but he didn't go anywhere because
[36:14] of Pride he couldn't take
[36:18] correction Proverbs chap 11 verse one
[36:23] says this a false balance is abomination
[36:27] to the Lord but a just weight is his
[36:31] Delight when Pride cometh then cometh
[36:36] shame but with low but with the lowly is
[36:39] wisdom English Standard Version of that
[36:42] says when pride comes then comes
[36:46] disgrace but with the humble is wisdom
[36:50] inevitably it's that prideful person
[36:52] that the the thing that they fear most
[36:54] is to be brought down and the biggest
[36:57] problem is the only one that doesn't see
[37:00] the prideful person is the actual person
[37:03] that struggles with pride so it's hard
[37:05] to get through to someone that is
[37:07] prideful it's hard to it's hard to tell
[37:09] them hey you struggle with pride because
[37:11] they can't see it by definition almost
[37:15] if they're prideful they can't take
[37:17] correction so they don't see it and you
[37:20] can see why why God hates it so
[37:24] much Proverbs this is a Bible study so
[37:26] I'm gonna continue on with many many
[37:29] scriptures and I couldn't even get as I
[37:32] was studying this and praying on this I
[37:35] couldn't even get out of the Book of
[37:37] Proverbs on the subject of Pride so
[37:40] we're just going to stay in Proverbs
[37:42] tonight continue on there Proverbs 165
[37:46] says everyone that is proud in
[37:49] heart is an Abomination to the
[37:52] Lord though hand join in hand he shall
[37:56] not be P punished
[37:58] Amplified version says this everyone who
[38:00] is proud and arrogant is in heart is
[38:03] disgusting and exceedingly offensive to
[38:06] the Lord be assured he will not go
[38:10] unpunished that trait of Pride it
[38:16] disgusts
[38:18] God you think about the most disgusting
[38:21] sin that you can think of imagine if
[38:23] there was somebody in the congregation
[38:25] that's really struggling say with
[38:27] pornography or really struggling with
[38:30] with lust or something like that and how
[38:32] we would look at that person but if
[38:34] somebody else says well you know the
[38:36] thing that I struggle with the most is
[38:38] pride he'd be like oh well that's that's
[38:39] not a big deal that's just really
[38:43] common when it's the sin of Pride that
[38:47] disgusts God more than any of
[38:50] it we looking look at it through our
[38:52] eyes and the things that disgust us it's
[38:56] wrong of course it's sin
[38:58] but God's ways are not our ways his
[39:00] thoughts are not our thoughts he sees
[39:02] this Pride as the most disgusting of it
[39:07] all and yet pride is so
[39:10] common it's everywhere you you you think
[39:13] about about how bad sin is and many
[39:19] times we don't even think of Pride as a
[39:22] sin yet I read that scripture before and
[39:25] it leads the way number one and why does
[39:30] God hate it so
[39:32] much I really believe God sees
[39:35] sin as what keeps us his
[39:39] children away from him and it keeps us
[39:43] out of
[39:44] heaven and he sees pride pride as the
[39:47] number one thing that will keep people
[39:49] out of the Heavenly Kingdom will keep
[39:52] them out of heaven and send them to hell
[39:56] it's because pride is is such a strong
[39:59] barrier for God to break through because
[40:01] there's no humility and
[40:03] pride Malachi chapter 4 we quote it so
[40:06] much we know it so
[40:10] well behold I behold the day cometh that
[40:13] shall burn as an oven and all the proud
[40:17] yeah and all that do wickedly shall be
[40:20] stubble and the day cometh that shall
[40:22] burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts
[40:25] and it shall lead them leave them
[40:26] neither root nor
[40:28] Branch he's saying all the proud first
[40:32] that's the that's the first one all the
[40:34] proud will be burned up and all that do
[40:36] wicked we just think of all the wicked
[40:39] all those Wicked people are going to be
[40:40] burned up what we forget about he said
[40:42] first
[40:44] Pride all of the
[40:46] proud and yet Pride it's so common and
[40:49] so accepted more than any other sin
[40:52] pride is more acceptable than stealing
[40:54] Pride seems to be more acceptable than
[40:57] Merc
[40:59] murder and yet this is number one in
[41:01] that Hall of shame in Proverbs that I
[41:03] said earlier the seven things that God
[41:06] hates I know as I'm saying that word
[41:09] you're probably going through many
[41:11] people's minds well gay
[41:13] pride and how that that disgusts Us and
[41:17] how how it how you see the the the the
[41:21] prades that go through and they have the
[41:23] big rainbow banners and all this and it
[41:25] says gay pride and look at the gay part
[41:28] but the gay part isn't as bad as the
[41:30] pride
[41:32] part that's the major
[41:36] sin is they want to be
[41:39] proud that's that's the big
[41:43] one and gay pride is the pride
[41:46] part remember
[41:48] in the the uh in school and and and a in
[41:53] athletics they would have the uh the
[41:55] marching band The Pride
[41:57] of Arizona or the pride of your high
[42:01] school what you're lifting up this pride
[42:05] of which they can call it something else
[42:08] it's such a it's such a normal word to
[42:10] us but it is a it's a bad
[42:13] word it's something that's going to
[42:15] destroy many many
[42:21] people again I'll read Proverbs 619 616-
[42:24] 19 it says this in six things does the
[42:26] Lord hate Y and seven are an Abomination
[42:29] unto him a proud look a lying tongue
[42:32] hands that shed innocent blood a heart
[42:34] that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet
[42:37] that be swift to running to running to
[42:39] Mischief a false witness that speaketh
[42:42] lies and he that saw his Discord among
[42:45] Brethren led the way with pride Pro
[42:48] Proverbs 13:10 says only by
[42:53] pride comes contention
[42:57] only by Pride Proverbs 13:10 only by
[43:01] pride comes contention but with the well
[43:03] advised is
[43:05] wisdom I was I'll share a little bit
[43:09] about myself and this just Daniel's a
[43:11] witness to this is just happened last
[43:13] night is Stephanie made dinner and we
[43:17] were sitting around and we prayed over
[43:21] the food and she made a great dinner was
[43:24] there was green beans there and pork
[43:26] chops and
[43:27] um couscous and bread out of the out of
[43:32] the oven it was great great meal so we
[43:36] pray over the
[43:37] food and uh Stephanie takes her knife
[43:40] and she Butters her bread and there's a
[43:43] little bit of butter left on her knife
[43:45] like maybe half and she takes it and she
[43:49] starts to butter my
[43:52] bread I was like what are you
[43:54] doing I can butter my own bread I don't
[43:57] need you to butter my
[43:58] bread and and you know she looked at me
[44:01] I was like don't don't do that Daniel
[44:02] was there
[44:04] and it was you know what it was
[44:06] something that simple it was pride in
[44:11] me like I don't need I don't need you to
[44:13] butter my bread here here's my wife was
[44:15] she worked hard on this
[44:16] meal and she she put it before me and
[44:20] and she was just wanting to put to help
[44:24] me out on this bread and here I go and I
[44:27] snap back at her because that Pride rose
[44:30] up in me and if the pride would have
[44:32] rose up in Stephanie she would have said
[44:34] well you can make your own
[44:38] dinner and but it
[44:42] didn't and as I was it really bothered
[44:45] me I apologized to her I said honey I'm
[44:46] sorry I just I don't know why I took
[44:48] that wrong I I I could butter my own
[44:51] bread and and I I should have
[44:53] appreciated you doing it and that's how
[44:56] little things in a with a spouse That's
[44:59] how little fights can get started and it
[45:02] starts with nothing but
[45:05] pride and if if she would have snapped
[45:08] back then it would have probably been an
[45:12] argument you see how Pride can sneak in
[45:15] there and I'll tell you that that
[45:20] little bickering that that that came
[45:22] from me it disgusted God Accord in to
[45:27] the
[45:28] scriptures we think oh oh it's no big
[45:30] big deal it is a big
[45:32] deal says Pride that that this disgusts
[45:36] God and it said only by pride comes
[45:40] contention so when you get in a fight
[45:42] when you when you arguing with your
[45:44] spouse or your friend or whoever it is
[45:46] it's Pride that brings it you see what a
[45:49] horrible thing this
[45:51] is and it's
[45:54] everywhere there's never been a
[45:57] divorce without
[46:00] Pride because only by pride comes
[46:06] contention we talk about it's it's
[46:11] this pride is so common with us it's
[46:15] it's just everywhere I've heard I get
[46:18] criticism sometimes about using
[46:20] translations other other than the King
[46:22] James
[46:24] Bible why
[46:28] why it's proven over and over again that
[46:32] many of these translations are more
[46:36] accurate than the king J James I could
[46:38] prefer the King James because I like the
[46:40] poetic and I like the old English it
[46:42] sounds good and I've memorized the King
[46:44] James Bible I've memorized those
[46:46] scriptures that's the ones that the kids
[46:48] have memorized that's the one I like to
[46:50] read but why would there be contention
[46:53] for the King James over the English
[46:54] Standard Version of the NIV or the new
[46:56] King James
[46:58] why
[47:01] Pride well brother brandom used the King
[47:03] James Bible Well if you listens the
[47:05] tapes instead of just relying on Pride
[47:07] you know that he
[47:10] didn't absolutely not he used the young
[47:13] translation he used the emphatic diaglot
[47:16] which is a Jehovah Witness
[47:18] publication he used that he used every
[47:22] resource that he had at his disposal to
[47:26] better
[47:27] understand the word but with the a
[47:30] certain translation if that is your
[47:32] mindset then also throw out your
[47:34] smartphone go to the library and do your
[47:37] research throw out Google don't Google
[47:39] anything there's no Wikipedia there's no
[47:41] other knowledge outside of of reading a
[47:44] book and then you're relying on who
[47:45] wrote the
[47:48] book it's Pride it is nothing short of
[47:51] Pride well we just I just do this that's
[47:55] good
[47:57] but is it pride that you do it is it
[48:00] because of
[48:01] Pride or is it because that's the best
[48:05] way the uh Proverbs chap 15 ver 25 says
[48:09] this the Lord will destroy the house of
[48:13] The Proud but he will establish the
[48:16] border of the wicked not a beautiful
[48:19] scripture it's it has more of a
[48:23] spiritual meaning than it does a literal
[48:27] meaning like he's he's talking about the
[48:30] widows and how God loves the widows and
[48:32] the widows have to be dependent on
[48:36] God and he the in the New Living
[48:40] Translation said the Lord's te the Lord
[48:42] tears Down The House of the proud but he
[48:45] protects the property property of the
[48:47] widows he maintains them border of her
[48:50] property and he doesn't allow someone
[48:52] else to take her land but he himself
[48:56] will destroy destroy that of the proud
[48:59] he loves the widows he Comforts The
[49:01] widows and he takes care of the widows
[49:04] you know why because they're dependent
[49:07] on
[49:08] him and they were especially dependent
[49:10] on on him when This Book of Proverbs was
[49:13] written there was no social
[49:14] security back then the widows were
[49:18] dependent on their husband and as the
[49:20] bread winter and when when the husband
[49:22] died they were now dependent on their
[49:24] family or they were dependent on their
[49:26] Church to take care of them and it
[49:28] showed that dependence while this man
[49:31] that builts his builts his house up on a
[49:34] up on a hill and overlooking all of his
[49:37] fields and all of his crops he is
[49:39] dependent on
[49:42] himself he is the he is the one he says
[49:44] I got all this money I have done all of
[49:46] this I can sustain myself and God hates
[49:49] that he says I'll tear it down and
[49:52] that's how our Salvation is that's how
[49:54] our lives are we should never be
[49:56] dependent on us we should be like the
[49:59] widows who they are just completely
[50:01] dependent on God to take care of them
[50:05] some of the
[50:06] most prideful
[50:09] people I've ever
[50:11] met
[50:13] are some of those who seem to be so
[50:16] humble too we have to be careful we
[50:19] don't want to be proud of our
[50:22] humility we don't want to be that to be
[50:24] a source of Pride it makes that that our
[50:27] humility makes us better than someone
[50:30] else uh when we lived in Jeffersonville
[50:32] we were around a lot of Amish
[50:34] communities and you look at the Amish
[50:36] and and they see them so humble because
[50:38] they all wear the same clothes they all
[50:40] look
[50:41] alike and they you would talk to them
[50:45] and they talk in a certain way and they
[50:46] say oh you know well basically we're
[50:48] we're nothing and and uh and you know we
[50:51] just we we don't do certain things and
[50:55] they
[50:57] when they were building my
[50:58] house I had to correct them like hey
[51:02] quit spitting your chew on my
[51:04] floor of my
[51:07] concrete and they were smoking the
[51:09] cigarettes I was like you guys are are
[51:11] you're you're taking doing all of this
[51:13] tobacco and don't you think that's wrong
[51:15] but you you have to wear the same color
[51:17] pants and
[51:18] shirt but that was a source of Pride for
[51:21] them is the way they
[51:24] looked that was that was the way that
[51:27] they are they were they were too
[51:29] prideful to be on the electrical grid
[51:31] they were too prideful to live amongst
[51:34] what they called the Gentiles which
[51:35] would be us they were too prideful to
[51:39] worship Jesus Christ and what they
[51:41] called the Gentile church too prideful
[51:44] to
[51:45] visit and yet as I said they're they're
[51:48] they're smoking cigarettes and spitting
[51:49] Tobacco on my
[51:51] floor they were too good to fellowship
[51:55] with what they see they deemed as
[51:57] beneath
[51:59] them the
[52:01] clothes that I wore were too worldly for
[52:04] them the clothes of my wife wore were
[52:05] too worldly for them the fact that I had
[52:08] electricity in my house made them better
[52:10] than me the fact that I didn't have a
[52:13] beard made them better than me they
[52:16] would never outwardly say it but they
[52:18] would always they they were always
[52:21] looking at that and and you would say
[52:25] well you know they're really sweet but
[52:26] let one of their children or one of
[52:29] their
[52:31] Community go outside that rule and you
[52:34] watch the claws come out you watch the
[52:37] attacks start because of that Pride this
[52:41] is who we are we don't want we don't
[52:42] want any of our community to look any
[52:44] different because we have pride in our
[52:46] community and you see it's a source of
[52:49] of false security and then God if God
[52:53] wants to do something with that group
[52:56] then he can't it's it's a barrier that
[52:58] he can't get in there brother Aaron gave
[53:01] the testimony the on
[53:03] Sunday that it was told he he grew up in
[53:06] a place that that they wanted you to
[53:08] speak in tongues and if you didn't speak
[53:11] in tongues then you didn't have the Holy
[53:13] Spirit that was a source of Pride for
[53:16] that church we all speak in tongues we
[53:18] are all have this gift in our lives and
[53:21] brother Aaron goes up there and he's
[53:23] like I I can't do it
[53:27] and you went up and faked it
[53:29] right and then the the minister started
[53:32] praising the Lord and shouting and and
[53:35] and saying well he got it he finally got
[53:37] it it was a source of Pride for that
[53:40] church and it was wrong all of us have
[53:43] different gifts some of us speak in
[53:46] tongues others
[53:47] don't Paul said do all speak in tongues
[53:50] do all do all prophesy no God gives all
[53:53] of these gifts and if we try to put
[53:55] everybody in the same same box then it
[53:57] becomes a source of Pride because of
[54:01] us pride and it separates
[54:05] us from the word of God and it separates
[54:08] us from each other do you see why it's
[54:10] such a strong
[54:12] barrier difference between the Amish and
[54:16] the way that they did things and then
[54:18] you look at this man Daniel in the
[54:20] Bible Daniel had always prayed three
[54:24] times a day he woke up in the morning he
[54:26] prayed opened his window and and he let
[54:28] the air in and he faced towards the
[54:30] temple in Jerusalem and he prayed and
[54:32] then at noon he prayed again and then in
[54:34] the evening he prayed again and that's
[54:37] what that's what he did that was his
[54:38] walk with the Lord and then then the
[54:41] king comes in and he's tricked into
[54:44] making a decree that no one should pray
[54:48] except if it was to
[54:50] this
[54:53] King Daniel heard the decree
[54:56] that would have been a good time for
[54:58] Daniel to saywell you know I don't have
[55:01] any Pride so I'm just not going to do it
[55:05] I think it was 30 days that the king
[55:06] gave the decree but no Daniel stood up
[55:10] for what he believed he didn't try to do
[55:13] something to to be different or to lift
[55:16] to exalt himself Daniel just kept
[55:19] praying and kept doing the the same
[55:21] thing that he always did and he wasn't
[55:23] afraid of the king's decree that's the
[55:25] difference between Daniel who was not
[55:28] who was just exalting the Lord Jesus and
[55:31] not himself and the others who exalt
[55:33] themselves and not the Lord Jesus
[55:36] because of
[55:37] Pride when I was growing up I
[55:42] remember people some the brothers would
[55:45] come over to our house they talk to Dad
[55:49] they were talking about all these these
[55:51] different doctrines and stuff and
[55:53] and I remember one one of
[55:57] them one of the the brothers of my dad's
[56:00] age said that he would rather his kids
[56:02] be in a bar on Sunday morning than to go
[56:05] to one of these
[56:07] churches Tucson Tabernacle was one of
[56:09] those churches he was talking
[56:11] about can you imagine the arrogance of
[56:15] saying something like that I remember as
[56:18] a kid I I heard him say it and can you
[56:20] imagine
[56:22] that of of the the arrogance that's
[56:25] there and the that's there saying that
[56:27] I'm so good that I don't want my
[56:29] children to be part of any of this other
[56:32] religion because we are too important we
[56:34] are too special and then you know what
[56:36] happened I hate to say it but he got his
[56:40] way I know at least two of his sons had
[56:45] major alcohol problems I think one of
[56:47] them ended up in
[56:48] jail I know one of them ended up in
[56:52] jail and he has the same thoughts today
[56:56] that he would rather them stay home and
[56:59] not being Church than lower themselves
[57:02] to those people that just don't have the
[57:04] great Revelation that that he has that
[57:07] his family has Pride you see you see how
[57:11] hard it is for God to get through
[57:12] something like that to blast through
[57:15] that barrier it's just it's it's extreme
[57:19] arrogance as I was talking about the the
[57:21] wise virgin and the foolish virgins the
[57:23] other day in the in the parable on on
[57:25] Sunday morning
[57:27] morning and I said that so many people
[57:31] will insult one another and call us call
[57:33] each other the foolish
[57:36] virgin judging them it's extreme Pride
[57:40] saying I am so much
[57:44] better putting them
[57:46] down it's it's a spirit brothers and
[57:49] sisters it's a harsh
[57:51] Spirit we don't think about Pride we
[57:55] think about
[57:58] the
[57:58] sins of uh of the world and we we think
[58:02] about how the the promiscuity in the
[58:05] world and we think about the drugs and
[58:07] we think about the alcohol all of which
[58:09] are are great sins but we forget about
[58:12] number
[58:14] one which is
[58:16] pride how important is
[58:19] it as I said you don't fight with your
[58:24] spouse if there's no Pride
[58:28] and there is no Pride whatsoever in
[58:31] God look at what he did look at how God
[58:34] represented
[58:36] himself God the creator of the heavens
[58:38] and the Earth the the greatest the only
[58:41] the the only one the Eternal God and he
[58:45] created this world shaped it with his
[58:48] hands created the stars in the sky
[58:51] separated the light from the darkness
[58:53] put the Sun out there created this world
[58:56] put water on it separated the water from
[58:59] the land put animals on it put his son
[59:02] and his daughter Eve there and said here
[59:06] take this this is my gift to you now
[59:08] multiply and replenish this Earth and
[59:11] and subdue it and you have rule over it
[59:13] and he made this beautiful Garden of
[59:14] Eden that he wanted them to live in and
[59:16] everything was just so beautiful they
[59:18] sinned and they they messed it up and
[59:21] then God shows his nature 4,000 or so
[59:25] years
[59:27] later not
[59:30] prideful but comes to Earth as the
[59:34] savior in a
[59:36] baby
[59:38] born to the
[59:41] poorest people in the
[59:45] land didn't have a house didn't have
[59:47] didn't have anything they were going to
[59:49] pay their
[59:51] taxes God chooses this Virgin Mary to
[59:56] have his
[59:59] son and he doesn't even give him a
[1:00:01] hospital doesn't even give him a
[1:00:04] room gives them A
[1:00:06] Manger to have this baby
[1:00:10] born with animals around and the dung of
[1:00:14] the animals around they put the baby in
[1:00:17] this little trough and that's what God
[1:00:19] chose to represent him there's no pride
[1:00:21] in God but how great is he
[1:00:26] that's how Jesus could say the first
[1:00:29] shall be last and the last shall be
[1:00:31] first and how great this God is and yet
[1:00:36] showed no Pride whatsoever came in the
[1:00:38] lowest of the
[1:00:40] low and this man Jesus
[1:00:43] Christ Proverbs
[1:00:46] 16 Verse 18 says
[1:00:50] this Pride goes Before Destruction
[1:00:57] and a hotty spirit before a fall every
[1:01:01] time I read that scripture I I I
[1:01:04] misinterpreted it I always thought that
[1:01:06] Pride goes away Before
[1:01:09] Destruction so when when you come right
[1:01:13] to it and your life's on the line or or
[1:01:15] or you really are embarrassed or
[1:01:17] something happens really bad you're like
[1:01:19] oh you know no Pride there I'll do
[1:01:22] anything but that's not what it means
[1:01:26] it means Pride
[1:01:29] preceeds the
[1:01:31] destruction the destruction's there and
[1:01:34] here is what leads us to that
[1:01:38] destruction is
[1:01:41] pride it goes before destruction and a
[1:01:44] hotti spirit before the PA before the
[1:01:49] fall the answer really to to my question
[1:01:52] on that because I thought that that
[1:01:54] Pride goes away before destruction
[1:01:56] Proverbs 18:12 says
[1:01:59] this before Before Destruction the heart
[1:02:03] of man is is Hottie and before
[1:02:07] honor is humility hottie means arrogance
[1:02:12] and this explains it all be be before
[1:02:15] the destruction that this man or this
[1:02:18] woman is arrogant and hotty and can't
[1:02:22] take any can't take any correction but
[1:02:27] honor is given with humility been born
[1:02:30] in a
[1:02:31] manger I tell you that is the ultimate
[1:02:34] to me the ultimate
[1:02:36] story of humbleness and
[1:02:39] humility is Jesus Christ the baby born
[1:02:43] in a manger born to the parents that he
[1:02:45] was born the upbringing that he
[1:02:50] had and it shows the very nature of God
[1:02:54] where even the Bible says that that
[1:02:57] Christ is the express image of God he is
[1:03:01] everything about God is in
[1:03:05] Christ before the
[1:03:07] destruction the heart of man is Hottie
[1:03:10] and before honor is humility as I said
[1:03:13] hottie means arrogant and and pride
[1:03:17] really it defies
[1:03:21] God Before
[1:03:23] Destruction there's Pride
[1:03:26] it defies God may give a gift how many
[1:03:29] times have we seen God give a gift to
[1:03:32] the church or give a gift to a person
[1:03:35] and that person refuses it because it
[1:03:38] doesn't go along they're too proud to
[1:03:41] accept something they're too proud to
[1:03:44] accept something different as I was
[1:03:46] talking about the different translations
[1:03:48] of the Bible we have brother brandom
[1:03:50] when he was preaching he didn't have
[1:03:52] anything
[1:03:53] else he had the King James and as I said
[1:03:56] I love the King James that's that's the
[1:03:58] my go-to that's what I read I love just
[1:04:01] the poetic nature and the beauty of the
[1:04:05] language but now there are there are
[1:04:08] more tools that we have to help us
[1:04:12] understand this
[1:04:13] word and if we stand back and say I
[1:04:16] don't want your gift
[1:04:19] God because it doesn't match my way of
[1:04:23] thinking proud
[1:04:26] and what's going to happen is you won't
[1:04:28] receive the blessings at the at the best
[1:04:30] case you won't be receive the blessings
[1:04:32] that God has for you in understanding
[1:04:34] your word I'm not saying all the
[1:04:35] translations are good there's many
[1:04:37] there's many bad ones but don't just
[1:04:41] refuse it because it's not it's not one
[1:04:45] translation that that you've grown up
[1:04:47] with as I said when they I want the kids
[1:04:50] in Sunday school I want them to learn
[1:04:52] the King
[1:04:53] James to quote the king James because
[1:04:56] that's what we
[1:04:57] use and if you are quoting different uh
[1:05:03] different translations then you're going
[1:05:05] to have tough time looking them up but
[1:05:07] if you're quoting one translation then
[1:05:09] you'll be able to find them later but
[1:05:11] these things are a
[1:05:13] blessing let's go back to I'm gonna I'm
[1:05:16] going to be fairly brief tonight let's
[1:05:19] go back to Malachi chter
[1:05:22] 4 and read
[1:05:24] this for
[1:05:26] behold the day cometh that shall burn as
[1:05:28] an oven and all the proud yay and all
[1:05:31] that do wickedly shall be stubble and
[1:05:34] the day that cometh shall burn them up
[1:05:36] sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall
[1:05:38] lead them neither root nor
[1:05:44] Branch the proud and the
[1:05:48] wicked in the day of judgment in the day
[1:05:51] of the Lord when all of this world is
[1:05:54] destroyed
[1:05:56] the proud are listed with the Wicked
[1:05:59] with the
[1:06:00] Sinners how we should always keep that
[1:06:03] in our
[1:06:05] minds First Peter chapter 5 and I'll
[1:06:09] close with the scripture the musicians
[1:06:11] can come
[1:06:13] likewise you who are younger be subject
[1:06:17] to the
[1:06:18] elders clothe yourselves all of you with
[1:06:21] humility toward one another for God OPP
[1:06:25] opposes the
[1:06:27] proud but gives grace to the
[1:06:34] humble I think that that's
[1:06:36] one all of the great Servants of
[1:06:40] God every Prophet really that's as I was
[1:06:45] praying
[1:06:46] about this subject and studying on this
[1:06:48] subject one thing that I think that
[1:06:53] pretty much every Prophet lacked
[1:06:56] was Pride look at Jeremiah what he went
[1:07:00] through look at Ezekiel what he went
[1:07:02] through all of the embarrassment that
[1:07:05] the prophets went through even David
[1:07:08] when David David sinned and even when he
[1:07:10] got caught immediately he humbled
[1:07:13] himself and so Lord I'm not
[1:07:15] worthy that Pride was cast out and the
[1:07:19] Really the Great Men and the great women
[1:07:22] of the Bible it's one thing I think that
[1:07:24] they had all in
[1:07:26] common they were not prideful people are
[1:07:30] you with
[1:07:32] me everything
[1:07:34] good we have a quiet
[1:07:37] audience
[1:07:42] tonight let me ask
[1:07:45] this how many people here struggle with
[1:07:51] pride now you ones that didn't raise
[1:07:53] your hand are the ones I preached
[1:07:56] tonight
[1:07:58] to I'm just kidding we all do we all
[1:08:03] struggle with pride we all we all have
[1:08:05] that in us and one of the scriptures
[1:08:08] that I left out tonight it's it's born
[1:08:11] in a man it's born in a woman to have
[1:08:14] pride it's in our children that they
[1:08:18] have pride and it's it grows up in us
[1:08:22] but we can overcome that
[1:08:26] and I look back at at last night I I
[1:08:28] just I felt so ashamed you're my
[1:08:32] friends and I can
[1:08:36] confess that buttering that
[1:08:39] bread that it displeased God I never
[1:08:44] want to displease him and it was because
[1:08:47] of
[1:08:50] Pride amen you with

[1:16:51] they were willing to do whatever the
[1:16:54] Lord said even Jonah you now he's the
