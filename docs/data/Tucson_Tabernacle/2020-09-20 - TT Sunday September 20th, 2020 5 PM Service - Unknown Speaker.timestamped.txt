[49:25] we ask
[49:26] amen while we're standing
[49:33] i'd like to read from two of moses
[49:35] writings
[49:37] that are found in the torah otherwise
[49:39] known as the pentateuch
[49:40] the first five books of the bible first
[49:43] from the book of leviticus
[49:45] chapter 23 the lord spake unto moses
[49:48] we we heard about that this morning
[49:50] didn't we the lord
[49:51] spake unto moses to speak
[49:54] unto the children of israel well what's
[49:57] he going to tell them
[49:58] in the seventh month in the first
[50:02] day of the month shall you have a
[50:04] sabbath
[50:05] shabbat a memorial of
[50:08] blowing of trumpets a holy convocation
[50:13] you shall do no servile work therein
[50:18] but ye shall offer an offering
[50:21] made by fire unto the lord fire like we
[50:26] heard this morning
[50:27] hebrews 12 29 our god is a consuming
[50:31] fire
[50:32] fire fuel oxygen
[50:35] oil the atmosphere
[50:39] burn burn holy spirit burn in me
[50:42] set my heart on fire fill me with the
[50:44] holy ghost
[50:46] and god's full desire or reading next
[50:49] from numbers and the seventh month
[50:53] on the first day of the month you shall
[50:55] have a holy convocation
[50:58] that's what we're having you shall do no
[51:00] survival work it's a day
[51:02] of blowing the trumpets unto you
[51:06] please be seated the feast of trumpets
[51:11] rule shashana in hebrew or head of the
[51:14] year
[51:15] is jewish new year it began last friday
[51:18] evening
[51:19] september 18th 2020.
[51:23] why not two weeks before easter isn't
[51:25] that supposed to be the first month
[51:27] there are two calendars in judaism the
[51:29] religious calendar begins in the spring
[51:31] and the first month adar
[51:33] includes pesach passover easter the
[51:36] civil year begins on the first day
[51:38] of the seventh month according to jewish
[51:41] tradition
[51:43] dating from the second century a.d so
[51:46] about 100 years after christ
[51:48] this corresponds to the sixth day of
[51:51] creation when god created adam
[51:53] that tradition asserts is this occurring
[51:55] on october 7
[51:57] 37 61 bc so on the jewish calendar this
[52:00] is
[52:01] now the year 5781 and it just began
[52:04] so happy new years and now
[52:07] i'm not going to get into chronology i
[52:09] didn't bring out a stack of egyptian
[52:11] books or anything tonight
[52:12] but we know this first day of the
[52:14] seventh month rosh hashanah
[52:16] as the feast of trumpets well what's the
[52:20] purpose of blowing the trumpets
[52:21] of the shofar it's to get the attention
[52:25] of the congregation it's to call them
[52:27] together to call a holy convocation a
[52:29] gathering
[52:30] they didn't have pa systems back then so
[52:33] shofar is a way to shout
[52:34] your attention please
[52:38] we know in the book of revelation the
[52:39] seven trumpets are for israel not the
[52:41] gentiles seventh trumpet launches the
[52:43] unveiling of christ to
[52:44] jewish people i'm not getting into any
[52:46] of that tonight
[52:48] but but in modern jewish practice modern
[52:51] being relative this goes back
[52:53] quite a few centuries rosh hashanah is
[52:56] observed for
[52:57] two days it's because their calendar is
[53:00] lunar
[53:00] and the new moon is the time when
[53:02] there's no light on the moon and
[53:03] sometimes it's a little hard to figure
[53:05] out when that is if it happens to be at
[53:07] 9am or something so because they
[53:10] couldn't really be sure they made it a
[53:12] two-day
[53:12] festival well the jewish day begins at
[53:16] dusk
[53:17] when three stars are visible in the sky
[53:19] at night and it lasts until the next
[53:21] dusk
[53:22] and because loshashana the feast of
[53:24] trumpets is observed for two days
[53:27] we have until dusk tonight to blow the
[53:30] shofar
[53:33] another hour or so now as many of you
[53:36] know
[53:37] in the 1970s heather and i and our
[53:39] growing family
[53:40] lived in israel but in 1987 we returned
[53:43] to israel
[53:45] why to attend the wedding of my fiance
[53:50] well well my former fiance okay when i
[53:53] was in high school
[53:54] here in tucson i made an agreement with
[53:57] brother quinton
[53:58] and sister patty erickson to marry a
[54:01] daughter of theirs
[54:02] it would be a long engagement for this
[54:04] arranged marriage because
[54:06] i was only 18 and she was only two
[54:11] well after i met heather i went back to
[54:13] the ericksons and they graciously
[54:15] consented
[54:16] to void that arranged marriage
[54:19] anyway we were walking in the streets of
[54:22] the old city jerusalem in an area
[54:24] known as the cardo you can see it on the
[54:26] screen there this is a
[54:27] a street with small shops on either side
[54:30] but it was a main street
[54:31] it was uncovered during archeological
[54:34] excavations
[54:35] the pavement of it dates back to the
[54:38] time of jesus although the portion
[54:39] that you can now access the portion you
[54:42] see there dates back to the 6th century
[54:44] 80 the byzantine period
[54:45] as do the shops that you see in the
[54:47] other picture on the slide
[54:49] of course the shops now have you know
[54:50] glass walls and security systems and all
[54:53] that
[54:54] well
[54:58] while i was there i found this shofar
[55:03] it wasn't considered kosher because it
[55:04] had a tiny blemish in it
[55:07] so i was able to purchase it at a price
[55:09] that even i can manage to pay
[55:11] i later took it to a friend in israel he
[55:12] said he could fix it and he did
[55:14] i think if a rabbi inspected it now
[55:16] they'd declare it kosher but i
[55:18] i know it's not of course i'm not kosher
[55:21] either
[55:21] but anyway it's his a real shofar
[55:25] and since it's nearly dusk i thought
[55:29] i'd like to take the opportunity
[55:32] to sound the trumpet on the day
[55:35] of the feast of trumpets now i'm not
[55:37] very good at this
[55:41] this is a jewish prayer shawl that has
[55:44] hebrew inscription on it and so forth
[55:45] and basically the idea of the jewish
[55:48] folks when they're going to
[55:49] blow a shofar is they want to
[55:52] they want to wrap themselves in the word
[55:54] they have this fringed garment with
[55:56] these
[55:56] with these to leak now they've got all
[55:58] sort of traditions about how many
[55:59] threads and how many knots and
[56:01] certain things that they say when they
[56:03] put this on
[56:05] but when they're going to blow the
[56:06] shofar this this is their
[56:09] prayer closet if you will
[56:12] and then
[56:16] don't laugh
[56:21] that wasn't very good
[56:23] [Music]
[56:27] and that's the sound of the shofar
[56:36] and we want to keep ourselves wrapped in
[56:38] the word
[56:46] now and that they do one other thing in
[56:48] conjunction with this holiday
[56:50] it's it's called the tash leak
[56:54] it's a bit like our society's new year's
[56:56] resolutions representing a fresh start
[56:59] but unlike our secular pledges
[57:01] to do better uh dash leak is based on
[57:04] repentance
[57:06] the observant jew will preferably go to
[57:09] a body of water
[57:10] a stream or a lake or a sea and ask god
[57:14] to take away their sins
[57:15] and symbolically cast them in
[57:19] in micah chapter 7 we read who is a god
[57:22] like unto thee
[57:23] that pardon with iniquity and passeth by
[57:25] the transgression of the remnant of his
[57:27] heritage
[57:28] he retaineth not his anger forever
[57:31] because
[57:32] he delighteth in mercy we call that
[57:36] grace
[57:37] he will turn again he will have
[57:39] compassion upon us and he will
[57:41] he will turn again he will subdue our
[57:45] iniquities
[57:46] and thou wilt cast all their sins into
[57:49] the depths of the sea
[57:52] so brother lyle is our topic tonight the
[57:54] feast of trumpets
[57:56] no what was the purpose of the shofar to
[58:00] get your attention and and i i hope i've
[58:02] got your attention now
[58:04] because that's what the bloating of the
[58:05] shofar does it gets attention
[58:08] and calls the gathering of god's people
[58:10] a holy convocation
[58:14] i want to speak tonight about jesus the
[58:17] light of the
[58:20] over the last few months especially i've
[58:22] heard people
[58:23] discouraged discouraged about life
[58:26] dissatisfied perhaps with their
[58:28] walk in christ discouraged about these
[58:31] times of enforced separation
[58:33] deaths and families and they can't even
[58:35] have funerals
[58:37] loss of job loss of income we've heard
[58:39] prayer requests about that even here
[58:41] this evening about
[58:42] employment economic stress instability
[58:46] general disheartenment with the
[58:48] direction our society is going we know
[58:49] it has to go there
[58:51] but it hurts to see it sharply divided
[58:54] political situation
[58:56] it's our age of laodicea apathy
[58:59] towards anything related to god it's
[59:02] lukewarm
[59:03] agnostic and this sometimes leads
[59:07] to a question of self-worth what what am
[59:10] i doing here anyway
[59:12] i don't seem to be accomplishing
[59:14] anything
[59:15] what's the point why does god even put
[59:17] up with me
[59:19] well jesus said this about our value
[59:22] to god matthew 10 are not
[59:26] two sparrows sold for a farthing
[59:29] and one of them shall not fall to the
[59:31] ground
[59:32] without your father luke expands on this
[59:35] he says
[59:35] are not five sparrows sold for two
[59:37] farthings
[59:38] looks like they had quantity discounts
[59:40] in jesus time too and not one of them
[59:43] is forgotten before god but even the
[59:46] very hairs of your head
[59:49] are all numbered fear not therefore
[59:53] you're of more value than many sparrows
[59:57] but but sometimes i still don't
[1:00:00] feel like i'm worth very much
[1:00:04] well consider a pair of 20
[1:00:07] bills one is
[1:00:11] smooth shiny sterile
[1:00:14] maybe even crisp the other
[1:00:18] it's wrinkled defaced
[1:00:21] scribbled on dropped and damp and dirty
[1:00:24] maybe it
[1:00:25] fell on the floor of a not so clean
[1:00:28] public toilet or something
[1:00:29] it's just it's just not very nice
[1:00:34] well one you'd gladly put in your wallet
[1:00:37] the other might want to clean it up and
[1:00:42] wash your hands twice
[1:00:45] but here's the thing they're both
[1:00:48] worth exactly 20 dollars
[1:00:52] whether clean and crisp or ragged and
[1:00:55] worn the value
[1:00:57] of the one is not more and the value of
[1:01:00] the other
[1:01:01] is not less and and what about that
[1:01:04] value of 20
[1:01:05] how was that established it was not
[1:01:08] established
[1:01:09] by its condition it was established
[1:01:13] by its creator now you may
[1:01:16] be feeling dirty care worn
[1:01:20] torn and patched wondering what value do
[1:01:23] i really have in the kingdom of god
[1:01:25] but your value was established
[1:01:28] by god that's what we call
[1:01:32] justification and what is that value
[1:01:36] then
[1:01:36] of course it's not twenty dollars he put
[1:01:39] such a high
[1:01:40] value on you and you and you
[1:01:43] and you and me that he came in the form
[1:01:47] of jesus
[1:01:48] to redeem you why
[1:01:52] would he redeem me so he could spend
[1:01:55] eternity with you and so you could spend
[1:01:58] eternity
[1:01:59] with him he'll get you cleaned up
[1:02:03] we call that sanctification but he
[1:02:06] doesn't stop
[1:02:07] there now the last several weeks we've
[1:02:10] heard a consistent reminder that we're
[1:02:12] to return to the faith of the first
[1:02:13] christians
[1:02:14] back to pentecost a heart-based
[1:02:17] experiential relationship with christ
[1:02:19] not a mere mental assent to christian
[1:02:21] principles or philosophy
[1:02:24] right we're told in this letter to
[1:02:26] hebrews chapter 4
[1:02:28] seeing then that we have a great high
[1:02:31] priest that has passed into the heavens
[1:02:35] jesus the son of god let us hold
[1:02:38] fast to our profession we have not a
[1:02:41] high priest that cannot be touched with
[1:02:43] the feelings of our infirmities
[1:02:46] but was all points tempted
[1:02:50] like as we are yet without sin let us
[1:02:54] therefore because of this because of
[1:02:57] that high priest
[1:02:58] because of that connection let's come
[1:03:02] boldly to the throne of grace
[1:03:06] that we may obtain mercy
[1:03:10] and find grace to help in time of need
[1:03:16] have you ever wondered if jesus was
[1:03:19] really tempted in all points like you or
[1:03:23] like me
[1:03:24] wasn't he the incarnate god aren't we
[1:03:27] told he was
[1:03:28] the uniquely born son of god
[1:03:32] well the answer to all three of those
[1:03:34] questions
[1:03:36] is yes jesus was god
[1:03:40] and he was simultaneously a man a flesh
[1:03:43] and blood human read in philippians
[1:03:45] let this mind be in you
[1:03:49] which was also in christ jesus
[1:03:52] let's share his mind who being in the
[1:03:55] form of god
[1:03:57] thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:04:00] with god but made himself
[1:04:04] of no reputation took upon him
[1:04:07] the form of a servant and was made in
[1:04:10] the likeness
[1:04:11] of men he took on
[1:04:14] the form of man you might say oh he
[1:04:18] but he was different he couldn't really
[1:04:19] be tempted the way i am
[1:04:22] it was just a mask he wore it wasn't
[1:04:24] really like me
[1:04:26] paul insists he was tempted like us
[1:04:30] and every point not not not a mask
[1:04:33] he was absolutely a man
[1:04:37] here are some things that he said about
[1:04:38] himself
[1:04:40] john chapter 8 then speak jesus unto
[1:04:43] them again
[1:04:43] saying i am the light of the world
[1:04:49] that's the title of tonight's message
[1:04:51] the light of the world
[1:04:52] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:04:56] darkness
[1:04:57] but shall have the light of life
[1:05:00] and further on in john's gospel
[1:05:04] jesus says in 9 5 as long
[1:05:07] as i am in the world i
[1:05:10] am the light of the world
[1:05:13] and after some time passes john
[1:05:17] writes a letter in first john chapter
[1:05:20] one we read in verse 5
[1:05:21] this then is the message which we have
[1:05:24] heard of him
[1:05:26] and declare unto you this is what jesus
[1:05:30] told me
[1:05:30] john is saying god is light in him
[1:05:34] there's no darkness
[1:05:37] well you say what what's light got to do
[1:05:40] with him
[1:05:41] being a person like me i don't blow in
[1:05:43] the dark
[1:05:45] we know that the natural world has
[1:05:47] parallels
[1:05:49] it models it intersects with in some
[1:05:51] ways it interacts with the spiritual
[1:05:53] realm
[1:05:54] the jargon that we use for this is type
[1:05:57] as in the natural types the spiritual or
[1:06:01] joseph was a type of christ
[1:06:06] we think of our age of laodicea starting
[1:06:09] around 1906
[1:06:11] but i'd like to take you back one year
[1:06:14] further than that to 1905 that sort of
[1:06:17] overlap period
[1:06:18] a 26 year old patent examiner a fellow
[1:06:21] involved in intellectual property
[1:06:23] brother peter
[1:06:24] in switzerland named albert einstein
[1:06:27] published a paper investigating certain
[1:06:30] properties of electromagnetism
[1:06:33] your eyes are starting to roll it's okay
[1:06:35] some electromagnetic energy we're
[1:06:37] we perceive as light we have these two
[1:06:41] organs these cameras that god gave us so
[1:06:44] that we can
[1:06:44] detect light and and this research was
[1:06:49] done
[1:06:50] einstein dug into this because light
[1:06:54] exhibited properties that just didn't
[1:06:56] fit the understanding of the physicists
[1:06:58] of the 19th century
[1:07:00] it's just not behaving the way they
[1:07:03] expected it to behave
[1:07:05] so his paper product proposed what is
[1:07:07] known as the special theory of
[1:07:09] relativity
[1:07:10] i'm not going to go into that in simple
[1:07:11] terms it just means that the laws that
[1:07:13] govern what happens on earth are not
[1:07:15] unique to the earth they apply
[1:07:17] throughout the universe the impact
[1:07:21] of that revelation is profound
[1:07:26] it's okay we're not going further into
[1:07:28] that but it's just like luther's
[1:07:29] doctrine of justification which
[1:07:31] dates back to the prophet habakkuk's
[1:07:33] writings this was not a new thing
[1:07:35] right we're trying to go back to the
[1:07:37] original lutheran back to habakkuk
[1:07:39] the just shall live by faith but that
[1:07:42] didn't fit the
[1:07:43] catholic understanding of salvation
[1:07:46] wesley's revelation of sanctification
[1:07:49] didn't
[1:07:50] fit the lutheran understanding of our
[1:07:53] relationship with god there's something
[1:07:56] unique
[1:07:57] about light stated
[1:08:01] simply light has two fundamental
[1:08:04] characteristics
[1:08:06] that are opposite yet it possesses both
[1:08:10] light appears to consist of small
[1:08:12] particles we call these
[1:08:13] photons okay in outer space we
[1:08:17] measure the effect of the resulting
[1:08:19] so-called solar wind
[1:08:20] we have to account for that if you send
[1:08:22] a probe to mars
[1:08:24] and you don't account for the force of
[1:08:25] those photons from the sun those tiny
[1:08:28] particles striking that spacecraft
[1:08:30] you'll miss mars by
[1:08:32] 15 or 20 000 miles you have to take it
[1:08:35] into account it's a tiny force but it's
[1:08:37] there
[1:08:38] okay um so light
[1:08:42] then consists of particles
[1:08:45] okay but that's how it gets through
[1:08:49] space
[1:08:49] right but but but how do they travel
[1:08:51] through glass
[1:08:54] windows not shattered it's not
[1:08:57] you know sanded and made opaque and all
[1:09:00] the rest of it
[1:09:01] light can go through very thick glass
[1:09:05] with no apparent effect yet not pass
[1:09:08] through a
[1:09:08] thin sheet of dark paper how do
[1:09:11] so-called
[1:09:12] low-e windows work in your home to
[1:09:15] reduce the heat from the sunlight that
[1:09:16] comes into the room
[1:09:19] what sort of particles do that
[1:09:24] they don't there aren't any they can't
[1:09:27] but a wave
[1:09:28] a wave a wave is a kind of a vibration
[1:09:31] of electromagnetic energy in this case
[1:09:33] if you will a wave camera
[1:09:35] like a radio signal that you can receive
[1:09:37] when you use a cell phone or or a wi-fi
[1:09:39] device
[1:09:41] so so then lights a wave yeah
[1:09:46] yeah but but you just said light
[1:09:48] consists of particles
[1:09:50] which is it it's both
[1:09:54] waves displace something right waves in
[1:09:57] the ocean
[1:09:57] the wave and energy displace the water
[1:09:59] but the water just bobs up and down
[1:10:02] unless it interacts with the shore and
[1:10:04] then you get a surf but you don't have a
[1:10:05] surf in the middle of the ocean
[1:10:07] space is a vacuum essentially so there's
[1:10:10] nothing to displace to propagate a wave
[1:10:13] so if light were simply a wave
[1:10:14] we'd all be in the dark
[1:10:18] but it would never reach us but if it
[1:10:21] were only particles
[1:10:23] it might break your window when it
[1:10:24] arrives here right
[1:10:26] transparent wouldn't wouldn't really
[1:10:28] mean anything
[1:10:29] so to carry this analogy of light
[1:10:32] remember we're talking about jesus being
[1:10:34] the light of the world
[1:10:35] to take this analogy jesus a little
[1:10:37] further think of us
[1:10:39] humans as particles as objects
[1:10:42] okay and and think of
[1:10:46] him spirit god
[1:10:49] not a physical being but but a wave
[1:10:52] not a particle so just like light
[1:10:57] jesus had a dual nature
[1:11:02] he could be a particle a human and still
[1:11:05] be a wave
[1:11:06] spirit he could be a hundred percent man
[1:11:09] and a hundred percent god
[1:11:12] he wasn't just a spirit in some sort of
[1:11:15] a hologram
[1:11:16] projection that looked like a man
[1:11:19] he was a man 100
[1:11:22] but he was also god in the flesh of that
[1:11:25] man
[1:11:26] so we know that light possesses two
[1:11:29] states
[1:11:30] wave and particle two distinct natures
[1:11:35] you say well that's nice brother but uh
[1:11:38] below the shofar again i'm
[1:11:40] falling asleep i just want you to see
[1:11:44] that jesus could simultaneously possess
[1:11:47] two attributes he could be fully god
[1:11:51] and fully man so he could be tested
[1:11:55] in every point just like us
[1:11:58] as his human self now and light
[1:12:02] is the only our our vision senses light
[1:12:05] and that's the only thing that has this
[1:12:07] characteristic
[1:12:08] you can't detect it by touch or by smell
[1:12:12] or
[1:12:12] i won't stick my tongue out taste
[1:12:16] right it's by sight right
[1:12:20] we just read that god is light
[1:12:23] and jesus specifically identified
[1:12:26] himself as what
[1:12:28] the light of the world
[1:12:31] that's why i requested that song earlier
[1:12:33] this evening so much god
[1:12:35] yet so much man the dual nature of
[1:12:38] christ
[1:12:41] well you say that's nice brother
[1:12:44] but i'm i'm just a human i'm i'm not god
[1:12:47] ah unless you've received the holy
[1:12:50] spirit
[1:12:51] then you become a part of god
[1:12:55] jesus said as long as i am in the world
[1:12:59] i am the light of the world paul tells
[1:13:01] us in romans whom he did for
[1:13:03] know he also
[1:13:06] did predestinate to be conformed
[1:13:09] to the image that's a kind of a visual
[1:13:12] thing
[1:13:12] isn't it the image of his son that
[1:13:16] what he might be the first
[1:13:19] born among many
[1:13:22] brethren really
[1:13:26] really if he's our brother then
[1:13:29] then then does that mean we can possess
[1:13:32] that
[1:13:32] same type of dual nature
[1:13:36] yes we're taught every seed bears after
[1:13:40] its kind
[1:13:41] right john 12 he says while ye have
[1:13:44] light believe in the light
[1:13:48] that you may be the children
[1:13:51] of light these things spake jesus and
[1:13:54] departed and did
[1:13:55] hide himself from them every seed
[1:13:59] brings forth of its kind if jesus is the
[1:14:02] light and we become the children of
[1:14:04] light we become his children his
[1:14:05] offspring then we share his
[1:14:08] dual nature dna if you will
[1:14:11] so then aren't we the same kind as him
[1:14:17] matthew 5 yeah jesus says you
[1:14:21] are the light of the world a city set on
[1:14:24] a hill cannot be hid
[1:14:26] in other words we can have the same
[1:14:29] dual nature he can truly be tested in
[1:14:33] all points like us but without sin
[1:14:36] so that he could pay the price for our
[1:14:40] redemption if
[1:14:43] we don't have the indwelling of the holy
[1:14:45] spirit in the same
[1:14:48] magnitude that he did he had it all in
[1:14:51] one individual
[1:14:52] but if the spirit of god dwells in us
[1:14:56] what did brother branham call us in
[1:14:58] those conditions he used the term
[1:15:00] messiah et's right little
[1:15:03] messiahs messiah means anointed in this
[1:15:06] case
[1:15:07] by the spirit of god rather than a
[1:15:09] physical oil like
[1:15:10] like olive oil how did people get light
[1:15:14] in the midst of darkness in jesus day
[1:15:17] they didn't have electric lights
[1:15:18] leds little blinky cell phones right
[1:15:23] they had candles and they had lamps
[1:15:27] lamps were filled with olive oil and it
[1:15:30] was then wicked up
[1:15:32] and burned to provide light
[1:15:35] as you can see from this photo of an
[1:15:37] excavation there
[1:15:38] many lamps weren't large that just fits
[1:15:41] in the palm of a hand kind of like a
[1:15:43] little pen light or something right
[1:15:45] so they don't hold much oil do they
[1:15:48] no so think of the parable of the 10
[1:15:51] virgins in their lamps
[1:15:54] you better keep plenty of oil handy if
[1:15:56] your light's burning
[1:15:58] you've got to keep refilling that lamp
[1:16:00] it can go
[1:16:01] fast but only if it's burning if it's
[1:16:05] not burning because you're going to save
[1:16:06] the oil because you might run out
[1:16:08] uh-oh what happens if it evaporates
[1:16:13] trouble jesus said
[1:16:16] neither do men light a candle and put it
[1:16:19] under
[1:16:20] a bushel otherwise why bother to light
[1:16:23] it you're wasting the oil snuff it out
[1:16:25] but it's on a candle stick and it gives
[1:16:28] light unto
[1:16:29] all that are in the house
[1:16:32] i've got a question for brother lyle
[1:16:35] is my light shining is yours
[1:16:40] jesus said maybe this is a commandment
[1:16:44] he said
[1:16:44] let your light so shine before men that
[1:16:48] they may see
[1:16:49] your good works and tell you what a good
[1:16:52] person you are
[1:16:54] uh no that's not what it says and
[1:16:57] glorify your father which is in heaven
[1:17:00] because if he's providing the light
[1:17:02] he gets the glory well
[1:17:06] well what are those good works
[1:17:10] and john we're told they said unto him
[1:17:13] what shall we do that we might
[1:17:17] work the works of god and jesus answered
[1:17:21] and said unto them
[1:17:22] this is the work of god
[1:17:25] you believe on him whom he has sent
[1:17:29] be his witnesses live your faith
[1:17:33] it's not complicated this is not
[1:17:37] complicated maybe that's what makes it
[1:17:40] hard
[1:17:40] we want it to be complicated so we can
[1:17:43] get involved
[1:17:44] right well well let's look at the early
[1:17:47] church for just a moment
[1:17:51] acts 2 verse 1. we've read this many
[1:17:55] times
[1:17:55] when the day of pentecost 50 days
[1:17:59] after the crucifixion ten days after
[1:18:01] jesus ascension
[1:18:02] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[1:18:05] they were all with one accord
[1:18:08] in one place
[1:18:11] look all of one accord
[1:18:14] all means every whole the whole body of
[1:18:17] christ at that time
[1:18:18] was in one place and they run one accord
[1:18:21] when you
[1:18:22] tear down into the greek of all this
[1:18:24] stuff right it means
[1:18:25] unanimously of one mind let this mind be
[1:18:29] in you that was in christ jesus they
[1:18:31] were of one mind
[1:18:32] and this comes from roots of two words
[1:18:34] one meaning
[1:18:35] together and the other means
[1:18:39] passion not just mere agreement
[1:18:42] not agreeing to disagree not well i
[1:18:45] don't agree with that but i'm not going
[1:18:46] to say anything
[1:18:47] no no oh now in what way were they
[1:18:51] in this one accord in this one agreement
[1:18:55] we're not told uh personally
[1:18:58] i think that it was and their renewed
[1:19:00] dedication
[1:19:01] to being followers of jesus he said wait
[1:19:04] terry the power will come hang on
[1:19:07] be patient it's going to come he didn't
[1:19:10] tell him it'll come on this day at this
[1:19:12] moment at this time
[1:19:14] they had to be together they had to be
[1:19:16] in unity
[1:19:17] and they had to wait back to pentecost
[1:19:21] includes but it's not limited to
[1:19:25] being filled with the holy spirit or
[1:19:27] experiencing the presence of god it also
[1:19:30] means
[1:19:30] being passionately unified in our hearts
[1:19:33] and minds
[1:19:34] towards god and the body of christ
[1:19:37] consider some of those people that were
[1:19:39] in the room matthew
[1:19:42] he was a tax collector he worked for the
[1:19:45] enemy
[1:19:47] he took money from his own people and
[1:19:49] gave it to the people that were
[1:19:50] suppressing them
[1:19:52] he worked for the enemy then there was a
[1:19:56] fellow called
[1:19:57] simon the zealot well he was a zealot
[1:20:00] right
[1:20:00] what is that armed rebellion fight the
[1:20:04] romans kill them
[1:20:05] don't cooperate this led to the
[1:20:08] destruction of jerusalem and the temple
[1:20:10] in 70 a.d it was the zealots that were
[1:20:12] the uprising
[1:20:13] and this disciple is identified as being
[1:20:16] a zealot
[1:20:19] what about mary magdalene formerly demon
[1:20:22] possessed
[1:20:24] now delivered and she was the only
[1:20:27] disciple the only follower
[1:20:29] that believed jesus enough to go to his
[1:20:33] tomb
[1:20:34] before dawn without anointing spices
[1:20:39] to seek him is it true
[1:20:43] did he rise will i find him
[1:20:46] or is it just going to be his body
[1:20:48] laying in this borrowed tomb
[1:20:51] then there were james and john these two
[1:20:53] brothers right
[1:20:54] they kind of wanted to award it over the
[1:20:56] other guys
[1:20:57] oh lord grant that one of us can sit on
[1:20:59] your right hand and one on your left you
[1:21:01] say oh
[1:21:01] no that that was his mother that said
[1:21:04] that what
[1:21:05] was it was it jesus answered and said
[1:21:10] you know not what you ask are you able
[1:21:13] to drink of the cup
[1:21:15] that i shall drink of and to be baptized
[1:21:19] with the baptism that i am baptized with
[1:21:23] they not their mother they said unto him
[1:21:27] yeah we can do that hmm
[1:21:33] he said unto them
[1:21:36] you shall drink indeed to my cup
[1:21:40] you will be and baptized with the
[1:21:42] baptism i'm baptized with
[1:21:45] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[1:21:46] left it's not mine to give
[1:21:49] but it shall be given to them for whom
[1:21:51] it is prepared
[1:21:53] of my father now look what happens this
[1:21:56] wasn't some conversation they had in a
[1:21:58] corner they didn't go behind the
[1:22:00] backstop and talk about this
[1:22:02] when the ten heard it
[1:22:06] they were moved with indignation against
[1:22:08] the two brethren
[1:22:10] these guys are pretty upset and this
[1:22:12] this wasn't an event that happened like
[1:22:14] three years before this time this was
[1:22:17] pretty recent stuff
[1:22:19] now nine of those 10 were there because
[1:22:22] judas had hanged himself right
[1:22:24] all these guys had walked with him they
[1:22:27] taught with him they performed preaching
[1:22:29] and miracles with him they witnessed
[1:22:32] so much but they were still human oh
[1:22:37] i want to sit on the right i want to sit
[1:22:38] on the left i i want some recognition
[1:22:41] here
[1:22:42] right mattias he was there in the upper
[1:22:44] room he wasn't
[1:22:45] one of the 12 but the bible tells us he
[1:22:47] was with them from the beginning
[1:22:50] thomas known as a doubter bit of a
[1:22:53] skeptic
[1:22:55] he was there the 11 disciples
[1:22:58] had ridiculed and dismissed the women's
[1:23:00] testimony of having seen him on easter
[1:23:02] morning
[1:23:03] those 11 were there and so were the
[1:23:05] women
[1:23:08] the very women were still in that room
[1:23:11] with them
[1:23:13] yet before the holy ghost fell before
[1:23:16] they had that power
[1:23:18] they were gathered in one mind and one
[1:23:21] accord
[1:23:22] waiting on a promise that they believed
[1:23:25] was gonna come and what happened
[1:23:30] suddenly unexpectedly they didn't know
[1:23:33] the moment it would happen
[1:23:34] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:23:40] a rushing mighty wind it filled
[1:23:43] all the house where they were sitting
[1:23:46] the moving of the spirit
[1:23:48] the pneuma is the greek word it's the
[1:23:51] same word the atmosphere the spirit the
[1:23:54] air god is moving by his spirit
[1:23:59] and there appeared unto them
[1:24:03] what cloven tongue's like is a fire
[1:24:07] little little lamps
[1:24:10] right and it's sat on
[1:24:13] the 12th oh no it sat
[1:24:16] on the it sat on each
[1:24:20] of them they were in it together but
[1:24:24] it's an
[1:24:24] individual thing and they were all
[1:24:27] there together in all the people in that
[1:24:30] room
[1:24:31] 120 received the baptism of the holy
[1:24:34] spirit the infilling of the holy spirit
[1:24:37] the light of the world
[1:24:41] it and note these these these cloven
[1:24:43] tongues is
[1:24:44] it as i say part of the light of the
[1:24:46] world
[1:24:47] and they were all filled with the holy
[1:24:50] ghost
[1:24:51] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:24:53] the spirit gave them utterance
[1:24:56] how does that work the spirit the pneuma
[1:25:00] the moving of the atmosphere past vocal
[1:25:03] cords yielded to the holy spirit
[1:25:06] and that produced the utterance that
[1:25:09] produced the sounds that produced the
[1:25:10] words
[1:25:13] oh god that i could be yielded to him
[1:25:16] that we could all be so yielded to him
[1:25:18] that any sound that comes past us isn't
[1:25:20] just
[1:25:21] our lungs working but it's the moving of
[1:25:25] his
[1:25:25] spirit that animates that
[1:25:28] speaks that causes to be that expression
[1:25:32] that he wants to hear
[1:25:36] did they now have that dual nature
[1:25:40] yeah look at peter
[1:25:43] all of them after the crucifixion
[1:25:47] what do they do they hid
[1:25:50] acts 1 tells us that they continued to
[1:25:53] be together they were hiding
[1:25:54] together right and and it even tells us
[1:25:57] in acts 1 they were of one accord
[1:26:00] it's an expression of unity i think of
[1:26:02] that song i don't know why it comes to
[1:26:04] mind right now but
[1:26:05] but but it's from the bible in hebrew we
[1:26:08] learned it
[1:26:08] when we were in israel
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:17] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[1:26:19] for brethren
[1:26:20] to dwell together in unity
[1:26:24] and what happens jesus said
[1:26:28] appeared to them earlier and he told
[1:26:31] them
[1:26:32] ye shall receive power here's a promise
[1:26:35] here's a prophecy
[1:26:37] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[1:26:39] you
[1:26:41] power power
[1:26:45] for what purpose god's gone to a lot of
[1:26:49] effort
[1:26:50] jesus has paid a tremendous price
[1:26:54] for this purpose and what is that
[1:26:57] purpose
[1:26:58] why are you going to receive power for
[1:27:01] what
[1:27:01] to be witnesses unto me
[1:27:05] both in jerusalem judea samaria
[1:27:08] to the uttermost part of the earth
[1:27:13] why were they given this gift this
[1:27:15] indwelling of god himself
[1:27:18] to become bold witnesses of the gospel
[1:27:21] the good news
[1:27:24] last thursday i was privileged
[1:27:28] to hear my brother noel preach a midweek
[1:27:30] service to several churches in india
[1:27:33] he was at his home in north carolina but
[1:27:35] through the use of modern technology
[1:27:36] like pastor matt
[1:27:37] has been using to speak to us when he's
[1:27:39] in south carolina
[1:27:41] noel was able to minister in india and
[1:27:43] heather and i
[1:27:45] were able to be there too his topic
[1:27:48] was faith and i'm not going to give you
[1:27:52] the whole sermon the conclusion
[1:27:54] it's simply accepting the truth of god's
[1:27:58] word
[1:28:00] let's look at abraham genesis 15
[1:28:03] and he abram believed in the lord and he
[1:28:07] god countered to abram for righteousness
[1:28:11] for meeting the requirements of a right
[1:28:13] relationship between them
[1:28:14] abraham was called the friend of god
[1:28:17] right
[1:28:18] a couple of chapters later when abram
[1:28:20] was 90 years old and nine
[1:28:23] that's even older appeared to abram
[1:28:27] and said unto him i am the almighty god
[1:28:32] and he gave him a command walk before me
[1:28:35] and be thou perfect
[1:28:40] be perfect a simple sounding command
[1:28:45] how can anyone do that
[1:28:48] by faith believing god
[1:28:51] not not believing that there is a god
[1:28:54] but
[1:28:55] believe in god accepting what he says
[1:28:59] through faith comes obedience
[1:29:04] well brother i confess to you sometimes
[1:29:09] i'm not obedient well what happens then
[1:29:14] we're told in first john if we say we
[1:29:17] have no sin
[1:29:19] we deceive ourselves truth is in us
[1:29:24] if we confess our sins
[1:29:28] he is faithful and just
[1:29:31] to forgive us our sins and to cleanse
[1:29:34] us from all unrighteousness what that
[1:29:37] leaves is
[1:29:38] righteousness that right relationship
[1:29:40] but
[1:29:42] but what does that mean faithful and
[1:29:44] just
[1:29:47] what does that mean well in the middle
[1:29:50] of the sermon on the mountain jesus told
[1:29:52] us
[1:29:53] matthew 6 9 after this manner therefore
[1:29:56] pray ye
[1:29:58] our father which art in heaven
[1:30:01] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[1:30:05] come thy will be done on earth
[1:30:08] as it is in heaven give us this day our
[1:30:11] daily bread
[1:30:12] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:30:16] our debtors
[1:30:17] lead us not into temptation deliver us
[1:30:19] from evil thine is the kingdom the power
[1:30:22] the glory forever
[1:30:23] so be it amen there's something so
[1:30:27] important here
[1:30:28] that in the next verses jesus repeats it
[1:30:31] and
[1:30:32] emphasizes it what are we talking about
[1:30:36] forgiveness of sin right and he says if
[1:30:39] you
[1:30:40] forgive men their trespasses
[1:30:44] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:30:47] you
[1:30:47] faithful and just but if you forgive
[1:30:51] not men their trespasses uh oh
[1:30:55] neither will your father forgive yours
[1:31:00] remember if you confess your sins he's
[1:31:04] faithful
[1:31:04] and just to forgive you of your sins but
[1:31:06] only
[1:31:08] if you forgive others of their sins
[1:31:12] against you whoa
[1:31:18] matthew tells us peter came to him and
[1:31:21] said
[1:31:22] lord how oft shall my brother sin
[1:31:24] against me and i forgive him
[1:31:27] seven times that's pretty big of me
[1:31:30] right
[1:31:31] but at some point can i stop guy's a
[1:31:34] bully or he won't stop can i
[1:31:36] give him a lesson
[1:31:40] what did jesus say to him i say not unto
[1:31:43] thee
[1:31:44] seven times but 70 times seven
[1:31:47] you have to keep doing it and later
[1:31:51] later he doesn't say this but later just
[1:31:54] watch me
[1:31:55] on the cross i'll be asking forgiveness
[1:31:58] for the very ones torturing and abusing
[1:32:01] and killing me
[1:32:02] and you need to become like me peter the
[1:32:06] same nature
[1:32:07] it won't be easy but i'll be there
[1:32:11] to help and to comfort
[1:32:15] forgiving those that offend or hurt
[1:32:18] it's not easy it's not our human nature
[1:32:22] it's character building but it's
[1:32:26] absolutely necessary you can't squirm
[1:32:29] your way out of it
[1:32:33] there's another point about obedience
[1:32:36] recall recently we've had lessons about
[1:32:39] the
[1:32:39] atmosphere the atmosphere of god of the
[1:32:42] holy spirit
[1:32:43] brother peter brought us a message one
[1:32:44] wednesday night about i can't breathe
[1:32:47] right the atmosphere the spirit recall
[1:32:50] that
[1:32:51] in exodus they were leaving egypt
[1:32:54] for the promised land they followed
[1:32:56] moses who followed the light the pillar
[1:32:58] of fire
[1:32:59] right up to the border
[1:33:03] but what they saw on the other side of
[1:33:05] the border caused fear
[1:33:08] sin unbelief we can't possibly do
[1:33:12] this what did that fear lead to
[1:33:17] disobedience and wha how did what
[1:33:20] happened
[1:33:20] as a result of that it led to a detour
[1:33:24] a 40-year delay yet god's timing is
[1:33:27] perfect
[1:33:30] we saw in our little study of exodus and
[1:33:32] joseph the signs in the heavens that
[1:33:34] anchored him in time we know when this
[1:33:35] happened
[1:33:36] the natural typing the spiritual
[1:33:39] but what about that time of disobedience
[1:33:41] in the wilderness
[1:33:44] how to survive what appeared to be a
[1:33:47] sentence of certain death all their
[1:33:49] picnic baskets from egypt were empty
[1:33:52] you're going out into that desert
[1:33:53] there's a lot of you and there's nothing
[1:33:55] there to support you
[1:33:57] moses are you taking us out here to die
[1:34:01] a large group is not going to survive in
[1:34:04] that bleak inhospitable land
[1:34:06] i've i've seen some of the sinai um
[1:34:09] i'll tell you what you want to jump
[1:34:11] right back in your air-conditioned
[1:34:12] vehicle
[1:34:14] well what did the lord do they were
[1:34:16] disobedient
[1:34:18] he was upset he was angry
[1:34:22] but they were still his children
[1:34:26] so what did he do he took care of them
[1:34:30] their shoes didn't wear out i'd like a
[1:34:32] pair of shoes like that
[1:34:34] their clothes that ultraviolet sun and
[1:34:37] all that stuff beating on them but the
[1:34:39] clothes blasted everything right
[1:34:42] and he fed them manna
[1:34:47] where did it come from this man and this
[1:34:49] food they've never seen
[1:34:52] it came from the heavens right like dew
[1:34:54] they found that on the ground in the
[1:34:55] morning
[1:34:56] the heavens shamayim what is that the
[1:34:59] hebrew word is like
[1:35:00] the greek word pneuma it's the hebrew
[1:35:02] word for atmosphere
[1:35:03] type of the spirit look
[1:35:08] john 20 this is after the resurrection
[1:35:12] before the ascension
[1:35:13] when he had said this he was having a
[1:35:15] little chat with him
[1:35:16] he breathed on them
[1:35:20] and said unto them
[1:35:24] receive the holy ghost pneuma
[1:35:28] air breath spirit
[1:35:31] and in the desert where did they get the
[1:35:34] water
[1:35:35] from the rock the revelation of jesus
[1:35:39] christ right
[1:35:40] faith we have all we need in christ
[1:35:44] that's what sustained them in the
[1:35:46] wilderness even though they were
[1:35:47] disobedient
[1:35:49] even when i'm disobedient he still looks
[1:35:53] after me
[1:35:54] he still takes care of me because it may
[1:35:56] break our
[1:35:58] connection but i'm still his
[1:36:01] child you can't get warm
[1:36:04] by a painted fire we've heard that many
[1:36:07] times
[1:36:08] my brother my sister you must receive
[1:36:12] the holy spirit not
[1:36:15] think you have it not imitate it
[1:36:18] you have to receive it it's not it's not
[1:36:21] optional
[1:36:23] and you can't earn it there's nothing
[1:36:24] you can do
[1:36:27] to say to god i've done this
[1:36:30] give me the holy spirit it's a free gift
[1:36:34] and he offers it to you and he wants to
[1:36:36] give it to you don't
[1:36:38] make it complicated
[1:36:43] another instance here what this is much
[1:36:45] earlier in jesus ministry he's he's in
[1:36:47] his home district up in the
[1:36:49] the north of galilee there when jesus
[1:36:51] departed thence
[1:36:53] two blind men followed him crying
[1:36:56] and saying thou son of david
[1:36:59] have mercy on us a son of david
[1:37:03] have mercy on us son of david have have
[1:37:06] mercy on us
[1:37:08] he just kept walking when he was coming
[1:37:11] to the house
[1:37:12] the blind men came to him he kept
[1:37:15] walking they kept following
[1:37:18] jesus said unto them
[1:37:21] believe ye that i'm able to do this
[1:37:27] they said unto him yay lord
[1:37:30] they're crying for mercy they're going
[1:37:32] to receive healing
[1:37:37] then he touched their eyes saying okay
[1:37:41] now based on your obedience
[1:37:44] no he didn't say that based on your good
[1:37:47] works
[1:37:48] your good intentions your hope
[1:37:52] your wish your desire
[1:37:55] your expression of need
[1:37:59] your financial support no
[1:38:03] no yes do you believe do you accept
[1:38:06] completely
[1:38:07] even if you understand incompletely
[1:38:10] that i can do this
[1:38:13] because i can't it won't happen unless
[1:38:17] you
[1:38:17] accept that i can so
[1:38:20] what did he say according to your
[1:38:24] faith be it unto you
[1:38:28] according to your faith they had faith
[1:38:30] before
[1:38:32] they had their healing they didn't get
[1:38:35] faith because
[1:38:36] they were healed right faith is a gift
[1:38:41] it's also a fruit in other words
[1:38:44] if it's a fruit it has life and it can
[1:38:47] grow in the right soil we heard about
[1:38:49] rocky soil this morning in good soil
[1:38:51] right it can grow in the right soil
[1:38:55] and the right atmosphere
[1:38:58] and reproduce itself right fruit has
[1:39:01] seeds
[1:39:03] and we eat fruit to live
[1:39:06] and to grow
[1:39:10] ephesians chapter 2 for by grace
[1:39:15] are you saved through faith
[1:39:19] and that not of yourselves it's a gift
[1:39:21] of god
[1:39:23] it's a gift you really don't have much
[1:39:27] to do with it
[1:39:29] what does galatians 5 tell us
[1:39:32] but the fruit of the spirit is
[1:39:36] love joy peace
[1:39:40] long suffering gentleness
[1:39:44] goodness faith
[1:39:48] meekness temperance
[1:39:51] the fruit of the spirit includes
[1:39:55] faith christianity we've heard it so
[1:39:59] many times and it is so true
[1:40:00] is relationship it's not religion though
[1:40:03] there are many religions that
[1:40:05] fall under the label of christianity
[1:40:08] just
[1:40:08] as there are similar parallel
[1:40:11] philosophies and so forth be a good
[1:40:13] person
[1:40:14] and it'll be okay
[1:40:17] fruit fruit that you bear fruit isn't
[1:40:20] what you do
[1:40:23] it's a seed it shows what you are
[1:40:27] note the list in galatians is singular
[1:40:30] it says
[1:40:31] the fruit is it doesn't say the fruits
[1:40:34] of the spirit
[1:40:35] are here's this list pick three
[1:40:39] it's one fruit that has all
[1:40:44] all of these attributes
[1:40:47] brother reg searled heather and i uh
[1:40:50] traveled to new zealand back just after
[1:40:52] we were first married our oldest son was
[1:40:54] was born over there and fortunately
[1:40:57] airplanes were still flying because he
[1:40:58] was 18 days old when we flew back from
[1:41:01] new zealand to tucson but brother reg
[1:41:04] searle when we were in new zealand he
[1:41:05] told us
[1:41:06] an apple tree does not struggle
[1:41:10] to bear apples it bears apples
[1:41:14] because it's an apple tree
[1:41:17] and being in new zealand of course he
[1:41:19] says a sheep doesn't struggle to bear
[1:41:21] wool
[1:41:22] it bears wool because it's a sheep
[1:41:26] the fruit you bear reveals the life
[1:41:29] that's in you john 15
[1:41:33] herein is my father glorified
[1:41:37] that you bear much fruit so shall you be
[1:41:41] my disciples
[1:41:43] as the father hath loved me so have i
[1:41:46] loved you
[1:41:48] continue in my love
[1:41:52] if oh uh oh if
[1:41:55] if means there's a condition if
[1:41:58] you keep my commandments
[1:42:02] you shall abide in my love even as i
[1:42:05] have kept my father's commandments and
[1:42:07] abide in
[1:42:08] his love these things have i spoken unto
[1:42:11] you
[1:42:12] that my joy might remain in you and that
[1:42:14] your joy
[1:42:16] might be full this is my commandment
[1:42:20] okay here's the condition we have to
[1:42:22] fulfill
[1:42:24] love one another as i have loved you
[1:42:30] greater love hath no man than this that
[1:42:33] a man lay down his life for his friends
[1:42:36] and you're my friends if there's that
[1:42:39] conditional again
[1:42:41] this friendship there's a condition
[1:42:44] you can be friends with someone
[1:42:46] something happens your friendship
[1:42:49] stops you go from being best friends
[1:42:51] forever
[1:42:52] i don't like that person right but it
[1:42:54] can be restored
[1:42:57] and it often is you're my friends if
[1:43:01] you do whatsoever i command you
[1:43:06] henceforth jesus goes on i call you not
[1:43:09] servants for the servant knoweth not
[1:43:10] what his lord doeth
[1:43:12] but i've called you friends for all
[1:43:14] things that i have heard of my father i
[1:43:16] have made known
[1:43:17] unto you you have not chosen me
[1:43:22] peter you didn't come running from your
[1:43:23] boat and say hey get on my crew we're
[1:43:25] catching a lot of fish out here we need
[1:43:27] a little help
[1:43:28] no no no but i've chosen you
[1:43:32] and ordained you that you should go out
[1:43:36] and
[1:43:37] collect a big offering build a giant
[1:43:40] cathedral
[1:43:41] graduate from a well-regarded seminary
[1:43:45] wear special clothes to identify you
[1:43:48] no no i have chosen you and ordained you
[1:43:52] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[1:43:57] and that your fruit should remain keep
[1:43:59] bearing it don't stop
[1:44:01] that whatsoever ye shall ask of my
[1:44:04] father my name he may give it you
[1:44:06] why because it will be me asking
[1:44:09] through you it won't be oh i'd like a
[1:44:12] new car
[1:44:13] i don't no no no no of course he doesn't
[1:44:15] answer those kinds of things
[1:44:17] because that's not his desire
[1:44:21] these things i command you here it is
[1:44:23] again
[1:44:24] it's simple that you love
[1:44:28] one another that's his commandment to us
[1:44:32] to love each other do we love each other
[1:44:38] do you love him jesus said in john 14
[1:44:42] if you love me you say you love me
[1:44:44] here's how i'm going to test you
[1:44:46] keep my commandments that's how we
[1:44:49] demonstrate
[1:44:51] our love for him and i will pray the
[1:44:54] father
[1:44:55] and he shall give you another comforter
[1:44:58] that he may abide with you forever even
[1:45:00] the spirit of truth which the world
[1:45:04] cannot receive
[1:45:09] why can't the world receive the spirit
[1:45:13] of truth
[1:45:14] the holy spirit because it seeth him not
[1:45:18] it doesn't understand him
[1:45:20] neither knoweth him there's no
[1:45:22] relationship
[1:45:23] but you know him
[1:45:26] for he dwelleth with you it's me jesus
[1:45:29] i'm talking to you
[1:45:31] i'm dwelling with you it's me and shall
[1:45:34] be
[1:45:35] in you the same spirit
[1:45:38] that will raise christ from the dead
[1:45:40] will dwell in you
[1:45:42] i will not leave you comfortless
[1:45:47] i will come to you
[1:45:50] he didn't say that i'm going to rescue
[1:45:52] you i'm going to
[1:45:54] comfort you when you go through tough
[1:45:56] times with
[1:45:57] someone you build bonds you build
[1:46:00] relationship
[1:46:01] it gets stronger and stronger and the
[1:46:03] tougher the times
[1:46:04] and the more difficult it is the
[1:46:07] stronger the bond the friendship the
[1:46:09] relationship grows
[1:46:11] my brother my sister the comforter
[1:46:14] means you can expect some trouble
[1:46:18] rejoice because that's going to drive
[1:46:21] you
[1:46:22] closer into his arms i think of that
[1:46:25] song
[1:46:25] i'm so thankful for the open arms of
[1:46:27] jesus
[1:46:28] i'm so glad that i can find my comfort
[1:46:31] there when the storm clouds gather over
[1:46:33] yonder
[1:46:34] i can find my shelter in the lord right
[1:46:38] where was i here i got i got off of this
[1:46:40] yet a little while the world sees me no
[1:46:42] more but you see me because i live
[1:46:45] you shall live also because my life
[1:46:48] will be in you and that day what day
[1:46:52] the day that you receive me as the
[1:46:54] comforter is the holy spirit
[1:46:57] and that day ye shall know because
[1:47:00] you'll experience it you shall know
[1:47:02] that i am in the father and you're in me
[1:47:04] and i'm in you
[1:47:05] we're all in this together
[1:47:09] with god he that hath my commandments
[1:47:14] and keepeth them he it is it loveth me
[1:47:17] and he that loveth me shall be loved of
[1:47:19] my father
[1:47:20] and i will love him and will manifest
[1:47:23] myself
[1:47:24] to him it's pretty important
[1:47:28] to keep that commandment and that
[1:47:31] commandment love
[1:47:33] it's relational you don't go in a corner
[1:47:35] someplace close the door
[1:47:37] say oh i'm in love with the world huh no
[1:47:41] love is relational heather and i have a
[1:47:43] relationship and it's growing
[1:47:45] i love her more now than i ever did and
[1:47:47] tomorrow i'll love her more than i love
[1:47:49] her today
[1:47:50] anybody that knows her can understand
[1:47:52] why
[1:47:53] so let me repeat christianity
[1:47:56] it's about relationship it's not
[1:47:59] religion
[1:48:01] and you want a little surprise so was
[1:48:03] judaism
[1:48:05] look matthew 22 master this fellow comes
[1:48:08] and asks him
[1:48:09] master what is the great commandment in
[1:48:11] the law
[1:48:14] jesus said wait i'll go check my
[1:48:16] concordance i've got
[1:48:18] to fire up my computer and do a word
[1:48:19] search on that
[1:48:21] no no jesus said unto him he didn't wait
[1:48:24] thou shall love the lord thy god with
[1:48:27] all thy heart
[1:48:28] with all thy soul with all thy mind this
[1:48:30] is the first
[1:48:32] and great commandment but you know what
[1:48:35] he didn't stop there he went past what
[1:48:38] was asked
[1:48:39] because he wanted to get to the heart of
[1:48:41] the matter and he said
[1:48:42] the second it's just like it you shall
[1:48:45] love your
[1:48:46] neighbor as yourself
[1:48:49] on these two commandments
[1:48:52] not ten these two
[1:48:56] what are they love on these two
[1:49:00] commandments hang all
[1:49:03] the law and the prophets all
[1:49:07] the law all the commandments the 613
[1:49:11] regulations and whatever and so on and
[1:49:13] wearing that shawl
[1:49:14] with the little fringes and blowing the
[1:49:16] shofar and all of that
[1:49:19] all of the prophetic revelations
[1:49:23] all of the teachings
[1:49:26] a l l
[1:49:30] it all reduces down to loving god
[1:49:34] and loving your neighbor
[1:49:38] how how complicated is that
[1:49:43] now now consider something jesus gives
[1:49:46] us some illustrations here
[1:49:47] when he talks about judgment what
[1:49:50] happens if we don't enter into that
[1:49:51] relationship with him and
[1:49:53] forgiveness of our fellow man
[1:49:57] matthew 7 not everyone
[1:50:01] that saith unto me lord lord
[1:50:05] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:50:08] even though
[1:50:09] they recognize me as their lord
[1:50:12] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:50:15] which is in heaven
[1:50:17] and we've just gone over that that's to
[1:50:19] love
[1:50:20] right many uh oh
[1:50:23] many will say to me in that day
[1:50:26] lord lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:50:30] name
[1:50:31] and in thy name of cast out devils and
[1:50:34] and in the name of many
[1:50:35] wonderful works they did good things
[1:50:39] they did wonderful things they helped
[1:50:41] people
[1:50:43] they did it all in the name of jesus
[1:50:47] what could be wrong with that
[1:50:52] then i will profess to them
[1:50:55] i never knew you depart for me that work
[1:50:59] iniquity
[1:51:00] work inequity what
[1:51:04] what went wrong
[1:51:08] they did not have a relationship
[1:51:11] with jesus i never knew you of course
[1:51:13] jesus knew of them
[1:51:15] but he didn't know them they had never
[1:51:18] been through hard times together there
[1:51:20] was no relationship there was no bond
[1:51:24] he was not intimate with them he
[1:51:28] was a tool in their toolbox
[1:51:32] not the love of their life brother
[1:51:33] branham talks about this when he talks
[1:51:35] about anointed ones at the end time
[1:51:37] look at their list of works and
[1:51:39] accomplishments that
[1:51:40] their fruit lord lord
[1:51:43] have not we prophesied in thy name
[1:51:48] and in thy name we have cast out devils
[1:51:52] and in thy name we have done
[1:51:55] many wonderful works it's all about them
[1:51:59] it wasn't what they did
[1:52:01] it was why they did it they did it
[1:52:05] for their own glory brother branham
[1:52:06] warns us about this and anointed ones at
[1:52:08] the end times
[1:52:10] and we're told if you try to evaluate
[1:52:13] whether or not you should do something
[1:52:16] told to check your motive and check your
[1:52:19] objective
[1:52:20] it's not what it's why
[1:52:24] okay closing out the musicians would
[1:52:27] would please come
[1:52:29] here's another story of judgment
[1:52:36] then shall the king say unto them on his
[1:52:39] right hand
[1:52:41] come ye blessed of my father
[1:52:44] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[1:52:46] from the foundation of the world
[1:52:48] you're finally here i knew you were
[1:52:51] coming i'm so
[1:52:52] glad you've got here i've been busy
[1:52:55] getting things ready for your arrival
[1:52:57] look look look brother there's your name
[1:53:00] tag on the door
[1:53:02] i'm so glad you're here now and and you
[1:53:05] were so nice to me
[1:53:08] do you remember when i was hungry and
[1:53:10] you gave me food
[1:53:12] i was thirsty and you gave me drink
[1:53:16] i was a stranger you took me in i was
[1:53:19] naked but
[1:53:20] you clothed me i was sick
[1:53:23] you visited me i was in prison yeah yeah
[1:53:26] you you came to me and what's their
[1:53:29] reaction
[1:53:31] they weren't out self-promoting they
[1:53:34] weren't self-righteous
[1:53:36] then so the righteous answer him saying
[1:53:38] yeah yeah
[1:53:39] we did all that in the name of jesus no
[1:53:43] no no they're puzzled they're puzzled
[1:53:47] they say
[1:53:47] lord when did we
[1:53:51] did you did you
[1:53:55] when did we see you hungry and fed you
[1:53:58] were thirsty and gave you a drinker
[1:54:00] when did we see you a stranger took you
[1:54:02] in or naked and clothed you
[1:54:04] or when did we see you sick or in prison
[1:54:06] and come unto you
[1:54:09] none of us remember anything like that
[1:54:11] do you remember
[1:54:12] do you remember no i i
[1:54:15] don't remember either and the king shall
[1:54:19] answer
[1:54:20] and say unto them calm down
[1:54:24] it's okay verily i say unto you inasmuch
[1:54:28] as ye have done it unto one of these the
[1:54:30] least of my brethren
[1:54:32] you've done it unto me because a part of
[1:54:36] me
[1:54:37] lives in each of them and
[1:54:40] in you we have to be careful
[1:54:44] how we treat one another and i don't
[1:54:46] just mean here in church
[1:54:48] i mean our fellow human beings here on
[1:54:50] spaceship earth
[1:54:51] our final verses for this evening in
[1:54:53] hebrews paul admonishes us
[1:54:56] let brotherly love continue
[1:54:59] be not forgetful to entertain strangers
[1:55:04] for thereby some have entertained angels
[1:55:07] unawares that guy in the street corner
[1:55:12] he might be one of those dirty twenty
[1:55:13] dollar bills
[1:55:16] it's all about that fruit how useful is
[1:55:19] fruit that rots on the branch of the
[1:55:21] vine
[1:55:22] or the tree bearing fruits necessary
[1:55:25] bearing fruits important and bearing
[1:55:27] food is inevitable
[1:55:29] if you have any life but it has to be
[1:55:33] harvested
[1:55:34] to be useful it has to be eaten it has
[1:55:37] to be consumed
[1:55:38] to give strength and satisfy hunger
[1:55:41] the lamp it has to be lit it has to be
[1:55:44] placed where it's light can be seen
[1:55:46] otherwise it
[1:55:47] might as well be made of plastic or wax
[1:55:49] or something
[1:55:51] it's just to be viewed admired commented
[1:55:53] on look at that perfect piece of fruit
[1:55:55] yeah
[1:55:55] it's wax have you ever been to costco
[1:56:00] or sam's club there is at least there
[1:56:02] was often a kiosk with someone handing
[1:56:04] out a taste
[1:56:05] right of a small free sample of some
[1:56:08] food or drink no charge you're
[1:56:11] encouraged
[1:56:13] partake and if you like it we've got
[1:56:16] shelves full of it here to sell to you
[1:56:17] right so my question tonight
[1:56:21] if someone takes a free sample of the
[1:56:24] fruit
[1:56:25] that you're bearing or the fruit that
[1:56:27] i'm bearing
[1:56:29] they come and take that free sample are
[1:56:31] they going to want to go to the shelf
[1:56:33] and load up on it
[1:56:36] are our lamps lit and burning bright
[1:56:41] there's a lot more we could say but i've
[1:56:42] kept it long enough
[1:56:44] i uh i wonder if we could just pray for
[1:56:46] a moment
[1:56:47] and then sing a song and then turn the
[1:56:51] service over to our pastor
[1:56:53] just join me in prayer for a moment lord
[1:56:55] jesus
[1:56:58] these words tonight lord

[1:57:03] to some of us
[1:57:05] lord i believe you were speaking to me
[1:57:09] lord i just pray that you help us each
[1:57:11] one lord to
[1:57:12] recognize that our worth our value
[1:57:16] is established by you it's not what we
[1:57:18] see it's not what we think about
[1:57:20] ourselves
[1:57:21] it's what you see in us it's what you've
[1:57:23] placed in us
[1:57:24] lord help us to manifest that to to
[1:57:27] water it
[1:57:28] that it can grow lord help us to bear
[1:57:30] fruit for you

[2:01:47] handclap of praise
[2:01:49] hallelujah thank you jesus
[2:01:52] [Applause]
[2:01:53] my that was so much said i
[2:01:56] just i can't imagine a lie you said you
[2:01:58] had a couple days to prepare for that my
[2:02:00] you should start only preparing two days
[2:02:02] from now on
[2:02:04] that was so good oh man i i just so much
[2:02:07] that he
[2:02:08] said uh that i wish i would have written
[2:02:10] down things to comment on but
[2:02:12] it's amazing because i just studied not
[2:02:15] ever knowing what the jewish new year
[2:02:17] was
[2:02:17] i just studied on that uh the day before
[2:02:19] yesterday and about the shofar and the
[2:02:21] blowing of the trumpets and
[2:02:23] how that it's the feast of the trumpets
[2:02:25] i just when i seen this i got to the
[2:02:26] platform and seen this i said i think i
[2:02:28] know where he's going
[2:02:31] but it was so good you know because that
[2:02:33] that even that
[2:02:34] i was reading about that i forget what
[2:02:36] you called it brother what they call it
[2:02:37] brother
[2:02:38] where they take the bread and they stand
[2:02:40] by the water and they throw it on the on
[2:02:42] the water
[2:02:42] as a removal of sins and and you know
[2:02:45] how
[2:02:46] that he would he read the scripture and
[2:02:47] micah where they based that off of that
[2:02:49] he would cast it well the bible says he
[2:02:51] cast our sin into the sea of his
[2:02:52] forgetfulness
[2:02:54] and he put a sign there that said no
[2:02:56] fishing
[2:02:56] [Laughter]
[2:02:59] amen i'm glad that when the lord doesn't
[2:03:01] just forgive we forgive but the lord
[2:03:03] forgives
[2:03:04] and he forgets amen and he is the light
[2:03:08] of the world mine
[2:03:09] so much said there you know but the law
[2:03:12] would have never thought of that
[2:03:14] my mind not being your scientific mind
[2:03:17] uh
[2:03:17] never never seen that so beautiful how
[2:03:20] that light is in two parts it's photons
[2:03:23] it's
[2:03:23] particles and it's waves and how that
[2:03:26] jesus could have two natures and
[2:03:28] you know it people preaching you know
[2:03:30] they've they preached
[2:03:31] you know doctrines and have been not
[2:03:33] according to the word on two souls and
[2:03:35] you know how many souls do we have the
[2:03:37] soul but it's real simple when you look
[2:03:39] at jesus because see we're a type we're
[2:03:41] going to be in his very image we were
[2:03:43] created in his image
[2:03:44] that we could be a hundred percent flesh
[2:03:47] and yet we could have that eternal god
[2:03:50] living down inside of us
[2:03:51] and brother adam said even if you just
[2:03:53] he said you know he said we we may just
[2:03:55] be a portion
[2:03:57] he was the fullness the bible says in
[2:03:59] him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[2:04:01] in a body bodily and brother branham
[2:04:03] says but you know if you take just a
[2:04:05] teaspoon of the ocean
[2:04:06] and he said you just take a little
[2:04:08] teaspoon he said yet within that little
[2:04:09] teaspoon i've got every
[2:04:11] element that's in all that big old seed
[2:04:13] and he said when you received the
[2:04:14] baptism of the holy ghost he said what
[2:04:16] are you receiving
[2:04:17] a down payment a down payment
[2:04:21] you know what that means if he's going
[2:04:23] to make a down payment the rest is
[2:04:25] coming
[2:04:26] the rest is on its way that's why he
[2:04:28] quoted uh genesis 17
[2:04:30] uh abraham walk before me and be thou
[2:04:33] perfect
[2:04:34] you know what i see there god would have
[2:04:36] never asked
[2:04:38] abraham to to be perfect unless god knew
[2:04:42] it was possible you ever thought of that
[2:04:46] that the bible says he was
[2:04:47] 99 years old you know he was 90 here he
[2:04:51] spent
[2:04:51] i just thought that's not an accident
[2:04:53] that he's 99 years old
[2:04:54] it's he's 99 gone
[2:04:59] 99 when you're 99 and it looks like all
[2:05:02] hope is lost
[2:05:03] 99 god shows up on the scene and says
[2:05:06] walk before me and be thou perfect gives
[2:05:08] him a promise
[2:05:10] hallelujah and when we think it's all
[2:05:12] over and it's hopeless 99
[2:05:14] gone and the lord shows up just on time
[2:05:18] every time amen i want to say tonight
[2:05:20] lord let
[2:05:21] my as jesus said let your light so
[2:05:24] shine before men that they see your good
[2:05:28] works and they
[2:05:29] glorify your father say lord let my
[2:05:32] light
[2:05:32] so shine let my life so shine
[2:05:36] amen in this dark and dying world
[2:05:39] praise the lord amen i want to sing this
[2:05:42] before we go we're going to let you be
[2:05:43] dismissed

[2:05:46] on that i believe it was for somebody
