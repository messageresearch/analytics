[53:22] called by thy name to take away our
[53:26] approach I'd like you to turn also let
[53:29] me just find uh my scripture here I'd
[53:32] like you to turn also to Revelations
[53:34] chapter 21 and verse 9 we'll just read
[53:37] that and have you be seated Revelations
[53:39] chapter
[53:43] 21 just one real familiar scripture this
[53:48] morning Revelations 21 verse
[53:52] 9 and there came unto me one of the
[53:55] seven angels angs which had the seven
[53:58] vials full of the seven last plagues and
[54:01] talked with me saying come hither I will
[54:04] show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife
[54:08] Heavenly Father we're grateful to be
[54:10] called your children Lord to be elected
[54:13] in this late hour that we live in Lord
[54:16] we know that we see a world that's
[54:18] groping in darkness Lord for it's
[54:20] prophetic it's prophesied that that in
[54:23] this generation it would be an age of
[54:25] not just dark Darkness Lord but the
[54:28] Bible uses the word a gross darkness and
[54:31] we know that that gross Lord is a it's a
[54:34] way of measurement Lord It's like a
[54:36] pound or a weight and it would be it
[54:39] would be a gross which would be a
[54:41] thousand times darker than the darkest
[54:43] cave and Lord It's encroaching all
[54:45] around us it's pressing in father daily
[54:48] as we see the world going rapidly
[54:51] declining Lord but we're grateful today
[54:54] that we've received a light in the
[54:56] evening time for you said there shall be
[54:59] light in the darkest hour Lord and that
[55:02] light is causing us Lord to a life of
[55:04] Ascension not descending Lord with the
[55:07] world in chaos Lord but our message is
[55:09] Shalom and we're thankful for that this
[55:12] morning we speak it this morning we
[55:14] receive it Lord this morning I pray God
[55:16] that you would be in this service Lord
[55:18] for all that you've intended for it to
[55:20] be may we just pull on the word of God
[55:23] from our hungry Hearts we ask in Jesus
[55:26] Christ Christ's name and the church said
[55:29] amen you can be seated this morning
[55:31] Revelations 19:7 I'm going to read just
[55:34] a few scriptures here as we begin to go
[55:36] through this and like I said I've got a
[55:38] PowerPoint uh Brothers you can display
[55:42] whenever uh you'd like to we've got just
[55:44] so much here and and we may not get to
[55:47] it just for a moment Lord willing will
[55:49] get to it um before the before this
[55:52] service is over we know these scriptures
[55:54] very well and what we identify in the
[55:58] Bible is this Revelations 19:7 is
[56:03] identifying uh a a special group of
[56:06] people an elected group of people the
[56:09] Bible says in Revelations 19:7 let us be
[56:12] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[56:15] for the marriage of the Lamb is come and
[56:19] his wife hath made herself ready so what
[56:23] we find from the study of the word today
[56:26] is we could we could take many the Bible
[56:30] the uh speaks to many uh we we could say
[56:34] the Bible speaks specifically to many
[56:38] different subjects and a sermon could be
[56:41] upon any subject you could preach upon
[56:43] just uh uh it would you would you would
[56:46] never run out of subjects to minister on
[56:49] uh the Bible speaks of many different
[56:51] eras or ages or times uh the scripture
[56:55] uh speaks to certain groups of people
[56:57] very specific we know that the Bible
[57:00] speaks of Christ and we he also it also
[57:03] speaks of the Antichrist uh the Bible
[57:06] speaks of a True Vine and it also speaks
[57:09] of a false Vine uh it speaks of a
[57:12] beginning and it speaks of an end it
[57:14] speaks of an alpha and it speaks of an
[57:18] Omega uh and and we see the fruits of an
[57:21] evil uh a wicked one and the Bible also
[57:25] speaks of the fruit roots of the
[57:27] righteous one but ultimately out of all
[57:30] of the themes that you could find in the
[57:32] Bible you could preach on many different
[57:35] themes and the Bible has many themes
[57:38] that you can speak on and all of it is
[57:40] the truth and all of it has an
[57:43] application in fact there are certain
[57:45] things written in the word that doesn't
[57:48] apply at all to you or to me there are
[57:51] certain things that the Bible speaks of
[57:54] the tribulation uh that does doesn't
[57:56] apply to you thank thankful to God for
[57:59] that there are things that speaks about
[58:01] the vials and the plagues that doesn't
[58:03] apply to the Bride of Jesus Christ can
[58:06] you say Amen this morning stay right
[58:08] with me we're going to lay a foundation
[58:10] here so I just need you to stay focus
[58:12] because you I'll lose you uh in the
[58:14] middle if if I don't have you here at
[58:16] the beginning but it it it speaks
[58:19] specifically of certain times speaks of
[58:22] the Jews and Jacob's trouble and we know
[58:24] that would apply amen to a time when the
[58:27] bride is already gone but the bi the
[58:29] Bible has many things to say as the
[58:32] prophet of God in the church age book
[58:34] begins to speak about the two Vines and
[58:36] he says now the spirit speaks to both it
[58:40] speaks to the false Vine and it speaks
[58:43] to the True Vine we know brother brandom
[58:45] told us that the Bible has compound
[58:47] meanings it it speaks very literally of
[58:51] a Jonah who very literally went into the
[58:53] belly of a large fish and and and he and
[58:56] he was he was in the belly of that fish
[58:58] and and and we know the story of Jonah
[59:00] it was a literal man a real man a man
[59:03] who really
[59:05] lived very despite in spite of whatever
[59:08] modern science tells you that it's
[59:09] impossible for there to have been a well
[59:12] uh fish large enough to swallow a man
[59:15] and for the man to have uh gone through
[59:17] what he went through and they say it has
[59:18] to be allegory it has to be you know has
[59:21] to be a parable what brother bam said he
[59:23] was a very real man it was a very real
[59:26] fish who the Bible says God prepared for
[59:31] Jonah like brother Bram tells the little
[59:33] girl who says you know uh says you know
[59:36] I can't believe you believe in that
[59:37] story of Jonah little girl says well she
[59:39] he she says I do and he says what are
[59:41] you what are you going to do if you get
[59:42] to heaven and you and you find and you
[59:44] and he says uh and and you know and you
[59:46] you don't see Jonah she he says what are
[59:48] you g to ask him he says what if he's
[59:49] not there and she says well I guess
[59:51] you'll have to ask him for yourself then
[59:54] so he was a very real man it was a very
[59:56] real story but yet Jonah's life was
[1:00:00] actually greater a greater mystery of
[1:00:03] what happened to Jonah would be revealed
[1:00:06] in Christ for the Jesus quotes that and
[1:00:10] says there will be no sign given to you
[1:00:12] except that of Jonas who just as Jonah
[1:00:17] was in the belly of a well three days
[1:00:19] three nights so shall the son of man go
[1:00:21] into the heart of the earth and so we
[1:00:24] know just as a type that script had a
[1:00:26] compound meaning it had a compound uh it
[1:00:29] was it was brother brandom said it this
[1:00:31] way says that it's it's like a a Roman
[1:00:33] candle and he said it's like you know
[1:00:35] the firework of a Roman candle and he
[1:00:37] says each light that goes out gets
[1:00:39] brighter it's a different color but it
[1:00:41] all comes from the same source and he
[1:00:44] says just as a Roman Candle explodes in
[1:00:47] more Mysteries he said so this seven
[1:00:49] sealed book reveals and opens itself up
[1:00:53] and it and it just it it it it unveils
[1:00:55] it self before our
[1:00:57] eyes and brother brandham goes on
[1:00:59] further and and you see the Bible speaks
[1:01:02] of Christ and it says of his kingdom
[1:01:05] speaking of the kingdom of Christ there
[1:01:07] shall be no end and the scripture says
[1:01:10] in other words you know as humans we
[1:01:12] think of Heaven that well that's it
[1:01:14] that's the Finish Line no brother that's
[1:01:16] just the
[1:01:17] beginning we think of the finality of
[1:01:20] all of life will be consummated all and
[1:01:22] it'll be everything will be swallowed up
[1:01:24] and and and and everything will be
[1:01:26] finished but the Bible says his kingdom
[1:01:28] shall have no end and brother bham says
[1:01:31] he'll continue to reveal himself through
[1:01:33] the ceaseless ages to come now that
[1:01:36] blows the mind of theologians up but a
[1:01:38] seventh grade Kentucky hillbilly uh uh
[1:01:41] who had Revelation from God not theology
[1:01:44] from man said his kingdom shall never
[1:01:47] end so it's compound it's ever
[1:01:52] unfolding it's ever you're ever growing
[1:01:56] you're you're always expanding I love
[1:01:59] that and the Bible so we know that
[1:02:02] ultimately out of all the themes that
[1:02:04] the scripture speaks about there is one
[1:02:07] subject there there there is there is
[1:02:09] one subject that comes through very
[1:02:12] clear and that's
[1:02:16] marriage in fact the Bible
[1:02:18] starts with marriage starts as a book of
[1:02:22] marriage the Bible speaks of this first
[1:02:24] couple and I want you to keep that in
[1:02:26] your mind as we know as we uh spent just
[1:02:29] a minute to show you that all of these
[1:02:30] things are compound meaning they would
[1:02:32] all have a a fulfillment in in their in
[1:02:35] the in the literal sense but they would
[1:02:38] have a greater fulfillment in Pro
[1:02:40] prophetically so God's thoughts and his
[1:02:43] plans all of his plans and all of his
[1:02:45] thoughts are expressed throughout the
[1:02:47] Bible and we see here in the book of
[1:02:49] geneses it speaks of the position of man
[1:02:53] in the beginning and Adam un had a key
[1:02:56] it was a the the mystery of Adam uh
[1:02:59] within Adam within that first Son of God
[1:03:02] held the mystery to all sons of God that
[1:03:04] would ever be uh the original position
[1:03:07] the original uh Authority the original
[1:03:10] calling the original placing was Adam
[1:03:14] who was a God who was the god of heaven
[1:03:17] and brother random says but Adam was the
[1:03:19] god of the
[1:03:20] earth you you you believe that you know
[1:03:22] that here this morning and so the all of
[1:03:26] this the scripture speaks of this this
[1:03:28] book of Genesis we know it's it's a book
[1:03:31] of seeds brother bam called it that he
[1:03:33] said it's was a book of
[1:03:34] Beginnings in the beginning it starts
[1:03:38] but that would be a type that it was uh
[1:03:40] it was the beginning it was the alpha it
[1:03:42] was the original it was the book of
[1:03:47] Origins are you
[1:03:49] here and so what happened in the
[1:03:53] beginning what do you have you have Adam
[1:03:55] you have Eve you have an an Eden a
[1:03:58] presence an atmosphere a kingdom you
[1:04:01] have a husband you have a wife you have
[1:04:05] unity and and you have a you have an an
[1:04:08] atmosphere in Eden that's perfect and so
[1:04:11] what happens in the beginning of seeds
[1:04:13] the or the the book of Origins holds the
[1:04:17] answer to the mystery of the Bride of
[1:04:19] Jesus Christ because the Bible connects
[1:04:22] the first Adam to the second Adam and we
[1:04:26] know if there was a first and a second
[1:04:27] Adam who was Christ then there's got to
[1:04:29] be a first Eve and then a second
[1:04:32] Eve and the scripture identifies this
[1:04:35] bride throughout all of its stories and
[1:04:38] all of its themes and all of its
[1:04:39] Parables and all of the all of the major
[1:04:42] types you could find running in the
[1:04:44] Bible You'll Always Find this theme of
[1:04:46] God a husband and a bride a
[1:04:50] wife we're speaking on bride character
[1:04:53] this morning so the first one woman was
[1:04:56] made the Bible says uh the second Adam
[1:05:00] uh or the first woman was made for this
[1:05:02] first Adam now I want you to to to read
[1:05:04] this here in 1 Corinthians 11 don't try
[1:05:06] to turn because I'm going to go through
[1:05:07] these too quickly Brothers you're
[1:05:09] welcome to take it down and put it up 1
[1:05:11] Corinthians chapter 11 uh verse 8 I'll
[1:05:14] try to not be such a machine gun this
[1:05:16] morning with these give you a minute to
[1:05:18] get them amen and so it says here in 1
[1:05:21] Corinthians 11:8 notice for the man is
[1:05:25] not of the woman now I want you to you
[1:05:27] could think literally of a husband and
[1:05:29] wife you could think of a man and a
[1:05:31] woman but I want you to to think bigger
[1:05:32] than that here this morning for the man
[1:05:35] is not of the woman but the woman of the
[1:05:37] man neither was the Man created for the
[1:05:40] woman but the woman for the man now she
[1:05:45] was brother bam says she wasn't made
[1:05:48] from outside
[1:05:49] material he says when he when he forms
[1:05:52] Adam he takes from the dust of the earth
[1:05:54] and he and he gets a lump of clay and he
[1:05:56] begins to to form the first man and the
[1:06:00] great Potter the great architect the
[1:06:03] great
[1:06:03] designer uh begins to create this man
[1:06:07] who the Bible says he created all the
[1:06:09] animals but none of the animals did he
[1:06:11] form in his own image but it was man who
[1:06:14] he created and formed in his own
[1:06:17] reflection his own image of of himself
[1:06:21] the Bible says that he begins to form
[1:06:24] this piece of clay and then he breathes
[1:06:26] into Adam the breath of life into his
[1:06:29] nostrils and then the scripture says it
[1:06:31] this way and Man became a living Soul
[1:06:35] now brother bham says now when he was
[1:06:36] going to take a he says when he made man
[1:06:39] he was showing him his position that he
[1:06:42] came from the Earth Earth was his mother
[1:06:45] you could say it that way you say how is
[1:06:47] that possible because don't think of
[1:06:49] Mother Nature that's not what we're
[1:06:50] speaking about this morning but but
[1:06:53] Earth brother bam says was part of the
[1:06:55] Eternal attribute of God and he even
[1:06:59] goes on to in the church age book say
[1:07:01] that in the that in the Book of Life and
[1:07:03] he says your name was there my name was
[1:07:05] there he says the Earth was there
[1:07:08] because it was part of the original
[1:07:10] creation do you follow me this morning
[1:07:12] so the Earth can no be more be lost than
[1:07:15] you can be lost the Earth can no more be
[1:07:18] annihilated and destroyed no more than
[1:07:20] you can be annihilated or destroyed you
[1:07:22] say how because I came from God I'll go
[1:07:25] back to God in my identity of my origin
[1:07:29] It reveals my
[1:07:32] destiny and brother bam says you you he
[1:07:34] says You Came From God you you he says
[1:07:37] you so so you go back to God and he says
[1:07:39] the Earth though it goes into a a fallen
[1:07:43] condition but brother bandam says what
[1:07:44] is that Eternal fire going to be uh when
[1:07:48] when when the Bible says that all the
[1:07:50] elements shall melt with fervent
[1:07:53] heat preach about global warming that's
[1:07:56] global warming right
[1:07:57] there the the element shall melt with
[1:08:00] fervent Heat and the scripture says that
[1:08:04] all Earth is groaning it's travailing
[1:08:06] within itself waiting for the
[1:08:09] manifestation of the sons of God even
[1:08:11] that groaning is the Greek word stenio
[1:08:14] which means it's like a mother giving
[1:08:16] birth a woman giving birth to a child
[1:08:19] and it says the Earth is groaning why is
[1:08:22] she groaning because of brother M says
[1:08:25] because of what man has done to her he's
[1:08:29] polluted her he's defiled her he's he's
[1:08:32] he's he's destroyed the
[1:08:35] Earth and man is destroying the Earth
[1:08:38] today man is continually sin is
[1:08:40] dominating this this culture sin is
[1:08:43] dominating the Earth and it's destroying
[1:08:45] the Earth the whole atmosphere becomes
[1:08:47] polluted God doesn't have to destroy man
[1:08:50] man will destroy
[1:08:52] himself are you here today and so the
[1:08:56] Earth is groaning the scripture says all
[1:08:58] creation granth and travaileth there's
[1:09:01] that word like a woman waiting to
[1:09:03] waiting in expectation to be delivered
[1:09:06] of brother ROM says of who of sinful
[1:09:08] Mankind and she's groaning for the
[1:09:14] manifestation of men like
[1:09:17] Adam the manifestation of the seeds of
[1:09:21] God the sons of God
[1:09:25] oh man I'm never going to get to my
[1:09:28] sermon brother Bon says you didn't
[1:09:30] become a
[1:09:31] son by the rebirth by by being born
[1:09:35] again he says you didn't become a son by
[1:09:37] being born again you were a son and so
[1:09:41] therefore you were born again
[1:09:44] hallelujah oh it goes so contrary to the
[1:09:46] way we think of it brother random says
[1:09:49] he says only he says that he says only
[1:09:51] the elected can be born
[1:09:53] again he says because in non-elect
[1:09:56] there's nothing that doesn't mean they
[1:09:57] can't be saved it doesn't mean that that
[1:10:00] that there's no salvation the Bible says
[1:10:02] in John 3:16 for God so loved the world
[1:10:05] the cosmos the whole earth that he gave
[1:10:07] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:10:09] shall believeth in him but there's a
[1:10:10] difference between salvation that comes
[1:10:13] from the King to humanity and Redemption
[1:10:16] that comes only to his elected
[1:10:21] wife and let me just stop here and say
[1:10:24] this this is going to cut to the Chase
[1:10:25] brother brandham did not create that
[1:10:28] Doctrine it's right
[1:10:32] here the elected family of God was
[1:10:35] always in the mind of God can you say
[1:10:37] Amen this morning the elected family was
[1:10:40] always in the mind of God he says you
[1:10:41] didn't come he says he says you didn't
[1:10:44] you you he says only elected can reborn
[1:10:46] can be reborn and he says you weren't
[1:10:48] elected because you were born again you
[1:10:50] were born again because of your
[1:10:54] election and so the Earth was a part of
[1:10:56] God all creation granth and
[1:11:00] travelleth and and and Paul says and
[1:11:02] then he says and then we also within
[1:11:06] ourselves
[1:11:08] grown are you a Believer here this
[1:11:10] morning we groan within ourselves say
[1:11:14] brother Matt what are we groaning over
[1:11:16] sinful
[1:11:17] Mankind and we can't wait to be rid of
[1:11:20] this sinful mankind to express who we
[1:11:24] really are
[1:11:29] Hallelujah and so in the beginning God
[1:11:31] makes Adam and any forms of him from the
[1:11:34] dust of the earth shows him his position
[1:11:36] now he's going to take Eve and Eve's
[1:11:38] going to be as important as Adam is her
[1:11:42] position is going to be as essential for
[1:11:45] without an eve There's No Redemption for
[1:11:48] without an Eve there's no fall there's
[1:11:49] no way for Adam to have fallen for
[1:11:52] without Eve there's no mystery of
[1:11:54] creation or
[1:11:57] Redemption but through the manifestation
[1:11:59] through what had through so brother B
[1:12:01] says what does God do he says he didn't
[1:12:03] go over now listen to me close he says
[1:12:06] he didn't go over and pick up another
[1:12:07] piece of
[1:12:09] clay and make her from the dirt he said
[1:12:11] because she wasn't going to be the dirt
[1:12:13] he said if she was made from the dirt
[1:12:14] she'd be a doormat to be walked
[1:12:17] on and he says but she wasn't he says
[1:12:20] but God went over into the heart the rib
[1:12:23] and brother bam stops I love this and he
[1:12:25] says the rib right underneath the
[1:12:29] heart and you know why brother bam says
[1:12:31] that he says because that showed her
[1:12:33] position that she was right from under
[1:12:37] the heart of
[1:12:39] Adam
[1:12:41] Glory the Bible says that he takes from
[1:12:44] Adam and so God takes from man and the
[1:12:48] Bible says that that she's he says that
[1:12:51] now the the scripture says he takes from
[1:12:53] man let me just find my place here and
[1:12:56] so he doesn't take another piece of clay
[1:12:58] doesn't take another piece of dust but
[1:13:01] he takes from the existing material he
[1:13:04] takes from the existing creation oh my
[1:13:07] brother my sister you didn't come from
[1:13:09] some other part of the earth you came
[1:13:10] from the back part of God's mind it
[1:13:12] you're part of God from the
[1:13:16] beginning and so God takes for man to
[1:13:19] make the woman and then Adam her husband
[1:13:23] the groom the the king not the Queen the
[1:13:27] king here is going to
[1:13:30] identify who she
[1:13:32] is and he says you are now bone of my
[1:13:36] bone and Flesh of My Flesh therefore who
[1:13:39] where was the identity the identity for
[1:13:41] Eve was found in
[1:13:43] Adam you are now bone of my bone and
[1:13:46] Flesh of My
[1:13:48] Flesh and here comes the the woman now
[1:13:54] here's man
[1:13:55] and then God created as brother Donnie
[1:13:57] Reagan loves to say the wo
[1:14:01] man and he says and and then brother bam
[1:14:04] says that God as the marriage officer
[1:14:08] there was there here's here comes the
[1:14:10] separation God separates the bone
[1:14:12] separates the rib pulls out of Adam his
[1:14:15] feminist side now she was
[1:14:18] Adam in female
[1:14:22] form she's she's not called Eve remember
[1:14:25] this her name isn't Eve right here you
[1:14:27] say there's Eve no no no no no she was
[1:14:29] called Eve when she became the mother of
[1:14:31] all
[1:14:33] creation but here she's Adam in female
[1:14:37] or we could say bride
[1:14:39] form the same from the same
[1:14:43] material and her identity is in Adam but
[1:14:46] now she's Adam in Bride form and so
[1:14:50] there was this great as we said this
[1:14:52] great separation God separates Eve from
[1:14:55] Adam and then God brings them back
[1:14:57] together in holy matrimony in marriage
[1:15:00] the first family was in Eden the first
[1:15:03] marriage was in
[1:15:05] Eden and and and every family follows
[1:15:09] the pattern of Adam and
[1:15:12] Eve this brother Harold Becket loves to
[1:15:14] say it wasn't Adam and
[1:15:18] Steve I should get a hearty amen it
[1:15:22] wasn't Eve Evelyn it was Adam and Eve
[1:15:27] one man and one woman can you say
[1:15:33] Amen you're now bone of my bone Flesh of
[1:15:36] My Flesh and so God removes a part of
[1:15:38] Adam and he forms a woman and then he
[1:15:41] brought Eve he brings that part of Adam
[1:15:45] back to himself and introduces her back
[1:15:48] to Adam for she was Adam in female form
[1:15:54] this is the book of the Generations this
[1:15:55] is Genesis 5 this is the book of the
[1:15:58] generations of Adam in the day that God
[1:16:00] created man in the likeness of God made
[1:16:02] he him male and female created he them
[1:16:05] blessed them and called their
[1:16:09] name
[1:16:12] Adam Genesis 5 he called their name Adam
[1:16:17] in the day they were created now the
[1:16:22] Bible know we know that Adam has
[1:16:23] dominion over all of of Eden he has
[1:16:26] Authority as on the earth as a Son of
[1:16:28] God he's positionally placed he knows
[1:16:31] who he is he has Authority and dominion
[1:16:33] and and but the scripture says but he's
[1:16:35] lonely and so you know what God's doing
[1:16:37] in Adam I hope you catch this it's just
[1:16:40] like Hosea what is brother bandom what
[1:16:42] what does the bible teach us about Hosea
[1:16:44] God takes a prophet named Hosea and he
[1:16:46] gives him a wife and that wife becomes
[1:16:48] Unfaithful now listen what is God doing
[1:16:52] God is putting his Prophet through
[1:16:55] what he himself is going
[1:17:00] through you as we said all they all have
[1:17:03] par parabolic lives they all have a
[1:17:05] compound meaning why does Jeremiah go
[1:17:08] for years as a single man God says
[1:17:10] because Jeremiah you're going to feel
[1:17:11] what I feel I feel like a single
[1:17:14] man where is my wife and and he begins
[1:17:17] to you go through all of the prophets of
[1:17:19] God the life that they live was typing
[1:17:21] so what is now the first couple going
[1:17:23] through EX exactly what God is trying to
[1:17:26] express Adam God was lonely so Adam was
[1:17:30] lonely God wanted a help meat so God
[1:17:33] created Adam Adam needed a help meat can
[1:17:36] you say Amen this morning and so God
[1:17:38] makes him male and female created them
[1:17:40] and the Bible says and the Lord God said
[1:17:43] Genesis 2:18 it is not good that the man
[1:17:48] should be alone notice he's talking
[1:17:49] about
[1:17:51] himself I will make him a help me for
[1:17:55] him the woman was not
[1:17:59] lonely
[1:18:01] hello loneliness was in the
[1:18:05] man the woman was not longing but the
[1:18:08] man was longing oh the song says I
[1:18:12] didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't look
[1:18:14] for him he looked for me I wasn't
[1:18:17] searching but he was searching and he
[1:18:20] found me when I was going the wrong way
[1:18:23] he was wooing to me he was calling to me
[1:18:26] he needed
[1:18:27] me
[1:18:28] glory and the Bible says the man was
[1:18:31] lonely he was alone so she she was made
[1:18:35] the Bible says she was man woman was
[1:18:36] made for the man so God doesn't take
[1:18:38] another piece of clay or dust to make
[1:18:41] his first Adam a bride he takes from
[1:18:44] Adam he puts him under anesthesia
[1:18:47] brother Brandon says the first surgeon
[1:18:48] the first surgery to take place here's
[1:18:50] great Papa God the great physician the
[1:18:53] great surgeon
[1:18:55] and he puts him in a deep sleep and he
[1:18:57] takes a part of Adam and he begins to
[1:18:59] form a bride everything that Eve had
[1:19:02] came from Adam everything Eve had came
[1:19:05] from Adam everything Eve had came from
[1:19:08] Adam this was her identity this was who
[1:19:12] she was this was how she was fulfilled
[1:19:15] and and the Bible says that that she was
[1:19:17] an extension of him her blood was from
[1:19:22] him her flesh was from him her spirit
[1:19:25] was from him God the first surgeon prod
[1:19:30] uh uh takes the first operation to
[1:19:32] provide for his son Adam a bride Lord
[1:19:36] God caused the Deep Sleep to fall upon
[1:19:38] Adam and he slept and he took one of his
[1:19:40] ribs and closed up the flesh instead
[1:19:43] thereof Genesis
[1:19:44] 2:21 and so this shows us that the bride
[1:19:47] was taken or the bride was part of the
[1:19:50] bridegroom her identification was in him
[1:19:54] and now that after he removes this part
[1:19:56] of Adam he closes up the flesh God then
[1:19:59] takes the role of the marriage
[1:20:03] officer and he introduces this woman his
[1:20:07] bride his wife to Adam and introducing
[1:20:13] Adam back to him in Bride
[1:20:16] form the form was different but it was
[1:20:19] still Adam we'll read it again and Adam
[1:20:22] said this is now bone of my bone Flesh
[1:20:23] of My Flesh and she shall be called
[1:20:25] woman because she was taken out of man
[1:20:29] and so he gives the reason why he's
[1:20:31] calling her woman because she was taken
[1:20:33] out of the man and listen to me brother
[1:20:35] and sister the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:37] will be of him she'll be called by his
[1:20:40] name she'll be part of him she'll keep
[1:20:43] his word because it's her word she wants
[1:20:46] his thoughts because it's her thoughts
[1:20:49] she wants his righteousness not her own
[1:20:51] she wants his life not her life and
[1:20:55] that's why there's a desire inside of
[1:20:56] you to say make me more like Jesus I
[1:20:59] want to be more like him because you
[1:21:01] came from him that's your
[1:21:05] identity as John 15 I think it's verse
[1:21:08] 16 says you Jesus says you have not
[1:21:10] chosen me but I chose
[1:21:13] you the woman didn't choose man but God
[1:21:16] brought her to Adam and so we we know
[1:21:19] even further than that and I'm going to
[1:21:21] I'm going to just burn all my time this
[1:21:23] morning laying a foundation
[1:21:25] we know further than that we could
[1:21:26] preach to you and maybe I'll skip it
[1:21:27] here this morning just to save time but
[1:21:30] we could take that first you saywell
[1:21:31] there it is in Genesis it goes beyond
[1:21:34] Genesis it goes away the the the bride
[1:21:37] the the the groom and the bride and the
[1:21:39] marriage goes away Beyond goes into
[1:21:41] eleazer who we know the Bible uh the
[1:21:44] patriarch here's Abraham and he gets a
[1:21:45] servant eleazer and he and he's going to
[1:21:48] go find a bride for Isaac what is it
[1:21:50] it's a real Isaac it's a real Rebecca
[1:21:52] it's a real elaser but it's speaking of
[1:21:55] a greater
[1:21:56] mystery it wasn't just to identify a
[1:21:59] woman named Rebecca but in 2020 it
[1:22:02] identify another woman named Rebecca and
[1:22:05] he would send another elaser and that
[1:22:07] elaser would be a prophet to this
[1:22:09] Gentile age and he would go to search
[1:22:11] for a
[1:22:13] bride for who
[1:22:16] Isaac
[1:22:20] Christ elizar makes this long journey oh
[1:22:24] I I wish wish we had time to preach on
[1:22:25] it there's so much so much good amen in
[1:22:28] that story and we know he waits at the
[1:22:30] well and and he's he's prayed for this
[1:22:32] certain young woman that he didn't know
[1:22:34] who it was but he know that she would
[1:22:37] respond he was looking for the response
[1:22:40] he was looking for how she responded
[1:22:42] what was it it was going to be character
[1:22:44] bride character Rebecca the way she
[1:22:47] responded to eler would identify who she
[1:22:51] was the way you responded to this word
[1:22:54] identifies to the devil to God and to
[1:22:57] you who you really are you say how do I
[1:23:00] respond I don't question it I don't have
[1:23:02] to understand it I simply believe it
[1:23:06] because I'm part of it I may not be able
[1:23:08] to put it on a chalkboard and write it
[1:23:10] all out and explain everything I believe
[1:23:12] but I know I believe it and I know it's
[1:23:14] me and I know it's my identity and no
[1:23:16] devil in hell can shake a revelation
[1:23:18] that God gives to a son or daughter of
[1:23:20] God it's who you are
[1:23:26] he was looking for a certain
[1:23:32] reaction and so elzar comes to that
[1:23:35] well it came notice here the Bible says
[1:23:38] that in in in Genesis it speaks of this
[1:23:40] and it says God uh the Lord Lord God of
[1:23:43] my master Abraham I pray thee send me
[1:23:44] good speed this day show kindness and my
[1:23:46] master behold I stand Here by The Well
[1:23:47] of water Daughters of men of the City
[1:23:49] come out to draw water and let it notice
[1:23:52] the daughters of men the daughters of
[1:23:53] men but but here's one in the midst of
[1:23:55] many daughters there was
[1:23:58] one many many many me to say this many
[1:24:02] draw from the water of this
[1:24:04] well but then there's one
[1:24:06] daughter who God has his eyes
[1:24:10] upon many draw from the City come out
[1:24:13] for the draw water let it come to pass
[1:24:15] that the dams to whom I shall say let
[1:24:17] down thy picture I pray the that I may
[1:24:18] drink and she shall say drink and I will
[1:24:21] give thy camels drink also let the same
[1:24:23] be she that thou has appointed for thy
[1:24:25] servant Isaac and thereby shall I know
[1:24:28] that thou has showed kindness unto my
[1:24:31] master notice not even elaser knows who
[1:24:34] she
[1:24:37] is here's the servant she doesn't he
[1:24:40] doesn't know he can't he doesn't have
[1:24:42] God doesn't give him the discernment to
[1:24:43] look in all the midst of many and says
[1:24:46] uh
[1:24:48] you but God says Lord let it be that she
[1:24:52] doesn't just want to give me water but
[1:24:54] she wants to water my camels
[1:24:57] also and he says let it be let me find
[1:24:59] it thereby therefore I shall know that
[1:25:02] thou will showed kindness unto my master
[1:25:04] and it came to pass before he had done
[1:25:06] speaking that Rebecca came out who was
[1:25:08] born of Bethel son of milka the wife of
[1:25:09] nahor Abraham's brother with her pitcher
[1:25:12] upon her shoulder and the damsel was
[1:25:14] very very to look upon a virgin no
[1:25:16] accident neither had any man known her
[1:25:19] no accident and she went down to the
[1:25:21] well and filled her picture and came up
[1:25:23] it was no accident she was a virgin it
[1:25:25] was no accident no man had been with her
[1:25:27] listen to me brother and sister your
[1:25:29] life was no accident the course that
[1:25:31] your life took was no accident you
[1:25:34] didn't just end up here believing what
[1:25:35] you believe but by predestination God's
[1:25:38] sovereignty he operated and manipulated
[1:25:41] your entire life to come to this
[1:25:45] truth he protected
[1:25:47] you and your
[1:25:49] mind oh can you say am man this morning
[1:25:52] he was protecting Rebecca when she
[1:25:54] didn't realize he was protecting her she
[1:25:57] had no idea her life was was for this
[1:25:59] moment and her entire life is a little
[1:26:02] girl the Holy Spirit watched over
[1:26:06] her brother random says this I love this
[1:26:09] let me I hope I can find this quickly
[1:26:11] amen here this morning I don't I I got
[1:26:13] these so backwards and so let me just

[1:26:20] going to get these wrong so you just
[1:26:22] forgive me give me just one moment
[1:26:25] uh I think this is this is here here's
[1:26:27] where he's where he's at now notice her
[1:26:30] long hair Nazar to the word now notice
[1:26:34] what the prophet says don't read ahead
[1:26:35] of me please brother bham says he says
[1:26:38] I'm going to identify and if you listen
[1:26:40] to this message he identifies the false
[1:26:42] church he identifies the Antichrist
[1:26:44] spirit and that's important to do he
[1:26:46] identifies the spirit that would be in
[1:26:48] the false church but now brother vandom
[1:26:49] says he says now notice her long hair
[1:26:51] Nar right B of the word I'll picture the
[1:26:54] bride of Christ now so I'll picture her

[1:27:17] camels also so you got to have a certain
[1:27:19] character and God was looking for a
[1:27:20] certain character and brother Brandon
[1:27:22] says now let me picture the bride he
[1:27:24] says let me picture the bride of Christ

[1:31:45] ordained to that will be
[1:31:52] that it cuz it's the their
[1:31:55] nature cuz it's their
[1:31:58] nature not because their nature they are
[1:32:01] that are you following me here this
[1:32:03] morning your conduct doesn't make you
[1:32:06] elected your seed does your conduct is a
[1:32:10] result of the seed that's inside of
[1:32:13] you an orange tree doesn't have to push
[1:32:17] think about it brother says it doesn't
[1:32:18] have to it's just an orange tree that's
[1:32:19] what it is it'll produce
[1:32:21] oranges he says an apple tree doesn't
[1:32:24] have to work it doesn't have to labor
[1:32:25] it'll produce
[1:32:26] apples and brother bam says no matter
[1:32:28] how much you tell me you're a Christian
[1:32:31] he says if I don't see the fruits of a
[1:32:33] Christian I I don't need to guess I
[1:32:35] don't need to wonder you produce what
[1:32:37] you
[1:32:38] are it's your
[1:32:40] nature you're you You're Not Elected by
[1:32:43] the You're Not Elected because of your

[1:32:55] him he says he says I hope that myself
[1:32:58] every one of you are part of that bride
[1:33:00] I hope many that'll be he says all
[1:33:02] that's been ordained to that will be
[1:33:05] that CUA it's their nature the word can
[1:33:09] only recognize the
[1:33:12] word it can't recognize nothing a wheat
[1:33:15] can't be nothing but a wheat it started
[1:33:19] a wheat it'll head up a wheat and a weed
[1:33:23] can never be a wheat yet it's watered by
[1:33:26] the same anointing cuz but it ain't a
[1:33:31] wheat I think sometimes we try so hard
[1:33:34] to convince someone to be a wheat we try
[1:33:38] so hard by legalism to force someone
[1:33:40] into a
[1:33:42] mold and if you could ever Force someone
[1:33:44] into a mold they can be forced out of
[1:33:46] that
[1:33:49] mold we try to force people into into
[1:33:52] into into to force people to adhere to
[1:33:56] certain things and live a certain way
[1:33:58] look a certain way but listen to me
[1:34:00] friends I'll make it real simple as the
[1:34:02] prophet did if they are a weed they can
[1:34:04] never be a
[1:34:05] wheat no matter how much we try to make
[1:34:08] them a wheat they'll always be a
[1:34:11] weed and on the contrary if you're a
[1:34:14] wheat no matter how much the devil tries
[1:34:16] to make you a weed no matter what he
[1:34:18] puts at you no matter what he throws at
[1:34:20] you you'll always be a wheat
[1:34:24] no matter how much the Devil Comes
[1:34:26] against me I'll always believe this word
[1:34:28] no matter how many lies he tries to sell
[1:34:30] me I'll always believe the word you say
[1:34:33] why brother Matt because of your
[1:34:34] intellect no because of your conduct Oh
[1:34:36] by no means no because I'm a
[1:34:40] Believer and it's by his grace I'm a
[1:34:46] Believer he says it's the same anointing
[1:34:48] but it ain't a weat her long hair
[1:34:50] Nazarite vow shows that she's vowed to
[1:34:53] God her beautiful gown of his promised
[1:34:55] word for the age that she's living and
[1:34:57] wrapped around her I love that
[1:34:58] vindicating her with himself of Hebrews
[1:35:02] 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:35:04] today and forever and she's a part of
[1:35:06] the word groom true to him I say Lord
[1:35:09] let me be let my life let my testimony
[1:35:12] be this I'm true to him in every
[1:35:17] Point elzar didn't know who she
[1:35:20] was but the Bible says that she got and
[1:35:24] she had done giving him a drink and she
[1:35:25] said I'll draw water from thy camels
[1:35:27] also until they were done drinking and
[1:35:29] so here's a bride Rebecca appointed to
[1:35:32] Isaac but she had to act she had to
[1:35:36] produce she had to identify herself in
[1:35:40] such a way that elzer would know that's
[1:35:42] her brother Bram says I don't know who
[1:35:43] it is but here's what I could tell you
[1:35:45] she'll believe the word she'll just
[1:35:47] simply believe it I'm not going to
[1:35:49] complicate it she'll just believe the
[1:35:51] word as eleazer spoke to her her the
[1:35:54] Bible says about Isaac he tells her
[1:35:56] about him she's never seen him she's
[1:35:58] never heard she's never seen this Isaac
[1:36:01] but she believed every word he
[1:36:04] spoke she was willing to leave mother to
[1:36:07] leave father to leave everything to go
[1:36:10] follow a man to a place she had never
[1:36:12] been to marry a man she had never
[1:36:17] seen
[1:36:20] Hallelujah and on the way elizar tells
[1:36:22] her about Isaac and she wanted to know
[1:36:24] more tell me more tell me more of what
[1:36:27] he's like and and then when she finally
[1:36:29] sees him the Bible says she covers
[1:36:31] herself with the veil showing she's in
[1:36:33] obedience now to the bridegroom what is
[1:36:36] it it's a story The Book of
[1:36:40] marriage the book of a bride a groom and
[1:36:44] a bride goes all the way beyond that and
[1:36:46] then the Apostle Paul begins to pick
[1:36:48] this up the Bride of Jesus Christ who's
[1:36:50] it going to be it's going to be
[1:36:51] individuals not a group it'll be one
[1:36:53] here one there one here believer here
[1:36:56] believer there and it will make up a
[1:36:58] many membered
[1:37:00] bride she's made up of of individuals
[1:37:04] from all you say what part of the world
[1:37:07] all parts of the
[1:37:08] world what language all
[1:37:12] languages what color of skin all colors
[1:37:15] of skin Oh what that what what
[1:37:17] background all background what what what
[1:37:20] what kind of what kind of prestige what
[1:37:22] kind of uh poverty will what should be
[1:37:23] rich what should be poor she'll be made
[1:37:25] up of a of a bride of every nation of
[1:37:29] every language of every color of every
[1:37:33] kind but she's made up from Saints from
[1:37:36] All Nation no
[1:37:39] organization but a people from all walks
[1:37:42] of
[1:37:43] life you say how how will how will God
[1:37:46] get every single one of them by one
[1:37:47] thing Jesus says my sheep hear my voice
[1:37:54] and he says and I know them and they
[1:37:56] follow
[1:37:58] me my sheep know my
[1:38:04] voice Paul says for I'm jealous this is
[1:38:06] 2 Corinthians 11 for I'm jealous over
[1:38:09] you with a Godly jealousy for I have
[1:38:12] espoused you to one husband that I may
[1:38:14] present you as a chaste virgin to Christ
[1:38:16] in Ephesians Paul picks it up and he
[1:38:18] says husbands Ephesians 5 husbands I
[1:38:22] think this is verse 25 love your
[1:38:25] wives and all the sisters said
[1:38:29] amen even as Christ also loved the
[1:38:32] church and gave himself for it what's he
[1:38:34] saying brother matter is Ephesians 5
[1:38:36] about husbands and wives
[1:38:38] yes is it about how a husband should
[1:38:40] treat a wife
[1:38:44] yes but it's more than
[1:38:46] that notice that he might sanctify it
[1:38:50] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[1:38:52] Water by the word that he may present it
[1:38:54] to himself a glorious church not having
[1:38:57] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[1:39:00] that it should be holy and without
[1:39:02] blemish so all men love to love their
[1:39:06] wives as their own
[1:39:09] bodies he that loveth his wife loveth
[1:39:12] himself for no man ever yet hateth his
[1:39:15] own flesh but nourisheth it cherisheth
[1:39:17] it even as the Lord the
[1:39:22] church for for we are members of his
[1:39:26] body of his flesh and of his bones for
[1:39:30] this cause shall a man leave him father
[1:39:32] and mother shall be joined unto his wife
[1:39:34] and they too shall be one
[1:39:38] flesh now you got all
[1:39:40] that husband wife now Paul says but let
[1:39:43] me go a little bit deeper this is a
[1:39:45] great
[1:39:47] mystery but I speak concerning Christ
[1:39:51] and the church
[1:39:55] what is it there's a bride that will
[1:39:58] marry that will be a many membered body
[1:40:00] of all people from all walks of life a
[1:40:03] glorious Church Without spot without
[1:40:05] wrinkle that would be holy and without
[1:40:08] blemish like he is what is it tell me
[1:40:12] there will be a bride who spotless
[1:40:14] chased virgin unto Christ there will be
[1:40:18] somebody in the last age who believes
[1:40:21] the word of God there will be some
[1:40:23] somebody I don't know I I say say who is
[1:40:26] it brother Matt I don't know who it'll
[1:40:27] be I hope it's me I say by your grace
[1:40:30] God let it be me Revelations 3:20 to him
[1:40:34] that overcometh what does it mean to him
[1:40:37] in other words there will be a
[1:40:40] person I say Lord let me be that person
[1:40:43] let me be that
[1:40:45] Overcomer that your word speaks
[1:40:48] of we're going to close here give me
[1:40:50] just a few minutes are you okay this
[1:40:52] morning
[1:40:54] I told you I had a lot my my Fork is
[1:40:56] full of hay but I'm just going to I'm
[1:40:58] going to not bury you this morning I'm
[1:40:59] going to
[1:41:01] stop so Isaiah begins with the scripture
[1:41:04] we read Isaiah 4:1 Brothers if you have
[1:41:07] that you can put it up and in that day
[1:41:09] seven women shall take a hold of one man
[1:41:10] saying now notice what they say seven
[1:41:13] women now we know this is not an
[1:41:15] accident that the numerology brother bam
[1:41:17] says God's all in mathematics he's all
[1:41:19] in numerology you can see it all the way
[1:41:20] throughout the
[1:41:22] Bible and speaks of seven seven Church
[1:41:25] ages speaks of seven Messengers speaks
[1:41:27] of seven eyes seven lamps seven vials
[1:41:30] seven trumpets Seven Seals Seven
[1:41:35] Ages but now we have this seven women a
[1:41:39] characteristic and there was seven false
[1:41:42] Brides of every age there was a false
[1:41:45] bride of Ephesus but there was a true
[1:41:48] bride there was a false bride of Samia
[1:41:51] there was a true bride brother vom says
[1:41:54] and that true bride believed the
[1:41:55] messenger for their day they didn't
[1:41:57] denominate around his teachings but they
[1:41:59] went on with
[1:42:02] Christ so he says there's seven women
[1:42:04] Seven Ages now we know that every age
[1:42:06] would have a spirit you say brother mat
[1:42:09] you you know sometimes when you read the
[1:42:10] church age when you read the book of
[1:42:12] Revelations you read the church age book
[1:42:14] we can we can if you're not careful you
[1:42:16] will you will cut and paste you will you
[1:42:19] will block out everything that's written
[1:42:21] about the Church of Ephesus that it was
[1:42:23] just for Ephesus and the warning was
[1:42:25] just for Ephesus and then you read
[1:42:27] Philadelphia and you say that was
[1:42:29] Philadelphia there was the warning for
[1:42:30] Philadelphia there was the church then
[1:42:31] you read lady AA you say here's the
[1:42:33] warning but brother vam says the spirit
[1:42:35] speaks in all ages in other words there
[1:42:37] would be a portion the white horse rider
[1:42:40] the black horse rider the red horse
[1:42:41] rider then you had a pale horse rider
[1:42:43] who's riding in this age and brother M
[1:42:46] says who was that pale horse rider why
[1:42:48] was he pale because he was a
[1:42:50] conglomerate of all of the horses
[1:42:54] so all of the spirits from every age
[1:42:57] would come up into a Unity to where in
[1:42:59] this age it would be Satan's
[1:43:02] Eden and he would be called by the
[1:43:05] Apostle Paul the God of this evil
[1:43:08] age can you say amen and so every Spirit
[1:43:13] there would be a portion a measure that
[1:43:15] would apply to every
[1:43:17] age and so he says there's seven women
[1:43:20] notice let's read it one more time shall
[1:43:22] take a hold of one man who's that one
[1:43:24] man Christ saying we will eat our own
[1:43:28] bread notice what they're saying we will
[1:43:32] wear our own
[1:43:37] apparel only let us be called by thy
[1:43:42] name so they want the name but they
[1:43:46] don't want his
[1:43:50] word because his word is the
[1:43:55] bread and his word is further than bread
[1:43:59] it's also the
[1:44:00] apparel what is the bride clothed in the
[1:44:03] apparel of the
[1:44:05] word brother bam says that Vindicated
[1:44:07] word she wraps herself in that Garment
[1:44:09] of the Vindicated word what is that word
[1:44:11] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday he's
[1:44:13] the same today he's the same
[1:44:16] forever and so he says only let us be
[1:44:20] called by thy name to take away
[1:44:24] our
[1:44:26] reproach and and so we know here that
[1:44:28] that the scripture knows we know what
[1:44:30] the Bible speaks about reproach it's sin
[1:44:33] sin is a reproach and so only take away
[1:44:37] our sin so this seven these seven women
[1:44:41] particularly it would be called that
[1:44:43] scripture makes it very clear this is
[1:44:45] what the Bible is very uh clear of that
[1:44:48] that this is Christ in all ages and that
[1:44:51] within all ages there would be Christ
[1:44:52] and with in all ages there would have to
[1:44:54] be an
[1:44:55] antichrist if there was a spirit of God
[1:44:58] a spirit of Christ there would be a
[1:44:59] spirit of the Antichrist right this is
[1:45:02] Elementary to a Believer and brother vam
[1:45:04] says that that that that Bride of the
[1:45:06] last day she'll be able to discern and
[1:45:10] withstand the Antichrist Spirit he says
[1:45:14] she'll recognize the two Spirits within
[1:45:16] the
[1:45:17] framework of the Christian
[1:45:20] church and so we know here that the
[1:45:23] scripture says he says in verse one we
[1:45:25] will eat our own
[1:45:27] bread we will wear our own apparel only
[1:45:30] let us be called by thy name to take
[1:45:32] away our
[1:45:34] reproach so here's seven women
[1:45:38] approaching one man and here's their
[1:45:39] testimony you don't have to provide we
[1:45:41] don't need your provision we don't need
[1:45:44] you to provide for us we don't we don't
[1:45:46] we don't need
[1:45:47] food are you
[1:45:49] here we don't need food
[1:45:53] we'll take care of that part we got our
[1:45:54] own bread we don't need your bread don't
[1:45:58] need your food don't need your provision
[1:46:00] you don't have to bride in fact further
[1:46:01] than that we don't need no bread we
[1:46:03] don't need no
[1:46:05] clothes because we have our own clothes
[1:46:08] now isn't it
[1:46:09] amazing that the Church of the last day
[1:46:12] the lady aan Church age the Bible says
[1:46:14] they would say we're rich we're
[1:46:16] increased with Goods we have need of
[1:46:20] nothing and knowest thou not that thou
[1:46:23] are wretched miserable poor blind and
[1:46:27] naked we don't need your food we don't
[1:46:31] need your clothes we have our own
[1:46:33] robes you don't have to be notice you
[1:46:36] don't even have to be very spiritual to
[1:46:38] catch the significance of Isaiah 4:1
[1:46:41] what is it take away our reproach take
[1:46:43] away our sin take away our our reproach
[1:46:46] Proverbs uh 14:34 it says a sin is a
[1:46:49] reproach to any people the reproach of
[1:46:52] what
[1:46:54] guilt take away our guilt take away our
[1:46:57] reproach take away our judgment take
[1:46:59] away the sentence we don't need your
[1:47:01] clothes we don't need your word we want
[1:47:03] to be the bride of
[1:47:06] Christ but we want our own way we want
[1:47:10] your name we want to be the bride of
[1:47:12] Christ but we want it on our terms are
[1:47:15] you here
[1:47:16] today we want it on our terms we don't
[1:47:19] we want we want it on our arrangement
[1:47:24] and so the number seven we know is
[1:47:26] significant it speaks of completion
[1:47:28] brother brandom said and it was all of
[1:47:30] this the Bible says it was a bride in
[1:47:33] every age seven women to take attempt to
[1:47:36] take a hold of one man Christ to get
[1:47:39] relief from what guilt condemnation
[1:47:43] destruction persecution
[1:47:46] plague there are certain people in the
[1:47:48] world today that want nothing more than
[1:47:52] to treat God like a vending
[1:47:55] machine just give me give me give me a
[1:47:58] little bit of Grace that's what I need
[1:47:59] today give me a little bit of Mercy
[1:48:00] that's what I need today give me a
[1:48:01] little Joy give me a little love they
[1:48:02] don't want Christ they want the
[1:48:05] benefits of being married but they don't
[1:48:08] want to be
[1:48:09] married they want the benefits of betro
[1:48:12] they want the benefits of what his name
[1:48:14] brings but they don't want him it's
[1:48:16] brother Bron said it that way says but
[1:48:18] he says he's got to be more than savior
[1:48:20] he's got to be Lord and
[1:48:23] savior people want savior because that's
[1:48:26] why Jesus is so popular I'm going to
[1:48:28] just stop here and preach for a moment
[1:48:30] that's why Jesus is so popular isn't it
[1:48:33] amazing I know I've said this here many
[1:48:34] many many times but I want to say it
[1:48:36] again it's amazing to me how popular
[1:48:39] Jesus is
[1:48:40] today yet how unpopular he
[1:48:44] was when he was preaching on the shores
[1:48:46] of
[1:48:48] Galilee how unpopular so unpopular that
[1:48:50] he got crucified
[1:48:53] so unpopular the Apostle Paul would have
[1:48:55] to say I'm not
[1:48:57] ashamed the rest of the world may be
[1:48:59] ashamed to to to of of Christ but Paul
[1:49:02] would say I'm not ashamed of the Gospel
[1:49:05] why would he say that unless it was a
[1:49:07] shame it's amazing to me how popular
[1:49:10] though now we live in
[1:49:11] 2020 and now Jesus is just accepted man
[1:49:14] I mean he's just worldwide
[1:49:17] famous famous churches fill up masses
[1:49:21] thousands parades part parties oh every
[1:49:24] politician oh I love I got I you know
[1:49:26] what do they love to say I'm a man of
[1:49:28] Faith what does that mean I'm a man of
[1:49:31] Faith because that that doesn't mean a
[1:49:33] person's a
[1:49:34] Christian he could be of any faith he's
[1:49:37] a woman of Faith she's a woman of Faith
[1:49:39] you know the man of Faith here it's
[1:49:40] became so
[1:49:43] generic I'm a Christian did you know
[1:49:45] that those that that that that the
[1:49:47] Believers of the first church didn't
[1:49:48] call themselves
[1:49:50] Christians hello somebody come on Bible
[1:49:53] students First Church didn't call
[1:49:55] themselves Christians
[1:49:58] didn't the Bible says it this way they
[1:50:00] were first called Christians at Antioch
[1:50:03] in other words they didn't call
[1:50:04] themselves Christians the world called
[1:50:06] them
[1:50:08] Christians you see the
[1:50:10] difference they were labeled Christians
[1:50:13] because they were
[1:50:15] Christlike and when you're Christlike
[1:50:17] you'll be called a Christian you don't
[1:50:20] have to tell anybody I'm a Christian
[1:50:22] they'll say he's a
[1:50:26] Christian but he's so popular today
[1:50:28] people want him by their masses but
[1:50:30] here's what it is they want their own
[1:50:32] food what is it it's bride
[1:50:34] characteristics a bride the character of
[1:50:36] the Bride is to say give me your Mana
[1:50:39] give me your clothes I don't have any of
[1:50:41] my own give me your bread I can't
[1:50:43] produce any on my
[1:50:45] own what is it his bride
[1:50:48] character notice uh Peter begins to
[1:50:50] speak of this it's a it's an attempt to
[1:50:54] take hold of one man to get relief from
[1:50:56] guilt condemnation but they don't want
[1:50:59] intimacy they don't want you know what
[1:51:01] they you know what the world wants today
[1:51:03] they want one really famous word
[1:51:09] forgiveness they want forgiveness I want
[1:51:12] forgiveness too but the world Majors on
[1:51:15] just forgive me just forgive me just
[1:51:19] give me forgiveness what is it it's the
[1:51:22] same as
[1:51:23] saying give us your name to take away
[1:51:26] our
[1:51:27] reproach it's the same we don't we we
[1:51:30] want we don't want the reproach we want
[1:51:33] our sin we don't want the
[1:51:36] consequence of sin you say brother mat
[1:51:39] you believe in justification absolutely
[1:51:41] by faith absolutely there is no faith
[1:51:44] there is no other way faith in Christ
[1:51:45] alone in him alone only are we saved
[1:51:48] we're justified by a finished work on
[1:51:51] Calvary that's that's why we can live
[1:51:53] without guilt and fear and condemnation
[1:51:55] that's the meaning of the Gospel that we
[1:51:57] believe but if that's all you ever know
[1:52:00] is justification you'll never live a
[1:52:02] life of
[1:52:05] sanctification and you'll never have the
[1:52:07] Holy Ghost it's by faith alone that
[1:52:09] we're saved but that Faith produces a
[1:52:15] life can you say Amen this
[1:52:18] morning that Faith produces a life and
[1:52:22] but what we have today is a is a is an
[1:52:25] entire world the Bible says they want to
[1:52:28] be called give us give us we don't need
[1:52:31] your bread we don't need your clothes
[1:52:32] just give us only thy name that we may
[1:52:35] take away our appro our our reproach and
[1:52:37] that's what you see produced today we've
[1:52:39] rep we've replaced convicting preaching
[1:52:44] preaching the word of God that that that
[1:52:46] that that brings
[1:52:48] conviction they' rep they've replaced
[1:52:50] that with with coffee houses in the
[1:52:53] church and 10-minute skits and funny
[1:52:55] sermons and
[1:52:56] politicians can you say
[1:52:59] Amen there's no conviction because
[1:53:01] there's no
[1:53:02] gospel there's a story of Jesus but
[1:53:05] there's no
[1:53:06] Jesus there's the stories but there's no
[1:53:10] living
[1:53:11] person when you got a living person you
[1:53:14] say Lord It's a living
[1:53:17] presence it's a living conviction it's a
[1:53:20] living relationship

[1:53:25] Jesus Christ it means that you're
[1:53:27] groaning you're you're waiting for the
[1:53:29] manifestation of the sons of of the Son
