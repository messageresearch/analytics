[5:00] and she was asking her husband is it
[5:03] wrong to trim the bottom of the hair so
[5:05] it's clean and nice and they were kind
[5:07] of going back and they said we really
[5:10] didn't he really didn't give me the
[5:11] answer so was said and this was
[5:14] yesterday and this morning they got on
[5:16] there they made their way to church and
[5:19] they were listening to their Pastor from

[5:22] hours different so they were listening

[5:34] the glory off of your hair and then he
[5:37] kept
[5:38] preaching and she said okay the answer

[5:51] [Music]
[5:56] amen God bless you everyone God bless
[5:59] you
[6:01] I
[6:02] am
[6:04] grateful brothers and sisters that we
[6:07] can give testimony that we can sing
[6:10] songs of praise that we can gather
[6:12] together to worship I know many many
[6:15] people that they cannot worship freely
[6:19] people in China that I've met dear
[6:21] brothers and sisters people in Iran dear
[6:24] brothers and sisters that they are not
[6:26] permitted to do what we are doing today
[6:28] just so freely
[6:30] out in the
[6:31] open we um I'd like to read let's all
[6:34] stand and I'd like to read a
[6:36] Psalm before we start Psalm
[6:40] 66 verse
[6:43] 16 Psalm
[6:51] 6616 reads like
[6:54] this come and here all ye that fear God
[6:58] and I will declare what he hath done for
[7:00] my soul I Cried unto him with my mouth
[7:04] and he was
[7:06] extolled with my tongue amen a testimony
[7:10] about giving praise about thanking the
[7:12] lord about singing songs and and giving
[7:15] testimony of what God has done for us
[7:18] and let's start today with brother
[7:20] Josiah and he has a a testimony to give
[7:23] and then a song for us brother Josiah
[7:30] and sit
[7:45] down before we do this song um a lot of
[7:48] you know that Grandpa
[7:49] AO has been battling
[7:52] cancer um some of you know but uh
[7:57] basically how it started is that
[7:58] Thanksgiving his feet were getting numb
[8:02] and he didn't really have an appetite so
[8:03] those were the first two things so
[8:06] basically he had when he when we finally
[8:09] got him to go to the doctor which
[8:10] consists of my dad going to his house
[8:13] and getting him in the car and driving
[8:15] him there to get him to go they found
[8:17] out that cancer had started in his
[8:19] bladder and had spread to his spine so
[8:22] once
[8:24] it's metastasized where it started in
[8:27] one place and spread to the other your
[8:29] chance of recovery drop significantly
[8:32] because it's grown so
[8:34] much and so from day one he's been like
[8:38] so
[8:39] positive uh so um encouraged so happy he
[8:46] does laps around his deck on his walker
[8:48] he's not like sitting around he's like
[8:51] he's working hard he's fighting and he's
[8:53] read Christ the Healer like four times
[8:56] and he's been super encouraged by it if
[8:58] you haven't read Christ the Healer by
[9:00] the way you need to get a copy of that
[9:02] we might have some in the office I don't
[9:04] know talk to brother ly he'll buy you a
[9:07] copy
[9:08] and it's it's uh so he's read that my
[9:13] dad gave it to him and he's been like
[9:16] standing on the promise uh claiming his
[9:19] healing every day my mom went over to
[9:22] see him and she came
[9:23] downstairs uh from her room upstairs and
[9:25] he was on the couch with both of his
[9:27] arms up just worshiping in his living
[9:30] room and he said the other day that he
[9:35] was he woke up and he was sitting up in
[9:36] bed and he was just
[9:38] praying uh praying in the spirit and
[9:41] talking to the Lord and he had read his
[9:43] Bible and he just felt the presence of
[9:45] the Lord come into the room and just
[9:47] flow through his body so then he went to
[9:50] the doctor the other day and he says
[9:54] this is a text he wrote to my dad hi
[9:56] Mark just returning from an appointment
[9:59] uh
[10:00] with Dr a my oncologist the first thing
[10:03] he said was good news he said my blood
[10:06] draw that I had had a few hours before
[10:08] said my PSA numbers were 2.53 so they
[10:12] were less than
[10:13] one and you want to be at like four or
[10:18] higher so he was less than one but now
[10:20] he's two and a half so he's gone
[10:22] significantly farther the other way and
[10:25] the cancer has shrunk so much in just a
[10:29] a little bit of time and they're able to
[10:31] take him off some of the steroids which
[10:33] has really been hard on his body and
[10:35] he's feeling so much better and he's
[10:38] he's so happy and you know he's really
[10:42] he's really uh proven that he actually
[10:44] does have faith and he's not afraid and
[10:47] so I believe he's going to come all the
[10:48] way out of it I don't think there's
[10:51] anything holding him back he's so
[10:54] positive every
[10:55] day
[10:57] um yeah we're going to sing this song

[16:10] incredible we
[16:13] good okay can you hear me yeah there we
[16:15] go um I know I've told you this
[16:18] testimony before but I'm GNA tell you
[16:19] again um brother Josiah mentioned the uh
[16:24] book Christ the Healer are you familiar
[16:26] with that book does anyone is anybody
[16:29] familiar with that book yeah do you know
[16:32] who who wrote it FF Bosworth wrote it
[16:36] brother brandom referred to it so
[16:39] obviously brother Josiah recommended it
[16:41] well there was another one that
[16:42] recommended it too and his name was F
[16:44] was was named William brandom Brother um
[16:47] brother Bosworth was really an
[16:50] incredible man he um was one of the
[16:55] founding fathers of the Assemblies of
[16:57] God denomination when the Assemblies of
[16:59] God denomination adopted the um speaking
[17:04] in tongues as the initial evidence of
[17:06] the Holy Spirit brother Bosworth wrote
[17:08] an open letter to everyone and said this
[17:10] is not right and I resigned my P my
[17:13] position at the Assemblies of God and he
[17:16] stood up for it and he was ousted by the
[17:20] Assemblies of God and and uh you know
[17:22] they kind of scrub history well he's not
[17:24] much in the history of the Assemblies of
[17:26] God anymore so when he he went out and
[17:30] he found something
[17:32] better he met this man named William
[17:35] brandom I believe is in
[17:37] Florida and he said this is what I was
[17:41] looking for my whole life FF Bosworth
[17:45] was there one of the Pentecostal fathers
[17:50] at the isua Street
[17:53] Revival he saw it all happen in Los
[17:56] Angeles and he said when he he found
[17:59] brother brandom he said this is it this
[18:02] is what I've been looking for brother
[18:04] brandom and and brother Bosworth brother
[18:06] Billy Paul told me this story this is
[18:08] the one I've told you before I'm GNA
[18:09] tell you
[18:10] again um brother
[18:14] uh Bosworth was praying for the sick
[18:19] brother brandom was going to bring the
[18:21] message I believe it's the next day so
[18:23] he was staying in his hotel room and he
[18:26] was studying brother Billy Paul was
[18:28] there on the platform with brother
[18:31] Bosworth so brother Bosworth was getting
[18:34] old and he couldn't
[18:36] hear and there was a man came up to be
[18:40] prayed for and he was
[18:43] deaf and brother
[18:45] Bosworth told the man to come up and he
[18:47] said okay face the audience and he put
[18:50] his
[18:51] hands over the man's
[18:54] ears and he asked the Lord he said Lord
[18:57] Jesus heal this man
[18:59] of his deafness the man was facing away
[19:02] from Brother Bosworth brother Bosworth
[19:04] said brother can you hear the brother
[19:07] says yes I can
[19:09] hear and he says brother you're going to
[19:11] have to have more
[19:13] faith and he put his hands on his ears
[19:15] again and he said Lord give this man the
[19:20] faith to be healed and may his ears be
[19:23] healed in the name of Jesus and he said
[19:26] again the brother facing away from him
[19:28] he said now brother can you
[19:30] hear Brother saides I can hear and he
[19:34] says brother you're going to have to
[19:35] have more faith he says brother he says
[19:40] and he starts praying for him again and
[19:43] finally the brother turns around and he
[19:45] says brother I can hear he says now
[19:48] maybe you need to be prayed
[19:49] [Laughter]
[19:51] for and brother Billy Paul said he went
[19:55] back to the hotel room that night and he
[19:57] said brother Baran was crying he was
[20:00] laughing so
[20:02] hard so that was brother Bosworth great

[36:18] share as we
[36:21] tear
[36:23] there none
[36:26] other has
[36:28] [Music]
[36:36] ever amen brother Paul I'm going to ask
[36:39] you to give your testimony then sister
[36:42] Amelia if you could make ready for your
[36:44] song
[36:58] I've been praying and asking the Lord
[37:01] what he wanted me to share because
[37:03] obviously it's not about me and whatever
[37:06] I have to say I want it to be
[37:08] strengthening and and a blessing to you
[37:11] and obviously to bless the Lord as well
[37:15] but uh when Josiah and Katie were
[37:18] singing that song The Mention Of The
[37:21] Lion kind of reminded me of a testimony
[37:25] that uh I share often but I've never
[37:29] shared it here in church and it was when
[37:32] uh the Lord delivered me from
[37:35] PTSD um in
[37:38] 2016 my family and I we went through a
[37:41] pretty rough patch to say the least
[37:44] without going into much
[37:45] detail um because I don't want to take
[37:47] up too much of your
[37:48] time but
[37:51] uh after the this episode in our
[37:55] life I began to experience symptoms that
[37:58] I really didn't understand um I was I
[38:02] had this
[38:03] constant painful knot in my
[38:06] stomach
[38:07] and I just I I no matter how much I
[38:11] prayed it wouldn't go
[38:13] away and I'm no stranger to God
[38:17] answering prayer so it was very
[38:19] mysterious to
[38:21] me but this these symptoms went on for
[38:24] about three
[38:25] years and
[38:28] the only time I found any relief was
[38:31] when I would drink kombucha that had
[38:34] probiotics in it or if I had yogurt that
[38:38] had real probiotics in it I'd experience
[38:41] about three or four minutes of relief
[38:43] that was
[38:45] it but as time went
[38:48] on as the I I need to back up a little
[38:52] bit actually before this episode
[38:54] happened in
[38:55] 2016 I remember clearly hearing the Lord
[38:58] tell me after he brought this flashback
[39:02] of a memory that I had in high school
[39:05] where I had acted a bit
[39:08] cowardly um again I'm not going to share
[39:11] the details of that because it's a
[39:12] little
[39:13] embarrassing but uh anyway you've had
[39:17] those memories where you're you you have
[39:19] something come back to you and you
[39:20] cringe and people are looking at you
[39:21] maybe and they're like what's the matter
[39:23] and you're like
[39:25] nothing so
[39:28] that was one of those moments
[39:30] and the Lord I clearly remember him
[39:33] saying we're going to deal with
[39:35] this and it wasn't until you know
[39:38] sometimes you go through things and it
[39:41] might be one or two or three years later
[39:44] before God lets you know what he's doing
[39:46] or what he did and that's what was going
[39:49] on with me I I was constantly seeking
[39:52] answers and wanting to know God why am I
[39:54] going through this why did this have to
[39:56] happen
[39:58] and Satan is always there to give you
[40:00] answers but you know when it's the voice
[40:04] of faith it just anchors you so I was
[40:08] never
[40:08] settled
[40:11] until I I I need to play this I don't
[40:15] think you'll
[40:17] mind
[40:19] um I was in
[40:22] bed one week uh I believe it was a a
[40:26] weekend
[40:30] now like I said I've been experiencing
[40:31] these symptoms for about 3
[40:34] years
[40:55] and so I was laying in bed one
[40:58] afternoon and
[41:00] uh I was playing YouTube videos now my
[41:04] algorithm is set up to give me what I
[41:07] want that's usually Christian
[41:09] material I had dozed off to sleep when
[41:14] all of a sudden I heard
[41:17] this God Hates a Coward 218 says but the
[41:20] cowardly and the unbelievers murderers
[41:23] the sexually immoral Sorcerers idolators
[41:26] and all liars shall have their part in
[41:28] the Lake of Fire which is the
[41:32] second do youall get
[41:34] that Revelations
[41:38] 218 boy I'll tell you what it woke me
[41:42] up I sat straight up in bed and I was
[41:46] like oh God I'm a
[41:52] coward it
[41:55] took sometimes you know some of us
[41:58] me especially I'm a hardhead so I have
[42:01] to learn things sometimes the hard way
[42:04] God pulled the rug out from under my
[42:06] life and I'm sorry my family had to go
[42:08] through it
[42:11] but you and I cannot stop sinning you
[42:16] can't there's nothing that you can do to
[42:19] stop it's if you're you're either
[42:21] overcoming or you're
[42:23] not if you can stop a freight train you
[42:26] might have a chance it's stopping sin
[42:28] but it's not within our power I repented
[42:33] in that very moment and from that day
[42:35] forward I was set free from
[42:43] PTSD amen sister
[42:46] Amilia isn't God
[42:50] good he's healed all of us have
[42:52] testimonies all of us we could be here

[42:57] testimonies for an eternity this is just
[42:59] a little taste of
[43:12] it pleas please playar with me as I get
[43:15] older my voice gets awful or maybe it
[43:19] was always like that I'm not too sure
[43:21] but just bear with me and uh this is a
[43:24] song I want to sing it's also a testim
[43:27] of things have actually happened in my
[43:32] life there were so many others that he
[43:37] could have chosen to follow
[43:41] him others more rightous and

[43:56] woman at a

[47:58] they uh
[48:00] the just that's
[48:03] F we're we're going to make you preach
[48:06] if you
[48:10] don't the other day when the uh Citrus
[48:15] started blooming
[48:17] night I had blooms everywhere and they
[48:19] were already
[48:20] dropping and
[48:23] uh they uh I said well I need some bees
[48:29] here that these things won't produce
[48:32] anything you know
[48:35] they they do what they do but uh they uh
[48:41] so I just asked the Lord I said I need
[48:44] bees so I can have some good
[48:48] fruit and uh the next morning they were
[48:51] all
[48:52] over so uh I think the Lord he answers
[48:57] prayer even the simplest of things
[49:05] amen it's not a little
[49:07] thing yeah that's that's uh I think
[49:10] brother merley that resonated with all
[49:12] of us that was
[49:15] um these things are
[49:17] important and they're a blessing sister
[49:21] Missy God bless you everyone I'm going
[49:22] to try talking sitting down because I'm
[49:24] used to waving my arms and but you know
[49:27] I want to just talk a little bit about
[49:28] what brother Dan spoke this morning
[49:29] about God's faithfulness when I
[49:33] reconsecrated my life to the Lord it was
[49:35] shortly before um Co and I started I had
[49:41] just purchased a house and the mortgage
[49:43] was twice the amount that I had been
[49:45] previously paying and I had just been
[49:47] through a divorce and I just making it
[49:49] on my own and the company I have worked
[49:52] for for many years has always allowed us
[49:54] a lot of overtime so it's supplemented
[49:56] my income when Co hit came to a
[49:59] standstill they Lo they laid off my you
[50:02] know many of my co-workers I was
[50:04] heartbroken but the Lord knows all
[50:06] things I K my job and there was no
[50:10] overtime and I started uh putting
[50:13] offerings but not paying
[50:15] tithes and I knew I was trying to like
[50:19] finding my budget cut this cut that you
[50:21] know and just to start increasing my
[50:24] offerings to make it into a tithing
[50:27] and then one day I just said that's it
[50:29] I'm going for it I started paying my
[50:32] tithe I have never wanted for anything
[50:35] the Lord has taken care of me over and
[50:39] over again and during that covid there
[50:43] was no uh overtime so one day I got my
[50:47] first electric bill in my new big house
[50:49] and I was
[50:51] like crushed by how much it
[50:53] was and my boss emailed me there there
[50:56] had been no overtime and she says do you
[50:58] want to work a little bit of
[51:00] overtime I worked like 5 hours and it
[51:03] was almost exactly to the penny of what
[51:07] my power bill was extra that I needed to
[51:10] cover that amen that electric bill amen
[51:13] and you know God is so faithful you know
[51:15] and he
[51:16] knows everything before it matters to
[51:20] him all these small what may be a
[51:23] coincidence to somebody else but to me
[51:25] it isn't and one more thing brother Dan
[51:28] really quick like two weeks ago I lost
[51:31] my cell phone on my way to
[51:33] church the day prior I had bought a new
[51:35] iPad because my computer crashed or is
[51:38] slowly dying a painful death and I had
[51:41] just transferred all my data from my
[51:44] phone to my iPad put my phone on top of
[51:48] my car drove off to church and it fell
[51:50] off somewhere well in the business that
[51:53] I work in I need my phone because they
[51:55] they you get security passes all day
[51:57] long for different applications well I
[52:00] could feel my nerves start you know
[52:02] working up as how am I going to get
[52:04] into the company portals so I can get a
[52:08] passcode to get in and I just said I I
[52:11] said you know I can't even ask the Lord
[52:13] for these things you know because I just
[52:15] think it why does the Lord want to be
[52:18] bothered the next day I just by face
[52:21] that on my computer buts I didn't have a
[52:23] phone for 2 days and I didn't need a a
[52:26] single passcode in those two
[52:33] days on Wednesday when I got my phone
[52:37] logged in I needed a passcode after I
[52:40] got my new
[52:41] phone and the Lord is so mindful because
[52:44] he knows how I work get all worked up
[52:45] and anxious and but you know I thank the
[52:49] Lord and I'm so grateful for his
[52:51] faithfulness you know if anyone's
[52:53] undeserving I am but God is just so
[52:55] gracious to me all the time God bless
[53:03] you Sister Barbara if you could make
[53:07] ready we um Stephanie and I when we
[53:12] um we're in Jeffersonville we like
[53:16] sister
[53:17] Missy you don't have a lot of money and
[53:19] and you're appreciate it and when
[53:21] something goes
[53:22] wrong the Lord you just rely on the Lord
[53:25] to to
[53:27] help you and we always paid our tithe we
[53:29] always took that out first and there was
[53:32] a time that our refrigerator went
[53:34] out and it was 1,500
[53:38] bucks and we didn't have it we have to
[53:41] have a refrigerator so we didn't know
[53:44] what to do and it was about the same
[53:46] time that my aunt Jacqueline felt it on
[53:49] her heart to give all of her she calls
[53:53] us all her kids but all 10 of her kids
[53:56] kids she wanted to give us each
[53:59] $1,500 the exact amount of our
[54:03] refrigerator Sister

[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:28] now Sister Elizabeth we call her Missy
[1:00:32] it's my
[1:00:33] sister-in-law and there was a
[1:00:36] time that our my my sister-in-law went
[1:00:38] away from the
[1:00:40] Lord and and we saw it in all but me and
[1:00:44] my wife would pray for her and ask God
[1:00:47] to
[1:00:48] reach and there was times we
[1:00:51] wondered but greater is he than any
[1:00:54] situation amen
[1:00:56] and I know that she loves the Lord
[1:00:58] today and because of that Unice is here
[1:01:02] today amen and Shawn is here today
[1:01:05] because God answers prayer amen don't
[1:01:08] ever give up amen amen praise God thank
[1:01:16] god sister Sarah if uh there you are if
[1:01:20] you'd make ready I'm glad that I had
[1:01:22] somebody praying for me sister Missy too
[1:01:26] had a mom that loved me and Dad that
[1:01:29] loved me and they put up with a
[1:01:33] lot and I just I wish they were here now
[1:01:35] that they could come to this church and
[1:01:38] and see everything that's going on here
[1:01:41] I think it'd be a blessing to
[1:01:51] them God bless you I didn't know if I
[1:01:54] was going to sing today but I Just
[1:01:56] prayed and asked the Lord to laid it on
[1:01:59] brother Daniel's heart or the leadership
[1:02:01] of the ministry to call because it's not
[1:02:04] something that I feel very strong to
[1:02:06] come up here and say I have this
[1:02:08] testimony or that testimony but I've had
[1:02:10] these songs on my heart for a while
[1:02:12] because it seems like sometimes I just
[1:02:14] fail a lot in my life you know private
[1:02:18] things that like brother Paul was saying
[1:02:21] you just don't want to admit to you know
[1:02:23] to other people much less you know I
[1:02:25] know that God sees it and I see it and
[1:02:27] that's bad enough so um just in thinking
[1:02:31] about these things I want to Echo what
[1:02:33] we've said tonight about God really is
[1:02:35] so
[1:02:37] faithful and
[1:02:39] it's him that we can cast ourselves on
[1:02:42] his Mercy because he is
[1:02:46] merciful more merciful than we are to
[1:02:49] each other and certainly more merciful
[1:02:52] than we are to
[1:02:53] ourselves but these are songs that
[1:02:55] sometimes I sing when I'm
[1:02:58] overwhelmed um but also just crying out
[1:03:02] to God because they're actually Psalms
[1:03:04] from that David wrote and you
[1:03:08] know how many centuries have we had the
[1:03:11] Psalms but to me David shows the
[1:03:14] humanity of all of our existence when we
[1:03:17] read the Psalms he cries out so many
[1:03:20] human
[1:03:22] things good things bad things you know
[1:03:25] half the time he's just saying oh God
[1:03:28] and you know and when you consider his
[1:03:30] life he lived his life on the run for
[1:03:32] more than half of it you know in
[1:03:34] literally for his life he ran for his
[1:03:36] life taking shelter where he could
[1:03:39] didn't know who to trust didn't know and
[1:03:42] then of course we know of his S I mean
[1:03:44] would you like your book written with
[1:03:46] his sins written like his are I I have
[1:03:49] to think about that sometimes this was a
[1:03:51] man though that God really loved and he
[1:03:56] allowed him to pen words that would fit
[1:03:59] all human condition and I'm so grateful
[1:04:04] that's in my Bible because that's my
[1:04:07] saving grace too and of course you know
[1:04:10] in the New Testament we have our
[1:04:11] sacrifice David had just the Bulls and
[1:04:15] the goats and we know the types we know
[1:04:17] but we have that assurance that once and
[1:04:20] for all Christ died for our sins and I'm
[1:04:22] grateful for that today so I'm going to
[1:04:25] do this capella I didn't like I said I
[1:04:27] didn't have time to practice with anyone
[1:04:28] or do anything but um anyways these are
[1:04:32] from Psalms 5 61 and
[1:04:38] 51 give to my words oh
[1:04:45] Lord
[1:04:48] consider my
[1:04:52] meditation and hearken unto the for

[1:14:24] through high school and and I got in
[1:14:25] trouble with some of my friends and I
[1:14:28] end up down here I was driving down I
[1:14:31] was thinking about tucon I end up first
[1:14:33] I went I was sent to um Department of
[1:14:37] Correction went down to Tucson and not

[1:14:43] there I went came over here to to South
[1:14:45] Walmart or whatever was the ESS was down

[1:14:49] about it I was like
[1:14:53] man these where I got Sav save amen good
[1:14:57] so um I got there and I just started
[1:15:01] going to just just a church and it was
[1:15:04] just something different and and then
[1:15:08] um and then from there I got down to um
[1:15:12] went down to Douglas for a minimum yard
[1:15:15] right before my release and I met a
[1:15:17] brother named um I was sitting on the
[1:15:19] yard and looking looking at my little
[1:15:21] Bible and he sat next to me and talking
[1:15:24] with him and he asked me about the seven
[1:15:26] Church ages and I said I don't know what
[1:15:28] you're talking about I don't see no
[1:15:29] seven churches in here and he and then
[1:15:32] he witnessed to me about the message and
[1:15:36] he so I this where I heard the message
[1:15:39] and
[1:15:40] then and I been then I started attending
[1:15:43] Flex death Tabernacle so I've been very
[1:15:45] blessed
[1:15:47] and and I I went home and made testimony
[1:15:50] to my my family and all that but they're
[1:15:53] they don't want none of the message I
[1:15:56] don't know why but um but I'm glad to be
[1:15:59] here and here to put some testimonies to
[1:16:02] encouraging and I like it thank you
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:12] amen okay so brother Steve used to sit
[1:16:15] here when he was in the border patrol
[1:16:18] and I'd sit right here and so brother
[1:16:22] Bram was in Oakland in his first tape he
[1:16:24] said I you're going to think this is
[1:16:26] self exaltation when he talked about
[1:16:30] some of his testimonies there in Oakland
[1:16:32] the first time he went in
[1:16:34] 47 but like
[1:16:37] brother Paul I think or Ronnie said that
[1:16:41] they wanted to glorify God so if you met
[1:16:44] something you had something that really
[1:16:47] worked that helped people you'd be cruel
[1:16:49] not to share it with them right that's
[1:16:51] good yes and
[1:16:53] so I was hiking with Brother
[1:17:00] Steve and she said that say that's s
[1:17:03] about broken contrite heart you know you
[1:17:06] you don't know what it's like to be in
[1:17:08] somebody else's shoes you know you
[1:17:10] really don't you kind of can sort of
[1:17:15] but
[1:17:17] Stephen I and a bunch of others walles
[1:17:20] went down to uh have a soup by Falls
[1:17:24] Rachel were the last ones
[1:17:26] there and they had already eaten at the
[1:17:29] cafe but this brother rod sarton do you
[1:17:32] know him brother Rod sart he said can
[1:17:35] you help me find my hearing aid I said
[1:17:37] sure So we went back to the cafe we were
[1:17:40] at the hotel was about a block away and
[1:17:42] you can't there's it would rained in
[1:17:44] there and it was muddy and I thought oh
[1:17:46] if it falls in here the horses and muls
[1:17:48] are going to just put it in the mud and
[1:17:52] and I was looking on the cafe floor I
[1:17:54] laid down on theor laor and looked
[1:17:56] around I said Lord I'm sorry I couldn't
[1:17:59] oh in that tape brother Brown I'm talked
[1:18:00] about he could put the pocket knife in
[1:18:02] his hand remember in
[1:18:05] Oakland and I said Lord I'm sorry I
[1:18:08] can't put the hearing aid in my hand but
[1:18:11] don't have the faith to do that I wish I
[1:18:14] had more faith you know but I just said
[1:18:17] you can help me find it we were in there
[1:18:19] three nights I forgot all about it I
[1:18:22] told the people gave my phone number if
[1:18:24] they find the hearing a because it was
[1:18:25] expensive hearing that he
[1:18:28] said
[1:18:30] and three nights we were in there it had
[1:18:32] been raining and we were in the grass by
[1:18:34] the hotel it was kind of unkempt and
[1:18:36] Long Tall Grass and Russell was trying
[1:18:38] to get me to stay and I said no if I
[1:18:40] don't go early I had my back back on I'm
[1:18:43] waiting for my wife that's the only
[1:18:44] thing reason I hadn't gone because she
[1:18:46] hadn't come and I just looked down I
[1:18:49] felt a little ashamed because he was
[1:18:50] trying to get me to stay and be with
[1:18:53] them and pray and I just looked down at
[1:18:55] my feet because I didn't know what to
[1:18:57] say and the hearing aid was right
[1:18:58] between my
[1:19:00] feet I picked it up and I handed it to
[1:19:03] Russell you know but my point in saying
[1:19:06] all that is if you pray a
[1:19:09] prayer don't give up on God you don't I
[1:19:12] mean he won't give up on you you don't
[1:19:14] have to worry but he'll do he'll answer
[1:19:16] anybody's prayer I really seen that I've
[1:19:18] seen these people out here telling me
[1:19:20] testimonies they're on fentol and
[1:19:22] they're living in adultery and just
[1:19:24] garbage and God still answers their
[1:19:27] prayers so why can't we get some prayers
[1:19:32] you know that's my point no I'm not
[1:19:34] saying but we just have to believe and
[1:19:36] and think when Jesus okay the disciples
[1:19:39] said increase our faith he told him a
[1:19:41] story about the man working first he
[1:19:43] said the benefits of Faith but then he
[1:19:45] said at the
[1:19:47] end he said likewise say I'm an
[1:19:51] unprofitable servant remember he told
[1:19:54] the story about the man working so my
[1:19:56] point my take on that what do you think
[1:19:58] is that you're not we're none of us are
[1:20:00] worthy when you think you're worthy and
[1:20:03] and then that goes along with the two
[1:20:04] Gentiles the the the um the um Centurion
[1:20:10] I'm not worthy that you come under my
[1:20:12] roof speak the words and then the other
[1:20:15] lady she let him call him a dog her a
[1:20:17] dog right and she just kept coming so it
[1:20:21] I that's what I'm trying to say is you
[1:20:23] know I'm slow
[1:20:25] Chris he diagnosed me I said he said' I
[1:20:27] can tell you about everybody and I said
[1:20:28] tell me about me he saidou slow and
[1:20:31] sloppy he did it
[1:20:34] right he's not going to diagnose
[1:20:37] me because I don't wantan to I don't
[1:20:40] want to know let me uh brother Arie was
[1:20:43] he was talking about this I'll come
[1:20:45] around he was talking about finding that
[1:20:48] hearing aid brother Billy Paul shared a
[1:20:49] testimony with me one time he was he was
[1:20:52] at the
[1:20:53] beach and and he was there all day and
[1:20:56] he came back to his hotel room and he
[1:20:58] saw that his wedding
[1:21:01] ring it was either his or his wife's I
[1:21:03] think it was his wife's wedding ring was
[1:21:07] gone at the beach all day having no idea
[1:21:12] where it was and they were really
[1:21:15] upset and brother Billy Paul he
[1:21:19] said you know how many miracles he he
[1:21:23] seen
[1:21:25] and he walked out of the hotel room he
[1:21:28] walked down to the beach where they were
[1:21:31] he kneeled down in the sand he dug his
[1:21:35] hands down in the sand and he picked it
[1:21:37] up and there was the ring
[1:21:41] wow yeah brother Billy Paul told me that
[1:21:44] testimony
[1:21:48] personally I get really scared to do
[1:21:50] this I don't know why I love all you
[1:21:52] people but I just get so nervous but um
[1:21:57] first of all I had a wonderful
[1:22:01] afternoon being a widow I just have a
[1:22:04] little dog that with me and it'll be 5
[1:22:08] years come June the 21st that Rod went
[1:22:13] to be with the Lord I know he's happy
[1:22:16] there and I just miss him I guess but I
[1:22:21] know he's doing all right and I'm doing
[1:22:23] better I know I know the Lord is helping
[1:22:25] me each day but so much for me but I had
[1:22:30] a great day today I went over to brother
[1:22:34] Lyle and sister Heather's house which is
[1:22:37] spectacular they have a beautiful house
[1:22:40] and the backyard is full of
[1:22:42] flowers and we had the best meal I mean
[1:22:46] I ate so much food which I probably
[1:22:49] shouldn't ate so much but it was so good
[1:22:53] and I just thank them so much they're
[1:22:55] just lovely Christians I feel like I I'm
[1:22:59] so
[1:23:02] nothing compared to
[1:23:05] them but I did enjoy myself so much and
[1:23:10] I appreciate them and love them and what
[1:23:13] brother Lyle is doing is so wonderful
[1:23:15] and and sister Heather such a hospitable
[1:23:19] person and I would like to be more like
[1:23:21] that
[1:23:22] but you know just try but anyway this
[1:23:28] little thing happened and it's really
[1:23:31] kind of simple I'm just kind of a simple
[1:23:34] person but this blessed me I told Daniel
[1:23:38] Dan about it and uh Dan Jr is staying
[1:23:42] with me and he was he was busy that day
[1:23:45] and and so I needed my five gallon water
[1:23:49] I have four of them they're really can
[1:23:50] be heavy when they're full of water and
[1:23:53] I needed them to to be filled and he was
[1:23:55] gone and so I said I'm a little red hand
[1:23:58] I can do this and so I put him in the
[1:24:01] car and it went to the little place but
[1:24:03] on the way I said I didn't I just said
[1:24:07] Lord wouldn't it be nice if you could
[1:24:10] just find a strong man that would just
[1:24:13] say oh would could I help you with that
[1:24:17] water and put it in your car and I'm
[1:24:21] telling you I was sticking the money in
[1:24:23] the saying I was having a hard time
[1:24:25] dollar bill it wouldn't go in real good
[1:24:27] and this man come up big strong dude and
[1:24:31] um and he got out of the car and he saw
[1:24:34] us having a little trouble and he says
[1:24:36] you know ma'am K those those water jugs
[1:24:40] are way too heavy for you can I put them
[1:24:43] in your car and I said oh thank you Lord
[1:24:49] and I said you don't know I just prayed
[1:24:51] a prayer and I said I didn't ask in any
[1:24:54] way I just said wouldn't it be nice Lord
[1:24:56] if you could find somebody like this and
[1:24:59] he did it I am so grateful for the Lord
[1:25:02] Jesus he takes care of me I'm so
[1:25:05] grateful thank
[1:25:07] you
[1:25:09] amen I can testify that anytime you go
[1:25:12] over to Lyall and Heathers it's a good
[1:25:14] day
[1:25:17] amen any more testimonies before sister
[1:25:20] Jessica we have one over here
[1:25:29] who
[1:25:32] okay so Jeremy wants me to tell you this
[1:25:35] testimony so two days
[1:25:38] ago um Brother Ray Thomas called me and
[1:25:41] he's like sister Angela the chickens all
[1:25:44] have swollen necks and uh they look like
[1:25:48] they're going to die I said like one or
[1:25:51] two and he said no all 53 of them
[1:25:55] and I was
[1:25:57] like being raised on a farm I kind of
[1:25:59] know some information so I called my mom
[1:26:02] and she's like yeah it could be this
[1:26:04] this or this and I was like you know I'm
[1:26:06] just going to pray so Brother Ray myself
[1:26:09] my parents and my husband we just agreed
[1:26:13] and said Lord this is uh income from
[1:26:16] Brother Ray that we've been helping him
[1:26:18] with and we just rebuke the enemy for
[1:26:23] whatever he's trying to do and the next
[1:26:26] day I called Brother Ray up and he said
[1:26:29] I'm too scared to go out there and I
[1:26:31] said go out there they're okay and he
[1:26:34] goes okay I'll go and he steps out the
[1:26:37] door and he hears the chicken clucking
[1:26:39] and he goes they're okay
[1:26:41] Angela and so he walked out there and he
[1:26:43] said there's no swollen necks
[1:26:46] everything's good and he said I don't
[1:26:48] know what it was and I said I'm not
[1:26:50] going to claim it but I believe God took
[1:26:52] care of it so
[1:26:59] amen anybody else brother the
[1:27:03] Paul I've been thinking about it I'd
[1:27:05] like to finish my
[1:27:07] story how long has this just a
[1:27:13] second um the detail that I left out was
[1:27:17] that just so your imaginations don't
[1:27:22] wander um in
[1:27:25] 2016 on the same day I lost my home my
[1:27:30] job and my church the support of my
[1:27:34] church and that was probably the hardest
[1:27:38] day of my
[1:27:39] life
[1:27:41] so it all happened so that God could
[1:27:45] Purge and cleanse me from that fear that
[1:27:48] I didn't even know was there I mean I
[1:27:50] was at that time Spirit-filled but it
[1:27:53] was something that
[1:27:54] I had
[1:27:55] just maybe swept under the rug but I
[1:28:00] just wanted to add that detail just so
[1:28:02] your imaginations don't wander but also
[1:28:05] to put to put emphasis on that again you
[1:28:08] know you cannot stop sinning I have been
[1:28:11] there before I've I've said I'm
[1:28:13] struggling with something and you think
[1:28:15] that you're maybe doing good some days
[1:28:17] and you're doing bad other days there's
[1:28:19] no such thing you're either overcoming
[1:28:21] or you're
[1:28:22] not it's through repentance rep towards
[1:28:25] Jesus Christ and when he delivers you
[1:28:28] you are an
[1:28:35] overcomer it
[1:28:37] was it was about three years ago that I
[1:28:41] was at the car
[1:28:42] wash and um me and Stephanie were there
[1:28:47] and uh I said honey there's a sister
[1:28:52] there and uh
[1:28:55] I said let's go say hi to her
[1:28:57] and so we uh we stopped and and it was
[1:29:02] Sister andreana i' never I hadn't seen
[1:29:04] her in about 20 years I
[1:29:06] think and we had a
[1:29:10] conversation and I got to tell you that
[1:29:14] it was brother Paul I think it was from
[1:29:17] that
[1:29:18] point that I
[1:29:21] really got such a strong burden for this
[1:29:26] church I've never been here before I
[1:29:29] umum just a little here and there but
[1:29:33] when I met sister andreana there at the
[1:29:35] car wash something happened in
[1:29:39] me and I don't know what it was it's
[1:29:43] like maybe that widow
[1:29:45] woman that God commanded her to feed
[1:29:50] Elijah maybe that was the time that God
[1:29:54] God had commanded me to serve you all
[1:29:57] here at the Tabernacle so I know the
[1:29:59] Murray family they're they're precious
[1:30:01] to me and brother Paul has been a good
[1:30:04] friend and and um it's awesome isn't it
[1:30:10] it's just it's just
[1:30:11] [Applause]
[1:30:14] great sister
[1:30:16] Jessica did she chicking out what's
[1:30:19] what's that oh oh she's up there okay
[1:30:28] um so about a year ago I was um battling
[1:30:32] I had a really bad cough that I had for
[1:30:34] six months and I couldn't get rid of it
[1:30:37] and the Lord showed me that it was the
[1:30:38] enemy that was putting something on me
[1:30:41] so I had prayed and asked the Lord I
[1:30:44] said Lord you know what's going on
[1:30:46] you're aware of it I said if the pastor
[1:30:49] or whoever's ministering can just
[1:30:52] mention this scripture
[1:30:54] then I'll know that it's all in your
[1:30:56] hands and you're going to take care of
[1:30:57] it even if they just mention it refer to
[1:31:00] it they don't have to read it and so
[1:31:02] when we got here to church um the pastor
[1:31:05] read one scripture and it was that
[1:31:09] scripture and so I had went to the
[1:31:12] doctor um and because I still couldn't
[1:31:15] get rid of it and they gave me some
[1:31:18] antibiotics they gave me bronchitis but
[1:31:21] they gave me antibiotics cuz they said
[1:31:23] that they saw something in the xray on
[1:31:25] my right side and ever since then I've
[1:31:28] always felt that pain on my right side
[1:31:31] well about two weeks ago brother Dan had
[1:31:34] everyone I had been prayed for by
[1:31:36] brother Dan and other brothers that were
[1:31:38] our men of God so I just held on to that
[1:31:41] even though I would always feel the pain
[1:31:43] um so two weeks ago brother Dan at the
[1:31:46] end of service had everyone lay hands on
[1:31:49] each other and pray for them and I could
[1:31:53] I was standing in between sister
[1:31:56] um I forgot her name sister I'm sorry
[1:32:00] sister Shirley and sister hope and I
[1:32:03] could really feel the prayers that they
[1:32:06] were praying for me while I was praying
[1:32:09] for them and last week I had to go to
[1:32:12] the ER I had a pain somewhere else that
[1:32:15] I couldn't um bear so I went and they
[1:32:18] took an x-ray and I told the doctor that
[1:32:21] they had seen something in the X-ray and
[1:32:24] he said wow he says we don't know what
[1:32:26] it is he said everything that we see he
[1:32:28] says I don't see anything in your X-ray
[1:32:30] your kidneys are healthy and
[1:32:33] everything's good so it was a muscular
[1:32:35] pain that I had but I just praise God
[1:32:38] because I know that he healed me
[1:32:41] [Applause]
[1:32:46] completely there's a lot of verses in
[1:32:48] that
[1:32:51] book you don't just choose one after a
[1:32:55] sister
[1:32:56] praise and turn right to that scripture
[1:33:00] sister that nothing but the hand of the
[1:33:03] Lord is there anyone
[1:33:08] else sister
[1:33:10] Heather okay
[1:33:23] I'm sure all of you have had desires of
[1:33:26] your heart and you just have them in
[1:33:27] your heart you commit it to the lord
[1:33:29] well I have for quite a while wanted to
[1:33:32] connect with our oldest son and just
[1:33:35] have some time with him and so I just I
[1:33:38] knew we were too busy we had this we had
[1:33:40] that we're going to be it just didn't
[1:33:43] seem possible but about two weeks before
[1:33:47] my birthday last the other week uh L
[1:33:50] just out of the blue says hey how about
[1:33:52] for your your birthday would you like to
[1:33:54] go see Samuel I had not told him I had
[1:33:57] not I because I knew we were busy and it
[1:34:00] was be asking a bit over the top but he
[1:34:03] said how would you like to go I said yes
[1:34:07] yes I would like to go and so then that
[1:34:11] was exciting I thought Bo I'm going and
[1:34:13] then all of a sudden my back kinked and
[1:34:17] I couldn't hardly sit on my seat here at
[1:34:20] church and I thought how in the world
[1:34:23] can we go I can't sit in this airplane
[1:34:25] for all this time and have my back out
[1:34:30] so uh sister Rachel was Rachel Getta was
[1:34:34] sitting next to me and in church and she
[1:34:39] just when prayer was made for others she
[1:34:42] put her hand on me and okay and then
[1:34:45] several other sisters agreed that they
[1:34:47] were going to pray for me and I went on
[1:34:49] that trip had the most marvelous time
[1:34:51] connected with that precious son and so
[1:34:54] he gives you the desires of your heart
[1:34:57] because he sees inside and he knows he's
[1:35:00] so
[1:35:03] [Applause]
[1:35:05] precious the Bible says when we
[1:35:09] pray that in the Book of Romans chapter
[1:35:12] 8 that it's not us that's praying it's
[1:35:16] the desires of the Holy Spirit and then
[1:35:18] the holy spirit is praying that through
[1:35:21] us with words that can't even be uttered
[1:35:25] so sister I believe that that was not
[1:35:28] necessarily sister Heather I believe
[1:35:30] that was the Holy Spirit praying that
[1:35:33] sister
[1:35:36] Jessica would like to share a little
[1:35:39] testimony and also a prayer request or a
[1:35:43] prayer that the testimony I'm going to
[1:35:45] give will one day walk through these
[1:35:48] doors um a cousin of mine that grew up
[1:35:51] with us she lived with us for probably
[1:35:54] 12 years or more she was like a sister
[1:35:57] to me and um we had a falling out in the
[1:36:00] family and we hadn't spoken to her in or
[1:36:03] I hadn't spoken to her in
[1:36:04] years but a few months ago she
[1:36:08] um had a medical emergency
[1:36:11] and since none of the family she wasn't
[1:36:14] speaking to any of us it was actually
[1:36:15] one of her co-workers that called um my
[1:36:18] sister to tell her that that my cousin
[1:36:22] hadn't reported to work so
[1:36:24] my parents um hurried down to her
[1:36:26] apartment and they found her in a very
[1:36:29] bad situation they rushed her to the
[1:36:31] hospital and they by all accounts she
[1:36:33] should have died um but God spared her
[1:36:37] and um she did lose her leg they had to
[1:36:40] amputate her right
[1:36:43] foot um but in all this
[1:36:47] um there's been
[1:36:49] reconciliation with the family and
[1:36:52] that's been amazing
[1:36:54] and I'm just praying for wisdom that we
[1:36:56] can speak the words to her that will
[1:36:58] bring her here bring her to to any
[1:37:01] church but would love to see her here um
[1:37:04] but just to even see how God has
[1:37:05] softened her heart through all of this
[1:37:08] so God bless you

[1:40:39] God bless you guys I have a testimony
[1:40:42] before my song today it's a testimony
[1:40:45] from work I feel like every time I get
[1:40:47] to work uh the Lord just does something
[1:40:50] to let let me know that he's with me I
[1:40:52] work
[1:40:53] so the other day I was at work and I we
[1:40:57] had this admission and it was this man
[1:40:59] and he was he was really sick he had
[1:41:01] just got a heart attack he just came
[1:41:02] from the ICU and the unit I work on down
[1:41:05] we're kind of like a step down unit from
[1:41:07] the ICU so most patients we get they're
[1:41:10] just really sick you know they're
[1:41:12] they're they're very close to death or
[1:41:13] they're on the bed on the on the mend
[1:41:16] but whatever the case is they're sick
[1:41:18] and so we get this guy and he was on the
[1:41:20] tra he was he just had a heart attack
[1:41:22] and he was just kind of fighting for his
[1:41:24] life and so I see him and I get done
[1:41:27] with my shift and I don't work for like
[1:41:28] another week and then I I see him the
[1:41:31] next week and he's up he's talking he's
[1:41:34] just doing so much better and I look at
[1:41:38] him I was like I was like man I was like
[1:41:39] you're doing so good he was like I know
[1:41:41] look at me he was like I'm walking I was
[1:41:43] like a I was like you're crazy man and
[1:41:45] so me and him get to talking and I asked
[1:41:47] him I said I said what do what are you
[1:41:49] going to do when you get out of here and
[1:41:52] he was a truck driver before and I said
[1:41:53] are you going to go back to truck
[1:41:54] driveing and he looked at me and he kind
[1:41:56] of thought for a second he says you know
[1:41:58] what Daniel he says he's like the lord
[1:42:00] gave me extra time on this Earth he was
[1:42:03] like I just want to give that extra time
[1:42:05] to him and he said that not knowing I'm
[1:42:07] a Christian not knowing anything about
[1:42:09] me and I was like just praise the Lord
[1:42:11] man I was like I'm a Christian I said
[1:42:13] God bless you I was like there's nothing
[1:42:15] better you can do with your life than
[1:42:16] that and so I just want to give give
[1:42:18] glory to God for his testimony today

[1:48:13] ly I didn't really know them when we
[1:48:16] came to the Tabernacle they had come and
[1:48:18] go on maybe maybe the beginning the boys
[1:48:20] were in
[1:48:21] school and we had that going way party
[1:48:24] and we played football with your
[1:48:26] boys and they beat me up pretty
[1:48:29] good and I didn't see him for a long
[1:48:31] time
[1:48:33] and brother Lyle came back and was here
[1:48:38] I just felt to encourage brother
[1:48:41] Lyall to to do something with what he
[1:48:44] had to
[1:48:46] give I had no idea of his history where
[1:48:49] they'd been nothing just encourage him
[1:48:52] began to share his
[1:48:55] heart and today because he was able to
[1:48:59] do that and just God just I didn't give
[1:49:01] it to him it was
[1:49:03] there and look what a blessing it's been
[1:49:06] yes amen I'm going to share this I don't
[1:49:09] mean to embarrass him or

[1:49:17] and we were
[1:49:18] invited and his boys came up to me and

[1:49:24] idea for

[1:49:35] shared later he said he was involved
[1:49:37] with his work he was involved with what
[1:49:39] he's doing and if I had time to go to
