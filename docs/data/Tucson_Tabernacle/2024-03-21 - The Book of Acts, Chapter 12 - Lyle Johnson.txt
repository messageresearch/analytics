to be going on and then that the staff will determine God's will in it you know friends there's no reason our brother Lyle tonight is going to preach on the book of Acts there is no reason that these promises that are in this book cannot manifest themselves today in our lives I was listening to a tape this morning and I got through almost the whole thing it was just tremendous brother Branham it was in 1951. brother Branham was teaching on principles of Divine Healing and he was he was giving testimonies and he said he said and here's Georgia Carter over here and he starts talking about the testimony of Georgia Carter how she was crippled for so many years she had I believe it was tuberculosis and she was bedrid written she couldn't do anything he said the he said the bed frame where her leg was where she was just agonizing pain and rub it she said it was he said it was rubbed smooth I've seen that very bed I've put my hand on that very bed that was rubbed smooth where Georgia Carter laid all of those years in pain then brother Branham he was talking about a couple other testimonies and the people in the audience he said here's my mom over here he said she was there when that light came into the room when I was born up in the hills of Kentucky and he said oh and here's the doctor that that I believe was a doctor I think he got it right was the doctor with Georgia Carter and gave witness and then he says oh and here's brother Upshaw Congressman Upshaw and he gives the testimony of Congressman Upshaw he was in the congregation there and he said Brother come on up and give a testimony and Congressman Upshaw was in the Tabernacle and came up and gave the testimony of his healing being crippled for I believe 66 years I could be wrong about that but it was a bunch they're the what man was right there came up and gave the testimony and brother Upshaw was was just rejoicing about how much he loved the Lord Jesus and all that had been done for him I'll tell you what I was just listening I love brother branham's message you know it's he didn't just talk about this book he put it into action and he showed that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he can still do Miracles he was talking about on that same message he was talking about a uh a young lady called her the nail girl n-a-i-l she was um crippled leaving her legging in her hand from some sort of arthritis brother Branham and she may have even been there brother Brandon said when he prayed for us he was immediately immediately healed of of what was going wrong with her I talked to a friend of mine and she was from a place called Salem Indiana it's about I don't know about an hour away from Jeffersonville a friend of mine was uh he was up there and he was just talking to people and he said have you ever heard of this nail girl I think she said yeah I know the family and my friend said have you ever heard of William Brannon and she said well yeah she said I have and it was either her grandmother or her mother I think her mother was in the hospital dying of cancer told this testimony before but I'm going to tell it again it's great but the silence you hadn't heard it yet so her her mother was in the hospital dying of cancer in the hospital room and there was a lady next to her on the other side of the curtain and she was she was in in bed she had two friends her two friends and this lady was dying too her two friends heard about brother branham's Ministry so they made the trip to Jeffersonville as I said about an hour they went to Jeffersonville and they were in the audience brother Branham was going through the audience and he says you you two sisters he said there is a you are praying for your friend who's in the hospital who's dying of cancer and she they both Rejoice this they said that's that's what we're praying for he said take that handkerchief I don't have one he said take that handkerchief that's that's in your purse or whoever was pull it out take that handkerchief and go and tell tell her to lay it on in her undergarment according to the book of Acts chapter 19 according that they took garments from the Apostle Paul and laid them on the sick and they received their healing so they took they took the handkerchief brother Jeremy they took it back to the hospital and they brought it to the lady and the lady their friend was embarrassed brother Cedric she wasn't she didn't believe in it it's written here in this book she didn't believe in it he said well yeah I don't I don't really want to do that and they uh they tried to convince their friend she wouldn't do it so this other lady that was on the other side of the curtain she pulls back the curtain she says I'll take it and that lady was healed in the name of the Lord Jesus and the other one died and she gave birth to this lady and gave that testimony to my friend eyewitness God still does Miracles that same God that was alive back there in 1950 is the same God that's alive today he's the same God that can hear heal brother Glenn he's the same God that can help your dad brother Silas he is the same God that can take all of our needs that we have we can lay them upon him and we can receive what we have need of do you have a need tonight raise your hand in the name of the Lord and he sees it let's bow our heads Lord Jesus I just feel good tonight

Christ God bless you all as you can see but allow if you come as you can see I'm excited to hear what the Lord has has for us [Music] good evening praise the Lord tonight we'll continue our exploration of the book of Acts this time our study is Acts 12. it's a short chapter only about 25 verses and but it divides into four parts it starts with a persecution of the church in Jerusalem This Time by Herod second is Peter's deliverance from prison next we see judgment fall on Herod and lastly to focus shifts from Jerusalem and Peter back to Antioch with Saul and his companions to set the stage for brother Daniel in Acts 13. but before we open our Bibles let's pray together one more time Lord Jesus it is such a humbling thing to stand here before saints of God purchased by your blood that terrible price that you paid on Calvary Lord that you willingly paid not my will but fine be done Lord I pray this evening Lord that you would be present in our midst that you'd continue to be present in our midst that you'd anoint the words that are spoken your words from your book lord anoint our ears to hear to receive Lord help me to not be here but that you would be here and Lord help me to be yielded to you help us each one to be yielded to you forgive us where we fall short we're so looking forward to this evening in Jesus name amen while we're standing please turn in your Bibles to our introductory verses found in Acts 11. recall that a group of Believers from Jerusalem had come to Antioch in Syria including some who were Prophets one of them a brother named agabus foretold of a famine a great dearth throughout all the world is how the King James Bible puts it we learned that the word translated as World means land and to a Jewish person all the land meant it would strike the region of Judea Samaria and Galilee the land acts 11 29 then the disciples that is the Christians in Antioch every man according to his ability believed the prophecy and determined to send relief Aid money a collection under the Brethren which dwelt in Judea which also they did they didn't just talk about it they put action to it and they sent it to the Elders of the church in Jerusalem by the hands of Barnabas and Saul and we recall that Barnabas if anyone could be trusted with money Barnabas could be trusted with money please be seated we see the geographic focus of Luke's narrative is Shifting now at the conclusion of Acts 11 from Antioch back to Jerusalem well let's continue then with acts 12 verse 1 we read now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to Vex certain of the church does that confuse you at all apart from a reference to Herod condemning Jesus in Acts 4 during prayer seeking boldness to proclaim the gospel acts 12 is the first mention of Herod in the book of Acts now Luke 1 mentions Herod the king but Luke 3 mentions Herod the tetrarch do you find this confusing did Herod die after Mary and Joseph fled to Egypt with the Infant Jesus Matthew's gospel tells us Matthew 2 13 and when they it's the ones that we call the three wise men were departed were departed from Joseph and Mary and Jesus and from herod's Jerusalem behold the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord appears many times in our uh in chapter 12 tonight even appeared to Joseph in a dream saying arise take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt flee run for your very lives be thou there stay there don't even think about coming back until I bring the word for Herod will search for the young child to murder him when Joseph arose this was a dream he was sleeping he was commanded to arise and that's exactly what he did he didn't go back to sleep he didn't dilly dally he took the young child Jesus and his mother Mary by night that same night and they departed into Egypt and was there they remained there until the death of Herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt have I called my son skipping to verse 19 but when Herod was dead behold an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph who was still living with the family in Egypt saying arise take the young child and his mother and go don't flee you're not running for your life just go into the land of Israel for they're dead including Herod the King which sought the young child's life so is Herod dead or a city if so how is he alive in Acts 12 some 40 years after he died in Matthew 2. what about John the Baptist confronting Herod over his wife which eventually cost John his life what about when pilate sent Jesus to Herod before condemning him to death some 30 plus years after Herod had died Luke the same Felder who wrote The Acts tells us in Luke 23 and they Jesus accusers were the more fierce saying to Pilate he Jesus stirs up the people playing on Rome's fear of the Mob We recall throughout the New Testament narratives that that the Romans really wanted peace pox Romana they didn't want the crowd stirred up in Rome City of a million people first time that had ever happened it didn't happen again for almost two thousand years certainly more than 1900. that they were afraid of the mob so they tried to appease the mob Okay so switching throughout all jewry beginning From Galilee to this place Jerusalem when pilate heard mention of Galilee he asked whether Jesus were a Galilean and as soon as pilate knew that Jesus belonged unto herod's jurisdiction He sent Jesus to Herod who himself also is a Jerusalem at that time of the Passover skipping down to verse 11 Herod with his Men of War set Jesus at naught mocked him arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again the pilot now the Contemporary audience for whom Luke's text was written would probably have understood all these references to various men all of which are called Herod but it's at least mildly confusing for some of us today we find in the Bible that a king of Egypt is rarely named he's just generally called Pharaoh which is a title it's his office it means he's the king similar to the Emperors of Romer rarely named it's usually just Caesar this or Caesar that well what about Herod is this a title is it a name it's a name what's the name of a person the first Herod founded a dynasty a succession sometimes the rest of the name is given often not it's like me being brother Johnson of which there are many instead of brother Lyle Johnson which limits the number dramatically let's try and unravel this a bit get a little context here so when you're reading from the gospels or acts during your devotions at home you'll have a better idea of who's being referred to what what's going on here when we studied acts 11 we recall that Antiochus for a profanus had a pig sacrifice on the altar Jerusalem the result of this was the maccabean uprising this led to the establishment of a period of Independence in Israel under what became known as the hasmanian dynasty Jewish descendants of The Maccabees from about 140 BC until about 63 BC when Israel became a client state of Rome the housmanians conquered the areas around them and among those areas in the south near Beersheba is a region then known as urumiya the people there were converted to Judaism but usually considered by Outsiders considered to be Outsiders by ethnic Jews well there was a man from irumaya named Herod he married into the hasmonean family and in 47 BC he was made governor of the region of Galilee by Rome around 40 BC the Roman senate greatly expanded his territory and declared him King of Judea now a semi-autonomous state I've put up here a map of the kingdom of Herod the Great I've marked irumia and the South there with an arrow and I've circled Jerusalem to give you a little bit of an idea to geography here so this first Herod this fellow 40 BC is generally known as Herod the Great he's known for many massive Public Works projects enlarging the temple in Jerusalem he's also known for being cruel brutal paranoid he's the Herod of Matthew too that killed the infant boys in Bethlehem and a failed attempt to kill Jesus and from whom Joseph and his family fled to Egypt now this fellow Herod the Great had at least eight wives that we know of some of whom he later had killed some of his children not all but some of his children were killed on his orders too this guy was utterly paranoid and just even weeks before he died he had some of his sons killed he was a ruthless tyrant in fact when he knew he was dying he gave orders that a large number of people would be rounded up and when he died they'd be killed that would result and everybody crying and weeping him because he knew that nobody would care if he died otherwise that's the only way that he'd have sympathy at his funeral this is uh this is a very uh ruthless fellow Caesar Augustus left him in power because Herod the Great was very effective keeping the population under control it's always top priority this allowed Rome to focus its military efforts elsewhere Augustus is said to have remarked it's better to be herod's Pig than herod's son by this he meant that under Jewish dietary law herod's Pig would be safe from Slaughter whereas his son's lives were at risk from their own father the Great rule from about 40 BC until his death believed to be in four BC some say it was 2 BC well after he died his kingdom was split it was split into four pieces his sons became three rulers of three of the pieces and his sister the fourth so they were called tetrarchs where you see in the Bible so and so tetrarch it means that they're a rule of the fourth part so if we take a look at this we see to the north and in light blue here is a territory ruled by Philip one of his sons he's mentioned in the gospels bethsaida on the North Shore of the Sea of Galilee is part of Philip's territory you'll notice in the gospel sometimes the disciples go between they go to bethsaida rather than staying in Capernaum for example because it's under a different jurisdiction if things get a little hot in Capernaum go to peseta things that a lot him to say to go to Capernaum it's different it's like switching counties or something if you've broken a county law you can we're not going to go there okay uh so Philip ruled until about 34 A.D Capernaum and Nazareth are part of the territory of Galilee ruled by another son Herod Antipas that's shown there in pale green the Galilee he also ruled this territory down here which is called perea and modern Jordan Antipas is called Herod in the Gospels he's one of the guys that leads to some confusion he's the Herod that married his brother Philip's wife herodias and who eventually ordered the execution of John the Baptist Antipas was also the Herod we just read about at the time of Jesus crucifixion Antipas ruled until 39 A.D when he was deposed and exiled by the Roman Emperor Caligula the large region shown in Salmon or pink was briefly ruled by Herod the Great's son arkalaus he's the one Joseph avoided when returning from Egypt he's very unpopular extremely cruel in fact he was so bad he was so mean that Rome removed him from power in 680. made Judea a province and appointed a succession of Governors over it one of whom was Pontius Pilate Herod the Great sister Salome ruled some small areas that I marked here circled in red and until she died at about 10 A.D let's get up to Herod Agrippa this is the territory of a fellow known as King Herod Agrippa Herod the Great had another surviving son but he didn't rule as a tetrock he was a fellow named aristobulus IV there won't be an exam it's okay but aristobula's son Herod the Great's grandson came to be a king not just a ruler not just a tetrarch and this is Herod Agrippa he's the fellow that we just met in Acts chapter 12. his territory started very small this little piece up here and 37 he got the green stuff which was a territory that his uncle Philip used to rule in 39 A.D Herod Antipas was exiled in his territory was added to agrippa's that's the purple stuff finally in 41 A.D with the accession of Claudius in Rome Herod Agrippa added the territory of the province of Judea this whole thing this combined territory was no longer considered a province but a nation-state obligated to Rome and until his death in 44 Herod Agrippa was King Judea I've circled the cities of Jerusalem caesarea tire and sidon because they all play a part in what we're going to read in Acts 12. no geography quiz either it's okay when Herod Agrippa died the status of much of the territory was returned to provinces ruled Again by Governors and so forth now there's one other guy that comes in here that adds to the confusion a little bit and this is when Paul appears before a man named Agrippa in Acts 25 and 26 well this is not Herod Agrippa of Acts 12. it's his son a group of Junior a grip of the second but in the book of Acts he's just called Agrippa so when act says Agrippa it doesn't mean Herod Agrippa it says Herod when it means Herod Agrippa but it says Agrippa what it means Herod Agrippa too everybody got that okay so Herod produce territory did not include the province soon in Darker green on the map so I outlined in Redwood his territory was a group of two ruled from about 4880 till he fled as the Jewish Revolt unfolded in 66 A.D after his unsuccessful attempts to calm things down this is the Revolt that led to the destruction of the Temple he fled to Rome he lived until 90 or 100 A.D and he became a source for Josephus they corresponded some of his letters are in some of Josephus books and was a source for Josephus of now did this really happen this way okay let's get past the geography before your eyes glaze over and the snoring gets too loud I made this little diagram give you a little bit of a family tree to show the portions of the rhodian dynasty that we discussed with their relationships and and yellow are the names that are used in the Bible referring to those people so you can see there's three different herods there's arkalaus there's Philip there's Herod Agrippa who's a grandson in parenthesis if it says sister son grandson or great-grandson that's the relationship to Herod the Great so now that you've had all of that we'll condense it back down the only guy we're concerned about in Acts 12 is this guy Herod Agrippa grandson of Herod the Great he's the Herod of Acts 12. Antipas is exiled and so forth okay so I've managed to use how many minutes and we're still on verse one we'll be out before midnight trust me okay let's get back to acts acts 12. let's let's go now we've got some context here now about that time now what is that time after agabus came to Antioch and prophesied Paul and Barnabas were sent to Jerusalem to deliver the aid collected for the church as a result of that prophecy about that time Herod Agrippa the king stretched forth his hands to Vex certain of the church to to persecute to oppress to torment and he Herod Agrippa through his soldiers killed James the brother of John now this is not James who's the leader of the church in Jerusalem this is the James that was on the Mount of transfiguration this is the James who along with John and his and their mother tried to get Jesus to commit to them sitting on either side of him when he came to power in his kingdom and Jesus said can you drink the cup that I'm going to drink and they said we can and he said you will but I still can't tell you who's going to sit next to me okay and it seems to me that we're so close to Memorial Day that this helps remind us in the even in the context of our time this week of the great price that has been paid to bring us the gospel to bring us this this Faith this life this word of Truth so Herod Agrippa because he saw that killing James please the Jews that's the Jewish people the judeans we're not told why they were happy Herod Agrippa proceeded further to take Peter to seize him to arrest him and we're told then were the days of unleavened bread so this was Passover how many years do you think of elapsed from acts 1 1 to acts 12 1. three years maybe five years maybe a little more context a little more history according to Josephus Herod Agrippa was in Rome at the time of the emperor Caligula's assassination which was January 24th of the year 41. Josephus tells us that Herod Agrippa was instrumental in securing Claudius accession to the throne of the empire Caligula is killed Claudius becomes the emperor Herod Agrippa is one of the guys that facilitates his rise to power now whether he had time from January 24th to do all the political stuff that he did to get authority over these additional territories to be declared King by the Senate to address the Senate to take a ship in the winter I don't know what the meds like in the winter come to Judea secure his enlarged domain get to Jerusalem and have James killed by March 22nd that's when Passover was in the year 41. it's unlikely maybe possible Church Traditions claim that Herod Agrippa came to Jerusalem in 4380 to observe Passover and it was during that visit that he killed James and imprisoned Peter so whether it was almost immediately after his obsession to this power in 41 or whether it was a couple of years later we don't really know but but from this we can say that that this period of Acts that we've already covered is at least eight and probably more than 10 years of church history of elapsed and the amount of Acts that we have read so far it also helps us identify a boundary for the prophecy of agabus that we read about in Acts 11 about that time and verse 1 again is when Barnabas and Saul are transferring the collection from Antioch to Jerusalem might have been as late as 43 A.D the famine occurred in 44 or 45 A.D okay let's see if we can get to verse 4. and when Herod Agrippa had apprehended Peter he put him in prison and delivered into four quaternions of soldiers to keep him that's four squads of Four soldiers each so he's got 16 soldiers Garden Peter Herod Agrippa we're told is intending after Easter to bring Peter forth to the people another kangaroo trial and other execution makes the people happy right 16 soldiers tasked to keep watch over one person chained in a dungeon Peter therefore was kept under heavy guard in prison however little did Herod Agrippa know not that he would have cared at the time that prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for Peter it wasn't one and done they didn't say oh yeah Lord help Peter I've got to go out and attend my garden no these people were sincere now we shift our Focus from Herod Agrippa to his prisoner this this former fisherman From Galilee a guy named Simon that everybody calls Peter verse six and when Herod Agrippa would have brought Peter forth the same night that may be a little confusing too he's going to bring him forth have it five it's going to be in the daytime it's a big public spectacle it says that same night well understand the Jewish day is from Sunset to Sunset so what we think of right now is Wednesday evening is really this is Thursday as far as Jewish people are concerned until sunset tomorrow when Friday begins so what we think of as the night before the Bible was telling us is the same night so from our perspective it's the night before so Peter is sleeping Between Two Soldiers and he's bound with two chains now these chains are either the iron Rings fastened in the wall or the dungeon floor or he might be chained to the two guards both methods were used in these days and they and besides that there were Keepers there were centuries before the door in front of the door that that guarded the prison itself so we've got 16 guys assigned to this guy he's chained with two chains he's got two guys in the same dungeon cell with them this place is heavily guarded 16 soldiers so it doesn't seem like Extreme Measures for a simple fisherman to keep them in jail for a couple of days but maybe just maybe Heritage grip is a pretty sharp guy you have to be able to maneuver through all the stuff in Rome and all those politics and whatever the guys he may be evil but he's no dummy maybe he knew that Peter had mysteriously escaped from a prison several years earlier and acts 5 we read verse 17 then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is of the sect of the Sadducees we recall the Sadducees and we're filled with indignation why these guys were claiming that Jesus had risen from death well that's contrary to their Doctrine therefore it can't be true therefore it's got to be a lie they laid their hands on the apostles which included Peter and put them in the common prison but the end the ain't opened the prison doors and brought them for us and sure enough we get back to Acts 12. it's the night and behold the angel of the Lord sounds familiar Came Upon him stood by appeared Before Peter a light shined in the prison and turned the fire brother Brandon says it's the pillar of fire that came in and the angel smote Peter smacked him with a little bit of force on the side not the side of the head to wake him up because he was sleeping right and he raised him he lifted him up and he said to him arise get up quickly and Peter's chains fell off from his hands so he was chained by the wrists with a chain and a chain and he goes on he says gird thyself bind on my sandals get dressed put on your belt put on your shoes we're going for a walk and so he did Peter was saying he was probably naked it's another form of humiliation degradation a way to further Inspire fear take away hope and the angel said unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me get your outer garment Peter wrap yourself in it leave no trace of yourself no trace of your clothing and he Peter now fully dressed went out at the silver he'd been chained and followed the angel and and and Peter whist not is it he didn't know he didn't understand that it was physically true that was going on he thought he was still dreaming that it was a vision but when they were past the first and second ward the sets of guards so if there were layers upon layers of security to keep Peter in prison it's not working they came to the Iron Gate that leads under the city which opened to them of his own accord there was no visible being that opened it and they went out and they passed on through one street we might say they they walked a block and forthwith immediately at that moment the angel departed from him disappeared was gone and and when Peter came to himself came to his senses he said to himself I'm sure he wasn't shouting out loud to everybody now I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his Angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod Agrippa and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews in this case is talking about the people of Judea when when the Bible says Jews sometimes it means practitioners of Judaism sometimes it means descendants of Israel sometimes it means they're rulers and sometimes it means people that lived in the land of Judea and when Peter had considered the thing when he realized what had happened he made a decision now it's just after Passover we know that Passover is the 14th of the month right full moon okay so this is just after a full moon so there's plenty of moonlight for him to move around at night to see where he's going so he navigates the streets and he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark must have been a lot of folks named John for them to have nicknames like this where many were gathered together and what were they doing they weren't partying they were praying remember verse 5 prayer was made continually on Peter's behalf now another little footnote a little sidebar have you ever noticed how many of the women in the New Testament are named Mary there's at least six of them that's often more confusing than trying to figure out who's Herod Moses sister was named Miriam a former the same name as Mary or Maria means rebellious Mary is generally taken to mean bitter or rebellious we read for example in in the Book of Ruth 1 19. so they too Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth once until they came to Bethlehem and it came to pass when they were Come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this Naomi you've come back she said unto them call me not Naomi meaning Pleasant call me Mara Mary bitter for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me back to acts why would people be naming their daughters rebellious or bitter it's the context of the time Israel was occupied by your cruel Master Independence had recently been tasted and removed an outbreak of rebellion to try and throw off the Roman yoke was festering and in only 20 or 25 years from acts 12 that Revolt will happen and those things don't happen overnight it takes time it builds up and builds up remember one of Jesus disciples was Simon the zealot guy that was wanting to overthrow Rome by force and 60 years after the failure of the first Rebellion there was another one there was an expectation of a Messianic deliverer to the Jews the second coming to the Christians it was on the disciples Minds in Acts 1 when they asked Jesus before the Ascension if he was at that time going to restore the kingdom to Israel in this context it's easy to see why there are so many named Mary bitter repression Rebellion is what's on people's minds well back to Peter verse 13 as Peter knocked at the door of the outside gate a damsel a young woman came to Harkin to answer the knocker her name was Rhoda and when she when wrote a new Peter's voice when she heard and recognized his voice she was so excited she forgot to open the gate she ran inside for gladness ran in the house and told everyone there who are praying how God's answered your prayers Peter's outside of the gate and they the assembled Christians who had been praying until that moment said to her you crazy girl Thou Art mad you must be out of your mind Peter's in prison under heavy guard what's gotten into you have a cup of tea dear it'll help calm you but she constantly affirms she kept insisting they argued with her more than once it was even so no I tell you it's true Peter's at the outside gate then said they it's his angel now this word specifically means messenger it's not spirit it's not theophany it's not Divine being it means messenger so it's kind of a peculiar thing to say maybe they thought Peter had sent some third party with a message to them about something it's his angel but Peter continued knocking hello I know you're there come to the door open the gate hello and when they at long last when they finally opened the door and saw him they were so glad the Lord's answered our prayers they were astonished they were amazed they were surprised what they saw did not match their expectation but unlike Rhoda they had the president's mind to open the door let them in Peter beckoning into them with a hand to hold their peace quiet you'll attract unwanted attention with all this carrying on he declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison and after sharing the miraculous escape with him he said go show these things tell share these things tell James the leader of the Jerusalem Church clearly not the one that had just been killed Peter knew that and to the brethren so Peter's not going to go there he wants them to go and spread that word one suspects that Peter was probably concerned that the soldiers might already be searching for him he doesn't want to draw them to this house he doesn't want to draw them to the leaders of the church but he wants the information to spread get on your Facebook page so the place that he stopped at was probably known to the soldier to be one of the first places they go is Peter here we don't believe you tear the place apart see if he's there and we read that and Peter departed and went into another place I don't know where that was verse 18. now as soon as it was Day meaning daylight there was no small stir among the soldiers plenty of commotion plenty of disturbance regarding what was become of Peter these guys are terrified because they know the type of tyrant that Herod agriba is and when Herod Agrippa had sought for Peter when he'd summoned him and and the messenger he sent didn't find him couldn't find Peter after a you can be sure a very thorough search he Herod Agrippa examined the keepers examined interrogated when it when you run across that they examined him it means physical torture they physically tortured the 16 soldiers assigned to guard Peter and dissatisfied with their explanation or lack of the same he commanded that they the guards these 16 soldiers should be put to death hope you let them go you guys that's the kind of guy he was and he Herod Agrippa went down from Judea from Jerusalem and we talked about that before Jerusalem you always go down from Jerusalem you always go up to Jerusalem it's just part of the part of the language and and part of part of being there he went to caesarea and they're abode stayed there lived his Palace the story of Herod Agrippa will now Jump Ahead in time the 44 A.D this is the third part Luke 12. but Luke because Luke wants to finish telling us about him before returning to the events just after Peter's Escape so it's a Flash Forward it's a sidebar but what could we learn from Peter's story so far from Peter he's in prison he's chained he's depending on the Lord but it's beyond his power to do anything about his circumstances he's exhausted I'm sure he's not been treated very pleasantly in there he's sleeping he doesn't know what lays in store for him but he's not expecting it to be anything good there were those praying for him they were faithful to pray to remember Peter's situation they prayed earnestly not one and done but holding him constantly before the Lord but they were caught by surprise when their prayers were answered and a spectacular miraculous way they weren't prepared to believe that it had happened their faith was high enough that they were praying but their expectations were low then there's Rhoda a young person answered Peter's knock she's so happy she forgot to unlock or open the gate she went back to the adults and testified your prayers have been answered and what did she get for this good news reminds you a little bit about Easter morning when the ladies came and told the disciples that Peter that Jesus was risen they didn't get a very good reception neither did Rhoda she was scorned she was belittled why because their expectations did not match their faith it's how sad what are our expectations this evening what is brother Lyle's expectation with that let's go back to Luke's account of Herod Agrippa he's now living he made his Abode in caesarea and were jumping up in time now to the year 44 A.D verse 20. and Herod Agrippa was highly displeased with them of tire and sidon we don't know why but we know that he's not the kind of guy that you want to have highly displeased with you so they send a delegation and they came this delegation from Tire inside they came with one Accord they came in unity to Herod Agrippa in caesarea and first they understood politics they made blast us the king's Chamberlain their friend they secured his cooperation and probably today we think of him as being Chief of Staff sort of the gatekeeper you want to see her at a grip you go through blasters and they desire peace because their country their cities their area was nourished by the king's country in other words the agriculture of the Galilee and the territories that are controlled by uh King Herod Agrippa or what these people depend on for food so again we see we've got these guys coming from the north coming maybe 60 or 70 miles down here to caesarea Agrippa Herod Agrippa has come from Jerusalem and this is where his Palace and stuff is is in caesarea keep in mind that he's the most powerful person to rule Judea since his grandfather Herod the Great he had the support of the Roman senate he ruled with an iron fist if he were highly displeased with you he better grovel at his feet he's ruthless this is not a nice guy verse 21. upon a set day Josephus tells us that it was during what he called the games of caesarea in honor of the emperor Herod Agrippa arrayed in Royal apparel Josephus says that it was a shining silver garment sat upon his throne and made an oration probably a long speech unto them unto them the people the word them suggests that the delegation from tire and sidon may have been part of the crowd and the people gave a shout saying it's the voice of the God and not of a man well you'd expect them to say something like that Caesar is worshiped as a god it's very common in the empire for this sort of thing to go on it's a pagan world then we read immediately the angel of the Lord smote Herod Agrippa not like Peter to wake him up because he gave not God the glory is the reason given it seems a little strange but we take it for what it says Herod Agrippa was trying to make an example of the church when favored through persecution reminding everyone how powerful he was here God turns it around shows everyone that no one is beyond his reach his judgment it's a warning and he Herod Agrippa was eaten of worms now Josephus tells us two days after the speech he took ill and five days after that in great Agony Herod Agrippa gave up the ghost the year was 44 A.D but in contrast in spite of the efforts of Herod Agrippa and his ilk the word of God the gospel message grew and the number of Believers multiplied the church flourished a lesson we can draw from this experience is that of humility to be careful always to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in our lives not out of fear of death by worms but out of respect for love for the Lord he is the source of everything it's by his grace and that alone that we exist and have our being he's the Fountain of Living Waters he's the bread of life our faith in whatever measure we may possess is a gift from him we need to exercise it we need to nourish it we need to help it grow but it starts as a seed gift from the Almighty well there's one more verse in Acts 12. here Luke returns Us in time to just after Peter's escape from prison Paul and Barnabas had arrived in Jerusalem they delivered to the elders and Jerusalem The Collection taken by the church at Antioch for the aid of the Believers in Judea we don't know how long they stayed it's likely they were there for just a few weeks or maybe a couple of months it was Passover season so this is stepping back in time from the death of Herod Agrippa verse 25 and Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their Ministry of delivering the collection made for Judea by the Christians and Antioch and took with them from Jerusalem to Antioch John whose surname was Mark that's the son of the woman to whose house Peter went after his Escape that we read about in verse 12. Colossians 4 10 is often interpreted as indicating that this John Mark was a nephew or a cousin of Barnabas he was related once again the transitions us geographically then from Jerusalem to Antioch and Syria now you've probably noticed in these last couple of chapters that we've looked at that Barnabas is pretty tight with Saul he defended into the church in Jerusalem after Saul's conversion they're sent out together they're both Jews born in the diaspora outside the land of Israel Saul was born in Tarsus we're told he was educated in Jerusalem under gamalia Christian tradition from ancient times indicates that Barnabas who was born in Cyprus was also a student of gamalia if that's true then they likely met and knew each other during their years of training that may have known each other before they became Christians now in the next chapter of Acts 13 tells of Paul and Barnabas and Mark how they were sent from Antioch oh I don't want to spoil it brother well that brother Daniel tell you next time that we get together about acts but before we close tonight I want to go back and revisit that group that was praying for Peter I think there's an important takeaway that we can learn from them I mentioned their faith was high their expectations didn't quite match their faith I know we've been told many times about getting what we expect or what we invest in a church service I want to read to you a story that most if not all of you are familiar with it's an event in the life of brother Branham but it's much more than that it's about expectations and priorities faith and love it takes place in the late 1940s it's from a sermon titled expectation from July 14 1951. it's a little lengthy but please bear with me while I read it to you brother Brandon says here not long ago I was coming from Dallas Texas in Spring and I thought I was flying back I was grounded in Memphis right where my had to be one night on the fifth at Memphis Tennessee I was grounded there they put me up there in that I believe the Peabody Hotel it's called it's a very nice place myself I couldn't afford to go in it but the airline sent me up there and I remember that morning they called me said now the plane will leave at 8 o'clock Reverend Branham said they'll be by to pick you up I said yes sir I got my letters ready was going to go down to mail the letters now listen closely I'm going to close in a minute and I thought oh my I'll go down and mail these letters I got out started down the street trying to find the post office and I was walking down the street singing that little Pentecostal song Let's see telling now both far and wide his power is yet the same I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them brother Ryan you remember when you used to sing it and going singing that little song and after a while I felt something going got close I stepped back up behind a great big column there and I said Heavenly Father what would you have your servant do it kept going I was real still a minute I heard a deep voice say turn go back well I turned and went walking back down the street I walked and I walked on past the hotel on down to South Memphis just walking on and on the sun was way high then the sun was up it was a beautiful spring morning the fragrance of the flowers in the air had perfumed the air I thought how beautiful was going walking along there I thought Lord I don't know you said walk here I am I'm walking I just kept on walking walking walked out dirt near the other side of Memphis I remember going down a little Hill towards our little creek of thing ran down through this way a little tributary there at the river of some kind I just went walking down through there there was a little whitewashed Hut down there a lot of colored people lived down in that way I was walking down through their singing or humming to myself only believe only Billy Satan said you're gonna miss I said I'll walk all things are possible don't let them tell you a lie he's a liar when God's a leading you do what God Said do yes sir he tells you you've healed believe it just start walking on and I just kept on like that singing only believe I was noticing leaning across a gate like this there was a typical Jemima great big heavy set colored woman with a man's shirt tied around her head she was leaning out across there I kind of quit singing humming when I was about as far as that wall from her I just went walking on by and when I got there she kind of looked at me and laughed those big white teeth showed her tear streaked face like that she said good moan and possum I turned now Parson means minister Reverend down in the South said good moan and possum I looked around said good morning Auntie I said say how did you know I was a person she smiled wiped her eyes I thought here it is something's going on I could feel the spirit I'd walked far enough then my when I think about it my heart leaps I turned around I said how would you know I was a person she said possum did you ever read in the Bible about that woman that had that baby by promise I said yes Auntie I've read that many a time I preached on it not long ago she said as that kind of woman too I told the Lord if he'd give me a child I'd raise it for him he said possum the Lord give me a boy and I raised him that he was in his teens said he took a road that's wrong got out with some bad company said he's laying here dying now he caught a bad disease the doctors can't do nothing for him said they give them all kind of shots said slider said he laid in here dying said he'd been unconscious since the day before yesterday said he don't know nothing he thinks he's out in a big deep sea somewhere cold said possum it just breaks my heart to see if my boy die like that said I I want him saved he said I prayed all night I said Lord you give me that baby but where's the Elijah she said now Lord will you help me don't let my baby die like this and said and the Lord told me this morning and said I kind of fell asleep there in my chair I dreamed that I was to come out here and stand in this gate and I'd see a man coming dressed like you is who am I you know that makes you feel I don't know if you've ever had an experience like that I said Auntie mark my name is Branham did you ever hear me before she said no so I never heard of you oh my I said auntie I pray for the sick she said do you I said can I come in to see your boy she said show Possum she raised that little gate back with the chain on it and a plow point for a weight weight behind it I I've went into King's palaces I went into big fine homes but it never was more welcome than I was when I walked in that little gate that morning under that trestle she walked just as happy she knew something had to happen God was on both ends of the line I need to comment here we hold the early Believers in high esteem as we should often we put them on a pedestal wondering if we could ever be like them have that kind of Faith Church of the book of Acts when Peter came from prison to the gate at John Mark's mother's house where they had been praying and praying on his behalf they sent a young girl to answer the door see he would be there this time of the night didn't want to interrupt the prayer meeting but when Rhoda reported it was Peter they didn't believe God had answered their prayers they weren't expecting Peter in Memphis Tennessee more than 70 years ago someone else is praying for her son to get out of a different kind of prison and she was waiting by the gate to open it because she had faith and was willing to step out into a Cold Spring morning to wait in another place brother Branham says her back was wet with Dew from standing out there she didn't just step out the door and here comes brother Branham but she expected him and she waited until her expectation was met where's our faith where are our actions to back that Faith where are my actions back to brother branham's sermon I said can I come in to see you you said she was had to happen God was on both ends of the line so I walked into the room first thing up on there was a little old sign God bless our home little old chunk stove that we call it in the South setting there a little poster bed it was a great big Stout looking boy about 180 pounds 17 18 years old laying there with a blanket in his hand going um like that he said this is so cool mama um she patted them she said Madness baby I thought right then of motherly love no matter what he'd done how much disgrace it was still mother's baby she kissed her on his forehead and I thought if love of a mother can go like that what will the love of God do when he said a mother may forget her suckling babe but I'll never forget you I think Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound that saved a Wretch like Me then while she was over her boy there I said auntie let's pray she never said nothing about his healing she wanted him to be saved and so before he went she wanted to have a witness that he was saved and that Old Saint got down on the floor I couldn't pray or her prey oh my she opened up that heart and the tears rolling down her cheeks she said Lo if you just let him tell me that I'm going to be with with Jesus said I'll be happy and like that I just note there held my head down cried like a baby in a few moments she raised up she said Thank You Lord she went over she said mama's baby patted it like that I felt his feet just as cold as they could be death was on that boy and he said I said does he she said he don't know I said I spoke to the boys said how are you feeling now young man he just kept going hmm she said he don't know what he's at possum he ain't been conscious for two days now I said let's pray again sister did you notice that no longer anti a polite but impersonal he'd heard her pray now it's sister family we knelt on the floor I said Heavenly Father somehow or another last night a storm came up and you grounded the plane don't you believe all things were together for good I said on my road home to the meeting I said you grounded the plane and this morning when the Sun was shining I know the hours has passed time for it to leave but somehow you led me down this way I don't understand but I'm putting my hands on this boy in the name of Jesus Christ your son and asking for his life to be spared and then no more the prayer had been made I heard him go oh I said oh mama she raised up said what do mama's baby want said Mama it's getting light in the room let's get in light in the room she began crying I raised up my hands began to offer praise up off that bed come that big healthy boy restored to his normal condition a few months after that I was passing through on a train I stopped in to get something to eat I heard somebody holler Paulson Branham he was pulling one of these little old carts around like that there down there at the station working he run grabbed a hold of my hand said you remember me I think musicians would please come I said no I don't he said I was the boy you come to that moaning that the Lord LED you down there when Mammy was praying says possum Branham I was perfectly whole now I was a Christian now Christian oh brother and you know what that plane never left something happened to it it was about an hour late I got on the plane and got home in time anyhow let me tell you something Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever his power is omnipotent he can't fail he's the same God that was in Memphis Tennessee that night Fort Wayne Indiana is here tonight do you believe that he's the same he can't fail and he's the same here in Tucson Arizona tonight in 2023 let's not be like those that were praying for Peter and were astonished when the Lord answered their prayers let's be like that sister in South Memphis motivated by undying love and concern stepping out in faith not astonished grateful Acts 12. expectation what do we expect there's another song the brother John Simon shared with me back in the summer in 1970. it reminds me of Peter in Acts 12. it reminds me of brother Branham in Memphis it makes me think about where we should be tonight in Tucson it's called keep walking I don't know if you know it or not if you don't you can fake it but sing along with me they're tuned simple I searched and I searched for the road that leads to Glory I wondered if I'd ever find a way I sat down to rest for my feet had grown so weary but then I Heard a Voice Within Me say it's got to keep on walking just keep right on walk Walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord I prayed and I prayed for the Lord to give me mercy I prayed for him to brighten up my way so afraid for the road became so lonely and then I Heard a Voice Within Me said you you've got to keep on walking just keep right on water walking in the light of the Lord [Music] walking in the light of the Lord after a while I felt something going got close I stepped back up behind a great big column there and said Heavenly Father what would you have your servant do it kept going Israel still a minute voice say turn go back well I turned it went walking back down the street I walked and I walked on past the hotel and down to South Memphis just walking on and on was going walking along there I thought Lord I don't know you said walk here I am I'm walking I just kept on walking walking walking walked out pretty near the other side of Memphis you've got to keep on walking just keep right on walking walking in the line of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way and do you appreciate that [Music] I'll tell you something foreign like that it takes a lot of preparation I talked with blue Lyle on Sunday and I talked with him before service tonight how much of a study that it went in to being able to lay these things out like that and also when I would talk to him he'd say he'd say I just want to present what the Lord wants me to present I just want to be a blessing to the people I want I want them to understand I was so hoping that brother Lyle would talk about these different people Herod and I think there's five of them [Music] there's five of them one of them's kind of I heard but it's important to know these things important to know who who is speaking here and when he talked about James it's important to know which James that that it's talking about this was James this this was the brother of John that had been with Jesus and that had gone with him and and had seen all these great things as what Lyle said was was there I believe it was on non-transfiguration he was also there and Aaron wanted to destroy this man he wasn't the pastor in the Church of Jerusalem that was another James and and as as he's going through these scriptures I just thank God that we can we can understand these things even and he goes even talking about these different Mary's [Music] remember the last said there was at least six of them sweetheart I'm sorry I gotta embarrass you my wife is I don't know if there was ever a better wife to anybody in the world than my sweetheart back there raising the kids and homeschooling them we're doing everything that we knew how to to do and just trying to keep the world out and and it's it's so hard for a parent not knowing the best way to raise the kids and just doing the best that you know know how and Stephanie was praying one time and she she was thinking about it was Mary the mother of Jesus right sweetheart you're gonna have to nod I might mess this up yeah and she was thanking the Lord for this married the mother of Jesus and what a great example that she could be and and and Stephanie was saying Lord but how could I be like somebody that great and the Lord responded to her and he said I have many Mary's and I thank God that that I got a great one I got a good one in and to think that for the Lyle he brought that out that there's at least six of these sisters with that with that sweet name of Mary I uh I appreciate him so much brother I appreciate what you what you brought tonight it was it was well thought out it was well studied and and what a what a blessing what a blessing to know these things and to be able to to dig in this book and and to see that these things happened and then brother Lyle brings out this story that was within a couple months of the tape that I listened to this morning brother Lyle brings out this story again the book of Acts being alive in this man named William Marion Branagh and reading and and how he was so LED of the spirit I believed he preached a message called letter of the spirit and he told that story that brother Lyle was telling and to think that a man could be so LED and a woman could so LED and God just is like him he doesn't just send an angel to speak to us but he sends a brother or a sister to speak to us he loves his children working together amen let's stand [Music] but Aaron if you could come I'm uh I was just blessed that blessed by tonight I always appreciate appreciate learning something it helps me to to open up this Bible and I want to just jump right in and I think if I could jump in anywhere brother Joe I think it'd be in the book of Acts that's where I'd want to jump in and make my home there God bless you all brother Eli it's Eli right yeah I'd really like if you would come and close my friend what song later he is in a song [Music] okay trust me
