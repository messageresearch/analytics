[32:11] amen i love the family of god we want to
[32:14] just say
[32:15] by way of announcement here tonight uh
[32:18] that for those of you that are gathered
[32:19] here
[32:20] i know there was maybe some an
[32:22] expectation on what we discussed two
[32:24] weeks ago
[32:25] for those of you that are part of the
[32:27] local body here i'm sure you were aware
[32:30] of that that there was
[32:31] concerning pastoring this church going
[32:33] forward
[32:34] and all the questions and things that
[32:36] surround that for where we're at
[32:38] at a year and it's hard to believe it's
[32:40] been a year but there was a lot of
[32:42] questions
[32:43] about that and so i wanted to say that
[32:46] the evening service tonight will be a
[32:49] special unique service
[32:51] uh to address that and to to speak about
[32:54] that
[32:54] and i have a lot of things upon my heart
[32:57] that i'd like to say
[32:58] and so i want to say that if
[33:01] if you are tonight's service will be
[33:04] different
[33:05] um and so if you are a
[33:08] regular tithe paying member
[33:11] of the tucson tabernacle then we want
[33:14] you to come
[33:14] this evening if you are not god bless
[33:17] you but we just
[33:18] ask you not to be in attendance tonight
[33:20] we won't be live streaming we will be
[33:22] recording that service
[33:23] for the local body and i know that
[33:26] there's some who aren't able to come and
[33:28] uh and be here physically for whatever
[33:31] need but they
[33:32] for ever reason but they are a normal
[33:35] church member here paying tithes and
[33:38] consider themselves a part of the
[33:40] the local body here i believe that's
[33:42] important i believe that a local body
[33:44] uh is sovereign that's what the prophet
[33:45] of god taught you believe that
[33:48] uh we're connected interconnected with
[33:50] uh
[33:51] you know this church is connected with
[33:53] nations all across the world
[33:55] and different ministries and and the
[33:57] body of christ is connected
[33:59] uh you know in different churches but
[34:02] there is a local governing body here a
[34:04] local group of believers here
[34:06] and my vision and my purpose of coming
[34:08] here is for this
[34:10] local body uh and so uh and so we just
[34:13] like to say that that if you are
[34:15] a uh a normal tithe paying member
[34:18] and you've been you you consider this to
[34:20] be your home church then
[34:22] you're welcome to be there we will make
[34:24] the phone hookup
[34:25] because it's uh password uh protected if
[34:28] you want to call it that
[34:29] um and so those that have that are
[34:32] considered to be members here we also
[34:34] will have a recording for those that
[34:36] are part of the body but not able to
[34:39] listen in on the phone hookup or be
[34:41] their present so we will make that
[34:43] available
[34:44] but tonight we'll be addressing that and
[34:47] and just how we want to go forward with
[34:48] that
[34:49] and so we look forward to that again not
[34:51] we may make another announcement on the
[34:53] whatsapp
[34:54] uh concerning the uh you know the format
[34:57] of that but
[34:57] that will be at regular service time
[34:59] tonight i'll just go ahead and say that

[36:14] last night this morning when you tried
[36:16] to get dressed and the devil interrupted

[36:35] specifically i believe the lord
[36:37] jesus can do that mark chapter 14 and
[36:40] i'd like to just begin reading here
[36:41] we're just going to read a couple verses
[36:43] and then we'll parallel uh some of this
[36:46] and then
[36:47] uh move on uh through we'll come back to
[36:49] some of these
[36:50] scriptures i want you to begin i want to
[36:52] be begin reading here at verse 32 of
[36:54] mark chapter 14.
[37:00] i'd like to speak to you this morning on
[37:03] understanding your cup of pain
[37:07] understanding your cup of pain
[37:11] and they came to a place which was
[37:13] called gethsemane
[37:15] and he said unto his disciples sit ye
[37:18] here while i shall pray
[37:20] and he took with him peter james and
[37:23] john and begin
[37:24] to be sore amazed and to be
[37:27] very heavy and said unto them
[37:31] my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto
[37:34] death tara you hear and watch
[37:38] and he went forward a little and fell on
[37:40] the ground and prayed that if it were
[37:42] possible
[37:43] the hour might pass from him
[37:47] and he said abba father
[37:50] all things are possible unto thee take
[37:53] away this cup for me nevertheless
[37:56] not what i will but what thou will
[38:00] and he cometh and findeth them sleeping
[38:03] said unto peter simon sleepest thou
[38:07] couldest not thou watch
[38:10] one hour imagine
[38:14] your last few friends
[38:19] when the whole world has rejected you
[38:21] and in your darkest
[38:23] moment when you've asked your closest
[38:26] confidants to pray with you only to find
[38:29] them
[38:30] asleep and he said unto them
[38:34] watch you verse 38 and pray
[38:37] lest you enter into temptation the
[38:39] spirit truly is ready but the flesh is
[38:42] weak
[38:43] and again he went away and prayed and
[38:45] spoke the same words
[38:47] and when he returned he found them
[38:49] asleep
[38:50] again for their eyes were heavy
[38:54] neither was they what to answer them
[38:58] and he cometh the third time and said
[39:00] unto them sleep on now
[39:02] and take your rest it is enough
[39:05] the hour has come behold the son of man
[39:07] is betrayed
[39:09] into the hands of sinners rise up let us
[39:12] go
[39:13] he that betrayeth me is at hand
[39:16] lord jesus we just read these words
[39:20] lord and i can feel the nearness the
[39:22] closest lord of
[39:24] your presence how real it is lord
[39:28] to the redeemed that stand here today
[39:33] believing lord jesus that this
[39:36] moment that happened so many years ago
[39:40] lord as we read and reflect upon that
[39:42] hour
[39:43] lord when you were being served that cup
[39:46] of pain
[39:48] to where the bible says that you sweated
[39:51] blood
[39:53] lord and that you you came under such
[39:56] great pressure
[39:56] such great torment you said my soul is
[40:00] exceedingly sorrowful
[40:01] unto death lord how we reflect even in
[40:04] this
[40:05] late hour that we live in in this world
[40:08] lord it's uh
[40:09] this world is a world of pressure lord
[40:12] and we all as believers children
[40:14] lord our families live under this
[40:16] intense pressure of the lateness of this
[40:18] hour lord in your but your prophet
[40:20] preached a sermon
[40:21] how to let off the pressure so god i
[40:24] pray lord that this
[40:25] morning lord that your august presence
[40:28] your nearness your closeness
[40:30] would come lord and take your word for
[40:32] it's your word and break it unto your
[40:34] children lord so that they can find
[40:37] lord resource a resource lord to let off
[40:40] the pressure in life
[40:41] we pray father that you would be our
[40:43] helper be our speaker
[40:45] be the hearer lord of man all things you
[40:48] get the glory
[40:49] the honor and the praise in jesus name
[40:52] and the church said amen you can be
[40:55] seated this morning
[41:04] it's amazing the expectation as you read
[41:07] this
[41:08] and we don't have time just to cover the
[41:11] whole scene here but just for a moment
[41:13] we'd like to parallel
[41:15] the life of jesus the life of of
[41:18] elijah in the life of job and maybe a
[41:21] few others if the lord would allow us
[41:22] today
[41:24] it's amazing because this was such a
[41:27] dash to the expectation
[41:30] of the disciples who no doubt
[41:33] they believed and had created as we
[41:36] often do many times
[41:38] they had created their own they had
[41:41] created their own
[41:42] leader of what they thought jesus was
[41:45] and what jesus was coming to do
[41:48] and they had produced this
[41:51] in their mind that this great teacher
[41:54] this great leader
[41:55] this mighty redeemer and rescuer
[41:59] and he was that's exactly what jesus was
[42:03] but if we're not careful even in the
[42:05] world that we live in
[42:07] we can create our own gospel even the
[42:10] apostle paul warns at this and says
[42:12] that you would serve another jesus that
[42:14] jesus whom we've not
[42:16] preached and often times in our
[42:18] imagination
[42:20] we can create a christ of our
[42:22] imagination
[42:23] the world has created that
[42:26] a jesus who's just here to make us feel
[42:29] good
[42:30] uh one who's just here to bless us one
[42:33] who's just here to take care of us
[42:35] and watch over us and give us everything
[42:38] we ever want
[42:39] and it's amazing because really you
[42:41] could sum up
[42:43] modern american christianity just in
[42:46] that right there that
[42:48] jesus and the gospel of jesus is all
[42:50] just about
[42:51] how you feel and there's a lot of
[42:53] emphasis placed on
[42:55] fillings there's been new york times
[42:57] bestsellers written about it
[42:59] good books but another jesus and a false
[43:02] gospel
[43:03] uh one that one of our greatest
[43:06] uh churches even in our in our nation
[43:09] here joel osteen and has a
[43:11] pastor of the largest church and you
[43:13] know gatherings of 20 and 30
[43:15] 000 people filling stadiums and arenas i
[43:19] always think it's amazing because
[43:21] jesus didn't have those kind of crowds
[43:23] yet somehow
[43:24] joel osteen has those kind of crowds the
[43:27] gospel that jesus preached got him
[43:29] crucified
[43:30] and the gospel that joel osteen preached
[43:33] has given him the riches of the world
[43:35] what's must be a contradiction here
[43:37] happening
[43:39] wrote a book called your best life
[43:42] now your best life
[43:46] now you know there's only one way that
[43:48] this is my best life your best life and
[43:50] that is if you're going to hell
[43:53] i said there's only one way this is my
[43:55] best life
[43:56] and that is if i'm going to hell because
[44:00] surely this life is not my best
[44:03] life but my best life is the next life
[44:07] you believe that
[44:10] and it's amazing because they believe
[44:11] this is your best life
[44:13] that you get it now that you get
[44:15] everything here
[44:16] and this is almost in some way even the
[44:19] the way that the perception that they
[44:22] here was
[44:23] the the god's family after they had been
[44:26] after they had been
[44:27] persecuted yes after they had been uh
[44:31] hunted down and and the romans had had
[44:34] bullied them
[44:35] like a great bully would do and had
[44:37] oppressed them and
[44:39] and you imagine even for yourself if you
[44:41] put yourself there
[44:42] that here now you have this great leader
[44:44] and this great teacher and
[44:46] oh my you know it's almost like that big
[44:48] brother who's gonna come and beat up the
[44:50] bully who's been bullying you
[44:52] you know you feel this sense of
[44:53] retribution and and you know and you're
[44:55] you know i
[44:56] you got this great hero i i looked at my
[44:59] older brother
[45:00] that way and if you hear my older
[45:02] brother's story you would think he was a
[45:04] boxing legend and in my mind he is a
[45:06] boxing legend though he never
[45:07] uh went and professionally boxed because
[45:10] i had
[45:11] some some bullies in my life who uh
[45:14] let's just say that um
[45:16] he he uh he took care of those bullies
[45:20] and and it got him into a lot of trouble
[45:22] but i looked at i
[45:23] the way that i viewed him and looked at
[45:25] him as a big brother who would
[45:27] you know you get you get pushed on and
[45:29] picked on by
[45:30] boys that were older than me and uh and
[45:33] even older than him and
[45:34] and you know i just knew that all i had
[45:36] to do in that situation was just go to
[45:39] you know let my brother know because
[45:40] number one it wasn't i'm not so sure
[45:43] looking back that it was really about
[45:44] protecting me i think he just really
[45:46] liked to fight
[45:47] and uh and so any opportunity he could
[45:50] get
[45:50] you know to get in a good scrap jonathan
[45:53] was was up for it
[45:54] and he never lost a fight i think that
[45:57] the lord sort of uh directed his path in
[45:59] other ways intentionally because he was
[46:01] he's a real good fighter real good
[46:03] boxer had long reach and and i and i
[46:06] i look at this and i think it's amazing
[46:08] because it's very much
[46:10] how the disciples are viewing jesus that
[46:12] he's going to come there and he's going
[46:14] to deliver them from
[46:15] this oppressor and this great bullying
[46:17] now we got somebody and you want to mess
[46:19] with us you know and
[46:20] you you don't know who you're messing
[46:22] with and you don't know what's coming at
[46:23] you and
[46:24] even their questions you know what
[46:25] you're going to set up your kingdom and
[46:27] and you're going to set up your power
[46:29] and and and you know the the this
[46:31] who's going to be greatest in the
[46:32] kingdom and their vision and then vision
[46:34] and all these my all
[46:36] in their mind all of this mixed bag of
[46:38] emotion of oppression and
[46:40] you know oh we can't wait we're going to
[46:41] set up this kingdom and we're going to
[46:43] deal with these romans and we're going
[46:45] to be the leaders and
[46:46] we're going to be ruling with iron and
[46:48] they're going to be our servants and
[46:49] you know we're going to inflict the pain
[46:51] that they've inflicted on us
[46:55] that's amazing because they had created
[46:56] this this this jesus of their
[46:59] imagination this god who this christ who
[47:02] is
[47:02] just going to come in and destroy their
[47:05] enemy
[47:08] and what they didn't realize is that
[47:10] that's exactly what
[47:12] jesus was coming to do he was coming to
[47:16] inflict a fatal blow to their oppressor
[47:20] he was coming to inflict a fatal blow to
[47:23] their
[47:23] enemy the only problem is is that the
[47:26] enemy was not the romans the
[47:28] enemy was themselves
[47:36] because this age is very much like it
[47:38] was
[47:39] then it's all about self
[47:43] it's all about you it's it's
[47:45] expectations and false expectations
[47:48] thinking that he was coming to be this
[47:50] hero to destroy their bully
[47:52] and he was going to crush the higher
[47:54] class and that it suppressed them and he
[47:56] would set up their kingdom and
[47:58] they would no longer be poor what a
[48:00] letdown
[48:01] they had imagine this great superman and
[48:04] yes he was but
[48:06] they had mixed up who the real enemy was
[48:11] because the enemy was not the romans the
[48:13] enemy was
[48:14] their self that's why jesus says in mark
[48:19] 8 then he called the crowd to him along
[48:22] with his disciples and
[48:24] said if anyone would come after me
[48:29] if anyone would follow me he must
[48:32] deny himself
[48:37] take up his cross and follow me
[48:42] for whoever wants to save his life will
[48:45] lose it
[48:46] but whoever loses his life for me and
[48:49] for the gospel
[48:50] will save it he says in another place
[48:54] you must count the cost before you
[48:58] want to come after me you've got to make
[49:00] sure you understand the cost
[49:02] make sure you understand what you're
[49:04] asking
[49:05] and i think that so often times that it
[49:08] becomes so
[49:10] i don't know and i'll have another word
[49:12] maybe it's going to sound wrong to say
[49:13] this but it becomes so
[49:16] cheap to say i want to be like jesus
[49:21] it becomes it's lost its value to say i
[49:24] want to be like the lord i want to be
[49:27] like jesus it almost can just become a
[49:29] cliche and
[49:30] i just want to live like jesus well just
[49:33] stop for a moment
[49:34] and and consider consider what it means
[49:38] when we
[49:39] say that consider what it means is jesus
[49:42] said can you can you
[49:44] go the way that i go can can you come
[49:48] the way that i came because you
[49:50] see the character of the lord and you
[49:51] see what the you see that you see the
[49:53] life and you say
[49:54] i want that but if you considered what
[49:56] it cost
[49:57] him to be him
[50:02] have you considered and that's what
[50:03] jesus is saying he's saying if you
[50:05] understood
[50:06] that in your life there's a love of of
[50:09] of your own humanity there's a love of
[50:12] what you want there's a love of of of of
[50:15] of your
[50:16] life and your desires but real
[50:18] christianity
[50:20] is about one thing and it's about a
[50:22] denial
[50:24] of self you know
[50:27] calvary that that's what the cross
[50:29] represented and we're post
[50:31] calvary and we see pictures of a cross
[50:34] and we
[50:35] imagine in our mind this great victory
[50:37] and
[50:38] it was but for us it represents when we
[50:42] look at
[50:42] calvary it's represented grace it
[50:45] represents redemption
[50:47] it represents salvation
[50:51] it represents all of these things that
[50:55] are good
[50:55] but do you understand what it meant for
[50:58] jesus
[51:00] do you understand that when jesus says
[51:02] if you want to come after me you must
[51:04] take up your
[51:06] cross and so
[51:08] cross in the days of the roman empire
[51:12] across was equivalent today
[51:16] of the execution chamber
[51:20] across was capital punishment lethal
[51:23] injection is equivalent to what we would
[51:26] call it today and when you have that
[51:28] graphic in your mind it suddenly
[51:31] dramatically changes how you view the
[51:33] cross
[51:35] because when jesus says if you come
[51:37] after me you must deny yourself
[51:40] pick up your electric chair
[51:45] and follow me because this is what it's
[51:49] going to cost it's going to cost your
[51:50] life you know the gospel is so less
[51:52] appealing when you preach it that way
[51:54] isn't it
[51:56] it's so less it's so less captivating
[51:59] and this just great thing that we just
[52:01] accept
[52:03] when jesus says in luke 9 23-24 he says
[52:06] then he said unto them if anyone would
[52:07] come after me he must deny himself
[52:10] take up his cross daily and follow me
[52:13] for whoever wants to save his life will
[52:15] lose it but whoever loses his life for
[52:17] me
[52:17] will stay save it this is a picture
[52:21] of a man already condemned requires
[52:24] that he carry the beam of his own
[52:28] cross to his execution
[52:31] and jesus says in matthew 10 verse 38
[52:33] anyone who does not take his cross
[52:36] and follow this is not what i'm
[52:37] preaching on today but the holy spirit
[52:38] just has me
[52:39] stopped and hovering over this just so
[52:41] just bear with me okay just for a moment
[52:44] anyone who doesn't take his own cross
[52:46] and follow me is not
[52:47] worthy of me and this is this is exactly
[52:50] what it means
[52:51] because many people interpret the cross
[52:54] as some burden
[52:55] that they must carry in their lives a
[52:57] strained relationship a thankless
[53:00] job a physical illness and i got to
[53:02] carry my cross i've got to bear this
[53:03] cross it's the cross that i
[53:05] that i have to bear and with self-pity
[53:07] and pride
[53:08] you know we can sometimes look at our
[53:10] own can we be honest here this morning
[53:12] we can with our own pride look at our
[53:14] own suffering human suffering and say
[53:16] well
[53:17] you know it's just the cross i have to
[53:19] carry but let me tell you
[53:20] when jesus said take up your cross and
[53:24] follow me it was a reference to capital
[53:27] punishment
[53:28] under roman law it was execution it was
[53:31] the denial of
[53:33] oneself
[53:36] and this is exactly why in gethsemane
[53:39] the prophet of god says something so
[53:40] amazing
[53:42] and he points to gethsemane in
[53:43] gethsemane as we've read as means the
[53:46] the the the pressing of olives
[53:49] the crushing of olives and and and
[53:52] brother branham says the real
[53:54] victory the real battle that's what he
[53:56] calls it he says the real battle
[53:58] and he preaches a message the greatest
[54:00] battle ever fought
[54:03] and he says the the great battle that
[54:05] was won
[54:06] wasn't on calvary the great battle the
[54:09] great
[54:10] victory wasn't when jesus was crucified
[54:13] and it's victory it was a great victory
[54:14] was the climax but he says the real
[54:17] battle
[54:18] took place in gethsemane
[54:21] and he says in the real victory that was
[54:23] won was won
[54:25] in gethsemane because the prophet of god
[54:28] said because it was in gethsemane
[54:31] when it wasn't his flesh or his body
[54:34] that was being questioned or crucified
[54:37] but it was his
[54:38] own humanity and his own human will
[54:41] and desire to live
[54:45] and he says the real battle took place
[54:47] we just read about it in mark 14
[54:49] when jesus is saying if it's possible
[54:52] lord if it be
[54:53] possible let this cup pass for me and he
[54:56] says but
[54:57] nevertheless not my
[55:00] will but your
[55:03] will be done and the prophet says that's
[55:07] where the victory was
[55:08] won when he could conquer the battle of
[55:12] self so what was calvary when he was
[55:15] crucified
[55:16] the prophet of god said it was just the
[55:18] climax to that
[55:20] victory that had happened in gethsemane
[55:23] when jesus had won the battle over
[55:26] self
[55:30] it's no accident that he's crucified on
[55:33] a hill called
[55:34] golgotha which go read your bible and it
[55:37] says which
[55:38] in aramaic meaneth the place of
[55:41] the skull it's no accident because it
[55:46] spoke of the skull
[55:48] brother adam says where's the greatest
[55:49] battle being taken right now
[55:52] it's taking place in the skull the great
[55:54] gog
[55:55] the great calvary the great crucifixion
[55:57] you must deny yourself
[55:59] happens in an age of self-will and
[56:02] self-want and self-love
[56:04] and self-acceptance
[56:07] but real christianity is when you're
[56:10] able to say
[56:12] not me but you
[56:16] oh how many could identify and say lord
[56:18] i want to say that this morning
[56:21] not me but you lord
[56:24] not me but you lord in your purpose and
[56:26] your will
[56:27] not me but you lord
[56:30] not my will but your will lord
[56:34] and it's a cry that we all pray as we
[56:37] said we want to be like the lord i want
[56:39] to fulfill the purpose god has planned
[56:41] in my life but it's amazing because you
[56:43] look at jesus and you say what
[56:45] forces or pressure does god
[56:49] use to produce righteousness
[56:52] what forces or what pressures does he
[56:54] use as the prophet of god says
[56:56] your christian character christ-like
[56:59] character
[57:00] is not a gift that god gives you that
[57:03] you pray for and he just grants it to
[57:05] you and he said god can't even give you
[57:06] christian character that way
[57:08] he says because real christian character
[57:10] is not a gift that god gives you
[57:12] but it's a victory after a battle has
[57:16] taken place
[57:17] it's a success that you have coming
[57:20] through the torment
[57:21] and through the trial it produces godly
[57:25] christ-like character
[57:28] to build character but i asked
[57:32] what is the the desire we would say we
[57:34] desire
[57:36] to to to to live like jesus to be a man
[57:39] of god
[57:40] to be a woman uh to be a to be a family
[57:43] member a mother a father
[57:44] who intimates christ who reflects his
[57:47] character reflects his
[57:49] his godliness it reflects his love
[57:52] real christ-like love not worldly love
[57:57] and if you you you ask the question if
[58:00] you really want to
[58:01] no what is it brother matt what what is
[58:04] it to get that character
[58:06] how do i come to that place how do i
[58:08] possess that how do i obtain that
[58:10] and if you want to look at the process
[58:13] that god uses to produce
[58:14] godliness then look it no further than
[58:17] the garden
[58:18] of gethsemane look at jesus because he's
[58:21] our
[58:22] example he had spent his entire life
[58:26] and ministry everything in his ministry
[58:29] was about fulfilling the will
[58:32] of his father his entire life could be
[58:34] summed up by that it was a life that was
[58:37] sacrificed and laid out completely to
[58:40] fulfill
[58:40] the will of his father the purpose
[58:45] for three years for three years of his
[58:48] life
[58:49] and and mission everything had been
[58:52] headed
[58:52] straight towards calvary everything was
[58:55] climaxing
[58:56] and crescendoing his moment his pinnacle
[58:59] his his his final victory everything
[59:02] that was happening in his life his
[59:04] submission daily submission to the
[59:07] father
[59:08] and daily submission to the will of the
[59:10] one who had sent him
[59:12] was leading him on a path you see
[59:15] obedience has a path
[59:18] and obedience has a road and everything
[59:20] he was doing he was sowing the seeds of
[59:22] obedience
[59:24] he was sowing the seeds of submission
[59:26] and he said brother matt where was that
[59:27] road leading him
[59:29] it was leading him down the road
[59:32] to calvary
[59:35] how very different judas who his entire
[59:38] life and ministry had been sowing a seed
[59:40] of disobedience
[59:42] and it was leading him down a path of
[59:44] betrayal
[59:48] but jesus had spent his life
[59:51] who had lived for the purpose of his
[59:54] father yeah you can hear his words
[59:58] turn back their if you could in mark
[1:00:01] i'll just read it for you and if you
[1:00:02] have it you can put it on the screen
[1:00:05] you could hear his words when he comes
[1:00:09] to his disciples and he
[1:00:11] asks a question could you not
[1:00:15] watch with me one hour first forty
[1:00:19] could you not watch imagine the pressure
[1:00:23] that even they were under
[1:00:25] this renegade group they were under such
[1:00:29] immense pressure the bible says jesus
[1:00:31] says could you not
[1:00:32] pray could you not watch for one hour
[1:00:36] whatever torment whatever suffering
[1:00:38] whatever pain
[1:00:40] this humanity this human being this man
[1:00:43] was filling forced him the bible says to
[1:00:47] sweat
[1:00:48] drops of blood and to cry out and could
[1:00:52] cry from his own humanity and say oh god
[1:00:55] if it's at all possible deliver me i'd
[1:00:58] rather let this cup pass this is my
[1:01:00] human will i'd rather let it pass it's
[1:01:03] too
[1:01:03] great a burden for me to carry and and
[1:01:06] as
[1:01:06] job you're you you job was being in the
[1:01:09] same exact spot in his life when he's
[1:01:11] being served
[1:01:12] his cup of pain and job
[1:01:16] it cries out and he says in job 30 verse
[1:01:19] 19 he says
[1:01:20] he speaking of jehovah hath cast me into
[1:01:23] the
[1:01:24] mire mine eyes poureth out tears
[1:01:27] unto god in other words i'm in pain
[1:01:30] i'm in derision and i can't even see
[1:01:34] my way forward david said this when he
[1:01:37] was
[1:01:38] being served his cup of pain he said i
[1:01:41] made my
[1:01:42] couch a bed of tears
[1:01:46] and he says i water my couch daily with
[1:01:49] my
[1:01:49] tears and he says my eye is consumed
[1:01:53] because of grief because of pain
[1:01:56] because of suffering i believe that god
[1:01:59] is a healer
[1:02:01] i believe we can get a universal amen
[1:02:03] that i believe god is a healer and i
[1:02:05] believe in
[1:02:06] healing this is a powerful statement
[1:02:08] that a man
[1:02:09] wrote and pen he said i i believe in
[1:02:11] healing
[1:02:12] and i believe that we will have
[1:02:14] afflictions
[1:02:16] but i also believe in healing
[1:02:18] afflictions
[1:02:22] i also believe in affliction that
[1:02:24] produces
[1:02:25] healing david said before
[1:02:29] i was afflicted i went astray but now i
[1:02:32] have kept thy
[1:02:34] word physical pain can produce that in
[1:02:38] your life and if god has to do that as
[1:02:39] we've preached here many times before if
[1:02:41] god has to turn the screws
[1:02:43] in your life and it turns into physical
[1:02:46] suffering god will do that if
[1:02:48] it produces godly character
[1:02:53] you know how many times you've prayed in
[1:02:55] your own life
[1:02:57] and and the bible says in psalms i think
[1:02:59] it sums
[1:03:00] david speaks this in psalms 34 and says
[1:03:03] many
[1:03:04] are the afflictions of the righteous
[1:03:07] but the lord god delivereth them from
[1:03:10] them all
[1:03:12] that means that will we go through pain
[1:03:15] yes
[1:03:16] that's a guaranteed you will go through
[1:03:19] things that
[1:03:20] hurt things that as we preached here two
[1:03:22] weeks ago things that don't make sense
[1:03:25] things that you don't have answers to
[1:03:28] things that you can't
[1:03:29] rationalize humanly speaking
[1:03:33] and god promises to deliver us but it
[1:03:35] doesn't mean there's not
[1:03:37] pain
[1:03:40] i i feel just so tugged in my heart here
[1:03:44] just to pull over just for a moment
[1:03:47] and i i thought about this
[1:03:50] so vividly recently even
[1:03:54] talking me and brother brother nate uh
[1:03:58] dougal was just having a phone
[1:03:59] conversation and just speaking about
[1:04:02] this
[1:04:02] and it just so spoke to my heart as i
[1:04:04] was we were just fellowshipping and
[1:04:06] expressing
[1:04:07] and you know i thought it was so amazing
[1:04:09] when you look at the life of job
[1:04:12] and you you think you think to yourself
[1:04:15] you know why
[1:04:18] why i've understood the afflictions and
[1:04:22] i've looked at the life of job and we go
[1:04:24] through his entire story
[1:04:25] and even at the end of all of it and he
[1:04:28] asked the question
[1:04:29] what shall a man when a flower dies that
[1:04:31] comes back and the flower with the plant
[1:04:33] wither
[1:04:34] job says but if a man die shall he live
[1:04:36] again and the prophet of god says and
[1:04:37] you know you ask the question
[1:04:39] why you know lord why why
[1:04:42] why go through this what is the purpose
[1:04:44] for this
[1:04:46] what why did this happen why did why did
[1:04:49] why did it take place
[1:04:50] why did the things that were out of my
[1:04:52] control as many times in our own life
[1:04:54] take place
[1:04:55] and you know you ask that question even
[1:04:57] of job why did he why did he go through
[1:04:59] it
[1:04:59] you know and you look and you say i know
[1:05:01] what the answer is i know the
[1:05:03] human answers i know the answers that i
[1:05:05] can look to and say well
[1:05:07] you know job didn't see chapter one in
[1:05:09] chapter two he didn't see the
[1:05:10] conversation that
[1:05:12] the devil has with god and says that you
[1:05:14] know and basically there's a there's a
[1:05:16] challenge set forth and
[1:05:17] man just your children just serve you
[1:05:19] because of what you give them remove the
[1:05:21] hedge touch them and
[1:05:23] watch what happens and so job doesn't
[1:05:25] know his life is caught up in a mystery
[1:05:28] in another dimension and he's going
[1:05:29] through things i know that answer
[1:05:31] and and i know what the word says about
[1:05:34] that but i still after that ask the
[1:05:36] question humanly why why did why did a
[1:05:39] man like this who would shoot evil love
[1:05:41] god yet he goes through such
[1:05:43] torment in his life you as you say the
[1:05:46] same answer i know that it was
[1:05:48] it was it was uh for job it was so that
[1:05:51] us here in our life could go through
[1:05:53] pain
[1:05:54] and suffering and torment and we can
[1:05:56] look back at the life of job
[1:05:58] and see a man who god wrought
[1:05:59] righteousness in where he could say
[1:06:01] the lord god giveth and the lord god
[1:06:04] taketh away
[1:06:07] and you can answer that's why job went
[1:06:09] through suffering you could say
[1:06:11] you know the answer the prophet of god
[1:06:13] preaches the the
[1:06:14] the patience he speaks about the
[1:06:16] perseverance of job and says it was all
[1:06:18] so that man would ask a question
[1:06:20] what happens when a man dies you get all
[1:06:24] of those answers and you say
[1:06:26] they're they're satisfactory and they
[1:06:28] are answers that we believe
[1:06:30] but even in our own humanity we still
[1:06:33] ask the question
[1:06:34] and i'm not sure we know why i don't
[1:06:37] know that we have the answer
[1:06:39] all of the entirety of the answer
[1:06:42] as to why why did it happen
[1:06:48] why did it take place and i'm not sure
[1:06:51] on this side
[1:06:52] here's what i do know we will know
[1:06:57] what i do know is that we will know
[1:07:00] but i'm not going to pretend that i do
[1:07:02] know now
[1:07:04] and i think there's such a trap so many
[1:07:06] times in our mind because we have to
[1:07:08] know why
[1:07:09] why why why why
[1:07:15] i was reminded so much of a story and i
[1:07:17] don't think i've ever told this here
[1:07:18] before
[1:07:20] of a brother and it was fellowship with
[1:07:22] a brother here just a few weeks ago
[1:07:23] about this
[1:07:24] and he was just asking the same exact
[1:07:26] questions we look at suffering and say
[1:07:28] why did it happen
[1:07:29] why did he go through it why was what
[1:07:32] was the purpose and
[1:07:33] and we prayed and maybe you've had a
[1:07:35] need over a loved one i'll never forget
[1:07:38] you know the prayers that i prayed for
[1:07:40] you know one of my
[1:07:41] close friend of mine employee of mine
[1:07:42] who loved the lord with all of his heart
[1:07:45] loved his family loved life young didn't
[1:07:47] want to die
[1:07:48] gets cancer believe the lord is going to
[1:07:50] heal him of it believed with all of his
[1:07:52] heart
[1:07:53] shared with him as much as i possibly
[1:07:54] could yet he's gone
[1:07:56] yet he passes away and we search human
[1:07:59] humanly we search in lost and i know
[1:08:01] that's one of the hardest cases you
[1:08:02] could bring
[1:08:03] but i i know in our own life if if you
[1:08:06] was to map
[1:08:07] out your own personal life you have
[1:08:08] different spots that you can look back
[1:08:10] historically in your mind and go why
[1:08:14] but i don't understand why why did life
[1:08:17] take a
[1:08:17] left turn when i it should have kept
[1:08:19] straight why did it take a right turn
[1:08:21] there when it should have went left i
[1:08:22] don't understand that
[1:08:25] and i i was so encouraged
[1:08:29] hearing the testimony and i wish i could
[1:08:32] share it with you if it was
[1:08:33] uh if it was taped or recorded and it
[1:08:36] was but i wish i could play it for you
[1:08:38] don't have the time to do that now
[1:08:40] there's a lo a wonderful friend of mine
[1:08:43] brother steve burson pastor in quebec
[1:08:46] and kennedy came and preached a sermon
[1:08:48] called our origins
[1:08:49] and brother steve at a young age uh
[1:08:52] was his father had left him in his life
[1:08:56] and and and he was raised by his mother
[1:08:58] his whole life
[1:08:59] uh it was raised by his mother i forget
[1:09:01] the age i may get some of that detail
[1:09:03] wrong if this goes out and people hear
[1:09:05] it
[1:09:05] could stand correction on the age that
[1:09:07] he was when it happened
[1:09:08] but his father he began to relate how
[1:09:10] his father had left
[1:09:12] at an early age 12 or so years old
[1:09:15] and and and there was a lot of just a
[1:09:17] lot of a different thing that had took
[1:09:19] place in the family and the marriage
[1:09:21] and and they were from the the his
[1:09:23] father was from greece
[1:09:25] and they had migrated to quebec and uh
[1:09:28] just through different struggles in his
[1:09:30] life his father leaves
[1:09:32] and walks out on the family i mean
[1:09:33] completely walks out disappears
[1:09:35] goes back to greece and doesn't have any
[1:09:38] contact or communication with the son
[1:09:40] and now steve is raised by the for the
[1:09:42] rest of his life
[1:09:43] not ever knowing his father not ever not
[1:09:46] ever not ever uh
[1:09:47] be meeting you know getting to know him
[1:09:49] in any kind of uh
[1:09:50] quality way at all and now steve's life
[1:09:52] goes on
[1:09:53] he goes into come becau as a result of
[1:09:56] that goes
[1:09:56] and just lashes out into the world and
[1:09:59] and
[1:10:00] and just has a you know running from the
[1:10:02] lord gets in trouble with the law
[1:10:04] and and with the group of of other
[1:10:06] teenagers just as a rin it turns into a
[1:10:08] renegade
[1:10:09] completely runs the other direction from
[1:10:11] the lord and a lot of times
[1:10:13] some of the outbursts that we see in
[1:10:16] people's life
[1:10:17] is an outburst to the pain or the
[1:10:19] rejection or the
[1:10:20] suffering that they've went to and they
[1:10:22] lash out
[1:10:25] and they're lashing out at the world
[1:10:28] because of the suffering they went
[1:10:29] through in the end
[1:10:30] because of all the questions in his mind
[1:10:32] and he's raised without the influence of
[1:10:34] his father
[1:10:36] and he goes through his life and he and
[1:10:38] he's and he runs from
[1:10:40] the lord and his mother godly sister
[1:10:43] still to this day
[1:10:44] and is praying for him believing for him
[1:10:47] praying for him believing for him
[1:10:48] ministering to him still living with her
[1:10:50] with with his mother and his mother
[1:10:52] constantly ministering unto him and
[1:10:54] holding on to him and never letting go
[1:10:56] of him and always believing for him and
[1:10:59] always believing the best as i believe
[1:11:01] any godly mother will do
[1:11:04] and just holding on to faith and it was
[1:11:07] it's amazing because his life goes on
[1:11:09] and the lord finally at
[1:11:10] 18 19 20 i forget what age it was maybe
[1:11:13] later than that
[1:11:14] the lord gets a hold of him and just
[1:11:16] fills him with the holy spirit and does
[1:11:18] such a miraculous work in his life and
[1:11:20] answers the prayer to his mother and
[1:11:22] eventually becomes the pastor marries
[1:11:25] the the the pastor's daughter has a
[1:11:27] wonderful family becomes a pastor of a
[1:11:29] church and
[1:11:30] is a wonderful minister uh today with a
[1:11:32] beautiful family
[1:11:34] and you look at the carnage that could
[1:11:36] have been if the devil had his way
[1:11:38] but god makes all things beautiful in
[1:11:40] his own time in his own season
[1:11:43] and and you and he started to you know
[1:11:46] in his lifetime
[1:11:47] his children are older his son is 11 12
[1:11:50] years old his older son william and his
[1:11:52] has four or five girls um and and he has
[1:11:55] a
[1:11:56] great family and and he starts to get
[1:11:58] the question in his mind
[1:12:00] you know whatever happened to my dad
[1:12:01] doesn't i don't know that he even knew
[1:12:02] if his dad was alive
[1:12:04] had no way to reach him if he had died
[1:12:06] dad just had walked out on him never had
[1:12:08] knew him and he starts to get that
[1:12:09] feeling of what
[1:12:10] you know where is he at what's he doing
[1:12:13] and so he searches him looks him
[1:12:15] finds him finds him you know modern
[1:12:17] technology today
[1:12:18] uh used for a good purpose and he's he's
[1:12:21] finds his father
[1:12:22] he's in greece and so he's somehow you
[1:12:25] know just to fast forward some of the
[1:12:26] story
[1:12:27] he somehow makes contact with him
[1:12:30] any any any and he begins to uh
[1:12:33] he he makes contact with him some you
[1:12:35] know and and finds out that he where he
[1:12:37] lives and
[1:12:38] so he he he he goes to a true
[1:12:41] on a trip by himself to greece and he
[1:12:44] meets his father
[1:12:45] and it's amazing because he he
[1:12:49] his his father is you know is opening
[1:12:51] arms and
[1:12:52] welcoming him and oh stephen and now
[1:12:54] there's this great restoration to their
[1:12:57] uh to their to their friendship and to
[1:12:59] their life and to their family and
[1:13:01] and and and out of all of this searching
[1:13:04] that steve had in his life he finally
[1:13:05] finds his
[1:13:07] father and and there's there's this
[1:13:10] great
[1:13:10] love and great joy and great acceptance
[1:13:13] and
[1:13:14] then he's he begins to share pictures of
[1:13:17] his children and his family and oh
[1:13:19] you have grandchildren and you have
[1:13:21] children who love you and
[1:13:22] and and you're a grandpa and his
[1:13:24] father's crying and and
[1:13:25] it's just a great you know weeping and
[1:13:27] rejoicing him
[1:13:29] and and then there's this bitterness
[1:13:31] that starts to set in
[1:13:33] steve's heart and he starts to say why
[1:13:35] lord
[1:13:36] i don't understand why why was i
[1:13:39] kept from this man there's a wonderful
[1:13:43] man could have been a grandfather to my
[1:13:44] children and why did you
[1:13:46] take him out of my life he was just
[1:13:48] ripped away and he starts to recount now
[1:13:50] he
[1:13:50] outwardly you know he's got a smile you
[1:13:52] would never know but anyway he's
[1:13:54] struggling with this
[1:13:55] and he's struggling saying why did it
[1:13:57] happen why did it take place i don't
[1:13:59] i don't understand and and and now his
[1:14:02] father
[1:14:02] his father tells him you have other
[1:14:04] brothers and in the pictures they look
[1:14:06] identical to him look just like him
[1:14:08] and he says you have other brothers but
[1:14:10] you're not going to meet them i don't
[1:14:12] want anyone to know my family here my
[1:14:13] wife here has no idea i've ever had
[1:14:15] another life
[1:14:17] and now there's that same acceptance and
[1:14:19] now that rejection
[1:14:21] the rejection is a hard thing he's
[1:14:24] rejected and says i don't
[1:14:25] you got to keep it a secret you're not
[1:14:26] allowed to reach out to them you can't
[1:14:28] say anything you've got to keep it
[1:14:29] airtight you don't
[1:14:30] i don't want this out but i love you and
[1:14:32] i accept you but they can't know
[1:14:35] and now the bitterness just intensifies
[1:14:38] just the carnage and the wreckage and oh
[1:14:41] lord how did this happen
[1:14:42] how's my life such a mess my family and
[1:14:45] don't know my father and he goes back to
[1:14:47] quebec and then he
[1:14:48] takes his family takes another trip
[1:14:49] takes his wife and all of his children
[1:14:51] and they meet
[1:14:52] their grandfather and i think they took
[1:14:54] one or two trips and steve's just
[1:14:56] testifying about just in his own heart
[1:14:59] that question that we've asked so many
[1:15:00] times
[1:15:01] why lord doesn't make any sense why this
[1:15:04] would happen in my life
[1:15:06] and then he he tells how that he goes
[1:15:09] back over
[1:15:10] to uh to come to to greece with his
[1:15:13] family and his father's there and his
[1:15:15] father's meeting his children and
[1:15:17] and he's you know and he's he's he's
[1:15:20] meeting his grandchildren for the first
[1:15:21] time and
[1:15:22] and he starts to tell his he starts to
[1:15:24] tell his grandson
[1:15:26] william who's the oldest who's about the
[1:15:29] same age that steve was when his dad had
[1:15:31] left
[1:15:32] and he starts to in this moment begins
[1:15:35] to say if i ever could tell you anything
[1:15:37] william you know if i could ever teach
[1:15:39] you anything in your life if i could
[1:15:40] ever give you anything from grandfather
[1:15:42] to you
[1:15:43] you know he says i want you to go home
[1:15:45] in him i want you to listen to frank
[1:15:47] sinatra as i did it my way
[1:15:49] and he says i want you to listen to that
[1:15:51] every day of your life now
[1:15:53] steve had remembered in his mind that i
[1:15:55] had preached a sermon at his church
[1:15:57] and spoke how that the author of the
[1:15:59] satanic bible
[1:16:00] when he was asked what is the most
[1:16:02] satanic song of our generation he said
[1:16:04] frank sinatra's i did it my way
[1:16:08] we've preached that here before all
[1:16:10] about self and all about i
[1:16:12] didn't let anybody tell me what to do i
[1:16:14] did it my way and he says he's
[1:16:16] you know here's his father now here's
[1:16:18] his father and he says and something
[1:16:20] just happens
[1:16:21] like he just had a out of body of
[1:16:23] experience
[1:16:25] and he says then something just happens
[1:16:27] and i'm watching
[1:16:28] in the living room everything's
[1:16:30] happening children over here wife of
[1:16:31] reason and everything just drops quiet
[1:16:34] and now everything was still happening
[1:16:35] but he said in my mind he said the holy
[1:16:37] spirit started dealing with me
[1:16:38] and i'm watching my dad tell my son you
[1:16:41] go home and you listen to this william
[1:16:43] and you make this your mantra and this
[1:16:45] is the code i've lived by
[1:16:46] and this is what i believe and you live
[1:16:48] this the rest of your life and you don't
[1:16:50] ever let anybody
[1:16:51] and he said and i was watching this man
[1:16:54] and he says and then i see
[1:16:55] myself there i am and i'm william and
[1:16:57] there's that man
[1:16:59] and here's his strong influence on my
[1:17:01] life
[1:17:04] and he said the holy spirit stopped me
[1:17:06] and spoke to me and says
[1:17:08] that's why i removed that man from your
[1:17:11] life
[1:17:14] because had i not that william your son
[1:17:18] would have been you
[1:17:19] and that would have been your tutor and
[1:17:21] your leader in life and you wouldn't
[1:17:23] have the family
[1:17:24] and the life that you have today because
[1:17:26] you would have been subjected to the
[1:17:28] leadership of this man so i
[1:17:30] had to make a hard decision and remove
[1:17:32] that man from your life to protect you
[1:17:34] from that
[1:17:35] influence
[1:17:38] and you know what happened all of that
[1:17:40] bitterness and all of that pain began to
[1:17:42] leave
[1:17:44] and you know what that was that was god
[1:17:46] by his grace and his
[1:17:47] mercy who steve who only had one half of
[1:17:51] the story
[1:17:52] god said i'm going to give you the other
[1:17:54] half of the story
[1:17:58] so many times i told that entire
[1:18:00] testimony
[1:18:01] to tell you that it doesn't
[1:18:04] the the the the for job we may not have
[1:18:08] the answer but here's what i know
[1:18:09] there's an
[1:18:10] answer for your life we may not have an
[1:18:13] answer but there's an answer
[1:18:15] that god knows let me just stop and say
[1:18:17] this to you today
[1:18:18] no matter where you've been or what
[1:18:20] you've been through of what you've lost
[1:18:22] god knows what you lost
[1:18:24] no matter who walked out of you in your
[1:18:25] life god knows who walked out of you
[1:18:28] in your life no matter what you didn't
[1:18:29] couldn't have because god wouldn't allow
[1:18:31] you he understands that
[1:18:33] and he's doing it working it all for his
[1:18:35] own purposes
[1:18:38] whether you ever get the other half of
[1:18:40] the story or not in this life
[1:18:43] david couldn't understand job couldn't
[1:18:45] understand that half of the story
[1:18:47] why naomi ruth orpah
[1:18:50] here's a man paralleled we know the
[1:18:53] great
[1:18:54] pattern of of the church and the israel
[1:18:57] and and
[1:18:58] and all of the types and the shadows but
[1:18:59] you imagine a woman
[1:19:01] like ruth or naomi
[1:19:04] who had lived with a man named elimelech
[1:19:07] who was her provider he was her
[1:19:09] her arm her her protector her shield he
[1:19:12] he was her husband the figure the man of
[1:19:15] her life
[1:19:16] and now there's a famine you go read the
[1:19:19] book of ruth the first few words say
[1:19:21] there was a famine in bethlehem judea
[1:19:25] and so now this great famine causes this
[1:19:27] man to leave
[1:19:29] to leave the promise of god to leave the
[1:19:31] land of god
[1:19:32] and the bible says that he leaves and he
[1:19:34] sojourns in the land of moab
[1:19:36] and he takes ruth and then you know and
[1:19:39] takes naomi
[1:19:41] and if you go and read this this entire
[1:19:44] story of the sadness
[1:19:45] of what happens now elimelech uh
[1:19:48] uh her her her daughters naomi's
[1:19:51] daughters
[1:19:52] mary uh boys here here was here's now
[1:19:55] she has son-in-law she has a husband
[1:19:57] and now they're all three every figure
[1:20:00] every man in her life that she loved
[1:20:03] dies
[1:20:05] one by one lemon-like then her son
[1:20:07] mayhellon chileon
[1:20:09] pass away and now she's left with two
[1:20:11] daughter-in-laws
[1:20:14] ruth the moabitis orpah
[1:20:18] and herself and everything in her life
[1:20:21] everything that she had ever known she
[1:20:24] had suddenly lost
[1:20:27] and you and and and no doubt naomi says
[1:20:31] it this way
[1:20:32] she says i left empty i left full
[1:20:35] and i've won and i'm empty i lost
[1:20:38] everything even in famine now she's lost
[1:20:42] i i was reading this today and and here
[1:20:45] in god's prophet he preaches the message
[1:20:47] kinsman redeemer
[1:20:48] and i thought what a what a loss
[1:20:53] that that she she goes through the the
[1:20:55] the
[1:20:56] the cup of pain that she served that god
[1:20:59] removes
[1:21:00] everything from her life and now she's
[1:21:02] saying i'm bitter and
[1:21:03] i'm filled with bitterness and so much
[1:21:05] pain i just stomp just for a moment to
[1:21:07] highlight her story
[1:21:09] because it ends so differently than how
[1:21:11] you start
[1:21:12] the book of ruth but it's amazing
[1:21:14] because
[1:21:15] i i i i looking through this i'd read a
[1:21:19] quote
[1:21:19] and it was just so powerful i just
[1:21:21] wanted to read it to you
[1:21:22] uh here today and i hope it's okay
[1:21:25] it's a it's a just a quotation from a
[1:21:28] book that a man had written was so
[1:21:29] powerful
[1:21:30] about these three women about ruth naomi
[1:21:32] and orpah
[1:21:34] and he's and he talks about how that
[1:21:36] these three women
[1:21:37] their commonality what what brought them
[1:21:40] together what they had in common
[1:21:42] was pain loss after they had lost their
[1:21:45] husbands and she had lost hers all three
[1:21:47] of them had lost
[1:21:49] all three of them had pain that did that
[1:21:51] made no sense whatsoever
[1:21:53] and they asked this question why
[1:21:56] well you know and and the the the it
[1:21:59] says pain
[1:22:00] is a strange company keeper
[1:22:03] it brings the oddest people together
[1:22:07] there is a secret fraternity listen
[1:22:09] close to this
[1:22:10] there is a secret fraternity that exists
[1:22:14] between people who have been in pain
[1:22:16] that is mind-boggling
[1:22:19] meaning the same exact type of loss
[1:22:22] it transcends the color of your skin
[1:22:25] when you have been through certain
[1:22:26] things that other people have been
[1:22:28] through
[1:22:29] you feel like you can relate you can
[1:22:32] take two people
[1:22:33] who have nothing in common but let them
[1:22:36] experience the same thing
[1:22:38] as a human being and there is an
[1:22:40] affinity
[1:22:41] and a bond that comes between those two
[1:22:44] people
[1:22:44] because they can relate to each other
[1:22:47] and enter in you remember brother
[1:22:48] branham says you could never enter in
[1:22:50] and pray for someone until you enter
[1:22:53] into their suffering
[1:22:55] he says when you want to pray for
[1:22:57] someone he says try to enter into how
[1:22:59] they feel
[1:23:00] and relate to how they feel enter into
[1:23:02] their suffering
[1:23:05] you can take two people have nothing in
[1:23:06] common but let them experience the same
[1:23:08] thing and there's affinity of bond
[1:23:09] between those two people
[1:23:10] you feel for other people who have been
[1:23:13] through those things because you can
[1:23:14] relate to them
[1:23:16] and he stops and he says i personally
[1:23:19] don't like
[1:23:20] to have a lot to do with people who have
[1:23:22] never been through
[1:23:23] pain it says i don't like
[1:23:27] i don't have a lot to do with people who
[1:23:29] have never been through pain or
[1:23:31] suffering
[1:23:32] it's nothing against them i hold nothing
[1:23:34] against them
[1:23:35] i just can't relate to them and i'm sure
[1:23:38] they will not be able to relate to me
[1:23:41] and he stops and he says because and
[1:23:43] this man had went through great
[1:23:45] suffering a great
[1:23:45] loss and he says because the parts of me
[1:23:48] the things that make up me
[1:23:50] the parts of me that i need to have
[1:23:53] fellowship in
[1:23:54] the parts of me that i need to be
[1:23:58] touched the parts of me that i need
[1:24:01] held in are tied up are
[1:24:04] bound up not in the successes
[1:24:07] of my life but they are tied up and
[1:24:10] bound up in the struggles
[1:24:14] of my life for god has
[1:24:17] done more through my struggles
[1:24:21] than in my successes and if you can look
[1:24:25] carefully at all of my success and all
[1:24:28] of my successes
[1:24:30] they are made out of the ingredients
[1:24:33] of my struggles
[1:24:37] and you could never know my successes
[1:24:41] until you understand my struggles
[1:24:44] because they are the pathway
[1:24:47] that led me to my successes
[1:24:51] god used that suffering god used that
[1:24:54] pain
[1:24:55] in her life to drive her out of that
[1:24:57] land so that there was a woman named
[1:25:00] ruth
[1:25:00] who could catch the eyes of a man named
[1:25:02] boaz and boaz could spread a skirt
[1:25:05] around a little moabite woman and could
[1:25:08] come through redemption because god knew
[1:25:10] that her line and her lineage would end
[1:25:12] up
[1:25:13] producing the lineage of jesus christ
[1:25:16] and so god
[1:25:16] orchestrated and manipulated her life
[1:25:19] all for one purpose and one divine
[1:25:22] reason whether they understood why
[1:25:25] they went through the pain that they
[1:25:26] went through
[1:25:29] i go back to this and it's amazing when
[1:25:31] you think about
[1:25:33] this struggle that you see
[1:25:36] when when when job says he says it's a
[1:25:41] uh or g g this is uh let me let me find
[1:25:43] this scripture
[1:25:44] in john 11. jesus said unto him and this
[1:25:47] is
[1:25:47] after jesus is going through this
[1:25:49] suffering in gethsemane
[1:25:52] and he says put away thy sword
[1:25:55] into thy sheaf this is john 18 11.
[1:25:59] he speaks to peter peter's trying to
[1:26:01] understand all this what's happening
[1:26:03] what's happening you know you're
[1:26:04] supposed to be the great hero you're
[1:26:06] going to set up your kingdom and now
[1:26:07] he's being arrested
[1:26:08] and now he's being taken and all of his
[1:26:09] expectation has been dashed
[1:26:11] and so the bible says peter pulls out
[1:26:13] his sword and he cuts the ear off to the
[1:26:15] roman soldier
[1:26:17] and jesus says put away
[1:26:21] put the put up thy sword into the sheaf
[1:26:24] the cup which my father hath given me
[1:26:27] shall i not drink it
[1:26:30] the cup which my father notice notice
[1:26:34] not the cup that the devil's serving me
[1:26:38] but the cup which my father
[1:26:41] you see when you can see whose hand it
[1:26:43] is
[1:26:44] that is serving you your trial it
[1:26:47] changes
[1:26:47] everything in your perspective when you
[1:26:50] can look at your problem or what you
[1:26:51] went through and you can change and
[1:26:53] realize
[1:26:54] the cup that my father is serving me
[1:26:57] then it changes your entire perspective
[1:26:59] and you can
[1:27:00] truly say by revelation as we saying
[1:27:03] my father knows what i need in
[1:27:06] everything i go through he knows what's
[1:27:09] best
[1:27:14] even when you don't see the purpose
[1:27:16] behind it you can drink
[1:27:18] that cup of pain because you can see
[1:27:21] your father serving it
[1:27:28] the loss and the confusion even that
[1:27:31] jesus feels
[1:27:32] in his own humanity let's pick it up in
[1:27:35] matthew 26 verse 38 not going to be much
[1:27:37] longer
[1:27:38] here this morning jesus says my soul is
[1:27:41] exceedingly sorrowful matthew 26
[1:27:44] verse if you want to put it on the
[1:27:46] screen and those that are turning that's
[1:27:48] just fine
[1:27:49] he says my soul is exceedingly sorrowful
[1:27:53] even unto death can you imagine
[1:27:56] the son of god saying this
[1:28:00] i'm exceedingly sorrowful but wait jesus
[1:28:03] didn't you know
[1:28:04] didn't you see all the plan didn't you
[1:28:06] see everything clearly then you
[1:28:07] understand that
[1:28:08] all of this was for redemption and
[1:28:10] salvation you're going to go to calvary
[1:28:12] it's going to be a great thing and
[1:28:13] there's going to be people who rejoice
[1:28:14] and celebrate in all of this but
[1:28:16] notice for a moment in his own humanity
[1:28:20] he says my soul is exceedingly sorrowful
[1:28:25] unto death it'd be prior to this he says
[1:28:29] a little while the world sees me but you
[1:28:31] he says a little while and you shall not
[1:28:33] see me because i go to my father
[1:28:35] yet even in this moment i love this so
[1:28:37] much because the prophet of god says
[1:28:39] he was one don't ever let anybody tell
[1:28:42] you that jesus was not a man
[1:28:46] and he says he was in every way
[1:28:49] a man and he says
[1:28:52] and don't ever let anybody tell you that
[1:28:54] he was not god
[1:28:56] because he was in every way god
[1:29:00] such a separation completely human
[1:29:04] a kinsmen redeemer could feel could be
[1:29:06] touched by the feelings of our
[1:29:07] infirmities
[1:29:08] because he knew what loneliness felt he
[1:29:10] knew what confusion was
[1:29:13] he knew what a what suffering that
[1:29:15] caused confusion and calls this
[1:29:17] this this feeling the sense of what's
[1:29:19] happened and what's taking place jesus
[1:29:21] knew what it was
[1:29:22] to go through that he knew his
[1:29:26] he knew also that there was he was under
[1:29:30] a
[1:29:30] he was under a a a a messiah
[1:29:34] mission he was under a prophetic
[1:29:36] anointing because prophets had
[1:29:38] prophesied this moment
[1:29:39] he knew all of that he knew it was all
[1:29:40] leading to this yet the hardest
[1:29:43] part of his life that he goes through
[1:29:46] is in the last half hour in gethsemane
[1:29:50] the last half hour i want to emphasize
[1:29:53] that to you this morning
[1:29:54] it's the last half hour of your pain
[1:29:57] that is the hardest
[1:29:58] to endure it is the last moment the last
[1:30:02] half
[1:30:02] hour of his life when he's the most
[1:30:05] confused
[1:30:06] the most pain before the light dawns
[1:30:08] before the victory
[1:30:12] it's that last moment in his life david
[1:30:16] says therefore is psalms 134 you don't
[1:30:19] need to you don't need to turn psalms
[1:30:21] 143
[1:30:22] 4 david says therefore is my spirit
[1:30:27] overwhelmed within me my heart
[1:30:30] within me is desolate peter faces the
[1:30:33] same exact confusion
[1:30:36] and he and so he gets so confused in the
[1:30:39] midst of all of the
[1:30:41] all of the the pressure that he's under
[1:30:43] that he
[1:30:44] curses
[1:30:47] and denies that he even knows the lord
[1:30:50] you say how did he get to that place
[1:30:52] because in his own humanity he gets so
[1:30:54] confused
[1:30:55] what's happening why is this happening
[1:30:58] here's the lord and now he's been
[1:31:00] rejected and now he's arrested this is
[1:31:02] not the script
[1:31:05] this is not how it was supposed to be
[1:31:08] this is not the ending of the story that
[1:31:10] i had planned
[1:31:11] this is not my expectation this is not
[1:31:14] the way it was supposed to go
[1:31:16] we were supposed to end it this way
[1:31:17] isn't that often time our
[1:31:19] struggle is when we try to match what
[1:31:24] our reality that we have in our own life
[1:31:27] and our own expectation
[1:31:29] and then we realize the lord says but oh
[1:31:31] but i've planned
[1:31:32] this
[1:31:38] am i preaching anybody here this morning
[1:31:41] job says in his dark hour
[1:31:45] of confusion he says lo he goes by me
[1:31:49] and i see him not he passeth
[1:31:52] on also but i perceive him not
[1:31:57] he goes i don't see him he passes by
[1:32:01] i can't perceive him
[1:32:04] i don't understand why
[1:32:08] is this happening why do i have to face
[1:32:10] this
[1:32:11] is it something i've done and and and so
[1:32:14] many times we could say
[1:32:15] lord i've not cheated anybody i've not
[1:32:17] done anything
[1:32:19] wrong i'm not i'm not living dishonestly
[1:32:22] why should i wh why why can't i get
[1:32:25] clear
[1:32:26] why can i get a clear word from my
[1:32:28] heavenly father
[1:32:30] why can't i get an answer let me say
[1:32:31] this that even the greatest
[1:32:33] the greatest sages the greatest men of
[1:32:35] god the greatest patriarchs the greatest
[1:32:38] anointed men the
[1:32:39] faith chapter of hebrews is made up of
[1:32:42] some of the greatest men who asked some
[1:32:44] of the greatest
[1:32:45] questions that they couldn't get answers
[1:32:47] to and they asked the same
[1:32:49] it had the same exact confusion in their
[1:32:51] life of why
[1:32:52] must it happen why
[1:32:56] some of the greatest men have not heard
[1:32:58] clearly even the most humble
[1:33:00] most profound even god's prophet
[1:33:03] asks the same exact question why
[1:33:09] and elijah brother branham says this in
[1:33:11] elijah under the juniper tree you can
[1:33:12] throw that slide up if you want brother
[1:33:15] on that on the screen there listen to
[1:33:16] what god's prophet says
[1:33:18] he says there he laid this is the
[1:33:20] prophet of god speaking about
[1:33:22] elijah just look this way just for a
[1:33:25] moment before you look there
[1:33:27] brother adam preaches this message what
[1:33:29] doest thou hear elijah and he's
[1:33:31] preaching about elijah under the juniper
[1:33:32] tree after
[1:33:33] he's had this great victory on mount
[1:33:35] carmel and
[1:33:37] and he's and this great victory of rain
[1:33:39] comes to the land and
[1:33:40] and all the prophecy and the words of
[1:33:42] the servant i see a
[1:33:43] cloud like a man's hand and all of this
[1:33:46] victory in celebration
[1:33:47] now elijah finds himself under the
[1:33:49] juniper tree ready to end his life ready
[1:33:52] to commit suicide rather just for god to
[1:33:53] take him off the earth
[1:33:55] and brother adam starts preaching he
[1:33:56] says there he laid under the juniper
[1:33:58] tree
[1:33:58] he didn't know what to do his
[1:34:02] nerves was broken he was shaking
[1:34:06] he was he says he was crying no doubt
[1:34:08] can you see that okay there in the back
[1:34:10] everybody can see that
[1:34:11] he says he was crying no doubt he was in
[1:34:15] a terrible condition
[1:34:16] and he says this many of us hit those
[1:34:19] places
[1:34:21] you know when i heard brother adam say
[1:34:22] that my heart immediately just tuned
[1:34:24] right in
[1:34:26] he says many of us hit those places
[1:34:28] especially after a mount carmel
[1:34:30] experience
[1:34:31] it was asked of me the other day by
[1:34:33] someone about that
[1:34:34] how what what would we do what can be
[1:34:37] done
[1:34:38] what can be done for us at that time
[1:34:41] prophet gives such a simple answer
[1:34:43] there's only one thing to do
[1:34:45] commit yourself to god
[1:34:50] commit yourself to god
[1:34:54] i've had those feelings after i come out
[1:34:56] of a meeting you could scroll to the
[1:34:58] next one
[1:34:59] it looked like i tried and preached and
[1:35:01] begged
[1:35:03] persuaded seen the angel of god
[1:35:06] sweep through a meeting do signs and
[1:35:08] wonders
[1:35:10] sit in a car on the outside and hear
[1:35:12] them cry brother brandon tells us
[1:35:14] another place he preached had a powerful
[1:35:16] outpouring of the spirit
[1:35:17] had seen god move and he says he leaves
[1:35:19] the meeting goes by a car
[1:35:20] and hears people snickering and laughing
[1:35:24] at the service brother man says go buy a
[1:35:27] car and
[1:35:28] on the outside and hear them say there's
[1:35:29] nothing but psychology
[1:35:31] there's nothing to that that's on
[1:35:33] nonsense
[1:35:35] oh and then i cried crawled under the
[1:35:38] juniper tree i think lord

[1:40:11] stopped and watched brother branham as
[1:40:13] he begins to talk about that
[1:40:14] and even if you listen to it i believe
[1:40:16] it's so important
[1:40:17] it's good to read a book it's better to
[1:40:19] play a tape
[1:40:23] it's good to read a book it's better to
[1:40:25] play a tape and listen to what he said
[1:40:27] you you could hear so much more i read
[1:40:30] and listen
[1:40:32] and brother baron begins you can hear in
[1:40:34] his voices he
[1:40:35] even for himself past this moment has
[1:40:38] already gotten a victory he's already
[1:40:39] moved on
[1:40:41] yeah when he begins to talk about this
[1:40:42] his voice begins to tremble
[1:40:45] and his own humanity he's reminded and
[1:40:47] all of all of the
[1:40:49] all of the the the the lingering
[1:40:53] because pain lingers and all of the
[1:40:57] lingering sorrow starts to come up and
[1:40:59] and he starts to come out of his his
[1:41:02] heart
[1:41:04] he begins as he says he begins to speak
[1:41:06] about this
[1:41:07] and brother branham you could hear him
[1:41:08] on that tape what doest thou hear
[1:41:10] elijah and he's so relating even to this
[1:41:13] moment he says i was there i was
[1:41:15] he said lay in under my own juniper tree
[1:41:18] and he says just didn't know what to do
[1:41:20] and
[1:41:20] he says god had already taken my wife
[1:41:23] and
[1:41:23] now my baby and he says and the the the
[1:41:26] the devil begins to come to me
[1:41:28] and he begins to say look at you look at
[1:41:30] your life and you've given up everything
[1:41:32] for the lord and
[1:41:33] everybody who you used to be your
[1:41:35] friends have now turned away from you
[1:41:36] and rejected you and
[1:41:37] brother and begins to just relate
[1:41:39] everything the devil was trying to tell
[1:41:41] him
[1:41:41] and whisper and lie and speak you think
[1:41:43] you're the only one the devil talks to
[1:41:47] you think the devil you're the only one
[1:41:49] who who's feeling
[1:41:50] thoughts of you think you're the only
[1:41:53] one
[1:41:55] you think you're the only one who has
[1:41:57] thoughts sometimes of just just walking
[1:41:59] away and said i give up and i can't even
[1:42:01] go on and i don't know what to do with
[1:42:02] my life and
[1:42:03] i just want to end i just want to end it
[1:42:04] just to get out of here that's too hard
[1:42:06] it's too great a thing to bear you think
[1:42:08] you're the only one
[1:42:09] let me tell you something friends satan
[1:42:11] is busy
[1:42:12] and he's busy whispering he's busy
[1:42:14] speaking and he's always trying to
[1:42:16] discourage and rob you of your faith
[1:42:21] and brother madam says he begin to
[1:42:22] whisper and say oh look at you and look
[1:42:24] at your life and
[1:42:25] he says and then you've watched god
[1:42:27] he'll be he'll heal others and raise the
[1:42:29] dead in your meetings
[1:42:30] and he says but when it comes to your
[1:42:31] own baby
[1:42:34] prophet of god said i begin to come to
[1:42:36] that place
[1:42:38] and he says and i said lord and he's
[1:42:40] praying there in the room and he says oh
[1:42:42] god don't take her
[1:42:43] lord anything but my baby lord anything
[1:42:46] god he says but
[1:42:47] he says and there was a black sheet that
[1:42:49] just dropped and he said as if to say
[1:42:52] shut up now i know that's not a popular
[1:42:56] part of that life story but it's what
[1:42:58] the prophet of god said
[1:43:00] he says if the holy spirit just was
[1:43:01] saying shut up i don't even want to hear
[1:43:03] you
[1:43:04] and you imagine the rejection and the
[1:43:07] feeling in his heart
[1:43:10] and you say well you know that was god's
[1:43:12] prophet and he had been so
[1:43:14] deep in the woods with the lord so many
[1:43:16] times and just had such a
[1:43:18] experience you know surely you know
[1:43:20] god's prophet would have
[1:43:22] never walked away from the lord he would
[1:43:24] no matter what he ever went through
[1:43:25] surely
[1:43:26] you know maybe me maybe you brother but
[1:43:28] even you know but
[1:43:29] brother branham would have never well
[1:43:31] let me tell you what brother branham
[1:43:32] says
[1:43:33] before you make him more than a human
[1:43:35] being
[1:43:36] let me tell you what god's prophet says
[1:43:39] god's prophet says and i was going to
[1:43:41] say if you won't heal
[1:43:43] my baby i won't serve you
[1:43:50] i know we'd like to create this portrait
[1:43:52] in this image of
[1:43:53] you know at that moment you know brother
[1:43:55] branham just started to say it but then
[1:43:57] oh no i can't
[1:43:57] i won't go that far and i'm not going to
[1:43:59] step over that is no no no no no no hold
[1:44:01] on it'll do you better
[1:44:03] trust me it'll do you a lot more good
[1:44:05] understanding the humanity of a man like
[1:44:08] the prophet who god can use
[1:44:10] it'll do you a lot more good than trying
[1:44:12] to lift him up into fantasy and
[1:44:14] unreality
[1:44:15] let me give you the reality of here for
[1:44:17] a moment he was ready to throw
[1:44:20] in the towel
[1:44:23] and said if you won't heal my baby i
[1:44:25] won't
[1:44:27] serve you and brother branham tells us
[1:44:31] in three different places he said
[1:44:32] that's the way i would have gone that's
[1:44:35] what i had
[1:44:36] would have said if william branham would
[1:44:39] have been in control in that moment
[1:44:41] how would he have responded to that type
[1:44:43] of pain he said i would have told him
[1:44:45] if you won't heal my baby i won't even
[1:44:48] serve you and brother burnham says but
[1:44:51] when i went to go
[1:44:53] speak those words when the thought
[1:44:55] entered my mind and i put breath in my
[1:44:58] lungs and began to
[1:44:59] speak them if you won't heal my baby
[1:45:02] then
[1:45:03] i won't and he said but then something
[1:45:07] happened
[1:45:10] something happened you know he does that
[1:45:13] same exact thing with the bull
[1:45:15] you remember the bull that was going to
[1:45:17] kill him and the prophet of god says
[1:45:19] i i reached for my pistol
[1:45:24] and he says and it wasn't there
[1:45:28] he we we create these stories sometimes
[1:45:31] and we forget what the prophet of god
[1:45:32] said
[1:45:33] oh brother benjamin that bull he just
[1:45:34] spoke to that he created atmosphere but
[1:45:36] remember his first human reaction was to
[1:45:38] grab a pistol and shoot it
[1:45:41] and he says the same exact thing he says
[1:45:43] i went from a pistol he wasn't there and
[1:45:45] he said then
[1:45:46] something happened a love dropped in my
[1:45:49] heart
[1:45:51] it wasn't it wasn't the love of of the
[1:45:54] prophet
[1:45:54] it was the love of god and he says and i
[1:45:57] said oh mr
[1:45:58] bull i'm so sorry he says i'm so sorry
[1:46:02] i've invaded your space and here i've
[1:46:04] came up and and
[1:46:06] he says oh perfect love took over in
[1:46:08] that moment
[1:46:10] but i want you to understand here this
[1:46:12] morning that was something outside
[1:46:14] it was something not here on the outside
[1:46:16] it was something
[1:46:18] on the inside that created the right
[1:46:20] atmosphere
[1:46:21] that got brother branham into a state of
[1:46:23] perfect love
[1:46:24] and he says and when i was just about to
[1:46:26] speak that he said something deep
[1:46:29] something down something weighed down in
[1:46:32] my soul
[1:46:33] as if he didn't know it was even there
[1:46:35] he said
[1:46:36] something at that moment at the midst of
[1:46:39] my
[1:46:39] my greatest weakness something grabbed a
[1:46:42] hold of me
[1:46:43] and he says and i just stopped and he
[1:46:46] said
[1:46:47] you shipment you sailors you know about
[1:46:50] that
[1:46:52] and he says you remember he says when
[1:46:55] you were
[1:46:55] out there and he says and you were on
[1:46:57] the seas
[1:46:59] and he says and your boat got out of
[1:47:01] control he even starts to relate this
[1:47:03] story
[1:47:04] and brother vernon says you your boat
[1:47:05] got out of control and he says and you
[1:47:07] didn't know what to do
[1:47:08] he said you were going to be destroyed
[1:47:10] by the billows and the waves are going
[1:47:12] to
[1:47:12] going to knock you over and we're going
[1:47:14] to capsize your boat
[1:47:17] and he says but you sailors he says what
[1:47:19] do you do he says you take a hold of
[1:47:21] that anchor
[1:47:22] and he says and you drop that anchor and
[1:47:24] he says and when you drop that anchor
[1:47:26] there's the blackness of the ocean it
[1:47:28] says you can't see what's down there
[1:47:30] you don't know he says but you let that
[1:47:32] anchor go
[1:47:33] and he says and you don't know what's
[1:47:35] underneath there but you believe
[1:47:37] down there in your heart there's a faith
[1:47:40] in your heart that says though i can't
[1:47:42] see what's down there
[1:47:44] i believe there's a rock at the bottom
[1:47:46] of the ocean
[1:47:47] and i believe that that anchor is going
[1:47:50] to catch a hold of that rock
[1:47:52] and that anchor when i can't hold myself
[1:47:55] and when my boat's about to capsize
[1:47:57] he says i have faith that that anchor
[1:47:59] will hold
[1:48:00] me in the time of my greatest battle and
[1:48:04] my greatest storm
[1:48:05] oh and the prophet of god stops and he
[1:48:07] says and friend whether you realize this
[1:48:10] or not
[1:48:10] when you came to christ you dropped your
[1:48:14] anchor and he says and whether you
[1:48:18] realize now he's relating that story to
[1:48:20] himself
[1:48:21] and he says i was about to give up and
[1:48:23] he says but something
[1:48:24] whether you realized it or not when you
[1:48:26] came to christ
[1:48:27] you dropped your anchor and he says and
[1:48:29] your anchor is not
[1:48:31] held by your emotions your anchor
[1:48:34] what holds you in church after trial
[1:48:36] what holds you so that you can lift your
[1:48:38] hands and say lord
[1:48:39] though you slay me yet i'll serve you he
[1:48:41] says that's not you
[1:48:43] that's something outside of you that's
[1:48:45] because you dropped your anchor in
[1:48:47] christ
[1:48:48] and he says and that anchor will hold
[1:48:50] you when you can't hold yourself
[1:48:53] when you're ready to give up and turn it
[1:48:56] all loose
[1:48:56] and walk away he said just trust that
[1:48:59] anchor that in that moment when you
[1:49:01] don't even believe you have it within
[1:49:03] yourself
[1:49:04] he said something grab the hold of me
[1:49:07] and i
[1:49:07] said blessed the lord god give it and
[1:49:10] the lord taketh the way
[1:49:11] blessed be the name of the lord he
[1:49:13] didn't say that of himself that was
[1:49:16] because
[1:49:17] he had dropped his anchor
[1:49:23] and that anchor had been coiled like
[1:49:26] it's coiled in a boat
[1:49:28] and you got the chain that wraps all up
[1:49:30] and wraps
[1:49:31] and makes that round there on the bottom
[1:49:33] as it begins to drop to the bottom of
[1:49:35] the ocean
[1:49:36] it begins to uncoil itself and uncoil
[1:49:39] itself
[1:49:40] and no doubt when the devil was coming
[1:49:42] to the prophet of god
[1:49:44] look at you look at what you've done and
[1:49:46] brother branham says
[1:49:47] everything he said was true
[1:49:52] you know sometimes what the devil says
[1:49:54] to you has some validity to it
[1:49:56] and he says everything that you that he
[1:49:58] said was true and he says
[1:49:59] that that anchor that he held no doubt
[1:50:02] no doubt
[1:50:03] as the devil began to pour it on him
[1:50:05] ever had the devil just pour it on you
[1:50:07] in your mind come on somebody raise your
[1:50:09] hand you ever had the devil just torment
[1:50:11] you and
[1:50:11] it's like when it comes it's just blow
[1:50:13] after blow and man when it rains it
[1:50:15] pours and when he begins to just pour it
[1:50:17] on you
[1:50:17] and pour it on you and look at you
[1:50:19] you've you've given up everything you've
[1:50:21] turned away and everyone
[1:50:22] thinks you know that you're a you're a
[1:50:24] crack you know what's happening that
[1:50:25] anchor was letting itself go
[1:50:28] and everyone's rejected you and and
[1:50:30] everywhere ever no one thinks that
[1:50:31] everyone's thanks you've lost your mind
[1:50:33] brother man says yes that's right yes
[1:50:34] that's right
[1:50:35] yes yes you're right that's exactly the
[1:50:37] truth and he says but in that moment
[1:50:39] when i was about to walk away you know
[1:50:42] what happened that anchor
[1:50:43] reached its length hallelujah
[1:50:46] and that anchor reached its length and
[1:50:48] he said something grabbed a hold of me
[1:50:56] oh hallelujah i want to tell you this
[1:50:59] morning i want to preach this to you
[1:51:00] this morning
[1:51:01] whether you realize it or not my brother
[1:51:03] my sister put your faith in jesus christ
[1:51:06] put your faith in your anchor what
[1:51:08] you've committed
[1:51:09] unto god that faith will hold you
[1:51:12] in your darkest moment in your greatest
[1:51:16] hour of of of of affliction and your
[1:51:19] greatest
[1:51:20] suffering of pain there's an anchor that
[1:51:22] holds
[1:51:26] paul says we have an anchor
[1:51:30] and he says and it's anchored behind the
[1:51:32] veil
[1:51:33] you know what's behind the veil because
[1:51:34] you can't see it god doesn't let you
[1:51:37] you can't see it but here's what you
[1:51:38] know i dropped my anchor
[1:51:40] and i want to say this morning to the
[1:51:42] lord lord i dropped my anchor
[1:51:44] i put my faith in you oh can you say
[1:51:46] that by an uplifted hand say lord
[1:51:48] i'm trusting in you and you only i
[1:51:50] dropped my anchor
[1:51:52] i put my faith in jesus i'm sold out
[1:51:54] i've let go of everything lord
[1:51:56] i i'm trusting in you holy and
[1:51:58] completely
[1:51:59] to hold me to carry me through lord
[1:52:07] in that moment when i
[1:52:12] have my cup of pain and that hour of
[1:52:15] isolation
[1:52:18] in that moment when it doesn't
[1:52:21] when there's no relief
[1:52:27] jesus felt that as we close
[1:52:31] jesus felt that feeling
[1:52:36] of isolation he felt that feeling that
[1:52:39] he was
[1:52:42] alone
[1:52:44] here here he is his entire life
[1:52:49] his entire life and everything was being
[1:52:51] controlled by a
[1:52:53] someone that jesus says i do all that
[1:52:55] which the father has chose me
[1:52:58] and yet in this moment he's so isolated
[1:53:02] that
[1:53:03] he prays and he says my god
[1:53:06] my god why
[1:53:10] has thou forsaken me
[1:53:14] what words why is thou forsaken
[1:53:19] me job said the same thing you became
[1:53:21] cruel why have you let go
[1:53:23] david said i'm forgotten we've preached
[1:53:26] that here before how long will you
[1:53:27] forget me oh lord i'm forgotten as a
[1:53:29] dead man
[1:53:30] out of my mind even david prayed those
[1:53:31] same words
[1:53:33] in psalms 22 my god why has thou
[1:53:36] forsaken why are you so far from me he
[1:53:39] said brother matt is it possible that
[1:53:41] god
[1:53:42] really hides his face from those he
[1:53:45] loves is it possible that he lifts his
[1:53:47] hand
[1:53:48] for a short while just for a moment
[1:53:51] to teach us total dependence and
[1:53:55] total trust
[1:54:00] the bible says in second chronicles it
[1:54:03] says god left him
[1:54:04] to try him that he might know all that
[1:54:08] was in his
[1:54:09] heart he says in isaiah 54 in a little
[1:54:14] wrath
[1:54:15] i hid my face from thee for a moment
[1:54:20] you know where job's confidence rested
[1:54:22] and laid he comes to a place in job 23.
[1:54:25] last scripture we'll have you put up
[1:54:26] brother brother jeremy in job 23
[1:54:30] verse 10. and he comes to a place in his
[1:54:33] life when he says i can't see him i try
[1:54:36] to perceive him
[1:54:38] he goes by and i perceive him not and
[1:54:40] job just stops and job says but
[1:54:43] then what's your assurance job here's my
[1:54:45] assurance but
[1:54:47] he knoweth the way that i take
[1:54:51] when he hath tried me i shall come forth
[1:54:54] as gold you know why this brought
[1:54:57] consolation to job
[1:54:59] because job could say on one hand maybe
[1:55:02] i can't see the lord but here's where i
[1:55:05] have confidence
[1:55:06] he can see me
[1:55:09] and maybe i can't see the lord's hand
[1:55:12] and all of this and maybe i can't
[1:55:14] perceive him
[1:55:15] but here's where i'm going to draw
[1:55:17] strength whether i see
[1:55:19] him or not he sees
[1:55:22] me he knoweth
[1:55:25] the way that i take could you bow your
[1:55:28] heads here
[1:55:29] this morning every head bowed please
[1:55:32] every eye closed
[1:55:50] the more that you feel a desire
[1:55:54] just play something softly if you could
[1:55:56] i want to tell you this morning the more
[1:55:58] that you feel a desire to serve the lord
[1:56:01] and i know there's a burning desire i
[1:56:03] believe i've preached
[1:56:04] preaching to people who could say even
[1:56:06] by an uplifted hand to say lord
[1:56:08] i've got a burning desire that you use
[1:56:10] me i've got to be burned burning desire
[1:56:12] to be more like you
[1:56:14] i've got to burn and desire to to live
[1:56:16] for you to serve you to
[1:56:17] reflect your character and reflect your
[1:56:19] glory let me tell you something friend
[1:56:22] the stronger
[1:56:23] and the more you feel that desire the
[1:56:25] more the
[1:56:26] enemy will be will set himself against
[1:56:29] you
[1:56:31] the more he the more he comes at you the
[1:56:34] harder he comes
[1:56:35] in so much that jesus could say god i i
[1:56:38] take this cup of pain david says oh that
[1:56:40] i had wings like a dove for then i would
[1:56:42] fly away and be at rest
[1:56:44] and maybe you are here today this
[1:56:45] morning and you're in that flood
[1:56:47] right now and you say oh i feel the
[1:56:49] pressure of the enemy
[1:56:51] i feel his his his hiss as brother
[1:56:53] random calls and i feel him
[1:56:55] trying to whisper to me and trying to
[1:56:56] lie to me and i've been susceptible to
[1:56:59] that
[1:56:59] voice of reasoning maybe that's you here
[1:57:01] today
[1:57:03] maybe not this morning but maybe in
[1:57:04] times in your weakest moment
[1:57:07] when the devil begins to tell you and
[1:57:08] you begin to reason
[1:57:12] and you have that moment of weakness
[1:57:16] you know what jesus prayed for peter p
[1:57:18] jesus didn't say oh peter
[1:57:20] the devil's going to come after you and
[1:57:22] he's going to he's going gonna he wants
[1:57:23] the desire to sift you like wheat
[1:57:25] you know you'd think that jesus would
[1:57:27] would say but i'm gonna rebuke him and
[1:57:28] i'm gonna keep him off of you and i'm
[1:57:30] gonna pull him off of you i'm gonna take
[1:57:31] him out of your life i'm gonna
[1:57:33] i'm gonna remove him no jesus says no
[1:57:35] i'm gonna allow it to happen
[1:57:37] but i'm going to pray this for you peter
[1:57:39] i'm going to pray that through it all
[1:57:41] your faith won't fail
[1:57:45] and let me tell you what the holy spirit
[1:57:46] is saying today you're going to go
[1:57:48] through
[1:57:48] torment you're going to go through a cup
[1:57:50] of pain i'm using
[1:57:52] it to bring a character out of your life
[1:57:54] but don't
[1:57:55] fear i've prayed for you that your faith
[1:57:58] won't fail that your faith will stay
[1:58:02] strong let me tell you my brother my
[1:58:04] sister god
[1:58:05] does his best work in you when he is
[1:58:08] changing you and whatever way that comes
[1:58:12] let me just say learn to live and to
[1:58:14] rest in him
[1:58:15] to be sealed with him in heavenly places
[1:58:18] in christ jesus remember
[1:58:20] you are the object of his love and his
[1:58:23] affection
[1:58:24] and as a child of god as a as a daughter
[1:58:27] of the king as a son of god as a son
[1:58:34] and daughter of the king let me just say
[1:58:37] this to you
[1:58:38] he knows best your father knows what you
[1:58:41] need
[1:58:42] he's gently leading your hand
[1:58:45] through it all and as job you could say
[1:58:49] by an uplifted hand
[1:58:50] i know the way that he knows the way
[1:58:53] that i take
[1:58:55] and i know that when he hath tried me
[1:58:58] and when it's
[1:58:58] worked its perfect work in my life i
[1:59:01] shall come
[1:59:02] forth as pure gold
[1:59:08] whether you ever get the other side of
[1:59:09] that story
[1:59:11] in this life just know this
[1:59:15] he knows all about it oh
[1:59:18] hear the words of god's prophet today he
[1:59:21] knows where you're
[1:59:22] at he knows all about it he'll always
[1:59:26] take care of you he'll always carry you
[1:59:29] through it
[1:59:30] yeah it may be painful yet may hurt you
[1:59:32] but he'll always carry you through it
[1:59:34] his grace will be
[1:59:36] sufficient through it
[1:59:40] lord jesus this is what you turned me
[1:59:44] around and placed upon my heart i know
[1:59:46] lord your word is spoken
[1:59:50] in a deep way lord to hearts this
[1:59:53] morning
[1:59:56] may we be still enough
[1:59:59] that's a hard thing to do it's a hard
[2:00:03] thing for us to do
[2:00:05] we run to and fro it's a hard thing
[2:00:07] sometimes just to be
[2:00:09] still just for a moment
[2:00:13] may lord jesus we be still enough just
[2:00:15] for a moment to be able to hear
[2:00:18] that still small voice
[2:00:23] your prophet says oh
[2:00:26] i've been back in the cave long enough
[2:00:29] to know and you have two there's been a
[2:00:30] lot of earthquakes shaking around a lot
[2:00:31] of noise a lot of fusses and stews
[2:00:34] big meetings he says but that's the
[2:00:36] reason what i said this morning
[2:00:38] there's got to come something deeper
[2:00:41] than a healing service there's got to
[2:00:43] come something
[2:00:44] deeper than a gift to speak with tongues
[2:00:47] there's got to be something
[2:00:48] deeper than a rushing mighty wind the
[2:00:51] wind went forth but god wasn't in it
[2:00:53] but let's get that still small
[2:00:56] voice oh i raised my hands here this
[2:00:59] morning
[2:01:00] and i say lord give me to that place in
[2:01:02] my own life move me beyond the emotion
[2:01:05] external emotions
[2:01:07] let me get to that something that puts
[2:01:09] the cream in my life
[2:01:10] that's something that though you speak
[2:01:12] with tongues of men and angels
[2:01:13] and have not you're nothing though you
[2:01:15] can prophesy and speak with tongues and
[2:01:17] show signs and wonders
[2:01:19] and work miracles and do great signs but
[2:01:21] if that still
[2:01:22] little still small voice isn't there
[2:01:24] you're nothing says the scripture
[2:01:26] that's what we're listening for now
[2:01:28] we've had the thunder we've had the fire
[2:01:30] we've had the rushing winds
[2:01:31] and the earthquakes but god send us that
[2:01:34] still
[2:01:35] small voice that's what we
[2:01:38] need i raise hands with many people
[2:01:40] today and i say
[2:01:42] yes lord that's what we need in our life
[2:01:45] that's what we need more than ever
[2:01:46] before is that still
[2:01:48] small voice that voice of leadership
