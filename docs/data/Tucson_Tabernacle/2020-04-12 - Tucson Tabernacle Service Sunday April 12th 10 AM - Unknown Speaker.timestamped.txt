[47:26] that this is coming through okay god
[47:29] bless you amen if you have your Bible
[47:31] let's turn to Jeremiah chapter 17 first
[47:34] we'll go there and then we're gonna go
[47:37] to Psalms chapter 107 amen Jeremiah
[47:44] chapter 17 god bless you we greet you
[47:46] this morning and I want to say
[47:51] a resurrection that this is amen this
[47:54] morning amen and we know what the true
[47:57] meaning of Easter is and it's not just a
[47:59] religious holiday as people make it but
[48:03] it means so much more to the believer
[48:04] amen and and it's sad that we're having
[48:07] to meet here on Easter like this you
[48:09] know not together and you were split up
[48:13] at her homes at different locations and
[48:15] different places amen but you know stir
[48:18] to the Christian because the Sun the S
[48:21] Owen is risen in our hearts and the
[48:23] difference in our life he's the one who
[48:25] changed us amen it makes us what we are
[48:27] today put a hunger and a thirst for His
[48:30] Word
[48:30] amen and so I trust that you have that
[48:32] hunger and that thirst for his word
[48:34] today I trust that you have an
[48:36] expectation in your heart that the Lord
[48:37] is gonna meet your need amen I believe
[48:40] that he is the great Shepherd of the
[48:42] sheep as we spoke about yesterday the
[48:44] Lord is our Shepherd amen I'm certainly
[48:47] grateful for that today amen
[48:49] Psalms chapter 107 and also Jeremiah 17
[48:53] we want to read I'm just gonna read a
[48:55] few scriptures from Jeremiah chapter 17
[48:57] first and then we'll turn over to Psalms
[49:00] chapter 107 amen let me just pull that
[49:02] up on on my screen here to make sure
[49:05] that we have it and then by the Jordan
[49:07] if you could just give me a text just
[49:08] let me know that everything looks and
[49:09] sounds good and we're good to go
[49:11] amen Psalms chapter 107 if you hold that
[49:14] place but Jeremiah chapter 17 let's just
[49:17] begin reading here amen at verse 5 it
[49:24] says here thus saith the Lord cursed be
[49:27] the man that trusteth and man and maketh
[49:30] flesh his arm and whose heart departeth
[49:33] from the Lord for he shall be like the
[49:36] heath in the desert and shall not see
[49:38] one good cometh but shall inhabit the
[49:41] parched places in the wilderness in a
[49:44] salt land and not inhabited blessed is
[49:48] the man that trusteth in the Lord and
[49:52] whose hope the Lord is for he shall be
[49:57] like a tree planted by the waters and
[49:59] that spreadeth out her roots by the
[50:02] river and shall not see when he
[50:05] Cometh but her leave shall be green and
[50:07] shall not be careful in the year of
[50:10] drought
[50:10] neither shall cease from yielding fruit
[50:14] amen what a wonderful scripture what a
[50:16] contrast amen turn to psalms chapter 107
[50:20] for our context here today we're going
[50:22] to this read one scripture here psalms
[50:26] chapter 107 amen psalms chapter 107 let
[50:37] me just find my place here make sure I'm
[50:40] in the right spot I want to begin
[50:42] reading here at verse 23 and we're just
[50:45] going to read something here from the
[50:47] psalmist from David we're gonna read
[50:49] from verse 23 through verse 27 I'm
[50:53] speaking to you today and what the Lord
[50:55] has put upon my heart and it's probably
[50:58] not your typical Easter message what you
[51:01] would call a typical traditional Easter
[51:04] message but as we said we know what we
[51:07] know what as a true believer we know
[51:08] what Easter means amen and the only
[51:10] reason we could even preach today and
[51:12] have any revelation from the word or
[51:14] have a desire in her heart is because of
[51:17] Easter because he's risen he's not in
[51:20] the tomb he's alive forevermore he's the
[51:22] same yesterday today and forever amen
[51:25] but I want to speak to you today on a
[51:27] thought that I've titled reaching wit's
[51:30] end reaching wit sin or a place called
[51:33] wit sin let's look here at verse 23 they
[51:37] that go down to the sea and ships that
[51:41] do business and great waters these see
[51:44] the works of the Lord and His wonders in
[51:46] the deep for he commandeth and raiseth
[51:49] the stormy wind which lifted up the
[51:52] waves thereof they mount up to the
[51:54] heaven they go down again to the depths
[51:57] their soul is melted because of trouble
[52:00] they reel to and fro and stagger like a
[52:04] drunken man and are at their wit's end
[52:09] then they cry unto the Lord in their
[52:12] trouble and he bringeth them out of
[52:15] their distress
[52:17] he maketh the storm a calm so that the
[52:20] waves thereof are still then are they
[52:24] glad because they be quiet so he
[52:27] bringeth them unto their desired Haven
[52:30] amen let's just bow our heads together
[52:33] and just ask the Lord to bless this
[52:35] service today Lord Jesus father were
[52:37] gathered Lord in various places today
[52:40] families Lord no doubt under the sound
[52:42] of my voice streaming in and watching
[52:44] Lord all in different locations lord I
[52:47] just ask first
[52:54] Oh Lord Jesus we believe that when we're
[52:57] praying father were doing more than just
[52:59] uttering words Lord are expressing
[53:02] thoughts Lord but prayer is a weapon
[53:04] father whereby we enter another
[53:06] dimension Lord and so we're using what
[53:10] you've given us today Lord or pray in
[53:12] God and we're surrendering we're asking
[53:14] you Lord to come and speak what you've
[53:16] placed upon my heart I pray God that
[53:18] you'd make it real Lord to every
[53:20] individual
[53:21] Lord bless those that are gathering
[53:23] tetherin in the home Lord may be in the
[53:25] vehicle may be wherever they're at in
[53:27] remote locations we pray God that you
[53:30] would just come and may your presence
[53:31] around us Lord God we ask may you
[53:34] saturate father every room every house
[53:37] Lord as we look to you Lord as we look
[53:39] to your word we're thankful father that
[53:42] today we could say here on Easter Sunday
[53:44] that you are risen from the dead
[53:46] you are resurrected Lord father and we
[53:49] believe that you're moving today in your
[53:51] bride we believe that you desire to move
[53:53] upon our hearts now God may you just
[53:56] move upon us Lord each and every single
[53:57] one in Jesus Christ name Amen amen amen
[54:03] I just want to continue here and I
[54:05] wanted this pick this straight up we're
[54:07] going to just go and until we find a
[54:09] place to stop but David here is speaking
[54:12] of this man and he says they that go
[54:15] down I want you to Stu look here again
[54:17] in your Bibles
[54:18] he says they that go down to the sea and
[54:21] ships that do business in great waters
[54:24] so we know David very clearly here is
[54:27] speaking of sailors speaking of men who
[54:30] do business this is something that they
[54:31] know very well and he says they these
[54:34] see the works of the Lord and His
[54:37] wonders in the deep for he commandeth
[54:39] and raiseth the stormy wind which lifts
[54:42] a fell lifteth up the waves thereof
[54:45] David begins to describe this spot where
[54:48] the Sailor gets to to where he's he he's
[54:52] rowing and he's going to and fro and
[54:55] David said he's like on a ship and many
[54:57] times this is how we feel about life
[54:59] life is like being out in the open
[55:01] waters the expanse of all of our
[55:04] existence and sometimes we seem to float
[55:07] a
[55:08] that life see and and the waters can
[55:11] become calm and and we're just selling
[55:13] and cruising and then suddenly there
[55:15] comes a change and the atmosphere has
[55:17] changed and the weather has changed and
[55:20] the feeling is different than maybe what
[55:22] it was before and now the sailors David
[55:26] begins to describe them and say that
[55:28] they lose all control they lose control
[55:31] of their life they lose control of their
[55:33] boat they lose control of their
[55:35] direction and circumstances has raised
[55:39] up around them to where they can't
[55:41] control the boat they can't control the
[55:44] direction David says that they begin to
[55:47] reel and they begin to go to and fro and
[55:50] he says they stagger like a drunk man
[55:52] what a place that David begins to
[55:54] describe here and he says they literally
[55:57] reach what they call their wit's end and
[56:01] a wit Cyn is a place to where a person
[56:04] comes to to where they they've they've
[56:07] lost all control they've they've
[56:10] exhausted any possibility or perceiving
[56:15] that they could think that there would
[56:18] ever be a way out in short David is
[56:22] describing the place that we can get to
[56:25] to where it's the end of all human
[56:27] ability it's the end of all human
[56:30] resources it's the end of all human
[56:33] intervention and there's no escape
[56:36] there's no help
[56:37] there's no deliverance other than God
[56:41] coming on the scene himself Oh
[56:44] David begins to describe this and he
[56:47] says that this is a place that we get to
[56:50] to where our soul melts he says it's
[56:52] like a place called wit's end and these
[56:55] giant waves carry the ship up and down
[56:59] to the heavens and then drop it below
[57:01] and the Whitecaps are there and you
[57:03] can't see - over the next wave the ship
[57:06] cells are tattered and torn and they're
[57:09] ripped by powerful waves that are
[57:11] crashing to the deck the sailors just
[57:14] struggle just to hold on it looks like
[57:17] it's gonna be all over for them it looks
[57:19] like everything they're in
[57:21] or despair they're completely helpless
[57:23] they're vulnerable to the power of the
[57:26] elements of the sea unable to stop the
[57:29] waves unable to stop the torment unable
[57:33] to save themselves they're powerless to
[57:36] make a difference they've come to a
[57:38] place called wit's in and maybe you're
[57:41] in that spot today maybe somewhere it's
[57:44] your life this is what the Lord put upon
[57:46] my heart to preach to you tear today
[57:53] how you feel during this entire crisis
[57:55] that we feel helpless and and all
[57:58] believers let me just say this all
[57:59] Christians can get to this place no
[58:02] matter how strong spiritually you are no
[58:04] matter how long you've served the Lord
[58:05] you can get to a place to where you feel
[58:08] like you have no resources you can make
[58:11] no difference you've lost or exhausted
[58:14] any possibility of making a difference
[58:18] and just like the sailors aboard that
[58:21] ship
[58:22] you simply it is this you're just living
[58:24] life normally you're you're caring about
[58:27] life you're moving on with your walk
[58:29] with the Lord living day to day and then
[58:31] one day out of nowhere here comes a
[58:33] storm upon your life and waves of
[58:36] trouble begins to strike you and waves
[58:38] of of problems begin to come to you and
[58:41] you're attacked from all sides and
[58:43] life's troubles seldom come at one time
[58:48] usually they're like waves and a storm
[58:52] they come more intense and more intense
[58:55] and more intense and then you begin to
[58:58] feel as that sailor did your soul melts
[59:01] because of the trouble the Hebrew word
[59:03] for melting means to faint with fear
[59:06] means to become overcome with fear but
[59:11] let me give you some very something very
[59:12] important to understand about Psalms
[59:14] chapter 107 this wasn't a storm or waves
[59:18] that Satan had sent but the Bible says
[59:22] he maketh the stormy waves to come he
[59:25] maketh the ripples in the water he
[59:28] causeth the wind to come and to rock the
[59:30] boat this is a God initiated trial this
[59:35] the Bible says in verse 25 he commandeth
[59:38] and raiseth the stormy wind he's the one
[59:41] who brought the sailors to this place
[59:43] he's the one raising the wind he's the
[59:46] one stirring the waves he's the one
[59:48] tossing the ship all of this is his
[59:51] doing and my brother my sister sometimes
[59:53] God sends a trial in our life and we
[59:56] can't make any sense of why it came we
[59:59] can't make any sense of the trouble that
[1:00:01] surrounding us are surrounding us but
[1:00:03] this should be an encouragement to your
[1:00:05] faith today too
[1:00:06] that David said you can get to a place
[1:00:09] of wits in and God is the one who
[1:00:12] brought you to that spot to where the
[1:00:14] only thing you can do as a believer is
[1:00:16] lift up your eyes and look up and say
[1:00:19] Lord as David said I'll look up to the
[1:00:22] hills where does my help come from my
[1:00:25] help cometh from the Lord oh we have all
[1:00:29] the knowledge that all the troubles in
[1:00:31] life can bring are the storms and life
[1:00:33] can bring but sometimes we must
[1:00:35] understand that life's troubles can be
[1:00:38] initiated or ordained by God they're not
[1:00:42] always caused by the devil and I'll
[1:00:44] always come by calls by some tormentor
[1:00:46] or maybe some sin in our life but
[1:00:48] sometimes God raises the storm and
[1:00:52] raises the wind in our life to get us to
[1:00:55] the place that we call whit sin what a
[1:00:59] place and trials can come sometimes more
[1:01:03] steady sometimes our trials can become
[1:01:06] maybe maybe a crisis comes and and comes
[1:01:10] to our life or maybe it's just constant
[1:01:13] daily battles or constant daily maybe
[1:01:15] you've been in a trial to where you feel
[1:01:17] like you can't remember where it all
[1:01:19] started but it's just daily you're
[1:01:21] struggling and daily it's like a
[1:01:23] relentless pressure or a relentless
[1:01:25] pursuit that just begins to where you're
[1:01:28] resistance down my brother my sister
[1:01:30] we've all got them don't think for a
[1:01:33] minute that you're unique in that don't
[1:01:35] think for a moment or let the devil tell
[1:01:36] you that you're the only one who feels
[1:01:38] that constant pressure all of the
[1:01:40] believers are filling that mounting
[1:01:43] spiritual pressure in the a day and age
[1:01:45] that you and I live in today and all of
[1:01:49] us you know the simple answer here's
[1:01:51] what's simple to our minds you say
[1:01:54] brother Matt what do we do when we find
[1:01:55] ourself in this place all of us know
[1:01:58] that we've got to trust in God more all
[1:02:01] of us know that more than ever before we
[1:02:03] should be on our knees crying out to God
[1:02:06] in prayer and in supplication to the
[1:02:09] Lord all of us know that the answer is
[1:02:12] more prayer and more seeking of God and
[1:02:15] more seek in his face but my question
[1:02:17] here today that I'm asking myself is why
[1:02:20] we
[1:02:21] I find myself in the deepest darkest
[1:02:23] places of wits in why do I find that in
[1:02:26] those places in my life I seek the Lord
[1:02:28] less down on my knees why is the
[1:02:32] struggle why the struggle today is why
[1:02:36] do we struggle
[1:02:40] with seeking God in times where it
[1:02:44] becomes it seems so plain that that's
[1:02:47] what we have to do in this time of
[1:02:48] calamity you know what it is we believe
[1:02:50] too much in ourself we trust as day as
[1:02:53] Jeremiah spoke of and said the man who
[1:02:56] trusteth in man
[1:02:57] he's like a he that a wither in the
[1:02:59] dried Durrett desert and in the drought
[1:03:02] you know what it is it's pride and
[1:03:04] coming calamity my friends it's pride
[1:03:06] it's very simply pride whether we
[1:03:09] realized that or not calamity and you
[1:03:12] don't find yourself on your knees with
[1:03:14] your family most it's sad but most of
[1:03:16] the time a believer never finds themself
[1:03:19] on the family altar at the time of
[1:03:21] greatest crisis we find ourselves
[1:03:23] mumbling complaining looking for answers
[1:03:27] grumbling questioning and anxiety and in
[1:03:30] depression this is exactly where the
[1:03:32] sailors got to they had no answer for
[1:03:35] the storm they had no answer for the
[1:03:37] problems in their life oh well I want
[1:03:40] you to turn in and in the video may get
[1:03:42] laggy here but the audio should come
[1:03:44] through but we chose to do it this way
[1:03:46] by the Jordan if you could just place
[1:03:47] that first slide up here here's the
[1:03:50] simple answer that we all must realize
[1:03:52] Jesus says I am the vine you are the
[1:03:57] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:04:02] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:04:05] and here's the simple key for with out
[1:04:09] me you can do nothing for without me a
[1:04:16] simple truth
[1:04:18] an old truth that a long long time truth
[1:04:21] that's been true forever since he said
[1:04:23] it and I've got it in bold there because
[1:04:25] it needs to be stamped into our hearts
[1:04:28] without me you can do nothing without me
[1:04:32] you may toil you may beg you may plead
[1:04:34] but jesus said abide in me says unless
[1:04:37] you abide in me you can do nothing
[1:04:40] o my brother it was this nothingness
[1:04:42] that the entire world began when the
[1:04:45] Bible says the earth was covered without
[1:04:46] form without void there was just a
[1:04:49] nothingness a darkness but then there
[1:04:52] came a voice the
[1:04:53] creators voice begin to speak into that
[1:04:56] void and into that darkness and said let
[1:04:59] there be light and there was light you
[1:05:02] need to go to God and say God speak to
[1:05:05] my deep dark nothingness speak to my
[1:05:08] void of calamity and say let there be
[1:05:11] light Lord notice what brother Branham
[1:05:14] says here he says Satan this isn't the
[1:05:17] message I know Satan could not take them
[1:05:19] he could not drown Noah in the flood
[1:05:21] until the purpose of God had been
[1:05:24] finished he could not burn up the Hebrew
[1:05:27] children until the purpose of God had
[1:05:29] been finished he could not kill Jobe
[1:05:32] with boils and troubles until the
[1:05:35] purpose of God had been finished this is
[1:05:39] the next slide here brother Jordan if
[1:05:41] you don't have it up neither could the
[1:05:42] lions eat Daniel until the purpose hat
[1:05:46] until God's purpose had been finished
[1:05:48] neither could death an old age take
[1:05:51] Abraham until the purpose of God had
[1:05:55] been finished and listen to this and
[1:05:58] neither can it take you or can it take
[1:06:01] me until the purpose of God for our life
[1:06:05] until the purpose or listen to this and
[1:06:09] neither can it take you or and or can it
[1:06:11] take me until the purpose of God of our
[1:06:14] life is finished my brother my sister
[1:06:17] put your faith in that quote this
[1:06:20] morning until God is finished no matter
[1:06:23] what comes your way until God has
[1:06:26] finished with you until he has finished
[1:06:28] and accomplished his eternal purpose in
[1:06:31] your life your troubles listen God is
[1:06:34] the one who sends that storm God is the
[1:06:36] one who sent that wave and let me say it
[1:06:39] to you like the Lord gave it to me until
[1:06:41] God has finished and accomplished the
[1:06:44] purpose of that storm that storm will
[1:06:48] continue to rage because that storm has
[1:06:52] a purpose until God is finished with the
[1:06:56] storm or the wave of that that God sent
[1:07:00] into your life until God's purpose of
[1:07:02] the flood is finished the waters will
[1:07:05] still
[1:07:07] but remember that got a purpose glory to
[1:07:12] God
[1:07:13] oh listen to what Branham says about
[1:07:16] trouble here in the next slides he's the
[1:07:18] slide he says and why does God let
[1:07:19] troubles come God harnesses trouble puts
[1:07:24] bits in its mouth you want to know what
[1:07:26] this coronavirus God says this is what
[1:07:28] God was with trouble God puts bits in
[1:07:31] its mouth
[1:07:32] he harnesses the power of trouble and
[1:07:35] makes it obey Him and those troubles
[1:07:41] us into closer fellowship with God those
[1:07:46] troubles you see what troubles those
[1:07:48] troubles God sent to your life
[1:07:50] intentionally with the purpose why did
[1:07:54] the Bible say think it not strange when
[1:07:57] fiery trials are to try you don't think
[1:07:59] it's strange when you have fiery trials
[1:08:02] notice this story here with David I want
[1:08:05] you to look here in 1st Samuel chapter
[1:08:08] chapter 30 verse 6 I want you to this to
[1:08:11] note we want to just turn a corner here
[1:08:13] turn to 1st Samuel chapter 30 there in
[1:08:15] your homes and I'll give you just a
[1:08:17] moment just to come to that place notice
[1:08:21] this here first samuel chapter 30 verse
[1:08:28] 6 we know this story very well but I
[1:08:32] want you to stew I want to come and pick
[1:08:34] up just a part for this just here for a
[1:08:36] moment notice notice what what first
[1:08:40] samuel chapter 30 verse 6 it says and
[1:08:43] david was greatly distressed for the
[1:08:47] people spoke of stoning him because the
[1:08:50] soul of the people was grieved every man
[1:08:54] for his sons and for his daughters but
[1:08:56] David encouraged himself in the Lord his
[1:09:01] God we know this story very well where
[1:09:05] David goes to Ziklag and we've preached
[1:09:07] on this before we're not preaching on
[1:09:09] that here today but David comes back and
[1:09:11] he's there in Ziklag and he comes back
[1:09:14] from war and all the men with him coming
[1:09:17] to expect a a normal scene gonna crest
[1:09:20] the hill and there's going to be his
[1:09:22] wife and there's going to be the
[1:09:23] children of all the soldiers and the
[1:09:25] families and they're gonna greet them
[1:09:27] all but very differently David comes and
[1:09:30] crests that final Hill and over the hill
[1:09:33] their smoke and ashes and ruin David
[1:09:36] couldn't understand this the men
[1:09:38] couldn't understand this they
[1:09:39] immediately perplexity and distress
[1:09:42] their their hearts are troubled you
[1:09:45] could imagine the distress that comes
[1:09:47] over David's life as he's expecting to
[1:09:50] see his family and now they crest that
[1:09:53] hill and there's :
[1:09:54] and there's ruin and there's ashes and
[1:09:57] there's chaos and the Bible says the men
[1:10:00] as they all hit the ground and they
[1:10:03] begin to weep and they begin to cry and
[1:10:05] they begin to cry out and they begin to
[1:10:07] to get to that place of whit's in the
[1:10:10] Bible says David hears the whispers of
[1:10:12] those men as they the Bible says David
[1:10:14] was greatly distressed for the people
[1:10:17] spoke of stoning him my brother my
[1:10:22] sister this wasn't just an assault on
[1:10:24] David you've got to realize that the
[1:10:27] battle that you're in is not a battle of
[1:10:29] flesh and blood it's a spiritual battle
[1:10:31] it's a spiritual warfare and this wasn't
[1:10:34] just an attack against David or David's
[1:10:37] wife or David's men this was an attack
[1:10:40] against the purpose the eternal purpose
[1:10:44] of God it was an all-out assault because
[1:10:47] Satan knew the seed or the purpose of
[1:10:50] God would come through David this was an
[1:10:53] all-out assault against the purposes of
[1:10:56] God in David's life once again the devil
[1:11:00] was after God's seed because it was
[1:11:03] through that seed line we know that
[1:11:05] prophesied that the Messiah would come
[1:11:07] through David and through David's
[1:11:10] descendants and now Satan and taken away
[1:11:12] every woman and every child through whom
[1:11:16] that seed might come you see what the
[1:11:18] devil was trying to do his purpose is in
[1:11:20] your life are much greater than you
[1:11:22] they're much larger than you he's trying
[1:11:24] to prevent you from coming to your
[1:11:26] position as a son or daughter of God
[1:11:28] because he knows when the bride
[1:11:30] recognizes who she is and what she
[1:11:33] stands for that she'll do the greater
[1:11:36] works that she recognizes she's an
[1:11:39] invincible army and brother branham says
[1:11:41] and she then Satan will be as defeated
[1:11:43] in her life as he was when Satan was in
[1:11:47] the wilderness and Jesus withstood as
[1:11:49] every effort the purposes of Satan are
[1:11:52] much larger the attacks Satan has in
[1:11:55] your life you've got to look bigger than
[1:11:57] the picture of your own trouble it's
[1:11:59] much bigger than you it's much bigger
[1:12:02] than me
[1:12:02] once again Satan was after brother
[1:12:06] branham said he followed that seed line
[1:12:08] you remember when brother vitamin in the
[1:12:10] entombment begins to dramatize and he
[1:12:12] sand Jesus is at the door and he says I
[1:12:14] thought I had you when I killed a boy I
[1:12:16] thought I had you when I killed Seth I
[1:12:18] thought I had you when I killed David
[1:12:20] thought I had you when I killed Moses
[1:12:21] ball but I've got you now brother
[1:12:23] Brennan said he was always after that
[1:12:25] seed line and so he was a soul team
[1:12:27] David but ultimately he was after the
[1:12:30] purposes of God that would be fulfilled
[1:12:33] through David's life I hope that's clear
[1:12:35] I believe that it is Oh
[1:12:42] his life David comes to a place and
[1:12:45] David's and and then the scripture goes
[1:12:48] on and the men begin to cry and the
[1:12:50] bigoted men men begin to cry out and and
[1:12:53] the Bible says that David encourages
[1:12:56] himself he couldn't find encouragement
[1:12:58] from anybody else because there's an
[1:13:00] atmosphere of weeping there's an
[1:13:01] atmosphere of distress and calamity but
[1:13:04] the Bible says David looked within
[1:13:06] himself and God said David I want you to
[1:13:09] not look to all those things around your
[1:13:11] strength to find your joy but I've put
[1:13:13] something inside of you David
[1:13:15] I want you to look at you I want you to
[1:13:17] look deep down into your soul and the
[1:13:19] scripture says David in the midst of all
[1:13:22] that calamity and the midst of all that
[1:13:24] atmosphere of fear and anxiety and worry
[1:13:27] David encouraged himself in the Lord and
[1:13:31] the Bible says that David says grab me
[1:13:33] an ephod he takes a bath are the priests
[1:13:36] and he says ask should we pursue
[1:13:39] after this troop who's David didn't even
[1:13:41] know at this point if his wife was still
[1:13:43] alive he didn't know at this point if
[1:13:45] the children are still alive didn't know
[1:13:47] if his daughters were still alive didn't
[1:13:48] know if the men's wives and families are
[1:13:50] still alive but David encouraged himself
[1:13:52] within the within his own self II just
[1:13:55] encouraged himself within in the Lord
[1:13:58] and the Bible says that David says grab
[1:14:00] an ephod and ask shall we pursue shall
[1:14:03] we pursue after them and the scripture
[1:14:06] says that the ephod comes back and and
[1:14:08] he says thou shalt pursue for thou shalt
[1:14:11] notice what the scripture says for thou
[1:14:13] shalt recover all a ll in other words
[1:14:20] everything you lost in this attack
[1:14:25] everything that you lost everything that
[1:14:29] Satan took away from you 100% of it
[1:14:33] David you're gonna get back everything
[1:14:35] that you lost I want you to notice this
[1:14:41] here I'll pick it up here in first third
[1:14:42] is of Samuel chapter 30 and I'm just
[1:14:45] going to turn to it here my Bible just
[1:14:47] to make sure that we have it
[1:14:49] I wanted this pick up this place here
[1:14:51] notice what happens what happens here in
[1:14:54] 1st Samuel chapter 30
[1:15:00] notice this here First Samuel chapter 30
[1:15:05] and let's read from verse 7 just a ludus
[1:15:08] after the verse we just now read and it
[1:15:10] says in David said to ABBA though the
[1:15:12] priests of limit like song I pray thee
[1:15:13] bring me and Eve taught in the abbath
[1:15:15] are brought forth the ephod to david and
[1:15:17] he says in David inquired of the Lord
[1:15:19] saying she'll appreciate for this troop
[1:15:21] chela overtake them when he answered him
[1:15:23] pursue for thou shalt surely overtake
[1:15:26] them and without fail thou shalt recover
[1:15:32] all do you understand what's happening
[1:15:35] here God is saying David everything
[1:15:38] you've lost you're gonna get back a
[1:15:39] hundred percent of everything the Bible
[1:15:42] says in verse 9 so he went he and 600
[1:15:45] men that were with him and came to the
[1:15:46] brook basore where those that were that
[1:15:49] were left behind Stephen David pursued
[1:15:52] he and 400 men verse 10 for 200 abode
[1:15:56] behind which were so faint they could
[1:15:57] not go over the brook Mysore I want you
[1:16:00] to pick this up all the way down follow
[1:16:02] it all the way down to verse 17 and
[1:16:05] David smote them from the Twilight even
[1:16:09] unto the evening of the next day and
[1:16:11] there escaped not a man safe 400 young
[1:16:15] men which wrote upon the camels and fled
[1:16:17] the Bible says in verse 19 and there was
[1:16:21] nothing lacking to them notice there was
[1:16:25] nothing lacking to them and he puts
[1:16:28] emphasis neither small nor great nothing
[1:16:31] there was nothing lacking my brother my
[1:16:33] sister when God restores what the devil
[1:16:36] has taken from you from the assault and
[1:16:38] the attack on your life when God
[1:16:40] restores it to you he doesn't leave
[1:16:43] anything out not just people not just
[1:16:47] things not just items but God puts
[1:16:50] everything back in order that became out
[1:16:52] of order in the storm glory he says he
[1:16:56] says in verse 19 there was nothing
[1:16:58] lacking neither small nor great and
[1:17:00] neither sons nor daughters notice
[1:17:02] neither spoil nor anything that they had
[1:17:05] taken to film David recovered all
[1:17:10] now follow this further and David took
[1:17:13] all the flocks and herds which they
[1:17:15] drove before those other cattle and said
[1:17:17] this is David's spoil David came to the
[1:17:21] two hundred men which were so faint that
[1:17:23] they could not follow David notice what
[1:17:25] he says here that he did the Bible says
[1:17:27] in verse 23 and let me let me find it
[1:17:31] here in verse and verse 25 he says and
[1:17:36] it was so from that day forward that he
[1:17:38] made it a staff
[1:17:43] Israel unto this day and when David came
[1:17:46] to sick like he sent unto out of the
[1:17:48] snow dismiss he sent of the spoil unto
[1:17:52] the elders of Judah even to his friends
[1:17:55] saying behold a present for you out of
[1:17:58] the spoil of the enemies of the Lord to
[1:18:01] them which were at Bethel to them which
[1:18:03] were at south ramoth to them which were
[1:18:05] to tear and to them which were an heir
[1:18:07] notice what he's doing the Bible says
[1:18:09] that David sins ought is it god says
[1:18:12] David you notice David didn't just
[1:18:15] recover his wife David didn't just
[1:18:17] recover everything that he lost but God
[1:18:20] says further than what you lost David
[1:18:22] you're gonna take from the enemy what
[1:18:25] the enemy's possessions were you're
[1:18:28] gonna take all of his gold all of a
[1:18:30] silver all of us these are what's going
[1:18:32] to be called spoils of battle you know
[1:18:36] what spoils our spoils is increased
[1:18:40] spoils is plunder you follow what I'm
[1:18:45] saying here we did this to Iraq when we
[1:18:47] destroyed Iraq we didn't just go over
[1:18:49] there and destroy Iraq but we took their
[1:18:51] oil we took their gold we do this this
[1:18:53] has been throughout history any time we
[1:18:55] conquer a nation we don't just get
[1:18:58] victory we don't just overcome them but
[1:19:02] we become more than an overcomer when we
[1:19:07] DIF when when's David goes to take back
[1:19:09] his wife and his children God says David
[1:19:12] I'm not just going to restore your wife
[1:19:15] I'm not just going to restore your
[1:19:17] children I'm not just gonna give you
[1:19:19] everything that you lost but I'm going
[1:19:22] to give you what you lost and on top of
[1:19:24] that I'm gonna use this trial against
[1:19:28] the devil and I'm going to increase you
[1:19:31] so that when you come out of this trial
[1:19:33] you're gonna be greater than when you
[1:19:35] win in it you're gonna be richer than
[1:19:38] when you win in it my brother my sister
[1:19:40] the purpose of the trial is not to make
[1:19:42] you angry it's not to make you bitter
[1:19:45] God doesn't send you through a storm so
[1:19:47] that you come out with depression so
[1:19:49] that you come up with an anxiety if
[1:19:51] that's the but that's what you got out
[1:19:52] of it you failed the test but God says
[1:19:54] when you
[1:19:55] out of this storm David you're not just
[1:19:58] going to recover all I'm gonna give you
[1:20:00] more abundantly than you could think ask
[1:20:03] or hope or ever even imagined
[1:20:07] God says Satan intended this trial for
[1:20:10] harm but I'm gonna turn it around on the
[1:20:13] devil and make it for your good I'm not
[1:20:16] just gonna give you your children back
[1:20:17] I'm not just gonna give you your wife
[1:20:20] back I'm gonna make you stronger than
[1:20:22] before you lost I hope that comes
[1:20:26] through really clear into your minds God
[1:20:29] says I'm gonna use it and I'm gonna call
[1:20:32] it spoils of war I'm gonna use it to
[1:20:35] mock the devil because the very thing
[1:20:38] that he intended to destroy you I'm
[1:20:40] gonna use it to increase you I'm gonna
[1:20:44] make you stronger you understand the
[1:20:46] prayer do you now understand the reason

[1:20:53] storm that's in your life the the storm
[1:20:56] has a purpose the trial has a purpose
[1:20:59] the Bible says that those who put their
[1:21:01] trust in the Lord were promised victory
[1:21:03] over the power of the enemy and God says
[1:21:07] I want you to know you're gonna come
[1:21:09] through that trial victorious but I'm
[1:21:11] not just gonna make you an overcomer I'm
[1:21:13] gonna make you more than an overcomer
[1:21:16] I'm working out an even greater purpose
[1:21:20] in you for my kingdom you're gonna come
[1:21:23] out of that battle with more spoils than

[1:21:42] to God God says I'm gonna take you I'm
[1:21:45] gonna put you we've all prayed we've
[1:21:47] noticed notice to say let me let me just
[1:21:49] before I get to get ahead of myself
[1:21:51] notice what first turn to first Quranic
[1:21:53] Liz chapter 26 I think I have this on
[1:21:56] the slide but the door to the next slide
[1:21:58] should be this scripture here notice
[1:22:00] what it says in first chronicles chapter
[1:22:02] 26 this is a beautiful principle here in
[1:22:05] verse first chronicles chapter 26 verse
[1:22:07] 27 notice what it says
[1:22:09] here it says out of the Spoils won in
[1:22:13] battles did they dedicate to maintain
[1:22:17] the house of the Lord
[1:22:19] read it again out of the Spoils won in
[1:22:23] battles did they dedicate to maintain
[1:22:27] the house of the Lord as we just spoke
[1:22:29] spoils our plunder loot their goods
[1:22:34] taken in battle by the victors the Bible
[1:22:38] first mentioned this spoils in Genesis
[1:22:40] chapter 14 you might
[1:22:43] you may know the story very well let me
[1:22:45] just rehearse it to you today it's the
[1:22:47] Battle of the kings of Sodom and the
[1:22:50] scripture says that all the kings of
[1:22:52] Sodom attack Abraham the kings of Sodom
[1:22:55] and Gomorrah in Genesis chapter 14 they
[1:22:57] attack Abraham and these invaders come
[1:23:00] in and the Bible says that they capture
[1:23:03] the inhabitants and they plundered all
[1:23:05] of their possessions it's in Genesis
[1:23:07] chapter 14 verse 11 and it says they
[1:23:09] took all the good I'm in Gomorrah
[1:23:12] but when they attack Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:23:14] these invaders attack Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:23:16] the Bible says that they take lot
[1:23:19] Abraham's brother captive so so these in
[1:23:24] Ventus army comes to attack sodom and
[1:23:26] gomorrah and it did destroys it it
[1:23:28] doesn't just eight takes its loot it
[1:23:30] takes it spoil and the Bible says they
[1:23:32] took and they took lot Abraham's
[1:23:34] brother's son that's in Genesis chapter
[1:23:36] 14 so here's what happened Abraham
[1:23:39] learns of this he finds out the nephew
[1:23:42] his nephew lot has been taken prisoner
[1:23:44] and the Bible says he gathers an army of
[1:23:48] 318 men of servants and they pursue
[1:23:52] after these kings notice this and the
[1:23:56] scripture says in verse 15 that they
[1:23:59] overtook these invaders and they smote
[1:24:02] them notice here's a here's a 318 man
[1:24:05] army now this is an Abraham doesn't have
[1:24:08] soldiers he does I have trained warriors
[1:24:10] it doesn't have tanks it doesn't have
[1:24:12] guns
[1:24:13] these are farmers but the Bible says
[1:24:16] that Abraham says I'm gonna go and I'm
[1:24:18] gonna take back what the devil has taken
[1:24:21] from me he took a lot and I'm gonna go
[1:24:23] capture him back
[1:24:25] why because I'm a seat of I'm a seed of
[1:24:27] God in them and the and Jehovah said my
[1:24:29] seed shall possess the gates of his
[1:24:32] enemy after trial and the Bible says
[1:24:35] that Abraham goes and takes back lot his
[1:24:38] brother's son
[1:24:38] and he get gathers this third and 18min
[1:24:41] arm and they pursued him and the Bible
[1:24:42] says that they overtook them and the
[1:24:44] descriptor says it this way he smote
[1:24:47] them and he brought back all the goods
[1:24:49] and also brought again his brother lot
[1:24:53] and his
[1:24:54] and the women also and the people notice
[1:24:58] what Abraham brings back Abraham comes
[1:25:01] back not just with lot but he takes
[1:25:04] spoils when in battle he takes spoils
[1:25:08] from the invaders he takes their gold he
[1:25:10] takes their silver he takes their wagons
[1:25:13] he takes their perfumes he takes their
[1:25:15] furniture Abraham doesn't just get lot
[1:25:18] Abraham gets back all of the possessions
[1:25:21] of those that captured lot notice here
[1:25:26] comes victorious Abraham my brother my
[1:25:28] sister notice what the Bible says here
[1:25:30] remember what the scripture says the
[1:25:33] Bible says the Bible says out of the
[1:25:35] Spoils when in battle did they use to
[1:25:38] dedicate to maintain the house of the
[1:25:40] Lord what is it it's supply through
[1:25:43] battle this is me here's Abraham leading
[1:25:46] this long procession of joyful people
[1:25:49] and here he's coming back with and with
[1:25:51] lot with all of his Goods with
[1:25:53] everything that he lost but on top of
[1:25:55] that Abraham has wagons full loaded down
[1:26:00] with silver loaded down with gold loaded
[1:26:03] down with goods of all kinds and the
[1:26:06] scripture says where did Abraham get
[1:26:08] that he got that from the spoils won in
[1:26:11] battle notice what God is saying God is
[1:26:15] saying your trials don't come to you
[1:26:18] just so you can survive them but your
[1:26:21] God is saying I'm wanting to send those
[1:26:23] trials not so that you can survive them
[1:26:26] but so that I can increase you through
[1:26:30] them you say I'm under pressure I'm in
[1:26:34] this trial there's so much calamity in
[1:26:36] my life how many of us have prayed to be
[1:26:38] more like God I raise your hand how many
[1:26:41] of for how many of you have prayed and
[1:26:42] said lord give me increased my patience
[1:26:44] Lord increase my love I want to be more
[1:26:46] like Jesus I want to die more out to
[1:26:48] myself how many have prayed and said God
[1:26:50] give me more character increased my
[1:26:52] prayer life increase my joy increase my
[1:26:55] sincerity and treats my consecration God

[1:26:59] you've asked for those things now here's
[1:27:01] how I'm gonna give it to you I'm gonna
[1:27:03] supply that need through battle because
[1:27:06] you're gonna go through a trial you're
[1:27:07] going to go
[1:27:08] through a test and when you come out on
[1:27:09] the other side I'm going to grant your
[1:27:11] request because brother branham said
[1:27:13] character is not a gift character is a
[1:27:16] victory and the only way you get a
[1:27:19] victory it's through a battle and
[1:27:21] through a struggle I want more godliness
[1:27:23] God says I'm gonna supply that godliness
[1:27:25] through battle
[1:27:26] give me more zeal give me more courage
[1:27:28] give me more faith God says okay I'm
[1:27:31] gonna supply your request your request
[1:27:33] through battle through spoils because I
[1:27:37] want you to be not just an overcomer but
[1:27:39] more than an overcomer
[1:27:44] notice what happens with Abraham guess
[1:27:47] what happens Abraham
[1:27:49] the Bible says along the way Abraham
[1:27:51] meets Melchizedek who was the king of
[1:27:53] Salem Jerusalem he was the King of peace
[1:27:56] and the scripture sells us that Abraham
[1:27:59] tithes pays ties to this king where do
[1:28:03] you think he pays that ties Hebrews
[1:28:05] chapter 7 verse 4 consider how great
[1:28:08] this man was unto whom even the even the
[1:28:11] patriarch Abraham gave the tenth owl's
[1:28:14] notice this God's chosen chooses Abraham
[1:28:19] who just need to read and now he's going
[1:28:21] to give a portion of that victory of
[1:28:23] those spoils to the king to who the king
[1:28:27] of Salem to the to the to the Lord
[1:28:29] Abraham's going to pay tithe notice what
[1:28:32] God says here he's gonna take what the
[1:28:35] devil intended for harm and Abraham's
[1:28:38] gonna not just receive lot back but he's
[1:28:41] gonna receive plunder and he's gonna pay
[1:28:43] God play he's gonna play God ties
[1:28:45] through the increase of what God gave
[1:28:48] him what is he doing brother Matt you
[1:28:50] said brother Matt what's he doing he's
[1:28:52] turning the tables around on Satan and
[1:28:54] he always does that and you're in my
[1:28:55] life what an amazing principle God gives
[1:28:59] us God says I'm interested much more
[1:29:04] than making you a victor and making you
[1:29:07] an overcomer I want to give you spoils
[1:29:10] and Goods I want to give you spiritual
[1:29:13] riches and spiritual character from your
[1:29:16] warfare you're going to emerge from your
[1:29:19] trial with loads of wisdom loads of
[1:29:23] character loads of love loads of joy
[1:29:27] loads of spiritual resources Romans 8
[1:29:31] chapters of Romans chapter 8 verse 37
[1:29:33] Paul says we are more than conquerors
[1:29:36] through him that loved us that loves us
[1:29:41] God says I want you to emerge out of
[1:29:44] that trial not bitter not upset not
[1:29:48] struggling but I want you to emerge out
[1:29:51] of that deep dark storm with wagonloads
[1:29:54] of patience of love of zeal
[1:29:58] of joy this is how God says I'm going
[1:30:01] David set up this principle notice this
[1:30:04] the Bible says these the principle was
[1:30:07] theirs that David said what we need to
[1:30:10] maintain the temple of the Lord we need
[1:30:12] we need weight and it's gonna need new
[1:30:14] shingles you build anything you notice
[1:30:16] you build any house you you you you you
[1:30:18] you you might manicure your yard you
[1:30:21] might plant it you might plant flowers
[1:30:23] and different things but you know what
[1:30:24] happens if you don't maintenance that
[1:30:26] the weeds will over grow the house will
[1:30:29] become dilapidated the shingles will
[1:30:31] fall off the the the paint will begin to
[1:30:33] chip why because deterioration and decay
[1:30:36] but david says for the temple of the
[1:30:39] Lord
[1:30:39] we're gonna go to battle in order to
[1:30:41] maintain the temple of the Lord I hope
[1:30:43] you catch the principle here in order to
[1:30:45] maintain the temple of the Lord don't
[1:30:48] you know that you're the temple of the
[1:30:49] holy spirit in order to maintain it I'm
[1:30:52] gonna send you through trials I'm gonna
[1:30:55] send you through battles David says
[1:30:57] we're gonna go to battle we're gonna go
[1:30:59] to war and out of the spoils won and war
[1:31:01] we're gonna maintain the temple of the
[1:31:03] Lord the house of the Lord will be
[1:31:04] maintained the supply for needs will be
[1:31:08] met out of battle so he appoints David
[1:31:13] appoints Solomon he had just appointed
[1:31:15] Solomon his son to follow him onto the
[1:31:19] throne of Israel and now he gathers the
[1:31:23] nation's leaders together and he sets up
[1:31:25] a divine order for sustaining God's
[1:31:28] house what resources are they gonna use
[1:31:31] to keep the paint to keep the shingles
[1:31:33] to keep the temple maintained what
[1:31:37] resources the Bible says out of the
[1:31:40] spoils won in battle did they dedicate
[1:31:44] to maintain the house of the Lord oh my
[1:31:49] brother my sister I hope you're catching
[1:31:50] the spiritual principle here today David
[1:31:52] is going to set up a Treasury a special
[1:31:55] account to maintain the temple of the
[1:31:58] Lord didn't think about this it's just
[1:32:02] imagine this here for a moment after
[1:32:04] every single military campaign after
[1:32:07] every military battle David takes back
[1:32:10] spoils and he
[1:32:12] and any stockpiles those spoils from the
[1:32:15] enemy
[1:32:16] these are spoils these are golden and
[1:32:18] and and and these are these are
[1:32:20] treasures that he stockpiles from the
[1:32:23] enemy from battle gold silver brass
[1:32:26] money to up Dinny any and any and he
[1:32:29] makes a he stopped Powell's all of these
[1:32:31] Goods and he had one purpose in mind one
[1:32:35] purpose one reason to use those spoils
[1:32:38] as resources for building
[1:32:43] you
[1:32:46] of the Holy Spirit why did the Bible say
[1:32:49] think it not strange when fiery trials
[1:32:52] are to come because your trial is much
[1:32:55] more precious than that of gold it
[1:32:57] maintains your spiritual well-being
[1:33:01] David appoints temple offices to priests
[1:33:05] he appoints porters he points musicians
[1:33:08] he imports stonemasons craft the
[1:33:11] craftsmen skilled builders skilled
[1:33:13] workers for everything needed to him
[1:33:16] sets up a special Treasury exclusively
[1:33:19] for the temples maintenance and once it
[1:33:22] was established notice what the Bible
[1:33:24] says here he directs his captain's to
[1:33:26] bring forth all of the spoils of war to
[1:33:29] supply the Treasury when when the Bible
[1:33:33] speaks of maintaining the temple that
[1:33:35] that original hebrew word means to
[1:33:37] repair the house to strengthen and to
[1:33:40] consolidate that which was built notice
[1:33:46] that you say brother mat what does that
[1:33:48] mean it means those resources that david
[1:33:50] gathered were meant to maintain the
[1:33:53] original splendor of the temple so that
[1:33:56] it didn't lose its splendor so that it
[1:33:59] did it lose its glory they were
[1:34:02] designated for the repair of any decay
[1:34:06] of any rot to keep God's house in
[1:34:09] pristine condition what was God going to
[1:34:13] use to maintain the temple gold from the
[1:34:18] enemy that's why you're in Satan's
[1:34:24] eating my brother my sister I hope it
[1:34:25] don't on you here today that's why
[1:34:28] you're in Satan's even this isn't God's
[1:34:30] Eden this is the height and the Panda
[1:34:32] the maturity this isn't the kingdom of
[1:34:35] God that's what Jesus said if this were
[1:34:37] my kingdom my soldiers would fight for
[1:34:39] me he says but this is not my world that
[1:34:42] the Prince of the power of the air
[1:34:44] controls this Eden this isn't my home
[1:34:46] I'm just passing through but this is why
[1:34:48] you're put in Satan's Eden this is you
[1:34:50] don't have home-field advantage here
[1:34:52] you're on the enemy's territory you're
[1:34:55] on the enemy's turf he controls
[1:34:58] everything around it
[1:35:00] this is why you're in Satan's eat'em
[1:35:02] you're not in the kingdom of God
[1:35:04] not only that you're in a temple this
[1:35:06] body that you're in is not saved the
[1:35:09] body's not redeemed this body falls
[1:35:11] apart this body can get sick this body
[1:35:14] subject to decay this body this temple
[1:35:17] is subject to rot it's subject to decay
[1:35:20] let me go further it's subject to
[1:35:23] mistakes it's subject to failures it's
[1:35:25] subject to faults it's subject to doubt
[1:35:28] it's subject to fear and all of these
[1:35:31] things the devil did the devil knows
[1:35:35] that he can use these temple he can use
[1:35:38] this Eden he can use all of these things
[1:35:41] to harm you to destroy the seat of God
[1:35:44] in your life but God says I'm gonna know
[1:35:47] that I know that there in Satan's Eden
[1:35:50] I'm gonna put my purpose notice the seed
[1:35:53] of God I want you to catch this here
[1:35:54] today because it's so important this
[1:35:56] inside the seed of God is the purpose of
[1:36:00] God he puts all of his plan all of his
[1:36:04] purpose all of his all of his
[1:36:07] inspiration and he bottles it all up in
[1:36:10] the seed and he says all the seed has
[1:36:13] that all the potential and God says I'm
[1:36:16] gonna put you are the seed of God do you
[1:36:19] realize the entire plan and program of
[1:36:21] God rests upon the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:24] the scripture says it this way that they
[1:36:27] without us Hebrews 11 all those Hebrews
[1:36:30] all those heroes of the faith the Bible
[1:36:32] says they died never receiving that
[1:36:34] Kingdom they salt looking for it but
[1:36:37] they never reached it God having left
[1:36:39] something better for us that they
[1:36:40] without us cannot receive their
[1:36:44] perfection it is the perfection of the
[1:36:47] bride that calls the Dead Saints from
[1:36:50] the ground do you know that God has
[1:36:53] banked everything he's put all of his
[1:36:56] purpose in the seed of God you say oh
[1:36:59] boy I can't believe God would do that
[1:37:01] I can't believe God would put all of his
[1:37:03] purpose and he'd bottle it all up in the
[1:37:06] seed of God and then God says that I'm
[1:37:08] gonna place that seed in a fallen world
[1:37:11] I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:37:14] is how much I this is how much this is
[1:37:16] this is what God says here I'm gonna
[1:37:18] take that seat and I'm gonna place it in
[1:37:20] a fallen world in a fallen atmosphere
[1:37:23] where all the demons ten thousands times
[1:37:25] thousands of demons have been loosed
[1:37:28] into the world I'm gonna put Satan as

[1:37:48] that seed coming to its potential and
[1:37:51] I'm gonna Bank everything that it'll
[1:37:53] come to perfection and be an overcomer
[1:37:55] in fact I'm gonna hold the dead Saints
[1:37:58] graves based upon the perfection they
[1:38:01] without us cannot be made perfect you
[1:38:04] say brother Mack God had a lot of
[1:38:05] confidence in me God must have had to
[1:38:07] have a lot of confidence my brother you
[1:38:09] got it all wrong God God didn't do that
[1:38:11] because he had confidence in you God
[1:38:13] doesn't do that because he has
[1:38:14] confidence in me he hasn't put us here
[1:38:16] in Satan's eat him because he has
[1:38:18] confidence in you he has confidence that
[1:38:21] what he placed inside of you is more
[1:38:24] than an overcomer is more than a
[1:38:27] conquerer all the confidence is placed
[1:38:30] in the seed of God that he placed inside
[1:38:32] of you hallelujah
[1:38:34] and God says I'm gonna I'm gonna put so
[1:38:37] much confidence in that seed I'm gonna
[1:38:40] put them in the most wicked age I'm
[1:38:42] gonna put them in the most wicked time
[1:38:44] in the most wicked hour and further I'm
[1:38:47] gonna further than that and Satan says
[1:38:49] really that's what you're gonna do god
[1:38:51] that's exactly what is well you you
[1:38:53] you're confident in that God says I'm
[1:38:54] even more than confident than that not
[1:38:56] all I'm gonna am I going to place that
[1:38:58] seat in Satan Xena I'm going to place
[1:38:59] that seat in a people who has a temple
[1:39:02] whose subject to decay subject to fear
[1:39:05] subject to rot subject to worry subject
[1:39:08] to doubt subject to calamity subject to
[1:39:11] mistakes God placed all of the potential
[1:39:15] inside of you inside of me because he
[1:39:18] has confidence in that seed God says
[1:39:21] I'll put the very seed of Christ in a
[1:39:24] fallen temple and I'll use and you say
[1:39:27] brother Matt how is he gonna bring that
[1:39:29] fallen temple to destruction - two - I'm
[1:39:31] sorry how's it gonna bring that for that
[1:39:33] fallen temple - two to maturity -
[1:39:35] overcoming to victory God says here's
[1:39:38] what I'm gonna do I'm gonna use the very
[1:39:41] attack and schemes of Satan to come
[1:39:43] against that bride to perfect her I'm
[1:39:46] gonna use what the devil intended to
[1:39:48] destroy her and it would be the very
[1:39:50] thing that perfects her I'm going to use
[1:39:56] the very things that Satan meant to
[1:39:59] destroy this temple and I'm gonna use it
[1:40:01] to maintain the temple of the seed of
[1:40:05] God this is how we overcome right in the
[1:40:08] midst of Satan's Eden let me tell you my
[1:40:11] brother my sister this Eden is against
[1:40:14] you the world is a is against you
[1:40:18] the atmosphere is against us you know
[1:40:21] it's like I hate to use a carnal example
[1:40:23] but it's like a ball team that that you
[1:40:25] they play at home and they have
[1:40:27] home-field advantage man when they have
[1:40:29] home-field advantage
[1:40:30] they are the arena's full with people
[1:40:32] who are wearing wearing their t-shirts
[1:40:33] they're wearing their colors the band is
[1:40:36] there playing for them that the fans are
[1:40:39] there to cheer and to raise the volume
[1:40:41] and and the atmosphere they walk out on
[1:40:43] that stage to play that opposing team
[1:40:45] and men they have everybody behind them
[1:40:48] they have they have they have every they
[1:40:50] have they have all the music's behind
[1:40:51] them all the atmospheres behind them all
[1:40:53] the fans are behind them the stage is
[1:40:55] set they have home-field advantage but
[1:40:58] it's very different when that team
[1:41:01] leaves home-field advantage and they
[1:41:02] become the visitor and they travel to
[1:41:04] another city and in that arena it's not
[1:41:07] their colors it's not their flag it's
[1:41:09] not their music it's not their band it's
[1:41:11] not their team it's not their fans it's
[1:41:13] not their colors the music's not for
[1:41:15] them the atmospheres for them
[1:41:17] everybody's yelling against them
[1:41:19] everyone's hoping they're gonna fail the
[1:41:21] entire atmosphere is charged against
[1:41:23] them hoping trying to get them to fail
[1:41:26] their entire intention of that entire
[1:41:28] arena is for them to be losers but to
[1:41:32] let me tell you something my brother and
[1:41:33] my sister and this entire world's
[1:41:35] against you Satan's enemies are against
[1:41:37] you all the world's against you the
[1:41:39] music is against you the armies are
[1:41:41] again the fans are against you the
[1:41:44] atmospheres against you everything is
[1:41:46] against you but let me tell you
[1:41:47] something that's exactly how God set it
[1:41:50] up God did it intentionally this way he
[1:41:53] intentionally put this bride in the
[1:41:55] darker stage in the darkest hour and the
[1:41:57] darkest time in the most cold and
[1:41:59] indifferent age where spiritual death
[1:42:01] was all in the land you know why because
[1:42:04] when that visiting team gets the victory
[1:42:06] when they don't have home court
[1:42:08] advantage let me tell you something my
[1:42:09] brother my sister there is no victory
[1:42:12] a sweeter as when that team who is the
[1:42:15] visitor when everything is against them
[1:42:18] yet they leave champions yet they leave
[1:42:21] victors
[1:42:22] yet they leave over comers yet they
[1:42:24] leave victorious and they live as well
[1:42:27] they leave as winners o my brother my
[1:42:29] sister and you may not have this world
[1:42:31] may be against you and the music may be
[1:42:34] against you and the atmosphere may be
[1:42:36] against you all but if you could tune in
[1:42:38] to another dimension
[1:42:40] their saints that have already went on
[1:42:42] before us there's angels and jet
[1:42:47] they could run your race oh the Bible
[1:42:51] says there's a cloud of many witnesses
[1:42:53] hallelujah and they're encouraging you
[1:42:55] in a spiritual dimension saying don't
[1:42:57] give up don't stop don't lay down don't
[1:43:01] don't slow down now is the time to press
[1:43:03] for our Redemption draweth nigh closer
[1:43:06] than it's ever been before there's
[1:43:10] another dimension cheering for you
[1:43:12] there's another dimension pulling for
[1:43:14] you
[1:43:15] there's another your tune it's the music
[1:43:17] of onward Christian soldiers marching
[1:43:20] unto war oh let me ask you today where
[1:43:23] is God's temple today it's made up of
[1:43:26] people it's made up of you and be
[1:43:28] parkour ting de Paul our bodies are the
[1:43:31] Temple of the Holy Ghost and like Israel
[1:43:34] our Lord maintains this temple their
[1:43:38] spoils gained in battle that's why our
[1:43:41] trials are meant more than just for our
[1:43:45] survival through every battle that you
[1:43:48] go through little large every single one
[1:43:53] of them are for riches are for resources
[1:43:56] wealth he's stockpiling a treasury of
[1:44:01] goods from our warfare and those spoils
[1:44:05] are dedicated to building and
[1:44:08] maintaining his body the church Jesus
[1:44:11] think about this just for a minute here
[1:44:13] years after Solomon a year years after
[1:44:17] Solomon builds the temple years after
[1:44:19] he's gone it was maintained Solomon
[1:44:22] builds that template in its original
[1:44:23] glory it's an original pristine
[1:44:25] condition and you know what it was
[1:44:27] maintaining good order by the spoils
[1:44:30] taken not in Solomon's war but in
[1:44:32] David's war think about this my brother
[1:44:35] my sister Solomon is may able to
[1:44:38] maintain the temple by going into the
[1:44:41] Treasury of spoils that his father won
[1:44:46] years before I hope you catch it God's
[1:44:50] house stays vibrant God's house stage
[1:44:54] stays beautiful stays colorful because
[1:44:57] his people had emerged from every
[1:45:00] conflict not
[1:45:01] victorious but with riches rich in
[1:45:05] resources and and and solomon uses the
[1:45:09] battles won from his father oh my
[1:45:11] brother my sister do we realize that
[1:45:14] we're standing the only reason we can
[1:45:16] have this gospel and we could have this
[1:45:18] message is because others have given
[1:45:20] their life others have lived their life
[1:45:22] others have striven for in their life
[1:45:25] were maintained because of past victory
[1:45:28] it's not just it's not just uh you know
[1:45:30] a new generation it's an old generation
[1:45:32] a new generation a cloud of many
[1:45:34] witnesses that's why God sends trials to
[1:45:38] your life and makes you an overcomer
[1:45:40] your testimony is not for you you may
[1:45:42] think that testimony of how you came out
[1:45:44] of that trial was for you it wasn't for
[1:45:46] you is for the whole body it was for you
[1:45:48] and the rest of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:45:50] so that they could reap the benefits of
[1:45:53] your success and your victory and the
[1:45:55] spoils of war I want you to turn to a
[1:45:59] story here in second chronicles as we
[1:46:02] close second chronicles chapter 24 the
[1:46:05] Jordan just send me a text let me know
[1:46:06] how long I've been I've been going here
[1:46:09] I think I think I know by just looking
[1:46:11] here almost almost an hour now maybe
[1:46:13] close to an hour let me just give me
[1:46:15] just a few more minutes here second
[1:46:17] chronicles chapter 20 and I want you
[1:46:20] just to read here this is a time where
[1:46:23] Jehoshaphat comes to such a place of wit
[1:46:26] sin and the Bible says here in verse 1
[1:46:29] it says it came to this as second
[1:46:30] chronicles chapter 20 it came to pass
[1:46:33] also it came to pass after that the
[1:46:36] children of Moab and the children of a
[1:46:38] man with them other besides the
[1:46:40] ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to
[1:46:42] battle then there came some of them that
[1:46:44] told Jehoshaphat saying there come with
[1:46:45] a great multitude against thee from
[1:46:48] beyond the sea and on the side of Syria
[1:46:50] and behold they be in haze on Tamar
[1:46:53] which is in Getti Jehoshaphat feared
[1:46:56] notice it's not short of fear here's
[1:46:58] this great army that comes against
[1:47:00] Jehoshaphat and the Bible says in
[1:47:02] Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to
[1:47:04] seek the Lord and proclaim to fast
[1:47:07] throughout all Judah and Judah gathered
[1:47:10] themselves together to ask help of the
[1:47:12] Lord even out of all the cities of Judah
[1:47:15] they came to came to seek the Lord and
[1:47:18] Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of
[1:47:21] Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the
[1:47:23] Lord before the new court notice what it
[1:47:26] says here
[1:47:26] Jehoshaphat noticed now I want you to
[1:47:29] catch this Jehoshaphat was a godly king
[1:47:31] it was a godly man he feared the Lord
[1:47:34] but he had made a big mistake by it by
[1:47:37] making an alliance with a hab in the
[1:47:40] chapter before this and and now and he
[1:47:42] takes his own son and he gives us
[1:47:47] to marry the daughter of ADA a a band
[1:47:50] Jezebel and now because of that do mundo
[1:47:53] Jehoshaphat becomes shaken when his his
[1:47:56] his intelligence officer comes to
[1:47:58] Hillman and he comes running in and says
[1:48:00] there's an army gathered against us and
[1:48:01] and there's Kings that have made an
[1:48:03] alliance against us a a great multitude
[1:48:05] coming from beyond the sea and out of
[1:48:08] amram and and and then behold there it
[1:48:10] had there there and there in tomorrow
[1:48:13] which is right on your border so notice
[1:48:15] this just 15 miles away south of
[1:48:18] Jerusalem on the western shore of the
[1:48:21] Dead Sea and now Jehoshaphat realized
[1:48:24] the enemies right at the gate and his
[1:48:27] entire kingdom his entire life we're on
[1:48:29] the brink of being wiped out this King
[1:48:32] would have surely destroyed them
[1:48:33] completely complete extinction my
[1:48:37] brother my sister if there was ever a
[1:48:38] reason to panic Jehoshaphat had an
[1:48:40] excuse to panic it says he feared and he
[1:48:44] set himself to seek the Lord and
[1:48:46] proclaim to fast throughout all Judah
[1:48:49] what should we do in the time of crisis
[1:48:53] we should do exactly what Jehoshaphat
[1:48:57] did our need I don't care how you say
[1:49:00] brother matter I've got a great need
[1:49:02] then it should drive you to great prayer
[1:49:04] I've got a great calamity that it should
[1:49:06] drive you to great sincerity that's what
[1:49:08] it should do to us my brother my sister
[1:49:10] and the Bible says that that the
[1:49:13] Jehoshaphat begins to set himself it
[1:49:16] would have been very human to panic let
[1:49:19] me tell you what it would have been very
[1:49:20] human for Jehoshaphat to do it was not
[1:49:23] very human to call a fast it was not
[1:49:27] very human to start to pray to the Lord
[1:49:29] when he heard the news of the army
[1:49:32] within his borders
[1:49:33] I could have understand if he would have
[1:49:35] said call all my top generals get the
[1:49:38] mug get the army get it ready get it
[1:49:40] ready for war get it we don't have any
[1:49:42] time to waste we've got it we've got to
[1:49:44] act quick we've got to react to this and
[1:49:46] as soon as the troop as soon as the
[1:49:49] troops are ready you know if there was
[1:49:51] ever a time he could have stopped and
[1:49:54] listened to me my brother and my sister
[1:49:56] he could have panicked in that moment he
[1:49:59] could have panicked in that spot
[1:50:01] I tell you what was unnatural for him to
[1:50:05] do was to not panic and to set himself
[1:50:08] to seek in the Lord oh my brother and my
[1:50:12] sister he starts to seek and pray
[1:50:15] that's not automatic it should be but
[1:50:18] it's not Jehoshaphat could have not only
[1:50:21] reacted in panic he could have also got
[1:50:23] upset noticed this now now notice notice
[1:50:26] what happens here the Bible says that
[1:50:31] that that all of this all of his natural
[1:50:35] reaction his natural reaction would have
[1:50:37] been for Jehoshaphat just to trust in
[1:50:40] his army chapter if you read chapter 17
[1:50:43] it tells of how great at the might of
[1:50:46] his forces he was equipped and ready for
[1:50:49] battle it had been easy for Jehoshaphat
[1:50:51] to say you know this is the moment we've
[1:50:53] been waiting for we're prepared for this
[1:50:55] call the army let's go get them but
[1:50:57] Jehoshaphat rather than trust in his
[1:50:59] army rather than trust in his resources
[1:51:02] he's going to publicly admit his lack of
[1:51:06] strength notice what he says here notice
[1:51:09] this I want you to follow along here he
[1:51:12] says here in verse 5 and Jehoshaphat
[1:51:14] stood in the congregation of Judah and
[1:51:15] Jerusalem in the house of the Lord
[1:51:16] before the new Google Court and said O
[1:51:19] Lord God of our fathers are not thou God
[1:51:21] in heaven and rule us not thou over all
[1:51:24] the kingdoms of the heathen and in thy
[1:51:26] hand is there not power and might so
[1:51:28] that none is able to withstand thee art
[1:51:30] thou not our God who did drive out the
[1:51:33] inhabitants move down to verse verse 10
[1:51:35] and now behold the children of a man mo
[1:51:38] of amounts a year whom that would as not
[1:51:41] let his or invade when they came out of
[1:51:42] Egypt verse 11 behold I say how they
[1:51:45] reward us verse 12
[1:51:47] o our God will thou not judge them for
[1:51:50] we have no might notice he's going to
[1:51:52] admit this publicly for we have no might
[1:51:56] against this great company that cometh
[1:51:58] against us neither know we what to do
[1:52:01] but our eyes are upon thee what a
[1:52:07] picture this great King displays here
[1:52:12] Jehoshaphat is going to public
[1:52:14] admit his lack of strength that wasn't
[1:52:17] normal for Kings to do a king was
[1:52:19] royalty they were always to have a
[1:52:22] dignity but but it was it showed such
[1:52:25] character in Jehoshaphat that in the
[1:52:27] time of need he begins to cry out for
[1:52:29] God in the time of crisis he was the
[1:52:32] king of Judah
[1:52:33] you know Kings were proud that's what
[1:52:35] they were they were proud men and and
[1:52:37] that came with the office of a king they
[1:52:40] had an image to maintain
[1:52:41] leaders let me just say this just here
[1:52:43] for a moment
[1:52:44] leaders
[1:52:46] to be time confidence they've got to
[1:52:51] inspire leadership and the people who
[1:52:53] are following them but what you know
[1:52:56] what what kind of leader gets up and
[1:52:58] admits and says I'm helpless you know I
[1:52:59] don't have any strength against this
[1:53:01] army that's not good politics for a
[1:53:03] president to do or a king to do but
[1:53:06] Jehoshaphat admits his fear he calls a
[1:53:09] national prayer meeting and then he
[1:53:11] prays in front of everyone and says Lord
[1:53:14] in front of the entire congregation I
[1:53:16] man I am too weak for this army private
[1:53:21] him better for him politically to go and
[1:53:24] have a little private prayer meeting oh
[1:53:27] but he knew he was in deep trouble and
[1:53:30] so he openly admits the weakness and he
[1:53:33] calls upon the Lord verse 3 the Bible
[1:53:36] says Jehoshaphat turns his attention
[1:53:39] that means to set his face it literally
[1:53:42] means he determines to seek the Lord
[1:53:45] they not only they did they not only
[1:53:47] sought help from the Lord they sought
[1:53:50] the lord himself this was this was this
[1:53:54] was this was nothing new furred for King
[1:53:56] Jehoshaphat the Bible says in in in that
[1:53:59] same books
[1:54:00] second chronicles it says he sought the
[1:54:02] God of his father this Hebrew word seek
[1:54:05] it literally means to to beat a path to
[1:54:08] God
[1:54:09] because you frequent that way often oh I
[1:54:12] hope you catch that
[1:54:13] the Bible says Jehoshaphat puts his face
[1:54:16] he seeks the Lord that means that the
[1:54:18] Hebrew words seek it literally means to
[1:54:21] trample underfoot it's saying that he in
[1:54:24] his life
[1:54:25] he had beat a path to God because he
[1:54:28] frequented that way so often Jehoshaphat
[1:54:31] knew because so often in his life
[1:54:33] he see he sought God my brother my
[1:54:35] sister it ought not to be that we only
[1:54:37] seek God at times of calamity we should
[1:54:40] be seeking God every day of our life
[1:54:42] so that when calamity comes we have a
[1:54:45] trampled path a beaten path a way of
[1:54:48] which we've walked many times before and
[1:54:50] we hit our knees and say God just like I
[1:54:53] called before and times past I'm calling
[1:54:55] and seeking you again Lord oh the Bible
[1:54:59] says that is prayer
[1:55:00] notice notice here he says he says he
[1:55:04] says here let's let's pick it up here
[1:55:06] let me find my place again in second
[1:55:09] chronicles chapter 20 he says in all
[1:55:11] judah stood before the Lord verse 13
[1:55:14] with their little ones their wives and
[1:55:17] their children he brings all of the
[1:55:20] family together what do we pray in the
[1:55:24] time of crisis
[1:55:25] what is our prayer look like Oh God
[1:55:28] deliver me oh I need you you're never as
[1:55:31] a president help time of trouble Oh
[1:55:34] curse the enemy oh oh but my brother my
[1:55:38] sister do we realize we miss something
[1:55:41] so crucial it's it's it's in a crisis
[1:55:45] we're not supposed to we're not supposed
[1:55:47] to in a crisis go and run and suddenly
[1:55:49] go to God and like you know like like a
[1:55:52] genie sometimes that's how people treat
[1:55:54] God suddenly calamity comes and crisis
[1:55:57] comes in Oh oh no oh no where's God
[1:55:58] where's God where's God and they
[1:55:59] decidedly they they're praying were they
[1:56:01] they should have been praying before Oh
[1:56:03] trial should cause us to seek God
[1:56:06] himself because he's exactly what we
[1:56:09] need and let me see let me say this to
[1:56:11] you my brother and my sister if you've
[1:56:13] got Jesus you can go through anything in
[1:56:16] your life if you've got the Lord on your
[1:56:19] side it doesn't matter how deep and dark
[1:56:21] your trial is you can go through
[1:56:23] anything and come out unharmed notice
[1:56:28] what he says here notice let me just
[1:56:31] pick it up just a little bit further
[1:56:33] notice that notice here's what he says
[1:56:36] here he says in verse 14 then upon
[1:56:38] jahaziel the son of Zechariah sorry I
[1:56:39] was trying to find my place here he says
[1:56:41] then upon jzl the son of Zechariah the
[1:56:44] son of Ben and I the son of GL he says
[1:56:46] here it came the Spirit of the Lord in
[1:56:49] the midst of the congregation notice
[1:56:50] what he says and he said in verse 15
[1:56:53] hearken you all Judah you inhabitants of
[1:56:55] Jerusalem and thou King Jehoshaphat thus
[1:56:58] saith the Lord unto you be not afraid

[1:57:54] be dismayed he repeats it for tomorrow
[1:57:56] go out against them for the Lord will be
[1:58:00] with you and Jehoshaphat bowed his head
[1:58:05] with his face to the ground and all
[1:58:08] Judah and all the inhabitants of
[1:58:10] Jerusalem fell before the Lord
[1:58:12] worshiping the Lord the Levites the
[1:58:14] children of Acathla fights in the
[1:58:16] chiller of the core rites stood up to
[1:58:17] praise the Lord God of Israel with a
[1:58:19] loud voice on high bursts Worthen to the
[1:58:21] winners of Toccoa notice what it says
[1:58:23] here I want you to notice what Joseph at
[1:58:26] says before they go to battle it says
[1:58:29] and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood
[1:58:32] and said hear me all Judah and you
[1:58:35] inhabitants of Jerusalem but notice the
[1:58:38] order here believe in the Lord your God
[1:58:42] so shall you be established believe in
[1:58:47] his prophets believe his prophets so
[1:58:50] shall you prosper it wasn't enough just
[1:58:55] to believe in the Lord they believed in
[1:58:57] the Lord but now a prophet had came and
[1:58:59] given on a message and he says in order
[1:59:01] for us to be victorious we've got to not
[1:59:04] just believe in the Lord we've got to
[1:59:06] believe in his prophet so shall you
[1:59:08] prosper and when he had heard this
[1:59:11] notice verse 21 when he had consulted
[1:59:14] with the people he appointed singers
[1:59:15] unto the Lord that they should praise
[1:59:17] them in the beauty of holiness he says
[1:59:19] that they should praise the beauty of
[1:59:21] holiness as they went out before the
[1:59:22] army and to say praise the Lord for His
[1:59:25] mercy endureth forever and then when
[1:59:29] they began to sing in the praise the
[1:59:31] Lord sent an ambush against the children
[1:59:33] of Ammon Moab and Mount Seir which were
[1:59:35] come against Judah and they were smitten
[1:59:39] notice the obedience here they had a
[1:59:42] promise that was given through a prophet
[1:59:45] it was one thing believed in an apple it
[1:59:48] was one thing to believe it it was
[1:59:50] another thing to act on the words these
[1:59:53] singers were worse taken their very
[1:59:56] lives on the truthfulness of a
[1:59:59] vindicated prophet they were staking
[2:00:01] their lives oh that word from the Lord

[2:00:08] they were marching unarmed they had no
[2:00:10] armor they had no arms they had no
[2:00:12] weapons they had no fight they were
[2:00:14] simply singing praises to God against
[2:00:17] him a powerful enemy that could have
[2:00:20] destroyed them oh the Bible says and
[2:00:23] they went out see the Bible says they
[2:00:25] went out here notice this army that's
[2:00:27] coming together to fight them but as

[2:03:44] bowed over the building eyes closed
[2:03:46] musicians just play something softly the
[2:03:49] song leader could come up and just be
[2:03:51] ready their brother Peter noticed this
[2:03:53] here he says put your trust in the Lord
[2:03:57] this is what Jehoshaphat was was
[2:04:00] encouraging them that it have any
[2:04:01] weapons they were too weak to fight
[2:04:03] notice the setting he says they they had
[2:04:06] no weapons they were too weak to fight
[2:04:08] the enemy but Jehoshaphat says believe
[2:04:11] the word they were going on the word of
[2:04:13] a prophet believe in the Lord your God
[2:04:16] and you shall be established put your
[2:04:19] trust in his prophets and you shall
[2:04:22] succeed o my brother and my sister
[2:04:27] tragically many have quit the battle
[2:04:32] tragically through storms and through
[2:04:34] trials many get end up through those
[2:04:37] trials bitter they end up hardened they
[2:04:39] end up anger they end up their faith
[2:04:41] it's just a shipwreck
[2:04:43] why because you haven't realized you
[2:04:46] haven't taken the resources the spoils
[2:04:49] that God was trying to give you through
[2:04:51] that battle you throw your treasure away
[2:04:55] when you walk away from your trial let
[2:04:59] me say that again you are throwing your
[2:05:01] treasure away when you check out
[2:05:04] the trial God has put in your life he
[2:05:07] didn't sin that trial just to make you
[2:05:09] an overcomer he gave you that trial to
[2:05:12] make you more than a conqueror Lord
[2:05:16] Jesus we thank you for your word today
[2:05:19] we thank you Lord that we have a sure
[2:05:21] word of prophecy we thank your Lord that
[2:05:24] today we realize the battle is not ours
[2:05:28] the battle is the Lord's Oh Lord Jesus
[2:05:33] as we read from the very beginning in
[2:05:35] Jeremiah
[2:05:35] Lord let us not be that cursing man Lord
[2:05:40] your word says cursed be the man who
[2:05:44] puts his trust in the arm of flesh Oh
[2:05:46] whose heart depart it from the Lord for
[2:05:49] he shall be like a Heath in the desert
[2:05:52] and shall not see when good cometh but
[2:05:55] shall inhabit that parched places of the
[2:05:57] earth Oh Lord but you said blessed is
[2:06:01] the man let me be that man Lord let me
[2:06:04] be that man let us be that one who puts
[2:06:07] their trust in the Lord oh you said
[2:06:10] whose hope is in the Lord for he shall
[2:06:13] be as a tree planted by the waters that
[2:06:16] spreadeth outer roots by the river and
[2:06:19] shall not see when the heat cometh but
[2:06:21] her leaf shall be green and shall not be
[2:06:24] careful in the year of drought neither
[2:06:26] shall cease from the yielding fruit oh
[2:06:29] my brother my sister this person that
[2:06:32] Jeremiah is referring to this person
[2:06:37] that Jeremiah talks about here they
[2:06:39] don't wait for God to move that they
[2:06:41] they they believe in God listen my
[2:06:44] brother my sister that person that curse
[2:06:46] in person that he's talking about uh
[2:06:49] they make their own plans they turn to
[2:06:53] their own ways they take their own
[2:06:54] shortcuts they're always scheming
[2:06:57] planning manipulating their philosophy
[2:07:00] they live by is it's not what you know
[2:07:02] that counts it's it's who you know that
[2:07:05] person's for ever looking for that
[2:07:07] special person to solve all their
[2:07:09] problems spiritual the Bible says that
[2:07:12] there's a spiritual dryness that sets in
[2:07:15] to that person's life he'd still be like
[2:07:17] a heath
[2:07:18] like a shrub in the desert he looks
[2:07:21] barely alive with no fruit no wellspring
[2:07:23] of life he's always on the brink of
[2:07:26] dying
[2:07:26] he never partakes of the joy of being
[2:07:29] delivered by God's hand and everything
[2:07:32] he looks at he turns into everything he
[2:07:35] he looks at everything that looks good
[2:07:37] it turns into misery for him he's
[2:07:41] existing he's living in parched places
[2:07:43] he keeps withering away but notice what
[2:07:47] Jeremiah
[2:07:49] you
[2:07:51] who trust in the Lord the Bible says
[2:07:53] this man is planted
[2:07:55] he has roots he has stability he has a
[2:07:59] reservoir of living water
[2:08:01] he's always spreading out fruitful and
[2:08:04] green with fresh life older you want to
[2:08:07] be that kind of Christian the Bible says
[2:08:09] he will not be careful that means
[2:08:11] fearful in the time or the year or the
[2:08:14] season of drought when things get hot
[2:08:17] and bothered some when hey when things
[2:08:19] get when things get so out of control
[2:08:23] Ord I trust that the Word of God has
[2:08:27] spoken to your heart and you could say
[2:08:28] Lord in the midst of my wit's end let me
[2:08:31] cry out to the Lord and Lord may I come
[2:08:34] out of this trial not just an overcomer
[2:08:37] but let me come out of this situation
[2:08:39] more than an overcomer let me come out
[2:08:42] of this calamity that is shaking the
[2:08:44] entire world Lord let me come out of
