[43:53] amen you love the Lord this morning
[43:56] just happy to be in the house of God
[44:00] brother Daniel had asked
[44:03] me to do this song a week or two ago
[44:07] and honestly I I don't know if I was in
[44:10] the mood I listened to it a little bit
[44:12] Martha listened to it quite a bit
[44:14] unbeknownst to me printed out the words
[44:17] and practiced it
[44:19] and then this morning I got inspired and
[44:21] turned it on and listened to it but I
[44:23] usually like to practice the song a
[44:25] little bit more and I was kind of
[44:26] praying about it as we were driving to
[44:27] church should we do it this morning or
[44:29] not and we come up Oracle here right to
[44:31] turn on Jacinto and there's a gentleman
[44:34] walking across the uh Street you could
[44:37] say maybe homeless or whatever and he
[44:40] had palm branches in his arms and I
[44:43] thought well Lord do you know the use
[44:46] when you hear the words of this song
[44:48] here you'll you'll know kind of why that
[44:50] that spoke to me there so
[44:52] amen God bless you this is a song that's
[44:56] audience participation
[44:59] I saw the Wayward traveler in tattered
[45:03] garments clap and struggling up the
[45:06] mountain it seemed that he was sad his
[45:10] back was heavy laden his strength was
[45:14] almost gone but he shouted as he
[45:17] journeyed Deliverance will come then
[45:21] pause
[45:22] Victory crowns of Glory Palms of Victory
[45:29] I shall wear the impulse a victory
[45:34] crowds of Glory Palms of Victory I shall
[45:41] wear
[45:43] I saw him in the evening the sun was
[45:47] sinking love it overcome the mountain
[45:51] and reached the veil below he saw the
[45:55] Golden City his Everlasting home and he
[46:00] shout loud Hosanna
[46:02] Deliverance will come then Palms a
[46:06] victory crowns of Glory Palms of Victory
[46:13] I shall wear them Palms a victory crowns
[46:19] a glory Palms of Victory I shall wear

[50:21] I'm going to preach from the Old

[50:26] think it applies to what I'll be talking
[50:28] about thank you sister that's fine
[50:35] James chapter 4 verse 1 reads like this
[50:39] from whence come Wars and fightings
[50:41] among you
[50:43] come they not hence even of your lust
[50:46] the war in your members you lust and you
[50:49] have not you kill
[50:51] and desire to have and cannot obtain
[50:54] you fight a new war yet you have not
[50:57] because you ask not
[50:59] you ask and receive not because you ask
[51:02] amiss
[51:03] that you may consume it upon your lusts

[53:37] bless you all and we appreciate you all
[53:39] coming and worshiping with us and
[53:42] fellowshipping with us
[53:44] ahead of my heart this morning
[53:47] to preach
[53:49] on the ultimate goal of a Christian
[53:53] and that's to have a relationship with
[53:55] God
[53:57] we I think it's overlooked so often but
[54:00] I think it is the most important thing
[54:04] that we can even think about in our
[54:07] lives is to have that personal
[54:09] relationship
[54:11] with our Lord and with our savior
[54:14] and so often I think that
[54:16] that we ask
[54:18] things of God
[54:20] and we forget that this is a two-way
[54:24] relationship
[54:25] that that God is a father and he loves
[54:29] us and he provides for our every needs
[54:32] but we should also show him our love
[54:38] and then when we do that then we see the
[54:43] Lord begin to operate in our midst
[54:46] brother Lionel Salazar shared a
[54:48] testimony with me last week that
[54:50] something that just about something that
[54:52] just happened last Sunday blessed me so
[54:55] much I thought brother Lionel you gotta
[54:57] tell the whole church are you willing
[55:01] all right come on up my brother
[55:03] I'll tell you what it blessed me and I
[55:06] think it'll probably bless you as much
[55:07] as it blessed me
[55:09] to hear what happened
[55:11] how the Lord used our brother
[55:15] when he put God first
[55:26] my brother it's good to see you
[55:29] bless you my friend
[55:33] greetings to you all on this blessed
[55:35] Sunday given to us by the Lord Jesus
[55:37] Christ it's a blessing to be here
[55:39] I'd like to thank the pastor Evans for
[55:42] inviting me to come up and to share this
[55:43] story I hope it blesses you
[55:46] I would like to say a special hello and
[55:47] God bless you to my painting Brothers
[55:50] they were helping us paint the uh the
[55:52] room next door here for the church
[55:54] there's more to do yeah we got more to
[55:56] do yeah these uh
[55:58] these little Peterson kids man this is
[56:00] that little crew man they're a little
[56:02] army man amen
[56:03] it was a blessing to have him with us um
[56:08] my heart's a little heavy right now
[56:09] because uh from the minute that brother
[56:13] Evans asked me if I come up and say this
[56:15] uh testimony man we just went under
[56:18] attack chaos Came Upon Us
[56:20] the family turned out into a a really
[56:23] bad bickering argument over nothing
[56:26] really
[56:27] but uh
[56:28] I asked them we all asked each other for
[56:31] forgiveness and we got past it I'd still
[56:33] like them to ask him for to forgive me
[56:36] for my part in the little argument but I
[56:39] see exactly what's going on the minute
[56:41] God wants you to do something then the
[56:43] devil hears it then he comes and he
[56:45] tries to attack amen and it's them
[56:47] little small things that he tries to use
[56:50] to try to convince you to not do the big
[56:53] things and the big things is these
[56:56] things here right now today this is the
[56:58] big things to tell a story about
[57:00] something that our Lord and Savior Jesus
[57:03] Christ done in our lives and this is a
[57:06] story about
[57:08] a family member of mine this happened
[57:10] last Sunday
[57:12] um
[57:12] started with a dream again many of you
[57:15] all know that it was a dream that
[57:16] brought me here a short while ago to
[57:18] this church and uh we were having church
[57:21] last Sunday who went home the night
[57:23] before I had another dream
[57:25] and my dream showed me a family member
[57:28] it was a brother
[57:29] there was a visitor that came to the
[57:31] house and uh something really bad
[57:33] happened to a to one of my brothers and
[57:37] I was just shooking up
[57:39] really bad and uh I woke up from the
[57:42] dream
[57:43] and
[57:45] it affected me so much that I didn't
[57:47] speak about it for the whole day but I
[57:49] realized what the dream was doing it was
[57:51] trying to prepare me for something else
[57:53] that was going to happen that day
[57:55] um we came to church here in the morning
[57:57] last Sunday
[57:59] and we went home and instead of having a
[58:01] visitor come to the house to give us
[58:03] some news we get a phone call
[58:05] and the phone call was about a brother
[58:06] it wasn't my brother but it was my
[58:09] father-in-law's brother our uncle they
[58:11] had to rush him to the hospital by
[58:13] ambulance
[58:14] and uh he was in the in the emergency
[58:17] room fighting for his life so
[58:19] father-in-law calls us and tells us the
[58:21] news
[58:23] we tell them well we'll meet you there
[58:25] at the hospital
[58:26] we get to the hospital and uh
[58:30] they had already put the family members
[58:32] inside a special little room with it's a
[58:34] very uh urgent situation they'll kind of
[58:36] gather the family members into a little
[58:38] room so they're not all inside the ER
[58:40] so we're inside the little small room
[58:42] and uh
[58:43] uncle's uh boys are in there and they're
[58:46] they're already grown but those are his
[58:47] boys and while we're inside the room
[58:50] you know there's just a heavy feeling in
[58:52] the air there's a lot of
[58:54] there's a lot of uh there's a lot of
[58:57] anger there's a lot of
[58:59] uncertainty
[59:01] you can you can see the black cloud of
[59:04] death that's all around
[59:06] um
[59:08] we're inside the room and all of a
[59:10] sudden the doctors and the nurses they
[59:12] go running they call it code blue or
[59:14] they call her code blue we heard what
[59:15] room it was it was uncle's room
[59:19] um he started what what we know inside
[59:21] the uh
[59:22] the medical profession I was in for a
[59:24] little he started swirling the drain is
[59:25] what they call it's where he started
[59:27] dipping out so when they called The Code
[59:29] Blue I turned to everybody in the room I
[59:31] said look we're gonna have about 20
[59:32] minutes
[59:33] and either they're going to come back in
[59:34] and they're going to say that he made it
[59:36] or they can say he did it because what
[59:38] they're doing is they're they're working
[59:39] him give him CPR and everything okay
[59:42] um his boy started getting sick you know
[59:44] we're all sitting there just watching
[59:47] this you can hear all the commotion
[59:48] going on down the hallway so we're
[59:50] sitting here just listening and watching
[59:52] this whole thing he's getting ready to
[59:54] go out and then
[59:57] um
[59:57] finally the nurse came in after about 20
[1:00:00] minutes and she said look she goes what
[1:00:01] happened was his heart stopped beating
[1:00:03] she said we lost them
[1:00:05] she said but we all worked we got
[1:00:07] together and we were able to bring him
[1:00:08] back but now we're going to send him to
[1:00:10] the ICU
[1:00:12] but we got to figure out why his Hearts
[1:00:14] his heart's continuously going this way
[1:00:17] so she told us if there's anybody here
[1:00:18] that wants to go in and visit with him
[1:00:21] do it now before you get to the ICU
[1:00:23] because of the fact that they have more
[1:00:25] stricter rules in the ICU you can't just
[1:00:27] go in and see there's a one or two could
[1:00:30] only go in at a time
[1:00:32] so I had already made my mind up that I
[1:00:34] wasn't going to go in and see him
[1:00:35] because I wanted to let the other family
[1:00:36] members immediate more immediate family
[1:00:38] members see them
[1:00:40] um so my father-in-law went in one more
[1:00:42] time my wife went in one more time
[1:00:44] and I mean the situation was just
[1:00:47] it was Dire and my father-in-law comes
[1:00:51] back you know there's Tears in their
[1:00:52] eyes and everything of what just
[1:00:54] happened his son had already stepped out
[1:00:56] you know he was getting sick he couldn't
[1:00:58] sit there and listen and watch this
[1:01:00] then when we were sitting there my
[1:01:02] father-in-law looks at me
[1:01:04] and like I said I was already my mind
[1:01:06] was made up I wasn't going to go in into
[1:01:07] the room
[1:01:09] father-in-law looks at me
[1:01:11] and uh
[1:01:12] this to me is amazing because the
[1:01:14] brother Evans was speaking about the
[1:01:15] role of a father on Father's Day
[1:01:18] and he says faith the faith of a father
[1:01:20] the devil will do everything that he can
[1:01:24] to try to destroy the faith of a father
[1:01:26] and to try to get the father out of the
[1:01:28] uh out of the household okay now my
[1:01:31] father-in-law he's the oldest one uh in
[1:01:33] this family of the brothers and sisters
[1:01:35] you know we all look up to him as a
[1:01:37] father
[1:01:38] he's been to this church a couple of
[1:01:39] times I believe
[1:01:42] he looks at me
[1:01:44] and he says line on
[1:01:47] get in there and go pray for my brother
[1:01:49] what
[1:01:51] praise the Lord
[1:01:55] you know that that came as a surprise
[1:01:58] to me because all of a sudden it was
[1:02:00] with all the authority in the world
[1:02:03] he had been in there I'm sure he's
[1:02:04] prayed in his heart my wife Lionel
[1:02:08] go pray for my brother
[1:02:10] I get up immediately and say okay now
[1:02:12] I'm going to go in the room now
[1:02:14] I went into the room
[1:02:16] went up to Uncle and touched them
[1:02:18] introduced myself let him know who I was
[1:02:20] he was he was innovated he was out
[1:02:25] I started proclaiming the name of Jesus
[1:02:27] over him and letting him know that Jesus
[1:02:29] was the Healer and that he was a child
[1:02:31] a child of the king he was part of the
[1:02:34] Kingdom
[1:02:35] and as I as I prayed for him his eyes
[1:02:38] opened and they started twitching they
[1:02:39] started looking back and forth
[1:02:43] and I said the prayer
[1:02:45] we left
[1:02:46] went back to the room
[1:02:49] um my father-in-law then said that that
[1:02:51] they were going to leave because they
[1:02:52] were going to ship Uncle to the ICU
[1:02:55] and and we shook his hand said goodbye
[1:02:57] and me and my wife were going to leave
[1:02:58] but we realized that the uncle that was
[1:03:01] in the hospital had left his phone
[1:03:02] inside the room there so we wanted to
[1:03:04] wait there till his Sanders somebody
[1:03:06] else came in there so we give them the
[1:03:08] phone
[1:03:10] um finally uh one of his sons came in we
[1:03:12] gave him the phone and it was the same
[1:03:14] son that was there witnessing the
[1:03:16] doctors and the nurses running in an
[1:03:19] urgent situation because he was he had
[1:03:21] coded
[1:03:25] right then we heard the most beautiful
[1:03:27] noise you could ever hear
[1:03:30] there was another commotion going on
[1:03:31] down the hallway
[1:03:33] it was the same
[1:03:37] it was the same doctors and nurses and
[1:03:39] medical professionals
[1:03:47] you know they were
[1:03:57] see what that says only believe amen
[1:04:00] only yes amen
[1:04:02] they were running back and forth out of
[1:04:04] his room because he was now fighting to
[1:04:07] try to get out of his bed and walk out
[1:04:08] of the hospital amen
[1:04:17] now it was such an immediate thing man
[1:04:21] you say prayers sometimes and you don't
[1:04:24] realize how all of a sudden it could be
[1:04:26] that immediate yes amen you know and and
[1:04:28] we're blessed right now that the pastor
[1:04:31] Evans and brother Lyle and them are
[1:04:33] going into the book of Acts
[1:04:35] and we're reading that book and we're
[1:04:37] listening I've talked to a brother a
[1:04:39] good friend of mine real good close
[1:04:40] brother the other day that's been
[1:04:41] listening in and he says Hey inside that
[1:04:44] book of Acts the series that they're
[1:04:45] doing down there has opened my eyes up
[1:04:47] so much he goes I've seen so many new
[1:04:50] things in it he goes with the direction
[1:04:52] of the Holy Spirit now he goes I'm
[1:04:54] seeing just new things in there amen
[1:04:57] well I'm going to tell you something
[1:04:58] unless we take our position and our part
[1:05:00] in the book of Acts of itself amen
[1:05:03] there's where the power is it is a
[1:05:05] living book and inside that book there's
[1:05:07] a spirit and we open ourselves up that
[1:05:09] Holy Spirit will come and live in us and
[1:05:12] it doesn't matter whether you've been a
[1:05:13] part of a church for two weeks or 20
[1:05:16] years 30 years whether you go to church
[1:05:18] or not what matters is if you believe in
[1:05:21] the name of Jesus amen that's it no
[1:05:23] matter where you go how young how old
[1:05:25] whatever you may be if you could just
[1:05:27] stand strong on the name of Jesus yes
[1:05:30] amen and you say that prayer Proclaim
[1:05:32] that name then just buckle up and just
[1:05:34] wait and watch and see what happens amen
[1:05:37] I'm gonna turn it back over here to the
[1:05:39] brother Evans I appreciate you for
[1:05:41] listening to me and God bless you all
[1:05:46] amen
[1:05:48] I've been praying recently
[1:05:53] past few months I've been asking the
[1:05:55] Lord
[1:05:57] Lord show us that you're with us
[1:06:01] Lord not
[1:06:04] everything it seems like can be
[1:06:06] impersonated but when God comes down
[1:06:10] and heal someone miraculously like that
[1:06:13] then we know that that is God because
[1:06:16] that can't be that Satan can't do that
[1:06:20] Jesus himself said if Satan casts out
[1:06:22] Satan then his kingdom is divided he
[1:06:24] doesn't do that it's only God that heals
[1:06:27] and if you know anything about the
[1:06:29] medical field you know that that when
[1:06:31] they are performing CPR on someone when
[1:06:34] their heart stops it's generally a very
[1:06:37] very bad thing
[1:06:40] brother Lionel was a a medical
[1:06:43] professional he's
[1:06:44] he's handled this for these type of
[1:06:46] things for a long time and you know that
[1:06:50] those things just don't turn around they
[1:06:52] almost never do
[1:06:55] and to see that to see the family
[1:06:57] gathered around what touched me the most
[1:06:58] about that testimony when he was telling
[1:07:00] me that the family was gathered around
[1:07:02] and it was just a just a somber really
[1:07:05] bad feeling as he said the sun was just
[1:07:08] sick and everything was just going
[1:07:11] really bad and then brother Lionel's
[1:07:14] father-in-law looks at him and he sees a
[1:07:18] man that loves the Lord that believes in
[1:07:21] healing
[1:07:23] and he says Lionel you go pray for him
[1:07:27] and what I want to talk about this
[1:07:29] morning is when we see someone when the
[1:07:33] world sees someone with that
[1:07:35] relationship
[1:07:37] with God
[1:07:40] they flock to that person
[1:07:44] and they rely on him
[1:07:46] and I that very thing this last Sunday
[1:07:49] that brother Lyle was Lionel was talking
[1:07:52] about is exactly what I'm saying this
[1:07:55] morning that when someone finally finds
[1:07:59] that relationship
[1:08:01] which is my goal in life
[1:08:04] when someone finally sees it
[1:08:07] then
[1:08:09] people have confidence in that manner in
[1:08:12] that woman
[1:08:14] and we fall so short
[1:08:16] of what God's given us
[1:08:19] I think about
[1:08:22] brother Branham said this
[1:08:25] I really appreciate this quote he says
[1:08:28] what is faith
[1:08:30] he says faith is something that's
[1:08:32] revealed to you
[1:08:35] that is not yet
[1:08:37] but you believe it will be
[1:08:40] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[1:08:44] and that's how when we are praying for
[1:08:47] something if we can just get into the
[1:08:49] spirit and we can just get God's mind on
[1:08:53] these things if we can just find God's
[1:08:56] will
[1:08:57] then
[1:08:59] our prayers will be answered
[1:09:02] we've been talking about the book of
[1:09:04] Acts a lot we see all these miracles
[1:09:06] happen in the book of Acts
[1:09:09] and you look at it and you see well okay
[1:09:11] well what's the big picture in this in
[1:09:13] these things in these Miracles that
[1:09:15] those people
[1:09:17] that were healed every one of them is
[1:09:19] dead today
[1:09:21] every one of them died
[1:09:23] but that miracle that happened that so
[1:09:27] many people saw over and over at the
[1:09:29] gate called beautiful and and Paul when
[1:09:31] that when the young man fell to his
[1:09:33] death and he died and this miracle like
[1:09:35] what brother Lionel was talking about
[1:09:37] those Miracles are also not only do they
[1:09:41] obviously benefit the person that it
[1:09:43] happened to but these Miracles also are
[1:09:45] a testimony of a living God that he's
[1:09:48] alive and he is not dead
[1:09:51] he is not a god of the past
[1:09:54] but he is a god of now
[1:09:56] that scripture means so much it means
[1:09:59] more to me every day in Hebrews chapter
[1:10:01] 13 verse 8.
[1:10:03] Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:10:07] today and forever
[1:10:11] he's the same God
[1:10:15] I think about this man Moses
[1:10:17] this man Moses had a relationship
[1:10:22] with God
[1:10:23] a wonderful relationship
[1:10:26] to where God tells Moses one day he said
[1:10:31] I know your name
[1:10:33] like wow what a thing for God to tell us
[1:10:37] Moses
[1:10:39] had this relationship with God he gave
[1:10:42] Moses showed
[1:10:45] how much he loved God not so much God
[1:10:49] loving us but sometimes we have to show
[1:10:51] how much we love him
[1:10:52] Moses showed how much he loved God he
[1:10:55] gave everything up in the whole world at
[1:10:58] 40 years old he was going to be the next
[1:11:01] pharaoh
[1:11:02] yet Moses gives it all up
[1:11:05] for this group of people that were in
[1:11:08] slavery
[1:11:11] Moses knew that those were God's people
[1:11:15] and he gave up riches and fame and
[1:11:18] everything he could if he would have
[1:11:20] been the next pharaoh
[1:11:22] he could have probably freed the slaves
[1:11:23] if he wanted to
[1:11:25] but no Moses sought God's Will and God's
[1:11:29] will was for him to go out in the
[1:11:31] wilderness for 40 years he was 40 years
[1:11:34] old double his age is how long that he
[1:11:37] was going to be there another 40 years
[1:11:40] Moses goes out in the wilderness comes
[1:11:42] back
[1:11:43] brings
[1:11:45] the children of of Israel out of Egypt
[1:11:48] out of bondage with a mighty hand goes
[1:11:51] out into the wilderness
[1:11:54] meets with God
[1:11:57] and Moses it was the desire of Moses's
[1:12:01] heart to please God and he knew that God
[1:12:04] Loved These people
[1:12:07] Moses goes up there
[1:12:11] speaks to God and
[1:12:13] and he gets excited and he's he tells
[1:12:17] the people he says you can meet God
[1:12:19] yourself
[1:12:21] he says I want you to know the same one
[1:12:23] that I know
[1:12:25] so he goes out and he tells the people
[1:12:28] he says Get Ready
[1:12:31] he says because you can meet this
[1:12:34] Jehovah God the creator of everything
[1:12:36] you can meet him
[1:12:38] look at the look at the the desire in
[1:12:41] Moses's heart God wanted that
[1:12:46] Exodus chapter 20.
[1:12:48] Verse 18 Moses says Get Ready
[1:12:52] get ready for this because we're going
[1:12:55] to go meet them
[1:12:57] they get up the next morning and they go
[1:13:01] with all of the congregation of Israel's
[1:13:03] goes to meet God
[1:13:05] and all the people saw the thunderings
[1:13:07] and the lightnings
[1:13:09] and the noise of the trumpets and the
[1:13:11] mountains smoking and when the people
[1:13:12] saw it they removed and stood afar off
[1:13:16] and they said unto Moses
[1:13:19] speak thou with us
[1:13:21] and we will hear but let not God speak
[1:13:24] with us
[1:13:25] lest we die
[1:13:29] and Moses said unto the people trying to
[1:13:31] get them back fear not God has come to
[1:13:33] prove you and that his fear may be
[1:13:36] before your faces that you sin not
[1:13:39] but here are these people and they're
[1:13:41] saying
[1:13:42] wait a minute
[1:13:45] we didn't we didn't sign up for this
[1:13:49] they see them the the Fire on the
[1:13:51] Mountain and the thunderings and the
[1:13:52] lightning and they see all this and
[1:13:53] they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa this is
[1:13:55] too much
[1:13:58] if I go before this God
[1:14:02] with all the sins that I have in my life
[1:14:06] then I'm gonna die you know what Moses
[1:14:09] why don't you just go
[1:14:12] why don't you go before us Moses you
[1:14:13] have a good relationship with him I
[1:14:15] don't really want that relationship
[1:14:18] because it's too much of a burden on me
[1:14:22] so Moses you just go and you just tell
[1:14:25] us what he said
[1:14:28] what
[1:14:29] slap in the face
[1:14:32] to God
[1:14:36] brother Braham said this
[1:14:39] the unconditional Covenant with God made
[1:14:42] with the people
[1:14:45] this is the kind of thing that I need to
[1:14:46] back up
[1:14:49] with something someone else said
[1:14:51] and now how God has always made his
[1:14:54] Covenant and when he made it with a man
[1:14:57] the greatest mistake that Israel ever
[1:15:01] made
[1:15:02] was in Exodus 19th Chapter when Grace
[1:15:04] had already provided a savior it had
[1:15:07] already provided a deliverer deliver it
[1:15:09] had already provided an atonement a shed
[1:15:12] blood and Israel said don't let God
[1:15:14] speak let Moses speak
[1:15:18] they wanted law or commandment or
[1:15:21] something that they could do themselves
[1:15:22] do you see the very nature of a man
[1:15:28] for me to go before God
[1:15:31] I have to be sincere I have to want to
[1:15:34] be with him not just want my salvation
[1:15:37] but I have to want what God wants
[1:15:40] and you look at these people
[1:15:42] they wanted their own lives
[1:15:45] they wanted their own sins they didn't
[1:15:49] want they didn't want to give them up
[1:15:51] they they said well Moses has a good
[1:15:53] relationship he's God's Prophet let's
[1:15:55] just take him
[1:15:57] imagine how that made God feel
[1:15:59] you know we we think about God
[1:16:02] and we think about God is all love
[1:16:06] and judgment
[1:16:08] and we don't see
[1:16:10] that there's
[1:16:12] a whole spectrum of feelings that God
[1:16:14] has himself in the middle
[1:16:18] so
[1:16:19] they say well
[1:16:21] we we don't we don't want
[1:16:23] what God has we don't we don't want to
[1:16:25] have that relationship we would rather
[1:16:27] have a pastor or we would rather have a
[1:16:30] mother or a father or a prophet or
[1:16:33] someone else we would rather him have
[1:16:34] that or her have that relationship
[1:16:36] because we don't really want it because
[1:16:39] the stakes are too high
[1:16:42] it's too it's too important for us
[1:16:45] that we have that personal relationship
[1:16:48] with God we would just rather someone
[1:16:50] else have that
[1:16:53] it's everywhere today
[1:16:57] and it's been here since that time God
[1:17:00] says okay
[1:17:02] from that point on
[1:17:04] I'll just speak to them
[1:17:05] through a prophet I'll just have one
[1:17:07] representative
[1:17:09] sad a sad thing that happened right
[1:17:12] there
[1:17:14] was too much pressure too much was
[1:17:16] expected I can't just go to church to be
[1:17:18] a Christian
[1:17:20] I don't need I'll just go on Sunday I'll
[1:17:23] just go to church once a week I'll just
[1:17:25] that that makes me a Christian I don't
[1:17:27] want God in my personal life
[1:17:29] I don't want God telling me what to do
[1:17:31] in the quiet time when no one is
[1:17:33] watching
[1:17:34] I don't want to have to live up
[1:17:36] to his word
[1:17:38] I don't want to have to have that
[1:17:40] relationship where he's always I'm
[1:17:41] always commuting back and forth with him
[1:17:43] but it's what God wanted
[1:17:45] so what God wanted from the beginning
[1:17:50] so then
[1:17:52] time goes on
[1:17:54] Moses
[1:17:57] goes up on the mountain
[1:17:59] to speak with God
[1:18:02] and he's up there for 40 days
[1:18:04] it doesn't take any food or water with
[1:18:06] him
[1:18:07] the people see hey now that our
[1:18:10] representative between us and God now
[1:18:13] he's gone
[1:18:15] no we don't have anybody looking over us
[1:18:18] now there's no Authority at all so let's
[1:18:20] just go back and do what we want to do
[1:18:23] so they build this golden calf they
[1:18:26] start partying they start living it up
[1:18:29] Moses comes down on the mountain and he
[1:18:32] looks and he sees what are you doing I'm
[1:18:35] gone for just this long and you
[1:18:38] immediately go back into what you came
[1:18:40] out of
[1:18:44] you immediately go back into what you
[1:18:46] came out of
[1:18:48] yeah think of denominations
[1:18:52] and he says what he says
[1:18:54] he takes the calf he throws it in the
[1:18:57] furnace Burns it up grinds it up the
[1:18:59] powder puts it in a bunch of buckets of
[1:19:02] water and says drink it now
[1:19:05] so they drink it
[1:19:08] Moses takes the Levites he says he says
[1:19:11] go and take your sword and they killed 3
[1:19:13] 000 of the people
[1:19:16] the Wrath and the anger then Moses goes
[1:19:20] back up to the mountain to plead
[1:19:23] for mercy
[1:19:25] on the people of Israel
[1:19:28] how sweet of Moses
[1:19:31] Moses knew that God loves the people
[1:19:33] Moses loved the people and he goes up
[1:19:36] and he knew that he's the one that had
[1:19:38] that relationship with God and they
[1:19:40] didn't want it
[1:19:42] so Moses knew that I have that
[1:19:44] relationship with him
[1:19:46] so I'll go and talk to him on behalf of
[1:19:49] the people the people should have been
[1:19:50] going
[1:19:52] each one of us
[1:19:54] we should have been going directly to
[1:19:56] Jehovah but no we didn't want it
[1:20:00] we wanted somebody to stand in our place
[1:20:05] Moses goes up there
[1:20:08] and like I said God don't forget God has
[1:20:10] feelings
[1:20:12] Moses goes up on the mountain
[1:20:15] and he says Lord they've done all this
[1:20:18] and
[1:20:19] and
[1:20:21] I'm sorry
[1:20:24] about it
[1:20:27] God tells Moses
[1:20:31] look at look at the sweetness of God
[1:20:34] here
[1:20:35] God looks down at Moses
[1:20:38] and he says Moses he says
[1:20:41] I promised
[1:20:43] to Abraham
[1:20:45] to Isaac
[1:20:46] and to Jacob
[1:20:48] I promised them that their offspring
[1:20:51] would go into this Promised Land over
[1:20:54] across this Jordan River I promised them
[1:20:57] that they would go over there
[1:21:00] he says so here's what I'm going to do
[1:21:02] he says Moses
[1:21:04] get them together
[1:21:06] and he said I will send my angel before
[1:21:09] you
[1:21:11] and he said this angel will destroy your
[1:21:14] enemies
[1:21:15] and he says you can take them and you
[1:21:18] can go over this Jordan River and you
[1:21:20] can have this promised land it's a place
[1:21:22] that's flowing with milk and honey it's
[1:21:24] a wonderful place it's a place that I
[1:21:26] promised you
[1:21:29] and he said
[1:21:31] but I won't go with you
[1:21:36] ask yourself
[1:21:38] if I could have everything in the world
[1:21:41] but God won't go with me
[1:21:45] what good is it
[1:21:48] I think
[1:21:49] so Moses comes back and he tells the
[1:21:51] people he says listen he says he says
[1:21:54] all he says you can have this he says we
[1:21:56] can go over he said and God will go with
[1:21:59] us and he'll send an angel and know
[1:22:00] he'll fight and destroy all the enemies
[1:22:02] there won't be any problems we can have
[1:22:03] all these grapes and we can have this
[1:22:05] land that's flowing with milk and honey
[1:22:06] but we're not going
[1:22:09] tells the people we're not going
[1:22:12] the reason we're not going
[1:22:15] is because God won't go with us
[1:22:18] oh
[1:22:20] and the people repented
[1:22:22] and they they felt awful
[1:22:26] so Moses
[1:22:28] goes back up and I want to read
[1:22:30] something
[1:22:32] Moses says in
[1:22:34] in
[1:22:35] um
[1:22:36] Exodus 33.
[1:22:39] verse number 15.
[1:22:50] no Exodus 33.
[1:22:54] verse 15. it says this there we go
[1:23:00] and Moses speaking
[1:23:03] and he said unto him speaking to Jehovah
[1:23:05] God
[1:23:07] he said If thy presence go not with me
[1:23:10] carry us not up hence
[1:23:12] Lord if you won't go with me I'm not
[1:23:15] going
[1:23:16] I'm staying with you wherever you
[1:23:18] wherever you want to be Lord that's
[1:23:20] where I want to be I don't have to have
[1:23:22] all the riches I don't have to have the
[1:23:23] biggest church I don't have to have the
[1:23:24] best music I don't have to have any of
[1:23:26] this Lord wherever you are is where I
[1:23:29] want to be I just want you
[1:23:31] I just want that fellowship with you
[1:23:36] Moses
[1:23:41] talks
[1:23:42] the Lord appreciated that remember he's
[1:23:45] a father he's got feelings
[1:23:47] he's not wrath and love he's those two
[1:23:51] things but there's all this stuff in the
[1:23:52] middle that he's got those if you have
[1:23:55] feelings he has feelings too we're Made
[1:23:56] In His Image
[1:23:58] God appreciated Moses
[1:24:01] he appreciated what he said and then
[1:24:03] Moses shows his true character Moses is
[1:24:06] is talking with the Lord back and forth
[1:24:09] and and he says and and the Lord's
[1:24:11] pleased
[1:24:12] and then Moses slips in a little
[1:24:14] question
[1:24:16] this is a good time right now I'm sure
[1:24:19] he was thinking in his mind this is a
[1:24:21] time right now that I can ask
[1:24:24] the desire of my heart
[1:24:27] Moses says
[1:24:29] Lord
[1:24:31] can I see you
[1:24:33] oh
[1:24:36] it shows Moses the desire of his heart
[1:24:38] was just to have that fellowship with
[1:24:40] God
[1:24:41] just to please God
[1:24:44] verse number 18.
[1:24:47] and he said I beseech thee show me thy
[1:24:49] Glory
[1:24:52] and he said I will make all my goodness
[1:24:54] pass before thee and I will proclaim the
[1:24:56] name of the Lord before thee and I will
[1:24:57] be gracious to whom I will be gracious
[1:24:59] and I will show Mercy to whom I will
[1:25:01] show Mercy
[1:25:04] and he said thou canst not see my face
[1:25:07] for there shall no man see me and live
[1:25:10] and the Lord said behold there is a
[1:25:12] place by me that thou shalt stand upon a
[1:25:13] rock
[1:25:14] and it shall come to pass while my glory
[1:25:17] passes by that I will put thee in the
[1:25:19] cleft of The Rock and I will cover thee
[1:25:22] with my hand while I pass by and I will
[1:25:24] take away my hand
[1:25:26] and thou shalt see my back parts
[1:25:29] but my face shall not be seen
[1:25:31] and Moses did it
[1:25:36] and all of that time
[1:25:38] in the presence of the Lord Moses was
[1:25:40] able to catch a glimpse of who this
[1:25:45] Jehovah was
[1:25:46] I'll bet you it did change him
[1:25:50] so then Moses would would commune and
[1:25:52] and talk with the Lord and after that
[1:25:55] Moses would get so close to the Lord
[1:25:57] he'd be in the presence of the Lord that
[1:25:59] he would come down and his face
[1:26:01] would shine beautifully
[1:26:04] had just this glow that everyone could
[1:26:06] see it and everyone wanted to see it and
[1:26:09] here Moses after he's in the presence
[1:26:12] Lord he comes among the people and what
[1:26:13] does he do
[1:26:15] he takes a veil
[1:26:17] and covers his face
[1:26:20] why would he do that
[1:26:22] you ever think we all we know that story
[1:26:26] but why would Moses cover his face among
[1:26:29] the people and then we go back before
[1:26:31] the Lord he take it off why
[1:26:35] maybe do you think maybe
[1:26:39] Moses didn't want it to be about him
[1:26:43] it was such a supernatural thing this
[1:26:45] man glowing and and everything about him
[1:26:47] Moses wanted it to be about God but the
[1:26:50] people kept making it about him
[1:26:53] it was the desire of his heart to get
[1:26:55] the people a relationship with God
[1:26:59] but no they didn't want God they wanted
[1:27:03] a man there so that they wouldn't have
[1:27:05] to have that relationship because there
[1:27:07] was too much at stake
[1:27:11] go go down Through the Ages
[1:27:14] and you see David
[1:27:17] is a man after God's Own Heart the Bible
[1:27:21] says very very special just tremendous
[1:27:25] human being
[1:27:27] and David one day he was in his Palace
[1:27:32] Maybe
[1:27:36] I know he was thinking about
[1:27:38] the Ark of the Covenant
[1:27:40] the Tabernacle of the Lord that Moses
[1:27:43] himself had made many many decades
[1:27:46] earlier
[1:27:48] David's thinking about that
[1:27:52] maybe he was thinking about how that the
[1:27:54] presence of God would come down how I
[1:27:57] how I just said that Moses got to see
[1:27:59] him Moses got to be with him and it
[1:28:01] changed his whole face
[1:28:03] and think about David maybe thinking on
[1:28:06] this Lord your presence and this
[1:28:09] Tabernacle of the Lord and inside the
[1:28:11] Tabernacle there was this big thick
[1:28:14] curtain that covered the whole back of
[1:28:17] the church there and inside that curtain
[1:28:20] in this little room was a place for the
[1:28:23] Ark of the Covenant what
[1:28:26] and once a year the high priest would go
[1:28:29] into that place behind that thick
[1:28:31] curtain it's called The Veil behind
[1:28:33] there
[1:28:35] and get next
[1:28:37] to this Ark this little tiny room
[1:28:41] once a year in the presence of God would
[1:28:44] come down
[1:28:46] into that room just once a year
[1:28:49] you think about oh Lord I would love to
[1:28:51] have I would love to be able to do that
[1:28:52] it was only one man that got to be in
[1:28:54] that presence only the hyper East
[1:28:58] David
[1:29:00] Maybe
[1:29:02] he looks out the window of his Palace
[1:29:04] this big beautiful palace that Davis had
[1:29:07] David has
[1:29:08] and he looks
[1:29:10] doesn't say this but maybe maybe he did
[1:29:12] maybe he could see this Tabernacle and
[1:29:15] the importance of it and The Mercy Seat
[1:29:17] and what was behind those curtains and
[1:29:19] he looks
[1:29:21] and he says
[1:29:22] he says look at this is the Ark of the
[1:29:25] Covenant
[1:29:26] this is where God makes himself known
[1:29:30] he says and look it's in a tent
[1:29:34] he says here it is in this tin I have
[1:29:35] this big Palace
[1:29:37] and God's house is a tent
[1:29:43] he says
[1:29:45] look what God did for me I was a
[1:29:47] Shepherd I was a nobody
[1:29:51] and God comes and he makes me king
[1:29:54] and even says he says I'm still a nobody
[1:29:58] and look at this big place that I have
[1:30:00] and there's God's
[1:30:02] Ark in a tent behind a curtain
[1:30:06] he had it on his heart he calls Nathan
[1:30:09] the prophet he says Nathan he says
[1:30:12] let's read what he says
[1:30:15] since First Chronicles chapter 17.
[1:30:18] verse 1.
[1:30:20] it says this now it came to pass as
[1:30:22] David sat in his house that David said
[1:30:24] to Nathan the prophet lo I dwell in a
[1:30:26] house of Cedars but the Ark of the
[1:30:28] Covenant of the Lord remains under
[1:30:29] curtains
[1:30:32] and Nathan said unto David do all that
[1:30:34] is in thy heart for God is with thee
[1:30:38] so here is David and he's asking the
[1:30:40] prophet he says I want to build this
[1:30:42] house for the Lord this house for the
[1:30:46] Ark of the Covenant this place that can
[1:30:48] hold The Mercy Seat this place where God
[1:30:50] can come in like he has it through the
[1:30:52] Wilderness come into this room this
[1:30:54] place that's much nicer than a tent
[1:30:58] because look at what all I have and then
[1:31:00] the prophet
[1:31:02] says this
[1:31:04] he says do all that is in your heart
[1:31:06] David
[1:31:10] for God is with you
[1:31:13] so I always wondered well then when I
[1:31:15] was
[1:31:17] ever since I've known this story
[1:31:20] it always bothered me how could God's
[1:31:24] Prophet tell David to do something that
[1:31:28] was not God's will
[1:31:32] wondering brother Jonathan all through
[1:31:34] the years I've wondered how could that
[1:31:36] be until this week and now I understand
[1:31:39] in studying this and studying this
[1:31:41] scripture and studying this subject
[1:31:43] because it was in David's heart not to
[1:31:46] build the temple
[1:31:47] it was in David's heart to please God
[1:31:51] it was in David's heart to to glorify
[1:31:54] God
[1:31:55] that's how Nathan in and tell him wrong
[1:31:58] Nathan knew his heart he was a man David
[1:32:02] was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:32:04] so Nathan says do what's in your heart
[1:32:06] David because God's with you and David
[1:32:09] did do what was in his heart
[1:32:13] and it came to pass that same night that
[1:32:15] the word of the Lord came to Nathan
[1:32:17] saying go and tell my servant David my
[1:32:19] servant thus saith the Lord Thou shalt
[1:32:22] not be build me a house to dwell in
[1:32:25] contradict with what he just said
[1:32:28] the prophet told him do what is in your
[1:32:31] heart
[1:32:31] and that's what our hearts should be
[1:32:34] whatever it takes to please God
[1:32:38] David what a wonderful man so then so
[1:32:41] then David
[1:32:43] after he's told that
[1:32:47] David didn't complain
[1:32:49] David said praise the Lord
[1:32:52] I'm so happy we have word from the Lord
[1:32:54] and he said basically he says what can I
[1:32:57] do
[1:32:59] how can I help
[1:33:01] Nathan says
[1:33:03] we are going to build this Temple
[1:33:06] this Temple isn't going to move around
[1:33:07] anymore
[1:33:08] it's going to be in one place
[1:33:11] and we're gonna this Temple is going to
[1:33:13] be built David could have built the
[1:33:16] temple he was he was the king greatest
[1:33:18] King that ever lived had a whole Kingdom
[1:33:21] very smart very able to do all of these
[1:33:24] things and
[1:33:26] yet the prophet says no not you and then
[1:33:29] David humbles himself and says what can
[1:33:31] I do
[1:33:32] Prophet tells him your son
[1:33:35] from your family will build it
[1:33:38] and it's not even going to build be
[1:33:39] built until after you die
[1:33:41] David says praise the Lord
[1:33:43] praise the Lord and then he goes and he
[1:33:45] prays I don't have time to read it but
[1:33:47] he prays this beautiful prayer before
[1:33:49] the Lord saying Lord Ivan I'm a nothing
[1:33:51] I came from nothing I'm I'm a I'm a poor
[1:33:54] Shepherd and you've done all this for me
[1:33:56] blessed be the name of the Lord Lord
[1:33:58] you're so great
[1:34:00] look at his attitude whatever I can do
[1:34:03] to help
[1:34:04] anything and that was the king
[1:34:07] anything I can do to help
[1:34:09] so God gave
[1:34:11] because of his David's attitude God gave
[1:34:14] him a role in this
[1:34:16] David Drew up the plans
[1:34:20] for the temple David even had the stones
[1:34:23] God David stored up the gold David had
[1:34:25] everything ready
[1:34:29] and he got to have a part but he didn't
[1:34:31] get all the glory
[1:34:33] because he shouldn't get the glory
[1:34:35] anyways
[1:34:36] it should come from God
[1:34:39] so then Solomon builds it later on he
[1:34:41] tells Solomon
[1:34:44] he says
[1:34:45] God told me why I can't build the temple
[1:34:51] he said that I've shed blood abundantly
[1:34:53] and made great Wars
[1:34:55] and I've done things that maybe my hands
[1:34:58] are dirty
[1:35:00] but you
[1:35:02] God told me
[1:35:04] that you Solomon will build this and
[1:35:09] you're going to have a father that's
[1:35:11] much greater than me look at the
[1:35:12] humility of David again
[1:35:14] he said God said that he is going to be
[1:35:18] your father
[1:35:20] and you are going to be his son
[1:35:24] and David was was rejoicing over this
[1:35:26] how happy was he that now David you're
[1:35:29] not even important as a dad anymore
[1:35:32] but look at the attitude of David saying
[1:35:34] how much
[1:35:36] how much
[1:35:38] he blessed God and please God even
[1:35:42] though all the mistakes and all the
[1:35:44] failures and we know so many of them we
[1:35:46] know the few that are written down
[1:35:48] all the failures that he did yet he
[1:35:51] pleased God so much because of that
[1:35:54] attitude Lord I love you and I'm going
[1:35:55] to put you first in everything
[1:35:59] think about
[1:36:00] what a beautiful beautiful story
[1:36:04] with David in the temple and then the
[1:36:07] temple got built and God came down just
[1:36:09] like he did with the Tabernacle in the
[1:36:11] wilderness he came down the same thing
[1:36:14] when Solomon dedicated it
[1:36:16] we call it
[1:36:18] Solomon's Temple
[1:36:20] today but I wonder is that right to call
[1:36:23] it that
[1:36:25] David was the one
[1:36:27] David was the one that had it on his
[1:36:29] heart
[1:36:31] and he he was blessed by it
[1:36:34] you know he doesn't see David building
[1:36:35] great statues to himself like like we
[1:36:38] see all the all the kings in the in the
[1:36:39] Pharaohs and all of that David wanted to
[1:36:42] build something from the law for the
[1:36:43] Lord to let him let his message go on
[1:36:46] not about David
[1:36:50] and I think about
[1:36:54] our lord Jesus
[1:36:56] the son of David
[1:36:59] with all of David's failures
[1:37:03] yet how great of a man
[1:37:06] David was
[1:37:08] how wonderful of a man that this man was
[1:37:11] how humble
[1:37:13] I read that in
[1:37:15] in second Samuel and in first Chronicles
[1:37:18] how
[1:37:19] David prayed and he said I'm a nothing
[1:37:22] Lord
[1:37:23] I am nothing
[1:37:25] of sinned I've done all these things
[1:37:27] wrong you took me from the Sheep coat
[1:37:30] you took me from taking care of my
[1:37:31] father's sheep and you made me a great
[1:37:33] man but it's all because of you
[1:37:36] I think about
[1:37:37] our Lord
[1:37:39] Jesus
[1:37:42] he had prophesied many times he said
[1:37:45] that no man can come to the father
[1:37:47] except by me
[1:37:49] he said unless I go away
[1:37:54] the comforter won't come to you he said
[1:37:57] unless I be lifted up
[1:37:59] and draw a men to me I lift it up on the
[1:38:01] cross and die Jesus knew what was coming
[1:38:04] he knew that he was going to die a
[1:38:07] sinner's death
[1:38:09] and then he comes to the Garden of
[1:38:10] Gethsemane
[1:38:13] bows down
[1:38:15] on his knees
[1:38:19] weeping and upset and knowing what's
[1:38:22] about to happen knowing probably
[1:38:24] that
[1:38:26] before this time tomorrow he was going
[1:38:28] to be in the grave
[1:38:32] crucified
[1:38:33] horrible Sinner's death
[1:38:36] and here's the 33 year old young man
[1:38:39] on his knees
[1:38:41] saying Lord I know what's coming
[1:38:46] but
[1:38:47] would you
[1:38:49] let this cup pass from me
[1:38:52] there's the flesh God made flesh
[1:38:56] and there's Jesus and he's he's just
[1:39:00] upset and he knows what's going to
[1:39:02] happen but that relationship with Christ
[1:39:05] and the father was so perfect and so
[1:39:07] close he knew exactly what God's will
[1:39:10] was
[1:39:12] and it was everything to him and he was
[1:39:14] our example
[1:39:15] he knew that he was to go to the Cross
[1:39:18] he knew that he was going to live this
[1:39:19] Life of Agony he knew what was going to
[1:39:22] happen and he gets there and he says
[1:39:24] Lord let this cup pass from me but he
[1:39:26] knew
[1:39:27] and that's why he said
[1:39:29] but thy will be done
[1:39:34] and then he went
[1:39:36] as obedient son
[1:39:39] to the cross
[1:39:42] thinking
[1:39:44] how he had that relationship with the
[1:39:49] father
[1:39:50] how Moses had that relationship with God
[1:39:54] how David had that relationship with God
[1:39:57] and we see all these Servants of the
[1:39:59] Lord then we see that Spirit come in on
[1:40:02] the with the disciples in the book of
[1:40:04] Acts
[1:40:05] and how they had that relationship with
[1:40:08] God and people would see them
[1:40:12] and they would ask for prayer
[1:40:16] just like with brother Lionel
[1:40:19] and God would God would take care of it
[1:40:22] he would answer those prayers
[1:40:26] and I look at us and how I want that
[1:40:29] relationship with God just think about
[1:40:32] up on the mountain Moses is there God's
[1:40:35] up there and I Say No Moses you go ahead
[1:40:37] I don't want to live that life I don't
[1:40:39] care as much I'll just let you do all my
[1:40:42] work for me I'll stay here and then
[1:40:43] Moses is gone for 40 years and all of a
[1:40:46] sudden you fall right into sin
[1:40:48] 40 days I'm sorry
[1:40:50] fall right into sin like that
[1:40:53] because that was in their heart
[1:40:56] and what is in our heart today do we
[1:40:58] truly want to serve God whatever it
[1:41:01] takes Lord I want to be there I want to
[1:41:03] have that relationship with you or do
[1:41:05] you just come to church
[1:41:08] just come to church once a week and say
[1:41:09] oh well
[1:41:10] you know it's a good sermon today really
[1:41:12] made me think
[1:41:14] that doesn't matter
[1:41:16] what matters is that you know him
[1:41:21] doesn't matter who's in the Pulpit it
[1:41:24] doesn't matter what prophet was there
[1:41:26] doesn't matter how great of a man or a
[1:41:28] woman your mom or your dad were was are
[1:41:32] what matters is that you know him and
[1:41:34] Moses it was everything to him he was
[1:41:36] all excited come meet him come we we can
[1:41:39] we can we can meet him and then what
[1:41:42] No Moses you go ahead
[1:41:46] we quote that scripture so much
[1:41:49] because it's true but let me tell you it
[1:41:51] was a bad thing that happened on that
[1:41:54] day
[1:41:56] and God separated himself from mankind
[1:42:01] and yet the sweetness of God he says I
[1:42:06] promised it to you you go ahead
[1:42:08] go ahead into this Promised Land
[1:42:11] just go over Jordan I'll send an angel
[1:42:13] and and one angel
[1:42:16] I mean what could he do
[1:42:18] conquers everybody said he says there
[1:42:20] won't be any enemies or anything you can
[1:42:22] go there I'll kill them all with my
[1:42:24] angel will kill them all but I'm not
[1:42:26] going to go
[1:42:28] Moses said uh-uh no no no no
[1:42:32] if you're not going we're not going
[1:42:38] where would you have been what decision
[1:42:39] would you have made
[1:42:41] in that day
[1:42:43] you can have everything you can go to
[1:42:46] church
[1:42:47] they have great church
[1:42:50] have a feel-good sermon
[1:42:52] you can you can have wealth
[1:42:55] you can have a good job you can have
[1:42:56] whatever you can have a good retirement
[1:42:58] you can have whatever you want
[1:43:02] but
[1:43:04] I'm not there
[1:43:06] you could have miracles
[1:43:08] you think the angel wouldn't have
[1:43:09] performed Miracles he would have
[1:43:12] you can have all of this
[1:43:16] but you won't have a relationship with
[1:43:18] me
[1:43:20] how many fall into that category how
[1:43:23] many in the room today
[1:43:25] fall into that category do we spend time
[1:43:29] do we spend the time that Moses did
[1:43:31] seeking God
[1:43:34] Jesus himself
[1:43:36] says he prayed all night
[1:43:39] before he even chose his disciples
[1:43:42] the son of God
[1:43:45] but do we do I have that relationship am
[1:43:48] I willing to give whatever it takes
[1:43:54] to have that relationship with God
[1:43:58] Jesus says
[1:44:01] in John chapter 8 Jesus says I always do
[1:44:06] that
[1:44:07] which pleases my father
[1:44:10] what a what a statement a I think about
[1:44:12] that statement all the time
[1:44:15] I always do that which pleases my father
[1:44:19] Jesus was a virgin-born Son of God he
[1:44:21] was perfect
[1:44:23] he never made a mistake he never sinned
[1:44:26] we are much different than that but we
[1:44:28] can have that same attitude where I
[1:44:30] always want
[1:44:31] to do that which pleases my father
[1:44:34] and how many times we fail
[1:44:36] we make mistakes look at Peter
[1:44:39] I've been talking this week
[1:44:42] a number
[1:44:45] of
[1:44:46] people a few have talked to me
[1:44:50] and said
[1:44:52] I've made a mistake and I feel bad I
[1:44:54] feel embarrassed for it
[1:44:56] or they say that I have I have a
[1:44:59] decision to make
[1:45:01] and I need to make the right decision
[1:45:05] and I think I look at Peter
[1:45:07] and I think about the embarrassment if
[1:45:09] we make a mistake and we all do and we
[1:45:11] all think everybody's looking at us
[1:45:12] imagine Peter's mistakes
[1:45:15] Peter made him
[1:45:16] and it wasn't just his friends that
[1:45:18] found out about him
[1:45:20] it was 2 000 years of Bible readers know
[1:45:22] every single one of Peter's mistakes
[1:45:25] well you're talking about being
[1:45:26] embarrassed
[1:45:28] Peter made all these mistakes
[1:45:30] person after person preacher after
[1:45:33] preacher Bible reader after Bible reader
[1:45:35] has looked at this like wow Peter really
[1:45:37] messed up right there
[1:45:39] yet Peter was willing
[1:45:42] to always repent he was willing to
[1:45:44] always make things right and I thank God
[1:45:47] that these mistakes are recorded from
[1:45:48] these Great Men of God because I look at
[1:45:50] myself it's like yeah Peter made that
[1:45:52] one I've made a lot worse
[1:45:56] but there has to be the musicians can
[1:45:59] come and we'll close there has to be
[1:46:03] a relationship there has to be that we
[1:46:06] talk with God we want to be closer to
[1:46:10] him and when we are making these
[1:46:12] decisions and many of us are up against
[1:46:15] a decision right now don't think Lord
[1:46:19] how will this benefit me get on your
[1:46:22] knees and pray and say Lord I need this
[1:46:24] or I want this maybe we should get on
[1:46:27] our knees and say Lord what do you want
[1:46:30] what will benefit you
[1:46:33] how can I serve you
[1:46:36] because that is what we need that's the
[1:46:39] same that Moses had to say that David
[1:46:41] had the same that Jesus had Lord what
[1:46:44] can I say that will further your kingdom
[1:46:49] and your will
[1:46:51] that's a true relationship with God
[1:46:55] and it's not so much Lord I need this
[1:46:58] and I need that and and I need help here
[1:47:01] because it's not about me it's not about
[1:47:04] us
[1:47:06] God has made this whole book
[1:47:10] everything
[1:47:13] has been about us
[1:47:15] taking care of us
[1:47:17] healing us giving us joy
[1:47:21] he's making he's made everything about
[1:47:23] us if we have his same Holy Spirit maybe
[1:47:26] we should start making it about him amen
[1:47:29] do you believe that
[1:47:32] when you're making a decision
[1:47:36] when you're doing
[1:47:39] everything
[1:47:41] in our lives
[1:47:44] make it about him
[1:47:48] go up on that mountain
[1:47:51] as Moses did
[1:47:54] go up there saying Lord I want to talk
[1:47:59] with you
[1:48:00] I want to see you
[1:48:03] that is the holy spirit operating in a
[1:48:07] person
[1:48:09] it's not saying well
[1:48:12] I'll get this brother and we should pray
[1:48:14] for each other prophets ask for prayer
[1:48:16] for each other
[1:48:19] but when we're making a decision Lord
[1:48:21] what do you want me to do
[1:48:23] what would please you I love that
[1:48:26] scripture so much how David
[1:48:30] looked out
[1:48:32] and he saw this tent and he saw the Ark
[1:48:36] of the Covenant in there he saw that God
[1:48:38] comes in there once a year with the high
[1:48:40] priest he saw it and he says Lord
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:45] I want to build you a house
[1:48:47] it's for you
[1:48:50] and Nathan says do all that's in your
[1:48:52] heart
[1:48:53] and he did do what was in his heart
[1:48:55] thinking about that that thick curtain I
[1:48:59] was there
[1:49:01] and how that the holy of holies back
[1:49:04] there God would come in back there and
[1:49:06] he would just have that one high priest
[1:49:08] and his presence would be made known
[1:49:11] behind that curtain then Jesus we see
[1:49:14] him at the Garden of the Gethsemane the
[1:49:16] next day he goes in he's crucified
[1:49:19] there was an earthquake in Jerusalem
[1:49:22] that same curtain that was now in that
[1:49:25] Temple
[1:49:27] that curtain was ripped from the bottom
[1:49:30] to the top
[1:49:32] no more no more do you have to go
[1:49:35] through a mediator
[1:49:37] there's one mediator between God and man
[1:49:40] the man Christ Jesus that curtain was up
[1:49:43] there it was ripped into and now
[1:49:46] before to go inside that curtain was
[1:49:49] death
[1:49:50] now if you don't go to that place
[1:49:54] if you don't meet that same Jehovah God
[1:49:57] it's death
[1:49:59] what a wonderful thing that Jesus did
[1:50:01] for us
[1:50:02] made it to where we can go straight to
[1:50:05] God they made that mistake in Exodus but
[1:50:08] now it's different
[1:50:11] now we can't go straight to God if we
[1:50:14] want that relationship
[1:50:16] we have to have it friends It's gotta be
[1:50:19] let's stand
[1:50:24] do you want the relationship with God
[1:50:26] raise your hand if you want it
[1:50:29] foreign
[1:50:33] and I can promise you this
[1:50:36] you know in the scriptures that I've
[1:50:37] I've read here God wants that
[1:50:40] relationship more with you than you want
[1:50:43] it with him
[1:50:45] he's got feelings he's got a sweetness
[1:50:48] to him
[1:50:49] he loves us
[1:50:51] and however many times we put him off
[1:50:56] no you you might be
[1:50:59] driving to work and it's like well I
[1:51:01] prayed today I I said Lord take me to
[1:51:03] take me safely today
[1:51:05] I prayed today I I asked him Lord help
[1:51:08] me with this Lord help me with that
[1:51:09] that's not worship
[1:51:13] that's just asking him for something and
[1:51:15] he gives and I know he gives
[1:51:19] but maybe
[1:51:21] do you think
[1:51:22] that we could go before him and ask him
[1:51:24] Lord what do you want
[1:51:27] to say Moses did
[1:51:29] if you're not there I'm not going
[1:51:31] Lord what do you want
[1:51:33] [Music]
