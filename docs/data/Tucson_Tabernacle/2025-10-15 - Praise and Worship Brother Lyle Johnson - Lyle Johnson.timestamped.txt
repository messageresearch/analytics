[5:45] [Music]
[5:48] Let's sing Above All and then Brother
[5:50] Dan's got some uh prayer request and
[5:53] we'll sing this one first though.
[5:56] [Music]
[5:58] Above all,
[6:02] above all powers,
[6:07] above all peace,
[6:11] above all nature
[6:14] and all created things,
[6:20] above all wisdom
[6:23] and all the ways of
[6:31] You were here before the world begin.

[6:59] and treasures of the earth.
[7:06] Well, there's no way to measure what
[7:10] your word
[7:15] crucified
[7:19] and laid behind the stone.
[7:23] He lived
[7:25] to die.
[7:28] Rejected and alone
[7:31] like a road
[7:34] trampled on the ground.
[7:39] You took the fall.
[7:44] You thought of me
[7:48] above all.
[7:53] Oh, crucified
[7:58] and laid behind the stone.
[8:02] He lived
[8:04] to die.
[8:06] Rejected and alone
[8:10] like a pro.
[8:13] trampled on the ground.
[8:18] You took the fall
[8:22] and you thought of me
[8:27] above all.
[8:32] [Music]
[8:38] Brother Ed, are there any more prayer
[8:39] requests back there?
[8:43] I got uh a couple prayer requests to
[8:46] bring before the Lord gathering
[8:49] together.
[8:51] Believe it was Jesus that said that
[8:53] wherever just two of you agree
[8:55] on something and bring it before the
[8:58] father that he will grant a request
[9:02] um to dire needs tonight. And uh Sister
[9:07] Alberta, I believe this came from you
[9:09] that brother Bobby Wartz is in uh is
[9:12] very close maybe to passing on. Is that
[9:16] right? Um Brother Bobby is he's a dear
[9:19] friend to me. He's actually family. Uh
[9:23] my
[9:24] sister is married to uh Bobby's nephew
[9:28] and I've known brother Bobby for a long
[9:30] time and he's really one of my favorite
[9:33] people in the whole world. I know he's
[9:34] meant a lot to the Tucson Tabernacle. He
[9:36] was close friends with Brother Green
[9:39] and uh he's he's done a lot for us. He's
[9:41] done a lot for Tucson.
[9:43] So, please let's remember Brother Bobby
[9:46] and his family in prayer. And then also
[9:50] a dear friend to me, and that's my
[9:53] uncle. His name is Troy Petty. He's come
[9:56] to church here a couple times. He um I
[10:00] don't know about 10 or 15 about 10 years
[10:02] ago or so he moved from Tucson to San
[10:06] Antonio. He never had in his heart ever
[10:10] to serve God. He was always a good man,
[10:13] but he moved to San Antonio and someone
[10:15] invited him to church.
[10:18] And Troy gave his heart to the Lord. He
[10:21] moved back home to Tucson a few years
[10:24] ago.
[10:26] And uh now
[10:28] He uh had some health problems and um
[10:33] yesterday he was he's been in the
[10:35] hospital for a couple weeks now and
[10:39] yesterday his heart stopped twice and
[10:43] they were able to bring him back but it
[10:46] looks like he could pass away at any
[10:48] time. my cousin
[10:51] who um he's very very close with his
[10:53] dad. Uh Troy's son, my cousin Kyle, is
[10:57] right now in Louisiana
[10:59] and um
[11:03] I can only imagine.
[11:05] Kyle's about um
[11:09] he's a little older than Daniel and I
[11:12] can just imagine the place that he's in
[11:15] knowing that his dad is um he's
[11:19] incoherent right now and he could pass
[11:20] at any time. So if we could remember uh
[11:25] brother Bobby and brother Chro brother
[11:28] Troy
[11:30] um two men that I know both of them very
[11:33] well and I believe that either one of
[11:36] them if they go to meet the Lord Jesus
[11:39] today everything will be fine
[11:42] and that's friends that's how we want to
[11:44] be when we go meet the Lord Jesus I want
[11:48] everything here to be fine and when I go
[11:51] to meet him. I don't want to bring any
[11:53] baggage. I want it all confessed before
[11:54] him. And then putting our all of our
[11:58] trust in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[12:02] Can you imagine
[12:04] when Troy
[12:06] was invited to go to church?
[12:12] Can you imagine the person that invited
[12:14] him? I don't even know who it was.
[12:17] Person that invited him.
[12:20] and uh the Lord did something for him.
[12:23] Can you imagine the honor
[12:26] of you being part of the salvation
[12:29] of this man or anyone else and the
[12:33] importance that we have that we can
[12:35] invite someone to church
[12:38] and they can give their hearts to the
[12:40] Lord Jesus Christ.
[12:43] It's brother Random said it's greater
[12:47] than 10,000 worlds is one soul.
[12:52] So let's friends and is there anyone
[12:54] else? Do you maybe have a prayer request
[12:57] that you have for yourself or something
[13:00] or or someone else that's on your heart?
[13:02] If you have a request, make it known
[13:04] before the Lord with an uplifted hand.
[13:08] Let's bow our heads.
[13:11] our great and mighty God.
[13:15] Lord, with Troy and Bobby, we bring them
[13:18] before you
[13:20] in the name of Jesus Christ, the one who
[13:22] died for our sins.
[13:24] And we ask, Father, that your will would
[13:27] be done in both of their lives.
[13:30] That you would strengthen the families
[13:32] during this time.
[13:34] And Lord, if if it would be your will
[13:37] that either one of them or both of them
[13:39] would raise up off of that hospital bed
[13:41] and be completely healed in Jesus' name,
[13:44] Lord, we pray that it would happen.
[13:47] Lord, we want your will in these things.
[13:52] And Lord,
[13:54] sometimes it's easy to say that we want
[13:56] your will, which is maybe taking the
[14:00] easy thing, but sometimes Lord, your
[14:01] will is for healing.
[14:04] And Lord, we place these requests before
[14:06] you in the name of Jesus Christ and ask
[14:09] that you would heal them if it be your
[14:12] will. And Lord, you saw all these
[14:14] uplifted hands.
[14:17] Dear God, you you've
[14:20] parted the Red Sea. You created the
[14:22] heavens and the earth. Lord, you can do
[14:23] anything.
[14:25] We pray father that
[14:27] you would grant every request
[14:31] represented by every uplifted hand.
[14:34] Lord, we are your children and we place
[14:37] this into your hands in the name of
[14:39] Jesus Christ like you commanded in St.
[14:42] John 14:14. Ask anything in my name and
[14:44] I will do it. Lord, here we have
[14:46] requests and we place them into your
[14:48] hands in the name of Jesus Christ.
[14:52] And Lord, may your will be done in all
[14:54] of these things. Amen.
[14:58] God bless you, brother Michael. You can
[14:59] be seated.
[15:07] Change
[15:09] [Music]
[15:10] my heart, oh God.
[15:15] [Music]
[15:17] Make it ever true.
[15:23] Oh, change my heart, oh God.

[16:05] I am the clay.
[16:12] Hold me and make me.
[16:17] This is what I pray.
[16:22] Oh, change my heart, oh God.
[16:29] Make it ever true.
[16:34] Oh, change my heart, oh God.
[16:40] May I be like you.
[16:46] Oh, you are the potter.
[16:52] I am the flame.
[16:58] Hold me and make me.
[17:03] This is what I pray.
[17:06] [Music]

[17:15] Make it ever true.
[17:20] Change my heart. Oh God,
[17:24] [Music]
[17:26] may I be like you.
[17:29] [Music]
[17:40] I am thine, oh Lord. I have heard thy
[17:48] voice and it told
[17:51] thy love
[17:53] to me,
[17:56] but I long to rise in the arms of faith
[18:04] and be closer
[18:07] drawn to thee.
[18:12] Draw me nearer,
[18:15] [Music]
[18:18] nearer, less
[18:21] to the cross where thou has done.
[18:29] Draw me nearer.
[18:31] [Music]
[18:34] Nearer blessed Lord
[18:38] to thy preious
[18:41] lead.
[18:47] Consecrate
[18:49] me now to thy service,
[18:54] Lord, by the power of grace divine.
[19:02] Let my soul look up with the steadfast
[19:09] hope and my will
[19:12] be lost
[19:14] tonight.
[19:17] Draw me nearer,
[19:20] [Music]
[19:22] nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross where
[19:28] thou has done.
[19:33] Draw me nearer,
[19:38] nearer, blessed
[19:42] to thy preious
[19:46] leading
[19:47] side.
[19:50] Oh, the pure delight
[19:54] of a single
[19:57] louder than before
[20:00] thy throne. I stand
[20:05] when I kneel in prayer. And with thee,
[20:11] my God, I commune
[20:15] as friend with friend.
[20:20] Draw me nearer,
[20:24] nearer, bless
[20:27] to the cross where thou hast died.
[20:34] Draw me nearer,
[20:39] nearer. Blessed Lord
[20:44] to thy precious
[20:47] bleeding
[20:49] son.
[20:52] There are depths of love that I cannot
[20:58] know till I cross
[21:01] the narrow
[21:03] sea.
[21:06] There are heights of joy that I may not
[21:13] reach till I rest in peace with thee.
[21:21] Draw me nearer,
[21:25] nearer, blessed
[21:28] to the cross where thou has died.
[21:36] Draw me nearer,
[21:38] [Music]
[21:40] nearer. Bless those
[21:45] to thy preious
[21:48] leading
[21:50] son.
[21:52] [Music]
[22:00] The world will try to satisfy
[22:05] [Music]
[22:08] that longing
[22:10] in your soul. And you may search the
[22:17] whole world over,
[22:21] but you'll be
[22:24] just as before.
[22:28] You'll never find
[22:31] true satisfaction.
[22:35] Oh, not until
[22:37] you found the love. For only
[22:43] Jesus
[22:45] can satisfy
[22:48] your soul.
[22:51] [Music]
[22:53] And only Jesus
[22:58] can satisfy
[23:01] your soul.
[23:05] And only he
[23:09] can change your heart
[23:12] and make you whole.
[23:18] He'll give you peace
[23:22] you never knew.
[23:25] Sweet love and joy
[23:28] in heaven too for only
[23:32] Jesus
[23:36] satisfy
[23:38] your soul.
[23:43] If you could have
[23:47] the faith and fortune
[23:50] and all the wealth you could obtain.
[23:56] Yet if you have not Christ within you,
[24:03] you're living here would be in pain. But
[24:08] there'll come a time
[24:12] when death shall call you.
[24:15] Your riches cannot
[24:18] help you.
[24:21] So come to Jesus
[24:24] for only he
[24:27] sisfied
[24:32] and only Jesus
[24:37] can satisfy
[24:40] your soul.
[24:44] And only he
[24:48] can change your heart
[24:51] and make you whole.
[24:56] Oh, he'll give you peace
[25:00] you never knew.
[25:03] Sweet love and joy
[25:06] in heaven too. For only Jesus
[25:13] can satisfy
[25:16] your soul.
[25:20] And only Jesus
[25:23] [Music]
[25:25] can satisfy
[25:28] your soul.
[25:32] And only he
[25:36] can change your heart.
[25:39] I make you home.
[25:44] Give me the peace
[25:47] you never knew.
[25:50] Sweet love and joy
[25:54] in heaven too. For only Jesus
[26:00] has satisfied
[26:04] the soul.
[26:08] Thank you. Good evening.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Good evening.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Let me try that again. Good evening.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Good evening.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Tonight we continue our Bible
[26:20] study on praise and worship. You know,
[26:23] it'll be different than it was last week
[26:24] because that's different than it was
[26:26] last week.
[26:29] Not too many people are reading it.
[26:30] That's fine. The series began six weeks
[26:32] ago when brother Josiah AO brought us a
[26:35] lesson on the overall theme of praise
[26:37] and worship. Tonight, let's explore for
[26:41] a bit the topics of sacrifice and
[26:43] offering in the context of what God
[26:46] values.
[26:53] This past week was the feast of
[26:55] tabernacles or sukkot in Hebrew. A
[26:58] reminder of the journey under Moses from
[27:01] Egypt to Canaan. A reminder to all of us
[27:04] that our journey in this life is just
[27:07] that. It's a journey. It's temporary.
[27:11] After which we'll enter the promised
[27:14] land. The day after tabernacles ends,
[27:18] there's a celebration called Torah,
[27:21] which means joy in the Torah.
[27:29] I've got to learn to operate this a
[27:30] little better. The scrolls of the Torah,
[27:33] the the five books of Moses are removed
[27:35] from their place of honor in the
[27:36] synagogue. And men literally dance with
[27:40] the scroll, passing it from person to
[27:43] person. That celebration ended at
[27:46] sundown this evening.
[27:49] Some Torah today served as a reminder to
[27:52] me that we need to find joy in the word
[27:57] of the Lord. It's been preserved,
[28:01] handed down, translated for us at great
[28:04] cost to many people.
[28:08] Before we open the word and celebrate in
[28:11] its message to us, let's approach the
[28:14] throne of our creator once more
[28:15] together.
[28:18] Lord Jesus, it's an honor.
[28:23] It's a privilege.
[28:25] It's a responsibility,
[28:27] Lord, to stand before those that you
[28:30] have purchased with your blood, just as
[28:33] you've purchased me with your blood.
[28:35] There's no big eyes. There's no little
[28:37] U's. We're all brothers and sisters in
[28:39] Christ Jesus. You've given us all a
[28:42] post. You've given us all a gift. You've
[28:44] given us all a responsibility. And Lord,
[28:47] help us to know that and to fulfill it
[28:49] to the best that we're able. And with
[28:51] your help, Lord, and in submission to
[28:53] you, Lord, I pray that you forgive us
[28:56] where we have fallen short today. And
[28:58] Lord, that that we just be able to enter
[29:01] into your word, enter into your spirit.
[29:03] Lord, seal my lips, Lord, that I don't
[29:05] say anything, Lord, that would cause
[29:07] anyone harm, to stumble, to be misled,
[29:11] to be misunderstood.
[29:13] But Lord, we just desire to draw
[29:15] together in love to one another and to
[29:18] you. Speak to us this evening, Lord.
[29:21] Answer our questions. Be very near. We
[29:25] ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[29:30] For our opening verses,
[29:32] we'll read from the first time an
[29:35] offering is recorded. It's a familiar
[29:38] story.
[29:41] It's from Genesis chapter 4. We're told,
[29:45] "Adam knew Eve, his wife, and she
[29:48] conceived and bare Cain and said, "I
[29:51] have gotten a man from the Lord." And
[29:54] she again bare his brother Abel. Abel
[29:58] was a keeper of sheep. Cain a tiller of
[30:02] the ground.
[30:04] So we have two baby boys raised as
[30:07] brothers by Adam and Eve. The only
[30:10] parents they knew or would ever know.
[30:14] Adam was a hardworking subsistence
[30:16] farmer. Genesis 2:5 tells us there was
[30:20] not a man to till the ground. So two
[30:22] verses later, God creates Adam from the
[30:24] dust of the earth. created to work.
[30:28] The brothers undoubtedly were told the
[30:31] history of the Garden of Eden, of the
[30:33] fall, of the break and daily communion
[30:35] with God.
[30:37] Years passed. The boys grew into young
[30:40] men, helping with the chores of the
[30:42] family farm. Abel focused on
[30:46] domesticating and raising the animals.
[30:48] Cain on the crops, the labor of
[30:51] planting, weeding,
[30:54] harvesting,
[30:56] and in process of time, it came to pass
[30:59] that Cain brought of the fruit of the
[31:01] ground an offering unto the Lord.
[31:05] Note, this is an offering, free will, by
[31:10] choice. No indication of a demand from
[31:13] God. There are no laws or rules
[31:16] mentioned in the Bible to this point
[31:18] apart from the expulsion from Eden's
[31:21] garden and that you've got to work hard
[31:23] in order to eat. And Abel, he also
[31:26] brought of the first things of his flock
[31:28] and of the fat thereof.
[31:31] Most of the times I've heard any
[31:33] preaching or teaching or other reference
[31:35] to these verses, it's focused on the
[31:37] nature of the offering, its contents.
[31:40] specifically that Abel had an insight
[31:43] what often termed a revelation about the
[31:46] original sin and offered an animal a
[31:49] blood sacrifice. I believe that's true
[31:53] and that Cain didn't. Instead, he
[31:56] offered from his crops, most likely
[31:58] grain.
[32:00] Like Adam, the only dad he ever knew,
[32:04] Cain was a subsistence farmer.
[32:07] And the Lord had respect. The root here
[32:10] is gaze with regard. Lord had respect
[32:14] unto Abel and to his offering. But unto
[32:17] Cain and his offering he had not
[32:19] respect. And Cain was very wroth. The
[32:23] words there really mean he's burning
[32:25] with anger. The root of that has to do
[32:27] with heat, intense heat. And his
[32:29] countenance fell.
[32:32] Please be seated.
[32:35] The Lord respected Abel and the Lord
[32:39] respected and accepted Abel's offering.
[32:43] The Lord did not respect Cain and the
[32:46] Lord rejected Cain's offering.
[32:51] Why?
[32:54] In the context of this series being on
[32:56] praise and worship, we understand that
[33:00] worship is submission to God. Submission
[33:04] is not a gift or an offering. It's a
[33:07] requirement.
[33:09] Let's consider this story with emphasis
[33:12] that the offerings were of the brother's
[33:14] own free will.
[33:16] Abel wanted to offer something of value
[33:19] to God
[33:20] as did Cain. In fact, Cain led the
[33:24] charge, so to speak. The Bible tells us
[33:26] Cain brought an offering and also Abel
[33:29] brought an offering.
[33:32] Abel offered from how he made a living
[33:35] from his flock something of value to him
[33:38] which God accepted.
[33:40] Cain also offered from how he made a
[33:42] living from his crops things of value to
[33:46] him as well
[33:48] which God rejected.
[33:51] Why
[33:53] is there something inherently wrong with
[33:55] an offering of produce rather than
[33:57] animals?
[33:59] Remember
[34:03] this is before any rules about
[34:05] sacrifices or offerings are recorded in
[34:07] Leviticus 23 many many centuries after
[34:10] Cain and Abel. We read, "The Lord spake
[34:14] unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the
[34:17] children of Israel, say unto them, when
[34:20] ye become into the land which I give
[34:22] unto you, and shall reap of the harvest
[34:24] thereof, then shall you bring a sheath
[34:27] of the first fruits of your harvest unto
[34:29] the priest.
[34:31] And he shall wave the sheath before the
[34:34] Lord to be accepted by you for you on
[34:38] the on the tomorrow after the Sabbath
[34:41] the priest shall wave it. And ye shall
[34:44] offer that day when ye waved the sheath
[34:47] a male lamb without blemish of the first
[34:49] year for a burnt offering unto the Lord.
[34:53] Sounds a lot like Genesis 4. Cain led
[34:57] with a grain followed by Abel with a
[34:59] lamb.
[35:02] and and the meat that is the grain
[35:07] offering thereof shall be two tense
[35:09] deals of fine flour mingled with oil
[35:11] giving a recipe here. They're really got
[35:13] rules. An offering made by fire unto the
[35:16] Lord for a sweet savor and the drink
[35:18] offering thereof shall be of wine, the
[35:20] fourth part of an hen.
[35:23] So from this we see that bringing to the
[35:26] Lord an offering of grain, the food
[35:28] stuffs from your farm is not wrong. It's
[35:32] not bad.
[35:34] The rules for this sort of thing were
[35:36] codified under Moses. But in the time of
[35:38] Cain and Abel, no rules or restrictions
[35:41] are recorded.
[35:45] We're taught correctly, I believe, that
[35:47] Abel had what we call a revelation
[35:49] concerning this sin in the garden and
[35:51] offered a blood sacrifice.
[35:54] Looking to future requirements for
[35:56] offerings and sacrifices, just as we
[35:58] read from Leviticus, not all offerings
[36:00] or sacrifices were blood sacrifices.
[36:04] So, it seems there was nothing about
[36:07] Cain's offering in and of itself
[36:10] that should have caused God to be
[36:12] unhappy with it or reject it. Yet, he
[36:16] did reject it. In fact, he rejected both
[36:19] it and Cain.
[36:22] What's going on?
[36:25] And specifically, how does this relate
[36:29] to our praise and worship today? our
[36:33] offering of praise among other things.
[36:38] Going back to Genesis 4,
[36:40] the Lord had respect, looked with favor,
[36:43] regarded, accepted unto Abel and to his
[36:47] offering. But unto Cain and to his
[36:50] offering, he had not respect, but with
[36:53] disfavor,
[36:54] disregard.
[36:56] Cain was burning with anger, and his
[37:00] countenance fell. You could see it on
[37:02] his face. He is so angry.
[37:08] And the Lord said unto Cain,
[37:14] "Why art thou wroth?"
[37:17] Why is thy countenance fallen?
[37:20] God focuses on Cain's reaction.
[37:24] Cain didn't ask,
[37:26] "Why did you reject this?
[37:29] What did I do wrong?
[37:31] H how can I do better and be accepted
[37:33] and respected?
[37:36] Cain was angry
[37:39] rather than simply disappointed.
[37:41] And God cares enough about Cain that he
[37:46] is speaking to him having a one- on-one
[37:49] conversation.
[37:51] If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
[37:54] accepted? If thou doest not well? Sin
[37:57] lith at the door, and unto thee shall be
[37:59] his desire. Thou shalt rule over him.
[38:02] Sometimes when we read some of the King
[38:04] James English,
[38:07] I don't know about you. I tend to just
[38:08] scratch my head. It's easy. I got no
[38:10] hair, so I can I can scratch my head.
[38:12] But let's look at in the NLT.
[38:17] Why are you so angry? The Lord asked
[38:20] Cain. Why do you look so dejected?
[38:24] Cain, you will be accepted. You will be
[38:27] accepted if you do what is right. But if
[38:30] you refuse to do what is right, watch
[38:33] out. Sin is crouching at the door, eager
[38:36] to control you. But you must subdue it
[38:40] and be its master.
[38:43] God tells Cain he can recover from this.
[38:47] to be aware that sin is always our
[38:50] enemy, ready to snatch us and take
[38:53] control, but that Cain and by extension
[38:58] each of us has the ability to resist
[39:02] sin.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; We call it free will, making choices.
[39:10] The Lord is using this event as an
[39:13] opportunity to instruct and teach Cain,
[39:17] just as Jesus would later use every
[39:19] opportunity, including failure, to teach
[39:22] and instruct his followers.
[39:26] What choice did Cain make?
[39:30] Cain talked with Abel, his brother. It
[39:32] came to pass when they were in the
[39:34] field, Cain rose up against his brother
[39:36] Abel and killed him.
[39:41] And the Lord said unto Cain, "Uh, where
[39:45] is Abel? Your brother?"
[39:48] God is still offering Cain an
[39:50] opportunity to repent, to do what's
[39:53] right, to confess.
[39:56] But Cain doesn't seize this opportunity.
[39:59] He tries to deflect. I'm sure none of us
[40:01] have ever tried to deflect when we're
[40:03] caught doing something
[40:05] guilty.
[40:09] And Cain said, "I know not. Am I
[40:13] responsible for my brother?"
[40:17] And God said, "What hast thou done?
[40:23] The voice of thy brother's blood crith
[40:26] unto me from the ground."
[40:29] And now art thou cursed from the earth,
[40:33] which hath opened her mouth to receive
[40:35] thy brother's blood from thy hand.
[40:39] You've had your last chance, Cain.
[40:42] When thou tillest the ground, it shall
[40:45] not henceforth yield unto thee her
[40:47] strength. A fugitive and a vagabond
[40:50] shalt thou be in the earth.
[40:55] And Cain said unto the Lord,
[40:58] "My punishment is greater than I can
[41:00] bear. Behold, you've driven me out this
[41:04] day from the face of the earth, and and
[41:06] from thy face shall I be hid."
[41:10] Notice Cain's response when confronted
[41:12] with his sin and its consequences.
[41:16] Does he repent?
[41:18] Does he ask for mercy?
[41:21] No. He feels sorry for himself. My
[41:25] punishment is more than I can handle.
[41:28] Cain's focus is on Cain.
[41:33] Well, we'll end the story of Cain and
[41:35] Abel here.
[41:37] We might ask, why did God reject Cain's
[41:40] offering? He later required or seemed to
[41:43] require exactly what Cain was offering.
[41:47] Why would the Lord treat doing the right
[41:50] thing as doing the wrong thing?
[41:55] Jesus talked about this in another way
[41:58] in uh you may have heard of it, the
[42:00] sermon on the mount.
[42:06] Matthew 7 verse 21. Not everyone that
[42:11] saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
[42:15] into the kingdom of heaven,
[42:17] &gt;&gt; but he that doeth the will of my father
[42:19] which is in heaven. That's exactly what
[42:22] God told Cain in Genesis 4:7. You do the
[42:25] right thing, you'll be accepted.
[42:29] Jesus goes on, "Many will say to me in
[42:32] that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
[42:36] prophesied in thy name? And in thy name
[42:39] have cast out devils, and in thy name
[42:41] done many wonderful works. We did
[42:44] exactly as you instructed us, fulfilled
[42:46] your word, and with wonderful results."
[42:50] And then will I profess unto them, I
[42:54] never knew you. Depart from me, ye that
[42:57] work iniquity.
[43:00] Ye that work iniquity.
[43:04] What?
[43:06] Just as Cain's offering was consistent
[43:08] with what would later be required. These
[43:12] being rejected in Jesus' sermon were
[43:14] doing the very things we are told we
[43:16] should be doing.
[43:19] Then will I profess unto them, I never
[43:21] knew you. Depart from me, ye that work
[43:25] iniquity.
[43:28] And the punishment is the same,
[43:31] separation from God. In Genesis 4:14,
[43:34] Cain said, "Behold, thou hast driven me
[43:36] out this day from the face of the earth,
[43:39] and from thy face shall I be hid."
[43:43] What's going on?
[43:46] How does it relate to our praise and
[43:48] worship today?
[43:53] I think we can refer back to our recent
[43:55] studies of David and Saul for the
[43:57] answer.
[43:59] In chapter 16 of First Samuel,
[44:02] Samuel has come to Jesse's town
[44:04] ostensibly to offer a sacrifice. In
[44:07] reality, it's to anoint a king to
[44:10] succeed Saul. Samuel was afraid to go
[44:13] because he and Saul were not getting
[44:15] along very well. And the Lord said,
[44:17] "Well, go and offer a sacrifice. Use
[44:19] that as a cover story.
[44:22] The town's people are nervous. Ask him
[44:24] if he's come in peace.
[44:27] And Samuel said peaceibly, I have come
[44:31] to sacrifice unto the Lord. Sanctify,
[44:34] wash, cleanse yourselves, and come with
[44:37] me to the sacrifice.
[44:39] And Samuel sanctified Jesse and his sons
[44:43] and called them to the sacrifice.
[44:46] And it came to pass when Jesse and his
[44:49] sons were come that Samuel looked on
[44:51] Jesse's oldest son Eliab and said,
[44:56] "Probably to himself, surely the Lord's
[44:59] anointed is before him."
[45:02] Now the key.
[45:04] But the Lord said unto Samuel,
[45:07] "Look not on his countenance,
[45:10] or on the height of his stature, because
[45:13] I have refused him. For the Lord seeth
[45:16] not as man seeth, for man lookth on the
[45:20] outward appearance. That's a nice grain
[45:23] offering there, Cain. But the Lord looks
[45:27] on the heart.
[45:29] Looks on the heart.
[45:36] Now you recognize this. It's from the
[45:38] title slide. I've outlined the last word
[45:41] in verse seven. Lelay lav
[45:44] on the heart. And in this variant of the
[45:47] word lev which means heart in this case
[45:51] it means the inner man, the mind, the
[45:56] will,
[45:57] the heart.
[46:00] I
[46:03] I've been linking prayer, praise, and
[46:06] worship with Gary Chapman's book on the
[46:07] five love languages. You you may recall
[46:10] for a relationship with the Lord quality
[46:12] time is represented by prayer.
[46:16] Words of affirmation by praise. Last
[46:19] time we saw acts of service through our
[46:22] serving one another in love.
[46:26] Tonight sacrifices and offerings can
[46:29] represent God receiving or not receiving
[46:33] our gifts.
[46:36] When Cain offered to the Lord, the Lord
[46:39] looked beyond the gift and saw Cain's
[46:41] heart.
[46:43] It was the condition of his heart that
[46:45] caused the Lord to reject his offering,
[46:48] his gift. We would say it was insincere,
[46:52] looked good, came from the wrong motive.
[46:57] Why was Samuel looking for Saul's
[46:59] successor?
[47:02] Let's go back a moment to to 1st Samuel
[47:04] 15.
[47:07] Why, brother Ly, we talked about David
[47:09] and Saul before. Why are we doing this
[47:11] again? Because it ties into praise and
[47:14] worship, sacrifice and offering, and
[47:17] their importance.
[47:20] Samuel came to Gilgal where Saul and his
[47:22] army were celebrating after a campaign
[47:25] to destroy one of their enemies, the
[47:27] Amalachites. Solomon had given explicit
[47:30] instructions about this campaign by the
[47:32] Lord through the prophet Samuel. He was
[47:35] told to wipe them out. It's hard for us
[47:38] to grasp this sort of a command, but he
[47:40] was told to wipe them out. Kill all of
[47:42] them, including their animals. Just get
[47:45] rid of them. The enemy and all their
[47:48] livestock was to be killed.
[47:52] Saul only partially obeyed. And Samuel
[47:55] scolded him.
[47:56] Saul just didn't understand.
[48:00] And Samuel came to Saul. And Saul said
[48:03] unto him, "Blessed be thou with the
[48:05] Lord. I performed the commandment of the
[48:08] Lord." Hallelujah, Samuel. Welcome.
[48:13] And Samuel said,
[48:15] "What meanth then this bleeting of the
[48:18] sheep in my ears, and the loing of the
[48:21] oxen which I hear?"
[48:24] And Saul said, "They, not we, they have
[48:30] brought them from the Amalachites, for
[48:32] the people spared the best of the sheep
[48:34] and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the
[48:37] Lord thy God, and the rest we've utterly
[48:40] destroyed."
[48:44] Samuel said to Saul,
[48:46] "Hold on. Stay. Give me a moment.
[48:50] I will tell you what the Lord hath said
[48:52] to me this night.
[48:56] And King Saul said to Samuel, "Say on. I
[49:00] can't wait to hear. The Lord spoke to
[49:02] you. You've come. We're celebrating a
[49:05] great victory which the Lord gave us.
[49:07] Tell me, Samuel. Tell me."
[49:10] And Samuel said,
[49:13] "When thou was little in thine own
[49:15] sight,
[49:17] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[49:20] of Israel? And the Lord anointed thee
[49:23] king over Israel?"
[49:26] And the Lord sent thee on a journey,
[49:30] and said, "Go and utterly destroy the
[49:33] sinners, the Amalachites. Fight against
[49:36] them until they be consumed.
[49:41] Why then did you not obey the voice of
[49:44] the Lord, but flew on the spoil, the
[49:47] plunder the goods, and did evil in the
[49:50] sight of the Lord?
[49:53] And Saul said unto Samuel,
[49:58] I have obeyed the voice of the Lord.
[50:00] I've gone the way the Lord sent me, have
[50:02] brought Aag, the king of Amalcch, and
[50:04] have utterly destroyed the Amalachites.
[50:07] the the the people took of the plunder
[50:10] of sheep and oxen, the chief of the
[50:12] things which should have been utterly
[50:13] destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy
[50:16] God in Gilgal.
[50:18] You see, Samuel, we're in the process of
[50:21] completing the task. And we're not just
[50:23] killing the best animals, but offering
[50:26] them as a sacrifice to the Lord. And
[50:30] here you are, the prophet, to do the
[50:32] sacrifices that ought to be done. Isn't
[50:33] this wonderful? Praise God, Samuel.
[50:36] What's wrong?
[50:40] And Samuel
[50:41] realizing Saul didn't get it, said
[50:46] hath the Lord his great delight
[50:49] and burnt offerings and sacrifices,
[50:52] which by this time were required, as in
[50:55] obeying the voice of the Lord.
[51:00] Behold, to obey is better than
[51:03] sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat
[51:06] of rams.
[51:08] Remember the meaning of worship,
[51:11] submission, complete submission by free
[51:14] will choice.
[51:16] Behold, Saul, to obey is better than
[51:20] sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat
[51:23] of rams. For rebellion,
[51:26] disobedience,
[51:28] making excuses,
[51:30] inserting your own will is as the sin of
[51:34] witchcraft,
[51:35] stubbornness is as iniquity and
[51:40] idolatry.
[51:42] Saul, I pleaded with the Lord all night.
[51:45] He's firm in his dep displeasure. He's
[51:48] told me that because thou hast rejected
[51:50] the word of the Lord, he hath also
[51:53] rejected thee from being king.
[52:00] Saul's incomplete obedience to the Lord
[52:02] didn't condemn him to hell. Later,
[52:04] Samuel told Saul he'd be with him. But
[52:08] incomplete obedience to the Lord cost
[52:10] him blessings in this life.
[52:15] God looks on the heart.
[52:18] As a result in Eden, he rejected Cain's
[52:21] offering, his gift. Here he had asked
[52:24] Saul to destroy something. Saul decided
[52:27] to offer it as a sacrifice to God. God
[52:29] rejected it. The worship God wanted was
[52:34] submission. The gift God wanted was
[52:38] obedience.
[52:45] Brother Random talked about this. He
[52:48] explained it as motive and objective.
[52:51] Why? Why are you doing what you're
[52:52] doing? What are you trying to achieve?
[52:55] And in power of transformation, he said
[52:58] always check out your motives and
[52:59] objectives if it's according to the word
[53:01] of God. If it isn't, leave it alone.
[53:04] See, but if it's with the word of God
[53:06] and lines up with the word of God, then
[53:09] you hold on to that. A month later, he
[53:11] said,
[53:13] but first, you see, your motives and
[53:15] objectives has to be right. You have to
[53:18] have reasons for this. God don't give
[53:20] you those things just because you ask.
[53:23] And you cannot ask in faith unless
[53:25] there's a real objective to that to to
[53:27] be in the will of God. You see, if you
[53:30] want to be well, what do you want to be
[53:32] well for? See, if you want to be healed,
[53:35] what's the reason you want to be healed?
[53:38] What are you telling God? What do you
[53:41] want to do with your life when you get
[53:42] healed? See, there's got to be you've
[53:45] got to have a motive and objective. And
[53:47] they have to be right according to the
[53:49] will of God. And then when faith is
[53:52] revealed to you, God by his sovereign
[53:55] grace places that faith in there. Then
[53:57] it's over. You see,
[54:03] so it's not just what you do that is
[54:07] important or what you need or want, but
[54:12] why,
[54:14] what's in your heart.
[54:18] At the end of his ministry,
[54:20] the last week in Jerusalem, Jesus is
[54:23] speaking to the local leaders, not about
[54:26] them, to others. Did you see what this
[54:28] guy did? But to them, he's saying a
[54:32] reduced version of what brother Daniel
[54:34] covered Sunday from the sermon on the
[54:35] mount. In Matthew 23:27, he's speaking.
[54:39] Let's let's listen in.
[54:43] Woe unto you scribes, Pharisees,
[54:47] hypocrites. The word hypocrite means
[54:50] actor. He's calling them pretenders,
[54:53] insincere.
[54:54] For
[54:56] ye are like white and supplers, which
[54:58] indeed appear beautiful outward, but are
[55:01] within full of dead men's bones, and of
[55:04] all uncleanness.
[55:06] These people that was very important to
[55:08] them to be ceremonially clean.
[55:11] You're full of uncleanness. Even so, ye
[55:15] also outwardly appear righteous unto
[55:18] men,
[55:20] but within
[55:22] ye are full of hypocrisy
[55:25] and iniquity.
[55:29] These men that he's speaking to, they
[55:31] knew the scriptures. They realized he
[55:34] was comparing them to David's enemies.
[55:39] Jesus was not making friends here. Psalm
[55:42] 59 we read, "For there is no
[55:45] faithfulness in their mouth. Their
[55:47] inward part is very wickedness. Their
[55:51] throat is an open seeler. They flatter
[55:55] with their tongue."
[55:58] And this isn't just a focus on the laws
[56:01] of the Old Testament. Jesus made it
[56:04] clear this applies to his followers as
[56:07] well.
[56:09] In Mark 16, we read of the final
[56:11] commission of Jesus to his disciples. We
[56:15] call it the great commission.
[56:17] This is Mark's uh account of the great
[56:20] commission. Jesus said unto them, "Go ye
[56:23] into all the world. Preach the gospel to
[56:26] every creature. He that believes and is
[56:29] baptized shall be saved. He that
[56:33] believeth not shall be damned."
[56:36] And these signs shall follow them that
[56:41] believe.
[56:42] In my name shall they cast out devils.
[56:46] They shall speak with new tongues. They
[56:49] shall take up serpents. If they drink
[56:52] any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
[56:54] them. They shall lay hands on the sick,
[56:57] and they shall recover
[57:01] in my name. They shall cast out devils,
[57:04] preach the gospel. Let's reread from
[57:06] Matthew 7 sermon on the mount. Again,
[57:09] Jesus speaking of the final judgment in
[57:11] the closing statements of that sermon.
[57:15] Many,
[57:17] many,
[57:18] we must be careful. Many will say to me
[57:21] in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
[57:26] prophesied in thy name? In thy name have
[57:29] cast out devils and in thy name done
[57:32] many wonderful works? We did exactly as
[57:35] you instructed us with wonderful
[57:37] results. Oh, we're so happy. Thank you,
[57:41] Jesus.
[57:42] And then will I profess to them, I never
[57:46] knew you. Depart from me, ye that work
[57:50] iniquity.
[57:53] Iniquity.
[57:55] We did exactly as you said.
[57:58] [Music]
[57:59] But why did you prophesy and do these
[58:02] things? What was in your heart? What
[58:05] were your motives? What were your
[58:07] objectives? Again, it ties in perfectly
[58:10] with last Sunday morning's lesson from
[58:11] Matthew 5, two weeks ago on worship,
[58:14] serving God by serving one another.
[58:16] Matthew 25 starting at verse 31.
[58:24] when the son of man now this is Jesus
[58:27] he's talking about himself in the third
[58:29] person third person is a perspective in
[58:32] English grammar not as in trinity when
[58:36] the son of man shall come in his glory
[58:39] and all the holy angels with him then
[58:42] shall he sit upon the throne of his
[58:44] glory
[58:48] Jesus is speaking of himself
[58:53] Let me read it in the first person. It
[58:55] it may have a bit more impact.
[58:58] When I shall come in my glory and all
[59:01] the holy angels with me, then shall I
[59:04] sit upon the throne of my glory, and
[59:07] before me shall be gathered all nations,
[59:09] not political entities as we think of
[59:11] nations, but all peoples, all races. And
[59:15] I shall separate them one from another,
[59:17] as a shepherd divides his sheep from the
[59:20] goats.
[59:22] And I shall set the sheep on my right
[59:24] hand, but the goats on my left. Then
[59:27] shall I say unto them on my right hand,
[59:30] come ye blessed of my father, inherit
[59:34] the kingdom prepared from you from the
[59:36] foundation of the world.
[59:38] And he'll recount some of what they did.
[59:41] For
[59:43] for I was hungry and you gave me food. I
[59:48] was thirsty, you gave me drink. I was a
[59:52] stranger and you welcomed me. You took
[59:54] me in. Naked and you clothed me. I was
[59:59] sick and you visited me. I was in prison
[1:00:02] and you came to me.
[1:00:06] And then shall the righteous answer me,
[1:00:09] saying,
[1:00:11] Lord,
[1:00:13] when did we see you hungry and feed you?
[1:00:16] Or see you thirsty and give you
[1:00:19] something to drink? When did we see you
[1:00:22] a a stranger and took you in or or naked
[1:00:26] and clothed you? Or or when did we see
[1:00:28] you sick or in prison and came unto
[1:00:30] thee?
[1:00:34] And I, having looked on their hearts,
[1:00:37] having evaluated their motives and
[1:00:39] objectives,
[1:00:41] shall answer from my throne,
[1:00:44] and say unto them, verily I say unto
[1:00:47] you, in as much as ye have done it unto
[1:00:50] one,
[1:00:52] how many?
[1:00:54] One, even just one of the least of these
[1:00:59] my brethren, you have done it unto me.
[1:01:05] Then shall I say also to them on the
[1:01:07] left hand, "Depart from me, ye cursed,
[1:01:10] into everlasting fire prepared for the
[1:01:12] devil and his angels, for I was hungry.
[1:01:17] You didn't give me any food. I was
[1:01:19] thirsty.
[1:01:20] You did nothing to slake my thirst. I
[1:01:23] was a stranger. You didn't welcome me.
[1:01:26] You weren't friendly. You didn't even
[1:01:27] say hello. I was naked.
[1:01:31] You didn't give me any clothing. I was
[1:01:33] sick. I was in prison. You ignored me.
[1:01:35] You didn't visit me.
[1:01:39] Then shall they also answer me, saying,
[1:01:43] Lord,
[1:01:44] when did we see you hungry or or thirsty
[1:01:47] or or a stranger or naked or sick or in
[1:01:49] prison and and did not minister unto
[1:01:51] you? If we'd known you were there, Lord,
[1:01:54] we of course would have done this for
[1:01:55] you. We didn't see you in these
[1:01:58] circumstances.
[1:02:00] What are you talking about, Lord?
[1:02:05] Then I shall answer them, saying, verily
[1:02:08] I say unto you, in as much as you did it
[1:02:11] not to one of the least,
[1:02:14] the least of these, you did it not to
[1:02:18] me.
[1:02:20] In other words, in love, serve one
[1:02:24] another.
[1:02:26] and these shall go away unto everlasting
[1:02:29] punishment, but the righteous unto life
[1:02:33] eternal.
[1:02:36] It's pretty clear, I think, what we do
[1:02:38] is certainly important, but why we do it
[1:02:42] is more important.
[1:02:45] What's in our heart? What is our
[1:02:48] foundation for doing these things?
[1:02:53] Jesus told us.
[1:02:55] What did he say about this when he was
[1:02:57] challenged again during his final week
[1:02:59] in Jerusalem? We read in Mark 12,
[1:03:06] "And one of the scribes came and having
[1:03:09] heard Jesus and the Sadducees reasoning
[1:03:12] together, and perceiving that Jesus had
[1:03:15] answered the Sadducees well,
[1:03:18] asked him,
[1:03:21] "Which is the first the the greatest
[1:03:23] commandment of all? We've got over 600
[1:03:26] commandments. Which is the greatest?
[1:03:32] Jesus answered him.
[1:03:34] The first of the commandments is here, O
[1:03:39] Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,
[1:03:44] and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:03:48] with all thy heart, with all thy soul,
[1:03:51] with all thy mind, with all thy
[1:03:54] strength.
[1:03:56] This is the first commandment.
[1:04:00] And the second, even though you're not
[1:04:02] asking me, I'm going to tell you. The
[1:04:04] second is similar. It's namely this.
[1:04:07] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[1:04:12] There is none other commandment
[1:04:17] greater than these.
[1:04:21] Matthew adds a statement by Jesus in
[1:04:23] this conversation that Mark didn't
[1:04:26] include. Matthew 22,
[1:04:29] on these two commandments hang all the
[1:04:33] law and the prophets. The amplified
[1:04:37] version says it this way.
[1:04:39] These two commandments sum up and upon
[1:04:43] them depend all the law and the
[1:04:48] prophets.
[1:04:51] all of it.
[1:04:53] In other words, this is the foundation
[1:04:56] of the entire Old Testament, indeed of
[1:04:58] the whole Bible.
[1:05:00] And have you noticed
[1:05:03] these two commandments
[1:05:05] are not part of the Ten Commandments?
[1:05:08] The Ten Commandments
[1:05:11] are not as important as these two.
[1:05:13] That's what Jesus just said. Though the
[1:05:16] first one is implied, you can't just
[1:05:18] skim the headlines, depend on sound
[1:05:21] bites to understand things. You need
[1:05:24] what Paul Harvey, those of you that are
[1:05:26] really old like me, know who Paul Harvey
[1:05:28] was. Paul Harvey used to call the rest
[1:05:30] of the story.
[1:05:32] Well, continuing
[1:05:35] and and the scribe said unto Jesus,
[1:05:38] "Well, master, meaning teacher,
[1:05:42] you've said the truth, for there is one
[1:05:46] God.
[1:05:47] There's none other but he. And to love
[1:05:50] him with all the heart, with all the
[1:05:54] understanding, with all the soul, with
[1:05:58] all the strength,
[1:06:00] and to love his neighbor as himself
[1:06:04] is more than all whole burnt offerings
[1:06:06] and sacrifices. This is taking place in
[1:06:09] the temple court where they're doing
[1:06:11] those very sacrifices.
[1:06:14] The motive is more important
[1:06:18] than the action.
[1:06:22] And when Jesus saw, he answered
[1:06:23] discreetly. Jesus said unto the scribe,
[1:06:27] "Thou are not far from the kingdom of
[1:06:29] God.
[1:06:31] No man after that dared to ask him any
[1:06:33] questions." They stopped challenging
[1:06:36] him.
[1:06:39] Worship is submission. Now, one does not
[1:06:43] have to love Vladimir Putin to submit to
[1:06:46] his rule if you're in Russia. You don't
[1:06:49] have to love the Ayatollah in Iran to
[1:06:52] submit to him. You can legislate
[1:06:55] submission. You can generally force
[1:06:58] obedience,
[1:06:59] but you can't legislate love.
[1:07:04] God wants the gift of our obedience, but
[1:07:08] he really wants is for that obedience to
[1:07:12] be based not on fear of reprisal, not on
[1:07:16] legislation or law, but on fervent love
[1:07:22] toward him.
[1:07:25] Back to our verses, love God, love your
[1:07:29] neighbor.
[1:07:31] The first and greatest commandment is
[1:07:34] known as the schma.
[1:07:36] Schma is a Hebrew word. Its form is an
[1:07:39] imperative. It's a command. It means
[1:07:42] listen. It means hear. It It's found in
[1:07:46] Deuteronomy 6
[1:07:49] verse four. Here, O Israel,
[1:07:53] the Lord our God is one Lord.
[1:07:58] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:08:01] with all thine heart, and with all thy
[1:08:04] soul. What? What does that mean? All thy
[1:08:08] soul. The word translated soul means
[1:08:12] entire being,
[1:08:14] life,
[1:08:16] desire,
[1:08:18] appetite,
[1:08:20] emotion,
[1:08:21] passion,
[1:08:23] with all thy might,
[1:08:26] strength, resources,
[1:08:29] abundance.
[1:08:34] In in Hebrew, Schma Israel, they don't
[1:08:37] ever say the word Yahweh. They say
[1:08:39] either Adoni,
[1:08:41] Lord, or Hashem, the name Adonai, Elohu,
[1:08:45] Adonai, Aad,
[1:08:50] love the Lord thy God. The way it's
[1:08:52] written in the Hebrew, love here is an
[1:08:55] action.
[1:08:56] It's a word that requires an object, we
[1:08:59] call a direct object, like throw the
[1:09:01] ball, right? It has a direct object. The
[1:09:04] object of your active love is to be the
[1:09:08] Lord your God.
[1:09:11] And if you in fact love him this way,
[1:09:13] what will you do?
[1:09:16] And these words which I command thee
[1:09:18] this day shall be in thine smartphone in
[1:09:21] your pocket.
[1:09:23] No, not on your eye stone, an amulet on
[1:09:27] your neck or your wrist. No, no, in your
[1:09:30] very heart.
[1:09:33] And thou shalt teach them haphazardly
[1:09:38] diligently unto thy children, and shalt
[1:09:42] talk of them from time to time. No, no.
[1:09:44] Shall talk of them when thou sitest in
[1:09:46] thine house, when thou walst by the way,
[1:09:50] when thou liest down, when thou riseest
[1:09:53] up.
[1:09:55] When I was reading that, I was reminded
[1:09:58] of something from my past. when thou
[1:10:00] riseest up. I've talked before when I
[1:10:03] lived in Israel a half century ago. Joe
[1:10:06] was there.
[1:10:10] This is an Egod bus that they they were
[1:10:13] the main bus company in in Israel. And
[1:10:15] that's the nearest I could find of a
[1:10:17] picture of one from 1975 when I was
[1:10:20] riding those buses. Yeah, we had buses
[1:10:22] in 1975. They had wheels and we had fuel
[1:10:26] and stuff for those of you that may
[1:10:28] think that it's really ancient. Well,
[1:10:31] I'd ride the bus from Natana where we
[1:10:33] lived to Tel Aviv in the south, then
[1:10:37] transfer to an LL workers bus to go to
[1:10:39] Bengurion airport where I worked for LL
[1:10:42] Israel Airlines.
[1:10:45] During a ride from Natana to Tel Aviv
[1:10:47] about 20 miles around 6 or 6:30 in the
[1:10:50] morning, Cole Israel, Voice of Israel is
[1:10:54] what that means. It's it's the national
[1:10:56] radio network. They didn't run radio
[1:10:58] stations 24 hours a day. They turn them
[1:11:00] off late at night and then at this 6 or
[1:11:02] 6:30 in the morning, they would come on
[1:11:04] the air when thou rise the stump. And
[1:11:08] there was a recording that would always
[1:11:10] be played every morning.
[1:11:13] And it was the singing of the Schma
[1:11:18] played at high volume on the radio with
[1:11:21] the bus.
[1:11:23] Israel. Hashem Elohu. Hashem Elohu.
[1:11:28] Hashem.
[1:11:30] Shma is
[1:11:33] Hashem. Elohu.
[1:11:35] [Music]
[1:11:36] Hashem. Hashem. Eloh.
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:41] Hashem.
[1:11:43] I don't do it justice, but it was
[1:11:45] lively. It was It It woke you up.
[1:11:50] Sung with joy. uplifting. Well,
[1:11:54] continuing on with the scripture, moving
[1:11:56] up 50 years to today,
[1:11:59] and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[1:12:02] thine hand, and they shall be as
[1:12:05] frontlets between thine eyes, and thou
[1:12:08] shalt write them upon the posts of thy
[1:12:11] house and on thy gates.
[1:12:14] It just isn't about Sunday or or
[1:12:17] Wednesday evening. It's about all
[1:12:20] aspects of our lives.
[1:12:24] And what of our neighbor?
[1:12:27] We turn to Leviticus 19.
[1:12:32] And thou shalt not avenge nor bear any
[1:12:35] grudge against the children of thy
[1:12:37] people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:12:40] as thyself.
[1:12:43] I am the Lord. I ask the musicians to to
[1:12:47] please return.
[1:12:49] Jesus would later expand the definition
[1:12:52] of neighbor beyond those of your tribe
[1:12:54] or clan or people through the parable of
[1:12:56] the good Samaritan.
[1:12:59] Samaritan, a despised neighbor who went
[1:13:02] of his way, went out of his way to help
[1:13:06] one who likely despised him.
[1:13:10] Our closing verses are from a place near
[1:13:12] the end of the sermon on the mount,
[1:13:15] Matthew 7.
[1:13:18] Therefore, all things whatsoever ye
[1:13:20] would that men should do to you, do ye
[1:13:23] even so to them. For this is the law and
[1:13:26] the prophets.
[1:13:30] This is the law and the prophets
[1:13:34] that's built on that foundation of love
[1:13:38] of God and love of neighbor. The
[1:13:39] amplified version reads like this. So
[1:13:42] then when whatever you desire that
[1:13:45] others would do to and for you, even so,
[1:13:50] do also to and for them. For this is
[1:13:54] this sums up the law and the prophets.
[1:14:00] In love,
[1:14:02] serve one another. By this will all men
[1:14:06] know that you're my disciples.
[1:14:09] Be certain that service is built on a
[1:14:12] foundation of love in your heart for the
[1:14:14] Lord
[1:14:16] and for your neighbor.
[1:14:19] Let let's worship him now. Offer him our
[1:14:22] hearts. Please stand with me.
[1:14:25] Just two songs that I'd like to sing
[1:14:27] before we turn it over to our pastor.
[1:14:31] The first one being I give you my heart.
[1:14:41] This this is my desire
[1:14:46] to honor
[1:14:48] you,
[1:14:51] Lord, with all my heart.
[1:14:54] I worship you.
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:01] All I have within me,
[1:15:05] I give you praise.
[1:15:10] All that I adore
[1:15:14] is in you,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Lord. I give you my heart. I give you my
[1:15:24] soul.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; I live for you alone. Every breath that
[1:15:31] I take, every moment I'm awake,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, have your way in me. Let's try it
[1:15:40] again.
[1:15:44] This is my desire
[1:15:48] to honor
[1:15:51] you,
[1:15:53] Lord, with all my heart.
[1:15:57] I worship you.
[1:16:02] All I have within me,
[1:16:07] I give you praise.
[1:16:12] All that I adore
[1:16:16] is in you,
[1:16:19] [Music]
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Lord. I give you my heart. I give you my
[1:16:25] soul.
[1:16:27] I live for you alone. Every breath that
[1:16:32] I take, every moment I'm away.
[1:16:37] Lord, have your way in me.
[1:16:43] If he does have his way, what will
[1:16:46] happen?
[1:16:48] What will our desire be? I think one of
[1:16:51] them will be that we want to live the
[1:16:54] way he wants us to live.
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Let's start with the chorus.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; I want to live
[1:17:09] the way
[1:17:11] he wants me to live.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; I want to give
[1:17:20] until there's just no more
[1:17:25] to give.
[1:17:26] I want to love
[1:17:30] love till there's just no more love.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; I could never
[1:17:40] never out love the Lord.
[1:17:48] There have been times
[1:17:51] when giving
[1:17:54] and loving
[1:17:56] brought pain.
[1:17:58] And I promised
[1:18:01] that I'd never
[1:18:03] let it happen
[1:18:06] again.
[1:18:09] But I found out that loving
[1:18:14] is well worth the risk
[1:18:19] and that even
[1:18:22] in losing
[1:18:25] you win.
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:29] I want to live
[1:18:32] the way
[1:18:35] he wants me to give. I want to give
[1:18:43] until there's just no more to give.
[1:18:50] I want to love
[1:18:54] love till there's just no more love.
[1:19:00] I could never
[1:19:03] never out love the Lord.
[1:19:10] He showed He showed us that only
[1:19:16] through dying
[1:19:18] we live.
[1:19:20] And he gave
[1:19:23] when it seemed
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; there was nothing
[1:19:29] to give.
[1:19:31] He loved
[1:19:34] when loving
[1:19:36] brought heartache
[1:19:39] and loss.
[1:19:41] He forave
[1:19:44] from an old rugged
[1:19:47] cross.
[1:19:51] I want to live
[1:19:54] the way
[1:19:56] he wants me to live.
[1:20:01] I want to give
[1:20:04] until there's just no more
[1:20:09] to give. I want to love
[1:20:15] love till there's just no. That was one
[1:20:19] of my
[1:20:24] ever
