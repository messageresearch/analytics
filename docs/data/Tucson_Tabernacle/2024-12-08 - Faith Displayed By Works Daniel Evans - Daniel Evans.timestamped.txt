[0:09] in all our
[0:12] sins till Jesus touched This Heart of
[0:15] Mine gave me life
[0:20] again I am just a house of
[0:23] clay ever since that blessed

[1:40] house he's in the house amen
[1:43] Amen brother Josiah
[1:46] mentioned that the Lord is here he's
[1:50] right here I thought about the word
[1:52] omnipresence and omnipresent and we
[1:54] ascribe that to the Lord that he's
[1:57] everywhere and I searched there in the
[1:59] Bible and I don't think that word
[2:01] exactly is there in the Bible but there
[2:03] was another one of omni and I just
[2:06] thought that this was a good thing to
[2:08] think on this morning Revelations 19:
[2:11] 5-7 says and a voice came out of the
[2:13] throne saying praise our God all ye his
[2:17] servants and ye that fear Him both small
[2:20] and great I think all of us can say some
[2:22] of us may feel like we're small some
[2:24] might feel in our own way great but we
[2:27] can all say both small and great can
[2:29] Praise Him and I heard as it were V the
[2:32] voice of a great multitude as the voice
[2:35] of many Waters and as the voice of
[2:38] Mighty thundering saying Allelujah for
[2:41] the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be
[2:44] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[2:47] for the marriage of the Lamb is come and
[2:49] his wife hath made herself ready amen we
[2:52] just want to be ready for his soon
[2:54] coming amen we have a few prayer
[2:56] requests turned in this morning brother

[3:30] can make known an unspoken need with an
[3:32] uplifted hand let's go to the Lord in
[3:34] prayer this morning Lord as we just read
[3:37] Lord in your word you're omnipotent Lord
[3:41] the dictionary I think says that means
[3:43] all powerful Lord and it said it it

[3:47] know that you're all powerful to be able
[3:49] to take care of every need that we have

[3:55] Delight thyself in the Lord and you will
[3:57] give us the desires of our heart Lord so

[22:55] is
[22:59] Stephen we're we're we're uh we're a bit
[23:01] short on the Jean Pool on the top of our
[23:03] head but we make up for it in our facial
[23:06] hair God bless you brother um Stephen is
[23:10] is a is a hero he's a war veteran from
[23:13] the Iraq War and and's he's been around
[23:16] the world fighting for our country and
[23:20] uh and fighting for the def defense of
[23:22] our country now he's retired but brother
[23:25] Stephen it's it's no longer your job
[23:29] to fight for the defense of our country
[23:31] but now brother it's time to fight for
[23:33] the Salvation of our
[23:35] country
[23:39] yeah I always admired someone that has
[23:42] served in the armed forces and served
[23:44] our country and uh Stephen and and his
[23:47] his brother have are really they are
[23:50] they're war heroes they were in the
[23:52] thick of it and I always admired that
[23:56] and now I feel that
[23:59] Lord let me be on a
[24:01] battlefield and not so much the
[24:03] battlefield of flesh and blood but the
[24:06] battlefield of this gospel saving Souls
[24:10] winning souls to the Lord Jesus and
[24:13] that's that's the battle that I want to
[24:15] be fighting and I am going to Stephen
[24:17] I'm going to be a warrior in that battle
[24:20] until the day I die by the grace of God
[24:23] and you need to also my brother win
[24:26] those Souls take that that servitude
[24:29] that you did for our country and now
[24:31] place it into something that's more
[24:32] important this country is going to fail
[24:35] eventually but this gospel will never
[24:38] fail brothers and sisters if we can
[24:40] fight for for the Salvation of a soul
[24:42] for the Salvation of this country it'll
[24:45] never
[24:46] end and the progress that we make will
[24:49] be for all
[24:50] eternity what a what a
[24:53] thought and we're on the battlefield
[24:55] every day for the kingdom of God the
[24:58] Kingdom of Heaven winning winning souls
[25:02] and and showing them that Jesus Christ
[25:06] is alive he's not just alive in this
[25:09] book but he's alive right here in me I
[25:14] want I want to show everywhere I go I
[25:16] want to say you want to meet the Lord
[25:19] Jesus I have his
[25:21] spirit I want to represent him every
[25:24] place every time I want to and I want to
[25:27] lift him up I believe as we get into
[25:30] this book of James as we get further in
[25:32] that was James's that was his calling
[25:36] that's that's what he did and he did a
[25:37] great job at it remember
[25:40] James doesn't say he was an
[25:44] apostle James was a pastor and he was
[25:49] pastor of this church in Jerusalem he
[25:51] was really the first Christian Pastor
[25:53] that we know of of a church besides the
[25:55] Lord Jesus of course but James was this
[25:58] pastor in
[26:00] and the First Christian Church and the
[26:04] first pastor and you can see as you read
[26:08] through his gospel his his epistle that
[26:13] he addressed things a little bit
[26:15] different than say Paul did and say
[26:17] Peter did he was also he's the half
[26:21] brother of the Lord Jesus so he had some
[26:25] credentials back there and boy did did
[26:28] he make bold statements James he he said
[26:33] some things that that really challenged
[26:36] the people he wasn't like Paul where he
[26:38] was bringing Jesus Christ out of the
[26:41] scriptures and saying now now give your
[26:43] life to him James is is saying hey
[26:46] you've already given your life to Christ
[26:48] you've already become a Christian you're
[26:50] familiar with all of the law and all the
[26:53] prophets and everything that Moses
[26:54] taught now step it up in your life and
[26:57] that was James it's it's tough it it is
[27:01] a tough book probably of all the
[27:04] Epistles this one is the most pointed
[27:08] and the most corrective and it's because
[27:11] he was a pastor Not only was he
[27:14] preaching to his church in this epistle
[27:17] but he's sending this out to all of the
[27:19] Jews that were similar to the people in
[27:21] his congregation and and he's telling
[27:24] all of them hey you know you've accepted
[27:27] Christ that's good now step it up in
[27:29] your life and put to work what he
[27:32] said James let's let's do a little
[27:34] review James chapter 1 verse 19 it says
[27:38] this and this is really the theme of
[27:41] James the second part of James chapter 2
[27:43] so we started a few weeks ago was James
[27:44] chapter 1 we got through that one then
[27:47] uh two weeks ago we started in James
[27:49] chapter 2 and we got about halfway
[27:51] through and if the Lord's willing I'd
[27:53] like to finish James chapter 2 today but
[27:56] a little background James chapter 1:
[27:59] 19 James says this wherefore my beloved
[28:02] Brethren let every man be swift to hear
[28:07] slow to speak and slow to wrath if we
[28:10] could we could just stop right there and
[28:13] say
[28:14] yeah that's the one brother Daniel just
[28:16] stop right there and let's just have
[28:18] devote the rest of the service to that
[28:20] but but that's next week we're gonna
[28:22] we're going to tackle that one next week
[28:24] for the wrath of man worketh not right
[28:26] the righteousness of God
[28:28] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[28:31] superfluity of naughtiness it's
[28:33] overflowing wickedness and receive with
[28:36] meekness the engrafted word which is
[28:39] able to save your
[28:41] souls but be ye doers of the word and
[28:47] not hearers only deceiving your own
[28:49] selves for if any be a hearer of the
[28:52] word and not a doer he is like unto a
[28:54] man beholding his natural face in the
[28:56] glass for he beh holdeth himself and
[28:59] goeth his way and straight way he
[29:02] forgets what manner of man that he was
[29:06] so he's looking in the mirror maybe he's
[29:08] coming to church and he's saying no yeah
[29:10] I need to work on that and you feel
[29:12] really condemned and there's repentance
[29:14] and then you go away and pretty soon you
[29:19] forget the man that you saw in church
[29:22] and those sins that you said I'm going
[29:24] to repent of I'm going to do better
[29:26] those sins just slowly creep back into
[29:30] your life and you forget what you saw
[29:33] when you made a commitment to the Lord
[29:35] to change let's go back to that verse
[29:38] number 22 says but be ye hearers of the
[29:41] word doers of the word and not hearers
[29:43] only deceiving your own
[29:45] selves the NIV version says this do not
[29:49] merely listen to the
[29:52] word and so deceive yourselves do what
[29:56] it says
[30:00] and that's the theme for the second part
[30:03] of James chapter 2 so let's go to James
[30:05] chapter 2 verse 14 and we'll pick up
[30:08] where we left
[30:09] off what doth it profit my brethren
[30:13] though a man say he hath faith and have
[30:16] not works can Faith save him so he's
[30:20] saying what good is it to you to have
[30:22] faith if you don't do anything with this
[30:25] Faith what good is it to say that you
[30:27] have faith faith in God and you're not
[30:29] using the faith it's a very bold
[30:32] statement by James he's saying all of
[30:34] these quote
[30:37] Believers and he's saying listen Okay
[30:39] you believe but what are you doing with
[30:42] it it's question we need all ask
[30:47] ourselves and
[30:50] when the bad part of the hard part is so
[30:53] you say Lord I'm going to I'm going to
[30:55] change I'm going to I'm going to put
[30:57] this faith into action and then you
[31:00] start taking steps to be a doer of the
[31:03] word and not a hearer only and then man
[31:07] you open yourself up for
[31:09] criticism you open open yourself up for
[31:13] failure you open yourself up for all
[31:15] kinds of
[31:16] things but don't just sit there because
[31:20] James is condemning you for just sitting
[31:22] there he said go out and
[31:24] try it's like so many people
[31:29] are telling you how are telling the
[31:31] pastors here's how you should run your
[31:33] church here's how you should preach
[31:34] here's what here's the important topics
[31:37] and then it comes down to it it's like
[31:39] well wait
[31:40] brother when did you Pastor a
[31:43] church when when have you started a
[31:46] church and it was successful there a
[31:49] I've had people come to
[31:51] me time and time again and saying what
[31:55] are you
[31:56] doing you're preaching you're you're
[31:58] going back to this this B Bible and
[32:01] you're not preaching the Modern Day
[32:02] message and you're not doing all this
[32:04] and my my answer to them is well brother
[32:08] how many converts do you
[32:11] have and I asked this the other day to a
[32:14] friend how many people have you led to
[32:18] the Lord Jesus oh well
[32:21] um I don't know well you know I've
[32:25] witnessed to a lot of people I've
[32:27] witness to a lot of people but what good
[32:29] did it
[32:31] do where are the fruits of that witness
[32:35] I know this hits hard this is us it
[32:38] should be us all of us should be
[32:39] thinking you know what you know he's
[32:41] kind of right about this you know you're
[32:44] trying to trying to witness to people
[32:46] you're trying to maybe get them to think
[32:47] like
[32:48] you get them to believe like you get
[32:52] them as I say often to act like you to
[32:54] look like you and to just be a clone to
[32:57] you and what good does it do what good
[32:59] has it
[33:02] done and people are always they're
[33:04] they're really
[33:05] quick to point out the
[33:09] flaws and there's going to be flaws
[33:11] everywhere you look right here you're
[33:15] going to see plenty of flaws and you can
[33:16] see plenty of flaws with all of us but
[33:19] and so if you come in looking for those
[33:21] flaws you will find them there was a a
[33:23] brother that came here for a while he
[33:25] was coming here um
[33:28] really first class I I mean I really
[33:31] liked him and he was um he knew his
[33:34] scriptures excellent and he saw us on um
[33:38] on YouTube and and he started
[33:41] coming and he um made this statement he
[33:46] he started giving I mean he gave me
[33:48] plenty of accolades and and said you
[33:50] know I appreciate the pastor and how he
[33:51] preaches the Bible and how how he he
[33:53] just digs into this and it's just the
[33:55] word only for him it's just the Bible
[33:57] only for him well I came from a place
[33:59] that wasn't like that I came a from a
[34:01] place and it was a denomination but he
[34:03] called it a cult he says where they
[34:05] preached the denomination he said they
[34:07] preached the
[34:08] cult and he said but now he says I'm
[34:11] watching you all on YouTube and he says
[34:13] he says I'm coming here to church and he
[34:15] gave testimony to us and he said you he
[34:18] says this is great he said appreciate
[34:21] what you what you
[34:22] have and
[34:25] then he made a statement
[34:28] that you know the whole the there's a
[34:31] flag that goes up he made a statement
[34:33] and he said that I thought I was going
[34:35] to have to start my own
[34:38] church because I couldn't find a place
[34:41] to believe like me or that that took
[34:44] that put these things first forgot his
[34:46] exact words and I was like
[34:49] uh and then a little while
[34:53] later he comes and he starts one service
[34:57] he starts seeing negative he starts
[34:59] seeing things that were wrong he starts
[35:02] seeing things that were said
[35:04] wrong and
[35:06] and there was all that he could handle
[35:08] he got up and he stormed out of
[35:12] church and let me tell you something he
[35:16] was
[35:17] right he was right in some of the things
[35:20] that he was upset with but he had the
[35:23] wrong
[35:24] Spirit he was right in his Doctrine
[35:29] but he was wrong in his heart he was
[35:31] wrong in his
[35:33] spirit and he was and he left and and if
[35:37] if he would have just talked to me if I
[35:38] could have just got a hold of him and
[35:39] said brother listen you're right but let
[35:44] me let's let me show you where we need
[35:48] help but instead forget it I'm
[35:53] leaving but do you think maybe before
[35:56] you leave your church church and maybe
[35:58] the people on that that are streaming in
[36:00] or watch this video before you leave
[36:03] your church do you think maybe you
[36:04] should stop and say how can I help
[36:07] rather than just seeing all the problems
[36:09] and all the the the the stuff associated
[36:11] with it do you think maybe you say well
[36:13] Lord maybe I can help these people are
[36:15] the people more important or are your
[36:16] doctrines more
[36:18] important that's where it should
[36:24] be so before you before you leave
[36:28] your churches and go to another one
[36:30] don't be just looking for your next
[36:33] former
[36:35] Church make a difference in the church
[36:37] that you have now like like Stephen it's
[36:41] time to to get on the battlefield for
[36:44] God and you not you don't fight on the
[36:46] battlefield when there's no there's no
[36:48] enemy right you fight on the battlefield
[36:51] where there's an
[36:52] enemy so stay there work hard show your
[36:55] church show the people that love and and
[36:57] then maybe you might find out whoa whoa
[37:00] whoa actually I was
[37:01] wrong actually my attitude was
[37:04] wrong but when you have the attitude of
[37:07] serving then you'll have a different
[37:12] outcome it's uh there's
[37:16] um there was another
[37:19] guy um another critic of of everybody
[37:22] really and uh there's probably many of
[37:24] you were were in the service not here
[37:26] and he started he he was up there
[37:29] preaching and just really laying it down
[37:31] laying it down hard and I like that I
[37:32] don't have any problem with someone
[37:34] preaching against sin or or or um
[37:36] preaching against mistakes or anything
[37:38] like that wonderful praise the Lord I'm
[37:40] with you but he said he he was up there
[37:43] and he got excited and he said you know
[37:44] he says the people should be lined up
[37:47] outside your your church lined up
[37:49] waiting to be healed there should be
[37:50] hundreds of them lined up there just
[37:52] trying to get in so that they could come
[37:54] in and the Holy Spirit would be so
[37:56] strong and they would be healed
[37:58] man that sounds good that sounds really
[38:02] good but be doers of the
[38:04] word and not hear is only it just
[38:06] happened to know that he has about 20
[38:08] people in his
[38:09] church and it hasn't grown it's done
[38:11] nothing but
[38:12] shrank so
[38:14] brother why are you telling everyone
[38:19] else but they're not lined up at your
[38:22] church trying to get in to be healed
[38:25] what he said was good
[38:28] but show me the proof and that's what
[38:31] James is saying here he's like hey you
[38:35] talk about you talk about faith without
[38:38] your without works and I'll show you
[38:40] Faith by my
[38:43] works if
[38:46] I have a Ministry and you have a
[38:50] Ministry the best thing that you can do
[38:55] is that you can go to someone one and
[38:58] say Here's what the Lord did for me
[39:01] here's my life here's the changes in my
[39:05] life and you can have the same instead
[39:07] of pointing your finger at everybody
[39:09] saying you change you change you change
[39:10] and you need to do this you need to do
[39:11] all of that it's like whoa whoa whoa
[39:13] well I can look into your life and I can
[39:14] see all kinds of hypocrisy that's right
[39:17] just like this brother that was
[39:18] preaching that it's like wait a minute
[39:21] wait a minute that sounds good but
[39:25] they're not lined up outside of your
[39:26] church
[39:28] and if somebody's going to give me
[39:29] pastoral advice I want to see someone
[39:33] that has done it before I want to see
[39:36] someone that has been through it and
[39:39] that advi advice is something that I can
[39:42] really hold on to and it's all of us
[39:45] your personal testimony brothers and
[39:47] sisters mean means more than all of the
[39:50] words from the pulpit that that we could
[39:52] say I can preach this word and I can
[39:55] read this word but when this word really
[39:58] comes to life that is what our um
[40:03] brother here James is talking about
[40:06] verse number
[40:07] 14 what doth it profit my brethren
[40:10] though a man say he hath faith and have
[40:14] not works can Faith save him so you're a
[40:20] Christian where is your Christianity you
[40:22] tell everyone else how to live their
[40:24] lives but where is Christianity in your
[40:26] life Matthew believe it's Matthew 23
[40:29] Jesus talks about the Pharisees and he
[40:31] said listen he says do what they
[40:34] say because they're they're saying the
[40:36] truth but don't do what they
[40:39] do because they say and they do
[40:44] not the words of the Lord Jesus Matthew
[40:47] chapter 23 I believe it's verse one 2
[40:49] and
[40:53] three Christians kind they're they're
[40:57] supposed to be they're supposed to
[40:59] prefer the brother they're supposed to
[41:01] prefer their sister they're supposed to
[41:02] prefer their neighbors but if we are
[41:05] truly living where is your
[41:08] giving where is my giving where is your
[41:11] sacrifice so many people call themselves
[41:15] Christians and say I believe I believe I
[41:16] believe but they're just whistling what
[41:18] seems like whistling through this
[41:19] graveyard of life and they're not really
[41:22] putting into action if a brother or a
[41:25] sister be naked and destitute of daily
[41:28] food and one of you say unto them depart
[41:31] in peace and be ye warmed and filled and
[41:33] filled notwithstanding that you give
[41:35] them not those things which they are
[41:36] needful to the body what doth it profit
[41:40] them so this is 2,000 years ago where
[41:43] where there were people that were
[41:46] genuinely in need I think sometimes we
[41:48] give to those that um that are asking
[41:52] for and sometimes we enable them a
[41:54] little bit more this is a little bit of
[41:56] a different age we still should give to
[41:58] the poor we still should help but be
[41:59] selective in how we're doing it but here
[42:02] he's saying that that if you give if you
[42:05] someone that's asking for food or for a
[42:08] drink or for warmth and you don't give
[42:10] it to
[42:11] them but you just say so you're
[42:15] hungry hey um you're hungry you know
[42:19] what the deal is why don't you go get
[42:20] something to
[42:21] eat yeah thanks no problem you know
[42:24] that's that's good advice and that's
[42:26] what we do and that's what James is
[42:28] saying here he like oh you're hungry
[42:31] well go get something to eat they can't
[42:34] it's a whole reason they're
[42:36] hungry they need food and today it's
[42:40] it's a little bit different it's
[42:42] somebody might say I'm struggling you
[42:45] know I just can't get over I'm hooked on
[42:47] this or or I'm struggling with that and
[42:50] they say well you just got to believe in
[42:51] God brother you just got to have faith
[42:55] sister well yeah I I know
[42:59] that but help
[43:01] me encourage
[43:03] me take your time and give it to that
[43:09] person know you can't just say well you
[43:11] just need to
[43:12] believe most of the time in fact almost
[43:16] every time that's not going to do any
[43:17] good you think that person doesn't
[43:19] already know that they just need to
[43:22] believe help them encourage them take
[43:26] your time
[43:28] or get down on your knees and set aside
[43:31] all of the the distractions of the world
[43:34] and go before that person in in
[43:37] prayer in In fervent prayer Pray for
[43:41] that person you know you can tell them
[43:43] sometimes hey hey I'm praying for you
[43:46] are you
[43:48] really sometimes you don't even need to
[43:50] say
[43:51] it get down on your
[43:54] knees you see someone is is in
[43:58] need and go
[44:01] fervently to prayer for that person I
[44:03] told the story the other day that I was
[44:06] really down and I was really discouraged
[44:09] and it was just in my mind things were
[44:11] going around you know and I was I was
[44:13] frustrated with things and I was I think
[44:16] I was sitting in my den and I'm just
[44:19] struggling like like this is I don't
[44:22] want to do this and and and and very
[44:25] negative attitude and then all of a
[44:27] sudden it just left
[44:30] immediately and I sat back in my chair
[44:34] and I was encouraged literally one
[44:37] second I was discouraged and had a bad
[44:40] attitude the next second I was
[44:42] encouraged and saying we can do this and
[44:46] and and ready to go to
[44:48] battle and I I was thinking what just
[44:52] happened and I believe the Lord laid it
[44:54] on my heart someone Just prayed for
[44:59] you and God heard it and blessed me and
[45:04] the same thing with us don't just tell
[45:06] someone you're praying for them
[45:08] encourage them but do it don't just let
[45:13] it be words Let It Be
[45:16] Works Matthew chap
[45:19] 6:6 Jesus is talking about prayer and he
[45:21] says but thou when thou prayest enter
[45:23] into the
[45:24] closet a Greek word is is is your inner
[45:28] chamber go into a private
[45:32] place and when thou Hast shut thy door
[45:35] pray to thy father who is in secret and
[45:39] thy father who seeth in secret shall
[45:42] reward thee openly what does that mean
[45:45] Amplified version which is a more
[45:46] literal version says this but when you
[45:49] pray go into your most private room
[45:52] close the door and pray to your father
[45:55] who is in secret and your father who
[45:57] sees in secret will reward you so what
[46:02] does that
[46:03] mean that means get in there quiet and
[46:06] then all of a sudden like brother Daniel
[46:09] Evans that that you'll see oh he
[46:12] answered my prayer that person's doing
[46:15] better and it because I went in there in
[46:17] secret I went in quiet I just went me
[46:19] and the Lord and had had nothing to do
[46:20] with anybody else I wasn't trying to
[46:22] draw attention to myself I wasn't trying
[46:23] to lift myself up I I wasn't trying to
[46:25] tell everybody how much I pray or tell
[46:27] this person it was in secret and then
[46:30] God rewarded me openly with the healing
[46:34] of that person or with the encouragement
[46:37] of that person and when someone needs
[46:40] help again don't make it about yourself
[46:43] make it about that person Matthew
[46:45] chapter
[46:46] 9:35 and Jesus went about all the cities
[46:49] and Villages teaching in their
[46:51] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[46:53] the kingdom and healing every sickness
[46:55] and every disease among the people but
[46:57] when he saw the multitude he was moved
[47:01] with compassion on
[47:03] them because they fainted and were
[47:05] scattered abroad as sheep having no
[47:08] Shepherd and he's our example he had
[47:13] compassion on these people his
[47:15] compassion his his his vision wasn't to
[47:18] build his own
[47:20] Ministry his own Ministry was there to
[47:24] help these people his burden was for
[47:27] those who needed help and then watch The
[47:31] Works of Christ watch how Faith becomes
[47:35] Works verse 37 then saith he to then
[47:39] saith he unto his disciples the Harvest
[47:41] truly is plenteous but the laborers are
[47:44] few he's looking out and he says there's
[47:48] so much to do and there's so few that
[47:52] are really willing to do it then he he
[47:55] instructs him he says pray therefore the
[47:57] lord of the Harvest that he will send
[47:59] forth
[48:01] laborers into the Harvest pray not just
[48:05] Jesus wasn't praying Lord exalt my
[48:07] Ministry Jesus was looking out on the
[48:09] people he said oh they need help and he
[48:12] said I pray that God will send soldiers
[48:14] into the battlefield that God will send
[48:17] people to help them and and that's that
[48:20] was his biggest his biggest desire and I
[48:23] know there's a lot of deceivers in the
[48:24] world I know there's there's a lot of of
[48:26] problems as far as as ministers and as
[48:29] far as pastors but look at all the
[48:33] churches and look at all there are many
[48:36] that truly love the people there are
[48:39] many pastors out there that really care
[48:43] about the ones that they are shepherding
[48:46] there's a lot of them and thank God for
[48:48] those people thank God that they really
[48:51] do care and they're they're really I
[48:53] believe they're an answer to Jesus's
[48:55] prayer that God would send these
[48:58] laborers into the
[49:02] fields there was
[49:08] um we we look not not just at at the
[49:11] church but we we look at what's
[49:15] needed and so many times we'll see we'll
[49:18] see like the youth we look at them and
[49:21] say these kids need to straighten up
[49:22] they need to stop looking this way they
[49:24] need to stop talking this way and and
[49:26] and just criticize them but brother
[49:29] sister you can say it but what are you
[49:31] doing to
[49:33] help it's easy to
[49:35] criticize but what are you doing to help
[49:37] the same with the church it's like when
[49:39] are you going to get the chair set up
[49:40] when are you gonna when are you going to
[49:42] get the fellowship all done when are you
[49:43] going to get the windows clean it's like
[49:45] I
[49:46] know I know you could
[49:51] help you could you could do something I
[49:55] mean I know criticism is good and and it
[49:57] sometimes it's Justified
[50:00] but do something the same thing it's
[50:03] like with our
[50:05] spouses those that we love or or or a
[50:08] family member it's like you can
[50:10] criticize what they're doing all you
[50:12] want and you might be justified but what
[50:14] are you doing to help it instead of
[50:17] maybe criticizing my
[50:20] wife maybe I could do something for her
[50:24] maybe I could step up to the place
[50:27] and and say yeah but it's not all about
[50:31] me I want to I want to do like Jesus
[50:33] said and I want to serve
[50:36] her and if we would look at the other
[50:39] person instead of looking at ourselves I
[50:42] say it all the time I'll say it again it
[50:43] ain't about
[50:45] you living a Christian life is about the
[50:47] other person it's about your husband
[50:49] it's about your wife it's about your
[50:50] kids it's about your brother it's about
[50:52] your sister and you look you might get
[50:54] you might get frustrated with them but
[50:55] maybe you could help help a little bit
[50:58] maybe you could help
[51:01] them Philippians chapter
[51:05] 2 it says let not each of you look
[51:09] out only for his own interests but also
[51:13] for the interests of
[51:15] others so we need to stop dwelling on
[51:17] what other people are
[51:19] doing and and how it affects us and then
[51:21] we need to go out and start helping them
[51:23] and you'll see the the most miserable
[51:25] people I think all of us know are the
[51:28] ones that are constantly serving
[51:30] themselves constantly thinking about
[51:32] themselves the happiest people we know
[51:36] and you just judge me on this the
[51:38] happiest people we know are those that
[51:39] are constantly serving other people you
[51:42] know look at my I look at I'll brag on
[51:44] Daniel for a little bit that kid's
[51:46] always helping you need you need to move
[51:49] your you know move from one apartment to
[51:51] the other Daniel's there he's helping
[51:53] people at the gym he's helping people at
[51:55] school he's always doing something for
[51:57] somebody else and he's never
[52:00] complaining
[52:03] usually he's not unless it's his dad he
[52:07] he's never
[52:09] complaining but you look at the young
[52:11] man and he's got a joy to him he's got a
[52:15] happiness that you want to be around but
[52:16] you see other people they're constantly
[52:18] complaining about their lives they're
[52:19] constantly complaining about their
[52:20] themselves and you look and how much do
[52:22] they do for other people I don't mean to
[52:24] be too hard
[52:26] but this is the word you will be happier
[52:31] in serving
[52:32] others back to James chapter 2:1 15 and
[52:36] if a brother or sister be naked and
[52:38] destitute of daily food and one of you
[52:40] say unto them depart in peace be warmed
[52:43] and filled notwithstanding you give them
[52:45] not those things which are needful of
[52:47] the body what does it profit just have
[52:49] faith brother well help you know
[52:52] Brothers you got to get something to eat
[52:55] well buy me
[52:57] lch you know it don't that the words
[53:00] just don't
[53:01] matter even so
[53:03] faith if it hath not works is dead being
[53:09] alone James is saying that your faith is
[53:11] dead because there's nothing that
[53:15] follows yay man may say thou Hast faith
[53:18] and I have Works show me thy faith
[53:20] without works and I will show you my
[53:24] faith by my Works what a
[53:30] statement Matthew chapter 15 you don't
[53:32] have to turn there Jesus says this he
[53:34] says you Hypocrites well did Isaiah the
[53:36] prophet say say prophesy of you saying
[53:40] this people draweth nigh unto me with
[53:42] their mouth and honth me with their lips
[53:44] but their heart is far from
[53:47] me but in vain do they worship me
[53:50] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[53:52] of
[53:53] men NIV says this now listen to this
[53:56] this another translation it says they
[53:58] worship me in vain their teachings are
[54:02] merely human rules is what the New
[54:04] International Version
[54:06] says so if the word of God is real then
[54:09] where are your Works where's your
[54:11] kindness where's your generosity where
[54:13] is your sacrifice there was um kind of
[54:17] on the on the the battle theme Here
[54:20] General Patton we all he's a great man
[54:22] in history there was a Roy Roberson as
[54:25] any he did did anybody ever meet Roy
[54:27] Roberson here the two brothers in the
[54:30] back he was a dear friend of of our our
[54:32] family brother Roberson was also was a
[54:35] war hero he got shot up in the war and
[54:37] and he was
[54:39] actually put with the dead people and
[54:42] the Lord came in in a m a miraculous way
[54:46] and really brought him out and and and
[54:48] he remembers it what happened that he
[54:50] was laying with the dead the dead
[54:53] soldiers but brother Roy
[54:56] he he told us a story one time he says
[54:59] he says they were they were going into
[55:01] battle and he says the the artillery was
[55:03] coming down and there were explosions
[55:05] going all over the bullets were whizzing
[55:07] by and they're they're they're taking
[55:09] cover and they're they're taking their
[55:10] positions and they're returning fire and
[55:12] in comes this
[55:15] Jeep and this guy with a pistol on his
[55:18] side comes out and he's a general and
[55:21] it's it's General
[55:23] Patton the bullets flying everywhere and
[55:26] he he was he got into the middle of it
[55:28] and he encouraged the troops and they
[55:30] went out and they went forward and they
[55:32] won the battle and brother Roberton said
[55:34] that guy he said he was fearless and
[55:37] that was their
[55:38] leader that was the leader of this group
[55:41] and let me tell you that's somebody I
[55:42] would
[55:43] follow one that's willing to get in and
[55:46] get dirty one that's willing to make a
[55:48] sacrifice one that's willing to die for
[55:50] the cause and not sit behind a
[55:52] desk there's a parable
[55:56] that Jesus tells let me see if I have
[56:00] it Matthew chapter 13 verse 44 listen to
[56:05] this Parable and and this is is is
[56:08] mostly interpreted in one way and that
[56:10] might be the right way but but this also
[56:12] might be the right way I think parables
[56:14] are meant to make us think je uh Matthew
[56:17] chap
[56:18] 13:44
[56:20] Yes again the Kingdom of Heaven is like
[56:23] under treasure hid in a field the which
[56:26] when a man hath found he hideth and for
[56:29] Joy thereof goeth and sth all that he
[56:32] have and buyeth that field and again the
[56:36] Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a
[56:38] merchant man seeking goodly Parts when
[56:41] who when he found one
[56:44] Pearl I'm sorry seeking goodly pearls
[56:46] who when he found one pearl of great
[56:49] price went and sold all that he had and
[56:52] brought it and bought it so we have this
[56:56] man that he there's this treasure in the
[56:58] field he goes and he he sells everything
[57:01] he has for this
[57:03] treasure and then he has the treasure
[57:05] and this and it's the same story with
[57:06] this other man that that sees this pearl
[57:09] of great price and he sells everything
[57:11] that he has and he goes and buys this
[57:13] Pearl most of the time I think we
[57:15] interpret those Parables as being when I
[57:18] found
[57:20] Christ I gave everything that I
[57:23] had
[57:24] and I gave it all up for this but look
[57:29] at this in a different
[57:31] way it's not maybe
[57:34] us that saw that pearl of great price
[57:36] and gave everything for it what if that
[57:39] was actually what if I was that pearl of
[57:41] great price what if I was that hidden
[57:45] treasure buried in that field and then
[57:48] somebody else sees this hidden treasure
[57:50] and says that is worth more than
[57:52] anything in the world this Pearl is
[57:54] worth more than all the riches that
[57:56] could be I am going to go and I'm going
[57:58] to give everything and I'm going to
[58:00] purchase that Pearl I'm going to
[58:02] purchase that
[58:03] treasure what if I was that treasure
[58:07] what if you were that treasure what if
[58:09] our children are that treasure and here
[58:12] comes God and he says I'm going to give
[58:15] it all for
[58:16] you I'm going to make that purchase and
[58:19] I'm going to give the greatest thing
[58:21] that I have for that purchase Jesus gave
[58:25] his life for God gave his
[58:27] son for it I mean I'd give everything in
[58:31] the
[58:32] world before I'd give my
[58:36] son and God gave the thing that meant
[58:40] the most to him he gave the thing of
[58:44] most value to him he gave his only
[58:49] begotten
[58:50] son and he bought me and he bought you I
[58:56] was that pearl of great price brother
[58:57] Manny how was
[58:59] it you know you brother Lono you were
[59:01] that treasure that God gave everything
[59:04] for all of us he gave it all he gave it
[59:08] all for me he showed that yeah you can
[59:10] talk a big talk but let me see you put
[59:13] put your money where your mouth is and
[59:15] let me see you do it works is Faith
[59:20] expressed so what did he do Christ
[59:23] showed that this James this James he saw
[59:27] what Jesus did and he says now you do
[59:29] the same you give everything you you
[59:32] become a Christian and when you become a
[59:34] Christian there has to be a life that
[59:35] follows there has to be works that
[59:37] follow James 2:18 continue on yay a man
[59:41] say thou Hast faith and I have Works
[59:44] show me thy faith without works and I
[59:46] will show you fa my faith by my Works
[59:50] look at Jesus's faith I think he showed
[59:52] with his
[59:53] works and all these disciples that
[59:56] follow them they gave their lives for
[59:58] this thou believest that there is one
[1:00:00] God thou doest
[1:00:01] well I love this part about James
[1:00:04] remember he's a pastor he's
[1:00:06] bold he says you believe we're at the
[1:00:09] end time you believe that God sent a
[1:00:11] prophet you believe that that Jesus is
[1:00:12] the Christ you believe that God created
[1:00:14] the heavens and the Earth you believe
[1:00:15] the Bible all that is good
[1:00:19] congratulations the Devils believe
[1:00:23] also and tremble
[1:00:29] thou believest that there is one
[1:00:31] God th doest well the Devils believe
[1:00:34] also and tremble but wilt thou know oh
[1:00:36] vain man that faith without works is
[1:00:40] dead you talk about all this stuff but
[1:00:43] there's not a life following James is
[1:00:45] saying it's dead it doesn't mean
[1:00:49] anything show
[1:00:51] me is what James is saying your life
[1:00:55] proves who you
[1:00:57] are brother brandom said he said um he
[1:01:03] said your life is speaking so loud I
[1:01:06] can't hear what you're
[1:01:08] saying it's the same here James is James
[1:01:11] is saying that he's like he's like
[1:01:13] listen you're you're saying you believe
[1:01:16] it I'll quote uh Brother Brad Burgess
[1:01:20] you know brother Brad in in uh the
[1:01:23] church in Louisville he said this he
[1:01:26] said saying you believe the message does
[1:01:27] no more to prove that you have the Holy
[1:01:30] Ghost than walking under a barn makes
[1:01:32] you a
[1:01:33] horse and that's the truth I stand
[1:01:36] behind it you can say all you want but
[1:01:39] show me the life what's that song that
[1:01:41] brother Aaron sings the life behind the
[1:01:43] name show me the
[1:01:48] life but wilt thou know a vain man that
[1:01:51] faith without works is dead was not
[1:01:53] Abraham Our Father justified by works
[1:01:55] when had offered Isaac his son upon the
[1:01:58] altar see us thou how Faith wrought with
[1:02:01] his works and by works was Faith made
[1:02:04] perfect and the scripture was fulfilled
[1:02:06] which saith Abraham believed and it was
[1:02:09] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[1:02:12] he was called a friend of God you know
[1:02:15] the story of Abraham he's talking about
[1:02:17] so Abraham all of the promises that God
[1:02:19] had given him were right here in this
[1:02:22] young man this boy that was his son a
[1:02:25] miracle birth he was like a hundred
[1:02:27] years old and he had this son his wife
[1:02:29] was like 90 years old they had this son
[1:02:32] and this son was God was going to create
[1:02:34] all these nations out out of his his
[1:02:36] child and and and make and bless all of
[1:02:39] the Nations because of this these tribes
[1:02:42] that would eventually go to Israel all
[1:02:44] of this was going to happen and then God
[1:02:46] says oh yeah this one that you're that
[1:02:47] everything's going to happen now take
[1:02:49] him up and sacrifice him to
[1:02:51] me
[1:02:53] what but Abraham believed
[1:02:56] God look at the difference look at the
[1:02:59] same as Jesus and Abraham Abraham got
[1:03:03] his son up there and like we're going to
[1:03:06] do it God said it he's the one that gave
[1:03:09] me the
[1:03:10] promise and when God gives us a
[1:03:13] promise it doesn't have to make sense in
[1:03:17] how we fulfill and how we go through our
[1:03:19] lives but he gave us a promise and
[1:03:21] here's Abraham he brings his son up
[1:03:22] there and and the boy's like uh dad um I
[1:03:26] know we're going up to make an offering
[1:03:27] and we have we have all the all the
[1:03:28] kindling all the bundles and we're going
[1:03:30] to make the altar here but there's no
[1:03:34] sacrifice where's the
[1:03:36] ram Abraham's like because the faith he
[1:03:41] said God will provide a sacrifice with
[1:03:45] the intent of sacrificing that
[1:03:48] boy brings him up to the altar they
[1:03:50] built this rock altar he binds his son
[1:03:55] puts him up there on top of the On Top
[1:03:57] of the Rock Altar and and all the fire
[1:03:59] all the the sticks are there to burn the
[1:04:01] burn the offering burn his son he takes
[1:04:04] the
[1:04:06] knife he's gonna do it
[1:04:11] man and then the Lord says hold on
[1:04:15] Abraham I know you're going to do
[1:04:18] it I know you believe me and then
[1:04:21] Abraham looked over and they're caught
[1:04:24] in the in the bushes in a place that
[1:04:27] there were no Rams there was no wild
[1:04:29] sheep or anything he sees there a ram
[1:04:32] caught in the
[1:04:33] bushes and then God says see I'll
[1:04:36] provide and he takes that
[1:04:39] RAM and he kills it and James is saying
[1:04:42] this is the same
[1:04:45] Faith you see then how that by works a
[1:04:49] man is Justified and not by faith
[1:04:53] only how many have us
[1:04:56] us have fallen in the
[1:05:00] Trap of saying that just because I
[1:05:03] believe I'm
[1:05:04] saved or just because I believe that I'm
[1:05:08] the
[1:05:09] bride James is absolutely refuting
[1:05:15] that when James says that the Devils
[1:05:17] believe and tremble this scripture seems
[1:05:20] to be saying that the Devils many times
[1:05:23] even have more respect
[1:05:28] but he's saying that no just saying that
[1:05:32] let me see let me see a life behind it
[1:05:36] likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot
[1:05:39] justified by works when she had receed
[1:05:42] the
[1:05:42] messengers and had sent them out another
[1:05:45] way so Rahab Joshua is coming across
[1:05:48] Moses dies Joshua takes the people God
[1:05:51] instructs them to go over into the
[1:05:53] promised land the waters um dry up on
[1:05:56] both sides of the Jordan River Joshua
[1:05:58] goes across there's this big city of
[1:06:01] Jericho with all of these walls and the
[1:06:04] the rumor or the news had gotten to the
[1:06:08] people inside this this city of Jericho
[1:06:11] that hey these people God's with
[1:06:14] them and it started going
[1:06:17] around this big city of Jericho and
[1:06:20] here's this woman and Not only was she
[1:06:22] just a woman she was a
[1:06:24] prostitute she was the
[1:06:27] lowest and she hears all of these rumors
[1:06:30] that God's with these people and she
[1:06:33] took a chance wasn't a chance she
[1:06:36] believed God is what she
[1:06:39] did and these two spies come in and she
[1:06:42] knows she finds out that they are
[1:06:45] from these
[1:06:49] Israelites and she risked her
[1:06:52] life to hide them to SA gave them how
[1:06:57] did she do that by faith she wasn't just
[1:06:59] sitting there and saying oh yeah when
[1:07:01] they come in walls are going to fall
[1:07:02] down and California's going to sink and
[1:07:05] there's going to be all this stuff and
[1:07:06] we're going to go on up no no no
[1:07:09] no she says I'm going to do
[1:07:13] something and Rahab put her faith in the
[1:07:15] action and she says come in come in come
[1:07:17] in let me hide you let me take care of
[1:07:19] you I believe your God is God but when
[1:07:21] you come in and when you destroy this
[1:07:23] city I know it's a big fortress but
[1:07:25] listen God God's with you and it doesn't
[1:07:26] matter how big this Fortress is whenever
[1:07:28] you come in remember me and remember my
[1:07:34] family likewise also was not Rahab the
[1:07:37] Harlot justified by works when she had
[1:07:40] received the messengers and had sent
[1:07:42] them out another way Rahab risked it all
[1:07:47] she had faith and she had the works to
[1:07:49] back it up for as the body without the
[1:07:51] spirit is dead so faith without works is
[1:07:56] dead also
[1:07:58] wow what a
[1:08:01] statement by this man James the
[1:08:04] musicians can
[1:08:07] come now the Book of James like any
[1:08:11] other book of the Bible it wasn't
[1:08:12] written with chapters in it it was just
[1:08:15] written as one big long
[1:08:17] letter and the um I believe by
[1:08:20] inspiration that these chapters were set
[1:08:23] forth but let's just read this through
[1:08:27] for as the body without the spirit is
[1:08:29] dead so faith without works is dead also
[1:08:31] my brethren be not many Masters knowing
[1:08:35] that we shall receive the greater
[1:08:37] condemnation new King James says my
[1:08:39] brethren Le let not many of you become
[1:08:43] teachers knowing that we shall receive a
[1:08:45] stricter
[1:08:47] judgment he's saying you want to be a
[1:08:49] preacher you want to be a teacher you
[1:08:50] want to be in charge of of a
[1:08:52] congregation he's like you're going to
[1:08:54] be judged at a higher Lev level and he
[1:08:56] just talked about having all this
[1:09:00] Faith so how can a man preach to a
[1:09:05] congregation if he's just has an
[1:09:07] understanding of the word and hasn't
[1:09:09] been there remember
[1:09:12] when years ago I'd have Stephanie I'd
[1:09:16] have her just dropped me off in certain
[1:09:18] parts of the town and I would go and I
[1:09:21] would witness to as many people as I
[1:09:24] could
[1:09:25] and I'd always tell tell Stephanie I'd
[1:09:27] say um yeah just drop me off I'm going
[1:09:29] to see if I can find somebody to listen
[1:09:30] to
[1:09:32] me and it never came to
[1:09:36] anything and I look back on those days
[1:09:38] and what was I trying to do I was trying
[1:09:40] to get them to think like
[1:09:43] me I was trying to get them to
[1:09:45] understand my way of thinking and
[1:09:48] thinking that that would bring Salvation
[1:09:50] rather than showing them a living Jesus
[1:09:53] Christ with faith
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:58] same I
[1:09:59] remember another man that he drove
[1:10:04] across the country he came and he wanted
[1:10:06] me to cast out a demon from
[1:10:09] him and it came to me
[1:10:12] and
[1:10:14] and didn't
[1:10:17] work it didn't work because my faith
[1:10:19] wasn't in the right
[1:10:22] thing but
[1:10:23] now I look look
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:27] at how the Lord has revealed to me that
[1:10:30] it is a living Jesus Christ it's not
[1:10:33] some Doctrine it's not some church it's
[1:10:35] not some denomination but it is Christ
[1:10:38] him alone living and he is
[1:10:42] alive and I can show you him and he will
[1:10:45] do it he can do it through me he can do
[1:10:47] it through any any of you he can do it
[1:10:49] through any person that really
[1:10:51] believes it's different now as far as me
[1:10:56] I can see that now I can see that why
[1:11:00] did it not make a difference back then
[1:11:02] for the same reason is these people
[1:11:04] coming to me and saying here you need to
[1:11:06] preach this this this and this aren't
[1:11:07] you AR aren't you trying to get them to

[1:12:28] out thank
[1:12:31] God you said well brother Daniel what
[1:12:33] can I do you talk about Works what do
[1:12:37] you want me to do number one follow his
[1:12:41] Commandments put into practice what he
[1:12:44] said to
[1:12:45] do they asked the same thing in Acts
[1:12:49] chapter
[1:12:50] 2 I can quote it or I can read it
[1:12:56] they asked the same thing they were cut
[1:12:58] in their hearts and they said what must
[1:13:01] we do Peter we see that you got it what
[1:13:04] must I
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:09] do now when they heard this they were
[1:13:12] pricked in their heart and said to Peter
[1:13:14] and the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:13:16] Brethren what shall we
[1:13:18] do now you believe now you got to put
[1:13:22] the faith in the action
[1:13:27] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[1:13:29] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:13:32] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:13:34] sins for the washing away of your sins
[1:13:37] for the taking away of your
[1:13:39] sins and thou shalt receive the gift of
[1:13:44] the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto
[1:13:48] you and to your children and to them
[1:13:51] that are far off even as many as the
[1:13:54] Lord our God God shall
[1:13:57] call just
[1:13:59] believing brothers and sisters there is
[1:14:02] more to it James he wouldn't have said
[1:14:06] the Devils
[1:14:08] believe and he's not saying that you're
[1:14:10] a devil he's not saying that you're
[1:14:12] wrong what he's doing is he's saying
[1:14:14] Brethren put it to
[1:14:16] work I don't believe he was calling
[1:14:18] anybody a devil I don't believe he was
[1:14:20] insult being insulting in any way I
[1:14:21] think he was saying listen that the
[1:14:23] Devils know the same stuff now you put
[1:14:25] it to work and what did Peter say repent
[1:14:28] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:14:30] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:14:32] and you shall it's it's a
[1:14:36] promise it's not just I hope I will I
[1:14:39] can claim it if I go up to those Waters
[1:14:42] of baptism I can claim that I will if I
[1:14:45] have not yet will receive the infilling
[1:14:48] of the Holy
[1:14:50] Ghost and when you receive that
[1:14:52] infilling let me tell you something
[1:14:55] there's a change that takes place in
[1:14:56] your life and people try to Define it
[1:15:00] this way and they try to Define it that
[1:15:02] way when you are filled with the Holy
[1:15:05] Spirit God takes precedence in every
[1:15:09] part of your life doesn't mean you won't
[1:15:12] make mistakes doesn't mean you won't
[1:15:15] fail but when you get right down to it
[1:15:18] the Lord is the most important all of us
[1:15:23] can say that but when you truly received
[1:15:26] the Holy Spirit now you are on the
[1:15:29] battlefield for
[1:15:32] God be a good time to be baptized if you
[1:15:37] want to be
[1:15:38] baptized we have at least one do we
[1:15:40] still have
[1:15:41] one brother let me tell you
[1:15:44] something this is putting faith into
[1:15:47] action you can say it all you
[1:15:50] want but it takes an effort to stand up
[1:15:53] and say I want to do it
[1:15:56] I want to be
[1:15:57] baptized and Lord not just be baptized
[1:16:00] but then there's more after baptism
[1:16:02] don't just leave it up in the
[1:16:04] water now go
[1:16:06] out and put this faith into
[1:16:11] action brother Stephen go to battle now
[1:16:14] not for the defense of the country but
[1:16:16] for the Salvation of the country for the
[1:16:18] Salvation of your neighbors for the
[1:16:20] Salvation of your
[1:16:21] community for the Salvation of your
[1:16:23] family go to
[1:16:25] battle and that's what this baptism
[1:16:28] means that's what this book of James is
[1:16:31] about put your faith into
[1:16:34] action brother you can go back and and
[1:16:37] uh meet the brothers back there if
[1:16:38] there's anyone else that wants to be
[1:16:40] baptized we can um we can show you up to
[1:16:44] the to the
[1:16:45] baptismal brother you can go back and uh
[1:16:48] and meet the deacons back there and
[1:16:49] they'll they'll bring you
[1:16:51] up brothers and
[1:16:53] sisters I know that this book of James
[1:16:55] is difficult it makes us stand back and

[1:17:01] wife how am I treating my husband am I
[1:17:05] preferring myself in this or am I put
