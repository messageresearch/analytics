[23:03] houses and all as we were singing that
[23:05] he had mentioned something about his
[23:07] father-in-law owning 10 acres of land in
[23:11] California and he had his business there
[23:13] and he had his house in the back where
[23:15] you couldn't see
[23:17] it and then some folks with money came
[23:19] and bought all the property around him
[23:22] and built houses all around
[23:24] him so they came and offered him2
[23:27] million
[23:28] for the piece of
[23:29] land and he said no this is my land this
[23:32] is my
[23:34] home and the it was his son that was
[23:38] telling me about it and he
[23:39] said actually know it was a good friend
[23:42] of his and he said but you know they'll
[23:44] come and they'll make the right
[23:46] offer and all that land will be gone and
[23:50] they'll just fill it full of
[23:52] houses and as I was remember singing

[28:12] we've got the
[28:13] first little slide up
[28:16] there yes that's the title of the sermon
[28:22] tonight it's uh it's Hebrew you probably
[28:25] figured that out and it's it's the first
[28:27] word in the Bible That's translated in
[28:30] the beginning and it is uh
[28:35] barit the Jewish Bible doesn't have the
[28:37] name Genesis or Exodus they use
[28:40] different names so we're going to do
[28:42] part two of beet tonight last week
[28:45] brother Daniel covered the first part of
[28:48] portion of Genesis tonight we'll cover
[28:50] the rest now I assumed he was going to
[28:51] do the first half the first 25 chapters
[28:54] so I'd only have 25 to do and then he
[28:57] said said well brother ly um I might
[28:59] only get to 22 I said well that's okay
[29:02] he got to
[29:04] 15 so we're going to be a little bit
[29:06] busy now I gave my wife a sign so if you
[29:10] see you're holding it up you can for
[29:12] everybody can see she's telling you to
[29:14] slow down because we got about 90
[29:15] seconds per chapter to cover 35 chapters
[29:18] tonight um but tonight when we cover
[29:21] this we want to be emphasizing the
[29:24] pointers to and the Fingerprints of the
[29:28] Messiah the one we know is Jesus of
[29:31] Nazareth whom we believe to be an
[29:32] embodiment of the very God of
[29:35] barit
[29:37] creation so please join with me once
[29:40] again in prayer as we go to the author
[29:42] not only of the Book of Genesis but the
[29:45] author of The Salvation of our that in
[29:49] whom we put our faith and trust for our
[29:52] Salvation let's go to him Lord
[29:55] Jesus Lord this is such an
[29:58] awesome responsibility to stand in
[30:01] front of your people a portion of the
[30:05] body of Jesus Christ people each one of
[30:09] whom you would have laid your life down
[30:10] for and yet we're a Congregation of such
[30:14] blessed People Help Lord that tonight
[30:16] the words that are spoken be a blessing
[30:18] that answers questions that draws us
[30:20] closer to you Lord Jesus and therefore
[30:23] closer to one another we commit the
[30:26] remainder of this service in your hands
[30:27] forgive me Lord where I've fallen short
[30:30] forgive us all where we've fallen short
[30:32] Lord Lord just help us to be yielded to
[30:34] you accept our praise and worship this
[30:36] evening as we turn to your word in Jesus
[30:39] precious name
[30:42] amen before you're seated I'd like to
[30:44] read a few verses from one of the
[30:47] closing chapters of Genesis these
[30:50] particular verses are ones that strike a
[30:52] deep chord within my soul they give me
[30:56] hope verses that I think reflect the
[30:59] very nature of the one whom we seek to
[31:04] serve the scene is
[31:06] Egypt it's about
[31:09] 1859 BC 17 years after arriving in Egypt
[31:14] Jacob also called Israel has gathered
[31:17] his sons and given them his dying
[31:19] blessings from Ruben the firstborn to
[31:22] Benjamin the youngest after doing this
[31:25] we read in Genesis 49
[31:27] starting at verse
[31:30] 28 all these are the TW tribes of Israel
[31:33] this is that their father spake unto
[31:35] them and blessed them everyone according
[31:38] to his Blessing he blessed them and he
[31:41] charged them and said unto
[31:45] them I'm to be gathered un to my
[31:48] people bury me with my fathers in the
[31:52] cave that is in the field of Ephron the
[31:56] hittite
[31:58] in the cave that's in the field of Mella
[32:01] which which is before Mam and the land
[32:04] of Canan which Abraham bought with the
[32:07] field of Ephron the hittite for for for
[32:10] a possession of a burying place
[32:14] there there they buried Abraham and
[32:17] Sarah his wife there they buried Isaac
[32:22] and Rebecca his wife and and there I
[32:27] buried
[32:28] Leia Leah please be
[32:33] seated there they buried Abraham and and
[32:38] Sarah his wife there they they buried
[32:42] Isaac and
[32:44] Rebecca his wife and
[32:47] there I buried
[32:50] Leah this is the verse that got me
[32:52] started years ago and to a desire to dig
[32:56] into the Book of Genesis
[32:57] the
[32:58] transformation of
[33:00] Jacob not just a name change but a
[33:04] nature change his tenderness toward the
[33:08] wife he once
[33:11] hated brother Daniel covered the first
[33:13] part of Genesis last Wednesday from the
[33:16] creation of the universe the first
[33:17] humans the destruction of the flood the
[33:19] saving of Noah and his family the Tower
[33:22] of Babel the story of Abraham migrating
[33:25] to Canan
[33:27] Canan this evening I'll give you an
[33:29] extremely brief overview of the
[33:31] remaining 35 chapters of this remarkable
[33:35] book in that overview I'll share some
[33:38] excerpts that are prophecies Promises of
[33:40] God's commitment to fulfill what he told
[33:44] to
[33:45] Abraham and I want to share the story of
[33:47] a Young
[33:48] Man part of an incredibly dysfunctional
[33:52] family that I think illustrates the very
[33:55] nature of Jesus
[33:57] patient transformation of character
[34:00] spoiler alert not
[34:03] Joseph my hope is that if you haven't
[34:07] already done so after last Wednesday
[34:08] evening you'll grab your bible read the
[34:10] whole book of Genesis it's it's only 50
[34:14] chapters oh 50 chapters well this is a
[34:16] Sunday school textbook or read chapters
[34:18] 10 or 20 Pages we're talking 40 to 60
[34:21] Pages depending upon the size of pages
[34:23] and size of type in your Bible couple of
[34:25] hours three hours spread it out over a
[34:27] week if you haven't done it please do
[34:31] it uh you might find it easier to read
[34:34] and follow if you use a newer
[34:36] translation the NIV or NLT or ESV read
[34:39] it not to extract Doctrine but to follow
[34:42] the flow if you do I think you realize
[34:46] as with our recent study the book of
[34:48] Acts these are real people flawed in
[34:52] character flawed in action they're not
[34:55] superheroes they're they're not
[34:57] possessing unique powers they're People
[35:00] Like Us certainly people like me Paul
[35:05] described him in this way he said in 1
[35:08] Corinthians 1:26 for you see your
[35:10] calling Brethren that not many wise
[35:13] according to the flesh not many mighty
[35:17] not many noble are
[35:20] called so what type of people does God
[35:24] choose but God has chosen the foolish
[35:28] things of the world to put to shame the
[35:30] wise God has chosen the weak things of
[35:33] the world to put to shame the things
[35:35] which are Mighty God is the base things
[35:38] of the world and the things which are
[35:40] despised God has chosen and the things
[35:43] which are not to bring to not to bring
[35:46] to nothing the things that are so the
[35:50] one that's ones that God chooses the
[35:52] chosen people the
[35:54] elect are typically the food foolish or
[35:57] the weak or the base or the
[35:59] despised you you get the
[36:02] idea and Paul tells us why that no flesh
[36:06] should glory in his
[36:08] presence it's all about him it's not
[36:12] about us and in Ephesians 1 he says
[36:15] blessed be the God and father of our
[36:17] Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with
[36:20] all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[36:23] places in Christ according as Heath
[36:26] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[36:30] of the world before
[36:34] barit that we should be not that we
[36:38] are but that we might become holy and
[36:42] Without Blame before him in love having
[36:46] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[36:49] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[36:51] according to the good pleasure of his
[36:54] will to the praise of our our
[36:57] steadfastness no of our accomplishment
[37:01] oh no to the praise of the glory of his
[37:05] grace wherein by or through which he
[37:09] hath made us accepted and the Beloved in
[37:12] whom we have Redemption through his
[37:15] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[37:19] to not our efforts but to The Riches of
[37:24] his grace he he didn't choose us because
[37:29] we're
[37:30] Superstars he chose us because he is the
[37:36] Superstar and that is in part what
[37:38] Genesis is all about what it illustrates
[37:42] what it tells us as it sets the stage
[37:44] for the entire Bible God's grace
[37:48] accepted through faith let's start with
[37:51] the review of the call of Abram Genesis
[37:54] 12 verse1 we read now the Lord had said
[37:57] to Abram get thee out of thy country and
[38:00] from thy Kindred and from thy Father's
[38:03] House unto a land that I will show thee
[38:06] and I will make of thee a great nation
[38:09] and I will bless thee and make thy name
[38:12] great and thou shalt be a blessing and I
[38:14] will bless them that bless thee curse
[38:17] him that curseth thee and in thee
[38:20] through you Abraham shall all families
[38:23] of the earth be blessed speaking of the
[38:26] Messiah of Jesus Abram was aged 75 era
[38:31] was Sarah Sarai was aged 65 and the
[38:35] nephew lot moved with them from Haron
[38:37] after Abram's father nahor died and they
[38:39] came to Canan and you can see here on
[38:41] the map those of you that are sitting
[38:43] close to the front can see on the map
[38:45] those of you in the back have to take my
[38:46] word for it that up here we have Haron
[38:49] down here we have uh the the promis and
[38:52] we have sheum we have uh I can't see it
[38:55] either we have beers a uh heon and you
[38:59] can see the scale of Miles 300 miles so
[39:01] they they had about a 350 400 mile walk
[39:04] ahead of
[39:05] them I hope they didn't have the amount
[39:07] of baggage to carry that we tend to have
[39:11] so brother Daniel took us through
[39:13] chapter 15 so we're going to go on to
[39:16] chapter 16 I'm just going to give you a
[39:18] brief overview of these chapters we'll
[39:20] dig down into a couple of places as we
[39:22] move along chapter 16 sirar I suggests
[39:25] that we've married a long time haven't
[39:27] had any kids so conceive a child by her
[39:29] Egyptian slave Hagar he agrees Hagar
[39:33] gets pregnant and she despises Sarai
[39:36] Sarai becomes very cruel to Hagar
[39:38] causing Hagar to flee into the desert
[39:41] the Lord tells Hagar go back go back
[39:45] that she'd have a son Ishmael God hears
[39:48] who will be wild and at odds with those
[39:50] around him Ishmael is born a son whom
[39:52] Abraham dearly loves Abraham is 86 years
[39:55] old This Time chapter 17 at age 99 the
[40:00] Lord appears to Abram affirms his
[40:02] promise that he will be the ancestor of
[40:04] many nations and changes his name to
[40:07] Abraham we read 177 I will establish my
[40:11] Covenant between me and thee and thy
[40:13] seed after thee in their generations for
[40:16] an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto
[40:19] thee and to thy seed after thee and I
[40:22] will give unto thee and to thy seed
[40:24] after thee the land wherein thou art a
[40:26] stranger all the land of Canan for an
[40:28] everlasting
[40:30] possession and I will be their
[40:32] God and God said unto Abraham Thou shalt
[40:36] keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy
[40:38] seed after thee in their
[40:39] Generations this is my Covenant which ye
[40:42] shall keep between me and you and thy
[40:45] seed after thee every Manchild among you
[40:48] shall be
[40:49] circumcised he goes on to change sarai's
[40:52] name to Sarah tells him he will have a
[40:55] sum by her to be named Isaac Abraham
[40:59] pleads for Ishmael God promises to make
[41:01] him a great nation but tells him that
[41:03] the Covenant is to be through
[41:06] Isaac God leaves Abraham at age 99 is
[41:10] circumcised along with Ishmael age 13
[41:12] and all the men in his
[41:15] house chapter 18 God comes to visit
[41:18] Abraham along with two angels we're all
[41:20] familiar with this story Abraham is told
[41:22] that Sarah will be pregnant within a
[41:23] month and sends two angels to
[41:25] investigate Sodom Abraham pleads for the
[41:28] people of Sodom and is told that if
[41:29] there are 10 righteous in it God will
[41:32] not destroy
[41:33] it chapter 19 the Angels rescue lot and
[41:37] his family thus god making sure that not
[41:39] only are there not 10 righteous that
[41:41] there are zero righteous in it as they
[41:44] leave Lot's wife looks back and dies
[41:47] changes into a pillar of salt Sodom is
[41:50] destroyed by fire from heaven lot and
[41:52] his daughters flee to a cave lot's two
[41:55] daughters think think that they're alone
[41:57] in the world they just saw all this
[41:58] destruction so they plot they get lot
[42:01] drunk and each one seduces him and is
[42:03] pregnant as a result and the lines of
[42:06] Moab think of the story of
[42:08] Ruth or the entire book of Deuteronomy
[42:11] it's all said in Moab and Aman are the
[42:14] result chapter 20 Abraham moves South to
[42:18] guer tells Sarah to say she's his sister
[42:22] that this is his his pregnant wife as in
[42:25] chapter 12 this is now the second time
[42:27] Abraham goes around deceiving a king
[42:30] aimc which is which it's a title I think
[42:33] rather than a name it means my father
[42:35] King kind of like
[42:37] Pharaoh so he takes her for his heram
[42:40] God tells aimc that Sarah is married to
[42:42] Abraham and to restore her or perish and
[42:45] further says that Abraham is his prophet
[42:48] and must pray for ailec this guy that
[42:50] lied to you he's my
[42:52] prophet and he's got to pray for you
[42:54] where you're going to be in big trouble
[42:57] strange how God works aimc gives Abraham
[43:01] great wealth tells him to live where he
[43:02] wants tells Sarah the money gave Abraham
[43:04] will clear her reputation Abraham prays
[43:07] ABC's household previously Barren
[43:09] becomes fruitful with children chapter
[43:12] 21 Isaac is born he's circumcised on the
[43:15] eighth day at his weaning Sarah wants
[43:18] Hagar and ishma cast out get rid of
[43:21] these people they're they looked at me
[43:23] funny Abraham doesn't want to do it but
[43:26] God tells
[43:27] him are you listening Brothers God tells
[43:30] him listen to
[43:32] Sarah Hagar and Ishmael leave they're
[43:35] running out of supplies in the desert
[43:37] lay down to die God hears not Hagar's
[43:41] cries but ishmael's cries and rescues
[43:44] them ishma grows up marries an Egyptian
[43:47] becomes an Archer Abraham and ailec have
[43:50] a confrontation over water
[43:53] rights they settled their differences at
[43:56] beeva be means uh well and cheva means
[43:59] seven but it also means completion it's
[44:01] a sign of a completed Covenant or
[44:03] contract so be cheva that plays a role
[44:06] in here a bit later as well chapter
[44:08] 22 God asks Abraham to sacrifice Isaac
[44:12] he agrees they travel to mount Mariah in
[44:16] Genesis 22:5 Abraham said unto his young
[44:19] men abide you here with the ass and I
[44:21] and the lad will go Yonder and worship
[44:23] and come again to you remember remember
[44:26] Abraham's an old man he's 115 or 20 his
[44:28] voice isn't so strong a bit like mine
[44:31] Abraham took the
[44:32] wood of the burnt offering and laid it
[44:35] upon Isaac his son and took the fire in
[44:37] his hand and a knife and they went both
[44:39] of them together and they climb up this
[44:42] this mountain in the Judean Hills
[44:44] leaving the plane and going up to an
[44:46] elevation of about 2500 feet is about
[44:48] the peak there and Isaac spake unto
[44:51] Abraham his father and said Dad uh my
[44:54] father and he said here I am I am my son
[44:56] and he said behold I see the fire in the
[44:59] wood but where's the lamb for a burnt
[45:02] offering and Abraham said my son God
[45:04] will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[45:06] offering and so they went both of them
[45:10] together just as Abraham is about to
[45:12] kill Isaac to sacrifice him an angel
[45:14] stops him a ram is caught nearby and
[45:16] they sacrifice it instead Isaac and the
[45:20] ram in different ways symbolize the
[45:22] eventual death of Jesus on the nearby
[45:26] Mount Calvary just a few hundred yards
[45:29] away Genesis 23 starts and tells us
[45:33] Sarah was 107 and2 years old these were
[45:37] the years of the life of Sarah so at
[45:40] this point Abraham's 137 ishmael's 50
[45:43] Isaac is 37 Sarah died in curiot Alba
[45:47] the same as Hebron in the land of Canan
[45:51] and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and
[45:54] to weep for her I quote this because
[45:57] Sarah is the only woman in the Bible I I
[46:00] believe this is correct whose age and
[46:03] death and burial all three are each
[46:06] distinctly recorded others we know where
[46:09] they died how they died but not how old
[46:11] they were Sarah is is
[46:15] unique Abraham negotiates the purchase
[46:18] of a cave for burial and berries are
[46:21] there this is the burial cave mentioned
[46:22] by Jacob in our opening verses this
[46:24] evening three years pass and in chapter
[46:27] 24 we read that Abraham was old and well
[46:31] stricken in age in fact he's now 140
[46:34] years old the Lord had blessed Abraham
[46:37] in all things and Abraham said unto
[46:39] elzer his eldest servant of his house
[46:42] that ruled over all that he had put I
[46:45] pray thee thy hand under my
[46:47] thigh and I
[46:51] will make thee swear by the Lord the god
[46:54] of Heaven and the god of the Earth that
[46:56] thou shalt not take a wife unto my son
[46:59] of the daughters of the Canaanites among
[47:02] whom I dwell but thou shall go into my
[47:04] country andto my Kindred and take a wife
[47:08] unto my son
[47:10] Isaac and the servant said unto him what
[47:13] par Adventure what if the woman will not
[47:15] be willing to follow me into this land
[47:18] must I needs bring thy son again into
[47:20] the land from whence thou camest and
[47:22] Abraham said unto him beware thou bring
[47:25] not my son thither again the Lord God Of
[47:28] Heaven which took me from my father's
[47:31] house and from the land of my Kindred
[47:33] and which spake unto me and that swear
[47:36] unto me saying unto thy seed will I give
[47:39] this land he shall send his angels
[47:42] before thee and thou shalt take a wife
[47:44] unto my son from
[47:48] F and if the woman will not be willing
[47:50] to follow thee then Thou shalt be clear
[47:53] from this my oath only bring not my my
[47:55] son thither
[47:57] again and the servant put his hand under
[48:00] the thigh of Abraham his master and
[48:02] swear to him concerning this
[48:05] matter note Abraham's
[48:07] insistence that Isaac not leave Canan
[48:11] not leave Canaan in fact Isaac is the
[48:15] only member of the line of Patriarchs
[48:18] that does not leave the promised land
[48:22] Abraham Jacob all of Jacob's sons leave
[48:25] all spend time in Egypt Isaac is the
[48:29] exception there's a lot being said with
[48:32] this but we're constrained by time
[48:35] tonight 35 chapters 90 seconds get going
[48:38] loud Abraham sends his servant eleazer
[48:42] of Damascus to Mesopotamia
[48:45] Syria and he finds Rebecca granddaughter
[48:49] of Abraham's brother nahor he gives her
[48:52] gifts indicating there's more where
[48:54] those came from
[48:56] similarly the gift of the holy spirit is
[49:00] the earnest of our Redemption it's
[49:03] glorious but there's more and better
[49:06] where that came from she agrees to go
[49:09] with elaser to Canon upon her arrival
[49:13] she marries Isaac this chapter types or
[49:16] models the Holy Spirit sent to seek out
[49:18] a bride for
[49:20] Christ for you and I trust for
[49:24] me well Flash Forward about 35 years
[49:29] Abraham dies at age
[49:32] 175 Isaac at this point age 75 and
[49:36] ishmail at this point P age 88 bury him
[49:40] in the cave next to Sarah ishmael's
[49:43] descendants are listed in this chapter
[49:45] and another Flash Forward of an
[49:46] additional 49 years we're told that
[49:49] ishmail dies at age 137 when Isaac is
[49:54] 124 then it goes back to the story
[49:56] timeline still in chapter 25 after 20
[49:59] years of marriage when Isaac is 60 the
[50:01] twins Esau and Jacob are born to Isaac
[50:04] and Rebecca they have very different
[50:07] Natures Esau Isaac's favorite is a
[50:11] hunter Jacob Rebecca's favorite Cooks
[50:15] Reds
[50:16] sto Jacob gets Esau's riter the
[50:19] firstborn from Esau at about age 15
[50:22] according to Jewish
[50:23] sources Esau which means means hairy is
[50:26] also called Edom which means red I
[50:30] suspect maybe he had red
[50:33] hair chapter 26 opens with God's
[50:36] promises to
[50:39] Isaac and there was a famine in the land
[50:42] beside the first famine that was in the
[50:44] days of Abraham and in fact we'll see
[50:47] that famine caused by lack of rain is a
[50:50] major factor in the movements of the
[50:53] Patriarchs Isaac went unto to ailec King
[50:56] of the Philistines unto guer and the
[50:59] Lord appeared unto him and said go not
[51:02] down into Egypt dwell in the land which
[51:04] I shall tell thee of again Isaac never
[51:07] left the land of promise sojourn in this
[51:10] land that's the condition that's the
[51:14] command and these are the promises this
[51:17] is the result of this obedience I will
[51:20] be with thee and will bless thee For
[51:22] unto thee and unto thy seed thy
[51:24] descendant
[51:26] I will give all these countries all this
[51:28] land all this ground and I will perform
[51:30] the oath which I swear unto Abraham thy
[51:33] father I will make thy seed to multiply
[51:35] as the stars of heaven and will give
[51:38] unto thy seed all these
[51:40] countries and here's the one that
[51:42] applies to us and thy seed shall all the
[51:45] nations all the peoples of the
[51:48] earth be
[51:50] blessed pointing to the Future
[51:53] Messiah and here's why your line will be
[51:56] chosen to bring this blessing to all the
[51:58] peoples of the world
[52:02] Isaac because that Abraham obeyed my
[52:05] voice and kept my charge my Commandments
[52:09] my statutes my
[52:12] laws Isaac stays in this area he lies
[52:16] about his wife to aimc claiming she's
[52:18] his sister remember these are flawed
[52:21] people and no doubt he learned this
[52:23] trick from his father Abraham Isaac I I
[52:27] this worked for me twice you might want
[52:29] to keep it in
[52:30] mind so he becomes a successful farmer
[52:34] note aimc my father the king it's
[52:36] probably a title and not a name and and
[52:38] similar to Pharaoh but in any event it's
[52:40] not the same guy that decades earlier
[52:42] Abraham had dealt with Isaac is asked to
[52:45] leave and lives in what we now call the
[52:48] neab the southern part of Israel think
[52:50] of it as Northern SI he digs Wells for
[52:54] water gets into quarrels with the locals
[52:56] over water rights aimc makes a treaty
[52:59] with Isaac Esau marries two local women
[53:03] the twins are now 40 years old meaning
[53:05] that Isaac is 100 years
[53:08] old we move into chapter 27 Isaac is old
[53:13] and blind if you do the math from the
[53:15] other clues in the Genesis text I'll do
[53:17] it for you so you don't have to take
[53:19] notes and go back and calculate you'll
[53:21] realize at this time Isaac's 137 years
[53:24] old making Jacob and Esau 77 years
[53:29] old Isaac wants to bless his sons before
[53:32] he dies so he tells Esau go out and Hunt
[53:35] me up some vettis and then oh I'll make
[53:38] you a real good blessing then so Esau
[53:42] goes out meanwhile what happens Jacob in
[53:45] collusion with Rebecca and it's more
[53:47] likely Rebecca in collusion with Jacob
[53:49] tricks Isaac into blessing Jacob
[53:51] thinking he's Esau his favorite and the
[53:54] firstborn Esau comes back and is enraged
[53:58] Rebecca tells Jacob to flee for his life
[54:00] to haran and Syria and to his mother's
[54:03] brother his uncle
[54:05] laan chapter 28 begins with Isaac
[54:09] sending Jacob on his way from Beva to
[54:14] Syria meanwhile Isaac knowing that his
[54:17] parents don't like the local ladies
[54:19] marries a distant cousin a descendant of
[54:21] ishmail not a Canaanite hoping that this
[54:24] will please his parents
[54:26] chapter
[54:27] 28 verse 10 we read that Jacob went out
[54:31] from Bersa and went towards haran we
[54:33] know that that's 350 or 400 miles it's
[54:36] going to take him a while to walk that
[54:38] he lighted upon a certain place one long
[54:41] days walking trying to get away from
[54:42] Esau he carried there all night because
[54:44] the sun was set he took the stones of
[54:46] that place and put them for his pillows
[54:48] and lay down in that place to sleep and
[54:51] he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on
[54:54] the Earth
[54:58] and the top of it reached to heaven and
[55:00] behold the angels of God ascending and
[55:02] descending on it and behold the Lord
[55:07] stood above it and said I am the Lord
[55:10] God of Abraham thy father and the god of
[55:14] Isaac does that seem a little
[55:17] strange Isaac's his
[55:19] father in Biblical Hebrew they don't
[55:22] have grandfather and Grandson in
[55:24] Biblical Hebrew ancestors are always
[55:26] father descendants are begat and are
[55:29] called seed or Sons or daughters or
[55:31] child or children regardless of the
[55:33] number of generations that separate them
[55:35] don't get tripped up by this especially
[55:37] when you read lists of names in the
[55:38] genealogies and discover gaps and
[55:42] inconsistencies I am the Lord God of
[55:44] Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac
[55:48] the land wherein thou liest to thee will
[55:50] I give it and to thy seed to thy
[55:53] descendants and thy seed shall be as is
[55:55] the dust of the earth and thou shalt
[55:57] spread abroad to the west and to the
[55:59] East and to the north and to the South
[56:03] and in thee and in thy seed speaking of
[56:06] the Messiah shall all the families of
[56:08] the earth be
[56:11] blessed Jacob's
[56:14] frightened but if you remember with his
[56:17] uh with his Stu and his brother he's
[56:19] Jacob's a Wheeler Dealer
[56:21] right so he he builds a pillar an alter
[56:25] requires many stones a pillar is one
[56:27] stone so he takes the stone he's been
[56:29] sleeping on sets it up as a pillar and
[56:33] and he vows if God Elohim will be with
[56:37] me and will keep me in this way that I
[56:40] go and will give me bread to eat and
[56:43] rment to put on so that I come again to
[56:45] my father's house in peace remember he's
[56:49] fleeing for his life from his brother
[56:51] Esau the hunter then shall the Lord
[56:55] capital L O R D be my God and this Stone
[57:00] which I have set for a pillar shall be
[57:02] God's house his Temple and all that thou
[57:05] shalt give me I will surely give the
[57:06] tenth unto
[57:09] thee chapter 29 Jacob gets to his
[57:12] relatives in Syria he sees Rachel wants
[57:15] to marry her agrees to work for his
[57:17] uncle laben for seven years in Li of a
[57:19] dowy he only has a stick in what he's
[57:22] carrying Rachel has an older sister Leah
[57:25] who has tender eyes but Jacob wants
[57:28] Rachel who is beautiful and well-
[57:30] favored he works for seven years they
[57:33] celebrate with a feast and at age 84
[57:36] Jacob marries Rachel except that it
[57:40] turns out when you wakes up in the
[57:41] morning that laan unbeknownst has
[57:43] substituted Leah for
[57:45] Rachel Jacob's not real happy about this
[57:48] he agrees to work for another seven
[57:50] years for laan if he can marry Rachel so
[57:53] a week goes by and the have a second
[57:55] wedding and now he marries
[57:58] Rachel uh Leah's slave a lady named
[58:03] zilpa goes with Leah that's her slave
[58:05] her property and Rachel slave BHA
[58:08] accompanies
[58:10] Rachel we're told that Jacob hates Leah
[58:13] and loves
[58:15] Rachel God makes Leah very fertile and
[58:18] Rachel Baron Leah has four sons in Rapid
[58:22] order Reuben Simeon Levi and
[58:26] Judah Chapter 30 Jacob has seven more
[58:29] sons and one daughter from Leah we get
[58:32] isachar zebulun and the daughter Dina
[58:35] bilha we get Dan and Neftali zilpa we
[58:40] get God and Asher and eventually through
[58:43] Rachel Joseph Jacob's now 91 years
[58:47] old he's tired he wants to go
[58:50] home laan persuades him to stay and work
[58:53] for a while to get flocks and herds get
[58:56] get get a little more
[58:58] wealth well there's trickery involved in
[59:00] this laan is trying to trick Jacob and
[59:03] Jacob has a few tricks up his uh 91y old
[59:07] sleeve and he he tricks laben as well
[59:09] there neither one of them are
[59:11] particularly upright in all of this
[59:12] stuff so they're cheating Each Other
[59:14] Well after 31 chapter six chapter 31
[59:18] excuse me after six more years at age
[59:21] 97 Jacob has finally had enough and
[59:23] gained enough wealth
[59:25] laan is unhappy and God tells Jacob to
[59:28] go back home his wives agree and they
[59:31] set out sneaking out from laan Rachel
[59:34] steals her dad's idols and takes them
[59:36] with her three days later laan finds out
[59:39] they've left and after seven more days
[59:41] of pursuit he tracks him down just
[59:43] before he gets there God Appears to laan
[59:46] and says Don't Hurt Jacob be careful so
[59:51] Laban and Jacob make peace Jacob can
[59:54] turn continues the journey
[1:00:02] West if I'm going too fast on some of
[1:00:05] this stuff tap Heather on the shoulder
[1:00:06] and have her hold up that
[1:00:08] sign chapter 32 Jacob is afraid of Esau
[1:00:12] who he hears is traveling with 400 men
[1:00:14] toward him 400 this can't be good Jacob
[1:00:18] sends ahe a large offering splits up his
[1:00:21] family in case Esau means him harm if he
[1:00:25] kill if he attacks these people the rest
[1:00:26] of us can get away over
[1:00:30] here that night before he meets Esau he
[1:00:33] wrestles with a man we're told all night
[1:00:35] he Demands a blessing the man touches
[1:00:38] Jacob's thigh causing him to limp
[1:00:40] afterwards the man tells Jacob he's
[1:00:42] wrestled with God and prevailed changes
[1:00:46] his name from Jacob to Israel and
[1:00:49] departs from Jacob supp planter heel
[1:00:52] Grabber to Israel with God and departs
[1:00:56] chapter 33 Jacob meets Esau
[1:01:00] peacefully Esau heads home Jacob says
[1:01:03] he'll follow him but instead he goes the
[1:01:05] opposite direction and heads to
[1:01:10] sukot sometime later he travels onto
[1:01:13] shakam buys land and pitches his tent
[1:01:15] there and Builds an altar so he
[1:01:17] sees Esau over here Esau heads down here
[1:01:21] to Mount seir Jacob comes to sukot
[1:01:23] Settles for a while comes over here to
[1:01:27] Shak buys some land and settles
[1:01:32] there well we get to chapter
[1:01:34] 34 Jacob's daughter Dina goes into town
[1:01:38] to meet some other young women she's
[1:01:41] seized and raped by the son of the
[1:01:43] leader of the Town a guy named sheam the
[1:01:45] same name as the town itself his dad
[1:01:48] hamor hore means donkey goes to Jacob to
[1:01:52] try and arrange a marriage
[1:01:56] Dina's brothers are angry and two of
[1:01:59] them in particular Simeon and Levi work
[1:02:01] out a way to disable the men of the Town
[1:02:03] by convincing them they had to be
[1:02:05] circumcised they thus weaponized the
[1:02:08] Govern the Covenant between God and
[1:02:10] Abraham's descendants they turned the
[1:02:13] blessing the Covenant of God turned it
[1:02:15] into a weapon while the men of sheam are
[1:02:18] recovering from this the two brothers go
[1:02:19] into the town kill all the men take the
[1:02:22] women and children and steal the wealth
[1:02:23] of the town of the
[1:02:26] Town Jacob is pretty unhappy about this
[1:02:32] obviously so in chapter 35 God tells
[1:02:36] Jacob who's here in
[1:02:39] she who's here in sheim to go down to
[1:02:41] bethl that's the place where he set up
[1:02:44] that rock where he slept where he saw
[1:02:46] the vision of the
[1:02:51] ladder nobody pursues them Jacob Builds
[1:02:55] an altar God renews his pledge to make
[1:02:57] Jacob's descendants a large multitude
[1:03:00] they leave bethl they're heading south
[1:03:02] towards Isaac down here in Hebron and as
[1:03:05] they get as far here as Bethlehem here's
[1:03:07] Jerusalem so just the other side of
[1:03:08] Jerusalem Rachel goes into labor we
[1:03:12] don't know how old she is she gives
[1:03:14] birth to she calls him benoni and Jacob
[1:03:19] says no he's Benjamin son of my right
[1:03:21] hand she dies in child birth and she's
[1:03:24] buried there according to the Jewish
[1:03:27] Sage
[1:03:28] Rashi Ruben is incensed that Jacob has
[1:03:32] moved BHA Rachel's slave into his tent
[1:03:34] after Rachel's death a huge disrespect
[1:03:37] to his mother
[1:03:38] Leah the Bible tells us that Ruben
[1:03:41] violates bilha sacrificing his position
[1:03:44] as the first born to force Jacob to
[1:03:46] recognize Leah Jacob is enranged of
[1:03:49] course never forgives his son we see
[1:03:51] this in the blessings of chapter 49
[1:03:55] well the family eventually gets to
[1:03:58] heon down here to Isaac Isaac dies at
[1:04:02] age 180 he's buried by Esau and Jacob
[1:04:06] the twins are at this time 120 years old
[1:04:09] chapter 36 lists the descendants of Esau
[1:04:13] I'm not going to read the list also
[1:04:15] known as Edom Esau is the Father the
[1:04:17] paternal ancestor of the they
[1:04:20] play roles further down I think when you
[1:04:23] get to the New Testament and you find
[1:04:24] out where Herod the Great is from that
[1:04:27] you're going to discover that he's from
[1:04:30] Edom chapter 37 The Story begins of
[1:04:34] Joseph it's the focus of Genesis until
[1:04:36] the end of the book we have 14 Chapters
[1:04:39] at least 13 of which are focused around
[1:04:43] Joseph to do Joseph's story Justice we'd
[1:04:46] have to spend I don't know between six
[1:04:49] and 13 Services I
[1:04:52] think but we can't do that
[1:04:54] we can't do it certainly not
[1:04:57] tonight so chapter 37 Joseph has two
[1:05:00] dreams he's about 17 years old which his
[1:05:02] family interprets as them bowing down to
[1:05:04] him his brothers which hate him why
[1:05:09] because his father favors
[1:05:12] him as I said it's a dysfunctional
[1:05:14] family they hate him the more because of
[1:05:17] his
[1:05:18] dreams as you have seen in wi see this
[1:05:21] is a very dysfunctional family but God
[1:05:23] chooses such to show his power as we
[1:05:26] read
[1:05:32] earlier so Jacob sends Joseph to check
[1:05:35] on his brothers who were pastoring the
[1:05:37] flocks near sheam so Jacob's down here
[1:05:39] in heon he thinks that the 10 of his
[1:05:42] sons are supposed to be up here in sheim
[1:05:45] with the flock pastoring them and you
[1:05:47] have to scratch your head and think why
[1:05:49] would they go to sheam I mean this is a
[1:05:52] place where they they did a lot of bad
[1:05:54] stuff and you can't imagine that the
[1:05:57] neighboring people around there are very
[1:05:59] fond of these guys so dangerous place
[1:06:03] well Joseph gets there and he's told
[1:06:06] that no no they've moved on to
[1:06:08] Dothan so Joseph follows on up to Dothan
[1:06:12] to track him down and see how they're
[1:06:14] doing as he approaches them the brothers
[1:06:16] plot to kill him Reuben rescues him by
[1:06:20] suggesting they put him in a pit an
[1:06:22] empty sstn Reuben intends to retrieve
[1:06:25] him later and return him home and if
[1:06:27] you're familiar with the geography
[1:06:28] you'll know that Dothan is its South End
[1:06:30] of the valley of megido and they're
[1:06:32] going to put Joseph in a pit and we read
[1:06:33] in Revelation about somebody else going
[1:06:35] into a pit after a battle at Armageddon
[1:06:38] there's all sorts of interesting uh
[1:06:40] parallels and links going on
[1:06:43] here well they see a caravan of
[1:06:47] ishmaelites from Midian and Judah
[1:06:51] suggests let's not kill him let's sell
[1:06:55] Joseph after all this is our brother we
[1:06:57] don't want to be guilty of his blood so
[1:06:58] they decide that they're going to sell
[1:07:00] him to this Caravan of ishmaelites and
[1:07:03] there's whole another chain of story
[1:07:05] going on there but what happens then is
[1:07:08] they sell Joseph to this Caravan that's
[1:07:11] coming along here they take his special
[1:07:14] coat that his father made for him they
[1:07:16] dip it in the blood of a of a baby goat
[1:07:20] of a kid and they bring her back to
[1:07:23] Jacob and
[1:07:25] who identifies it sorry who identifies
[1:07:28] it as
[1:07:29] Joseph and he goes into mourning Joseph
[1:07:34] is
[1:07:35] taken down to Egypt somewhere down over
[1:07:39] here and sold into slavery to potier the
[1:07:42] captain of the pharaoh's guard in
[1:07:46] Egypt chapter
[1:07:48] 38 about the time Joseph arrives in
[1:07:51] Egypt this chapter tracks the next 20 or
[1:07:54] 21 years of judah's life I want to cover
[1:07:58] this in a little bit of depth because
[1:08:00] it's not often read or
[1:08:03] taught but first a little bit about
[1:08:05] Judah he's the fourth son of Jacob and
[1:08:09] Leah his name means praise it's the
[1:08:12] first mention of Praise in the
[1:08:16] Bible but let's look a little closer
[1:08:19] I've I put up here English
[1:08:22] letters if I can get the right button
[1:08:25] and the Hebrew letters so this is what
[1:08:28] we sometimes call Jehovah yud he B
[1:08:32] that's it's never pronounced in Hebrew
[1:08:34] they say adoni which means
[1:08:37] Lord it means Lord or
[1:08:40] God but you see here judah's name it's
[1:08:44] actually
[1:08:45] Yehuda it's it's not Judah it's Yehuda
[1:08:48] and you can see the yud V with with a d
[1:08:52] adalot the fourth letter of the Hebrew
[1:08:54] alphabet in it meaning praise y DH which
[1:08:58] is also part of that name yadada it
[1:09:00] literally means hand but it means praise
[1:09:02] it also means Thanksgiving it also means
[1:09:08] confession
[1:09:09] Yehuda is the only one of Jacob's sons
[1:09:13] whose name includes the name of God the
[1:09:16] rabbis say that it envelopes God's name
[1:09:19] in Praise well let's just read a little
[1:09:22] bit from chapter 3 38 it came to pass at
[1:09:25] that time after they delivered the coat
[1:09:28] to Jacob that Yehuda went down from his
[1:09:32] Brethren he ran away and turned to a
[1:09:35] certain adullamite whose name was hyra
[1:09:39] so he leaves home lives in a Canaanite
[1:09:42] town and hangs out with this guy that
[1:09:43] becomes his friend in the area be
[1:09:45] careful who your friends are they can
[1:09:48] influence you and you can influence them
[1:09:52] and we can see here that going from heon
[1:09:54] to Abdullah it's you know maybe 10 miles
[1:09:57] you can sit on the ridge where adum is
[1:10:00] and look back in Hebron and at night
[1:10:01] with there's a fire he could see home he
[1:10:04] wasn't that far away but he ran away his
[1:10:09] leaving has a couple of negative effects
[1:10:11] first Jacob has now suffers not only the
[1:10:15] loss of his favorite son Joseph but also
[1:10:17] of his next in line to be the leader of
[1:10:19] the brothers
[1:10:22] Yehuda you say well what about Simeon
[1:10:24] and Levi well we'll get to them
[1:10:28] probably uh when we get to
[1:10:32] Exodus but Reuben has violated things
[1:10:36] he's out of order Simeon and Levi when
[1:10:39] you read the blessings in chapter 49
[1:10:42] you'll discover that Jacob says stay
[1:10:44] away from these guys so Judah would have
[1:10:46] been the next in
[1:10:48] line anyway so he's lost Judah as well
[1:10:51] as Joseph and the rabbis tell us Jacob
[1:10:55] became suspicious that Judah is somehow
[1:10:57] involved in the death of Joseph or why
[1:10:59] else would he run
[1:11:01] away well Judah marries an unnamed
[1:11:03] Canaanite woman and has three sons by
[1:11:06] her the oldest one is named
[1:11:08] ER and marri's a local woman named
[1:11:12] Tamar ER is wicked we don't know in what
[1:11:15] way and God slays him we don't know why
[1:11:18] when or how we just know that he was a
[1:11:20] very bad guy and God slays him the
[1:11:23] Second Son Onan under the laws of levate
[1:11:25] marriage refuses to have a child by her
[1:11:28] levate marriage was a practice they had
[1:11:30] in these days they didn't have social
[1:11:32] security and and all of these other
[1:11:34] sorts of support programs so so a widow
[1:11:38] depended upon her children to for
[1:11:41] support through her final years and so
[1:11:44] forth so it was very
[1:11:46] important so uh the the late marriage
[1:11:50] it's spoken about in Deuteronomy some
[1:11:52] 450 years later was a little bit
[1:11:54] different at at this time but the basic
[1:11:56] concept is that if your brother dies
[1:11:58] without a child and there's another
[1:12:01] brother the next brother and line he has
[1:12:02] to marry the deceased Widow and raise a
[1:12:04] child in the name of the
[1:12:07] deceased um not in the Moses version but
[1:12:11] but likely what's going on here if no
[1:12:13] brother is available then it's the
[1:12:14] father-in-law's duty to produce a child
[1:12:17] with his daughter-in-law to to raise a
[1:12:20] child in the in the name name of of that
[1:12:24] son that died well on doesn't want to
[1:12:27] have a child for
[1:12:28] ER likely because with ER dead and
[1:12:31] without an heir onan's going to have the
[1:12:34] birthright and he'll get the greater
[1:12:36] portion of the inheritance why would he
[1:12:38] want somebody else to have it especially
[1:12:41] not even in his name so uh Onin
[1:12:44] deceitfully uses tomorrow and he abuses
[1:12:48] her God kills him
[1:12:51] too we get to verse 11 then said Judah
[1:12:55] Yehuda to Tamar his daughter-in-law
[1:12:58] remain a widow at thy father's house
[1:13:00] till Shaya my third son my youngest be
[1:13:03] grown for he said lest peradventure
[1:13:06] perhaps he die also as his Brethren did
[1:13:10] tomorrow went and dwelt in her father's
[1:13:12] house so Judah sends her away until his
[1:13:15] third son Shaya will be old enough to
[1:13:18] marry well Shaya getss old
[1:13:21] enough but Judah never s for tomorrow
[1:13:25] after all his first two sons are dead
[1:13:28] after marrying her he's probably
[1:13:30] thinking
[1:13:31] well this lady is cursed there's
[1:13:34] something going on here and if I give my
[1:13:36] third son to her he's going to die too
[1:13:38] this is a bad deal she can just stay at
[1:13:40] her father-in-law's house and I'll just
[1:13:42] keep Sheila over here and and and
[1:13:44] that'll be
[1:13:45] fine so there's a lesson that God is
[1:13:49] teaching Judah like Jacob Judah has lost
[1:13:53] two two sons like Jacob who dots on
[1:13:57] Joseph his 11th son Jude is now
[1:13:59] protecting his young
[1:14:02] son God's teaching Judah something here
[1:14:05] very painful lesson chapter 12 in the
[1:14:08] process of time the daughter of shua
[1:14:12] shua being judah's father-in-law the
[1:14:15] daughter of shua J judah's wife died
[1:14:17] Judah was
[1:14:18] comforted he went up to his sheep
[1:14:22] shearers to timna he he and his friend
[1:14:24] hyra the adullamite so judah's wife died
[1:14:28] like like Jacob Judah now knows the
[1:14:31] grief of losing his wife sheep sharing
[1:14:34] is a time for celebration and the local
[1:14:36] religion in practice it's time for Deery
[1:14:39] it was told Tamar saying Behold thy
[1:14:42] father-in-law goeth up to timna to
[1:14:44] sheare his
[1:14:47] sheep here's another gigantic journey of
[1:14:50] 10 miles from ulum down here in the
[1:14:53] plain to
[1:14:55] timna so we read she put her widow's
[1:14:59] garments from offer covered her with a
[1:15:01] veil wrapped herself sat in an open
[1:15:03] place which is by the weight of timna
[1:15:05] for she saw that Shaya was grown and she
[1:15:07] was not given unto him to wife Judah is
[1:15:10] violating the levate law which he had
[1:15:12] promised to
[1:15:14] fulfill when Judah saw her he thought
[1:15:16] her to be in Harlot because she'd
[1:15:18] covered her face she knows her
[1:15:20] father-in-law pretty well he red her by
[1:15:23] the way and said go too I pray thee let
[1:15:25] me come in unto thee he knew not she was
[1:15:27] his daughter-in-law and she said what
[1:15:29] will you give me that thou mayest come
[1:15:30] in unto me and he said I will send thee
[1:15:33] a kid from The Flock and she seeing he
[1:15:36] had no goats with him said wilt thou
[1:15:38] give me a pledge till thou send it and
[1:15:40] he said what pledge shall I give thee
[1:15:42] and she said thy signant the ring you
[1:15:45] used to for legal documents thy
[1:15:48] bracelets and thy staff that is in thine
[1:15:51] hand and he gave it her and came under
[1:15:53] her and she conceived by him she arose
[1:15:56] went away laid away her veil from her
[1:15:59] put on the garments of her widowhood
[1:16:00] telling the world of judah's
[1:16:04] faithlessness well Judah goes to timna
[1:16:06] he sees his Harlot by the road
[1:16:08] approaching bargain for her favors has
[1:16:10] nothing of commercial value gives her
[1:16:12] his staff race its ins signant ring
[1:16:14] until he can arrange payment in the form
[1:16:16] of a kid from his flock of goats those
[1:16:19] items bear his name the symbols of his
[1:16:22] authority when he sends the payment a a
[1:16:24] a goat kid to get his stuff back the
[1:16:27] woman can't be found he doesn't know
[1:16:30] that tomorrow was the woman that he
[1:16:32] thought was the
[1:16:34] Harlot it came to pass about three
[1:16:36] months after that it was told Judah
[1:16:39] saying Tomar thy daughter-in-law hath
[1:16:42] played the Harlot and also behold she is
[1:16:44] with child by wh Judah said bring her
[1:16:47] forth let her be
[1:16:50] burnt such a vile
[1:16:53] cruel way to take another's life did you
[1:16:58] really think she was
[1:16:59] cursed perhaps but like the story in the
[1:17:03] Gospel of John no one seems interested
[1:17:05] in finding the male
[1:17:11] involved and now we're going to see a
[1:17:13] change when she was brought forth she
[1:17:16] could have done a lot of things she
[1:17:18] could have publicly identified
[1:17:20] Judah but she put her life in the hands
[1:17:24] of the one condemning her to an awful
[1:17:27] fate she sent to her father-in-law
[1:17:29] saying by the man whose these are I am
[1:17:33] with child and she said discern I pray
[1:17:36] thee whose are these the signant the
[1:17:39] bracelet the staff she hands him this
[1:17:42] stuff he
[1:17:43] realized that she tricked him to raise a
[1:17:47] child for her according to leverate law
[1:17:50] she forced him to do his leverate duty
[1:17:52] for for her to have a
[1:17:54] son discern this Hebrew word is exactly
[1:17:58] the word that's used when the brothers
[1:17:59] bring the coat to Jacob and they discern
[1:18:02] is this Joseph's coat it's also to
[1:18:06] examine to acknowledge and so forth
[1:18:09] verse 26 and Jacob acknowledged that
[1:18:12] same word he discerned he identifi them
[1:18:14] and said she now he's not talking to her
[1:18:18] he doesn't say thou no he's talking to
[1:18:21] the crowd that's gathered for this
[1:18:24] horrible thing they're going to do he's
[1:18:26] making a public proclamation of his
[1:18:29] guilt and her
[1:18:31] innocence she has been more righteous
[1:18:33] than I because that I gave her not to
[1:18:36] Shayla my
[1:18:38] son and he knew her again no more Judah
[1:18:40] is a changed man and his Rebellion he
[1:18:44] was about to kill his own unborn
[1:18:47] children or Child by
[1:18:50] fire she Bears twin boys Zarah for ER FZ
[1:18:56] for Judah FZ will be in the Messianic
[1:19:00] genealogy and it's kind of curious he
[1:19:02] got twin boys but one of them is his
[1:19:05] grandson and one of them is the uncle of
[1:19:07] the other it's uh it's a kind of a
[1:19:09] strange relationship for twins but but
[1:19:11] there you
[1:19:13] go the text doesn't say but Judah
[1:19:16] returns home with Tamar Shayla and the
[1:19:20] twins meanwhile now we roll back to 20
[1:19:23] or 21 years to the story of Joseph most
[1:19:25] of you are familiar with this at some
[1:19:27] level it's a quarter of the Book of
[1:19:29] Genesis but we'll quickly skim through
[1:19:32] it Joseph worked Piper's Fields that's
[1:19:34] who he was sold to he did well for his
[1:19:36] master he's promoted to overseer of his
[1:19:39] house Piper's wife tries to seduce
[1:19:41] Joseph fails and claims she was attacked
[1:19:43] by him the opposite of Judah Joseph goes
[1:19:47] to prison he's put in charge and again
[1:19:49] he's successful in that context chapter
[1:19:52] 40 Pharaoh's Chief Baker and Butler are
[1:19:55] put in the very same prison under
[1:19:58] Joseph's care they each have a dream
[1:20:01] which Joseph interprets accurately the
[1:20:03] baker is to be executed the butler
[1:20:05] returned to his office this happens
[1:20:07] exactly as Joseph said and then there's
[1:20:10] a blank space between chapter 40 and
[1:20:12] chapter 41 two years pass you can
[1:20:16] imagine Joseph is in the prison they're
[1:20:17] thinking okay well he's going to tell
[1:20:19] them about this and it's going to be
[1:20:20] good and I'm going to get out of this
[1:20:22] place and day passes and a week passes
[1:20:24] and a month passes and a
[1:20:27] year
[1:20:29] passes and two years two years later
[1:20:33] Pharaoh dreams he's troubled by what he
[1:20:35] dreams no one can interpret the dreams
[1:20:39] and then the butler remembers Joseph
[1:20:40] interpreted his dream accurately Joseph
[1:20:43] is summoned he interprets Pharaoh's
[1:20:44] dream there's going to be seven years of
[1:20:46] plenty followed by seven years of severe
[1:20:50] famine as a result he's put in charge of
[1:20:53] Egypt second only to Pharaoh he's given
[1:20:55] an Egyptian wife has two sons manasse
[1:20:59] which means causing to
[1:21:01] forget and Ephraim or Ephraim which
[1:21:04] means double
[1:21:06] fruit the seven years of plenty ensue
[1:21:09] and then the famine begins it's in the
[1:21:11] entire region not just Egypt Joseph is
[1:21:14] in charge of grain
[1:21:16] distribution chapter 42 the famine has
[1:21:19] reached Canan and Jacob sends his sons
[1:21:21] except Benjamin to buy grain in Egypt
[1:21:24] they come to Joseph they don't know who
[1:21:25] he is he accuses them of being
[1:21:29] spies he puts them in prison for three
[1:21:33] days over here's what's going on he
[1:21:35] discovers that Reuben was against the
[1:21:37] plot to kill or sell him so when he
[1:21:40] sends them back he keeps the number two
[1:21:42] son Simeon as a hostage he sends them
[1:21:45] the way with a requirement that they
[1:21:47] bring Benjamin with them when they
[1:21:49] return He arranges to have their payment
[1:21:52] put back in the their sacks of grain
[1:21:53] they returned to Canan tell Jacob that
[1:21:55] Benjamin has to go with them next time
[1:21:58] Reuben tries but fails to convince Jacob
[1:22:00] to send them back with
[1:22:03] Benjamin chapter
[1:22:04] 43 Jacob's Clan runs out of food as the
[1:22:07] famine progresses and the changed
[1:22:11] Judah steps
[1:22:14] up Jacob is not about to send Benjamin
[1:22:17] down Judah spoke un saying the man did
[1:22:20] solemnly protest unto us saying you
[1:22:23] shall not see my face except your
[1:22:25] brother be with you if thou Wilt send
[1:22:27] our brother with us we'll go down and
[1:22:30] we'll buy thee
[1:22:32] food but if thou will not send him we
[1:22:35] will not go down the man said unto us
[1:22:38] you shall not see my face except your
[1:22:40] brother be with you and Israel said
[1:22:43] wherefore D she so ill with me as to
[1:22:47] tell the man whether ye had yet a
[1:22:51] brother and they said the man asked us
[1:22:54] straightly of our state and of our
[1:22:56] Kindred saying is your father yet alive
[1:22:58] have ye another brother we told him
[1:23:00] according to the tenor of these words
[1:23:03] could we certainly know that he would
[1:23:04] say bring your brother
[1:23:06] down Judah said to Israel's father send
[1:23:09] the lad with me and we will arise and go
[1:23:12] that we may live and not die both we and
[1:23:15] thou and also our little ones if if we
[1:23:18] don't go we're going to starve to death
[1:23:21] Benjamin's going to be dead along with
[1:23:23] all of
[1:23:24] us the changed Judah I will be shity for
[1:23:29] him of my hand shalt thou require him if
[1:23:34] I bring him not unto thee and set him
[1:23:36] before thee then let me bear the blame
[1:23:41] forever reluctantly realizing they'll
[1:23:44] all die including Benjamin if they don't
[1:23:46] get more grain Jacob allows them to
[1:23:49] return to Egypt he sends Benjamin with
[1:23:51] him along with double payment for the
[1:23:53] Grain and some gifts for the man that
[1:23:55] they don't know is
[1:23:57] Joseph Joseph sets A Feast for them in
[1:24:00] his house he brings Simeon out of the
[1:24:02] prison and he sets them in order from
[1:24:06] oldest to youngest this amazes the
[1:24:09] brothers the Bible says they're amazed
[1:24:11] why are they
[1:24:13] amazed the SE 11 guys born over space of
[1:24:16] seven years all but Benjamin in their
[1:24:20] 40s why would they be amazed well this
[1:24:23] is where my inner nerd has to come
[1:24:26] out if you have 11 people and you put
[1:24:30] them in order or put them in another
[1:24:33] order how many different ways can you
[1:24:35] seat 11 different
[1:24:37] people no
[1:24:41] guesses
[1:24:43] 39,9 2016, 1800 different ways now love
[1:24:48] you want to get up here and try all
[1:24:49] these combinations will be here for a
[1:24:51] very long time so the odds are about 1
[1:24:54] in40 million that he could guess
[1:24:57] correctly one in40 million well this
[1:25:00] helps when he has them convinced he has
[1:25:02] powers of divination chapter 44 Joseph
[1:25:05] arranges for their money to put in their
[1:25:07] grain sacks sends them all on their way
[1:25:09] but also his silver
[1:25:12] cup this look yeah well that's plastic
[1:25:15] but his was silver that it's his
[1:25:17] divination cup uh and he has that put in
[1:25:21] his but the silver cup is to be put into
[1:25:23] Benjamin's sack so shortly after they
[1:25:26] leave Joseph sends his Steward to
[1:25:27] overtake them accuse him of theft of his
[1:25:30] divination cup find the cup and bring
[1:25:33] Benjamin
[1:25:34] back the brothers are all shocked and
[1:25:37] they all return with Benjamin to
[1:25:41] Joseph and now we
[1:25:44] see the changed Judah the new Judah not
[1:25:48] just pleading with his dad in Canaan but
[1:25:51] following through
[1:25:52] in Egypt with this strange powerful man
[1:25:57] I have to read this section of the story
[1:25:59] Genesis 44 Verse 18 then Judah came near
[1:26:02] unto Joseph and
[1:26:06] said oh my Lord let thy servant I pray
[1:26:09] thee speak a word in my Lord's ears let
[1:26:11] not thine anger burn against thy servant
[1:26:13] for even as Pharaoh my Lord asked his
[1:26:17] servants saying have you a father or a
[1:26:20] brother and we said unto my Lord we have
[1:26:23] a father an old man and a child of his
[1:26:25] old age a little one and his brother is
[1:26:28] dead and he alone is left of his mother
[1:26:31] and his father loves him and and you
[1:26:34] said to your to thy servants bring him
[1:26:36] down unto me that I may set my eyes upon
[1:26:38] him and and we said unto my Lord the lad
[1:26:40] cannot leave his father if he should
[1:26:43] leave his father his father would die
[1:26:45] and th say unto thy servants except your
[1:26:48] youngest brother come down with you ye
[1:26:50] shall see my face no more' and it came
[1:26:53] to pass when we came up unto thy servant
[1:26:55] my father we told him the words of my
[1:26:57] Lord and our father said oh go again and
[1:27:01] and buy us a little food and we said we
[1:27:05] cannot go down if our youngest brother
[1:27:07] be with us then we will go down for we
[1:27:10] may not see the man's face except our
[1:27:12] youngest brother be with
[1:27:13] us and thy servant my father said unto
[1:27:17] us you know that my wife bear me two
[1:27:20] sons and the one went out from me and I
[1:27:23] said surely he's torn in pieces and I
[1:27:25] saw him not since if you take this also
[1:27:28] from me and Mischief befall them you
[1:27:31] shall bring down my gray hairs with
[1:27:32] sorrow to the
[1:27:35] grave now therefore I come to thy
[1:27:38] servant when I come to my thy servant my
[1:27:41] father and the lad be not with us seeing
[1:27:44] that his life is bound up in the lad's
[1:27:47] life it shall come to pass when he seeth
[1:27:49] the lad is not with us he'll die
[1:27:53] thy servants shall bring down the gray
[1:27:55] hairs of thy servant our father with
[1:27:57] sorrow to the Grave for thy servant May
[1:28:02] Judah I became shy for the lad unto my
[1:28:05] father saying if I bring him not unto
[1:28:07] thee then I shall bear the blame to my
[1:28:10] father
[1:28:11] forever now therefore I pray thee I beg
[1:28:16] of you let thy servant let me abide
[1:28:21] instead of the L had a bondman a slave
[1:28:24] to my Lord and let the lad go up with
[1:28:27] his brethren for how shall I go to my
[1:28:30] father and the lad be not with me lest
[1:28:34] peradventure I see the evil that shall
[1:28:36] come on my
[1:28:38] father Judah pleads for
[1:28:41] Benjamin and ask to be substituted and
[1:28:45] become Joseph slave outlining the grief
[1:28:48] that will kill Jacob if Benjamin does
[1:28:50] not return
[1:28:53] Judah who campaigned to sell Joseph into
[1:28:56] slavery in Egypt is now pleading to
[1:28:59] become a slave to Joseph in
[1:29:03] Egypt What A
[1:29:07] Change chapter
[1:29:10] 45 Joseph tells his brothers who he is
[1:29:13] tells them there's still five years of
[1:29:15] famine to come to bring Jacob and their
[1:29:18] families to Egypt and he will take care
[1:29:20] of them Pharaoh agrees to all this and
[1:29:23] sends wagons and gifts with them to
[1:29:27] Jacob chapter
[1:29:29] 46 Israel took his journey with all that
[1:29:32] he had and came to Beva and offered
[1:29:36] sacrifices unto the god of his father
[1:29:40] Isaac so here's heon where they've been
[1:29:43] they get as far as
[1:29:45] Beva it's not all that great of a
[1:29:48] distance but remember this is the Jacob
[1:29:50] that ran away
[1:29:53] was happy to leave Canaan in fear of
[1:29:55] Esau his
[1:29:57] brother now he's back in the land he as
[1:30:01] badly as he wants to see Joseph he will
[1:30:05] not leave unless the Lord gives him
[1:30:08] leave he won't leave the land even for
[1:30:12] something as important to him as this
[1:30:16] God spake unto Israel in the visions of
[1:30:18] the night and said Jacob Jacob and he
[1:30:21] said here I am and he said I am God the
[1:30:26] god of thy father fear not to go down
[1:30:29] into Egypt for I will there make of thee
[1:30:33] a great nation I will go down with thee
[1:30:36] into Egypt and I will also surely bring
[1:30:39] thee up again and Joseph shall put his
[1:30:42] hand upon thine
[1:30:45] eyes right when you die Joseph will be
[1:30:48] there to close your eyes Jacob though he
[1:30:50] longs to see Joseph won't leave without
[1:30:53] permission from God Jacob has changed
[1:30:55] too Jacob and the whole clan traveled to
[1:30:58] Egypt to Goan and the Nile Delta the
[1:31:01] richest Farmland in Egypt the clan
[1:31:04] totaling 70 Joseph is reunited with
[1:31:07] Jacob and prepares to bring him before
[1:31:10] Pharaoh chapter
[1:31:12] 47 the family
[1:31:14] comes before pharaoh and settles in
[1:31:18] Goan meanwhile chapter 47 people run out
[1:31:22] of money to buy Grain Joseph says well
[1:31:24] then give me the deed give me the deed
[1:31:26] to your ranch right so he acquires all
[1:31:29] the land for pharaoh and after that they
[1:31:33] don't have land they don't have money
[1:31:35] they're still of H and he says
[1:31:37] well you could be Pharaoh slaves you
[1:31:39] could be bondmen we're going to put some
[1:31:40] heavy taxes on you for for all
[1:31:44] time so Joseph makes Pharaoh very secure
[1:31:48] and very powerful well Jacob nears death
[1:31:52] makes Joseph swear to return his body to
[1:31:54] Canaan for burial chapter 48 is a little
[1:31:58] unusual here Jacob blesses Joseph's sons
[1:32:02] and claims them as his own he says eph
[1:32:04] and Manassa they're mine I have 14 Sons
[1:32:07] now these are my sons if you have any
[1:32:09] more Sons they're your sons but these
[1:32:11] two are
[1:32:12] mine he tells Joseph he too will return
[1:32:15] to Canan and gives Joseph the right of
[1:32:17] the firstborn the double portion
[1:32:19] consider when they later on when we read
[1:32:21] about the Book of Joshua and you'll find
[1:32:24] that Ephraim and Manasseh each get an
[1:32:27] inheritance a division of the land so
[1:32:30] Joseph thus through Manasseh and Ephraim
[1:32:33] gets that double
[1:32:35] portion chapter 49 Jacob blesses his
[1:32:39] sons we'll just read about Judah now and
[1:32:42] we'll read about another perhaps when we
[1:32:45] look at Exodus Genesis chter
[1:32:48] 49 verse 8 Judah
[1:32:52] UD
[1:32:54] Yehuda Thou Art he whom thy Brethren
[1:32:57] shall
[1:32:59] praise thy hand shall be in the neck of
[1:33:02] thine enemies thy father's children
[1:33:05] shall bow down before
[1:33:08] thee Judah is a lion's welp from the
[1:33:12] prey my son Thou Art gone up he stooped
[1:33:15] down he couched as a lion as an old lion
[1:33:18] who shall Rouse him
[1:33:20] up the scepter shall not depart from
[1:33:24] Judah no or walk ever from between his
[1:33:27] feet until Shido means tranquil secure
[1:33:31] the
[1:33:31] Messiah come and unto him the Messiah
[1:33:35] shall the Gathering of the people be
[1:33:38] binding his fo unto the vine and an
[1:33:40] ass's cult unto the choice Vine he
[1:33:43] washed his garments and wine and his
[1:33:45] clothes and the blood of grapes his eyes
[1:33:48] shall be red with wine and his teeth
[1:33:51] white
[1:33:52] with
[1:33:53] milk he charges them to bury him
[1:33:57] alongside Leah in the Tomb Abraham
[1:34:00] purchased as we read when we began this
[1:34:03] evening and Jacob dies at age
[1:34:07] 147 chapter 50 Jacob is inbombed and his
[1:34:12] body returned to Canan for
[1:34:14] burial Upon returning to Egypt the
[1:34:17] family fears Joseph will turn against
[1:34:19] them Joseph takes care of them instead
[1:34:23] and finally in chapter
[1:34:26] 50 Joseph said unto his Brethren I
[1:34:30] die God will surely visit you and bring
[1:34:34] you out of this land unto the land which
[1:34:38] he swear to Abraham to Isaac and to
[1:34:43] Jacob Joseph took an oath the children
[1:34:46] of Israel saying God will surely visit
[1:34:49] you and you shall carry up my bones from
[1:34:53] hence Joseph believed those
[1:34:58] promises so Joseph died being 110 years
[1:35:02] old they inbombed him and he was put in
[1:35:06] a coffin in Egypt what a contrast in the
[1:35:09] beginning God in a coffin in
[1:35:14] Egypt God's testimony we read of Joseph
[1:35:18] in the New Testament if the musicians
[1:35:20] would please come
[1:35:23] Hebrews 11 verse 22 we read by faith
[1:35:27] Joseph when he died made mention of the
[1:35:31] departing of the children of Israel and
[1:35:33] gave commandment concerning his
[1:35:37] bones speaking of
[1:35:39] Faith of Our brief overview of
[1:35:42] Genesis the theme that resonates
[1:35:45] throughout is captured I Believe by Paul
[1:35:48] in his letter to the Ephesians
[1:35:53] Ephesians 2:8 for by grace are ye saved
[1:35:59] through faith and that not of yourselves
[1:36:03] it's a gift of God it's not of Works
[1:36:07] lest any man should
[1:36:10] boast
[1:36:11] Genesis Grace and
[1:36:14] Faith Grace is not a new testament
[1:36:17] Doctrine a change in the way how God
[1:36:20] dealt with people we've seen it in the
[1:36:22] Book of Genesis the foundations it's a
[1:36:25] major theme of this first book I'd like
[1:36:27] us to close this evening turn the
[1:36:30] service over to brother Aaron and sing

[1:40:59] week and now she's in pain so she was
[1:41:02] asking us to remember her in prayer so
[1:41:06] remember that
[1:41:08] too how many
[1:41:10] years was that space about that you
[1:41:13] talked about
[1:41:15] T from
[1:41:17] Abraham
[1:41:19] 3 250 years about 250 years in about an
[1:41:24] hour it's not too bad it's a lot of
[1:41:28] information to
[1:41:30] absorb but I I just kept thinking what a
[1:41:34] mighty God we
[1:41:35] serve just watching over keeping and and
[1:41:39] dealing with people that failed people
[1:41:42] that did wrong people that didn't keep
[1:41:44] word people that turned their own
[1:41:46] brother
[1:41:47] in and I just thought about that and I
[1:41:50] said oh God you've been so good to
[1:41:52] us and today we see where Israel
[1:41:56] stands he's a promise he's made a
[1:41:59] promise to
[1:42:00] Israel I'll watch over you I'll keep
[1:42:03] you God does things something totally
[1:42:06] different than we would think he should
[1:42:07] do it but God knows what he's doing so

[1:42:14] stand amen there was about three or four
