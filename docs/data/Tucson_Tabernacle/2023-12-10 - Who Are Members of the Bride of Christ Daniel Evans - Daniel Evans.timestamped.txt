[44:02] amen thank thank
[44:05] you what an honor what a blessing to be
[44:09] able to hold a little baby like that
[44:11] what a miracle we think about we think
[44:14] about a child and how these these babies
[44:18] are formed in the womb and and then
[44:21] they're born and wow they're just these
[44:24] beautiful little helpless little
[44:27] creatures so so many times the Bible
[44:29] Well Jesus said he says except that we
[44:32] become like them we won't enter into the
[44:36] kingdom we have to become like that
[44:38] little baby that's just so dependent on
[44:40] Mom and Dad we have to be
[44:42] dependent like like that baby with our
[44:45] Lord Jesus that's that's the ultimate
[44:48] goal that's a Christian is to become
[44:50] it's strange when you grow up you think
[44:52] you're more dependent you're more
[44:53] independent but when you grow up in the
[44:55] Lord you become more dependent on
[44:59] God been uh praying this week on a on a
[45:03] number of things and we're December
[45:05] seems to be the month of decision for
[45:09] for all of us really we we're closing
[45:11] out the year and and um a lot of times
[45:14] we're choosing what health insurance we
[45:16] have for the next year and we have to we
[45:18] have to do that we're for the for the
[45:21] the students they're deciding what
[45:23] classes that they're going to take next
[45:24] semester and
[45:27] even to the point what Christmas gifts
[45:29] we're going to buy if you do that and
[45:31] there's just so many decisions that we
[45:34] face in December this time of year and
[45:37] it's it seems like it's it's a pressure
[45:41] full time for for many of us right now
[45:44] we're
[45:45] deciding on uh the church renovation
[45:48] we're making starting to make uh some
[45:50] decisions in that way and
[45:53] and I know I've waited about a year but
[45:56] we're also going to move forward in
[45:58] electing the church officials in the
[46:00] book of Jan or in the uh the book of
[46:04] January I don't think there's a book of
[46:06] January in here a month of
[46:10] January and we I I've made the decision
[46:14] to devote many of our Wednesday nights
[46:17] to to studying this Bible and to give an
[46:22] overview of the books that are in the
[46:25] Bible so when we come on Wednesday night
[46:27] or we stream in every book I want us all
[46:31] to remember something about that book
[46:33] what that book's about and going on in
[46:36] that direction and I did get one
[46:40] complaint um about our Wednesday night
[46:43] services and brother Lyall this one was
[46:46] about
[46:47] you I won't tell you who it's
[46:49] from um but she was related to the
[46:53] garas she said brother Daniel you're not
[46:56] giving brother Lyall enough
[46:58] [Laughter]
[46:59] time so so brother Lyall if we want to
[47:03] split these up into two Services we C we
[47:05] can do it we just want we want the
[47:07] people we're not digging in to digging
[47:11] into the foundation of the book we're
[47:13] not getting digging into the specifics
[47:15] we're giving an
[47:17] overview of it and and then the specific
[47:20] sometimes that's what Sunday morning is
[47:22] for is to take a couple scriptures and
[47:25] then expound upon those but we want to
[47:28] be able to give the um the church a uh a
[47:32] good understanding and I'd like to say
[47:35] about this church and and making
[47:38] changes
[47:41] um I believe something special has
[47:44] happened here I know I've said that
[47:47] before but I've
[47:50] seen I've seen an amazing amazing thing
[47:52] and I haven't seen it in the 52 years of
[47:54] my life
[47:57] is we've seen the a group of people who
[48:02] were
[48:03] steadfast in the way that they thought
[48:06] the way that they
[48:07] believed and I've seen people start to
[48:13] be more
[48:14] accepting and more
[48:17] loving and welcoming more people in and
[48:23] saying if you don't necessarily look
[48:26] like me or act like me we still want to
[48:29] worship the same Lord Jesus and friends
[48:32] I've never I've never seen
[48:34] that in my whole life and I've been
[48:37] associated with brother brandom's
[48:39] message since I was born in 1971 my
[48:42] family since about
[48:44] 1950 I've never seen this in my life a
[48:49] group of of people that have just been
[48:51] so caring and so loving and so willing
[48:54] to give I believe that's the very Spirit
[48:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ himself I
[49:00] really do the church is for people that
[49:04] need to get
[49:05] better otherwise why would you need a
[49:07] church that's it's that's what it's for
[49:10] it's for us to come to improve on our
[49:13] lives and and of course get closer to
[49:15] the
[49:16] Lord I'm not saying I know that I've
[49:20] I've preached pretty hard I preach I
[49:23] preach on both sides I try to keep a
[49:24] balance I preach preach against sin and
[49:27] and and moving the ways of the world and
[49:30] I also preach against legalism over on
[49:33] this side and say be careful with that
[49:35] legalism but I'm not saying living that
[49:38] life is in any way wrong I'd be a
[49:41] hypocrite
[49:43] we homeschooled our
[49:46] kids you we didn't have a television we
[49:49] didn't we didn't have any movies in our
[49:51] lives we we tried to walk this perfect
[49:55] line in growing up and in raising our
[49:59] children we did the best that we could
[50:02] and trying to we we went to church every
[50:06] single
[50:07] service we even went so
[50:11] far as I wouldn't even and my family
[50:16] wouldn't even listen to any Minister
[50:20] other than brother brandom himself
[50:22] that's how far we were on this side but
[50:28] I have to tell you that in growing in
[50:32] our and raising our children and it was
[50:34] such a blessing that we would have I'd
[50:38] come home from
[50:39] work and Stephanie would have things
[50:43] ready the kids would be meeting me at
[50:44] the door there and I'd come in they
[50:47] they'd love on Daddy and we'd have
[50:50] dinner and then we would go into the
[50:51] living room and and we would have our
[50:54] Bible study
[50:56] and we would talk about the Lord and
[50:58] talk about his word and and we just had
[51:02] such a a good a good life and and I'm
[51:07] just I'm so grateful that the lord gave
[51:09] us that and what I want is that joy that
[51:13] we have had with our children I want
[51:16] everyone to have that same Joy even if
[51:19] you don't have parents that that that
[51:22] are believers even if you don't whatever
[51:24] situation you're in I want everyone to
[51:27] to receive that same thing that I
[51:30] received that my children received and I
[51:34] want this church to be able to provide
[51:36] it I want to have those Bible studies
[51:40] for the Youth and for all of us for the
[51:43] Sisters if you want to have a Bible
[51:45] study yes come in we we'll get that
[51:47] together for men's meetings for the
[51:49] brothers I want I want the kids to study
[51:51] the Bible I want you to have that
[51:53] because it was such a blessing to my
[51:55] family and we had such
[51:58] joy we made mistakes as parents and all
[52:02] of us would want to go
[52:04] back and change things that we did but
[52:08] God still He blesses our motives He
[52:12] blesses our efforts we try and we're
[52:15] doing the best that we can and he knows
[52:17] that and and we make mistakes and and
[52:20] and sometimes we'll suffer for our
[52:22] mistakes and our children will suffer
[52:23] but God knows
[52:25] God takes care of it all he knows our
[52:29] heart there was a
[52:32] uh
[52:34] suggestion that that came in about a
[52:36] month ago and it was put in the offering
[52:38] box and uh it didn't have a name
[52:41] associated with it I like it when it has
[52:42] a name because then I can go to the
[52:45] person and say hey what do you mean or a
[52:47] little bit more and so many people come
[52:49] to me and say well the people are saying
[52:53] don't ever come to me and say that
[52:57] because my first question is going to be
[52:59] who and if you don't tell me I'm going
[53:01] to assume it's
[53:03] you so but anyways there was a a a
[53:06] suggestion came in the offering Box
[53:08] about a month ago
[53:10] and I looked at it and like everything I
[53:13] I took it seriously and I've been
[53:15] praying about it and it said something
[53:18] on the order of I don't remember the
[53:20] exact I have I have the I have the paper
[53:23] um but it said something like we should
[53:25] take a service a week like we were doing
[53:27] for the book of Acts and we should take
[53:30] brother brandom's message and break it
[53:33] down like we did in the book of Acts and
[53:37] I pondered that suggestion and back and
[53:39] forth and and I i' I've prayed about it
[53:42] and I I've
[53:44] I've gone back and forth in my mind how
[53:46] we could do it but one thing I don't
[53:51] want to
[53:52] do is I don't want to fall into into the
[53:55] Trap that so many quote message
[54:01] churches have fallen into and dove into
[54:06] a quote here and a quote there and a
[54:09] quote here string them all together and
[54:11] build a Doctrine out of them I don't
[54:14] want to do that brother brandom when he
[54:17] when he preached don't forget this is
[54:20] different than than your Bible it was
[54:23] presented in a different way it's an
[54:26] audio it is preaching and here in the
[54:30] Bible every single book every single
[54:33] word that was written was
[54:35] reviewed and whoever the prophet was or
[54:38] the Scribe had a chance to look it over
[54:40] and this was exactly what they wanted
[54:43] exactly what God wanted in here brother
[54:47] brandham was preaching under the
[54:49] anointing and he was his message wasn't
[54:53] meant to dissect every little thing and
[54:56] even brother brandom didn't he said you
[54:58] make me nervous when you do that but yet
[55:01] we go and do it and I don't want to move
[55:04] into that
[55:05] direction because that's you know what
[55:08] happens when that then the church
[55:11] dies and friends I've seen it all over
[55:13] the world I've seen it so I want to be
[55:18] careful in doing
[55:20] that I was so I was looking in some old
[55:24] notes
[55:25] and I don't know this came from years
[55:29] ago but I wrote this and I believe the
[55:33] Lord just brought it back to my
[55:35] attention he I said this this is
[55:37] something I wrote we call ourselves and
[55:40] I quote message
[55:42] Believers and we know that God sent a
[55:45] modern day Prophet to call us out of the
[55:47] denominational system and into the truth
[55:50] but do we really know what the truth is
[55:56] do we really understand what that
[55:58] messenger was supposed to
[56:01] do to have a proper understanding of
[56:05] what God did and is doing in our day and
[56:09] to build a strong church we must have an
[56:13] understanding of this
[56:15] book I don't know why I I wrote that but
[56:19] I don't know what I was what I was
[56:21] thinking
[56:23] but it as I read that it brought my
[56:28] testimony and how I've come this walk
[56:33] and like I
[56:34] said I've lived my life after I gave my
[56:39] heart to the Lord as as a young man I've
[56:42] tried to live a very very structured and
[56:45] legalistic life and I I have for the
[56:46] most part lived that
[56:48] way and like I said it's been a blessing
[56:52] to me and it's been a blessing to my
[56:53] kids
[56:55] and in going through my
[56:59] life as I said I
[57:02] never I never missed a service but we
[57:04] never also never heard a minister we
[57:07] were always listening to brother bram's
[57:08] tapes in service
[57:11] so I was in the ministry as you know in
[57:15] in in Jeffersonville
[57:17] Indiana and Stephanie and the kids were
[57:22] here in
[57:23] Tucson and they were um visiting marily
[57:27] and Rod and and our family and I had to
[57:32] go back early to go back to work
[57:34] so this was this was in January and in
[57:40] 2012 and I was working late at
[57:43] night and I um was going through my my
[57:47] voicemails and and one of the things
[57:49] that I had the honor of doing is I had
[57:51] the honor of studying this message and
[57:54] then help helping other people that
[57:55] would call and they had a question on
[57:57] their heart a doctrinal question or
[57:59] something about maybe William brandom
[58:02] lied about this or he was wrong about
[58:04] that or or I'm having marital problems
[58:06] with my children whatever it was those
[58:08] questions would generally come to me and
[58:10] I would go through my voicemails and if
[58:12] if it was an email i' I'd take care of
[58:14] it or or a phone call I would call them
[58:17] back and and I got a I got a voicemail
[58:20] on my phone from a man that had a very
[58:23] strong Jewish
[58:25] accent sister Barber I told you this
[58:27] testimony the other day and it changed
[58:30] my
[58:31] life this man just left his name and he
[58:35] left his phone number and it was late at
[58:38] night I was I was working I didn't have
[58:40] anybody to go home to so I just worked
[58:42] late and tried to get as much work as as
[58:43] I could done and and I saw that his um
[58:46] area code was from Hawaii so I said oh
[58:50] well it's the middle of the day there so
[58:52] I I called him up and he tells
[58:58] me his
[59:01] testimony and like I said very very
[59:04] obvious he was Jewish he told me he was
[59:07] Jewish right away he was he was he lived
[59:10] in Jerusalem for a long time and but he
[59:12] was in San Diego as a young man
[59:16] and some he was he was sitting on the
[59:19] beach on a bench and someone walked up
[59:22] to him it was in the morning and someone
[59:24] gave him one of those little green
[59:27] Gideon Bibles you know which ones I'm
[59:29] talking about and gave him that and he
[59:32] looked up and he said he said I don't
[59:35] want it he says I'm
[59:36] Jewish and they said
[59:39] well you should read this and he says he
[59:43] said no I don't want to read it he says
[59:45] I'm not Catholic I don't want to hear
[59:47] about Mary he says he says I'm Jewish I
[59:49] don't want to read it and the guy says
[59:50] it's not about that you need to read
[59:53] this and he
[59:55] said okay and he takes the little thing
[59:59] and he brings it home and he says he
[1:00:01] tells me he says I couldn't take it and
[1:00:05] not read
[1:00:07] it so he opened it up and he started in
[1:00:10] Matthew and he read the all the
[1:00:14] gospels and he said in his in his heart
[1:00:19] and he was crying out to God he said he
[1:00:22] said Lord this is a continuation
[1:00:25] of the
[1:00:26] Bible he said this is not a gentile book
[1:00:30] this is not a Catholic book he said this
[1:00:32] is a Jewish book he said they're all
[1:00:34] Jews in here you see how he went through
[1:00:37] the book of Acts and we saw that
[1:00:40] progression he said this is a Jewish
[1:00:42] book he said this is God so he gives his
[1:00:46] heart to the Lord Jesus this little
[1:00:47] Jewish man this is way back I think it
[1:00:50] was in late
[1:00:53] 70s
[1:00:55] and he
[1:00:57] starts praying and he starts reading
[1:01:00] this book and he starts witnessing to
[1:01:02] other people and he has a gift in his
[1:01:04] life of a teacher of a rabbi and he's
[1:01:07] studying this and he's seeing that this
[1:01:09] is not for the Gentiles this was
[1:01:11] actually meant for us but we were
[1:01:14] blinded and then it went to these other
[1:01:17] people and he was very plain you don't
[1:01:21] matter we are
[1:01:23] superior was his was his
[1:01:26] attitude and I was like yeah but it's
[1:01:29] ours right now so he kept
[1:01:33] on and
[1:01:36] one afternoon or
[1:01:39] evening he was praying and he sees a
[1:01:44] vision and this Vision God comes to
[1:01:49] him and he said it was Jesus it was very
[1:01:53] similar to what happened to the Apostle
[1:01:55] Paul on the road to
[1:01:57] Damascus that book of Acts friends is
[1:02:00] very very important so
[1:02:03] he's he he he this light comes down and
[1:02:07] it goes right into him and he cries out
[1:02:11] to
[1:02:13] God and the Lord tells
[1:02:16] him he says that you have accepted me
[1:02:21] and I can't remember his exact words I
[1:02:22] have his exact words written written
[1:02:24] down in some of my notes that are packed
[1:02:27] away in boxes but he
[1:02:29] said the the vision told him said that
[1:02:34] you have received the Messiah and you
[1:02:38] are going to receive within a week you
[1:02:41] are going to receive a further
[1:02:43] revelation of
[1:02:45] this
[1:02:47] so the vision's over he said he tells me
[1:02:50] he said I feel like it would have killed
[1:02:53] anybody this experience that I had he
[1:02:55] said it was so powerful so he's praying
[1:03:00] about this a few days later a man knocks
[1:03:04] at his
[1:03:05] door and says can I share something with
[1:03:09] you and he says he says yes he says are
[1:03:14] you a Christian he says I'm a Christian
[1:03:16] he says I've just given my heart to the
[1:03:18] Lord Jesus I'm Jewish but I'm I'm a
[1:03:20] Christian and and and he tells him his
[1:03:22] testimony and the man says I've got
[1:03:25] something that'll be a blessing to
[1:03:28] you and then he tells them he says God
[1:03:31] sent a
[1:03:33] prophet
[1:03:35] according to Malachi chapter
[1:03:39] 4 and he said the Lord told me you were
[1:03:44] coming so the man stays with him seven
[1:03:48] days he stays with him in his home
[1:03:51] teaching him listening to these
[1:03:55] tapes the man
[1:03:59] leaves he was so on fire for the Lord he
[1:04:04] gets in his
[1:04:05] car he drives to Tucson Arizona to this
[1:04:11] very
[1:04:14] church and he comes
[1:04:16] in and he says I
[1:04:20] want this
[1:04:22] message so
[1:04:25] they he buys he spends all of his money
[1:04:28] and he buys a full set of those red
[1:04:32] books that brother green had printed
[1:04:34] there were all the sermons in order that
[1:04:36] we had transcribed big big set he buys
[1:04:40] that set of books runs out of money in
[1:04:43] Yuma trying to get back home has to go
[1:04:46] out and work in the fields picking uh I
[1:04:48] think he said Tomatoes forgot what it
[1:04:51] was no it's lettuce picking lettuce out
[1:04:53] in the field has to earn enough money to
[1:04:55] get enough gas to get home and then he
[1:04:58] starts reading these
[1:05:00] books about that
[1:05:03] time his beloved sweetheart he was a
[1:05:08] young man he's like 21 22 years
[1:05:12] old she's a good Jewish
[1:05:15] girl her parents said that he's not good
[1:05:18] enough for you so they arranged a
[1:05:21] marriage with another young man and it
[1:05:23] broke BR his
[1:05:25] heart so he says I'm leaving all of this
[1:05:29] by the way he died 2013 or
[1:05:34] 2014 and he lived a celibate and
[1:05:38] consecrated life to that woman his
[1:05:40] entire
[1:05:43] life died at 80 around 80 years
[1:05:46] old so he takes his books so in love
[1:05:51] with her he takes his books and he goes
[1:05:53] to Jerusalem and he lives there for
[1:05:57] decades and all he
[1:06:01] had was these bound sermons and he read
[1:06:06] them over and over again as I said for
[1:06:11] decades so he comes he gets he gets
[1:06:15] what's called Crohn's disease a deadly
[1:06:17] disease man most of the time among
[1:06:19] Jewish people and had a hole in his
[1:06:21] stomach and he lived just a horrible
[1:06:23] life he was going to die the only person
[1:06:26] that could do the the surgery was in
[1:06:29] Phoenix Arizona at the Mayo Clinic he he
[1:06:32] flies from Jerusalem to to Phoenix he
[1:06:34] has the surgery done and he goes and he
[1:06:37] moves to
[1:06:39] Kawai where Stephanie and I just went we
[1:06:41] actually went to his house when we were
[1:06:44] there we went to the place that he lived
[1:06:47] and to live out his days we ended up
[1:06:51] recovering and living many years after
[1:06:55] that all the time reading these red
[1:06:59] bound books that's the only thing he
[1:07:01] knew he didn't know there was anyone
[1:07:02] else in the world really that believed
[1:07:04] like
[1:07:05] this so you'll see my point in telling
[1:07:09] the story it's a very profound thing so
[1:07:12] he's
[1:07:14] gets
[1:07:15] YouTube on his
[1:07:18] television and he's tells me this story
[1:07:21] and he says I got
[1:07:24] YouTube he says do you know what YouTube
[1:07:28] is I said yeah I know what YouTube is
[1:07:32] and he says well I got it on there the
[1:07:33] first thing I search is William
[1:07:35] brandom and he said I started
[1:07:38] hearing all of these
[1:07:41] ministers preaching William bram's
[1:07:46] message and right about then I felt the
[1:07:51] presence of the holy spirit in my office
[1:07:55] telling me listen to this
[1:07:59] man and he tells me this he said you
[1:08:05] ruined William brandom's
[1:08:10] message oh and he tells me you're
[1:08:12] preaching all of this stuff that he
[1:08:14] didn't preach and you're taking all
[1:08:15] these things out of context and he says
[1:08:17] you're making up this big thing and
[1:08:19] you're ignoring the main
[1:08:22] thing so
[1:08:24] I went home
[1:08:29] and I made the decision I was this was
[1:08:33] um 2000 as I said
[1:08:36] 2012 40 years
[1:08:38] old I said Lord here I am 40 years old I
[1:08:43] was born in this do I really believe
[1:08:46] this and I said I do and I made this
[1:08:51] commitment I said but I'm going to
[1:08:56] relearn brother Ram's message I've said
[1:08:59] this before I'm going to learn it in the
[1:09:01] same spirit that it was
[1:09:05] given and that has
[1:09:08] been very very
[1:09:11] much
[1:09:12] a journey for me until this
[1:09:17] day cutting out
[1:09:19] everything all of the around the supper
[1:09:22] table talks and all the do that we all
[1:09:24] talk about I'm not saying it's bad we're
[1:09:27] talking about something good but it
[1:09:29] impresses all of us it impresses our
[1:09:33] children and all of the the conversation
[1:09:37] with friends and
[1:09:39] now I look at it in a very very
[1:09:43] different
[1:09:45] light thinking that no these things are
[1:09:49] not what he
[1:09:51] taught he may have said them one time
[1:09:53] time and that's good enough I believe it
[1:09:55] if he said it once he may have said it
[1:09:57] two or three times but then we ignore as
[1:10:01] my friend told me we ignore the main
[1:10:03] part of the
[1:10:05] message which is Jesus Christ himself
[1:10:09] remember in the last age in Revelation
[1:10:11] chapter 3 there's somebody standing on
[1:10:13] the outside of the church knocking to
[1:10:15] get in it's
[1:10:16] Jesus and it's the spirit of the people
[1:10:20] to cut them out to say to say I don't
[1:10:23] want you I've Got My
[1:10:25] Religion I've got my faith I'm special
[1:10:28] and what it has
[1:10:30] done it is made it to where we have
[1:10:34] split off and into a cult or a
[1:10:36] denomination or a sect or whatever you
[1:10:39] want to call it we have split off and
[1:10:41] now we are the Elite and we don't care
[1:10:45] about other people and that's why our
[1:10:47] churches aren't growing that's right
[1:10:50] that's why all the churches are
[1:10:51] shrinking is because we become this
[1:10:53] Elite sect of people saying that we're
[1:10:57] right and ignore what the Lord Jesus
[1:11:00] himself taught and
[1:11:02] especially ignore what brother brandham
[1:11:05] taught but even with that said the
[1:11:08] prophet Ezekiel said this I believe it's
[1:11:11] Ezekiel
[1:11:14] 3 Anointed with the Holy Spirit the the
[1:11:17] prophet said he says whether they will
[1:11:20] hear or whether they will
[1:11:24] forbear for they are a rebellious house
[1:11:28] yet shall they know that a prophet has
[1:11:30] been among them we should
[1:11:33] never cut out or disregard a gift that
[1:11:38] God has given
[1:11:40] us Brothers I'm sorry I I'm going to
[1:11:43] completely deviate from my notes um I
[1:11:47] want
[1:11:49] to read the
[1:11:52] parable of
[1:11:54] sowing the seeds it's Luke chapter 8
[1:11:57] Brothers if you could give me Luke
[1:11:59] chapter
[1:12:00] 8
[1:12:08] verse4 it says
[1:12:13] this and when much people were gathered
[1:12:17] together and we come to him out of every
[1:12:20] city he spake by a parable remember a
[1:12:22] parable is a story it gives that gives a
[1:12:26] valuable lesson a sewer went out to sew
[1:12:28] his seed and as he swed some fell by the
[1:12:32] wayside and it was trotten down and the
[1:12:34] fowls of the air devoured it and some
[1:12:36] fell upon a rock and as soon as it was
[1:12:39] sprung up it withered away because it
[1:12:41] lacked
[1:12:42] moisture he are being planted on
[1:12:44] infertile
[1:12:45] ground and some fell among thorns and
[1:12:49] the Thorns sprang up with it and choked
[1:12:52] it and other fell on good ground and
[1:12:55] sprang up and bear fruit a h
[1:12:59] hundredfold and when he had said these
[1:13:01] things he
[1:13:02] cried he that hath ears to hear Let Him
[1:13:06] hear look at Jesus is putting great
[1:13:08] emphasis on this Parable so much that he
[1:13:12] cried out with a loud voice it was very
[1:13:14] very important to
[1:13:16] him he must have been troubled as he was
[1:13:19] saying
[1:13:20] this and his disciples asked him saying
[1:13:25] what might this Parable be so they could
[1:13:28] see that Jesus was troubled with
[1:13:31] this and he said unto you it is given to
[1:13:35] know the mysteries of the kingdom of God
[1:13:38] but to others in Parables that seeing
[1:13:41] they might not see and hearing they
[1:13:43] might not understand he's saying that I
[1:13:46] don't speak as clearly in public as I do
[1:13:50] to you my close
[1:13:52] friends now the parable is
[1:13:55] this the
[1:13:57] seed is the word of God so this this man
[1:14:02] that's planting seeds these seeds sep
[1:14:05] they
[1:14:06] represent God's word those by the
[1:14:09] wayside are they that
[1:14:12] hear then cometh the devil and taketh
[1:14:15] away the word out of their hearts lest
[1:14:18] they should believe and be
[1:14:21] saved I see people all time they come to
[1:14:25] church they get a blessing but then some
[1:14:28] little things keep them from coming
[1:14:30] again and it's not just going to church
[1:14:32] that doesn't make you a Christian just
[1:14:34] going to church by any means I'm not
[1:14:36] trying to say that but there is always
[1:14:39] something that separates you from the
[1:14:42] Lord there's something that always is
[1:14:44] there from that prevents you from
[1:14:48] praying that prevents you from communing
[1:14:51] with God that's a
[1:14:54] Christian but there's something there
[1:14:56] that that separates you doesn't allow
[1:14:59] those roots to take
[1:15:01] hold this is listed
[1:15:04] first in where these seeds fall because
[1:15:07] I believe that it's the most
[1:15:10] common this is most
[1:15:14] people they on the Rock are they which
[1:15:18] when they hear they receive the word
[1:15:22] with joy
[1:15:23] and these have no root which for a while
[1:15:27] believe and in time of Temptation they
[1:15:30] fall
[1:15:31] away so they get a little bit out there
[1:15:34] they start to grow a little bit but when
[1:15:37] this temptation comes it's stronger than
[1:15:39] the foundation that has been built in
[1:15:41] them and then theyve just they blow
[1:15:44] away how many of us see
[1:15:47] this they're not falling away to other
[1:15:50] churches they're not falling away to
[1:15:53] other to to staying home and worshiping
[1:15:57] all the time they're falling away into
[1:15:59] the world they're falling away from
[1:16:01] worshiping
[1:16:03] God they start with Zeal but it fades
[1:16:07] because there isn't any root in the
[1:16:12] gospel there isn't any root in the thing
[1:16:16] that will actually hold them and that is
[1:16:22] Christ and that which fell among Thorns
[1:16:26] are they which when they have heard go
[1:16:28] forth and are choked with cares and
[1:16:31] riches and pleasures of this life and
[1:16:33] bring no fruit to
[1:16:36] Perfection so it says here the the world
[1:16:39] is more important than their
[1:16:41] salvation they would never say that but
[1:16:44] their choices prove what they are and
[1:16:48] none of their fruits get
[1:16:50] ripe they're not a benefit to anyone
[1:16:55] they don't go all the way brother Mark
[1:16:59] that's the most important thing they got
[1:17:01] to go all the way take the last
[1:17:07] step I was talking with the other
[1:17:10] day with
[1:17:12] someone
[1:17:14] and was telling telling her about
[1:17:18] Jesus and I
[1:17:20] said Jesus
[1:17:23] tells us that if someone takes something
[1:17:26] from you to go and give them
[1:17:29] more if someone spreads rumors about you
[1:17:33] then you go and you speak kindly about
[1:17:35] that
[1:17:37] person if someone hurts
[1:17:40] you you do the opposite to them and lift
[1:17:45] them up and she says this she says yeah
[1:17:49] but no one really does
[1:17:52] that it's it's
[1:17:56] true but Jesus said if you love me keep
[1:18:00] my
[1:18:01] Commandments he still said
[1:18:05] it and when we say that well no one
[1:18:08] really does that you're taking what he
[1:18:10] said and say I don't care I don't care
[1:18:12] what Jesus said nobody can do that but
[1:18:15] he wouldn't have said it if we couldn't
[1:18:16] do
[1:18:17] it he gave us this
[1:18:20] message to where we can live it the
[1:18:24] message of Jesus Christ The Gospel but
[1:18:27] when you say no one can re no one really
[1:18:30] does it it shows me that you don't want
[1:18:31] to do it it shows me that that your life
[1:18:35] is more important than whatever Jesus
[1:18:39] says but that on the good ground are
[1:18:44] they which in an honest and good heart
[1:18:47] having heard the word keep it and bring
[1:18:50] forth fruit with patience
[1:18:54] you can tell me friends you can tell me
[1:18:58] all you want about how much you believe
[1:19:01] you can tell me all you want about how
[1:19:04] good of a Christian you are and how much
[1:19:05] you read your Bible and you will and do
[1:19:07] all of that but your testimony is
[1:19:10] speaking so loud I can't hear your
[1:19:14] words show me the fruits in your life if
[1:19:18] you really
[1:19:20] believe the same with me Lord give me
[1:19:23] those fruits Lord my time in prayer let
[1:19:27] it be
[1:19:28] fruitful let me represent Christ these
[1:19:31] things that Jesus said Lord I want to do
[1:19:33] those things I want to be what he said
[1:19:36] to be now look and I see where's the
[1:19:39] burden for the
[1:19:40] lost you talk about Jesus Jesus our
[1:19:44] example I'd say he had a burden for the
[1:19:47] Lost he was sent to the Lost he died for
[1:19:51] the Lost
[1:19:54] yes and if it was truly there friends it
[1:19:57] would be outwardly
[1:19:59] visible there's fruit you can see the
[1:20:01] fruit on the
[1:20:02] tree no man when he hath lighted a
[1:20:06] candle cover it with a vessel so Jesus
[1:20:09] is telling them
[1:20:10] listen that fruit is to be displayed no
[1:20:15] man when he had lit a candle cover it
[1:20:17] with a vessel or put it under a bed but
[1:20:20] set it on a candlestick
[1:20:23] that they which enter in may see the
[1:20:26] light I love that for nothing is secret
[1:20:31] that shall not be made manifest neither
[1:20:33] anything
[1:20:35] hid that shall not be known and come
[1:20:39] abroad these things that are hidden
[1:20:42] they'll eventually come
[1:20:44] out and it's strange to me it's very
[1:20:47] like like with Jesus's Ministry it's the
[1:20:50] opposite of what you would think it is
[1:20:53] if you confess your
[1:20:56] sins then they will be forever
[1:21:00] hidden so much so that they're wiped
[1:21:02] away if you confess your sins but if you
[1:21:05] hide your
[1:21:07] sins then they'll come
[1:21:09] out and they'll be
[1:21:12] displayed the opposite of what we
[1:21:16] think so I took a long time to answer
[1:21:19] the question about teaching
[1:21:23] brother Brown's message and taking some
[1:21:26] time as this person uh suggested taking
[1:21:30] some time and maybe expounding on some
[1:21:34] of these things that are what he taught
[1:21:38] and I feel yes I will do that I've given
[1:21:43] my life to this my mom and dad when I
[1:21:48] was in the the belly they were playing
[1:21:52] brother brother pom's tapes for me I
[1:21:54] grew up with it I know it I've studied
[1:21:58] it my whole
[1:22:00] life so yes I can I want to I want to do
[1:22:05] that I want to take some time
[1:22:08] and say Here's what brother brandom said
[1:22:11] about these certain subjects but
[1:22:14] brothers and sisters please I ask
[1:22:18] you be
[1:22:20] ready to be he corrected that no he
[1:22:24] didn't teach it like you think he taught
[1:22:27] it his message was not what you think
[1:22:31] his message was maybe maybe it will be
[1:22:36] but just be ready don't judge
[1:22:39] me I'm going to do my best to not put my
[1:22:42] own interpretation on these things I'm
[1:22:45] going to do my best to take what he said
[1:22:49] the scriptures that he used and go
[1:22:52] subject by
[1:22:54] subject and say here it is now it's up
[1:22:58] to you but let me tell you this and
[1:23:01] here's another thing that I believe that
[1:23:03] we have made the mistake in the ministry
[1:23:05] is we have taken brother brandom's
[1:23:07] message and then we've tried to explain
[1:23:10] it we've tried to say here's what he
[1:23:13] meant and let me take a quote here and a
[1:23:14] quote here and a quote here and I'll put
[1:23:16] it together and here's the doctrine I
[1:23:18] think brother Brandon would come and say
[1:23:19] what it's not my Doctrine what are you
[1:23:23] doing that's what we have done in the
[1:23:27] ministry and when that brother when he
[1:23:29] told me you ruined brother brandom's
[1:23:32] message me Daniel Evans is who I believe
[1:23:37] has done that because of my way of
[1:23:44] thinking that was uh let me let me read
[1:23:47] to you something brother brandom said
[1:23:49] and I'm not going to get to my notes
[1:23:51] today we'll uh I'll preach the sermon
[1:23:54] that that I wanted to preach this
[1:23:55] morning at another time brother Bram
[1:23:57] said this in God's only provided place
[1:23:59] of worship he said this now have you
[1:24:02] noticed every three years after a great
[1:24:05] meeting what takes place a
[1:24:09] denomination this is 20 years and no
[1:24:12] denomination dear dying lamb may it
[1:24:15] never do
[1:24:16] that if I go in this generation May the
[1:24:20] people who believe this message never
[1:24:22] stand still for a
[1:24:26] denomination God will you will die right
[1:24:29] in your track remember that the very
[1:24:32] hour that you mention denomination among
[1:24:34] you I don't care how sincere you
[1:24:37] are take a man for your leader instead
[1:24:41] of the Holy Spirit to confirm his
[1:24:45] word take a man for your leader instead
[1:24:48] of the Holy Spirit to confirm his word
[1:24:52] that that's the hour you
[1:24:54] die the genuine seed cannot because
[1:24:58] there's nothing left after the seed it
[1:25:01] didn't bear
[1:25:02] fruit the parable I just read it's the
[1:25:06] same thing was at back at the beginning
[1:25:08] it's the bride that fell into the ground
[1:25:11] to bring forth the corn of wheat again
[1:25:14] that's the one that fell on the good
[1:25:18] ground brother random said we're always
[1:25:21] saying it's brother brand said brother
[1:25:23] brandom said brother brandham said and
[1:25:25] we wonder why we don't see new converts
[1:25:28] friends we wonder why they don't
[1:25:32] know we take the Holy Spirit out and we
[1:25:36] replace it with something else replace
[1:25:40] it as brother brandom said with a man
[1:25:42] and those roots stop growing does that
[1:25:46] mean that we throw out the prophet
[1:25:48] sermons not this guy not me oh no I
[1:25:53] still listen to it and I I love it more
[1:25:55] now than I ever have I listen to it
[1:25:57] almost every day that doesn't mean that
[1:26:01] but he warned
[1:26:02] us we replac the holy spirit with an
[1:26:07] intellectual understanding rather than a
[1:26:09] Pentecostal experience when I say
[1:26:12] Pentecostal experience I don't mean what
[1:26:14] the world has replac Pentecost
[1:26:17] with how many times have we seen people
[1:26:19] shouting and praising the Lord and
[1:26:20] outpouring of emotion but then on Sunday
[1:26:23] but then on Monday they're the same
[1:26:24] person that they were before that's
[1:26:27] worship worship is good but that's not
[1:26:29] the Pentecostal experience the
[1:26:31] Pentecostal experience is receiving the
[1:26:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost where Jesus
[1:26:37] Christ lives in you just like he lived
[1:26:41] in the apostles the ones that were there
[1:26:43] at the day of Pentecost the same Jesus
[1:26:46] Christ the Bible says Jesus Christ is
[1:26:48] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:26:51] so that same spirit that they had back
[1:26:53] then is the same spirit that we can have
[1:26:56] in us and it's not dependent on a
[1:27:00] denomination it's dependent on a
[1:27:03] relationship with God that's
[1:27:10] everything brother Braham said
[1:27:12] this I Pray for Mercy Lord questions and
[1:27:16] answers I pray for Mercy Lord have mercy
[1:27:19] on me help me it makes me nervous
[1:27:23] father I pray that you'll help me I
[1:27:25] don't want to seal my life all my work
[1:27:27] here would be out here some fanatic to
[1:27:31] lead some group or cult into a desert
[1:27:36] somewhere don't let my name have to go
[1:27:39] down like that
[1:27:41] Lord this is Brother Brown
[1:27:44] speaking I fought hard for
[1:27:47] this I'm sincere in it as I can be God
[1:27:51] don't let it happen happen help me some
[1:27:54] way I don't know what to do I'm just
[1:27:56] depending on you but you help me I'll do
[1:28:00] anything you tell me to do I'm your
[1:28:01] servant these are your children Lord
[1:28:04] most of these people 99 out of every
[1:28:07] hundred Lord is really solid they
[1:28:08] believe they know they understand and
[1:28:11] they know it's not me but I know these
[1:28:14] things has to follow every
[1:28:19] Revival and this is not immune from
[1:28:23] it so I pray that you'll help us now I
[1:28:26] can't make that more plain than brother
[1:28:28] what brother brandom
[1:28:29] said he said they follow every Revival
[1:28:33] that word follow the definition of it is
[1:28:36] to come
[1:28:39] after to proceed ahead
[1:28:43] afterwards come after in time or
[1:28:47] order so he says right here this is
[1:28:50] going to come after
[1:28:53] but Lord don't let it be and it's a
[1:28:56] spirit that comes in and
[1:28:59] divides and what it does is it takes out
[1:29:02] Jesus Christ from the from the church it
[1:29:04] takes out the Holy Spirit from the
[1:29:06] church and replaces it with a
[1:29:09] denomination when we start digging in to
[1:29:12] these subjects brother brandom said some
[1:29:15] of the most popular subjects we have one
[1:29:18] once or twice over here this one once or
[1:29:20] twice over here when he talked about the
[1:29:21] denom ational Spirit it was almost every
[1:29:23] sermon he hated it he was set on Earth
[1:29:29] to knock that thing down and then what
[1:29:32] do we do we come in and we do the same
[1:29:34] thing that he said don't do that and we
[1:29:37] form a little
[1:29:38] group and we tell the ministers pastors
[1:29:42] tell each other how to
[1:29:44] preach somebody came to me the other
[1:29:46] day
[1:29:48] said heard that you're you're you're
[1:29:53] kind of just you're kind of just
[1:29:54] preaching Jesus in the
[1:30:04] [Applause]
[1:30:14] Bible what else am I going to
[1:30:17] preach
[1:30:19] seriously what did Brother Brandon
[1:30:21] preach
[1:30:24] I just I think who could say something
[1:30:27] as ridiculous as
[1:30:30] that it's brother Brandon would be
[1:30:35] ashamed I love his message I just read
[1:30:39] most of half of what I've read I read
[1:30:42] about an equal amount of of quotes as I
[1:30:45] did Jesus's words but it was to lift up
[1:30:48] Jesus and to warn
[1:30:50] us
[1:30:54] pastor friend of mine called me uh a
[1:30:57] couple days ago a brother I love dearly
[1:31:00] he a good
[1:31:02] friend and he said his brother Dan he
[1:31:04] says
[1:31:06] uh I've been fellowshipping with with
[1:31:09] this this group of
[1:31:11] people that
[1:31:13] uh
[1:31:16] that they're not associated with us he
[1:31:18] said but these people are going to China
[1:31:21] and they're going going to Iran and
[1:31:23] they're going to these very dangerous
[1:31:25] places so they can get the message they
[1:31:27] can get gospel the Bible into North
[1:31:31] Korea and they're having secret meetings
[1:31:34] in China where they're worshiping God
[1:31:38] and he said they're risking their lives
[1:31:40] he says these are affluent people these
[1:31:43] people were well to do and they gave
[1:31:46] everything they sold what they had so
[1:31:48] they could pay their way and they could
[1:31:50] go to China or go to Iran R and live in
[1:31:52] danger he said he said brother he says
[1:31:54] how can I cut them out from the
[1:31:58] bride just because they don't believe
[1:32:00] like me he says they're doing more than
[1:32:02] I
[1:32:03] am he says they're doing more than we
[1:32:06] are I said brother why would
[1:32:08] we why would we want to cut something
[1:32:11] like that
[1:32:12] out friend of
[1:32:14] mine in
[1:32:16] Jeffersonville he and his wife were
[1:32:19] living in sin and and and going to the
[1:32:21] bar and and not living right at
[1:32:24] all just living really just just bad
[1:32:29] lives grew up same way I grew up
[1:32:32] actually very very
[1:32:35] similar and there was a friend of his
[1:32:39] that he worked with from Eastside
[1:32:42] Christian Church which is a mega church
[1:32:44] one of the biggest churches in the
[1:32:45] United States in Louisville this man his
[1:32:49] friend reached out to him and and
[1:32:51] counseled him and brought him to the
[1:32:54] Lord Jesus and brought his wife to the
[1:32:56] Lord
[1:32:58] Jesus and yet we're going to cut that
[1:33:00] man
[1:33:02] out and
[1:33:04] now my friend is preaching the gospel
[1:33:08] preaching the same message that we
[1:33:11] preach but he needed that person from
[1:33:14] someone we would say ah they're they're
[1:33:18] we'd call them denominational who's
[1:33:19] denominational that person or us
[1:33:24] Stephanie was she was telling me that
[1:33:27] she's a nurse at Banner hospital she was
[1:33:30] telling me that that that they had this
[1:33:32] homeless man that came in he got
[1:33:34] burned he uh he he had a cigarette and
[1:33:38] something caught on fire and he was
[1:33:39] trying to stomp it out ended up catching
[1:33:41] his clothes on fire and burning him
[1:33:42] pretty severely he comes into the
[1:33:45] hospital and he's there very simple guy
[1:33:49] doesn't doesn't have I doubt that he's
[1:33:51] he was strung out on drugs he just
[1:33:53] wouldn't he wasn't able to make his way
[1:33:55] in
[1:33:56] life wasn't capable so he's there in the
[1:34:00] hospital and the
[1:34:03] housekeeper this little Mexican lady had
[1:34:06] compassion on this man the man had no
[1:34:10] clothes everything was burned up he had
[1:34:12] no
[1:34:13] shoes this little lady goes to
[1:34:17] Walmart a housekeeper at the
[1:34:19] hospital buys him shoes
[1:34:22] buys them
[1:34:24] jeans a shirt
[1:34:28] clothes gives us to him she doesn't have
[1:34:33] anything it's the poor
[1:34:36] people that are the most generous why is
[1:34:40] that she gives to this
[1:34:43] man and he was so proud he was so happy
[1:34:49] that he'd been given this
[1:34:52] Stephanie said that because of his Burns
[1:34:54] that if he would have had to walk in in
[1:34:55] in some other pair of shoes he couldn't
[1:34:57] have walked it would have hurt him he
[1:34:59] had good tennis shoes that he could walk
[1:35:01] in and and she said that he was even
[1:35:02] able to walk and get
[1:35:06] around he was so simple he he he didn't
[1:35:09] know his social security number he
[1:35:10] didn't know how to get money he said he
[1:35:12] would get an odd job every once in a
[1:35:14] while
[1:35:15] painting and then just handouts and here
[1:35:18] is this precious little lady that no one
[1:35:22] would ever think twice about I believe
[1:35:24] she's gonna be a queen in heaven for
[1:35:26] doing what she did for that poor
[1:35:28] man I'm not talking about giving these
[1:35:30] people out here that are strung out on
[1:35:32] drugs money but Jesus said he said the
[1:35:35] poor you will have with you
[1:35:38] always those are the people that need
[1:35:40] help he said but me you won't have with
[1:35:43] you because he was going
[1:35:46] on but he said to help the
[1:35:49] poor and that little lady is doing it I
[1:35:53] looked at that and sometimes I think how
[1:35:55] much of a better Christian is she than
[1:35:57] me she's probably
[1:35:59] Catholic doing it these people just fly
[1:36:03] right under the radar but let me tell
[1:36:05] you something they won't be under the
[1:36:07] radar when Christ comes they'll be over
[1:36:11] the
[1:36:11] radar they'll be flying
[1:36:14] up receiving the
[1:36:17] reward that they've been
[1:36:20] given well uh we'll close and as I said
[1:36:23] I didn't I didn't get to the sermon that
[1:36:27] I wanted to to to preach today I'll get
[1:36:31] to it maybe next next weekend but in
[1:36:35] answering that
[1:36:36] question
[1:36:38] yes we should learn what this great man
[1:36:43] taught but we need to learn it in the
[1:36:48] Holy
[1:36:49] Spirit and not in an in intellectual
[1:36:52] understanding because when we learn in
[1:36:53] an intellectual understanding we will
[1:36:55] put our thoughts above
[1:36:58] it and if we just have that Spirit if we
[1:37:01] if we can understand why Jesus said
[1:37:05] these things if we can understand this
[1:37:07] book if we can understand what the
[1:37:10] prophet said then we will be able to go
[1:37:12] and do what Jesus said and not say oh
[1:37:15] nobody can do that yes they can sister
[1:37:17] Shirley's doing it you know look at you
[1:37:20] know brother Manny's doing it serving
[1:37:22] the lord I'm doing it I'm I'm doing the
[1:37:23] best that I
[1:37:24] can that's what I
[1:37:27] want brother Jordan if you could come
[1:37:30] with
[1:37:32] musicians
[1:37:34] let's let's
[1:37:37] go I want I do want to read one
[1:37:39] scripture that that I had and I was
[1:37:41] going to go through Romans chapter 8 and
[1:37:43] we will do it it'll be a blessing
[1:37:47] um let's go to Romans chapter
[1:37:50] 8
[1:37:54] quoted a
[1:37:55] lot because
[1:37:58] it's it's my favorite thing to read when
[1:38:01] I need to be encouraged start with verse
[1:38:05] 35 says
[1:38:10] this I'm hard Stephanie says you're kind
[1:38:14] of hard on the
[1:38:15] people she says you you you know you're
[1:38:18] you're
[1:38:19] always and she wasn't criticizing she
[1:38:21] was just saying that that's my
[1:38:24] Ministry is is a corrective Ministry and
[1:38:28] and Friends one thing I I love you and I
[1:38:32] want us all to be there I want to be
[1:38:34] there and when Jesus says all of these
[1:38:37] things that someone might say nobody can
[1:38:38] do that we can do
[1:38:41] it and if we
[1:38:43] fail if we
[1:38:46] fail who can separate us from the love
[1:38:49] of Christ sh without tribulation or
[1:38:52] distress or persecution or famine or
[1:38:55] nakedness or Peril or
[1:38:58] sword as it is written for thy sake we
[1:39:02] are killed all the day long we are
[1:39:03] accounted as sheep as for the slaughter
[1:39:07] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:39:10] conquerors through him that loved
[1:39:14] us for I am
[1:39:17] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:39:21] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:39:24] nor things present nor things to
[1:39:27] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:39:32] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:39:35] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:39:38] Jesus our lord that's my God that's my
[1:39:42] savior that's my Lord that's who I want
[1:39:45] to be part of that's who I want to
[1:39:47] commune with that's I want that's every
[1:39:52] Prophet from Genesis to Revelation the
[1:39:56] whole span of the book every single one
[1:39:59] was lifting up Jesus Christ
[1:40:01] everyone and that's the one I want to
[1:40:03] lift
[1:40:04] up the prophet that I listen to every
[1:40:07] day that's who he lifted up that's who
[1:40:10] he
[1:40:11] loved and that's why his message changed
[1:40:16] the
[1:40:18] world it was all different
[1:40:21] you had the Pentecostal Revival and it
[1:40:24] went up and it died and then you had
[1:40:26] this man William brandom come in and
[1:40:28] start up this charismatic Revival that
[1:40:30] swept the Earth he changed
[1:40:34] it preaching against the denominational
[1:40:37] system against the denominational way of
[1:40:41] thinking and it
[1:40:44] changed changed
[1:40:46] me I love
[1:40:49] it friends we uh we have at least one

[1:41:52] be I want to be I want to be that one
[1:41:55] that Jesus talked about when Jesus said
[1:41:57] you forgive your enemies when Jesus said
[1:41:59] that you give to those who need it when
[1:42:01] Jesus said all of these things that
[1:42:03] didn't make sense that are hard to do I
[1:42:06] want to do it and I'm going to prove
