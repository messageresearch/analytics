[39:46] you for it in Jesus Christ
[39:49] amen
[39:51] while you're standing let's just read
[39:55] Romans chapter 8.
[39:58] we'll read verses 11 and 14.
[40:02] and then you may be seated
[40:07] you know we say these these this
[40:09] scriptures so we should know it all
[40:12] we read it often but in reality we
[40:15] should really get to the place where we
[40:16] know this whole book
[40:18] all of it as much as we can we find
[40:20] ourselves reading a lot of things
[40:22] well we could be reading his word but
[40:25] amen but if the Same Spirit of him that
[40:28] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[40:31] you
[40:32] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[40:34] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[40:38] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[40:41] and then verse 14.
[40:44] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[40:47] God they are the sons of God Amen you
[40:51] may be seated so
[40:55] the last time we spoke we had
[40:58] heard a brother Minister and at the end
[41:00] of his his ministry and he made that
[41:03] statement
[41:04] what if this would be the day
[41:07] when Jesus comes what if this would be
[41:10] that Resurrection morning
[41:12] and that thought hasn't gone away
[41:14] because every day I wake up thinking
[41:16] could this be that day
[41:19] and and it should be in our heart every
[41:21] day
[41:23] just different things that going in life
[41:26] and I find myself saying oh even so come
[41:30] quickly Lord Jesus
[41:32] and then I stop myself and say why
[41:35] because I just want out of this current
[41:38] trouble I'm in
[41:40] this that's going on what is it
[41:43] and there's going to be that day when
[41:45] this will no longer trouble us
[41:47] it won't we won't be part of this life
[41:50] now
[41:51] some of you are still quite young and
[41:54] I laughed to myself a little bit today
[41:57] when Daniel got used
[41:59] my dad
[42:02] and I thought my girls were thinking
[42:03] it's not us this time
[42:07] because I used my girls quite often
[42:11] but you know we are the children of God
[42:15] and and I don't hear Brother Daniel
[42:18] Evans speaking about his son that way
[42:21] because he's mad at his son or because
[42:23] no because he loves his son
[42:27] see now we are the sons of God
[42:31] and sometimes when he speaks to us it
[42:34] might seem like he's a little upset with
[42:35] us or he's a if I could have put it in
[42:38] our way he's a bit frustrated with if
[42:40] you know how many times am I going to
[42:42] have to tell you this
[42:44] and um
[42:46] maybe we would say when we learn it
[42:48] maybe Lord you could stop we could
[42:51] change the subject
[42:52] but you know he knows how to teach he
[42:54] knows how to get in he knows what gets
[42:56] your attention
[42:58] and and because he knows you well
[43:00] you know um and I appreciate that um
[43:05] I was telling the brothers just a little
[43:07] bit ago
[43:09] Friday this past Friday hit up one of my
[43:14] positions in in work is I do homeowner
[43:16] appointments I go in and
[43:18] do repairs and different things and you
[43:20] never know what you're going to run into
[43:23] I've run into some wonderful people and
[43:25] I've run into some people that are hard
[43:27] to deal with and
[43:29] I've been thrown out of people's houses
[43:31] because I didn't do what they said
[43:33] because they wanted something that's not
[43:34] to be done and
[43:36] I've had others wanting to feed me
[43:38] giving you know it's you never know but
[43:41] on Friday I went into the house and
[43:45] these homeowners had not been there the
[43:47] first three times we went by
[43:50] and so this time I called and I called
[43:53] ahead with
[43:54] and with the one that schedules and they
[43:56] said they're supposed to be home and
[43:59] they were homeless so when I got into
[44:01] the house
[44:03] what was on my notes was not what they
[44:05] needed so I came unprepared with the
[44:07] right stuff because that's not what's on
[44:09] my notes so
[44:12] um the dishwasher needed to be removed
[44:15] in order for me to do the repair and
[44:17] because one of our employees had removed
[44:19] a dishwasher disconnected wrong and
[44:21] flooded the house
[44:22] we no longer remove appliances or have
[44:25] anything if it's not ours we don't touch
[44:26] it that's
[44:27] so I told him if you want me to fix this
[44:30] then you'll need to call the
[44:31] superintendent have them come and remove
[44:33] the dishwasher
[44:35] so they did and he's a young man he's
[44:37] he's doing the best he can
[44:40] and it's Friday afternoon we all want to
[44:42] go home now
[44:43] and it's been a long week
[44:45] and he kind of gives me the look like
[44:47] you know why did you do this to me I
[44:50] said because it needs to be done
[44:53] so he got a little upset he said a few
[44:55] things harshly to me in front of the
[44:57] homeowner
[44:58] then he began to disconnect the
[45:00] dishwasher did it wrong and got water
[45:02] all over the place and we had to dry it
[45:04] and
[45:04] I helped him as best I could in all
[45:08] finally we ended up getting what could
[45:10] be done done and it was probably there
[45:12] half an hour
[45:13] and then I went on to my next job and he
[45:16] left but got home and I told my wife
[45:18] what had happened and else
[45:20] it's a little embarrassing to get
[45:21] treated that way in front of the
[45:22] homeowner but hopefully we've grown up a
[45:25] little bit and learn how to handle those
[45:27] things
[45:28] but around 6 30 I get a text on my phone
[45:31] and it's him and he's saying I'm sorry
[45:33] how he treated you
[45:36] and I'm looking at it and I went back
[45:37] and I told my wife look
[45:39] he said hey I'm sorry and I just I text
[45:43] back and say hey we all have our days no
[45:44] problem it's all right no he says I just
[45:47] need to apologize to you
[45:49] I'm sorry that was on Thursday so
[45:51] yesterday Friday I'm driving through
[45:53] that subdivision at the end of the day
[45:54] he sees me and he Flags me down and I
[45:56] said oh boy now he's going to get it
[45:57] give it to me again
[45:59] but he came and he opened the window and
[46:01] I said yes sir and he goes I didn't
[46:02] again I just want to tell you I'm sorry
[46:04] I was wrong
[46:07] and I said you know and and here's the
[46:09] man I know he's got some problems and
[46:11] things he's a young man he's going
[46:12] through a hard time but that he would be
[46:15] able to do that
[46:17] that he would humble himself to say I'm
[46:20] sorry
[46:21] and it encouraged my heart because
[46:23] sometimes you look at the world and say
[46:25] there's no hope out there anymore
[46:29] but God in his rich in his great Mercy
[46:33] still calls out still reaches out and he
[46:35] says if if you could call on my name if
[46:38] he'll ask me I'll help
[46:42] now we know that he loves his children
[46:47] there's no question about it
[46:49] and he gave his life
[46:51] for us he gave his all for us
[46:55] but he tells his disciples and and you
[46:58] know his disciples around him the whole
[46:59] time and
[47:01] just like the the man and the people
[47:03] that were around brother Branham all the
[47:05] time you get to hear their testimonies
[47:07] but if you're not careful that person
[47:10] that man that Pastor whoever it is
[47:13] becomes your Holy Ghost
[47:16] becomes your answer
[47:19] and if you're not careful with that you
[47:21] know
[47:22] and and that's what began with the
[47:24] disciples were they even arguing amongst
[47:26] themselves who's the greatest
[47:28] and and can I be the one sitting at your
[47:30] right hand and and can I do this
[47:33] but Jesus makes tells them he says there
[47:36] is a better way
[47:40] now how could God do a better way
[47:43] because his ways are perfect
[47:46] but he's he had already he began to talk
[47:48] about this plan I'm not just being with
[47:51] you but in you
[47:54] and and he said and the disciples are
[47:56] not understanding that and even when it
[47:58] comes to that time Peter says I'm going
[48:00] to go with you I'll be with you first he
[48:03] tells them don't let this happen
[48:05] but that was just Satan trying to to
[48:07] interfere
[48:09] and when Jesus turns around get thee
[48:11] behind me saying he wasn't speaking to
[48:12] Peter he was speaking to that spirit
[48:15] and you know so you see those things but
[48:18] he had a way that he wanted to I'll be
[48:21] with you even in you to the end of the
[48:23] world
[48:25] because
[48:26] just being with you wasn't going to be
[48:29] enough
[48:31] brother Branham would say he'd have to
[48:33] go out the back door sometimes because
[48:35] all the people were waiting for him to
[48:37] come out the front door and he needed a
[48:39] little bit of peace and quiet made away
[48:41] but because he was a child of God and he
[48:43] had a heart for the people he would go
[48:45] out the other way
[48:46] to minister to them and he would make
[48:48] statements like I'm so tired it's been a
[48:50] long day
[48:52] but the desire for God's children was
[48:54] there
[48:55] Moses stood in between the breach and he
[48:58] said if you destroy them you're going to
[49:00] have to go through me
[49:02] it's a cry of a man of God He Loves
[49:06] God's children
[49:09] so in these scriptures
[49:11] and he says for as many
[49:14] as are led by the spirit of God they are
[49:18] the sons of God
[49:21] and as a son your heir to everything
[49:24] that the father has
[49:27] but you you see these things as Jesus is
[49:30] talking to his disciples I'm going away
[49:32] I'm going to prepare a better play I'm
[49:34] going to prepare a place for you there's
[49:36] a better way if I come and dwell in you
[49:38] my goodness I'm going to break this
[49:41] place apart here
[49:42] if I come in dwell in you
[49:45] I just won't be with you
[49:47] I'll dwell in you it's just not when
[49:50] we're walking together it's just not
[49:51] over it's always
[49:55] you know and and what a promise we have
[49:58] and this promise
[50:01] even if you go back
[50:03] and you see him when he speaks to
[50:05] Abraham and he gives them you're going
[50:06] to be the father of Nations
[50:09] through you that this lineage I'm
[50:11] talking is going to come
[50:12] and he tells them when they're old when
[50:14] they can't have children
[50:16] because that's God
[50:18] that's God
[50:20] you know if if it always just happened
[50:22] like that like that we would just be a
[50:23] bunch of spoiled children
[50:25] you know but when God shows that when he
[50:28] comes down to the last moment I always
[50:30] think of of Joseph in the prison
[50:35] if if all of it was recorded all the
[50:38] events all the thoughts going through
[50:39] Joseph's mind but that promise that
[50:42] dream you gave me those things and here
[50:45] it's ten years later and I'm still in
[50:47] prison
[50:50] but if something in his heart said I had
[50:51] a dream
[50:52] I have a promise God said to me and God
[50:56] keeps his word
[50:58] but he didn't say it's going to happen
[50:59] tomorrow he just said hold on
[51:03] you begin to look at some of these
[51:04] things even with Abraham he says I'm
[51:06] going to make you a father of Nations
[51:09] and Abraham it says he's staggered not
[51:12] at the promise of God
[51:14] I'm gonna say something to you child of
[51:17] God the same thing will be said about
[51:20] you
[51:22] he's staggered not at the promise of God
[51:25] because you're going to be on the other
[51:27] side
[51:30] believe it or not you're going to be on
[51:32] the other side he's seen you already
[51:35] you should claim that promise
[51:37] you know
[51:39] and and so you know we we've read these
[51:41] things and brother Brown says quite a
[51:43] few things if you type in the word the
[51:45] power of the Resurrection there's many
[51:47] places where he begins to speak of the
[51:49] power of the Resurrection the evidence
[51:52] of the Resurrection
[51:54] and we should see it in our own life
[51:57] my wife just planted uh
[51:59] the seeds just some flowers and
[52:02] we both get to do part of it it's really
[52:04] fun I do all the digging she does all
[52:06] the planting
[52:07] and she likes it that way best
[52:11] but we both get to reap the benefits of
[52:14] the flowers when they come up
[52:16] we get to see them and it makes me happy
[52:19] when she's happy about it you know and
[52:22] it's the same when when God looks upon
[52:24] his children and he sees him rejoicing
[52:26] in his promises it fills his heart with
[52:29] joy they've taken me at my word they
[52:32] have believed my word
[52:34] they stand for me
[52:38] I might read a few quotes here
[52:41] back in 49 way back in the beginning
[52:43] when the deity of Jesus Christ
[52:47] I believe the brothers have it
[52:52] and he says now friends I know that to
[52:54] be the truth
[52:55] I know people don't realize who you are
[52:59] every person in here can live above sin
[53:02] can live without sin and live in God
[53:06] now watch this you'll make mistakes
[53:09] yeah that's true
[53:11] but the blood of Christ will forgive you
[53:13] father forgive them for they know not
[53:15] what they do is that right the same
[53:17] power of Christ that that was hung on
[53:20] calvary's cross the same God that raised
[53:22] him up on the day of the Resurrection is
[53:25] in you now
[53:27] you that's got the Holy Ghost oh don't
[53:30] you love him oh my hear his voice
[53:33] calling today
[53:36] if the same spirit that raised Christ
[53:39] from the dead dwell in you it will
[53:43] Quicken your mortal bodies
[53:46] in 55 proof of his resurrection
[53:50] now what I'm doing to this woman here
[53:52] will not
[53:53] be reading her mind no sir God forbid
[53:56] God knows that that's wrong it won't be
[53:58] God it won't be God in heaven as my
[54:00] judge know that that's not
[54:02] that's wrong see not reading her mind
[54:05] but it'll be through the power of the
[54:07] Resurrection Jesus Christ in his church
[54:12] look at Peter and them when they stood
[54:13] there and looked upon the people how
[54:16] Paul was different and different ones
[54:18] looked upon the people and they
[54:20] perceived that there were certain things
[54:22] that were wrong it was Christ in them
[54:24] operating that way
[54:27] well that was for brother Branham that
[54:30] was for Paul that was for Peter that was
[54:33] for no that's for me and you
[54:35] it's Christ in us the hope of glory
[54:39] from the message the token
[54:43] and watch where he says what made that
[54:44] big tumor disappear in my wife yesterday
[54:47] when just a few days ago she was ready
[54:49] for the operating table and now they
[54:52] can't find a thing it's because the
[54:55] power of the resurrection of Jesus
[54:56] Christ The Token of God that he still
[55:00] lives that destroyed it
[55:03] you know what's going to destroy that
[55:05] mortal life in you the Life of Christ
[55:10] it's not going to be your Deeds it's not
[55:12] going to be your goodness it's not going
[55:13] to be your the sacrifice that's that's
[55:15] what many organizations the Catholics
[55:17] are by these great Deeds by these things
[55:19] you can overcome know by The Life of
[55:22] Christ in you
[55:25] more of God and less of me
[55:32] from the message of paradox
[55:37] I just know him that's all I want and to
[55:40] know him is life
[55:41] know these other things
[55:44] I don't know about it might identify as
[55:47] a smart man and he said I don't want to
[55:49] be a smart man I just want to know him
[55:52] I know him as Paul said in the power of
[55:56] his resurrection and we and when he
[55:59] calls all come out from among the dead
[56:01] that's all that's all and I want him I
[56:04] want him I want my name on the right
[56:07] place
[56:09] to know him in the power of his
[56:11] resurrection there's no fear of deaths
[56:15] there's no fear of the other side
[56:16] remember brother Branham talks about how
[56:19] he didn't know what heaven was like and
[56:21] he thought they were all going to be
[56:22] clouds and brother Neville would be one
[56:24] Cloud going by with a harp and this one
[56:26] you wouldn't know who they are
[56:28] but the angel asked him he said would
[56:30] you like to get a glimpse of what's on
[56:33] the other side
[56:34] and he said that would help me a whole
[56:38] lot
[56:39] amen I'd say the same thing yes Lord if
[56:42] I could just get a glimp what a problem
[56:44] what an anchor in our lives
[56:47] you know
[56:50] and then in God's provided place of
[56:52] worship
[56:53] it just kind of took him from the
[56:55] beginning towards the end and
[56:57] now remember in Christ we are flesh of
[56:59] his flesh bone of his bones
[57:02] when God was when God wounded Christ at
[57:04] Calvary he was wounded for me and you
[57:07] we are flesh of his flesh and bone of
[57:09] his bone body of his body name of his
[57:12] name bride of him
[57:14] so we are in him we are the Flesh and
[57:16] his bones and God has already raised us
[57:20] up potentially the quickening power that
[57:23] raises from a life of sin
[57:26] and changed our being has a potentiality
[57:30] raises has potentially raised us up in
[57:33] Christ Jesus which the resurrection will
[57:37] bring us forth in full maturity
[57:42] you know we think about it and
[57:45] some of you are close to that age where
[57:47] brother Branham said somewhere between
[57:49] 19 and 21 years old
[57:52] some of us some of you haven't got
[57:54] anywhere near that age yet
[57:56] and some of us are way down the road
[57:58] from that age
[58:01] but brother Ram talks about around that
[58:03] 19 to 21 years old
[58:08] now and Daniel don't take this
[58:10] personally please
[58:12] I got to be nice to him because he's a
[58:14] big boy
[58:16] they get to between 19 and 21 and
[58:19] they're hard to teach
[58:21] amen I've been there
[58:24] I've been there
[58:26] you get to that age and you you've come
[58:28] a long ways you've come a long ways at
[58:30] that age you've gone through school
[58:31] maybe you've gone through college some
[58:34] of us were married with Children already
[58:35] at that age
[58:37] and you got all and and sometimes we say
[58:39] well we know it all
[58:41] but now looking back from here 63
[58:43] looking back and I said man there's very
[58:45] little I really do know
[58:48] when my little grandson Asher and and
[58:52] Chloe at seven will tell me things
[58:55] and they'll repeat it just like they
[58:57] know it all
[58:59] but you know today has advanced so much
[59:02] it's so different you know
[59:05] but brother Branham says that between 19
[59:07] and when you're at the peak of your
[59:11] could you imagine that the energy the
[59:13] strength to run all day
[59:15] and all night and not have to take a nap
[59:18] for two weeks to get up the next day
[59:21] what a day that'll be
[59:24] but I have a promise
[59:26] of today
[59:28] not just necessarily looking down that a
[59:31] time whatever it is up ahead
[59:33] but something in my heart that says yeah
[59:36] that's part of that promise that's part
[59:38] of that Resurrection that's part of that
[59:40] life
[59:42] and I can have I can taste it I can know
[59:44] it today
[59:48] I remember hearing John chapter 11.
[59:54] we read this the last time
[59:56] in the resurrection of Lazarus verses 25
[1:00:00] 26 and
[1:00:03] Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:00:06] resurrection and the life
[1:00:09] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:00:12] dead yet shall he live
[1:00:15] so if the I am is living in you you have
[1:00:18] life and Resurrection in you
[1:00:21] it's getting and pushing aside
[1:00:24] that other part brother Branham says the
[1:00:27] gift
[1:00:28] is getting out of the way and letting
[1:00:32] God
[1:00:33] and that's our battle getting out of the
[1:00:36] way
[1:00:37] our mind begins to think our our actions
[1:00:40] our reactions to things that are going
[1:00:42] on and we begin to react to that and we
[1:00:44] can get nervous we can get afraid we can
[1:00:46] get upset and get angry over those
[1:00:48] things but if we would say hey Lord
[1:00:51] you handle this for me
[1:00:53] then you can be like David
[1:00:56] and I was listening to a sermon the
[1:00:58] other day and her brother was describing
[1:01:00] the size of Goliath
[1:01:03] and he might as well have been a tank
[1:01:05] coming at David
[1:01:08] but David didn't look at that he looked
[1:01:10] at the God who had been with him up to
[1:01:13] that day
[1:01:14] he said a bear came after me a lion came
[1:01:19] after me this happened and my God
[1:01:22] delivered me
[1:01:24] so this is no difference
[1:01:28] and he said and I you come at me with a
[1:01:31] with this I come at you with the great
[1:01:33] name of God our Jehovah God the god of
[1:01:36] Israel the god of our fathers
[1:01:39] and he says you're going down today
[1:01:42] that wasn't David speaking because David
[1:01:44] was a big man that was David speaking
[1:01:46] because he knew the big God
[1:01:50] that he served
[1:01:52] and here Jesus says I am the
[1:01:54] resurrection and the life and he that
[1:01:57] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:02:00] shall he live I was reading some in the
[1:02:02] questions and answers I've been going
[1:02:03] through that in in 64.
[1:02:06] and some of the questions do make you
[1:02:07] laugh
[1:02:08] because even brother Branham Chuckles
[1:02:10] and people ask him but there were
[1:02:12] questions that people asked you know
[1:02:14] and and and they ask over and over and I
[1:02:17] was reminding brother Daniel when he was
[1:02:19] ministering this morning
[1:02:21] they asked brother Branham this question
[1:02:23] he said so brother Brandon can we visit
[1:02:25] other churches or should we only go
[1:02:27] there when you are preaching
[1:02:31] and he says no no go and visit them
[1:02:34] they're your brothers they're your
[1:02:36] sisters fellowship with them and he said
[1:02:39] if all that you can get is a slice of
[1:02:42] bread get the slice of bread
[1:02:45] now that's the right Spirit to approach
[1:02:47] things that's the way that's what
[1:02:49] pleases God
[1:02:51] you know and you hear some of these
[1:02:53] things and some of the questions people
[1:02:55] have brother Branham are you God
[1:03:01] and you know brother Branham says
[1:03:03] there's two sides to that
[1:03:07] Christ in me
[1:03:10] but I'm not God
[1:03:13] you have to recognize the both
[1:03:16] you know you and I laugh sometimes at
[1:03:18] the questions they had but I wonder what
[1:03:19] we would ask I would been there at that
[1:03:20] time
[1:03:22] we've had time to see these things we've
[1:03:24] had time to learn of these things we've
[1:03:26] had time to grow in them
[1:03:28] yeah
[1:03:29] but he says I am the resurrection
[1:03:32] and though he were dead yes shall he
[1:03:34] live and whosoever liveth and believeth
[1:03:37] in me shall never die believeth all this
[1:03:42] they may lay you down in a grave but
[1:03:45] you're not in there anymore
[1:03:47] the body you were in is there
[1:03:49] but you've been you're going back to
[1:03:51] that you're crossing over to that other
[1:03:53] side
[1:03:54] I saw sister merrily raise her hand I
[1:03:57] know where brother Rod is today
[1:04:00] and he's a young man
[1:04:02] and he's a healthy young man
[1:04:05] and he's probably the catcher on the
[1:04:07] baseball team up there maybe not
[1:04:10] brother Rod love baseball
[1:04:13] but to think of that and brother random
[1:04:16] said it sure would help me a lot
[1:04:19] to see
[1:04:20] and when he comes by in the sweetness of
[1:04:23] his presence
[1:04:24] and when he ministers to you
[1:04:26] and your heart is just you know he's
[1:04:28] drawn up close to you
[1:04:30] or something that says yes it's real
[1:04:33] and I can live another day I can go
[1:04:35] forward yes I can Lord
[1:04:38] we say the same thing brother Lord it
[1:04:40] would help me a whole lot if you just
[1:04:42] come down one more time
[1:04:44] now we know that he's talking to you
[1:04:47] know Mary and Martha here because
[1:04:48] Lazarus has passed away
[1:04:52] and I I like this part as I was thinking
[1:04:55] about these things and it reminded me of
[1:04:57] something that Jesus had said
[1:05:00] in verse 41
[1:05:02] and they took away the Stone from the
[1:05:04] place where the dead was laid
[1:05:07] didn't say there that Lazarus was
[1:05:10] sleeping and said the dead was placed
[1:05:13] because they were still looking as
[1:05:15] Lazarus as dead
[1:05:19] but Jesus said he's sleeping
[1:05:23] is resting
[1:05:25] is she going to wake up real soon
[1:05:28] he says and Jesus lifted up his eyes and
[1:05:31] said father I thank thee that thou Hast
[1:05:36] heard me
[1:05:39] and that spoke to me but then this part
[1:05:41] and I know that thou herest me always
[1:05:46] and I believe as a child of God as a Son
[1:05:49] of God as a daughter of you got to come
[1:05:51] to that same place I know that you hear
[1:05:54] me and you have always heard me
[1:05:57] amen but then we put our part and you
[1:06:00] heard me but you haven't answered yet
[1:06:03] God says I've got my time it's got its
[1:06:07] place it's got its reason
[1:06:10] and you have to just say Lord then teach
[1:06:12] me Lord to wait
[1:06:14] but I like that he says lifted up his
[1:06:15] eyes and said father I thank thee that
[1:06:17] thou has heard me and I know that thou
[1:06:20] herest me always but because of the
[1:06:23] people which standby said it that they
[1:06:26] may believe that thou has sent me he
[1:06:28] didn't have any trouble coming up to
[1:06:30] going down to meet them knowing what was
[1:06:33] going to happen
[1:06:36] he didn't have to stop and have a
[1:06:38] two-week prayer meeting and fast and
[1:06:40] prepare he knew who he was
[1:06:44] and he said you always hear me Lord
[1:06:47] there was only one time that you'll ever
[1:06:50] hear him say where are you God
[1:06:54] when he willingly gave his life on the
[1:06:56] cross
[1:06:58] and he said father my father my God why
[1:07:01] hath Thou forsaken me
[1:07:04] so that he would know where we were at
[1:07:07] and how we felt
[1:07:09] and he could stand in our place
[1:07:13] and then he laid down his life
[1:07:17] and when he had thus spoken he crowded
[1:07:20] cried with a loud voice
[1:07:22] said Lazarus come forth
[1:07:26] and he that was dead came forth bound
[1:07:28] hand and foot with grave clothes and his
[1:07:31] face was bounded out with a napkin Jesus
[1:07:33] said unto them loose him and let him go
[1:07:39] I don't think it took Lazarus a couple
[1:07:41] weeks to remember how to walk again
[1:07:43] I would say Lazarus came out there fully
[1:07:45] with life
[1:07:48] you know and and maybe if we have time
[1:07:50] we'll hear something about that brother
[1:07:52] Brandon said in a testimony
[1:07:56] so we're talking about here you know it
[1:07:59] will Quicken
[1:08:01] it'll bring to life your body he says so
[1:08:04] I looked up the word Quicken
[1:08:07] and um
[1:08:11] and and here is quickening is when a a
[1:08:14] woman that has a child starts to fill
[1:08:17] the baby's movement in their womb it
[1:08:20] feels like flutters bubbles or tiny
[1:08:23] pulses
[1:08:25] and it just stopped me and I said there
[1:08:27] is an Evidence
[1:08:29] that you know that he's alive in you
[1:08:35] I've been a Christian for 50 years now
[1:08:37] and nobody knows
[1:08:41] no
[1:08:42] it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:08:45] galosh Colossians 1 27 Christ in you the
[1:08:49] hope of glory
[1:08:51] but there's a maturing there's a growing
[1:08:53] there's a way of learning to get
[1:08:55] yourself out of the way
[1:08:57] and letting God have the preeminence
[1:09:01] and that's your biggest battle getting
[1:09:03] yourself out of the way
[1:09:05] but I'm tired today
[1:09:07] I I'm I I've had a long day of work
[1:09:09] these things happen I'm not feeling well
[1:09:13] um I'm going to rest for a little while
[1:09:14] then I'm going to get up and pray and
[1:09:16] the next thing you know you've been
[1:09:17] asleep for four hours
[1:09:18] the desire is right but you battled this
[1:09:20] flesh
[1:09:22] you know but but here it is it's a
[1:09:25] quickening the word Quicken is used in
[1:09:27] in the King James version of the Bible
[1:09:29] it's something if something is living
[1:09:33] it's quick or too quick and something is
[1:09:36] to be brought to life to restore to a
[1:09:39] former flourish flourishing condition
[1:09:44] a former flourishing a life a health
[1:09:49] you were part of him way back from the
[1:09:52] beginning
[1:09:53] I didn't make these words up
[1:09:55] this is what dictionaries and people
[1:09:58] have this is the meaning that's why God
[1:10:00] used these words in the scriptures
[1:10:03] so we could see that
[1:10:06] and it says
[1:10:11] King James quickened Me O Lord for thy
[1:10:14] name say bring me to life for your name
[1:10:17] namesake Lord preserve my life
[1:10:20] for the sake of Your Name Lord revive me
[1:10:24] and to revive to restore your restoring
[1:10:27] back to the original what you were
[1:10:28] already
[1:10:30] I looked at it this way I said it this
[1:10:32] way and I'm going to go back to the cars
[1:10:36] that I remember as a young boy my aunts
[1:10:38] and my uncles and you know from the
[1:10:40] early 60s and in the 50s and the big one
[1:10:43] was the 57 Chevy
[1:10:45] if I wanted to restore a 57 Chevy I
[1:10:49] can't start with a 61 Ford
[1:10:53] I've got to start with a 57 Chevy to
[1:10:56] restore so you can't start with
[1:10:58] something that wasn't part of God in the
[1:11:00] first place
[1:11:01] you start with if you're restoring back
[1:11:04] to what you were you had to be part of
[1:11:06] him in the beginning
[1:11:07] now I can't explain that I couldn't make
[1:11:09] you understand it but Christ in you
[1:11:12] is the hope of glory and that would say
[1:11:14] yeah that's me
[1:11:17] so it's a restoring Reviving
[1:11:22] it and it says
[1:11:25] the spirit that quickeneth because the
[1:11:28] flesh profiteth nothing
[1:11:32] you can take care of it you can give it
[1:11:35] the best vitamins
[1:11:37] you could treat one but eventually it's
[1:11:40] going to die
[1:11:43] but if that same spirit that raised
[1:11:47] Christ from the dead dwell in you
[1:11:51] it will Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:11:59] and you know I was thinking about this
[1:12:01] as for several days now or maybe a
[1:12:04] couple of weeks
[1:12:06] and and just the different scriptures
[1:12:08] and the things that God allows us to
[1:12:11] remember
[1:12:13] and we go to Acts chapter 2.
[1:12:17] and we'll read verses one through four
[1:12:21] very common scriptures we read them a
[1:12:23] lot we hear them a lot
[1:12:27] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:12:30] come they were all with one Accord in
[1:12:32] one place
[1:12:34] and I don't think that changes
[1:12:39] well he can come and get into that same
[1:12:41] atmosphere
[1:12:42] that same place this is a promise of God
[1:12:46] I'll take God at his word and we'll
[1:12:48] gather under that same attitude under
[1:12:50] that same spirit
[1:12:52] there's no telling what God can do
[1:12:55] what God will do
[1:12:57] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:12:59] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[1:13:02] if filled the house where they were
[1:13:04] sitting
[1:13:05] and there appeared unto them cloven
[1:13:08] tongues like as a fire and it sat upon
[1:13:10] each of them
[1:13:12] and they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:14] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:13:18] a spirit gave them utterance
[1:13:23] I'm just wondering who was recording
[1:13:25] this
[1:13:27] was that the 121st person in there
[1:13:31] that sat on the side with the video
[1:13:32] camera and said this is what happened on
[1:13:35] the day of Pentecost
[1:13:37] no I believe God made sure someone
[1:13:41] had those words recorded because you and
[1:13:43] I were going to read them
[1:13:44] when that day was fully come
[1:13:48] God had set a time and a place
[1:13:52] and it had come that day and God keeps
[1:13:56] his word
[1:13:58] God makes every one of his appointments
[1:14:02] you know sometimes you you prepare and
[1:14:05] you plan and you go
[1:14:07] and then you get a call and saying I'm
[1:14:09] sorry we're not going to be available
[1:14:10] that day you made all your plans you've
[1:14:12] got everything ready and then you have
[1:14:14] to cancel and you have to
[1:14:16] but God doesn't work that way
[1:14:19] God said it he does it
[1:14:22] and and and if you think you're Desiring
[1:14:25] it how much more him Desiring to give it
[1:14:29] to you to share it with you
[1:14:32] we had the kids over at the house on
[1:14:34] Friday and Saturday for Chloe's birthday
[1:14:38] and I was tired
[1:14:40] my body was hurting and all and they
[1:14:44] surprised me a little bit and not really
[1:14:46] the kind of surprises you like to get
[1:14:49] I knew they were coming Friday but
[1:14:51] nobody told me they were spending the
[1:14:52] night all of the my nieces and nephews
[1:14:55] all of them
[1:14:57] and I was tired
[1:14:59] and I was achy and I was a little bit
[1:15:02] grumpy
[1:15:04] it was just a little bit right
[1:15:05] oh she said like that no and and they
[1:15:08] were going to spend the night and I know
[1:15:10] they want Papa's attention they want to
[1:15:12] do stuff with it they want you know and
[1:15:14] I was like oh my this is going to be a
[1:15:15] long night yeah
[1:15:17] but the joy of watching Chloe open her
[1:15:20] presents get the Happy Birthday song to
[1:15:22] her it was worth it all the happiness
[1:15:25] the joy and and I know you've been
[1:15:27] through some hard times I know you're
[1:15:29] going through hard times and until we
[1:15:31] leave this life and get into the other
[1:15:33] one there will be more hard times but
[1:15:35] the joy that the father gets
[1:15:38] when he sees his children
[1:15:41] when he sees you accepting receiving
[1:15:44] believing and beginning to display what
[1:15:47] he's already seen in you
[1:15:50] you know when Chloe comes up to me and
[1:15:53] she hugs me and she says I love you Papa
[1:15:56] it's okay if I'm tired it's okay if I'm
[1:15:58] hurting it's worth it all
[1:16:02] when God sees that and his heart just
[1:16:04] begins to these are mine these are my
[1:16:07] children
[1:16:09] now they were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:12] that resurrection power now is limit
[1:16:14] because there was a Same Spirit that
[1:16:16] raised Christ from the dead
[1:16:20] you know and it's the same spirit that
[1:16:21] will raise you and me from the dead
[1:16:24] now we go to Acts chapter 1.
[1:16:30] verses 3.
[1:16:32] I mean chapter 3 verses 1 to 6.
[1:16:39] now this is after the day of Pentecost
[1:16:42] after the Holy Ghost had come upon them
[1:16:44] they had already done a lot of Wonder
[1:16:46] signs Wonder Jesus when he sends them
[1:16:49] out you know they're healing they're
[1:16:50] going but there were some times when
[1:16:52] they said we tried we tried but we
[1:16:54] couldn't
[1:16:55] now watch this
[1:16:58] now in Peter and John went together into
[1:17:00] the temple at the outer prayer being the
[1:17:03] ninth hour I find that interesting this
[1:17:05] is right after they received the Holy
[1:17:08] Ghost and Peter and them they they
[1:17:11] preached to them and there are many
[1:17:13] baptized and all
[1:17:15] and the next day the church was open
[1:17:17] they went to church
[1:17:21] I've heard some people say well now that
[1:17:22] I've got the Holy Ghost I don't need
[1:17:24] church I don't no even more so we would
[1:17:26] be drawing together we should be pulling
[1:17:28] together we should be encouraging one
[1:17:31] another we should be uplifting there
[1:17:32] should be a desire brother Brandon makes
[1:17:34] that statement and he says there'll come
[1:17:36] a time he says when you can't hardly
[1:17:38] stand and you want the doors open you
[1:17:41] want to come
[1:17:42] and I don't think it's going to because
[1:17:44] of the pressure but rather the desire in
[1:17:47] your heart just to serve him to love him
[1:17:49] to be in his presence
[1:17:52] I think some people are waiting to be
[1:17:54] forced to want to come into church
[1:17:56] but it should be our desire
[1:18:00] and a certain man lame from his mother's
[1:18:02] womb was carried whom they laid daily at
[1:18:06] the gate at the temple which is called
[1:18:08] Beautiful to ask alms of them
[1:18:10] that entered into the temple
[1:18:13] so if Peter and John went to the temple
[1:18:15] they saw this man quite often because it
[1:18:17] was he was there all the time
[1:18:20] now something had changed in Peter and
[1:18:23] John
[1:18:25] I know I'm not saying that when they saw
[1:18:27] him they didn't feel sorry for him maybe
[1:18:29] they did pray for him one time maybe
[1:18:31] they had asked God I don't know but
[1:18:33] something had changed
[1:18:35] foreign
[1:18:38] Peter and John about to go into the
[1:18:40] temple ask hey do you can you give me
[1:18:43] something ask alms can you know I'm
[1:18:46] hungry can you help out
[1:18:49] and Peter fastening his eyes upon him
[1:18:52] with John said look on us
[1:18:59] and he gave heed to them expecting to
[1:19:02] receive something of them
[1:19:05] now
[1:19:06] this man probably saw them Peter and
[1:19:09] John walking through there too
[1:19:11] because they went to church they
[1:19:13] gathered they were meeting they were you
[1:19:15] know and and so he's looking and he's
[1:19:18] saying
[1:19:19] um could you guys help me out maybe they
[1:19:21] had helped him out before we don't know
[1:19:22] that
[1:19:24] but there's something that had changed
[1:19:26] here
[1:19:27] then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I
[1:19:31] None
[1:19:33] but such as I have give I Thee
[1:19:39] what a change in Peter and John's life
[1:19:41] that they knew they had that same
[1:19:44] Authority and power that they watched
[1:19:46] Jesus
[1:19:49] that they could say in the name of Jesus
[1:19:52] Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk
[1:20:00] it was Christ in them now
[1:20:03] and you know it's not no different for
[1:20:06] me and you
[1:20:08] it's Christ in you
[1:20:11] the hope of glory it's Christ in you the
[1:20:15] help to someone else it's Christ in you
[1:20:18] to give life
[1:20:22] you know and and
[1:20:24] brother Branham would get behind the
[1:20:27] pulpit
[1:20:28] and because he loved the people he would
[1:20:31] wear himself down to nothing
[1:20:35] especially when he was a younger man
[1:20:38] and he gave his all because of his love
[1:20:42] for people
[1:20:46] there was nothing about him making money
[1:20:49] off of it it was nothing about
[1:20:50] popularity it was his love for the
[1:20:53] people
[1:20:54] that caused him to do that
[1:20:57] and and here's Peter here's John and we
[1:21:00] know reading through and and how each
[1:21:02] one of them gave their lives for this
[1:21:04] gospel
[1:21:06] but they had seen a resurrected Jesus
[1:21:09] Christ
[1:21:11] and now these very promises that he
[1:21:13] heard were no longer promises they heard
[1:21:15] but a belief a revelation something that
[1:21:17] was living down inside them
[1:21:21] that they could stand in the face like
[1:21:23] David that says you're a big man and you
[1:21:26] have all of this but I got a greater God
[1:21:28] that's greater than you and I know him
[1:21:31] I've experienced him he's met with me
[1:21:33] he's been there with me he's never
[1:21:35] failed me
[1:21:38] and you take a look at David later as a
[1:21:41] king and in his failures and in his
[1:21:44] faults and his mistakes
[1:21:46] causing people to die and all these
[1:21:49] things that have happened
[1:21:50] but he was still a son of God
[1:21:54] and it's his throne
[1:21:57] that the son of a hand Son of God was in
[1:21:59] the on David's throne
[1:22:02] don't look at your life as wasted lost
[1:22:04] no hope I've made a mess you're a child
[1:22:08] of God
[1:22:11] and you'll be there
[1:22:13] because not a one of them will be lost
[1:22:15] not of one of them all that the father
[1:22:18] has given me will come
[1:22:22] now I will say this to you you don't
[1:22:24] know who they are all
[1:22:26] so give each one a chance
[1:22:28] give each one an opportunity
[1:22:32] because that one could be waiting on you
[1:22:36] you might be that little bit of water or
[1:22:38] Sunshine that they need to get that
[1:22:40] growing
[1:22:42] sometimes they sure don't look like it
[1:22:46] but us I know we were all Angels when
[1:22:48] God saved us
[1:22:49] no we weren't we needed salvation like
[1:22:51] anybody else
[1:22:53] and I like that such as I have I give
[1:22:57] thee in the name of Jesus Christ o
[1:23:00] Nazareth rise up and walk and if you
[1:23:02] read the rest of that testimony he was
[1:23:04] up and jumping and shouting and praising
[1:23:06] God in the temple
[1:23:08] it doesn't change
[1:23:10] and you know
[1:23:12] you go back and and I like to do this
[1:23:14] sometimes and just go through the prayer
[1:23:16] lines and listen to what God is doing
[1:23:20] let's know how God's Mercy is reaching
[1:23:22] out to different ones
[1:23:24] and sometimes we might get a little
[1:23:26] critical we might get a little um
[1:23:29] well we know better you know attitude
[1:23:33] but I read some of those things I really
[1:23:35] see how brother Branham handled but it
[1:23:37] wasn't brother Brandon it was a spirit
[1:23:38] of Christ working in a man that yielded
[1:23:41] himself and let himself say Lord you use
[1:23:43] me you speak you say
[1:23:46] Sister Sister he says I see you're a
[1:23:48] Christian in fact you're a minister
[1:23:53] and he's outside well sister you are
[1:23:55] wrong and condemn her he says go God
[1:23:58] bless you
[1:24:02] you and I might have a little problem
[1:24:04] with that
[1:24:07] but no the spirit of Christ is not uh
[1:24:11] could I say is not held back it's it's
[1:24:14] not uh hampered
[1:24:17] by someone who we might think is not
[1:24:19] right
[1:24:21] greater than is he that is in me than he
[1:24:24] that is in the world and I read that
[1:24:27] sometimes I say Lord what an attitude
[1:24:28] what a way how we should look at
[1:24:31] ourselves let let my spirit my attitude
[1:24:34] say hey that person
[1:24:37] could know just if they could get to
[1:24:39] know the Lord themselves or they are a
[1:24:41] Christian praise God
[1:24:43] I've had the opportunity with some folks
[1:24:46] in in going into their homes and and
[1:24:49] working in their homes
[1:24:50] you get a little bit of both I've walked
[1:24:53] into some where there's there's a really
[1:24:55] harsh spirit in there
[1:24:57] but I just have to remember greater is
[1:24:59] he that is in me than he that is in the
[1:25:01] world
[1:25:03] and and but let my light shine
[1:25:06] is there something I could say is there
[1:25:08] some way I could act that they would say
[1:25:10] what is that what is it you got
[1:25:14] sharing a testimony with a young couple
[1:25:16] they had they had just a little child
[1:25:18] with him and I was doing some work in
[1:25:20] there they looked to be in their early
[1:25:21] 20s with just maybe a two or three year
[1:25:23] old and we got to talking got to talking
[1:25:25] to them a little bit and sharing
[1:25:27] testimonies of of God's hidden power and
[1:25:30] and how God has has kept us and all and
[1:25:33] you just see if there's some reception
[1:25:35] there maybe they will some will turn you
[1:25:37] off real quick and some will listen
[1:25:41] and so I began to share some testimonies
[1:25:44] and I shared the testimony of of the
[1:25:46] life given back to the little bird
[1:25:48] when my daughter Sarah was a little girl
[1:25:50] and and and she was always at Grandpa's
[1:25:53] house
[1:25:54] and my father had always taught us that
[1:25:57] he's a living God
[1:25:59] he's the same yesterday today he still
[1:26:01] does Miracles he doesn't change he
[1:26:03] always emphasized that to us in our
[1:26:05] lives and and Sarah had brought this
[1:26:08] little little bird to to Grandpa that
[1:26:12] had somehow Tangled itself up in some
[1:26:14] string and it strangled itself
[1:26:16] and it was dead it was it was hard
[1:26:18] didn't it and she says Grandpa look at
[1:26:21] the little birdie so she takes it to to
[1:26:23] Grandpa my dad
[1:26:25] and my dad just sits here I want to show
[1:26:27] you about this God that we serve and he
[1:26:30] unwrapped the string and he said little
[1:26:31] birdie in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:33] Christ I give you back your life and
[1:26:35] that little bird Sarah will tell you
[1:26:36] jumped up tweeted and flew up to the
[1:26:38] tree
[1:26:41] so you can't tell her that God doesn't
[1:26:43] do those things because she's seen it
[1:26:45] you've come a little too late to tell me
[1:26:47] that God doesn't do that because I've
[1:26:48] seen him move
[1:26:50] so I shared this with him now she had
[1:26:52] big wide eyes like but he stopped and he
[1:26:55] goes sure
[1:26:56] he said quietly in Poland he goes I just
[1:27:00] can't believe that that can't beat you
[1:27:03] through and it hurt
[1:27:05] because I know it's true and I said Lord
[1:27:08] don't let them turn you away
[1:27:11] but I just kept sharing with them what I
[1:27:13] could
[1:27:14] to get them I we shared my me and
[1:27:17] Stephen were in a house and and the way
[1:27:19] she was dressed I just said where do you
[1:27:22] guys go to church we go to this
[1:27:24] Pentecostal Church down there and we
[1:27:25] begin talking about the testimonies of
[1:27:27] the goodness of God
[1:27:30] and and and and she they were both
[1:27:32] recovering
[1:27:34] from a drug addictions and they had just
[1:27:36] gotten their children back
[1:27:39] praise God for that we gave glory to the
[1:27:42] Lord he still got that works
[1:27:46] it's an attitude it's it's something
[1:27:48] that's hey there's life in me and I can
[1:27:51] give it
[1:27:55] and different things that have happened
[1:27:57] in our lives that we just know that God
[1:27:59] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:28:03] he changes not
[1:28:05] and you know when you have a product you
[1:28:09] like I get asked quite often by the the
[1:28:12] ladies of the home mostly
[1:28:15] because they're the ones that do the
[1:28:16] cleaning
[1:28:17] what do I do how do I keep my cabinets
[1:28:20] clean
[1:28:22] and then I have to say I don't know I
[1:28:23] asked my wife no I don't say that
[1:28:26] I I know some products that are good
[1:28:29] products good tested products they work
[1:28:32] well and I know some of the ones you
[1:28:33] shouldn't use
[1:28:35] because I've seen their failures
[1:28:37] so we'll share with them these products
[1:28:39] are good this is what oh my grandma used
[1:28:43] yeah well that product's been around
[1:28:45] that long time because it's a good
[1:28:46] product
[1:28:48] it hasn't failed
[1:28:50] um
[1:28:51] you know don't wax your cabinets
[1:28:55] because it builds up wax and then it
[1:28:56] flakes off and then they call me and say
[1:28:58] my mother finish on my cabinet is
[1:29:00] falling off
[1:29:01] and I have to tell them no it's that
[1:29:03] layer of wax you put on them
[1:29:05] now you have to take it off yourself
[1:29:08] but there's some really good products
[1:29:10] and you can share those things how to
[1:29:11] take care of how to
[1:29:14] and that's just in the natural
[1:29:17] but I was talking to this it was an
[1:29:19] older couple and we were working in
[1:29:21] their house
[1:29:22] and um
[1:29:24] she said some to me and I said yes I'm a
[1:29:26] Christian and she said well there's
[1:29:27] something about your spirit that's sweet
[1:29:30] she was probably in her 70s maybe or so
[1:29:33] so we got to talk and she goes well me
[1:29:35] and my husband Minister and it was for
[1:29:37] victory Assemblies of God which has
[1:29:39] changed its name now I think Zion or
[1:29:41] something like that changed the name she
[1:29:43] says we have we have apartment
[1:29:45] Ministries so I was in there for about
[1:29:47] an hour replacing some broken parts
[1:29:49] everything and we had just a wonderful
[1:29:51] time of Fellowship
[1:29:52] and sharing the gospel
[1:29:55] I didn't tell him they were going to
[1:29:57] hell because they didn't believe it the
[1:29:58] way I believed it
[1:30:00] I didn't tell him that I told him Jesus
[1:30:02] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:30:04] forever I began to share with them the
[1:30:07] goodness of God in my life
[1:30:10] and as I got ready to leave
[1:30:13] she said can we pray for you
[1:30:16] she's a lady a sister no thank you
[1:30:20] no I said please
[1:30:22] Alex why not
[1:30:25] it's better than you cursing me out the
[1:30:27] house
[1:30:28] pray for me that'll be good
[1:30:31] her and her husband came up they took
[1:30:33] some oil
[1:30:34] and she said I really feel like I should
[1:30:36] pray for your eyes
[1:30:39] and my eyes have been given me a lot of
[1:30:41] problems
[1:30:43] and she said that to me she laid her
[1:30:45] hands on me and she prayed
[1:30:47] there was such a sweetness about it
[1:30:51] God takes care of his own
[1:30:57] I had I've had some that oh Lord help us
[1:31:01] but that's okay
[1:31:03] be a light around him
[1:31:06] share your testimony
[1:31:08] you know and then you can say because
[1:31:10] I've got a king
[1:31:13] I've got someone who's coming to take me
[1:31:15] home back with him
[1:31:18] there's something in me that calls out
[1:31:20] from that which I'm from
[1:31:22] I have a representation there
[1:31:26] I I don't remember it in this body
[1:31:30] but there are sometimes that he comes by
[1:31:32] and there's something that he stirs up
[1:31:35] that He blesses that he anoints that he
[1:31:38] comes and ministers to and something
[1:31:40] says yeah that's that part calling back
[1:31:43] to that which he knew from before the
[1:31:45] foundation everywhere
[1:31:47] so we're going to play a portion of this
[1:31:50] this message
[1:31:52] from the paradox
[1:31:54] and it's there where brother Branham is
[1:31:57] going out hunting
[1:31:58] and he re runs into the the uh the man
[1:32:01] there that owns the property
[1:32:03] and and
[1:32:05] brother Brandon says sends a brother
[1:32:07] Woods in just in case because he's the
[1:32:09] pastor and says I'll stay back
[1:32:12] so if they'll play that it's it's maybe
[1:32:14] 10 minutes long or somewhere around that
[1:32:17] I could read it to you for 10 minutes or
[1:32:19] we could just hear it so
[1:32:22] we could get that
[1:32:29] he had just come up to their property
[1:32:32] wanting a squirrel hunt there
[1:32:35] with brother Woods
[1:32:39] you know how it is back the country they
[1:32:40] just have one another and they
[1:32:43] look too bad we don't do that around the
[1:32:44] big cities so they um they said we and
[1:32:47] it was going to die and said well I
[1:32:49] thought well that's her I said well it's
[1:32:51] late we can't get her body out the
[1:32:52] morning said I'll get my wagon I'll go
[1:32:54] up there and get her and haul her out so
[1:32:55] we can take her to the over to
[1:32:57] Campbellsville Kentucky about 40 miles
[1:32:59] from there to the Undertaker so the
[1:33:01] Undertaker had come to the main road
[1:33:02] which is about eight miles ten miles out
[1:33:04] that he can pick her body up from there
[1:33:05] so no need to go over there at night
[1:33:07] there'll just be crying say we'll just
[1:33:08] wait till daylight said you know the
[1:33:10] next morning when I went up there that
[1:33:11] woman had cooked some fried apple pies
[1:33:13] and her husband set the table eating and
[1:33:16] she was living on barley water
[1:33:18] I thought oh
[1:33:21] I said
[1:33:22] oh no now wait a minute I said that you
[1:33:26] don't believe that
[1:33:28] he said and you don't believe it
[1:33:30] and I said well you was the one who said
[1:33:33] it I thought oh boy you go preach to me
[1:33:36] now
[1:33:38] he said you don't believe it I said man
[1:33:40] do you mean to tell me such a thing as
[1:33:42] that could happen in all these
[1:33:43] scientific age where we have the best
[1:33:44] doctor he said if you don't believe it
[1:33:46] I'll take your parent prove it to you
[1:33:47] now the Infidel 3 said to me about God
[1:33:50] I said well you uh you mean that he said
[1:33:54] yes I said well what was it he said I
[1:33:57] want to do if I ever meet that man I'm
[1:33:59] going to ask him what in the world it
[1:34:02] was that told him about that and how he
[1:34:04] know that woman but be well see so I'm
[1:34:07] going to ask him about that
[1:34:08] I said
[1:34:09] well that'd be a good thing
[1:34:13] and I said um
[1:34:15] see you mind if I have one in apples and
[1:34:18] it's laying on the ground fall of the
[1:34:19] year you know second week in August and
[1:34:22] the leaves have dropped off the tree and
[1:34:23] the apples are there and just die
[1:34:24] samples I picked it up and rubbed it on
[1:34:26] these little dirty pants and went to eat
[1:34:27] as you like them he said yeah help
[1:34:29] yourself the yellow jackets
[1:34:32] so he said the yellow jackets eat them
[1:34:34] up and you help yourself so I said all
[1:34:36] right so I went to eat I said boy it's a
[1:34:38] fine apple he said oh yes I planted that
[1:34:40] tree there myself 50 years ago
[1:34:43] that's strange I said um hey you know
[1:34:47] we're going to have an early fall
[1:34:49] I said you look there I said I wonder
[1:34:50] why them leaves are dropping off that
[1:34:53] tree before we even have a cool night
[1:34:56] August the hottest oh he said the life
[1:34:58] lifted
[1:35:00] what was that what it does say he said
[1:35:01] yes the attorney yelling drop it off I
[1:35:03] said where'd the life go
[1:35:05] he said it went down into the root
[1:35:09] I said well uh how what did it do that
[1:35:12] for
[1:35:13] see he said well it's because if you
[1:35:16] don't if it don't go down in the root he
[1:35:18] said the winner will kill the tree The
[1:35:19] Germ of life is in the in the the sap
[1:35:22] it's in the tree it goes down at the
[1:35:24] roof they bought a beautiful testimony
[1:35:26] there to see if death burial and
[1:35:27] Resurrection I said then uh what happens
[1:35:31] then does it stay down there I said no
[1:35:33] no
[1:35:34] as it comes back the next spring and
[1:35:35] brings you a bunch of apples
[1:35:40] and then
[1:35:41] you say you never seen God
[1:35:44] he said well that's just nature
[1:35:46] I said is that right that's true
[1:35:48] I said I want to ask you something about
[1:35:51] just nature tell me what intelligence
[1:35:54] of orange that tree that sap in the free
[1:35:57] it has no intelligence of its own
[1:35:59] but what intelligence runs that sap
[1:36:02] Down's Roots they get down here and hide
[1:36:03] in the depths of the earth now until All
[1:36:06] the Troubles passed that'll bring you
[1:36:08] back up again
[1:36:09] tell me the life that was in the leaf
[1:36:12] just the body to die the leaf dropped
[1:36:15] off the life itself went down coming
[1:36:17] back with the news I said the life hit
[1:36:20] went out in the ground Joel was I said
[1:36:23] like that all high me in the green
[1:36:26] he's seen the tribulation coming of
[1:36:28] course they Noah said hide he said well
[1:36:32] that's just nature
[1:36:33] and I said mister
[1:36:35] I said if I put a bucket of water out
[1:36:37] here on the post
[1:36:39] and then every August that water runs
[1:36:43] out the bottom of the post
[1:36:44] and then it's spring the year it'll come
[1:36:45] back up in a bucket again
[1:36:47] he said oh no you don't have any life I
[1:36:49] said very hard it's life
[1:36:52] I said see that's God
[1:36:55] he said you know I never thought of that
[1:36:58] I said tell me you what does that he
[1:37:00] said I don't know I don't know what does
[1:37:02] it I said it's Nation I said well who
[1:37:04] controls nature
[1:37:05] is nature an intelligence
[1:37:08] he said well I never had thought of it
[1:37:10] just like that I said I'll tell you I'm
[1:37:11] going out here squirrel hunting it's all
[1:37:13] right I said help yourself and I said
[1:37:14] when I come back when I come back you've
[1:37:18] studied real hard now and when I come
[1:37:20] back you tell me what intelligence that
[1:37:24] tells that life in that tree to go down
[1:37:26] in the root and come back next spring
[1:37:28] and I'll tell you what the same thing
[1:37:30] that told me that woman was going to
[1:37:32] live up there that had the cancer except
[1:37:34] told you
[1:37:36] I said yes sir
[1:37:38] he said are you that preacher
[1:37:40] I said yes sir
[1:37:43] and there are that tree that afternoon a
[1:37:46] simple little thing like that I'll let
[1:37:48] him to Christ amen tears running down
[1:37:51] his cheeks
[1:37:52] a year later I went down I pulled my
[1:37:55] truck up in the yard and moved away and
[1:37:56] he was gone he died
[1:37:59] and when I come back the lady was
[1:38:01] standing there to give me a baller now
[1:38:03] for honey on posted ground he told me
[1:38:05] honey anytime I wanted to she wasn't
[1:38:06] didn't hear him say that so I come up I
[1:38:09] said I I'm sorry I said I come here
[1:38:11] early this morning and park the car here
[1:38:13] before you just did so damn Indiana
[1:38:14] license on there I said yes ma'am I said
[1:38:17] your husband so my husband's been dead
[1:38:19] almost a year she started peeling ankles
[1:38:21] on the back porch all that same tree and
[1:38:24] I said well he told me before he died so
[1:38:26] I don't believe it I said I'm sitting
[1:38:29] right out there one day and I said now I
[1:38:31] come up and I was talking to him they
[1:38:33] said he was a infidel
[1:38:37] I said yes man he said forget me hey
[1:38:41] she said forget
[1:38:43] him she said he died
[1:38:46] knowing is that leaf come back he'd come
[1:38:48] back again

[1:38:54] amen
[1:38:56] the same
[1:38:58] we watch the leaves
[1:39:00] fall off some of our trees

[1:39:09] would come up what a promise we have
[1:39:12] if that same spirit that raised Christ
[1:39:15] from the dead
[1:39:16] dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal
[1:39:20] bodies
[1:39:21] it will Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:39:25] let's pray
[1:39:28] what a promise we have Lord
[1:39:31] but what a greater promise keeper we
[1:39:33] have Lord
[1:39:35] many have given promises
[1:39:39] and they were not able to keep them
[1:39:41] [Music]

[1:40:21] Lord
[1:40:23] we call Our Lord hasten that day Lord
[1:40:27] the Lord let us be a living testimony
[1:40:30] as we heard brother Branham here
[1:40:32] ministering to that man and heard the
[1:40:34] results of just a few moments
[1:40:39] of him giving his life to you and there
[1:40:42] when he was dying he was praising and
[1:40:44] worshiping you Lord
[1:40:46] knowing that his redeemerative sorry
[1:40:49] it'll be the same for each one of us
[1:40:51] lord always
[1:40:53] don't let us get disappointed when we
[1:40:55] fail Lord
[1:40:57] when things seem to go wrong
[1:40:59] when seeing things seem to go hard and
[1:41:02] we're seeming to have to learn the
[1:41:03] lesson all over again Lord
[1:41:06] let us just remember Lord
[1:41:09] that you're mindful of us
[1:41:11] and your word you keep your word you're
[1:41:13] true you're faithful Lord
[1:41:16] you never

[1:43:19] that meeting was in a place called Acton
[1:43:22] Kentucky if I remember right
[1:43:25] there and there was a man
[1:43:28] that was in New Albany Indiana
[1:43:32] and he had suffered with stomach
[1:43:34] problems
[1:43:35] for most of his life
[1:43:38] and
[1:43:40] he heard about this man William Branham
[1:43:43] that had this gift of healing
[1:43:47] and
[1:43:49] he said if I could just get to that man
[1:43:52] then I know I will be healed
[1:43:56] so he found out that
[1:43:58] this man William Branham was going to be
[1:44:00] down and acting Kentucky at the Acton
[1:44:04] Campground
[1:44:05] he drove
[1:44:07] all the way down from New Albany Indiana
[1:44:10] and he got into the prayer line the same
[1:44:13] I believe the same prayer line
[1:44:15] that this lady that brother Aaron was
[1:44:17] talking about
[1:44:19] was there that was dying
[1:44:22] he comes up
[1:44:26] to the platform
[1:44:29] and brother Branham
[1:44:32] tells him his name
[1:44:34] says your name is wheeler
[1:44:37] he said you're suffering from colitis
[1:44:41] he says go and be healed in the name of
[1:44:44] the Lord Jesus
[1:44:46] the same
[1:44:48] same
[1:44:50] um
[1:44:51] meetings I believe
