[32:55] she was diagnosed with breast cancer and
[32:58] has gone through chemo treatments right
[33:00] now and is in a lot of pain
[33:03] we've got a high priest that can be
[33:05] touched by the feeling of that infirmity
[33:07] feels our pain he knows it
[33:10] but also our sisters Grace and Lily and
[33:15] Rachel are traveling this evening going
[33:17] to
[33:18] Youth Camp Back East so we want to pray
[33:21] not just for traveling mercies but that
[33:23] the Lord will meet them at this camp and
[33:25] bless them and just refill them with the
[33:27] Holy Ghost and every good thing amen
[33:29] let's stand together if you have a need
[33:31] on your heart
[33:34] here's a
[33:35] there's something of praise to raise our
[33:38] faith this uh brother Josiah McGrady the
[33:41] sister yarbrough's great-grandson
[33:45] there's a testimony that when he was in
[33:47] the womb they thought his brain had some
[33:50] serious complications and they were
[33:52] doctors were very concerned after a
[33:54] number of tests and they thought for the
[33:57] doctors thought for sure that his brain
[33:58] would be malformed and inadequate but
[34:03] he's been born there's been a lot of
[34:06] prayer and they've they've run another
[34:07] MRI now and they said his brain is
[34:10] normal
[34:12] praise the Lord amen
[34:16] that's a miracle in my book
[34:19] thankful for that and also there was a
[34:20] prayer request I saw for a brother a
[34:22] pastor back East whose son was in a
[34:24] motorcycle accident and you know that
[34:26] can be uh
[34:28] the end very easily but I saw an update
[34:31] that he was stable and and I believe the
[34:34] Lord moved on that scene as well so
[34:37] let's just approach the Lord and faith
[34:40] [Music]
[34:43] let's pray
[34:45] gracious Heavenly Father we just
[34:49] our children looking unto you
[34:53] because you're our high priest
[34:56] the Lord we encounter the joy that we
[34:59] can bring in requests
[35:00] [Music]
[35:03] and the things that are hidden in our
[35:05] hearts Lord those things you even see
[35:11] Lord if there's any need amongst this
[35:15] people in this house Lord
[35:18] it would be just to draw closer to you
[35:22] for if we have faith just to touch you
[35:28] all those needs would
[35:32] be supplied
[35:34] before Lord you sustain us
[35:37] with our necessity
[35:39] and Lord you even give us increase
[35:43] for you've made a stewards over little
[35:48] things
[35:50] so that we might decrease and share it
[35:54] with others and
[35:55] and love each other
[36:00] that's what you gave us our increases
[36:02] for
[36:03] and yet
[36:07] learn
[36:09] there's still Souls out there that need
[36:12] to be saved
[36:15] we just counting the honor to be
[36:19] engraved on your hands
[36:23] and Lord we
[36:25] we have these requests and I don't
[36:28] remember any of them but I'm glad they
[36:31] were spoken out
[36:34] for they were
[36:37] a request still
[36:39] and we know you undertake for every
[36:43] every Everything
[36:46] the rain falls
[36:49] and Lord we're all excited
[36:51] [Music]
[36:52] so water us tonight
[36:55] with your word
[36:56] water our spirits
[37:00] Lord let us
[37:02] go out of here and and be salty to the
[37:06] world that doesn't know you
[37:09] bless brother Lyle as he prepares us
[37:14] Peter and Martha at the piano Lord
[37:19] I'll come in together to just see a
[37:22] glimpse of you
[37:25] Lord Granite that's all I pray help us
[37:29] in every way
[37:31] and your precious name the Lord Jesus
[37:34] Christ amen
[37:40] and as our brother Lyle comes that sing
[37:42] Lord I believe and that's mean it
[37:46] oh Lord I believe
[37:52] that the Lord I believe
[37:57] that all things
[38:03] [Music]
[38:08] foreign
[38:10] [Music]
[38:28] is that your confession tonight
[38:36] I'm always between the keys between
[38:42] hello
[38:43] between the gaps so better that I don't
[38:46] try and sing but
[38:48] I just
[38:50] you know the last
[38:51] last week or so the last couple of weeks
[38:54] I've just been
[38:55] not exactly struggling but just not sure
[38:58] Lord what do you want said what what do
[39:01] you want me to to to say what do you
[39:05] want me to draw from your word for your
[39:07] people what do you have for us and I
[39:10] think oh it's this and I'd be working on
[39:12] that and
[39:14] and then I run into the wall well and
[39:18] then
[39:18] I feel like there's another kind of
[39:20] inspiration and I run into a different
[39:23] world and I was just kind of thrashing
[39:26] around a little bit Sunday night I
[39:28] thought Lord thank you I know where I'm
[39:30] going with this now thank you Lord
[39:32] Monday morning it was a different
[39:34] direction
[39:35] so I think probably you know it wasn't
[39:39] that long ago that that if brother Aaron
[39:41] didn't give me at least seven days
[39:42] notice I was just shaking trying to get
[39:45] ready and prepared but now
[39:48] God's grace I'm past that by his grace
[39:53] so I've got a lot less time to prepare
[39:56] but it maybe makes me more dependent on
[39:59] him and that's where we all need to be I
[40:03] think is with the mind of Christ and
[40:04] dependent on him
[40:07] so let's look to the Lord once more
[40:08] before we open his word and see what he
[40:11] has for us Lord Jesus
[40:14] we're here Lord not because we are
[40:16] anyone Lord we're nobody and you are not
[40:21] just somebody but you are everything
[40:24] Lord we pray that you would just help us
[40:26] to be yielded to you Lord that you'd
[40:28] help thee Lord this evening to just not
[40:31] be here Lord not not Lord to just get
[40:35] past Lyle Johnson's thoughts on Lyle
[40:38] Johnson's opinions Lord to just be you
[40:41] speaking to us speaking through US Lord
[40:43] anointing us Lord for your people for
[40:47] each one that's here Lord forgive us
[40:48] Lord of sin sin in my life Lord where I
[40:52] fall short so many times Lord but Lord
[40:55] just help us to draw together as a body
[40:57] of Christ to draw from you Lord because
[41:00] you have something for us and we want to
[41:03] receive it and we thank you in Jesus
[41:05] precious name amen
[41:12] last Sunday brother Aaron spoke on the
[41:15] reality
[41:16] of our being God's workmanship
[41:19] reopened with Ephesians 2 10.
[41:23] if you have a Scofield bible and you
[41:25] look in the notes at the beginning of it
[41:27] he'll he'll indicate something along the
[41:29] lines of Ephesians parallels Joshua
[41:32] brother Branham picked up on this and
[41:34] talked a lot about it in the adoption
[41:36] Series in 1960.
[41:38] just as Joshua describes the efforts of
[41:41] the people delivered from bondage to
[41:43] conquer Canaan and reap its benefits as
[41:46] the promised land Ephesians tells of our
[41:48] struggle to conquer our flesh and
[41:51] possess the promise of the holy spirit
[41:53] in our lives
[41:54] and we know it's by Grace not law
[41:57] yet we must strive we must work to bring
[42:01] it about in our lives
[42:03] tonight
[42:05] I'd like to take a brief look at some
[42:07] portions of the books of Ephesians so
[42:10] we'll open with Ephesians 1 and read
[42:12] just a little bit before we're seated
[42:18] Ephesians 1 1.
[42:21] Paul
[42:22] an apostle
[42:24] one who sent
[42:27] and is a representative of Jesus Christ
[42:31] by the will of God
[42:33] not by his own choice he's the messenger
[42:36] of the Gospel the good news to the
[42:38] Gentiles at the very beginning of the
[42:41] foundations of Christian faith
[42:44] to the Saints
[42:46] Sanctified ones those set aside by God
[42:50] which are at Ephesus
[42:53] hmm
[42:54] anybody here at Ephesus that not me I'm
[42:57] in Tucson and to the faithful in Christ
[43:00] Jesus
[43:01] is that you
[43:03] is that me yes so it's to us
[43:07] Paul's writing this to us
[43:10] God is sending us a text
[43:13] and it's only taken
[43:15] 1950 years for it to make its way
[43:18] through the web and get here
[43:21] Tucson Arizona
[43:24] Grace he says God's favor not earned
[43:29] unmerited a gift be to you
[43:33] and peace
[43:35] from God our Father
[43:37] and from the Lord Jesus Christ the kind
[43:40] of inner peace the shalom
[43:42] that only God can provide
[43:45] please be seated
[43:49] let me start by giving you a little
[43:52] context for Ephesians and and for
[43:54] Ephesus I apologize that this map was a
[43:57] little busy for those of you sitting in
[44:00] the back maybe you brought your opera
[44:01] glasses or your binoculars or I I don't
[44:04] know I think we're all sufficiently
[44:06] socially distancing that if anybody had
[44:08] Ebola nobody would catch it
[44:10] but there's a red arrow here big one
[44:13] that points to Ephesus which is right
[44:15] here this whole block here has all these
[44:18] names galatia cappadocious Alicia Asia
[44:21] Etc
[44:22] that's modern day Turkey
[44:24] to give you some context this black see
[44:26] if you go right up here that's Ukraine
[44:29] where there's a lot of bad things
[44:30] happening right now over here is Italy
[44:32] Rome Adriatic see if you go up just
[44:34] about here that's where Amos and Abigail
[44:38] Garcia were celebrating their
[44:40] anniversary just a little while ago to
[44:42] give you some context of where this is
[44:46] of course Israel is here
[44:48] and these all these colored lines are
[44:50] showing where Paul went but you can see
[44:52] that he went to Ephesus
[44:55] by the way the Isle of Patmos is not
[44:57] really visible here but it's right here
[44:59] just off the coast of Ephesus it's kind
[45:01] of the Ephesus is the next big town if
[45:03] you can swim far enough from Patmos so I
[45:06] don't know exactly how far it is 20 30
[45:08] miles 40 maybe Paul visited Ephesus on
[45:12] his second and third missionary Journeys
[45:13] Acts 20 31 tells us that he was like the
[45:17] pastor or the bishop or whatever an
[45:18] Ephesus for about three years so these
[45:21] weren't quick in and out missionary
[45:22] Journeys Paul would go someplace and
[45:24] oftentimes he'd hang around iranius
[45:27] indicates third-hand knowledge that
[45:29] iranius heard that somebody heard that
[45:31] somebody told him that the Apostle John
[45:34] after his exiled Atmos was the bishop at
[45:37] Ephesus for the last several years of
[45:39] his life
[45:41] the book of Acts chapter 18 tells us
[45:43] that on his second missionary journey
[45:45] Paul start briefly in Ephesus on his way
[45:48] back to Antioch
[45:49] he brought Akila in Priscilla with them
[45:51] from from Greece there and left them in
[45:54] Ephesus as he went uh he went home
[45:56] Apollos then came had a powerful
[45:58] Ministry but he was lacking a little bit
[46:01] there in a girl and Priscilla just
[46:03] happened to be there and we're told that
[46:05] they expounded unto him the way of God
[46:07] more perfectly
[46:09] well Apollos departed in a little bit
[46:12] later Paul arrived on his third
[46:13] missionary journey
[46:16] Acts 19 tells us he was there for more
[46:19] than two years and as we just read he
[46:21] was or I cited the reference he was
[46:24] there for three he stayed on and
[46:26] sometime after that two years that are
[46:27] mentioned in Exodus 19 just that it was
[46:31] for a season there was a major problem
[46:33] that arose at Ephesus
[46:36] we read in Acts 19 23 at the same time
[46:41] there arose no small stir
[46:45] it was a major fear it was serious
[46:49] trouble
[46:50] about that way that is the way of the
[46:53] Lord that that Paul was preaching and
[46:55] sharing and testifying and being an
[46:58] apostle of for a certain man named
[47:01] Demetrius
[47:02] a silversmith which made silver shrines
[47:04] for Diana
[47:06] Diana is the Roman name for the Greek
[47:09] goddess Artemis which is variously the
[47:11] goddess of the hunt the goddess of of
[47:13] human childbirth and so forth
[47:16] made silver shrines for Diana and
[47:18] brought no small gain that is to say he
[47:20] brought a lot of business under the
[47:22] Craftsman of Ephesus so this guy
[47:25] apparently was a little bit of a of a
[47:27] leader he was very successful business
[47:29] person there
[47:31] so Demetrius called a meeting of the
[47:33] Craftsman together with the workmen of
[47:36] like occupation related trades
[47:39] and said he got this meeting
[47:41] and he said sirs you know that by this
[47:45] craft we have our wealth our prosperity
[47:48] it depends on it
[47:51] moreover you see and hear that not alone
[47:54] not only at Ephesus but almost
[47:57] throughout all Asia this Paul hath
[48:01] persuaded and turned away much people
[48:04] saying that they be no Gods which are
[48:07] made with hands
[48:08] so that not only is this our craft and
[48:12] danger to be said it not but also that
[48:16] the Temple of the Great grottis Goddess
[48:19] Diana should be despised and her
[48:22] magnificence should be destroyed whom
[48:25] all Asia and the world worships
[48:29] this inset that I put in here this map
[48:31] is
[48:32] cut out from that previous one you can
[48:34] see Ephesus there so when they refer to
[48:36] Asia they're not talking about China and
[48:38] Japan and Singapore and all of that
[48:40] they're talking about Western turkey
[48:44] it's the the Roman province
[48:47] and when they those people that were
[48:49] gathered and listening to Demetrius
[48:51] heard these sayings they were full of
[48:53] Wrath
[48:54] anger
[48:56] rage
[48:57] and cried out saying great is Diana of
[49:00] the Ephesians
[49:03] Ephesus was also the seat of worship of
[49:06] the goddess Artemis two names for the
[49:08] same thing Jesus Yeshua two names same
[49:12] person
[49:13] so if we read a few verses more we'd see
[49:17] that there was a riot that ensued but a
[49:20] question may come to your mind
[49:22] are these assertions of Demetrius regard
[49:25] regarding Artemis are they just bombast
[49:28] is he just making a big deal out of
[49:30] nothing is this a tempest in a teapot or
[49:33] is this hyperbole is this exaggeration
[49:36] or were they largely factual
[49:40] have you ever heard of the Seven Wonders
[49:42] of the Ancient World I'm not asking you
[49:45] to name them
[49:47] but the great pyramid at Giza Egypt is
[49:50] the only one that remains
[49:52] did you know
[49:54] that one of those seven wonders of the
[49:58] ancient world was the very Temple of
[50:02] Artemis in Ephesus
[50:04] that Demetrius was speaking of when he
[50:06] talks about the magnificence of Diana
[50:09] another Temple he is not exaggerating
[50:15] you can you
[50:17] can see that this this is a model
[50:20] of that Temple that that's in Istanbul
[50:22] Turkey the original one was built in the
[50:24] 6th Century BC it was twice the size of
[50:28] the Parthenon its final version that was
[50:30] constructed in the 4th Century BC was
[50:33] 450 feet long that's one and a half
[50:36] football fields
[50:38] 225 feet wide and 60 feet tall with more
[50:42] than 127 columns
[50:45] and it stood
[50:46] for several hundred years
[50:52] the inset
[50:54] this is all that remains of it today
[50:58] a single composite pillar of fragments
[51:02] of various columns that they found when
[51:04] they started digging
[51:06] Demetrius was right to be worried
[51:09] well there was a riot it was quelled and
[51:12] Paul then left from Macedonia
[51:14] well let's Jump Ahead
[51:16] chapter one of Ephesians let's jump up
[51:19] to verse 15.
[51:22] Paul's greeted people he's talked about
[51:25] some things that we'll get to in a
[51:26] moment and he says wherefore I also
[51:29] after I heard of your faith in the Lord
[51:31] Jesus and love unto all the saints cease
[51:35] not to give thanks for you making
[51:37] mention of you in my prayers
[51:41] is that a little strange
[51:45] they're saying I can hear you you're
[51:47] saying wait a minute brother Lyle why
[51:49] does Paul say he's heard of their faith
[51:51] when he's the one that was involved in
[51:53] their conversion and led the work there
[51:55] for three years
[51:56] what what's going on
[51:59] good question glad you're paying
[52:00] attention
[52:02] some years after the events of Acts 18
[52:05] and 19
[52:07] as we know Paul was imprisoned he was
[52:09] sent to Rome it was while he was in Rome
[52:12] that he wrote this epistle this letter
[52:15] to the Ephesians
[52:17] so this was 7 to 15 years after the last
[52:21] time he had physically been there
[52:23] so what's going on here is that Paul's
[52:26] rejoicing that he is hurt they've kept
[52:29] the faith
[52:30] they've grown in Grace and they're known
[52:33] for their love
[52:37] will turn with me now to revelation
[52:39] chapter 2.
[52:42] there's a letter
[52:43] to the church at Ephesus was written
[52:45] another 30 years or so later
[52:49] we're very familiar with this under the
[52:51] angel of the Church of Ephesus right
[52:54] these things saith he that holdeth the
[52:57] Seven Stars in his right hand who
[52:59] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[53:01] candlesticks in other words Jesus
[53:06] I Know Thy works
[53:08] and thy labor
[53:09] and thy patience
[53:11] and now you can't bear them with your
[53:14] evil you've tried them that say they are
[53:17] Apostles that say that I sent them
[53:20] but they're not
[53:22] you found them to be liars and you've
[53:25] borne you've carried so much you've had
[53:27] patience and from my very name sake
[53:31] you've labored and you've not fainted
[53:35] they're doing the right things
[53:38] they're doing them in the name of Jesus
[53:40] Christ they're doing the right things
[53:42] nevertheless
[53:45] oops
[53:46] I have somewhat against thee
[53:49] because thou has left thy first love
[53:54] the very thing that Paul is commending
[53:56] their love is the one thing they will
[53:59] eventually leave other translations of
[54:02] this verse say you have lost the love
[54:04] you had at first
[54:06] or you don't love me or each other as
[54:09] you did at first or you have abandoned
[54:13] the love you had at first you deserted
[54:15] me your first love
[54:18] well if we read on in verse 5 of
[54:20] Revelation 2
[54:22] Jesus goes on to call them to repentance
[54:25] to return to do the works and deeds that
[54:27] they used to do you see it's not just
[54:29] what we do
[54:31] it's why we do it that counts with god
[54:36] brother Branham talks about checking
[54:38] your motive and your objective what's in
[54:40] your heart as you go forth The church
[54:43] here is doing the right things they're
[54:45] doing it for his name's sake but they're
[54:48] no longer motivated
[54:50] by that love
[54:52] my prayer Lord help me to be motivated
[54:56] by love for Christ to do the things you
[54:59] want me to do
[55:00] not out of a sense of Duty but out of
[55:03] love and gratitude in response to your
[55:06] love that saved me and paid the awful
[55:10] price of redemption for me
[55:12] for each of us here tonight
[55:16] with this is a background and context
[55:19] let's go back to Ephesians 1 we'll pick
[55:22] up at verse 3.
[55:24] remember
[55:26] Paul is writing not just to the
[55:28] Ephesians but specifically and directly
[55:30] to us as being among the faithful and
[55:32] Christ Jesus in fact it may surprise you
[55:35] to know that some of the very earliest
[55:38] Greek manuscripts of Paul's letter
[55:41] completely leave out the mention of
[55:44] Ephesus in verse one and they read to
[55:46] the Saints which are the faithful in
[55:48] Christ Jesus
[55:51] as we are included in that number and I
[55:54] believe we are
[55:55] the called out
[55:57] set aside and faithful in Christ tonight
[56:00] I want us each to carefully and
[56:03] intentionally
[56:05] insert ourselves into these verses
[56:09] keep in mind the parallel between the
[56:11] promised land and the possession of the
[56:14] believer
[56:15] through the spirit
[56:19] Ephesians 1 3 Paul has just greeted them
[56:23] blessed
[56:24] praise
[56:26] Lord
[56:27] adoration
[56:29] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[56:32] Christ the Messiah who
[56:35] who
[56:36] God hath
[56:38] what
[56:40] blessed us
[56:41] blessed who
[56:43] who's the letter written to
[56:45] you
[56:47] to me personally individually put your
[56:51] name here as we read it together
[56:55] God has blessed me Lyle Johnson with
[56:59] a few
[57:01] some
[57:02] no with all spiritual blessings and
[57:07] Heavenly places
[57:09] in Christ in other words when I am
[57:12] joined in Christ with Christ all the
[57:15] blessings that exist in the Heavenly
[57:17] Realm
[57:18] am I
[57:20] do you really grasp that
[57:23] I'm not sure I do
[57:26] according as he
[57:29] He Who
[57:30] God
[57:32] hath randomly accepted
[57:35] kept score and noted who had the most
[57:37] Merit
[57:39] no he and his Sovereign will has chosen
[57:44] who
[57:46] us
[57:48] where
[57:49] in him
[57:51] when before the foundation of the world
[57:56] why
[57:57] that we should be
[58:00] what
[58:01] holy
[58:02] and not just holy which is already more
[58:05] than enough and more than we could ever
[58:07] expect
[58:08] but also entirely Without Blame
[58:13] for him in exasperation
[58:17] and resignation
[58:19] no before him in love
[58:23] do you see yourself here
[58:26] blessed
[58:28] be chosen
[58:30] holy
[58:32] Without Blame
[58:34] loved
[58:36] put yourself there this letter is to you
[58:41] having
[58:43] guessed
[58:44] that we might be worthy
[58:47] to by his foreknowledge he is
[58:49] predestinated us
[58:51] that means it's going to happen it's
[58:54] guaranteed he's already seen it he
[58:56] transcends time there's no question
[58:59] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[59:02] Christ to himself
[59:06] full family member not not just a little
[59:10] kid
[59:11] but a mature adult
[59:13] having been proven trustworthy
[59:16] according to the good pleasure of his
[59:21] will
[59:22] remember it's all about him
[59:26] he includes us but it's not about us
[59:29] it's about him
[59:32] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[59:37] we praise him to measure it with the
[59:39] glory of the grace he's freely bestowed
[59:41] upon us
[59:42] wherein he hath made us
[59:44] accepted
[59:46] in the Beloved
[59:49] in whom the Beloved
[59:52] we have Redemption
[59:55] to be redeemed is to be fought back
[59:59] no longer held as collateral for a debt
[1:00:03] our sin put us in Satan's pawn shop
[1:00:06] Jesus Paid the price of Redemption on
[1:00:09] Calvary
[1:00:10] for each one of us
[1:00:13] through his blood
[1:00:17] and you even begin to imagine how awful
[1:00:19] that was
[1:00:22] I shudder at times when I think of it we
[1:00:24] not only have Redemption which would
[1:00:26] have been
[1:00:27] more than enough but he extended to us
[1:00:30] through that act of self-sacrifice the
[1:00:34] forgiveness
[1:00:35] sins
[1:00:38] sins
[1:00:39] plural not only our attitude and nature
[1:00:42] of unbelief of sin
[1:00:45] but the resulting actions
[1:00:47] according to the riches of his grace
[1:00:53] abundant riches
[1:00:55] matchless Grace
[1:00:58] wherein he hath abounded
[1:01:02] abundant there's a lot abounded toward
[1:01:05] us in all wisdom and prudence
[1:01:09] the NIV translation renders this in him
[1:01:12] we have Redemption through his blood the
[1:01:15] Forgiveness of sins in accordance with
[1:01:18] the riches of God's grace that he
[1:01:20] lavished on us
[1:01:22] with all wisdom and understanding he
[1:01:25] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:01:29] his will
[1:01:31] he revealed this mystery
[1:01:34] to us according to his good pleasure his
[1:01:39] merciful intention
[1:01:41] which he hath purposed
[1:01:43] and himself
[1:01:46] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:01:49] of times
[1:01:51] and Ivy says when the time is right
[1:01:55] the complete Jewish Bible says when the
[1:01:57] time is ripe the Amplified says for the
[1:02:00] maturity of the times and the climax of
[1:02:02] the ages
[1:02:04] he might gather together in one all
[1:02:07] things in Christ
[1:02:09] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:02:12] on Earth
[1:02:13] even in him
[1:02:15] placing everything
[1:02:17] under the headship of Christ
[1:02:19] in whom
[1:02:22] that is in Christ
[1:02:24] also we have obtained an inheritance
[1:02:30] being predestinated again this outcome
[1:02:34] is foreseen and assured
[1:02:37] according to the purpose of him who
[1:02:41] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:02:44] his own will
[1:02:46] it's all about him
[1:02:48] Revelation we're told we're created for
[1:02:51] his pleasure not ours
[1:02:54] that we should be to the praise
[1:02:58] of his glory
[1:03:00] who first trusted in Christ
[1:03:03] the the complete Jewish Bible renders
[1:03:05] this so that we who earlier had put our
[1:03:07] hope in the Messiah would bring him
[1:03:09] praise to measurement with his glory
[1:03:13] how should our praise be
[1:03:16] in whom that is in Christ ye
[1:03:21] you to whom this letter is addressed
[1:03:23] also
[1:03:25] what
[1:03:26] trusted had faith when
[1:03:30] after that she heard
[1:03:33] what
[1:03:34] the word of Truth
[1:03:36] the Ephesians heard it first through
[1:03:38] Apollos and Priscilla and akula and Paul
[1:03:43] how did you hear it
[1:03:45] how did I hear it
[1:03:48] and what did we hear that word of Truth
[1:03:50] The Gospel what is the gospel the good
[1:03:54] news
[1:03:56] of your salvation
[1:03:59] what news could be better than that
[1:04:02] in whom also after that you believed
[1:04:07] you were
[1:04:08] what
[1:04:10] sealed
[1:04:11] marked by him that is by Christ with
[1:04:14] with what
[1:04:16] the Holy Spirit of Promise the infilling
[1:04:21] of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:23] which is the earnest the down payment
[1:04:26] the guarantee
[1:04:28] of our inheritance
[1:04:30] until the Redemption
[1:04:32] of the purchased possession that means
[1:04:35] you and that means me
[1:04:37] we're not our home
[1:04:39] we have been purchased
[1:04:41] by Christ
[1:04:43] we are in fact
[1:04:45] his possession
[1:04:47] unto the praise
[1:04:49] of his glory
[1:04:51] did you get all that

[1:05:10] I want you to enter into this I want you
[1:05:12] to grasp these promises what Paul has

[1:06:46] now we can act any old way do whatever
[1:06:49] we please just cruise on through life
[1:06:55] no not exactly
[1:06:58] I want to encourage each of you
[1:07:01] carefully
[1:07:02] prayerfully thoughtfully read the book
[1:07:05] of Ephesians it's just a few pages in
[1:07:08] your Bible
[1:07:09] for now
[1:07:10] we'll just hit a few more highlights
[1:07:13] Paul goes on and the rest of that first
[1:07:15] chapter to emphasize the greatness of
[1:07:18] God
[1:07:18] and his gift of life to us and intention
[1:07:22] to put all things under Christ
[1:07:28] he starts the second chapter
[1:07:33] and you
[1:07:35] who
[1:07:37] me
[1:07:38] you each one of us hathy quickened what
[1:07:42] does that mean
[1:07:43] brought to life
[1:07:46] who were dead and trespasses and sins
[1:07:50] skipping down to verse four but God
[1:07:54] who is rich in judgment
[1:07:58] anger
[1:07:59] Wrath
[1:08:01] no rich abounding in Mercy
[1:08:05] for his great love
[1:08:07] wherewith he loved us
[1:08:11] even
[1:08:12] when we were dead in sins
[1:08:15] we were his enemies
[1:08:17] rejecting him disobedient
[1:08:21] hath quickened us brought us to life
[1:08:24] together with Christ
[1:08:27] and Paul emphasizes by grace
[1:08:30] you're saved
[1:08:32] and it raised us up together
[1:08:36] not just together with one another which
[1:08:39] is wonderful but together in Christ
[1:08:43] and has made us sit together in Heavenly
[1:08:46] places
[1:08:47] in Christ Jesus
[1:08:50] we're quickened we're brought to life
[1:08:53] raised up sitting in the heavenlies in
[1:08:57] and only in Christ
[1:09:00] and that through his grace alone
[1:09:03] that for a few moments
[1:09:06] no that in the ages to come
[1:09:09] he might show the exceeding riches
[1:09:14] extreme wealth
[1:09:17] of his
[1:09:19] what
[1:09:20] Grace
[1:09:22] in his kindness
[1:09:24] his kindness
[1:09:26] one of his attributes that work you
[1:09:28] possess and display
[1:09:31] this will all men know you're my
[1:09:32] disciples that you have loved one for
[1:09:34] another is what Jesus said his kindness
[1:09:37] toward us through
[1:09:40] Christ Jesus
[1:09:43] for by Good Works
[1:09:47] were created to do such but it is by
[1:09:50] grace are ye
[1:09:53] who
[1:09:55] me you each of us are saved through
[1:09:59] faith
[1:10:01] and that faith is not of yourselves
[1:10:05] it didn't come from you it was given to
[1:10:07] you it says it's a gift of God
[1:10:11] so the very faith that you have comes
[1:10:14] from God to accept the grace that he
[1:10:15] extends from God because we're not
[1:10:18] worthy of any of it but he gives us all
[1:10:20] of it
[1:10:21] it's not of works
[1:10:23] not what you did
[1:10:25] blessed in order to prevent that any man
[1:10:28] should boast
[1:10:29] and the verse that brother Aaron shared
[1:10:32] with us on Sundays he started for we are
[1:10:34] his God's workmanship
[1:10:37] created in Christ Jesus unto to do to
[1:10:42] perform good works
[1:10:45] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:10:48] should walk in them
[1:10:49] live a life full of good works
[1:10:53] motivated by love
[1:10:55] as we read in Revelation 2.
[1:10:58] again
[1:10:59] we see that our Salvation is all
[1:11:02] accomplished by him
[1:11:05] through his love and grace
[1:11:08] toward us
[1:11:10] now Paul goes on to describe the
[1:11:13] revealed Ministry mystery not Ministry
[1:11:17] sorry in Ephesians 3 Ephesians 3 3
[1:11:22] we read how that by Revelation Paul is
[1:11:25] sharing this now by Revelation Christ is
[1:11:28] made known unto me Paul
[1:11:31] the mystery
[1:11:34] now watch what Paul says about this
[1:11:37] Revelation at verse 5 he says which in
[1:11:39] other Ages was not made known Unto the
[1:11:42] Sons of men
[1:11:43] it was hidden as it is now revealed unto
[1:11:47] His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the
[1:11:51] spirit
[1:11:52] so Paul was saying that he's a holy
[1:11:55] Apostle and that he's a prophet because
[1:11:58] he's talking about the Revelation and he
[1:12:00] just said this is the ones to whom God
[1:12:02] reveals such Paul's not being very shy
[1:12:04] here
[1:12:06] verse 6.
[1:12:08] that the Gentiles
[1:12:10] the non-jewish people
[1:12:13] should be fellow heirs
[1:12:15] Sharing The Inheritance with the
[1:12:18] descendants of Jacob and of the same
[1:12:20] body
[1:12:21] and partakers of his promise in Christ
[1:12:25] by the gospel the good news
[1:12:28] Paul's rejoicing in the Revelation that
[1:12:30] the grace and mercy of God is not
[1:12:32] limited to the descendants of Israel
[1:12:35] but it's available to all who will
[1:12:38] believe and accept it
[1:12:40] that's truly good news
[1:12:45] but it's not all sunshine and roses
[1:12:49] there's danger
[1:12:51] Ephesians 4.
[1:12:55] I therefore
[1:12:56] Paul
[1:12:57] the prisoner of the Lord
[1:12:59] beseech you
[1:13:01] beseech
[1:13:03] this is a plaintiff cry from the depths
[1:13:06] of his heart to us
[1:13:08] that you walk that you live a life
[1:13:11] worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are
[1:13:15] called
[1:13:16] a behavior that is a credit to the
[1:13:18] summons to God's service
[1:13:21] with all lowliness lowliness of Mind
[1:13:25] humility
[1:13:26] and meekness
[1:13:28] unselfish gentleness mildness
[1:13:32] meekness is not weakness meekness comes
[1:13:35] from a position of strength with long
[1:13:37] suffering
[1:13:39] patience
[1:13:40] forbearing
[1:13:42] bearing with
[1:13:44] putting up with making allowances for
[1:13:47] one another
[1:13:48] and love
[1:13:50] endeavoring
[1:13:52] it's hard work
[1:13:54] we must make every effort striving
[1:13:57] earnestly with diligence
[1:13:59] to keep the unity
[1:14:01] Harmony and Oneness of the spirit
[1:14:05] in the bond
[1:14:07] ing ourselves together with peace
[1:14:20] Paul goes on
[1:14:23] there's one body
[1:14:25] not two not five not ten not ten million
[1:14:28] there's one body one spirit
[1:14:32] even as you are called in one hope of
[1:14:36] your calling
[1:14:37] one Lord
[1:14:40] one faith one
[1:14:43] baptism
[1:14:45] one God and Father of all who is above
[1:14:49] who was Sovereign Over All
[1:14:52] and and and and works through all and
[1:14:54] and pervading and living in you all
[1:14:59] Christ in you
[1:15:01] the Holy Spirit the father
[1:15:04] the
[1:15:05] the Oneness of God
[1:15:08] but unto every one of us
[1:15:11] each of us
[1:15:13] is given Grace according to the measure
[1:15:16] of the gift of Christ
[1:15:20] a different measure not indiscriminately
[1:15:22] but as each requires in proportion to
[1:15:25] the generosity
[1:15:26] of Christ's rich
[1:15:29] and Bounty is gift
[1:15:31] Paul goes on and explains and expands on
[1:15:34] this topic throughout chapter four
[1:15:37] and he concludes it
[1:15:40] with a very Stern warning
[1:15:42] Ephesians 4 30.
[1:15:46] he says and grieve not
[1:15:49] don't bring sorrow
[1:15:51] to the holy spirit of God
[1:15:54] whereby ye are sealed
[1:15:56] guaranteed that you will be saved on the
[1:15:58] day of redemption
[1:16:01] grief not how do we ensure this
[1:16:05] how do we ensure that we don't grieve
[1:16:07] the Holy Spirit
[1:16:09] well
[1:16:10] he gives us two short lists the first is
[1:16:14] a list of the don'ts
[1:16:17] but just like we heard uh brother Daniel
[1:16:20] talking about talents and and it's not
[1:16:22] what you don't do that's what you do do
[1:16:24] so we've got some don'ts and then we've
[1:16:27] got some dues
[1:16:30] so verse 31 he says let get rid of all
[1:16:35] bitterness
[1:16:38] Wrath
[1:16:40] anger
[1:16:42] clamor that's violent assertedness
[1:16:46] evil speaking
[1:16:50] let all this be put away from you
[1:16:52] along with all malice spitefulness
[1:16:56] so don't let these be
[1:16:59] in your life don't let these be in your
[1:17:02] church don't let these be in your family
[1:17:04] don't let this be amongst us
[1:17:07] and now comes an imperative
[1:17:10] a definite instruction of what to do
[1:17:14] a command if you will
[1:17:16] be ye kind
[1:17:19] one to another
[1:17:21] tenderhearted
[1:17:23] compassionate
[1:17:25] forgiving one another
[1:17:28] why
[1:17:29] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[1:17:33] forgiven you
[1:17:38] are we one body
[1:17:40] this is a general body there is a
[1:17:42] general Body of Christ comprised of all
[1:17:44] believers there's also a local body
[1:17:47] those that Worship in various assemblies
[1:17:49] including this one here
[1:17:51] Tucson Tabernacle
[1:17:54] let me tell you a story
[1:17:58] two stories
[1:18:00] the first concerns a man that I knew
[1:18:03] only by reputation
[1:18:05] most of you know
[1:18:07] that I'm a nerd everybody knows that
[1:18:10] no secret when I was a 13 year old kid I
[1:18:14] became a licensed to amateur radio
[1:18:15] operator
[1:18:17] the last full-time job I had was for a
[1:18:19] company in California designing and
[1:18:21] creating high performance equipment for
[1:18:23] amateur radio communications it's been a
[1:18:26] kind of a lifelong
[1:18:27] thing well we had a customer in England
[1:18:31] who wrote and supported some software
[1:18:33] that complemented our equipment
[1:18:36] his name was Julian Moss his amateur
[1:18:39] radio call sign with G4 ILO if any of
[1:18:42] you were amateurs in every word G4 I
[1:18:44] although that was Julian Moss I never
[1:18:46] met him
[1:18:47] I'm not even sure I ever corresponded
[1:18:49] with him
[1:18:53] well several years ago
[1:18:55] he started a Blog called
[1:18:58] one foot in the grave
[1:19:00] turns out he was diagnosed with an
[1:19:03] inoperable incurable brain tumor
[1:19:07] and he wrote in the blog what he
[1:19:09] experienced is various treatments were
[1:19:11] done
[1:19:12] as his body failed him the good days
[1:19:16] the bad days
[1:19:18] the regrets
[1:19:20] the final entry was made by his wife
[1:19:22] just after Julian passed away it was
[1:19:25] exactly eight years ago brother Jordan
[1:19:27] shared with us about the 23rd of October
[1:19:29] on Sunday well here this fellow passed
[1:19:32] away on the 24th of October
[1:19:35] today's the 26th it was eight years ago
[1:19:37] that this happened
[1:19:39] well sometimes when when I feel hurt
[1:19:43] rejection anger
[1:19:45] I think about that blog
[1:19:48] one foot in the grave not its contents
[1:19:52] but it's title
[1:19:54] one foot in the grave
[1:19:58] that brings me to my second story
[1:20:01] maybe it's a testimony maybe it's a
[1:20:04] confession that's personal
[1:20:07] many of you already know some of it or
[1:20:09] all of it but I'm going to share it with
[1:20:11] you
[1:20:13] many of you recall
[1:20:15] that early in November
[1:20:18] 2016.
[1:20:19] I left this assembly
[1:20:22] some of you weren't attending the
[1:20:24] Tabernacle back then it may be news you
[1:20:25] after service one Sunday morning I
[1:20:27] walked out right through that door there
[1:20:29] sister the one close to you Heather and
[1:20:31] I were sitting roughly where you're
[1:20:32] sitting
[1:20:33] I didn't storm out I wasn't loud but I
[1:20:36] was direct
[1:20:38] I didn't look to the right didn't look
[1:20:40] to the left head down
[1:20:42] directly to the parking lot to our car
[1:20:45] drove away
[1:20:47] Heather came with me not because she
[1:20:49] wanted to in such a way but she's my
[1:20:51] wife
[1:20:53] I was upset
[1:20:55] I was angry
[1:20:57] I was hurt
[1:20:58] and I was hurting
[1:21:00] please as I relate this do not feel any
[1:21:03] pangs of sympathy for me I deserve none
[1:21:06] and you'll see why
[1:21:09] for about three months we went to
[1:21:11] different churches
[1:21:13] I was convinced I was right I was
[1:21:16] convinced others had wronged me I felt
[1:21:18] rejected I was in pain and my attitude
[1:21:21] fed that pain
[1:21:24] I did not want to come back
[1:21:27] but sometime in February 2017
[1:21:30] we quietly returned snuck in the back
[1:21:34] door
[1:21:35] and started attending service here again
[1:21:38] brother Aaron graciously allowed me to
[1:21:41] speak here again that was March 26 2017.
[1:21:45] it was the fifth time I had addressed
[1:21:48] the congregation
[1:21:49] five a number of Grace
[1:21:52] if the spirit of the Lord was so
[1:21:54] precious that Sunday evening as a song
[1:21:56] service ended and I came
[1:21:58] to this desk
[1:22:01] before I shared the message that was on
[1:22:03] my heart I apologized
[1:22:06] Church
[1:22:08] I did not attempt to justify myself for
[1:22:11] what I did I confessed I was wrong
[1:22:15] I realized that my actions
[1:22:19] my reactions
[1:22:21] had caused hurt and pain to the local
[1:22:24] Body of Christ
[1:22:26] I selfishly hurt each and every one of
[1:22:29] you
[1:22:30] and I was grieving the Holy Spirit
[1:22:36] you see we are
[1:22:38] a body
[1:22:39] and when I withdrew myself from this
[1:22:42] assembly I was taking away a part of
[1:22:44] God's spirit with me
[1:22:45] it may be I only contributed one
[1:22:48] molecule amongst a billion
[1:22:51] but even that is still injuring the body
[1:22:54] we're like this picture of a jigsaw
[1:22:56] puzzle with 30 000 pieces
[1:23:00] thirty thousand pieces
[1:23:02] as brother Daniel tells us every piece
[1:23:05] has to be present
[1:23:07] Victor is not complete
[1:23:10] Jesus said it's better to enter the
[1:23:12] kingdom without an eye or a hand or a
[1:23:14] foot than to not enter it
[1:23:16] but obviously it's even better
[1:23:19] to enter hole
[1:23:22] the real problem
[1:23:25] brother Lyle was dealing with
[1:23:27] was that he had one foot in the grave
[1:23:31] and thus
[1:23:33] I had one foot out
[1:23:36] the problem was not what was said or
[1:23:39] done by others it was my reactions
[1:23:43] that helped me
[1:23:45] realize that I was not dead to self
[1:23:50] through this experience God was being
[1:23:55] kind to me allowing me
[1:23:58] see myself
[1:24:00] letting me realize
[1:24:03] I was the problem
[1:24:05] my reaction is revealed my weaknesses
[1:24:08] and my failures
[1:24:12] all of which meant that this old man
[1:24:14] my sinful nature
[1:24:16] was still all too alive and well
[1:24:20] if you want to turn in your Bible to
[1:24:22] Luke 9.
[1:24:24] right after Peter had proclaimed him to
[1:24:27] be the Christ Jesus turned in he said to
[1:24:29] them all to his disciples
[1:24:32] Luke 9 23. if any
[1:24:36] If any man will come after me
[1:24:40] let him deny himself
[1:24:43] take up his cross
[1:24:45] daily
[1:24:47] and follow me
[1:24:49] I Must Die daily
[1:24:53] not by taking a pill lethal injection
[1:24:57] I must Crucify My Flesh
[1:25:02] not easy
[1:25:04] but if I'm dead
[1:25:06] that I have no feelings to be hurt
[1:25:09] no grievances to nurture
[1:25:12] no anger to feed
[1:25:14] each of us individually is to have the
[1:25:17] Life of Christ
[1:25:19] only when we are dead can he Quicken us
[1:25:22] to his life
[1:25:24] and he knew that we would constantly be
[1:25:26] warring with our own flesh so we said we
[1:25:30] must take up our cross
[1:25:32] daily
[1:25:33] not once
[1:25:35] but every day
[1:25:36] our old nature must submit to his
[1:25:40] it's a constant battle it will be until
[1:25:42] we're fully changed into his likeness
[1:25:44] brother Matt Watkins shared that with us
[1:25:47] just a few weeks ago here
[1:25:51] as he was being nailed to the cross
[1:25:53] Jesus cried out father forgive them they
[1:25:57] don't know what they're doing
[1:26:01] God answered that cry of Jesus
[1:26:04] I know
[1:26:06] because I was the one who crucified him
[1:26:10] and he's forgiven me
[1:26:13] and I've accepted that forgiveness
[1:26:15] brother bran we're talking about a
[1:26:17] pardon in the Civil War that
[1:26:19] the pardon's not departed unless you
[1:26:21] accept it
[1:26:22] Christ has forgiven us
[1:26:25] but we have to accept it and it's that
[1:26:27] not acceptance that causes the
[1:26:29] condemnation what did Stephen say when
[1:26:33] he was being cruelly slain
[1:26:35] we read Stephen had addressed this group
[1:26:37] they got so angry some of them did a
[1:26:40] Mike Tyson on him that says they gnashed
[1:26:42] on him with their teeth they bit him
[1:26:44] these people were upset they cast even
[1:26:47] out of the city
[1:26:49] and stoned him that's not tossing
[1:26:51] Pebbles
[1:26:54] and the witnesses laid down their
[1:26:55] clothes at a young man's feet whose name
[1:26:57] was Saul
[1:26:59] and they stoned Stephen
[1:27:03] rocks big enough to break his bones to
[1:27:06] crush his skull
[1:27:09] Stone Stephen who was calling upon God
[1:27:12] and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit
[1:27:17] and Stephen kneeled down I suspect
[1:27:20] probably he collapsed
[1:27:22] and cried with a loud voice
[1:27:25] they could all hear Lord lay not this
[1:27:28] sin to their charge
[1:27:31] and when he had said this
[1:27:34] he fell asleep he passed away he died
[1:27:37] Stephen forgave those who were not
[1:27:40] repentant not sorry and not asking to be
[1:27:42] forgiven those who were determined to
[1:27:45] deliberately snuff out his life in a
[1:27:47] brutal and barbaric way
[1:27:51] let's reread
[1:27:53] those closing verses of Ephesians 4.
[1:27:57] this time from the Amplified Bible
[1:28:00] Ephesians 4 30.
[1:28:02] do not grieve the holy spirit of God do
[1:28:07] not offend or Vex or sadden him
[1:28:10] by whom you were sealed marked branded
[1:28:15] as God's Own secured
[1:28:18] for the day of redemption
[1:28:20] of final Deliverance through Christ from
[1:28:23] Evil and the consequences of sin
