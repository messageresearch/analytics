they were asking the little boy what he learned in church today and he said we learned the Andy song Mama looks at him said the Andy song he goes Andy Walks With Me Andy talks with me I always remember that you know with a childlike Faith just take God at his word amen we have h a prayer request that was turned in this morning but was after and so we didn't see it and they didn't sign it but testimony prayer request a few weeks ago I had some blood work done last Tuesday says last Tuesday I got the results my A1C was down from 7 to 6.9 my cholesterol was high and I'll try to get it more healthy thank you for your prayers for everything you know God is more than able God is more than able yeah and we appreciate that his goodness to us a little update on mom mom and dad cuz it's hard on Dad too but you know if you've been around my mom my mom we moved here in 76 my mom was still driving but she didn't know Tucson very well she was getting nervous about her eyesight she stopped driving and eventually she couldn't see well enough to drive so it's been about 46 47 years ago that she stopped driving and you know but she but if you watched her and every and a lot of people didn't know she was blind cuz she didn't act like it around the house she still cooked she wanted to know if the water was hot enough she stuck her finger in it that's how she knew it was hot enough she did her own laundry she's done everything she's been able to do that so she had gone into the room on Wednesday and there's she steep into the in her bedroom there's a chest of drawers here a chest of drawers in the bed and she fell right between the three of them without touching any of those and Dad couldn't pick her up so he called me to call 911 to get some help over and they they didn't take long to get there and they took her into the hospital and that's when she was x-rayed and they found that her hip had been fractured but a a a clean break and it wasn't shattered or broken apart and you know when we were there at the hospital I asked Mom I said I don't remember you being in the hospital ever for having to have some type of surgery I said when was the last time you were in the hospital and she thought for a moment she said when your brother was born 64 years ago was the last time I had to be in the hospital to have some surgery done so God's been good to Mom and Dad and uh they weren't able to move her over to rehab because the internet at the rehab place went down so they couldn't make the con connections but she was able to get up and walk her a little bit and sit down and get up the day after surgery and so if if you had a chance to go see her she didn't want to have her hearing aid on so it wouldn't get lost and you would think that the nurses were mad at her because they were yelling at her the whole time cuz she can't hear without hearing anything so I had to remember that but you know I was hot talking about with my mom one day and I said H how did you know that God what was it she said I was in prayer as a young teenage girl and I was baptized in a ball of fire and those around her witnessed it and God gave her the Holy Ghost as a teenager and she has served God the rest of her life we we had Godly Parents who taught us to love the Lord to go to church uh to be a Christian and I thank God God for that today but you know Christians suffer too Christians have hard times but they have a God that watches over them and they lean on that promise so you know and and so he walks with us he talks with us and he tells us you're my own amen yet

number one first and foremost his Spirit seems to be a very kind very Christian brother he's been going up to minister at the San Carlos Apache reservation there's a little church up there now this is the church if you've ever heard brother brandom talk about the Indians when they were crossing the river and they were coming to be prayed for and um and they they would come wet and U he talked about one F that came to brother Billy Paul and he wanted a prayer card brother Billy Paul said what's wrong with you and he said me sick and he says well I need to write it on the prayer card what's wrong with you and he said me sick this is the one that uh brother random talks about this is the same place that brother brand a ministered there and he found out that that's all he knew how to say it was

oh it Sav a rich like me I once was L but now are you found tonight amen I was but now I see amen thank you musicians praise the Lord and uh I will probably need just a little bit more up here brothers so let's uh bow our heads for a word of prayer and then we can have our seats Heavenly Father Lord we lord we deem it a great privilege father to come into your presence once again Lord knowing that Lord this place is just a building it's brick and mortar father but Lord what makes the difference is your people that have gathered in with your love and your faith upon their heart father Lord and as you said in your word wherever two or more are gather touching agreeing on one certain thing you promised that you'd be in our midst Lord and so we're looking to you father we're looking to the all sufficient one this evening Lord and may you come and give us special strength Lord give brother Dan and the and and the congregation here Lord uh Lord just renew our strength this evening father May there be something said May there be a fresh Vision Lord May there be an encouragement from you Lord and father at the end of the the night may we just say within our hearts wasn't not they not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way father and may you come Lord and anybody can read your word father but what it takes you Lord to get into your word and to break the word and bring out the context Lord bring out the life and may the life be released father Lord may you come and coup into our hearts and bring that message to us Lord that you would have us to know may there not be any hindering Spirits father May there be love Faith in the building this evening that your people can be helped Lord that we can all be in one mind and one Accord and and into the unity of the faith for this hour Lord we pray in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord so you may be seated it's really a a a privileged to be here with you all and I counted a great highlight and um I just want to look at you for a few minutes look at your beautiful faces so really happy to see all the smiling faces amen somebody's happy to be a Christian praise the Lord amen you're happy about your religion you have a a lifegiving religion amen oh praise the Lord so I was happy to I was certainly happy to come in the back door see all the all the folks that were in the back there enthusiastic you know like I said happy nobody was sad or disappointed that they had to come to church out of maybe some kind of a Duty or so forth so uh so God bless you brother Dan so that's a a sign that the people are wellfed spiritually happy and uh spiritually healthy amen praise the Lord and so and so as brother Dan mentioned we uh just really kind of been getting to know each other over the last month or so and I think we shook hands or so maybe about a year or two ago and um here maybe like six or so months ago somebody asked if I knew brother Dan had a chance to talk with him yet and anyways trying to make a long story short um I just felt like it was the Lord kind of keep uh kept bringing bringing it up you know so in other words there was something there just wasn't human Compassion or it wasn't you know some human desire it was actually I can say from the bottom of the heart it was the Lord that brought us together and even just one of the more more uh uh just if you all allow me a few minutes here but one of the more recent events my daughter Eliana back there we um happened to just kind of at the last minute we got a craving for a particular restaurant and normally we go in and we eat at that restaurant and it was just her and I so we said well this just order out and we'll take uh take it back home to to to everybody and so we try to make a longer story short just to show you how in in all of our walks of life a mean God has ordained every footstep every every path and I believe the prophet of God even said even our mistakes he works out to our good in his glory amen so no matter what you do if you've made a mistake if if you've done this that or the other God has got it all under control amen that's the kind of God that we serve amen praise the Lord so there's nothing that we could say or do amen we do our best we're going to fall we're going to make mistakes but even in our mistakes just repent and move on don't worry about him because he already took care of them before the foundation of the world praise the Lord before the foundation of the world he PR he predestinated everything to work for your good praise the Lord even to your mistake so as we are going we ordered the food and of course they got the order kind of me mixed up we thought it was a mixed up but we said well praise the Lord something uh happens for a reason whatever so we were held up a little bit and they were of course scrambling back in the kitchen trying to hurry up to get our order prepared and so finally they come rushing to the front they give us our order we P we pay for it and as we're walking out of the restaurant a brother comes walking right by and he happened to be uh there with us this morning and we shake hand hands and and just out of the blue he says have you met brother Dan yet so so he began talking about just some some stuff that they were talking about and so on and so forth but amen so I counted a great privilege and we don't know what what God will do we know it's for a purpose and we just want to be obedient to him and and as I've gotten to know brother Dan over the past couple of month or past month or so we were kind of shocked about how much we have in common you know we I think we were married by the same Pastor went to the same same church for a while have some very similar background and uh we left the state of Arizona at the same time not knowing each other of course we moved back to the State of Arizona at the same time and uh we even comb our hair the same so praise the Lord but uh so amen so we're looking forward to just more more friendship you know we're all part of the family of God Amen brothers and sisters of like Precious faith and so um and so I'm certainly happy to be here I I really appreciate the offer the and the opportunity to be here I don't take it lightly and uh praise the Lord so we're all we're all unique amen not a single one of us can take the other person's place so you all bear with me if I get a little excited if I say Amen too much if I say hallelujah if I do whatever it is sometimes it's just bubbling over and we can't help it amen so you do the same praise the Lord amen so amen if it's bubbling over don't be don't be afraid you no uh uh you're perfectly in order amen when when when you're when you're praising the Lord is that right because the Bible says God inhabits the Praises of his people praise the Lord so I'm happy to have my wife and children here with us uh they're on the back row but they'll just keep the back row uh that much more on fire praise the Lord so praise the Lord amen so we'll um I believe that's it so we want to just greet uh brother Dan sister Stephanie and where's uh 2.0 brother Dan 2.0 is he he's busy okay all right so uh we'll try not to be too long again just my first time here so this this will just be uh maybe a reacquaintance we'll get to know one another and um we'll see what the Lord would do for us but I certainly appreciate being here tonight and let's uh let's go ahead and stand to our feet and we will take the scripture for 2 Chronicles 2 Chronicles 29:27 can everybody hear me okay yes sir all right praise the Lord and so we'll just talk a little bit tonight we'll see how the Lord will lead us 2 Chronicles 29:27 and as I was telling brother Dan this has been a scripture that I believe the Lord quickened to me gave to me years and years years ago and it just really affected me in a very special way and so I thought you know someday I'll preach on that well that was approximately eight or so years ago and I never preached on it and just yesterday morning uh I was just thinking in my mind you know as ministers dude I had just ministered on something uh last week and then this morning and so I thought well I just kind of bring the same thing like uh no worries but then the just immediately when I went down to prayer yesterday morning real early the Holy Spirit brought this scripture back to me and I just kind of settled on it for a little bit and and then everything just kind of fell right into place so we just trust the Lord that it'll be a blessing to somebody this evening so this uh this is uh um our first time going into this so 2 Chronicles 29: 27 and then we'll also turn to Revelations 5 and then Romans 12 so just three short readings 2 Chronicles 29 and 27 and the word of the Lord says and Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the Altar and when the burnt offering began the song of the Lord began also with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel so let's go to the New Testament Revelations 5 and when the burnt offering began the song of the Lord began praise the Lord Revelations 5 verse5 we'll try to bring this present tense if the Lord will help us tonight amen because we don't serve a historical God we serve a present tense God Revelations 5 verse5 this should be a very familiar scripture and when one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold in other words look amen he was weeping but there he needed his attention to be turned Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root and uh the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof amen and I behold and lo in the midst of the throne and of the midst of the Beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain amen a bleeding bloody lamb amen as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of oders which are the prayers of saints and they sang verse n and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and ha redeemed us amen do you see yourself in the vision tonight praise the Lord and they and has redeemed us un to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation praise the Lord let's turn to Romans uh verse 12 for the last reading but you know we sing that song many of times I'm so glad I can say that I'm one of them and that's because we are we are we feel that we're identified in the scripture so Romans 12: vers one and brother Dan said this was his favorite scripture so here we are amen Romans 12:1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye trans formed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated and so the scripture says we be not conformed to the world but be ye transformed how so by the renewing of your mind amen and as that scripture that we just read in the Book of Revelations and they sang a new song unto the Lord saying Thou Art Worthy for thou Hast redeemed us and so we we we sing that song I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them and many times we're pointing backwards we're saying I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them one of them that was in the upper room I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them but tonight let's change our Focus to a present tense Vision amen the lamb coming into your Vision into our vision and oh praise God and as the offering amen comes forth May the song of the Lord come forth amen and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy in for thou Hast redeemed us oh are you part of them tonight are you can you say I'm one of them Hallelujah I'm one of them that has been a partaker of this Redemption oh my praise God and so for a little title tonight it might sound a little strange but for a title the open vision of your burnt offering and so when we speak of burnt offering of course we know that's in the Old Testament and we know that was one of the main sacrificial offerings that they had to offer as a part of their worship they had to present the the burnt offering before they could enter into the congregation of Israel amen and so we know that the reason why I said your burnt offering because it's personal tonight you must be identified with it it's it's not so much you know your neighbor burnt offering or your neighbor sacrifice we know that the Lord Jesus Christ died upon the cross for all the sins of the world but until you accept it it's not going to do you any good you might sympathize with it you might have compassion on it maybe the Lord has been calling you but until you take that next step it's not your sacrifice it's not your offering you're not identified with it amen and so it's personal to you tonight so may this be an open vision of your sacrifice of your identification of where you fit in the program of God because one of the things I share with brother Dan is I I'm focusing on perfect Faith that's my aim that's my goal I believe that should be all of our goals as Christians in this hour amen the faith that's required for this hour and perfect faith is recognizing your place in the scripture perfect faith is recognizing the word of God that has been spoken concerning you amen he knew you before the foundation of the world how many can testify of that he knew you hujjah he knew you he was just you were just as much a part of him him as as as as anything else as he was a part of himself if I can say it like that and man just think before you were born and given your Earthly name of Josiah or whatever it is brother Aaron before you were born where were you before your natural life was born you were your DNA could be traced back to your father is that right so your DNA your human makeup your human genetics that makes you up was already in existence before you were born it just took the betting ground of your mother and your father to come together to bring that DNA strand together that makes you who you are amen but that person I got news for you as much as you love that person that person must die that person must die that person must become a Perpetual offering is is that right you must you must crucify to yourself amen that person must die and so just in the in the spiritual just as you were in existence as far as your DNA and your human makeup goes you were in existence in the spiritual your eternal life before the foundation of the world so whether you realize it tonight or not there was an eternal part of you that always was and always is and always will be that's the person that I am interested in amen this person right here has given me plenty of trouble but I want to crucify this guy and find out where that other person is that person that God thought of from before the foundation of the world he had a picture of you he knew you intimately amen you were a part of him in his very thinking and his very loins and sometimes when we when we when we when we try to uh you know uh think of that you know we were in his thinking sometimes we think oh as some kind of a secondary thought or some kind of an abstract thought but you are just as much a part of him in his DNA if we can say it like that as you were in your father he knew you he had an intimate knowledge of you and he's seen you already glorified he's seen you in this condition so so it doesn't really matter what goes on down here he's bringing you to this condition praise the Lord oh my and so uh when we speak of an open Vision we know that the word of God is a vision is that right God gives Gave To His prophets and his Apostles and so forth visions and those Visions became the word of God am amen and and if we were to go just help me as as we go through this for a few more minutes but if we were to go back to 1st Samuel chapter 3:1 you don't have to turn to it but I'll just quote it the Bible says and the word of the Lord was precious in those days for there was no open Vision so there they were the the people of God called of God circumcised on the Eighth Day identified as the chosen holy people of God are uh uh have escaped the damnation of the world have escaped Egypt and come into the promised land they had the word of their Prophet they had the word of the Lord but there was no open Vision can you imagine that as Christians as as church members you know we go to church we have the Bible we we have our experiences and and sometimes it just seems as if we're drifting from church service to church service uh we're drifting maybe from from maybe the Lord will give us a victory but we we drift from that Victory from into another Victory and it just seems like it's still too much of an an up and down and in and out how many has been there before am I am I the only one praise the Lord but anyway can you imagine a Christian experience a Christian Life without an open vision and so they had that's how the children of Israel were they had the word of the Lord they had the Bible as it were to them they had the words of their Prophet amen they but it was just it might as well have just been ink on a paper it was literally etched on a stone it had not come to fruition it had not come uh to life in the sense of of coming up before them and be made and being made manifest so they can recognize the hour that they are in and so they had the word of the Lord but they they were drifting from defeat from to defeat from Victory to Victory up and down in and out and so there was no open Vision in those days and so we'll get into it in a minute and explain what an open vision is and so if we take the Amplified for that it basically says there was no vision that was proclaimed or declared as the expression of God's will so they had the the word as it were but they didn't they they the word had not been put together in a way to where they could understand the present tense will of God for their life maybe they drifted in into maybe it was a legalistic affair they knew the law they kept the Commandments they did all these things but they were still in a defeated condition they were still Bound by the things of the world they were still drugg into temptation and so on and so forth because there was no open Vision amen and we know the Bible says that where there is no vision the people will fail I'll read that in a minute but there was no without an open Vision they had no real purpose they had the law they had the Commandments they they had their land but yet there was still no real purpose for their life because that's what the word of God does and it brings to you a vision a vision of the will of God for your life amen because we have the word of God and we have the will of God and and the word of God for today becomes the will of God when it's revealed to you amen we have the word of God for Noah but today to go build an ark that's not the will of God Amen that's not the will of God but in the Noah's day that word that that was spoken to him became an open Vision it became a vision that he was walking in he was talking in he was he was he was manifesting that word and that was the will of God for his life so God is very specific he he he brought to Noah the word for that hour amen and that word of course was to build an ark but he gave him Specific Instructions what kind of pitch to use what kind of wood to use what kind of what kind of what kind of grain uh to to use perhaps to sand the wood down all of these minute instructions was the word of God Noah word upon word precept upon precept and that word just didn't if Noah just left that word there it would not do any good to them it would not serve the purpose amen but Noah by faith the Bible says by faith he moved with fear and prepared an ark for the saving of his household so the Bible says that without faith it is impossible to please God and so we must walk and act in everything we do must be by faith and it's impossible to live and and to worship by faith without a revelation of the will of God for your life because that's what the will of God brings is it brings to you faith and so now you know your purpose now you know your calling you've made your calling an election sure you know where you're at glory hallelujah amen and so that was the word of God to Noah and the word of God properly constructed took Noah and his family from the Earth to the sky amen and escaped the judgments of that world and all those that would believe that fanatical message of entering into that funnyl looking thing that they had never seen before amen they did not perish with the unbelieving world Amen and so again as we go on Amen we can see examples all throughout the scripture where where the people of God had the word of God but no open Vision or no direct expression of the present tense will of God for their life oh I wonder if God can help us tonight amen to to look a past our our difficulties amen look a past this this frail uh human life our our difficulties if it's financial troubles if it's some emotional something or another if God can just help us to to turn away from that long enough to catch the vision for today the open vision for the hour amen how many would like that in your life and then no matter the the difficulties no matter the circumstances you are walking with a purpose and then that's how we can walk like Enoch walked amen walked before God Walking with God with a testimony that he pleased God because the word of God for that hour had become an open Vision to him Hallelujah and he put it into action glory to God and today it's a living Monument for all of us to see hallelujah oh my praise the Lord and so Proverbs 29:18 we know a very familiar scripture where there is no vision the people what perish where there is no vision the people perish amen so the word must become your vision the word must become your Vision not your next or neighbor's Vision your vision because no matter what you're going to make it oh I love that song though all though I I have decided to follow Jesus though none go with me still will I follow amen but uh I'm not going to be very happy if nobody goes with me so we're we're everybody uh as many as will come come on Amen praise the Lord we're going together amen and I like that quote where brother says about two together we'll make it by the grace of God so where there is no vision the people perish where there is no expression of God's will for your life the people perish and in the Amplified where there is no revelation of God and his word where there is no vision or where there is no revelation of God and his word the people perish so you can have the word but has the word come off the pages and has it been revealed to you in a personal way to where you see yourself in the scripture and understand the perfect will of God for your life and I love this prayer the prophet prays in December 31st 1962 on the the closing of that New Year's service he says father open to us the rock beneath the rock that we might see Jesus in his program amen Jesus in his program so the prophet is praying open the rock beneath the rock that we might see Jesus and his program in other words that we might catch a vision of where we are at in the program of God praise the Lord Jesus and his program that's what I'm interested in amen not some other not somebody else's program not my program but Jesus and his program oh my Hallelujah and so just to step through this thought a little bit more on an open vision and then we'll get into the burnt offering and I want to show a little types A few types from the Old Testament just to show how tremendous this thought is on the burnt offering and all the the major things that God accomplished throughout the day throughout all all of history when these burnt offerings went up and then Lord willing if we have enough time we'll bring it uh we'll bring it present tense here but uh you know an open Vision we know as I mentioned the word of God is a vision when uh we can say as an example the prophet Isaiah he seen the Lord Jesus amen uh upon the cross and he and so on and so forth and he says uh you know he was stricken smitten of God Afflicted and so on and so forth that was a vision he seen that and then years later when we come into the New Testament in the book of Acts it was the Ethiopian unic I believe uh in Acts 8 he was reading that scripture so in other words in other words the prophet had a vision foretold an event would take place the Ethiopian unic had the Scrolls of the prophet he had the the quotes of the Prophet if it were but it was sealed off to him he couldn't see it and he and he said and of course we know by predestination that God had that Ethiopian unic in his thinking amen he had a seed over there he had a son that he needed to get he had a son that he needed to Quicken to his program for that hour amen and so it was so important amen one person can have the majority for God Amen there was a great Revival taking place in Samaria demons were cast out Mark 16 in Action a great manifestations of the Holy Ghost taking place um who knows how many thousands or whatever were there but amen God sent oh philli with that quickening power and translated him to come speak to this one man glory to God there's one man over there that doesn't have my vision yet go and speak to him him and so when he was there reading the Scrolls amen he had the word but it might as well been a newspaper because it it benefited him nothing I mean because the Bible says the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen so may we break into it into the word of God and may it break open and bring life to us tonight not just tonight but each and every day amen amen and so there was the Ethiopian unic and we know the story and how philli was translated there and he came upon the Chariot and and the Holy Spirit said draw near to him he drew near to him and he says what read understandest thou what thou readest and he said how can I unless some man interpret it for me I know that's a bad word these days but he had the word of the prophet and it was blinded to him and he was lacking a vision he would have been like a sad Christian in in other words he's got the word he's got all these Commandments all these legalistic ideas oh I got to go to church uh I hope brother Dan's not going to be preaching too long I hope brother Aaron's going to sing my favorite songs you know you're waiting what are you waiting for like a pep rally or you see that's how it is when you don't have a vision when you don't have a vision of the word of God for your life hallelujah amen amen no matter if all Hell Comes against you glory to God you'll stand because you've got the word of the Lord personally revealed to you Hallelujah that word can never fail in the mouth of a believing child amen glory to God hallelujah and so we know the story the Ethiopian unic was reading the scripture the quotes of the prophet and he said of whom speaketh the prophet of himself or of some other man hallelujah amen and so of course that was a vision that had been put on paper but Phillip to Phillip it had become an open Vision because there the prophet seen the vision and but there philli the prophet seen the vision and foretold it that it would take place and we know that the story all the scribes everybody had their interpretation but once upon a time Phillip was called to follow This Man Called Jesus and that scripture in Isaiah became an open Vision to him Hallelujah he seen it fulfilled before his eyes the word of the Lord made manifest amen and so then philli had the will of God for that hour the word of God had become the will of God to fill up because now he was walking in the vision glory to God praise the Lord and let me tell a little a little story here of the prophet he sees a vision and uh and you know let me just say this real quick I was sharing with brother Dan back in the back you know when we talk of the message of the hour we're not talking of some kind of a cliche or some kind of a something or another it's the scriptures that have that have been prophesied to be fulfilled for this hour that's Jehovah's message that's God's message for this hour and I pray that it will become a vision to you am and you'll find your place in the vision oh my and so it's the word for this hour friends and so here the prophet was on the on the platform and and and of course he's having a prayer line and there comes up a sister uh with her little baby and the little baby was afflicted was sick of some kind of uh H something and there the prophet seen a vision and he seen a vision of the little girl a few years later going along skipping along perfectly normal and well like a little child and so he said thus sayith the Lord she's healed in other words is that right so he's seen a vision of the will of God for her life for that little child's life that child was afflicted by Satan and and and and may may have lost his life it was if it wasn't for the will of God being made manifest in that hour and so the prophet goes on to says he says now that's the word of the Lord made manifest no matter what what would to take place all the forces of Hell could move against that and this is challenging here but he says the the woman don't even have to have faith it's already been declared and I know we we have to have faith Amen to because we because without faith it is impossible to please God everything we do is by faith but as I said earlier you have nothing to do with it it's already been declared and we just apply the blood apply the word by faith amen and so it's already been declared he says all forces of hell can move against that the woman don't even have to have faith she don't have to have anything because God has said so and that's the word of God materialized he says then I had thus saith the Lord so the vision of the will of God brings to you thus sayeth the Lord and no demon in hell can shake you from that because amen it's a vision it's a declaration of the word will of God for your life and if you can just pardon a personal testimony here so this brought back something brother Dan uh several years ago my uh sister she wasn't serving the lord back then she she's serving the lord now by the grace of God and at that particular time she was struggling you know she was in and out up and down and uh she was in a car accident and her four-year-old daughter at the time which of course was my niece uh went through the windshield and landed up uh 20 30 yards in the ditch she didn't have her buckled in these things because like I said she was not serving the lord she wasn't thinking right and I can say that cuz she's my sister amen but this little just imagine four-year-old girl flying through the windshield of an F-150 pickup Landing in the ditch and way out in the middle of nowhere the air VOR over to Phoenix Children's Hospital or St Joseph's or something up there and anyway she had a long story short it was brain damage and I never seen anything so hideous in my my my personal life when I walked into the hospital there was you know this four-year-old girl with a with a head like twice the size you know from the injury and solid purple and uh and so she was there in the hospital for a few days and try to make a long story short of course with the with the brain damage she she just wasn't there and like I said that was one of the saddest sites that I I've ever seen personally where she could be a normal human being she could be a normal four-year-old daughter and her name's Haley but you you could call her name Haley and she would just sit there in the bed staring out staring out the window and no matter what it was like there was nobody home of course physically she looked okay but mentally you know there was nobody home you could call her name but yet she might as well not even have been there you see what I'm saying and so I think you know that reminds me a lot of times of Christians a lot of times you know they they're in a pew but they're more or less spiritually numb they haven't received the intelligence of Christ they haven't received the word of God for their life to bring them in intelligence you could call their name you could you could bring to them the faith in the reality that this word has for them and and there's that Blank Stare but uh uh again to go on with this testimony and trying to make a long story short uh there was a vision that was declared amen and that Vision was was a dream and the dream showed her sitting in that same hospital bed perfectly well and normal and after the dream I said Satan and again that's the word of the Lord being made manifest no demon in hell can break that and and and and and after that was declared I said Satan you are defeated Hallelujah so I ran to the hospital of course laid hands on her prayed for it the very next next day she was sitting in bed normal perfectly normal perfectly healed and up to that time praise the Lord and up to that time all the nurses all the doctors said if she if she makes it out of this she'll have to relearn how to talk relearn how to walk relearn everything all over again if she makes it out of that but when Jesus came on the scene amen when the word of God was proclaimed when the vision broke forth no I don't care what any doctor said what any diagnosis was amen that was perfect faith on the scene and no matter how many demons said it wouldn't happened it was going to happen and it happened Hallelujah the very next day she was up talking like a normal child and she was released a day later praise the Lord and so now today she's a healthy normal uh child of God praise the Lord so I just want to share that a personal testimony how when the Lord brings to you a reality nothing can shake you from it me and and as I mentioned you know we drift in and we drift out of those positions at times but there's coming an hour that is very near and even upon us where there will be no more drifting we'll be in that Vision perfect Faith hallelujah hallelujah praise God and so the prophet if I can use this illustration again he gives an example of three different spheres that Christians live in how many has heard this before three different spheres so up here we would say is heaven the kingdom of God or however you want to illustrate it and then there's three spares the the top sphere he said is is the sublime right next to heaven the second sphere and then then there's the first the bottom sphere he said the bottom sphere is basically Bally the formal church member that would just drift in drift out they with all their ritualistic Affairs he says in one place and let me just go ahead and read it I have it right here he says uh and there's another sphere he says right next to heaven where the powers of God is leaking down so the powers of God is leaking down through all these spheres and by the time it gets to gets to the nominal church member they just go on in cold professions in a little r ritualistic affair he says that is the nominal Church they just get the very slight drippings so they just go on with their little ritualistic Affairs to to help them to feel religious and like they're doing their Duty that's the nominal church member but God has more for you amen God has a better plan for you so the next sphere above that is the sphere as he called the Full Gospel Fe sphere think about that the the Full Gospel sphere amen we would say oh praise the lord we want to be there but he said they go off into isms it reminds me of if I can just deviate for a second when Elijah called Elisha if you remember he said I'm going to gilgal I believe it was right I'm going to gilgal and that is the place of Christian Beginnings in other words as a Christian that is the beginning of your journey we could say would be gilgal then he moved from there to the school of the prophets and then he moved from there and across Jordan but Elijah Elijah was called to follow him and not to stop in gilgal not to stop in the school of the prophets but to go all the way across Jordan to an open Vision where the word of the Lord was made manifest amen and so so it is with these spheres the bottom sphere is the n nominal fundamental church member the next one would be like the Full Gospel where the Prophet said they run off into isms they run off into their own ideas their own doctrines their own this their own that but the next sphere is the sublime the next sphere is perfect Faith the next fear is the word of the Lord made manifest for your life and that is the that is what every one of us has in this hour is the opportunity to live in that in to live in that place amen and so that's God's word materialized and the Bride of Jesus Christ is just just as much of the word as he is the word amen the Bride of Jesus Christ is just as much the word as he is the word but what if that word concerning you could be materialized you would live in a realm of perfect Faith amen and so let's just go to a few examples of this real quick praise the Lord how much more time do we have brother Dan all right praise the Lord amen but I just trust this will be a blessing to you and in in in in other words like I said May the word of God become a vision to us become an open Vision to us and as I mentioned the burnt sacrifice or the burnt offering we know uh was a part of of their Old Testament worship every worshipper that would come to God that would come to the Tabernacle they had to uh offer an offering is that right they had to place their hand upon the lamb or whatever type of offering they're offering and the Bible said that they had to place it not upon the foot or upon the back back or upon the shoulder but they had to place their hand upon the head upon the head of the lamb and that's the word that's being revealed in this hour is not the foot part not the not the shoulder part but the head part so that's what we're called to be identified is the head part of our sacrifice the head part of the word the head part of the lamb and if we were to go back and look at all of the Old Testament examples if we can just look at a few of them for a second so maybe the Lord will help us to catch a reality of this burnt offering and how important it is amen so it was essential in Every Act of Christian worship or every act of worship throughout the Old Testament and I believe if I'm not mistaken the word burnt offering uh is a Hebrew word that means to ascend in other words offer an offering that will Ascend offer an offering that will cause Ascension and and and and and and and it was one of the very few offerings where they would uh not just kill it but they had to actually uh they had to actually tear it apart they had to tear the insides out they had to it had to be everything had to be consumed not just a not just a hand not just a a leg and that's what God wants of you tonight amen he doesn't want just your just your hand you know to do some work around the church or your foot to go walk and testify to somebody he wants every aspect of your being amen a complete sacrifice holy and acceptable to God which is your reasonable service something that will help you overcome The Temptations of this hour something that'll help you overcome all the complexes and all of the all of the attacks and anxiety and so forth that Satan is bringing against us in this hour because he's doing all he can to stop us from coming to the realization of this open Vision being made known to you and I Hallelujah because when that happens his accusing is over his accusing as the scripture says that he is the accuser of the Brethren is it okay if I just bounce back and forth for a little bit praise the Lord he is the accuser of the Brethren and we know that your name if you're if you're predestinated as a son or daughter of God your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation in the world Amen so it's not just don't think of it as a natural book here like this but it's something that is so special to God like I said he knew of you intimately knew you not your natural you but the you that you're supposed to be because God foresaw and predestinated a world of Sons and Daughters of God Amen he predestinated a world of perfect Faith he predestinated a world of of no sickness of no sorrow he predestinated a world of of sub of of of sublime Joy praise the Lord and so he foresaw you he had a knowing of you of your characteristics of your potential and so on and so forth before the foundation of the world and he placed your name in a book if would you say like that called the Lamb's Book of Life and the Bible refers to the Book of Life and the Lamb's Book of Life and the book of life is a record of your natural life all of your Deeds that was done in the book amen maybe when you told that lie or you uh you you stole something or you you hit a home run it doesn't have to all be negative right but you hit a home run or you did this or you did that that's all record in your natural life and see Satan has access to that he can he can see oh Dan you did this last week you did this over there seeing as long as we are walking by that book we're blinding ourselves from our true identity is that right because our true identity the open Vision that we should be walking by is the Lamb's Book of Life yes sir amen not our natural life but the life of the Lamb we must be identified with our sacrifice place your head on your sacrifice or place your hand on the head of your sacrifice it's your sacrifice it's your identity you're identified with this lamb oh as the worshiper amen would would raise this lamb think about that and it and it was a lamb without blemish he would know that it met the qualifications Hallelujah it met the requirements of Jehovah God this holy God this righteous God this lamb that I had been feeding that I had been raising day in and day out glory to to God Amen that's what you're doing amen every time you come to church every time you hear the word of the Lord you're feeding the real you you're feeding that perfect lamb glory to God hallelujah amen so let's offer an offering acceptable to God which is your reasonable service being not conformed to the things of the world but being transformed being transformed from your old nature from the your nature in the book of life being transformed to an open Vision to the nature in the Lamb's work of Life your original nature the nature that you would have been born with had there been no fall Hallelujah glory to God just's think about that amen let's catch a vision may God help us and so Satan has access to that book of life he can say you did this you thought that you did this you did did that but by the grace of God that book if we read the Bible in Romans 7 go home and read it when you get home it talks about it seems like marriage and divorce that that you can't be married while you have a living mate and so on and so forth but it's a prophecy for this hour it's a prophecy for the last day that your first nature that you were born with from The Book of Life must be dead must be dead and if we go to the burnt offering must be totally consumed no remembrance of it left dead no more complexes amen no more frustrations no none of these things because that is all in the natural book but by the grace of God you're transformed by the renewing of your mind in other words not anything that you can do we we we can no more save oursel then we can take our our our shoes and jump over the Moon I mean we can't do that but it's simply abiding in his shakina glory the word of the Lord made manifest walking in the light as he is in the light and the blood of Jesus Christ what cleanses you from all unrighteousness there is therefore now no condemnation to them that walk after this open Vision amen that walk not after the flesh after the book of life but after the Lamb's Book of Life that has become your identity praise the Lord amen so Satan has access to that book of life amen but one thing he doesn't have access to is the Lamb's Book of Life because it was written before he ever came into existence hallelujah amen so so the worshipper was Raising this lamb raising this lamb and and he would examine examine it examine it examine it does it have a blemish and no I don't think it has a blemish he brings it to the priest the priest examines it and they don't do just like we do you know like some kind of H Hazard like oh I think I'll be okay you know I'll just go to church and I'll I'll fake it this time or whatever they get a magnifying glass and they're examining every detail and and and and is wonderful though when we can lay before his presence and let our heart open up and let every detail of our life be consumed by his holy fire Hallelujah and so that lamb that that uh worshipper would offer his perfect lamb and before that lamb was to be slaughtered he would place his hand upon the head of that lamb and we know we know the story and we know the the symbology of it it was in essence transferring his sins to the lamb in other words it was was making a sacrifice and that sacrifice would be consumed would be would be hacked to Pieces amen because this is a bloody religion amen this is a lifegiving religion this is a religion that's got blood in it Hallelujah I'm not much for a bloodless religion I'm not much for a lifeless Rel religion but the worshipper would take that perfect lamb and and offer it as a sacrifice and it was accepted before God as an atonement Hallelujah we know that was a temporary atonement he had to do it day in and day out year in and year out and so on and so forth until the real Lamb of God has come on the scene until the real Lamb of God Has Come amen the perfect one without sin from before the foundation of the world came on the scene amen and purchased our Redemption for us amen and so the burnt offering amen is something that has been all throughout life all throughout history I should say and let's do look at these Old Testament types and may the Lord help us to apply it to today and hopefully you can see the living reality of what we have before us today Amen in all the Old Testament types we know the first example they say and it's commonly believe that Abel offered a burnt offering with his sacrifice we know the Bible says that in process of time the Cain and Abel brought it was it was time for them to bring an offering Cain worshiped by intellect Cain worshiped by uh maybe the works of his hands right bringing his fruits and things that he had toiled for but Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice because it was revealed to Abel he offered that burnt offering and it was accepted to God Amen Noah think about that when Noah had came from from the old world as we were saying earlier that world was destroyed and he had stepped into the ark and and and and was lifted above the judgment and was transferred into the new world praise the Lord the second Earth if we can say it like that and so there we know the story as God showed him the rainbow and said it was going to be a covenant and I I'll send my my rainbow my bow in the cloud which will be a covenant for you and there Noah offered a burnt offering and God's covenant was confirmed to Noah by the acceptance of the burnt offering Abraham we know in his final test Abraham Abraham had been tested many many times many many years throughout his life as the word of God was being unfolded to him as it was being unfolded to him more and more and more until he got to the spot of complete surrender think about that how surrendered this man must have been how how pure how perfect the word of God was for his life to where when God said this son of yours that you've waited on for 25 years he's now at the ripe age of a 12-year-old healthy young man amen that when God told him go and sacrifice him go and make him a burnt offer offing to me oh my what how what a surrender what a consecration amen how many can can aspire to live to that kind of a consecration amen No Matter What God Says I I'll I'll surrender every aspect of my life and it's not an overnight thing you know Abraham wouldn't have done that as soon as he came out of out of Babel he wouldn't have done that he would have said no way Lord I must be hallucinating or something amen so and but it was a but God knows and it was a a continual walk a continual unfolding surrender after surrender mistake after mistake trial after trial to where he got to a spot where he was completely surrendered a complete prisoner to the will of almighty God and almighty God said take him and offering a offer him as a burnt offering and we know the story he took him three days journey to mount Mariah and there uh when he was about to offer him God said stay your hand Abraham for now I know that thou lovest me with all thine heart in blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thee and thy seed shall possess the Gate of their enemy Hallelujah glory to God so as that offering was accepted that's where Jehovah Gyra was made manifest amen he God's Provisions God Abraham did not know Jehovah as Jehovah Gyra before Hallelujah Abraham did not know God as Jehovah Gyra before so think about that through your tests through your trials amen God is wanting to reveal himself to you in a more intimate way Hallelujah he only knew him as the strength giver and so on and so forth but now after he had been put to his final test he could call him Jehovah Gyra he had come to the spot where he knew God as a Creator he knew God in the Capstone revelation of what he was to be known in that hour and the promise came thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy amen and the Book of Samuel as we referred to earlier where there were before him there was no open Vision the people did whatever was right in their eyes the priests did whatever was right in their eyes everybody had their own Doctrine their own idea all of these things and so much where the lamp of God had gone out in the sanctuary oh my and so there was no open Vision but Samuel brought an open Vision back and up to that time you know the enemies had defeated Israel the Philistines and so forth had defeated them they even had took the ark away from Israel and here we come to or defeat after defeat and they and they come to such a spot in second 1st Samuel 7 where the Philistines were now coming upon Israel and Israel was scared to death they ran like a bunch of cowards because they didn't have the word of God in their midst but yet the Bible says that Samuel offered a burnt offering amen and when the and when the burnt offering was offered up anden Jehovah God thundered out of heaven and confuse the enemy the burnt offering was offered up and the V open Vision to Israel was restored amen and we know the 2 kings8 Elijah same thing amen Israel had been T taken over excuse me in idolatry and and Ahab and Jezebel and all these things the prophets of bell and all this kind of idol worship and so on and so forth all this confusion is this idea right is that idea right is is this God right is that God right but God had a prophet on the scene he was going to bring a showdown a showdown an open Vision before them and we know the we know the story he brought God gave Elijah a vision and when it came time for Elijah he said he he called the prophets of bell and said let the god that answers by fire let him be God Amen and so Elijah did everything according to the vision that God had given given him according to the vision that God had given him and after it was precise everything was in order it was not no halfway circumstance everything was in order amen just like when they dedicated the temple and everything was in order and finally when they set the Ark in its place the shakina glory came rushing in but here they are in Second Kings in the Mount Carmel Showdown everything was in its place all the Bullocks everything was done according to the word of the Lord that had been revealed to Elijah and we know the story he offered the burnt offering or he put everything down and God answered by fire and brought a restoration brought a restoration that hour by a burnt offering by an open vision of that burnt offering the word of the Lord being made manifest amen praise the Lord and we won't have time to read it but if you can go back and you want to read the whole second uh the whole chapter of 2 Chronicles chapter 29 verse 23 let me just read a little bit for a few seconds we'll start with verse 20 you don't have to turn there but let me just quote it then Hezekiah the king Rose early and gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the Lord so before Hezekiah the temple was was destroyed the the lamp of God had went out the seven golden candlesticks which you know represent the seven spirits of God and so on and so forth they had went out there was idolatry everywhere the the everything that was consecrated to God was in a mess and they even closed the doors of the temple and that was their way of worship back then there was no access to God the priests had backslid and went in their own imaginations and in their own ways and their own doctrines and their own ideas and so much to where the lamp of God had went out the the doors to the temple were closed there was no access to God but God dealt with the King Hezekiah and it's a beautiful story uh you can go back and read it it would be it be a real blessing but here Temple worship was restored Temple worship was restored and it was only after the word of the Lord has been brought back into its proper place the the temple had been cleansed this the the the lamps had been turned back on everything had been brought to its proper place and here we come to the first day of the first month of the new year and that's a good time to start worshiping God I mean you can turn the calendar in your life tonight and this can be a different night for you from this day forward you can walk in an open Vision then Hezekiah the king Rose early and gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the Lord and they brought seven Bullocks and seven Rams and seven lambs and and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah and he commanded the priest the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the Lord so they killed the Bullocks and the priest received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed the Rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the Lambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar amen like I said a bloody religion they were having a holy ghost Revival in other words they were being identified with all of this word of the all of this word had had had been opened up and was now being placed before them all right let me just try to hurry up so he's talking about the priest killing them I want to get down to this spot here which is just so beautiful and he set the Levites in the house of the Lord with symbols with posteries with harps according to the Commandment of David and of GAD the king Seer and Nathan the prophet and so was the and and so and for so was the Commandment of the Lord by the prophets and the Levites stood with the instruments of David and the priests with the trumpets and Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the Altar and when the burnt offering began the song of the Lord began also with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel and all the congregation worshiped and the singer sang and the trumpeters sounded why because they're all catching a vision Hallelujah they were all in harmony under this burnt offering and the song of the Lord hallelujah not just any song but the song of the Lord and the congregation worship and the the singer sang and the trumeter sounded and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished now when I first read this I'm thinking you know 10 15 20 minutes you know but let's go on and when they had made a end of the offering the king and all them that were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped let's just read and the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought was three score verse 32 thank you and the number of the burnt offerings which the congregations brought was three score and 10 Bullocks 70 100 Rams 200 lambs and these were for a burnt offering wow amen so amen what is that 70 uh 100 and 200 so 370 amen burnt offerings and while the burnt off and when the burnt offering began think about the anointing think about the the vision everyone in harmony the word of God in its place nothing out of place no complexes no no no no hiccups from some past experience or something you know like I'm I'm I'm hurt because of what this other Prophet did or what this other priest did to me over there all of that was gone the sacrifice had been offered they were entering into the vision the word of the Lord made manifest for temple worship Temple worship ship had been restored glory to God thank God for that King hallelujah thank God that he applied the word to his life he brought everything in order and there the congregation brought amen 370 burnt offerings amen and as they laid them on there as they excuse me but as they were hacked as they were skinned as they were cut open as the blood was flying as all this was happening the trumpet ERS were trumpeting the singers were singing the ju the worshippers were worshiping they were all brought in harmony Hallelujah they were all brought in unity into the vision into perfect harmony with the word of the Lord for that hour glory to God Amen May the trumpeters come praise the Lord May the musicians come amen we'll wind it up so let me try to wind it up real quick May the musicians come amen but they were all brought in Harmony they lay aside their their ideas their doubts their selfish Ambitions they had crucified to themselves their desires and so on and so forth they in other words they did what Romans 12 does us to do Amen to offer a burnt offering of our ideas of our life of all these things and be not conformed to this world but being transformed by the re renewing our mind that we may prove what is that good and perfect perfect and acceptable will of God for our life and so they were all there in one Accord worshiping just play something softly and and and and trumpeting and uh and playing out the vision playing out the word of the Lord for their life amen and let me just read that I was trying to quote it but Paul says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so being transformed am mean it's not an overlight thing like I said it's a day byday consecration that you may prove what is the acceptable and perfect will of God for your life and as I mentioned you've got to move from The Book of Life to your identification in the Lamb's Book of Life I hope that doesn't sound too strange but the Bible says let me just read this real quick in Colossians 3 Colossians 3:3 go ahead and put that up if you have a second Colossians 3:3 for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God so you are dead but you're life is hid with Christ in God so there's two 's in other words there's two use there's two Natures inside of you if you are predestinated son or daughter of God there's two Natures that old nature is identified in The Book of Life which Satan has access to that but you must be transformed into the Lamb's work of life and this must become your identification and therefore there is no condemnation to them that walk after this because this becomes your open Vision this becomes your mind the mind of Christ this becomes and the way that you prove the perfect and acceptable will of God for your life and and and until then you're you're a church member until then you're you're you're that's okay but keep going on don't stop there don't stop for nothing keep going on until you can prove not guess not Wonder but prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for your life and so again as the Bible says in Colossians 3 for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God so when Paul wrote this nearly 2,000 years ago he's saying your life is hid but there's going to come a time when your life is no longer hid your life is hid with Christ in God so there comes a time when your life comes forth from the Eternal realm your life which is Christ comes forth and is made manifest before you as an open Vision amen because Paul went on to prophesy and say when Christ who is our life we are identified with our sacrifice tonight amen when Christ who is our life shall appear shall be revealed when Christ who is our life shall be revealed then shall we also appear with him in glory amen when Christ who is our life shall come forth from eternity he shall come forth and make himself known just like he did after the resurrection amen by the breaking of the bread is that right when he shall come forth that word appearing means Revelation amen at the Apocalypse at the unveiling at the revelation of Jesus Christ your life was hid with Christ in God but there was coming a Time according to Paul that your life comes forth when Christ comes forth to reveal himself so in other words this is the word of the Lord Paul seen this by Vision but now we have the opportunity to walk into the vision to step into the vision the word of the Lord has a vision for every one of us in our lives amen and let's just stand to our feet tonight and let me let me read this quote here the prophet says again speaking of Revelations FL five and the lamb proceeded out in into this Vision now as it had been slain Notice come from the father's Throne oh think where did he advance from to this Vision he come from Glory where he is Seated on the right hand of God he Advanced forth to John put your name in there amen because John represents the bride he Advanced forth to you why because he died for you he died to redeem you to bring you back to God he died for you you must be identified with your sacrifice you must step in and become a part of this vision and he will advance forth forward tonight to make himself known to you in the power of his resurrection in the power of the the word of the Lord made manifest for your life and you'll then move from that sphere to this sphere to the next sphere as the word of the Lord because the Bible says that the righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith amen and so let us just bow our heads and close our eyes and meditate upon him as I as as I finish reading this may the Lord help us and give us strength for the journey that lays ahead amen so where did he advance from to this Vision he came from Glory where he is seated at the right hand of God he advaned forth to Nathaniel Barrett he Advanced forth to you out of Glory oh would it not be a glorious thing if our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accept him and he would Advance all the way from Glory tonight to make himself known to any of you whatever your need is if it's salvation if if it's more of the perfect will of God being made manifest in your life he can advance forth to you not to you tonight you must be identified with your sacrifice and he can identify himself with you so whatever you have need of if it's strength for the journey strength for service a fresh vision of the perfect will of God in your life where you no more more walking by your own human strength day in and day out but you can now be renewed as the as as the as the eagle would renew its youth you can be renewed and receive the strength of the word of the Lord amen let us just bow our heads and close our eyes for a word of prayer and we'll be happy if anybody would like prayer we'll be happy to pray for you we' be happy to do whatever we can to help you along your journey in this hour just open up your heart before him you've got to be identified with your sacrifice you've got to be identified with the word of the Lord that was spoken for you spoken for you may it become your vision tonight and from and from tonight forward may you walk by this vision and ask God to remove the scales from your eyes that you could see with a Clear Vision this one that has stepped forward from eternity to reveal himself to you you
