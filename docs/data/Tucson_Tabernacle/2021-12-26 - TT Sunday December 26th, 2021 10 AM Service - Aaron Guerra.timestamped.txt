[16:25] let's get the words to that first verse
[16:27] if we could
[16:28] [Music]
[16:33] we are often tossed and driven
[16:36] on the restless sea of time
[16:39] somber skies and howling tempest
[16:42] offseason
[16:44] bright sunshine
[16:46] that land of perfect day
[16:50] [Music]
[17:01] when the morning comes
[17:05] [Music]

[17:21] we are often destitute
[17:24] of the things that life demands want a
[17:27] food and want of shelter thirsty hills
[17:31] barren lands but we're trusting in the
[17:34] lord and according to god's word we will
[17:39] understand it better by and by
[17:46] and by
[17:48] when the morning comes
[17:50] when all the saints
[17:53] of god are gathered home

[18:02] [Music]
[18:13] all the ways that god would lead us to
[18:16] the blessed promised land
[18:19] but he'll guide us with his eye
[18:22] and we'll follow till we die

[18:31] oh by and by
[18:34] when the morning comes
[18:36] when all the saints of god are gathered
[18:45] [Music]
[18:54] our cherished plans have failed
[18:56] disappointments have prevailed
[18:59] and we've wandered in the darkness heavy
[19:02] hearted and alone but we're trusting in
[19:06] the lord and according to his word

[19:31] how we've overcome
[19:33] and we'll understand it better by and by
[19:39] temptations hidden snares often take us
[19:43] unawares and our hearts are made to be
[19:47] for some thoughtless word ordeal and we
[19:50] wonder why the test
[19:52] when we try to do our best but we'll
[19:56] understand it better by and by

[27:08] you may be seated we have a few
[27:10] announcements and thank you
[27:13] to bring to your attention
[27:17] um
[27:18] [Music]
[27:19] yesterday brother jordan
[27:21] [Music]
[27:24] you know around noon are so informed is
[27:26] it sister lori
[27:28] mr martha peterson's mom passed away
[27:32] and um
[27:34] they were
[27:37] in in his text that he sent us he said
[27:39] the atmosphere was wonderful
[27:42] the
[27:43] the lord had been with him no question
[27:45] about it
[27:46] and that is the consolation that a
[27:49] christian has
[27:51] that in all things god is there
[27:54] [Music]
[27:55] at times we might think god is has
[27:57] backed away or he's not watching but
[27:59] he's there
[28:00] he's taking care of all things
[28:03] she had just turned 60 years old they
[28:05] were celebrating
[28:07] her birthday
[28:09] and also their 39th
[28:11] wedding anniversary so
[28:14] it's one of those things as a human you
[28:16] look and say why
[28:18] but as a christian you say lord you know
[28:20] what's best in all things
[28:23] brother jordan did say that the
[28:24] atmosphere and the presence there was
[28:26] wonderful it was
[28:27] it was the atmosphere and the presence
[28:29] that christians have about them
[28:32] because god said i'll never leave you
[28:34] i'll never forsake you
[28:35] he didn't say you'll understand it all
[28:38] but there would be comfort in that time
[28:40] so
[28:41] no arrangements made yet it's it's
[28:44] early but
[28:46] they would let us know so remember the
[28:48] whole family
[28:51] i know that wednesday night
[28:54] at the end of service and i just had
[28:55] turned over to sister martha to answer
[28:58] something something just said let the
[29:00] sisters pray for her
[29:02] so that she came up and then
[29:04] at the end of service she had said
[29:07] i needed something like that i asked i
[29:09] had asked the lord if he could allow
[29:11] that him god is mindful of his of his
[29:14] children also
[29:17] when we put this on on the whatsapp
[29:20] brother luke foster sister cheryl hall's
[29:22] father passed away
[29:23] this past week it's been some time since
[29:26] i'd seen brother luke here but at one
[29:28] time he would play the guitar up here
[29:30] with us
[29:31] some time but
[29:32] i asked how mom was doing the sister
[29:36] foster was doing well she's 81 but doing
[29:38] well so um just remember them in prayer
[29:42] also
[29:43] and then yesterday
[29:46] afternoon
[29:47] i've got
[29:49] from brother matthew watkins and also
[29:51] brother um
[29:54] reggie plett that brother tim cross had
[29:56] been in a motorcycle accident
[29:59] on saturday he was
[30:01] riding his father's motorcycle
[30:03] and he went around a career and lost
[30:05] control
[30:07] sister faith had said possibly
[30:09] concussion
[30:11] bruised or broken shoulder
[30:13] that was yesterday afternoon
[30:16] no
[30:18] update from that
[30:20] but just believing that the lord would
[30:22] would be bring quick healing
[30:24] i know
[30:27] brother cross is supposed to be with us
[30:29] the last sunday of
[30:31] harmony and then from there going to
[30:33] nicaragua too
[30:34] for a youth
[30:36] convention down there so let's remember
[30:38] that
[30:40] and
[30:41] we
[30:43] we wonder why
[30:45] we ask god lord i don't understand
[30:48] and maybe as a human you might even
[30:50] question and say lord
[30:52] if you're with us then why these things
[30:56] but
[30:58] it's a it's a faith walk with god
[31:01] you have to to to say lord i committed
[31:03] to you
[31:05] i you know what's best for me and you
[31:07] know the reasons why so
[31:09] we'll keep them in prayer
[31:12] and and
[31:14] as we get more information we'll pass it
[31:16] on so
[31:19] and then i had been wondering about the
[31:22] youth
[31:22] choir because they had no more
[31:24] information but sister lily said they
[31:26] posted on the announcement that it would
[31:28] be here
[31:30] on january 8th which is a saturday
[31:32] evening
[31:33] i don't know much more details than that
[31:35] but that we were all invited
[31:39] and then of course harmony in the desert
[31:41] january 12-16
[31:43] that wednesday evening on the 12th
[31:47] brother branham preached for the first
[31:49] time in tucson
[31:50] here at the tabernacle with central
[31:53] assembly of god behind this physical
[31:54] pulpit
[31:56] so that night we will play that message
[31:58] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[32:00] and forever
[32:02] brother john hall posted
[32:04] sent me a message and there's an
[32:05] announcement that they posted on the
[32:07] newspaper
[32:08] for those services so if we can get a
[32:10] copy of that we'd like to post that up
[32:12] also
[32:14] so
[32:16] brother
[32:18] dan evans was here with us on sunday
[32:21] they're here in tucson now
[32:23] happy to be here we've asked him
[32:25] to minister for us on wednesday night
[32:27] and he said he would do that
[32:29] then brother john mcfadden will be here
[32:31] this sunday following sunday
[32:33] a week from today
[32:34] and ministering the sunday morning
[32:36] service for sure he was not sure if he
[32:38] would take both services so
[32:40] those are just things too look forward
[32:42] and this evening servants has been
[32:44] canceled tonight so we're just having
[32:46] the one morning service
[32:48] and um
[32:50] let's take advantage of what god has for
[32:52] us this morning so
[32:55] again keeping the tablets and family the
[32:57] peterson and all those that are affected
[33:00] foster family
[33:02] brother tim cross in prayer
[33:04] and again i'm reminded of the southern
[33:06] family with brother jason
[33:09] and our sister pat and them going
[33:11] through that time and i know it's a time
[33:13] of questioning a time of wondering why
[33:16] but god is more than able to
[33:18] so if you'll stand with me i
[33:21] something in my heart today
[33:24] maybe a continuation from last sunday
[33:27] thank you
[33:30] where we spoke on
[33:33] just
[33:34] faith as a revelation so
[33:37] let's just bow our heads lord we
[33:40] we come this morning on a sunday morning
[33:42] the first day of the week resurrection
[33:44] morning lord
[33:46] to honor that because
[33:48] you're jesus christ the same yesterday
[33:50] today and forever
[33:52] lord and that's the identification
[33:55] of of god is the consistency the
[33:59] sameness
[34:00] no variable there's no shadow of turning
[34:02] something that is that is secure that is
[34:05] permanent lord
[34:06] you're the same yesterday today and
[34:08] forever lord
[34:09] we ask you to have your own way to
[34:11] minister to us this morning we can set
[34:14] ourselves aside lord and let you speak
[34:17] to our hearts and draw us closer to you
[34:18] as our prayer
[34:20] in jesus christ's name amen
[34:22] one scripture hebrews
[34:25] 13 8
[34:27] the theme of brother branham's message
[34:32] jesus christ the same yesterday
[34:35] today and forever
[34:38] again jesus christ the same
[34:41] yesterday today
[34:43] and forever amen you may be seated
[34:49] as much as we want to be consistent as
[34:51] much as we want to be the same we're
[34:53] affected by events around us
[34:56] by the feeling of our own infirmities by
[34:58] by situations that
[35:01] are out of our control and even
[35:02] sometimes in our control
[35:04] and we can have our up days and down
[35:06] days
[35:08] but he's the same
[35:10] yesterday
[35:11] looking back into history and everything
[35:14] behind and you see how is
[35:16] today
[35:18] and forever
[35:19] so it's it's
[35:21] it is uh uh something to take uh comfort
[35:24] in to have confidence in
[35:27] that it's going to be consistent it's
[35:28] going to be the same
[35:30] if you approach him in the manner he
[35:32] said to approach him he'll be there
[35:34] it's not going to be like i hope he's
[35:36] there
[35:38] you know sometimes you might be
[35:40] we might be driving down the road and he
[35:42] would say you know it'd be nice to stop
[35:44] by and see we're close to that let's
[35:45] stop by and see them let's hope they're
[35:46] there
[35:48] and let's hope they want to see us too
[35:50] but you know that if you if you if
[35:52] you'll bow down to him if you humble
[35:54] your heart before him he is ready to
[35:56] minister and draw an eye to you
[35:58] and then we'll look at hebrews 11
[36:00] 6 we use this scripture last
[36:03] last sunday
[36:05] hebrews 11 6.
[36:08] without faith
[36:10] it is impossible to please him
[36:13] for he that cometh to god must believe
[36:15] that he is
[36:17] he exists he's the same yesterday today
[36:19] and forever and that he he is a reward
[36:22] of rewarder of them that diligently seek
[36:26] them lord i've come sunday morning
[36:29] and i'm going to give you two hours
[36:31] today
[36:32] and you go ahead and take care of all my
[36:34] needs and then the rest of the week is
[36:36] mine that's not what the scripture says
[36:39] those that diligently seek him which
[36:41] means there is there's constant there is
[36:44] you know um
[36:46] knowing a little bit of brother lyle's
[36:47] background in his work and talking to
[36:49] him some
[36:51] in in
[36:52] the discoveries or should i say the
[36:54] things that the company that they did
[36:56] and all there's a lot of hours of work
[36:58] behind that
[37:01] it doesn't happen the thought may come
[37:03] the impression may come
[37:05] uh you know that there's something there
[37:07] but to search it out to work through it
[37:10] to work all the bugs out to to get it to
[37:12] work properly
[37:14] we were talking about some
[37:16] another conversation about some large
[37:18] vehicles we'd seen and things
[37:21] driving down the road and you see these
[37:22] these caravans the large trucks with all
[37:24] the escorts and i asked something
[37:26] brother lila i said what is the biggest
[37:28] vehicle you've ever been on
[37:30] and he said at the time it was the
[37:31] largest dump truck in the world
[37:34] and they had provided the controls on
[37:36] that and they let him drive it
[37:40] but it didn't happen just one day there
[37:43] was a lot of work to get to that place
[37:47] and god if i could put it this way in
[37:48] god's mind he had seen it all already
[37:52] and he knew what it would take
[37:54] to get to this place
[37:56] we celebrate christmas the world
[37:58] celebrates christmas
[38:01] he was born
[38:03] for a reason
[38:06] now you could read the scriptures and
[38:08] know where to say well he was born on
[38:10] this day and it would be 33 years
[38:12] but the events tell us how it it it
[38:15] proceeded to come to this to the day
[38:17] where he would kneel down at gethsemane
[38:19] and says not my will but thy will be
[38:21] done father
[38:23] had his heart set towards jerusalem to
[38:25] fulfill that which he had desired
[38:28] so again without faith it is impossible
[38:32] no way to please god
[38:35] and and it's it's
[38:37] faith
[38:39] you know you take the word faith it's an
[38:41] absolute trust confidence belief
[38:44] you'll lay your eternal destination on
[38:47] it
[38:49] you're willing to say i'll give it all
[38:51] for that
[38:53] hebrews 12 1
[38:57] take this one here wherefore seeing we
[38:59] are also compassed about with so great a
[39:02] cloud of witnesses
[39:04] let us lay aside every weight and the
[39:07] sin
[39:08] sin is unbelief
[39:11] the attributes of unbelief demonstrate
[39:13] them in many different ways
[39:15] there's unbelief you say well i don't
[39:17] not believe in god
[39:21] but
[39:21] can you believe to believe that he's
[39:23] with you
[39:25] i would never say i don't believe that
[39:26] there is no god but what about is he
[39:28] mindful of me
[39:30] what's my position with him where do i
[39:32] stand with him
[39:34] let us lay aside every weight and the
[39:36] sin that doth so easily beset us and let
[39:39] us run with patience the race that is
[39:42] set before us
[39:44] patience
[39:45] there's a step by step to get to the end
[39:48] i ran cross country in my sophomore year
[39:53] and
[39:54] you started at the beginning and you
[39:56] finished at the end
[39:58] sometimes
[40:00] and in my case a few times
[40:02] you didn't run hard through the whole
[40:04] thing
[40:05] especially getting i started
[40:08] running when the season started so i was
[40:09] not in shape to be running
[40:12] but those that had been running for a
[40:14] long time worked out all summer
[40:17] they ran hard from the beginning to the
[40:19] very end
[40:20] at the end of the season i was barely
[40:22] getting into the shape that they had
[40:24] started in so i was way behind them
[40:26] but there's a race set before us
[40:31] and there's a there's a battle to be won
[40:33] there's victories to have
[40:35] and you've got to go forward with this
[40:36] and just
[40:38] therefore surrounded as we are by such a
[40:41] vast cloud of witnesses
[40:43] let us fling aside every encumbrance
[40:46] and the sin that does so readily
[40:48] entangle our feet
[40:50] and let us run with patience
[40:53] patient endurance the race that lies
[40:55] before endurance
[40:58] when you hear the word endure
[41:01] you don't think oh that's going to be a
[41:02] picnic
[41:03] when you hear the word endurance endure
[41:05] know that there's going to be a battle
[41:06] there's going to be a time there's going
[41:08] to be a lot of effort that's going to be
[41:10] put forth
[41:12] but there is a cloud of witnesses
[41:15] that say it's worth every bit of it
[41:18] they'd courage if you could hear them
[41:19] speaking you'll come my brother come i
[41:21] said don't give up
[41:23] don't call it a day yet
[41:26] because we have overcome
[41:28] and another way and i that that i really
[41:31] just looked at how somebody wrote this
[41:33] wherefore being encompassed with a cloud
[41:35] a great multitude
[41:37] trending upward with a holy swiftness
[41:40] of witnesses of the power of faith
[41:44] let us lay aside every way
[41:47] as all who run a race take care to do
[41:51] to throw off whatever weighs us down or
[41:54] dampens the vigor of our soul
[41:57] and the sin that which so easily besets
[42:00] us let us lay that all aside
[42:04] i thought that was a good description
[42:06] there as every runner does
[42:09] when you're training
[42:11] you might see them training football
[42:13] player or something they'll put weights
[42:16] on themselves they'll carry their drag
[42:17] to build build their strengths up but
[42:19] when it comes to the performance all
[42:21] that is set aside
[42:24] if you're running you could try to get
[42:26] as light as you possibly can
[42:28] to run the race that is set before you
[42:33] a couple of of quotes here that brother
[42:35] bran and i
[42:37] went through the message sirs we would
[42:39] see jesus
[42:41] some things that
[42:42] just caught my attention
[42:44] so bring that first quote up these next
[42:47] three quotes all be from the same
[42:48] message
[42:52] i think that's got the condition i think
[42:54] that's got the condition our church is
[42:56] getting into god shook every gift that
[42:59] he promised in the bible before us
[43:02] and we still stare in space now he was
[43:04] talking about that little boy the mother
[43:06] who had a little child and taken he had
[43:08] some kind of sickness with him and he'd
[43:10] taken him to the doctor and the doctor
[43:12] did some things he says i think he's
[43:13] well i think i see some progress in him
[43:16] so mom took him to a store and she took
[43:18] the different toys that should catch a
[43:20] child's attention and waved it in front
[43:22] of him and he had a blank look
[43:25] and it never caught his attention
[43:27] and she was crying and moaning because
[43:29] the doctor said something but she was
[43:31] seeing no evidence and this is what
[43:33] brother branham says he says we'll stare
[43:35] in space as we're looking for something
[43:37] else it seems to be a spiritual
[43:39] condition of the church that they fail
[43:41] to see the hour that they're living
[43:44] they are looking for some sensations or
[43:46] something that something way off in the
[43:49] future
[43:50] man is forever doing that he always
[43:53] blesses god for what he has done
[43:56] looking forward for what he will do and
[43:59] ignoring what he is doing
[44:02] you fail to see the hour that we're
[44:04] living
[44:06] that's what those greeks wanted to know
[44:08] that's the the hour was and what the
[44:11] messiah would be
[44:12] the portion of scripture that was made
[44:15] known for that day
[44:17] if the messiah fulfilled it that's the
[44:20] evidence
[44:21] the vindicated word of the hour is the
[44:24] evidence not that he had to have the
[44:25] fruits of the spirit he had to be a
[44:27] lawyer in the courts of justice for his
[44:30] or one of his pharisee or
[44:32] sadducee organizations
[44:34] he was the manifestation of god's
[44:37] promised word of that hour
[44:40] you want to see what the fruit of the
[44:42] spirit is watch what the bible promises
[44:44] for a certain hour then watch for that
[44:47] to be vindicated
[44:49] that's the evidence jesus said search
[44:51] the scriptures for in them you think you
[44:54] have eternal life
[44:55] they are they that testify me that's
[44:59] what proves who i am
[45:02] if god said it and it comes to pass you
[45:04] can say that's god
[45:07] if it i said and it fails you would say
[45:09] that's aaron
[45:11] you can't have that confidence in me
[45:13] because i cannot bring it to pass
[45:15] god has to do that but as a christian
[45:19] you put your faith
[45:22] your expectation
[45:24] your hope more than a hope
[45:26] in what god said
[45:29] not as what man says not what the
[45:30] government says
[45:32] because that can vary from day to day
[45:35] the government comes out with a law or
[45:37] something they want to do and you get
[45:39] all these people protesting these people
[45:40] pushing it becomes a big battle goes to
[45:43] the courts and it stays in the courts
[45:44] for years trying to
[45:46] make the decision what is going to be
[45:51] there that the next quote there
[45:53] and sarah tried to deny it
[45:57] we know this here's when when god when
[46:00] jehovah there he tells abraham you're
[46:02] going to have that child and sarah
[46:04] laughed
[46:06] but i like this portion here
[46:08] and being that she was part of abraham
[46:10] her unbelief would have condemned her
[46:13] but god could not take her cause she was
[46:17] part of abraham
[46:19] i'm so glad i'm a part of the family of
[46:22] god
[46:25] you have to recognize you're a part of
[46:27] the family of god
[46:30] you're doing no his doing
[46:33] your portion is to accept it believe it
[46:37] receive it
[46:38] say yes i am
[46:40] the church would have been condemned
[46:42] long ago but it's part of christ
[46:48] i'm so glad again i'm part of the family
[46:50] of god
[46:53] well we'll hold on to next quotes for a
[46:55] little bit later here
[47:00] so faith is a revelation
[47:03] it's unveiled to you it's made real
[47:07] um
[47:07] you know if you had
[47:09] we had christmas at the house and
[47:12] families were there our grandchildren my
[47:14] parents everybody and of course all the
[47:16] gifts are laid out and everything and
[47:19] the anticipation of what's in what's in
[47:21] the bag especially for the young ones
[47:23] and to watch them open the package and
[47:27] i just needed this i was hoping it was
[47:30] this you know
[47:33] well we knew what it was because we put
[47:35] it in the package
[47:37] or sometimes i say
[47:39] uh open the bag so i can see what we
[47:41] bought you because mama did and i really
[47:43] wasn't involved in it so he can see it
[47:47] but see he provided he met every need
[47:49] he's provided everything
[47:52] when you open the scriptures you're not
[47:54] surprising him
[47:57] you're opening the scriptures and
[47:58] they're saying lord and he goes i know
[48:00] that's why it's there
[48:03] for you to partake of for you to receive
[48:05] of for you to draw from that's why i had
[48:09] it put there so you can receive from it
[48:14] the the um
[48:17] i'm going to say it this way because
[48:18] that's what the squeal of emotion from
[48:20] chloe
[48:22] oh
[48:23] just what i wanted
[48:25] you know
[48:27] and it's fun
[48:28] it it
[48:29] enjoyment to see that
[48:31] but there should be that same joy in our
[48:34] hearts
[48:35] when we realize god has given us this
[48:38] god has met this god has fulfilled this
[48:41] yes lord i appreciate it and i love you
[48:43] for it
[48:44] you should have that same reaction
[48:48] he said so it was what
[48:52] but then here's the the interesting
[48:54] thing
[48:55] because it was chloe asher bianca ava
[48:59] and liam
[49:01] the young ones there
[49:03] and
[49:04] what did you get oh look at mine
[49:07] and the course of the two younger ones
[49:09] is oh i like kids i want to go play with
[49:11] his
[49:12] oh and i want to go grab that one and oh
[49:14] i want to go do this
[49:16] you know
[49:17] and and we're watching it and if we're
[49:19] not careful we have that same attitude
[49:21] lord it seems my brother is more blessed
[49:23] than i am it seems like he has a better
[49:26] gift than i do my no no take what god
[49:28] has given you and rejoice in that
[49:31] and appreciate it and let god use that
[49:33] not everybody's sins not everybody plays
[49:36] an instrument not ever but you have a
[49:38] part to play in and do do that part in
[49:41] rejoicing and watch how god would bless
[49:43] you
[49:45] but sarah here and here's the thought
[49:48] today
[49:50] does unbelief hinder god
[49:56] does it hinder god the answer to that is
[49:59] no
[50:00] a definite no but it does hinder you
[50:05] unbelief will not hinder god his plan
[50:08] and his purpose will accomplish his word
[50:10] will not return void
[50:12] that's what the scripture says
[50:14] therefore you can say lord i'm i'm
[50:16] hanging my eternal destination on what
[50:18] your word says
[50:22] romans chapter 3 verse 3.
[50:27] paul says this for what if some did not
[50:31] believe
[50:33] shall their unbelief make the faith of
[50:36] god without effect
[50:42] if my brother my sister my neighbor my
[50:44] friend does not believe
[50:46] i choose to believe
[50:50] i choose to stand on the word of god and
[50:52] say yes he's the same yesterday
[50:54] today and forever
[50:57] and as as i was reading through brother
[50:59] branham preaches that message
[51:03] where is it
[51:04] unbelief does not hinder god
[51:08] he's still going to fulfill his word
[51:11] but we're the ones that are hindered by
[51:13] our unbelief we're the ones that
[51:15] struggle through that
[51:17] but paul says if for if some did not did
[51:19] that hinder god it did not stop the plan
[51:22] of god
[51:23] it continues on
[51:26] hebrews 3 19.
[51:30] we hear again paul says
[51:34] 3 19 did i write 13
[51:37] i'm sorry i probably did
[51:39] but it's chapter 3 verse 19.
[51:42] so we see that they could not enter in
[51:45] because of unbelief
[51:48] now if faith is a revelation
[51:50] then unbelief is
[51:52] not a revelation
[51:54] it's got to be the opposite
[51:58] did god really mean that
[52:02] is that promise for today
[52:05] was that something just for brother
[52:07] branham
[52:08] was that something in the future or is
[52:11] god jesus christ the same yesterday
[52:12] today and forever
[52:15] they got to the cro the red sea now we
[52:18] we know these these we have the the
[52:20] privilege of reading the scriptures and
[52:22] seeing the account of it
[52:25] and we can stop in our attitude say why
[52:27] didn't they believe look at how because
[52:30] we've had the advantage of reading and
[52:31] seeing it
[52:33] but you're living everything today and
[52:35] sometimes you get into that same place
[52:37] lord where are you
[52:41] i i thought you would be here
[52:44] we wouldn't say it but at every beckon
[52:46] and every command that i give that you
[52:47] would just do it
[52:49] doesn't work that way
[52:52] he
[52:54] is the potter and i am the clay
[52:59] and he's got an image of you
[53:01] that he's already seen
[53:03] a finished vessel
[53:05] for the master's use
[53:08] but he didn't tell you how many years
[53:10] how much time it's going to take to get
[53:12] there he's got a purpose and a plan on
[53:14] it your in mind is to say yes lord i
[53:17] surrender
[53:19] he had promised them a deliverer
[53:22] and he sends moses
[53:25] to come deliver the children of israel
[53:27] because god keeps his word he had
[53:29] already prophesied that they were coming
[53:30] out of
[53:32] captivity and he sends moses down
[53:36] and with great wonders great signs
[53:39] to the point when israel leaves egypt
[53:42] the egyptians give them all
[53:44] the gifts and all
[53:46] you would have thought they would have
[53:47] said this is god
[53:50] but in a couple days they're in front of
[53:52] the red sea
[53:54] and boy they're being human again
[53:57] lord you brought us this far just to
[54:00] drown just to be destroyed just to be
[54:03] lord you're just like us then
[54:06] that's kind of what you're saying you're
[54:08] just like me i was really excited about
[54:11] this and i got this far now i'm down and
[54:13] disappointed
[54:16] but he just simply says to moses why cry
[54:19] speak
[54:20] did you not just do that a few days you
[54:22] spoke and there were flies you
[54:24] what has changed between here and then
[54:28] if anything you should have more
[54:29] confidence in him today than you had
[54:31] before because he's faithful
[54:34] he doesn't stop he doesn't quit he
[54:35] doesn't kick back and says all right
[54:37] you're on your own for the next couple
[54:38] of weeks
[54:40] he's with you he's always with you
[54:42] but they could not enter because of
[54:44] their unbelief they could let me just
[54:47] say that they could not see themselves
[54:48] on the other side
[54:51] they got to the end and said no it's too
[54:53] big it's too hard it's too great we
[54:55] can't do it
[54:58] the limits of our god ended right here
[55:00] at the jordan river
[55:02] he's not able to finish the job
[55:05] oh i would never say that brother and
[55:07] that's our attitude sometimes
[55:09] god where are you in this
[55:11] where are you in this
[55:14] matthew 17 verse 20
[55:18] and jesus said unto them because of your
[55:21] unbelief
[55:22] the disciples just asked him why had
[55:25] they not been able to cast out
[55:27] the demons out of this person
[55:29] and jesus does he said because of your
[55:32] unbelief and again
[55:35] if faith is a revelation then unbelief
[55:37] is not a revelation
[55:40] it hasn't been revealed or it has been
[55:42] but you've not accepted it
[55:45] because it's not maybe how you think or
[55:48] if you're not careful because you're not
[55:49] worthy of it
[55:51] when will you be worthy of it
[55:54] what's the the test the equivalent
[55:56] what's the number you have to reach
[55:58] before you're considered worthy
[56:02] that little woman who reached up and
[56:04] said if i can but touch the hem of his
[56:06] garment
[56:07] and she did it and she got what she
[56:09] needed
[56:11] and jesus didn't say now wait a minute
[56:13] wait a minute you can't have this
[56:18] he said somebody touched me they drew
[56:20] from me
[56:22] they took it by faith and they accepted
[56:24] it and they went and took that action to
[56:27] receive it
[56:30] now peter and the disciples around him
[56:32] are looking at him the ones that have
[56:33] seen this over and over and they look at
[56:36] him and say what's wrong with you you
[56:37] got your touch you're amongst thousands
[56:39] of people and somebody touched you
[56:42] and he has to look at him he says virtue
[56:44] has left me
[56:46] i know when somebody touches me i know
[56:49] the effect it has
[56:51] it says woman thy faith has saved thee
[56:54] the revelation that she got that if she
[56:56] could judge touch the hem of his
[56:58] garments she would receive
[57:00] what she had
[57:01] we've got to have that same attitude
[57:03] that same
[57:04] lord you said so therefore i'm going to
[57:06] take it
[57:09] you please him
[57:11] when you do that
[57:13] there's none of this
[57:14] that's not yours
[57:16] keep away
[57:17] no it's come
[57:20] come drink of this water freely come and
[57:22] feast come and jesus has a table spread
[57:25] where the saints of god are fed
[57:28] he invites his children
[57:30] he tells them if ye have faith as a
[57:32] grain of mustard seed you shall say unto
[57:35] this mountain
[57:37] and for so long i remember growing up
[57:39] thinking boy i wonder what big mountain
[57:41] they moved
[57:43] was it the tucson mountains no the
[57:45] mountain in your life
[57:46] the mountain that is before you the
[57:48] things that you can't seem to overcome
[57:50] that which is so hard that makes it so
[57:52] hard for you to walk in daily victory
[57:55] that's your mountain
[57:56] remove hands to yonder place
[58:00] remove from me and go bother that one no
[58:06] that's not what you're asking god to do
[58:08] get it out of the way let somebody else
[58:09] deal with it no just get it out
[58:11] completely let it not be a trouble
[58:12] anywhere
[58:14] and it shall remove
[58:18] that's god's word it shall remove and
[58:21] nothing shall be impossible unto you
[58:26] oh man that
[58:28] that's asking a lot lord
[58:30] well he said try me
[58:33] try me
[58:34] if you get to thinking sometimes i can't
[58:37] just go outside and look at nature for a
[58:39] little while
[58:40] watch the sunrise
[58:42] watch the moon come up watch the things
[58:44] that god has said that will never fail
[58:47] and remind yourself that's the god i
[58:49] serve
[58:51] he loves me he cares for me
[58:54] he did all this for me
[58:57] it's okay he did it all for all of us
[58:59] but we all can take it for ourselves
[59:03] then in mark 6 verses 5 and 6
[59:09] and he could do there
[59:11] he could there do no mighty work say
[59:13] that he laid his hands upon a few sick
[59:15] folk and healed them and he marveled
[59:19] because of their unbelief
[59:22] and he went around about the village's
[59:24] teaching he morally goes my
[59:27] was he was he was he surprised
[59:30] that's not what the word means
[59:33] he just says these people are not
[59:35] getting what they need
[59:37] because they just won't accept it just
[59:39] won't believe it
[59:41] now
[59:43] not accepting it unbelief isn't
[59:45] necessarily saying
[59:46] oh lord i just don't believe it
[59:52] really the issue is i'm not good enough
[59:55] that's not for me that's for another
[59:57] time that was for that age
[1:00:01] this is all of it for all of us
[1:00:06] is your name in the book
[1:00:07] it's yours
[1:00:10] it's yours
[1:00:12] what every promise in the book is mine
[1:00:14] every chapter every verse every line
[1:00:17] he marveled he says here they are
[1:00:20] starving i put food out before them and
[1:00:23] they refuse to eat
[1:00:25] and then they say i'm hungry
[1:00:30] we've done that before after mom would
[1:00:32] make meal but it wasn't really what we
[1:00:34] wanted and she said it would say eat
[1:00:37] but i don't want to eat that well that's
[1:00:39] if you're hungry eat
[1:00:42] lord you know what's best for me
[1:00:47] now brother branham says in the message
[1:00:52] unbelief does not hinder god we'll look
[1:00:55] at a couple of quotes there
[1:01:00] it doesn't hinder god it hinders you
[1:01:04] it doesn't slow him down it doesn't make
[1:01:05] him less effective
[1:01:08] as you're the one that has to deal with
[1:01:10] the unbelief
[1:01:11] you're the one that has to say lord help
[1:01:13] thou my unbelief
[1:01:15] remember the public in there and the
[1:01:17] priest the priest is there standing on
[1:01:18] his own righteousness standing on his
[1:01:21] works and telling god and this this is
[1:01:23] the parable that jesus uses telling god
[1:01:26] how worthy he is of the blessings
[1:01:29] because i came to church on sunday
[1:01:31] morning sunday evening i was on
[1:01:32] wednesday i heard two tapes today i did
[1:01:35] this i did that i
[1:01:37] gave him my whole list of what
[1:01:40] makes me worthy of it
[1:01:43] and he said when i see the blood i will
[1:01:47] pass over you
[1:01:49] and you have to accept that portion of
[1:01:52] it
[1:01:53] that's where faith takes hold
[1:01:55] he did it for me
[1:01:57] therefore i can come into his presence
[1:02:00] thinking of isaiah when isaiah comes in
[1:02:02] and he's isaiah was a good man
[1:02:05] had a wonderful testimony
[1:02:07] yet he comes into the presence of god
[1:02:09] and first thing he says woe is me
[1:02:12] but he bids us come
[1:02:15] you can come into his presence you must
[1:02:17] enter into the holy of holies today the
[1:02:20] curtain that has been rent has has been
[1:02:22] open for us to get in
[1:02:24] how through the shed blood
[1:02:26] through the sacrifice that he provided
[1:02:29] and let me say it this way you've got to
[1:02:32] come in the provided way for your day
[1:02:36] and today it's the word of god
[1:02:38] the whole word of god
[1:02:40] you can't leave any of it out
[1:02:42] every promise everything that god has
[1:02:44] said it's yours
[1:02:46] brother branham used to uh give this
[1:02:48] this example he said an arcade uh um a
[1:02:52] five and ten store maybe or
[1:02:55] i i remember some of those still
[1:02:58] where they had a little bit of
[1:02:59] everything
[1:03:01] and he says it's yours
[1:03:04] go in there and open every box open
[1:03:07] every door climb up on the shelves look
[1:03:09] to see what's in there that's yours
[1:03:13] and you have need of it take it accept
[1:03:16] it believe it
[1:03:19] and if we should have any revelation
[1:03:22] should be presented to us that's
[1:03:24] contrary to the written word
[1:03:26] then we should never receive it
[1:03:30] to the written word not somebody's idea
[1:03:33] of the word
[1:03:35] i stood outside
[1:03:37] across the street one day
[1:03:39] i needed to speak to a brother
[1:03:42] and there was another brother and they
[1:03:43] were across the street in the on the lot
[1:03:45] next door there
[1:03:47] and the one brother was standing there
[1:03:49] with his arms raised
[1:03:50] and as i approach he is just sharing his
[1:03:53] revelation
[1:03:54] to the other brother
[1:03:56] so i just waited for a few minutes while
[1:03:58] he finished
[1:04:00] and um
[1:04:02] i don't know what he was trying to say
[1:04:04] but obviously he thought the other
[1:04:06] brother needed to hear it
[1:04:08] and when he finished he opens his eyes
[1:04:10] and he sees me and he says so what do
[1:04:12] you think brother
[1:04:15] and sometimes it's best to be honest i
[1:04:17] think
[1:04:19] and this is all i said personally i
[1:04:20] think you're nuts
[1:04:23] that's how i answered him and he looked
[1:04:26] at me i said
[1:04:28] you just you're just sounding off on
[1:04:30] what you think things are
[1:04:32] turned to the brother said i'll talk to
[1:04:34] you
[1:04:35] later and i walked away
[1:04:37] that same brother
[1:04:39] sat here in our church
[1:04:42] his children with their hair cut
[1:04:43] earrings pants on
[1:04:46] and he said this statement brother jerry
[1:04:48] mcfadden to myself he said this
[1:04:50] statement
[1:04:51] you people dress this way and do this
[1:04:53] way because you're still bound
[1:04:56] we're so free and god today we can do
[1:04:58] anything we want
[1:05:03] i walked out we left
[1:05:06] went stopped by the am pm to get a drink
[1:05:08] on the way home and the brother was in
[1:05:09] the in the
[1:05:10] store
[1:05:12] and i kind of hesitated i don't think i
[1:05:14] want to go in there
[1:05:15] i just told him he was what i thought
[1:05:18] about him earlier that day
[1:05:20] that evening and then i go you know he's
[1:05:22] going to raise but i went in and sure
[1:05:24] enough soon he saw me he started wanting
[1:05:26] to preach to me in the store i said can
[1:05:28] you wait till we step outside you're
[1:05:29] causing a commotion
[1:05:31] he steps outside he starts telling me
[1:05:33] some things i just looked at him and
[1:05:34] said brother there was a day
[1:05:36] looking at you and your family there
[1:05:38] would be no question of anybody who
[1:05:41] would say
[1:05:42] there's a christian family
[1:05:45] but today you look just like them and
[1:05:47] you act just like them and they would
[1:05:49] never know you're a christian
[1:05:53] and he took his hand back and i said
[1:05:55] he's going to hit me
[1:05:57] so i left
[1:05:59] a couple things i learned my mama said
[1:06:00] if they're going to hit you run you know
[1:06:03] i did learn a few things
[1:06:06] but you know what we can get so caught
[1:06:08] up in our own idea and our own
[1:06:09] revelation
[1:06:11] it doesn't produce godliness
[1:06:14] it rep it produces pharisees and
[1:06:16] sadducees and people like that
[1:06:19] i thank my god i'm not like them
[1:06:23] and god is saying oh some i wish you'd
[1:06:25] have a little bit of their attitude
[1:06:26] sometimes
[1:06:28] i don't like dealing with that one
[1:06:30] he says if we would receive or is
[1:06:32] presented to us that is contrary to the
[1:06:35] written word then we should never
[1:06:36] receive it because that's exactly what
[1:06:39] satan did to eve she had the word
[1:06:43] but she was hunting for some new light
[1:06:46] and satan seen
[1:06:48] to it that she got it
[1:06:50] so we would never want to add anything
[1:06:52] to the word or take anything from the
[1:06:54] word but just leave it the way it is
[1:06:58] stay right with the word for anything
[1:07:00] contrary
[1:07:02] is unbelief
[1:07:04] or lack of revelation
[1:07:08] and unbelief manifests itself in many
[1:07:10] different ways
[1:07:12] it can a
[1:07:13] a manifest self in self-righteousness
[1:07:16] and then totally contrary to
[1:07:20] they're all wrong
[1:07:22] they all need cleansing they all need
[1:07:24] forgiveness they all need changing
[1:07:27] and if anything
[1:07:29] if you look at the scriptures and all
[1:07:31] the thing and brother branham even when
[1:07:33] he didn't think the thing that troubled
[1:07:35] him is a self-righteous spirit
[1:07:38] it's the hardest to deal with
[1:07:40] it's hard to deal with that in your own
[1:07:42] self
[1:07:43] you have to realize i've got to humble
[1:07:45] my heart before god
[1:07:47] i say lord it's not me it's you
[1:07:51] now
[1:07:52] a little while and the world seeth me no
[1:07:54] more brother braham says the unbeliever
[1:07:57] but you shall see me
[1:08:00] for i'll be with you
[1:08:01] even to the consummation to the end of
[1:08:03] all things the end of the time jesus
[1:08:06] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:08:08] forever
[1:08:09] if he lives won't he produce the same
[1:08:11] thing won't his life produce as it did
[1:08:15] if it's living in you
[1:08:20] if you plant a seed an orange tree seed
[1:08:23] it gives an orange tree
[1:08:26] if you take and plant the seed that you
[1:08:29] plant and you could expect something
[1:08:31] else out of it but it has to give out of
[1:08:34] the life that it has
[1:08:36] and by its fruits you'll know it
[1:08:40] you could have planted an apple seed
[1:08:42] believing it was an orange seed
[1:08:45] and you have an apple tree that grows
[1:08:47] and apples hanging the tree but you're
[1:08:48] telling everybody how do you like my
[1:08:50] orange tree
[1:08:53] oh i'd never get to that
[1:08:56] we won't we sure do sometimes
[1:08:59] hey i'm a christian just look at me
[1:09:03] somebody's looking if that's
[1:09:04] christianity i really don't want it
[1:09:08] the the thing that said about brother
[1:09:10] branham so often the humility the humble
[1:09:12] spirit the sweetness about him
[1:09:15] how he was willing to walk with a sinner
[1:09:18] put his arm around him
[1:09:21] not be contaminated but trying to give
[1:09:24] what he had to that one
[1:09:26] for greater is he that is in you than he
[1:09:29] that is in the world
[1:09:30] does that mean that i'm going to go get
[1:09:32] right into the midst of sin and live in
[1:09:34] it no
[1:09:36] but if i want to go reach someone and
[1:09:38] i've got to go i don't need to be afraid
[1:09:40] because greater is he that is in me than
[1:09:42] he that is in the world
[1:09:46] and he said i'll go with you i'll even
[1:09:48] be in you
[1:09:49] to the end of the world he says
[1:09:52] it will produce the same thing
[1:09:55] one more there
[1:10:00] unbelief never stopped him
[1:10:03] he just kept right on going he healed
[1:10:05] the sick raised the dead cleansed the
[1:10:07] lepers went right on
[1:10:09] and when they didn't believe such things
[1:10:12] could happen and their their unbelief
[1:10:14] did not stop jesus at all he went right
[1:10:18] on doing just what he was supposed to do
[1:10:21] never bothered him a bit
[1:10:25] i must go about my father's business
[1:10:29] and it didn't trouble he didn't say oh
[1:10:31] my what am i going to do now
[1:10:35] the one time
[1:10:37] the scriptures tell us
[1:10:39] that he got on his knees
[1:10:42] there at gethsemane and he asked the
[1:10:44] father
[1:10:45] is it possible to accomplish your will
[1:10:49] differently
[1:10:53] that really was
[1:10:56] the hardest decision
[1:10:59] to be willing to give it up and say not
[1:11:01] my will but i will
[1:11:04] he had set his face towards jerusalem
[1:11:07] knowing where he was going what he was
[1:11:09] going there for but it had to come to
[1:11:11] that place to say not my will but thy
[1:11:14] will be done
[1:11:17] do we have one more there
[1:11:20] no i believe that was the last one there
[1:11:23] unbelief does not hinder god it hinders
[1:11:26] us
[1:11:29] ask what you will
[1:11:32] with that with faith without wavering
[1:11:34] and it shall be
[1:11:38] yeah brother aaron it's it's it's hard
[1:11:39] i'm not saying it's easy
[1:11:42] i'm not saying it's just oh just you
[1:11:43] know it's an everyday thing
[1:11:46] there is some subject and there is some
[1:11:48] serenity there's some yielding there is
[1:11:49] some
[1:11:50] more to find the deeds of the flesh to
[1:11:52] get to this place
[1:11:56] to come to that point where because yes
[1:11:58] lord
[1:11:59] i have learned through the experiences
[1:12:01] of life and the times with you and
[1:12:03] everything that if i'll just say yes
[1:12:05] lord
[1:12:06] you'll bring to pass what you desire
[1:12:10] you didn't say i'd understand it all you
[1:12:13] didn't say i could figure it all you
[1:12:14] didn't even say that i would be happy
[1:12:16] about it all
[1:12:20] but there would be a peace that would
[1:12:21] come with him that god is in control
[1:12:28] we'll go to some more scriptures here
[1:12:34] in in revelations
[1:12:36] or romans we were going through here
[1:12:41] first timothy
[1:12:46] chapter one
[1:12:50] or paul writing here
[1:12:53] 12-14 he says watch what paul says here
[1:12:57] and i thank christ je
[1:12:59] i thank christ jesus our lord who have
[1:13:01] enabled me
[1:13:03] for that he counted me faithful putting
[1:13:06] me into the ministry
[1:13:08] who was before a blasphemer and a
[1:13:11] persecutor
[1:13:13] and injurious
[1:13:15] i did more harm than i did good thinking
[1:13:18] i was doing god a service
[1:13:20] and i cause more injury and more trouble
[1:13:23] and hurts
[1:13:24] he says
[1:13:26] but i obtained
[1:13:28] mercy
[1:13:30] because i did it ignorantly
[1:13:33] in unbelief
[1:13:35] thinking i was doing god a service
[1:13:40] he said in my unbelief
[1:13:42] of the
[1:13:43] reward revealed word for that day
[1:13:48] i obtain mercy paul looked back he
[1:13:51] realized he said i was doing these
[1:13:53] things thinking i was doing god a
[1:13:55] service thinking i was up to date with
[1:13:58] what god was doing that the law of moses
[1:14:00] was still in full effect
[1:14:05] he said but i obtained mercy
[1:14:08] because i did it in ignorance
[1:14:14] we are not an ignorant people today
[1:14:17] we know what the word of god is what he
[1:14:20] has said
[1:14:22] god has been merciful to us and has
[1:14:24] unveiled it and opened it
[1:14:27] we can't use this excuse lord i didn't
[1:14:30] know we do know
[1:14:32] but we can say lord help thou my
[1:14:34] unbelief
[1:14:35] help me to overcome help me to get past
[1:14:38] this if i got to go through the test let
[1:14:40] me go through the test again until i
[1:14:42] reach that point where i've passed that
[1:14:44] test
[1:14:46] not with a d-minus which is a passing
[1:14:49] grade but in full fulfillment of your
[1:14:52] word
[1:14:54] and the grace of our lord was exceeding
[1:14:57] abundant with faith and love which is in
[1:15:00] christ jesus the grace the unmerited
[1:15:03] favor of god
[1:15:06] lord you owe me grace no no no no he
[1:15:10] chose to do it
[1:15:12] whether i was worthy of it or not
[1:15:14] he said
[1:15:16] with faith
[1:15:17] and you know again if you take that word
[1:15:19] right now and just take it with a
[1:15:21] revelation when it becomes real to you
[1:15:23] when it's more than a hope
[1:15:27] we live a people of hope there's no
[1:15:29] question about it but it's got to go
[1:15:31] beyond hope
[1:15:33] i hope the lord will do this i hope that
[1:15:36] i'll be an overcomer i hope
[1:15:39] when is a hope going to take god at his
[1:15:41] word
[1:15:42] when is it going to be say i am not
[1:15:45] because i made myself but because he
[1:15:47] promised it and he lives in me
[1:15:52] i know that sometimes we'll we'll come
[1:15:54] home and we're hoping for this and it's
[1:15:56] not
[1:15:57] you know i hope this will be that or
[1:16:00] when i get to work or when when you get
[1:16:02] to the store i hope they have some today
[1:16:04] you know and and
[1:16:07] that's the human side of us i'm not
[1:16:08] saying it isn't
[1:16:10] but if you live by hope you're going to
[1:16:12] get you're going to get disappointed
[1:16:13] quite often
[1:16:16] quite often
[1:16:17] i hope i find it
[1:16:20] i left it somewhere i hope i find it
[1:16:24] brother green taught us this
[1:16:26] place it
[1:16:27] and go pick it up
[1:16:29] lord it's in your word therefore i can
[1:16:31] go to your word and receive it
[1:16:35] it's not in my works it's not in my
[1:16:37] thinking it's not in that it's in your
[1:16:39] word and your word never fails
[1:16:41] it's beyond a hope
[1:16:43] it becomes a revelation god said it
[1:16:46] therefore it is
[1:16:50] you're the lord god that healeth all my
[1:16:52] diseases
[1:16:54] therefore it does
[1:16:56] it doesn't fail
[1:16:59] now i'm not i'm not belittling anything
[1:17:01] or anybody honestly because i've got
[1:17:03] physical ailments in my body but he's
[1:17:05] the lord god that healeth me that's my
[1:17:07] testimony
[1:17:09] that's what i stand on
[1:17:11] you say well what if it doesn't happen
[1:17:13] in this body
[1:17:15] talk to him about it i know what his
[1:17:16] word says
[1:17:18] but i know that there is a body that is
[1:17:20] whole and complete
[1:17:23] because he said so
[1:17:24] sin won't enter in there unbelief won't
[1:17:27] enter there sickness won't be there
[1:17:30] but he's given us a taste of that
[1:17:32] already in healing
[1:17:36] let's go to romans
[1:17:42] we hit a little bit of this last sunday
[1:17:46] we'll read 4 16 and then 18-25
[1:17:49] therefore it is of faith
[1:17:53] that it might be by grace
[1:17:58] now the the faith is not something you
[1:18:00] earn it's not something you work up to
[1:18:02] it's not not something you battle for
[1:18:06] it's by the grace of god
[1:18:10] paul realized that because he just said
[1:18:12] here he says i did it ignorantly but by
[1:18:14] the grace of god
[1:18:16] by his choosing by his mercy i am who i
[1:18:19] am today he says
[1:18:22] to the end that
[1:18:23] to to the end the promise might be sure
[1:18:26] to all the seed
[1:18:28] and i just question you are you a child
[1:18:30] of god
[1:18:33] anybody
[1:18:34] am i i am a child of god
[1:18:37] because i made myself a child of god no
[1:18:41] because he knew me before the foundation
[1:18:43] of the world
[1:18:44] he says
[1:18:46] not to that only which is of the law
[1:18:50] but to that also which is of the faith
[1:18:53] of abraham who is the father of us all
[1:18:56] the father of faith
[1:19:00] not to the natural seed but to the
[1:19:02] spiritual seed
[1:19:05] paul begins to unveil this
[1:19:08] he said i thought i was doing this
[1:19:10] because i thought it was part of the law
[1:19:12] but i realized he goes no it's to the
[1:19:14] faith seat of abraham
[1:19:16] this gospel
[1:19:18] he had turned his eyes from
[1:19:20] israel like joseph who put his wife
[1:19:24] aside so he could redeem his brothers
[1:19:26] but he had married
[1:19:28] a
[1:19:29] someone outside of the jewish family
[1:19:32] because god rich in mercy reached down
[1:19:34] to a gentile people you and i and
[1:19:36] extended his love and mercy to us
[1:19:40] he says
[1:19:41] be but to that also which is of the
[1:19:44] faith of abraham
[1:19:46] who is the father to what how god dealt
[1:19:49] with abraham was by revelation
[1:19:53] they go back to the beginning how abel
[1:19:55] pleased god by revelation
[1:19:58] and cain did not please god because cain
[1:20:00] tried it by works
[1:20:02] but you and i can look at it and works
[1:20:04] usually looks prettier than faith
[1:20:08] a lot of effort a lot of try god has to
[1:20:11] be pleased with this i've given my all
[1:20:13] for this
[1:20:17] but that doesn't please god you give
[1:20:19] your all for him because you love him
[1:20:22] not to try to get
[1:20:23] points from god
[1:20:25] it is by grace it is by faith
[1:20:29] then we'll go from verse 18.
[1:20:33] who against hope
[1:20:34] believed in hope
[1:20:36] that he might become the father of many
[1:20:39] nations according to that which was
[1:20:41] spoken
[1:20:42] so shall thy seed be speaking of abraham
[1:20:45] here who against hope believed in hope
[1:20:49] but it had to become a revelation
[1:20:53] to abraham
[1:20:54] we know the story of abraham you can
[1:20:56] read it through the book of genesis and
[1:20:57] going through and the many many
[1:20:59] instances are referred to in the
[1:21:01] scriptures
[1:21:03] abraham listened to sarah when she said
[1:21:06] go to my handmaid and maybe this is what
[1:21:08] god meant
[1:21:10] brother branham says it this way every
[1:21:12] day he would ask sarah how you feeling
[1:21:14] sarah
[1:21:15] and sarah i say no different in fact i'm
[1:21:17] getting older i just had another
[1:21:19] birthday abraham
[1:21:20] i'm i'm closer to this side than i was
[1:21:23] to that side
[1:21:24] and and brother bam says but abraham was
[1:21:26] saying praise god we're going to have it
[1:21:28] anyhow
[1:21:30] the scripture says abraham staggered not
[1:21:32] at the promise of god
[1:21:35] it also says that he went to
[1:21:37] and had a child from
[1:21:39] god knew that
[1:21:41] god didn't scratch and said what do i do
[1:21:43] now
[1:21:44] it was all part of what god's plans were
[1:21:47] i love that the scripture shows both
[1:21:48] sides of the story
[1:21:51] or we'd have this image of how unperfect
[1:21:53] we are and how perfect they were and
[1:21:55] we'll never reach that
[1:21:57] i love that brother branham would tell
[1:21:59] things about himself in this message his
[1:22:01] failures and everything did not elevate
[1:22:04] himself above
[1:22:05] humans
[1:22:06] i'm better than you you got to be like
[1:22:08] me no he would talk about the grace of
[1:22:10] god in his life talked about his
[1:22:13] upbringing and all
[1:22:15] if we're looking at ourselves we're no
[1:22:17] better than anybody
[1:22:20] but if you look at with the word and you
[1:22:22] take that for you then you have the king
[1:22:24] of kings and lord of lords on your side
[1:22:28] more than all the battalions and the
[1:22:30] armies of this world way more than that
[1:22:33] one that can do
[1:22:35] is head over all of that
[1:22:37] he's my lord
[1:22:38] there is no other
[1:22:40] he is my father he knows me by name
[1:22:44] he talks to me we we walk together we
[1:22:46] adam adam eve come on let's
[1:22:49] what a time
[1:22:51] i don't know if he ever stopped and just
[1:22:53] said how was it with her what was it
[1:22:55] like to be in the garden
[1:22:58] perfect temperature everything just
[1:22:59] right just
[1:23:01] you're already kind of going like uh
[1:23:03] yeah because we don't really know that
[1:23:05] yet but it was though
[1:23:09] until
[1:23:10] unbelief got in there
[1:23:14] next verse
[1:23:17] and being not weak in faith
[1:23:20] and again i'm taking i'm taking the word
[1:23:23] revelation putting it in there
[1:23:26] standing
[1:23:28] in the revelation of what god said
[1:23:31] not looking at yourself but what god
[1:23:34] said
[1:23:37] god says i am well
[1:23:39] god says i am whole
[1:23:41] god says i am saved god says i'm pure
[1:23:45] god says i'm clean.
[1:23:48] therefore i'm going to stand on it
[1:23:52] he considered not his own body now dead
[1:23:55] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:23:57] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:24:02] i wonder if the bible doesn't tell us
[1:24:04] but when friends would come by people
[1:24:06] would come by
[1:24:09] his place there i'm sure after a while
[1:24:11] everybody knew that's abraham over there
[1:24:14] walk through it go through it
[1:24:16] and abraham had come by maybe
[1:24:19] maybe some people that would go to this
[1:24:20] part of the country and then come back
[1:24:22] on the way maybe they spent the night
[1:24:23] there they rested there abraham how's it
[1:24:26] going he goes the last time i hear you
[1:24:27] told me you and sarah were going to have
[1:24:29] a child how's sarah doing
[1:24:31] sarah comes out looks so different
[1:24:34] she looks a little bit older maybe a
[1:24:35] little bit more loud
[1:24:38] abraham staggered not at the promise of
[1:24:40] god
[1:24:41] next year when you come by we're going
[1:24:43] to be holding this little baby of horse
[1:24:46] next year they came by
[1:24:48] and abraham was a year older in serbs
[1:24:50] but he staggered not at the promise of
[1:24:52] god
[1:24:58] you have to stand that same place
[1:25:01] lord i'm not looking at myself
[1:25:03] i'm not looking at the deadness of this
[1:25:05] body i'm looking at what your promise
[1:25:07] says
[1:25:08] and we'll stand on that
[1:25:11] let's go on
[1:25:14] verse 20.
[1:25:15] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:25:17] through unbelief he did not deny the
[1:25:20] revelation that god gave him
[1:25:25] he never said lord you must have been
[1:25:28] wrong
[1:25:29] i misunderstood i'm not too sure
[1:25:32] if this really works
[1:25:38] hey he was human he was flesh
[1:25:41] so are you so and i but i want to stay
[1:25:44] true to the word of god
[1:25:47] but was strong in faith
[1:25:49] giving glory to god
[1:25:51] and being fairly fully persuaded that
[1:25:55] what he had promised he was able also to
[1:26:00] perform
[1:26:02] when you get to thinking and feeling a
[1:26:04] little bit like god are you able
[1:26:07] go out and look what he said the sun
[1:26:09] will rise and set
[1:26:11] and it has
[1:26:13] since
[1:26:14] it was created
[1:26:17] begin to see what god has done look back
[1:26:20] at your own life and see what god has
[1:26:22] done for you
[1:26:24] that's the best evidence to yourself
[1:26:26] lord that was you lord that was you lord
[1:26:29] that was you i'm here today because that
[1:26:31] was you
[1:26:33] and you stand on that
[1:26:34] that's what abraham was doing he
[1:26:35] staggered not at the promise of god
[1:26:39] brother aaron you weren't there you
[1:26:40] didn't see whether he staggered or not
[1:26:42] i'm going to take what god's word said
[1:26:44] because that's how i have to apply it to
[1:26:46] my life
[1:26:48] you know lord now i lay me down to sleep
[1:26:54] you know a simple
[1:26:55] good night prayer i'm going to bed
[1:26:58] and we laugh about it
[1:27:01] sometimes there's some people won't even
[1:27:02] do that
[1:27:07] could you do at least a little bit that
[1:27:09] much get started
[1:27:13] it's the end of the day i'm so tired and
[1:27:14] weird i just cast myself and i go to
[1:27:16] sleep and i don't even talk to him don't
[1:27:17] even
[1:27:19] how about just the simplicity of taking
[1:27:20] god at his word
[1:27:24] verse 21 22
[1:27:27] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[1:27:30] righteousness
[1:27:32] have you considered my servant job
[1:27:38] why because job laid a sacrifice every
[1:27:41] morning
[1:27:42] and god looked at the sacrifice
[1:27:47] and he tells
[1:27:48] satan have you considered my servant job
[1:27:51] there is nobody like him he's perfect
[1:27:54] he's complete he's whole
[1:27:57] and saying goes give me a chance adam
[1:27:59] we'll see what we can do
[1:28:02] god would not have said that about job
[1:28:04] to satan if he knew job couldn't stand
[1:28:08] and god would not say that to you about
[1:28:10] you or to anybody else about you because
[1:28:13] he knows you will stand
[1:28:15] because he's in you
[1:28:18] he says
[1:28:19] now it was not written
[1:28:24] for his sake alone that it was imputed
[1:28:26] to him
[1:28:28] it's going
[1:28:30] but for us also to whom it shall be
[1:28:33] imputed if we believe on him that raise
[1:28:36] up jesus christ
[1:28:38] our lord from the dead who was delivered
[1:28:40] for our offenses and was raised again
[1:28:43] for our justification
[1:28:46] if we believe
[1:28:48] if you realize your name was on that
[1:28:50] book
[1:28:52] he knew me yet he loved me
[1:28:55] he whose glory makes the heavens shine
[1:28:58] i'm so unworthy i'm not standing here in
[1:29:00] my own i'm standing on what he said
[1:29:04] go to my house or sit down with my girls
[1:29:06] and my wife and they can tell things
[1:29:08] about
[1:29:08] me yeah dad said this and this but dad
[1:29:11] did this and this
[1:29:13] dad promised when we were
[1:29:15] but this didn't happen hey i understand
[1:29:17] that
[1:29:18] but god's word never fails
[1:29:22] a host of heavenly witnesses could come
[1:29:25] back to dante no his word does not fail
[1:29:30] and and paul says that in hebrews there
[1:29:33] is a host of heavenly beckoning us on he
[1:29:35] is faithful he is true he does not fail
[1:29:39] consider that set aside everything else
[1:29:43] that so does easily beset you and you
[1:29:46] know who besets me the most
[1:29:48] it's not her it's not them it's me
[1:29:52] set that one aside
[1:29:55] he's the one that gives me all my
[1:29:57] problems
[1:29:59] i praise i'm not giving you the problems
[1:30:02] but me
[1:30:04] saying lord help bow my unbelief
[1:30:06] lord give me strength let me realize let
[1:30:08] me have that revelation that you're with
[1:30:10] me you'll never leave me you'll never
[1:30:12] forsake me
[1:30:13] that which you have said about me will
[1:30:15] come to pass
[1:30:19] again who was delivered for offenses
[1:30:22] and ways was raised up again for our
[1:30:25] justification
[1:30:26] just as you had never done it
[1:30:31] that's kind of hard to to because in our
[1:30:34] memories we'll go back
[1:30:37] we'll go back but lord i failed you here
[1:30:40] lord i failed you here lord i did this i
[1:30:42] got upset again i did this again i did
[1:30:45] that again
[1:30:46] but he was raised for our justification
[1:30:49] brother juan would sing that psalm for
[1:30:51] us
[1:30:52] justified i've really never done it in
[1:30:54] the first place
[1:30:57] oh in your mind you did
[1:31:00] but if you take it to god and he brings
[1:31:02] up the screen the screen is blank
[1:31:07] he became me
[1:31:09] so that i through faith could become him
[1:31:13] not my own righteousness but what he's
[1:31:15] done
[1:31:16] what he did
[1:31:18] faith is a revelation
[1:31:21] faith is when it becomes real to you and
[1:31:23] you can stand on it
[1:31:25] though god slay me yet i will trust him
[1:31:28] with these eyes i shall behold him
[1:31:33] can you say that same thing today
[1:31:36] can you honestly say that same thing to
[1:31:38] you
[1:31:40] can you believe what you're saying
[1:31:43] god your word says that therefore you
[1:31:45] saw me there already and i'll stand on
[1:31:47] that and i'll believe that the musicians
[1:31:49] would come
[1:31:54] open my eyes lord i want to see jesus
[1:31:58] open my eyes to what your word says
[1:32:03] open the eyes of my heart lord let it
[1:32:05] receive
[1:32:08] let it become you are what you eat
[1:32:12] as you eat the nutritious food of his
[1:32:14] word it begins to build the word of god
[1:32:17] inside of you
[1:32:19] when you feast on the nutritious
[1:32:21] unnutritious food of your thoughts and
[1:32:22] feelings sometimes it begins to destroy
[1:32:25] you
[1:32:26] but when you take god at his word you
[1:32:28] say yes lord i believe
[1:32:30] and sometimes help my unbelief
[1:32:34] lord we
[1:32:38] they can just be words
[1:32:41] but words do have an effect
[1:32:44] you chose to use words
[1:32:48] you could have just used
[1:32:50] pictures and
[1:32:52] reveal things out in the sky for us to
[1:32:54] see and all and you've done many things
[1:32:56] like that
