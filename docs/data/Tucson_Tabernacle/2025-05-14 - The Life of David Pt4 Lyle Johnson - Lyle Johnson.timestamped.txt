[0:00] is yours with
[0:03] praise. I will say his name that the
[0:08] Lord have made. I will rejoice for he

[0:48] glad. He has made me glad. Yes, he has
[0:52] made me glad. I will rejoice for he has
[0:57] made me
[1:00] glad. When he makes you glad, that's an
[1:02] eternal glad. It's not just good for one
[1:05] day. Amen. It's good to be in the house
[1:07] of the Lord this this
[1:10] [Music]
[1:11] evening. We uh trust in his goodness and
[1:15] his grace, you know, but it's no secret
[1:18] of what God can do. It shouldn't be a
[1:20] secret to us. We should be we should
[1:22] have such a relationship with
[1:24] him and and that it's not a surprise
[1:28] when he comes down in the cool of the
[1:29] evening and he wants to fellowship with
[1:31] us. Amen.
[1:33] There's no
[1:38] secret what God can
[1:44] do. What he's done for
[1:49] us, he'll do for you.
[1:56] With arms wide
[2:00] open, he'll pardon
[2:06] you. It is no
[2:11] secret what God can do. One more time.
[2:18] It is no
[2:22] secret what God can
[2:27] do. What he's done for
[2:32] us, he will do for you.
[2:39] With arms wide
[2:43] open, he'll pardon
[2:48] you. It is no
[2:53] secret what God just couldn't play that
[2:57] one more time as I was singing that
[2:58] song. It is no secret what God can do.
[3:03] It should be manifested in your life. It
[3:06] should be advertised through your life
[3:09] what God can do. I used to be this but
[3:12] by the grace of God today on this. I
[3:15] used to have this. I used to go but by
[3:17] the grace of God and you should be able
[3:19] to share with what he did for you. He
[3:22] can do for
[3:26] someone. He'll pardon you.
[3:32] It is no
[3:36] secret. Let's just sing that one more
[3:42] time. It is no
[3:47] secret what God can do.
[3:53] What he's done for
[3:57] us, he'll do for
[4:02] you. With arms wide
[4:07] open, he'll pardon
[4:13] you. It is so
[4:18] seeking what God can do.

[9:05] [Music]
[9:10] Sister Amelia says, "Thank the
[9:12] Lord. All is well. Not doesn't have to
[9:15] have the knee replacement done. After
[9:18] all,
[9:22] they are grateful that the doctors and
[9:26] all the different ones can help and do
[9:27] what they do, but there ain't nobody
[9:30] that can do what he can do." You know,
[9:33] you can be without you can be missing a
[9:34] body part and he can he can cause that
[9:36] thing to he can make it
[9:38] whole. You could be three three days in
[9:41] the tomb and he'll say come forth like
[9:45] he did with Lazarus like he did himself.
[9:47] Lord, what a blessing to get to know
[9:49] him. Amen. We appreciate his goodness.
[9:53] If you do have a prayer request,
[9:54] something before the
[9:57] Lord, Lord, you know what this need is.
[9:59] You know what my heart is. And sometimes
[10:00] you you don't have the words, you know,
[10:02] but there's something there,
[10:04] Lord. So, as as we bow our heads and
[10:08] just bring that need and and you know,
[10:10] maybe today you don't have a need, but
[10:12] consider someone else. Say, Lord, my
[10:14] friend, my family, somebody could use.
[10:17] Let's just bow our heads. Lord, we we
[10:20] just sing this song. Great is thy
[10:22] faithfulness. Lord, there's no shadow of
[10:25] turning in you, Lord.
[10:27] You never had to stop and say, "Let me
[10:29] reconsider this. Let me look at it from
[10:31] a different angle. Let me study it some
[10:33] and see what we can do about this, Lord,
[10:35] but it's already been provided." When
[10:38] you cried out, "It is
[10:40] finished." Lord, you knew everything had
[10:43] come to be fulfilled, Lord. Every
[10:45] promise, Lord, you saw each hand raised,
[10:48] Lord. You You know that those may be
[10:50] listening in this evening, Lord, and
[10:52] have a need. Lord, would you minister to
[10:55] them personally, Lord? Would you go and
[10:56] let them realize, Lord, that you're
[10:58] mindful of them, Lord, in whatever that
[11:00] need is. And as brother Lyall prepares
[11:02] to minister this evening, Lord, may you
[11:05] just give them that assurance even right
[11:07] now, Lord. As we appreciate your
[11:10] goodness in your grace, Lord, in Jesus
[11:12] Christ's
[11:13] name. Brother Jordan has a a song
[11:17] special and I think something he wanted
[11:19] to
[11:20] share and he mentioned that
[11:24] yesterday. And let's just sing as he
[11:26] they're getting ready. Greater than all
[11:27] my
[11:28] [Music]
[11:30] sin. Greater than
[11:33] all my sin is the blood that still
[11:39] [Music]
[11:42] cleanses. Is the grace that still
[11:46] set me free.
[11:51] to praise
[11:52] [Music]
[11:55] him. I know the
[11:58] blood of
[12:00] light. Walking in
[12:04] newness of
[12:06] love. I cannot fall is greater than all.
[12:13] The blood of the lamb. Just one more
[12:15] time.
[12:19] Greater than all my sins is the blood
[12:25] that still
[12:27] cleanses
[12:29] me. Grace that still sets me
[12:35] free to praise him.
[12:38] [Music]
[12:41] I know the blood
[12:45] of walking in
[12:49] newness of
[12:51] love. I cannot fall straighter than all
[12:57] the blood of the
[13:00] [Music]
[13:04] lamb. Amen. I guess I should spe clarify
[13:08] a little bit. I wouldn't consider it a
[13:09] special song. We could call it a
[13:11] congregational special. About a year
[13:13] ago, I told brother Daniel, I said,
[13:14] "I've got a lot on my plate with things
[13:16] and I don't need to necessarily song
[13:19] lead unless, you know, there's a need
[13:21] and I need to be a help in that
[13:23] regards." And so, but occasionally I
[13:25] have a song that's on my heart and it's
[13:27] not to so much sing it as a song
[13:28] special, but to sing it as
[13:30] congregational. So, if you know these
[13:31] songs, feel free to join in.
[13:35] [Music]
[13:40] Oh, we shall see the
[13:43] king. We shall see the
[13:46] king. We shall see the king when he
[13:51] comes. He's coming in power. Oh, hail
[13:56] the blessed
[13:58] hour. We shall see the king when he
[14:01] comes.
[14:04] There's a blessed time that's coming
[14:07] coming
[14:09] soon. It may be evening, morning, or at
[14:15] noon. The wedding of the
[14:18] bride, united with the
[14:21] groom. We shall see the king when he
[14:27] comes. Oh, we shall see the king.
[14:31] We shall see the
[14:33] king. We shall see the king when he
[14:39] comes. He's coming in power. Oh, hell
[14:44] the blessed
[14:45] hour. We shall see the king when he
[14:50] comes. Are you ready? Should the savior
[14:54] call
[14:56] today? Would Jesus say, "Well done." Or
[15:00] go
[15:02] away. My home is for the pure. The vile
[15:07] can never
[15:08] stay. We shall see the king when he
[15:13] comes. Oh, we shall see the
[15:17] king. We shall see the
[15:20] king. We shall see the king when he
[15:24] comes. comes. He's coming in power. All
[15:30] hell the blessed hour. We shall see the
[15:34] king when he
[15:37] comes. Oh my brother, are you ready for
[15:41] that
[15:43] call to crown your savior, king, and
[15:46] lord of all?
[15:50] The kingdoms of this world shall soon be
[15:53] before him
[15:55] fall. I shall see the king when he
[16:00] comes. Oh, we shall see the
[16:03] king. We shall see the
[16:06] king. We shall see the king when he
[16:12] comes. He's coming in power. All hell
[16:17] blessed hour.
[16:19] We shall see the king when he
[16:28] comes.
[16:30] Amen. As brother Jordan was singing that
[16:33] song, I was just thinking, we shall say
[16:34] the king. And right now when the king is
[16:38] crowned, there's just so many people all
[16:40] around looking at him. But really, how
[16:42] many of them know the king?
[16:45] They know who the king is. The king
[16:47] looks over them, but that's about they
[16:50] give. But do you know the king? Do you
[16:53] know his name on that day? He's going to
[16:55] call you by name because you're precious
[16:58] in his sight. Just a thought that came
[17:00] to me. Can you imagine be before the
[17:02] King of Kings and he calls you, "Hey,
[17:04] Daniel, I know. Come on over. Brother
[17:07] Josiah, come on over. Sister Terry, just
[17:10] come on over. He's going to call you by
[17:11] name." What a wonderful thing. Amen.
[17:15] Amen. Brother Lyall prepares to come
[17:19] here. Let's just do that. We shall see
[17:22] the
[17:23] [Music]
[17:26] king. We shall see the
[17:29] king. We shall see the
[17:32] king. We shall see the king. When he
[17:37] comes, he's coming in power. All hail
[17:42] the blessed
[17:43] hour. We shall see the king when he
[17:49] comes. I shall see the king. Yes, I
[17:54] shall see the
[17:55] king. I shall see the king when he's
[18:01] come. Coming in power. I'll hail the
[18:06] blessed hour. I shall see the king.
[18:10] Let's
[18:12] stand. Oh, I shall see the
[18:16] king. I shall
[18:19] see. I shall see the king when he
[18:24] [Music]
[18:27] comes. Oh, hail the blessed
[18:30] hour. I shall see the king when he
[18:35] comes. and I'm gonna see him when you
[18:38] see him because we're going to see him
[18:42] together. Thank you so much and good
[18:47] evening. Uh just a reminder, a handout
[18:50] of the scriptures and so forth tonight
[18:52] are at the booth in the back. And uh if
[18:56] if anybody walks through the parking lot
[18:58] and sees a broken mirror on the side of
[19:00] our car, we were driving down from
[19:02] Phoenix after a graduation of our
[19:04] granddaughter from ASU.
[19:07] And yeah, and and and I think a wild cat
[19:12] left a left a rubber mat on the highway
[19:14] and the car in front of us kicked it up
[19:16] and it smacked against our car and and
[19:19] uh took the mirror cover off and oh
[19:22] well. So, we went to the place today to
[19:25] make an arrangement to get it fixed. So,
[19:26] in the meantime, if you see the the
[19:29] internals of the thing all exposed
[19:30] there, it's okay. I know about it. It
[19:32] didn't happen in the parking lot. You
[19:35] may recall the last time we met about
[19:38] David. It was the 5th of IR on the
[19:40] Hebrew calendar, which is celebrated as
[19:42] Israel's Independence Day, Yoma Atzma,
[19:45] the 77th anniversary of the date in 1948
[19:49] that the modern nation of Israel was
[19:51] declared. and within minutes formally
[19:53] recognized by the United States under
[19:55] President Harry Truman. Tonight is also
[19:59] the 77th anniversary of the date in 1948
[20:02] that the modern nation of Israel was
[20:03] declared and within minutes formally
[20:06] recognized by the United States under
[20:08] President Harry
[20:09] Truman. Brother Lyle, what are you
[20:12] talking about? The Hebrew calendar is
[20:14] lunar. Our calendar is solar. we put in
[20:17] a a leap day every four years to kind of
[20:20] keep things synchronized with the
[20:21] seasons. Well, when you have a lunar
[20:23] calendar, that doesn't work. So, the
[20:24] Hebrew calendar inserts a leap month uh
[20:28] roughly seven times every 19 years to
[20:30] get things back in synchronization. So,
[20:32] two weeks ago, April the 30th of 2025
[20:35] was the 5th of IR, but in 1948, the 5th
[20:38] of IR began the evening of May 14th.
[20:42] Tonight, we meet on May 14th. So again,
[20:44] happy birthday, Israel. And why do you
[20:47] I'm sure some of the kids in the
[20:49] audience tonight are listening very
[20:50] closely because they're thinking, "If I
[20:53] can find out the Hebrew calendar date
[20:54] when I was born, I can have two birthday
[20:57] parties every year." Cool. Thanks,
[21:00] brother Lyall. I'm sure your parents
[21:02] won't thank me, but you can thank me.
[21:04] Enough about calendars. Tonight, we
[21:07] continue to explore the life of David in
[21:09] the years before he became king. As we
[21:12] begin our study tonight, let's join
[21:13] together once more in
[21:15] prayer. Lord
[21:18] Jesus, it's an honor and a
[21:20] responsibility to stand here in the
[21:22] midst of people that you gave your
[21:24] life's blood for. Lord, even when we
[21:27] were just your enemies, we didn't know
[21:30] you. We didn't know about you. We didn't
[21:31] care. But Lord, you came and paid the
[21:34] price for each one of us. And Lord, to
[21:36] stand in this group is just such an
[21:39] awesome honor. Lord, I just pray that
[21:41] you'd forgive us each, Lord, of uh sins,
[21:43] the cares of this world. We can just set
[21:45] them aside. And Lord, we can just enter
[21:48] into a spirit of fellowship and worship
[21:50] and love with you. Lord, we thank you
[21:53] for your word. Please be with us. Please
[21:56] continue to be with us. And Lord, just
[21:58] help this Rascal Liyle Johnson to not
[22:00] get in your way. We thank you in Jesus
[22:03] name. Amen.
[22:07] While we're standing and for our opening
[22:10] verses, I'd like to read from Psalm 138.
[22:14] It's not tied to any specific event or
[22:17] period in David's life, but it fits the
[22:19] current time of his life as we're
[22:25] studying. It begins, I will. I will.
[22:29] It's my desire. It's my intent. I want
[22:33] to praise thee with my whole heart
[22:36] before the gods. In other words, not to
[22:38] idols. I will sing praise unto thee. I
[22:41] will worship toward thy holy temple.
[22:44] Many psalms talk about this. Psalms of
[22:46] David. The temple didn't exist in
[22:48] David's day. Solomon's temple was built
[22:50] after David was deceased. So, he's
[22:52] talking about something else when he's
[22:54] talking about the temple.
[22:57] I think David realized that God was not
[23:00] contained in an ark or limited to his
[23:03] special sight or had to be in this
[23:05] particular tent or tabernacle. David
[23:07] often spoke of the house of God and
[23:10] praised thy name for thy loving kindness
[23:13] and for thy truth. Recall these
[23:16] attributes which the Lord proclaimed in
[23:18] Exodus 34 6 and 7 which we examined in
[23:22] part two. For thou hast magnified thy
[23:25] word above all thy name. In the day when
[23:30] I cried, you answered me and
[23:32] strengthened me with strength in my
[23:34] soul. You encouraged me, replacing
[23:37] despair with hope and
[23:39] confidence. All the kings of the earth
[23:42] shall praise thee, oh God, when they
[23:43] hear the words of thy mouth. Yay, they
[23:45] shall sing in the ways of the Lord, for
[23:48] great is the glory of the Lord.
[23:51] prophetic words we long to see that day
[23:54] come. Though the Lord be high, yet hath
[23:58] he respect unto the lowly, the humble,
[24:02] the meek, us. But the proud, the
[24:06] arrogant, the self-sufficient, he
[24:09] knoweth a far off, the NLT says he keeps
[24:12] his distance from the proud. Though I
[24:15] walk in the midst of, though I am
[24:17] surrounded by trouble, thou will revive
[24:20] me. You'll keep me alive. Thou shalt
[24:22] stretch forth thine hand against the
[24:25] wrath of mine enemies, and thy right
[24:28] hand shall save, will deliver me. David
[24:32] did not rely on his own strength, his
[24:35] own ability. Neither did he deny his
[24:39] strength or his abilities, but he
[24:40] depended on the Lord and recognized the
[24:44] source of his gifts.
[24:46] The Lord will perfect, will complete,
[24:49] will fulfill that which concerns me. Thy
[24:52] mercy, O Lord, endureth till the end of
[24:55] the service. No, endureth
[24:58] forever. Forsake not the works of thine
[25:01] own hands. Don't abandon me. Please be
[25:08] seated. This evening, we'll be reading a
[25:11] lot from the book of First Samuel. My
[25:14] hope is that we'll be able to complete
[25:16] our look at David's formative years
[25:18] before he became king. We've already
[25:20] established the context of the times in
[25:22] which David lived. So this evening,
[25:25] we'll add a few maps where it's
[25:27] appropriate. We ended uh last time in
[25:31] part three, we started with David being
[25:33] alone in a cave in
[25:36] Adelum. He was alone. We read a psalm he
[25:40] wrote at that time showing his feeling
[25:42] of
[25:43] abandonment. We ended last time with
[25:46] David and his men rescuing the
[25:48] inhabitants of Kela from the Philistines
[25:50] then fleeing to
[25:52] Ma. Saul heard about David being in Ma
[25:55] and took some portion of his army to
[25:57] pursue David. And just about the time he
[26:01] had David surrounded to take him, we
[26:04] read in 1st Samuel 23, there came a
[26:06] messenger under Saul saying, "Hasty,
[26:09] come. The Philistines have invaded the
[26:12] land." Remember, it was the time of
[26:15] harvest. Philistines were trying to
[26:17] weaken their enemy by taking the grain
[26:19] among other things. Saul should have
[26:21] been protecting his borders, not chasing
[26:24] David.
[26:26] Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing
[26:28] after David and went against the
[26:30] Philistines. Therefore they called that
[26:32] place Sahamak Lot, rock of the
[26:37] divisions. And David went up from there
[26:39] and dwelt in the strongholds at Engeti.
[26:43] Recall a stronghold means a difficult to
[26:46] access
[26:48] place. Um and Getti is on the western
[26:51] side of the of the Dead Sea. There are
[26:53] springs of fresh water there, but it's
[26:55] desolate. This is modern Engeti, a
[26:58] nature reserve in Israel. Looks a bit
[27:00] like portions of the Grand Canyon. The
[27:01] Dead Sea, 1300 ft below sea level, the
[27:04] lowest place on planet Earth that that
[27:07] is not underwater. The cliffs rise some
[27:10] 2500 feet above the Dead Sea, an
[27:12] elevation of about,00 feet. Well,
[27:15] chapter 24, we'll pick up tonight picks
[27:18] up the story and it will inspire another
[27:21] psalm. I'm reading the chapter rather
[27:23] than summarizing because it contains
[27:26] speech by David which helps us
[27:27] understand his heart. And that's what
[27:28] we're looking to to understand the heart
[27:31] of this man that God said was after his
[27:33] own heart. We read in the Psalms where
[27:35] David wrote poetry and songs about this
[27:38] sort of thing. And there are times when
[27:39] he has portions of speech in the text of
[27:42] the narrative that also reveals his
[27:44] thinking, his heart, where he's coming
[27:47] from. 1st Samuel 24:1 It came to pass
[27:51] when Saul was returned from following
[27:53] the Philistines, it was told him,
[27:54] saying, "Behold, David is in the
[27:57] wilderness at
[27:58] Engeti." Then Saul took
[28:01] 3,000 chosen men out of all Israel and
[28:05] went to seek David and his men upon the
[28:09] rocks of the wild
[28:10] goats. Remember, David has at most 600
[28:15] men. Saul is better armed, has the
[28:18] resources of the fledgling nation behind
[28:20] him, and is going after David,
[28:22] outnumbering him five to
[28:26] one. And he Saul came to the sheet coats
[28:30] enclosures for for sheep by the way
[28:33] along the road or the path where there
[28:35] was a cave. And Saul went in to cover
[28:37] his feet to take a nap to to rest a
[28:40] while. And David and his men, some of
[28:43] his men, they were in multiple caves.
[28:45] None of the caves are particularly huge.
[28:47] David and his men remained in the sides
[28:49] of the same
[28:53] cave. And the men of David said quietly
[28:57] to him, "Behold the day of which the
[29:00] Lord said unto thee," it's not recorded
[29:03] elsewhere. "Behold, I will deliver thine
[29:05] enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest
[29:07] do to him as it shall seem good unto
[29:09] thee."
[29:11] Then David
[29:12] arose and cut off the skirt, a little
[29:15] corner of the edge of Saul's robe,
[29:17] privately means secretly, stealthily,
[29:21] unnoticed. And it came to pass afterward
[29:25] that David's heart smoteed
[29:27] him because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
[29:31] In other words, David felt
[29:34] remorse. And David said, I'm sure again
[29:37] quietly to his men, "The Lord forbid
[29:40] that I should do this thing unto my
[29:42] master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch
[29:45] forth mine hand against him, seeing he
[29:48] is the anointed of the
[29:50] Lord." David uses the Lord's name three
[29:53] times, the fact of Saul being anointed
[29:55] or chosen or selected twice in this very
[29:58] brief sentence. He also acknowledges
[30:01] that as long as Saul is alive, David is
[30:04] Saul's servant, but the servitude has
[30:07] its limits. David refuses to cross the
[30:11] line to attack or kill Saul. God made
[30:15] Saul king. It's up to God to bring Saul
[30:18] down, not
[30:20] David. So, David stayed his servants. He
[30:23] restrained his men with these words and
[30:25] suffered them not to rise against
[30:28] Saul. Remember, these guys are rebels.
[30:31] They're wanted men. Saul isn't just
[30:34] after David. He's not likely to show
[30:37] mercy to any of them. This is their
[30:39] golden opportunity to be rid of Saul, to
[30:42] install David as their leader, as king,
[30:45] already anointed by the prophet Samuel
[30:47] to succeed Saul. that David could
[30:50] restrain them with his example and his
[30:53] word speaks both of his leadership and
[30:55] their recognition of
[30:57] it. But
[31:04] Saul, I'm sorry. Yes. But Saul,
[31:07] oblivious to what had happened, rose up
[31:09] out of the cave and went on his way.
[31:12] David also arose afterward and when Saul
[31:14] was a safe distance away but within
[31:17] shouting distance to hear David went out
[31:20] of the cave. David went out of the cave
[31:21] and cried after Saul saying my lord the
[31:24] king and when Saul looked behind him.
[31:28] David stooped with his face to the earth
[31:31] bowed
[31:35] himself. And David said unto Saul,
[31:38] "Wherefore, hearest thou men's words,
[31:40] saying, Behold, David seeketh I hurt."
[31:42] Why do you listen to this nonsense,
[31:44] Saul? Behold, this day thine eyes have
[31:48] seen how that the Lord had delivered
[31:49] thee today into mine hand in the cave,
[31:52] and some made me kill thee, but mine
[31:55] eyes spared thee. And I said, I will not
[31:57] put forth mine hand against my Lord, for
[32:00] he is the Lord's anointed. In other
[32:04] words, that's the only reason you're
[32:05] still
[32:07] alive. Moreover, my father, not only
[32:11] Saul as king, but now appealing to their
[32:13] relationship, Saul was his
[32:15] father-in-law. Moreover, my father, see,
[32:19] yeah, see the skirt of thy robe in my
[32:21] hand. For in that I cut off the skirt of
[32:24] thy robe, and killed thee not. Know thou
[32:27] and see that there is neither evil nor
[32:29] transgression in my hand. I have not
[32:32] sinned against thee. Yet thou hest my
[32:35] soul to take it, to take my life, to
[32:38] kill me. The Lord judge between me and
[32:42] thee. The Lord avenge me of thee, but
[32:46] mine hand shall not be upon thee. David
[32:49] absolutely wants Saul out of the way. He
[32:52] wants his vengeance for Saul's behavior
[32:54] toward him. But there's a red line David
[32:57] will not cross.
[32:59] that is to lift his hand or the hands of
[33:02] his men against the anointed king of
[33:06] Israel. He goes on, "As sayaith the
[33:08] proverb of the ancients, wickedness
[33:10] proceedth from the wicked, but mine hand
[33:12] shall not be upon
[33:14] thee. After whom is the king of Israel
[33:18] come out? After whom dust thou pursue?
[33:20] after a dead dog, after a
[33:23] flea. The Lord therefore be judge, and
[33:26] judge between me and thee, and see, and
[33:30] plead my cause, and deliver me out of
[33:33] thine
[33:34] hand." And it came to pass, when David
[33:38] had made an end of speaking these words
[33:39] unto Saul, that Saul said, "Is this thy
[33:42] voice, my son David?" And Saul lifted up
[33:46] his voice and wept, cried aloud, Saul is
[33:51] tormented. He said to David, "Thou art
[33:54] more righteous than I. Thou hast
[33:56] rewarded me good, whereas I have
[33:59] rewarded the evil. Thou hast showed this
[34:01] day how that thou hast dealt well with
[34:03] me. For as much as when the Lord hath
[34:05] delivered me into thine hand, thou
[34:07] killedest me not. For if a man finds his
[34:11] enemy, will he let him go well
[34:14] away? Wherefore the Lord reward thee
[34:17] good, for that thou hast done unto me
[34:19] this
[34:20] day. And now, behold, I know well that
[34:24] thou shalt surely be king, and that the
[34:27] kingdom of Israel shall be established
[34:29] in thine hand.
[34:31] Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord
[34:34] that thou will not cut off my seed after
[34:36] me and that thou will not destroy my
[34:38] name out of my father's
[34:40] house. Saul's always looking for an
[34:43] angle. He asked David to promise to not
[34:46] kill his sons after Saul's eventual
[34:48] death. He's still hoping to establish a
[34:51] dynasty, a a house, and he trusts David
[34:55] to keep his word.
[34:58] And David swear unto Saul that he
[35:00] wouldn't kill Saul's sons or destroy his
[35:03] line. And Saul went home. But David and
[35:06] his men got them up into the hold. David
[35:10] doesn't trust anything Saul says. He's
[35:13] not going home. He's returning to
[35:17] Engeti. David wrote a psalm about being
[35:19] in a cave, fleeing from Saul. It's
[35:22] unclear if this is when he went to
[35:23] Adelim or Engeti, but unlike Psalm 142,
[35:26] which we read when he went to the cave
[35:28] at Adelim, in this one, he's not
[35:30] revealing loneliness. So, I associate
[35:34] this with his time at Enghetti. Psalm
[35:37] 57 to the chief musician als means it
[35:41] set to the tune of a song of do not
[35:43] destroy. A mik a poem of David when he
[35:47] fled from Saul in the
[35:50] cave. Be merciful unto me, oh God, be
[35:54] merciful unto me. Show me gracious
[35:56] favor. My soul trustth in thee. Yay, in
[36:00] the shadow of thy wings will I make my
[36:03] refuge until these calamities be
[36:06] overpassed. I will cry unto God most
[36:09] high, unto God that perforth all things,
[36:12] who fulfills all his purpose for
[36:15] me. He shall send from heaven and save
[36:18] me from the reproach of him that would
[36:20] swallow me
[36:21] up. Complete Jewish Bible says he will
[36:24] send from heaven and save me from those
[36:26] who would trample me down and mock me.
[36:29] Saha means think about it. God shall
[36:33] send forth his mercy and his truth. My
[36:36] soul is among lions. I lie even among
[36:39] them that are set on fire. Even the sons
[36:42] of men who whose teeth are spears and
[36:44] arrows and their tongue a sharp
[36:47] sword. Be thou exalted, oh God, above
[36:51] the heavens. Let thy glory be above all
[36:53] the earth. Let thy glory shine over all
[36:56] the earth.
[36:58] They've prepared a net, a snare for my
[37:01] steps. My souls bowed down. They've
[37:05] digged a pit and my path before me into
[37:08] the midst whereof they are fallen
[37:11] themselves.
[37:13] Sa my heart is fixed. Oh God, my heart
[37:16] is fixed, steadfast, confident. I will
[37:19] sing and give praise. Awake up my glory,
[37:23] my soul, my heart, my inner self. Awake
[37:26] sultry and harp. I myself will awake
[37:29] early. I will awaken the dawn with my
[37:32] song. I will praise and thank thee, oh
[37:36] Lord, among the people. I will sing unto
[37:38] thee among the nations. For thy mercy,
[37:41] thy thy unfailing love is great,
[37:44] reaching unto the heavens, and thy
[37:47] truth, faithfulness unto the clouds. Be
[37:51] thou exalted, oh God, above the heavens.
[37:54] Let thy glory be above all the
[37:59] earth. Again, we see how David's plea
[38:03] progresses from a cry for help to a cry
[38:06] of
[38:07] praise. Good example for
[38:10] us. David was not immune from
[38:14] stress. As brother Daniel taught last
[38:16] week about Saul being guilty of making
[38:18] hasty decisions, so does David in this
[38:21] next chapter. In the interest of time,
[38:24] I'll I'll summarize parts of chapter
[38:28] 25. Verse one tells us Samuel died. All
[38:31] the Israelites were gathered together,
[38:33] lamented him, and buried him in his
[38:35] house at Rama. David arose and went down
[38:38] to the wilderness of Piran deep in the
[38:40] south. You can see Rama is this little
[38:42] town that's just north of Jerusalem,
[38:44] maybe five miles or six.
[38:48] And there was a man in Maon whose
[38:51] possessions were in Carmel. And the man
[38:54] was very great. He had 3,000 sheep, a
[38:57] thousand goats. He was shearing his
[39:00] sheep in
[39:02] Carmel. Until last week, I assumed
[39:06] Carmel met the same location as Mount
[39:08] Carmel. Quite a distance outside Saul's
[39:10] kingdom. You can see it in the north. If
[39:12] you're familiar with modern Israel,
[39:14] that's where Kyifa is. And my own is
[39:17] down here well south of
[39:20] Jerusalem. I was wrong. When it says
[39:23] Carmel, it doesn't mean Mount Carmel. If
[39:25] it means Mount Carmel, it'll say Mount
[39:27] Carmel. So where is
[39:30] Carmel? Turns out Carmemell was a town
[39:32] at a crossroads just north of Mahon
[39:35] perhaps a mile. If you step out of this
[39:37] church out of the front, walk down to
[39:39] the corner Grant Road and walk back
[39:41] you've traveled the distance from Mone
[39:43] to Carmel. about a mile, about a
[39:45] 20-minut
[39:48] stroll. Now, the name of the man was
[39:51] Nibbal. The name of his wife Abigail.
[39:55] She was a woman of good understanding
[39:57] and of a beautiful countenance. But the
[39:59] man was chish and evil means he was
[40:02] sirly, rude, harsh, rough, badly
[40:06] behaved. He was this way in his doings.
[40:09] And he was of the house of Caleb. Caleb
[40:12] was a descendant of Judah as was David.
[40:14] So these guys are distant relatives in
[40:16] some way. And David heard in the
[40:20] wilderness that Nabal did sheare his
[40:22] sheep. It turns out that David's men
[40:26] were in the vicinity of Nibal's
[40:27] shepherds and they apparently moved
[40:29] together. David's men took nothing and
[40:31] their presence scared away anyone
[40:33] thinking of stealing sheep or stealing
[40:35] from the shepherds. At sharing time, a
[40:38] time of feasting and celebration, David
[40:41] sends 10 men to Nibbal to ask him to
[40:43] share in his bounty. And he tell them
[40:45] that they've been protecting his
[40:46] shepherds. And you can ask the
[40:47] shepherds, they'll tell you that. Well,
[40:50] Nibal will have nothing to do with him.
[40:52] So they return and tell David in verse
[40:56] 12. So David's young men turned their
[40:58] way from Nibbal and Carmel and went
[41:01] again to Mon and came and told David all
[41:04] those sayings. And David, temper
[41:07] flaring, said unto his men, "Gurge ye on
[41:10] every man his sword." And they girded on
[41:13] every man his sword. And David also
[41:15] girded on his sword. And there went up
[41:18] after David about 400 men. 200 abode by
[41:23] the stuff.
[41:25] But one of the young men who worked for
[41:27] Nabal told Abigail, Nabal's wife,
[41:30] saying, "Behold, David sent messengers
[41:33] out of the wilderness to salute our
[41:35] master." And he railed on
[41:37] them. Abigail then very quickly gathers
[41:40] several donkey loads of food stuffs and
[41:43] proceeds to intercept David on the road.
[41:46] Verse 19, she said unto her servants,
[41:49] "Go on before me. Behold, I come after
[41:51] you." But she told not her husband
[41:55] Nabal. And it was so as she rode on the
[41:57] ass. As she came down by the covert of
[41:59] the hill, behold, David and his men came
[42:01] down against came down toward her and
[42:03] she met them.
[42:06] 41 angry men, armed warriors,
[42:11] experienced in battle, tempers high.
[42:15] Now David had said, "Surely in vain have
[42:18] I kept all that this fellow hath in the
[42:20] wilderness, so that nothing was missed
[42:22] of all that pertained unto him, and he
[42:24] hath reququited me evil for good." So,
[42:28] and more also do God unto the enemies of
[42:30] David, if I leave of all that pertain to
[42:32] him by the morning light any that
[42:34] pisseth against the wall. David is
[42:37] determined to kill Nal and all the men
[42:39] of his household, of those who belong to
[42:41] him.
[42:44] And when Abigail saw David, she hasted,
[42:47] lighted off the ass, fell down before
[42:49] David on her face, bowed herself down to
[42:52] the
[42:53] ground, fell at his feet, and said,
[42:56] "Upon me, my Lord, upon me, let this
[42:59] iniquity be. Let thine handmade, I pray
[43:02] thee, speak in thine audience. Hear the
[43:04] words of thine handmmaid. Let not my
[43:07] Lord, I pray thee, regard this man of
[43:09] Bile, even Nabal."
[43:12] She goes on to plead for her
[43:15] household, tells David she's aware he'll
[43:18] be king someday and wouldn't want his
[43:20] hasty action of vengeance on Nibal to be
[43:23] a stain on his
[43:24] heritage. She concludes her plea, verse
[43:29] 31, that this shall be no grief unto
[43:31] thee, nor offense of heart unto my Lord,
[43:34] either that thou hast shed blood without
[43:36] cause, or that my Lord hath avenged
[43:39] himself. But when the Lord shall have
[43:41] dealt well with my Lord, then remember
[43:43] thine
[43:45] handmade. And now we see how David can
[43:49] humble himself and accept
[43:52] correction and recognize the hand of the
[43:55] Lord in it. David said to
[43:59] Abigail, "Blessed be the Lord God of
[44:02] Israel, which sent thee this day to meet
[44:06] me. Blessed be thy advice. Blessed be
[44:10] thou which has kept me this day from
[44:13] coming to shed blood and from avenging
[44:15] myself with mine own hand. For in very
[44:18] deed as the Lord God of Israel liveth,
[44:21] which hath kept me back from hurting
[44:23] thee, except thou hast hasted and come
[44:25] to meet me, surely there had not been
[44:27] left under no ball by the morning light
[44:29] any that pissth against the wall.
[44:32] So David received of her hand that which
[44:34] she brought him and said unto her, "Go
[44:37] up in peace to thine house. See, I have
[44:40] hearkened to thy voice, and have
[44:42] accepted thy
[44:44] person." She goes home, tells Nibal what
[44:47] she did. Apparently, he has a stroke and
[44:51] dies 10 days later.
[44:54] And when David heard that Nibal was
[44:56] dead, he said, "Blessed be the Lord that
[44:59] hath pleaded the cause of my reproach,
[45:01] of my insult from the hand of Nabal, and
[45:05] hath kept his servant David from evil.
[45:09] For the Lord hath returned the
[45:10] wickedness of Nibal upon his own head."
[45:14] I don't pretend to understand the
[45:17] dynamics of what appears in a 21st
[45:19] century context here in America as a
[45:21] case of
[45:22] extortion. The various commentaries I
[45:25] have read all seem to be handwavering.
[45:27] Regardless, David took Nibal's refusal
[45:30] for payment for protection to be evil on
[45:33] Nibal's part. So did his men and Nibal's
[45:37] household and Abigail. So we'll leave it
[45:40] at that. David sent and communed with
[45:44] Abigail to take her to him to wife. And
[45:47] when the servants of David were come to
[45:49] Abigail to Carmemell, they spake unto
[45:51] her, saying, David sent us unto thee to
[45:54] take thee to him to wife.
[45:57] I can think of a more romantic way to
[45:59] propose to somebody,
[46:00] but and she arose. I guess these days it
[46:04] to be texting, but she arose and bowed
[46:07] herself on her face to the earth and
[46:09] said, "Behold, let thine handmade be a
[46:12] servant to wash the feet of the servants
[46:14] of my
[46:16] lord." And Abigail hasted and rose and
[46:19] rode upon an ass with five damsels of
[46:21] hers that went after her. and she went
[46:24] after the messengers of David and became
[46:26] his wife. David also took a hinowim of
[46:30] Jezrael and they were also both of them
[46:33] his
[46:35] wives. But Saul had given Michael his
[46:39] daughter, David's wife, who loved him,
[46:42] risked her life to save him. David loved
[46:46] her, gave Mel to Falty, the son of
[46:50] Leesh, which was of Galilee.
[46:54] Saul really doesn't like David. Chapter
[46:58] 26. David is once again pursued by
[47:02] Saul. David takes Abashi, one of his
[47:05] trusted men, enters Saul's camp during
[47:08] the night. They take Saul's spear and
[47:11] water jug, and David again refuses to
[47:13] harm Saul or allow Abashai to do so. Uh
[47:16] Saul is being guarded by Abnner and his
[47:19] men, but they're all sound asleep. It
[47:23] was made very clear to me when I was in
[47:25] the military that if you're on guard
[47:27] duty, if you're on watch, you don't
[47:31] sleep. There are repercussions. So David
[47:35] took the spear and the cruise of water
[47:37] from Saul's bolster like like a pillow
[47:39] near his head. And they gapped them
[47:41] away. And no man saw it nor knew it,
[47:45] neither awake, for they were all asleep,
[47:48] because a deep sleep from the Lord was
[47:50] fallen upon
[47:56] them. Then David went over to the other
[47:58] side and stood on the top of an hill a
[48:00] far off, a great space being between
[48:03] them. And David cried to the people and
[48:06] to Abnner the son of Nur, saying,
[48:08] "Answerest thou not, Abnner?"
[48:11] Abnner answered and said, "Who art thou
[48:13] that criest to the
[48:15] king?" David said to
[48:18] Abnner, "Art not thou a valiant man? Who
[48:22] is like to thee in Israel? Wherefore
[48:24] then hast thou not kept thy lord the
[48:26] king? For there came one of the people
[48:29] in to destroy the king, thy lord. This
[48:32] thing is not good that thou has done. As
[48:34] the Lord liveth, you're worthy to die
[48:37] because you have not kept your master,
[48:39] the Lord's anointed. And now see where
[48:41] the king's spear is in the cruise of
[48:43] water that was at his
[48:46] bolster. And Saul knew David's voice and
[48:49] said, "Is this thy voice, my son David?"
[48:53] And David said, "It is my voice, my
[48:56] lord, O king." And he said, "Wherefore
[48:58] doth my lord thus pursue after his
[49:00] servant? For what have I done?
[49:03] What evil is in mine
[49:05] hand? Now therefore, I pray thee, let my
[49:08] lord the king hear the words of his
[49:10] servant. If the Lord have stirred thee
[49:12] up against me, let him accept an
[49:14] offering. But if they be the children of
[49:16] men, cursed be they before the Lord, for
[49:19] they have driven me out this day from
[49:20] abiding in the inheritance of the Lord,
[49:22] saying, "Go serve other gods."
[49:26] Now therefore, let not my blood fall to
[49:29] the earth before the face of the Lord.
[49:30] For the king of Israel has come out to
[49:32] seek a flea, as one death does hunt a
[49:35] partridge in the
[49:37] mountains. Then said Saul, I have
[49:40] sinned, "Return, my son David. I will no
[49:43] more do thee harm, because my soul was
[49:46] precious in thine eyes this day. Behold,
[49:48] I have played the fool and have erred
[49:51] exceedingly." David answered and
[49:54] said,"Behold the king's spear. Let one
[49:57] of the young men come over and fetch it.
[49:59] The Lord render to every man his
[50:01] righteousness and his faithfulness, for
[50:04] the Lord delivered thee into my hand
[50:06] today, but I would not stretch forth my
[50:08] hand against the Lord's anointed." That
[50:11] red line he would never cross. And
[50:13] behold, as thy life was much set by this
[50:15] day in mine eyes, so let my life be much
[50:18] set by in the eyes of the Lord. And let
[50:21] him deliver me out of all
[50:24] tribulation. I spared you, Saul, only
[50:27] because you are anointed of the Lord to
[50:29] be king. God placed you, so I leave it
[50:32] in his hands to displace
[50:36] you." Then Saul said to David, "Blessed
[50:40] be thou, my son David. Thou shalt both
[50:42] do great things and also shalt still
[50:45] prevail. So David went on his way and
[50:48] Saul returned to his
[50:51] place. In spite of Saul's claim that he
[50:53] would not harm David in verse 21,
[50:57] David's heard this before. He has zero
[51:01] trust in Saul. David now reveals his
[51:04] thinking about all this. David said in
[51:06] his heart, "I shall now perish one day
[51:09] by the hand of Saul." He's lying when he
[51:12] says he will not harm me. There's
[51:14] nothing better for me than that I should
[51:16] speedily escape into the land of the
[51:18] Philistines. Saul shall despair of me to
[51:20] seek me anymore in any coast within the
[51:23] borders of Israel. So shall I escape out
[51:25] of his
[51:27] hand. David arose, passed over with the
[51:31] 600 men that were with him unto Akish,
[51:34] the son of Maul, king of Gath. Now, this
[51:38] is the same Akish that he fled to before
[51:41] by himself with Goliath's sword. As we
[51:44] read earlier, David pretended to be
[51:47] insane to
[51:49] escape. Akish appears to be somewhat
[51:52] easily
[51:54] manipulated. David dwelt with Akish at
[51:57] Gath, he and his men, every man with his
[52:00] household. So, this is a large group.
[52:02] It's not just David and 600 men. It's
[52:05] David and his two wives and 600 men and
[52:07] their wives and children, likely about
[52:10] 2,000 total,
[52:15] even including David with his two wives,
[52:19] Ahinoam, the Jezelitis, and Abigail the
[52:22] Carbalitis, Nabal's former
[52:25] wife. And it was told Saul that David
[52:27] was fled to Gath, and he sought no more
[52:30] again for him. So David was correct that
[52:32] this would finally stop Saul's pursuit
[52:34] of him. He can go back to being king of
[52:38] Israel. David said unto Akish, "If I
[52:42] have now found grace in thine eyes, let
[52:44] them, the plural, thine eyes, give me a
[52:47] place in some town in the country that I
[52:49] may dwell there. For why should thy
[52:51] servant dwell in the royal city with
[52:53] thee?"
[52:55] flattering the king, looking for a way
[52:57] to be safe from Saul and at the same
[53:00] time not under the watchful eye of the
[53:04] Philistine
[53:06] king. Then Akish gave him Ziglag that
[53:09] day, about 25 miles south of Gath.
[53:12] Wherefore Ziglag pertainth unto the
[53:14] kings of Judah unto this day, this day
[53:18] is when the book was last compiled and
[53:21] edited. And the time that David dwelt in
[53:24] the country of the Philistines was a
[53:26] full year and four
[53:28] months. He was there for 16 months. So
[53:32] David is somewhere between the age of 27
[53:35] and 29 at this
[53:38] point. And now that his movements aren't
[53:42] being observed by Akish, David and his
[53:45] men went up and invaded the Gisherites
[53:47] and the Gazites and the Amalachites. for
[53:50] those nations were of old inhabitants of
[53:52] the land as thou goest to shore, even
[53:54] unto the land of
[53:57] Egypt. I wanted to show these places on
[54:00] a map, especially Geisher and Gzra, but
[54:03] there's little agreement as to where
[54:04] these places were. There's no sign
[54:07] sticking up that says it was here. The
[54:10] text states it was on the way to Egypt.
[54:12] So it had been in the south of the
[54:13] Philistine territory and bordering the
[54:15] kingdom of Israel and the territory of
[54:18] Judah on the south. So the red arrows
[54:21] show the general direction of David's
[54:23] raids to the ultimately protect Judah's
[54:27] southern
[54:29] border. And David smoked the land and
[54:32] left neither man nor woman alive and
[54:35] took away the sheep and the oxen and the
[54:37] asses and the camels and the apparel and
[54:39] returned and came to Akish. So we see
[54:43] David could be as brutal as Saul. We saw
[54:46] the same in Joshua centuries
[54:49] earlier. He brings some of the plunder
[54:51] to Akish and Gath and Akish says whether
[54:56] have you made a road today? who' you
[54:57] attack to get all this stuff? David
[55:01] said, "Against the south of Judah,
[55:04] against the south of the Germalites, and
[55:05] against the south of the Kennites." So
[55:08] David's telling Akish that he attacked
[55:10] the southern borders of Saul's kingdom
[55:12] that is near Philistine territory. In
[55:16] other words, he's working for the
[55:17] Philistines. He's posing as an ally, a
[55:19] dependable person, and bringing wealth
[55:21] to his benefactor,
[55:23] Akish, when in fact he's strengthening
[55:26] and defending the territory he will
[55:28] eventually rule. As a result, and to
[55:32] protect his cover story in Roose, David
[55:35] saved neither man nor woman alive to
[55:38] bring tidings to Gath, saying, "Lest
[55:41] they should tell on us," saying, "So did
[55:43] David, and so will be his manner all the
[55:46] while he dwelleth in the country of the
[55:49] Philistines." So David is practicing
[55:52] deception at great risk. And Akish
[55:55] believed
[55:57] David, saying, He hath made his people
[56:00] Israel, utter to abore
[56:02] him. Therefore, he shall be my servant
[56:09] forever. It came to pass in those days
[56:12] at the end of the 16 months that David
[56:14] was in Ziglag, that the Philistines
[56:17] gathered their armies together for
[56:18] warfare to fight with Israel. And Akish
[56:22] said unto David, "Know thou assuredly,
[56:24] thou shalt go with me to battle, thou
[56:26] and thy
[56:27] men." David said to Akish, "Surely thou
[56:31] shalt know what thy servant can
[56:34] do." H I wonder what he's implying
[56:37] there. And Akish said to David,
[56:40] "Therefore will I make thee keeper of
[56:42] mine head, my bodyguard
[56:46] forever." I love this. Saul sees in
[56:49] David a conspiracy against him when
[56:52] there is
[56:53] none. Akish fails to see in David an
[56:56] ongoing conspiracy against
[57:00] him. I really like that sort of thing. I
[57:03] I just we're going to skip the remainder
[57:06] of chapter 28 tonight because it
[57:08] pertains to Saul.
[57:10] Chapter 29 we read, "Now the Philistines
[57:14] gathered together all their armies to
[57:15] Aph and the Israelites pitched by a
[57:18] fountain which is in
[57:20] Jezrael. And the lords of the
[57:22] Philistines, you remember the
[57:23] Philistines, they aren't a nation like
[57:25] we think of it. There's these citystates
[57:27] that are kind of a loose confederation.
[57:30] So they're gathering the armies from all
[57:31] of these citystates under the general
[57:34] banner of the Philistines.
[57:36] The lords of the Philistines passed on
[57:39] by hundreds and by thousands. But David
[57:43] and his men passed on in the rear
[57:45] reward, the rear guard, the last troops
[57:48] to pass in review with
[57:51] Akish. So this gives you an overview
[57:54] showing some of the locations. You can
[57:56] see Saul's army at the top of the map in
[57:58] Jezreel. The Philistine armies are
[58:00] gathering together at at Aphic there. So
[58:03] David comes from Ziglag about 25 miles
[58:05] up to Gaff. They march about another 30
[58:08] miles with uh with Akish's uh troops on
[58:12] up to Aphik and that's where they're
[58:13] having this big gathering to get this
[58:15] large army put
[58:17] together. Gives you an idea of the of
[58:19] the
[58:21] territory. Then said the princes of the
[58:25] Philistines, what do these Hebrews hear?
[58:29] Akish said unto the princes of the
[58:32] Philistines, "Is this not this David,
[58:35] the servant of Saul, the king of Israel,
[58:38] which had been with me these days or
[58:40] these years?" One year and four months,
[58:42] and I have found no fault in him since
[58:44] he fell unto me unto this day. It's
[58:47] great. David is on our
[58:50] side. The princes of the Philistines
[58:52] were angry with Akish. And the princes
[58:55] of the Philistines said unto him, "Make
[58:58] this fellow David return. He may go
[59:01] again to his place which thou hast
[59:03] appointed him. Let him not go down with
[59:05] us to battle, lest the battle be an
[59:07] adversary to us." Wake up, Akish! No
[59:10] wonder you're bringing up the rear. For
[59:13] wherewith should he reconcile himself
[59:16] unto his master? Should it not be with
[59:18] the heads of these men?
[59:21] Is not this David of whom they sang one
[59:23] to another in dances saying Saul slew
[59:26] his thousands and David his 10
[59:30] thousands? These guys have a bit more
[59:32] insight than their buddy
[59:35] Akish. Then Akish called David and said
[59:38] to him, "Surely is the Lord liveth. Thou
[59:41] has been upright and thy going out and
[59:43] thy coming in with me and the host is
[59:45] good in my sight. I have not found evil
[59:48] in these since the day of thy coming
[59:50] unto me and to this
[59:51] day. Nevertheless, the the Lords favor
[59:54] thee not. Wherefore now return, go in
[59:58] peace that thou displeas not the lords
[1:00:00] of the
[1:00:02] Philistines. And David said unto
[1:00:05] Akish. Familiar words from David. But
[1:00:08] what have I done? What has I found in
[1:00:11] thy servants so long as I've been with
[1:00:13] thee unto this day that I may not go and
[1:00:15] fight against the enemies of my lord the
[1:00:19] king? Again, I love how he words that.
[1:00:22] It's clever. It's ambiguous. Which
[1:00:24] person is my lord the king? Akish or
[1:00:29] Saul? David's trying to sandwich and hit
[1:00:32] the Philistines from the back while Saul
[1:00:34] hits him from the front. That plan is
[1:00:37] being thwarted. But the way that he
[1:00:38] expresses it, Akish thinks that, "Oh, I
[1:00:41] wanted to go fight against
[1:00:43] Saul." Again, I I just love this
[1:00:47] stuff. And Akish answered and said to
[1:00:50] David, "I know that thou art good in my
[1:00:52] sight as an angel of God."
[1:00:55] Notwithstanding, the princes of the
[1:00:56] Philistines have said, he shall not go
[1:00:58] up with us to the battle. Wherefore now,
[1:01:01] rise up early in the morning with thy
[1:01:03] master's servants that are come with
[1:01:05] thee. And as soon as you be up early in
[1:01:07] the morning and have light,
[1:01:10] depart. So David and his men rose up
[1:01:14] early to depart in the morning to return
[1:01:17] into the land of the Philistines. And
[1:01:20] the Philistines went up to
[1:01:22] Jezrael. So the Philistine armies are
[1:01:25] marching from Aph up to Jezrael to
[1:01:27] confront Saul. David is now going the 50
[1:01:30] or so miles, 55, 60 miles from Aph back
[1:01:34] to Ziklag.
[1:01:37] about three days since he's
[1:01:42] left. And it came to
[1:01:44] pass when David and his men were come to
[1:01:47] Ziglag on the third day that the
[1:01:50] Amalachites that the the ones that uh
[1:01:52] Saul had not defeated as Samuel had
[1:01:55] commanded him to do. that the
[1:01:57] Amalachites had invaded the south and
[1:01:59] Ziglag and smitten Ziglag and burned it
[1:02:03] with fire and had taken the women
[1:02:06] captives that were therein. They slew
[1:02:08] not any either great or
[1:02:11] small, but carried them
[1:02:17] away and went on their way.
[1:02:21] So David and his men came to the city,
[1:02:24] and behold, it was burned with
[1:02:27] fire. Their wives, their sons, their
[1:02:32] daughters were taken
[1:02:34] captive. David and the people that were
[1:02:37] with him lifted up their voice and wept
[1:02:40] until they had no more power to
[1:02:43] weep. Put yourself in their place for a
[1:02:46] moment.
[1:02:48] Can you
[1:02:49] imagine coming home and your whole
[1:02:52] neighborhood, your whole town, your
[1:02:53] whole area is burned with
[1:02:56] fire? Your spouse is gone. Your kids are
[1:03:00] gone. You've been you've been out on the
[1:03:02] job for three days and you come home and
[1:03:04] this is what you
[1:03:08] see. David's two wives were taken
[1:03:11] captives. Oham, the Jezraelitis and
[1:03:13] Abigail, the former wife of Nabal the
[1:03:16] Carmealite.
[1:03:18] David was greatly distressed. For the
[1:03:21] people spake of stoning him, because the
[1:03:24] soul of all the people was grieved,
[1:03:26] every man for his sons and his
[1:03:29] daughters. It was your leadership that
[1:03:31] brought us here, David. And now look
[1:03:33] what's
[1:03:35] happened. But David encouraged himself,
[1:03:39] and the Lord is God.
[1:03:42] I wonder if this might have been the
[1:03:44] time he wrote the sixth
[1:03:48] psalm. Psalm
[1:03:51] six. Oh Lord, rebuke me not in thine
[1:03:55] anger, neither chasen me in thy hot
[1:03:58] displeasure. Have mercy upon me, oh
[1:04:00] Lord. I'm weak. Lord, heal me. My bones
[1:04:04] are vexed. My soul is also sore, vexed.
[1:04:07] But thou, oh Lord, how long?
[1:04:10] Return, O Lord, deliver my soul. Save me
[1:04:12] for thy mercy's sake. In death there's
[1:04:15] no remembrance of thee and the
[1:04:19] grave. Who shall give thee
[1:04:21] thanks? I'm weary with my groaning. All
[1:04:25] the night make I my bed to swim. I water
[1:04:29] my couch with my tears. Mine eye is
[1:04:34] consumed because of grief.
[1:04:37] that waxes old because of all my
[1:04:41] enemies. Depart from me, all you workers
[1:04:43] of iniquity. The Lord has heard the
[1:04:46] voice of my weeping. The The Lord has
[1:04:48] heard my supplication. The Lord will
[1:04:50] receive my prayer. Let all mine enemies
[1:04:53] be ashamed and sore vexed. Let them
[1:04:55] return and be ashamed
[1:05:02] suddenly. Back to chapter 30 of 1
[1:05:05] Samuel. David said to Abathther the
[1:05:08] priest, a himc son, I pray thee, bring
[1:05:11] me hither the
[1:05:12] ephod. We talked about that priestly
[1:05:15] garment before. Abathther brought
[1:05:18] thither the eod to David. And David
[1:05:21] inquired at the Lord, saying, "Shall I
[1:05:24] pursue after this troop? Shall I
[1:05:26] overtake
[1:05:28] them?" And the Lord answered him,
[1:05:31] "Pursue? Thou shalt surely overtake them
[1:05:34] and without fail recover
[1:05:38] all. So David went, he and the 600 men
[1:05:42] that were with him and came to the brook
[1:05:44] Bessor where those that were left behind
[1:05:48] stayed. It's hard to see. I see
[1:05:52] everybody's got their binoculars so you
[1:05:54] can see it. There's uh this little blue
[1:05:57] thread here actually flows this way.
[1:05:59] That's the brook of Bizor. So they're
[1:06:01] heading from Ziklag to get to the brook
[1:06:03] of
[1:06:04] Mizor and then they'll
[1:06:07] continue. But David pursued he and 400
[1:06:10] men for 200 abodeed behind which were so
[1:06:13] faint they could not go over the brook
[1:06:16] bizore. They are so
[1:06:18] overcome with grief with sorrow. They
[1:06:22] have no strength.
[1:06:24] And they found an Egyptian in the field
[1:06:26] and brought him to David and gave him
[1:06:28] bread and he did eat. And they made him
[1:06:30] drink water. They gave him a piece of a
[1:06:33] cake of figs, two clusters of raisins.
[1:06:36] And when he had eaten, his spirit came
[1:06:39] again to him, for he had eaten no bread
[1:06:41] or drunk any water three days and three
[1:06:44] nights. David said unto
[1:06:48] him, "To whom belongest thou?" He
[1:06:51] realizes this guy is not a local person,
[1:06:54] therefore probably a slave of some sort.
[1:06:57] To whom belongest thou? And whence art
[1:06:59] thou? Where are you
[1:07:01] from? And he said, I am a young man of
[1:07:05] Egypt, servant to an
[1:07:07] Amalachite. My master left me because
[1:07:10] three days ago I fell sick. We made an
[1:07:13] invasion upon the south of the Kathites
[1:07:16] and upon the border that belongs to
[1:07:18] Judah and and upon the south of Caleb,
[1:07:20] that part of Judah, and we burned Ziglag
[1:07:23] with
[1:07:24] fire. They raided and destroyed along
[1:07:27] the southern border of Judah and
[1:07:28] surrounding areas. David said unto him,
[1:07:32] thou bring me down to this company?
[1:07:35] And he said, "Swear unto me by God that
[1:07:38] thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me
[1:07:40] into the hands of my master, and I'll
[1:07:43] bring thee down to this
[1:07:45] company." And when he had brought him
[1:07:47] down, behold, they were spread abroad
[1:07:51] upon all the earth, eating and drinking
[1:07:54] and dancing, because of all the great
[1:07:56] spoil that they had taken out of the
[1:07:58] land of the Philistines and out of the
[1:08:00] land of Judah.
[1:08:02] And David smokeote
[1:08:05] them from the twilight even into the
[1:08:08] evening of the next day. There escaped
[1:08:11] not a man of them except for 400 young
[1:08:14] men which rode upon camels and
[1:08:17] fled. David recovered all that the
[1:08:20] Amalachites had carried away. And David
[1:08:23] rescued his two wives. There was nothing
[1:08:26] lacking to them. neither small nor
[1:08:28] great, neither sons nor daughters,
[1:08:29] neither spoil, nor anything that they
[1:08:32] had taken to them. David recovered
[1:08:35] all. David took all the flocks and the
[1:08:38] herds which they drove before those
[1:08:40] other cattle and said, "This is David's
[1:08:42] spoil."
[1:08:44] David came to the 200 men which were so
[1:08:49] faint they could not follow David whom
[1:08:52] they had made also to abide at the brook
[1:08:54] Bessor. And they went forth to meet
[1:08:56] David and to meet the people that were
[1:08:58] with him. And when David came near to
[1:09:01] the people, he saluted
[1:09:04] them. Hi guys, we're back.
[1:09:08] then answered all the wicked men and men
[1:09:10] of Balile of those 400 that went with
[1:09:13] David. Here we see in that congregation
[1:09:17] and these 600 guys, there's some
[1:09:20] questionable people amongst that group.
[1:09:23] They're not
[1:09:24] all upright, the kind of people that you
[1:09:27] might want for a neighbor, right? That's
[1:09:29] all the people that were unhappy, all
[1:09:31] the people that were basically running
[1:09:33] from the law and had come to
[1:09:35] David. answered all the wicked men of
[1:09:37] Balile and said, "Because they went not
[1:09:40] with us, we will not give them anything
[1:09:42] of the spoil that we have recovered,
[1:09:45] save every man can have his wife and his
[1:09:47] kids, that they may lead them away and
[1:09:51] depart." David said, "You shall not do
[1:09:55] so, my brethren, with that which the
[1:09:57] Lord hath given us, who hath preserved
[1:09:59] us, and delivered the company that came
[1:10:02] against us into our hand."
[1:10:04] I appreciate you guys's effort, but it's
[1:10:07] the Lord that did this.
[1:10:11] For who will hearken unto you in this
[1:10:12] matter? As his part is that goeth down
[1:10:15] to the battle, so shall his heart part
[1:10:18] be that carth by the stuff? They shall
[1:10:20] part alike. Everybody gets the same pay.
[1:10:23] If you're a warrior, good for you. If
[1:10:25] you're a supply sergeant, good for you.
[1:10:27] Everybody is treated the same. And it
[1:10:30] was so from that day forward that he
[1:10:33] made it a statute and an ordinance for
[1:10:36] Israel unto this day.
[1:10:40] And when David came to Ziglag, he sent
[1:10:42] of the spoil unto the elders of Judah,
[1:10:45] even unto his friends, saying, "Behold,
[1:10:47] a present for you of the spoil of the
[1:10:49] enemies of the Lord, to them which were
[1:10:52] in Bethl and South Ramoth and Jat, and
[1:10:56] Auror, and Sifmoth, and Echo, and Rael,
[1:11:00] and the cities of the Germalites, and
[1:11:02] the cities of the Kenites, and Horma,
[1:11:04] and Corusan, and Aic, and to them which
[1:11:07] were in Hebron, to all the places where
[1:11:09] David himself and his men were want to
[1:11:13] haunt. So he didn't just share it with
[1:11:16] his guys, he spread it
[1:11:20] around. The next chapter, chapter 31, is
[1:11:24] solely about Saul, not about David, and
[1:11:27] concludes the book of 1 Samuel in the
[1:11:29] time before David became king, which is
[1:11:33] next time.
[1:11:38] What lessons can we take away from this
[1:11:40] part of the story of David that we can
[1:11:43] apply? In this portion of David's life,
[1:11:47] we see behaviors that tell us he was
[1:11:50] very human. His faith in God was strong,
[1:11:54] but it was tested time and again. Samuel
[1:11:58] had anointed him to be king to succeed
[1:12:00] Saul. But God wasn't done with the
[1:12:03] training and preparation for David to
[1:12:06] become king. He needed to see what Saul
[1:12:09] was doing both from being a favored
[1:12:11] person inside the court as well as being
[1:12:14] a hunted person innocent of the crime
[1:12:17] for which he was being
[1:12:18] persecuted. He needed to see that within
[1:12:21] Saul's entourage as well as among his
[1:12:23] smaller cadre, there were persons of
[1:12:25] evil
[1:12:26] intent. In chapter 24, he spared Saul's
[1:12:30] life, and his conscience bothered him
[1:12:32] for even snipping off a small corner of
[1:12:34] the border of Saul's
[1:12:36] robe. So small that Saul and whoever was
[1:12:39] with him didn't even notice it had been
[1:12:41] cut until David pointed it
[1:12:44] out. Similarly, in chapter 26, when
[1:12:47] David took Saul's spear and water jug,
[1:12:49] he made it perfectly clear that he would
[1:12:51] not harm Saul or allow his men to harm
[1:12:55] Saul. The red line David would not cross
[1:12:58] was to attack or injure the king God has
[1:13:01] chosen. God placed Saul as king. God
[1:13:05] would have to displace him in his own
[1:13:08] time. David made it just as clear he
[1:13:11] wanted God to avenge him of Saul. He
[1:13:13] asked God to do this again and again in
[1:13:15] the Psalms and in the text of the
[1:13:17] speeches that he's made.
[1:13:19] Between those events and chapter
[1:13:23] 25, David felt insulted and and these
[1:13:26] days we'd say he was disrespected. He
[1:13:28] was dissed by Nabal. And his immediate
[1:13:31] reaction was to kill Nabal in his entire
[1:13:33] house. Kill all the males associated
[1:13:35] with him, cut off his line
[1:13:37] forever. We recognize David was under
[1:13:41] extreme stress and had been for years.
[1:13:44] Saul chasing him to kill him. Having a
[1:13:46] company of about 2,000 people with the
[1:13:49] responsibility to see they had food and
[1:13:51] shelter, provide
[1:13:53] leadership, settle disputes, being a
[1:13:56] shepherd to such a crowd made up of
[1:13:58] people who were discontented to begin
[1:14:01] with. The musicians would please come.
[1:14:06] We also saw an
[1:14:08] Abigail, a person who recognized the
[1:14:11] danger of her husband's reaction to
[1:14:14] David's request. Brother Brer might tell
[1:14:16] us it was a mother's love to protect her
[1:14:18] children.
[1:14:20] In any case, she immediately responded
[1:14:23] to David's original request of Nibal,
[1:14:26] intercepted him and his troop of 400
[1:14:28] angry armed men, and said, "Let me take
[1:14:31] the blame, the punishment for the
[1:14:33] wickedness of this man."
[1:14:36] She was displaying, we would say, the
[1:14:39] nature and spirit of Jesus Christ, an
[1:14:42] innocent one willing to take the
[1:14:45] punishment and bear the reproach on
[1:14:46] behalf of another who was unaware of the
[1:14:49] intervention and was
[1:14:51] guilty. She is such an illustration of
[1:14:54] the gospel.
[1:14:57] Finally, when David returned to Ziglag
[1:15:00] and found the town destroyed and the
[1:15:02] people gone, he was stricken by profound
[1:15:05] grief on one hand and the griefdriven
[1:15:08] anger of his men on the other. Men who
[1:15:11] would follow him anywhere were now
[1:15:13] thinking of killing him, death by
[1:15:17] stoning. David turned to the Lord for
[1:15:20] soloulless, comfort, and strength.
[1:15:24] Let's close this portion of the service
[1:15:26] with a song from Psalm
[1:15:29] 19. A psalm of
[1:15:35] David. The love of the Lord is
[1:15:41] perfect, converting the
[1:15:47] soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure.
[1:15:54] making wise the
[1:15:59] simple. More to be
[1:16:02] desired are they than gold, yay, than
[1:16:06] much fine gold.
[1:16:11] Sweeter also than
[1:16:16] honey and the honey
[1:16:22] cold. The statutes of the Lord are
[1:16:27] right, rejoicing the heart.
[1:16:33] The commandment of the Lord is
[1:16:38] pure, enlightening the
[1:16:43] eyes. More to be desired are they than
[1:16:49] gold, yay, than much fine gold.
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:16:55] Sweeter also than
[1:17:00] honey and the honey
[1:17:05] cold. The fear of the Lord is
[1:17:11] clean, enduring
[1:17:14] [Music]
[1:17:16] forever. The judgments of the Lord are
[1:17:22] true and righteous allto
[1:17:27] together. More to be desired are they
[1:17:32] than gold, yay, than much fine gold.
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:39] Sweeter also than
[1:17:43] honey and the honey
[1:17:48] cold. Moreover, by them is thy servant
[1:17:54] warm, is thy servant warm.
[1:18:00] For over
[1:18:04] my is thy serant
[1:18:09] war. And in keeping of them there is
[1:18:14] great reward. There is great reward.
[1:18:26] There is
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:41] great song of Psalms 42.
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:19:00] Why my soul are you
[1:19:06] downcast? Why are you trbled
[1:19:12] within? For I will hope in my savior my
[1:19:18] God and will praise him yet praise him
[1:19:22] again. Repeat that
[1:19:25] again. Why my soul are you
[1:19:31] downcast? Why are you troubled within?
[1:19:38] For I will hope in my Savior, Michael,
[1:19:43] my God, and will praise him yet praise
[1:19:47] him
[1:19:50] again.
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:19:56] Hallelujah.
[1:20:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:08] I will praise him yet. Praise him again.
[1:20:12] One more time.

[1:20:16] [Music]
[1:20:20] Hallelujah.
[1:20:23] [Music]
[1:20:26] Hallelujah.
[1:20:28] [Music]
[1:20:32] Hallelujah. I will praise him yet praise
[1:20:35] him again.
[1:20:39] Morning by morning, new mercies are
[1:20:43] streaming. I trust in your goodness
[1:20:47] where I cannot
[1:20:50] see. You have been faithful whenever I
[1:20:55] wonder. Lord, give me the hope that I
[1:21:00] need.
[1:21:03] Morning by morning your mercies are
[1:21:08] streaming. I trust in your goodness
[1:21:12] where I cannot
[1:21:14] see. You have been faithful whenever I

[1:21:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:10] Hallelujah. I will praise him yet praise
[1:22:14] him again. The first
[1:22:16] verse. Why my soul are you
[1:22:21] [Music]
[1:22:23] downcast? Why are you troubled within?
[1:22:29] hope for. I will hope in my savior my
[1:22:34] God and will praise him yet praise him
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:22:44] again.
[1:22:45] Beginning of that psalm says, "As the
[1:22:48] heart panth for the
[1:22:51] waterbrooks, soul my soul after thee, oh
[1:22:54] God."
[1:22:56] Lao said
[1:22:59] that he he liked and and one of the
[1:23:03] things that his his mind liked was the
[1:23:07] irony of
[1:23:09] Saul and David and how David was loyal
[1:23:14] to
[1:23:16] Saul and yet Saul wanted to kill David
[1:23:21] because he thought he was disloyal.
[1:23:25] And then
[1:23:26] Akish thought that David was loyal and
[1:23:30] David actually wasn't loyal to Akish. He
[1:23:34] was loyal to Saul. And and the irony
[1:23:37] there
[1:23:39] and brother was
[1:23:42] closing. I was thinking, Lord, I I have
[1:23:46] something
[1:23:47] that the the way that I
[1:23:50] think too, and it's something that maybe
[1:23:53] doesn't make sense to
[1:23:55] me.
[1:23:58] Why would you have the Philistines leave
[1:24:04] Ziglag? And why would you have David
[1:24:07] leave
[1:24:08] Ziglag? And then an invading army, the
[1:24:11] Malachites, come in and burn their homes
[1:24:15] and steal all of their possessions and
[1:24:18] steal their wives and their
[1:24:21] children. And then David comes back and
[1:24:24] he he
[1:24:27] goes after the Philistines and he says,
[1:24:29] "Should I go after them?" And the and
[1:24:33] the answer came back from the Lord,
[1:24:34] "Yes, go." and he goes and and this man
[1:24:37] comes out of basically out of nowhere
[1:24:39] and shows them where they
[1:24:41] are. And I look at it and it doesn't say
[1:24:44] that it served a purpose.
[1:24:48] Why did David's family, why did why did
[1:24:51] they all have to suffer for that time
[1:24:53] when it was just a circle? And and and
[1:24:56] what purpose did it have for these
[1:24:58] Malachites to to invade and and take the
[1:25:01] families and cause all this suffering
[1:25:04] and this hardship? And then David goes
[1:25:06] and gets them and bring it brings them
[1:25:08] back. Like Lord, what did it purpose did
[1:25:13] it serve? The Bible doesn't tell us. And
[1:25:17] we can look at all the
[1:25:18] suffering friends that we go through
[1:25:20] many
[1:25:22] times and we might wonder
[1:25:26] why why do I suffer? Why have I been put
[1:25:30] through this? Why has my life taken this
[1:25:37] turn? And it's because God has a purpose
[1:25:40] in it. And he had a purpose in that
[1:25:44] whole situation with David.
[1:25:47] We don't know what that purpose was, but
[1:25:49] it was a divine
[1:25:51] purpose. And then David during these
[1:25:54] times, he just cries
[1:25:58] out praises to
[1:26:01] God. And I just think,
[1:26:05] Lord,
[1:26:07] I what a man this man David was.
[1:26:13] And he was one of the greatest of them
[1:26:17] all to be loyal to that man that hated
[1:26:20] him. And all the
[1:26:22] while working and being a benefit and
[1:26:26] being a blessing to the kingdom. And it
[1:26:28] wasn't even his kingdom
[1:26:30] yet. He but he he was a great man. And
[1:26:34] he just did what was best not for
[1:26:38] himself, but he did what was best for
[1:26:41] the Lord.
[1:26:42] I think, wow, he was truly a great great
[1:26:49] man with all of his faults and the Lord
[1:26:53] truly put him through a many, many hard
[1:26:56] times. But God had a purpose in it. We
[1:26:59] can say maybe it was to build his
[1:27:00] character, maybe it was for something
[1:27:02] else,
[1:27:04] but he had a purpose. And he has a
[1:27:07] purpose, friends, in everything that we
[1:27:09] go through. God has a purpose in all of
[1:27:12] it. We may never know when we're on
[1:27:14] earth, but one thing I will promise you
[1:27:17] is when David got to the other side, he
[1:27:19] probably said, "Thank you, God. Thank
[1:27:22] you for Ziglag. Thank you for the the
[1:27:26] caves of Engeti. Thank you for all all
[1:27:29] of this happened. Lord, I suffered, but
[1:27:31] now I know why."
[1:27:34] and we suffer and we go through things
[1:27:37] and we may not know
[1:27:39] why, but I promise you God has a purpose
[1:27:42] in all of it just like he did with
[1:27:44] David. Let's all stand.
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:28:01] I've learned to trust in
[1:28:04] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[1:28:08] God. Through it
[1:28:12] all, through it
[1:28:16] all, I want to depend on his word.
[1:28:25] Oh, through it
[1:28:28] all. Through it
[1:28:32] all, I learn to trust in
[1:28:36] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[1:28:40] God. Through it
[1:28:43] all, through it
[1:28:47] all, our world depend upon his
[1:28:55] word. Man, we've learned to depend on
[1:28:59] God's word through it all. for whatever
[1:29:02] whatever toils and tears, whatever
[1:29:04] problems this word world may throw at
[1:29:08] us, we can just turn right to this
[1:29:11] blessed
[1:29:13] Bible. Say, Lord, I may not understand
[1:29:17] why I'm going through this. I may not
[1:29:18] understand why these things
[1:29:22] happen, but I do believe that you're in
[1:29:25] charge, and I do believe that you have
[1:29:27] your hand on it all. Brother Joe Miller,
[1:29:30] would you come close, my
[1:29:33] friend? I said I said,
[1:29:39] Miller, I've learned to trust in
[1:29:44] God. Through it
[1:29:47] all, through it
[1:29:51] all, I've learned to depend on his word.
[1:30:01] One more time. That's good. Oh, through
[1:30:04] it
[1:30:05] all. Come on now. Through it
[1:30:10] all, I've learned to trust in
[1:30:14] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[1:30:18] God. Through it all.
[1:30:23] Through it
[1:30:25] all, I move to depend upon his word.
[1:30:34] How about Brother Johnson? Wasn't that
[1:30:36] amazing?
[1:30:37] [Applause]
[1:30:40] That was really amazing. Um
[1:30:45] Um You know, the our family's been
[1:30:48] through a lot um this past couple weeks.
[1:30:52] Um, I know you've seen my little
[1:30:54] grandchildren and one of my
[1:30:56] grandchildren lost their mother just
[1:30:58] recently and uh, you know, they're
[1:31:00] young. They're young and when the young
[1:31:02] pass, it's really really difficult. But,
[1:31:05] uh, you know, it seems like everyone's
[1:31:07] going through an awful lot. So, um, with
[1:31:10] with all that we've learned in in in
[1:31:13] here, let's let's go to the Lord. But
[1:31:15] let's also think about all those the
[1:31:18] young ones that are struggling and and
[1:31:20] trying to make their way. Heavenly
[1:31:22] Father, thank you for this night. What a
[1:31:24] wonderful night to to give us the the
[1:31:27] the pleasure of being here and listening
[1:31:29] to your word, Lord. It's so such a it's
[1:31:33] it's it's it just fills your cup up. You
[1:31:36] you you work so hard and then you come
[1:31:38] here and it wasn't that hard, was
[1:31:41] it, Lord? it. It's it's it's just a
[1:31:45] pleasure to be here with in in your
[1:31:49] house with our brothers and our
[1:31:52] sisters. I ask that you uh that you
[1:31:55] watch out for those that that couldn't
[1:31:57] be here tonight. There's so many people
[1:31:59] that want to be here and just just can't
[1:32:01] be
[1:32:03] here. Have a special place for them. And
[1:32:07] you know, we all have people on our
[1:32:09] hearts and we know that you've got it.
[1:32:13] But we need a little encouragement,
[1:32:14] Lord. Would you just build our our
[1:32:18] faith? I mean, these little signs that
[1:32:20] you've shown us, oh man, on Sunday and
[1:32:23] tonight, just the word, just your word
[1:32:26] is just so comforting, Lord. I know, um,
[1:32:29] a lot of people are coming to the end of
[1:32:31] their school year. and teachers are
[1:32:33] getting pretty excited about that. But
[1:32:35] the kids are are getting promoted and
[1:32:38] graduated, moving on, and it's really
[1:32:41] changing their lives. And would you be
[1:32:43] with there with them, Lord? Would you
[1:32:46] would
[1:32:47] you make this night the day that they
[1:32:50] remember you and and give you thanks,
[1:32:53] Lord, for everything that's happened and
[1:32:56] and how you've been there for them each
[1:32:58] step of the way. And then we can
[1:33:01] celebrate with our our friends and
[1:33:03] family and and rejoice the good things
[1:33:05] as the graduations, the promotions come.
[1:33:08] And as it gets warmer out here, we might
[1:33:10] complain. Lord, help us not to complain
[1:33:13] so much to really see that you have a
[1:33:16] plan and we don't quite understand your
[1:33:18] plan, but we trust in you. We have faith
[1:33:21] in you, Lord. We we we are so
[1:33:24] appreciative of you. Please watch us as
[1:33:27] we go on our way to home. please bring
[1:33:30] us back and um on Sunday so that we can
[1:33:33] gather and uh if we have to wait that
[1:33:37] long and uh hopefully we'll meet with
[1:33:39] you before then but if not we'll we'd
[1:33:42] love to be back here on Sunday. So thank
[1:33:44] you Lord and we we we love you so much
[1:33:48] in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:33:53] Oh through it all.
[1:33:58] Oh, through it
[1:34:01] all, I've learned to trust in
[1:34:05] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[1:34:09] God. Through it
[1:34:13] all, through it
[1:34:17] all, I come to depend upon his word.
[1:34:24] [Music]
[1:34:26] All is
[1:34:31] well. Oh, all is
[1:34:37] well. We have heard the message shalom
[1:34:43] and all is well.
[1:34:49] There is a place of perfect rest behind
[1:34:56] the
[1:34:58] inner show
[1:35:04] rest for all is well. One more time
[1:35:09] brother. All is well.

[1:35:25] and all is
[1:35:30] well. There is a place of perfect rest
[1:35:37] behind the inner man.
[1:35:42] So rest little bride rest for all is
[1:35:49] well. All is well. No matter what
[1:35:53] happens, brother Joe, all is well. With
[1:35:56] David, he had lost everything. That day
[1:35:59] when he came home, it was all gone. But
[1:36:02] yet all was well. First thing he did is
[1:36:05] he went to the Lord and then the Lord
[1:36:09] provided. God bless you all. It's good
[1:36:12] to see you all. Tonight, I pray that the
[1:36:14] Lord will go with you. Remember, um,
[1:36:18] Saturday night, we'll have a youth
[1:36:20] gathering in the upper room. Don't
[1:36:22] forget, and all the other youth, Sister
[1:36:25] Hope, don't you forget. Um, and then our
[1:36:29] normal service, Sunday
[1:36:32] morning. And,
[1:36:35] um, think on these things that Brother
[1:36:38] Lyle has brought before us tonight.
[1:36:41] ponder on him. Ponder on this great man,
[1:36:45] David. All that he went through and and
[1:36:48] the great battles that he won. And I
[1:36:52] don't think the the hardest battles,
[1:36:53] Brother Ly, I don't think were on the
[1:36:56] battlefield. I think the hardest battles
[1:36:58] that David won were those battles to
[1:37:01] keep his character. Yes. And and to keep
[1:37:05] keep serving God. Yes. and not to fall
[1:37:08] for the the tricks of the enemy. God
[1:37:11] bless you, brothers and sisters. You're
[1:37:15] dismissed. Oh, all is
[1:37:21] well. All is
[1:37:26] well. We have heard the message, Shalom,
[1:37:32] and all is well.
[1:37:37] There is a place of perfect rest behind
[1:37:44] the
[1:37:46] end. Show rest and
[1:37:50] brightest for all is
[1:37:56] well. All is
[1:38:01] well. All is well.
