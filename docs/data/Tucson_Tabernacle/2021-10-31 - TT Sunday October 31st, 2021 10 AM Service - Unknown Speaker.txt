========================================
[Music] hey is this monitor on he will make a way for me he will be my god hold me closely by his son with love and strength he will make a way he will let him sing that one more time [Music] he will make a way for me he will be my god hold me closer [Music] amen what a mighty god we serve isn't it good to see some of the folks that hadn't been able to be here i know sister shirley and sarah had quarantined there but good to see you and i see brother no i always want to call you figaro's but your tailors did i said it's good to see them all god bless you robert god has made a way amen we do have a couple of needs we'll bring them to your attention and i see brother peter just walked in and i guess he took the wrong turn somewhere because he said he's going to be out of town but come on up brother peter so you can take these needs my sister kathy called my dad this morning and said she was having some trouble breathing and her kidneys were not functioning and she has been on dialysis now for some time but she was not feeling well and then my sis my daughter sarah sent a text she had headache and some pain and some nausea so this morning she was asking us to to remember her and i have not had a real recent update but the last update on brother steve buckles was he was not able to breathe on his own and he was still using a ventilator so remember i did ask brother juan how sister irma gashiola was doing and she was doing better after going through covet also so you have a need i mean we always there's not one of us that doesn't have a need to just recognizing that our lord is more than able so let's just just believe them just a small praise we got a flat tire yesterday and that's not usually something that we we praise about but the way that it happened the tire pressure was going down really quick i could watch it going down and we were able to pull into a tire shop just an hour before they closed and and they were able to replace the tire and something that could have been you know if it hadn't realized it and got on the highway or something you never know what could happen but i believe the lord was mindful there and he's mindful of my tire i know he's mindful of your need so let's just pray to him dear lord jesus your word tells us that you love us lord that we're as the apple of your eye and written on the palms of your hands we know lord that you bore our sin and our shame you took the stripes that should have been for us lord you nailed it all to calvary lord we're so thankful that you made a way that we can come back to you and we can come boldly lord before your throne of grace to obtain mercy lord and receive what we have need of know that these needs that were spoken and those that were unspoken are serious needs lord the needs that we don't even know about the lord you know all things and for the foundation of the world you made the way so lord we thank you that you've already met these needs give us faith to believe lord open our eyes that we could see you and walk with you father today pray that you would have the total preeminence in every part of this service lord move aside anything that would hinder the moving of your spirit any sin and unbelief lord forgive us and just help us to worship you in spirit and truth lord bless the speaker and the hearer both that we could be anointed and that you would change our lives lord change our minds and our hearts and make us ready for your soon come and help us to love you more and each other more with you all things are possible we thank you for it lord in jesus name amen amen while he was talking about his tire this past week i was on the other service tech was on vacation so i drove a little over 600 miles in town just crisscrossing and going down i 19 towards sawadee i had a blowout on the company truck at about 70 miles an hour and we're able to get off the road safely and then got the jack out got everything ready and found out that the tire iron that they come with the truck doesn't fit the nug bolts so i sat there for two and a half hours and uh but i was safe and i thank the lord for that sometimes uh we get frustrated maybe we get upset we wonder but god has a reason for those things you know he sees way beyond what so we appreciate that and we just want to be grateful and thankful that god has been so amen jesus i just want to thank you thank you for being so good how many would say that today jesus i just want to thank you oh jesus i just want to thank you jesus i just want to thank you thank you for being so good i want to praise you lord yes jesus i just want to praise you jesus i just want to bring jesus i just want to praise you praise you for being so good i want to thank you yes jesus i just want to thank you [Music] jesus i just want to thank you jesus i just want to thank you thank you for being so good you may be seated i would like to read something to you for those of you that knew the mcgoy family billy was the sister mcgoy's son and he's up in in oregon in a correctional facility and he wrote something to honor his mother and he sent it to me to us we got it this week and he just asked if we could read it so a tribute to his mom so i'm going to read that he said king solomon said that a virtuous woman was worth far more than rubies my mother's birthstone was sapphire second only to diamonds in the foundation of the new jerusalem he said she ariseth while is yet night and giveth meat to her household he said i remember her getting up every morning without fail to leave at 4 30 a.m she wouldn't get back until 5 30 or sometimes even later proverbs 31 18 says her candle goeth not out by night if there was ever a strike or an office to clean or if someone needed typing done she was eager to do it for the extra money and through it all she was her own built-in daycare it said verse 28 in proverbs she says there says that her children arise up and call her blessed in verse 30 a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised she says because of what she instilled in me there is very little i cannot do from driving semis to flying airplanes to being a certified welder certified firefighter emt to building houses from the ground up i would all do her can-do attitude looking back i have never met anyone with more faith i like how he puts this was she perfect not hardly was she at least a perfect mother not by a long shot was she a good mother no she was a great mother she was one of the greatest i believe that ever lived everything my mother did was to ensure that we were protected and provided for i never realized until years later how much she silently endured gladly for us what a great job she did raising five kids on her her own i heard her say once say she said i don't care what you do to me but don't you dare mess with my kids she told me that little boys didn't come with instruction manuals and if she has it to do over again there was a lot of things she would do differently that got me to thinking for being a self-taught parent without oprah or dr phil youtube or any other know-it-alls i think she did a great fine job sometimes it's us sitting back on this side later and looking and saying boy what a blessing we did have and maybe we didn't esteem them enough treasure them enough love them like we should and it's always in hindsight that we see that but it's good to hear somebody speak of their mother that way so the more i reflect the more i realize what a wise loving and all-around good woman she was i pray every day for wisdom and knowledge joy and strength and peace because by her example i know such can be had integrity integrity is doing the right thing when no one is looking the person you saw at church or out in the public was the exact same person you saw at our house so much so in fact that we kids were genuinely surprised and confused when we encountered contradictions in others he says imagine what a world we'd be living in if we were all half the person she was i was truly i was truly blessed to have known betty jane ramey mcgoy and doubly blessed to call her mother it hurts every time i realize that that not only will i not see her talk to her or see or laugh or hear her laugh again we all we all know she lives in the world but she know we all now live in a world where she no longer exists other than the memories of those who live life she's touch and without her it's a dark world again it's one of those things that we realize after and i remember brother green would tell us many times appreciate those love them treat especially he would tell us as young people with our parents and but to hear a testimony like that is a whole lot better than hearing some of the testimonies that we've but to hear a christian mother a godly mother who did so much on them again they asked we would read that and i said we would do that so i appreciate every one of you being here this morning and sister rachel who's that young man there next to you oh it's enoch so good good to see him home here and good to have each one of you back so amen he paid a debt he did not owe and i owe the debt i could not pay i'm so glad he paid it on [Music] and now i sing a brand christ jesus [Music] paid a debt on calvary he cleansed my soul he set me free i'm glad that jesus did all [Music] christ jesus [Music] one day he's coming back for me to live with a brand new song amazing grace all day christ jesus made it let's sing that verse one more time one day he's coming back for me to live with him to see him on that day i then will sing a brand new song amazing grace jesus [Music] amen what a day we have brother plitt's family with us and i volunteered them to say oh i asked them if they would sing and they they said they would so if they would prepare brother peter i don't know maybe the microphones have them set up for them it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning i know there are many of those that would love to be i was listening to i forget where i was listening but they were said there were some folks that had been two or three years that they had been able to gather in a place of fellowship and sometimes we take for granted being able to come and appreciate the lord allowing that so he wanted to sing too but so he did his own solo on the way out there so god bless you it's always good to be down here with our family in tucson we were driving yesterday into town and there was this man walking right in the middle of the road and i thought god have mercy and if not for grace that's where i would be and i pray the song will be a blessing because this is the words to this song and i just felt like you know you look at these people on this earth and the ill-famed woman and the different ones the drug addict and and it's just by his grace that any of us make it and that we're here sitting in this pew this morning instead of the in their place god bless you [Music] where would i be [Music] a hopeless case an empty place [Music] amazing grace how sweet i once a was case an empty place [Music] oh grace grace grace that will pardon and cleanse grace god's grace grace that is greater [Music] where would i be you only know i'm glad you see through eyes of love a hopeless case just an empty place if not for grace and get with us where would i be you only know i'm glad you see [Music] through eyes of love just a hopeless case an empty place if not for grace a hopeless case an empty place if not for grace sometimes i wonder if we even realize what his grace is to us how many times he's watched over us and kept us and protect us that we're not even aware of but you know the thing about is you never you never draw so much there's nothing left there's always more amen amazing grace how sweet the sound it's safe brother branham called that the bride song because she knows it's by his grace [Music] our [Music] but now i'm was blind but now i see [Music] that taught my heart to fear and disgrace my fears how precious did that grace [Music] day [Music] i have already come disgrace that's brought me saves us when we've been there ten [Music] we know [Music] big praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god god praise praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] praise god praise god when we get to the other side it's how did you get him by the grace of god by god's mercy and his love amen and you can't exhaust that grace as he's saying it's a marvelous grace it's an unending grace brother branham talks about that little fish in the ocean saying i better just just just drink and breathe sparingly lest i use it all up but i'm glad that his grace is unending because i need it every day i need it daily so i thank him for it amen of course i forget the title of the song [Music] lord i lift your name [Music] oh you're the great [Music] [Applause] let's try the verses with a song [Music] oh lord so far [Music] is [Music] lord i live your name your holy oh [Music] my comforter [Music] to be filled with a spirit [Music] to be afraid [Music] lord i live your name your holy [Music] i [Music] and one more time with the chorus [Music] you're the greatest [Music] my comforter [Music] he's everything he's all amen when whatever you have need of i think sometimes what could you approach god with and say lord can you do this but he's already met that need already think just the simple things when he said he knows every bird he knows every sparrow and he knows when they fall tells peter go to that fish and get that coin and go pay the tax is do he's the great almighty god and he's my king he's my comforter he's my illinois this morning we have brother reggie plead with us come down from flagstaff they came down yesterday evening preparing his heart and i know the lord this past week i was telling my wife i said just some things that that i've been reading and hearing just blessing my heart and i said brother ed you'll preach them this morning i'm sure it's just same how god does us one after another's come and just fed us and it's just been a continuation i said it's better than having this side preach and somebody else and coming and preaching this side seems totally opposite unless on this side he's preaching the god of fire and judgment and on this side he's preaching to god of mercy because he's the same god and i said sometimes you need both but i trust that you're believing and expecting and drawing and so lord you know my need you know my doctor let's stand as brother reggie comes out i don't want to to make him feel like he's rushed or anything but just whatever god has put in his heart amen maybe just with a a raised hand right now you would say lord you know what my need is you know why i'm here and you know why brother reggie came today and what you would speak to our hearts can you believe that so i know yesterday i sent him a text i said are you in town and everything okay and he said yes i said and we're trusting that the lord would give you something to minister to us amen appreciate the grace of god amen that chorus one more time lord i lift your name lord i lift your name your holy [Music] i am [Music] um amen i trust this morning he's all that to you good to be in the house of the lord thank you all for coming out honoring the resurrection this morning certainly happy to know that we serve a risen god not not somebody we're waiting for to to rise again but he's already risen and he sent back his spirit to live in men and women today that the world might be drawn unto him amen god bless you i trust you know what day it is as i heard the brother talking about the grace of god and the songs about the grace of god and i thought about that scripture for by grace ye are saved through faith and that not of yourselves but of god who gave that freely today is reformation day today is the day that it was proclaimed to the catholic church the just shall live by faith amen i believe that it's the grace of god that that gift of salvation was given to us and it's by your faith that you believe that and you receive that and you draw the benefits from it amen good to see each and every one i thought i heard brother peter mcfadden praying was that not brother pete that was brother peter god bless you brother peter we thought you were maybe not going to be here this morning but it's good to see you and our good friend brother david fritz is that is that who i see here god bless you good good to have you in the house of the lord fellowship with us this morning if you have your bibles and you'd like to turn with me i'm sure i'm sure you could guess where we'll be reading from the book of hebrews and i just want you to know that this was totally unintentional that we're reading from the book of hebrews this morning i was had determined in my heart i'm i'm going to let these poor people alone and not uh you know i i when i hear brother brandon i'm telling that story about that sister who finally he'd preached for i think he said six months on job she said brother brandon when are you going to get job off the ash heap and he said he'd been preaching on it so long and i feel like maybe you all are wondering brother when are we going to move on to paul preaching to the romans or something but this was unintentional we the family and i had listened to a tape together and it just so happened that these scriptures that we're about to read were the very same scriptures brother branham used and and well praise the lord hebrews chapter 10 and we're going to read just verses 19 through 21 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of god amen let's just bow our heads together as we approach the author of this word our precious heavenly father lord we are so happy god to receive the grace of god in our lives lord to have heard your word in this hour lord where would we be without your grace lord we'd be wandering about lord in darkness stumbling lord wondering perhaps what our purpose was but god you are so gracious to us that you allowed the word of god to fall upon our ears and lord when you begin to reveal yourself to us through revelation god how that we begin to recognize the day and age in which we live lord who we are and who you are and lord the relationship we have with you and lord this great big family of god and that great big plan of redemption and oh lord jesus it's such a beautiful thing and we're so blessed lord blessed above millions god to have heard it and lord we would just ask that as we call upon the name of jesus christ this morning we ask that you would come and do the same thing that you did lord when you walked the shores of galilee that lord you would do the same thing this morning that you did so many years ago lord when your prophet was here and preaching the word of god just the truth and lord it was able to set the captive free it was able to open the eyes of the blind and to let the the lame walk again and god the dumb to speak and the death to hear lord it's enough to do it again today we believe that lord we would ask that you would do the same for those that have a need this morning lord i pray that the whole purpose of us coming here standing behind this sacred desk is to lord preach the truth preach the word spirit and truth so that lord if your children would be bound by any circumstance if they'd be bound by sickness if they'd be bound by sin or lord just oppression of the enemy i pray that as these words would go forward that god you'd set them free that lord your children would be able to stand up and look up and realize that redemption draws nigh and i pray lord god that you would send your ministering angels up and down each and every pew every ayah lord touch those that would be sick lord as each one begins to think lord upon the need that they have i pray that as the word of god is preached that they would by faith reach out and say that's for me that god that's for me i believe that that that god today is my day of salvation would you grant it to him heavenly father we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you can be seated today i'd like to uh for a title i i would call this the secret life of a believer and if there's anybody here who's maybe a guest who has never been here before maybe you're coming in you uh maybe a little skeptical uh about uh this church or the or the christian life maybe you feel like oh i just came in right out the right sermon i'd like to know what is the secret life of the believer i knew there was i knew there had to be there had to be they had to have a secret life and you're correct and i'm going to talk about the secret life of a believer this morning and lord willing we'll see we'll keep our our eye on the time i don't want to hold you very long there's some beautiful things that brother branham said he left us that if we have time i'd like to get to but i thought well if a believer has a secret life what maybe we'll just look at the life of of just an individual and i begin to think about uh what would the what would a secret life of an unbeliever look like and maybe for some of us who've maybe been in the way long enough now you're going to have to go back in your mind and think well when i was not serving the lord what kind of a life was i living i don't like for any of us to have to dwell on that but maybe it'll be able help you to be able to reach out to a sinner to somebody who is yet to know the grace of god i thought the secret life of an unbeliever might look something like this they uh they've been taught to get an education they've been taught to go into the world and and achieve the the best they can and and then perhaps they have seen the life of other unbelievers and they were drawn to well the pleasures of life for an unbeliever whatever that would be but they know to be successful they see that that life of pleasure and where it leads might not be conducive to a great career and so when they're chasing their career they know that that somebody successful in a career life looks a certain way there may be a certain image that is portrayed for a successful person in this world whether that be man or woman but there's things in their life that they can't bring into that professional world and so they have a secret life that's on the side it's it's something that they keep back for after the career after work is over they've got the secret life the secret life for an unbeliever may be a life of alcoholism it may be a life of drug addiction maybe a life of stealing or dishonesty maybe a a life of of of dishonesty from family or any relationship that they might build with more than one individual i don't want to draw this picture too big because i think you understand what i'm what i say when i talk about the secret life of an unbeliever and then they show back up to work and they want that secret life to remain a secret and so they do the best they can to keep that from the world and and this world has picked up on that especially in the day and age we live in they've created even ways of technology to help to help that secret life to help you hide that secret life the best that you can hide and and so they even the most successful people talk about this addiction to social media these dopamine kicks that people are getting uh from from from uh sources like facebook and instagram and the secret life of the unbeliever they they take the best they they go somewhere and they take the best picture they can of themselves and then they stick a filter on it and so that it looks even better than than what it or what what it was while they were there and they put they had this smile on the picture and so everybody is thinking they've got the greatest life that a person can have and perhaps that picture and that that image is only something to mask what's in their hidden life and that is sorrow and that is despair and that is loneliness and that is a life filled with questions and a life filled with turmoil and hurt a life filled with addictions that they cannot seem to overcome and they make sayings like fake it till you make it just fake it till you make it you think my what a what a life and it may even seem like a life but eventually it catches up and maybe somebody told that person you need to find religion and that the ultimate life is to have a life you know you've got your career life you've got your life that is your business and the pleasures of life but you need to you need to have god in your life it's one of those things that you know they well it used to be that politicians that was one element that they always had to have in their repertoire was what is there what is their faith what is it that they believe now that seems to be going away more and more as time goes on it doesn't seem to be as important for a politician to proclaim what it is that they believe but we do still see it yet today and here in america in our elections and so forth uh where do they go to church what do they proclaim and and uh what what faith are they and it was really big this last election i think they were pointing out that uh joe biden the second catholic president so he he prescribes to the catholic faith and and whether he does or whether he doesn't he's going to put it on his on his resume that he's a catholic and he wants the nation to know that and i think donald trump i think he proclaimed he was a presbyterian i think that was his what he his claim to fame and he couldn't even recall scriptures properly but he was a presbyterian he wanted the world to know that and so now we see what maybe the secret life of a make believer would look like the secret life of a make-believer they have their life their career they have their jobs they they they do all the same things they they they want to do the best that they can to have a family but they have their church life as well the main believer he's going to go to church and and he's he's going to sit in the pew and he's going to go to the events and he's going to go to the potlucks and make believers going to show up to all the events and he'll follow along just as everybody else does and when he comes into church and you say oh brother so and so how are you the answer is always fine very fine very good how are you but when he leaves church when sunday's over maybe he comes to the midweek service if they're if there's a midweek service but when monday comes there's a different life a different life than what was on sunday sunday is a sunday sunday has its own it has its own day it has its own set of rules it has its own life to it and then the rest of the week follows another brother branham preached sermons like investments and he was speaking to the full gospel businessmen and one of the things that he really really where the rubber met the road when he got down to it he said now if you're a businessman you got no business being behind the pulpit you if you don't have a call in your life and he wasn't saying that you can't be a businessman and a and a minister but what he was saying was if you're not called to the ministry and you're simply a businessman and you feel that you can apply business ethics to a calling in god you're you're playing on dangerous ground because you're a successful businessman that means you'll all automatically be a successful minister brother branham was pointing out very clearly that those are two very separate things and he would say why is it that i hear you christians saying i've got this many cadillacs well i've got this many this and god must be blessing me he said you can't ever compare yourself to the people of the world you'll never be able to compete when it comes to having things of the world you'll never be able to compete with the world and why would you but that's what this life looks like for a make-believer but when we look at the secret life of a believer what does it look like now these scriptures that i read here in hebrews chapter 10. they come brother branham read these scriptures and use them in a message called a hidden life in christ brother branham takes these scriptures here and and we look at what the context of these scriptures are what paul is speaking about paul is taking again and this is maybe a little bit of rehearsal from where we've been before but paul is taking the illustration of the old testament levitical priesthood and he's showing how that god showed moses by vision how to pattern the tabernacle in the wilderness then not just the tabernacle but the clothing that the priests were to wear the the the materials the the certain types of wood that were to be used in not only the building of the tabernacle but also the furniture that was to go inside the tabernacle and there were certain types of wood to be used and then there was certain types of metal to be used even as just a ring to hang a curtain on it was to be made of a certain specific type of metal and many of these things we we realize as we read the scripture and thank god we had a prophet come who pointed us to the scripture and then showed us even by even by other men who had studied the word of god had recognized that wood was a type of humanity that wood represents mankind and different woods represent different things and brother branham does a beautiful illustration of this when he preaches a message i believe the message the ark and he talks about how that uh when when when god showed noah how went that to go build the ark that he was to go get gopher wood to build the ark and that gopher wood was like a balsa wood it was it was very porous it would have been made a horrible boat because it would just absorb the water and then sink right away but he told him to get that type of wood to represent us because we're to be very porous and the reason we're to be porous is because then he had to go get an evergreen a tree that was green all year round representing christ jesus christ that he was to be life everlasting that he was green all the time there was always life life abundant in jesus christ and that he was to cut down that evergreen just as jesus christ was to be cut down how that he was his life was to be taken and that noah was to take the sap the life of the tree and he was to pour that sap heat it up and pour it into that gopher wood so that it would absorb the sap the very life of the evergreen tree and we realize that that is an absolute perfect type a perfect shadow of a believer being emptied out having nothing to offer god but when god offers his life you're to suck it up to be filled with that evergreen life to be filled with it and when you are then that boat not only does it float but brother branham said it was like iron that it was strong it was able to withstand those waves that would come crushing against the boat and that is what the holy ghost does for a believer is when the trials come when the tribulations come it's not so much that god has made you impermeable to the things of the world but the life that he put within you is able to absorb the blows even though it hurts when you get hit with the trials even though it hurts when you get hit with the tribulations the life of christ in you is able to when you want to say i give up or when you want to say i'm gonna i'm gonna get angry here the life of christ takes over and you find yourself acting in a way that's so different than what you naturally would do it's the life of christ that's doing that and so we see that that moses having these different types of wood overlaid in deity overlaid in gold or or in silver and and and brass and things like that of that nature he shows god shows moses this pattern for not only the tabernacle not only the clothing and and and even the ephod and that urim and thumb that the high priests and were supposed to wear but he takes the actual office of a high priest he then shows moses you're going to set up a priesthood and there's going to be a high priest and then there will be other priests under him but there will be one high priest and he's showing him this high priest and that on again on that day of atonement that once a year that the high priest not all of the other priests but only the high priest could go in to what we call the holiest of holies so we had the outer courts and and that's where the the congregation would bring in their sacrifices and there would be the brazen altar and and and the laver to wash then we had the the holy place and in there that's now going inside that building and it's like that first portion of that building and in there is the shoe bread on the table 12 pieces of bread two stacks of six bread on the table and then on the other side the candle sticks and those priests were to go in there not just the high priest but the priests could go in there they could eat of that bread and they had to make sure that those candles were constantly lit because they could smoke up and they could go out so they had to continually make sure that they were lit but behind that curtain inside that room then was behind that was the holiest of holies the holiest place and in there was the ark of the covenant and that was the box that had the tablets of of moses that had the ten commandments had the rod of aaron and it had an omer of of manna in it and the high priest could go in there once a year to atone for the sins of himself his family and for the congregation for the people in this message a hidden life in christ says now of course we know that god dwelt in all three of those places he was out there he was out there where the congregation was he lit the fire for the altar he was there with those people and and and and representing in that that that washing laver washing uh that the waters of separation there to wash the animal to clean it god's god's in that god's a part of that and then we go into that first portion where there's the the shoe bread what they called would be considered a a portion of the bread of life uh god's in that the candle sticks god's in that but brother branham says but we want to talk about the place where he where he was abiding and that was in the holiest of holies where the shekinah glory resided over that mercy seat we understand that we're we we get the imagery to that random often takes that to represent to us the three stages of grace justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and how that all three stages god is in that god it is god that brings you to that justification that just shall live by faith it is god that does that that is the grace that is an act of grace by god to us to even to to even reach down into the mud and pick us up out of the miry clay that's an act of god and then the sanctification part of it god cleaning the the things out of our life and my that you'll never get away from that as a believer you'll never get away from that sanctifying power god is continually cleaning us that never stops that never stops many a times we find there's still things that we hang on to in our life maybe it's a tradition maybe it's a complex maybe it's something that we picked up from a long time ago or that we seem to have made a habit in our life and we know god it's i maybe and maybe you think it's a great thing but later in life perhaps you realize it might be hindering me from going further with god and so we say god not my will but thy will be done take that thing away from me and you and and and you know you know as well as i do you've tried yourself to do it but you realize it's going to take god in the tender hand of jehovah who knows better than i do how to take that thing away as long as you're willing god knows when and god knows where and god knows how to do that sometimes it takes a fuller's brush to do it and that's some corn cob brush scrubbing and it will really take the hide off of you it'll it'll bring you to a place of humiliation it'll bring you to a place like a new birth again and you go oh my god that was rough that was you really dealt rough with me on that but he knew he had to he knew he had to to get that off of there some of these some washings they don't just come off with just with just running your hands under the water sometimes it takes some real working to get some of that grime off god knows and so what paul is showing here getting back to our text is that even the representation of the high priest going into that place called the holiest of holies paul says it right here in verse 19 excuse me verse 20 by a new and living way which he hath consecrated talking about jesus christ that he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh now paul is giving the hebrews those who know about the old testament and know about the high priest going in behind the veil paul is letting them know that this man jesus not just the surface things not just the the breaking of the bread and and and and the multiplying of the bread and the fishes and and the healing of the sick that you all admired that about jesus you all admired that but behind that veil of that man tabernacled god himself he wasn't just a prophet he wasn't just a good man that was god in flesh that it was god himself he didn't send a second or third person of a trinity to come and die for your sins god himself built himself a body and came and dwelt inside that body and he the blood of jesus christ was the very blood of god that saves you that cleanses you it's not just the blood of a jew it's not just the blood of a gentile or samaritan it's not just the blood of some man this was the very blood of god and it's a very real subject and when the believer catches that and sees the revelation that this was none other than god jesus was not just another man was not just as as perhaps the jehovah's witness would say he was a good teacher he was a prophet no no he was god and this demonstration is speaking about the day of atonement when the high priest would go into that holiest of holies and and and no doubt everybody knows who he is he doesn't just show up on the day of atonement he's there every day but he's doing a certain act on that day but on every day everybody knows him you know rather so and so god bless you how are you it's good to see you yes good how are you how are the children how is life how are things oh brother let us talk if i could tell you the things you always come into my house i'll share with you you know and they and they commune they talked they knew wasn't a stranger he knows about unbelievers he knows about what an unbeliever life is like he's meeting him he's out there he's traveling with them through the he's wandering with them just like everybody they got to pack up the the tabernacle and they got to go they got to follow the cloud and follow the pillar of fire he's right with them he's meeting these other nations he's meeting them he's coming up against it he's a part of that too and then he knows about the make believer he knows about the things that happen in church he hears the stories like everybody else hears the stories going around in church he's meeting with the people brother how are you oh that things are good brother you're good and he's going uh-huh yeah i heard i know you say things are good but i know i know how things really are i'm wondering i have a quote here brother branham now goes into this i don't know if the brothers can pull this up or not i'll read it with you notice every year the high priest entered into that place the congregation followed him up when he went into this great place where the veil dropped behind him the inner courts the holiest of holies no one dared to go after him then he was alone with god what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters into with christ dead to the things of the world hid away with god and the veils dropped down around and all the worlds shut off then christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer today people just have enough religion to make them miserable knowing that they ought to do this they're trying to escape hell well if the way if that's the way i felt about it brother i don't know what i would do oh get in with christ shut off from the things of the world for to commune with him is a pleasure it's beautiful it's something that fills and satisfies the soul something that gives you peace that passes all understanding all the crosses become flying wings all the burdens are chariot wheels oh you can fly away my burdens are light yoke up with him the yoke is all padded with hallelujahs when you're once inside the veil with him he becomes your life this is a glimpse into the secret life of a believer if the world they're always wanting to know well i got a secret life and and i've been to churches i've seen the make believers i've seen their secret life i know what that's like but what's your secret come on come on you live this way all the time i mean come on where's it at let me see the secret life if you want to see the secret life of a believer this is what it is they experience the same troubles they experience the same tribulation they've got to go through all the same places both those people go to they're out there it's not like it's not like you you don't know about what's going on in the world it's not like you're just ignorant and oblivious to the things that are going on in this world you're very aware of the things of this world you're so aware you're tempted by the same things they're tempted by god didn't didn't didn't uh you know excuse you from temptations oh no no no no you're just as human as they are you're just as tempted as they are you've got the same emotions they've got and you know what it is you know these things but you know a secret place that when all of the troubles when all of the buzz when all of the the noise and the things of the world when it all comes in on you there's a place you can go where the curtain closes behind you and that is shut off from you the cares of the world they go away and you in that place when you come out you come out renewed and it's like what was behind there exactly what is it that you're doing behind there what are you doing in this secret place that the world is wanting to know what is going on in there you're aging it's not a fountain of youth it's not like coronado you found the cup of coronado you know and you found this this this bubbling water that you're drinking and it's keeping you young even though we we'd love that right we would love that but it's not keeping us young we're growing old just like the rest we got the wrinkles to show it and you know we've got the the limps and the things to show the world and they're going okay well that's not it it's not like you've it's not like you're living a healthier life than me what is it you have learned that when all the pressures of the things that cannot be seen the forces that cannot be seen the pressures that come into your life that are not physical they're spiritual that you know about that there's a realm that is coming against you that is coming against the world the world has no explanation for that but you know because you've read and you've experienced that you're facing powers and principalities and you go into this place and when that veil drops behind you it's you and god it's just you and him and in there in there is manna there's manna that doesn't get old and you begin eating on that manna and it and it brings your blood sugar back up so that you're not just coming out swinging with hanger issues you're satisfied you're sustained you can go into that place into a prayer closet you can go in there with i know what i want to do i know what i want to answer i know if i have it my way this is what i do and many a times you come out with not my will but thy will be done lord and your answer seems to be surprisingly different than what you thought it was going to be it's different for your husband it's different for your wife it's different for your children it's different for at work it's different for your family it's different for your parents it's different than the answer you thought you were going to give them it's a secret place and there's a secret life in there brandon takes some time and he in this message he he says you live in a three-bedroom house he says now you may say no mine's eight bedrooms he says but i beg to differ it's three bedrooms every house is simply comprised of three three rooms the kitchen the living room and the bedroom now all the people probably under 50 would say we have a bathroom well there was a day when the bathrooms were about 150 yards outside of the house and you had to go you had to you had to take the lantern and you had to go find the bathroom so a bathroom is just simply an accessory it's just leisure it's nice to have them thank god that that they're no longer you know have the moon cut in the doors but really a house is is is really made up of those three rooms the kitchen the living room and the bedroom and he finally comes down and he says you know the kitchen is where you eat that's where you're gonna go and he says it's like it's like for the unbeliever who comes right off the street they're they're coming into the kitchen they're coming into the place where we're all going to come to hear the word of god we're all coming pulling up to the table of god and we're all going to eat the same food that's delivered to us from the word of god we're all eating of that and it's a good place to be we love the kitchen some of us would would argue it's our favorite room in the house but then he says there's the parlor he calls it the parlor or the living room and this is where you have fellowship now this is outside of this this building here this is outside of these pews this is this is out in our homes this is out at the restaurant this is now where we're having fellowship with believers we've accepted we've received the word we've received the food and then we go to digest it together and we begin talking and saying now what does that mean when it says this now i'm an unbeliever and then and i i'm using this as an illustration and i've i've heard i came to church and i heard these words but i have no understanding i need fellowship so that i can see a real life interpretation of what i heard i'd like to know is this real today i know the bible says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever show me show me is that real you say it's real tell me brother sit down it's time sister sit down it's testimony time let me tell you about a real live god today that's the part of the room but that third room is the bedroom and that's a place not everybody's allowed to just walk mosey on in and go to that's the secret place that's a place of rest brother branham says a place of rest it's the place where the veil drops behind you its rest from the trials and tribulations its rest from the buzz of the world its rest to revitalize and prepare for an eternal rest this secret life of a believer now is not a once a year thing like the high priest it's an everyday thing it's an everyday thing that on calvary when jesus died and that veil in the temple was rent from top to bottom it was allowing us to know he made an access he made a way for us to become kings and priests that now we have free access by the baptism of the holy ghost we have free access into that place on a daily basis that the sacrifice has been made that the blood is there for atonement that you now can go in there and you can atone every day every minute every second if you'd like to you can go in there and you can apply the blood of jesus christ for you for your house for your friends for your loved ones you can apply the blood of jesus christ and say god mercy mercy god show them the way god give them the way god let them come into this same place that i'm in bring them into this secret place god it's a daily life this is a secret life and it's it's it's it's daily and and more and more on brothers and sisters as this world every every roll of the sun every turn of the earth i find that i we need to go in there more and more and more the the the buzz seems to get louder the the the things that come across your way that are flash that are pushed in your face are enough that you can say mercy god oh mercy god i i i can't believe the what the the things i'm hearing i can't believe the things i'm seeing i've got to go to a place where where it makes sense where i've got rest where where there's sanity and you go and you drop that veil behind you and you say i don't need to get caught up in all of that i don't need to i don't need to be involved in that i don't need to put in my two cents on those matters this is the life that i belong to this is the place where i belong and you you when you enter into that presence when you've gone in behind that veil and the love of god and the life of christ seems to just be there it amazes me more and more with every tape i put on i go oh god that is so right oh it's so real it's so what i believe every time i sit down and i open my bible and i begin to read i say oh god this is what i believe this is what i want to feed upon and i believe that when we have a life a daily secret life with him that when you when we have a life where this is a daily process it's just part of our nature to go into that place you turn the news you say well i want to hear the news for the day you turn it on and you go oh my this world's falling apart and you turn it off and you say i'd better go back into that place you go into that place you clear your mind you clear your heart then you say all right it's off to work then you go to work and you meet people and they just you just can't believe the things that the disregard for for for a believer the disregard the disrespect for and and you get done with work and and and you got these people and they're frustrated they're mad at the world and and you got these people and they're frustrated and they're mad at the world and you get home from work and there's your beautiful family and you say i've got to just i've got to go into a secret place here before i go in talk to my family and you go into that secret place so that you can clear your heart so that you can clear your mind so that you can have a home life that's conducive for a believer and not for all that you just went through the last eight ten hours and when this is a daily process this secret life it's culminating it's a building it's a strengthening for that secret and sudden going away of the church in the rapture message brother branham uses these scriptures in his opening scriptures psalms 27 and he reads verses 1 through 5 and it says the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though when host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock what an interesting scripture to read for a subject of the rapture but it makes sense because one of these days we're getting out of here we're getting out of this place and he's going to secretly take us away and hide us in a place where there's only peace forevermore where we're permanently for all the rest of eternity in the presence of god it's the secret of his tabernacle now later on in that message brother branham it's within i believe the first 30 minutes of that message brother branham uses these scriptures and and the reason he does is because he he starts the message asking the question how many believe there's going to be a rapture and he takes those first 30 minutes of that message to to build the faith of the believer and to build the faith of anybody that will believe that there is going to be a rapture and he and he he's wanting to show you it's scriptural that we know the word rapture isn't in the bible but what we're speaking about is the catching away of the church that that that that changing of uh in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall be changed and that the dead in christ shall rise first and we shall meet them in the air on that day of the rapture but he wants you to know it's scriptural you can base that belief that there's going to be a rapture on the word of god it's not just something that you could say well i i believe it i don't have any foundation for it but it's just something that i simply believe that's what the world is going on right now well i believe this well then your your idea is just as good as the next but this is founded upon the eternal word of god this is founded and so when you say i i believe there's going to be a day when jesus christ himself the body of christ is going to come back to earth and we will be changed if i'm alive my body will be changed if i've gone in the grave i'm coming up that day is coming i believe it and i believe that i've got a foundation to believe it but brother i'm in those first 30 minutes says there will be doubters of that there will be scoffers of what you say you believe and he reads here in second peter chapter 3 and i'm going to read verses 3 and 4 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation so rest assured little bride there will be scoffers in the last day in the day when the rapture will come there will be people that say where where i don't see it i don't see it where yeah i know i've heard that i've heard that oh you believe what oh you believe what paul believes well guess what paul's dead oh you believe what some of these dead saints well they're dead well they're all dead you still believe that they're scoffers they say there's nothing to this there's nothing to this bible there's nothing to this message there's nothing to it that's a scoffer i want to read you something from the sudden secret going away of the church brother branham says people live today as though just before the coming of the lord jesus if he's going to send a host of angels down to all the newspapers and and for a year so announce it throughout all the world in the newspaper that on such and such a date jesus will arrive and to have it broadcast by the radio and put on the televisions and everywhere just the day and just the hour that he was coming now that's the way people live today but god has said in his word that it would be like a thief in the night coming if that would be so people would say as the world thinks today oh well there's just plenty of time it'll be well announced and but you see it is announced but it's a secret announcing it's just those who are willing to hear it those who are willing to consider it and who loves the lord if this secret life is an everyday life for you then when that secret coming comes you'll be a part of that you'll be there you've already been living you've already been living in that presence you've already been you've already been talking you've already you've already been in fellowship you've already you've you're like joseph's bride who's back in the temple he's coming in there to talk to you you know you know his heart you know what he says you desire to know it you've searched it you've sought it you you're seeking it he he's he's showed himself faithful every time i wonder if the brothers could pull this up i'm closing with this brother branham finishes the sermon the secret the sudden secret going away of the church i'm just going to read it with you right here you know the story but just listen to the language that brother branham uses and keep in your mind this idea of this secret life and that this secret life one day it's culminating it's building to a secret coming it's on one of those ranches where the great packing companies buy their cattle run them into the mountains and then bring them out after calves are born in the fall of the year and brand them and sell off some of the old herd and the steers and so forth and go ahead into the accumulate their great herds of cattle and on this certain ranch the owner of the caretaker what we call there the top the foreman he had about five daughters they were all beautiful women young single and there was a little lady there which was a cousin of these girls that her father and mother had both deceased and she was brought over there to be to live with her her uncle and those girls they was in those fancy type of frilly frocks you know and they just took this poor little girl and they just treated her like she was some animal all the hard work poured right on her she washed the dishes she cleaned up she fixed the bunks she had to do it all and they just stayed around with polished fingernails and manicures and stuff on their lips and all fixed up you know just prissy and especially did they do this when they heard that from chicago the big packing company who owned the outfit his young single son was coming to visit the ranch oh did they dyke out in all good clothes ah did they dress and make ready for his coming and each night the conversation would be they were going to vamp this young man and marry him who would and they would own the ranch themselves for the sun would fall air to all so they made themselves ready so you see there is a ready to be made you make yourself ready by joining church or something that ain't all that's required you got to have oil in your lamp see just your dressing say we'll build a big church we'll belong to a better denomination we'll get a little pipe organ to the lord we'll make plush seats that isn't what god requires righteousness is what god requires in his son jesus christ jesus that's the garments for the bible said the white clothes which she is adorned in is the righteousness of this of the saints so she these girls thought they would make themselves ready for the coming of this young man course that poor little cousin that reminds me of an offcast somewhere you could appreciate her she was a beautiful woman but oh my she was a nice little girl but she was not even considered among them not as a relative now that's about the true picture of the real church today before the denominations not even considered a bunch of inner denominationals a bunch of outcasts so the poor little fella just went ahead working when the young man arrived they didn't know it but he come looking for a wife he was sick and tired of the city girls who just stayed all dolled up and oh you know hung around the bar rooms and rode around in the cadillacs and the different things they were just sick and tired of it he thought i'll go out west and hunt me a real girl that'll be a real mother to my babies and somebody will not hang at all the sewing circles and the societies and things but will just be a real mother what did he find when he got there but the same thing that he had condemned in chicago i wonder if the lord jesus will find a church just a denomination just by name a church no oil in the lamps not ready to go oh they got fine frocks they got the biggest churches the biggest this and all these things but god don't want that he wants you as an individual they may have the best pastors they may have the finest deacon boards but he wants you with oil he's coming to catch that oil and bride away and as he this boy looked upon them he was disheartened and that night they were having something in the or on the order in them days it's been long ago they called the charleston which is just like a rock and roll and they were going to throw one of those big parties many of you people remember that old charleston dance they did back when i was a kid when i was out there and so they were all had their little black and white clothes on you know to do the oh it was called the charleston's and black bottom that's what they were calling and they had them two-tone clothes and they were going to do these dances but this boy was sick of that stuff he was hunting for a real girl so he slipped out of their party he was watching them he went in to look at them so is another son that i know of another son will come to your church he'll son of god he'll come there he'll look around he'll see your fine dress he'll know that you're a good member but he's looking for something different from just the regular trend of church so as he looked around after a while he was so discouraged he walked out the door and going back walking in the moonlight towards the bunk house he heard somebody kind of humming and he looked around and here went this little girl with a great big pan of dishwater way in the night barefooted to throw the dishwater out and as soon as he saw her something another said that's her that's the one so he put herself in the way and when she that's when she come back along the corral fence why he was standing there and she almost fainted oh i like that he put himself in the way he made sure you'd run into him he said how you do and he said what's your name and she told him her name and it was the same name of the boss of the ranch said then i can't understand how that this is that your father said no i'm just a cousin you see my father and he were brothers i've got the same name but i that's the boss you might have the name of the of church you might have the name of branham tabernacle or methodist or whatever church you go that isn't it friend see it's something different it's your character that's what god is looking at you might be methodist you might be baptist you might be presbyterian it's not that it's character that god looks at not just earthly character but holy spirit character these signs shall follow them that believe said jesus in the 16th chapter of saint mark she was so gotten that that he would speak to her even grace and she hung her little head down and she ran into the house he was there for a week or two and he looked all around everywhere and he never said no more but he kept watching her and the night before he left he was to leave the next morning they was throwing another big party and he watched for her he couldn't find her he knowed she'd had to do the dishes and so forth so the dirty work and all could be throwed off and that's the way the real church of god has to take it sometime the dirty work all the scandal names and all of the thing that's mean to be thrown at it and she's a great speckled bird all the other birds gather around and flock at her that's all right her name is on the lamb's book of life she'll spread her great wings someday for a flight she's ready them speckles meant the blood of christ sprinkled on her see you've read it in your book the bible and this boy caught the little lady that night coming out he said i've watched you no one knows it but myself he said i've come out here looking for a wife and all that i've ever seen you meet the requirements how did she feel the big man's son asking her now if she would be his wife just imagine how those girls must have felt when they looked out their window and saw holding hands with that little despised cousin the man that they tried to vamp with all their big fine frocks and frills and carrying on and he said will you marry me oh she said sir i'm not worthy that's the way the real church feels about it i'm not worthy i can't if i could just wash your dishes it'll be all right are you willing to take that place could you wash the dishes from the supper would you be willing to be called fanatic would you be willing to take the way with the lord's despised few are you willing are you willing at your work to be marked there's a man he's a religious fanatic because he won't drink he won't smoke he doesn't dance he doesn't run with women there's a woman that keeps her head down she walks like down through the town she's not she won't join our circles are you willing to take the way make yourself ready for the coming of the lord if you have if you do you'll be waiting for him to come you'll joy at his coming it won't be a dreadful thing it'll be the most gracious moment that you can think of the coming of the lord all those that love his appearing so when he left he told her he would be back at a certain time said when you begin to see it was the winter said when you begin to see those trees begin to bud yonder that mesquite and stuff begin to take on new life said then i'll be back about springtime i understand i couldn't say it was true but the girl only got about a dollar and 75 cents a week for her labor but she saved every penny of it why she was getting ready for the wedding that was to be she was saving her money for her wedding gown for he said we'll be married right here at the ranch when i come again she saved her money all year she was happy she didn't mind washing the dishes she didn't mind ironing the clothes or sweeping out the bunk house or what more she was engaged to the boss of the ranch what do we care what the world says a real christian what do we care if we have to be despised and rejected blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth the boss's son is a coming one day and we're going to a wedding supper what difference does it make to us if you love his appearing after it was all the days past the little daughters the little cousins made fun of her danced around her and done everything else well said you poor silly kid do you know if that why he was just like all other men he was just teasing you scoffers but the son of god doesn't tease except a man be born again he will in no wise i don't care how good you look how much church you belong to what your status is in the country you might be a politician you might be in the federal government you might be in the catholic presbyterian any church you want to be but it's except a man be born again you will not enter and these signs shall follow them that believe i'm only quoting his word finally when the hour comes she began to see this the buds began to come on the trees she knew he would be there at any time and he said i'll try to make it just as sundown so we can be married and hurry off and every evening at sundown when she would go and get make herself already get her little wedding garment on and wait at the gate and these little cousins come and laugh at her make fun of her and said you poor silly ignorant child to think that the man who owns he's the president rather of the company that this boy would marry a dishwasher he was looking for virtue not clothes he had enough money to buy all the clothes was necessary god don't care how big your fancy things you have he owns everything in the world so he wants virtue he wants something that's real so finally one evening while she was standing there and they were laughing and making fun of her and telling her she was silly all at once they heard some hoofs of prancing what happened across the hill come a buck board now a buck board is a little wagon on top very popular in the west like like convertibles you know they're popular out out here you know arizona california it's popular why we got beautiful weather and the horses all jingled and everything coming across the hill come this carriage and it stopped in front of the gate and she run she said i knew you would come that's to be the church someday she threw herself in his arms and he said darling i've had a man stationed on this ranch since i left here last year that's brought me a report of everything that you've done god has got a man stationed in this tabernacle this morning he's called the holy spirit he knows the secrets of your heart he knows everything that you've done or what you think he tells the father everything that you do he brings the message back and forth oh my you have a secret life he knows about it what's your secret life like he knows about it he said and he has told me that you've waited and you've worked and you've labored patiently waiting for me to come now you've been a slave for a long time but now your slave days are over i've brought along the minister right under this rose trellis you've become my wife he kissed her put the wedding ring on her finger and picked her up and set her in the buck board with his arm around her and drove off to find this new big palace on on outer drive in chicago the selected of the nation where she could live as his bride why she was ready she had lived and been the kind of a woman that he wanted it happened just at the spare of the moment and that sudden secret coming of the lord the world don't know it's going to happen but we do it's at hand don't be like the young lady they stripped the clothes from in pearl harbor you'll go down in disgrace be like the one who made herself ready and kept her virtues and was waiting for the coming of the lord because it'll be secret and sudden i close with that story none of this should surprise us as a believer if on a daily basis you've been going in behind that veil into that secret place that secret sudden coming it's not secret to you you're used to that that sudden coming oh it'll be sudden but it won't catch you it won't catch you like when when the child's got his hand caught in the cookie jar the shock of guilt and i got god it'll be sudden it's here it's what i've been living for this is what my life has been this is what my secret walk has been all along and i say that to say this if there's somebody who doesn't know about that secret life if you say oh i've got a secret life all right but it sounds a little bit more like the secret the other secret lives you were talking about before i would i would invite you if that is pricking at your heart if that's the goad the shepherd's goad that god is using to prick your heart like he did paul paul paul saul saul how long will you kick against the pricks that pricks is goad how long will you kick against the shepherd's goad that's what he has at the end of his staff at the end of a shepherd's staff on the one end is the hook that's to pull you up from the places you've fallen but on the other end is a goad now that goad could be a brass ball or that goad could be a little bit sharp and it's enough to prick your heart to say come unto me all ye that labor and our heavy laden i'll give you rest i'll give you rest why don't you come in why don't you just come in behind that veil let the curtains drop and the things of the world leave them behind leave them behind we're not looking for frilly frogs we're not looking for big churches and fancy pews and and and and and the numbers filling this church up is is is certainly no sign that that you're any more spiritual that you're any closer to god it's a life it's that secret life consecrated and i and i only say this to put out an invitation that if there is would be in this place an unbeliever or even a make-believer who say i've just been faking it till i can make it you don't have to fake it anymore you don't got to fake it anymore come with a surrendered heart come to the altar that's in your heart it'd be right there in your seat it can be in your car it can be in your closet it can be in your bedroom it could be in a in a a generator room at work wherever that place is that you can find him and get away and surrender your heart to him and enter into that place i would invite you i would encourage you why don't you go in why don't you go meet him i wonder if we would stand and we could pray together you just pray in your own way and for those of you that know about this secret life with christ just pray set upon your heart somebody that doesn't know about that that you'd like to see come see if god could call to their spirit bring them back bring them back into the full our precious lord we we love you lord we just love your word oh god it's so precious to us it's words of life to us and lord we know about going in behind that veil we know about that manna that has sustained us all these years god it's when this world has gone crazy or when our maybe even its hustle and bustle in our own homes and our families and turmoil and fights and disputes maybe it's even in our churches lord wherever that would be we say i know where there's a place i can go and we go in behind that place and god how that it's refreshing and it's renewing god we come back out we say oh i'm so thankful that god takes care of me but lord to be a christian is to live for others lord at this point we're not we're not coming for ourselves but lord we would as it were we want to be holding the hand of a fellow laborer a fellow sojourner somebody lord who's not yet gone in behind that place lord we'd like to bring them before you we'd like to hold them before you lord we would ask that god let them experience that place lord just let them come into your presence one time as philip told nathaniel come and see a man that that is the messiah we found him we found the truth and when nathaniel was skeptical and maybe he was a scoffer at that time and he he just couldn't understand how that could even be possible lord philip said just come and see for yourself lord this is our desire is that that these others lord that our children that are friends that are family members that perhaps a a backslidden soul or lord an unbelieving family member or friend of ours a co-worker lord we would just want them to come and see you lord just to meet you and once in your presence we know if they could ever get into your presence lord if they could ever hear the word of life it'll change their heart like it did ours god we're just asking that lord as many now are thinking about somebody else they're calling their name and they're asking that god you would go and visit them that you would tug at their heart that lord if they've got a secret life that they're trying to hide that they're ashamed of a life that that they know isn't right but they just can't get away from it that that secret life seems to be taking over and becoming even the bigger part of their life oh god don't let the devil take them and and and take them to a place so low that they can't hear your word anymore lord we would ask for your mercy and for your grace to be extended to them that lord you would take them into your presence that lord they would begin to eat on that man that they would see that resurrection life that that can cause buds and blossoms and fruit to be born that lord the word of god that that wouldn't be just a a tablet of rules but lord it would be a life written upon our hearts that god you could write upon their heart your word and that that that word would uphold them it would be a strength it would it would be it would be a foundation for them to build upon lord for we know that it's the only foundation the word of god is the only foundation that has stood the test of time we know that it's the only foundation that when heavens and earth will pass away we know your word won't pass away god let them be built upon that foundation then lord we pray that your holy spirit would have liberty to add there and to build little upon little word upon word line upon line precept upon precept hear a little there a little oh god may they experience that pentecostal experience where you feel them so full that the world says what has happened here they could say oh no this is what was this is what joel was speaking of this is what peter was speaking of i've received the full baptism of the holy ghost grant that lord we want to bring these different ones before you god even those that we've had disagreements with those that we haven't seen eye to eye lord we want to come together with them and say let us go in the presence of god for we know that in your presence oh god there's joy everlasting there's peace there's real justice lord that god you can work all things to your good and for our good lord because we love you we love your word above all else we love you and we love your word we just ask that god this secret life would not just be a secret life with one but lord for it to as many as the lord our god shall call may they know this secret life with you granted heavenly father for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen in a secret place [Music] his face [Music] oh [Music] place [Music] is [Music] one more time as i turn it over is [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] the presence [Music] god almighty [Music] and hearts are made [Music] verse [Applause] [Music] all day long i struggled for the answers that i need then i come into his presence all my questions and for a sacred moment no doubt can interfere in the presence [Music] friends [Music] and hearts are in the presence [Music] through his love the lord provided a place for us [Music] there's [Music] you can have that presence right now he'd come and meet you right here [Music] answer those questions satisfy that desire oh my a god of peace [Music] he said come unto me all ye they're heavy laden and i will give you rest sometimes we look for the rest in this physical body but there's a greater rest than that there's a peace a satisfying portion that god gives even when the body seems to be falling apart and everything to be there's something that holds you at peace holds you at rest there's an anchor that holds in the midst of all the storms of today just thinking about that with work situations home situations even church situations things sometimes but he is that answer he is at peace somebody can come up to you and say what is that about you there is something about you i'd like to have that i know that fountain that that cistern inside of you that's just that the bubbling fountain that's coming out and giving and because you've entered into that place you've made it up if i could say it this way just a daily part of life something that you you long for you desire for and i know there are times that you'll get home you're tired you're weary you've had a tough day and the bed just seems like it'd be the best thing to just plop on and lay down and turn everything off and you wake up in the morning you say you know i still got that anxiousness i still got that trouble i rested all night and a bit but if i would entered into his presence there would have been a setting for you [Music] but i'll tell you this now because you have entered into the presence there's going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet point something in your heart is saying yes amen i said boy that's a change of temple but something tells me because i've been there and he promised it like her and she waited every day and he came and said because he says there's going to be a meeting in here there is going to [Music] to greet you over [Music] and god's own son will be there's going to be [Music] i'll greet you over there in that home [Music] gloriously [Music] [Applause] you'd say well how could you sing a song like that because something inside me tells me yes something inside me tell me that day is coming it's worth all if i could put it this way the sacrifices in this life to not to drive the fleet of cadillacs and i you know that won't mean nothing that won't be nothing but the joy that's on the other side we've heard this story many times with brother branham but this is i think one of the most detailed little details about say and and i just reminded brother lyle brother peter when we sat with that man in the room back here and said god had told him showed him the year he's coming not the day but the year and he shared it with such a passion didn't he i think you could have sat in the church you could have heard the meeting because it was quite loud it was a passion in here but there was somebody that didn't click just to hold the passion about he's come but he's coming in 2024. [Music] my friends if we thought he was coming in 2024 a lot of us wouldn't be getting ready today i still got 2022 2023 before i needed to worry about it but he might come in a blinking a moment about just in a moment so let's be ready let's prepare our hearts let's enter into his presence daily do the things that we know to do that way when he does come you'll be ready to say yeah there's they're mine how many want to go with him amen lord we just raise our hands lord because something in our heart says amen to them others lord today are are looking for something else trying to fill that void with with another pleasure with but something in our heart is saying yes lord even so come quickly lord jesus as our brother platt was saying lord if there's one here there's one in our hearts lord and i know there's somebody in my heart right now lord thinking about them and saying lord let it be real for them also lord as you made it real for us lord maybe we may we share such a life in front of them that would they would say i would want that let it be i pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless you as you go service this evening at five o'clock and i don't know what brother reggie where the lord has put in his heart but i'm grateful for what he put in his heart today and no he didn't preach the sermon i've had in my heart but it'll tie perfectly and it will but it's because we served the same god and one thing i was asked to do and i missed it but i could probably write it on a bulletin board up there and i'd still miss it we've for the church and they've asked for friday this coming friday the fifth in the evening here at five o'clock i believe they said there's going to be a potluck here the italian themed all are welcome and if you would like to bring a dish you can sign up on the whatsapp or you can talk to my daughter beth and i think maybe sister rachel and then we would love to have everybody here if you would be willing to come on this this coming friday evening so one of these days there's going to be a meeting in the air there's going to be that wedding supper of the lamb and it's going to be worth it all amen god bless you as good as you go there is going to be a meeting in the air in the [Music] i am going to me i'll greet you over there in that home and god's own son will be there you have heard of little moses you have heard of fearless david and hislam you have heard the story told [Music] i should like to make them all i do declared [Music] [Applause] [Music] i am going to meet and greet you over there [Music] and god's own son [Music] oh [Music] and someday [Music] shall be [Music] sweet [Music] foreign [Music] no sad goodbyes [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] shall be [Music] oh i'm looking [Music] to wear my face [Music] of you more days [Music] oh [Music] oh shall we [Music] oh shall be [Music] you
