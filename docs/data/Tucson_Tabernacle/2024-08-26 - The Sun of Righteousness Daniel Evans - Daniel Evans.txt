brothers and sisters there's a sweet sweet Spirit here this morning when you were singing the goodness of God with just a congregation singing I could just feel the spirit in the back and I was thinking oh God thank you they lift up their voices in praise to the one that is worthy of Our Praise brothers and sisters just praise God he is so good I believe he's I believe he's pleased I just there's a sweet Spirit here if you have a request Upon Your Heart Take it take uh take advantage of that Spirit that's here because I believe the Lord is he's with us I uh I forgot to mention a couple prayer requests um and before we before we pray um I've been texting back and forth with uh shaed he's um the Jewish uh young man that um they fellowshipped with us for a while here he lives in the northern part of Israel he is uh Roseanne linhard her her daughter Hannah shed's her husband so it's rosanne's son-in-law um and it looks like uh some um they launched some missiles this morning and and Israel sent sent an attack over preemptive attack against Hezbollah um and it's just a very very volatile very bad situation there one day the the whole world is going to turn against that little country of Israel but then God will fight for them and I would rather have God on my side than the whole [Applause] that's let's pray for them and I also brother William I'm sorry I forgot to mention your prayer request also brother William is he's sojourning here with us from Bina Faso brother William raise your hand um and uh he's had some problems with school there was a technicality that he wanted to attend um Pima and uh Pima wouldn't let him in for some reason so if he doesn't get in then he runs the chances of being deported back to Bina Faso and he wants to he wants to be here he wants to be with us and he wants to he wants to get his education here so let's let's bow our heads our heavenly father how many men and women throughout history have bowed their heads called upon you in a time of need Lord we do the same this morning Father we pray for brother William that you'd make a way that your will would be done first and foremost Lord whatever your will would be in his life father that that you would take care of it and then for brother shaed sister Hannah sister Roseanne their family father I pray for them in Israel that Lord there's an Iron Dome that's over that country but father there is a dome of blood that's that's spread across that nothing can get through that without you knowing it father and you allow you allowing it we pray that that you would have your hand upon them and protect that family bless our service this morning we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you brothers and sisters you can be seated I'm very very proud of our church very proud of what we believe and I stand firm on this Bible amen and I stand firm on what we teach when we make mistakes sure but we stand on on what is true and what is right but I do want to encourage the people encourage the people of the congregation if there's a question that you have ask me no matter what it is if you have a question about something that I teach if you have a question that's something you of something that you grew up believing if you have a question about why is this true God placed me here to answer those questions by the scriptures he's put me here so that you can ask me then I can give you a straight answer and I'll tell you it may not be the answer that you would expect but it'll be from my heart and I'll tell you now you have to understand this scripture for yourself but here is the foundation for it so please if there's a question ask me as I said I don't know how long God will have me here I don't know what he has in the future but I do know that there are two things that make the decision of me being here pastor and that is number one that it's God's Will and then number two that it's the will of of the majority of the congregation those two things must be and that's why I'm here and I believe that that God has placed me here and please if you have some question if you if you don't understand something use the gift that God gave and ask and I'll do my best it's um it's the most important thing to me as a pastor what I would like to see in the church is a group of people that are able to open up their Bible and understand what it says by the Holy Spirit by studying I've heard there's this one statement I've heard that I it always kind of got under my skin and I think it gets under my skin now more than ever is that saying that I wouldn't understand this Bible if it wasn't for my pastor my Prophet or whatever my answer to that is brother or sister that's telling me you didn't spend the time to really dig into it you didn't spend the time to pray about what you're reading you must understand this word God is a god of he has Sons and Daughters he doesn't have grandsons and granddaughters we are not as we just went through the whole book of Hebrews we are not under a priesthood or under a five-fold Ministry or under any of that it is a personal relationship between God and man the five-fold ministry is a gift to the people it is a gift for to Aid in the perfecting of the body of Christ it is here to help amen and that's that's why we're here but ultimately it is God and us I think I've been very very very plain i' like to read a scripture 1 Corinthians Chapter 14 verse 18 it says this this is the Apostle Paul's speaking and how important it was for Paul that the people could understand the scriptures he says this he says I thank my God that I speak with tongues more than you all yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice I might teach others also than 10,000 words in an unknown tongue so what good does it speak what good does it do to speak in another language what good does it it might be impressive oh wow that was cool that was neat oh did you hear that it might be good but what good does it do it as Paul said it does good that you can understand what I'm saying and that you can apply it to your life you need to understand the absolute in all things which is the word of God remember the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Brethren be not children in understanding how be it in Malice be ye children but in understanding be men most other translations say be infants with regard to evil but in your thinking be mature in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me sayeth the Lord so I'll send you pastors I'll send you gifts I'll send you prophets I'll send people from foreign lands and I'll send you a Bible in your own language and yet still you won't listen listen to me it's important to the Apostle Paul that the people understand the Bible and it's very important it's a very important part of a church we have worship we have praise we have prayer we have all of these things and those are also part of it but the word should also be a central part of a church where the the message comes forth the people of absorb the message and then they leave closer to God through the word it's all part of it but that word let's not forget that word we must know it because as I said when that when that house starts to shake if you have a foundation that you can go back to and say no the Bible says this it may not Mak make sense in my mind but it still says it and I believe this Bible more than I believe my emotions or my thinking I want to point out I wasn't able the last chapter of Hebrews I wanted to point out one thing along those same lines that we have to understand this word Hebrews chapter 13 verse 5 it's something that we quote so much but I want to give you a context to it and and don't just pull out a scripture now you can some some scriptures are written that way like Proverbs and um and Psalms they're meant they're they're written in a poetic style they're meant to be able to take to take them out of context but here most aren't let your conversation be without covet Covetous covet covetousness can't even say it that's good um and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so he's saying keep your life free from the love of money and be content with what you have for as he said I will never leave you Jesus speaking I'll never leave you nor forsake you so don't worry you have the promises of Jesus Christ in your life so don't worry about these things it doesn't matter what people do to you brothers and sisters you don't have control over that but it's how you react to what they do that is what you have control over and with that story I just told about this brother we can't control how people do us wrong we can't control what people say about us but what we do have full control over is our reaction and how and that's what proves what we are is how we react so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me remember them which have rule over you the ESV says remember your leaders who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow consider the end of their conversations so so the English an version says remember your leaders who spoke to you the word of God consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith so he's saying these people that minister to you that are are telling you the word he said remember them think about them and think about what they say and then imitate their way of life Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever verse number eight look at the context be not carried away with diverse and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with Meats which have profited them that have been occupied therein we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle his topic is still on the ministry it's still on the priesthood so when we we quote this scripture this Hebrews chapter 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever don't forget it is in a context here and he is the same but don't just pull it out remember that it has a meaning the this Hebrews 138 and yes he is the same yesterday he does the same things as he did way back when he does the same things now and he will always do the same things his nature doesn't change but be careful about taking the scriptures out of context so it's so often that I see the people that quote that some of the people that quote that scripture the most are the ones that pull out the ministry from the church wow and say no you don't need to have a pastor you don't need to have a church you just stay home Hebrews 13:8 brothers and sisters put that that's that that scripture into context don't just quote it understand what it means the Bible has always been the enemy me it's always been his one of his tactics to pull the word of God away from the people to try to get it to where number one they can't read it they can't understand it and and then to like today that they don't want to hear it they don't want to read it it's it's I was um we were having our devotions uh with the family we're on vacation my daughter asked she said um why do things always get so hard why does God always bring such hardships and I said I said honey I said you know I've been telling this to the church for the past few months that these hardships are a blessing because in the good times it's often that we won't serve God we're not thinking about God in the good times but it's in the hard times that's when we get to our needes because we need something and I said it's just Mercy from God that he puts us through these trials and these tribulations it's that's that's God's mercy on us he loves us so he he allows us to go through these things and and then we we as we progressed on there I said it's always the the devil's way to pull the word away from the people and I I quoted um that saying that that's so often they say that that I wouldn't know what this Bible meant if it wasn't for and the Catholic say if it wasn't for the priests so there was a long time stretch there that they had the Bible written in Latin that the common people couldn't even understand it so they needed that priest up there to explain what it is and then you have these men like John Wickliffe come along and they say no the people need to know this so they take the Bible and they translate it into the the common language and then you have a man like named Martin Luther that started a whole Reformation he wanted the people to have the Bible in their own language so he took it and he translated it into German then his contemporary a friend of his uh William Tindale he did the same into English and it's always Satan's way to tell the people you can't understand this Bible on your own and it is always God's way and a servant of God to say you can you can understand it you can believe it and these promises that are in this Bible and here is the ministry coming out they are just as true today as they always have been Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and if you have a need God can meet that need right so let's turn in our Bibles to Malachi the 3 chapter and I want to get into this the son of righteousness Malachi 3 verse 13 to lay a foundation so so we're putting all of this into context and the Book of Malachi and and brother ly I can't wait till we get there I'm the pastor so I'm going to take this one it's one of that's it's one of the best it's just it's such a great book because it shows the the human nature and the Book of Malachi is this hypothetical dialogue between God and between people and he says that you have done this certain thing and they're like wait a minute when have we done this and then he will explain why that they have done these sins Malachi 3:13 it says this your words have been Stout against me they've been harsh or arrogant against me sayeth the Lord yet you say what have we spoken so much against thee you have said it is vain to serve God and what prophit is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mourn mournfully before the Lord of hosts he says what gain so so the people are complaining they and they say in their hearts maybe what gain is it that we go and we're mournful mournful and and and we're not happy and we're serving God and and things are just so bad and he says and now we call the proud happy the ESV and NIV both said we call the Arrogant blessed yay they that work wickedness are set up basically the evildoers Prosper yay they that tempt God are even delivered they're saying that the Sinners they're they're they have a better life than us they're being blessed more than we are what do we have to go about saying in in mournful ways and saying oh I'm such a sinner and all and all this they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it so he's saying here so here is God responding he's like you say that serving God has hindered you and you're saying that these people that don't serve God everything's good for them and they're blessed but listen to this then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened to the people that Hur that feared him to people that respected him and the Lord hearkened and heard it he listened to it and he heard it and the and a book of remembrance was written before them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name how beautiful so so this book of remembrance so there's somebody or something recording our thoughts and recording what we are doing and writing it down and saying here's Bethany she cares she cares what I said she thinks about my word I'm going to write her name down here and here is this other person he doesn't care he may go to church but he's there serving himself recording all of these things and saying and writing these names in a book and they shall be mine those ones that are in that book they shall be mine sayeth the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels calling us Jewels calling us his treasure in the day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then they then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not so here is this book and it's written these are the ones that are sincere and here he comes he comes back and he discerns who wants to serve him and who doesn't want to serve him for behold chapter 4 behold the day cometh that shall burn up burn as an oven and all the proud yeah and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch you know what that means when you burn if you've ever come out after a forest fire you see a tree that's been burned and then there's there's these trees you'll go out and after the rain hits there's still a stump there and you'll see especially the Oaks and the junipers you'll see that they'll start growing from that stump right but then there are other trees that it burns all the way down into the ground and all the way through the roots so you you look at the ground and there's Ash all around there's a hole there and you can see where the roots once were it burned all the way down in there and there is nothing left of that tree it is completely gone and that's saying here it won't leave them any any root any branch there is nothing left of those per people but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and shall go forth and grow up as CS of the stall I love this is where brother William this is where English we get a special blessing we have different translations of the Bible into different languages but in English it says the son of righteousness we all think son Like Son of God it doesn't say that it says son like in the SK guy and this son arises with healing in his wings and in English it's such a blessing because s o n and Su n are pronounced the same and really they are the same in this scripture the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked and they shall be asers under the souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayeth the Lord of hosts Jeremiah 23:5 I'll read this quickly it says this behold the day cometh sayeth the Lord that I will raise unto David A righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and Justice in the earth speaking of Jesus Christ in his day Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called our Lord our righteousness the same this son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings Daniel and I were um we would wake up early uh when we were on vacation and we would go and we would watch the sunrise so we were out the previous evening and we were fishing and we were coming back and it was it was getting late and the sun was going down and there was this Lookout and there was all these people at this Lookout and they're waiting to see the sunset and man they're they're all out there and they're they're posing and and they're doing you know the the thing and and getting all their pictures and and just just doing everything and it's going to go up into the um where it goes and uh and all these people there's probably there was over a h 100 there at this beautiful Lookout and you know we look back in the Sun is going down it's pretty and it's nice and we're going and we go home so the next morning Daniel and I get up around I don't know 5:00 and and we get ready and we go we go for a walk and we go to that same place and there was no one there it's starting to get light there was no one in that area where just a little while ago just 8 hours ago or whatever it was 12 hours ago there was a hundred or more people there and now there's no one there and the sun is coming up it's not quite up yet and I said buddy I said you see that I said remember last night there was all these people here and now there's no one here and I told them I said anyone can watch a sunset but it takes an effort to watch a sunrise you got to get up early you have to do something to watch that son rise up that son of righteousness come up and it said for those that love me for those that keep my Commandments for those that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and that's what the end time believer that's what the True Believer wants to see is that sun rising as I said anyone can look at a Sunset and see the the the seriousness of what's going on in Israel they can see all of the immorality that's going on in the world they can see all of these things and I mean anybody can do it take a picture here we are we're at the end but it takes an effort to watch that Sunrise you got to get up early but unto you the fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall what is that mean have you ever how many uh how many have ever had livestock have ever had horses have you ever taken a horse or a calf or whatever out of its Paddock out of its stall into a big area into a pasture or a Corral or whatever it is and let him go they don't just wander off it's like oh great I'm out of my stall no way man they take off and you better stand back because they're kicking and they're jumping and they're bucking and they're really happy because now they're liberated now they're free and you're stuck in this stall and then when you really accept this son of righteousness when you really believe all of a sudden all these weights on your shoulder brother Dan it's gone and you jump and you shout and you praise and you say thank God I'm out of that stall I'm free and you look those horses going out they kick and they they they buck and they're just so happy that they're not stuck in the pen anymore and that is when that son of righteousness Ares with healings in his wings and what a Christian really sees how beautiful then you say praise God John I believe in the Book of Revelation John saw remember the book John saw his name on the book maybe looked over the Angel's shoulder John that's me and he said I shouted so loud all of Heaven could hear me and that's how we are when you really are free and you say no it's not about a a a formal religion now it is about Christ in me the son of righteousness how has arose in my life life and now he's here and I'm free imagine how Peter felt Peter was an ordinary everyday guy fished him and his brother um Andrew and then he saw something in this man Jesus Christ he saw that these scriptures came came to life in him he saw that this son of righteousness wow my sins are forgiven all of this that I've been reading about in my Bible it all comes true in this man Jesus Christ you can imagine how how good he felt and then when he received the Holy Spirit that promise came down upon him and they spoke in tongues that all of these things were manifested and then this other man Paul came in a much different way you have Peter over here is just an ordinary everyday guy and then you have Paul over here who's a preacher in a church self-righteous legalistic judging everyone but still as much of a sinner or more than Peter was when Peter was out on the boat cussing and arguing and gambling and do whatever he was doing but still as much of a sinner as Peter was and look what happens he gets knocked down and he finds this man Jesus Christ is actually the real thing he comes out of that old bondage that he was in if you read the book of Galatians it's like you're not under this bondage anymore come out of that you are free and what's so great you can do whatever you want now and you do do whatever you want you do whatever you want no matter what but when you receive that Holy Spirit and when you come out of that stall then you can do whatever you want and now you want to serve God you want to please God and that's what makes you so happy that's what that's what is such a liberating thing is now I'm not trying to please man I'm not trying to please my parents I'm not trying to please my pastor I'm not trying to to please my teacher or my coach or whatever now I am pleasing God and I'm not under that and these people they came out they came out of those stalls think of Mary Magdalene mentally mental problems struggling as worldly as you can be and then when that man came into her life you can imagine the joy that was with Mary it didn't matter people judging her it didn't matter what she used used to struggle with she was free she came out of that stall I think of I think of Paul so much that he was in that bondage of that religion that he was in he was Paul's anger was in his heart but when that son of righteousness arose with healing in his wings look at what he said I can quote it but I'll read it he said this but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet I show unto you a more excellent way though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not love and become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and they'll have the gift of Prophecy and understand all the Mysteries and all the knowledge and all and have all all that I have all faith that I could remove mountains and have not love I am nothing the same man that wanted to kill those people that wanted to destroy the very son of righteousness Legion Mark chapter 5 what had what had happened was Jesus had just went the the disciples had just gone out on the boat without him it was late the evening was dark so the storm comes up Jesus comes calms the storm and then they go to land now we don't know exactly what time of the day that they came to land but the Lake's not very big and they could have have come to land at night but this man Legion looked out a far off and he saw Jesus so there had to be light there so I'm looking at this and seeing this was in the morning here's Legion out of his mind possessed with all of these demons probably worse than we see out here on the street and here is this man and and he looks out and the demons well up inside him and they see this man and they see that he is the Son of God Legion when that son came up that day the son of righteousness was coming to Legion he looks out he sees Jesus walking towards him he had such problems we kids today there may be some people here that that have done it before but they'll cut themselves brothers and sisters that's a sign of an evil spirit it's a sign of insanity Legion cut himself with with these sharp rocks he was he was struggling with this verse number seven Mark chapter 5 and he cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God I adure Thee by God that thou torment me not for he said for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he answered and said my name is Legion for we are many man was possessed with all of these demons and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country now there was nigh unto them unto the mountains a great herd of of swine feeding and all the Devils beh besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them and for withth Jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep Place into the sea there were about 2,000 and were choked in the sea do you see the goal of Satan do you see the goal of mental illness the ultimate goal is to take your life the ultimate goal is for you to take your own life and here it is here we see this evil these evil demons they go into these simple-minded pigs and immediately they commit suicide that's what he wanted of Legion but the son of righteousness arose that morning for Legion then Legions healed and he says he says I want to go with you and Jesus makes a statement he says no you stay here and you tell others about what's happened to you so here's here's Legion and and he goes and Jesus tells tell him go tell your friends and all this witness to other people and that's what a Christian does when that son of righteousness arises with healing in his wings on me or on you what's the first thing that you should want to do is go to others and say Hey you can have this I'm free now I'm not stuck in the stall anymore I'm liberated now you have it right not cut people out not destroy people not put them down not condemn them but say this is what's happened to me you can have it just like I have it and that's what Legion did Jesus said go tell your friends then I don't have time but in uh in Mark chapter 7 the sarap phenician woman the serop phenician woman she's a a Syrian woman from Phoenicia Siro Phoenician woman she came to to to um Jesus she's a gentile and her daughter was suffering with probably the same thing that Legion was suffering she humbled him herself Jesus was a bit rude to her at first but she continued to Humble herself he said he basically called her he says no he says you can't he says she says Lord help me help my daughter and he says your dog he says he says I'm not going to give you give the dog the food from the master's table and then she says but Lord the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table she humbled herself right there how many of us would have done that and then Jesus said your daughter is healed and she was delivered on that day then the same chapter he talks about a deaf man how to speech him impediment that all these healings were going on and they brought this deaf man and they said just lay your hands on him just lay your hand on him it's not always laying on of hands so Jesus did a very strange thing he spit and he takes it and he puts it on the Man's Tongue deaf man he he was deaf he couldn't see I mean he couldn't hear and he couldn't speak then immediately man was given his hearing and he was able to speak I I've told the story before in our testimonies I'll tell it again you know who FF Bosworth is brother Bosworth was at a prayer meeting with brother brandom and there was a man brother Bosworth couldn't hear very well and there was a man that was deaf that came forward brother Bosworth turns him around to the congregation sets him in front of the congregation prays for him and says okay brother can you hear and he said yes and he says brother you're going to have to you're going to have to have more faith he prays for him again and he says brother can you hear and he says yes he says brother listen you got to have more faith he prays for him again he says' brother can you hear the man turns around and he says' brother I can hear maybe we need to pray for you now it's good but what what means the most brother Manny what means the most from that story is that the man was healed and it was an expected thing and we have gone so far away from that now where we don't really expect our healing wow anymore and we should that same God that healed that man with brother Bosworth is the same God that's here with us today he's the same I have a friend I haven't talked with him in many years but I have a friend in Africa that he um he went to evangelist he went to this place um in Mala called monkey Bay it's a dangerous area because there's a lot of Muslims there and he's obviously a Christian and he goes and and he he is ministering and and the people start giving their hearts to the Lord and He baptized eight people that day and and he got in through a bishop of that area a Christian Bishop was able to get him into this Village so the village headman comes to my friend John and he says my daughter has never been able to hear or speak since she was born and I forgot how I think she was about 10 years old let me see if I um I think she was about 10 years old and John lays his hand on the little on the girl and prays for her and he says okay can you hear now and she says you know I can hear she didn't say that but she raised her hand she could obviously hear and the the the whole the whole village was watching all of this going on and he says but she still can't speak he lays his hand on her again and prays again and then the girl starts speaking Miracle right there in front of him and then this this this message starts spreading around this area that God is alive that he does the same things now as he did then as he did when you read the Bible other people are getting healed he goes to another place and he said he said the greatest miracle I have ever seen and he says brother he says I've never seen something like this he says we were praying for these people in this other Village and he said they wielded up this little skinny man in a wheelbarrow dying of age and he looks down at the man and he lays his hands upon the man and the man jumps up and was completely healed of that dreaded disease that has no that has no cure went back to the doctors and showed John his his testimony HIV negative a man that was just about to die imagine that man that morning in all the pain that he was going through and that son of righteousness arose with healing in his wings because this man talked about a living Jesus Christ he's alive the son of righteousness is there for those people that fear his name that love him and let me tell you John this man he does not believe like I believe he doesn't believe like you believe either but he does believe in Jesus Christ he believes in a God that heals for that we do believe and we stand upon that and as I've said many times there will be Jesus himself said there will be one Shepherd and one fold and that Shepherd is Jesus Christ and that fold are his children and just because I don't see things the way John does doesn't mean that God can't use him or use me these powerful testimonies we've seen them and this son of righteousness brothers and sisters it arises in our lives with healing in his wings and he takes the old that's right and he makes it new the musicians can come here in This Book of Malachi let me read it again again for behold the day cometh remember the back and forth the ones that don't respect him the ones that don't believe him for behold the day cometh thou shal burn as an oven and the and all the proud Y and all that do wickedness shall be stubble and the day cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts it shall lead them leave them neither root nor Branch they will be destroyed for ever gone eternally separated from God but unto you this is this is a good part but unto you that fear my name to you that respect me to you that try to you that try to do what I teach in this word to you that take the time to come to church to you that take the time to read your Bible to you that take the time to pray to you that really respect me to you that that believe me that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall you're out of that bondage that bondage of the world that bondage of sin where you're
