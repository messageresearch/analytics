[32:26] this morning about he's the true one
[32:28] not just not false but he's the whole
[32:30] truth it's him he's the one
[32:34] brother brother Noel maybe you could
[32:35] come and we've got a couple needs
[32:37] don't have a lot of needs written in but
[32:40] I was just talking to brother Reggie and
[32:42] his father-in-law brother Gerald Hughes
[32:44] is on his way to India right now and he
[32:47] sends his greetings but also I know that
[32:49] he'd be glad and depend on the Lord
[32:53] helping on him and so he'd appreciate
[32:55] our prayers I know and today I received
[32:58] a text from our brother Colin in Israel
[33:01] and just an update of the work that
[33:04] they're continuing there and I just want
[33:06] to keep them in prayer remember that
[33:09] we're part of this big body that the
[33:11] Lord is doing great things all over the
[33:13] world and
[33:16] my my little boy
[33:19] he heard somebody say it's good to pray
[33:21] for Israel
[33:22] and so now he's the one piping up well
[33:23] we should pray for Israel too
[33:25] and I love that we ought to we ought to
[33:28] not be so self-centered but say Lord
[33:30] bless is your Lord bless my brother my
[33:32] sister amen but we have needs too so for
[33:35] the north you'd come on up let's just
[33:37] stand and if you have a need just lift
[33:40] it up by faith to the Lord that
[33:42] God can meet that need today in his
[33:46] perfect timing whatever it is if you've
[33:47] got a question
[33:49] is the answer of questions so let's look
[33:51] to him
[33:53] [Music]
[33:58] let's all just pray
[34:03] our most gracious and loving Heavenly
[34:05] Father
[34:07] it is always our privilege
[34:09] to come and gather ourselves together
[34:11] Under One Roof
[34:14] and there Lord be able to lift unto you
[34:16] songs of praise and worship unto you
[34:19] and Lord they've come from our heart and
[34:21] so Lord we know that you've accepted
[34:23] them we know Lord you don't look down
[34:27] from heaven because you dwell in each
[34:28] and every one of us and Lord through our
[34:30] eyes you're able to see the things going
[34:33] on in this world and the things going on
[34:35] around about us
[34:37] so Lord we know that you're aware of the
[34:39] situations going on
[34:41] I know in indialor the prime ministers
[34:44] tried to Stamp Out Christianity
[34:47] he's been makes it very difficult for us
[34:50] to go there and to be able to minister
[34:52] and to be able to get money into there
[34:55] but Lord You've placed it on the hearts
[34:57] of different men to go there into that
[35:00] country
[35:01] and their lord offer their assistance
[35:03] Lord by their presence by their
[35:05] preaching by their resources to be able
[35:08] to encourage the brothers and sisters
[35:10] which dwell in that land
[35:12] because lord they're under extreme
[35:14] persecution
[35:15] and they dwell in a landlord and where
[35:18] everybody they worship idols
[35:20] all they do is worship Satan
[35:23] and so Lord there's an oppression that
[35:25] goes with all of that that's going on in
[35:27] India and so I'm thankful Lord that
[35:29] you're able to send some other brothers
[35:31] and sisters into there to encourage them
[35:34] and dislodge them to minister unto them
[35:37] and Minister unto their knees
[35:39] but Lord I think of Ukraine and I hear
[35:42] from different brothers and the things
[35:43] going on there
[35:45] and Lord I hear stories of how of how
[35:48] Rockets have landed in people's front
[35:50] yards but they never detonated so Lord
[35:53] you spared their lives
[35:55] but others have been able to manage to
[35:57] get out of the country and Lord now they
[35:59] need their their needs to be supplied
[36:02] you spoke about these things would be in
[36:04] the end time and Lord we're there
[36:06] it's no longer a future Lord we're in
[36:09] the midst of all of this
[36:10] and so Lord we are in the time when we
[36:13] are going to receive the changing of our
[36:14] bodies we're coming to the time lord
[36:17] when you are going to so Unite with your
[36:20] bride until it's no longer us but it's
[36:22] you living your life through us but Lord
[36:24] as we know dwell in temples of clay
[36:26] Satan attacks these temples
[36:28] but Lord you said that we are healed
[36:30] because Lord you've already paid for the
[36:32] price of that healing and so lordy we
[36:35] ask you to help us to have the faith to
[36:37] accept what you've already purchased for
[36:38] us because lord it's all the work has
[36:42] already been done but Lord and we need
[36:44] you instill within us the faith to be
[36:46] able to accept that which is already
[36:49] accomplished for us so Lord rise our
[36:52] levels of faith and understanding so
[36:54] Lord we can trust you for the very
[36:56] Necessities we have day by day and as
[36:59] the world continues to go into its
[37:01] Darkness Lord we need your light to
[37:03] shine through us
[37:04] so Lord take your light so live in US
[37:07] Lord until your light can shine into a
[37:09] dark world that Lord there are others
[37:12] that are out there that's your seed
[37:14] but Lord they have to see the light
[37:16] so Lord through our Lives May that light
[37:19] so shine Lord that it will shine unto
[37:21] them and and it'll Quicken the seed of
[37:24] God that you place within their lives so
[37:25] they can receive what you have done and
[37:28] they'll be able to join this great body
[37:30] of Jesus Christ of which we're apart and

[41:35] before you Lord in honor in reverence
[41:38] Lord in humility to to say before our
[41:42] great king
[41:44] that we love you Lord we
[41:48] Lord are humbled in your presence and
[41:51] Lord we're so grateful that you have
[41:54] promised that where two or three would
[41:56] come and gather together in your name
[41:58] you said you would be there and Lord
[42:00] that's all we are depending upon is for
[42:03] you to be here this evening
[42:06] Lord I pray that for those that could
[42:08] not be here this morning perhaps their
[42:10] home or wherever they would be in in
[42:13] other services ministers ministering in
[42:17] their assemblies I pray God that you
[42:19] would bless them where they are go and
[42:22] meet them Lord where they are at
[42:24] we just ask that Lord you would take
[42:27] this bread of life that Lord you'll
[42:29] break it to each one of us the portion
[42:32] that we have need of
[42:33] we are depending upon you this evening
[42:36] and we just would ask that you would
[42:38] take the preeminence here this evening
[42:39] we surrender it to you we ask these
[42:42] things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[42:46] God bless you can be seated
[42:52] I uh
[42:57] really appreciated the song from the
[43:00] Guerra sisters and I I'm a little uh not
[43:05] not upset but disappointed that you
[43:07] never did that before and I'm
[43:12] we're going to have words after words
[43:15] to be hiding a talent like that like you
[43:18] have and then to pass it off as if they
[43:20] couldn't do that ever again and
[43:22] that was a real blessing my father is
[43:25] the Ancient of Days and I as I began to
[43:28] think about that in the back my eyes
[43:30] begin to tear up just to think that I
[43:33] have a father who's
[43:35] who through the since the dawn of time
[43:39] he knows our needs he's seen our needs
[43:42] before
[43:44] he's met others that have had the same
[43:46] needs that we've got
[43:48] and I'm so grateful that he knows that
[43:53] just comforts you you know when you feel
[43:55] alone and and uh
[43:59] or you're in pain and and but to know
[44:02] that he knows
[44:03] it means a lot
[44:05] this evening
[44:08] uh I read this scripture
[44:10] brother Branham used this scripture uh
[44:14] in a message called the path of life
[44:18] and uh
[44:21] this evening we want to minister a
[44:25] sermon called give life
[44:30] and
[44:32] I want to jump right in I I
[44:36] really said it in my heart
[44:39] tonight to make a deal with sister
[44:41] Elizabeth Guerra
[44:43] to take the time off that I I overspent
[44:46] on this morning's sermon and go ahead
[44:49] and cut it off of this evening's sermon
[44:51] so I hope that it works out I will warn
[44:55] all of the young people here I I'm not
[44:57] so good at it I I've failed many of
[44:59] times when I made promises like that so
[45:03] um but Lord help us this evening
[45:06] ah
[45:08] brother random in this message
[45:11] he's speaking to ministers and a
[45:13] Minister's meeting I believe is is where
[45:16] this message is taking place
[45:19] and he says brethren
[45:21] I believe that we have the thing that
[45:23] the world must have
[45:26] but we got to approach it in a way
[45:30] what if you were a carpenter now I
[45:32] stopped right there
[45:33] I don't want you reading on ahead of me
[45:35] I don't like when you all are already
[45:37] know what I'm about to say
[45:41] I was a carpenter before I did
[45:43] artificial grass
[45:45] I was a carpenter
[45:47] and
[45:49] brother Branham is about to get into
[45:51] what if you were a carpenter and so to
[45:54] uh that right away stirs me up because I
[45:57] know okay I know what that means I know
[45:58] what it is to be a carpenter I know what
[46:00] it is to be a builder
[46:02] but brother random is saying Brothers we
[46:04] have what the world needs
[46:08] and I hope that you believe that
[46:10] I hope that you believe that we've got
[46:12] as brother Brandon said in one place
[46:15] we've got the answer to the devil's
[46:17] question
[46:19] we've got that and I believe that I
[46:21] believe that the thing that that that
[46:23] Holy Spirit that quickened germ inside
[46:26] that's living inside of you is what the
[46:30] world is looking for
[46:32] it's the reason Elon Musk is going to
[46:35] Mars
[46:36] they they want to know how can we live
[46:38] how can a person live what how in the
[46:41] way that this world is going how can we
[46:44] live in the they can see themselves
[46:46] we're destroying one another and we're
[46:49] really robbing this planet of its
[46:52] resources and and how is it that we're
[46:53] going to live and we've got the answer
[46:58] we know how we're gonna live we know
[47:00] where we're gonna live we know what the
[47:02] size of that place is going to be we
[47:04] know who's going to be there and who's
[47:05] not going to be there we've got those
[47:08] answers
[47:11] but brother Branham says it's all in the
[47:14] approach
[47:17] so young people listen I've got a 15
[47:20] year old I've got a 14 year old I've got
[47:22] a 10 year old I've got a three-year-old
[47:26] and their daddy is a preacher
[47:30] but he's still a daddy
[47:33] he's still dead
[47:36] and to the teenagers I want to be friend
[47:40] I want to be buddy
[47:45] and there's so many times I want to make
[47:47] a point to my children I really want to
[47:49] get something to them I want to tell
[47:51] them how much I love them
[47:54] and and and and how the uh you know when
[47:58] the room isn't clean how I'm
[48:00] disappointed but I still love them
[48:04] but all that seems to come out is how
[48:07] disappointed I am
[48:08] so how do I get through to them
[48:12] that I love them
[48:14] it's all in the approach
[48:16] it's all in the approach
[48:19] so brother Brandon says
[48:22] now if he was a carpenter
[48:25] imagine you're a carpenter just take
[48:27] them in on the end here or brother
[48:29] borders over there's a carpenter I
[48:31] believe well what if he was driving with
[48:34] a hammer like this and driving nails and
[48:38] I had an automatic Hammer of some sort
[48:40] that I pour a keg of nails into and hold
[48:44] it up like this and
[48:46] and drive them boards up like that a
[48:49] whole lot better than he could with his
[48:51] hammer well that's called a nail gun
[48:54] today
[48:56] and we know what that is
[48:57] anybody that's done any framings like
[49:00] that Hitachi give me my Hitachi
[49:03] gotta have that Hitachi
[49:06] pass loader you know
[49:10] well what if you had one of those but
[49:12] you were talking to the Amish guy who
[49:15] doesn't have that and he's just nailing
[49:18] them up with just his 16 penny nails in
[49:21] a in a you know in a big stiletto hammer
[49:24] and he's driving those Nails in just by
[49:26] hand and you go hey I've got a
[49:30] I've got a nail gun
[49:33] duh
[49:36] brother Brandon saying now if I walk up
[49:38] to him and say ah boy you're not even in
[49:40] it you know nothing about it while
[49:42] you're mashing in your fingers Ma you
[49:45] just haven't got a product to begin with
[49:48] I'm offending him
[49:50] I'll never sell the hammer
[49:54] that's right see it's my Approach with
[49:57] what I have
[49:59] my product I know is better than what
[50:03] he's got
[50:04] but I've got to remember I got to
[50:07] approach him in the right way
[50:11] now I stop right there
[50:13] we all said amen we believe we've got
[50:17] what the world needs
[50:20] now how do we sell it to him
[50:27] how are we doing
[50:34] if I walk up to the person in the world
[50:37] say you've got the Holy Ghost
[50:41] well then you don't know you're just a
[50:42] you're dead you're dead it's where you
[50:45] stand you
[50:50] Hit the Road Jack
[50:53] it's the approach
[50:58] our sermon is give life
[51:03] and I suppose I could say this is a
[51:05] sermon for the ministry for you
[51:08] ministers that are in this building
[51:10] tonight this is for you
[51:12] but I could say fathers
[51:15] that have children and mothers that have
[51:18] children that desire them to receive
[51:20] this is for you
[51:22] and then I would say to you young people
[51:24] if you've got a friend
[51:25] that you just are yearning for them to
[51:29] to see the light this is for you
[51:32] and if you've got a co-worker
[51:35] that you know needs the Lord he's just
[51:37] he's tried every other way to satisfy
[51:40] his life but you know he needs the Lord
[51:43] I suppose this is for you
[51:45] so I I suppose then this evening it's
[51:48] for us all
[51:50] okay
[51:52] and if I walk up to him and say how do
[51:54] you do sir my name is Branham mine is
[51:57] borders
[51:58] I see you're a carpenter yes yes sir I
[52:01] am
[52:02] I really believe you're a real Carpenter
[52:05] too yes
[52:07] I was watching the way he was handling
[52:08] your Hammer oh yes oh Betsy has been
[52:11] with me a long time
[52:14] many of us that have been in carpentry
[52:16] we name our hammers
[52:19] I say yeah that's a good one yeah sure
[52:22] good too and you can really handle it
[52:24] yeah you know we just we used to do
[52:28] hammer tricks when we were framing you
[52:32] could spin our Hammers and then we would
[52:33] spin it and then turn it and spin it
[52:35] this way and then we'd throw it down in
[52:37] the into the loop that was what we did
[52:39] to entertain ourselves after we mashed
[52:41] our fingers
[52:45] go ahead talk to him a while I say it
[52:47] did you ever hear of the new such and
[52:49] such a hammer no I don't believe I ever
[52:53] did
[52:54] well here it is you put your nails in
[52:57] here and let's just tack those boards up
[53:00] up down there look at the time this does
[53:02] and what a product I've got show it to
[53:05] them like that say
[53:07] take it
[53:09] try it for a few days and see what you
[53:12] think about it
[53:14] it'll be I'll be back see if it's the
[53:18] right kind of a product it'll sell
[53:20] itself
[53:22] you know what I mean don't you brethren
[53:25] see
[53:27] see we got the right thing we got to
[53:31] approach the people with it right
[53:34] see that's the thing see it's the real
[53:38] genuine thing
[53:41] this is the holy spirit I believe it
[53:44] with all my heart
[53:48] I don't believe that Brethren are
[53:51] Renegades
[53:53] I believe their brethren
[53:57] I do not believe that the spirit that
[53:59] does the discernment is any soothsayer I
[54:02] believe it's the Holy Spirit revealing
[54:04] himself in his church just making the
[54:07] church come to its place
[54:12] oh my that does my heart so good to hear
[54:15] that
[54:17] that
[54:20] the world which when you would want to
[54:22] share with them the discernment or the
[54:25] gift that God sent this generation when
[54:29] he sent the gift in brother Branham we
[54:33] look at that and say what this is the
[54:36] most glorious gift to hit our generation
[54:40] a man who could look into somebody's
[54:43] life and say you live it such and such
[54:45] an address you've been to the doctor one
[54:47] two three four five surgeries but the
[54:51] doctor says he can't do anything for you
[54:53] thus saith the Lord go home in your will
[54:57] hear that and we think this is the most
[55:00] glorious thing I've ever heard in my
[55:02] life
[55:03] and the world says
[55:07] that's a witch doctor
[55:10] you go
[55:13] that's not the response I was looking
[55:14] for I was really hoping you were gonna
[55:16] say yeah that's really wonderful
[55:19] but instead you get the response I don't
[55:21] know about that
[55:23] I've seen a lot of fanaticism like that
[55:25] I don't know
[55:27] I'm gonna hold off
[55:29] no problem
[55:33] you ever experience
[55:36] the moving of the Holy Ghost
[55:39] you just try it on a few days I'll come
[55:42] around in a couple days I'll be around
[55:44] why because I love you
[55:51] I will be checking in on you again
[55:54] because I'm genuinely concerned about
[55:57] you
[55:58] I will be checking back in
[56:03] now unless we're wanting to rubber stamp
[56:05] a bunch of Believers in this world and
[56:07] just everybody at work come here Palm
[56:09] hella ghost Holy Ghost Holy Ghost Holy
[56:12] Ghost yeah did my job

[56:38] story where are you from would you why'd
[56:40] you come into our church
[56:42] well here's the thing
[56:47] I'm lonely
[56:49] I I you know I'm broke
[56:54] I'm looking for God
[56:56] most of all my soul is hungry suddenly
[56:59] your heart begins to bleed

[57:21] to a hotel we can you know help you get
[57:23] a haircut get a shower you know whatever
[57:26] but
[57:28] but what was that last thing you said
[57:30] I'm lonely and I'm looking for God
[57:35] okay I got something that you can try on
[57:39] for a few days and see if you like
[57:41] how about that
[57:43] I'll tell you what it sells itself I'm
[57:46] thinking about selling putting lawns in
[57:48] some of your front yards and then I'm in
[57:51] a year I'm gonna come take them away and
[57:52] then we'll see how much you loved it
[57:54] and then I know I'll have sold an
[57:57] artificial grass job at your house when
[57:59] I rip it out of your yard in a year
[58:03] it works
[58:07] I met a man one time he said best car
[58:10] salesman I ever met I was just buying a
[58:12] car from an individual
[58:15] no no he said it was a dealership he
[58:17] said I walked into that dealership he
[58:19] said I really couldn't even afford a new
[58:20] car he said but that dealer didn't come
[58:23] over you know how the dealers do when
[58:25] you go walk onto a car lot and you can
[58:27] like see them coming you know right out
[58:29] of the swamps you know slithering over
[58:32] we said this car salesman just kind of
[58:35] stood off and he said you know you're
[58:37] looking for any certain car well you
[58:39] know I was looking at this one and he
[58:40] just took the keys and he threw it to
[58:42] the guy and he said take it home for a
[58:44] couple days come back tell me what you
[58:46] think what you think he goes I bought
[58:49] that car
[58:50] he said I couldn't even afford that car
[58:51] but I bought it
[58:53] he said because that man knew how to
[58:56] sell a car he just said try it for a
[58:59] couple days and you might find that you
[59:01] like it
[59:03] I've got to tell you that growing up on
[59:07] under the Pew as a little baby and then
[59:10] finally up on the pew and around the Pew
[59:13] you know as your toddler but finally up
[59:15] on the Pew as a young person
[59:18] I've heard about the Holy Ghost so much
[59:20] I could finish quotes for you I could
[59:22] finish scriptures for you I could do all
[59:25] of that
[59:28] but then I met him
[59:34] and he didn't force himself on me
[59:36] but he just offered himself to me
[59:39] and it changed my life
[59:42] changed my heart
[59:45] change my desires
[59:55] if we could just have some way that we
[59:58] could take the whole Pentecostal move
[1:00:00] and just break down our little barriers
[1:00:01] and a place to come together and set in
[1:00:04] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus to which
[1:00:07] we're baptized in by one Spirit oh I
[1:00:10] think that there would be manifestations
[1:00:11] that had never been known before
[1:00:14] and if we could approach the Methodist
[1:00:17] the Baptist the Pentecostals could go
[1:00:21] everywhere to every place I believe it
[1:00:25] could be done
[1:00:28] oh my
[1:00:29] I would just love and I would just love
[1:00:34] to see
[1:00:36] a Baptist
[1:00:37] receive this
[1:00:39] I would love to see a Methodist receive
[1:00:41] this love to see Catholic receive this
[1:00:43] I'd love to see a Pentecostal receive
[1:00:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:49] I'd love to see it
[1:00:51] and it can be done
[1:00:56] here we are
[1:00:58] back in Romans
[1:01:03] Romans
[1:01:05] chapter 10 I'm going to just read verses
[1:01:07] one to eight and I just kind of want to
[1:01:09] emphasize really these first two verses
[1:01:11] really
[1:01:13] really three verses Brethren my heart's
[1:01:16] desire now this is Paul
[1:01:18] Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to
[1:01:22] God for Israel is
[1:01:25] that they might be saved
[1:01:28] for I bear them record that they have a
[1:01:31] Zeal of God but not according to
[1:01:34] knowledge for they being ignorant of
[1:01:37] God's righteousness now we already hit
[1:01:39] that this morning we know that's Christ
[1:01:43] and going about to establish their own
[1:01:46] righteousness
[1:01:48] have not submitted themselves unto the
[1:01:51] righteousness of God for Christ is
[1:01:56] the end of the law for righteousness to
[1:01:59] everyone that believeth for Moses
[1:02:01] describeth the righteousness which is of
[1:02:03] the law that the man which doeth those
[1:02:06] things shall live by them that that's
[1:02:07] the word of God
[1:02:11] but the righteousness which is of faith
[1:02:13] speaketh on this wise say not in thine
[1:02:16] heart who shall Ascend into heaven that
[1:02:19] is to bring Christ down from heaven or
[1:02:22] who shall descend into the deep that is
[1:02:24] to bring up Christ again from the dead
[1:02:27] but what saith it
[1:02:29] the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth
[1:02:34] and in thy heart that is the word of
[1:02:38] faith which we preach
[1:02:51] my heart's desire
[1:02:55] for my children
[1:02:57] is that they be saved
[1:02:59] heart's desire for my employees
[1:03:03] is that they'd be saved
[1:03:04] my heart's desire for every person I
[1:03:07] come and I see sitting on a pew
[1:03:10] that they be saved
[1:03:16] and I want to be able to convey it to
[1:03:18] them I want to be able to approach
[1:03:21] every individual that I come in contact
[1:03:23] in life
[1:03:24] not with the rubber stamp
[1:03:27] but with a life
[1:03:29] with a real life
[1:03:32] of what are you going through what is
[1:03:35] happening in your life
[1:03:38] can I relate to that or do I know
[1:03:41] someone who can
[1:03:43] and then if we can
[1:03:45] I enter in with you can I join with you
[1:03:48] in helping you overcome and if I can't
[1:03:51] do I know somebody who can and would you
[1:03:54] want would you want it would you want to
[1:03:57] know them and would you want the help in
[1:04:00] any way in any aspect of life would you
[1:04:02] want it
[1:04:04] now Pride Keeps Us Pride's a big one
[1:04:08] keeps a lot of us from accepting a lot
[1:04:10] of things we end up doing that to
[1:04:13] ourselves and I don't mean just in
[1:04:14] church I mean in life
[1:04:17] keeps us from from receiving a lot of
[1:04:19] help
[1:04:20] sometimes it's pride and then sometimes
[1:04:23] it's it's it's shame it's we're ashamed
[1:04:26] I'm ashamed I don't want to let him in I
[1:04:28] don't want to let him know ah if they
[1:04:30] found out that uh what would they think
[1:04:31] of me
[1:04:36] but let that thing Fester a while in
[1:04:38] your life and one day you'll cry out
[1:04:42] I need help and you may not cry out to
[1:04:45] that person
[1:04:46] but hopefully you'll cry out to God
[1:04:49] and maybe God will send that person
[1:04:52] again or
[1:04:54] maybe he'll deliver your you instantly
[1:04:56] or send somebody else
[1:04:59] but God is his whole desires that we'd
[1:05:02] be whole
[1:05:06] that's my desire
[1:05:11] now we read here Psalm 16 11. now we'll
[1:05:14] show me the path of life
[1:05:16] thou Wilt show me the path of life
[1:05:21] in thy presence is fullness of joy at
[1:05:23] thy right hand there are Pleasures
[1:05:24] forevermore brother Branham says oh
[1:05:27] excuse me David here was speaking of
[1:05:29] Life thou will show me the path of Life
[1:05:33] did you notice it will you show me or
[1:05:36] could you show me I hope you show me
[1:05:39] thou will show me
[1:05:43] I believe that everyone that God has
[1:05:46] called will hear and will come
[1:05:51] if you feel tonight I believe that I
[1:05:55] have this unction or there's something
[1:05:57] that is calling me to God well do you
[1:06:00] who do you think it is that's doing that
[1:06:01] Satan I don't think so
[1:06:04] so who is it that's giving you that tug
[1:06:07] in your heart that's giving you a call
[1:06:09] to God it's God Desiring to show you and
[1:06:13] me the path of life
[1:06:15] the path of life now listen what brother
[1:06:17] Branham says here I believe that that's
[1:06:20] what we're facing now in our meeting we
[1:06:22] can only sow the seed
[1:06:25] some will fall by the wayside sure we
[1:06:28] know that
[1:06:29] some will fall One Way some fall another
[1:06:31] but some will fall on good ground
[1:06:36] that's right show me the path of life
[1:06:41] now I'll stop here only to say this for
[1:06:44] the parents
[1:06:45] the advice that you offer your children
[1:06:48] sometimes will fall on deaf ears
[1:06:51] sometimes will fall on stubborn ears
[1:06:54] sometimes we'll fall I don't know on
[1:06:58] distracted ears but sometimes it'll fall
[1:07:01] in good ears
[1:07:04] that doesn't mean we give up as parents
[1:07:06] and say they're bad eggs
[1:07:10] hope not
[1:07:14] now life is the greatest thing that we
[1:07:18] could achieve
[1:07:20] there's nothing no greater than life
[1:07:24] who
[1:07:27] life
[1:07:29] now remember brother Brandon went in
[1:07:31] that hotel and there was a New Year's
[1:07:33] Eve there was those two girls steps out
[1:07:35] of the elevator they're drinking saying
[1:07:37] whoopee this is life
[1:07:39] and he tried to grab their hands and say
[1:07:41] girls that's not life
[1:07:44] death
[1:07:46] but let me show you real life and it was
[1:07:48] like get away from me you creep
[1:07:53] that's not life
[1:07:59] if I could go to Glory this morning and
[1:08:02] we could go up and go could all go up
[1:08:05] there and I could meet Abraham what's
[1:08:08] the greatest thing there is Abraham he'd
[1:08:10] say life
[1:08:12] there no matter what anything else is
[1:08:14] life is the greatest thing that anyone
[1:08:17] can achieve his life what would you give
[1:08:20] for life
[1:08:31] I believe it was
[1:08:33] random gives an example of
[1:08:37] a book that was written and there was
[1:08:39] some person famous person who said I
[1:08:43] would give everything for five more
[1:08:45] minutes of life and I want you to know
[1:08:47] it was
[1:08:49] oh Steve Jobs
[1:08:52] the creator of Microsoft the creator of
[1:08:55] Apple
[1:08:56] Microsoft not Microsoft
[1:08:58] Macintosh right mac Apple
[1:09:02] Steve Jobs died here a few years ago a
[1:09:04] young man in it by by by means of all
[1:09:07] you know the ages he was a young man
[1:09:10] considering I think he may have been the
[1:09:12] wealthiest man at the time
[1:09:14] he knew he was dying he had cancer and
[1:09:16] he knew he was dying he said I'd give
[1:09:18] every penny I had for 10 more minutes of
[1:09:21] life
[1:09:24] life
[1:09:26] that's just a man talking about natural
[1:09:29] living life
[1:09:31] what we're talking about is eternal life
[1:09:36] eternal life it's the greatest thing
[1:09:39] somebody could achieve
[1:09:40] eternal life
[1:09:43] it's the greatest thing it's what we're
[1:09:45] long for and you know what as far as
[1:09:47] your natural life I would ask that God
[1:09:50] would give you the fullest life that you
[1:09:54] could ever experience in the natural
[1:09:58] but if in the end you you had the
[1:10:01] fullest of life
[1:10:03] to know that when you go in that grave
[1:10:05] that is that is it
[1:10:07] I feel bad for you
[1:10:10] be happy that you got to live the kind
[1:10:12] of life that you thought was real full
[1:10:14] but I'd be real sad
[1:10:16] but for that person who knows that if my
[1:10:20] life is short if my life is is suffering
[1:10:23] and my life is miserable but to know
[1:10:25] that when when this life is over when
[1:10:28] this flesh drops into the Earth I've got
[1:10:30] I I I've only just begun living I've
[1:10:34] just started this eternal walk with God
[1:10:38] who buddy you have achieved
[1:10:46] brother random uses this quote so many
[1:10:48] times to know him is life you'll hear
[1:10:51] him say it over and over again not to
[1:10:53] know your Creed is life not even to know
[1:10:56] the Bible is life he says but to know
[1:10:58] him is life
[1:11:01] and he quotes it as if there's like it's
[1:11:03] a direct scripture and I looked for it
[1:11:06] and I couldn't find it but I found this
[1:11:10] John 14 6 Jesus saith unto him I am the
[1:11:14] way the truth and the life
[1:11:18] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:11:20] John 17 3 chapters later he's praying
[1:11:24] and he says and this is life eternal
[1:11:26] that they might Know Thee the only true
[1:11:29] God in Jesus Christ whom now has sent to
[1:11:33] know him
[1:11:35] is life
[1:11:36] to know God not to speculate of what is
[1:11:40] God where is God how could God but to
[1:11:44] know God
[1:11:45] but to say I know God
[1:11:49] that's a real presumptuous statement in
[1:11:52] the minds of all the scientists of this
[1:11:54] world how dare you
[1:11:57] but brother sister
[1:11:59] when I'm eating an apple
[1:12:01] and I ask you is this apple sweet or
[1:12:04] sour you say I don't know I'm not eating
[1:12:06] it I say that's right
[1:12:08] I'm the one eating it
[1:12:09] I know
[1:12:11] if this Apple's sweet or sour and when
[1:12:13] you meet Jesus Christ and you know him
[1:12:16] as God
[1:12:19] then you say to know God I know him
[1:12:24] I know God
[1:12:27] Rebrand goes on and he's telling a story
[1:12:29] his mother just passed away recently his
[1:12:32] sister Dolores he says Dolores called me
[1:12:35] and she said Billy I just can't get over
[1:12:37] it she said mother
[1:12:39] I said Dolores
[1:12:40] look out across the road from where you
[1:12:43] live
[1:12:44] isn't there a large oak tree standing
[1:12:46] there she said yes
[1:12:48] this is just a few days before mother
[1:12:50] died
[1:12:51] she said yes
[1:12:53] I said it's coming fall now
[1:12:56] I said about a month ago those leaves
[1:12:58] were real pretty and green yes she said
[1:13:00] bill
[1:13:01] I said when was what does it look like
[1:13:03] now
[1:13:05] she said well they're yellow and brown
[1:13:07] and green red I said Dolores what makes
[1:13:11] them turn yellow brown green and red she
[1:13:13] said they're dying I said when was the
[1:13:16] tree its prettiest
[1:13:18] she said now
[1:13:21] I said the Bible said precious in the
[1:13:24] sight of the Lord is the death of his
[1:13:26] Saints see
[1:13:27] that's when the time comes I said the
[1:13:30] life is going back
[1:13:33] life is a tree
[1:13:36] we're all hanging on a tree of life
[1:13:40] that's right
[1:13:45] now the imagery is in your head right
[1:13:47] now
[1:13:48] you see the tree
[1:13:50] and you see the leaves
[1:13:52] and you know about the Turning of the
[1:13:54] colors
[1:13:55] not not the saguaros
[1:13:58] but like the oak tree
[1:14:00] and I got to tell you
[1:14:02] up in Flagstaff
[1:14:05] I know it's coming fall
[1:14:08] and a part of me is so happy to see
[1:14:11] those beautiful colors
[1:14:13] so pretty
[1:14:14] we just love to take people and let's go
[1:14:17] up into the Aspens let's go look at the
[1:14:19] leaves turning and get graduation
[1:14:21] pictures and the Aspen leaves and
[1:14:25] we love that
[1:14:26] but I know what's coming next
[1:14:29] and part of my anxiousness begins to
[1:14:32] come up within me because
[1:14:34] it's going to get cold
[1:14:37] Winter's coming
[1:14:40] and I begin to get nervous
[1:14:43] but it's fall again
[1:14:46] we're coming into fall again
[1:14:52] and every year it comes
[1:14:54] and every year it goes
[1:14:59] life is a tree
[1:15:02] we're all hanging on a tree of life
[1:15:10] about 50 paragraphs later
[1:15:13] brethren
[1:15:15] we are hanging on the tree of life
[1:15:18] and someday
[1:15:20] this old Leaf is going to drop off
[1:15:23] but there will come a resurrection
[1:15:25] someday
[1:15:27] a great Millennium lays ahead of us
[1:15:30] a great Resurrection
[1:15:32] we'll come back again someday
[1:15:35] because we have
[1:15:37] eternal life
[1:15:39] we understand it from the way of a word
[1:15:42] if we had time you know how it is we
[1:15:44] could approach it by many ways
[1:15:48] people sometime you have to use
[1:15:50] different methods to get to a person
[1:15:55] hey I I love that we're not all the same
[1:15:59] we're individuals
[1:16:01] and we each
[1:16:03] can can can can understand things in
[1:16:06] different ways I've met so many people
[1:16:08] who say you know I'm an audible learner
[1:16:11] I I learn by by hearing I you know I
[1:16:13] have to have an Autumn I have to hear an
[1:16:15] audio book going for me to understand I
[1:16:17] can't read I can't sit and read a book
[1:16:20] I'm not real good at it I have to have
[1:16:22] it played for me and then I really soak
[1:16:24] up more I've seen I've heard uh people
[1:16:27] argue you know for me I have to sit in
[1:16:29] front of a TV all the time I'm going I
[1:16:32] don't I that's tough for me to believe
[1:16:34] but
[1:16:36] okay
[1:16:38] but we all learn different ways
[1:16:43] now brother Branham goes on
[1:16:45] and he tells a story
[1:16:47] I'm gonna be I'm gonna be sure sister
[1:16:49] Beth I'm gonna be sure
[1:16:52] I know you're gonna have words with me
[1:16:54] afterwards too okay
[1:17:02] as a landscaper
[1:17:07] the lesson from the tree I get it
[1:17:10] see it all the time I understand it I
[1:17:14] used to
[1:17:17] you could probably catch me out in the
[1:17:19] middle of somebody's property on a good
[1:17:22] spring day when the wind is howling you
[1:17:25] used to probably catch me saying words
[1:17:27] verbally out loud
[1:17:29] like I'm a crazy person
[1:17:31] and punching and fighting and throwing
[1:17:35] things
[1:17:36] and somebody would probably look out
[1:17:37] their window of their house going what
[1:17:39] is wrong with that guy out there
[1:17:42] but the wind when you're shoveling out a
[1:17:45] ditch to put in a water line or
[1:17:48] something and you throw a whole shovel
[1:17:50] full of dirt that way and the wind just
[1:17:52] carries it right back into your eyeballs
[1:17:55] I think God
[1:17:58] why
[1:18:00] did you allow wind to exist
[1:18:06] and then you go home and you're not only
[1:18:09] sunburned but wind burned
[1:18:12] and you're putting aloe vera on your
[1:18:15] face and laying in bed tenderly going
[1:18:18] why the wind why the wind and your
[1:18:22] windows are shaking
[1:18:26] going why the wind and you're just
[1:18:29] grading
[1:18:32] and then I heard brother Branham say
[1:18:36] that the wind is for the growth of the
[1:18:38] trees
[1:18:40] that the Wind Blows the tree and all
[1:18:43] that weight up top in the top of the
[1:18:45] tree shakes the tree and it causes the
[1:18:48] dirt underneath around the roots to get
[1:18:51] loose it Wiggles a little bit of room in
[1:18:54] the soil so now the roots can expand
[1:18:57] Now The Roots can go longer
[1:18:59] and when I heard brother Branham say
[1:19:01] that I never complained about the
[1:19:04] winning no I can't say that I never
[1:19:06] complained
[1:19:07] but instead
[1:19:09] while I was gritting my teeth in the
[1:19:11] Wind
[1:19:13] I said Thank you Lord for the growth
[1:19:18] thank you for the trials in life that
[1:19:21] help the trees to grow deeper and more
[1:19:25] in love with you
[1:19:29] now I can understand now from
[1:19:33] Landscaping I can learn from the things
[1:19:36] like the trees I understand us hanging
[1:19:39] on a tree of life like a leaf and as I
[1:19:42] get older I understand the seasons of
[1:19:46] Life getting older
[1:19:49] and the life going back and one day
[1:19:52] those trees and those leaves they drop
[1:19:55] off and when you begin losing friends
[1:19:59] who go home to be with the Lord and you
[1:20:02] recognize those leaves falling off of
[1:20:04] the tree
[1:20:06] you really begin to understand what that
[1:20:09] is
[1:20:10] but the lesson of that tree coming back
[1:20:13] again and those leaves coming back again
[1:20:17] the next spring to know that that tree's
[1:20:21] Not Dead
[1:20:23] that tree's alive
[1:20:24] and there will be life again
[1:20:27] and brothers and sisters that's how now
[1:20:30] I can understand
[1:20:32] eternal life not uh uh uh what is uh the
[1:20:37] the the belief of uh coming coming back
[1:20:41] is something else reincarnation
[1:20:44] but Resurrection
[1:20:49] now I put this up here a nice beautiful
[1:20:52] tree
[1:20:54] nice and green and you see the root
[1:20:55] system
[1:20:57] of that tree and that's a good healthy
[1:21:00] tree look at that so flourishing and
[1:21:03] that's you young people so healthy
[1:21:06] and then we get to fall
[1:21:11] and though that's a root system if you
[1:21:13] just cover up that bottom green part it
[1:21:16] just looks like a tree
[1:21:18] at the end of fall
[1:21:19] that's lost all its leaves
[1:21:23] while there's
[1:21:26] green leaves
[1:21:27] full trees
[1:21:29] on this part of the Earth
[1:21:33] on another part of the Earth
[1:21:36] there's this now right now
[1:21:38] we're getting pretty close up in
[1:21:40] Flagstaff
[1:21:41] if you want to come visit before too
[1:21:43] long it
[1:21:44] you'll still get leaves but after
[1:21:46] hearing a little bit that's what
[1:21:47] flagstaff's gonna look like the trees up
[1:21:49] in Flagstaff but you know that it's
[1:21:53] becoming into fall here
[1:21:55] now but down in Australia
[1:21:59] they're coming into spring
[1:22:03] they're just working on this
[1:22:11] and brother sister
[1:22:14] we can't afford to let people that we
[1:22:16] love
[1:22:17] and who Christ has died for get away
[1:22:21] from this life
[1:22:23] to die without life eternal
[1:22:26] let's do everything we can
[1:22:31] should have I should have highlighted
[1:22:33] that
[1:22:34] let's do everything we can
[1:22:39] to get them into that place
[1:22:41] where they can rise again in the
[1:22:43] resurrection
[1:22:44] thou will show me the path of life
[1:22:54] there are some things we can't do
[1:22:59] baby
[1:23:01] but the things that we can do
[1:23:04] the things that God has given you the
[1:23:06] gifts God has given you get our sisters
[1:23:11] brother Reggie
[1:23:15] each and every one of you the things
[1:23:17] that God has given you
[1:23:19] want to use it
[1:23:22] to try to give life
[1:23:28] in Ezekiel chapter 37 verses 3 through 5
[1:23:31] and he said unto me son of man can these
[1:23:34] bones live
[1:23:35] and I answered O Lord God thou knowest
[1:23:40] again he said unto me prophesy upon
[1:23:43] these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry
[1:23:45] Bones hear the word of the Lord
[1:23:48] thus saith the Lord God unto these bones
[1:23:50] behold I will cause breath
[1:23:53] to enter into you and ye shall live
[1:24:03] the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth
[1:24:11] there's a story
[1:24:13] there's a musical group their name is
[1:24:15] Phillips Craig and Dean
[1:24:18] and they're all pastors
[1:24:21] and uh
[1:24:24] the Phillips part of the group I forgot
[1:24:27] his name but something Phillips
[1:24:31] they wrote a song and the story behind
[1:24:34] this song went like this
[1:24:37] there was a patient Mrs Johnson who went
[1:24:40] in for uh heart condition heart surgery
[1:24:44] open heart surgery
[1:24:47] and you may have heard this story this
[1:24:49] happened some time ago
[1:24:51] and the surgeon
[1:24:53] went in opened up the chest cavity took
[1:24:56] her heart did the repairs that he could
[1:24:59] with the surgery
[1:25:02] and then he began to massage the heart
[1:25:04] he put the heart back into the chest
[1:25:05] cavity but he began to real softly begin
[1:25:08] to massage the heart and and by hand
[1:25:11] pump on that heart
[1:25:14] and this is and that's factual they
[1:25:17] really do do that
[1:25:18] and they begin to massage the heart to
[1:25:20] get it beating again
[1:25:23] and it wouldn't beat again now normally
[1:25:26] it would it just this would this process
[1:25:29] worked in an open heart surgery but it
[1:25:31] wouldn't wouldn't work her heart was not
[1:25:33] beating again
[1:25:35] so they took a little bit more drastic
[1:25:37] measures and still
[1:25:40] the heart would not beat
[1:25:43] and the story is that the surgeon
[1:25:46] leaned down next to the patient who's
[1:25:48] laying on the table unconscious
[1:25:51] and he whispered in her ear and he said
[1:25:54] Mrs Johnson I just want you to know
[1:25:57] the surgery
[1:25:58] was performed and it was successful
[1:26:01] but now I need you to tell your heart to
[1:26:05] beat again
[1:26:08] and immediately her heart began beating
[1:26:11] again
[1:26:20] and I tell that story
[1:26:27] because though we want to reach out for
[1:26:31] those that have yet heard the word of
[1:26:32] God though we want to give life though
[1:26:34] we want to be able to approach them
[1:26:37] in such a way
[1:26:40] that they would desire the baptism of
[1:26:44] the Holy Ghost
[1:26:49] there are some people who've experienced
[1:26:51] it and they're walking in it
[1:26:56] and they're sitting in the church and
[1:26:59] they've been there years and years and
[1:27:00] years and they know about the things of
[1:27:02] God and they love God
[1:27:05] but devastational things have happened
[1:27:07] in their life
[1:27:09] hard things have happened
[1:27:18] and as much as we want new life as much
[1:27:20] as we want the new life to come on this
[1:27:22] tree and we want this tree to grow out
[1:27:25] we want new leaves and we want longer
[1:27:28] branches and we want this tree to grow
[1:27:30] Fuller
[1:27:33] what we don't want to see is the tree
[1:27:35] the leaves that have been there for
[1:27:37] years to drop off
[1:27:38] to die to be cut short
[1:27:41] prematurely
[1:27:54] some people know what that feels like
[1:27:58] like you've had a real heart damage
[1:28:02] in your own church
[1:28:11] brother Branham said
[1:28:13] in one of those earlier quotes I believe
[1:28:16] these brothers are real brothers they're
[1:28:17] not Renegades
[1:28:20] not Renegades
[1:28:22] they're Brothers
[1:28:24] and I could safely honestly I could
[1:28:26] safely say before you here this evening
[1:28:30] that every one of the ministers that's
[1:28:32] in this room I want to tell you that I
[1:28:34] believe their desire is to give life
[1:28:40] I believe if they've received the
[1:28:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they
[1:28:43] understand and they they're recognizing
[1:28:45] the day their day and their message
[1:28:47] they're recognizing where we're living
[1:28:49] they understand they they believe would
[1:28:51] you believe and maybe they approach
[1:28:53] things differently than the way you
[1:28:54] would approach things and and so many
[1:28:56] times somebody's offended at something
[1:28:58] they would say but ultimately I believe
[1:29:01] they're Brothers
[1:29:02] I believe their desire is to give life
[1:29:06] sometimes we can be damaged in church we
[1:29:09] can get hurt
[1:29:10] real hurt
[1:29:14] and it's it's more those
[1:29:17] those pains in church that I would think
[1:29:20] of God the great surgeon the great
[1:29:23] physician
[1:29:24] leaning down to us
[1:29:27] and and whispering to us in service tell
[1:29:30] your heart to beat again
[1:29:34] I know your heart's been damaged
[1:29:36] there's a broken heart syndrome is a
[1:29:40] real thing people die of
[1:29:45] tell your heart to beat again
[1:29:49] surgery was successful the surgery was
[1:29:53] successful God's A Healer
[1:29:55] God's a provider we believe that now
[1:29:58] tell your heart to beat again
[1:30:01] speak to those Dry Bones speak prophesy
[1:30:05] the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth
[1:30:07] tell your heart to beat again
[1:30:10] brother Branham makes this statement as
[1:30:13] my last statement sister Beth so we can
[1:30:15] have words here shortly in a few minutes
[1:30:17] okay
[1:30:19] he says say God
[1:30:21] say God it's the truth
[1:30:25] and there alone I stand
[1:30:28] God your word is true
[1:30:31] I believe it I'm standing upon that
[1:30:35] and let that just keep in here
[1:30:37] until it drops down into here
[1:30:41] from your head to your heart
[1:30:44] and becomes a reality
[1:30:46] then it'll work
[1:30:49] now don't try to pretend don't try to
[1:30:51] kid yourself
[1:30:52] don't say it did it dropped it dropped
[1:30:56] you'll know
[1:30:57] it'll work itself
[1:30:59] it'll sell itself you don't have to
[1:31:02] convince anybody that it's the Holy
[1:31:04] Ghost the Holy Ghost will bear itself
[1:31:06] record if it dropped from here to here
[1:31:09] it will bear fruit
[1:31:11] it will you drink more than your
[1:31:14] allotted portion and it will push out
[1:31:18] fruit
[1:31:19] Let It Drop from here to here and
[1:31:23] becomes a reality then it'll work only
[1:31:25] can it work when it comes to the heart
[1:31:32] I heard it said one time I I thought
[1:31:35] brother Branham said it I couldn't find
[1:31:36] it I would love for you Brothers to find
[1:31:38] it and come and and give it to me so
[1:31:40] that I could pin it and and tag it but I
[1:31:44] heard it say somebody say it like this
[1:31:45] one time the greatest distance that God
[1:31:48] has got to travel is that 18 inches from
[1:31:52] here to here
[1:31:55] not from the other end of the universe
[1:31:57] not from that far-off Galaxy that the JW
[1:32:00] Webb is trying to find that other uh in
[1:32:04] infinite reality that's yours
[1:32:07] from here
[1:32:09] to here
[1:32:13] it'll only work
[1:32:15] when it drops down into here
[1:32:19] I just love that brother Branham
[1:32:22] I just love that brother Brandon would
[1:32:24] say
[1:32:27] when he was talking about brother Billy
[1:32:28] Graham
[1:32:35] how the brother Billy said it's you
[1:32:36] preachers it's you lazy preachers got
[1:32:39] your feet up on the desks
[1:32:41] brother Branham made it clear and he
[1:32:43] said it's not
[1:32:45] it's they're not taking them far enough
[1:32:49] it's taking somebody not just to a
[1:32:52] Justified condition not just to a
[1:32:54] Sanctified condition but all the way to
[1:32:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:00] all the way introducing them all the way
[1:33:02] to A Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:33:05] today and forever not a historic Jesus
[1:33:08] not a story of a Jesus not a picture of
[1:33:11] a Jesus not an icon of a Jesus but an
[1:33:14] actual the real person of the of Jesus
[1:33:18] Christ in this day the baptism of the
[1:33:21] Holy Ghost and when somebody really
[1:33:24] fully truly meets him and and and
[1:33:27] receives that life into themselves
[1:33:30] that's when they can rest and it's no
[1:33:33] longer wrestling up here this is the
[1:33:35] greatest battle ever fought we know is
[1:33:37] is is up here but when it's settled is
[1:33:40] when it comes down into here and you say
[1:33:42] the battle is won
[1:33:44] the battle I was having that battle has
[1:33:47] been won now will there be more yes
[1:33:50] there will be more but when it drops
[1:33:52] from here to here that one will be won
[1:33:54] and when the next one comes and that one
[1:33:57] and and and the turmoil comes up in here
[1:34:00] and it drops from here to here that one
[1:34:02] will be one and it will be a life of
[1:34:04] overcoming it will be a life of battles
[1:34:07] one because it's dropped from here to
[1:34:10] here say Lord I believe it I'm standing
[1:34:13] upon it and then let it drop Let It Drop
[1:34:16] what is that going to take brother is
[1:34:18] that going to take a few minutes in
[1:34:19] prayer maybe is it going to take a few
[1:34:21] hours maybe maybe a week maybe as
[1:34:24] Abraham would say 25 years but if you
[1:34:27] can stand upon the word of God it will
[1:34:30] come to pass
[1:34:31] we want to give life I want life I want
[1:34:35] life for our children I want life for
[1:34:37] our young people I want life in our
[1:34:39] churches and for those that are saying
[1:34:41] I've got I I've been damaged I've been
[1:34:44] hurt I want life for you too
[1:34:48] I want your youth to be renewed like the
[1:34:50] eagles
[1:34:51] to be able to rise up on the wings
[1:34:54] like an eagle
[1:34:56] amen God bless you this evening let's

[1:35:00] would come
[1:35:17] you know the goodness of God goodness of

[1:35:38] could achieve is life

[1:35:57] our children enjoying life
[1:36:00] to see them go places and make friends
