verse 1. [Music] beautiful beautiful scripture [Music] says this Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty we're with Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage let's pray almighty God we thank you Lord that we can step out of this bondage of the world that the shackles that the enemy has placed upon us and Lord we can be free in Jesus Christ join us Lord this morning and anoint me I pray that father that I could point to a Christ that can take these bonds of slavery from a Dying World in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen God bless you all you can take your seats thank you I thinking on this subject title my sermon slavery by our own choosing and we we see this word bondage and slavery we see it all throughout the Bible from the Old Testament all through the New Testament and I think that more than any other age and of course we don't see out outward slavery today like we have Through the Ages but I think more than any other age that there is slavery in the world and more people are bound in slavery today than I believe that they ever have been and we know that we have a Christ a holy spirit that will liberate us from the slavery I uh let me read the definition we all know what it means but let me read the definition of slavery it says a person who is forced to work for this is a slave a person that is forced to work for and Obey another and is considered to be their property an enslaved person and I think that we may not be be bound today by shackles or in a jail cell but we are bound by sin and it it ruins everything it just it hurts our lives so much in Exodus the 21st chapter Moses is describing this year of Liberation so we would a slave would work for his his or her slave master for six years and then in that seventh year that slave would have the opportunity to to go free and there was there's a few stipulations here that that number one that that slave had to choose to go free that's that's the main thing that slave had to make that choice but second all the dead slave had acquired during that time of slavery had to stay with the slave master it's it's kind of a sad story and I don't know how all that worked out but but if that slave chose to go free then if he married a wife while he was in bondage or had children when he was in bondage then those children had to stay and for you young people be very very careful when maybe you might stray or you might you might sin like all all of us have done be very careful about yoking yourself up with someone while you're in that condition because what might happen is is when you want to come out of that condition that person that your yoke to might want to stay in that condition they might want to stay under bondage of the world so be very very careful when you're not living right or you're you're walking the line and yoking yourself up to something that you can see might not want to change as you change and I've seen it I've seen it so often I've seen so many marriages fail I've seen children and and and parents how they end up they end up hating each other and they they end end up separated from each other because one said I want to make this change in my life I want to go go to the Lord and start serving the lord and the others are like wait a minute I didn't make that choice that's your choice I make my own choices and they stay there so be we need to always use great caution especially if we have chosen to sin especially if we have chosen to live a life that's not serving the lord I would say that the first choice would be to serve the Lord and you can save yourself a lot of problems but if you don't do that and you are straying use great caution in what you're doing because Satan as the Bible said is crouching at the door and he is ready to devour you but then if you can come to Christ then he will liberate he will liberate you and I want to talk today about about the bondage that that we see in the world and and how it's it's so sad but friends I think that all of us struggle with some of the things that I'm going to talk about all of us struggle with slavery of some sort to where we let something else rule over our lives Paul said I believe um Paul said that he says I am a prisoner for Christ and that is the only Master we should have is our lord Jesus but we so often as as you're going to hear we so often put other things as our task master we put other things as our rulers in our lives so much so that we worship these things not knowingly not outwardly worshiping these things but we put it as the authority in our lives let's see what Jesus said about this let's turn to John chapter 8. this morning I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about more about the religious side of things because I believe it's more important and then tonight I'm going to follow up with some of the Natural Things that become our slave master John chapter 8 verse 31 it says this then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed now Joseph now notice Jesus specifically told them that if you believe me and if you continue in my word then you are my disciples I would go on to say that if you are continuing in someone else's word or taking someone else's authority over things then you become that person's disciples we look at the prophets in the bible and all the prophets they all had disciples you may not know that but they did they had disciples these these brothers that would follow them and and I know that when I was in Israel there was there was this place called the Tomb of the prophets and it was it was this cave that was dug out and there was these tubes I don't know they're maybe about this big around where you could kind of shove a dead body in there and it was it was it was hewed out of the stone and then there were these as you went into the cave there were these holes that were there that used to be where people were buried and each each area that's in this cave had a number of these holes these little places inside of it and I was asking I was asking the guy that was showing me he says well this is where Malachi was buried in this one little room and he said these were Malachi's disciples that were buried with them and then he went to the other Prophet I don't remember which one it was but there was like three prophets in there and and the prophet had his place and then the disciples were buried with them so we see that all of these prophets they had these people that followed with them and we can see that in the scripture but when Jesus came then everyone became his disciple there were still prophets that came you know you had Paul and you had the different ones that still had that gift of Prophecy they were prophets but they told us be Christ's disciple so much so that in First Corinthians chapter 1 Paul is very plain he says some of you say that you're from cephas Peter some of you say you're of Paula some of you say that you're a Paul and he said he says you know he says did Paul was he crucified for you were you baptized in the name of Paul no we are Christ's disciples and every Prophet from Genesis to Revelation and especially in the New Testament they pointed to that man Jesus Christ and we see a separation that goes on when we get outside of that and it's been going on for millennia it's uh let's continue on with John verse 32. and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and this is one of the scriptures that did so much for me just over the years and when I would sometimes I would see things that in the religious areas of my life I would see things that this doesn't make sense why are we doing this when I can see that the prophet spoke differently or I can see that this book speaks differently of what we're doing I don't I don't understand [Applause] and many times my my eyes would rest on this scripture that says and the truth shall make you free if we can just understand if we can just take in this truth that God has given us then we can have our own relationship with God and we can understand these things and we're not reliant on somebody always feeding us because what if that person is wrong but if I can commune directly with our Lord he's never wrong I'll be wrong all the time but he is never wrong if you receive the truth and he's telling his audience that he's he's talking to these people and these These are Jews it says these are they're Pharisees but they're also his friends he grew up with probably they're people that he knew maybe in the market people that he had talked to fellowshipped with it's it's there's there's Pharisees there and there's scribes there and there's all these different different uh conglomeration of people all different so a good variety here and Jesus is saying that the truth will make you free so if you think about that statement wait a minute if you're saying that Something's Gonna Make Me free you're saying I'm in bondage right now right or else why would you want to why would you need to be free if you're not in bondage next verse and they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou you shall be made free we've never been in bondage what are you talking about we're free we can do whatever we want yet Jesus is saying you are a slave and it it looks to me the way this is written it looks like it offended them who do you think you are I've got it right I've got a good church that I go to I like my pastor I like what we teach you know now those Sadducees I don't really like them you know they've got it all wrong you know and the esteems out there they're weird you know they're on the desert and they're they're doing their but we're right we've got it all we understand it all we were never in bondage how say us thou ye shall be made free Jesus answering them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin wow what a statement so if you are sinning Jesus is saying then you are a slave to that sin that you're committing what a statement and you know that they probably didn't like that when when he said that he says you know we've we you know we've never been a a slave to anyone you can say here in the United States it's been 150 years since there was slavery here what what are you talking about but Jesus said that you are that slave and if we remember back in Exodus they had a chance to leave after those seven years they had the opportunity I can go but if I stay if I stay and sometimes they probably had a good a slave owner they probably had maybe a man that that loved his slaves that that was a was a good um that took care of them that wasn't mean to them so if they wanted to stay or if they wanted to stay because they had they had a wife and they had children or what it might whatever it might be or they've simply liked being a Slave you know I don't like going out and working on my own I don't have to worry about putting food on the table I just want to get up in the morning go work all day come back and if I'm good I don't get whipped and I just want to come home to my family and I just want to live this life of slavery my whole life and I'm not really I don't really care about anything else and if that was the case then after these then then in this seventh year then they would take this slave and they would bore a hole in his ear and then that person was marked you are now a bondsman to this slave owner because of that that Mark that's on you now we we preach against earrings using that scripture and but in this case it was a mark that this man or this whoever it was said I want to stay a Slave and the bad thing is this is the the saddest part about what I'm what I'm going to say today is they chose that and we choose our own slave masters we make that choice it is up to us do I want to serve this slave master or do I want to be liberated through Christ and we know since the Holy Spirit fell since Jesus came that there is no bondage you no longer have to be bound to sin because of the blood of Jesus Christ now we see people more and more and more choosing I want to be a Slave you know um I see one of the the most difficult spirits I have ever dealt with not the most difficult but one of the most difficult spirits that I've ever dealt with is a drug addict I have counseled so many people they they come in and they're addicted to these drugs they might start with painkillers and then it gets more and more and then they get addicted and and they want more and then it might turn to heroin or a lot of times it's alcoholism and they don't want to stop they worship that and it it totally rules their lives when they start coming down off of that high they will do anything to get it back that's slave master starting to snap his fingers all right you You Gotta Serve me again and they they will lie they will cheat they will steal do anything they would go into the hospital and my wife tells me that they will go into the hospital and they're the nicest people oh nurse Stephanie we I love you so much and and how sweet you are as long as she's pumping the Dilaudid into the veins or the painkillers in there but when she can't when she can't press that button anymore because it's gone and you can't have another one for four hours you see the claws come out you see I need that no you don't need it but they that slave master is always on top of him saying you need it serve me and they do they want it and it is the most important things in their life they'll sell their wife out their son out their daughter out they will sell anything to get those drugs and we've all you don't have to raise your hand but pretty much all of us have seen it that addiction that slave master that is over those people and you know and it's it's become an epidemic in our country where we have all these homeless people now they'll give it all up man you know I don't even have I don't have a house I don't have a car I don't have I don't have anything but as soon as I get my check from the government I'm going to get my fix that's all I care about I'll sleep on the street and I'll get attacked I'll do whatever get robbed all the time you know they're always fighting and and doing each other dirty but as long as they get their fix that's why you know I I feel so bad for those people but I've witnessed to so many of them and I've tried I've reached out so many times but I don't think I have ever seen one recover I'm sure you have and I hope that you have I know there have been but that drug rules them they might come off of it for a little while and then they'll come up missing for who knows how long and it's because the slave master snapped his finger you know we we talk about that but then there's other things that when it snaps its fingers for us we hop to it too we might not have a problem with drugs but we might have a problem with temper you know we might have if somebody says something wrong to you somebody gets under your skin a little bit slave master I'm I'm the boss I'm in charge and you let it out you know and you say things and later you might regret it or you're driving in your car listen a car even if your windows are closed a car is not this magical force field that keeps you from sinning when you're inside that car you're as much of a sinner inside as you are outside and Jesus knows exactly what you're doing inside that car so you're driving along this guy cuts you off and every word that you say is recorded every thought that you have oh and the time that you sped up so he couldn't get in the lane it counts it matters that's that temper that's rising up that's that slave master that he snaps his fingers and we're right up to it even on the street or wherever we are he's the boss but we can we can overcome that I'm going to read a scripture in a little bit I read last week I'm going to read it again here in a little while social media I'm going to talk about tonight that's one of the most obvious ones you know I mean that that little light goes off and that Ding goes off and oh you know yes boss what can I do for you fear fear is one of those task Masters that it controls so many people's lives I'm afraid I'm afraid to take the next step you know and I have to say that how many how many times in this book does it say fear not why does it say fear not it says fear not because he's saying don't be afraid why because there's so much fear there's so much fear in the world and yet we we know we have Jesus we know that that everything he said will come to pass we know we have all these promises yet we are so afraid many times just to get sick you know we're we're afraid that oh it could be this when just on the other side you know what's waiting for us if we're right if this task master isn't our our leader if our leader is Christ you know what's on the other side who cares if we get sick oh man it's it's the best time you know I was talking with uh um well I went to visit brother Marriott and I see and I look at the the brother and and I feel so bad he's just laboring for every breath just struggling but what greater time in his whole life than is it right now it's the greatest time I was witnessing to to a lady she was she was walking in and and she was all sad and and I you know I talked to her about the Lord she said well we're not believers and I said well now's a good time to be and you know she was talking about something else that happened I said I want to tell the story she was I was getting in the elevator and I was going up to see them and this lady's in there and she's looking at me I don't know she's probably in her 60s or 70s and I said uh I said how's your day she says terrible she said my son got electrocuted and he's brain dead and he's dying I said wow I said I'm sorry do you hear that I said I said I said I'm a minister I says there's something I can do I said I'd like to do something for you and she said well no she's we're not believers and I said well it would be a good time to start right now and she kind of looked at me like well she didn't say no but she meant no I thought who was the task master here who's the slave I don't care if you believe in God or not your son there's still life going through his veins there's still hope but she hasn't been taught that way how important how important it would have been if she would have just had that hope maybe it wouldn't have happened maybe it would have happened it's happened a lot of times so we but but there's just there's a constantly there's a constant fear so often plaguing us that we're afraid to do anything and I got to tell you the truth I'm I struggle with it Lord with the church it's like Lord I'm afraid what if it fails what if I fail the people and I look and and that's that's when the devil boy he will give me every single time I've failed my whole life and last week in the past day you know he puts it right in there and this fear comes over me and I can't do it you know I'm afraid I'm afraid to to do the young people stuff what if it fails what if it doesn't work I'm I'm afraid with the church it's like Lord what about what about if we're if we're to take up an offering what if the people get what if the people get offended you know and I'm looking at all of these different things and Lord if what if I fail I can't do it but something carries us through and something gets gets just it just it's something that just gives you strength you know and I say you know what I'll fail then I'll fail I've done it a lot I'm good at it I'll do it again but I will keep trying keep serving keep working keep moving if we fail we fail it's okay but if we don't try that's not okay it doesn't mean enough to us then we take on the task master of being the laziness or not wanting to do it not wanting to get up and serve someone now I I think of Peter with fear and the the they were out in the boat and and the the this it was dark and the lightning was crashing and the Thunder and the waves were going and and they're all afraid and they look out there and they see Jesus walking on the water imagine the fear of a little boat and they see him out there and Peter says Lord if it's you been me to come he says come on Peter gets out of the boat walks on the water and then he gets scared fear comes on the Taskmaster says you're gonna die Peter starts to sink and he cries out to the Lord Jesus he reaches his hand up Jesus grabs him pulls him up and all of a sudden you know they're back to the shore imagine if Peter would have been too afraid to step out into the water the fact is Peter walked on the water he did it and the second fact is is Jesus as he always does reach down and pull them out and that is what he will always do no matter how afraid we are if we'll trust in him we'll reach out that hand like Peter did he'll pull us right back out don't ever worry he's there but you gotta step out you gotta get out of the boat and then if you do fail like we all do then the guilt starts and I struggle with that one a guy said I look back at all the things that I've done all the things that all the dumb things that I've said and then it just starts working on me and and I start dwelling on them and we struggle so much with our past sins we struggle with every these things that we've done it's like and the devil is so good at throwing them back there but as I said in the last service it's a lack of faith if we can't keep those under the blood it's a lack of faith if we can't believe that Jesus actually died for it first time it's over it's us that keep bringing about bringing it out and bringing it out but we can't do it no matter what we've done and how bad we feel no matter how much we try to bring that out there is nothing there to bring out it's gone Jesus died once for our sins and it's gone and I've seen people struggle with that so much struggle with they think that they have sinned so far they think that they have committed blasphemy all the way to they take their own lives not even knowing that those sins were completely gone but the enemy he puts he puts those things back on there the Bible says in First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 13. let me read this this is just no matter how bad you think that these these this Taskmaster is no matter how strong you think he is no matter how much those Cravings that the as the drug addict would say no matter how bad you think your temper is no matter how weak you think you are with gossip or whatever it is here is what Paul said in First Corinthians he said that there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man you're not special whatever you're struggling with a lot of people have struggling struggle with it too don't think that you're special you are special to Christ but you're not special to the devil amen you know you're not he hates us the one person that cares about us is the man Christ Jesus but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it every one of these homeless people every one of these drug addicts every one of these people that that can't control their temper every one of these people that are driving and I do you know I I'm going to ram him hahaha you are able to overcome that that guilt that you have from the past you are able to overcome it all of those things you are able according to God's word it's not me saying this it is the prophet of God speaking this and James he says submit yourselves to God he says flee resist the devil and he will flee from you keep trying God's not going to give you something you can't overcome let's go back to John chapter 8. verse 35. and the servant of the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed and there is the key to that whole group of scriptures the heroin user he needs Christ the person with the temper needs Christ the social media addict needs Christ a fearful person needs Christ Trust in Jesus every portion of Our Lives needs to have Christ applied especially those weak spots I was listening to tape yesterday and brother Branham was talking about boxing and he said when you have a weak spot he said always cover that spot and it's the same with us when we have that weak spot always cover that with the blood always come always be ready to bring that to Christ and I was thinking you know about this audience these people in this audience they had in their minds that Jesus was talking to these Jews as the Bible says they had in their minds how things should be they had in their mind how we should conduct Church they had in their mind how long the tassels of the of the the brothers garments those those Jewish tassels how long those should be down how those those things should be wrapped around their wrists and on their foreheads and how long the lady's skirts should be and they're long their hair should be they had in their mind how everything should be and it came contrary to what they thought when Jesus came because these people and here's the number one these people were a Slave to their own way of thinking these Pharisees and Sadducees and how they had it all figured out they were slaves to their own thought process they were slaves to the things that they had learned that made sense but when the real thing came they missed it they condemned it and that's what I see so often in US today you know we become a slave to the things that we've we've learned the way that we grow up we become a slave to that understanding and then when God might want to do something whoa that's not like I remember well that's not what I'm used to that's different and different has got to be wrong and then you start reading you start looking in the message you start looking in the Bible and you start trying to find things to condemn it because you are a slave I am a slave we are slaves to the to a thought process to a to a a religious system and if we would just let Christ in then we may understand a little bit better you know I see you're not allowed to play golf you know because of brother Branham said this you know some some preach against television all the time some only play tape sermons of brother Brianna some that you have to play the whole tape and some just a partial tape and then the preaching is the main thing and then some that if the spirit doesn't move and doesn't promote doesn't produce an emotional response in every service then that service wasn't successful and then some teach that you can't have strings and stringed instruments in church some teach that you can't have drums you know some teach that that you don't have to play a tape but you have to read quotes of brother Branham on every service and then every one of us we all have these these things that every church service is supposed to be and then if it doesn't match that I don't want it I don't want it because it doesn't match the way I think you know and you know I think about brother Brown tells this story about this Crow that that this farmer caught you know he's eating his eating his grain and stuff so this farmer caught this Crow and he tied a string to his foot and then over here he put a stake in the ground and tied the other end of the of the string to that and this Crow he was he would walk around he had to walk around in a circle and he would just pick and eat everything that he could within this strings length and all the other crows you know they're flying around and coming back and flying around and he he tried to fly a couple times and he couldn't and he stuck to this string and he got so weak because he'd eaten all the food around and this little boy walks up to this Crow and he unties him after days or however long it was and he unties it and that Crow still thought he was tied he was in bondage to his thoughts he could have flown away but he still kept walking around in this circle not going outside of it because that is the way he learned and going to and fro and everything and knowing that he just couldn't go past that even though he could if he would have just flapped his wings or made a couple hops he would have been outside of that but that's so often with us you know we we're we're Bound by this and we're going around and we get free we get liberated we accept the Lord Jesus we get filled with the Holy Spirit but then we get stuck because of our way of thinking and that task master is still there and we are not willing to let something else into our lives and by doing that we stick our hand out say God I don't want it Jesus I don't want what you have I I'm I made this Choice I'm here and if it doesn't come the way that I think it should come then it can't be right the Azusa Street Revival way back 1906. it was a very odd thing that happened people they were they were meeting at this house and there was something that was going on that was absolutely not right according to tradition one of those things where blacks and whites we're worshiping together you have to think way back then over 100 years ago that was not right there's something wrong there that doesn't that doesn't jive with with what I've been what I've learned it can't be right yet the spirit was coming down and was operating and we see these people and you can read back in the text and they're saying this this is wrong this is unclean how can this be right this integration them doing this they don't look like us they don't talk like us they don't act like us they don't worship like us how can it be right but then there were some some that were willing to cross that boundary and they were willing to say you know what if God's in it I want to be there there was a great man we've all heard his name before named FF Bosworth brother Bosworth he saw he had heard about this and he went and he said I want to see what's going on he went he went down there and he said this is the real thing brother Bosworth started was one of the founding fathers of the Assembly of God denomination he was a big deal he was a great man separated himself from him when they said they said that you have to agree that the initial evidence the first evidence of the holy spirit that you receive is speaking in tongues but Bosworth said that is not right I'm out you know when you try to put a yoke on the people like that I'm out of that and with the Azusa Street Revival you see something that's fairly common and it started with young people they were they were fairly young these ones that that started going and started worshiping and it started by a black man named William Seymour which that cut certain people out and then you see that that this is mainly Youth and how can they understand what's going on how can they know we are the educated we're the polished we have experience and you know you'll find throughout history that most of the revivals that have started at least a significant portion of them started among the youth why is that even Jesus and his disciples you know he's only 30 years old and his disciples were probably around that age or younger many of them this young man in all of these these young men and women given their hearts to the Lord why why are the youth so receptive it's because they probably haven't been indoctrinated all these years they haven't had all this stuff pounded into them for all of this time to where now it's like well this has to be right and anything else I'm not going to accept the youth generally don't have that they're more open to a Revival and that's what happened at Azusa Street and it was others it was it wasn't just all youth but they were ready even though if it went against what they had been raised thinking was right and now I see and I've read on the news that there is a Revival breaking out in Kentucky among the youth is it for us I don't know what's happening there in this place in Kentucky what is going on and I started a few days ago I started reading about it and I started watching some of the YouTube videos and it's it's something happened in this Asbury University in Kentucky this young man they have Chapel in the morning this young man I think I wrote his name down um Nick Dawson was his name towards the end of Chapel he gets up and he gives a testimony to the chap to the to the young people in there just normal Chapel and he said something on the order of he said uh it was it was something on the order of how much that he loves Jesus and how he he would confess his faults and how good Jesus is and the importance of spreading Jesus Christ to other people then another young person got up and that person gave a testimony then another one got up and that person gave a testimony and soon they were praising the Lord and they were they were shouting and they were they were praying and they were singing and they they missed class and they just stayed in the auditorium kept praying kept singing other people started to hear about this so they started coming in other students around they started praying they started singing they started worshiping it went on and then day two they continued they didn't go home that night they stayed in the auditorium they kept on kept on worshiping day two then then they started doing like they do you know and this you know videoing uploading it to social media this is awesome other young people started coming from the school they started coming then day three comes along they still hadn't gone home you know the the people in the school are like well they had enough wisdom to say let's let this go more people started coming after a few days the media starts covering it social media they're getting out the best way that they know how these young people they're getting this message out other other kids start coming then they start coming from other places outside of this Asbury School then churches in the area start bringing buses in packing this Auditorium it is full and they're praising and they're saying they still haven't gone home one after the other they're coming and the News starts to get out more and more they had to shut her down for a little bit to do a little maintenance they they set up they set up coffee shops you know on the outside and they set up little places where they can get food 24 hours a day praying singing worshiping a Revival was sparking up in this place so I'm watching this and I'm keeping track of it you know I'm reading about it's like wow this is something but you know what they don't look like us laughs I don't care you know what maybe their hair isn't long enough maybe maybe they have a pair of shorts on if they're boys I don't care when's the last time we saw an all-night prayer meeting among Our Youth and I'm going to criticize that I'm not I'm not condoning it of course not you know that I mean that's I'm not saying that that we should we should look like that I don't care but something is going on there and then who are we we might say you know what it can't be right because they don't look like me it can't be right maybe because they're not using the same King James translation as I am it maybe it can't be right because they're not using the same Scriptures it can't be right because they don't dress like this but the fact is God is doing something there so as I'm watching this I got down on my knees yesterday and I said Lord Jesus bless those people may your spirit go out from that place may this revival start crying out Lord God may it be may this be true bless these people bless these young people may it spread and Lord If It Be Your Will make something spread to this Tabernacle and give us the Revival that we all want pour out your spirit Lord so I'm watching I'm I'm keeping track of this and a buddy that I have and Jeffersonville somebody that I witnessed to years ago a few years ago and uh he was holiness went to Brother Bobby you know Bernice Hicks you know that is went to Sister hicks's Church very holy in this church she came from Brother Brown's message and so you know we've we've kept in contact before um for for a long time he's a just a he's a man of God is what he is and he texts me and he says hey have you seen what's going on down in Kentucky I said yeah he says I'm going down he he and two of his friends they go down there standing in the freezing cold for hours waiting in line just to get into that Auditorium this is yesterday waiting in line to get into this Auditorium Lord I just want to feel it I want to see what's going on and and brother Bobby's the same way it's like they don't look like us but he didn't care so he gave me he sent me a report I'm gonna play this is this is Bobby talking whoops me myself so thank God for that really the reason why I seen you to love of God demonstrate that straight and love love him for others because it was so genuine so we're thinking and real how can I I can't even put it the words right now glory be to God and what I'm saying is that it wasn't I Spirit man it was it was hungry for the Lord it was people that did not come and we know we have fleshes we know how to get him saying it was so many people brother Daniel went in so much Unity income right now unity love thank you holy spirit that did not have hidden agendas did not [Music] did not come to try to be known they just came just came and then the young people man these young adults these college kids this generation they're just talking about I was just floored a melody is played for our Lord Jesus Christ I was just I was just at a much she when I say humility I'm saying how much they've demonstrated they just they just wanted the Lord they just wanted the Lord and how I knew how I knew that they just wanted the Lord because they were speaking truth in love and they was just for each other they were just for each other for others there it is praise be to God I'm still having trouble putting it in words my friend I'm so thankful to the Lord that he allowed me just to experience this so thankful and all I can do is I'm going to take it in I want to take it in for my own personal growth but then also I want to take it in where then I can just allow the Holy Spirit to give me the boldness to just try to come continuously give as much as I can to others just just truly being a light to others in spite of see some people's energy and there's some some of the self-righteous some of the legalism some of the um you know just across the board man um the church has just failed I I feel like we have just but I'm not I'm not gonna live down here because we we serve a awesome God a sovereign God that that's it is in the healing business I really feel like that he's trying to wake us all up really feel like he's trying to wake the church up and say look get back you going out there and tell them about my son Jesus with the balance balance of Grace truth truth and Grace I don't know man I it's just it was just a blessing to me I'm telling you Thank You Lord thank you Jesus I'm so glad I'm able to just share this with you to you're the first person I've actually been able to to just share this with says I've been down there yesterday so anyway man I love you thank God for you I know that you're trying to walk this walk I know that you know God bless him because he went you know he wanted to see what was going on and I understand they don't look like us they don't act like us they don't talk like us but they believe in the same Jesus and something is happening among those people and am I going to say oh am I going to critique it like maybe I used to do and say well that can't be of God because of this this this and this you can always find a reason not to believe you can always do it and like I said friends I'm not saying that this is this revival that's going on in Kentucky I'm not saying that it has to be for us I'm not I'm not using anything I'm not trying to say anything other than don't condemn other than this is God moving he's doing something special and if we as a church the Tucson Tabernacle if we as a church if God starts to spark up a Revival which I think he's going to I really do but if God Sparks up a Revival things start to happen how are we going to react if it's not something that matches our way I think if there's any place brother Bobby any place I've ever been it's this place that could Put the gun down and he said he says Billy he says I'm tired of it he says he says I'm done he says lead me to this Jesus that you're talking about brother Branham said right there on that snow bank he led that man to the Lord Jesus my point in saying this guess where he ended up that you don't know this little bit of trivia it's on tape he became a deacon in a Baptist Church and brother Brown was proud of it that that man was serving the lord and doing even though joining that church not one of his churches that church he was proud to say that brother Bram said this in the sermon influence he said that we see today as Believers in the light in the hour that we're living in it's becoming it's becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness it's becoming to a Pentecostal church that we fulfill all righteousness seeing that we have been called by the Holy Spirit it's Unbecoming that we separate ourselves from other brethren it's Unbecoming that we denominate ourselves and won't have nothing else to do with our brother who has received the Holy Ghost the same as we did it's not becoming to us when we see God moving and Performing and doing exactly what he said and because the person is not connected with our organization who is he talking to right now that's me speaking who is brother Brandon talking to our organization he's speaking to his own people he's speaking to the flock that God gave him to Shepherd who else would be listening to this tape brother Bram says this and because the person is not connected with our organization that we misbehave behave ourselves and that's unseemly that's not right we should be Christians we should be gentlemen we should be God-fearing people and Men the next quote brother Graham says this and the unfailing realities of the Living God but today we are trying to give people something that they really need and they don't want to accept it they just don't want it and the attitude of the people hasn't changed and yet that is exactly what the world needs today is the religion of Jesus Christ deliverance from the things that they are fearing and dreading and have need to be delivered of in the days when he was on Earth one of the reasons why that they could not receive Jesus of Nazareth and believe him and get their Deliverance because it was too unusual for them think about that Revival think about how many ministers how many how many what how many ministers around the country would condemn it because it doesn't fit their way of thinking because it was too unusual for them it was he brought his Deliverance God had sent them deliverance and he was so unusual to them that they didn't want to accept it because it didn't come just the way that they were used to receiving religion that's the one that means so much to us that's him speaking I see why the musicians could come and I'll close I can see why brother Branham hated the denominational spirit so much he absolutely hated it you know it's where I I listen to what he says and it's almost like God placed him on Earth to rip that thing down everything that he said he hated that denominational Spirit why because it divided people and it made people think that they were the elect that they were the bride that they were the chosen of God just because they had a name associated to them and let me tell you it does not matter I don't care if your name is Catholic Methodist or message Jesus Christ is the only one and we take that out and then we go and I feel like we do the same thing that he stood against and we cut out people a move of God against friends I'm not saying I'm not trying to promote this this Asbury Revival I'm just saying when a Revival hits when God moves it probably won't be exactly like we think it should be because it never has been and why would it be this time we got it all figured out man we got to figure out what brother Brandon's going to come back and he's going to have a tent and and then this is going to happen there's gonna be a small room and there's gonna be limbs restored and there's all this and and we got it all figured out and and then it's like okay and I'm I'm looking at my notes nope nope nope that can't be because it doesn't line up with the way I get it figured out we don't know God is sovereign he will do things the way that he's gonna do things and we just need to get in line with his program amen let's stand Jesus said I read this before John chapter 8 verse 36 he said if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed Galatians 5 1 as I read at the beginning said Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage you've come out of it don't get tangled up with it again amen friends we are Christians God has done so much for us and we should thank him all the time but don't let the same task master that ruled those Jews in John chapter 8 don't let it rule us go with the spirit follow the spirit if it doesn't match the way that I think get down I want to get down I want to pray say Lord is this you because I don't want it to be me and I don't want to put my hand in God's face and say I don't want you and I certainly don't want to be a Slave to the God of this evil world amen let's bow our heads friends just I like to take a little time as we hear the piano play and just think just think on the things that may rule your life or my life remember that there's nothing in our lives there's no temptation that we can't overcome think about him think about how we would like to have a Revival in this city we would like to have a Revival in this church if you would like to have a Revival friends raise your hands if it's something that you desire to have just raise your hand and say Lord I would like to have a Revival in my life a Revival in my church Revival of my city Lord pour your spirit upon us foreign Lord Jesus bless those young people I pray in Kentucky and all those that have come to to be a part of the of their Revival Lord I pray that you bless each one Lord may they go back when they go may they may they go back just filled with your spirit and filled with zeal to lift up Jesus Christ before a Dying World before their Church before their friends before their school before their cities wherever they are Lord may they return excited about you about your spirit and Lord our little church right here we pray Lord that you would re Revive Our spirits Lord that you would be with us that we father would be receptive to whatever you would have to say to us Granite Lord and Lord we just thank you we thank you Father that that you have given us so much and I believe it was written in your word that too much has been given much is responsible Lord we have a great responsibility and we pray that we could handle that Lord we pray that that we wouldn't take that responsibility lightly strengthen us Lord and send your spirit to us we pray just visit us dear Jesus just visit us in Jesus name we pray amen Matthew if you would lead us in song God bless you all I'll be ministering tonight on some of the things that we're feeling going to be a little lighter

professional football player that he died on the field and the whole stadium started praying for him and many people prayed for him this is this is friends this is not our type of people and the man was healed and he's been thanking everyone for their prayers ever since am I right brother Bobby you know that God is good he loves us he loves his people he's stirring everything points to where this is the end we've reached the end of the book we've arrived we've arrived at where everyone has looked for we're here it's the hardest time to live that has ever been on the face of this Earth and there is more slavery now than there ever has been the devil has his slaves but let me tell you something I am not one of them and neither are you stand strong friends go and and I pray that you have a good day come back for service tonight I'll be continuing on on this subject and talking about a little bit more of the more specific things that imprison God's people God bless you all brother Matthew is seeing if you sing another song for us before we leave Hallelujah [Music] just worship Him friends [Music] only [Music] Young [Music] ah oh yeah [Music] [Laughter] [Music] brothers and sisters I feel that the presence of the Lord is with us I believe he's here with us right now if you would have something on your hearts the Lord is here to answer that it is written in God's word to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover it's written in his word that the disciples laid their hands on the people and they received the Holy Ghost so friends lay your hands on one another now Lay Your Hands On on your friend on your neighbor place your hands on your son on your brothers and your daughter on your son lay our hands on each other in the name of our Lord Jesus [Music] Lord God
