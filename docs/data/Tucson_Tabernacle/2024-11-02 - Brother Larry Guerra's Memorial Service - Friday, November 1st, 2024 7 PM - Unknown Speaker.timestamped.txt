[20:28] we'll have brother Daniel open in prayer
[20:32] if he would do that
[20:44] now let's bow our
[20:48] heads our great Heavenly
[20:51] Father Lord it is written in your word
[20:54] that the day of a man's death is greater
[20:56] than the day of his birth
[20:59] father it's hard sometimes for us to
[21:02] really understand that Lord we pray that
[21:07] that the meaning of your word and and
[21:10] the greatness of what you have for us
[21:12] over on the other side father would
[21:14] anchor deep in our hearts and that you
[21:16] would help us to understand the
[21:19] glory that our brother is beholding now
[21:22] and Lord we long to be there father
[21:25] bless each one here I pray that
[21:29] father as always if there would be one
[21:30] in this congregation that would need a
[21:33] touch from you or has father a need for
[21:36] a conversation with you father that that
[21:39] it would be granted and you would take
[21:40] care of that
[21:41] person father we love you we ask these
[21:44] things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[21:48] you can be
[21:51] seated first to all the visitors I want
[21:55] to say welcome on behalf of all the
[21:57] members here at the Tucson Tabernacle
[22:00] we're honored that you would join us
[22:02] here in a memorial of um what who we man
[22:07] that we love very dearly a man that has
[22:10] done uh mighty things while he was here
[22:13] on Earth and uh he has left a wonderful
[22:17] Legacy with us all I um I want to say a
[22:22] few
[22:23] words just uh just in welcoming
[22:26] welcoming the people and in uh talking
[22:29] about our brother that um and then and
[22:32] then we'll get into the service brother
[22:35] Larry I didn't know him very well I had
[22:39] obviously I've met him and and I've
[22:40] talked with him talked with him really
[22:43] only well here was at church here and he
[22:46] used to sit there in the
[22:48] back and I always made it a point to go
[22:51] and shake his hand before service and
[22:54] and um just get a little uh get a little
[22:57] bit of that love that that was on
[22:59] brother Larry and and maybe a little bit
[23:01] would rub off some of that anointing
[23:03] would rub off on me he
[23:07] um I don't as I said I didn't know
[23:11] brother Larry very well in person but I
[23:14] feel like I know brother Lara and I feel
[23:17] like I know it know him through these
[23:20] people here his
[23:22] family we
[23:25] um he was a man that
[23:28] I always know that he really believed
[23:31] what he
[23:33] preached and he he laid a foundation for
[23:37] his family that is carrying on today and
[23:42] I I'd like to read a scripture that I
[23:46] believe really says something special
[23:49] about our brother and it's Proverbs
[23:50] Chapter
[23:52] 13 Verse
[23:53] 22 I know we think about this a lot of
[23:56] times in in monetary speaking but there
[23:59] is a monetary application to this
[24:01] scripture and then there is a spiritual
[24:03] application to the scripture as is most
[24:05] of the things in this Bible it says here
[24:08] that Proverbs 13:22 it says a good man
[24:12] leaveth an inheritance to his children's
[24:17] children and I believe that the the one
[24:21] that wrote the Proverbs here believe it
[24:23] was Solomon that wrote that that he was
[24:26] saying that yes that that we should
[24:28] leave our our grandchildren some sort of
[24:31] a of an inheritance as far as money but
[24:34] more important we should leave them a an
[24:37] inheritance that will stay with them
[24:40] that's worth far more than any money
[24:42] that you could ever give someone and
[24:44] that's what I see in this Gara family as
[24:47] I said I didn't have the opportunity as
[24:49] many of you have to really get to know
[24:53] this man Larry Gara but I know him
[24:57] through his Legacy and through the
[25:00] inheritance that he has given to his
[25:02] children and not only his children in
[25:05] brother Aron and the and the family here
[25:08] but also as the proverb said into his
[25:12] children's children his
[25:15] grandchild and there is if anybody knows
[25:17] the Gara
[25:19] family what a kind-hearted
[25:22] family what a sweet family a family that
[25:26] you don't hear many things negative
[25:30] about you hear a lot of a lot of love
[25:34] for the G family and those things don't
[25:37] just they don't just come they don't
[25:39] just show up they come and they're
[25:41] passed down from generation to
[25:45] generation and that love for the Lord
[25:48] and one thing i' I've seen about the G
[25:50] family and I believe this comes from
[25:52] brother Larry Gara is they are always
[25:54] willing to give a testimony to how good
[25:57] God is
[25:58] I love that about the G family we'll
[26:00] pass the microphone around the
[26:02] congregation sometime and the g family
[26:05] is never fails to be represented to tell
[26:09] how good God is to see those Generations
[26:14] coming down this Foundation that brother
[26:16] Larry has laid it won't die because it's
[26:20] in the grandchildren it's in the great
[26:23] grandchildren and how they represent
[26:26] this Holy Spirit
[26:28] that was represented through Grandpa
[26:30] through dad through brother
[26:33] Larry and I have the utmost respect for
[26:39] the Gara family and how much of a
[26:42] blessing brother Aaron and the family
[26:45] has been to me as a new pastor and how
[26:48] he showed his loyalty and his right hand
[26:50] of fellowship and he's held me up when I
[26:53] needed somebody to hold me up and I
[26:56] believe it comes because this man right
[26:59] here has character and he was taught
[27:02] character by his
[27:05] dad this scripture that we leave an
[27:09] inheritance to our children's children
[27:12] it reminds me of Acts chapter 2 when
[27:15] that Holy Spirit fell and Peter said
[27:18] repent every one of you and be baptized
[27:20] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[27:22] remission of your sin and you shall
[27:25] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[27:27] here's the inheritance that you get for
[27:31] This Promise is to
[27:33] you and to your
[27:35] children and to them that are far off
[27:38] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[27:40] call and you all have this inheritance
[27:43] from Great Grandpa from Grandpa from Dad
[27:46] from husband from
[27:49] brother and brothers and sisters don't
[27:51] take it for granted and as you go
[27:53] through the next few days think about
[27:56] what Grandpa left you
[27:59] think about the testimonies think about
[28:01] the stories think about the strength
[28:04] that he left your
[28:05] family and your family because you have
[28:08] that strength from
[28:11] Grandpa all of us have also benefited
[28:13] from it so the the generations that go
[28:17] that have come down they are a blessing
[28:20] to other people because of the parents
[28:25] the grandparents the great-grandparents
[28:28] brothers and sisters we here at the
[28:30] Tucson Tabernacle are
[28:32] testimonies we can all give testimony of
[28:36] the man that the Lord took from
[28:39] us but he did not take that inheritance
[28:42] that brother Larry
[28:44] left so as I said I don't didn't know
[28:49] brother Larry very well but I feel like
[28:51] I know him very well because of the
[28:54] Legacy that he left and how this family
[28:59] is very very special to so many people
[29:03] God bless you and again welcome to the
[29:05] Tucson Tabernacle and um as I said on
[29:09] behalf of everyone here we greet you in
[29:11] the name of the Lord Jesus and hope that
[29:14] you feel comfortable here and uh look
[29:17] forward to what our brother Aaron has to
[29:20] say and and what brother Figaroa has to
[29:23] say God bless you all
[29:33] if Ava would make her way
[29:35] up this is one of the great
[29:39] granddaughters of dad and she's been
[29:41] taking piano lessons and she said I'd
[29:44] like to pray for play something for
[29:45] Great Grandpa
[29:56] [Music]
[32:02] [Applause]
[32:11] we
[32:13] um we had a tradition that the kids all
[32:16] the grandchildren in the front of the
[32:19] entry of the house there's a lion head
[32:22] mounted to the columns there and all of
[32:25] them would take little leaves from the
[32:27] the plants around and they would feed
[32:30] the lion and every one of these
[32:32] grandchildren had pictures of them
[32:34] feeding that Lion and the other day I
[32:36] think it was Ava not Ava but um Khloe
[32:41] and Asher one more time feeding the
[32:42] little lion
[32:44] so I I want to
[32:47] read chapter of the chapter of Psalms
[32:50] 121 and I'm going to read it in
[32:52] English but it was one of my dad's
[32:56] favorite verses
[32:59] and little have it up there I will lift
[33:01] up mine eyes unto the hills from when
[33:04] cometh my help my Help Cometh From The
[33:07] Lord which made Heaven and Earth he will
[33:10] not suffer thy foot to be moved and he
[33:13] that keepeth thee will not
[33:16] Slumber behold he that keepeth Israel
[33:19] shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord
[33:22] Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon
[33:25] thy right hand the sun shall not smite
[33:28] thee by day nor the Moon by
[33:30] Night the Lord shall preserve thee from
[33:33] all evil he shall preserve thy Soul the
[33:36] Lord shall preserve thy going out and
[33:38] thy coming in from this time forth and
[33:41] even forever
[33:43] more what a what a promise we have what
[33:46] a scripture we have it's also a
[33:48] song that they sang in Spanish and my
[33:51] dad would sing sing these songs as as
[33:54] children growing
[33:55] up it was mostly songs in Spanish that

[34:50] okay this evening We Gather to celebrate
[34:52] a legacy of the love and faithfulness of
[34:55] Lorenzo lro Gera and his his life
[34:58] spaning 88 vibrant
[35:01] years Leno was born on August 10th 1936
[35:05] in Los Angeles California into a family
[35:07] of eight
[35:08] children like many young children the
[35:10] innocence and wonder of childhood was
[35:12] interrupted by hard work and although
[35:15] not the oldest he took charge of his
[35:16] siblings and cared for them as they
[35:18] worked the fields picking cotton peaches
[35:20] and grapes while raised in the apostolic
[35:23] church he gave his heart to the Lord and
[35:25] at 16 years old he was baptized in a
[35:28] little church in Needles Arizona on
[35:30] April 11th
[35:32] 1953 by the age of 18 the young man with
[35:35] jet black hair sharp eyes and a
[35:38] prankster's grin was working
[35:40] construction and concrete supervising
[35:43] several men and projects and still
[35:45] traveling picking fruit at the Harvest
[35:47] time during the grap season in Selma
[35:50] California
[35:51] 1954 romance blossomed with his beloved
[35:54] meline after lenel gathered the courage
[35:56] to ask her hun on a date one evening
[35:58] after a Charming encounter by the
[36:00] mailbox outside her home they married
[36:03] just 6 months later a beautiful
[36:05] partnership lasting 69
[36:08] years lento was energetic always
[36:11] tinkering around the house building
[36:14] something here fixing something there he
[36:17] worked hard so he could spend the summer
[36:19] months taking his family on State Side
[36:21] vacations to the mountains and the
[36:23] beaches as a devoted Christian lencho
[36:26] and his wife raised the family of four
[36:28] to seek the Lord and live Faithfully in
[36:31] 1975 he was introduced to the message
[36:34] preached by the prophet William brandham
[36:36] by two of mine's Brothers shortly after
[36:39] lenel moved his family to Tucson where
[36:41] they would stay permanently eventually
[36:43] making Tucson Tabernacle his home church
[36:46] under brother Perry green where his
[36:48] missionary work would begin in the late
[36:51] 1970s lencha was declared disabled after
[36:54] a series of injuries took over his life
[36:56] of construction in concrete he embarked
[36:59] on his missionary journey traveling
[37:01] through Brazil Costa Rica Honduras
[37:04] Mexico and vuela spreading the Gospel of
[37:07] Jesus Christ often taking meline with
[37:10] him when he wasn't on the road he was a
[37:13] Spanish interpreter for the Tabernacle
[37:16] the work carried on until the early
[37:18] 2000s when his health slowed him
[37:21] lenell's Ministry adapted through prayer
[37:23] and counsel for God's people even to giv
[37:26] candy to the children's to the church's
[37:28] children after service from his post in
[37:31] the corner chair in the back of the
[37:33] church lenro had an unwavering Zeal for
[37:36] sharing the good news with anyone
[37:38] willing to listen and even to those who
[37:41] were
[37:42] unwilling painting a portrait of a man
[37:45] whose devotion defined him pouring over
[37:48] the scriptures was an integral part of
[37:50] his daily life he maintained endless
[37:53] handwritten notes of prayer accounts of
[37:55] Miracles and healing verses and words
[37:58] from the prophet the devotions alongside
[38:01] his wife alone took them through the
[38:03] entire Bible at least seven
[38:05] times on the night of October 13th
[38:09] 2024 lencho lay peacefully in a hospital
[38:12] bed in the house he lived in for most of
[38:15] his life his wife meline and
[38:17] granddaughters Naomi and Sarah sang
[38:19] hymns to him many of his
[38:23] favorites a quiet moment overtook the
[38:25] house only the sounds of the old kitchen
[38:28] clock ticking
[38:30] away and lent's intermittent exhales
[38:33] filled the
[38:40] room at 11:07 p.m. he took his final
[38:44] breath on this Earth and stepped into
[38:48] eternity still quiet in the house a
[38:51] nightly train passing by blew its
[38:54] horn a signal time time to
[38:58] go Let Us carry on lal's Legacy by
[39:02] emulating the virtues he
[39:04] personified I conclude with the verse
[39:07] fitting his life and thou shalt love the
[39:10] Lord God the Lord thy God with all thine
[39:13] heart and with all thy
[39:17] soul and with all thy
[39:24] might and now just read a few personal
[39:27] notes I have with my
[39:29] grandpa when Grandpa realized his Olive
[39:32] Tree was causing my allergies he chopped
[39:34] it
[39:36] down in the Summers he rounded up the
[39:39] grandchildren and drove us to the
[39:40] mountains to Camp it's where he taught
[39:43] us to
[39:44] fish and he'd load us up in the car and
[39:47] take us to McDonald's to buy
[39:48] cheeseburgers but no soda because we had
[39:50] ginger ale at home and no fries because
[39:54] we had chips at home
[39:57] when the trees yielded fruit he stuffed
[39:59] grocery bags pool and sent them home
[40:02] with us over the years I enjoyed
[40:05] watching great grandpa cooked chiso for
[40:07] Bianca and Ava whenever we visited it's
[40:10] something the girls grew to love but
[40:12] were too young to see these days would
[40:14] come to an end and become
[40:16] memories at first he could stand on his
[40:18] own later he would need a cane the days
[40:22] when he would get up only when necessary
[40:24] came far too
[40:25] quickly he was so much more to me than
[40:28] the things he did for us if I ever knew
[40:32] a Man Who Loved the Lord it was my
[40:34] grandpa his whole identity was in Christ
[40:39] and the cost was high yet he never
[40:43] wandered from the
[40:45] way and though he could be a hard
[40:48] man I saw the Lord moved when he
[40:54] prayed two days before his eternal glory
[40:58] I saw his arm outstretched while lying
[41:00] in his hospital bed I got up thinking he
[41:03] needed something and I asked if he was
[41:05] okay he didn't move so I stayed silent
[41:09] just waiting when he opened his eyes I
[41:12] asked were you pray
[41:14] Grandpa he looked at me and nodded
[41:17] yes in the final hours I watched him
[41:20] hoping he would open his eyes and say
[41:22] something
[41:24] profound but I realized now that he he
[41:27] had been telling me a profound truth all
[41:30] of my
[41:31] life just
[41:34] believe we'll take care of
[41:37] grandma and we'll make sure the lion is
[41:41] fed I love you
[41:51] Grandy there's a McDonald's on palie
[41:54] down towards Benson Highway and it was
[41:57] called Grandpa's
[41:59] McDonald CU he took the kids there and
[42:02] one of the managers loved it when my dad
[42:05] would go because my dad would take some
[42:06] tamales with him and the manager would
[42:08] sit down and eat with him so
[42:22] [Music]
[42:32] soon we'll come to the end of life's
[42:40] journey and perhaps we'll never meet
[42:48] anymore till we
[42:51] get in
[42:53] heaven right City
[42:58] far away on that
[43:02] beautiful
[43:06] Shore if we never meet again this side
[43:12] of
[43:14] Heaven as we struggle through this world
[43:20] and it
[43:23] TR there's another meeting place
[43:28] somewhere in
[43:31] Heaven by the side of the
[43:36] River of
[43:40] Life where the Charming roses
[43:44] blo
[43:48] forever and where
[43:51] separations come no more
[43:58] if we never meet again this side of
[44:05] Heaven I will meet you on that
[44:10] beautiful
[44:13] Shore oh they say we shall meet by the
[44:22] river where no storm clowns ever dark in
[44:27] the
[44:30] sky and they say we'll be
[44:35] happy
[44:38] forever in the

[45:50] beautiful
[45:53] sure I will meet you
[45:59] I will meet you on that
[46:04] beautiful
[46:06] [Music]
[46:12] [Applause]
[46:19] show thank you for bringing joining my
[46:21] family to honor and celebrate the life
[46:23] of my
[46:25] grandfather for anybody that doesn't
[46:27] know I'm one of the granddaughters one
[46:28] of Aaron's daughters um in honor of his
[46:31] memory I'd like to share a few memories
[46:33] with you about his prayers um I grew up
[46:37] in my grandfather's home and Grandpa was
[46:39] like a father to me grandpa's life was
[46:43] marked by faith the Supernatural and by
[46:46] prayer after spending many years with
[46:49] him I can assure you he believed and
[46:52] lived what he preached he had strong
[46:56] faith to believe that God would hear his
[46:59] prayers so I'd like to give some of
[47:02] those
[47:02] memories so sometimes one can experience
[47:06] something in life that makes you wonder
[47:08] why you had that experience yet as time
[47:12] and years go by the reason becomes very
[47:15] clear when I was a child I would often
[47:18] go visit Grandma and Grandpa between
[47:19] services on Sundays one such day I was
[47:22] playing outside in their backyard when I
[47:25] came across a dead bird it was a dove
[47:28] that had become Tangled Up In some
[47:30] string and had strangled I ran to show
[47:32] my grandfather we then used some
[47:34] scissors to cut the Bird Free and I
[47:36] watched as he gently untangled the bird
[47:38] its wings broken and
[47:41] lifeless is it dead I remember asking my
[47:45] grandfather he said yes M it's
[47:47] dead and I remember looking up in his
[47:50] face and he seemed really sad he didn't
[47:53] say anything and then as as if it was
[47:57] the most natural thing in the
[47:59] world he spoke and he said little birdie
[48:03] in the name of Jesus Christ I give you
[48:06] back your life and I watched that dead
[48:10] bird come alive and fly from his hand to
[48:15] perch on power lines
[48:18] above as a six-year-old child I saw a
[48:22] clear demonstration of the power the
[48:25] truth and and the life of God I
[48:29] understood that the God my grandfather
[48:31] served truly was the resurrection and
[48:35] the life it is with this faith and
[48:38] confidence that I live today as many of
[48:41] you know I was diagnosed with an
[48:44] incurable disease and was told I would
[48:46] not survive when we had gotten the news
[48:49] my grandpa was very
[48:51] troubled and he went home he sat in his
[48:54] chair in the middle of the night praying
[48:57] he asked God to speak concerning me some
[49:01] confirmation some
[49:03] encouragement he took his Bible letting
[49:05] it fall open and he simply pointed with
[49:09] his finger and says wherever it lands on
[49:11] that's for
[49:13] Sarah so the scripture was Matthew 21
[49:18] verse 21 and 22 where Jesus instructs
[49:21] that wherever we ask in his name
[49:24] believing in faith we can have have the
[49:27] thing that we ask
[49:28] for even for mountains to
[49:32] move so Grandpa came to the hospital he
[49:35] shared this with me he told me the most
[49:38] important thing was to believe in God
[49:41] with faith so he spoke words of life and
[49:45] healing over me and then he said I'm
[49:47] going to pray that God gives you that
[49:50] Faith so that you can live to believe
[49:54] for a
[49:55] miracle I'm here today
[49:57] I'm living I'm standing I'm moving and
[50:00] breathing freely because of those
[50:04] prayers the final memory I'd like to
[50:06] share is a little bit
[50:07] humorous I always knew Grandpa to be
[50:10] very humble and
[50:11] reverent a lot of reverence towards God
[50:14] and the things of God he was never
[50:16] sacriligious he never mocking and never
[50:20] irreverent in fact if we said anything
[50:23] remotely sacriligious or ever irreverent
[50:25] around him we got severely reprimanded
[50:28] you just did not do
[50:30] that um so he was very sincere very
[50:34] respectful and when he prayed he would
[50:37] use what I called holy speech he had a
[50:40] lot of these and THS and so on he was
[50:43] very reverent and he never was
[50:47] presuming so I was very surprised when I
[50:50] heard this
[50:52] prayer I had been suffering from
[50:54] terrible migraines we had prayed over
[50:56] this many times and one day I was in his
[50:59] home he was actually having to take care
[51:01] of me for a little
[51:02] while and I was in tears because of the
[51:06] pain of these migraines and I said
[51:08] Grandpa would you please please pray and
[51:11] he looked at me he sighed very deeply
[51:15] and he said yes M we will pray then in
[51:18] the most aggrieved
[51:20] tone he
[51:23] said Heavenly Father
[51:26] you know we have asked you many times to
[51:32] heal my granddaughter of these
[51:35] migraines would you please heal my
[51:40] granddaughter and then he never said in
[51:43] the name of Jesus Christ we pray he
[51:44] never said amen no he said thank you
[51:49] Father for hearing us I'm glad we had
[51:52] this little talk
[51:57] I sat there a little shocked but you
[51:58] know the migraine left and I've never
[52:01] suffered with one
[52:03] since God answered that prayer and I
[52:06] believe that from one father to another
[52:09] God saw my grandfather's upset at seeing
[52:11] me in pain he hated to see us in pain
[52:14] and struggling but God had compassion on
[52:17] me and heard that prayer I am grateful
[52:20] and privileged to have been taught on my
[52:22] grandfather's knee about the Living God
[52:26] and faith faith and prayer the knowledge
[52:29] of Truth is what keeps me today I like
[52:32] so many of our loved ones we're going to
[52:35] miss our
[52:36] grandfather on this side of Heaven yet I
[52:39] know some morning I'll see him again
[52:41] beside that Great River of Life and I'll
[52:44] hear his voice once more saying God
[52:47] works in mysterious ways his wonders to
[52:51] perform
[52:58] [Applause]
[53:02] as Sarah was spent a lot of her her time
[53:06] with Grandpa and
[53:08] Grandma she's always it's always been
[53:11] dear and it's something that
[53:15] um brother Robert would make his way
[53:18] up it it's amazing to see when Sarah was
[53:22] in the hospital
[53:24] and um
[53:28] and they've been diagnosed
[53:30] with the disease and so forth and we
[53:33] just gotten that report and it's it's a
[53:37] shock one of the doctors told
[53:40] her if you don't do what we tell
[53:43] you within two weeks you'll be
[53:46] dead we had a prayer meeting in the
[53:50] hospital and it was a wonderful prayer
[53:52] meeting and she went home we're sitting
[53:55] in a restaurant Resturant and she goes
[53:58] Dad Dad and she goes what there's that
[54:01] doctor that said in two weeks I would be
[54:03] dead and he's looking at me like what
[54:05] are you doing
[54:07] alive we serve a living God if if he'll
[54:10] stand with me brother Robert Figaro was
[54:14] a good friend of my father's they
[54:17] traveled um he traveled with on any of
[54:20] the trips with my dad and uh I've asked
[54:24] him if he would share some of those t
[54:26] testimonies with you today and there are
[54:30] many many of them but some that maybe
[54:32] would that he would remember out
[54:34] standing and also just to encourage us
[54:37] because God's word is encouraging amen
[54:40] and so if if for brother Robert if you
[54:42] would
[54:43] come thank
[54:47] you God bless
[54:49] you God bless you
[54:54] tonight you may be seated
[54:58] you know the Bible says in Psalms
[55:03] 116 precious in the sight of the Lord is
[55:07] the death of his
[55:09] Saints and when you know a man like
[55:11] brother Larry
[55:13] that that was the true man of God every
[55:15] time I met him I would tell him in
[55:19] Spanish there a there's a little
[55:24] cliche and I would Shake shake his hand
[55:27] man of God and shake his hand he just
[55:30] smiled at me I look at that chair back
[55:33] there and I expect to see brother Larry
[55:34] is sitting back there right now but we
[55:37] did a lot of traveling together yes we
[55:38] did and uh and uh we uh one one trip we
[55:44] spent 28 days in
[55:46] Mexico and another trip we we went to
[55:49] Brazil and we were 19 days preaching
[55:52] many places places we don't even I
[55:55] couldn't remember the name of the towns
[55:57] we were in but we spent many hours in
[56:00] his car in that little old Toyota truck
[56:01] he used to have he kept that thing
[56:04] running like a little clock I'll tell
[56:06] you and he was he had his ways brother
[56:08] Larry did and uh he was a Godly
[56:12] Man uh you know uh when I first came
[56:16] here well uh in ' 89 we were actually
[56:19] with brother green back in 1965 when he
[56:23] first came to the little synagogue over
[56:25] there we were there from the from the
[56:27] very beginning with brother green and uh
[56:30] but we left when U it was a brother that
[56:33] was preaching in Spanish and brother
[56:35] green thought it'd be a good idea for
[56:36] the Hispanic people to start a Spanish
[56:38] speaking church so with his Blessing we
[56:41] all left and it didn't work out we wound
[56:43] up with a brother had come in from
[56:45] California and we stayed with him for 15
[56:47] years and after 15 years we decided to
[56:50] come back to S Tabernacle so about
[56:52] 89 we came back and it was around
[56:55] probably about 91 92 93 I I don't
[56:58] remember the year exactly but they were
[57:00] starting to interpret back there on the
[57:02] balcony and brother Larry asked me one
[57:05] day he says uh I was not preaching back
[57:07] then I was in my 40s and he said um
[57:11] could you uh help us out with the
[57:13] interpretation I'll try it see see if I
[57:16] can and I did he must have liked it
[57:19] because uh the next service next Sunday
[57:21] I was down here he came down here and he
[57:22] tapped me on the shoulder he says can
[57:24] you come up here and help us sure so
[57:27] from the services that would later I'd
[57:30] be sitting here and he'd come tap me on
[57:31] the shoulder again after about two or
[57:33] three times you tap you said brother why
[57:35] don't you just come up here and stay up
[57:36] here with us so for about I think from
[57:39] about 93 to about 2010 when I left to go
[57:42] Pastor a church about 17 years we worked
[57:45] up there interpreting and and he was
[57:49] always he uh people people would call I
[57:52] know but people would depend and call
[57:54] and had confidence in this prayers he
[57:57] was a he was a praying man he was a he
[58:00] was a he was a prayer
[58:02] Warrior and I think his name was just
[58:04] right G which means in English War he
[58:08] was a warrior for
[58:11] Christ we did some uh traveling and uh
[58:15] one one trip we did 28 days we went to a
[58:18] city called
[58:19] saltio Gua Mexico and it's a it's a hub
[58:24] of a lot of colleges and a lot of
[58:26] universities and a lot of well educated
[58:28] people in that area and they were just
[58:30] Building a Church there about 100 120
[58:33] people with a pastor brother Isel Moran
[58:36] was a pastor there and they had already
[58:39] built the the the uh the basement so
[58:42] they were having services in the
[58:44] basement they hadn't finished the church
[58:45] above so we brother Larry and I ended up
[58:48] preaching in the basement to them after
[58:51] that brother Larry you just looked at me
[58:53] you know that these people are so well
[58:54] educated you know he and I with no
[58:56] education especially in Spanish our
[58:59] Spanish is just you know more or less we
[59:02] get by and uh he says these people were
[59:05] the the pre the pastor was an engineer
[59:07] and his wife uh the deacons were doctors
[59:11] lawyers uh professors of music and and
[59:15] brother Larry said you know if I would
[59:16] have known that I would have been really
[59:18] intimidated to preached before them and
[59:20] I said not only you me also brother but
[59:23] we had a lot of good times together um
[59:26] brother Brandon says on the message down
[59:29] on Calvary he says this you don't have
[59:31] to be
[59:32] lost there is a Highway and a way and is
[59:36] called the way of
[59:37] Holiness the unclean don't pass over it
[59:41] for he comes through the fountain first
[59:44] and then he enters the highway he broke
[59:47] the powers of Satan he open the prison
[59:50] doors of Hell to every man that was shut
[59:53] up in this earth and in the prison
[59:56] fearing that when he died what death
[59:58] would be to him on Calvary he opened
[1:00:02] those cell doors and let every captive
[1:00:05] Go free you don't have to no longer be
[1:00:07] torn down by sin you don't have to no
[1:00:10] longer yield your members to sin and
[1:00:13] drinking and smoking and gambling and
[1:00:15] telling lies you can be honest just and
[1:00:19] upright and Satan can do nothing about
[1:00:22] it I like that you know our the life
[1:00:25] that God has given given us in this this
[1:00:27] gospel Satan can't do and he he tries
[1:00:31] and he'll keep on trying but we are more
[1:00:34] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:00:35] us he
[1:00:37] says he says you can be honest just and
[1:00:40] upright and sat Satan can't do nothing
[1:00:42] about it because you got a hold of a
[1:00:44] line a Lifeline that's anchored in the
[1:00:48] Rock of Ages nothing can shake you from
[1:00:51] it no winds can shake you from it no
[1:00:55] nothing not even death itself can
[1:00:58] separate us from the love of God that's
[1:01:01] in Christ Jesus that's what Calvary
[1:01:04] meant men that were in bondage were set
[1:01:08] free men that were once under fear of
[1:01:10] death can no long no have no have no
[1:01:13] fear of death a man who Longs for a city
[1:01:17] whose Builder and maker is God he can
[1:01:20] step on that Highway and set his face
[1:01:23] towards heaven I I believe brother Larry
[1:01:25] as a young man when he gave his heart to
[1:01:27] God he set his face towards heaven and
[1:01:31] he never changed from that direction
[1:01:34] brother Brandon
[1:01:35] says he don't need to wander no more for
[1:01:39] there is a way of knowing whether you're
[1:01:41] right or not God gives us life our sins
[1:01:44] are gone that dead Calvary paid the
[1:01:47] price when we see all that no wonder the
[1:01:50] poet wrote mid rendering rocks and
[1:01:53] darkening Skies my savior bowed his head
[1:01:57] and died the opening Veil revealed the
[1:02:01] way to Heaven's Joys an endless
[1:02:05] day Jesus you know when had The Story of
[1:02:08] Lazarus when when he was a good friend
[1:02:11] of Jesus and uh he'd gone on he'd gone
[1:02:14] to go preach and Lazarus got sick and
[1:02:16] they sent word to him to come pray for
[1:02:19] him and jesus carried he didn't come
[1:02:22] right
[1:02:23] away and in John 11
[1:02:29] 11-4 says these things said he after
[1:02:34] that and after that he saith unto them
[1:02:37] our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go
[1:02:40] that I may awake him out of sleep then
[1:02:44] said his disciples Lord if he sleep he
[1:02:47] shall do well how be it Jesus spake of
[1:02:50] his death but they thought that he had
[1:02:52] spoken of taking a rest and sleep then
[1:02:56] Jesus uh unto said unto them Jesus said
[1:02:58] unto them plainly Lazarus is dead I
[1:03:03] believe that in the language of Jesus he
[1:03:06] didn't say he he died or he's dead he
[1:03:08] didn't want to say that but to make them
[1:03:11] understand he had to speak in their
[1:03:12] language I don't believe the language of
[1:03:14] of God and of Jesus was he de he's dead
[1:03:18] or he died because I don't believe his
[1:03:21] he does he doesn't he doesn't his
[1:03:23] children do not die I want want you to
[1:03:26] realize that that his children do not
[1:03:28] die There Is No Death how can we die
[1:03:31] when we're full of life whether we're 90
[1:03:34] years old or it doesn't matter there's a
[1:03:36] life living inside of us that's Eternal
[1:03:39] and brother Brandon said that's that's
[1:03:40] God's own life that's Zoe and that was
[1:03:43] what's living in my brother Larry he
[1:03:45] cannot die he's not he's not dead He's
[1:03:48] Alive it's just a change of geographical
[1:03:51] position is all it is he's in a he's in
[1:03:53] another dimension he's probably looking
[1:03:56] over the banister right now I'm sure he
[1:03:58] is and watching all this right
[1:04:00] now in 2 Corinthians
[1:04:03] 51 Paul writes for we know that if our
[1:04:07] Earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[1:04:10] dissolved we have a building of God an
[1:04:13] house not made with hands Eternal in the
[1:04:17] heavens what is that building it's a
[1:04:19] body that's awaiting us brother Brandon
[1:04:21] says in the message called life he says
[1:04:24] then that theophany talking about Jesus
[1:04:27] was made flesh in the person of Christ
[1:04:29] Jesus and then all the fullness of the
[1:04:32] trinity dwelt in him both father son
[1:04:35] holy spirit all all in that and that's
[1:04:38] the very way we go Plumb back to the
[1:04:40] original beginning of God there we are
[1:04:43] born again not of Flesh born again not
[1:04:45] of blood but Born Again by the spirit
[1:04:48] and then that eternal spirit of love and
[1:04:50] honesty comes down to make its place in
[1:04:53] us and then when we die
[1:04:56] from this life we go into a body which
[1:05:00] if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved
[1:05:03] we have a theophany to go into a body
[1:05:08] Celestial I remember many years ago
[1:05:10] brother Larry showed me a picture of a
[1:05:13] sister that was in a hospital bed she
[1:05:16] was in her 40s and she had a family she
[1:05:20] had a husband and children but she was
[1:05:22] dying of cancer and they had taken a
[1:05:25] picture of her her she's laying on that
[1:05:26] bed but when they developed a picture
[1:05:30] there appeared a young woman standing
[1:05:32] right next to her bed and brother Larry
[1:05:35] showed me that picture and the husband
[1:05:36] when he seen that he said that's my wife
[1:05:39] when I married her you see that the
[1:05:42] offering was already waiting right there
[1:05:44] for that Spirit of life and that soul to
[1:05:47] step right into it he said I've gone to
[1:05:50] prepare a place he says that where where
[1:05:53] I go you may be also that's his promise
[1:05:56] to us and Paul writes in 1 Corinthians
[1:06:01] 15:51 to
[1:06:03] 58 he says you know it was a mystery
[1:06:06] death and to many is still a a mystery I
[1:06:10] mean it's to us really it's all an
[1:06:11] experience we've never experienced but
[1:06:14] it's no longer a
[1:06:16] mystery because Paul opened it up he
[1:06:19] unveiled that mystery he said behold I
[1:06:23] show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:06:27] sleep notice that's the language of
[1:06:29] Jesus cuz we're not we don't die we
[1:06:32] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:06:36] changed when he says all he's speaking
[1:06:39] to the ones that have gone on he's
[1:06:42] talking about brother Larry he's talking
[1:06:44] about my little Ruthie he's talking
[1:06:46] about my mom my dad the ones that you
[1:06:49] know those loved ones that have gone on
[1:06:51] he says but we shall all be changed you
[1:06:53] see they're going to have a change and
[1:06:55] we're going to have a change if we're
[1:06:58] here when when when the Rapture takes
[1:07:00] place there's going to be a translation
[1:07:02] take place he says in a moment in the
[1:07:05] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[1:07:07] for the trumpet of God shall sound and
[1:07:10] the dead shall be raised Incorruptible
[1:07:13] and we shall all those that have gone on
[1:07:16] and those that are waiting we shall all
[1:07:19] be changed amen the Bible says you know
[1:07:23] that Jesus when he came back he came
[1:07:26] back in a glorified body he walked
[1:07:28] through walls he he traveled as a
[1:07:31] thought and brother BR said we'll do the
[1:07:33] same thing we're going to be stepping
[1:07:35] into a glorified body he said we'll be
[1:07:37] here about 20 days or so he said we're
[1:07:40] going to get to meet each other here and
[1:07:42] then we're going to say where is our
[1:07:43] Lord and then we'll meet him up in the
[1:07:45] skies now he says it says in the Bible
[1:07:49] that John writes when we when we shall
[1:07:51] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:07:53] him for we will see him as he is we're
[1:07:57] going to take on a glorified body just
[1:08:00] like him it says therefore this
[1:08:03] corruptible he says this corruptible
[1:08:05] must put on
[1:08:06] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[1:08:11] immortality so when this corruptible
[1:08:13] shall have put on incorruption and this
[1:08:16] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[1:08:19] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:08:21] that is written death amen Hal
[1:08:25] Hallelujah death is swallowed up in
[1:08:28] Victory think of it death is swallowed
[1:08:32] up in Victory he says oh death where is
[1:08:35] thy sting we as Believers could be able
[1:08:38] to stare death in the face and laugh and
[1:08:41] be unafraid because we know that God has
[1:08:45] opened the way for us brother B says
[1:08:47] it's just a door that brings us into the
[1:08:49] presence of
[1:08:51] God he says oh death where is I sting
[1:08:57] brother brand said that that like a bee
[1:08:59] when it goes around and it stings you it
[1:09:02] loses a stinger and brother Brandon says
[1:09:04] he W he put his stinger in Christ on
[1:09:06] that on that cross and he lost his
[1:09:09] stinger and Paul says here where's your
[1:09:12] sting grave oh oh oh grave where's your
[1:09:15] Victory oh death where's your Sting the
[1:09:18] sting of death is sin and the strength
[1:09:20] of sin is the law but thanks be to God
[1:09:24] who gives us of Victory through our Lord
[1:09:26] Jesus Christ therefore my beloved
[1:09:29] Brethren be ye
[1:09:30] steadfast we should look as our brother
[1:09:32] Larry as an example for the rest of us
[1:09:35] he was
[1:09:36] steadfast
[1:09:37] unmovable those of those of you that
[1:09:39] knew him can say that he was steadfast
[1:09:43] he was unmovable always abounding in the
[1:09:46] work of the Lord that was brother Larry
[1:09:49] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:09:53] is not in vain in the Lord Brother
[1:09:57] Brandon says in the in the message
[1:09:59] Easter Sunrise in 56 is th fear no evil
[1:10:04] for thou art with me how I love that oh
[1:10:07] death where is your sting grave where is
[1:10:11] your Victory I'm going from Victory on
[1:10:15] to Victory is death a victory
[1:10:19] absolutely death is a victory amen death
[1:10:24] is a victory now
[1:10:25] not a sadness it it's a
[1:10:29] victory praise be to God I had many
[1:10:33] experiences with brother brother Larry
[1:10:36] there was a sister from somewhere in
[1:10:38] Europe one time that she wanted to give
[1:10:41] some money to build a
[1:10:42] church and the money was brought here to
[1:10:45] Tucson and given to brother Larry and
[1:10:48] and he found a little little town called
[1:10:51] bakam and uh there was a need there for
[1:10:54] a church a a pastor an Indian brother
[1:10:57] very very very humble and he and he
[1:10:59] built a church there for them a
[1:11:02] beautiful church I know brother Aron has
[1:11:04] been there and even even with a Baptist
[1:11:07] tree behind the pull pit and uh very
[1:11:10] very well made church and they had their
[1:11:13] first Services there
[1:11:15] and the people went around knocking on
[1:11:18] doors and inviting people and there was
[1:11:21] a a certain family a little girl she
[1:11:24] must have been about 12 she was a young
[1:11:26] little girl about 12 years old maybe 11
[1:11:28] she came by herself she came to church
[1:11:32] and that night the Lord touched her and
[1:11:34] she came out to be prayed for because
[1:11:36] she she was an
[1:11:38] epileptic and here in our our sister
[1:11:41] what she said about brother Larry when
[1:11:43] he said about that bird brother Larry
[1:11:45] had related that story to me about the
[1:11:46] bird and he had this thing that he would
[1:11:49] say sometimes as he prayed for people he
[1:11:52] would pray but sometimes he would pray
[1:11:53] in jesus' name and he'd say but I and I
[1:11:55] give you your life and he told the
[1:11:57] little girl I give you your life and she
[1:12:01] was healed of that epilepsy she went
[1:12:04] home full of joy and the next service of
[1:12:08] her her whole family was in church and a
[1:12:12] whole family got changed because of that
[1:12:15] just the things in the labor that that
[1:12:17] brother Larry did to build a church and
[1:12:21] practically by himself maybe a little
[1:12:23] help from the Brethren but he that that
[1:12:25] was the kind of man he was and when he
[1:12:27] did things he did them well if he if he
[1:12:30] was going to build something for you he
[1:12:32] did he did an excellent job because
[1:12:34] that's the way he was a quality person a
[1:12:37] quality man a quality Christian and a
[1:12:40] quality worker as
[1:12:41] well uh we uh as I said we spent 19 days
[1:12:47] in in
[1:12:49] Brazil preaching we'd be driving all day
[1:12:51] and stopping in town and it' be Message
[1:12:53] Church there and and we'd be preaching
[1:12:56] that night and so it was nice having two
[1:12:58] preachers because one would could could
[1:13:00] take a night off and the other one would
[1:13:02] work and and we worked together that way
[1:13:04] all through Mexico many places that we
[1:13:07] went uh there's a
[1:13:10] brother my church brother Ralph Bowers
[1:13:13] he's my he's been my my uh my song
[1:13:16] leader for 14 years he's 80 years old
[1:13:19] and still still on fire for God and he
[1:13:22] told me Wednesday night he said brother
[1:13:24] I can't go you know I can't drive at
[1:13:26] night he lives in SRA Vista he says but
[1:13:29] you you tell them that 50 years ago when
[1:13:33] I lived in California brother Larry took
[1:13:35] the tapes to me and introduced me to the
[1:13:38] message and that's why I'm here today 50
[1:13:42] years he took the tapes all around and
[1:13:45] and many came to this word because of
[1:13:48] his efforts because he was convinced and
[1:13:51] then brother R says when you're
[1:13:53] convinced you're concerned
[1:13:56] amen uh there was other healings that
[1:13:59] took place that that we saw and it's all
[1:14:03] the power the the the faith that he had
[1:14:06] never wavering he was just he was an
[1:14:10] example and uh and I can say myself that
[1:14:14] uh going to starting to write go with
[1:14:17] him on these trips it wasn't long before
[1:14:19] I began to feel a pool to the ministry
[1:14:22] and uh and we began to preached the word
[1:14:25] and I was an evangelist for this church
[1:14:29] for 18 years with brother green working
[1:14:32] with brother Green in Tucson Tabernacle
[1:14:34] when I went and took the pastorship over
[1:14:37] in uh in Herford now we're in wuka city
[1:14:40] now we've been there 14 years but I
[1:14:43] believe that if I look looking back it
[1:14:45] all started with a tap on the
[1:14:47] shoulder a tap on the shoulder and here
[1:14:50] I am today I never thought that I would
[1:14:53] be where I am I sometimes I ask I said
[1:14:55] how did I get here I never desired it I
[1:14:59] never never gave it a second thought as
[1:15:03] some of you might be sitting there you
[1:15:04] you would never think you'd be standing
[1:15:05] behind a Pulpit preaching the word it'
[1:15:07] be the furthest thing from your mind
[1:15:09] that was me but it started with a tap on
[1:15:11] the shoulder and God began to lead me
[1:15:14] and guide me and and here I am today and
[1:15:17] I was and I I was influenced by brother
[1:15:19] Larry and brother green and I and I owe
[1:15:22] them that and I'm thankful to the Lord
[1:15:24] for the testimony that brother Larry uh
[1:15:28] had that that was an example to me as
[1:15:31] well as a younger man to be able to go
[1:15:34] with him and and for him to take me on
[1:15:36] these trips and and later on we visited
[1:15:39] Venezuela as well and and Brazil and we
[1:15:42] did a lot of traveling together and and
[1:15:44] I and I look back and I say thank you
[1:15:46] Lord for my brother I was sitting there
[1:15:48] when I came in and sat down and and it
[1:15:51] kind of just struck me at that moment I
[1:15:52] thought wow brother Lar is not here he's
[1:15:57] not here cuz he was always here when I
[1:15:59] was here he was always
[1:16:01] here I want to I want to finish with uh
[1:16:05] with this with scripture and I'd like
[1:16:07] for all of you if you stand with me
[1:16:11] tonight and if you could put Psalms 23
[1:16:14] the whole chapter it's just six verses
[1:16:17] and I like the whole all of you all to

[1:16:59] comfort me thou preparest a table before
[1:17:03] me in the presence of my enemies thou
[1:17:06] anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:17:09] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[1:17:14] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:17:18] and listen and I will dwell in the house
[1:17:21] of the Lord
[1:17:23] forever gave man one more little
[1:17:27] testimony uh this one that relate
[1:17:29] brother Larry related to me they were
[1:17:31] many years ago they were traveling on a
[1:17:32] train he and two other brothers and the
[1:17:35] train there in Mexico and it broke down
[1:17:37] in the middle of nowhere and so there
[1:17:39] they were broken down train and nowhere
[1:17:41] to go people starting getting out of the
[1:17:44] train because it was too hot to be
[1:17:45] inside and and around around the time of
[1:17:48] the the the sound started to go down
[1:17:50] they thought well we're wasting our time
[1:17:51] they might as well start preaching here
[1:17:53] so they found a little found there
[1:17:55] somewhere and and they started to preach
[1:17:57] to the crowd and pretty soon they all
[1:17:58] started to gather around they had
[1:18:00] nothing else to do so they began to
[1:18:02] preach to them and after they got done
[1:18:04] they made an altar call and the young
[1:18:06] man stepped forward and gave his heart
[1:18:08] to God he was a doctor a young man then
[1:18:12] and he gave his heart to the Lord and
[1:18:14] for many many years he believed this
[1:18:16] message he went to be with the Lord I
[1:18:18] believe was last year or it's been a few
[1:18:20] months ago it's been more not more than
[1:18:22] a year I think that he passed away
[1:18:24] himself
[1:18:25] but that by being by the side of a of a
[1:18:28] track right there nothing else to do but
[1:18:31] let preach let give them the word and
[1:18:33] they found a soul they found a seed
[1:18:36] there might have been others I don't
[1:18:37] know but you know this is what the labor
[1:18:39] of love is when you love the Lord you
[1:18:42] want to do something for him amen and
[1:18:45] now as as I turned it over to brother
[1:18:48] Larry I want to thank you all for for
[1:18:50] coming and my condolences for my for my

[1:19:27] dad it didn't take long if you sat down
[1:19:30] with him or around him that he would
[1:19:33] want to share a testimony something that
[1:19:36] would be
[1:19:37] encouraging and

[1:23:55] all my sins to
[1:24:00] atone when the darkness I
[1:24:05] see he'll be
[1:24:07] waiting for
[1:24:09] me I won't have to Cross
[1:24:14] Jordan
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:18] Alone what a what a promise we have an
[1:24:22] unfailing promise
[1:24:25] as I listened to brother Robert and some
[1:24:28] of the
[1:24:30] the things that they went through and I
[1:24:32] said dad would come home and share them
[1:24:35] often with
[1:24:37] us he loved my wife's cooking too so it
[1:24:40] wasn't hard to get them to come over and
[1:24:44] I've always said I married my wife
[1:24:46] because she was a great cook I've never
[1:24:49] denied that that was true
[1:24:52] but she's not here this evening
[1:24:54] because
[1:24:56] um she got sick today and we had to take
[1:24:58] her to the hospital um she couldn't
[1:25:02] breathe she was choking and going
[1:25:04] through a hard time
[1:25:06] and I think just over all that we've
[1:25:10] gone through for the last month it just
[1:25:11] kind of built up on her and ran a series
[1:25:14] of tests and everything was good so
[1:25:16] she's home now but
[1:25:19] um seeing my dad and mom together um and
[1:25:24] dad would leave for for quite a few hour
[1:25:28] days if it was just here in the state of
[1:25:31] sonota it may be a shorter trip but when
[1:25:33] they would go down way into Mexico if he
[1:25:35] drove or all the way into South America
[1:25:38] sometimes they were close to a
[1:25:40] month and my my mom would stay take care
[1:25:44] of the house and when D dad came home
[1:25:48] mom was still there
[1:25:50] and like I said just shy of 70 years
[1:25:53] married
[1:25:55] dad was 18 mom was
[1:25:57] 19 when they got married
[1:26:01] and we lived in Southern
[1:26:04] California dad was
[1:26:08] um he knew his work well he did he did a
[1:26:12] good work but they were raised raised to
[1:26:14] speak
[1:26:16] Spanish and um so he would leave us um a
[1:26:23] message that he was going to go do
[1:26:25] something and he would leave it in his
[1:26:28] English which you had to discern his
[1:26:31] writing because he spelled it like it
[1:26:34] sounded to him he was going to go see a
[1:26:37] uh to buy a Dodge
[1:26:40] truck so he left the note by the phone
[1:26:43] that said I went to go see a dog
[1:26:47] track so so we would laugh about
[1:26:51] it but you know
[1:26:54] when Dad began to to work here at the
[1:26:57] Tabernacle and began to
[1:26:59] translate he did his best to learn the
[1:27:03] proper way to translate the message for
[1:27:07] the
[1:27:09] minister and if he didn't know the word
[1:27:12] that the minister would use or brother
[1:27:13] green would use he would go find it out
[1:27:15] and give the proper
[1:27:17] translation we were in Mexico together
[1:27:20] where they built the church in
[1:27:22] bakam and some of the young people
[1:27:25] they're not young people anymore at that
[1:27:26] time they donated a portion of the funds
[1:27:30] and at the entry of the church they did
[1:27:33] a a h tin roof and all those young
[1:27:36] people signed their name underneath
[1:27:38] there that church it was in farming
[1:27:41] Community um there was electricity and
[1:27:44] water in the area but not in the
[1:27:46] people's houses because the government
[1:27:48] hadn't didn't permit that at the time
[1:27:52] but Dad made for the church to have
[1:27:54] running water which meant flesh toilets
[1:27:57] and electric power and the whole thing
[1:27:59] so people would come to see the church
[1:28:01] there that had electricity and water in
[1:28:04] it and because of that they would get a
[1:28:08] good
[1:28:09] congregation that church that that he
[1:28:11] spent quite a bit of time and some of
[1:28:13] the brothers went down with him we went
[1:28:16] down for the
[1:28:19] dedication and the Sunday morning
[1:28:21] Minister was ministering and I was
[1:28:23] interpreting in into
[1:28:25] English and for the first
[1:28:28] time I heard my I saw my dad get stumped
[1:28:31] on translating the
[1:28:33] word the brother who used the word in
[1:28:35] Spanish that neither my father or my dad
[1:28:38] had heard before and it was a steamer
[1:28:41] trunk when the old ships would come
[1:28:43] across the big steamer
[1:28:45] trunk and the word he used was B and we
[1:28:48] had never heard it and I'm looking at my
[1:28:51] dad and my dad's looking at me and we
[1:28:53] are trying to figure out what he's
[1:28:55] saying so the brother kind of just
[1:28:57] danced around it and we gave them an
[1:29:00] idea but he went home and found out what
[1:29:03] the right word was and that's just how
[1:29:05] he
[1:29:06] was and uh we we we his English was not
[1:29:10] the best we still laughed we would laugh
[1:29:14] at him it's not mean but you know it's
[1:29:17] kids he thought it was
[1:29:20] funny um he could not say mountain peaks
[1:29:25] they were mountain
[1:29:27] pigs and we had one of the biggest
[1:29:29] laughs in the
[1:29:31] house Dad hadn't come home from work Mom
[1:29:33] would make
[1:29:34] dinner and if Dad hadn't gone some
[1:29:37] because he he work we worked in Southern
[1:29:38] California sometimes he'd be out in Los
[1:29:40] Angeles by the time he got home it'd be
[1:29:42] 7 8:00 at
[1:29:43] night and Mom started
[1:29:46] laughing and
[1:29:48] uh
[1:29:50] um Mom really was not that tight mom was
[1:29:54] if it was dinner time you sat you prayed
[1:29:56] you ate but mom had was started laugh
[1:29:58] and we didn't know why she was
[1:30:01] laughing and and she just kept laughing
[1:30:03] so we laughed cuz Mom's laughing but we
[1:30:05] had no idea why she was
[1:30:07] laughing and finally she was laughing so
[1:30:10] hard she literally fell on the ground
[1:30:11] and she was laughing so now we're
[1:30:13] laughing cuz mom is on the ground
[1:30:15] laughing so finally when she calmed down
[1:30:17] I said mom why are you
[1:30:19] laughing and she said you know how your
[1:30:21] dad says mountain pigs and we lived
[1:30:24] right under the samber darn Mount she
[1:30:26] goes I just heard all those
[1:30:28] pigs oinking like a
[1:30:32] pig it was it was fun at home it was
[1:30:35] good times at home but one thing about
[1:30:37] my father he loved the lord gave his
[1:30:42] heart to the Lord at 18 years old or was
[1:30:46] baptized the family had been originally
[1:30:49] Catholic and I'll I'll tell it as best
[1:30:51] as I remember
[1:30:54] one of somebody in the family had
[1:30:56] cancer and one of the relative of the
[1:30:59] family had be had heard the Pentecostal
[1:31:01] message back then and
[1:31:03] invited had had told him and he told and
[1:31:07] I don't remember for sure which one of
[1:31:08] the relatives it was grandma or great
[1:31:11] grandma it was Grandma okay I'll take
[1:31:15] you to a church where they pray for
[1:31:17] people and God heals
[1:31:19] them and he said and he'll heal you of
[1:31:21] that
[1:31:22] cancer so they took GR Grandma there and
[1:31:24] God healed her of
[1:31:26] cancer and with that she gave her heart
[1:31:29] to the Lord and they began to to serve
[1:31:31] the Lord in a in a Pentecostal church so
[1:31:34] that was the start of going from
[1:31:37] Catholicism to to a Pentecostal Church
[1:31:42] there and dad when he was about 15 years
[1:31:45] old grandma told him son you've got a
[1:31:48] you need to serve the Lord he didn't
[1:31:49] drink he didn't party but he did like to
[1:31:52] go to the dances
[1:31:54] and he gay said I w't do it I I won't go
[1:31:57] anymore I'll do this and he gave that
[1:32:00] promise to the Lord but he didn't get
[1:32:02] baptized and he went to a
[1:32:05] dance and on his way to a dance he felt
[1:32:08] a hand reach over and touch him on the
[1:32:10] shoulder and stop
[1:32:12] him and he said to him for a year I was
[1:32:15] sick sick sick until I made my made my
[1:32:19] heart right with God and he took that
[1:32:22] sickness away and he was baptized in the
[1:32:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and from
[1:32:26] then on he served the
[1:32:29] Lord so in our home we had a Christian
[1:32:32] father and a Christian mother just share
[1:32:35] a few things one of my best friends
[1:32:37] lived up the street and they had a TV in
[1:32:40] the house it wasn't black and white but
[1:32:43] it was a
[1:32:44] TV and we wanted to go see
[1:32:48] cartoons and he wanted to be at our
[1:32:51] house and I convinced him him one day to
[1:32:55] let us go to to go to his house and
[1:32:57] we're sitting there watching
[1:32:58] cartoons and suddenly a commotion
[1:33:01] happened in the kitchen and his little
[1:33:03] brother comes running out and says let's
[1:33:05] get out of here Mom and Dad are
[1:33:07] fighting so we all ran we ran to my
[1:33:10] house and he goes this is why I would
[1:33:13] rather be at your house cuz this never
[1:33:17] happens at your house my mom and dad
[1:33:20] threaten each other with pans and knives
[1:33:21] and everything and until you see
[1:33:24] something like that you really don't
[1:33:25] know what God has done for you to live
[1:33:28] in a home that Christ you have Christian
[1:33:31] parents now there was times when it was
[1:33:34] rough I'm not saying that there wasn't
[1:33:35] there were times that you know Dad get
[1:33:37] upset with us
[1:33:39] and he loved to say how many spankings
[1:33:41] do you think you
[1:33:43] need I never volunteered more than
[1:33:47] one and he would say you need at least
[1:33:51] 10 and if I would have said 10 I would
[1:33:53] have got
[1:33:55] and then Mom would say that's enough
[1:33:56] either spank them or let them
[1:33:59] go but Dad had dad watched over us he
[1:34:03] prayed for us he talked to us and he
[1:34:06] told us what what to love God was to
[1:34:10] know him
[1:34:13] personally and um watching him as his
[1:34:16] last days as as as he was coming to the
[1:34:20] end of his days
[1:34:21] and the caretakers were kind of
[1:34:24] explaining to us these are it's probably
[1:34:26] in his last few
[1:34:28] hours the last time you've seen Dad here
[1:34:30] at the church you would have seen his
[1:34:32] head is was pretty well sideways the
[1:34:35] muscles and all from the injury that he
[1:34:37] had had many years
[1:34:38] earlier very
[1:34:41] stiff well we had gone home about 8:30
[1:34:44] take somebody home and we were going to
[1:34:46] come back Sunday
[1:34:49] morning but my brother Jerry and Mom
[1:34:51] were there and my daughter Sarah Sarah
[1:34:54] the
[1:34:56] caretaker and around 10:00 or so Sarah
[1:34:59] and my mom began to sing to my dad
[1:35:02] singing songs together to
[1:35:04] him and um just just being with
[1:35:08] him and then as he got quiet my brother
[1:35:12] Jerry noticed that my father's head had
[1:35:15] straightened out and he went over and he
[1:35:17] touching and all the stiffness was
[1:35:20] gone and he took a few breaths and went
[1:35:22] home amen
[1:35:24] you know and I know it to be true I'm
[1:35:26] going to share a testimony here as as
[1:35:28] we're finishing
[1:35:29] up we um those of you from many years
[1:35:33] who have known brother Daniel
[1:35:37] Ramirez and um his father brother Jose
[1:35:40] had been an interpreter for brother
[1:35:42] brandom in the
[1:35:43] 40s brother Daniel then took the message
[1:35:47] to the Nora family which uh his brother
[1:35:50] Isaac Nora and them which then passed it
[1:35:52] on to our family family so we we had a
[1:35:55] connection with him man but when brother
[1:35:57] Jose was was sick and laying in bed used
[1:36:00] to live in the little house right down
[1:36:02] the street from the church
[1:36:05] here and his wife and his daughter were
[1:36:08] there talking to him and telling him
[1:36:10] daddy dad you need to eat you don't have
[1:36:12] any strength you need to eat and he says
[1:36:15] I'm not hungry I was just
[1:36:18] fed and they're watching him and there
[1:36:21] had been nobody there to feed him they
[1:36:22] said who fed you daddy and he began to
[1:36:25] talk of names of people had crossed over
[1:36:28] already and he called them by name they
[1:36:31] were just here with me feeding
[1:36:34] me and that's when sister
[1:36:38] Ramirez she said he's closer to that
[1:36:41] side than he is to this side so they
[1:36:43] said Daddy go ahead go home and greet
[1:36:47] Danny for us he crossed his arms took
[1:36:50] his breath and crossed
[1:36:52] over for a Christian there's no
[1:36:56] fear Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:36:59] today and
[1:37:01] forever you know there was there was
[1:37:04] times dad I I love when Dad would come
[1:37:06] and just share the
[1:37:08] testimonies Sarah reminded me of one
[1:37:11] I'll tell you of a God that's more than
[1:37:14] able there was two young men that my dad
[1:37:18] and I don't know if it was these
[1:37:20] ministers or who they were ministered to
[1:37:24] and one of them was
[1:37:26] homosexual and my dad prayed for him
[1:37:29] always wondering what
[1:37:31] happened to this young man and one day
[1:37:35] in service he was telling that testimony
[1:37:37] at a church and the young man stood up
[1:37:40] and said that was me and I'm here today
[1:37:42] and I was
[1:37:44] changed God is more than able to meet
[1:37:47] and take care of whatever it is if
[1:37:50] you'll stand with me
[1:37:55] you know it is a
[1:37:58] battle but when the battle's over we
[1:38:02] shall wear a
[1:38:03] crown you know you and it doesn't
[1:38:07] take may I say it this way there was a
[1:38:10] thief on the
[1:38:12] cross who
[1:38:14] said Remember me when you come into your
[1:38:18] kingdom and Jesus turns around looks at
[1:38:20] him and says this day you'll be with me
[1:38:23] in
[1:38:25] Paradise I think he was the shortest one
[1:38:28] the one with the shortest amount of time
[1:38:30] in
[1:38:31] Paradise because when they came
[1:38:38] out
[1:38:40] oh I missed something on the notes Here

[1:45:05] them and the sister went and bought and
