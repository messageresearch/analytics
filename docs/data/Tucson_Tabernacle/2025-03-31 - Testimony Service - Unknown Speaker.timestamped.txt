[0:00] Victory in Jesus my
[0:04] savior
[0:06] forever. He saw me and he bought me with
[0:11] his redeeming blood and he loved me. I
[0:17] knew him and all his love is to him. He
[0:23] plunged me to
[0:26] victory beneath the cleansing flood. And
[0:31] I heard an old old story. How a savior
[0:36] came from
[0:38] glory. How he gave his life on Calvary
[0:43] to save a wretch like me.
[0:47] And I heard about his groanings of his
[0:51] precious blood
[0:54] atoning. Then I repented of my sins and
[0:59] won the
[1:01] victory and oh
[1:04] victory in Jesus my
[1:08] savior forever.
[1:11] He saw me and he brought me with his
[1:16] redeeming blood. And he loved me air. I
[1:21] knew him. And all my love is due him.
[1:26] And he plunged me to
[1:29] victory beneath the cleansing flood. And
[1:34] I heard about a mansion.
[1:38] He is built for me in
[1:41] glory. And I heard about the streets of
[1:45] gold beyond the crystal
[1:49] sea. And about the angels singing and
[1:54] the old
[1:55] redemption
[1:57] story. And some sweet day I'll sing up
[2:01] there the songs of victory.
[2:05] And oh
[2:07] victory in Jesus my
[2:11] savior
[2:12] forever. And he saw me and he bought me
[2:17] with his redeeming blood and he loved
[2:22] me. I knew him and all my love is due
[2:28] him. He plunged me to
[2:32] victory beneath the cleansing flood. And
[2:37] I heard about his healing of his
[2:41] cleansing power
[2:44] revealing. How he made lame to walk
[2:48] again and cause the blind to see.
[2:53] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and
[2:57] heal my broken
[2:59] spirit." And somehow Jesus came and
[3:04] brought to me the
[3:07] victory and oh
[3:09] victory in Jesus my savior forever.
[3:16] And he saw me and he bought me with his
[3:21] redeeming blood. And he loved me air. I
[3:26] knew him. And all my love is due him.
[3:31] And he plunged me to
[3:35] victory beneath the cleansing
[3:39] flood. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[3:43] this morning. And I'm going to start off
[3:44] tonight and telling a testimony about me
[3:47] and what happened to me Wednesday. So,
[3:49] as dad said on the uh on the WhatsApp
[3:52] group chat, he told everyone that I had
[3:54] a toothache and it started about Sunday
[3:56] night. It started to keep me up and it
[3:59] was really just bugging me. I started
[4:01] taking some medication I had for it and
[4:03] and that helped a little bit, but it was
[4:05] still just hurting. And if you've ever
[4:07] had a toothach before, you know they do
[4:09] not go away. and you think you're like,
[4:10] "Maybe it's going to go away tomorrow,
[4:12] but they do not go away." And so
[4:14] Wednesday, dad sent the text out and I
[4:16] started getting these texts and it was
[4:18] Lily, Sister Hope text me, a bunch of
[4:20] people text me and they're like, you
[4:21] know, we're praying for you and giving
[4:22] me ideas to help the pain. And I I took
[4:24] some pain pain pills that morning. And I
[4:28] didn't even realize it till about later
[4:30] later Thursday evening, but I didn't
[4:32] take another one after that. It the pain
[4:34] was all gone and I have not had pain to
[4:36] this day. So by your guys's prayer, I
[4:39] was healed.
[4:45] Amen. And
[4:49] amazing
[4:50] grace, how
[4:53] sweet the sound. And that
[4:57] saved a
[5:00] wretch like me.
[5:05] And I
[5:07] once was
[5:09] lost, but
[5:11] now I'm found. And was
[5:15] blind, but
[5:18] now I
[5:21] [Music]
[5:22] see. It was grace that
[5:27] taught my
[5:29] heart to fear.
[5:32] and
[5:33] grace my
[5:36] fears
[5:40] relief. And how
[5:43] preious
[5:44] did that
[5:47] grace
[5:48] appear in thee,
[5:51] how I
[5:53] first believe. Sister hope, you can make
[5:56] ready for your schedule. and through
[6:00] many
[6:02] dangers, tolls and snares. And I
[6:09] have
[6:11] already
[6:14] come into grace that brought me
[6:21] safe thus far.
[6:25] and grace will lead me home.
[6:33] And when
[6:34] we've been
[6:37] there
[6:39] 10,000 years and bright
[6:44] shineing as the
[6:50] sun and we've
[6:52] known less days and to
[6:57] sing God's praise and then when
[7:02] we
[7:03] first
[7:07] beun. And
[7:11] amazing
[7:12] grace, how sweet the sound and that
[7:19] saved a
[7:21] wretch like me.
[7:24] [Music]
[7:26] And I
[7:27] once was lost, but now I'm
[7:34] found. Was blind, but now I
[7:40] see. Amen. You may be seated.
[8:11] Um, I have a testimony I wanted to
[8:13] share.
[8:15] Um, Brother Daniel had um, Brother
[8:18] Josiah sing um, When I Come to Die.
[8:23] And when Stephen when he went to be with
[8:26] the Lord um before he had to go on the
[8:29] ventilator, his oxygen was getting
[8:32] really really low. And um he started he
[8:36] was talking to the Lord
[8:38] and his life started flashing before him
[8:42] and one thing after the
[8:44] other he was saying, "Oh God, I'm sorry
[8:48] for such and such. I'm sorry for this.
[8:50] I'm sorry for that. And he was obviously
[8:54] he was seeing something and
[8:57] um but when he was
[9:01] done so much peace, so much comfort in
[9:05] the
[9:06] Lord and he said, "Tell them they can do
[9:10] any whatever they need to do to try to
[9:11] save me." And he just lifted in the
[9:13] hands of the Lord like that.
[9:16] But when it comes time to die, you want
[9:20] that kind of testimony. You don't want
[9:23] nothing in between. And before that, you
[9:25] don't know when it's your time to go.
[9:27] You may not have that
[9:29] opportunity.
[9:31] So be sure that you're ready at all
[9:33] times. And don't wait to make something
[9:36] right.
[9:38] I mean it was little things that you
[9:41] wouldn't have thought that it would have
[9:42] mattered so much but still they did.
[9:47] So but it's so supernatural and it's so
[9:54] [Music]
[9:56] real. There's a
[9:59] land
[10:01] beyond the
[10:04] river that we call the
[10:08] sweet
[10:11] forever. And we only
[10:15] reach that shore by face degree.
[10:25] One by one will gain the
[10:30] portals there to dwell with
[10:34] the
[10:37] immortal when they ring those
[10:41] golden bells. Sing it with me for you
[10:45] and me.
[10:49] [Music]
[10:51] Can't you hear the bells now
[10:57] ringing? Can't you hear the
[11:01] angels
[11:04] singing tears and
[11:06] glory? Hallelujah.
[11:10] [Music]
[11:17] In that far of sweet
[11:23] forever just
[11:25] beyond that
[11:27] shining
[11:30] river. When they ring those
[11:34] golden bells for
[11:37] you and
[11:40] [Music]
[11:44] me. We shall
[11:46] know no sin or
[11:51] sorrow in that
[11:53] haven of
[11:56] [Music]
[11:57] tomorrow when our bark shall sail beyond
[12:03] the silver sea.
[12:08] [Music]
[12:11] We shall only know the
[12:16] blessing of our
[12:19] father's
[12:21] [Music]
[12:23] sweet when they ring those
[12:27] golden bells for you and me.
[12:36] Can't you hear the bells now
[12:42] ringing? Can't you hear the angels
[12:47] singing?
[12:50] is the
[12:51] glory.
[12:54] Hallelujah.
[12:57] [Music]
[13:00] Jubilee in that far of sweet
[13:07] forever just beyond that
[13:11] shining river.
[13:14] When they ring those
[13:17] good bells for you and me.
[13:23] [Music]
[13:37] [Applause]
[13:48] Sister Sarah, if you want to get ready
[13:50] for your song
[13:51] special, let's sing Goodness of
[13:54] God. I love you,
[13:59] Lord, for your mercy never fails
[14:04] me. And all my
[14:07] days, they've been held in your
[14:13] hands. From the moment that I wake
[14:17] up until I lay my
[14:21] head. Oh, I will
[14:24] sing of the
[14:26] goodness of
[14:32] God. For all my life, you have been
[14:36] faithful.
[14:41] And all my life you have been so so
[14:48] good. With every breath that I am
[14:52] [Music]
[14:54] able. Oh, I will
[14:57] sing of the
[14:59] goodness of
[15:01] God. And I love your
[15:06] voice. For you have led me through the
[15:11] fire in the darkest
[15:15] nights. You are close like no
[15:20] other. I've known you as a
[15:24] father. I've known you as my
[15:28] friend. And I have lived in the goodness
[15:34] of God.
[15:35] [Music]
[15:39] For all my life, you have been
[15:42] [Music]
[15:46] faithful. And all my life, you have been
[15:50] so so
[15:53] good. With every breath that I am
[15:59] aable, oh I will
[16:02] sing of the goodness of
[16:06] [Music]
[16:09] God. Your goodness is running after.
[16:13] It's running after
[16:16] me. Your goodness is running after. It's
[16:21] running after me.
[16:24] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[16:28] I give you
[16:32] everything. Your goodness is running
[16:35] after. It's running after
[16:40] me. Your goodness is running after. It's
[16:44] running after
[16:48] me. Your goodness is running after. It's
[16:52] running after me. With my life laid
[16:57] down, I surrender now. I give you
[17:03] everything. Your goodness is running
[17:06] after. It's running after
[17:10] [Music]
[17:13] me. For all my life, you have been
[17:17] faithful.
[17:18] [Music]
[17:22] And all my life you have been so so
[17:29] good. With every breath that I am
[17:35] able, oh I will
[17:38] sing of the
[17:40] goodness of God.
[17:59] I just wanted to um mention about this
[18:02] song. Hopefully I can get through it
[18:04] without crying, but it's pretty much the
[18:06] testimony of my life, but also my
[18:09] family's life. And I'm so grateful to
[18:10] hear my sister's testimony this morning,
[18:12] knowing what she's gone through, being
[18:14] there with her, but also knowing that
[18:16] there's many things that our family's
[18:17] gone through that have been very trying,
[18:18] very difficult, but through it all, God
[18:21] is
[18:22] faithful. And as you grow, and being the
[18:25] age that I am now, looking back over my
[18:28] life, the things I've gone through, um
[18:30] there isn't ever a time that
[18:33] God leaves me without hope. Even when I
[18:37] feel absolutely helpless,
[18:39] absolutely like you're going out of your
[18:41] mind and you don't know what to do and
[18:43] you don't see the end inside at all, but
[18:46] always there's a line of hope. There's a
[18:49] a line thrown out to you and that alone
[18:53] sometimes can get you through. And
[18:56] there's uh a lot of strength in just
[18:59] believing that there's a God who cares.
[19:02] And then he comes down and time and time
[19:05] again picks me up, helps me to keep
[19:07] going, keeps my family together, and I'm
[19:10] so grateful for that. So the song's been
[19:12] through enough.
[19:16] [Music]
[19:26] When I first began to walk with the
[19:31] Lord, I did not fully
[19:35] trust
[19:37] him. And how he longed for me to know
[19:44] that I could.
[19:50] So through the
[19:52] valley he gently led me afraid as I
[20:00] could be until I felt his
[20:03] loving arms of peace
[20:08] embracing me.
[20:10] [Music]
[20:13] I've been through enough to know he'll
[20:18] be enough for
[20:20] [Music]
[20:25] me. He's come through too many times and
[20:29] that puts my mind at ease for
[20:36] good. I'll stake my very life. He's
[20:41] going to take care of
[20:43] [Music]
[20:47] me because I've been through enough to
[20:51] know he'll be enough for me.
[20:56] [Music]
[20:59] How could I ever doubt a God whose hands
[21:05] hold the
[21:06] [Music]
[21:09] universe? And why would I ever question
[21:15] his
[21:16] [Music]
[21:20] abil? There's no place that I can go
[21:25] where he does know the things that
[21:30] trouble me. He's always aware of where I
[21:37] am and just what I need.
[21:41] [Music]
[21:45] I believe him now. After all these
[21:50] years, he's been so faithful. He's
[21:54] proven to be
[21:57] true. Never more will I doubt or
[22:02] question. Why? Because I've seen him
[22:06] work before and I know what God can do.
[22:16] Yes, I've been through enough to know
[22:20] he'll be enough for
[22:27] me. He's come through too many times and
[22:32] that puts my mind at
[22:35] ease for good.
[22:40] I'll stake my very life. He's going to
[22:44] take care of
[22:49] me because I've been through enough to
[22:54] know he'll be enough for me.
[23:01] Yes, I've been through enough to know
[23:06] he'll be enough for
[23:20] me. Beautiful. Beautiful job. Let's all
[23:24] stand and we'll approach the Lord. Word
[23:27] of prayer.
[23:31] Great and almighty
[23:33] God. Lord, I thank you for the
[23:35] testimonies we've already
[23:37] heard or knowing that you are not a God
[23:40] of the past, but you are a God of the
[23:44] present. As the Apostle Paul
[23:48] said in in his letter to the his epistle
[23:51] to the Hebrews, he said, "Jesus Christ
[23:54] the same yesterday and today and
[23:56] forever." Father, we believe that you
[24:00] are the same. You are the one that laid
[24:02] the stars in the skies. And Father, you
[24:05] are the one that heals our diseases. And
[24:09] you are the one that will one day come
[24:11] and carry us away. Lord, we are thankful
[24:14] that there is a God on the throne that
[24:17] hears
[24:18] prayers. Father, may your blessings be
[24:21] upon our testimony service this evening.
[24:24] And Lord, may it be pleasing to you as
[24:26] we lift up these
[24:28] praises in song and in
[24:31] word. May it be pleasing to you, Father,
[24:34] because we are returning a little bit of
[24:37] the thanks for the blessings that you've
[24:40] given us. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[24:44] God bless you. Be
[24:45] seated. The testimonies we've already
[24:48] heard, Daniel and Hope and Sarah. Wow.
[24:52] We can we can go home.
[24:54] That was good. Really, really good.
[24:57] Powerful testimonies. I want to share um
[25:01] a few scriptures before we get going. Uh
[25:05] let's turn in our Bibles to Hosea
[25:08] chapter 4 and verse
[25:16] 6. And I was talking with some of the
[25:20] kids at lunch about how important it is
[25:25] for us to know the word. Not just to
[25:27] take someone else's word for it, but we
[25:30] need to know God's word and we need to
[25:33] be able to apply it to our lives. Hosea
[25:37] 4:6 says this, "My people are destroyed
[25:40] for lack of knowledge. Because thou hast
[25:43] rejected knowledge, I will also reject
[25:48] thee. Because thou hast re rejected
[25:51] knowledge, I will also reject
[25:54] you. That thou shalt be no priest to me.
[25:59] Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of
[26:01] thy
[26:02] God, I will also forget thy children.
[26:06] Very
[26:07] strong, very strong statement that the
[26:10] Lord is making right there saying it's
[26:13] your fault that you have forgotten my
[26:16] word. It's your fault that you are
[26:19] perishing for lack of knowledge. It's
[26:20] not my fault. I have given you every
[26:23] resource you can. Today we have not only
[26:25] do we have a written Bible, we have
[26:27] Bibles on our phones. We can listen to
[26:29] the Bible. If you don't like to read,
[26:31] you can listen to it. You can read it.
[26:33] You can study different translations. We
[26:36] should not perish for lack of knowledge,
[26:39] but he said that they that we would.
[26:42] Let's go to Psalm 119. I'll read the
[26:47] whole thing. Just
[26:51] kidding. Psalm
[26:54] 119 verse
[26:57] 34. And it says
[27:01] this, David crying out, "Give me
[27:05] understanding and I shall keep thy law.
[27:08] Yay, I shall observe it with my whole
[27:12] heart." The prayer of the psalmist
[27:14] praying, "Lord, give me
[27:16] understanding of your word." And that's
[27:19] the same thing that we pray for. And we
[27:21] should always be open to more
[27:24] understanding, more knowledge. This is
[27:26] important that we do that we can read
[27:30] this book and we can apply it to our
[27:32] lives ourselves. You're not taking my
[27:34] word for it, but you're taking God's
[27:36] word for it. And this, my God's word. I
[27:41] um have a a couple short testimonies to
[27:44] get started. Um I was uh uh you can turn
[27:48] to Isaiah
[27:50] 53. Isaiah 53. I'm going to start with
[27:53] verse one.
[27:55] Um, I was in
[27:57] Jeffersonville. This uh kind of
[27:59] theologian guy, he uh he writes an email
[28:03] and it was it was a bit tur and he said,
[28:07] "Yeah, you guys you guys are wrong in
[28:10] the way that you quote Isaiah chapter
[28:14] 53." And let me let me read it. Chap
[28:16] Isaiah 53 1-5 says
[28:20] this, "Who hath believed our report? And
[28:24] to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
[28:26] For he shall grow up before him as a
[28:28] tender plant and as a root out of out of
[28:31] a dry ground. He hath no form or
[28:33] comeliness. And when we shall see him,
[28:36] there is no beauty that we should desire
[28:38] him. Speaking of the coming
[28:41] Christ, he is
[28:43] despised and rejected of men, a man of
[28:47] sorrows and acquainted with grief. and
[28:51] we hid as it were our faces from him. He
[28:54] was despised and we esteemed him
[28:56] not. Surely he hath borne our griefs and
[29:01] carried our sorrows. Yet we did seem him
[29:04] stricken, smitten of God, and
[29:08] afflicted. But he was
[29:10] wounded for our
[29:12] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[29:15] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[29:17] peace was upon him. and with his stripes
[29:20] we are
[29:21] healed. And he said, "You people quote
[29:24] that
[29:25] wrong." He says, he says, "You always
[29:29] quote saying that by his stripes we were
[29:33] healed." And he says, "It says in
[29:37] Isaiah that by his stripes we are
[29:40] healed." So why do you always say I was
[29:43] healed? I was healed at Calvary. I was
[29:46] healed way back then. and it was an
[29:48] email. So I responded and I put down the
[29:53] scripture in Isaiah. And then I also put
[29:55] down the scripture in 1 Peter chapter 2.
[29:58] Let's go there.
[30:01] 1 Peter chapter
[30:05] 2 verse let's start with
[30:18] um oh you know what Peter is not in
[30:25] Galatians now you learn
[30:27] [Laughter]
[30:29] something first Peter I'm Sorry. 1 Peter
[30:32] chapter
[30:33] 2.
[30:35] Um, yes.
[30:38] Verse
[30:41] 23. Who when he was reviled, reviled not
[30:45] again. When he suffered, he threatened
[30:49] not, but committed himself to him that
[30:53] judges, that judgeth
[30:55] righteously. Who was his own self? who
[31:00] his own self bear our sins in his own
[31:03] body on the tree that we being dead to
[31:07] sins should live unto righteousness by
[31:10] whose stripes you were healed.
[31:15] And and I got to admit the brother was a
[31:18] a bit of a theologian and he was a bit
[31:20] tur but he responded with an oh smiley
[31:25] [Laughter]
[31:27] face. It's a beautiful little lesson
[31:30] that Isaiah says by his stripes you are
[31:35] healed and then Peter says by his
[31:39] stripes we were healed is because Peter
[31:45] came and wrote this epistle after Jesus
[31:48] was crucified on the cross after Calvary
[31:52] because we can go back to that day on
[31:55] Calvary and say I was healed. on that
[31:58] day when he was bruised for my
[32:01] iniquities, when my sickness went upon
[32:04] him and he died for my sins and he rose
[32:08] from the dead and healed me of my
[32:11] diseases 2,000 years ago. I can go back
[32:14] to that place and say, "I was healed
[32:17] back then." It's a beautiful lesson.
[32:20] Isaiah saying, "We are healed." Peter
[32:22] says, "You were healed." And both of
[32:26] them are perfectly right. Perfectly
[32:30] right. I uh give a testimony. Nobody
[32:33] knows. I told my wife this. No, I didn't
[32:37] tell you, sweetheart. Um I told her
[32:39] about Daniel being
[32:41] healed. Um a few months
[32:44] ago, I was uh I was feeling kind of
[32:48] weird and I um I would lose my breath. a
[32:53] very very strong very strange feeling
[32:56] where I would be just I would be up here
[33:01] in the pulpit or I'd be at work or I
[33:03] would be even at home and my my breath
[33:06] would just I would almost lose my
[33:08] breath. It was a very very bad very
[33:10] strange feeling. Um very scary
[33:15] feeling. So, I was studying in my den.
[33:20] This went on for weeks and weeks and
[33:22] weeks. I was studying in my den and I
[33:26] started getting those feelings where my
[33:29] uh I would just like almost like my
[33:33] breath would leave me and it would just
[33:36] be for a a second or so and then it
[33:38] would come back and and I took my
[33:41] pulse and my heart would beat and then
[33:44] skip a beat.
[33:46] and then beat twice and then skip a
[33:49] beat. And it was it was really
[33:53] bad. And I was like, "Wow, this is not
[33:58] good." And I said, "That's what this is
[34:01] is my heart is I had I have an irregular
[34:04] heartbeat." So I called up Daniel. He
[34:07] was at work and I said, "Hey, man." I
[34:08] said, "I'm having this this problem."
[34:12] And he said, "Well, Dad, you should go
[34:13] to the emergency room." And uh and I
[34:16] think uh Stephanie, I think I called you
[34:18] too. I think I I um called both of you
[34:20] and both of you are like, "Hey, get to
[34:22] the emergency room." So I go there and
[34:26] of course by then my heartbeat's fairly
[34:28] normal. And uh they took some tests.
[34:32] They said, "No, you didn't have a heart
[34:33] attack. We don't see any any problems
[34:35] there." Um but you know, just watch it.
[34:39] I was like, "Man, I feel normal now, but
[34:41] I wasn't just a couple hours ago." So,
[34:44] um, Dan, um, I I went home and then it
[34:48] started up again and day after day and
[34:53] this was going on for months and it was
[34:55] it's a very I think it's a very common
[34:57] thing. So, you many of you have probably
[35:00] had this. Brother Lyle shared with me
[35:02] that uh, he scared him when he first
[35:06] started having it, but he said it's
[35:07] something that you still have it,
[35:09] Brother Lyle? Yes. And it's How long
[35:12] have you had it?
[35:14] 1981.
[35:17] So since since you're about 70 years
[35:22] old, I'm just
[35:24] kidding. So So Brother Lyle has had this
[35:28] for a long time. Well, I didn't like it
[35:31] at all.
[35:33] And so we had a a service uh a few
[35:36] months ago and I don't know if you all
[35:38] noticed but I asked the deacons to come
[35:41] up and pray for
[35:43] me and uh the the deacon brothers came
[35:46] up and and uh I said would you anoint me
[35:49] with oil because I'm having this and
[35:50] brother Lyall told me the story. He said
[35:52] he said brother Daniel don't don't worry
[35:54] about it. He said that this is a common
[35:56] thing that I I've I've had this for a
[35:59] long
[35:59] time. And I said, uh, I think my words
[36:02] were, "Yeah, but I don't want
[36:04] it. I don't like this. I didn't I don't
[36:08] like the
[36:09] feeling." So, they anointed me with oil
[36:13] and the symptoms
[36:17] persisted for a while, uh, for a few
[36:21] days after
[36:22] that. And, uh, one evening it was just
[36:25] on my heart and it was happening. And I
[36:27] I would take my pulse and I merely I
[36:30] think you saw me a few times caught me
[36:32] taking my pulse and what I was doing is
[36:34] I was like okay skipped it skipped oh
[36:37] skipped twice I'm going to die you know
[36:40] so and that's that's that's how I I was
[36:43] feeling and I
[36:46] uh I started praying I said Lord how
[36:49] many people have I anointed with
[36:51] oil and they've been
[36:54] healed I said Lord
[36:57] Who am I? What kind of a pastor am
[37:01] I that I can't be anointed with oil and
[37:04] I can't have the faith to believe? So, I
[37:07] went out for a walk and and as I was as
[37:10] I was walking, there's this place I go
[37:12] behind my house. It's uh uh Stephanie
[37:14] and I do it sometimes, like a four mile
[37:15] loop. And as I was out there walking, I
[37:18] could feel it really strong. And uh it
[37:21] was it was a very very uncomfortable
[37:23] feeling. And that's when I said I said,
[37:25] "Lord, what kind of a person am I that I
[37:29] go and pray for
[37:31] someone, but then I can't have the faith
[37:35] to be healed?" And I got back to my
[37:38] house, and that was uh well over a month
[37:41] ago, month and a half, and it hasn't
[37:43] come back
[37:49] since. God is good all the time.
[37:54] He's he's a healer. And when he gave his
[37:58] life, not only did he give his life for
[38:01] my sins on Calvary, but he gave his life
[38:05] that I might be healed also in this
[38:09] flesh, in this dying, corruptible flesh.
[38:12] He gave his life that I could have a
[38:15] little bit better life here on earth.
[38:19] Now, we we're having our testimony
[38:22] service tonight. I'm going to grab the
[38:24] microphone and I want you to tell them
[38:29] to tell all of us what the Lord's done
[38:32] for you. Brother Manny, can I start with
[38:33] you?
[38:35] Where's the microphone?
[38:53] I remember last week you were talking
[38:54] about pride.
[38:56] Wow. I had a lot of it in my heart like
[38:58] you said. you know, I had it and I had a
[39:01] grudge with my two oldest boys because I
[39:03] wanted them to apologize to me, but it
[39:06] was the other way around and I prayed
[39:08] that that day and God put in my heart on
[39:10] Monday. Well, they see it's up to you
[39:13] the ball. He's the court is you. So, I
[39:17] still had that pride like I'm not going
[39:19] to call him then. Like, I just called
[39:21] him and I said, "What's up?" He goes,
[39:23] "What's up?" I go, "Hey, man. I'm sorry
[39:25] for what happened." He goes, "Dude, I
[39:27] forgave you a long time ago." my life.
[39:30] So I was my own prisoner to that, you
[39:31] know, because I wanted them I wanted
[39:35] them I wanted them to ask for
[39:37] forgiveness, but I needed to ask for
[39:39] forgiveness. You know, when it's not
[39:41] it's not given, it's earned. And then I
[39:44] called my oldest says, "What's up old
[39:47] guy?" I said, "I'm sorry, dude. I
[39:49] forgave you a long time ago. My
[39:51] daughter, dude, I forgave you."
[39:53] So I was just kicking my own behind for
[39:55] something that you know I mean but it
[39:57] was that pride like you said. So when I
[39:59] gave it to the Lord like a big ton of
[40:01] bricks were lifted up and I'm at peace.
[40:04] You know what I mean? He deserves all
[40:07] the glory. Amen. Amen.
[40:14] A lot of times we carry these burdens
[40:16] and we and we don't have to do it. We we
[40:20] carry it because there's too much pride
[40:21] in us maybe to apologize. There's
[40:25] there's too much there's too much
[40:28] turmoil. There's too much fighting and
[40:31] we carry a burden that we don't have to
[40:35] carry.
[40:36] So when we get rid of our
[40:39] pride, what was that uh what was that
[40:41] scripture? Josiah, what was that
[40:42] scripture in um in Hebrew? I believe is
[40:45] in Hebrews that um he thought of not
[40:49] robbery. Philippians. Can you read it?
[40:52] You know what? I'll get up there. I'll
[40:54] read
[40:58] it. Thank
[41:00] you. Philippians chapter
[41:10] 2. I beat you.
[41:14] Philippians chapter
[41:16] 2 verse 5 it says this. Listen to this.
[41:20] Listen to the lack of
[41:22] pride that's in God made
[41:26] flesh. Let this mind be in
[41:30] you which was also in Christ Jesus. Now
[41:35] he's
[41:36] saying let the mind of Christ be in you.
[41:39] Now you follow my
[41:40] example. who thought who being in the
[41:43] form of
[41:44] God, thought it not robbery to be equal
[41:47] with God, but made
[41:49] himself of no
[41:53] reputation, and took upon him the form
[41:55] of a
[41:56] servant, and was made in the likeness of
[41:59] men. And being found in the fashion as a
[42:03] man, he humbled
[42:06] himself and became obedient unto death,
[42:11] even the death of the
[42:13] cross. Now, I got to keep going. Now
[42:16] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[42:20] him and given him a name which is above
[42:22] every name that that at the name of
[42:24] Jesus every knee should bow of the
[42:26] things in heaven and the things in earth
[42:29] in earth and things under the earth and
[42:31] that every tongue should confess that
[42:34] Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God
[42:37] the father. Amen. He humbled himself.
[42:41] There was no pride. And as I said when I
[42:44] ministered on that subject, you know who
[42:46] I think was are the least prideful
[42:48] people in the entire Bible are the
[42:51] prophets. And I believe that's how God
[42:53] could use them so mightily is because
[42:56] they they had problems in their life. We
[42:58] we go through that. We went through our
[43:00] our Bible study. Brother Lo and I went
[43:02] through the entire Bible and we saw that
[43:04] every single
[43:06] one had issues and had sin in their life
[43:09] and made mistakes, but they were able to
[43:12] humble themselves just as Jesus did. And
[43:16] he had no he had nothing wrong with him,
[43:18] but he humbled himself all the way to
[43:21] the cross. And then God exalted him. And
[43:23] you know what? He's going to exalt us.
[43:26] He's going to exalt us from this sinful
[43:29] world up into heaven. And it's called
[43:31] the rapture. Amen. I want to be there.
[43:34] Yes. And
[43:36] soften. That's what brother Manny
[43:38] Brother Manny just said. If this heart,
[43:40] it needs to be
[43:41] softened. And we don't have the Bible
[43:43] says this cold, stony heart. But if we
[43:46] have that soft, tender heart, then God
[43:49] has something to work
[43:50] with. Brother Juan, I'm sorry I didn't
[43:53] greet you. Welcome, Juan. Right. Yeah.
[43:57] Welcome. No, Kurt, I know you, Brother
[43:59] Kurt. You're
[44:02] not you're you're you're you're not a
[44:05] visitor. You're home you're home folk.
[44:08] Um any uh who's the next
[44:11] testimony? Sister
[44:23] Angela. So about a month ago, I think it
[44:26] was when Hadasa had an ear ache. um she
[44:29] went up for prayer and was anointed with
[44:31] oil and she came to me about two weeks
[44:33] ago or two weeks after that but quickly
[44:37] she was actually healed that night um
[44:39] from the ear ache but two weeks after
[44:41] that she came to me and she's like hey
[44:43] mom you know that thing that was on my
[44:46] arm and I said yeah and she goes those
[44:49] warts she had about six
[44:52] warts and um I said yeah and she goes
[44:55] they're all gone mom every single one of
[44:57] Um, and so I was looking and I noticed
[45:01] every single one was going, it was
[45:03] completely gone. And we had gone to
[45:04] doctors and trying to deal with the
[45:08] situation because they were spreading
[45:10] and we just I just forgot about it and
[45:12] just said, you know, Lord, you can take
[45:14] care of it. So I believe I don't know
[45:16] when she was healed, but it was just
[45:18] really neat to see that testimony on her
[45:21] and so she could see how the power of
[45:23] God can move too as well as the
[45:26] children. Amen.
[45:31] Sweetheart, do you believe in the Lord
[45:33] Jesus? Yes.
[45:36] She came up to be anointed with oil and
[45:38] the poor little thing was suffering and
[45:41] the Lord delivered her right there. And
[45:45] then he had a surprise for us and
[45:47] delivered you of the other things. God
[45:49] bless you, sweetheart. Very nice. Well,
[45:52] Paul, can you share that testimony I
[45:53] asked you?
[45:58] Earlier this week, uh, Brother Daniel
[46:00] and I had been talking. I don't remember
[46:02] exactly what led to the conversation,
[46:05] but,
[46:07] um, it wasn't too long ago, I had a a
[46:11] wisdom tooth removed that had been in my
[46:13] mouth way too long that had broken and
[46:17] it had gotten infected and was causing a
[46:20] lot of problems. But um shortly after I
[46:23] got it removed
[46:25] um I was still experiencing pain and
[46:30] uh anytime I'd eat certain foods
[46:32] especially with sugar it cause a lot of
[46:36] pain and uh at this particular time the
[46:40] the pain wasn't really going away and
[46:43] [Music]
[46:45] um I don't exactly recall um praying
[46:50] about it. And that's actually why I'm
[46:53] really selective usually when I tell
[46:54] somebody about this because I find it
[46:56] very humbling that God would do
[46:59] something like
[47:02] this. Um, sorry.
[47:07] Um, I was in a lot of pain and I had
[47:10] previously like the day or so before I
[47:12] heard in a video that I was listening on
[47:15] um, dental issues similar to mine that
[47:19] there was a likely chance I would have
[47:20] to go and have some procedure done where
[47:24] they like remove the infection. They
[47:27] suck out the marrow in your bone and
[47:29] stuff like that.
[47:31] And it had me a little stressed, but you
[47:34] know,
[47:35] it's I'm very quick to pray for other
[47:38] people, but I usually put myself off. I
[47:42] don't actually side note, this Monday, I
[47:47] believe it was, or Tuesday, I had this
[47:50] terrible pain in my shoulder. I was
[47:52] anytime I raised my arm like this, it
[47:55] felt like there was almost I've never
[47:56] had a bone spur, but it felt
[47:58] tremendously painful in there. It felt
[47:59] like there was like maybe something
[48:01] poking. And so, as you know, Andrea and
[48:05] I, we worked together. And I was like,
[48:06] "Could you just pray for me?" And she
[48:08] laid her hands on me, said a simple
[48:10] prayer, and I walked away. And I was
[48:12] like,
[48:14] "Oh, praise God. It's gone right now."
[48:18] So, it never came back. Praise the Lord.
[48:21] But uh the the issue with the tooth um I
[48:25] was woke up about two 2 or three in the
[48:28] morning and um was pitch black in the
[48:31] room except that I saw a blue light uh
[48:37] no larger than my pinky finger pointing
[48:40] where the pain was. And I felt the most
[48:45] incredible sensation of warmth. I I
[48:49] can't even describe it. It was like a
[48:51] supernatural hydrogen peroxide. My I
[48:53] could feel the bubbling and churning in
[48:55] my in my where it
[48:57] was. And I was just like, "Oh, God,
[49:00] thank you. This feels so wonderful." I
[49:02] was just I could I could just bask in
[49:05] this forever. And then it didn't last
[49:07] for maybe I don't even think it lasted a
[49:10] full minute, but uh it's been gone ever
[49:14] since. That was at least two years ago.
[49:19] So, amen. Thank you, Jesus.
[49:22] [Applause]
[49:25] I like what brother Paul said is I would
[49:26] like to just bask in that that spirit,
[49:29] that that feeling. One day we will. It's
[49:33] coming. He do you have a testimony? Did
[49:35] you say that you do?
[49:44] Um, well, just adding to uh what we got
[49:48] prayed for earlier today. I don't know
[49:50] about everybody else,
[49:53] but
[49:56] like the rapture is
[49:58] coming. It's on its way. I cannot tell
[50:02] you guys how many sermons I've sat
[50:04] through.
[50:05] Hours playing tapes at
[50:08] home. We know Jesus is on his
[50:11] way. Um, and you know, we should shape
[50:14] up. And that really speaks to me because
[50:17] I I don't know if you guys know, I went
[50:19] through a really bad divorce. I lost my
[50:21] house. I lost my health. You know,
[50:24] everything just kind of went to pot on
[50:27] me. And
[50:29] um, it just really tore me up.
[50:34] But one thing that helps with
[50:37] that, and I don't know if you guys are,
[50:41] I hope you are close
[50:43] enough to have people that talk to God
[50:47] every single day to bring your name up
[50:52] in prayer.
[50:56] That's one of the best
[50:58] things, you know, and
[51:02] uh I just uh I want to be
[51:06] right. I I don't want no, you
[51:11] know,
[51:12] baloney holding me
[51:14] back. I want to be right. And uh you
[51:17] know I was in the world for a long time
[51:19] drinking, smoking, drugs, pornography,
[51:23] you know, gambling, all of it. I did
[51:27] most of it. You know, I'd blare heavy
[51:29] metal music in your guys' ear. I can
[51:32] give you a headache real fast if you
[51:33] want. Play some of my own stuff, but I
[51:36] don't do that anymore. So, uh, but
[51:39] anyways,
[51:41] uh, my testimony today and especially
[51:45] not just me, but my
[51:48] girlfriend and, uh, her daughter, I
[51:52] could see God working in our lives. I
[51:54] really can't. I'm not just saying that.
[51:57] And I feel like, you know, I'm
[52:00] being placed certain places for a
[52:04] reason.
[52:06] And I know not to fight that, just to
[52:08] let it
[52:09] happen. Um, but I'm really looking
[52:12] forward to spending eternity with you.
[52:16] I mean that. And uh I
[52:21] really really just want to tell you guys
[52:24] just to hang on and and stay
[52:28] straight. Fly right there. There's no
[52:31] better time to do it than now.
[52:34] We don't need to get halfway there and
[52:37] then something happened and it doesn't
[52:40] work
[52:41] out. My heart right now, I want to be
[52:44] right with God. I don't want cars. I
[52:47] don't want houses. I could care less
[52:50] about property. I mean, would it be
[52:51] nice? Sure. But like, I could literally
[52:54] care less about that stuff. I want
[52:59] Jesus. I want more of Jesus.
[53:02] I want people going, "Man, that guy's
[53:04] got too much of Jesus."
[53:07] No one's going to do, but
[53:11] That's
[53:11] right. So, but I really I really believe
[53:16] if I could uh push anybody towards
[53:19] anything, go for
[53:21] that. No, nothing else matters.
[53:25] Literally nothing else. I've been in
[53:28] this world for 51 years. You know, I've
[53:31] had times where I've had money blown it
[53:32] all. I've had times where I've had
[53:34] really bad times. And there is nothing
[53:37] in this world, nothing, zero zilch, that
[53:42] is worth your
[53:43] soul. Nothing. You should be able to
[53:46] present that to one guy and one guy
[53:49] only. You know, I I've I've uh I had a
[53:52] lot of biker friends back in the day,
[53:57] pagans, you know, and I uh I was at the
[54:01] was living at my buddy's house a long
[54:03] time ago and they had this whole big old
[54:05] thing and they asked me if I wanted to
[54:07] get blessed and I said, "No thanks." I
[54:10] said, "I got a God. He works fine." So,
[54:13] but they did this whole big old, you
[54:16] know, dancing hall of blue. You know, it
[54:18] was really weird because there was like
[54:21] absolutely no respect. Everybody's
[54:23] cursing, drinking, you
[54:26] know, but
[54:28] um it made me
[54:31] think I'm in the wrong
[54:35] place. I'm in the wrong spot and I need
[54:39] a way out of here.
[54:41] And you know, uh, maybe it was my
[54:44] prayer, maybe it was somebody else's,
[54:45] but the Lord eventually did get me out
[54:48] of there, you know, maybe it was this
[54:51] woman. For some stupid reason, she likes
[54:54] me. So, uh, but anyways, and I like her
[54:59] back and things have been a little bit
[55:01] hard on us lately. you know, she had her
[55:04] knee replaced and we've had a lot of,
[55:08] you know, just bills and stuff like
[55:10] that. But eventually, we got caught up.
[55:14] And so now, I mean, with with everything
[55:17] settled, her knee seems to be mostly
[55:20] healed up. We want to be back in church.
[55:23] I want and and uh I want to be spot on,
[55:26] you know. I don't want to be, you know,
[55:30] it's really weird because you want to do
[55:32] this stuff. You want to then you what do
[55:35] you do? You go home and you sit on your
[55:37] phone or, you know, you watch TV,
[55:40] something else, you know, and then it
[55:42] finally hits you, hey, you should be in
[55:43] your prayer
[55:45] closet. And uh when I first started
[55:47] coming here, that's all I was doing. I
[55:49] was in my prayer closet like daily.
[55:52] I was praying for this guy and for you
[55:55] guys, your family, whether you know it
[55:57] or
[55:57] not. And uh I miss
[56:01] that. I I
[56:04] don't I don't want to have the
[56:06] experience I had before.
[56:08] I want real.
[56:16] [Applause]
[56:21] Heath and I, we go back many
[56:26] years. And
[56:28] um when Stephanie and I were going to
[56:30] move to Tucson, move back home, there
[56:34] was one person that I really had on my
[56:36] heart and that was Heath. And I really
[56:39] wanted to reach out to him. So, I called
[56:42] my brother-in-law, David Carroll, and
[56:44] said, "Hey, do you have Heath's number?"
[56:46] And he said, "Oh, yeah." And he got his
[56:48] phone and and sent me his phone number
[56:51] and and I called it and it was somebody
[56:55] else. It wasn't wasn't Heath. Now that I
[56:57] know Heath, now that I know Heath, I
[57:00] know that this is a common occurrence,
[57:01] by the way. He changes phones and phone
[57:03] numbers quite
[57:05] often. But it was on my heart. I
[57:09] wanted I wanted to talk with
[57:12] him. And so I was here, I don't know, we
[57:15] were here for a month or maybe two
[57:17] months, three months. And I kept asking
[57:19] around. Nobody knew where Heath was.
[57:21] Heath had just
[57:22] left.
[57:24] And I pray for him and say, "Lord, I I
[57:28] just want to see him."
[57:30] And I was uh went to church at um for
[57:34] the
[57:35] po and brother Paul asked me, he said,
[57:38] "Hey, can can you preach
[57:41] tonight?" And I said, I said, "Yeah, I
[57:45] think so. I can
[57:47] try." And I got up there to minister and
[57:50] this guy walks
[57:53] in and I thought, "Oh Lord."
[57:57] and we hooked up after um after service.
[58:01] And let me tell you, man, there's no
[58:04] more going back to that stuff. I know
[58:05] you've gone in and out and in and out,
[58:08] but we have to be willing as brothers
[58:10] and sisters and as friends that the the
[58:13] pro the um the book of Jude says you
[58:15] have to be willing to put your hand in
[58:17] the
[58:18] fire. If you put your hand in a fire,
[58:21] you're going to get burned. But you have
[58:23] to be willing to put your hand in the
[58:27] fire for your brother and jerk him
[58:30] out. And that's what we need to be
[58:32] willing to do. And
[58:34] bro, you're not you're not going back in
[58:36] the
[58:38] fire. He said, "Thanks for the hand."
[58:41] Who's next? Brother Kurt. God bless
[58:45] you. Thanks,
[58:49] brother. That was really good, brother.
[58:52] That was really good. Uh, I'd just like
[58:56] to read a very short
[59:01] paragraph. It says, "Now, is an angel a
[59:05] higher order than a
[59:07] man or a lower
[59:11] order?" All right,
[59:14] sir. Which is the
[59:17] greatest, a son of
[59:19] God or an angel?
[59:23] the son of
[59:25] God. Which would God hear the
[59:29] best? An angel standing there before him
[59:34] pleading for someone or one of you
[59:39] pleading? One of you
[59:41] all. Because your sons and
[59:45] daughters, they're
[59:47] servants. See, they're servants. and
[59:50] your sons and daughters. So, see what
[59:55] authority you have, just afraid to use
[1:00:01] it. I read that the other day. I've
[1:00:04] known about it for a while, but just the
[1:00:06] Lord just brought it back to my
[1:00:09] remembrance. And you know, the
[1:00:12] Bible calls us kings and
[1:00:16] priests or intercessors.
[1:00:21] And that's what you're hearing tonight.
[1:00:24] Someone was praying for someone
[1:00:28] else. A lot of times in your prayer
[1:00:31] life, you'll feel a little stuck. Well,
[1:00:33] just pray for someone else
[1:00:38] first. And it won't feel always normal
[1:00:42] or natural, but the more you do it, the
[1:00:45] more it takes over you.
[1:00:50] And one of the great things about prayer
[1:00:52] and even prayer sometimes feels a little
[1:00:54] awkward, a little little silent maybe.
[1:00:58] But each time you go to your closet, as
[1:01:01] you were saying, the first thing you do
[1:01:03] is
[1:01:05] reent
[1:01:07] yourself, rededicate
[1:01:10] ourselves, reconsecrate ourselves first
[1:01:15] thing because if he has you, he can get
[1:01:18] anything out of
[1:01:20] you. And and you the more you exercise
[1:01:24] that, the more you practice that, the
[1:01:26] more it becomes a part of
[1:01:30] you. Yeah. The more you do it, the more
[1:01:33] it becomes a part of you. And it's and
[1:01:34] he'll if you're not sincere, he'll take
[1:01:36] care of
[1:01:37] that. He'll take care of it. But you
[1:01:40] must be
[1:01:43] willing to present yourself that way.
[1:01:47] Many times I'm not sincere with that.
[1:01:51] But he knows how to put the pieces in
[1:01:54] the puzzle in the right place. So I am
[1:01:56] because I am a king and a priest and so
[1:01:58] are
[1:02:00] you. You were born to serve someone else
[1:02:04] with your prayer
[1:02:06] life. Then all of a sudden he'll have
[1:02:08] someone pray for
[1:02:11] you. That's
[1:02:13] victory. And it is it is not a gift. It
[1:02:17] is an overcoming.
[1:02:20] as you move into that that's that's not
[1:02:22] just some I know that there is an
[1:02:24] intercessory thing but I'm talking about
[1:02:27] him shaping our
[1:02:29] character by exercising
[1:02:32] ourselves and it it says confess your
[1:02:35] faults one to another and pray one for
[1:02:38] another that you may be
[1:02:41] healed see and he he teaches us how to
[1:02:44] be
[1:02:46] servants and I'm going to take care of
[1:02:48] you before I take care of me. Now, I
[1:02:50] must have water in my
[1:02:52] cup. I must have water in my
[1:02:55] cup. And he'll help you with that. But
[1:02:59] in my heart, I'd rather you
[1:03:02] be blessed than
[1:03:06] me. Easy said, "But the tutor will do
[1:03:09] that. You can't do that yourself, but
[1:03:13] the tutor will." And he's never failed
[1:03:15] at that. Brother, I I just want to
[1:03:18] encourage you. That is right. Your
[1:03:19] prayer closet's a secret here. And every
[1:03:22] day just give yourself to him. All of
[1:03:24] us. You know, if everyone in this room
[1:03:25] did that, if we did that, this place
[1:03:29] would
[1:03:30] explode. If we practice that, this place
[1:03:33] would explode. Any place would explode
[1:03:36] because he wants us. Once he gets us, he
[1:03:39] can do anything he
[1:03:41] wants. That's the key. So, I really
[1:03:44] appreciate all the testimonies, but
[1:03:46] they're all
[1:03:48] about presenting yourself to God and and
[1:03:52] and praying for someone else as a king
[1:03:54] and a priest. Those aren't just words.
[1:03:57] That's reality. You are literally that.
[1:04:00] And the more you practice that, the more
[1:04:02] it becomes who you are. And then all of
[1:04:04] a sudden, someone else is in front of
[1:04:06] you. It just doesn't happen. It's not a
[1:04:09] little light switch. It's something that
[1:04:11] he installs in you. It's something that
[1:04:13] the tutor does because that's who you
[1:04:16] are. You're a king and you're a priest
[1:04:18] and you're here to live for someone
[1:04:21] else. It just doesn't happen. It's a
[1:04:25] classroom and it's
[1:04:29] good. Appreciate
[1:04:32] that. As brother Kurt was talking, we
[1:04:35] all want to have the spirit of Christ,
[1:04:37] right?
[1:04:39] It always comes back to one man. Why?
[1:04:42] Why is it why is it like that?
[1:04:44] Everything that we talk about, every
[1:04:46] scripture we read, it all comes back to
[1:04:48] one man. And that
[1:04:51] man, he lived a life for other people.
[1:04:55] In fact, he went to the cross for other
[1:04:59] people. And if we say we have his
[1:05:01] spirit, just like brother Kurt said,
[1:05:03] then we give our lives for others just
[1:05:06] as Christ did.
[1:05:08] Amen with
[1:05:18] Jeremy. I better talk to me, too.
[1:05:22] Um I just was thinking about that story
[1:05:25] brother Brandham said and I was
[1:05:28] rehearsing it but maybe tell you but for
[1:05:32] 15 years he always saw those cysts on um
[1:05:37] Sister Mey and um he he could grab her
[1:05:42] hand and his hand would show that
[1:05:45] germ and it was one of those gifts that
[1:05:48] he had and every
[1:05:51] every child that he had all the way up
[1:05:54] to Joseph, he would ask the
[1:05:57] doctor, "Can you see that cyst on the
[1:06:00] uterus?" Because he knew it was there.
[1:06:03] And uh and he he said there's um a
[1:06:08] different quote somewhere, but he said,
[1:06:11] "Everything we face is in us.
[1:06:16] We're gonna we're we're kind of like a
[1:06:18] pinball machine and we're going to touch
[1:06:20] things and um if you ever broken
[1:06:25] something, sprained something, the trial
[1:06:28] is already in you and you're just kind
[1:06:31] of manifesting it. And so it's it's a
[1:06:36] courage thing that God um is with you
[1:06:40] through all that. And um for um my mom
[1:06:45] knows this, but I
[1:06:49] uh she always says Jeremy had a small
[1:06:53] bladder
[1:06:55] and and to go on trips I was just like a
[1:06:59] three-year-old. You know, I'd go for an
[1:07:01] hour and then I had to pull over. My
[1:07:03] wife can tell you all of our trips we've
[1:07:06] we've had to do a lot of things like
[1:07:08] that. And
[1:07:10] um and like four weeks ago, I was just
[1:07:14] in the
[1:07:15] house
[1:07:18] and it just like there was like
[1:07:21] lightning that like just run across here
[1:07:25] and I was suffering with just from
[1:07:27] picking up the kids and whatnot.
[1:07:30] um my lower back was hurting me and it
[1:07:32] was all right there and it
[1:07:35] left and so so I was like I didn't know
[1:07:41] it didn't even dawn on me until two
[1:07:43] weeks later. I was working my routes and
[1:07:46] I wasn't having my normal like habitual
[1:07:49] bathroom breaks. Every time I could use
[1:07:52] the bathroom I'd just go. And
[1:07:55] uh and even right now I could probably
[1:07:59] go but I don't have
[1:08:02] to. So I'm just like normal like all of
[1:08:05] you now. And I just want to thank God
[1:08:08] for
[1:08:15] it. Any more hands, sweetheart?
[1:08:20] So this one time I we were driving down
[1:08:23] the road and it was monsoon season. I
[1:08:26] was freaking out any but like when we
[1:08:29] were getting close to our house I my
[1:08:32] favorite song on the radio came out and
[1:08:34] I was no longer afraid at all. Not one
[1:08:37] bit. it. My this my f the song my
[1:08:40] favorite song was
[1:08:43] was take take it all
[1:08:48] back. It's the song about is that that
[1:08:52] it's not like the other songs. It's
[1:08:54] usually like once the enemy steals
[1:08:56] something from you, you just take it
[1:08:58] back. Amen.
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:05] Young lady was just baptized a few weeks
[1:09:08] ago. God bless her little
[1:09:11] heart. Sister
[1:09:19] Sarah, I have to tell them myself. I
[1:09:22] wasn't sure if I would share this, but
[1:09:24] both listening to the different
[1:09:25] testimonies, brother Manny and brother
[1:09:27] Kirk and brother
[1:09:29] brother has said already
[1:09:32] um about pride and that we're supposed
[1:09:36] to be a light. I was in the clinic and I
[1:09:39] had just come out of a surgery and I was
[1:09:42] having some really hard times with the
[1:09:44] nurses in there and there was one
[1:09:46] particular nurse, she was young, um, new
[1:09:49] nurse learning her job and making a lot
[1:09:53] of mistakes along the way but also
[1:09:55] getting me in a lot of trouble and I did
[1:09:57] not appreciate that. So, I had a little
[1:09:59] bit of resentment towards her or maybe a
[1:10:01] lot. And um we were just kind
[1:10:04] of going back and forth over it was
[1:10:07] about a year and a half of me constantly
[1:10:09] struggling with this young nurse and um
[1:10:13] coming out of surgery, of course, I'm
[1:10:16] not feeling good and it was no excuse
[1:10:18] for me to do what I did. And so one day
[1:10:22] um I go in and I'm like literally like a
[1:10:24] week out of surgery and I'm fatigued.
[1:10:27] I'm tired. I'm hurting really bad and I
[1:10:30] get this nurse and all I could think
[1:10:31] was, "Oh great, here we go again. I
[1:10:33] don't have the energy for this. I don't
[1:10:35] have the patience for this." And um I'm
[1:10:39] very ashamed of what I did. and she just
[1:10:41] came up
[1:10:42] and wasn't anything she did really, but
[1:10:45] I bit her head off and I was just so
[1:10:48] rude to her and I just, you know, just
[1:10:51] kind of wailed on her
[1:10:54] and I
[1:10:56] wasn't, you know, I wasn't repentant at
[1:10:58] all. But after she left, I thought, why
[1:11:01] did you do
[1:11:02] that? Why did you treat her like that?
[1:11:05] She didn't deserve that. and you know
[1:11:07] better just because you're feeling bad
[1:11:09] and you don't and I felt so guilty as I
[1:11:13] should have and some time went by and
[1:11:17] pretty soon I started having a physical
[1:11:19] problem that I hadn't encountered before
[1:11:22] ended up having a massive allergic
[1:11:24] reaction and this went on for some weeks
[1:11:27] and I couldn't find the source of the
[1:11:29] problem ended up in the hospital for a
[1:11:31] day trying to check it out and every day
[1:11:34] I would think next time you see that
[1:11:36] nurse you need to
[1:11:37] apologize and I didn't want to and I was
[1:11:40] like ah she probably you know it's all
[1:11:43] in a day's work other people get yelled
[1:11:45] at doesn't matter you know I'm trying to
[1:11:47] excuse myself and it was shameful and I
[1:11:50] just kept thinking no you really need to
[1:11:53] apologize that wasn't
[1:11:55] right and so finally the day comes where
[1:11:59] she's back on rotation and it's about a
[1:12:01] month out and I'm still having this
[1:12:03] physical problem and I see her and I'm
[1:12:07] like, "Oh, she's probably
[1:12:09] forgotten." You know, and I get to my
[1:12:13] chair and I think and about the time I'm
[1:12:16] ready and I'm like, "I really don't want
[1:12:18] to." And the Lord brought that scripture
[1:12:21] to my mind. Confess your faults one to
[1:12:24] another that you may be healed.
[1:12:27] And that thing that was bothering
[1:12:30] me, I knew the Lord had caused that in
[1:12:34] that moment. I knew if you want that to
[1:12:38] stop and that allergic reaction to stop
[1:12:40] and this to be well, you need to do what
[1:12:43] the Lord said, you were in the wrong and
[1:12:45] you should not be treating people. You
[1:12:47] shouldn't be joining them in what
[1:12:48] they're doing. You need to hold your
[1:12:51] standard. And so I had to eat crow,
[1:12:55] humble myself very much and
[1:12:59] uh tell her I was sorry for that. And
[1:13:02] the most amazing thing was when I did
[1:13:05] that, her heart softened towards me and
[1:13:08] she didn't ever treat me bad after that
[1:13:11] again. And it I felt like the scripture,
[1:13:14] she's heaping coals on my
[1:13:17] head because she came back with kindness
[1:13:21] when she hadn't been so kind before. And
[1:13:24] I thought, you know, I'm supposed to be
[1:13:27] the Christian. I'm supposed to be the
[1:13:29] one being a light and doing what's right
[1:13:32] and how can I hold my head up in here
[1:13:35] saying that God's going to heal me if I
[1:13:37] treat people
[1:13:38] bad. So, had to knock some more pride
[1:13:41] off. Had to learn some more lessons. But
[1:13:44] I'm grateful, like you said, God is the
[1:13:45] tutor and he does teach you how to be
[1:13:49] even when you're kind of dragging your
[1:13:51] feet and having to, you know, you want
[1:13:54] to say face or put on a brave face, but
[1:13:56] God's saying, "No, there was no need for
[1:13:58] that." So, I'm just grateful that he was
[1:14:01] merciful to me to help me learn
[1:14:08] that Sister Sarah
[1:14:11] herself is a miracle. Just her being
[1:14:14] able to hold this microphone and speak
[1:14:19] and humble herself before all of us.
[1:14:22] Sister Sarah, I believe it was Solomon
[1:14:25] that said, "A soft answer turns away
[1:14:28] wrath.
[1:14:30] the wisdom of the Lord, the Holy Spirit
[1:14:32] in Solomon. Someone
[1:14:43] else. Hello. Um, my testimony is
[1:14:47] regarding my son,
[1:14:49] Khalo.
[1:14:51] Um, I prayed for all my children all the
[1:14:54] time to to get saved and to turn their
[1:14:57] heart to God. But he's my special kid.
[1:15:00] He likes to help everybody. And lo and
[1:15:02] behold, he always gets himself mixed up
[1:15:03] in things just because he's helping
[1:15:05] people. And he truly is from his heart
[1:15:07] helping people and he just gets mixed up
[1:15:09] and stuff. Well, um, for the longest
[1:15:11] time, I would pray for him and he'd
[1:15:13] always come to church, but I noticed he
[1:15:16] wouldn't much be paying attention. And
[1:15:17] I'd pray to God, God, you know, he needs
[1:15:19] to get baptized. is in with him getting
[1:15:21] ready to get his amputation. I said,
[1:15:23] "Lord, if he could just give his heart
[1:15:25] to the Lord, it doesn't matter what
[1:15:26] happens, you know, after that." And I
[1:15:28] knew that I would pray and pray and pray
[1:15:30] and and this has been since maybe he was
[1:15:32] about 12 years old, like age of
[1:15:34] accountability. So, I would pray and
[1:15:35] pray for him and still like, "God,
[1:15:37] you're not answering me." So, a lot of
[1:15:39] what Pastor Dan preached about today,
[1:15:42] um, I felt that that's what I was doing.
[1:15:43] I was like the little kid pulling on,
[1:15:45] you know, Jesus. Hey, hey, listen to me.
[1:15:47] Listen to me. And I'd continue to pray
[1:15:48] no matter what. And when we had the
[1:15:51] potluck and um Sister Martha said,
[1:15:53] "Sister, what's wrong with Cleo?" And
[1:15:54] I'm like, "I have no idea because I was
[1:15:56] so busy in the kitchen and I look up and
[1:15:58] he's here." And when he actually said,
[1:16:01] "I don't know what this is, but I know
[1:16:03] it's God and I know he's real." Um God
[1:16:05] since then has taken a hold of him. Uh
[1:16:08] Daniel Junior's his best friend. He's
[1:16:10] just like, "Daniel Junior invited me to
[1:16:11] go do this and Daniel Jun invited me to
[1:16:13] do that." And he never in the past would
[1:16:15] be excited about um things of that. Like
[1:16:18] they're going to have the picnic and
[1:16:19] he's in charge of the games. Mom, what
[1:16:20] do you think about words gramples as far
[1:16:22] as the Bible goes? What do you And like
[1:16:23] he's so on fire and it's just such a
[1:16:26] blessing. And God's shown me, you know,
[1:16:28] it may take 10, 15 years, but he'll
[1:16:30] always work in in his way. So, thank
[1:16:33] you.
[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:38] Sister
[1:16:39] Lonnie was saying that she felt like
[1:16:41] that
[1:16:42] widow that just kept
[1:16:44] knocking, kept pulling on Jesus's robe
[1:16:48] and kept knocking and knocking and
[1:16:49] knocking and and that's what he wants us
[1:16:51] to do as the parable went this morning.
[1:16:55] And when Cleo came up in his wheelchair,
[1:16:58] I didn't really notice him when he came
[1:17:02] up there and I looked and when when I
[1:17:05] looked down, I think somebody got my
[1:17:07] attention and I looked down and he was
[1:17:09] he was sitting right over
[1:17:10] here. Yeah. In his wheelchair. And I
[1:17:15] looked
[1:17:17] down and I walked over to
[1:17:22] him and
[1:17:25] He said, "I don't know." He said, "I
[1:17:28] just want to give my heart." He says,
[1:17:29] "I'm finished with it. I just want to
[1:17:31] give my heart to the Lord Jesus." And
[1:17:33] I've never in all my time and with youth
[1:17:37] camps and ministering and and being in
[1:17:40] the ministry really for about the past I
[1:17:43] don't know almost 20 years. I've never
[1:17:47] seen someone pour out their heart like I
[1:17:51] did with Cleo.
[1:17:53] And the weeping and the tears and the
[1:17:56] joy that that young man had
[1:18:00] was really without equal as far as what
[1:18:03] I've seen. Sister Lonnie, the title of
[1:18:05] that sermon, you know, you said you kept
[1:18:08] knocking and you kept knocking. The
[1:18:10] title of of that sermon was, "Are they
[1:18:12] worth the
[1:18:13] effort?" They're worth They're worth the
[1:18:16] effort. Amen.
[1:18:23] Um, so about a month ago, um, I've been
[1:18:28] experiencing trials and tests and I
[1:18:32] would just keep praying out and crying
[1:18:34] out to the Lord. And I remember brother
[1:18:36] Daniel had preached and he had said
[1:18:39] there everything that was going on with
[1:18:41] Job is it something that's happening in
[1:18:44] your life that the enemy can go to God
[1:18:48] and say about this person. So just
[1:18:52] everything I was going through it was a
[1:18:54] Wednesday and I came to work to church
[1:18:57] and I prayed and I said Lord why do all
[1:18:59] these things happen? What do I need to
[1:19:02] do? And I just said, we were studying um
[1:19:07] brother Lyall was doing the Bible study
[1:19:09] on uh Joseph and I said, "Lord, we've
[1:19:13] gone through so many five chapters and I
[1:19:16] know that Job has never been mentioned,
[1:19:19] but if you can just if you can just even
[1:19:22] refer to Job or a scripture,
[1:19:25] something then I'll know that that's
[1:19:28] what it is and it will be easier for me
[1:19:31] to know that your and is upon me with
[1:19:35] the enemy. And sure enough, brother
[1:19:37] Lyall read a scripture from the book of
[1:19:39] Job.
[1:19:42] And so it just makes it easier to know
[1:19:44] that I can go to the Lord and he will be
[1:19:47] there and I have victory over the enemy.
[1:19:50] Yes.
[1:19:53] [Applause]
[1:19:57] Of course, brother Lio, he had no idea.
[1:20:00] But the Holy Spirit knew from the
[1:20:03] foundation of the world, knew from
[1:20:04] thousands and thousands of years ago
[1:20:06] that Lyall Johnson would be ministering
[1:20:09] and that Sister Debbie would have asked,
[1:20:12] "Would you please just let him mention
[1:20:16] this?" And he did. And I'll tell you
[1:20:19] what, Sister Debbie was like six and a
[1:20:21] half feet tall when she walked out of
[1:20:23] service that day. She was so happy. She
[1:20:26] was just walking on air. And she she
[1:20:28] said, "Brother Daniel, I have a
[1:20:29] testimony to tell you." And she told me,
[1:20:30] "Brother Lyall, that that you had
[1:20:32] mentioned Job." And she said, "I'd put
[1:20:34] this before the
[1:20:35] Lord." Someone
[1:20:37] else. I'll uh go to Sister Elizabeth
[1:20:42] first and then I'll come over
[1:20:46] there. God bless your brothers and
[1:20:48] sisters. I've been praying for my family
[1:20:50] um that is not serving the Lord for a
[1:20:52] long time like my sister prayed for me.
[1:20:55] I had a close cousin that turned her
[1:20:57] back on me when I told her that I would
[1:20:59] not attend her daughter's samesex
[1:21:01] marriage and we were very very close. I
[1:21:05] helped raise her daughter. So when I
[1:21:08] rededicated my life and I told her that
[1:21:10] I I would go to birthdays and um
[1:21:13] graduations and other family events if
[1:21:16] they invited me. But once I told her
[1:21:18] that I would not participate in any LGBT
[1:21:22] um backed whatever events, she stopped
[1:21:25] talking to me. And it hurt. It cut deep
[1:21:28] cuz we were very
[1:21:29] close. And I've been to family events
[1:21:32] where she'll get her chair and just turn
[1:21:33] it around and give me her back. Just
[1:21:36] walk by me, won't acknowledge me. I send
[1:21:38] her texts, birthdays, wishes, ann, you
[1:21:41] know, ann whatever it is. She's always
[1:21:43] shut me down. Today there was a family
[1:21:45] event and I just prayed and ask the door
[1:21:48] to open a small door that I can come in
[1:21:50] and just witness to somebody something.
[1:21:54] And it's hard for me to go to family
[1:21:55] events because they have, you know,
[1:21:57] boobly boobly moves like brother Brandon
[1:21:59] would say, drinking and, you know, and
[1:22:01] there's cursing. And the last time, one
[1:22:03] of the last times I went, I asked my
[1:22:05] brother if we could pray for the food.
[1:22:06] And he said,
[1:22:08] "No." And then my other cousin that was
[1:22:10] standing there, he started laughing. He
[1:22:11] goes, "No, we don't need any of that
[1:22:12] around here." And it cut deep to my
[1:22:15] heart. It hurt me very
[1:22:19] deeply. And and recently I had invited
[1:22:21] them to do something and they kind of
[1:22:23] uninvited me to their event because my
[1:22:25] brother says, "Well, there's going to be
[1:22:26] a lot of drinking and a lot of you, you
[1:22:28] know, we'll just get together another
[1:22:29] day." Said, "Okay." So they invited me
[1:22:31] today. So I went and I asked the Lord
[1:22:34] not to let me feel stressed about going
[1:22:38] because I knew I would be seeing some of
[1:22:39] these
[1:22:40] people. And um my cousin that had been
[1:22:44] very close to me and I always kept the
[1:22:46] door open because I want to be a light
[1:22:48] and I want my light to shine brighter. I
[1:22:51] don't want them to say about me that
[1:22:53] just because I'm serving the Lord that I
[1:22:55] don't want these people in my life. But
[1:22:58] I want to be able to witness and my
[1:23:00] light to shine brighter so my circle can
[1:23:02] get bigger and I can witness to more
[1:23:04] people and be a testimony that God can
[1:23:06] change people. Brother, you don't know
[1:23:08] the life that I have
[1:23:10] lived. You know, if God can change me,
[1:23:14] he can change
[1:23:15] anybody. And today for the first time,
[1:23:19] my cousin greeted me and she said, "Hi,
[1:23:21] Missy." And when I left, she said, "Bye,
[1:23:25] Missy." And for her just to even utter
[1:23:27] my name after just completely shutting
[1:23:31] me off cold won't let me even go visit
[1:23:34] her mom who's like very
[1:23:37] elderly you know. Um so to me that's a
[1:23:42] victory and her name is Michelle. Keep
[1:23:45] praying for my family please. The Lord
[1:23:48] has been good.
[1:23:52] I love that. I'll come right back. Like
[1:23:55] I love that that humility and that love
[1:23:58] and that burden for someone else. I got
[1:24:02] a real quick testimony and then I'll
[1:24:04] bring the microphone back there for
[1:24:05] another testimony. I was so I
[1:24:08] ministered last week on pride and I made
[1:24:12] the statement. I said, "What's worse?" I
[1:24:16] said, "What do we think of pride? What
[1:24:18] do we automatically associate pride
[1:24:20] with?" And I said, "Gay pride." And I
[1:24:24] said, "What's worse,
[1:24:26] gay or
[1:24:29] pride?" Pride's
[1:24:31] worse. So then, and I said, "If a
[1:24:36] minister would be
[1:24:38] up, you would find out that that he had
[1:24:41] an immoral problem or a lust problem or
[1:24:44] or a pornography problem or something
[1:24:46] like that. You wouldn't want that person
[1:24:48] to be up here and and ministering. You
[1:24:50] wouldn't want them to pray. You wouldn't
[1:24:51] want them to speak publicly. you
[1:24:53] wouldn't want them to do any of those
[1:24:54] things. But then I said, but if that
[1:24:57] person had
[1:24:58] pride, which is a greater sin to
[1:25:02] God, you'd say, "Oh, well, who doesn't
[1:25:06] have
[1:25:07] that?" And
[1:25:09] then it's pride. And then we had a a
[1:25:14] couple visitors, one in particular
[1:25:16] that's uh sitting, Brother Juan, about
[1:25:18] where you are. And
[1:25:20] uh I was um greeting him on the way
[1:25:25] out and Sister Amelia calls
[1:25:29] me and she says, "Brother
[1:25:32] Daniel," she says, "Um, do you remember
[1:25:35] this person that came to church?" And I
[1:25:38] said, "Oh, yeah." I greeted him. She
[1:25:40] said, "Um, well, he has a transgender
[1:25:47] friend and his transgender friend wants
[1:25:50] to come to church on Sunday." I was
[1:25:55] like,
[1:25:57] "Oh, Lord, what do I
[1:26:02] do?" He brought my own
[1:26:05] words right back into my face.
[1:26:11] And he said, "What are you going to
[1:26:14] do?" And I said, "He'd be welcome to
[1:26:18] come and give his heart to the Lord
[1:26:21] Jesus." And Sister Mill said,
[1:26:25] "Uh, are you sure?" And I said, "Yes,
[1:26:28] ma'am." I said, "That man has a
[1:26:32] soul that's worth 10,000 worlds." Now,
[1:26:36] we can't bring that sin. We can't have
[1:26:39] that sin in the church, but that soul
[1:26:44] that soul is worth 10,000 worlds to me.
[1:26:47] And I believe that if that person ever
[1:26:51] comes, I pray that they they I'm going
[1:26:53] to use a proper pronoun. He gives his
[1:26:57] heart to the Lord Jesus and comes to
[1:27:00] this altar and makes a change.
[1:27:16] So, like two years ago, I was at normal
[1:27:20] Saturday and my dad took me to a jumping
[1:27:23] place and it was this super bouncy
[1:27:27] trampoline, which I know I've gone on
[1:27:30] that
[1:27:30] before, but little did I know
[1:27:34] There was rules, but I knew the rules
[1:27:38] cuz I've been there before. And I jumped
[1:27:41] on the trampoline cuz I knew the rules.
[1:27:43] Only one person allowed. And then these
[1:27:46] two people came on there. And I I felt
[1:27:50] like I broke my
[1:27:52] ankle. But I didn't
[1:27:56] cuz two at least two uh three days later
[1:28:00] it was healed. like like at least three
[1:28:05] or two
[1:28:06] days it was healed like no pain at all.
[1:28:12] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:28:15] I love that. You know, you teach the
[1:28:18] kids to give God praise, to give God the
[1:28:21] glory, and to rely on God when they need
[1:28:25] help.
[1:28:27] Anybody
[1:28:30] else? Did I miss one? Brother Jordan.
[1:28:41] Oh, and the greatest gift is
[1:28:45] love. I want to tell you about an
[1:28:48] incident that happened about three weeks
[1:28:50] ago, maybe two weeks ago. We had a dear
[1:28:53] brother pass away.
[1:29:01] Few things out of this is
[1:29:04] that forgive me brother
[1:29:08] for interrupting the service that day
[1:29:11] and I I know it's been forgiven
[1:29:15] and God corrected my my error and I also
[1:29:20] want to ask for for your forgiveness
[1:29:22] also for doing that.
[1:29:28] Um, and so
[1:29:30] now the the
[1:29:32] blessings, not only did the Lord bless
[1:29:36] my
[1:29:38] wrongness, but I had an
[1:29:41] envision
[1:29:44] of giving something to the Roberts
[1:29:48] family during that time of
[1:29:51] turmoil. And I didn't know about
[1:29:56] the the graveness. I guess I'm I'm not
[1:30:00] an articulate person for me to get up
[1:30:03] and say things.
[1:30:06] uh million things flood into my mind and
[1:30:08] it's just trying to get the right
[1:30:13] uh so the story behind that is when we
[1:30:18] heard that brother Roberts was in the
[1:30:20] hospital with a
[1:30:23] very bad condition.
[1:30:26] Uh, I have the invision to to send them
[1:30:30] a card,
[1:30:34] but not from
[1:30:36] me, but the family
[1:30:39] here saying
[1:30:43] that you
[1:30:45] have many, many,
[1:30:48] many brothers and sisters that are
[1:30:52] praying for you.
[1:30:54] So I
[1:30:56] decided with a
[1:30:59] card and so my wife has a stack of
[1:31:03] cards with all kinds of things, you
[1:31:06] know, birthdays, anniversaries,
[1:31:10] etc. And it wasn't until we got I went
[1:31:14] through them until I got to the last
[1:31:15] one, not knowing the complete story of
[1:31:19] what was happening.
[1:31:22] Um, and I said, "There it is. That's
[1:31:25] that's the
[1:31:27] one." And so I had the I didn't have a
[1:31:30] vision, but I
[1:31:34] envisioned the tabernacle to sign that
[1:31:38] and to to give
[1:31:41] it to the
[1:31:43] family.
[1:31:46] Um, so it came Sunday morning. It was
[1:31:49] hard news.
[1:31:52] um that he had passed
[1:31:55] away. Uh
[1:31:59] so I wanted everybody that was my my
[1:32:02] vision to have everybody and I said well
[1:32:06] if I left it in
[1:32:07] the you know by the water cooler you
[1:32:10] know people may not have seen it.
[1:32:15] So I did something that may
[1:32:19] be irrational or something
[1:32:22] to to to announce
[1:32:26] that the story gets even better than
[1:32:30] that. So I had
[1:32:32] envisioned just the inside being
[1:32:37] filled but it
[1:32:39] went beyond that.
[1:32:43] And so that was a real real real
[1:32:45] blessing to see
[1:32:50] that. The second blessing I guess was
[1:32:55] that brother Daniel
[1:32:57] you said you know will we have service
[1:33:00] that
[1:33:01] night or will we be a good
[1:33:07] Samaritan? And sometimes I think
[1:33:11] that we need to go more than just tell a
[1:33:15] person that you're in our
[1:33:18] prayers. Okay. Uh something about I can
[1:33:24] show me your faith and I'll show you my
[1:33:28] works. So I decided to be a Samaritan
[1:33:32] tonight for all of you. Not not just me.
[1:33:39] So, if none of you know where the
[1:33:40] Roberts
[1:33:42] live, well, we finally found the
[1:33:45] address. We had to go through books and
[1:33:47] books to find find an
[1:33:50] address. And
[1:33:52] they're out there in the
[1:33:56] boonies. And it's not too difficult
[1:33:59] during the daytime probably because
[1:34:01] there's not too many signs.
[1:34:04] but try to do it in the evening time and
[1:34:08] it becomes a
[1:34:11] nightmare. So, it kind of became a
[1:34:15] nightmare not knowing where the turnoffs
[1:34:19] exactly were because it's growing and
[1:34:21] everything and there's new streets and
[1:34:23] and everything.
[1:34:26] So, it took me about a half hour from
[1:34:28] where I started and I only made a few
[1:34:32] errors that I knew I wasn't going in the
[1:34:34] right direction. Uh, and I finally got
[1:34:38] to the Robert's
[1:34:40] house and I knocked on the door and
[1:34:44] Sister
[1:34:45] Hattie answered it. I gave her gave her
[1:34:49] the card and Sister Sarah came out.
[1:34:57] The blessing
[1:34:59] is the family that we have
[1:35:02] here, each and every one of
[1:35:05] you. Because when I handed her the card,
[1:35:10] she didn't say thank you or anything,
[1:35:11] you know. You know, she was
[1:35:15] distraught, but she could see a
[1:35:19] difference that it wasn't coming from
[1:35:22] one person.
[1:35:24] was coming from all of you.
[1:35:29] So, I just wanted to tell you this the
[1:35:33] story behind that because you only get
[1:35:36] bits and pieces. And
[1:35:41] so,
[1:35:44] brother, first of all, let me say
[1:35:45] something about brother John. He is the
[1:35:49] I mean, there's there's some people some
[1:35:51] of us are a little bit harder to love
[1:35:54] than than others. Daniel said, "True.
[1:35:59] Brother
[1:36:00] John, you're one of the easiest people
[1:36:03] to love. You have just the sweetest
[1:36:07] spirit. Brother Dan passed away. I knew
[1:36:09] it just before church, but they the
[1:36:12] family asked that please don't tell
[1:36:13] anyone because we haven't told our
[1:36:15] family yet. So, we waited until um
[1:36:20] halfway and I got the text saying you
[1:36:22] can go ahead and tell. And it actually
[1:36:24] had a it was a good time in my sermon.
[1:36:26] Um it was kind of along the subject to
[1:36:28] say that brother Dan had passed away
[1:36:31] that
[1:36:33] night. That very night we had a card
[1:36:37] from Tucson Tabernacle with our
[1:36:39] signatures on it for the Roberts family
[1:36:41] because God had led brother led brother
[1:36:43] John before service. He had led brother
[1:36:46] John to buy that card, not knowing that
[1:36:49] brother Dan was in that serious of a
[1:36:51] condition that brother Dan was going to
[1:36:53] pass away. The Lord had led him, got the
[1:36:56] card, got us to sign it, and got it to
[1:36:58] the family. I thought that represented
[1:37:01] us just like you said, Brother John,
[1:37:02] very, very well. Amen. Brothers, if we
[1:37:06] um worship team,
[1:37:09] let's praise

[1:51:28] Almighty. Feels so good to speak that
[1:51:31] name. Thank you, Lord, for the

[1:54:08] I feel good. I'm ready to take on the
[1:54:10] world. Let's go. Let's take it. If the
[1:54:14] Lord Jesus is with us, we can take
[1:54:16] it. Satan, he can't. He has to bow
[1:54:19] before that name, too. So we if we go in
[1:54:22] the name of Jesus then we are going with
[1:54:24] the same power that Jesus Christ had. So
[1:54:27] go in that power this week. Stand
[1:54:29] strong. Keep your testimony. Be humble.
[1:54:33] Don't have any pride. But know that you
[1:54:35] are a son or a daughter of God. God
[1:54:38] bless you brothers and sisters. You're
[1:54:39] dismissed.
