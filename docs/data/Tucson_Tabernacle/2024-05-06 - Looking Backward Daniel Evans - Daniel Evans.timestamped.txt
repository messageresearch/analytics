[31:29] the Apostle Paul says this he says if by
[31:32] any means I might attain unto the
[31:34] resurrection of the Dead not as though I
[31:37] had already attained either were already
[31:41] perfect but I follow after that I may
[31:45] apprehend that for which also I am
[31:47] apprehended of Christ
[31:50] Jesus Brethren I count not
[31:53] myself to have apprehended he's saying
[31:56] that I have I don't have it
[31:58] yet but this one thing I do forgetting
[32:01] those things which are behind and
[32:04] reaching forth unto those things that
[32:06] are before I press toward the M the mark
[32:10] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[32:12] amen in Christ Jesus amen thank you you
[32:16] can take your
[32:17] [Music]
[32:21] seats brother Josiah

[32:53] we should never
[32:55] neglect our worship and and to take take
[32:58] that time to Worship the Lord
[33:02] and we on our Wednesday night bible
[33:05] study we were talking about job and and
[33:08] job how he lost his livelihood he lost
[33:12] his job he lost all of his money he lost
[33:15] all of his wealth and then he lost all
[33:17] 10 of his children all died in one one
[33:20] great
[33:22] catastrophe and job here he is and
[33:26] he's he's he's just beaten down to death
[33:30] and what does he do he gets down on his
[33:33] knees and he

[33:38] what we need to do more of we we we
[33:41] can't as brother Josiah said we can't do
[33:44] it
[33:45] enough he is so great and and the more
[33:49] that we worship Him the closer that we
[33:51] will get to
[33:54] him I
[33:56] was yesterday I was praying
[34:00] about the direction that the Lord wants
[34:03] me to go I've been working obviously you
[34:06] work all week and and you're trying to
[34:08] find the Lord's will you're trying to
[34:10] you're studying and and you're trying to

[34:40] like it's it's hard for me I don't know
[34:43] if it's hard for you
[34:44] but it sometimes it's hard for me to
[34:47] really enter into prayer right away like
[34:51] right when I get on my knees and pray
[34:52] sometimes the Lord's just right there
[34:55] but most of the time it takes it takes
[34:57] takes time to to get my mind calmed down
[35:03] and and that's why coming to church
[35:06] early it helps you it helps us get into
[35:09] that spirit before we get here and then
[35:12] we're ready to receive and we're ready
[35:15] to worship as the worship leader is up
[35:17] there then we can it's easier to enter
[35:19] in and we're not just scattered and and
[35:23] and trying to trying to get our minds
[35:25] right and and I was walking up
[35:28] the mountain up this little Trail going
[35:30] up
[35:32] and just wanting to get out all of my
[35:36] thoughts before I came before the Lord
[35:38] in prayer and and I was walking up and I
[35:41] was praying and I was thinking and and
[35:44] going through the the different things
[35:47] that were in my mind and I started
[35:52] noticing that how much this trail that
[35:56] i' I go up and I've been going going up
[35:58] there for years and years how much it
[36:00] changes all the time I'm going up this
[36:03] trail and I noticed that this time a
[36:05] year there's a lot of there's a lot of
[36:07] grass growing there's a a little creek
[36:09] that's running and and as I'm going up
[36:14] I'm thinking Lord that you created all
[36:16] of this this beautiful creation these
[36:19] great Catalina mountains 9,000 ft tall
[36:22] and and there's pine trees up at the top
[36:25] and and down where I was there was Oak
[36:27] trees and juniper trees and and just
[36:29] thinking of how much variety God has and
[36:33] thinking that as I'm on my way up there
[36:36] Lord I'm going to talk to
[36:40] you I'm going to talk to the almighty
[36:44] God I I want to I want to have a
[36:46] conversation with you and it's the
[36:49] greatest thing that we could ever do is
[36:53] have this conversation with god can you
[36:55] imagine actually talking to him
[36:59] stand on our knees or whatever it is and
[37:02] and speaking to him and then having him
[37:04] speak back to us
[37:07] what as I was going up I was thinking on
[37:09] those things and I was thinking lord
[37:11] it's my greatest desire in life it is
[37:13] everything to me if I could just do one
[37:16] thing it would be to talk to
[37:19] you and have you speak
[37:22] back I know
[37:24] that we've been mankind has been been
[37:27] trying to do that for 6,000 years and he
[37:30] does speak back to us as I was
[37:34] on my way up thinking about job and and
[37:39] how job's comforters so-called
[37:42] comforters we we talked about this on
[37:44] Wednesday night they were his friends
[37:46] and they were really hard on him but
[37:48] they didn't really care what job said
[37:51] job was going through all these hard
[37:53] times and and they came and and they
[37:55] would hear him out but they just were
[37:57] waiting
[37:58] to talk they wanted to get their words
[38:01] in and they didn't really care what what
[38:03] job had to
[38:05] say and then after all of this
[38:09] happened this dialogue between job and
[38:12] these and these these friends of his
[38:15] back and forth and justifying themselves
[38:17] and condemning job for sinning secretly
[38:21] because he must have sinned because all
[38:22] of this bad stuff happened to him so
[38:25] they were condemning him job said I
[38:26] don't know what's going on on they're
[38:27] back and forth and then at the very end
[38:31] God
[38:32] speaks and isn't that like the nature of
[38:35] God we talk and we talk and we talk all
[38:39] the time
[38:42] and sometimes it's nice just to have
[38:45] somebody to listen to us things are hard
[38:48] in life a real friend sometimes that
[38:50] just sits there and and listens and says
[38:53] what can I do for you and that's how God
[38:55] does so much we talk and we pour out our
[38:59] heart to him he just listens and he
[39:00] listens he's so kind he's so loving and
[39:04] I was as I was going up there I was
[39:06] talking and and praying and I was and I
[39:09] said Lord look at this beautiful Creek
[39:12] coming across this this big crass and
[39:15] and look at these oak trees that are
[39:17] growing here and and look at the grass
[39:20] and and everything changes so much in
[39:23] nature it's so Dynamic it's always
[39:26] Reviving him itself it it goes from to
[39:30] summer when it's just dry and then the
[39:32] monsoons hit and you see the cactus they
[39:34] start to swell up everything changes all
[39:37] a sudden everything's green and then it
[39:39] goes from from time to time always
[39:42] changing and that's how God
[39:45] is he's
[39:47] always he doesn't change but our
[39:51] environment around God changes and the
[39:55] times change he likes
[39:58] variety and as I was going up there
[40:02] thinking about how our
[40:06] testimonies should be like nature it
[40:09] should never be
[40:11] stale every it should always be fresh
[40:14] and we should always be revived and we
[40:17] should never brothers and sisters we
[40:19] should never be able to look back on our
[40:22] lives and see that I was closer to God
[40:27] at another time than I am right
[40:31] now we should always be the closest to
[40:33] God that we've ever been right now and
[40:36] we should never also we should never be
[40:38] looking behind us we should never be
[40:42] looking in the
[40:44] past so so often I see so many of the
[40:48] brothers and sisters they struggle with
[40:50] past sins that they've had and they look
[40:53] back at these sins and and they just
[40:56] can't get past them don't don't you know
[40:57] when you're looking at these past sins
[41:00] when you're looking in the past that you
[41:02] are
[41:05] sinning that is a sin because you're
[41:08] denying the very power of the blood of
[41:10] Jesus Christ when you do that and I know
[41:14] it's hard for some people people have
[41:16] different personalities and some people
[41:18] just can't get over their mistakes but
[41:20] you have to have more faith in that and
[41:22] you can't doubt the blood of
[41:26] Christ Don't Look
[41:29] Back always look forward God as I said
[41:33] is constantly
[41:36] renewing he's he's constantly renewing
[41:38] nature he's constantly renewing life
[41:41] that you'll see a cycle of Life I'll go
[41:43] up there and all of a sudden there's a
[41:44] there's a new tree growing that I didn't
[41:47] notice or there's new animals that that
[41:51] I've never seen before and it's always
[41:53] something fresh and it's always
[41:54] something new and that should be the
[41:56] life of a Christ Christian it shouldn't
[41:58] be looking back and trying to create a
[42:00] world that's time past it should be now
[42:03] and here and this is a Revival that's
[42:06] coming forth out of
[42:08] me that should be us all the
[42:12] time let's
[42:14] turn in the Book of
[42:16] John chapter
[42:19] 7 verse 37 it says
[42:22] this Jesus
[42:25] speaking or in the last day that great
[42:28] day of the feast Jesus stood and
[42:32] cried saying if any man thirst let him
[42:35] come unto me and to drink you noce Jesus
[42:40] he wants that relationship he doesn't
[42:43] want it just
[42:45] once he doesn't want you to just come to
[42:48] the Lord Jesus and then you get changed
[42:52] and then he steps back and you never
[42:53] come to him again when we drink drink if
[42:57] I take a a drink of of water when I'm
[43:02] thirsty it's refreshing and it feels
[43:05] good but later on I'm going to thirst
[43:08] again when you're out working in in the
[43:10] Sun and and you get hot and and you get
[43:13] dehydrated and you take that water and
[43:16] it feels so good and you drink it and oh
[43:19] it's just so refreshing and then you go
[43:21] back to work but you're going to get
[43:22] thirsty again so you got to go back to
[43:25] the well and drink again again and
[43:27] that's how it is with Jesus Christ you
[43:29] don't just come to him once and come to
[43:32] the Altar and make a change in your life
[43:35] it is a constant refilling you're
[43:38] thirsty all the time you want more and
[43:40] more and you take a big drink and you
[43:42] just feel so good but it's okay to get
[43:44] thirsty again that's all right and then
[43:48] you come back to that well and you you
[43:50] want more and you get
[43:54] more he wants that relationship all the
[43:58] time verse 38 he that believeth on me
[44:02] the Lord Jesus talking as the scripture
[44:05] hath said out of his belly shall flow
[44:08] rivers of Living
[44:11] Water he's not saying that these rivers
[44:15] of Living
[44:16] Water are flowing from
[44:19] him he's not saying that these rivers of
[44:22] Living Water in this verse he's not
[44:25] saying that they're coming out of Jesus
[44:26] Christ
[44:27] Christ he's saying that if you come to
[44:30] me and if you believe me then these
[44:34] rivers of Living Water these rivers of
[44:37] water will be coming out of
[44:39] you and we we don't think that we're
[44:42] always thinking that it's going to be
[44:44] Jesus but Jesus pours these Waters into
[44:46] us and then those water come that water
[44:49] comes out and it's like in the desert
[44:52] right now look and it's just there's
[44:53] just so much
[44:55] life and it's because there's water
[44:59] there and it's not a drip Jesus isn't
[45:02] talking about a drip or a little trickle
[45:04] or a Sprinkle he's saying rivers of
[45:07] water will flow out of
[45:10] you if you believe on
[45:13] me not pointing to someone
[45:18] else but it's coming out of that
[45:24] Christian but this spaky listen to this
[45:28] but this spake he of the
[45:31] spirit which they believe on him should
[45:34] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[45:38] given because that Jesus was not yet
[45:41] glorified so this is a prophecy that
[45:43] Jesus is saying he said that if you
[45:45] believe on me you're going to receive
[45:48] this Holy Spirit and then this River of
[45:51] water is going to flow out of you and
[45:54] then there's going to be others that
[45:55] come and drink of it amen out of
[46:01] you we've read in the book of Acts and
[46:05] we've seen these great Servants of the
[46:07] Lord over the
[46:09] years we've seen it in in more
[46:12] recently in William brandom and how he
[46:15] had the power of the Holy Ghost that was
[46:17] represented in his life where people
[46:19] came from all over the world to come to
[46:22] his meetings to not only hear him preach
[46:24] but to be prayed for documented cases of
[46:29] famous people a a man that had been
[46:33] crippled paralyzed for most of his life
[46:36] a congressman named William Upshaw
[46:40] Upshaw came to the service he was called
[46:44] out sitting there and healed completely
[46:48] restored to where he he could walk
[46:51] again coming and receiving that water
[46:55] that was being being ped poured
[46:58] out another woman Florence Nightingale
[47:01] you've read the story she was dying of
[47:04] cancer she was this close to death got a
[47:07] hold of brother Brandon when he was in
[47:10] when he got into England and they came
[47:12] to the airport they got him he went
[47:14] there prayed for her and she was
[47:16] completely made well that water just
[47:19] flowed out of him my
[47:23] grandpa bitten by a rattlesnake
[47:27] this comes right home here he told
[47:30] me bitten by a rattlesnake suffering
[47:35] there was prayed for and was
[47:38] healed close friends of our family came
[47:41] and were healed of cancer and and awful
[47:45] things I think merily I think even Rod's
[47:48] mom was healed of cancer if I remember
[47:50] right and one of brother brandom's
[47:52] meetings the river of water was flowing
[47:55] out of this man
[47:57] and people came to
[48:00] drink in Hebrews 11 we hear of the faith
[48:03] of Abel and and the the proper sacrifice
[48:06] that he had in Enoch who was raptured
[48:08] and Noah who built this Ark by faith in
[48:12] Abraham and Sarah who
[48:15] claimed even at 90 years old the promise
[48:18] of God that they were going to have
[48:20] children claimed it it was given to
[48:24] them old
[48:27] far beyond that and yet by faith they
[48:30] accepted it and they were given
[48:34] children given a child
[48:37] Moses by faith refused to be called the
[48:40] son of Pharaoh's
[48:42] daughter these great warriors of Faith
[48:47] they had it in Living Waters came out of
[48:52] it Hebrews chapter 11 let's read just
[48:55] the last part of it verse
[48:58] 31 by faith Rahab the the Harlot Rahab
[49:03] perish not with them that believe not
[49:05] when she received the spies with peace
[49:07] and what more shall I say for the time
[49:11] would fail me to tell of Gideon and of
[49:13] baric and of Samson and of jeepa and of
[49:15] David also and Samuel and all the
[49:17] prophets if you were coming to our
[49:18] Wednesday night bible studies you'd know
[49:20] who every one of those
[49:23] were amen
[49:26] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[49:30] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[49:32] stopped the mouth of lions quenched the
[49:35] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[49:38] sword out of weakness they were made
[49:40] strong they waxed Valiant in fight
[49:42] turned to flight the armies of the
[49:44] aliens women received their dead raised
[49:47] to life again and others were tortured
[49:49] not accepting Deliverance that they
[49:51] might obtain a better
[49:53] resurrection and others had trial of
[49:56] crew mockings and scourgings yay
[49:59] moreover of bonds and imprisonment they
[50:02] were
[50:03] stoned they were sawed aunder they were
[50:06] sawed in half they were tempted they
[50:09] were slain with the sword they wandered
[50:11] about in sheep skins and goatskins being
[50:13] destitute Afflicted and tormented of
[50:16] whom the world was not
[50:19] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[50:22] mountains and in dens and in caves of
[50:24] the
[50:24] earth and these all having obtained a
[50:27] good report through faith received not
[50:30] the
[50:31] promise God having provided some better
[50:35] thing for
[50:36] us wow digest that for a
[50:39] minute God having provided some better
[50:41] thing for us that they without us should
[50:44] not be made
[50:46] perfect wherefore seeing we also are
[50:49] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[50:52] witness lay aside every weight and the
[50:56] sin which doth easily beset us and let
[50:59] us run with patience the race that is
[51:02] set before us live this life run this
[51:06] race do your best looking unto Jesus the
[51:10] author and finisher of our faith who for
[51:13] the joy that was set before him endured
[51:17] the cross despising the shame and is set
[51:20] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[51:23] God
[51:24] Amen Jesus Christ is the author and
[51:27] finisher of our faith and if we believe
[51:30] him then the rivers of water brothers
[51:32] and sisters would flow from us through
[51:35] the power of His holy spirit FL from us
[51:39] like they did these people I just read
[51:44] about
[51:47] but we always try to live in a different
[51:51] time we always try to live in the
[51:54] past we try to recreate something that
[51:57] has already been passed and we are
[51:59] ignoring the prophecies that are fresh
[52:02] and that are applied to this day and
[52:04] they're
[52:06] not moving backwards these prophecies
[52:10] are for
[52:13] us again in John 7:38 he said he that
[52:16] believeth on me as the scripture has
[52:17] said out of his belly out of his belly
[52:20] out of this person shall flow rivers of
[52:23] Living Water
[52:26] and
[52:28] prophesying of what was going to happen
[52:30] at the day of Pentecost when 120 were
[52:32] filled with the with the Holy Spirit and
[52:35] then they set the precedent for everyone
[52:38] after that to be filled with that same
[52:40] Holy Spirit but
[52:43] instead brothers and sisters instead of
[52:46] us re having that living
[52:49] water and giving that living water out
[52:52] we point to something be in the past
[52:56] we're always pointing backwards and and
[53:00] and showing people that but ignoring
[53:03] this person right here and say this is
[53:05] the man this is the woman that has this
[53:08] Holy
[53:10] Spirit but we want to point backwards to
[53:12] a different day Joshua didn't try to be
[53:15] Moses when he crossed over Jordan he
[53:17] didn't try to bring the law he conquered
[53:20] that Promised Land he remembered what
[53:23] had happened but he went forward in a
[53:25] different generation than Moses
[53:30] did when I was when I was up on the
[53:32] mountain praying yesterday was asking
[53:35] the
[53:36] Lord then I finally got up to my place
[53:40] and I was praying and trying to get
[53:43] quiet before the Lord and seeking what
[53:46] his will was and asking him Lord do you
[53:48] want me to minister on this this subject
[53:51] of Looking Backward because it's an
[53:54] awful thing always looking back
[53:57] how many times have we heard that man
[54:00] his nature is to look back at what God
[54:04] did before and look forward to what
[54:07] God's going to do but ignoring what's
[54:09] going on right now wow and that is the
[54:12] biggest problem we we look back all the
[54:14] time we look we look at all the healings
[54:16] and all the Miracles and all that that
[54:18] was
[54:19] yesterday we live in today we remember
[54:22] that we learn from that we honor the
[54:24] word we apply the word to our lives but
[54:27] we live in this day and there are
[54:29] promises to come we look forward to
[54:31] those but right now wow and as I was
[54:35] praying on that and studying not
[54:37] studying but as I was praying and and
[54:39] sitting on that rock and asking the Lord
[54:42] Lord do you want me to say
[54:45] this to the church do you want me to go
[54:48] in a different direction I don't know
[54:50] Lord I don't know what to do I just I
[54:51] just want your will
[55:01] then as usual with most of us I got up
[55:05] and Lord I think I'm going in the right
[55:07] direction I I want
[55:10] to I didn't maybe get an answer like
[55:12] I've gotten a couple times in my life
[55:15] so I uh I said well I'm going to listen
[55:17] to a sermon on my way home which I
[55:20] usually do I usually try to get quiet
[55:22] before the Lord as I walk up there and
[55:24] then I spend an hour or however long I'm
[55:26] up there praying and then on the way
[55:28] back down I like to listen to a sermon
[55:31] or listen to my Bible on the way home
[55:33] with my earbuds so I've been wanting to
[55:36] hear a sermon titled who is this mzc
[55:39] I've I've heard it many times before but
[55:40] I wanted to kind of refresh my memory
[55:42] and and listen to it again so I got on
[55:44] my phone and I uh I started I looked I
[55:50] picked it out
[55:52] and I went to play it and it said would
[55:55] you like to download it's like man I've
[55:57] heard this sermon before I don't know
[55:59] why it wants me to download it should
[56:00] already be in my memory so I hit yes and
[56:03] it downloaded a sermon and then it
[56:04] started playing a different
[56:07] sermon I thought okay well here's one of
[56:10] those things I know this sounds
[56:13] small
[56:14] but Lord do you want me to hear this
[56:16] other sermon amen or do you want me to
[56:19] or is this just the devil fighting me
[56:21] from looking listen to this one yeah
[56:23] aren't we just so messed up in our minds
[56:25] we're just
[56:26] sometimes we're just kids sometimes I am
[56:28] it's like Lord I don't know what to do I
[56:29] don't know this sermon that sermon
[56:33] and I was that a impass I didn't know
[56:36] what to do so I stood there for a minute
[56:39] and I'm sitting on this rock and it's
[56:41] just beautiful out across this Valley
[56:44] and I'm thinking Lord this is so
[56:48] wonderful what do you want me to do I
[56:51] said okay I'll just listen to the one
[56:53] that
[56:54] downloaded so I started listening to
[56:57] that
[56:58] one and asking the Lord Lord do you want
[57:03] me to talk do you want me to encourage
[57:05] or discourage the people from constantly
[57:08] looking
[57:09] back so I turned it on and it wasn't one
[57:12] or two
[57:13] minutes and this quote came
[57:17] up said this I would have loved to live
[57:21] in that day speaking of the Lord Jesus
[57:23] and his disciples I would have loved to
[57:26] live in that day to follow him but you
[57:28] know I'm glad I still have the privilege
[57:31] of doing the same thing watching him do
[57:33] things and it's a greater it's greater
[57:36] to watch him today than it was
[57:40] then I have more faith in him now and
[57:43] can have more faith now than I could
[57:45] have then because we've had 2,000 years
[57:47] to prove that the gospel is right and
[57:50] after 2,000 years he's still alive
[57:54] am he is
[57:58] Jesus Christ is
[58:00] alive he's still alive and doing just as
[58:05] he did then so we have a greater
[58:07] assurance and more foundation for Faith
[58:10] now than they had
[58:13] then what I just read in
[58:16] Hebrews this is
[58:18] greater than it was even then so
[58:21] brothers and sisters we are not to live
[58:23] in the past even if it's 50 years years
[58:26] ago we are to live in the
[58:29] now and these rivers of water should be
[58:32] flowing from
[58:34] us
[58:36] not William brandham or Billy Paul
[58:39] brandom or Perry green or or any of us
[58:42] not Martin Luther not John the Baptist
[58:45] not Moses not Elijah they should be
[58:47] flowing from
[58:50] us but a sectarian Spirit we often call
[58:54] it denominational spirit will always
[58:56] influence us to live in another day
[59:01] it'll try to
[59:02] create something that a past world what
[59:06] we do is we try to create a world and
[59:09] live in the
[59:11] past it always happens that way and then
[59:15] we want to look like they looked we want
[59:18] to talk like they talked we want to act
[59:21] like they acted back
[59:24] then and forsake and forget about living
[59:27] today listen to this Ecclesiastes 7: 10
[59:32] if you could put the King James version
[59:33] up there I'm going to read the English
[59:34] Standard Version it says say not why
[59:37] were the former days better than these
[59:41] for it is not from the wisdom that you
[59:43] ask
[59:44] this don't say that it's these past days
[59:47] don't say why was that better than it is
[59:50] now because that is not wisdom leading
[59:52] you in asking that question
[59:56] wow it's so
[59:58] easy to say that I wished I would have
[1:00:01] lived in Moses's day or I wish I would
[1:00:03] lived in the prophet's day or I wish I
[1:00:05] would have lived in the the early
[1:00:06] Revival of the early 1900s or in 70
[1:00:10] years ago but that is not wisdom that
[1:00:13] causes you to say that and it's not God
[1:00:16] that's putting that in your mind w we
[1:00:18] don't go back to that we should be
[1:00:21] focused on today and not a hundred years
[1:00:23] ago or not 2,000 years ago
[1:00:31] we
[1:00:32] see that when revivals rise
[1:00:36] up that often times a sect or a group or
[1:00:42] a denomination forms from those revivals
[1:00:46] and then the spirit dies right there
[1:00:50] there's
[1:00:51] um back in the
[1:00:53] 1500s this man named Martin Luther rose
[1:00:57] up a Revival rose up among the people
[1:01:01] and it started this
[1:01:03] Protestant
[1:01:05] Revolution this Protestant Revival where
[1:01:09] they came against the church and and and
[1:01:11] said that there's certain things Martin
[1:01:13] Luther wrote 95 of them these 95 things
[1:01:16] don't line up with the
[1:01:18] word and he stood up against it and it
[1:01:21] started this great
[1:01:23] movement that we still see see today and
[1:01:27] from that
[1:01:29] movement there was a group of people
[1:01:32] that rose up they're called the
[1:01:34] anabaptist I'm going to give a little
[1:01:36] history
[1:01:37] lesson and what the anabaptists are is
[1:01:40] they said that you need to there needs
[1:01:43] to be a
[1:01:47] personal um
[1:01:49] conviction before you're baptized there
[1:01:53] needs to be a repentance there you need
[1:01:56] to say that I want to be baptized the
[1:01:59] Lord has to do a work in your life
[1:02:01] before you're
[1:02:03] baptized instead of infant
[1:02:06] baptism when a child can't um a child
[1:02:10] can't uh can't repent a child you're
[1:02:14] just basically getting the kid
[1:02:16] wet it doesn't do any good but when
[1:02:20] there is a real repentance there saying
[1:02:23] that Lord I'm sorry I want to change I
[1:02:27] want to show everybody up in this
[1:02:29] baptismal that I am a different person
[1:02:32] that's what started right
[1:02:34] then and then it moved into different
[1:02:38] divisions and they started like people
[1:02:41] do splitting and fighting and doing what
[1:02:43] they
[1:02:44] did there was this
[1:02:47] man named menos Simons I don't know if
[1:02:51] I'm pronouncing his name right he was he
[1:02:53] started the menite church
[1:02:56] and they were more conservative group
[1:02:58] they they were anabaptist they said that
[1:03:01] you had to have a confession of Faith
[1:03:03] before you were baptized and a a very
[1:03:07] conservative group and they go along and
[1:03:10] then there was this other man named
[1:03:14] Jacob Ammon again I don't know if I'm
[1:03:17] pronouncing his name right it's German
[1:03:19] Swiss
[1:03:20] names and he started the
[1:03:23] Amish faith that came from the menite
[1:03:27] faith and what his deal was and what
[1:03:29] their deal was is you're not being
[1:03:31] conservative enough you're not you're
[1:03:34] you're being too worldly the
[1:03:36] menites you guys are being too worldly
[1:03:39] you're dressing too worldly you need to
[1:03:42] start when the people start to stray you
[1:03:44] need to start shunning
[1:03:46] them you need to start kicking them out
[1:03:48] of church if they're not looking and
[1:03:52] acting like we are you need to start
[1:03:54] dividing you need to start separating so
[1:03:57] then this Amish group gets started and
[1:04:01] when they did this brothers and sisters
[1:04:02] they may have been great men but when
[1:04:04] they did this that Revival
[1:04:07] died and then it was just Traditions
[1:04:09] after that as I
[1:04:12] said there was no more rivers of living
[1:04:16] water flowing from these people now it
[1:04:18] just became a
[1:04:21] denomination it just became a group of
[1:04:23] people remember what I said God is a god
[1:04:26] of
[1:04:28] variety as nature and just nature itself
[1:04:30] teaches you that you see there's oak
[1:04:33] trees and and there was so pretty
[1:04:35] there's
[1:04:36] oos and then there's these little
[1:04:38] flowers forming on the end of them just
[1:04:41] beautiful variety of of of nature that's
[1:04:45] what God wants but when we start looking
[1:04:48] back then we want everyone to be a clone
[1:04:51] of
[1:04:52] ourselves we want everyone to look the
[1:04:55] same and that's the spirit that this
[1:04:57] Amish Church started and I know nobody
[1:04:59] talks bad about the Amish people because
[1:05:00] they're so sweet and conservative and
[1:05:02] all
[1:05:04] this I hate to say this but they're not
[1:05:07] a
[1:05:08] threat there's no Amish
[1:05:11] converts they just make more Amish is
[1:05:15] what they
[1:05:16] do uh
[1:05:18] naturally but there's there's there's
[1:05:21] not there's not a nobody wants to be
[1:05:25] omish
[1:05:26] and it's because what do they have to
[1:05:28] offer they're Looking Backward yes
[1:05:32] they're more moral I I see that in
[1:05:34] certain things but they've isolated
[1:05:36] themselves so much that the part that
[1:05:39] Jesus said that go into all the world
[1:05:42] and make disciples there is none of that
[1:05:46] because it's
[1:05:48] dead because they've organized and
[1:05:51] they've made everyone to look the same
[1:05:55] so I was talking with a friend of mine a
[1:05:58] few years ago Amish
[1:06:00] guy
[1:06:02] and he was
[1:06:06] uh he was telling me we were talking
[1:06:08] about religion which we we enjoyed doing
[1:06:10] and he was telling me that he said
[1:06:13] that the Amish they're not a
[1:06:16] denomination he said that the Amish is a
[1:06:19] way of
[1:06:20] life and I just I didn't I didn't it
[1:06:24] didn't set well with me and I said I
[1:06:26] said well I said I I disagree I think it
[1:06:29] is a denomination I think I think you
[1:06:31] are a sectarian group with certain
[1:06:33] beliefs that you go back to the that you
[1:06:36] are getting from your group that don't
[1:06:39] necessarily go with the Bible and he's
[1:06:40] like no he says this is our we choose
[1:06:42] this way of living we like this way of
[1:06:43] living and I said answer this question
[1:06:45] for me I said if one of the boys in your
[1:06:50] um Community if he came out with a
[1:06:53] baseball cap rather than a straw hat I
[1:06:56] said what would you
[1:06:58] do and he said well we were
[1:07:01] corrected and I said correct
[1:07:04] what and he says well the Amish way is
[1:07:06] to wear a hat and I said when you were
[1:07:09] correcting him would you invoke the name
[1:07:10] of
[1:07:12] God and he said well yeah I said no
[1:07:16] brother I said you are you're very much
[1:07:19] a denomination like the Catholic or the
[1:07:21] Baptist or whatever it is it's not just
[1:07:23] a way of life it is your religion
[1:07:28] and he and I told him I said do you
[1:07:31] think that wearing those clothes and I
[1:07:33] always admired the Amish I I like their
[1:07:36] way and I like their their um dedication
[1:07:39] to their
[1:07:41] faith but I don't think wearing a straw
[1:07:44] hat instead of a baseball cap makes you
[1:07:46] more of a Believer it has nothing to do
[1:07:48] with Holiness it's just wearing black
[1:07:50] clothes and a black
[1:07:52] hat m is not brushing your teeth
[1:07:56] not having electricity doesn't make you
[1:07:59] more
[1:08:00] holy it's a relationship with God that
[1:08:04] makes you more holy Holiness is very
[1:08:08] important but Holiness comes from a
[1:08:12] relationship with
[1:08:17] Christ I think I also told him I said I
[1:08:20] said brother I said if if what you're
[1:08:22] saying is true and and he was what he
[1:08:24] what they're doing is they trying to go
[1:08:26] back to the 15 and 1600s and they're
[1:08:29] trying to dress like that like I said
[1:08:31] they're trying to go back and trying to
[1:08:32] create this this community that was
[1:08:37] hundreds and hundreds of years ago and I
[1:08:39] said brother I said if you want to do it
[1:08:41] right you need to go all the way back to
[1:08:43] the Garden of Eden and wear animal skins
[1:08:46] like God himself made for his
[1:08:50] people I said the the blue shirt and the
[1:08:54] the Hat that's that's that's modern as
[1:08:57] far as as time
[1:09:00] goes
[1:09:03] well the most important thing brothers
[1:09:05] and sisters is to receive that Holy
[1:09:07] Spirit and then he will tell you he will
[1:09:11] show you things to wear not look back
[1:09:15] and try to create a group of people that
[1:09:20] all look the
[1:09:21] same that doesn't
[1:09:24] work he'll show you what to wear I hear
[1:09:26] preachers preaching against
[1:09:28] television all the time in a length of a
[1:09:30] of of the women's sleeves and the
[1:09:32] women's dress and
[1:09:34] and talking about something that was 50
[1:09:37] or 60 years ago and now we have social
[1:09:42] media that destroys people that has
[1:09:46] destroyed a whole generation of people
[1:09:49] people constantly looking on this thing
[1:09:52] and doing
[1:09:53] this all day day long time that would
[1:09:57] have been spent with their families or
[1:09:59] spent reading their Bibles or spent
[1:10:01] praying and we don't say that because
[1:10:05] we're stuck 50 60 70 years ago about a
[1:10:09] dumb
[1:10:11] television there's so much worse today
[1:10:14] and that's what needs to be preached but
[1:10:16] if we're trying to create a community
[1:10:18] like the Amish then we ignore what's
[1:10:20] going on
[1:10:23] wow that time was once spent in in
[1:10:25] prayer now it's on Tik Tok and YouTube
[1:10:27] and
[1:10:28] Facebook they say I only I only look at
[1:10:30] religious stuff first of all it's not
[1:10:35] true but second you're being influenced
[1:10:38] by a spirit who put that what you're
[1:10:40] watching to together you don't know who
[1:10:42] did that and it's getting your mind off
[1:10:45] of the word and onto something that you
[1:10:47] have no idea where it came
[1:10:49] from brother brandham said and and I'm
[1:10:52] not I understand brother brandham said
[1:10:55] that television could be used for the
[1:10:58] Lord I feel the same about social
[1:11:01] media it could be but it's
[1:11:05] not and again we're trying to create a
[1:11:07] world preaching against things that just
[1:11:09] don't have relevance
[1:11:12] today there are things that do have
[1:11:15] relevance you know I I there's a sect of
[1:11:19] people that they won't darken the door
[1:11:20] of a church because they don't play a
[1:11:23] tape yet they'll spend hours on a day
[1:11:25] surfing on their
[1:11:26] phones their kids are hooked up to
[1:11:28] pornography and spending countless times
[1:11:30] on social social media out driving
[1:11:33] around streaming a sermon rather than
[1:11:35] making the effort to come to church
[1:11:37] creating a generation brother I'm not
[1:11:40] not just talking about this I'm talking
[1:11:41] about the whole world that can't focus
[1:11:44] that needs constant entertainment and
[1:11:46] and constantly a constantly feed of
[1:11:48] dopamine and and on their post and see
[1:11:50] how many how many likes they get and how
[1:11:52] many views they
[1:11:53] get I know people that won't and you do
[1:11:56] too that won't go to a church function
[1:11:59] because it's too worldly yet they'll put
[1:12:00] their kids in the
[1:12:02] University have you ever been on a
[1:12:04] University
[1:12:07] campus but they'll refuse to go to a
[1:12:09] church
[1:12:11] function because they're not dressed
[1:12:15] right walk around Park
[1:12:18] Avenue where you put your kids in school
[1:12:20] I'm not saying going to school is wrong
[1:12:22] don't don't get me don't get me wrong
[1:12:24] there but I'm saying come on you're
[1:12:26] trying to live in a day that's gone past
[1:12:30] and there is much more today that's
[1:12:33] against us that's fighting us and we
[1:12:35] need to be aware of these things and
[1:12:37] we're still preaching about dress and
[1:12:39] televisions it's
[1:12:42] ridiculous every Revival starts with
[1:12:45] people getting away from looking behind
[1:12:47] them and turning their eyes back to this
[1:12:51] book and then seeing the word manifest
[1:12:54] itself in their
[1:12:56] day if they get this living water of
[1:12:59] Jesus Christ they'll know how to
[1:13:01] dress if they get this living water of
[1:13:05] Jesus Christ they'll know how to
[1:13:08] talk they'll know what to
[1:13:10] study they'll know what to put their
[1:13:14] time and effort
[1:13:15] into they'll know if they can just get
[1:13:18] to
[1:13:19] Christ but instead we condemn them from
[1:13:21] wearing a baseball cap instead of a
[1:13:23] straw hat
[1:13:25] we don't
[1:13:27] but it's just the
[1:13:29] same and it doesn't do any good never
[1:13:33] has done any good
[1:13:35] Holiness is important but it is not what
[1:13:39] defines
[1:13:41] you what defines us should be the Living
[1:13:44] Water of the holy spirit being poured
[1:13:47] out from
[1:13:48] us to the world and then watching Life
[1:13:52] Spring up that is what
[1:13:56] should Define us as a body of Christians
[1:14:01] of genuine
[1:14:06] Believers let's go to um Isaiah chapter
[1:14:11] 43 Verse
[1:14:14] 15 I am the Lord your Holy One the
[1:14:18] creator of Israel your king thus saeth
[1:14:21] the Lord which maketh a way in the sea
[1:14:23] and a path in the mighty Waters which
[1:14:25] bringeth forth The Chariot and the horse
[1:14:27] the Army and the power they shall lie
[1:14:29] down together they shall not rise they
[1:14:31] are extinct they are quenched as a toe
[1:14:34] remember ye not the former things
[1:14:39] consider the things of old neither
[1:14:41] consider the things of old but I will do
[1:14:43] a new
[1:14:46] thing now it shall spring
[1:14:49] forth shall you not know
[1:14:52] it I will even make a way in the
[1:14:55] wilderness and rivers in the
[1:14:59] desert God's warning the people don't
[1:15:02] get stuck in a Time past remember those
[1:15:06] things but if you try to live in a past
[1:15:10] time it's going to introduce
[1:15:12] sin it will bring sin into your life
[1:15:15] it'll bring sin into your
[1:15:17] family if you're trying to live in an
[1:15:20] age that's not here it'll throw out
[1:15:23] holiness
[1:15:27] that's why the Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:15:28] They didn't accept Jesus because he
[1:15:30] didn't come in the way that they thought
[1:15:31] he
[1:15:34] should but are we brothers and sisters
[1:15:37] am I
[1:15:39] satisfied with my religion like the
[1:15:43] yashar are we satisfied with Looking
[1:15:46] Backward to the Mighty Warriors of faith
[1:15:48] that were before us or do we want those
[1:15:50] rivers of water to flow from us so that
[1:15:53] others can come and drink what what what
[1:15:55] is it are we
[1:15:57] satisfied am I satisfied with my walk
[1:15:59] with the
[1:16:02] Lord I'm
[1:16:04] not I'm going to
[1:16:06] read a testimony from a brother who
[1:16:09] wasn't
[1:16:11] either we know him as the Apostle Paul
[1:16:15] Philippians chapter 3:1 says
[1:16:17] this if by any means I might attain unto
[1:16:20] the resurrection of the Dead not as
[1:16:23] though I had already attained
[1:16:26] either we're made
[1:16:28] perfect but I follow after if that I may
[1:16:32] apprehend that which also I am
[1:16:34] apprehended of Jesus Christ the English
[1:16:35] Standard Version says this not that I
[1:16:37] have already obtained this or am already
[1:16:41] perfect but I press on to make it my own
[1:16:45] because Jesus Christ has made me his
[1:16:49] own amen Brethren I count not myself to
[1:16:54] have app HED I'm not saying that I have
[1:16:56] it yet this is the Apostle Paul
[1:16:59] speaking but this one thing I do
[1:17:02] forgetting those things which are
[1:17:05] behind it could be past
[1:17:08] sins brothers and sisters it could be
[1:17:11] things that we've done wrong it could be
[1:17:13] mistakes that we've made I wish I would
[1:17:14] have done this I wish I wish that that I
[1:17:17] just would have gone this direction
[1:17:18] instead of that
[1:17:20] direction and also trying to create a
[1:17:22] world from a hundred years ago
[1:17:25] forget those things which are behind and
[1:17:27] reach forth unto those things which are
[1:17:29] before Paul is saying that he is
[1:17:31] straining forward to what lies ahead and
[1:17:34] he's not looking at things that are in
[1:17:36] the
[1:17:38] past I press towards the mark for the
[1:17:41] prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:17:43] Christ
[1:17:44] Jesus let us therefore as many as be
[1:17:47] perfect be thus minded and if anything
[1:17:49] be ye otherwise minded God shall reveal
[1:17:53] this unto you
[1:17:55] nevertheless where to we have already
[1:17:57] attained let us walk by the same Rule
[1:18:00] and let us mind the same thing I'll read
[1:18:03] those last two verses in the English
[1:18:04] Standard Version it says this let those
[1:18:06] of us who are mature think this way and
[1:18:09] if anything you and if anything you
[1:18:12] think otherwise God will reveal that
[1:18:14] also to you only let us hold true that
[1:18:17] that which we have attained he's saying
[1:18:20] to keep pressing forward and asking God
[1:18:22] for more but don't throw away all the
[1:18:23] progress that you've already made
[1:18:25] either build upon it but don't stop and
[1:18:29] look back hoping for things that are in
[1:18:31] the past those things are in the
[1:18:35] past and let All Things become new Jesus
[1:18:40] said he said God is the god of the
[1:18:45] living he's not the god of the
[1:18:48] dead and that's the whole thing with God
[1:18:50] he's alive and he's moving and
[1:18:52] everything is new and fresh and that's
[1:18:55] the way that our gospel should be that's
[1:18:57] the way the pulpit should be everything
[1:18:59] should be
[1:19:00] new fresh but taken from the Eternal
[1:19:06] Word it's this isn't old this is
[1:19:09] eternal it's always true but more and
[1:19:14] more things are revealed to us every day
[1:19:19] and new things apply to our lives
[1:19:25] brother brandom
[1:19:27] [Music]
[1:19:28] came
[1:19:35] and he
[1:19:37] started a wonderful thing there was a
[1:19:40] great Revival that happened in the 40s
[1:19:43] and 50s and 60s changed the world and we
[1:19:46] see people that came from that
[1:19:49] Revival we see all these charismatic
[1:19:51] ministers and you know what they did
[1:19:53] they tried to be him
[1:19:56] they started doing the
[1:19:58] discernment wrong
[1:20:01] sometimes when people would come he
[1:20:04] preached in this very church when people
[1:20:07] would come before him it was always
[1:20:10] perfect he said your name is this you've
[1:20:13] done this go and be healed in the name
[1:20:16] of Jesus there's so many of us here that
[1:20:18] are related to people that received
[1:20:19] their healing that received their
[1:20:21] salvation through that gift but then
[1:20:23] other people went and they tried to copy
[1:20:26] it they tried to live in another age and
[1:20:30] we see it today and there are many many
[1:20:32] deceivers out there trying to do the
[1:20:33] same thing you can watch them not on
[1:20:36] television but you can watch them on
[1:20:41] YouTube and
[1:20:43] it's it's an
[1:20:45] impersonation trying to live in a Time
[1:20:48] past that gift of discernment is there
[1:20:52] it's always been there it was there with
[1:20:53] Peter with Anan and saf it was there
[1:20:56] with
[1:20:58] um Elijah or
[1:21:00] Elisha um when uh gesia the servant took
[1:21:06] the garments from the U the one that was
[1:21:09] healed in the Jordan River it's there
[1:21:13] and it operates I've seen it I've seen
[1:21:15] it in my own Ministry it's not my gift
[1:21:18] it's not the thing that I do but I've
[1:21:19] seen it operate even in me I'm not
[1:21:21] saying that it's not right I'm saying
[1:21:23] that it's there but so people they try
[1:21:25] to copy it and they'll say things like
[1:21:28] oh there's somebody here that has a back
[1:21:30] problem you're really
[1:21:32] suffering
[1:21:34] sister it's like
[1:21:37] yeah it's easy to
[1:21:40] do but the specifics the
[1:21:44] names the exact things the doctor said
[1:21:47] the
[1:21:48] addresses those things are are not
[1:21:50] imperson that you can't impersonate them
[1:21:52] it happened but we don't want to go back
[1:21:54] and try to recreate that let the gift
[1:21:59] let the Lord
[1:22:01] operate and like I said if we if we try
[1:22:04] to live in a different hour brothers and
[1:22:08] sisters it'll bring sin I
[1:22:12] remember bowling alleys you know they
[1:22:14] were
[1:22:15] taboo when I was a kid because because
[1:22:18] I'd heard on on some of the sermons that
[1:22:22] that these things were wrong so I would
[1:22:24] never darken the door of a bowling
[1:22:26] bowling
[1:22:27] alley but I want I'd go to the
[1:22:31] clubs that's how you start
[1:22:34] thinking that's the that's the rule of
[1:22:37] thought when you start doing that
[1:22:39] doesn't make sense and with the Amish it
[1:22:43] didn't make
[1:22:44] sense and what it does is it brings in
[1:22:48] sin when we try to create a world that's
[1:22:52] behind us and I'm not saying don't
[1:22:56] please don't say that I'm saying saying
[1:22:58] anything about Holiness it will produce
[1:23:01] more Holiness yes the holy spirit in you
[1:23:04] will produce a better person than an
[1:23:07] Amish person that tries to live 400
[1:23:09] years
[1:23:10] ago you will be because you are free you
[1:23:14] are open to whatever the Lord wants for
[1:23:16] you to
[1:23:17] do and then the musicians can come and
[1:23:23] then Brothers and sisters what Jesus
[1:23:26] said that that great promise that he
[1:23:29] made out of
[1:23:31] you will flow rivers of Living
[1:23:36] Water I look and is it flowing from
[1:23:41] us think about you personally are these
[1:23:46] rivers of Living Water are they flowing
[1:23:49] from
[1:23:52] you I can't Define it I don't know
[1:23:55] exactly what it means and neither does
[1:23:57] anyone else but it is I do know what it
[1:24:01] means it's the Holy Spirit operating in
[1:24:04] The
[1:24:07] Believer and others come to
[1:24:11] drink others come to be delivered others
[1:24:14] come to be healed others come to be
[1:24:17] comforted others come to drink of that
[1:24:20] water is it happening it needs to happen
[1:24:24] imagine the spirit of God coming down
[1:24:27] and dwelling into a in a person and that
[1:24:30] same Jesus Christ that we read about so
[1:24:32] much that same Jesus Christ operating in
[1:24:35] the people like it did in the book of
[1:24:39] Acts those things that is God's nature
[1:24:42] that's how he
[1:24:46] operates I talk about the times change
[1:24:48] God doesn't change his nature stays the
[1:24:52] same He Is A Healer he is a comforter he
[1:24:56] is a deliverer he always has been and he
[1:24:59] always will
[1:25:00] be and he uses his people to do
[1:25:04] it now are there rivers of Living Water
[1:25:07] and brothers and sisters we need to seek
[1:25:10] that is there something within me that
[1:25:13] wants to be closer to God is there
[1:25:15] something within me Lord if I could just
[1:25:16] talk to
[1:25:17] you if I could just know your will Lord
[1:25:20] if I could just know your will for my
[1:25:22] life help me
[1:25:26] and it's not wear about wearing a
[1:25:27] baseball cap or a straw
[1:25:30] hat it's about receiving the very Spirit
[1:25:34] of Christ into our lives and not
[1:25:39] brothers and sisters not looking back to
[1:25:42] a day that's gone and trying to mimic
[1:25:46] it whether it be Amish or whether it be
[1:25:49] us or whether it be whatever it
[1:25:52] is don't try to recreate that world in
[1:25:57] your
[1:25:59] life go to Christ and let his Holiness
[1:26:03] just flow through you then you will love
[1:26:07] God then you will be that Fountain
[1:26:10] that's flowing forth that that people
[1:26:13] come to water brother
