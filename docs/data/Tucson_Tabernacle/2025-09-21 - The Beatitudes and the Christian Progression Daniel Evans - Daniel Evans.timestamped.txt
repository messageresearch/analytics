[14:57] Oh, the battle is over.
[15:02] Victory is one.
[15:06] It's already done.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; You may be seated for a moment. There'll
[15:14] be a reason for that.
[15:17] How many know it's already done?
[15:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "It is finished." Yes.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; And it was finished.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Now, it's just us to accept it and
[15:28] believe it. So, I'm just going to ask
[15:29] you something. If you know God has
[15:31] healed you and you've had an experience
[15:34] with God, that all I can say that was
[15:37] God, I want you to stand up
[15:43] and you know it was God in your life.
[15:46] That's pretty well all of you.
[15:49] If there's some of you that maybe I know
[15:50] some of you can't sin but have never
[15:53] look around and see God is more than
[15:56] able and it's already done.
[16:03] You might say, "But I still feel this."
[16:08] Not only did he save you, he made you
[16:10] well.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you wonder if you're saved.
[16:15] If I was saved, I wouldn't act like
[16:17] that. I wouldn't do that. No, it's
[16:20] already done.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; All he asks you is to believe it and to
[16:25] confess it.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; I am healed. I am saved. I am well. I'm
[16:31] one of his.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; That's all my
[16:35] We have a few requests here. Our brother
[16:39] Paul Murray has sent in a request
[16:41] saying,
[16:42] "Brother Rome, he had gone to Ohio to
[16:45] for his sister's funeral. He's supposed
[16:47] to fly home Tuesday but is now fighting
[16:50] some sickness. So let's remember brother
[16:52] Roma
[16:55] and then sister Amelia says please pray
[16:58] for heaven myself. I've been going
[17:01] through um oppression and Eva has been
[17:07] having some anxiety attacks.
[17:10] The results of my bone density test show
[17:14] that I'm
[17:17] let's see
[17:20] I'm at risk for fractures.
[17:24] But Sister Amelia, it's already done.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; He's your healer.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; That's what we testify.
[17:34] Sister Becca Benzes.
[17:36] I had um
[17:40] surgery a couple of weeks ago. I'm still
[17:43] dealing with a lot of inflammation,
[17:47] tender tenderness. Uh having uh tooth
[17:50] pain is is getting me down. So please
[17:54] pray for the
[17:56] se serious infection in my foot. Amen.
[18:01] He suffered in every manner and way.
[18:04] His body was unrecognizable after he
[18:07] took
[18:09] every every sickness, every pain, every
[18:12] hurt.
[18:13] He didn't say, "Oops, I forgot that
[18:15] one." No, he met it all.
[18:20] From Sister Briquest, she says,
[18:25] "And she would like to be remembered in
[18:27] prayer.
[18:29] She has been having tests done
[18:32] and uh and had a biopsy done. She is
[18:36] trusting of the Lord that all is well.
[18:41] And that's our confession. We also had
[18:43] in a request turn in
[18:48] from brother Jordan. He says um a a
[18:52] prayer request for brother Peter Cam. He
[18:54] has serious need for healing in the
[18:56] body.
[18:58] and he says he uh received a call from
[19:00] Sister Barbara Surmers from Troy, Ohio,
[19:04] and she is a church on behalf of Brother
[19:06] Mike Twist, the pastor. Some of you may
[19:08] remember their church visiting here
[19:10] about 20 years ago with their choir.
[19:16] This brother is from their church. He
[19:18] now lives in Tucson for the climate
[19:22] for health reasons, but is going through
[19:24] some pretty bad something pretty bad. He
[19:27] said, "Brother Mike was asking if one of
[19:29] us or some of us could go and pray for
[19:31] him, but we'll we'll start right here
[19:33] for him
[19:34] &gt;&gt; and for every heart." So
[19:38] pray with the understanding that it's
[19:41] already done.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Not begging him to do it, not pleading
[19:46] him to do it, but Lord, I'm taking you
[19:48] at your word. That's what pleases him.
[19:51] Let's bow our heads. Lord, we we begin
[19:54] to look at ourselves sometimes and we
[19:56] find ourselves, I'm so unworthy. I'm so
[19:59] But there's nothing in the in the
[20:00] scriptures that says you have to be
[20:02] worthy of healing, of salvation. No,
[20:04] it's already done.
[20:07] But you ask us just to thank you and
[20:09] praise you and give testimony of what
[20:11] you've done, Lord. And you've already
[20:14] saved. You've already made well. You've
[20:16] already cleaned. You've already
[20:17] forgiven. It's already done. When you
[20:19] cried, "It is finished." And today we
[20:22] accept it. We believe it. And we praise
[20:24] you for it, Lord. Lord. And as they take
[20:27] up the offering, Lord, let us be
[20:28] cheerful givers, Lord. And may it be to
[20:31] use for your honor and glory in Jesus
[20:34] Christ's name. Amen.
[20:41] You can all have your seats.
[20:44] He came to me in key of B flat.
[20:55] This is a special song to me.
[20:58] Was one of my former pastor's favorite
[21:00] songs. Let's sing it this morning. Sing
[21:04] it like it was. Sing it about that event
[21:08] in your life that he came to me when I
[21:13] couldn't come to him.
[21:15] I couldn't I couldn't make it to God,
[21:17] but he came to me.
[21:20] Oh. Oh, he came
[21:26] in B flat. He came to me.
[21:35] He came

[30:53] Sister Lily, if you could keep playing,
[30:55] let's turn in our Bibles to Matthew
[30:57] chapter 5. While I still have you
[31:00] standing and we'll read the biatitudes.
[31:02] Matthew 5 1-12.
[31:17] It's beautiful that this song is playing
[31:22] in the background as we read the
[31:24] scriptures. Matthew 5 verse one
[31:32] speaking of our Lord Jesus.
[31:35] And seeing the multitudes, he went up
[31:36] into a mountain.
[31:38] And when he was set, his disciples came
[31:41] unto him, and he opened his mouth and
[31:45] taught them, saying, "Blessed are the
[31:47] poor in spirit, for theirs is the
[31:50] kingdom of heaven.
[31:53] Blessed are they that mourn, for they
[31:55] shall be comforted.
[31:57] Blessed are the meek, for they shall
[31:58] inherit the earth.
[32:01] Blessed are they which do hunger and
[32:03] thirst after righteousness, for they
[32:05] shall be filled.
[32:07] Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
[32:10] obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in
[32:13] heart, for they shall see God. Blessed
[32:16] are the peacemakers, for they shall be
[32:18] called the children of God. Blessed are
[32:21] they which are persecuted for
[32:22] righteousness the sna's sake for theirs
[32:25] is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are
[32:27] you when men shall revile you and
[32:29] persecute you and shall say all manner
[32:31] of evil against you falsely for mine for
[32:34] my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad
[32:37] for great is your reward in heaven. For
[32:40] so persecuted they the prophets which
[32:42] were before you. Amen. Beautiful words.
[32:45] You can be seated. Thank you.
[32:51] Brother Josiah when he sang that song
[32:53] and I assume that you were talking about
[32:56] brother Biscll
[32:58] and uh as I sent out on the messages
[33:01] that brother Ed Biscll passed away a
[33:05] wonderful man and a great warrior of the
[33:08] faith. And all that I have known from Ed
[33:13] Bisll has been that that he was a
[33:15] gentleman.
[33:17] He loved the Lord and um he uh it was it
[33:21] was expected. Brother Eisll was well
[33:24] stricken in in years and it's nice that
[33:27] that he is now with the one that he
[33:31] served his whole life and there are many
[33:33] missing today. There's quite a few
[33:35] missing and um
[33:37] quite a few told me that they're going
[33:39] up to Charlie Kirk's
[33:42] memorial service up in Phoenix. So pray
[33:46] that hand of God would be upon each one
[33:48] upon those services up there.
[33:52] Uh for review, uh I I ministered last
[33:55] week to try to lay a foundation on this
[34:00] great sermon called the sermon on the
[34:03] mount. Jesus
[34:06] had there was a time of silence in his
[34:09] life from 12 years old to about 30 years
[34:11] old.
[34:13] And Jesus
[34:16] the the story picks up in the gospels
[34:18] and Jesus was baptized by John and he
[34:22] went into the wilderness to be tempted
[34:25] of Satan. He was led into the wilderness
[34:28] to be tempted of Satan. Now, now Jesus
[34:31] had already been through the teenage
[34:32] years. He'd already been through
[34:34] adolescence. He's already been through
[34:36] really what is most of the time the
[34:38] hardest time in a human being's walk
[34:41] with the Lord is that time from about 13
[34:45] up until you're probably into your late
[34:48] teens and time that until you get
[34:51] married or that time is when it's
[34:55] it's a time of temptation. Now
[34:58] temptation never stops. It's it's for
[35:00] our whole lives. But that is when it
[35:04] seems like the enemy steps into
[35:06] someone's life and really wants to
[35:08] destroy them. And they can make mistakes
[35:10] when you're young that will be with you
[35:12] for the rest of your life. And this
[35:14] Jesus Christ, he wasn't called the
[35:17] Christ back then. He was he was just
[35:20] Jesus, the the son of um this carpenter.
[35:24] And he went through this adolescent
[35:27] years. He went through his teen years.
[35:28] He went through his 20s.
[35:30] And he never sinned. He was tempted in
[35:34] every manner of sin as we are, but yet
[35:38] he never fell to sin.
[35:42] And he went into the wilderness. So that
[35:45] was he needed to be tempted a little bit
[35:46] higher. So he went into the wilderness.
[35:48] He fasted for 40 days. He was weak. And
[35:51] then he met Satan himself. And in what
[35:53] form, we don't know. But Satan tempted
[35:56] him even beyond what he was tempted
[35:59] before. And yet Jesus overcame. Then
[36:02] Jesus came out of the wilderness
[36:07] and he started preaching.
[36:10] And he started preaching repent
[36:13] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[36:17] And then
[36:20] his really his ministry started. And his
[36:23] ministry has affected all of us here.
[36:25] Whether you're a Christian or not, the
[36:27] ministry of Jesus Christ has affected
[36:29] you. I was talking with Sister Shirley
[36:32] before service
[36:36] and we were talking I was telling Sister
[36:39] Shirley that our lives
[36:42] our personal lives they really don't
[36:45] mean anything.
[36:47] just serving ourselves and how how
[36:50] successful we are in life. Whatever we
[36:53] heap for ourselves as far as as money or
[36:56] as far as a legacy or any of that, it
[36:59] really doesn't matter. Our lives really
[37:01] are meaningless. But yet what we do in
[37:04] our lives are so meaningful.
[37:08] Meaningful without measure. What we do
[37:11] with the lives that God has given us. I
[37:14] look back at Justin there. baptized him
[37:16] last week and and the testimony that you
[37:18] gave about how the Lord has been dealing
[37:20] with you and how you how you've just
[37:22] really fell in love it seems like with
[37:24] the word of God and Justin told me we
[37:28] went out to lunch after service told me
[37:30] he says he says brother he says I want
[37:33] to go back and I want to lead my family
[37:36] to the Lord
[37:38] and I thought that's a Christian
[37:41] that's what happens in a Christian's
[37:43] life is You feel you get this
[37:46] repentance. You get this this change in
[37:49] life and now you don't want to hold it
[37:50] to yourself. Now you want to go and give
[37:52] it to someone else. You want to see your
[37:54] loved ones. You want to see other people
[37:56] have the same joy that you have. And
[37:58] that is it's perfect of what happens to
[38:01] a Christian. And here is Jesus. He come
[38:04] out of the wilderness and he he starts
[38:07] preaching repent
[38:09] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. He
[38:11] starts preaching Christianity. He starts
[38:14] preaching how you need to give your life
[38:16] over to God and you need to stop serving
[38:19] yourself. And then
[38:23] he goes and he preaches this masterpiece
[38:26] called the sermon on the mount. The
[38:27] first recorded sermon we have.
[38:30] But so often you might hear from the
[38:33] pulpit, you just need to you need to
[38:35] give your heart to the Lord. Or you
[38:38] might hear from your parents or you
[38:39] might hear from your friends. You might
[38:40] say, you might hear people say, well,
[38:42] you need to become a Christian. You need
[38:44] to give your heart to the Lord. But the
[38:45] question that that is so often, it's
[38:47] like, how do I do it? Well, what do I
[38:50] do?
[38:52] And it's kind of a hard question to
[38:54] answer.
[38:56] Well, you just surrender your life to
[38:57] him. Well, how do I surrender my life to
[38:59] him? It's a good question to ask. And
[39:02] can you answer that? If you were
[39:05] witnessing to someone and trying to lead
[39:07] someone to the Lord and they said,
[39:08] "Well, how do I do it?" Would you know
[39:10] the answer to give?
[39:13] Jesus starts his ministry.
[39:15] The very first things we have recorded
[39:18] from Jesus Christ. He tells us how to do
[39:21] it.
[39:22] We we call them the biatitudes. The
[39:24] biatitudes means the blessings.
[39:27] Jesus starts the whole ministry, the
[39:30] whole thing. He starts telling us how to
[39:34] become a believer.
[39:36] Beautiful. Wonderful. He lays a
[39:39] foundation and it becomes it goes into
[39:42] as I said before the greatest sermon
[39:45] that has ever come out of the mouth of a
[39:48] human being from that time to from from
[39:50] the beginning of time to that time and
[39:52] to this time. There has never been such
[39:55] beautiful words come out of the mouth of
[39:58] a human being
[40:00] in my opinion as this sermon on the
[40:02] mount.
[40:04] I mean, tremendous,
[40:07] tremendous things, saying things that
[40:09] people had never heard before. And we
[40:13] are getting into this series and we are
[40:15] going to go through, we're going to read
[40:17] every word that he said in this
[40:21] masterpiece called the sermon on the
[40:23] mountain. And it starts with the
[40:26] biatitudes.
[40:27] He goes up. I'm sure brother Lyall has
[40:29] been there many times. I've been there
[40:31] where Jesus preached this sermon. We we
[40:33] think sermon on the mountain. We're live
[40:35] in Arizona and we have big mountains. It
[40:37] was more of a hill. Am I right, brother
[40:39] brother Lyall? It wasn't really a
[40:40] mountain. It was just it was a place
[40:42] that people could sit down and Jesus was
[40:44] up in a higher place. And he starts with
[40:48] these words and I love the way it says
[40:50] and he opened his mouth.
[40:53] Of course you open your mouth. We all
[40:55] open our mouth when we talk. It just
[40:57] it's kind of what you do. But with
[41:01] Jesus, I really believe he was so
[41:04] surrendered to God, he just opened his
[41:06] mouth and it just came out.
[41:08] Just the words of the father just flowed
[41:11] right through him. So let's go through
[41:14] what he said in this masterpiece
[41:18] called
[41:20] the sermon on the mount. It starts with
[41:21] the biatitudes. And as I said before,
[41:23] the the biatitudes really just means it
[41:26] means the blessings.
[41:28] The first several biatitudes deal with
[41:30] the condition of the heart.
[41:32] And then the second part pertains to a
[41:35] relationship with God.
[41:37] And then the final grouping is how we
[41:40] apply these blessings to others.
[41:44] Matthew chapter 5, we'll go back to what
[41:47] I just read. Matthew chapter 5 verse
[41:50] one. And seeing the multitudes, he went
[41:53] up into a mountain. And he was when he
[41:56] was set when he sat down his disciples
[41:59] came to him and he opened his mouth and
[42:02] he taught them saying
[42:06] remember this is the first Christian
[42:08] sermon that we have recorded and this is
[42:12] going to tell us how a Christian becomes
[42:14] a Christian. We're going to go through
[42:16] line by line and you're going to be
[42:18] blessed. It's beautiful. Remember in
[42:22] your Bibles it's in red. the words in
[42:25] red. Jesus is special. He gets his own
[42:28] color
[42:29] and it just happens to be blood red.
[42:33] And it's so when you open your Bible for
[42:36] for you young people and you need new
[42:37] people, when you open up when you open
[42:39] up the book, if it's in red, it's none
[42:42] other than Jesus Christ speaking.
[42:47] and he opened his mouth and he taught
[42:49] them saying, "Blessed are the poor in
[42:51] spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
[42:54] heaven." Now, here's the foundation of
[42:56] becoming a Christian. Here's the
[42:58] foundation of becoming a believer. This
[43:01] word poor
[43:03] in the original Greek, it doesn't mean
[43:05] that you just don't have a lot of money,
[43:07] that maybe you can't make your bills,
[43:09] you can't maybe that uh that you don't
[43:12] have as much as you want. This word poor
[43:14] in the Greek, it doesn't mean that. It
[43:16] means that you are destitute.
[43:19] It means that you are without anything.
[43:23] It means that you are in a tough
[43:25] position. And it also means it means
[43:28] that you are destitute in your own
[43:30] spirit.
[43:31] Blessed are the destitute in spirit.
[43:35] We hear so often, remember this is the
[43:38] progression of a Christian. We hear
[43:39] people say, "Well, I'm a good person."
[43:43] No, you're not. I hate to break it to
[43:45] you.
[43:46] But you're not.
[43:49] People say, "Well, you know, I have a
[43:50] relationship with God and and I'm I'm
[43:52] I'm I'm good, you know, but I have some
[43:56] faults." The the fact is that there is
[43:58] none of us that are good. And to to
[44:01] become a Christian, to become a
[44:03] believer, you have to realize that
[44:05] you're not all that. In fact, you're
[44:07] nothing. That's the very first part that
[44:10] you have to have to understand that you
[44:12] can't do anything in yourself.
[44:15] You need to realize that you need
[44:18] saving.
[44:20] I said last week
[44:23] I said that, you know, we hear so much
[44:25] about the unpardonable sin. The Bible
[44:27] doesn't talk about an unpardonable sin,
[44:29] but we hear about an unpardonable sin.
[44:32] And I said last week, and I really I
[44:34] want to double down on that, that really
[44:37] the unpardonable sin is someone that
[44:42] will not repent of their sins. and will
[44:44] not ask for forgiveness.
[44:48] How can I forgive you if you don't ask
[44:50] me for forgiveness?
[44:52] So you you some people say it's suicide,
[44:56] some people say it's this, some people
[44:58] say it's that. But if you don't want
[45:00] forgiveness, if you are not truly
[45:02] willing to humble yourself be for to
[45:04] God, then how can you be forgiven?
[45:10] As I said, you hear I'm a good person.
[45:13] We're not. That's the foundation.
[45:16] There's a whole lot. There's a bunch
[45:17] more that we're going to get to, but
[45:19] that's the foundation is you have to
[45:20] realize you are not. You have to realize
[45:23] that you are a flawed human being that
[45:27] needs help.
[45:30] 1 Corinthians chapter 6.
[45:33] You can't do anything in yourself. 1
[45:35] Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9. It's it's
[45:38] just beautiful. I'm going to read the
[45:39] New King James when I we'll read the Old
[45:41] King James with the biatitudes and the
[45:42] New King James when I go to the when I
[45:44] go to the the side scriptures. 1
[45:46] Corinthians chapter 6:9 says this. The
[45:48] Apostle Paul speaking, he says, "Do you
[45:50] not know that the unrighteous will not
[45:52] inherit the kingdom of God?"
[45:55] "Do not be deceived. Neither
[45:57] fornicators, nor idolattors, nor
[45:58] adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor
[46:00] sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous,
[46:02] nor drunkers, nor revelers, nor
[46:04] extortioners will inherit the kingdom of
[46:06] of God.
[46:08] Now listen to this. Listen to this next
[46:12] sentence.
[46:13] As such were some of you,
[46:18] but you were washed, but you were
[46:21] sanctified, but you were justified in
[46:23] the name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit
[46:27] of our God.
[46:30] You needed
[46:32] help.
[46:34] Ephesians chapter 2 verse 12. Listen to
[46:36] this. This even goes a little further.
[46:39] This is beautiful. Ephesians 2:12 says
[46:42] this, "That at any that that at that
[46:45] time you were without Christ,
[46:49] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[46:51] Israel and strangers from the covenants
[46:53] of promise, having no hope, and without
[46:58] God in the world."
[47:00] Friends, this is the foundation. We have
[47:02] to realize that that is where we are at
[47:04] before we can become a believer.
[47:07] But now in Christ Jesus,
[47:10] you who were once far off have been
[47:13] brought near by the blood of Christ.
[47:18] So what is the condition that you must
[47:19] come to before you can even become a
[47:22] Christian?
[47:23] It can't be I'm a good person. You are
[47:25] not.
[47:27] And that's where legalism fails. You
[47:30] can't say I'm better than anyone else.
[47:32] It's it's you. It's not through your
[47:34] works. We have to understand how bad we
[47:37] are first. That's the first beatitude.
[47:39] That's the first step that Jesus is
[47:41] laying out here. And if there is no
[47:43] understanding of the need of remission
[47:46] of sins, then there cannot be a
[47:48] Christian.
[47:50] And Jesus is saying here, blessed are
[47:53] the destitute in spirit. Blessed are the
[47:55] poor in spirit.
[47:57] Verse number four, back to Matthew
[48:00] chapter 5.
[48:02] Verse number four, blessed are they that
[48:06] mourn, for they shall be comforted. I
[48:09] always thought this was like mourn for a
[48:11] loss. Mourn for a a lost loved one. I I
[48:15] always thought it was that and I would
[48:18] pick it out, you know, and sometimes I
[48:19] would read it during a funeral and and
[48:22] it is for that. But if you look at the
[48:25] context of this, that's not what the
[48:28] Lord Jesus is talking about. The
[48:31] Amplified Bible says, "Blessed are they
[48:33] that mourn over their sins and repent,
[48:37] for they will be comforted when the
[48:39] burden of sin is lifted."
[48:42] So this mourning is mourning over our
[48:45] past. It's mourning over our mistakes.
[48:47] It's mourning over the things that we've
[48:49] done to maybe ruin our careers or ruin
[48:52] us financially or ruin a relationship or
[48:55] cause embarrassment or cause problems
[48:58] that that grieved God. the the mistakes
[49:01] that we made. We mourn over those and we
[49:04] we say, "Lord, I'm sorry.
[49:07] Lord, I messed up. Lord, I sinned.
[49:10] Blessed are they that mourn on your
[49:13] knees. I was I was just on the on my
[49:16] knees in the back before I came out here
[49:20] mourning. Lord, I'm sorry
[49:23] because I did this and this and this
[49:25] wrong just very this this very morning.
[49:29] Lord, I'm sorry.
[49:31] I'm mourning my sins. Lord, forgive me.
[49:35] And that is part of this Christian
[49:39] progression.
[49:43] If you think that you're a good person
[49:45] to begin with, this is going to be a
[49:47] hard-fought battle with God for God to
[49:50] get to you. Verse number five, blessed
[49:54] are the meek,
[49:56] for they shall inherit the earth. What
[49:59] is meekness?
[50:02] It's humility.
[50:04] The New Living Translation said,
[50:05] "Blessed are those who are humble."
[50:09] The Amplified version. So, we're moving
[50:11] now. We realize how bad we are. And it
[50:14] produces humility in us. It produces a
[50:18] change. The amplified says, "Blessed are
[50:21] the gentle, the kind-hearted, the sweet
[50:23] spirited, the self-controlled." So once
[50:26] you realize that you have nothing in
[50:27] yourself and only God can fill that
[50:30] void, then blessed are the poor in
[50:33] spirit. Then you truly regret what you
[50:36] used to be. And friends, that's part of
[50:39] it.
[50:40] You feel bad for the sins that you've
[50:42] done. You feel bad for the things that
[50:44] you've done. That's part of being a
[50:45] Christian. You must go through that.
[50:49] Don't let it stay forever. Don't don't
[50:52] constantly dwell on your past sins. But
[50:55] there is a time to mourn.
[51:00] And then after you've done that, then
[51:03] you are humbled by these things and you
[51:06] realize that you're no better than
[51:07] anyone else.
[51:10] Romans chapter 12 says this, "For I say
[51:13] through the through the grace given to
[51:15] me to everyone who is among you, not to
[51:18] think of himself more highly than he
[51:20] ought to think,
[51:21] but to think soberly as God has dealt to
[51:24] each measure and measure of faith."
[51:29] The Apostle Paul is warning us, and I'm
[51:32] sure Paul read this sermon.
[51:34] You look at all the disciples, you look
[51:36] at all the apostles, you look at all of
[51:37] the New Testament, they are
[51:39] regurgitating what Jesus said.
[51:43] So you can you can
[51:47] stop and you can you you you're humbled
[51:50] and and you're you're you're saying,
[51:52] "Lord, I need a closer walk with you."
[51:56] And then you realize that the world
[51:59] actually isn't here to serve you.
[52:03] It's the other way around.
[52:06] You come into church and I hear people
[52:09] so often they say, you know, I want a
[52:11] church that
[52:14] that the people dress this way or I want
[52:16] a church that the the music is
[52:19] contemporary or I want a church that the
[52:21] music is traditional or I want a church
[52:24] that uh baptizes in this way or I want a
[52:27] church that the the people act in a
[52:30] certain way or some people say I want a
[52:31] big church. Other people say, "I want a
[52:33] little church. I want an intimate
[52:34] church." But what what we shouldn't be
[52:35] say we shouldn't be saying that. What we
[52:37] should be doing is we should be saying,
[52:39] "I want a church where I can serve.
[52:42] Not where everybody can serve me."
[52:45] &gt;&gt; You don't come to this church, friends.
[52:47] You will be served. But you don't come
[52:50] to church to get served.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; I I've said it before. People say, "I
[52:57] want I want a church that I can go to be
[52:59] fed."
[53:01] Go to a church where you can feed others
[53:03] and I promise you, you'll get fed. Go to
[53:06] a church where you can contribute. Go to
[53:08] a church where you can help.
[53:12] Then you realize you become more meek
[53:15] when you're willing to serve other
[53:17] people because now you're constantly
[53:20] thinking about yourself.
[53:24] What you were doing, you were con
[53:25] constantly thinking about yourself, but
[53:27] now you start to think about other
[53:29] people. And the same thing in a
[53:30] relationship. When you're in a
[53:32] relationship and you're constantly
[53:34] thinking about yourself in the
[53:35] relationship and how your spouse or your
[53:37] boyfriend or your girlfriend or brother
[53:38] or sister, whatever it is, how your how
[53:40] they have done you wrong. What you need
[53:42] to be thinking is how I can serve this
[53:44] other person better.
[53:47] That's the best way. And it be and it
[53:49] does it it produces a humility.
[53:54] And we see these, we always see these
[53:57] self-help books and and many ministers,
[54:00] many many churches will teach, well, you
[54:03] need to love yourself before you can
[54:05] love others. That's a lie. That's false.
[54:08] Love others first. Hate yourself. Don't
[54:10] worry about yourself. Love others. Well,
[54:15] I need to I need to serve myself first.
[54:18] I need to make myself happy before I can
[54:20] make someone else happy. No. You know
[54:22] what that does? It produces depression.
[54:24] It produces anxiety. It produces
[54:27] relationship problems. It produces
[54:29] problems in your life. And you will be
[54:31] depressed for your whole life when
[54:32] you're serving yourself. All of us know.
[54:35] All of us know people who are all about
[54:37] themselves. And we know that they are
[54:39] the most depressed
[54:41] problem people that you'll ever meet.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; And it's because they're thinking about
[54:45] themselves.
[54:46] But those dear people
[54:49] that are always thinking about the other
[54:51] person, you notice how happy they are.
[54:54] You notice how that that they just have
[54:57] a spirit that you want to be around,
[54:59] it's because that is a Christian spirit.
[55:03] That is that is what it is. And and when
[55:05] you say everyone else here, when you
[55:07] truly come in and say everyone else here
[55:09] in this building right now, Tucson
[55:10] Tabernacle, Sunday morning, everyone
[55:13] else here is more important than I am.
[55:16] If you really have that way of thinking,
[55:18] that's meekness.
[55:21] It's not saying, "Brother, I'm nothing.
[55:22] You know, I'm not important." No, no.
[55:24] That a lot of time, that's actually
[55:25] bragging. What you're trying to do is
[55:27] you're trying to pre you're trying to
[55:29] project a humility. That's that's not
[55:32] that's not right either. I'll tell so
[55:35] one of Daniel's friends got married a
[55:36] couple years ago and his brother was the
[55:39] best man and his brother was giving a
[55:42] speech and man the kid gave a really
[55:43] neat speech and and he was talking about
[55:46] how uh he was the one that was always
[55:49] taking risks and his brother that got
[55:51] married, you know, he was always the
[55:52] more mature one and and the speech was a
[55:56] little bit glorifying himself over his
[56:00] brother who was the groom and and and
[56:02] the uh The wedding was more about him,
[56:05] but the best man was
[56:08] basically kind of talking about himself
[56:11] and how oh his his brother has always
[56:13] been the immature one. And then he just
[56:15] at the end he just says, you know what,
[56:17] he says, I'm proud of my humbleness.
[56:23] We don't we're not proud of our
[56:24] humbleness.
[56:26] True humbleness, true humility is really
[56:30] lowering yourself to someone else and
[56:34] lowering yourself to below someone else.
[56:36] Brother Lyle and I had um had coffee the
[56:39] other day and he was telling me about a
[56:41] men's group that he used to be part of
[56:44] and they used to fellowship and they
[56:46] started coming together and they they
[56:48] just formed like a Bible study and it it
[56:51] what it did is is they got closer and as
[56:54] they got closer with each other it
[56:57] produced
[56:59] an accountability
[57:02] between these men. And as they were
[57:05] talking to each other and as they were
[57:06] fellowshipping and as they started to
[57:09] get each other's trust, then it led to
[57:13] starting to say, "You know what? I I
[57:16] have a problem with this."
[57:19] And then the other brothers
[57:21] would help that brother. And then this
[57:25] one would say, "You know what? I'm I'm
[57:26] struggling with this or I'm struggling
[57:27] with that." And it this humility that
[57:30] that fellowship produced brought these
[57:34] brothers down to the fact that they
[57:37] could confess their faults one to
[57:39] another as the Bible says. And then that
[57:42] allowed to pray one for another as the
[57:45] Bible says. And it produced really a
[57:50] close-knit group of brothers. And
[57:54] really, that's one of the main reasons
[57:56] that we are here as a church this
[57:59] morning. We come here, as I said, to
[58:01] serve other people. But there's also a
[58:03] meekness in our hearts that we know that
[58:06] there are things in our lives that need
[58:09] to change.
[58:11] So, we come to church and we want
[58:14] correction. Don't look at Don't We're
[58:16] not looking at everyone else. We want
[58:19] correction ourselves. And that is part
[58:21] of the Christian progression. Do you see
[58:25] this this morning? Do you see yourself
[58:27] when you came? It's like, Lord, I I want
[58:29] to I want correction. I want to repent.
[58:31] I want to be better. And that is this
[58:34] meekness. That is this humility that's
[58:37] it's speaking of here in the biatitudes.
[58:39] Verse number six,
[58:42] blessed are they
[58:45] which do hunger and thirst after
[58:46] righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[58:50] So we go through this these first steps.
[58:54] It's admitting you're wrong. It's it's
[58:56] humility. It's it's mourning over your
[59:00] past sins. And then it produces in your
[59:05] life, it produces this this hunger and
[59:10] thirst after God. There's many places
[59:12] like in the Psalms, it says as the deer
[59:17] as the deer thirsts
[59:19] for the waterbrook. And then there's
[59:21] other places it says that that they're
[59:24] hungering. Well, here Jesus says it's
[59:26] both. It's hunger and thirst. It's
[59:29] double the desire to be right. And they
[59:33] that hunger and thirst after
[59:35] righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[59:38] You hunger and thirst after what God
[59:42] wants you to be
[59:44] rather than what you are.
[59:48] Jesus makes this statement a little bit
[59:50] later in the in the sermon on the mount,
[59:52] which we'll get to in the in the coming
[59:54] weeks. He says, "Be ye perfect as your
[59:58] father which is in heaven is perfect."
[1:00:01] How can you be perfect?
[1:00:05] Right here, hunger and thirst after
[1:00:07] righteousness. How can we be righteous?
[1:00:11] It's saying, Jesus is saying that you
[1:00:15] hunger and thirst after a right
[1:00:19] relationship with God. You can't be
[1:00:22] perfect, but you can be perfect in
[1:00:26] resting in Christ because he was
[1:00:28] perfect. So, you're hungering and
[1:00:31] thirsting after this relationship
[1:00:34] with God. And that is that is what it's
[1:00:39] all about right there. Now, we're really
[1:00:41] getting into the meat in this. This is
[1:00:43] all producing all of the humility and
[1:00:45] all of the repentance and all this. It's
[1:00:47] really producing a relationship that is
[1:00:50] the ultimate that you want this
[1:00:51] relationship with God.
[1:00:54] So this this righteousness
[1:00:57] that's in Matthew 5 and in other play
[1:00:59] places in the Bible, it is a right
[1:01:02] relationship with God. That's
[1:01:04] everything. That's the whole purpose of
[1:01:06] it. When God created the heavens and the
[1:01:08] earth, he made it for his children. He
[1:01:11] gave it to them. He said, "Here, this is
[1:01:12] yours." He wanted a relationship with
[1:01:15] his child.
[1:01:16] And then when we start to feel that
[1:01:19] pull, when we start to want to get
[1:01:21] closer to God, then we start desiring
[1:01:25] that relationship with him. David said
[1:01:28] in the psalm, it's a deep calling to the
[1:01:31] deep.
[1:01:33] It's God calling out to his children and
[1:01:38] then his children starting to call out
[1:01:41] to God,
[1:01:43] desiring that right relationship
[1:01:46] with their Lord and with their savior.
[1:01:50] Many times the devil tries to trick us.
[1:01:54] So when we come to that point, he tries
[1:01:56] to trick us into thinking that we need
[1:01:59] something more than Christ.
[1:02:02] something different. Friends, we talk
[1:02:05] about
[1:02:07] the meat in the sandwich. Paul said,
[1:02:09] "I've fed you with milk because you
[1:02:10] weren't able to take the meat."
[1:02:13] When we take the meat in the sandwich,
[1:02:16] that is that relationship with Christ.
[1:02:19] That's the deepest most wonderful thing
[1:02:22] in the entire Bible. The the whole Bible
[1:02:25] is written as a as a book of
[1:02:26] relationship between God and the and the
[1:02:29] individual. And that is everything. If
[1:02:32] we just have this relationship with him.
[1:02:37] 2 Corinthians chapter 5. Listen to this.
[1:02:43] Verse 20. 2 Corinthians 5:20. Now then,
[1:02:46] we are ambass ambassadors for Christ. As
[1:02:48] though God were pleading through us. We
[1:02:50] implore you on Christ's behalf. Be
[1:02:53] reconciled to God. For he made him who
[1:02:57] knew no sin to be sin for us.
[1:03:01] that we might become the righteousness
[1:03:05] of God in him.
[1:03:08] It's not our righteousness. We hunger
[1:03:10] and thirst after righteousness, but not
[1:03:12] for our own. We hunger and thirst for
[1:03:14] that relationship with God, with Christ.
[1:03:18] That is everything. And that is this
[1:03:20] progression. So, we have this
[1:03:22] repentance. We have this feeling bad all
[1:03:24] the way now to where's this deep hunger.
[1:03:26] I want to get closer to him. Now, I know
[1:03:28] how bad of a person I am. And now I'm
[1:03:31] starting to get a little taste of how
[1:03:33] great he is. I want to just be closer to
[1:03:35] him. You've you've realized now you've
[1:03:37] given your heart to the Lord. Now you're
[1:03:38] a Christian. Now you've been baptized.
[1:03:40] Now you realize what's happened. You
[1:03:42] realize that someone else paid your debt
[1:03:45] of sin. And now you are hungering and
[1:03:48] thirsting after a right relationship
[1:03:51] with God.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; And then we become the righteousness of
[1:03:57] God in him.
[1:04:00] in Christ.
[1:04:03] The Bible says there are none righteous,
[1:04:04] not one. But do you understand? It's
[1:04:07] because he is righteous
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; and we want to be part of him. Now
[1:04:13] listen to this verse number seven. Now
[1:04:15] we are moving past we've given our
[1:04:18] hearts to the Lord. We've made this
[1:04:19] commitment. Now we have this burning
[1:04:21] desire by the way that never leaves this
[1:04:23] hungering and thirst thirsting after
[1:04:24] righteousness. People are always saying,
[1:04:26] "Oh, well, it's when I receive the Holy
[1:04:27] Spirit and and they look for the Holy
[1:04:29] Spirit." When you receive the Holy
[1:04:30] Spirit, it becomes stronger.
[1:04:33] When you finally receive that that
[1:04:36] spirit of Christ living in you, then
[1:04:39] it's just even I mean that pull that
[1:04:42] thirst and that hunger is far more
[1:04:45] because you got a little taste of it.
[1:04:48] And man, it's like eating your favorite
[1:04:50] food. You don't want just a sliver.
[1:04:53] You've tasted it. Say, "Man, that was
[1:04:55] good. I want some more. I want more."
[1:04:58] And I want more. And with with Jesus,
[1:05:00] you don't get filled up. Just more and
[1:05:02] more. Blessed are the merciful. Verse
[1:05:06] number seven, Matthew 5. For they shall
[1:05:10] obtain mercy. So, we understand we're
[1:05:13] sinners. We understand that we have
[1:05:14] received mercy. Now, God's mercy,
[1:05:19] we we want that for ourselves. We've
[1:05:22] understood we're sinners and now we give
[1:05:25] that mercy to other people.
[1:05:30] When we truly understand that mercy is
[1:05:33] deserving a penalty but not receiving
[1:05:36] that penalty, it's reserving punishment
[1:05:40] but not receiving that punishment. And
[1:05:43] we truly understand that we have
[1:05:46] received mercy. Now we treat others as
[1:05:49] the Lord has treat treated us. Blessed
[1:05:51] are the merciful, for you shall receive
[1:05:54] mercy. Let me give you an example. This
[1:05:55] happened to me a couple days ago. I was
[1:05:57] coming home and I saw on uh on Apple
[1:06:03] Maps that I 10 was really crowded and uh
[1:06:07] so instead of going over the freeway and
[1:06:12] shooting north, I um decided to I I went
[1:06:16] down to Oracle. So, I took a left on
[1:06:17] Miracle Mile and I was going to take um
[1:06:20] the road that turns into uh Lockinata. I
[1:06:23] was going to take that all the way up by
[1:06:25] my house. So, I'm driving along and I
[1:06:29] got to take a right and I see and
[1:06:30] there's a stop light and I was like,
[1:06:31] "Okay, I'll turn right right here." I
[1:06:33] flip on my blinker and I'm I'm uh I I
[1:06:37] start to slow down and there was this
[1:06:40] vehicle behind me and it was like a like
[1:06:43] a 75 Omobile. really cool looking car.
[1:06:47] So, I was kind of keeping an eye on it
[1:06:49] and I was like, "Yeah." You know, and I
[1:06:51] was looking in the mirror and it was
[1:06:52] just really a cherry car. And so, I'm
[1:06:54] I'm going along and and I flip on my
[1:06:56] blinker and I'm going to turn right and
[1:06:58] I look and I was like, "Oh, this isn't
[1:07:01] where I need to turn." So, I flip off my
[1:07:03] blinker and I just keep going. Well, it
[1:07:06] made the guy in the Omobile mad.
[1:07:09] So, he's behind me and he's he's gonna
[1:07:13] turn right and we're cruising along. It
[1:07:15] probably cost him maybe a second and a
[1:07:18] half maybe. But the fact is I was I
[1:07:20] would made a mistake. I was I had my
[1:07:22] blinker on and then I changed my mind.
[1:07:24] So he's behind me, gets up behind me and
[1:07:28] he turns right and as he's turning
[1:07:32] he honks.
[1:07:35] I was like whatever, man. You know,
[1:07:42] I want to give you that last little
[1:07:44] insult
[1:07:46] because you made a mistake and you made
[1:07:49] me mad because you were so low as to
[1:07:51] make this mistake, have your blinker on
[1:07:53] and slow down in front of me. If I would
[1:07:56] have turned, everything would have been
[1:07:57] fine.
[1:07:59] But I changed my mind. I turned the
[1:08:01] blinker off and I headed forward. I made
[1:08:03] a simple mistake. And as he was turning,
[1:08:07] Honk,
[1:08:09] I'm gonna get in this last little word.
[1:08:12] Come on, man. Cut me some slack.
[1:08:16] Give me some mercy. I made a mistake.
[1:08:20] It's okay. And that's how we should be
[1:08:22] with others. It's a mistake. It's all
[1:08:26] right. If it costs you a little bit, if
[1:08:28] it puts you out a little bit, be
[1:08:31] merciful. This is everyday stuff.
[1:08:35] We should be merciful in everyday stuff
[1:08:38] because if we are not merciful, the
[1:08:42] Bible says that we will not obtain mercy
[1:08:46] and it's in everything. We can't just be
[1:08:49] a Christian in church. It's it's
[1:08:51] everywhere we are. And that guy with his
[1:08:55] horn, I'm going to get this this little
[1:08:58] this little bit in. Don't we don't do
[1:09:00] that.
[1:09:03] Blessed are the pure in heart,
[1:09:07] for they shall see God.
[1:09:10] Now we see in our progression now we are
[1:09:14] Christians.
[1:09:16] There's no malice. There's no hatred.
[1:09:18] There's no impatience.
[1:09:20] They know this Christian knows how bad
[1:09:23] he is. He knows what Jesus has done for
[1:09:27] him. They make plenty of mistakes and
[1:09:30] there and there's plenty of mistakes in
[1:09:32] all of us. But we repent for our
[1:09:34] mistakes and you're pure in heart. So
[1:09:37] you can go before the Lord after you sin
[1:09:40] and you will. And you can go before the
[1:09:42] Lord and you say, "Lord, I'm sorry,
[1:09:45] Lord. You know my heart. I sinned. I
[1:09:48] knew better. I did it. But you know,
[1:09:50] Lord, ultimately I want to serve you and
[1:09:53] I'm going to put you first."
[1:09:55] Then being pure in heart leads to this
[1:09:57] next verse. Blessed are the peacemakers.
[1:10:02] For they shall be called the children of
[1:10:04] God. This is where our faith is
[1:10:06] displayed.
[1:10:08] The guy
[1:10:10] honking at me. It's not a big deal, you
[1:10:14] know. It's it's it's just criticism.
[1:10:18] It's like, okay, if somebody honks at
[1:10:20] you, don't honk back. Just keep going.
[1:10:22] If somebody makes a mistake, just let it
[1:10:25] go and bring peace. Wherever you go, let
[1:10:29] peace follow you. When someone starts
[1:10:32] saying something negative, don't go into
[1:10:35] it. Don't correct them and lift yourself
[1:10:38] up, but just do your best to sway the
[1:10:41] conversation to something positive
[1:10:45] and be that peacemaker. When someone
[1:10:48] puts you down, don't fight with them.
[1:10:51] Don't get defensive.
[1:10:53] Pay a compliment to that person maybe
[1:10:54] who's putting you down
[1:10:57] and share your testimony.
[1:10:59] You know, the world
[1:11:02] needs us. Really, we were put in this
[1:11:05] world, as I said, to serve other people.
[1:11:08] Tell the world what Jesus has done for
[1:11:10] you and use these biatitudes. We'll
[1:11:13] we'll read them entirely here in a
[1:11:15] minute, but use these biatitudes in your
[1:11:17] witnessing.
[1:11:19] And then what's going to happen? It'll
[1:11:22] be a great blessing to you,
[1:11:25] but to those that you are witnessing to,
[1:11:29] imagine it could mean eternal life to
[1:11:32] that person if you are representing God
[1:11:34] in a in the right way.
[1:11:38] Blessed are they. And then once you've
[1:11:41] come to that point,
[1:11:44] the opposition arises
[1:11:48] when you stand for Christ.
[1:11:51] Now listen to this. You become a
[1:11:53] Christian.
[1:11:55] You've given your heart to the Lord. You
[1:11:56] realize how bad you are. You you've
[1:11:58] repented. You've started doing right.
[1:12:00] The the Lord is using you. And you're
[1:12:03] standing up for Jesus Christ. And this
[1:12:05] is all about Jesus. Everything's about
[1:12:07] Jesus. The whole Bible is about one man.
[1:12:11] It's about Jesus. And you start
[1:12:12] witnessing about him. You start standing
[1:12:15] for him in everything that you do. And
[1:12:17] many times you have to stand against the
[1:12:20] society that you are in. It might be a
[1:12:23] church society, may be a Catholic
[1:12:25] society, it may be a political society,
[1:12:28] it may be an ungodly society, it may be
[1:12:30] a work society. Whatever it is, you
[1:12:32] start standing for Christ and you start
[1:12:34] being that peacemaker and you start
[1:12:36] loving the Lord and you start you start
[1:12:38] witnessing to others and you start
[1:12:40] telling others about your testimony.
[1:12:42] Blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:12:44] for righteousness sake,
[1:12:46] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[1:12:49] Blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[1:12:51] and persecute you, and shall say all
[1:12:53] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:12:55] my sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly
[1:12:57] glad, for great is your reward in
[1:13:00] heaven. For so persecuted they the
[1:13:02] prophets which were before you.
[1:13:05] If you truly stand, if you truly stand
[1:13:08] for Christ, you will be persecuted. Not
[1:13:12] if you bring it on yourself,
[1:13:15] not if you are unwise in your words,
[1:13:19] but if you truly stand,
[1:13:22] you will be hated. Look at Charlie Kirk.
[1:13:26] People are protesting vigils in his
[1:13:30] honor.
[1:13:31] Do you see the man? They're going out
[1:13:33] there that this man goes through and he
[1:13:36] kicks over the candles and tears down
[1:13:38] the stuff that that they had that they
[1:13:40] had that they were worshiping with the
[1:13:42] people and paying paying respects to
[1:13:44] this man, Charlie Kirk. And this hatred
[1:13:46] came out in the people. They start
[1:13:48] cussing and yelling and and kicking over
[1:13:50] the stuff and desecrating this man's not
[1:13:53] because they hate the people that are
[1:13:55] doing it, but they And not even because
[1:13:56] they hate Charlie Kirk. They hate what
[1:13:59] he stood for.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; They hate Jesus. They hate right things.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; And G and he says right here that you
[1:14:10] will suffer.
[1:14:13] If you truly stand for me, you will
[1:14:16] suffer. Abortion protesters,
[1:14:20] people protesting
[1:14:22] abortion are hated.
[1:14:26] cussed out on the streets. And these
[1:14:29] crazies that are that do that to them,
[1:14:31] they don't hate the person, they hate
[1:14:34] that person's ideals.
[1:14:38] They don't even know why they're doing
[1:14:39] it. It's just this anger that comes up.
[1:14:43] You know, you hear people call the
[1:14:44] president of the United States a
[1:14:46] fascist,
[1:14:48] calling him a racist,
[1:14:51] calling him these things, calling
[1:14:53] Charlie Kirk a fascist, calling Charlie
[1:14:55] Kirk a racist, calling Charlie Charlie
[1:14:56] Kirk a homophobe. They don't know Char,
[1:14:58] they don't know them. They hate what
[1:15:00] they stand for.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; You know, ultimately, they hate God. And
[1:15:07] Jesus is saying here, they hate me.
[1:15:11] And you will suffer for that because
[1:15:14] those are your ideals. That's what you
[1:15:15] stand for. It's not you. It's me that
[1:15:18] they hate.
[1:15:20] And why the hatred?
[1:15:23] They really hate
[1:15:26] this
[1:15:28] Christian living. They hate it. John
[1:15:32] chapter 15. There's never been a man
[1:15:34] more hated in all the history of the
[1:15:36] world. Never than Jesus Christ. He is
[1:15:40] the most hated person that has ever
[1:15:43] lived. And he is the only person that's
[1:15:46] ever lived that really mattered.
[1:15:49] And because he mattered,
[1:15:51] I mattered to him.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; He put me above everything.
[1:15:57] He took the lowest
[1:16:00] to help me. First uh John chapter 15
[1:16:04] verse 18, listen to what Jesus says. He
[1:16:06] says, "If the world hates you,
[1:16:09] you know that it hated me before it
[1:16:11] hated you.
[1:16:14] If you were of the world, the world
[1:16:16] would love its own. Yet, because you are
[1:16:18] not of the world, but I chose you out of
[1:16:20] the world, therefore the world hates
[1:16:22] you. Remember the word that I said to
[1:16:24] you, a servant is not greater than his
[1:16:26] master. If they persecuted me, they will
[1:16:28] also persecute persecute you.
[1:16:31] If they kept my word, they will keep
[1:16:33] yours also."
[1:16:35] But all these things they will do to you
[1:16:39] for my name's sake
[1:16:42] because they do not know him who sent
[1:16:45] me.
[1:16:47] If I had not come and spoken to them,
[1:16:51] they would have no sin. But now they
[1:16:53] have no excuse for their the for their
[1:16:55] sin. He who hates me hates my father
[1:16:59] also.
[1:17:02] You have to go through Jesus Christ.
[1:17:03] Friends,
[1:17:05] you cannot get around Jesus and go to
[1:17:08] God. If you do not accept Jesus,
[1:17:13] then you cannot accept God. If you hate
[1:17:16] what Jesus is Jesus stands for, guess
[1:17:18] what? You hate the creator.
[1:17:21] If I had not done among them the works
[1:17:23] which no one else did, they would have
[1:17:25] no they would have no sin. But now they
[1:17:28] have seen and also hated both me and my
[1:17:31] father.
[1:17:33] But this happened that the word might be
[1:17:35] fulfilled which is written in their law.
[1:17:37] They hated me without a cause.
[1:17:41] I've heard many stories from many of you
[1:17:44] that were with people.
[1:17:47] They got the notice
[1:17:51] that Charlie Kirk was murdered
[1:17:53] and they rejoiced.
[1:17:56] Yes, Charlie Kirk just got killed.
[1:18:00] They didn't know him, but they hate the
[1:18:02] God he stands for.
[1:18:04] They hate the humility. They hate the
[1:18:06] the the the purity of God
[1:18:11] and they will rejoice.
[1:18:15] They rejoice at Jesus's death. Also,
[1:18:18] John chapter 16 verse two, they will put
[1:18:21] you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time
[1:18:23] is coming that whoever kills you will
[1:18:26] think that he offers God a service.
[1:18:29] Wow. Rejoicing.
[1:18:32] I saw this video somebody sent me of of
[1:18:34] um I think it was a nurse and she was
[1:18:37] talking to her daughters and my one of
[1:18:40] my favorite people in the whole world
[1:18:41] Taylor Swift was got engaged
[1:18:46] and and she was telling her daughter she
[1:18:49] says she says the best thing happened
[1:18:52] one of mommy's favorite things that has
[1:18:54] that could happen happened and the girl
[1:18:57] said
[1:18:59] Donald Trump got killed
[1:19:02] little girl.
[1:19:05] And that's what they're teaching their
[1:19:06] children.
[1:19:08] Someone would be murdered. Rejoice
[1:19:11] right here
[1:19:13] that whoever kills you will think that
[1:19:16] he offers God a service.
[1:19:24] I I feel the the danger
[1:19:27] that these people face.
[1:19:30] they faced that
[1:19:33] co-workers and as I said many of you
[1:19:35] have told me the same thing same
[1:19:36] testimony that people rejoiced at the
[1:19:39] murder of this man
[1:19:42] and
[1:19:44] just because maybe a man's against or a
[1:19:46] woman's against murdering unborn babies
[1:19:50] they hate them or just because they're
[1:19:56] they don't agree with using pronouns
[1:19:58] that don't match the gender,
[1:20:01] that hate. We've seen that. I've seen
[1:20:03] it. That hate comes out or that they're
[1:20:07] they're using they rather than he or
[1:20:09] she.
[1:20:11] And if you don't conform to it, that
[1:20:14] hatred comes out.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's they want to kill you. They
[1:20:20] want you to die. And I'm sure all of you
[1:20:22] have seen them on YouTube and their
[1:20:24] ridiculousness.
[1:20:26] They celebrate the murder of someone
[1:20:28] says it's unnatural and the Bible speaks
[1:20:30] against a man to have a relationship
[1:20:32] with another man or woman with a woman.
[1:20:36] So they re rejoice over his murder.
[1:20:41] Verse number 21. But but all these
[1:20:43] things they will do to you for my name's
[1:20:47] sake because they do not know him that
[1:20:50] sent me.
[1:20:52] these biatitudes, friends, it starts
[1:20:55] with just this foundation. Here's where
[1:20:57] you start. Read it again. Read it in
[1:20:59] your own time. Here's where you start.
[1:21:02] You start with with you realize that
[1:21:04] you're not all that. And then it
[1:21:07] progresses all the way to people will
[1:21:10] hate you because you live a life that is
[1:21:14] consecrated and dedicated to this one
[1:21:17] man, Jesus Christ. And that is the
[1:21:20] progression. And I don't know where any
[1:21:22] of us are. All of us are at different
[1:21:24] stages of this, but it is
[1:21:28] Jesus lays it out here perfectly. Here's
[1:21:30] the way that you become a believer. Now,
[1:21:33] in closing, the um the musicians can
[1:21:35] come. Let me read I want to read the ten
[1:21:37] commandments uh really quickly, and I
[1:21:39] want you to see what most of these
[1:21:40] commandments have in
[1:21:45] common.
[1:21:47] Thou shalt have thou shalt have no other
[1:21:50] gods before me. Thou shalt not make for
[1:21:54] yourself a carved image. Thou shalt not
[1:21:56] take the name of the Lord your God in
[1:21:58] vain. Remember the Sabbath day to keep
[1:21:59] it holy. Honor your father and your
[1:22:01] mother. Thou shalt not murder. Thou
[1:22:03] shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt
[1:22:05] not steal. Thou shalt not bear false
[1:22:07] witness against your neighbor. Thou
[1:22:09] shalt not covet. Thou shalt not Thou
[1:22:12] shalt not. Thou shalt not.
[1:22:15] Okay. Now, watch the difference in
[1:22:19] spirit
[1:22:21] when Jesus Christ comes into your life.
[1:22:24] Watch the difference in spirit from the
[1:22:26] Old Testament to the New Testament. No,
[1:22:29] no, no, no, no. Rules, rules, rules,
[1:22:32] rules, rules. Thou shalt not. Thou shalt
[1:22:34] not. Thou shalt not. Now watch these
[1:22:36] biatitudes again.
[1:22:41] And he opened his mouth and he taught
[1:22:43] them. Verse number two, chapter 5, verse
[1:22:45] two, Matthew.
[1:22:47] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
[1:22:50] theirs is
[1:22:52] the kingdom of heaven. When you're
[1:22:55] convicted of your sins and you realize
[1:22:56] that you're hopeless, in a hopeless
[1:22:59] condition without God, then you realize
[1:23:01] you have a promise in the kingdom of
[1:23:04] heaven.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; You have a place in the kingdom of
[1:23:06] heaven in joy.
[1:23:10] And the joy replaces
[1:23:13] that original poor in spirit. Blessed
[1:23:15] are they that mourn for they shall
[1:23:19] be comforted. Look at the hope that is
[1:23:22] in Jesus Christ. Before there wasn't
[1:23:24] hope. There was no hope in the world.
[1:23:28] But when Jesus came,
[1:23:31] it's not thou shalt not anymore.
[1:23:34] Look at how it becomes positive. Thou
[1:23:36] shalt. Blessed are they that mourn for
[1:23:38] they shall be comforted. Blessed are the
[1:23:42] meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
[1:23:47] Blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:23:49] thirst after righteousness, for they
[1:23:51] shall look at be filled. Look at all the
[1:23:54] promises. Look at all the promises that
[1:23:56] are with Jesus Christ. There the
[1:23:58] promises weren't there before. But when
[1:24:01] this man stepped stepped on the scene,
[1:24:03] it's like, "Whatever you've done, what
[1:24:06] whatever sin you committed, I'll take it
[1:24:08] on myself, and you shall have peace.
[1:24:12] You shall have love."
[1:24:14] Blessed are the merciful,
[1:24:17] for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are
[1:24:21] the pure in heart, for they shall
[1:24:25] see God. Blessed are the peacemakers,
[1:24:28] for they shall
[1:24:31] be called the children of God.
[1:24:41] And my computer locked up, so we'll just
[1:24:43] keep going the oldfashioned way.
[1:24:48] Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
[1:24:49] shall be called the children of God.
[1:24:52] Blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:24:54] for righteousness sake, for theirs is
[1:24:57] the kingdom of heaven.
[1:25:01] Blessed are you when men shall revile
[1:25:04] you and persecute you and shall say all
[1:25:05] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:25:08] my my name's sake, for my sake. Rejoice
[1:25:12] and be exceeding glad for great is your
[1:25:17] reward in heaven. for so persecuted they
[1:25:21] the prophets which were before you. Oh,
[1:25:24] it's so positive.
[1:25:26] It's so good.
[1:25:29] And it's like stand for me. You know, I
[1:25:32] don't know if back to Charlie Kirk, what
[1:25:35] a what a man. And look at what has
[1:25:37] resulted from him. It was love.
[1:25:41] It was praise.
[1:25:43] his his widow stood there and she was
[1:25:45] just doing nothing but talking about
[1:25:47] Jesus and and thanking the Lord for his
[1:25:49] his life and saying we are going to
[1:25:52] carry on. I think about brother Biscll
[1:25:55] and and all that in in all of his years
[1:25:57] and his long life
[1:26:00] blessed are you brother Ed
[1:26:04] blessed are all the things that you've
[1:26:06] done and now enter into the kingdom.
[1:26:11] Friends, I want to be among those. I
[1:26:14] want to be among those who follow these
[1:26:17] words of Jesus. I want to be the
[1:26:19] peacemaker. I want to be the merciful. I
[1:26:23] want to be I want to be Lord. I want to
[1:26:25] have this right relationship with you.
[1:26:27] It's everything to me, Lord. I just want
[1:26:29] to have that relationship with you.
[1:26:31] Please,
[1:26:32] Lord, that's everything.
[1:26:34] If I fail in everything that I do, if if
[1:26:36] I just mess everything up, but Lord,
[1:26:39] just let me have that relationship, that
[1:26:42] right relationship. Lord, I am blessed
[1:26:44] just to hunger and thirst after that
[1:26:47] righteousness. I am blessed to want it.
[1:26:49] I'm just Lord, it's everything to me.
[1:26:52] And then there's no more thou thou shalt
[1:26:55] not. Now it's and thou shalt be filled.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[1:27:02] after righteousness. We're blessed just
[1:27:03] to hunger and thirst after it. But we
[1:27:05] also have a promise that we shall be
[1:27:07] filled. Amen. Blessed are the merciful.
[1:27:12] Don't give the honk.
[1:27:15] Just be merciful.
[1:27:17] Just be loving. Be loving one to
[1:27:19] another. Was telling Josiah
[1:27:22] was reading to me a scripture. He didn't
[1:27:24] tell me where it was from. And I said
[1:27:26] there's only one person that could write
[1:27:27] such words and that was that was John.
[1:27:30] John was all about love. He was all
[1:27:33] about being merciful. He was all about
[1:27:36] getting along with each other. The
[1:27:38] beloved disciple, the most important
[1:27:40] thing to him was love one another.
[1:27:44] Don't fight.
[1:27:45] And then Jesus said, "And by your love
[1:27:48] for one another,
[1:27:51] the whole world will know that I am the
[1:27:53] Messiah because of the example that you
[1:27:56] set." friends, the example that we need
[1:27:58] to set in this church. Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer
[1:28:07] a slave
[1:28:10] to fear.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child
[1:28:18] of God. God,
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer
[1:28:24] a slave
[1:28:27] to fear.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child
[1:28:35] of God.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to interject for
[1:28:38] a minute. Do you know what the opposite
[1:28:39] of fear is? It's not it's not courage.
[1:28:44] The opposite of fear is love.
[1:28:47] The Bible very plainly says that love
[1:28:51] casts out fear. So as you're singing
[1:28:53] this song, as our brother is singing the
[1:28:55] song, think about that. Think about the
[1:28:57] love of Jesus Christ and how we do not
[1:29:00] have to fear anymore because he went to
[1:29:02] the cross. You know who he went to the
[1:29:04] cross for? He went to the cross for the
[1:29:05] person sitting in your chair right now.
[1:29:09] It's an individual thing. I think Lord,
[1:29:12] you went you did that for me. If I was
[1:29:14] the only one that ever accepted Jesus
[1:29:17] Christ as my savior, he would have gone
[1:29:19] to the cross for me. I believe that that
[1:29:22] was this man's testimony that wrote that
[1:29:24] song.
[1:29:27] He said, "If it would have just been me,
[1:29:28] he would have done it."
[1:29:33] You unravel me
[1:29:37] with a meloy
[1:29:40] and you surround me with
[1:29:45] a song
[1:29:49] of deliverance
[1:29:53] from my eneies
[1:29:57] till all my Fears are gone
[1:30:04] and I'm no longer a slave
[1:30:09] to fear.
[1:30:13] Oh, I am a child
[1:30:16] of God.
[1:30:20] I'm no longer a slave
[1:30:24] to fear.
[1:30:28] Oh, I am a child
[1:30:32] of God. From my mother's womb,
[1:30:35] from my mother's womb,
[1:30:39] you have chosen me.
[1:30:43] Your love has called my name.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. And I've been born again
[1:30:54] into your family.
[1:30:58] Oh, your blood flows through my veins
[1:31:05] and I'm no longer a slave
[1:31:09] to peace.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child
[1:31:17] of God.
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:20] I'm no longer a slave
[1:31:25] to fear.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child. Sing that again. I'm
[1:31:33] no longer
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; and I'm no longer a slave
[1:31:40] to fear.
[1:31:43] Oh, I am a child
[1:31:47] of God.
[1:31:50] I'm no longer a slave
[1:31:54] to fear.
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child
[1:32:02] of God.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; I think we canled on the one baptism. Is
[1:32:07] there anyone that wants to be baptized
[1:32:09] this morning?
[1:32:11] I always want to make it open
[1:32:14] friends
[1:32:15] on these biatitudes and on this sermon
[1:32:17] on the mount
[1:32:20] in this progression
[1:32:22] as a believer
[1:32:26] when I was talking about how they hate I
[1:32:30] mean the Bible says it's it's above my
[1:32:32] pay grade this is what the Bible says
[1:32:35] that they will hate you
[1:32:38] for what you believe they will hate you
[1:32:40] for the ideals. They will hate you for
[1:32:43] standing up against them. It's in the
[1:32:45] word. Now, we don't do it half-hazardly.
[1:32:48] And we don't disrespect the person that
[1:32:50] hates us. A real Christian would go to
[1:32:53] the cross for that person that hated
[1:32:56] them. That's a Christian.
[1:33:00] You don't get into an argument just to
[1:33:02] get into an argument. You don't put
[1:33:04] somebody down because they have
[1:33:05] different ideals. Then you're falling
[1:33:06] into the same trap as they are. What you
[1:33:09] do is you say, "Lord, have mercy on that
[1:33:12] person."
[1:33:14] Let me quote someone.
[1:33:16] Father,
[1:33:18] forgive them for what they do. Forgive
[1:33:21] them, Lord, for they know not what they
[1:33:23] do.
[1:33:25] Jesus hanging on the cross
[1:33:28] for the people that hated him so much so
[1:33:31] that they murdered him.
[1:33:34] And I thank God that we still have
[1:33:36] martyrs in the world today that God has
[1:33:39] given gifts and they can take those
[1:33:41] gifts and they can make us stand and
[1:33:45] say, "No,
[1:33:46] I don't care which direction the world's
[1:33:48] going. I don't care what politics says.
[1:33:52] The Bible says differently." And I will
[1:33:55] stand on what the Bible says, no matter
[1:33:58] if it cost me my life. It might cost me
[1:34:01] my career. It might cost me my position.
[1:34:04] It might cost me my position as a
[1:34:05] pastor, but I stand upon this word.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; I stand upon what it says.
[1:34:14] And no, I don't want to water it down
[1:34:16] and say it's okay just because of the
[1:34:18] time that we live in. No, no, no. If
[1:34:21] it's written in here, it's true.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And my opinions and your opinions don't
[1:34:26] matter.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; What matters is in this book. Let's all
[1:34:29] stand
[1:34:31] one more time on that song. You know
[1:34:32] that song is beautiful. Love
[1:34:35] casts out fear. And it was the love for
[1:34:38] me that God gave his life. God sent his
[1:34:41] son to go to the cross. And he willingly
[1:34:46] gave his life. And even more of a
[1:34:48] miracle that he willingly gave his life.
[1:34:50] He lived a sinless life. He lived a life
[1:34:53] with all the temptations of the world
[1:34:55] and never fell to one of them. Ah, it
[1:34:58] just makes me want to lift him up and
[1:34:59] say,
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; "He's my champion. The one that died on
[1:35:03] that cross is my champion. He's the one
[1:35:05] that I point to
[1:35:07] and people will hate you.
[1:35:10] They killed this man. They're
[1:35:12] celebrating his funeral today. They
[1:35:14] killed him not because they knew him or
[1:35:16] they hated him. They hated what he stood
[1:35:18] for.
[1:35:21] Jesus said it's a prophecy fulfilled.
[1:35:24] Jesus said it'll happen. There's many
[1:35:25] martyrs through the ages. And he was a
[1:35:28] martyr Messiah.
[1:35:33] Yeah. One more time.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer
[1:35:37] a slave
[1:35:39] to fear.
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child
[1:35:47] of God.
[1:35:50] I'm no longer a slave
[1:35:54] to fear.
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:35:58] Oh, I am a child
[1:36:02] of God. Let's sing. You split the sea.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; You split the sea so I could walk right
[1:36:12] through it. My fears are drowned in
[1:36:17] perfect love.
[1:36:22] You rescued me so I could stand and say
[1:36:29] I am a child.
[1:36:32] Let's sing that again. You split the
[1:36:34] sea.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; You split the sea so I could walk right
[1:36:42] through it. My fears are drowned in
[1:36:47] perfect love.
[1:36:52] You rescued me so I can stand and say
[1:36:59] I am a child
[1:37:02] of God. I'm no longer
[1:37:05] and I'm no longer
[1:37:08] a slave
[1:37:10] to fear.
[1:37:14] Oh, I am a child
[1:37:18] of God
[1:37:21] and I'm no longer a slave
[1:37:26] to fear.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child
[1:37:34] of God.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. How many here
[1:37:42] want that right relationship with God?
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I raise my hand. Lord, if I could have
[1:37:49] anything in the world, anything in the
[1:37:52] world, Lord, I want that relationship.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:38:02] Lord, I believe it pleased you.
[1:38:07] feel, Father, that you were pleased when
[1:38:09] you saw those hands go up,
[1:38:13] Lord.
[1:38:15] We appreciate your healing. We
[1:38:17] appreciate, Lord, you providing for us.
[1:38:21] We appreciate
[1:38:23] you putting food on the table. We
[1:38:24] appreciate, Father, you you giving us an
[1:38:26] income. We we appreciate, Lord, our our
[1:38:29] families. And we appreciate all of these
[1:38:31] things. But Lord, if you would just give
[1:38:33] us one thing, it would be to have that
[1:38:34] relationship with you, oh God.
[1:38:38] dear God, that we could we could speak
[1:38:41] with you, our our savior,
[1:38:45] oh God, and that you would give us the
[1:38:47] correction that we so desire. And and
[1:38:50] Father, that your hand would just be
[1:38:52] upon us. Lord, I pray to you in the name
[1:38:55] of Jesus Christ that you give us that
[1:39:00] right relationship, that you give us
[1:39:02] that righteousness
[1:39:05] as Jesus spoke of.
[1:39:08] For we hunger, Lord, after it,
[1:39:12] Father, go with us today.
[1:39:15] May we draw closer. I pray that as we
[1:39:17] leave this building,
[1:39:20] we would leave better people closer to
[1:39:22] you.
[1:39:24] I love you, Lord. Thank you,
[1:39:28] Father. I pray that your blessings would
[1:39:30] rest upon
[1:39:32] Cloverdale Church.
[1:39:34] [Music]
[1:39:35] Lord, I I know he hasn't been
[1:39:38] ministering for a long time, but he's
[1:39:39] still a loss.
[1:39:41] Pray that your hand would be upon each
[1:39:43] one of them and each one of those that
[1:39:45] mourn the death of this martyr, Charlie
[1:39:50] Kirk. We pray for each one of those. And
[1:39:53] Father, as they that the safety, this
[1:39:56] hand of God would be upon all those that
[1:39:58] are up there now in Phoenix and
[1:40:00] celebrating his life. And Lord, that
[1:40:02] your hand of safety and protection would
[1:40:04] be upon each one of them, Lord, from the
[1:40:07] the harm of the enemy that would want to
[1:40:10] hurt them, Lord, on the roads, wherever
[1:40:11] they may be. May your hand be upon each
[1:40:13] one and be upon us, Lord,
[1:40:17] and this congregation.

[1:40:23] walk with you. We pray in Jesus name.

[1:40:44] nobody has a testimony, I I I could take

[1:44:08] Brother Daniel was talking about old
[1:44:10] songs and new songs. I don't know of a
[1:44:13] song older than this that we sing in
[1:44:15] this church. This was written by Moses.
[1:44:19] It's one of the oldest songs we could
[1:44:21] possibly sing.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Let's sing.
[1:44:26] [Applause]
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Let's sing. May his favor. Let's put
[1:44:31] that verse up there.

[1:44:40] generations
[1:44:41] and your family and your children and
[1:44:46] their children and their children. May
[1:44:50] his favor be upon you and a thousand
[1:44:55] generations,
[1:44:57] your family, your children and their
[1:45:01] children. And let's sing that again. May
[1:45:04] his favor be upon you and a thousand
[1:45:10] generations
[1:45:11] and your family and your children and
[1:45:15] their children. May his presence
[1:45:19] May his presence go before you and
[1:45:23] behind you and beside you, all around
[1:45:27] you and within you. He is with you. He

[1:45:45] is with you. He is with you. In the
[1:45:49] morning, in the evening, in your coming,
[1:45:53] in your going, you're weeping and
[1:45:57] rejoicing.
[1:45:59] He is for you. He is for you. He is for
[1:46:03] you. He is for you. He is for you. He is
[1:46:08] for you. He is for you. He is for you.
