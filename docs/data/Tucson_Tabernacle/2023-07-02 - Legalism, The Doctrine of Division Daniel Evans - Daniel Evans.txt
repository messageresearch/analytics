brother Silas you weren't the only one shouting Hallelujah when our brother when we heard the news it's good to have your cousin Jonathan I don't like it when my family goes away there's a there's a strikling striking family resemblance between us God bless you my friend it's good to it's good to have you back let's turn in our Bibles to Galatians chapter one and stay here if you could play for just a little bit [Music] start verse 8. [Music] Galatians chapter 1 verse 8 reads like this but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say I now again If any man preach any other gospel unto you then that ye have received let him be accursed for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man of course the Apostle Paul saying those words let's pray almighty God we thank you for giving us another day Lord we thank you for the reading of your word and I know Lord that my words will fail but the words that I just read if they come out of this book that they will never fail Lord I pray that your anointing would be here today the Lord that you bless us with your presence in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you can take your seeds it's good to see all of you are out in the house of the Lord today it's especially good to see the visitors with us brother I see you back there my brother God bless you raise your hand so everybody can look back and see you back there God bless you my friend it's it's good to have you here it's um had a note Brother David sister Amber's husband God bless you Brother David raise your hand you can do it welcome my brother it's good to have you brother you're welcome here feel comfortable and I'd like to meet you after service if you wouldn't mind I'd like to shake your hand I haven't met you yet God bless you I don't know if I don't see necessarily any other visitors mayor Lee's pointing let me tell you something Mama Mary that's my mother-in-law Melissa is not a visitor Melissa and Heath God bless you it's good it's good to see you Melissa you're always welcome too God bless you it's it's good to have you all thanks merely I I might have looked over it I'm blessed to be here blessed to be here this morning I think about um the scripture I just read and I think that it's often misinterpreted I think it's probably usually misinterpreted I am the title of my sermon today is is legalism the doctrine of division so why would I read a scripture like that that Paul says that an angel if an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel then that which we have already preached to you let him be accursed and then I titled my sermon legalism the doctrine of division so how do those two things tie in together well that scripture that letter written to the churches at galatia was written in direct conflict and to correct legalism within the church the whole book of Galatians is written for that and I think about churches Christian churches throughout the world and you'll find that there is one common attack that comes after every Christian Church this one included through the years and I'm thankful to say that we haven't had to combat that recently but I want you to know it's coming because it always comes to Christian churches and it's going to be coming here and I pray that this sermon this morning will help you to be ready for it when you see it rise up right now we have this group of brother David's good to see you my brother it's good good to haven't seen you in a while God bless you it's um we have a group now that seems to be in Harmony and seems to love one another and and we see our numbers our ranks starting to grow and and things are looking good but as I read from a quote last weekend that the devil's going to come against us so our time is coming and the what we see is many times the attack on a body will come from within it'll come from within the um we see that um cancer we see how cancer will start inside of a body I have a friend in Jeffersonville that I've had some good fellowship with over the years and a few years ago we were we were talking and and he was describing how a cancer works and what happens is inside this body there is a cell single cell that becomes perverted it becomes mutated and the body when that happens within the body if it's a bruise or if it's if it's something if there's a problem then the body will attack it and destroy that cell but the most deceiving ones are the cells that look like all of the other cells whether it be in the pancreas or whether it be in the lungs or or whether wherever it would be this cell looks just like all of the other cells so it's but it's wrong it's got a perversion inside of it's got a mutation inside of it so it will start to multiply and start to spread and because it looks like everything else the body doesn't see it the body's defense mechanisms don't recognize this foreign body that's starting to grow so it doesn't it doesn't attack it it doesn't come after that cell until it's too late and until that cancer has become big enough and strong enough to well now the body can't combat it and then it starts to multiply and it starts to grow and eventually it kills the body and the same thing with the church there'll be something that sneaks in and it looks maybe it looks like everything else but it starts to spread and many times it's a Doctrine and that's what I'm going to talk about this morning and then it continues to spread in before the people know it all of a sudden there's Division and hatred within the church and the church splits and it starts moving out and then the people start hating each other start fighting against each other and that is what happened right here that this book this letter that Paul writes to the Believers in galatia that's what happened to them now if you've been following along in our study on the book of Acts I preached on Acts 15. and how in Acts 15 what had happened is Paul was out on missionary trips and and he he comes to this city in the this area of the world called galatia he comes to this city and he founds this church he has many converts and he founds this church in the city of Antioch and these people most of them are gentile people but there's also Jews mixed in there and they're they're worshiping they give their hearts to the Lord Jesus Remember nobody knew about Jesus Christ back then so he's witnessing and he and these people they start to see that because of the grace of Christ because Christ died for their sins that they can be forgiven of their sins the Jewish believers they are accepting they have accepted the same Christ and they have accepted salvation through Christ so this church is growing and it is such an important church the church at Jerusalem is considered the First Christian Church the church at Antioch is considered the second Christian Church great place in fact Antioch it's so important that is the first place the word Christian was ever used because these people were christ-like so they the this this church forms and it starts to spread throughout this area of galatia to these different towns if you've been following with the book of Acts you can see that the brothers are going different places and they're starting these churches and they're they're they're leading people to the Lord Jesus and then all of a sudden these two brothers from the church at Jerusalem they come into this newly formed church at Antioch and these people are rejoicing they're happy they're they're they're leading their families to the lord they're receiving their salvation through Grace and they understand how how wonderful the Lord Jesus is that their sins can be wiped away and then these two brothers they come in and they start preaching the doctrine of circumcision and other doctrines diet how they should eat certain of these Jewish Traditions all of these Commandments and they're saying that that did you know the prophet Moses and these new Believers are oh we believe Moses Moses was a prophet of God did you know that Moses said that you can't eat like that anymore yeah you can't do that anymore oh okay and another thing is you have to be circumcised what yeah well um okay and then another thing is you have to observe all of these feasts and all these festivals well okay because look right here it says it says in the law of Moses that you have to do these things Moses was a prophet am I right yes well then you have to do it and they start getting confused so then Paul he comes in he says what is going on what are you doing now you're causing all this Division and the church is all fighting with each other what are you doing and they said well do you not believe and Paul says yes I believe but you can't put that on them what are you thinking and the contention was so great between them that they had to send Paul and Barnabas back to Jerusalem to get an answer because there was so much doubt and what Paul was saying because of these two brothers that came in and caused all of this division let's turn to Acts chapter 15. now as you're turning Christianity in the very essence of Christianity it's it's a controversial subject it's an offensive subject Christianity is the message of Grace is offensive to many people it may not seem like it but it is because what the message of grace through Jesus Christ is telling all of us that you are not good enough to answer for your sins you can't do it you're not good enough every other religion in the world is a works-based religion which is Hinduism Buddhism Islam it's all you have to do this work and you will be rewarded which is the way that the human mind thinks but now this new religion comes in through Christ and says no you don't have to do anything all you have to do is accept Christ but then the Jews it's a works-based religion says you have to live according to the law so Christ comes and says no you don't so then there's all this confusion it's it's like well if we don't have to live by the law then what about just go wild and do all this and Paul's like no no no no no and I'm going to get to where Paul addresses all of that in the scriptures here so what he does is they go to Antioch they go to Jerusalem let's read acts 15 chapter Acts chapter 15 verse 1. and here's what I'm talking about and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved when therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and Elders about this question now I asked brother Jordan and I talked about this after service but I asked the other night I said where would I have stood in this disputation would I have stood with the brothers who were teaching the prophet's message saying you have to be circumcised you have to eat this type of food you have to Worship in this way you have to observe this feasts I can read it right there would I have stood with him or would I have stood with this man named Paul who said no you don't have to do it where would I have stood Heath where would you stood and it's I hope I would be with Paul but boy that was a tough pill to swallow the difference is Paul by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and the gift that God placed into his life understood why Abraham brought the Covenant of circumcision and why Moses brought the law he understood the end game he understood what it was for he couldn't they can't just see you you see the rules and regulations you see them and you stop right there but there is a reason for them Paul understood that a minister with a gift to explain the word otherwise you're just following a rule and it's doing you no good let's skip to verse seven in Acts 15. now this now they're in Jerusalem and there's this disputation between the preachers and basically Paul and Barnabas who had the revelation and when there had been much disputing Peter rose up and said unto them men and brethren you know how that a good while ago God made a choice Among Us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe and God which knoweth the hearts bear them witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did unto us and put no difference between us and Them purifying their hearts by faith now therefore I love this now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear Peter's saying that you know good and well your failures inside you know your heart you know where you've sinned you know where you haven't followed the law and you accept Christ and you're going to try to hammer this these legalism these doctrines upon them people and you couldn't even do it but we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as they I love that Peter was saying that hey we believe that the grace of Christ saves us too not just the Gentiles but he lifts up the new Believers but Peter's doing he's lifting up these new Believers above the old-time believers then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring What miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles and think about that and then it goes to verse 13 and says and after they had held their peace it wasn't recorded I wish I I wish I could have heard what they said I wish I could have heard Paul and barnabas's sermon right there that oh man but I'll talk to Paul in the future and I'm looking forward to him telling us what He preached on that day let's skip to verse 22. then it pleased the apostles and the elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas namely Judas surname bar sabbas and Silas Chief men among the Brethren so these two these two brothers from Jerusalem these two Jewish Brothers the Bible later calls Prophets and they wrote Letters by them after this manner so what happened is James who was the pastor at the church of Jerusalem he writes he and and they they can they conspire together and they write this letter to these Believers in galatia that are all torn apart because of all this legalism that's going around and the letter says this the apostles verse number 23 the apostles and the elders and the Brethren send greeting unto the Brethren which are of the Gentiles and Antioch and Syria and salicia for as much as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying You must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment so so these two brothers go out from Jerusalem and they're they're preaching this doctrine that you have to do this rule in this rule in this Rule and this Rule and these brothers the leaders the one the ones that were Jesus said wait wait we didn't send them another preaching the law of Moses brother Jonathan I'm not saying that they were preaching anything wrong but we didn't send them and let me tell you something neither did the Holy Spirit those brothers were going because of their own doctrines because of their own way of thinking trying to get somebody to convert to their own ways let me let me let you in on a little something that happened at the uh the Branham Tabernacle years ago 1965. brother Branham had the there was this same thing was going on in the Branham Tabernacle people were going out from the church and they were preaching these strange doctrines so brother Branham and the brothers they pin a letter this letter says this no person this is this is part of the letter there's more to this letter no person holding meetings selling books or tapes writing tracks giving out prayer cloths or cards of any kind or soliciting any gifts are not recognized by this church or its Pastor they are doing this under false pretense and have not been given the authority to do so the church does not send out any ministers other than it's Pastor Reverend William Branham to hold Services elsewhere the reason for these resolutions are as follows it has been brought to our attention that ministers are crossing the country entering into other fellowships saying that they are associated with and are sent out by this church to hold these meetings brother Branham says that is on the beginning of the God of this evil age 1965. so we see that this spirit is common its spirit is common not only it's common within within Christian ranks everywhere and you've heard brother Branham say things like say only what the tapes say we've all heard him say that why would he say that what purpose would God's servant have in saying something like that he says it because people are messing it up and they're preaching things that he didn't preach in his name representing him brother Branham says this he says in God hiding himself in Simplicity then really revealing himself in the same in the same 1963 the beginning of the Seven Seals brother Brown says this he says yeah so now listen every listen to every word catch it and if you're taking it on tapes or anything then you say you stay right with that tape teaching don't say nothing but what the tape says just say exactly what the tape says see now because some of these things we're going to understand a whole lot about this now why it's misunderstood he's speaking about the Seven Seals and you'll be sure to say just what the tape says don't say nothing else because I don't say that of my own it's him that says it you see and so many times confusion people raise up and say well so-and-so said it meant so and so just leave it the way it is I think that's one of the biggest problems is we have taken this message of brother Brandon and we have made it into something that he did not intend it to be we messed it up and it's become exactly what these Jewish Believers did they came in and said you got to do this and this and this and this and this and they had no revelation of what it was Paul comes in and says it differently let's continue on with this letter in the book of Acts it seemed good unto us being assembled with one Accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul men have Hazard their lives for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we have sent therefore Judas and Silas who shall also teach you the same things by mouth I'm still in Acts 15 this is verse 28. for it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and us to lay upon you no greater burden than these Necessary Things there's like 600 Commandments in the Old Testament and I think there's more within the message do you hear what I said thanks that you abstain from Meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if you keep yourselves you shall do where well fare you well Meats offered Idols from blood from things strangled these things were extremely offensive to the Jewish people meets offered to idols and things strangled they would kill these things on on the altar of Baal or whatever it is and then they would take the meat and they would sell it in the market and then Paul basically says later on he says hey just don't eat that stuff in front of the Jews it was offensive to the Jewish people and from blood that's the very life a Jewish man a woman they couldn't eat anything that had the blood in it because that was the life it had to be bled out they it was it was offensive so look at the common respect here that these brothers from Jerusalem are teaching they're saying hey you legalists leave them alone and then over here with with the with the uh with the new Believers they're saying hey don't offend these longtime believers because it's important to them it's a mutual respect it's just it's beautiful so when they were dismissed let me let me go back and I forgot the one about fornication these people may not have been brought up right in their homes and then sleeping around with the young people and doing that he put that in there because that's going to destroy your life they may not have been it may not have been important to them but Paul but uh James and the Brethren are trying to protect them so when they were dismissed verse 30 they came to Antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle which they had read and they rejoiced for the consolation now about this same time Paul in the book of Galatians doesn't make reference to this letter right here from the church of Jerusalem so I'm inclined to think maybe it was written Paul wrote Galatians just before maybe this letter from Jerusalem was penned maybe it was after but it is most certainly addressing the same thing so let's go to Galatians chapter 1. now remember Paul is addressing this legalism that was brought into the church and that's what this whole book this whole letter is about and you can feel a spirit as you read this letter from Paul you can feel it's it's a it's a spirit of frustration in Paul you can feel maybe there's anger in there because some of the things that he says he he says you foolish Galatians in one place he says have you so so soon forgot what I taught you you got mixed up in all this listen to this Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him up from the dead I didn't come from any church I didn't come from any Seminary I came from God to give you this message he hits he hits it hard right away and all the Brethren which are with me under the churches of galatia Grace be to you and peace from God the father and from the Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from the present evil world according to the will of God and our father to whom be glory forever and ever amen I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel wow he gets right to business here I'm so I'm I'm Amazed that you're so you you so quickly leave what I've already taught you which is not another but there be some that trouble you these troublemakers and would pervert the gospel of Christ and as I said before the gospel in its nature the gospel of Christ in its nature is deeply offensive because it comes with unmerited Grace you don't have to do anything for this it's not like anything anyone had ever heard you can't do anything to earn your salvation and then we see we see these these these people these different churches and they get offended when someone else in the church has a different values than they have because they dress a certain way or act a certain way or have a certain type of song service or a certain type of minister it makes them inherently better than the person who doesn't hold them say these same values that does not line up with the gospel that does not line up with Grace legalism is in direct conflict with salvation through the blood of Christ direct conflict this is not a Works based religion you can't work your way to heaven don't don't start getting mad at me saying well brother Daniel doesn't believe in in works or does it doesn't believe doesn't believe in that I do believe in Holiness I do believe that we need to live a holy life and I'm going to show you why here in a little bit brother Brahm says this in Hebrews chapter 6 he says Grace is what God did for me works is what I do for God now they'll make a Doctrine this is this is quoting brother Brandon now they'll make a Doctrine out of it they think that works is what wins your merits if it is it isn't a free gift Grace is what God did for you but by Grace you are saved and works is what you do in appreciation for the grace that he has showed you and if you love him you like to do the works of the Lord now we get to verse 8 in Galatians chapter one but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that's which we have preached unto you let him be accursed Paul says we don't forget there's Barnabas with him and these other brothers and you can see that they were in one Accord preaching the same message and it's not enough for Paul to say don't listen to these troublemakers he escalates it to let him be cursed something out if he says anything that's outside of this message of Grace that that we have preached that word curse is a strong word in in Greek it's anathema you are completely cut out you're gone you're cursed and as we said before so say I again now if any man preach any of the Gospel unto you than that which ye have received let him be accursed says it again for do I now persuade men or God I don't care what people think is what Paul's saying I could care I know I'm going to get persecuted for this Paul's saying I know this doesn't line up with all of the the dogmas that that are you're being taught or do I seek to please men for if I yet please men I should not be I should not be the servant of Christ this Curt this curse is prevalent friends in the churches ministers will preach Doctrine not because they are receiving a certain sermon from the Lord but because it fits the church doctrine it fits the message narrative that's why they preach it everybody says amen yay you know keep keep it coming it's it's lining up perfectly with what I think it's not what Paul said Paul said do I please men or do I please God let's go to Galatians chapter 2. let's start with with verse 3. now again he's addressing the circumcision thing he says but neither Titus who was with me being a Greek was compelled to be circumcised and because of false Doctrine unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our Liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage remember who he's talking about so these men in galatia probably an Antioch in particular they brought this Doctrine and Paul is saying listen that's bringing you into slavery slavery to who slavery to them slavery to what that pastor says slavery to what the group says and and I I think that we need to be careful I'm not against listening to other ministers and other churches I do I enjoy it it's a blessing to me but we have to be careful about outside Church influences influencing us and how we think we are a sovereign body we are operating independently just like the church in Antioch and we elect our own boards we elect our own pastor and we should be operating as I said independently but collectively with other believers in other parts of the country loving one another working together but no you do not dictate what is said in this church or the doctrine said in this church the Holy Spirit deals directly with us let's skip to verse 12. now this is Peter Paul or Paul here in the book of Galatians he's he's addressing something that happened with Peter he said for before that a certain came from James before these guys came from Jerusalem Peter ate with the Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew himself and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision circumcision he was afraid he was afraid that as a minister Buddies might say something against him he was afraid of going against the grain and the other Jews dissembled likewise with him in so much that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimilation look at the influence of this good man Even Adam Barnabas but when they but when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel I said unto Peter before the before all of them if thou being a Jew lives after the manner of the Gentiles and not as the Jews do why compel us thou the Gentiles to live after the Jews for who are the Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles so he's saying here hey for you legalists that have lived this way don't stop living that way but also don't forget that you're just as bad of a sinner as anyone else knowing that a man is not justified by The Works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ amen even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by Faith by the Faith of Christ and not by The Works of the law for by The Works of the law shall no flesh be justified do you realize how offensive that was to the Jewish people do you realize what what an offense this gospel is he's saying oh yeah you keep the law that that's been going on for 1500 years you believe this and and and you live your life like this according to all these Commandments oh by the way you can't be saved for doing that a direct conflict of what they thought they thought this is how I get to heaven is by doing all of these Works Paul's like no because you failed and you know you failed every one of us has failed but it's by Grace this is a message of Grace that Paul is preaching you know and let me read that again for by The Works of the law shall no flesh be justified so then I've heard people say I've had this conversation about all of our our so-called message dogma and all this well then why don't why don't I just throw it all out and why don't I just start going having beers with my buddies I'm wondering with it with the sisters why don't I just dress like like to attract men in the wrong way put myself out there why don't I just do that or for the brothers why don't I just hit the clubs partying drinking all of that ask you let's say free all to do that what spirit would be inside of you that would want to do that let me tell you something just following rules ain't gonna do you any good if you have that spirit now for the for the older folks well brother Daniel if you if you're what's saying if what you're saying is right brother Daniel or brother Paul if what you're saying is right then what do I even worry about praying why can't I just sit around watch TV all day for the older ones why can why do I have to worry about praying why do I have to worry about reading my Bible why do I have to do do this I'm saved anyways by grace what is inside you that wants to do that it's the core that's the problem it's not a bunch of rules that's doing you any good but if we but if verse 17. but if while we seek to be justified by Christ we ourselves are found Sinners is therefore Christ the minister of sin God forbid so if you get rid of all the rules and all the legalism and all of that which we should then how are you going to live your life what's going to be guiding you there's something that has to guide us for if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor Paul's addressing he's like I I I brought this message to you and I'm not going to tear it down for though for I I through the law am dead to the law for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live not yet I I love this this is it for through the law I'm dead to the law that I might live unto God I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain so we see Paul here he's addressing this with this letter to the Galatians countering that Doctrine he's saying in verse 18 that I already preached against this against this legalistic Doctrine and if I go back to what I said then I make myself a transgressor for if I build the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor I've said before that the greatest witness that we have as a body is our Unity is our love for one another Jesus Christ prayed that and I see here Paul is saying in verse 20. I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God first righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain you cannot work your way to heaven it says it over and over and over and over you can't do it let's go to Galatians 3. let's go to verse 26. verse 25. for after that faith has come we are no longer under a school master for a year all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Juno Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seed and according to the promise do you understand that Abraham what's that song it says Father Abraham had many sons many sons had Father Abraham you know that's I learn it when you're a kid you know what that means it doesn't mean that we're sons of Abraham or that we're even his descendants you know that you know if we want to check our genealogy or whatever you know they do the the thing and and you want to trace it all the way back you might not have the DNA of Abraham but it doesn't matter right brother Aaron if ye be Christ's then you are Abraham's seed and according to the promise so then we can say I am a son of Abraham I am of that faith I am of that Covenant because I accept Christ in another place it says that it's speaking of one and that's Christ that's Jesus is the son of Abraham and if we be his sons then we are Abraham's sons let's skip to chapter five Paul that brother is I think the best writer that has ever walked the Earth that has ever picked up a pen some of the things that he says wow they're so inspiring chapter 5 verse 1. oh wait till the brothers get it up there yeah listen to this Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage speaking of that legalistic Jewish rule behold I Paul say unto you that if you be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing for I testify again that every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law so he's obligated if he's saying that I believe this message every word which of course they do believe but please understand what I'm saying don't say that I don't believe or that I'm trying to get us to come away from what the prophet taught I'm not and Paul said the same thing don't think that I'm trying to pull back from what Moses said but he says that I testify to every man that has circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law he is obligated to keep the whole law to do it all let me read a quote to you my brother Branham said he said this in for the Jordan if we could do Christ is revealed in his own word that's what's the matter with our country today the reason we got so many loose leaf things in the Earth today the penalties are not strong enough if a man was caught running out with another man's wife they should both be taken out in public and castrated right in public and turn loose that's right if a man is caught doing anything wrong down the road speeding he ought to be given less than 10 years his premeditated murder you see you put penalties like that on you'll slow them down you read that no brother Dan I'm not I'm not a legalist well I believe in this this and this and this but I don't think I'm going to believe that part I think I'll throw that out we have no right Paul is saying right here if you're going to do it if you're going to live this life live it all and the same thing right here was something as simple as speeding 10 years I don't see why we don't have all the message Believers putting along at the speed limit are you gonna do it or not brother Brown said this and that uh that quote brother Jordan I don't know if you put it up there I asked you to print but I don't think I gave it to him it says this and influences 1964 it says I think that it behooves us tonight to think about that for every man woman boy or girl that knows you're coming to the judgment you might escape this or that or the other you might beat the income tax you might escape the eternal revenue you might do one thing or another you might have to run you might have run over the speed limit and the cops never catch you but one day judgment is going to catch you that's certain speaking of speeding but we just throw that part out because of Grace we want Grace when it doesn't line up with our Doctrine or that we don't want to do it and I'm not telling you how to drive I'm trying to make a point another one brother Branham said you shouldn't never miss church brother I don't it's Grace wait a minute he said you shouldn't miss church but yet we're going to try to pound this other stuff on everybody brother Brown said for no reason oh I sent that one to you I'll read it now if you have to miss work to hear to be with us and pray with us and so forth you have to miss work that's right go ahead and miss work but don't you miss church don't you miss church I won't make you late enough to miss church but if you do have to miss work once in a while that won't hurt because because work that's just your daily bread and you the Lord promised to provide that but this you must really be sure to come to church I'm trying to make a point if you're going to try to live this legalistic lifestyle do everything don't miss anything but let me tell you something you'll fail and if you if you're counting on that you'll go to hell there is Grace that is there skip to uh let's skip to verse 13 in chapter 5. for Brethren you have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion do the flesh but by love serve one another now listen to this you talk about Grace we're talking about Grace versus the law listen to this for the law is fulfilled in one word now Paul's going back and saying No Moses is writing he's he's the he's writing the truth for the law is fulfilled in one word even this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself here he's showing the difference that if you really receive Christ and you understand that you are saved by grace you will receive a new love but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another this I say walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to another so that you cannot do the things that you would now we have two Natures here at Battle we have the nature of the old Daniel Evans The Sinner and then we have the nature of the new Daniel Evans that has the Holy Spirit the old Daniel Evans there it's Disobedience it's rebellious and then we have the new and look what these Spirits produce but if ye be led of the spirit then you are not under the law for the works of the flesh are manifested which are these adultery fornication uncleanliness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance Emulsion emulations wrath Strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revelings and such the like all of that garbage of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in times past they which do those things shall not inherit inherit the kingdom of God wow so Paul is here he says Grace Grace Grace but why are you sinning why would you why would you do these evil things and what he's saying is that there is a new birth there's a change that comes upon that Christian and it goes from a set of rules that's always pointing fingers and condemning everybody else to now there is Grace there and there is that love and now it's it's you don't have to have a set of rules because those rules are like Jesus standing right here and you know what if it doesn't fit in the rules am I going to do it whoa Jesus Christ is standing right there seeing everything that I do you know what he's closer than standing there he's inside over here and he's condemning me if I go and I tell a lie or I say something against a brother or a sister that Holy Spirit Within Me is the law and it says you're wrong don't do that and I can say I can take well let me see here the 600 nope it's not there I can do it no you can't I don't care if it's not written in the law the Holy Spirit within you brings this Holiness the Holy Spirit within you makes these decisions I remember my uh being a dad with daughter with a daughter and my my daughter would come and and with her clothes and whatever and and I'd say sweetheart now um why don't you not wear that but daddy is below my knees I mean I don't care if it's below your knees you don't no it doesn't matter to me one bit if it's below your knees it doesn't no I don't care the Holy Spirit within dad says no you can't wear that I don't care if it meets the rules and these sins friends this legalism that we have you know what it does it it introduces sin into our lives because there's always a way to get out of the rules but that Holy Spirit that was was is within us we don't want to get away from him we don't want to deceive him we don't want to break his rules or his laws that Holy Spirit dictates what we say and what we do in closing Galatians chapter 6. brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault listen to Grace listen to Grace here how quick we are to condemn each other Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault remember the holy spirit said now it's replaced the law ye which are spiritual you that have the Holy Spirit you that understand this gospel you which are spiritual restores such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted you're no better than anybody else Grace legalism condemns and points the finger says look at him look at her look at that look at this look at look at all the other clothes and look at what he does when he's off legalism points the finger Grace says I'm a sinner too come to the Lord Jesus come to him he'll forgive both of us I'm no better than you are how many people from all these churches how many people were hurt over the years and left because they got offended because they were treated wrong how many people did how many people were gone because we cut them out through legalism a lot of good that did for the body of Christ Paul here says you bring them back Barrel ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ Paul sums it up right there Christ bore our burdens and if we're calling ourselves Christians and we'll bear each other's burdens skip to verse 13. for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh I wish I had time to go into this how many of us witness to people and how many of us want to lead someone to the Lord and want to and want to get them to come to church just because we want them to be like us we want a trophy that says oh I let her I let her to the Lord no it never works you get them to Christ and then that same Christ that's in you will be in them and then that soul is saved you want to get them to you want to get them to church so you can say I'll let this person the Lord that doesn't work that's why we see very few converts today it's because our hearts aren't right but God forbid that I should Glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world for in Christ Jesus if the musicians would come for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature but a new born again believer but a changed soul this is the climax of this whole letter to the Galatians this is his this is his closing statement for the legalists you're no better for the new believer you're not better because you understand Grace the most important thing is that you become a new creature in Christ for as many as walk according to this rule ah now we have a rule if you want to rule gotcha you got one for as many as walk according to this rule peace be upon peace Beyond them and mercy and upon the Israel of God for henceforth let no man trouble me for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus Paul God bless his heart I cannot wait to meet that man Paul says here he says oh you're talking about circumcision you know when you're eight days old take a knife and and do this let me tell you about the marks that are on my body he could take off his shirt and see those stripes that he was beaten for this message he could you could look at his face and see where he was stoned at lystra until he was dead with rocks I guarantee you there were scars all over him bosses circumcision let me show you what the marks of Jesus Christ are let me show you what the marks of God are [Music] you close this brethren the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit amen so why am I preaching this I'm not preaching anything new it's already it was preached 2000 years ago why am I saying this I'm saying this because these doctrines that we've developed over the years they're the doctrines of men I'm saying the same thing that our brother is saying here and when we do that we discount the new birth we discount the Holy Ghost and we replace it with a bunch of rules do I say that oh it's okay to live worldly no the opposite if you truly receive this Holy Spirit you will live like Christ lived and it's far better than a bunch of rules and regulations you'll live like Jesus Christ for you young people kids I want to tell you something how you make a decision all right do I have your attention Bella you with me here's how you make every decision Olivia got your attention whatever you do the Bible says whatever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus so when you make a decision if you decide to go out with this boy or you decide to go out with this girl or you were trying to figure out where to where to take them or you're trying to figure out where to go to school you're trying to figure out all these things ask with the Lord Jesus do this with the Lord Jesus approve of what I'm doing and if he would then do it if he would not then don't do it that's called the Holy Spirit operating but if we try to set the law like these brothers when they came from Jerusalem it causes division and friends this church has experienced that just like every other Church I'm talking about historically this one people have left because they've been hurt because fingers have been pointed at them but you see Christ his arms are open bro his arms are open come come to a place that loves you and then we introduce them to the Lord like I do with my kids introduce them to the Lord Jesus and then he governs their life and then the holy spirit is operating then Lord I've accomplished my task I've been there and that's what this pulpit foreign to me as long as it pleases the Lord and his people for me to be here you're going to hear about Jesus I I see so many people they say well well if we just preach Jesus then what separates us from all these other people why do you want to be separated you see Christ up there you see God the Father up there looking down upon his children and says yeah I like it when they separate are you are you saying this saying that well we're the only ones that are saved we're the only ones that really belong to Jesus no you're not we come to Christ and that is our Common Ground yeah of course we know more we we've been given as as maybe the Disciples of Paul we've been given more so we have more to be responsible for but it's the same Christ we can live a life that that is pleasing to the Lord we can and this other person that's that's living a life that we might judge him and say that's not pleasing Lord you're doing this this and this and this the same blood of Jesus Christ covers both if they would accept Christ we're going to end up in the same place nobody's any better than any other you cannot work your way to heaven even though we want to we want to say I'm going to give up this I'm going to give up that I'm going to stop doing all these things remember I've preached this before it is not what you don't do for God that pleases him it's what you do for him you be up and doing you be active in these things and I I see families friends and uh just before we close it's just I feel it on my heart that there's families here that maybe the husband doesn't see the things that the wife sees or maybe maybe the the husband sees things that maybe the wife doesn't see and we see friction between the family with children we see maybe we say well my child doesn't doesn't believe or or he's not he's not a real believer don't ever say that when that friction is there let me ask every one of you every one of your parents every one of you had been on the earth a little while does preaching to someone does telling them that you need to do this this and this and this how has that worked out for you [Music] has it been successful no it never will you know what's successful is what Paul said let me sum it up and one thing is Paul said love one another that's when you will win someone is you be that love you be that Jesus Christ not pointing your finger not being the legalist like these brothers came but you be the Paul that loved that lived a life probably better than anyone at his time but he didn't say that he loved you brothers that want a Godly wife be a Godly husband to her you sisters I want a Godly husband be a Godly wife I'm always condemning each other the condemnation doesn't work are we together legalism is something that destroys Fellowship it separates us and it needs to stop if you see someone that isn't living like you think they should live get on your knees and quit pointing a finger because when you point a finger guess what you're according to this book you're condemned [Music] really one more thing who was The Sinner when Jesus was here who was the dirty filthy sinner when Christ was here was it the prostitute mentally ill Mary Magdalene the filthy sinner who was it was it Mary of Bethany the one that had slept around and done all that she had done was it her was it the woman at the well [Music] that was that that she lived immorally was it the woman that was caught in adultery in the very Act of it that was about to be stoned was it her was it Matthew the lying cheat that cheated his own people was it him who was the dirty sinner or was it the Pharisee the preacher in the Pulpit saying condemning all of these people for not living a life who when Jesus was here who was the filthy one [Music] there was there was a group over here that I just mentioned that a soft tender heart that were willing to give their hearts to the Lord and then there was another one even though he lived that law [Music] he wasn't he was full of condemnation who was the filthy one it was the one Pharisee the sadducee and the pulpit that was condemning and he's the one that crucified
