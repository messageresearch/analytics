the johnsons this morning is that correct you guys want to come on up let's keep singing that chorus there what a day that will be when my jesus [Music] see [Music] thank you [Music] it's like i want to thank the lord i want to give a testimony to him because he did something so great um when we moved here my kids they we gave them the choice they were very close to finishing college they had scholarships and things and they chose they said no we want to be in the house of the lord so they came with us and i just thank god because we didn't know i know the pastor preached um dingy faith i don't know if that's what you call it but we just said well we're going to apply it's last minute and we missed all the deadlines for everything but we're just going to apply and see what happens and long story short we just pressed and pressed and pressed and pressed until the very last moment and we had we couldn't do it we couldn't pay for it because it was out of state and it was triple the amount they didn't get any scholarships and so we even went as so far to unenroll them and then i called and i said to the lady who is in charge of the determining whether you're in or out of state and i said i'm sorry we just can't pay it so um what do we do to make sure that we can get in state for next year and she said oh you live here i said yes and she said you're all here i said yes she said no you qualify for in-state and i said well we already unenrolled our children and she said oh that's okay call the admissions and within like an hour they're back in school they have all their classes everything is taken care of everything is paid for and what it taught me in my heart because when we unenrolled i was really sad but i was really happy because i proved to the lord that we don't worship education we're trusting in god and i think you know press education college college you know get a good job like that's really a in our society that's a very big focus and for my kids they work so hard but in their world that is their future they did give up everything that to them that was their everything so um i just thank god the whole like i was really sad for them but i was happy that god proved our hearts but in the same time i was like god i just really believe that you could you taking care of everything just the testimony would be too large to tell but it's like you did i really believed you could do this like i just knew it and i woke up with the same feeling i just really believed you were gonna take care of this somehow i don't know but um so i think god because he is a restorer no matter what you think you're giving up for god and you don't know what's going to happen he's you you don't know just trust him because he's going to restore and then some so i thank god [Applause] [Music] you may ask me why [Music] is [Music] and i hear the angels [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] my [Applause] [Music] it's been worth it just having the lord in my life living in a world of darkness you came and you brought me the [Music] [Applause] [Music] i will never go [Music] you've been my closest [Music] just having the lord in my life living in a world of darkness you came and you brought me the light man if heaven never was promised to me neither god's promised [Music] living in a wall you came of you brought me the light not if heaven never was promised to me neither god's promised to it eternally it has been worth it just having the lord in my life living in a world of darkness you came in and brought me the light but if heaven never was promised to me neither promise to live eternally it's been worth it just having the lord in my life living in a world of darkness you came and you brought me the light living in a world of darkness you came and you brought me [Applause] amen wonderful testimony lord prepare me to be a [Music] sanctuary [Music] and we're thanksgiving i'll be only sanctuary [Music] [Music] foreign me to be a sanctuary [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] r [Music] with thanksgiving i'll [Music] sanctuary [Music] for you with thanksgiving not i'm forced to but i'll appreciate it i'll say thank you lord i'll be a living sanctuary not a monument somewhere not a picture dedicated but a living a life dedicated to the lord so good to hear that testimony today god still moves god still does and we shared with you and brother johnson was told me he put about 75 applications out to tucson the phoenix area no response no response and he was working from home with the company that he worked with back in virginia they build aircraft carriers is that right brother johnson building aircraft carriers and somebody told him why don't you ask him if since you're working at home now see if you can still work at home and they said well where are you moving to tucson no problem move to tucson and work from home there so god supplies every need he's faithful so amen how many would testify god is more than able today testify he's good so we do have uh one request that was given sister rachel gladwell had sent me a text she had taken sister betty to emergency um she had the heart rate running low and the blood pressure being very erratic so she took her into er and asked us to remember her in prayer and again as as we've been informing you concerning the spanish church a lot of a lot of family over there and there's been two more deaths this last week from some of the members of the church and there's approximately i counted up today about 10 of my cousins uncles and aunts that are either in the hospital or are suffering uh quite sick from the these would be my mom's sisters my mom's brothers my uncle john uncle robert the doctors have given up on them and said there's there's no hope for them and one of brother robert chacon's brother and two sisters one of the brothers was taken in in a coma to the hospital and it's it's we need god you know i can't do this alone i could completely cover myself protect myself lock myself in the room never go out but we need god so you have a need today if you'll stand with me does god still move is he the same yesterday today and forever do you know that personally if you don't ask him say lord would you would you be that to me personally show me that you're mindful and you know sometimes we get thinking well brother so-and-so because he's a brother and he's such a christian and sister said well she's holy so god hears her no god hears the meekest the quietest the lowest the down the down-hearted the broken the very one in sin remember he's walking with his disciples towards samaria and he said i must go this way and when you think about it there was that woman at the well the woman at the wheel and i was listening to a brother speak about that and just put in a little different perspective so she came to the well at the time that she had to come because she couldn't come with the other ones because of of her lifestyle and he said i wondered what she thought of those who forced her to come at a late time she probably had not didn't have good thoughts about them they were mean to her they talked about her but she gets there at the time and god knows that he meets her at the well in her condition i've always thought the disciples he told them you go over and you get some food and i've always said i wonder if he did that on purpose because they wouldn't understood either they would have been saying does he know who he's talking to does he know her reputation and i believe brother branham says in one of the quotes he said the disciples were watching from the back and they were thinking that already but he said i know why i'm going over there i've got to go meet one of mine and then this same one runs to the city and says co come see this and let's just believe that lord as we come to you we raise our hands we open our hearts before you today lord saying i have need of you lord without you i am nothing without you i can do nothing lord we're not trusting on our own goodness our own righteousness but we're trusting to the shed blood that perfect sacrifice on calvary the accepted one for us lord works coming that way lord and we're asking for that rivers of living water lord that you promised lord that we'll never thirst again our sister betty gleidwell they're in the hospital or would you come lord in the sweetness of your spirit and just take her heart or bloodsh pressure and make them normal any nervousness any anxiousness lord maybe the thoughts going through her mind wondering and all lord would you just be that peace in our heart right now i ask the lord and every need lord that is represented here lord and our brothers and sisters and of every nation kindred tribe tongue in people lord lord we're looking to you as our help our only source of help today lord we ask it and we thank you in jesus christ's name amen amen do you love him today amen i appreciate the goodness of the lord you may be seated i spoke with brother matt yesterday and um there was a change in plans and ministering wise and so brother stephen mcnelly will be with us for both services today and god has god had ordained that already so he knows what we have need of so let's do that and brother matt in the family were as of yesterday we're still packing and those of you that have recently moved you know you know how much you have but you have no idea how much you have until you've got to move so brother matt says it's been a couple of days and he says i didn't realize we had a chemo camille accumulated so much but lord willing they'll be on the road the first part of this week and try to be in by thursday or friday and uh and be here with and being able to spend some time so when you remember that remember them in prayer as they come it's about four days of driving and he said they're not going to push it too hard and so but god is so good is he not amen so as our brother stephen makes his way out he was with us here not too long ago so whatever god has put in his heart you're drawing it today let's stand amazing grace how sweet this sound how many knows that graces that saved a wretch like me i know some of you weren't a wretch so you didn't need it but i needed it amen we appreciate that oh amazing grace how sweet [Music] like me [Music] i was praise god praise god [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] is [Music] praise the lord huh isn't the lord good you know if we were to take a little bit of time and meditate upon the goodness of god and meditate upon the things that he's done for us the things that he's brought us through and not only the things in the past but the things that he's doing right now not only the things that he's doing right now but the things that he's going to do for us in the future he says behold i i go to prepare a place and that where i am ye maybe also it's something that we have to look forward to amen praise the lord thank you musicians the lord bless you and uh don't they play so lovely huh you know yeah praise the lord yeah you know everybody within the body has a purpose and uh and here we have these these young people here and and they have gifts in their lives and here they are they're using their gifts for the glory of god they could be using their gifts for many other things and many other places but here they are in the house of the lord and using the gift that god has given them for the glory of god amen if you have your bibles turn with me to the book of deuteronomy chapter 8 and we'll read verses 1 through 6. we just greet you all this morning in the precious name of jesus christ and and it's good to be in fellowship one with another and we bring greetings from our pastor brother ron peterson there evening light fellowship in phoenix and uh he just always tells me make sure and send your greetings with the people so praise the lord deuteronomy chapter 8 and verse 1 and it says all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do so god gives commandments not just that it would go in one ear and out the other ear but that you would observe them and do those things that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the lord swear unto your fathers and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these 40 years in the wilderness now notice when god does something there's always a purpose behind it god never does anything without there being a purpose and a reason for it he says and the reason was to humble thee and to prove thee and to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his commandments are no sometimes we don't realize really what's in our heart until we're tested and tried and when our back is against the wall that's when we realize what's within within us but it takes the pressure it takes our back to be against the wall and it's not for god to know what was in our heart because god already knows what's in our hearts but it's for us to realize what is in our hearts and for us to realize where we are standing in this walk of faith amen and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live amen thy arraignment wax not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these 40 years us young people we don't uh understand that scripture so much but perhaps some of the the the more aged and the wise ones that are amongst us they can say yeah i understand that all right verse 5 thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the lord thy god chasteneth thee therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to fear him let's just pray father we have read your word and we know that your word says that the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life father we pray this morning that as we have read the letter we ask that it would be mixed with the spirit that it would be anointed by the spirit father that our hearts would receive by faith that we could receive something from you lord that would encourage us that would help us that would uplift those who are discouraged lord and perhaps if need be lord that there would be a chastening lord father god that we would know that we are children of god for we know your word says that those who you love you rebuke and you chasten we ask you bless the reading of the word to our hearts we just place this service into your hands lord for thy kingdom's glory in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may take your seats so i'd like to title this thought that i got here this morning and the title is desert places desert places now we here in arizona we are very familiar with the desert it's a hot dry extremely uncomfortable place to live in and you know from the outside looking in you would say this kind of climate and this kind of environment and this kind of heat and this kind of atmosphere was only made for one thing and and that's lizards and snakes this kind of place man i don't think that god made it for human beings to live in but he sure did you know you often think what would we do without air conditioning you know people lived here for many many years without air conditioning it just makes you wonder how they did it huh they really knew no different it was just part of life just something that they put up with but i'm thankful that i do not live in those times and it's a place where lizards and snakes you would imagine are the only things that would survive in in a desert place and it's a place where the cactus typically is the largest tree that's standing tall in the sermon planting the vine and where to plant it 1959 brother branham says thus it is with the church today that when the church gets away from the fountain of life when it gets away from the joys of salvation when it gets away from the lord god then that person becomes a sticker always finding fault sticking no sooner you come up on presbyterian i'm a methodist i'm so and so don't talk to me about that stuff a sticker it has no fruits they've gotten away from the joys of the lord they've gotten away from the goodness of salvation they've they've gotten away from the fountain of life and they're they they they haven't been walking like they should and when brother branham says what do they become they become a sticker you ever seen a cactus out there stickers they're full of stickers have you ever stood on a cactus before have you ever tried to touch a cactus before you realize what a sticker is and you realize what it does to somebody i remember one time my daughter as a couple of years back maybe two years ago and uh she had been four years of aged in and we were at our cousin's house and so it's dark outside and they they live in the outskirts of phoenix and we was getting some wood and stuff to make a fire with we had a little bonfire so we're out there and first of all we have no head lamps on and and we're out and she she's daddy's little helper you know and so everywhere i go she wants to come with me and help me and um so we're out there anyways and we're picking up firewood and and all i hear is this almighty scream and you know and i turn around mariah you know what's the matter what's going on and she didn't see the cactus and so she ended up giving a cactus a good big old hug man and so here we were and we got her and and we're picking out the cactus and everything you know out of her clothes and stuff like that and i said honey i'm sorry uh that was a major dad fail because i should have been watching you and she goes is daddy sorry to this day she doesn't let me forget it you know she always reminds me of my dad fail kids are very good at that yeah and so we find out that someone who gets away from the fountain of life someone who gets away from the lord not that they're uh in a lost condition not that they're going to hell but they've just perhaps a little bit backslidden in their walk with the lord they're they're not praying like they used to they're not going to church like they used to they're not in fellowship with god like they used to and i'm sure you know some of us could i've been there myself you could agree with me and say yeah you know what i've been there i've gotten a little cold in my walk i've i've gotten uh a little far away from fellowship with god and and i've gotten a little cold and my heart's gotten a little hardened and i've become a sticker and everywhere i go i'm just sticking everything nothing's good enough the family's not good enough the food's not good enough i don't have a good enough job and you go on and on and the weather's too hot and you find fault in everybody else what is it we become sticky we become stickers and what do stickers do best they prick people i'm sure you've gotten uh pricked by a cactus before you ever got pricked by a cactus and ah yeah that kind of hurt 20 minutes later that's real itchy what does it do it releases a little poison it releases a little something that it doesn't just prick you but after a while you're you're scratching and you're itching and ah i don't know about you guys but i i i'm married into the love all family and they're big into doterra oils uh we got an oil that'll take away that itching steven come over here we'll take care of it a little bit of essential oils they'll fix it well essential oils will not fix the spiritual life there's only one kind of oil that we need that'll fix our spiritual life and that's the oil of the holy spirit hallelujah and so we find out when we get away from the lord and we get away from doing what we know to do we become sticky we stick people how do we stick people around us we stick them by our words the words that we say against one another we find out everybody else's faults but we got so many faults of our own and here we are sitting in the pew stickers don't get too close to sticky people because they're gonna stick you amen what does he say then that person becomes a sticker always finding fault and sticking i wonder how many amongst us this morning perhaps are in that spot i'm presbyterian i'm a methodist i'm so-and-so don't talk to me about that stuff a sticker a sticker has no fruits paragraph 63 you take that same plant a cactus put it into a land for a few generations where there's plenty of water and that sticker will unfold and will come a soft leaf bearing fruit hallelujah you just got to get it in the right conditions you got to get it in the right atmosphere and when we get our lives in the right condition when we get ourselves around the right atmosphere the atmosphere of god the atmosphere of the sweetness and presence of the holy spirit guess what our lives isn't as sticky anymore our stickers they they go away and and we become a pleasant tree a pleasant fl uh plant that's bearing pleasant fruit god let me feed upon the things of god let me dwell by the waters of life let me be a tree that is planted by the rivers of water lord that i'll bring forth fruit not for myself understand when a tree brings forth fruit it's not for itself a tree does not partake of its own fruit but a tree produces fruit for everybody else to be partakers of it it's just like they were up here and they're planned the musicians and the song leader they have a gift they have a talent and they're giving that fruit for the glory of god it's not for themselves but it's for you it's for the body of christ that they might enjoy the gift of god that was placed within their lives preaching the gospel is not for me preaching the gospel is for god's children understand that it's not for the minister it's not for the preacher brother branham said because it anybody that's really called to preach the gospel he runs from it he doesn't want to do it if you were to know me uh outside of the pulpit you'll find out yo uh man he's kind of quiet uh everybody tells me yeah you look you look real um natural up there stephen well yeah it don't feel natural i tell you what we're sitting in the back i'm looking for the exit sign how do i get out of here where no one will see me run but i've learned through the experience of preaching the gospel to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations amen what's the matter with the church today paragraph 64 the same the same uh sermon it's been said into a denomination that has put denominational creeds and bound it no joy just a sprinkle now and then of a little revival to hold it what it needs to be is to come out from among scoffers and unbelievers and be planted by the rivers of water understand that's what denominations have done throughout these seven church ages they took the word of god they hacked it they added two they took away uh they they had brother branham there's a quote from brother branham says they bound the holy spirit by their creeds and their dogmas and prevent the holy spirit from moving within the churches and in the lives of the people it didn't matter what the word of god says but our denomination says this do you guys realize what a creed or a dogma is perhaps for some of the younger people it's just a belief it's just something that a man has written down and yeah we know that the bible says this that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and what he did back then he is still able to do today but this church believes that he's only the same in certain ways he's only the same in where yeah you can receive salvation but healing is no longer for the people of god and he can't heal like he used to he can't do miracles he can't do this but the scripture says see what they did was they bound the people and they said well our church doesn't believe it he's a man of god he's up there and he's a pope or a priest or whatever he may be and he's a holy man of god and and what he says must be true therefore i believe him and he's only the same in certain ways and but not the same in his fullness so what did they do now the people they take that word because they believe they're hearing from god hide it in their hearts and they say well i what's the point in asking what's the point in asking for the healing of my body what's the point in asking uh what's the point in asking my boss if i can move to tucson and still work for the same company because ah it's not going to happen ask and ye shall receive seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you hallelujah brother branham says it like this he says it's not seek just one time he says but it's keep seeking he says it's not just knock one time but you keep knocking you keep knocking when he doesn't answer the first time you keep knocking and you keep knocking until somebody answers the door seek and ye shall find keep seeking knock keep knocking and ask if you want it bad enough you'll keep asking man and it shall be given on to you i love that what is it it's a life of persistence it's a life of of of of not just seeking the lord for one day and and uh reading your bible one day after the week but it's a life of persistence and consistency that's a life that really gets far with god god don't want no half-baked christians but he wants those who are fully and fully committed hallelujah because when you're fully in something when you're fully committed to something you're in it you're in it your heart's in it your mind is in it and everything that you got within you it's in it why because you're in it i'm in it to win it man i don't just want to be some kind of some kind of chris well i'm happy i'm a christian i'm in it i want to make the rapture i want to make the rapture if it's a promise for me in this hour i want that promise to be fulfilled in my life i don't want to be happy which is saying i believe the message but i want to live it hallelujah what's the point in saying you believe it if we don't live it amen because when you really believe it when you really believe it not just a knowledge not just a head understanding but when you really believe it from the depths of your soul you know that you know it's the truth no matter what anybody says no matter who falls away no matter who walks away you know within your own heart this is the truth you live it it's the greatest sermon that you could ever preach is a sermon that is lived live your sermon and use words if you have to written epistles read of all men you know we've been ah i preached there wednesday night and there's a and there's a quote where brother branham says he goes it's that your testimony and it's your life that is going to judge this generation it's your testimony it's the testimony of our sisters and our mothers of being a good mother you know what's crazy it and it absolutely blows my mind uh when somebody sees uh like a like a famous person on the internet or whatever on on youtube whatever it may be and the person is actually a good parent they say wow it's so good to see somebody actually a good parent taking care of their kids it kind of blows my mind a little bit because i think isn't that what parents are supposed to do anyways it's supposed to be now it's now it's not normal for somebody to be a good parent that the testimony of holiness the testimony of having the the right attitude and and the right spirit uh for our sisters towards their husbands the testimony of letting your hair grow out and not cutting it that's the testimony that's going to judge this generation it's something that the world doesn't understand you know you only really find it throughout me the message how that uh our wives and the women they they come into subjection to their husbands right they respect their husbands they honor their husbands they love their husbands and by doing so they not that they lower themselves but they bring themselves under the headship of their husband it's because they are under the headship of their husband our father god but you talk about an age that we are living in where every woman wants to be the boss every woman wants to rule the roost every what every woman is uh uh i say it respectfully extremely domineering they want to have control they want to be leaders they want to be leaders in politics they want to be leaders of the country and all these different things when they see a woman who is living her life according to the word of god and bringing herself into subjection to his headship absolutely blows their mind don't you realize we're living in the 21st century those days are long gone past those days may have been long gone past but god's word is not long gone past for he is the same a testimony that'll judge this generation a testimony of a dad being a good dad a testimony of a husband being a good husband and always putting his family first putting their needs first before his own needs that's a testimony that's going to judge this generation a testimony of living a good clean life a life lived by the word of god for the day and hour in which you live is the word of god being made flesh once again just like it was through jesus christ so is it through you and i what is it god in you the hope of glory hallelujah praise the lord so we find out that dehydration is one of the main causes that people in the desert would die there was a while back a person from maricopa and he was his neighbors to part of my family out there and he was in his 70s and so he grew up around the desert and everything well anyways he got out in the car and he started driving and and he ran out of gasoline and so he get out of his car and he started walking through the desert because he thought he knew where he was well long story short he he got lost in the desert he got turned around and he ended up dying out of dehydration have any of you ever gotten thirsty before i tell you what the desert will make you thirsty you know they say whenever you uh whenever you wait until you're thirsty you've waited too long hallelujah people in the desert they die failing to find water and if we fail to drink from the fountain of life who is jesus christ and him alone you will die in your sins it doesn't matter what you believe it doesn't matter how good of a person you are or the good things that you've done even if you believe this end time message it's meeting christ that saves you it's not having an understanding of the message it's not having an understanding of the day and hour in which in which you live but it's having a relationship with jesus christ that's what saves you from your sins because what is this message all about it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever many times in our lives as christians we're going to come across periods where it seems like we are in a desert place and chances are some of you that have been around for a while and you've been saved for a while and you've been serving god for a while chances are you've been already been through a desert place in your life well what is a desert place stephen it's a dry it's a hot it's an uncomfortable situation it's an uncomfortable environment it's a place that we don't like to be too often as a desert place typically when you're in a desert place you're alone you're by yourself typically in desert places you're dry you need a drink and there's nowhere to drink from in desert places it feels like you're always all alone there's nobody with you there's nobody to comfort you and there's no one to put their arm around you what is it that's a desert place you can find no inspiration you can find no anointing all you can find is that sticky prickiness just like the cactus out there there's no anointing oil there's no inspiration there's no joy there's no love there's no peace and everything is just upside down what is it it's a desert place you know desert places are an extremely lonely place to be in are many trials in our lives that would cause us to feel like we are going through a desert place perhaps we've had a loved one who has passed on or something has happened within our lives and we could go on and on and on of the the things that could have happened within our lives that would cause us to be in such a sticky dry place but we're going to find out this morning throughout the scriptures that god uses desert places in our lives god doesn't do anything without there being a purpose behind it hallelujah so as we look through some of these scriptural examples we are going to see that god not only does god use these desert experiences in our lives but they have a purpose behind it understand that god does nothing without there being a purpose that ought to give us comfort this morning that no matter where we are in our lives right now no matter where we were in our lives in the history of our lives god has a purpose for it you know i just went hunting here this weekend up in baghdad it's archery season right now and you know the mule deer are a very kind of majestic animal uh one second you see them and next second they're gone and and god really knew what he was doing and and uh the color of their coat and their fur and stuff because man unless they wiggle their ears they're kind of hard to see or unless they jump out right in front of you you know and so i was just by myself and i was glassing and and i'd glass for a little bit and drive a little further and the thing about it is if i'm if i'm glassing under a bush or if i'm glassing one side of a hill i can only see what's in front of me but when i keep driving onward and i turn back and i glass that same hillside chances are there's a deer hitting under that same tree that i already glassed but now i'm looking back on it from a different angle and now i can see it i can see it from an angle that i never seen before so it is with our lives when we are in a desert place and we are in uncomfortable situations we don't know the purpose of god at that very time but as we go on in our lives and we begin to look back sometimes god reveals it to us and we say wow that's why i went through that trial that's why i was by myself that's why that's why and the light switch goes on ding and now all of a sudden you realize why you went through the pain why you went through the suffering but at the time of the trial man all you see is the trial you can't see the forest for all the trees or the tree for the forest whatever one it is exodus chapter three verses one through five now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he laid the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb notice the shepherd the shepherd leads the flock to the backside of the desert and the angel of the lord appeared onto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned can you imagine coming across something that seems to be on fire but it's not consumed no doubt it would attract our attention also and that's what the supernatural is for it's to catch the attention of the people and that's what brother branham's first uh two pulls in his ministry was all about it was to catch the attention of the people never was there ever a man that had uh that anybody had ever seen with the gifts that brother branham had in his life the first pull he would take them by the hand and and here there would be a a little sensation and a little bumps would come come upon his hand and he would say oh you have uh such and such a disease or you have this this wrong with you and here let me pray for you and he would pray for them and when they were healed the bumps would go away and he would say he could say with an assurance thus saith the lord you're healed of that disease you were healed of that sickness because the bumps were no longer there second pull of his ministry it takes a another step further notice that first pull was all to do with the outer man it was all to do with the flesh it was all to do with the emotions it was all to do with the sensations brother branham said ah i wish i wish i hadn't showed anybody all these stuff because now everybody's got oil and blood coming out of their hands and out of their foreheads and everybody's got a sign and what is it done all it's done is made a carnal impersonation of a true gift of god and now it goes a little deeper understand we're made up of three parts our bodies our spirit and our soul the body is the outer man has everything to do with see taste feel smell and hear but now it goes a little deeper he says what was that second pull he said it's a discernment of the hearts he said you'll you'll know the very secrets and the desires that's upon the people's hearts that's what the word of god is it's a two-edged sword cutting asunder and dividing between the bone and the marrow and it's that discernment a discerning of the thoughts and the intents of the hearts so now he would he didn't even need to it had nothing to do with the outer man he didn't need people to come up he didn't have to lay hands upon them somebody could touch could touch god they could touch god by faith not touch brother branham they could touch god by faith and he would reach down into the back of by faith he he would speak there and he would say ah there's somebody in the back and yada yada and thus saith the lord you have this on your heart and you have that and this has happened in your lives what was it it was the same god it was the same spirit but in a different manifestation now it went beyond the flesh man into the spiritual realm hallelujah what were these things for it was to catch the attention of the people god is really moving god is doing something there's this little man from kentucky and wow you ought to you ought to see the gifts that this man has that's following his ministry man can't do these things we've never seen the like of it in all our days what was it for it was to catch their attention to the third pull to the revealing of the word which goes beyond the outer court it goes beyond the inner court the tabernacle and it goes into the holiest of holies the word of god that'll never lose its power what is it that's being revealed to his bride in these last days hallelujah no because and this might be a theme that just keeps popping up in my mind right now but there's a purpose for it there's a purpose for it there was a purpose for the first two pulls but the purpose was to catch the people's attention understand things of god god has a purpose for you this morning not just for the minister not just for the song leaders not just for the musicians not just for the people that hold a position within a local body church but he has a purpose for each and every one of us and each and every one of you have a gift of god it doesn't have to be preaching it doesn't have to be it could be something as simple as saying amen to the word of god some people have a gift of giving there's a brother in our church amos peterson i i've worked for a brother amos for nine ten years and i have never met a person in my life that is such a giver as brother amos my goodness you tell him yeah i really like your hat here you go well i wasn't saying that because i want it but i really like your watch too [Laughter] it's just his nature it's just the gift that he has now i can try to impersonate that gift but i'll give begrudgingly i'll give begrudgingly you know the lord really has to get put heavy upon my heart for me to really reach out and give something like that but for amos it's it's just natural it's just how he is but what is it for it's uh its purpose is to serve the body of christ you ever notice people uh in our church when when somebody is sick or somebody has had a baby or whatever um they have like this online thing where they send out an email and they send out food to bring and it's all kind of organized right and you kind of notice and i can brag on my wife here she's often told me well i don't know uh what my gift is i said honey you have a gift to serve every time there's an opportunity every time there's a chance to make a meal anytime there's a a chance to help somebody or to do something for somebody she's there she's the first one and it's always the same people that sign up and do it and it's always the same ones that don't and the people who don't normally do it and they try to do it once in a while they never follow through that's okay it's just not their gift but my wife is there even though she's busy even though she doesn't have the time she makes the time saints of god there's never a good time to help somebody there's never a good time to serve somebody there's never a good time or an appropriate time we got to make the time one for another amen what is it as gifts within the body that god uses for the body and each one of us have a gift we get so caught up in ministering and and all the gifts that's before the people you know and it's just a little part of it it's just a little part of it we are all part of the same body and we all have a purpose to serve that body in any way that we can amen amen yes lord verse 4 exodus 3 and when the lord saw that that he turned aside to see god called on to him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hither put up thy shoes from thy feet for the place where i'll now stand is holy ground moses was raised in the house of pharaoh moses looked like an egyptian he talked like an egyptian and he was taught as the egyptian children were taught but at an appointed time he realized that that's not who he really was though he might have acted like one and he was raised like one and he perhaps even he talked like an egyptian but at god's appointed time he realized i am not an egyptian i am not part of this community i am not part of their culture i am a jew and these are my people and this is what's happening to my people who i who i really should be associated with and he turned and he turned to try to help the egypt the jewish people so it is with every seed of god we were raised in the world we were born in the world we were born in sin our lives was shaped in iniquity we came to the world speaking lies sinners to begin with but at an appointed time at an appointed time we realized i may be of this world but i may be in this world but i am not of this world i don't belong here this i might look like the world and i might have dressed like the world and i might have stank like the world but at an appointed time god had an appointment with me at an appointed time god had an appointment with you and he told you who you really are hallelujah as sheep can can act like a pig and smell like a pig and can roll in the dirt and everything like a pig but you give that sheep a bath one time you'll find out that it's not a pig it's really a sheep so it is with every son and daughter of god when we're washed by the water of the word by the water of separation we realize i'm not of this world i'm not a pig i'm a sheep why because it's an appointment from god almighty god has an appointment with every predestinated son and daughter of god and god keeps all of his appointments hallelujah yeah he's never late you know you know we're bound by time that's our problem we are bound time creatures yeah god is not bound by time he is an on-time god you know that little song he's a non-time god yes he is oh he's an on-time god yes he is he's an on-time god might not what's the rest of the words of that song do you guys know what you guys don't know that song might not come when you want him but he'll be there right on time he's an on time god yes he is i'm sure the three hebrew children thought he was late coming into the fiery furnace but he was just on time i'm sure daniel and the lion's den thought that god was late but he's never late for any of his appointments and so it is with us it seems like god is late in coming on the scene but he is an on-time god and he keeps all of his appointments thank you lord at the age of 40 moses fled egypt after slaying a man in the wilderness or he fled to a desert place and it was there that god got a hold of moses by the way of the burning bush brother branham said that it took god 40 years in the backside of the desert to unlearn moses of the 40 years that he had learned while in egypt 1957 faith brother branham says how that moses after having 40 years of religious training by his mother by his mother how having 40 years of military might in his hands of how to whip a nation how to conquer and taken god 40 years to take it out of him but once out there in the wilderness alone what was god doing to moses in the wilderness he was taken away all of his previous learnings one day he come face to face with god in a burning bush and he was better equipped in five minutes after he had talked with god than 80 years of schooling had done anything to him he was a coward dying a thousand deaths and after meeting god he wished he had a thousand lives to die to die for christ he was ready to go there was nothing could stop him though he had no army through his edu though his education was no good to him moses slayed an egyptian living off of his mother's revelation or understanding that god was going to use him to deliver the children of israel it was his mother's revelation it wasn't his own revelation it was an understanding that he had it was a head knowledge that god was going to use him and so he said well if god is going to use me i'm going to take matters into my own hands and he saw the the egyptian uh treating the jewish person harshly what did he do we took matters into his own nature to his own carnal hands and he slayed that egyptian what did it what did it do what did it profit it did nothing but make a stinking dead egyptian why because he was living off of a carnal understanding but when he got into the presence of god almighty when he got into the presence of god and he met god face to face and brother branham says in five minutes he knew more of god than in all of his previous years of learning then he knew to wait on god then he knew that it wasn't going to be him doing it but it was going to be god taking care of business it would be god going before him it would be god coming after him it'll be god doing it therefore it has nothing to do with you and i my brother my sister it has everything to do with god god doesn't need our help to bring his promises to pass he will bring him to pass at his appointed times we can't live off of other people's revelation you know david tried to do it one time there was a man and his name was goliath and he was a giant he was one of the biggest man in the land and he was a soldier from his youth perhaps he had slain hundreds of men and everybody was scared of him and here he was he was making this bragg and he was telling the children of israel bring down your greatest soldier and the one that slays the other one will be servants one to another and here was saul this is amazing saul was head and shoulders above all of the people of of israel but yet he was shaking in his boots oh he's out there again i gotta use the restroom he's always hiding he's always trying to get away from it he's always trying to hide from uh from this goliath and here was this little bitty guy david david had a revelation but saul tried to give david his own ecclesiastical knowledge well son if you're gonna go out here and and you're gonna you're gonna fight this guy uh let me tell you here's my armor he wasn't using it he's too scared to use it here's my armor here's my sword here's the things that i fight with here take my stuff and no doubt saul being head and shoulders above everybody no doubt the armor didn't fit him very good you guys some of you guys are kind of taller i'm shorter you know if i was to put you those of you that are tall if i was to put your jacket on huh be down over my hands and trailing off the ground i can't preach in your jacket because i'd look like a fool here was david out here he was going out to meet goliath with somebody else's jacket on somebody else's revelation was somebody else's understanding it didn't fit him it didn't fit it was too big it was just a carnal understanding and finally he got to a place he said forget this this doesn't belong to me he had a revelation he said the same god that was with me when i slew the bear the same god that was with me when i slew the lion that same god is with me now i have the same weapon that i had when i salute those two and i'm gonna use that same weapon i don't need your carnal understanding i don't need your head knowledge but i got a revelation that the god that was with me then is the god that is with me right now because he's an on time right now god and he's with me goliath would have slew david if he went in somebody else's revelation with somebody else's understanding but he stood upon his own revelation my brother and my sister you can't live your life off of somebody else's revelation it's got to be your revelation it can't be mom and dad's it can't be the pastors it can't be your neighbors it can't be your uncle but it's got to be your own revelation because when it's your own revelation when you're by yourself and you have to stand and fight alone you will fight because it's yours god help us lord let it go from the understanding of the mind and let it go into my heart because out of the heart that's what our manifestations come from is from our heart lord let me live from my heart lord increase my revelation hallelujah it's only by revelation you can overcome and you know that there's a quote where brother branham says he's talking on adultery and he says you know he's talking about the outer man and the and the and the inner man he says you could say i know i'm not supposed to commit adultery i know it i'm a christian i know the word says it i know my pastor says it but it's out here and it's here it doesn't come from the soul because the soul controls the spirit which controls the body it's the nature of each one right he says but when it comes from that control tower from the heart he says that brings everything else into subjection and he goes you don't just know because he says well i know i shouldn't do it but they go out and do it anyway because it doesn't come from the control tower it's just an understanding but when it comes from the control tower when it comes from your heart i know i'm not supposed to do it therefore i'm not going to do it why because it's a revelation you see the difference in an understanding and a revelation god increase our revelation amen notice where he was here where moses was he was at the backside of the desert what was the purpose of moses being in the backside of the desert it was for him to meet god face to face and it was because of his previous choices of slaying that egyptian that took him there saints of god you might have made some bad choices in your lives but understand that those who are called of god and according to his purpose god will use your choices to bring about his will don't let your past dictate your future some of you need to give stop giving yourself such a hard time and you don't know steven what i did you don't know how much of a rascal i was you don't know what i did yesterday you don't know what i did when i was a child you don't know my previous it's true i don't but if you believe in the blood of jesus christ it cleanses us from all of our sins and all of our iniquities that's satan trying to use your past to prevent you from having a closer walk with god in your present day life stop it amen we find out that so we find out there that um in that same mount that mount horeb where moses led led his sheep to the backside of the desert which is also called mount sinai that that's where god gave moses the ten commandments what was this desert place for what was the purpose for it in moses's life it was for god to reveal himself to him and to reveal also his word to him it was to meet god face to face and it was there in that same mount that god gave him the ten commandments what was it for to reveal himself and to reveal his word to him hallelujah paul was on the road to damascus one day he was persecuting the church we all know the story there was a light appeared from the heavens and it said unto him saul saul why persecute us thou me notice it was the same voice that had spoken to moses moses moses saul saul and saul being a devout jew he knew not to call that light anything but lord he knew the teachings here was this supernatural light a supernatural experience was happening a supernatural being was talking to him and he said lord who are you i want to know you have been i've been serving and i've been religious my whole life but i don't know you lord who are you he said i am jesus whom now persecutest it's hard for you to kick against the pricks huh what was he doing i am jesus the i am of the old testament was the father above us he changed his mask he changed his form what was that was that word called ah oh it goes from my mind right now uh that greek word where god he he changes his mask and he changes his form he huh and morpha that's it see i'm glad we got some we got some scholars in here some men that are in the message to help young men like me out when my mind goes blank huh he and morpha he changed his mask not a different god it was the same god the i am the father above us he led the children of israel he was in morpha he changed his mask to jesus the son of god with us understand god doesn't expect someone else to continue his work but he continues to work himself it was the father above us god with us and now it's god in us what's he doing all the time he's changing his form he's changing his mask and then more continue the work of god it's not us doing the work it's not the ministry that perfects the saints it's god the holy ghost in the ministry that's perfecting the saints if any man gets up and tells you that he's the one that's perfecting you and it's it's his ministry that's perfecting you and outside of him uh you're lost you run from that man as fast as you can it's not the man it's god that's what's wrong these days i think you know man they uh brother branham said uh god uses a man and he blesses his ministry a little bit and all of a sudden he gets uh high he gets puffed up in a stuffed shirt thinks he's the one that's doing it it's not him it's god that's doing it god help us to stay humble huh sure above us god with us and now god in us you know that light it blinded the eyes of paul it blinded his eyes to the situations around him and everything that was going on he he couldn't see until finally that i believe it was cornelius had to come and he had to pray for saul he had to pray for him to restore his sight god had to blind saul that he might see spiritual things let me just say this this morning lord blind our eyes to the things of the world father blind our eyes to the fashions and the music and all these different distractions coveted 19 and politics and all these different things lord blind my eyes to these things that my supernatural eyes might be opened because these are just natural things that's designed to take our eyes off of what god is actually doing in the spiritual realm god help us genesis uh galatians 1 15-17 but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son and me that i might preach him among the heathen i immediately conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them that were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again into damascus paul never went to jerusalem but instead he went to arabia and and and and what was the purpose of it it was to search the scriptures concerning christ christ is mystery of god revealed 63 paul went down then until he got all his ecclesiastical stuff cut off of him down to the backside of the desert for three and a half years where was he he was in arabia the backside of the desert for three and a half years and he become a prisoner here we come back in chains of love all my seminary experience is gone i'm a prisoner to jesus christ amen philemon my brother i'm a prisoner of jesus christ i can only speak and say what he tells me god help us to lay aside our own thoughts and interpretations of what this prophet said and just say what he said on those tapes amen for if we all say what he said on the tapes we leave our own impersonate our own uh uh our own reasonings and our own uh knowledge out of it guess what we'd all be saying the same thing he said say what i said on those tapes hallelujah that's what i can base my doctrines off of amen i've been uh preaching a little bit on on the body and spirit and soul and and a person i got sent a little clip to me a little video and it was off this is from years and years ago i don't know how long ago but and it was of a brother and he was giving um a testimony of what another brother told him of what brother branham shared with him and um and it was nice and everything like that of what you know the carnal nature and everything and my response was this is just very interesting but i can't preach that for doctrine because he never said it on tape he said say what i say on those tapes i think that's where we can get mixed up sometimes somebody all have you ever does anybody know what chinese whispers is steven um stephen stephen uh through a three-pointer basketball that'll never happen okay but i did it stephen threw hey did you hear that steven threw a three-pointer with his eyes closed he did hey did you hear that steven threw a three-pointer with his eyes closed with his back turned to the basket and before you know chinese the story is so elevated and and everything like that to where yes stephen turner three-pointer was true but now all this other stuff is added to it i feel like that's what happens a lot of times nothing wrong with testimonies right nothing wrong with those things but one person tells it to someone and someone tells it to another person and someone tells it to another person perhaps the facts are right but there's so much added to it you can't preach it for doctrine you've got to say what he said on the i'm so thankful so thankful that this voice was recorded that we could hear it for ourselves saints of god you don't have to wait to hear it from the minister but you can hear it yourself in your own homes in the coldness of the evening when god walked through the midst of the garden we can listen in the cool of the evening with our ac on in our house and it's nice and cool we can listen to that voice that was ordained by god to turn our hearts back to the faith of the original fathers and when you come to church when you come to church and the preacher he uses a quota or he has a line of thought that he's using you can say hey man brother i believe that for i heard him say it myself why because you've been doing your homework i'm begging i don't want to just repeat what another minister says but i want to get it fresh from god myself hallelujah and then when i'm in church and i'm enjoying service and the preacher saying something and i know i've heard it before i can say amen that's the truth because i heard it on the tapes amen what was god doing to paul in the desert of arabia he was revealing himself to paul through the scriptures that jesus was the messiah what was god doing to him he was revealing himself to him later on paul was in another desert place in his life a lonely and dark place he was thrown into jail for the testimony of jesus christ and preaching in his name and it was from this jail that paul wrote much of the new testament scriptures god uses desert places to reveal his word he uses desert places to reveal himself to you to make himself known to you and he uses desert places to reveal to you his word hallelujah you know when our day has been no different brother branham ever since he was a little boy he was never satisfied with the country that he lived in and longed somehow to go west remember he always wanted to go west and even an astronomer lady told him that he would never be successful in the east but to move west within the scriptures the high priest would enter the tabernacle that would be from the east because the gate was on the east side they would enter in from the east and they would walk towards the tabernacle which was on the west he would enter into the tabernacle he would perform his duties as a high priest he would come out he would turn around from the west and he would go back to the east once again god has done something the exact same in this our day from the high priest of this church age brother branham here he was in the east he was born and he was raised in the east the tabernacle the the branham tabernacle was in the east but there was always something within him that he longed to go out west ever since he was a little boy and hear god he brought him out west what was the purpose for it it was for god to reveal himself to him to catch him up in a in a cloud in a constellation of angels that he may receive the revelation of the seven seals not that he would stay in the west but he would take that revelation and he would come out of the tabernacle where the very presence of god was he would come from the west back to the east and he would preach the revelation of the seven seals my god makes no mistakes the seventh seal because before we even went into it and i left to go west the lord showed me a vision one day about ten o'clock one morning and i come and explained it here that i had seen it you know i you know that's one of the things i really love about brother branham when he when he's seen something or he had a vision he told us about it he didn't wait for it to come to pass and then tell us well i told you so he really threw it out there he's like i i've had this vision and this is going to happen and i'm going to go west and this is going to happen and months later however long it was it actually happened it's not like people nowadays they have a dream they have a thought they have something they put it on youtube and they wait for the thing to happen first yeah yeah it happened i had a dream about this three years ago oh praise the lord why didn't you tell us three years ago about the dream you know what i mean that's one thing about brother branham he didn't wait until it happened but he seen the vision he had the dream he told it and then it came to pass yeah uh didn't know what it was it was a constellation of seven angels remember that you'll get it on tape what time is it sir well now that is exactly what you're seeing now the seven angels i was in the west you remember the little bitty messengers they went east the second messengers the doves a little bit larger bird they went east then they was they was with me all the time that was the first and second pool now the third came from the west sweeping forward with great terrific speed and they picked me up that was coming back east with the mystery of the seven seals just like it said in junior jackson's dream that the lord let me interpret for him there on the inside of that pyramid there was white stone that wasn't written on that's the reason i had to go west to connect with these angels message to come back here to reveal it to the church so he went from east to west back to east again the next things that will happen will be here at the church that's just exactly hallelujah the anointed ones at the end time notice the very day this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull healing remember say what he said on the tapes second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the mystery is revealed no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word and remember the third pool was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it what was god doing with brother branham in the desert of arizona just the same as what he was doing with moses and paul he was giving him the revelation of the word for the day in which we live three years he was in tucson and not one church invited him to preach except for brother perry started the church here brother perry greene and brother branham i believe he preached here and he dedicated the church and everything right doors were closing here he is in the apex of his ministry there's no higher order than the revealing of the word to prophets here's god revealing his word to him third poll ministry the mysteries that had been hid since before the foundations of the world whom god had never shared with before god had never shared these mysteries before sure john wrote them john seen it but he's seen it in symbol form he didn't understand it he just saw the symbols and he wrote what he saw but here was god almighty this is why the cloud experience my brother my sister is so important for the believer because it was god revealing their very thoughts that have been hidden since the foundations of the world these mysteries that no one knew anything about he was caught up into this thought caught up into the mind of god and now it was being revealed something that was never revealed before what was god doing through this cloud experience he was circumcising away the the flesh and the intellects of man remember brother branham way in his early ministry he preached the seals he says oh my goodness i was a million miles away from the truth why because he read books like uh clarence larkin his his slops to babylon and and all these and all these different men that that were very intellectual and and scholars of the day they said well that sounds pretty good perhaps i'll just preach it again along those same kind of lines and he says and then something happened in the room god met him he took away the carnal intellects of man and now he was receiving the very mind of god where would it where did it happen in a desert place hallelujah that's what god has to do to us sometimes he has to get us in a desert place where it feels like we are all alone we have no friends we don't get invited to places have you ever you ever been there feels like everybody else gets invited to something and you don't seems like everybody else gets their hands shaken but you don't you're in a group have you ever felt alone in a big church how many people's here 60 people i don't know i ever been in a congregation this size where it feels like man we should have tons of friends and and this and that but yet you feel alone you feel by yourself no one shakes your hands you don't get invited to this you don't go there and and well i i just don't fit in and therefore i just i just don't belong there so guess what i'm out saints of god is just a season we all go through seasons in our lives perhaps you're in a desert place season in your life of a desert place at the minute at the moment but understand god uses it for a purpose so don't pick up your bags and run off but just stay put because the changes they change don't they yeah yeah and there will be a time where you know what in your life you'll be like man everybody likes me everybody wants to shake my hand everybody's laughing at my jokes feels pretty good seasons change amen some simple analogies but it's things we can all relate to huh now i'll try to come to a close here but what's the purpose for it when god gets us to that place notice paul didn't confer with flesh and blood but he took himself off to meet god in a desert place whenever you feel like you're in a desert place seek the mind of god because he wants you by yourself you might be by yourself but you're never alone because he said he will never leave us nor will he forsake us it's a good time to seek his face because he's wanting to speak to you he's wanting to meet you face to face just like paul and just like moses and he's wanting to reveal his word on to you amen us throughout the scriptures wilderness our desert experiences are not always a sign that god is rebuking you but rather a time of molding and shaping your character when god had delivered israel through the red sea he led them three days into the wilderness to test their faith exodus 15 22-25 so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out in the wilderness of sure and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and they came to uh mara and when they came to mara they could not drink of the waters of mara for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called mara and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink and he cried onto the lord and the lord showed him a tree shoot shooed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them what did god prove to them that he was their provider and he is all that they need it's no difference for us today what is god doing this and society and why does he perhaps take away our jobs and do all these different things to us because he wants to prove to us that he is all that we need we don't need this world's goods we don't need this world's uh pleasures and materialistic things all we need is one thing and that's god almighty it isn't a want but it's a need you understand the difference in a want and a need i want a lot of things but what i need comes first hallelujah that's what it is that's why a lot of people are broke because they get all their wants instead of just what they need we need more of christ it's not a want but it's a need for without him i can't make it without him i can't keep myself but he is the one that keeps us yeah okay i'm gonna skip a lot of this stuff here jesus himself after he was baptized he was laid into the wilderness for 40 days to be tempted of this of satan right luke 9 verses 11 and 12. and the people when they knew it followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and healed them that had need of healing and when the day began to wear away then came the 12 and said on to him said send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country roundabout and lodge and get victuals for we here are in a desert place understand jesus does things in desert places mark 6 34 and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion towards him because they were sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things and when the day was now far spent his disciples came on to him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far past send them away that they may that they may go into a country round about and into villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat jesus would also take his disciples into a desert place that he may reveal unto them the parables that he had spoken in front of the crowds of the people you see god uses desert places in our lives it turns me again to the book of deuteronomy as the musicians come and we'll just go through this one more time here of the purpose of a desert place deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 2 and it says thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god laid thee these 40 years in the wilderness to humbly and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou would just keep his commandments or no what was the desert place experience for for the children of israel in verse 2 it was to humble you and it was to prove you to prove what you got in your heart verse 3 and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not notice it was god that did it it wasn't satan you can't blame everything on the devil you know neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know what man does not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live what was the purpose for it in verse 3 that man does not live by bread only but by every word that is written by the mouth of god verse 4 thy raiment wax not old upon thee neither did thy footswell these 40 years was he showing us in verse 4 that god provides all of your needs verse 5 thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the lord thy god chasteneth thee it was for correction what does god put us in a desert place experience for once in a while is for correction i got to thinking on correction when i was younger in my flesh i hated getting corrected i hated getting this banking i just i just didn't enjoy it it was something that was very contrary to my young life but now that i'm a christian seems like the tables have turned and i say lord correct me when i'm wrong rebuke me when i've done something that i shouldn't have done if have reacted in a way that i shouldn't have reacted lord chasten me for it rebuke me for it bring it to my remembrance lord that i may make it right with that person and with you yeah it's amazing i never thought that i would ever say that i want to be chastened but lord chasing me verse 6 therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to fear him what was the purpose of it it was to learn how to walk in his ways and to fear him moses david paul brother branham and jesus himself all spent time in a desert place before god used them for something greater so it is with you and i my brother my sister perhaps god has you in a desert place because he is preparing you for something greater laying just up ahead perhaps some of you could be honest with yourselves right now and you could say you know what preacher i'm in a desert place in my flesh man and in my spiritual life perhaps you're lonely it seems like the anointing is dry it's a drag to pray it's a drag to go to church and it's a drag to read your bible and you're just going through the motions [Music] a desert place god uses desert places if you're in that spot this morning it's not always the rebuking of the lord yet sometimes it is a lot of times as believers we we try to say well i've done something wrong and this is a rebuke and it's not always the case but perhaps you're in that spot this morning and and you were wondering why you're feeling like this you were wondering why there's no anointing why everything's a drag why why why it's at times like this that satan likes to come and tell us that we're not seed that you don't belong here that this is not for you church is for everybody else everybody else always seems to be happy except for me yeah you know satan likes to put his foot on our heads when it seems like we're sinking that's when we got to reach out by faith that even when our emotions and our sensations we can't feel anything we don't see anything we have no joy we it seems like we have no life yet there's something within us by faith we say though my feelings feel like this though i don't feel anything no i don't see any things oh i don't see the hand of god in my life yet by faith i'm going to reach out not by the outer man not by the inner man but from the holiest of holies from my heart i'm going to reach out and say by faith god's word says that he would be with me even in me and he said it i believe it and that does it god wants to get us away from feelings and sensations get us away from the outer courts get us away from the inner courts and he wants us to live a life a hidden life in the very presence of god in the holy of holies so why everybody why am i in this position today why am i in this wilderness experience that god might prove you that he might reveal his word to you that he might talk to you face to face that he might show you that you're not to live from bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of god that he might prove to you that he is all you need hallelujah because he is jehovah jarrah and so when you do get into that place in the future now you know wow that's not because i'm not seed it's not because i'm not a christian i'm just in a desert place and god is just trying to reveal himself to me he's just trying to bring me into a deeper consecration with him it's not because i'm not a christian glory because that's the first thing that satan wants to prove show us yeah it's not for you skedaddle no you skedaddle the blood is not for you hallelujah you know satan cannot be redeemed he is not redeemable because only the seed of god all right only the seed of god brother branham said are those who can be redeemed are those who can't be born again amen praise the lord let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer father we love you and we thank you for your many blessings there's some here that are going through a desert experience [Music] they feel sticky they feel all alone lord feel like they got no friends [Music] feel no inspiration no anointing lord and that you've left him i pray this morning that this sermon would help him lord to realize father that you haven't indeed left us but father god that you're right there in the midst of the darkness you're there and that you're trying to show us that we're not to go by feelings are the sensations of man but we're supposed to walk by faith lord i just commit this sermon into your hands and i pray that your perfect will was done i commit these people in their lives your sons and your daughters into your hands lord in jesus christ's name amen amen if we can get the words up to that song please i've had it all but what i need is more of you let's just stand to her [Music] feet [Music] lord hear my prayers to sing it again yes [Music] [Music] my [Music] if you would want to everybody with their eyes closed nobody paying attention raised my hand and said i'm going through a desert place right now in my life things look dry things look hard it makes me wonder sometimes but we've heard from the lord today that you're in a desert place for a reason and that's because he loves you and he wants to bring his will in your life take you to a place maybe that you've you've always thought other christians were there but you've never been able to be but god wants to take you there too and i could say to this to you today your redemption draws nigh when god draws night to you it's and he pulls you into a desert place and things look that way it's because he loves you and he cares for you you're part of him he wants to nourish that part he wants to bring the life out in that part maybe you would raise your hand and say i'm in that place right now lord remind me let it come dear to my heart lord that you're mindful of me and you care for me lord and i want to take a moment to say thank you lord for being mindful of me and caring for me lord when it seems that others are being blessed and i wasn't lord it's because you have you have me there for a reason and a purpose and everything you do lord is perfect and everything comes is accomplished as you said every seed will bring forth of its kind so lord we raise our hands together and we say lord have your own way in our lives as our brother has ministered and we've watched and through the examples given in the scripture lord and even watching in the life of brother branham lord how you took them through a desert place lord that's for the perfecting of the saints lord and we thank you for it lord help us to understand it and walk willingly that way lord today in jesus christ's name amen amen amen he's god on the mountain he's god on the mountain he's god in the valley he's god in your dark place in your dry place he's still god [Music] and you've got peace of mind know oh but then things [Music] when things go wrong [Music] is [Music] is faith [Music] when we're upon the mountains [Music] foreign all that's when fed it's really put

he'll make them [Music] he never changes he's the same yesterday today and the nice thing about he's walked where your walkthrough he's been there before 40 days in the desert to be tested to be tried so that when you would say lord he would understand amen sometimes we look at things we say god doesn't like me he's angry at me no it's because he loves you if he didn't care he would say just go just be what you want a real mother real father cares for his children and when they see their children doing things they need to learn they'll step in and do that and i appreciate god doing that again today how many would say amen to that god spoke to me and reminded me that in my desert place it's because he's going to bring me to something he wants me to be god bless you as you go this this this day and lord willing brother steve will be ministering for us again this evening five o'clock see what god has for us maybe he'll talk about peace in the valley today in the evening whatever it
