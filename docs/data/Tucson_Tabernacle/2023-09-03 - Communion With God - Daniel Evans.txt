I'll just read the first verse [Music] that is so good God is so good now before the Feast of the Passover [Music] when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end Lord God we thank you for that love [Music] of Jesus Christ father bless us this evening in this service we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you all be seated thank you it's good to see everyone and the house of the Lord to take the communion tonight read a little bit of his word I I said some things this morning and if you know me I I a lot of times I'll beat myself up and think did I did I say that right or was I too strong or was it not strong enough and uh I don't think I was strong enough um when we cast out someone from our church when we make them not welcome when we shun them our families shun them and and we show really hatred toward toward them that is almost never correct as I said there's a place in First Corinthians I believe it's in chapter five that there was a man that was living with his father's wife I don't know if his his mother or if it was a stepmother but Paul judges the situation and and he his words were Eternal that person over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh so that his soul might be saved and it was an act of love and it was an act of compassion and then later on we see that that man returned to the fold and he was welcomed back in and I I see I'm so I'm so passionate about it because I've seen so many people hurt by things like that seeing people that today and there are many and you all probably know more than I know there are many people that don't want to set foot in a church because they've had such a bad experience I can't see how that is right and I don't believe it's right the Bible says that God is love now if we would were to there are reasons to put people out of a church there are reasons for that and and I don't deny that in the least I would never want to do it but even in this church there are people that I would say and I would tell them personally that you are not welcome here and that's because I know them and they would do harm to our people they would do harm to our children and I I couldn't let them come into this church because of the safety of the flock but if we put someone out because they're not dressing in a certain way or or they've Fallen to sin and they go and they're drinking or they're they're doing something that's wrong this church this may sound strange but our church should have sinners in it else why is it even a church Jesus said I was sent to the sick and not the well and I understand that A little leaven leavens the whole lump I understand that and we have to be careful with our congregation we have to be careful of the influences that we see from outside but we also should be careful for the lost souls that need to be here and I see the damage and I never I never want to see that I it breaks my heart and I hear more and more stories of people that just they they don't they have just such a bad attitude towards church and the people that did that will answer they're going to answer for those things that they have done I pray that they're able to make them right before the day of judgment I pray that all of us I pray that my mistakes that that I could make them right here the we're going to read tonight a scripture that says let a man examine himself we should be examining ourselves every day now I'm not talking about someone that gets offended because maybe I preach Holiness and modesty or someone that gets offended because I preach against uh premarital sex or or um marriage and divorce issues and all that that's that's just getting offended because it doesn't agree with you no you have no right to be offended at that and and no I'm going to continue to preach that because that's the word but when someone is sinning and needs help and they're outside throw them a Lifeline for heaven's sakes throw home something and pull them back in that's what we're here for is to take care of one another that's what a church is for it's not for a bunch of pompous hot house plants it's for people that are willing to be a Christian that are willing to serve others what if it was your children what if it's my children I would want someone that loves them I would want someone to bring them in put their arm around them say brother say sister this this life that you're living is not right lead them to the Lord Jesus that's that's what I that's what I desire that's what Christ did I mean some of the worst people in the in the whole country we're with Jesus and he led them to God and it was very strange doctrines that he preached and friends when we're when we're taking communion it's about bringing us together that's that's what we're going to talk about tonight is bringing the people together you wonder why I have been criticized not much but I've been criticized a little bit about about building rooms out there and and having something for the kids so that they they can enjoy themselves and then say well maybe it's about it's about fun and it's about games and it's not about church and it's not about the word but there is also a communion Factor there is also a factor of bringing the people together with fellowship and love for one another and drawing strength for one another I love to see the kids together helping each other we may have some that that are solid and then we may have others that need help and these ones that are solid can help these other ones of course we have to be careful and that's why we have chaperones that's why we watch over everything we don't want the other ones to pull the good ones down but we also want to lift them up if they're drowning get them out of the water help them that's what it's what communion is we commune with one another we come here we line up here we take the bread the body of Christ and the wine the blood of Christ together because we love each other Jesus got his disciples around together you can't take communion alone one of the most common questions that I received when I was in the ministry in Jeffersonville was can I take communion by myself and you can't also it's not communion communion means Fellowship so you can't you can't do that now there there were some we got some letters from some people in in India that were in Hindu areas that there were no Christians around and and they had a different different situation but almost all of them were that that well these people don't believe like me so how can I take communion with them well communion last I heard and I just read it was about Christ it was about the body and the blood of Christ what does that have to do with your rotten differences nothing it doesn't have anything it's about Jesus Christ now I know I understand there are different doctrines that the the closer we get to the Lord the more that we see the love of God expressed in many other things in Holiness and in and in the um the right way to to do things like baptism like like the way that we conduct ourselves as we move up then we get more revelation but the foundation is in Christ in the Garden of Eden we think about each other and how much we'd love to be with each other in the Garden of Eden God created this man what a masterpiece that he created this man named Adam he had all the he had all of the the trees and the grass and the animals and and he made it just perfect for his son and he was excited I'm sure about bringing this Sun into the world and he he speaks the word and we know the the story and the forms this Flesh and Blood Man Out of the Dust of the earth and there he is and and God has fellowship with this man with his son Adam and he looked it at him and he sees as a father he sees it's not good for man to be alone because God knew how it was to be alone that's why he created us he wanted this fellowship with us so he looks at his son at him and he says oh he needs Fellowship he needs communion and then he says what's the best thing that I can do for him he lets a deep sleep fall on him and he reaches in he takes out a part of Adam's Body his rib and then he makes a person to fellowship with his dear wife and I I look at that and I think there is the communion right at the very beginning God looks down he says it's not right for man to be alone I'm going to make him somebody to help him I'm going to make him somebody to love him I'm going to make him someone that he can he can grow with and that weakened fellowship and I can walk in the garden and I can I can sit down with my son and my daughter and I can talk with them what communion brother handy at the very beginning wouldn't you love to been there there was no sin there was no problems there was no sickness and we're gonna go back to that place one day we'll return they're they're his what he was with his children and and this just beautiful communion and then communion was broken by sin he came in and by this man the serpent God says I'll put enmity between your seed and the woman hatred there's hatred right there and here it breaks the fellowship and then we see it all Through the Ages we see we see pain and suffering and murder and problems and and and God didn't make it that way God made it to have perfect communion then down Through the Ages we see in I think it's an exodus chapter 20 verse 18. we see that God again desired Fellowship yeah it's right after the Ten Commandments God again desired Fellowship and he wrote These commandments so that the people would stop sinning so he could have more fellowship with them and that was the whole thing he knew that if if you will follow my Commandments you will commune with me we'll be closer so then and all the people saw and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightnings this is when God was writing these Ten Commandments the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountains smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will be and and we will hear but let God not speak with us lest we die they wanted they were afraid to commune with God so they said well Moses is a little easier on us than God is so we'll keep our sins and we'll just have this Prophet speak to us and we don't want to speak directly to our father imagine how he felt put yourself in his position and they say well Lord I don't want to talk to you I'll just rely on brother Daniel here the pastor and then you can speak to him and then he can speak to me what an insult to God God says these are my children they don't even want to speak to me because they want to continue on in their sin and in their problems I want to have communion with them but yet they separate themselves from me think about God remember we are made in the image of God the Bible says that in the very beginning God made man in his own image so the feelings that we have when we get hurt if somebody doesn't want to talk to us maybe our children want to separate themselves from us God has the same feelings we have and I know he's God and I know he's sovereign but I'm made in His image and if I have feelings that I'm hurt because they don't want to they don't want to talk to me we see throughout the Old Testament God angers the people do something and it angers God so the feelings that we have God is there too and when we separate ourselves from the Lord and say Lord I don't have time for you I'll just go to church and I'm just going to rely on the past or maybe to give me a good sermon and then we'll be okay that's not it he wants to talk to you he wants to talk to me one-on-one I am his son not as the prophet told us God doesn't have grandchildren he has sons and daughters and he wants that communion with with us I hate to see I just I hate to see that communion broken I think it's in James chapter 4. on the Hebrew Epistles it says this it says submit yourselves therefore to God same theme as through the Old Testament and all through the Bible submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you now listen to this listen to this this is this is great this is like a highlight reel this is one of the the really good ones they're all good I love them all these are all my favorite every scripture is my favorite but this one's really my favorite draw an eye to God and He will draw an eye to you how beautiful is that are those those just few words God wants to fellowship with us Lord I want to do something I'm going to get on my knees I'm going to talk with you a little bit more I'm going to draw close to you and then guess what oh sweetheart I'm right here son I'm right here you made an effort to draw near to me he is always there he's always ready and then so much so that as as time went on and I said it this morning I want to say it again because I felt like the Lord was pleased when I said it that as God preserved Israel all down Through the Ages he was preserving them because he had made a commitment that the Messiah was going to come through this line of Judah he had to keep it there so so here comes this line and here comes Jesus Christ and it has all been about the Lord Jesus Christ from Genesis to revelation every bit of it is about the Lord Jesus because we can't be saved without him they threaten they threaten you with excommunication they threaten us with not not with having to come before the church and and make some and make some confession before the church you confess your faults to the person that you did wrong to that is who is responsible as those two people you do not have to come up here and confess all your faults in front of all the church that does no good but you confess them to the and you make it right to the person you did wrong are you going to carry that sin it's not going to go away All Through the Ages we see the Lord trying to just trying to fellowship with his people loving his people and the one thing that separates the god from people is the same thing that separate him in the Garden of Eden when they when God had his had his children around and then sin separated them and he had to cast them out because of sin and then there was a sin barrier between God and man this whole time and God didn't want that barrier it was symbolized in in the Tabernacle in the wilderness it was symbolized in the in Solomon's Temple that there was a a curtain that covered the holy of the holy of holies and it it was a barrier between God and the people and only one person could go in there a year once a year and that was the high priest and he went in and then the Lord descended and only him God didn't want it that way God wanted a fellowship with all of us everyone's equal everyone's the same importance sister Debbie you're just as important as I am he wants to talk with us we're all his children but the way it was because of the sin barrier he couldn't get he couldn't fellowship with us but he made a way he made a way through his son Jesus Christ that perfect sacrifice that no you don't have to be separated from me anymore you don't have to bring your your um offering and your sacrifice before the Altar and and kill it anymore that just covered your sin now you can fellowship with me and the blood of the Lamb of God covers your sins wipes them away that is when I God can fellowship with you beautiful story the most beautiful story that's ever told in the world is the story of Jesus Christ and here he comes he comes and he dies on the cross es Away The Sins of the people now the Lord is there now we can have Fellowship communion with him one-on-one and even more even more he said that's that's not I'm not God never disappoints and I mean that's not obviously that's like the greatest thing ever that our sins are gone but he says I'm going to add to it he says not only are your sins if you would accept the Son of God Jesus Christ not only are your sins wiped away but now I want to fellowship with you so much that I am going to come down not behind the curtain of the holiest of holies now I am going to come down and enter into your very body so I can be with you always Jesus said I will be with you always there is Jesus Christ in the form of the spirit comes down and enters in to men and women because he wants that Fellowship and then time goes on and we see at the very end of time all the way in we started in Genesis now let's go all the way to Revelation God's same nature is I want to fellowship with you in the same nature and man is I'm busy I got too much to do I like my life I like my sins I like what I'm doing and there Jesus is but I died for you I want a fellowship with you then all the way to the end Brother Andy this age that we live in right now and look what it says in Revelation chapter 3. here's the Lord Jesus he's given us all this the blood is on the the blood's on the cross the atonement's been made salvation has come to the Jews and to the Gentiles not only that but the day of Pentecost has come he came down in a rushing the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind and tongues of fire rested over 120 in the upper room he entered in and then those people came went out and they preached the gospel and more people received the Holy Spirit he gave gifts tongues started started they started speaking in tongues they healed the sick they cast out Devils they did all of these great things and then we see all the way here to the end and here's Jesus after he's done all of that wanting communion behold I stand at the door knock what a sad story brother Branham said this is the saddest scene in the whole Bible what I'm reading right now after everything that he's done and it is this age that we live in right now us here we are Revelation 3 20 behold I stand at the door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and I will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh well I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he's a hathaneer that's that's a nice statement he that has an ear there's a deaf brother here somewhere but even he is without excuse because he can read it he that hathaneer all of us we are without excuse let him hear with the spirit saith under the churches and he just said behold I stand at the door and knock me Christ the man that died on the cross or his knocking and so few people would just open the door he said oh I would open the door but do you do I do I really do it do I really want him to come in and come into my house into my private areas into my very inner being do I really want him to come inside of me and commune with me do I want that I do I said at that at the altar sweetheart and this is even more important than that day I do I want that Lord Jesus I want him to come in and fellowship with me I Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry for all of my sins I'm sorry for for everything that I've done let me open that door come in come in come in come in and fellowship with me tell me Lord give me correction that is my favorite thing about this book I see it is my it's one of my favorite things but it's my favorite thing that leads to my really favorite thing which is salvation but it gives me correction and I love that do you love it when when you see it and and you read in this book or you come to church or or just you just get it from wherever you are and you get that correction you lied about that or you did that wrong or you were a little dishonest about this or you shouldn't have looked over here or you shouldn't have said that or you talked a little bit negative about that and then that little correction comes in oh it feels so good man I love that Daniel was a baby smack the TARTA little guy and you know what he'd want to do he'd want to love on me afterwards he just he just builds such it's like Daddy I'm sorry and then there was just such a love after that and that's how I feel when this book when it corrects me when God's word gives me the correction off Lord I feel so good thank you so much I just Lord I just feel so good I'm so grateful that I was able to make it right because we need correction and this book is full of it Jesus as I read in John 13 Jesus was coming for the Passover feast he had all of his friends there you can imagine he was very very upset because Jesus was the only one that knew that the next day he was going to be on the cross Jesus knew he understood and here's his disciples they had no idea they're around the table Jesus says one of you is going to betray me and they're like I guarantee you they're like oh man how many times have I messed up how many times have I betrayed the Lord and that's how that's how I would feel and and they're all saying is it me and then they're thinking wow I did this and and man I messed up over here or does it mean that betrayed you they wanted to make it right but then there was a dishonest one among them that had it in his mind what he was going to do and he said is it me Jesus agreed with him so then he leaves and Jesus has his people around him John Chapter 13 Verse 21. when Jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake now there was one leading on Jesus's bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake then lying on Jesus's breast saith unto him Lord who is it Jesus answered answer answered and said it is to whom I shall give sop when I have dipped it and when he had dipped us up he gave it to Judas his care at the son of Simon and after the stop Satan entered into him then Jesus said unto him that thou doest do quickly verse 34. listen to this a new commandment here is Jesus Jesus Christ the Messiah God in flesh and here he is with his 11 disciples and and there were probably sisters there the Bible doesn't record them but they were there were probably some sisters around we know Mary Magdalene and we know Mary um and Martha and and the different ones I don't know if they were there but they were probably nearby Jesus said a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another this is God speaking that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another twice he says it a new commandment I give to you unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another so how much Jesus loved us the very love of God very the the love of God made flesh because of the people because God wants communion for eternity with his people and he says now how much is how much is that have I loved you now you should love each other like I've loved you by this shall men know that you're my disciples if you have love one for another and Jesus they get up and walk out the room that they were in a walk down the valley brother Lyle and Jesus is preaching to him the whole time is it the Kidron Valley they walk they walk down the side of the mountain down into the Kidron Valley then they walk up the other side not very far going up at the foot of the Mount of Olives and there is a garden called Gethsemane Jesus goes and he prays John 17 verse 9. I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name those who thou has given me look at his look at his worry look at what he was upset about it wasn't about himself he is worried about these people that were with him that they may be one as We Are One look at the closeness that we should be it's pretty hard for me to distinguish the difference between the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit I know that that they are one but I also know that they are different in a sense but Jesus how close is Jesus and the father and and it's like you know what it's hard brother Aaron it's hard for me to even distinguish between Jesus and the father I know one's the son and and and one's the Creator but then Jesus was there in Melchizedek he had no beginning of days or any of Life all things were created by Him and for him so it's it's hard for me to distinguish that and he said that they should love that they may be one like you and me us will be one as close as the father and the son are that's how close we should be with each other skip to verse 20. Jesus continues on he says neither I neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word there's me there's you that they may all be one oh he said it again as thou father art in me and I am thee that they also may be one in US that the world may believe that thou Hast sent me I've said it before and I'll say it again that the world will recognize that Jesus is the Christ by this scripture because of our love one for another because of our Unity the closeness that we have for each other he says right here Lord let the world see that I am the Messiah because of their closeness with each other i in them and now and me I'm sorry let me go back to 22. and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou and me that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them and that thou has loved me father I will that they also whom now has given me be with me where I am look at the communion that the Son of God Jesus Christ wants with us that they also whom thou giveth me may be with me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loveth me before the foundation of the world what a sweet final prayer from our Lord and savior o righteous father the world hath not known me but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou has loved me may be in them and I in them there's the Holy Spirit Boom and again this is the only age it's Leo to see an age where there is that one that prayed that prayer standing outside the door and knocking trying to get in let's make ready for communion think about the honor that we have of coming together With Friends with family as a church think about this great honor that we have if the musicians would make their way and let's just take a few moments in quiet meditation before we go into the communion service in First Corinthians chapter 11. foreign [Music] foreign before I read the scripture I want to tell you all that it's an honor to be in this battle with each of you think back when our lord Jesus was here what I have wanted [Music] to live in that day knowing that there was two thousand years to come and what I wanted to live in this day when we could see Christ return at any moment I'd want to live in this day I believe it's a harder day today than it's ever been I believe this is a much more difficult time than it was 2 000 years ago but I'm honored to be here and I'm honored to stand side by side with each of you I believe you want the same thing that I do for I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance this doing remembrance of me pause there for just a moment this do in remembrance of me [Music] and song There is a fountain filled with blood your sister Martha's playing right here we can see it and after the same manner also he took the cup which he had sup saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this Dew ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come where forever [Music] for as often I said for as often as you drink this bread as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death until he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord we have an open communion anyone within reason anyone who has a desire to come and take this communion is welcome to do so but I would like to remind everyone in this building wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink of this cup unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord if you are not covered in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I would discourage you from taking this communion but if you have given your life to the Lord [Music] let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup [Music] for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eat it and drink his damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged as I was saying before I love that correction but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world the brothers would come forward and make ready [Music] with blood drawn from me Manuel's made amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] ities [Music] unseen as blessed [Music] can you imagine the words of that song Those sins plunge beneath that flood there is no sin whatsoever it's completely wiped clean I hold my hand this bread that represents the body of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ the broken body if you look it's broken it's not a wafer there's no peace that looks like any other piece all different [Music] symbolizing the way that our Lord's body not a bone but his body was broken for us father I'm unworthy to hold this tray in my hand that contains the bread that represents your body but Lord we do this in obedience to the word and as the Believers come they will do they will do that in obedience to your word Lord none of us are worthy but we trust that the blood of Jesus Christ wipes away our sins we pray that your blessing would be upon this bread in Jesus name [Music] this wine which also represents the blood of Our Lord father [Music] thinking about the blood that was dripping on the ground at the feet of the cross knowing that it was that blood that was shed and that life that saved me from hell and Fire thank you for that sacrifice Lord thank you for what you've done I never Lord I never want to take it for granted we thank you for this wine pray that your blessings will be upon it and upon every one that takes this into their body according Lord to your Commandments in Jesus name [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] see you 'll walk around some change of God be saved to see no more ever see but free I saw this dream I flowing once Supply be redeeming love husband husband I shall be tea I die [Music] I shall be to you I die I shall be to you I don't know has beat my feet and shall be to you I die ever sees by faith I saw this dream by flowing once upon [Music] redeeming love has been my theme I shall be to you I die I shall be due I Die My Lord I shall be to

[Music] in the grave silence [Music] my silent in the grave when peace [Music] Rejoice to see but found beneath it is day number [Music] watch all my sea the way wash all my sins away worship by sins away no may I ever see all my sea the way [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] watch all my sins [Music] wash all my sins away [Music] they died [Music] Rejoice to see advance [Music] wash all my sins always Mercy the way [Music] that we ever seen by faith I saw the Stream but flowing close [Music] I die [Music] amen I believe that God has pleased I really do and I want to before before we close we're going to do things a little bit different tonight believe that the Bible teaches us in Acts chapter 2 that we are to repent for our sins we are to go back to our sins and and feel remorse and and say the Lord I'm not going to do these things anymore and then and then we are to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins for the taking away of our sins so I'm going to read the clothes of the feet washing and brother brother Ron if you could come if you could come forward um when we close if you could close in prayer but we're going to baptize someone tonight and it's when you feel the desire to be baptized you better get baptized because we don't know what's what lays in front of us but we do know that when God makes that call if you don't answer that call might not come again so there's a young man back there the Jeremiah that's going to be baptized tonight [Music] supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas is Carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God one of those things that God gave into Jesus's hand was this boy that's going to be baptized tonight trophy of God's grace [Music] he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet and Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not but what thou sh but Thou shalt know hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me so Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith unto him he that is washed needeth not to be not be not say he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and year clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he saith unto them know ye what I have done done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet he also to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example and Jesus was a great example it's an understatement for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if ye know these things happy are ye if you do them amen so we would be dismissing after the baptism I will meet Brother Andy upstairs will lead brother Jonathan will lead some songs I will go up and baptize when I finish baptizing brother Ron if you would come forward and close in prayer we will dismiss sister to the normal place over there Brothers up there as I said friends I believe God was pleased I really do what a nice spirit Give the Lord [Applause] we do thank him God is so good

bless you all Jeremiah Brother Andy Andre a good friend a brother that loves the Lord my brother Jeremiah he felt the spirit I believe the Lord moving he says I want to take that communion but he says I haven't been baptized and the little guy felt that I'm going to get baptized so he comes here I was talking with him just now that when we baptize according to Acts chapter 2 the Apostle Peter he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins so we take this step to be baptized so that our sins will be washed away baptism doesn't wash Away The Sins the blood of Jesus Christ watches those sins away but this is a step that we take to to make a commitment to the Lord Lord I want my sins washed away you good can you see him for a little guy is almost over his head now and this water is cold Jeremiah stand here his dad standing right here proud of the father it was Jeremiah you understand what we're talking about you have a

in there Let It Be cast aside let the Holy Ghost and Fire Burn it out I don't want anything to be between me and you and Lord for each and every one of these darling little Souls here as we have come Lord as we have reenacted this this scene many times where God himself came and washed the feet and he gave these ordinances and explained that eat my flesh and drink my blood was misunderstood and he he made it very clear so father we've come and we've done this in faith believing and Lord we we too truly desire communion with you and oh Lord I hope that we have pleased you tonight and as we go Lord if each individual and we place ourselves before our brothers and sisters in humiliation Lord preferring each other over ourselves and gladly Lord putting us in that position and truly asking you to help that person to continue their lives and those that so many of us oh God are represented in here they're maybe just a few but there are hundreds that are represented and I'm I'm thinking Lord and how that job that he said he would sacrifice for not just himself but as for his children yes Lord we come before you not just for ourselves but for the many that we know and love that are not here and oh God we long for them all Lord to be cleansed with your blood so Lord May each and every one Lord as they participate do it wholeheartedly and have a revelation of what we're doing we thank you Lord for this time together in the precious name of the Lord Jesus amen amen [Music] amen [Applause] amen it feels good to be here now as you go as I said the sisters in the normal place here the
