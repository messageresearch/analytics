[13:12] Jesus name we pray amen
[13:15] I'll open up with the scripture
[13:19] Colossians chapter 3 verse 16.
[13:23] [Music]
[13:24] it says this
[13:26] let the word of the Lord dwell in you
[13:28] richly in all wisdom
[13:30] teaching and admonishing one another in
[13:33] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[13:38] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[13:42] Lord
[13:43] and whatsoever you do in word or deed do
[13:46] all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving
[13:48] thanks to God and the father by him God

[14:11] and we have some of the folks here that
[14:15] have said they would sing
[14:17] so we have
[14:18] um quite a few today so just worship
[14:21] praise God
[14:23] sing you know right along with them
[14:27] and warm yourself up in case you get
[14:30] cold amen
[14:35] let's look at Psalms
[14:37] chapter 9 verses 1 and 2 while they're
[14:40] preparing there
[14:43] Psalms chapter 9 verses 1 and 2. I will
[14:46] praise thee O Lord with my whole heart I
[14:49] will sure for show forth all thy
[14:51] marvelous works I will be glad and
[14:53] rejoicing Thee I will sing praise to thy
[14:56] name O thou most high
[14:58] amen
[15:00] [Music]
[15:07] I was asked to sing a few days ago my
[15:09] dad asked if I would sing a song and as
[15:11] you know I haven't been able to come to
[15:13] church so I'm so happy first to be here
[15:16] I feel good today and I'm grateful for
[15:19] that but also I was reading the Psalms
[15:22] in my devotion and it kind of goes right
[15:25] in line with what they've already read
[15:27] this afternoon I was reading Psalms 89 I
[15:31] was singing of the mercies of the Lord
[15:32] forever and with my mouth
[15:34] make known his faithfulness to all
[15:37] generations and the second part of that
[15:38] is you read on it says even the heavens
[15:41] establish and declare that God is
[15:43] faithful and we look in our you know in
[15:45] the sky you see the sun the moon the
[15:46] stars every single day that's a reminder
[15:48] God put those up there they're still
[15:50] they're still faithful to their place
[15:51] because he set it in place and he's the
[15:53] faithful God so I was thinking about
[15:55] that and I thought well we haven't had
[15:57] time to practice anything so we're just
[15:59] kind of doing this but um everybody
[16:02] knows the songs and so if you just want
[16:04] to join with me
[16:05] [Music]
[16:09] I will sing on the mercies of the Lord
[16:14] forever
[16:15] [Music]
[16:52] life faithfulness to all generations
[16:57] [Music]
[17:41] yes
[17:44] [Music]

[17:57] generations

[19:17] God we serve
[19:19] brother Daniel
[19:23] I'll call you Junior
[19:29] brother while is your throat warm too
[19:33] brother Daniels
[19:36] I'm prepared there and then
[19:38] such a Lily and my sister Grace Fallen
[19:42] brother Daniel okay
[20:01] you ready
[20:04] I I got a text this morning
[20:07] and um
[20:09] I'm sure you don't remember it but I
[20:11] shared a testimony
[20:13] about a young lady that Daniel had
[20:15] witnessed to she didn't witness to her
[20:18] he was having a conversation
[20:20] and uh in Jeffersonville and there was a
[20:23] young lady who was going through some
[20:24] hard a really hard time
[20:27] and she was listening to what the way
[20:29] Daniel was talking to this other brother
[20:32] and it really encouraged her and then
[20:35] she and Daniel
[20:37] had a conversation after that
[20:40] and I'd like to read a text that she
[20:42] wrote this morning
[20:45] officially one year ago
[20:47] one year ago
[20:49] I had no idea that going on a road trip
[20:53] this was down to Jeffersonville from
[20:54] Canada
[20:55] now going on a road trip would lead me
[20:57] to leave leave everything I had and was
[21:02] and was to pick up my cross and follow
[21:05] Jesus
[21:07] I had no idea God would reveal himself
[21:10] in the simplest way possible one year
[21:13] ago I was wondering how I could possibly
[21:16] make my way back to God when it seemed
[21:19] like I had gone too far but someone
[21:22] reminded me
[21:24] one year ago of just how strong I am and
[21:28] said if someone could do it it was me
[21:33] you said that following you said that
[21:36] following God wouldn't be the end of my
[21:38] dreams like I kept thinking but God will
[21:41] allow me some bigger dreams that I had
[21:45] no idea I could possibly get and you
[21:48] were so right
[21:49] I know it probably all seemed pretty
[21:52] silly to you but I know that God used
[21:55] you in the simplest way possible and I
[21:58] will forever be grateful one year ago
[22:01] today
[22:04] [Applause]
[22:11] God bless you guys I'm really nervous
[22:13] this is my one of my first time singing
[22:15] in front of people so bear with me I
[22:17] might bomb it but you know say a quick
[22:19] prayer for me please
[22:23] [Music]
[22:36] there's a Grace when your heart is on
[22:39] your fire
[22:42] another way when the walls are closing
[22:48] and when I look at the space between
[22:51] where I used to be in this Reckoning
[22:55] I know I will never be you
[22:59] there's another in the fire
[23:02] standing next to me there's another in
[23:07] the water so holding back the Seas
[23:12] should I ever
[23:14] near-minded of how I've been set free
[23:17] there's a cross but there's no burden
[23:21] where another died for me
[23:24] there's another in the fire
[23:39] dead left for dead beneath the waters
[23:45] I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
[23:51] this should I fall in the space between
[23:53] what remains of me in its Reckoning
[23:58] the way I'm about to the things of this
[24:01] world
[24:02] there's another in the fire
[24:06] standing next to me there's another in
[24:10] the water so holding by the Seas
[24:15] should I ever need in mind the power Set
[24:19] Me Free there's a grid that holds no
[24:23] body now the power lives in me
[24:27] and I can hear the light in the darkness
[24:31] as a Darkness bows to him I can hear the
[24:35] roar in the heavens at the space between
[24:39] where's then I can feel the ground shake
[24:42] beneath us as the Prison Walls came in
[24:46] nothing stands between us
[24:49] and nothing's in between us
[24:52] there's another in the fire standing
[24:57] next to me there's another in the water
[25:01] it's holding back the Seas
[25:08] how good you've been to me I'll count
[25:12] the joy of every battle and I know
[25:16] that's where you'll be
[25:18] there's another in the fire

[42:28] up out of the out of the chair

[42:44] there was healing in that cup
[42:48] so she couldn't
[42:51] as they took communion she couldn't bend
[42:54] down very well
[42:56] but she pressed through the pain

[1:07:26] I wanted to share a testimony I um with
[1:07:30] struggling with some things
[1:07:32] and I got to thinking
[1:07:36] because Stephen told me that brother
[1:07:38] green said that brother Brown told him
[1:07:41] that there's nothing that you can do
[1:07:44] to make God love you more or less
[1:07:46] because he loves you just the same
[1:07:50] and um
[1:07:52] rather than you got up and preached who
[1:07:56] had Bewitched you that you quit walking
[1:07:58] in Grace and
[1:08:01] started walking under the law again
[1:08:05] and I couldn't ever come on my own
[1:08:12] but
[1:08:14] once again
[1:08:15] I'd look to the Lord to transform Me In
[1:08:18] His Image and said I I can't transform
[1:08:21] myself
[1:08:22] I'm looking to you to transform me
[1:08:25] so and and I overcame through him
[1:08:29] and I just thank the Lord
[1:08:45] I am so glad that our father in Heaven
[1:08:49] tells of his love in the book he has
[1:08:53] given wonderful things in the Bible I
[1:08:57] see this is the tears that Jesus loves
[1:09:02] me I am so glad that Jesus Loves Me

[1:19:37] very very special to me I get criticized
[1:19:39] for not mentioning him enough and I get
[1:19:41] criticized for mentioning him too much
[1:19:44] but one thing I know is
[1:19:46] he was a great man that did great things
[1:19:51] my family the Evans family used to
[1:19:54] follow him around
[1:19:56] all over the all over the country really
[1:19:59] my family lived in south Georgia brother
[1:20:01] Branham lived
[1:20:03] in um
[1:20:05] Southern Indiana
[1:20:07] and they drove up
[1:20:09] um
[1:20:11] they drove up to hear him preach on a
[1:20:14] Sunday they drove up the day before
[1:20:17] they um they got to spend quite a bit of
[1:20:20] time with brother Branham they were they
[1:20:21] were really close he'd stay with them
[1:20:23] when he'd when he'd come down to Georgia
[1:20:24] and often my family would stay with him
[1:20:29] um
[1:20:29] so brother Brown was preaching on a
[1:20:32] Sunday and my Aunt Martha was a little
[1:20:35] girl
[1:20:36] she is maybe Caitlyn's age
[1:20:39] and uh by the way Caitlyn and Lydia I'm
[1:20:44] over time I don't have to sing
[1:20:46] haha
[1:20:49] that's uh that's why I gave the
[1:20:51] testimonies
[1:20:52] I am she's
[1:20:54] about Caitlyn's age I say
[1:20:56] and
[1:20:58] they um
[1:21:00] they spent some time with brother
[1:21:01] Branham and and my grandpa noticed that
[1:21:03] brother Branham was talking to my aunt
[1:21:05] Martha
[1:21:07] um a couple times
[1:21:09] so after the meetings were over they
[1:21:11] were driving home Martha
[1:21:13] she had
[1:21:15] um pet chickens
[1:21:17] and she loved these chickens so much
[1:21:20] they were they were like her little
[1:21:22] congregation they weren't everywhere
[1:21:24] with her and she'd go to school and and
[1:21:27] they'd walk her to the bus stop and and
[1:21:30] she'd get on the bus and they'd go back
[1:21:32] home and and when the bus would come
[1:21:34] back in the evening those chickens would
[1:21:36] run out and meet Martha at the school at
[1:21:39] the bus stop
[1:21:40] and she just loved them and they loved
[1:21:43] her
[1:21:44] and um
[1:21:46] so when they went up to Jeffersonville
[1:21:48] they were on their way home and my
[1:21:50] grandpa called the neighbor
[1:21:53] and the neighbor said well she said I
[1:21:56] got some really bad news
[1:21:57] he said my dog got into your yard and
[1:22:02] killed all of Martha's chickens
[1:22:05] so he felt awful my grandpa just he
[1:22:08] couldn't tell
[1:22:09] Martha
[1:22:11] and so he worried all the way home I
[1:22:14] think it's I don't know it's 750 800
[1:22:16] miles Drive
[1:22:18] he worried about that the whole way home
[1:22:21] and they got home
[1:22:24] they drove into the driveway and the
[1:22:26] chickens didn't come running out
[1:22:29] and my Grandpa took Martha
[1:22:33] his little girl aside
[1:22:35] and he said he said Martha he says I
[1:22:38] have some really bad news
[1:22:41] he said the neighbor's dog
[1:22:43] got into the yard
[1:22:45] and killed all of your chickens
[1:22:48] Martha said she said daddy that's okay
[1:22:52] she said when we were up in
[1:22:54] Jeffersonville she said brother Branham
[1:22:56] told me
[1:22:57] that the dog had gotten my chickens and
[1:22:59] and they wouldn't be there when I got
[1:23:01] back
[1:23:04] the Lord thinking of a little girl like
[1:23:06] that and how that man he was truly a
[1:23:09] prophet there's no way he could have
[1:23:11] known that
[1:23:12] and my grandpa didn't even know it until
[1:23:14] he was on the way home and brother
[1:23:15] Branham had told my my Aunt Martha two
[1:23:17] days earlier
[1:23:18] that that would happen

[1:48:05] softman boys
[1:48:07] um he killed javelina
[1:48:09] and he brought it into camp

[1:48:14] rifles and and uh his brother had a bow
[1:48:17] and arrow
[1:48:18] and brother Branham said uh he said you
[1:48:21] got a nice one there he said uh he said
[1:48:24] yes sir he says how far away was it when
[1:48:25] you shot it
[1:48:27] he saw it was uh it's probably about 40
[1:48:29] yards
[1:48:31] and he said really
[1:48:33] yes sir he said
[1:48:35] you sure he's well maybe

[1:49:00] what happened he said
[1:49:02] I was walking down the trail
[1:49:04] this way
[1:49:07] and he said the javelina
[1:49:09] was walking this way
[1:49:11] and he says we were both moving real
[1:49:13] fast he said we almost ran into each
[1:49:15] other and he said that thing turned
[1:49:17] around and he said it ran and got stuck
[1:49:21] in a bunch of cactus
[1:49:23] and he said so I just walked up to it
[1:49:26] and shot it
[1:49:29] and he says no Terry brother Bram said
[1:49:31] no he said let me tell you what really
[1:49:33] happened
[1:49:35] he said you were walking on this Trail
[1:49:37] going this way

[1:49:41] was walking this trail of walking on the
[1:49:44] same Trail and you all met face to face

[1:52:52] you'll follow sister

[1:53:00] brother Daniel has a song and then he'll
[1:53:02] follow you
[1:53:04] thank you
[1:53:13] do you hear me here
[1:53:16] you can turn that up just a little bit
[1:53:17] louder
[1:53:22] they asked me to come up and play there
[1:53:24] Monica I've been playing it for just a
[1:53:25] little bit
[1:53:27] I figured I'd do something a little bit
[1:53:29] different we'll play the harmonica too
[1:53:32] I want to take you on a journey with me
[1:53:35] I want to see if you could just take a
[1:53:37] deep breath close your eyes and just
[1:53:40] relax and listen to these words that God
[1:53:43] gives me to give for you today for this
[1:53:45] evening
[1:53:49] I want to tell you a little bit about
[1:53:50] three kings one was a king who wared
[1:53:55] against God's will
[1:53:57] another one was a king that did God's
[1:53:59] will
[1:54:00] and another one was a king that
[1:54:02] completed God's perfect will
[1:54:04] that was our King The King of Kings the
[1:54:08] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:12] as this ancient instrument plays I think
[1:54:15] of a young Shepherd boy named David
[1:54:17] standing in the gap between King Saul
[1:54:21] in a dark evil spirit
[1:54:23] David was summoned to the Royal Court a
[1:54:26] raid in battle with nothing but a harp
[1:54:28] like the one we now hear
[1:54:31] to battle the evil that was consuming
[1:54:33] King Saul
[1:54:35] I'd like to think he was playing
[1:54:37] something similar to this Soul piercing
[1:54:39] song
[1:54:40] Amazing Grace
[1:54:43] because it was Grace that soon saved him
[1:54:46] from being pierced to the wall with King
[1:54:48] Saul's Javelin while the harp yet echoed
[1:54:51] through the Royal Chambers
[1:54:54] as I continue listening to this harp I
[1:54:57] think of God's grace that kept David
[1:54:58] safe through all his Wars
[1:55:01] and delivered him untouched to the
[1:55:03] throne where he became king
[1:55:07] I weep as I go deeper in thought of
[1:55:10] another king
[1:55:12] the king of kings and a direct line to
[1:55:14] the throne of King David
[1:55:17] Jesus who by that same Amazing Grace
[1:55:20] stood in the gap between us and Evil
[1:55:23] he was a raid in battle
[1:55:25] nothing but a cross a mockery of a
[1:55:28] king's robe in the crown of thorns
[1:55:34] while hanging there marred beyond
[1:55:36] recognition he said father forgive him
[1:55:40] for they know not what they do
[1:55:44] and when he heard a broken heart next to
[1:55:47] him ask
[1:55:49] to be remembered by him when he entered
[1:55:51] into his kingdom
[1:55:53] a good shepherd and King of Kings then
[1:55:56] proclaimed through Grace
[1:55:58] to a mere sinner just like us listening
[1:56:01] now
[1:56:03] who was dying next to him on his own
[1:56:05] cross
[1:56:06] today you will be with me in Paradise
[1:56:12] he soon took the javelin to the side
[1:56:15] that young David was spared from many
[1:56:17] years before
[1:56:19] while Amazing Grace plays on I see him
[1:56:22] going into battle once more for us his
[1:56:25] children
[1:56:26] and now part of his Royal and eternal
[1:56:28] Kingdom
[1:56:29] foreign with blood still dripping from
[1:56:32] the nail hole in his hand
[1:56:36] snatches the keys of death out of the
[1:56:38] dragon's head
[1:56:40] delivering us into eternal life
[1:56:43] friends believe this with all your
[1:56:45] hearts
[1:56:46] and when hardship storm clouds and even
[1:56:49] death comes calling
[1:56:51] say as King David once said
[1:56:53] [Music]
[1:56:54] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:56:57] shadow of death
[1:56:59] I shall fear no evil
[1:57:01] for the Lord is with me
[1:57:03] brothers and sisters it's by his Amazing
[1:57:06] Grace
[1:57:07] we are redeemed to eternal life with him
[1:57:11] and each other forever
[1:57:19] [Music]
[1:57:50] foreign
[1:57:52] [Music]
[1:58:15] God bless you all
[1:58:16] [Applause]
