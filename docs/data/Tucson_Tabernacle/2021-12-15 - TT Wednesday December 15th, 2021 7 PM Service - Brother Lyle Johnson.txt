praise on sunday i'd ask for continued prayers for a man named chuck who suffered a major heart attack he woke up on monday and asked for his wife he has continued to improve he has been moved to a regular room in the hospital and is going through therapy his family is very appreciative of all the prayers and ask that we continue to pray for his recovery thank you and god bless you we're gonna invite brother lyle to come on out and we're just gonna [Music] bow our heads before the lord and just pray for his mercy lord jesus tonight lord we're thankful lord that this prayer request was her lord and honored lord and we're just so grateful lord lord may this be our expectation every time lord that that you will come down on the scene and move powerfully lord and lord to have the faith lord to move mountains lord have the faith of a mustard seed lord we just we want to be the church lord that that shows that to the people of this world lord and all the things that we do lord in our faith and our devotion our love for you lord as paul said lord not with not with vanities or guy oh lord but with the power lord of you lord we just not to glory in ourselves lord but to glory in you we ask you bless his service tonight lord we actually watch over those who couldn't make it tonight or not feeling well or different things that come up to keep them from the house of the lord and we just pray lord that you go to them and you comfort them and you draw them closer to you lord and we just as you watch over brother lyle tonight as he's been preparing lord and just use him lord as your as your messenger now tonight lord just to tell us your word tonight lord to change our hearts and draw us closer to you [Music] in jesus name amen i will go back to see it is no secret what god

is no circuit what god can do it's beyond what we're able to comprehend but that doesn't make it a secret it's so good to be here tonight with you thank you for coming and those that are joining us virtually thank you i'm wondering to to start if we could sing together and i need your help and i need to turn this on the chorus of i pledge allegiance to the lamb see if i've got the words up here there it is i pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all i am i will seek to honor his commands i pledge allegiance to the lamb is that your pledge tonight is it mine let's make it ours together one more time i pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all i am i will seek to honor his commands i pledge allegiance to the land thank you so much you know a pledge it's a vow you give your word to do something or to perform something in the church denominations in my background every year they'd have a what they called a pledge drive and that meant that they were looking for money and they wanted you to commit to giving a certain amount every week or every month and then they'd give you envelopes with that amount on it to help remind you what your pledge was that was in the days before personal computers or smartphones and other conveniences that plague us today allegiance means to stand by something typically a cause or a nation you identify with it so to pledge allegiance to the lamb is to say that we give our word to stand by the cause of christ as we hold that thought expressed in that song please let's join our hearts together in prayer lord jesus it's a great honor it's a great privilege to stand here with your people tonight lord in this and this holy place that's been set aside lord lord jesus i pray that tonight that you would just take lyle johnson and push him out of the way lord we've all come each of us has come to hear from you lord something in our heart that we're looking for an answer some some something that we need from you tonight lord please provide it lord in spite of myself lord we commit this time unto you and we thank you we thank you for being with us we thank you for your promise we thank you for your word and lord we truly do pledge allegiance to you and we thank you in jesus precious name amen while we're standing let's read from the book of job it'll be from the 13th chapter and starting at verse 15. job's in the midst of a great trouble his friends are concerned for him they've traveled a long way to come and be with him but they're certain that the problems that job is facing is due to some secret sin in his life some unconfessed things something that he just won't admit but if he'll only confess it all will be well but job knows the integrity of his own heart he's confident that he hasn't transgressed him and that his heart is pure before god he refuses to confess falsely still he's bewildered by his misfortune and we read though he though god slay me yet will i trust in him i i don't understand all this evil that's befallen me i don't understand why god hasn't protected me but he's greater than i am his ways are higher than my ways my god is real and i will always trust him regardless of my circumstances but i will maintain my own ways before him i've lived a righteous life in obedience to his commands and i will continue to do so he also shall be my salvation job is looking at life's end here he says in another place naked came i into the world naked will i return the lord gave the lord's taken away blessed be the name of the lord he's holding fast in the face of unbearable loss anguish of soul he continues for an hypocrite shall not come before him again lord i've lived a righteous life i will continue to do so i won't confess to sins i've not committed i will continue to offer sacrifices to cover those that i have i will maintain the integrity of my heart life it's not about convenient and ease lord it's about integrity and it's about faith and and before we're seated a verse from hebrews 11 the faith chapter we'll just read verse 6. paul's been talking about things he says but he says however without faith outside of faith apart from faith trust reliance assurance persuasion moral conviction it's impossible to please god unable to do it because he that cometh that's anyone that's you that's me he that cometh to god approaches god come nears to god must that's absolutely necessary must believe commit trust have faith that he is not just that he exists in history but he's alive he's living and and conjunction there's a second condition that god is a rewarder a remunerator of them us if we diligently seek him earnestly investigate search out and worship him worship god please be seated here we are it's another wednesday evening we can be together around the word of the lord to celebrate him to worship him to raise our voices and praise to him and to deepen our relationship with him and with each other yet we find ourselves under attack not so much from our fellow man or being singled out for persecution by our government not overtly at least not here in america but by stealth we see our ranks thinning through attrition disease death many of our youth are lost in a cyber world of fantasy and fiction teased away by attractions of the world about them enticed by their peers down a path that leads to darkness despair substituting christmas for christ exchanging gifts that perish rather than accepting the only gift that really matters we see addictions on the rise much worse than any virus not just of chemical substances but a true pandemic of epic proportions not a physical disease though covet is certainly taking a terrible toll but one that's much worse we're witnessing the destruction of our society and way of life tearing it down removing its very foundations and rebuilding it all and satan's image driven by a global network of computers and now being equipped with artificial intelligence that tracks and learns fed by social media whose algorithms seek to enslave individuals and divide society to feed people what they want to see and hear a time when truth is hidden when those who purport to inform you are really working to convince you that their words are truth that their perspective is the only correct one their interpretation is the only one that you should believe everything else is fake news a couple of months ago we shared with you about helen and holly i think a great destroyer is amongst us hiding under the name of video games or computer games most are graphically violent and we see the results played out in schools across our nations murderous rampages suicides acting out fantasies that result in mayhem and death just last week a second cousin of mine came through town and came to visit for evening just passing through she had her oldest son with her a quiet polite young man of 17 or so but i noticed his left arm was covered with scars where he'd been cutting himself his hair was dyed black his fingernails were polished black he didn't often make eye contact he said i can tell you a lot about your shoes he was always looking down he was at a complete loss about what he might want to do after high school he says his main activity is playing video games another young person came to our house recently and on the back of her laptop computer all sorts of stickers one of which was a demonic horrible thing being crucified demons run rampant mocking us daring us dominating our society and infiltrating everywhere this isn't black and white tv in the age of i love lucy that brother branham warned us about no with covid school classes world often are still required to be online using zoom or similar technology isolating our youth from social contact in the physical world and substituting this virtual world this virtual reality this madeverse as the founders of facebook are calling it you're almost required to have an email account these days do your banking pay your bills on your computer or your smartphone cash is beyond being replaced by cash and debit cards it's use apple pay or google pay i'm sorry i didn't mean to go on a rampage about this but i can hear someone screaming johnny get out of the street a car's coming what i really wanted to bring you tonight was encouragement in the face of this onslaught of evil in our world it often takes the form of an extended illness or death of a loved one a family member sometimes of a child the result that i see all too often is discouragement an attitude of just giving up in our extended family more than 30 years ago a nephew was killed in a tragic airplane accident his dad was a solid christian a deacon in his church a well-respected family he struggled for years with why did this happen i was doing everything right where was god when my son needed him the most job faced the same question why do the righteous suffer well let's read just a bit more from hebrews 11 we'll we'll skip down to verse 32. what more shall i say paul has been talking about heroes of faith for the time would fail me to tell of gideon or of barrack or of samson or viaphet of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness we're made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women receive their dead raised to life again when we think of faith we often think of these victories as paul outlines here he's just written about the faith of abraham and sarah yes he eulogizes sarah's faith also she didn't only laugh you know paul speaks of joseph and moses and others he concludes that portion of the chapter that we just read a summary of important and seemingly impossible feats and victories the testimonies we all like to hear and love to share david versus goliath the weak versus the strong brother brannan preached a message called perfect strength and perfect weakness admonishing us not to depend on our own abilities but to surrender ourselves to god follow his guidance his direction get out of our comfort zone we might say today but hebrews 11 we call it the faith chapter but but it doesn't stop here let's read just a little bit more others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings scourgings yay of bonds imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented paul tells us and the world was not worthy of these warriors of faith they wandered in deserts on mountains and dens and caves of the earth these aren't the victorious testimonies we seek to hear very often and paul wasn't just talking about the past he says these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise they didn't experience the fulfillment of the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect a good report yeah we can't read it at least not yet but the reports are filed in god's record book and that's the record that counts that's where by grace through faith our good reports will be found and that better thing paul's talking about us is not freedom from suffering or persecution or sickness or death in first corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 we read wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall watch out for that spiritual pride there hath no temptation taken you but such is common to man your troubles may not be as unique as you think they are but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it escape doesn't necessarily mean being freed escape may be strength it doesn't guarantee healing if you're sick it means god will provide you with the strength his strength is revealed through our weakness he'll provide you the strength to endure it we'll see an example of this in a moment corinthians goes on wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry don't worship anything else worship the lord trust in the lord i speak as to wise men you judge what i say in his second letter to timothy in two places he talks a little bit about this sort of thing he says therefore this is paul talking i endure all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory it's a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we must die to ourselves so that we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him do you want to reign with him expect suffering in your life don't seek it but expect it if we deny him he will also deny us if we believe not yet he abides faithful he can't deny himself another part second timothy chapter 3 verse 10 he says but thou remember in the in the king james thou is the personal version of the second person of you so he's not talking to a church he's talking to an individual he says but timothy you've fully known my doctrine my manner of life my purpose my faith long suffering charity love patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me paul's not alone here comes a promise we don't often seek or embrace or even talk about but the next verse tells us yeah rest assured all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution evil men and seducers we just talked about some of that shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived we often think of persecution as as physical oppression through our fellow man or perhaps through some sort of government policy think hate crimes when i was a kid i never heard of anything like a hate crime what's this but now that's a federal felony now certainly paul is using these examples of physical persecutions and so forth as he instructs timothy and what will turn out to be the last letter of his that we have but who is our adversary where does our persecution ultimately come from and who's eden are we dwelling satan's so the persecution in whatever form comes from him it's spiritual warfare not physical our weapons and armor are foolish to the natural man a skeptic would say prayer you mean talking to yourself there's no god stupid the bible fables tales moral teachings and full of violence and all sorts of terrible things how can you put any faith in jewish myths why would you if you want peace try yoga yet yielded with faith our weapons and defenses are effective to the pulling down of satan's strongholds and he knows it paul writing to the church at corinth once more aren't you glad that the corinthians had so many problems i thank god for the problems the corinthians had because if they didn't have those problems we wouldn't have paul's letters i'm sure satan was gloating back then out of what i've done to these guys trying to discredit and stamp out the early church and it all backfired and these letters still served to inspire us tens of centuries later ii corinthians 10 verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh while we live in these earthly bodies we do not war after the flesh ours is a spiritual battle on another field another plane of existence for the weapons of our warfare aren't carnal but they are mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds what do they do what do we do casting down imaginations virtual reality and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringeth into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ i pledge allegiance to the lamb that battlefield that's of and in our minds and having in readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled verse 5 it speaks to the battle in our minds our mental struggles that fight our spirits that sow seeds of doubt bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ but none of this necessarily means physical deliverance will be in this battle until we draw our final breath listen again to paul as he defends his calling in ministry against those who were rising up to oppose him and second corinthians 10 just a few verses down starting at uh at verse 10. paul is uh is talking about what some of his detractors are saying for his letters say they are weighty and powerful yeah peter said some things paul writes hard to be understood but his bodily presence is weak and paul's speech contemptible the next chapter paul seems to admit this a little bit he says but though i be rude in speech my kentucky english yet not in knowledge we've been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things is that how you imagine paul persuading the greeks i i tend to think of him as a superbly educated highly trained eloquent yet we're told god took him to the back side of the desert to arabia to reveal himself to him and here paul says i'm weak and inarticulate when i speak but i can write pretty well but i'm not such a good speaker recall that when moses complained of his inability to speak to the group he was destined to lead god let aaron be moses mouthpiece paul had to speak in spite of his difficulties he wasn't given an errand to help him out was the suffering that paul wrote about in hebrews 11 for the past for those before his time those heroes of faith let's let's take a look as he relates some of his own experiences again second corinthians 11 jumping down to verse 24 of the jews he said five times i was whipped with 39 lashes in those days if you were arrested and questioned or interrogated the euphemism is examined it meant a beating it meant torture three times i was beaten with rods once i was stoned the intent of stoning is to kill we're told in acts 14 19 this happened at leicester on his very first missionary journey sharing the gospel of peace and redemption and met with such violence i can hear paul lord are you really sure this is what you want me to do he was human he said three times i suffered shipwreck not like they had lifeboats in those days or life preservers a night and a day have i been in the deep cold no wetsuit or snorkel goggles or masks no doubt on the verge of hypothermia probably naked as well to get rid of the weight of his clothing that would otherwise drag him down and cause him to drown in journeyings often and perils of water fording rivers tiny boats and perils dangers of robbers in spite of the roman peace pox romana travelers were often way late no one seemed surprised when jesus spoke of a traveler between jerusalem and jericho being attacked robbed and left for dead by the side of the road the passers-by just passed by not so different from our day where people stand by while someone's attacked or take a video of it for their social media followers considering the punishment for robbery in those days was crucifixion right the other two people that were with jesus on calvary were thieves they were robbers so the offenders were often violent we're not talking about purse snatches or pickpockets or shoplifters here in perils by mine own countrymen as he just mentioned they're the ones that lashed him stoned him in perils by the heathen remember the uproar in ephesus or the beating and imprisonment at philippi those were the very ones god sent him to reach in perils and city and perils in the wilderness and perils danger in the sea and perils danger from false brethren i think these had to be the worst violently opposed by those who claimed to be part of the same body and work as he was not so different than judas in weariness and painfulness sadness travail and watchings often sleepless nights and hunger and thirst he wasn't being put up in a nice hotel by the local church and going out to nice meals at a restaurant and fastings often that's going hungry this isn't a reference to voluntary fasting and process of seeking the lord paul missed a lot of meals cold nakedness insufficient clothing shivering in the cold beside those things that are without in addition to all this that which comes upon me daily because of my burden the care of all the churches he illustrates who's weak and i'm not weak when i hear of someone's weakness i feel their weakness i share that weakness who's offended and i burn not who's led astray and i don't burn with anger and sorrow and indignation for them if i must needs glory if i have to boast or brag to get your attention you corinthians he's saying i will boast of the things which concern my infirmities those things which render me weak and contemptible in the eyes of my opponents the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed forever knows that i'm didn't tell you the pack of lies here that's true i'm speaking truthfully and speaking plainly he gives one last example here he says when i was in damascus a pretty big city the governor under orechus the king kept the city of damascus with a garrison a garrison of soldiers trying to apprehend me and through a window in a basket i was let down by the wall and escaped his hands in other words he was helped by some locals willing to put themselves in danger on paul's behalf in defense of the gospel is that how you see paul in your mind when you read his epistles i think it should be clear to us that living as christians is not a call to a party but to be a party of the cult we have a target painted on our backs that satan sees and he marks us for destruction destruction often by means so subtle we may not even recognize the attack or discern the intent until we're caught in the trap his web of deceit battling in our minds our bodies are both his wrath directed at us it wasn't just people in bible times it wasn't just the early church satan doesn't give up he wants to take with him all that he can we must be watchful and watching out for each other well getting back to paul and the same letter he addresses healing i don't think anyone can doubt paul's faith or the faith of the people offering prayers on paul's behalf yet we read again in second corinthians 12 and verse 7. unless i should be exalted in order to prevent that i be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelation dealing with the equivalent of the deity spirit in his day those who wanted to worship paul substitute the messenger for the message the apostle for the savior that was given to me this was a gift it was given to me a thorn in the flesh if you've ever had a thorn it can be relentless think of uh think of a choya pain infection doesn't go away and this thorn in the flesh that was given to him was a messenger of satan that's always the source god may give him leave to attack but it's not god who attacks and it's not your brother or sister that attacks either this messenger sigma sent to buffett me to buff it that's repeated blows some are hard some may not be may go for a while and then get hit again distracting and annoying at best painful and crippling at worst paul says to prevent that i should be exalted above measure of paul he preaches divine healing tells a good story where's his faith he has his physical problems that just don't get better don't pay any attention to him he's probably a secret sinner remind you a little bit of job for this thing for this thorn for this messenger this gift that buffets me i besought the lord three different times that it might depart from me lord this impediment is causing people to turn from you they won't listen to me it's providing ammunit well arrows in those days arrows for satan's archers to attack the word i'm bringing please lord it's a trivial thing for you to take this from me and maybe sometime later when that prayer didn't seem to be answered lord i heard that jesus told the story the persistent petitioner and the unjust judge who grew worried of her and granted her petition i'm coming back i'm asking humbly for your healing touch on my weak and sickly body three times paul said and then he got his answer he said to me he said to me paul paul my grace my love and kindness my mercy is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect it's fulfilled it's completed it's made manifest it's on display in your weakness wow i'm not gonna grant your request paul because i have a purpose in allowing this trust me paul your weakness reveals my strength most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me may dwell in me may work through me he may pitch his tabernacle his tent over me therefore hard as it is i take pleasure in my infirmities and my weaknesses and reproaches insults and necessities hardships and persecutions and distresses troubles for christ's sake for when i am weak not depending on myself and my abilities and reason then i am strong through christ by faith so we see paul the apostle to the gentiles the messenger the one through whom god established the gentile church the one we look upon as being the messenger to the first church age one of the stars and the hand of jesus and we see him as weak and infirm in the flesh yet so very mighty in the lord and that strength in the lord is revealed through the weakness of his flesh one who preached healing deliverance it was sickly and vexed moving through time to the life and ministry of brother branham we often hear him say that our attitude towards god's promises brings them to pass from early in his ministry this is from expectation in 1950 he says we always get what we expect when people expect anything well they usually get what you look for it's the mental attitude that you have remember this and never forget it the right mental attitude towards any promise of god will bring it to pass the right mental attitude towards any promise of god it doesn't take gifts of healing to heal sick people any person in here has a right to meet satan anywhere if you're a christian and defeat him on any grounds that he could stand on and late in his ministry in 1963 show us the father he says and i go on record i say this about the word of god being a seed if you can take the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god he'll bring it to pass if you can get yourself in position to believe that that promise was to you well you may ask well well what about that brother lyle doesn't that mean that god will always heal us if we approach him correctly if we pray and the person isn't healed doesn't it mean our faith is misplaced or weak paul wasn't healed paul's faith was not misplaced nor was it weak recall brother branham's baby girl lay sick and died suffering he relates us for example and show us the father and it'll satisfy us 1953 he says i stood there when my own baby about 14 years ago 15 my own little baby six months old i was praying for it and it died went out from under my arms and i was walking up the road i lost my father my brother my wife you know my story this was very hard i cannot imagine how hard this is yet he also told us in redemption and completeness in joy 1954 he says if i pray i prayed for 10 000 people tonight and they all died in the morning tomorrow night i'd be back here praying for the sick believing god's word was right that's right if i was dying and 5 000 people that had died 100 years ago been an eternity that long and rose back come to the earth and said brother branham don't you trust it don't trust it we trusted him went failed i'd still say let me die in jesus christ that's right i believe it and that's my whole heart everything is set right in that i believe it with my whole heart i depend on him so not getting our desired result does not diminish god's word god's promises or god's faithfulness we must keep our perspective he is in charge we're told in revelation that we're created to please him and for thy pleasure we are created he wasn't created to please us let's look at another example this one from king david nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the child that uriah's wife barren to david and it was very sick now this is an innocent baby it's from a sinful act but it's an innocent baby the baby didn't participate the baby had nothing to do with it it's a baby it's a baby david therefore besought god for the child david fasted he went in he laid all night on the earth and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise david get up come on no he would not he wouldn't even eat with them seven days it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the servants of david feared to tell them that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive and we spoke to him he wouldn't hearken to our voice how will he then fix himself if we tell him that the child is dead but when david saw that his servants whispered david perceived the baby had died therefore david said to his servants is the child dead and they said yeah yeah he's dead then david arose from the earth then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshiped was he sad was he grieving of course yet he immediately worshipped the one who seemingly had not answered his prayers certainly not in the way that he had hoped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat then said his servants him what is this that you've done you fast and wept for the child while it was alive but the child's dead and you rise up and eat bread this is not our custom when someone dies we have we said chev of seven days we're in mourning what's going on david and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept i sought the lord i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he's dead why should i fast can i bring him back again someday i'll go to him but he's not going to return to me the key to all this is that our prayers with that correct mental attitude must be within the will of god remember jesus being tested at the start of his ministry cast yourself down make these stones into bread what about in gethsemane mark 14 verse 32 we read they came to a place which was named gethsemane and jesus said to his disciples sit here while i pray and you took with him peter and james and john and began to be sore amazed and very heavy he said to them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death terry here watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground kind of like david did so many years earlier and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him this is the request of jesus to the father this is jesus desire and he said abba father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me but here comes the key jesus knew and he expressed it so that we could learn from him nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt the context of our life here in america and throughout much of what we call the western world is that of a representative government we we vote right we express our will when jesus was before pilate jesus said that his kingdom was not of this earth during his ministry he spoke many parables illustrating what he called not the republic of god the kingdom of god we must realize that god is sovereign it's all about him it is not about us he redeemed us he got us out of satan's pawn shop that makes us his property we must never forget that he's not a genie in the bottle that we can summon when we need something done he's not a power tool in our toolbox that we can apply when we want to accomplish our will or clay on his potter's wheel he's free to smash us reshape us fire us in the kiln he sees the bigger picture the big picture eternity and the spiritual realms we see a little picture a physical universe and a short life within it doesn't mean that it's easy when we see a loved one or ourselves suffering dying but it also does not mean that god does not care when his will doesn't match our desires that's one of the reasons jesus described the holy ghost the holy spirit when he comes he'll be the comforter who needs comforting when everything's going wonderfully well it's when we're suffering when we're distraught bewildered even angry that we need comforting the presence of those that we know care and no one cares for us more than him look what he did for us to redeem us from that pawn shop and that's a role that he loves why because it deepens our relationship with him and his with us and in the end it's all about relationship the law calvary the church ages all of it our relationship with him remember jesus was asked what is the first what is the greatest what is the most important commandment and he said love the lord your god that's relationship with god and he added and the second is just like it love your neighbor so it's our relationship with him and our relationship with each other that's what matters god's kingdom is not a representative democracy we don't have a vote but we do have a choice to accept his grace or to reject it to follow him or not but he is sovereign listen to david's prayer as he equipped solomon to build the temple find this in first chronicles chapter 29 wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation and david said listen closely to this prayer blessed be thou lord god of israel our father forever and ever thine o lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art exalted as head above all i'm closing this portion of the service now david's inspired words are almost identical to what we call the lord's prayer we find this in matthew 6 think about what we just read the david said after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come that will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen so be it so my brothers and my sisters pray earnestly in faith nothing doubting but if healing or deliverance doesn't come not the way that you think it should be or the way that you want it don't give up don't be discouraged don't blame yourself if only my faith were stronger i thought if i believed but it didn't happen god has the big picture in mind preparing us for realms that we only know by faith we know that all things work together for our good who are called of god according to his purpose as paul said now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face as brother aaron comes to end the service sing with me and help me find the right key job's god maybe we'll start with the chorus though oh god slay me at all trust him i shall then come forth as gold [Music] and i know my redeemer lived for i fear him in my soul when i float all around me and his face i cannot see yet i know that through the ladders he beholdeth even me [Music] though god slay me yet i'll trust him i shall then come forth as gold for i know my redeemers live for i feel him in my soul and o god slay me yet i'll trust him i shall then come forth as gold [Music] how many times we we're tempted or we give into it to go to the lord and say i don't just understand lord why why it's got to be this way and why it's got to go it's not the plans that i had it's not how i thought it should be but even he when he came to gethsemane and he said not my will but thy will be done and we find that when we finally get to that point where we let it go and say god whatever you desire there's a peace that comes with it there's some an assurance that comes in your heart said god is god is in control it doesn't make the pathway any easier you still have your troubles you don't but there's an assurance that he'll go with me amen sometimes it's good to be reminded through the scriptures through the events of other people's lives that god has has recorded for us to see that each one of us has a has our battles has our life to live but he is king and lord of it all amen if you'll stand with me open my eyes lord i want to see jesus he said but my eyes are open then lord focus my eyes to you open my i want to see jesus [Music] to reach [Music] and say that we love you [Music] open my ears and help me to [Music] my eyes on i want to see jesus [Music] i want to see jesus [Music] to reach out and touch him and say that we love [Music] open our ears [Music] and help us to live [Music] we want to see jesus [Music] you look at the life of job sometimes and you wonder how could a man bear what he went through but when your vision is looking at the lord when your vision has seen that it helps you to go through those things i sometimes i've read the the history or the the story of of different famous christians that were well known life was not easy life was a struggle life was hard but their vision was that end goal not only for them but lord for those around me that i could take them with me wanting wanting to share that i thought how many times jesus looked over jerusalem and said jerusalem jerusalem how oft and if you go back to the scriptures and you see how many times he looked over israel even with moses even with david and that was the heart of god reaching out he does the same thing with us and he says son daughter what you're going through is good for you what you're going through will teach you will come bring you under subjection for that other life that other world and so we say lord i surrender all brother matthew had to sing great is thy faithfulness and sing that chorus [Music] faithfulness morning my morning new mercies i see all i have needed thy hand has provided [Music] great is our faithfulness [Music] lord and one more time the chorus great is thy faithfulness great is thy faithfulness morning by morning new mercies i see all i have needed thy hand has provided praise thy faith all i have needed thy hands for not all i have wanted not all that i thought was best for me but lord you know what i needed by hand has provided and i appreciate let's pray lord today maybe maybe we didn't come expecting something like that we're thinking but you just wanted to remind us that you're our hope you're our all in all lord even some of the things that that we've heard in the last few days or maybe read or something branham said or read in the scriptures lord a surrendered yielded heart saying lord not my will but thy will be done is what you desire lord and and then when when a person gets to that point lord like you'd come and you draw close to them your not become night to them lord jesus and sometimes it takes some affliction and sometimes it's like some hard times and takes a battle to get us to that place and say lord i really need you and you say that's what i've been waiting for son and daughter lord lord may we ever say lord not my will but thy will be done is our prayer lord we thank you for your word today lord may it be take an effect and be effective in us we ask in jesus christ's name amen god's word never fails it is true it is constant amen so lord willing we'll meet sunday see what god has for us he never fails us just come believing so kind of looking a little further on um possibly brother reggie platt being with us the last sunday of this month brother john mcfadden this first sunday of january and then harmony starting on the 12th and brother uh tim cross being with us on that following sunday so you pray say lord have your own way you know and we'll just believe that together amen as you go great is thy faithfulness great is thy faithfulness morning my morning new mercies i see all i have needed thy hands have provided [Music] [Music] be the glory to god be the glory for the things he [Music] has he has saved me by his power he has raised me to god for the things he has done to be the glory to god be the glory to god be the glory for the things he has done with his he has raised [Music] for the things he has done [Music] how sweet the sound [Music] like me i once [Music] i was [Music] twas grace [Music] all his grace my fears [Music] first [Music] oh i have already [Music] when we've been [Music] [Applause] [Music] we know this day [Music] praise god praise our [Music] god praise god praise god praise [Music] god god [Music] it's [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
