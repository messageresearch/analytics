[37:06] last week but at David Williams
[37:09] Funeral
[37:11] um it was
[37:13] a we had a reception afterwards and
[37:17] probably not too many people here were
[37:21] there um but I was sitting with uh think
[37:26] sitting marily I think I was sitting
[37:27] with you and and some other people and
[37:30] um and I looked over and I see this
[37:32] table over there and I see this lady
[37:35] sitting there and uh she has a young
[37:40] lady it's an older lady was sitting
[37:42] there and she has a young lady and a
[37:43] young man maybe 12 12 years old or so
[37:47] and sitting all by themselves so I
[37:50] figured well I'll go over and and talk
[37:54] with them like like I do and and uh
[37:57] walked over there and I sat down and I
[38:00] could
[38:01] smell the remnants of cigarette
[38:05] smoke and uh she
[38:07] was kind of a a
[38:10] rough lady and I sat down and I said can
[38:14] I sit here she says yeah sure you know
[38:15] make yourself at
[38:17] home okay and uh I started I started
[38:22] talking I I mentioned to the to the two
[38:24] kids there I said uh I said 'is this
[38:27] your grandma and they said no that's our
[38:31] mom
[38:33] no hope for
[38:36] two I said oh okay all right so um I
[38:40] started started talking to her a little
[38:42] bit more and and uh I was like just
[38:46] looking at
[38:47] her there wasn't much there it would be
[38:51] easy to judge this
[38:54] lady
[38:55] and as I was talking I said I said
[38:59] sister I said do you know the Lord Jesus
[39:02] she says I sure
[39:04] do and I said uh I said well good um did
[39:08] you know David Williams she says she
[39:10] says yeah David and I have known each
[39:12] other and I was in my missionary mode I
[39:15] was in my witnessing mode I wanted I
[39:17] wanted to lead this lady to the Lord
[39:19] Jesus and as I started talking to her my
[39:22] perspective started to
[39:25] change
[39:27] turns out that that young man and that
[39:30] young lady that were there were not her
[39:32] biological children they were adopted
[39:35] children they were they were foster
[39:38] children and as I started talking with
[39:42] her I started talking about the Lord and
[39:45] she was talking back with me about the
[39:47] Lord and I could see that this lady knew
[39:50] her Bible she knew her word and I said I
[39:54] said so what do you do
[39:57] and she says well I serve the Lord she
[39:59] says I have
[40:01] fostered
[40:05] 185 foster
[40:07] children and I've adopted
[40:10] eight and she said I have pictures of
[40:13] every single one of them by my my dining
[40:16] room table so I can see them every time
[40:18] I sit down and eat and she says I pray
[40:20] for them every
[40:22] day and I looked
[40:25] and
[40:27] and then she kept talking and she Saidi
[40:30] introduced every single one of these
[40:33] kids to the Lord Jesus she says I bring
[40:36] him to church she says we sit around the
[40:38] table we have Bible study we talk about
[40:41] the Lord Jesus she said many of them
[40:43] have strayed she said but every one of
[40:46] them has been introduced to Jesus
[40:49] Christ and I
[40:51] thought sister Angela I thought if I
[40:55] would have told her
[40:57] well here's what you need to do you need
[40:58] to quit smoking you need to start
[40:59] growing your hair out you need to wash
[41:01] your face you need to change your
[41:02] clothes if I would have started saying
[41:05] that she might have looked at me and
[41:07] said young
[41:09] man she could say it I'm
[41:13] 52 like to
[41:15] think young man I have raised I have
[41:19] fostered 18
[41:21] 185 children adopted eight introduced
[41:24] the Lord Jesus Christ to every every
[41:26] single one of them and what have you
[41:28] done in your
[41:30] life if there would have been anything
[41:32] to me and if she would have said that I
[41:33] would have put my head down and I I
[41:35] would have said nothing compared to
[41:38] you thinking about that
[41:40] lady I called
[41:42] her
[41:45] yesterday and I said I just wanted to
[41:47] ask you is it okay if I talk about you
[41:49] to the church she said yeah that'd be
[41:52] fine she says I have a question for you
[41:55] she says
[41:56] and she kind of broke up she said David
[42:00] Williams she said did he know the Lord
[42:04] Jesus she said did he have a
[42:07] relationship with the Lord and I could
[42:09] tell that meant something to
[42:11] her imagine the burden that this lady
[42:14] had looking the way she did acting the
[42:16] way she did and I would have most
[42:18] certainly judged her I did Judge Her
[42:21] thinking that I need to lead this lady
[42:23] to the Lord and now she's preaching to
[42:25] me I'm the pastor of a
[42:27] church and she
[42:30] says I just always wondered and I said
[42:32] sister I said I have talked with David
[42:35] Williams many
[42:36] times and I said we have prayed together
[42:39] we have talked about the Lord together I
[42:41] said he and I have have had this
[42:43] Fellowship Around Jesus Christ and yes
[42:45] most certainly he knew the Lord she said
[42:48] I've been so worried about that
[42:52] brother thinking about how
[42:58] we can look at
[43:00] someone and judge that person just on
[43:03] their
[43:04] appearance and I can look and I can say
[43:07] I think this sister has done more for
[43:11] the Lord than I have in my whole life I
[43:14] admire
[43:16] her then I at that
[43:19] same meeting after that same dinner I
[43:22] talked to another
[43:25] man
[43:26] and I started talking about the Lord I
[43:28] started talking about going to church as
[43:29] somebody I
[43:31] knew and I said hey do you ever you ever
[43:33] think about going to church he said no
[43:35] he says I don't need to go to church I
[43:38] said
[43:39] okay he says I get to I get church out
[43:42] in the
[43:43] mountains he says that's where I find
[43:45] God and I said well that's
[43:49] good but that's not the word and I
[43:52] started thinking about this this man and
[43:55] I think if I could go to the mountains
[43:57] and I could I could pray like I like to
[44:00] do I go up into this place in the
[44:02] catalinas and I pray up there and I feel
[44:04] like I get so close to God if I could do
[44:07] that rather than coming to church on
[44:09] Sunday sometimes I feel like I would do
[44:12] well but that's not the
[44:14] word job found
[44:17] God up in the mountains he found God in
[44:21] nature but job didn't have the word he
[44:25] didn't have the bible to read
[44:27] all he had was looking and seeing God
[44:30] around him but the word says that we
[44:33] should come
[44:34] together to
[44:37] worship Psalm
[44:39] 138 says that g that God has exalted his
[44:45] word and his
[44:48] Spirit those two together you almost
[44:51] can't separate them that they are
[44:54] together and and how God loves his word
[44:57] and he has given as I read in the in
[44:59] Psalm 119 he has given us this word to
[45:02] light our path and we don't take it
[45:04] seriously enough God bless you
[45:09] sweetheart Sunday school's let letting
[45:11] out we uh by the way I think brother
[45:13] Josiah made the announcement we're going
[45:15] to start meeting in the fellowship we're
[45:17] going to start meeting here oh you
[45:20] forgot is it still
[45:21] here we are next
[45:24] week it's just the Lord he's good to us
[45:27] isn't
[45:28] he uh no that's okay next week we are
[45:31] going to meet all the Sunday school kids
[45:34] are going to meet in the sanctuary and
[45:37] then we will dismiss Sunday school from
[45:40] the
[45:40] sanctuary then that will go and then I
[45:43] want them to have about 15 extra minutes
[45:46] for the Sunday School teachers so next
[45:49] week all the kids you come to the
[45:53] sanctuary and then the worship leader
[45:56] will dismiss the Sunday schools are we
[45:58] together
[46:05] okay we might not
[46:07] like something that the that the word
[46:12] says but it's still the word and we
[46:16] still have to abide by
[46:18] it and the word is meant if you look in
[46:22] the Old Testament it's very specific
[46:26] from everything from from the the um the
[46:30] the priest's garments and and the
[46:32] tassels and the lengths and and how the
[46:35] the Tabernacle is built to all the
[46:37] Commandments it's very specific but then
[46:40] when you get to the New Testament it
[46:42] becomes very
[46:44] Broad and it's not it's not specific
[46:47] like it was in the New Testament because
[46:49] in the Old Testament something
[46:51] changed you have in the Old Testament it
[46:53] says Thou shalt not commit adultery very
[46:56] black and
[46:56] white very plain but then Jesus says
[47:01] that no he says that if you just want to
[47:04] be with a woman that's not your wife you
[47:06] have committed adultery it's meant not
[47:10] to be a hard fast rule it's meant to for
[47:15] the the believer to ponder upon these
[47:18] things to study them to get quiet in
[47:22] your room and say Lord how does this
[47:25] affect my life how does this scripture
[47:30] what what does it have for
[47:35] me and
[47:39] then we don't just come to church to
[47:43] hear the
[47:44] word we get the word every day if you're
[47:47] coming just Sunday morning you're you're
[47:49] you're starving to death that Bible
[47:52] needs to be read every day all the time
[47:56] I was praying
[48:00] about how to present
[48:04] this to the people this thought that I
[48:06] have about
[48:09] applying what you read in the book and
[48:13] then I just turned in my Bible the
[48:15] Proverbs chapter 29 I w't I won't read
[48:18] it but it's about correcting a
[48:24] child and and it says that if if this
[48:27] child is not disciplined then he will
[48:29] bring shame upon his mother and in
[48:31] another place it says if you spare the
[48:32] rod you spoil the child child but how
[48:36] did how would that affect Mama
[48:38] V this lady that I was talking about
[48:41] that was at the at the table how would
[48:43] that affect sister Angela over here and
[48:45] brother
[48:47] Jeremy they
[48:50] can't operate like these are their and
[48:53] then we pray about it so we can't apply
[48:55] it in our own lives brother brandom said
[48:57] this he said the revelation of Jesus
[49:01] Christ who he is and what he is now the
[49:04] next great thing we find out that he
[49:07] hates anything that'll put any R
[49:10] anything to rule over his church besides
[49:14] himself because he is a jealous
[49:17] God anything outside of Christ any
[49:21] Doctrine or or anything that deviates
[49:24] from the cross is something that is
[49:27] added and if we are if we take a
[49:29] Doctrine and we form our religion around
[49:32] that not only is it away from the
[49:35] teaching of the Bible but we're not even
[49:37] Christians
[49:38] anymore if our Doctrine gets away from
[49:42] Jesus we're not even
[49:46] Christians there's a brother here I
[49:48] think brother Jordan was here maybe
[49:50] brother Arie but there was a brother
[49:52] here a few months ago couple months ago
[49:56] and he was
[49:59] talking to me about a shift that he has
[50:03] seen in the ministry now this brother's
[50:05] been around for a long time he's not a
[50:07] pastor but he's been
[50:10] around the brother brandom's message for
[50:13] a long time and he he's very well-versed
[50:15] very intelligent brother and he says
[50:18] I've seen a shift from these type A
[50:21] Personalities in these ministers that
[50:24] they're all about fighting and they're
[50:26] all about their own Doctrine and they're
[50:27] all about getting their own message out
[50:29] and if someone doesn't agree with them
[50:32] then they will attack and they'll fight
[50:33] and we've seen this over the decades and
[50:35] he said but he said I think that they
[50:38] needed to be that way because they had
[50:40] to get the word out but he says I have
[50:42] seen a
[50:44] shift in the Ministries and he said like
[50:47] he says these new ministers he says this
[50:50] next Generation he was he was telling me
[50:53] he said you're not about
[50:56] this building your own kingdom anymore
[50:59] he said you are now shifting away from
[51:02] that and you are now putting Christ in
[51:06] in the front of the people and not so
[51:08] much
[51:10] yourself we
[51:13] see there is a generation rising
[51:18] up that's not going to stand for this
[51:21] sectarian way of thinking this divisive
[51:24] way of thinking this generation is going
[51:26] to take God at his
[51:29] word it isn't about friends it's not
[51:32] about
[51:33] celebrity it's not about who is speaking
[51:35] at the church or who's leading worship I
[51:38] believe that we are going to see and I
[51:40] believe it with all my heart I believe
[51:41] that we are going to see a generation
[51:43] that finally puts Christ first and will
[51:46] not compromise on the word and I want to
[51:49] be in that
[51:52] generation I do I see a generation
[51:56] that is going to take God at his word
[51:59] and put Christ first so I was back here
[52:03] praying sitting in my chair and I was
[52:06] like Lord I I feel like there's
[52:09] something
[52:10] missing looking at my notes
[52:13] and Lord I I just don't feel that this
[52:17] is this is complete so something told me
[52:22] and I was thinking about this next
[52:23] Generation I was think about these young
[52:28] people and I was saying Lord what's
[52:32] what's right and something I won't say
[52:35] something said it but I just had a had a
[52:38] desire I saw Josiah and Katie and Daniel
[52:42] were upstairs in the upper room
[52:45] practicing and I
[52:47] felt
[52:50] led to go
[52:53] up and ask
[52:56] Katie give me a
[52:58] scripture I need something give me a
[53:01] scripture so I walked up there and I
[53:04] knew that that this generation I just
[53:08] felt this generation is going to put
[53:09] Christ first I walked up to walked up to
[53:13] the upper room and there's Katie and
[53:15] Josiah sitting there and and they're
[53:16] practicing and I hand my Bible to Sister
[53:19] Katie and I said give me a
[53:21] scripture and she looks and like
[53:26] she said 'w what what do you mean she
[53:27] said new testament old testament I said
[53:29] I don't care just give me a scripture
[53:31] and I'm sorry I make you
[53:34] nervous it's my
[53:36] personality I said just give me one and
[53:39] she was like well like I just give me
[53:41] one and she's she's flipping
[53:45] around I like Katie just give me a
[53:48] scripture and she's like well um and
[53:51] then she's still flipping and she flips
[53:54] and she gets to Philippians I said just
[53:56] stop I said right there just give me one
[53:58] so she looks and she says and she points
[54:01] brother Jordan if you could put it up
[54:02] Philippians chapter 2 verse
[54:05] 5 and she points she says okay
[54:09] here listen to this next Generation I
[54:12] believe that this represents
[54:14] it let this mind be in you which was
[54:17] also in Christ Jesus who being in the
[54:20] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[54:23] equal with God but made made himself of
[54:26] no reputation and took upon him the form
[54:29] of a servant and was made in the
[54:32] likeness of
[54:33] men and being found in fashion as a man
[54:38] he humbled himself and became obedient
[54:40] unto death even the death of the
[54:44] Cross wherefore God
[54:48] also ha highly exalted him and given him
[54:53] a
[54:54] name which is above every
[54:57] name that the name of Jesus that at the
[55:01] name of Jesus every knee should bow of
[55:04] the things of things in heaven and
[55:06] things in Earth and the things under the
[55:08] Earth and that every tongue should
[55:10] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[55:15] glory of God the Father it was perfect
[55:20] in line with what I wanted to minister
[55:22] today and that is getting into this word
[55:26] and getting away from all of our own
[55:29] ideas and getting back to the Lord Jesus
[55:33] Christ
[55:38] perfect
[55:40] amen 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 17
[55:46] listen to
[55:47] this for Christ sent me not to baptize
[55:52] but to preach the gospel not with the
[55:54] wisdom of word words lest the Cross of
[55:57] Christ should be made of none effect how
[56:00] do you make the cross of none
[56:04] effect how do you do that by coming up
[56:08] with some new revelation of or something
[56:11] bigger than the cross and then the
[56:13] ministry gets built around that and we
[56:16] make the cross of none effect we just
[56:19] leave it we just leave it now it's about
[56:22] my Ministry now it's about my Revelation
[56:25] those Revelations might be right but
[56:28] when we get away from the
[56:30] cross and you
[56:33] think really brother Lionel the cross
[56:37] and the story of the cross and Jesus
[56:40] dying at the on the cross it doesn't
[56:43] glorify any of
[56:45] us it's something that one man
[56:47] did 2,000 years ago that affects every
[56:51] person who has ever lived on the face of
[56:52] the
[56:53] Earth the death burial and resurrection
[56:56] of Jesus Christ is the most momentous
[56:58] occasion in the history of the
[57:01] Earth but so often it's not enough we
[57:06] want some revelation we want to point to
[57:09] to something
[57:10] else for the preaching of the Cross to
[57:14] them that perish is foolishness it's not
[57:17] enough but unto us which are saved it is
[57:20] the power of
[57:23] God for it is written I will destroy the
[57:27] wisdom of the wise and I will bring
[57:28] nothing to the nothing the understand
[57:31] bring to nothing the understanding of
[57:32] The Prudent where is the wise where is
[57:36] the Scribe where is the disputer of this
[57:38] world ha not God made foolishness
[57:41] foolish the wisdom of this
[57:43] world for after that in the wisdom of
[57:47] God the World by wisdom knew not God it
[57:51] pleased God by the foolishness of
[57:53] preaching to save them that
[57:58] believe
[58:00] everyone and we have to be careful
[58:02] because we're all like that everyone has
[58:04] a new
[58:06] revelation a new something new that
[58:08] makes them more special that than
[58:10] someone else and sometimes I want to say
[58:12] just just brother just read the
[58:15] word just read the
[58:18] Bible that is the absolute word of God
[58:23] is this Bible
[58:25] but we want something more
[58:28] dramatic we want something that will
[58:30] exalt ourselves above above the others
[58:34] it's like with this rock with Moses
[58:35] here's this rock it's just so
[58:38] anticlimactic to speak to it it's so
[58:40] much better if you just hit it if you
[58:42] smite it but no God just wanted his word
[58:47] spoken and then God would have brought
[58:51] forth the water just like he promised
[58:53] but instead we sh shift into
[58:56] something that's beyond the word or
[58:59] outside of the word the Bible says the I
[59:03] believe it's David that he writes the
[59:06] law on his
[59:09] bedst he it's everywhere in front of him
[59:11] it's constantly he's constantly
[59:13] reminiscing about the law like I read
[59:15] Psalm 119 it's always in his mind it's
[59:17] always in front of his
[59:19] eyes and that's the way it should be all
[59:21] the
[59:22] time 2 Corinthians
[59:26] s chapter
[59:29] 3 look at how much brothers and sisters
[59:32] the word should be greater today than it
[59:37] is Do We Begin Again to commend
[59:43] ourselves or do we need as some others
[59:46] Epistles of commendation from you or
[59:48] letters of commendation from you you're
[59:50] going from place to place do you need to
[59:52] carry a letter with you saying you're
[59:54] from the two sign
[59:57] Tabernacle or do you need to bring a
[59:59] letter saying that that you're from this
[1:00:02] congregation or or that the pastor
[1:00:04] recommends you to preach at another
[1:00:06] church do you need
[1:00:08] that you are our epistle written in our
[1:00:12] hearts known and read of all men your
[1:00:15] very life is a letter that everyone can
[1:00:19] read your Li and your
[1:00:21] lives are written in our hearts
[1:00:27] that's
[1:00:29] beautiful not only are you out
[1:00:32] representing Jesus Christ but here at
[1:00:35] home brother your life is written on my
[1:00:38] heart I want you I want to see you out
[1:00:41] there I want to see you succeeding I
[1:00:42] want to see you spreading this
[1:00:45] gospel Hano I want to see you doing the
[1:00:48] will of God leading people like like you
[1:00:52] wrote that testimony and pray praying
[1:00:54] for your friend leading people to this
[1:00:57] Jesus Christ that we
[1:00:59] know you're written on my heart
[1:01:02] brother I want to see it you don't need
[1:01:06] a letter of
[1:01:08] commendation right you need a life for
[1:01:12] as much as you are manifestly declared
[1:01:14] to be Epistles of Christ ministered by
[1:01:17] US Written not with ink but with the
[1:01:20] spirit of the Living God not in tables
[1:01:22] of stone but in fleshy fleshy tables of
[1:01:25] the heart
[1:01:26] amen whenever you go wherever whatever
[1:01:29] you are doing wherever you go you are
[1:01:33] representing Jesus
[1:01:35] Christ I heard a
[1:01:38] story
[1:01:41] about sister that uh I don't know
[1:01:44] probably I don't know if anybody knows
[1:01:45] her here but going out and she was
[1:01:48] driving and then this kid gets behind
[1:01:52] her who I know and and he wants to say
[1:01:55] hi to
[1:01:56] her so he's behind and he's honking hey
[1:02:00] honking at
[1:02:01] her hey you know want to get her
[1:02:03] attention she s sticks her hand out the
[1:02:06] window and she wasn't calling him number
[1:02:13] one somebody's always watching
[1:02:17] you what a
[1:02:19] disgrace to
[1:02:21] someone that claims to believe brother
[1:02:24] bram's message that claims that oh we
[1:02:27] put brother brandom first we put we we
[1:02:30] lift him up and and we won't even hear
[1:02:32] anyone else because of how great he is
[1:02:34] and then you're doing that
[1:02:36] sis I don't think
[1:02:39] so and I look at all of us and what do
[1:02:42] you
[1:02:44] do what do I
[1:02:48] do will I criticize a brother or
[1:02:52] sister the Bible says never speak speak
[1:02:54] something bad about anyone it says to do
[1:02:57] good that to those that hate you and to
[1:03:00] pray for those that despitefully use you
[1:03:03] what do I
[1:03:04] do for the young
[1:03:06] people the Bible says
[1:03:09] forbids sex before marriage forbids it
[1:03:13] very plain and yet what do we
[1:03:17] do the Bible says many other
[1:03:21] things and we should sit and read this
[1:03:24] Bible and say Lord how does this apply
[1:03:27] to my own
[1:03:29] life but we get stuck glorifying
[1:03:32] ourselves and bragging about how great
[1:03:34] we are and we forget those
[1:03:37] things I say it often just be a
[1:03:40] Christian well we have the message we
[1:03:43] have we have this Revelation that
[1:03:44] Revelation just be a
[1:03:47] Christian that's the most important
[1:03:49] thing and then the Lord then the Lord he
[1:03:51] won't add to Christ I promise you that
[1:03:53] but he will help you and me with our
[1:03:56] change in our bodies Our change in our
[1:04:00] lives verse four and such trust have we
[1:04:04] through Christ to
[1:04:06] godward not that we are sufficient of
[1:04:09] ourselves to think anything of ourselves
[1:04:12] but our sufficiency is of
[1:04:15] God who also hath made us able Ministers
[1:04:18] of the New
[1:04:19] Testament not of the letter but of the
[1:04:22] spirit for the kth but the spirit giveth
[1:04:25] life but if the ministration of death
[1:04:28] written and engraved in stone was
[1:04:30] glorious so that the children of Israel
[1:04:33] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[1:04:35] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[1:04:37] which the glory was to be done
[1:04:40] away very
[1:04:44] interesting statement right there Moses
[1:04:48] we go back I don't know 1500 years ago
[1:04:50] or whatever it was before Paul wrote
[1:04:53] this
[1:04:55] Moses he gets up and he he gets the Ten
[1:04:57] Commandments he comes down and he sees
[1:04:59] the people had fallen and started
[1:05:00] worshiping Idols he he gets angry he
[1:05:04] breaks the Commandments and then after
[1:05:07] that God invites him back up to the
[1:05:12] mountain Moses goes up there and he
[1:05:14] spends 40 days with God doesn't eat
[1:05:18] doesn't drink just the glory of God
[1:05:21] sustains him and when he comes down from
[1:05:24] the mountain his face
[1:05:27] glowed just it's amazing thing and they
[1:05:29] look at Moses and and they're they're
[1:05:32] just amazed at Moses's face so Moses
[1:05:36] covers his face with a
[1:05:40] veil because the people they probably
[1:05:43] would have wanted to wait in line just
[1:05:45] to see Moses's
[1:05:49] face so he covered his face with that
[1:05:52] Veil because of this shining that was on
[1:05:55] him but let me tell you something that
[1:05:58] shining that that anointing that was on
[1:06:01] Moses it eventually faded
[1:06:08] away verse eight how shall the
[1:06:10] ministration of the spirit be rather
[1:06:13] glorious for if the ministration of
[1:06:16] condemnation be glory that was Moses
[1:06:19] bringing down the law much more does the
[1:06:22] ministration of righte
[1:06:24] exceed in glory we have a difference
[1:06:27] here he's starting to lay the foundation
[1:06:28] between the Old Testament and the New
[1:06:30] Testament the law was sent to judge it
[1:06:34] was sent to condemn The Sinner and then
[1:06:37] the sinner was required to make an
[1:06:40] atonement for even that which was made
[1:06:43] glorious had no glory in this Respect by
[1:06:45] the reason of the glory that excelth for
[1:06:49] if that which was done away was
[1:06:53] glorious that's this glowing that was on
[1:06:56] Moses's
[1:06:59] face much more that which remaineth is
[1:07:02] glorious the English Standard Version of
[1:07:05] that says for if that was being brought
[1:07:09] to an end came with Glory much more will
[1:07:12] this permanent have
[1:07:15] Glory seeing then that we have such a
[1:07:18] hope we have such great plainness of
[1:07:21] speech in other words since we have such
[1:07:23] hope we are very bold and not as Moses
[1:07:27] which put a veil over his face that the
[1:07:29] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[1:07:31] look to the end of that which was
[1:07:33] abolished he put a a veil over his face
[1:07:36] he was hiding something that was going
[1:07:38] to fade
[1:07:41] away they probably as I said would have
[1:07:45] waited in line to see Moses's
[1:07:50] face and the same thing with the church
[1:07:54] a lot of times we'll see this great
[1:07:57] powerful service or the people will come
[1:07:58] to the altar they'll weep at their their
[1:08:00] seeds but days go by and that Glory that
[1:08:03] was once on them begins to fade just as
[1:08:06] the light was on Moses's face
[1:08:09] Fades but that does not have to
[1:08:12] be this is a different day what they
[1:08:16] didn't have back then is the holy spirit
[1:08:19] of God and once that Holy Spirit comes
[1:08:23] in it doesn't
[1:08:24] fade but the key is to stay in the word
[1:08:27] all the time open up your Bible read the
[1:08:30] scriptures then go then ask the Lord how
[1:08:33] does this apply to my life and God will
[1:08:37] make those scriptures alive as I said in
[1:08:40] Psalm 138 it says that God exalts his
[1:08:44] word and he exalts his spirit and how
[1:08:46] that should be in our lives all the
[1:08:49] time how many times have you heard for
[1:08:52] those that listen
[1:08:54] to brother bram's sermons how many times
[1:08:56] have you heard brother Bram say God is
[1:08:57] his own
[1:08:58] interpreter what does that
[1:09:00] mean have you really sat down and and
[1:09:04] wondered what does it mean that God's
[1:09:06] his own
[1:09:07] interpreter well what what's the
[1:09:09] preacher up there for well what's the
[1:09:11] prophet
[1:09:13] therefore aren't aren't you supposed to
[1:09:15] explain these things to us no that's not
[1:09:17] what he's saying he's saying that when
[1:09:19] you hear the
[1:09:21] word then God will interpret that word
[1:09:25] to manifest itself in your
[1:09:28] life so when you see when you when
[1:09:31] you're reading your Bible and you see
[1:09:33] maybe 1 Timothy
[1:09:36] 2:9 says a woman shall Adorn herself in
[1:09:39] modest apparal with shamefacedness and
[1:09:41] sobriety not with gold or pearls or
[1:09:43] costly array you can read that word you
[1:09:47] can sit down you say
[1:09:50] Lord how do you want me to apply this in
[1:09:53] my life
[1:09:54] yes or the man when it says in Hebrews
[1:09:59] that that don't neglect the assembling
[1:10:03] of yourselves together especially as you
[1:10:05] see the day approaching how do Lord how
[1:10:07] does that affect me here's my family
[1:10:09] Lord what do you want me to do here
[1:10:12] maybe I need to step it up in my life
[1:10:15] for my kid's
[1:10:17] sake and I need to set that example it
[1:10:20] says in 1 Corinthians 11 that the man is
[1:10:22] the head of the wife as Christ is the
[1:10:24] head of the man so what does that mean
[1:10:26] that means that I need to live a life
[1:10:29] like Christ did before the church I need
[1:10:32] to live that life in front of my
[1:10:35] family need to
[1:10:37] have our devotions and our Bible studies
[1:10:41] around the family
[1:10:43] table as a
[1:10:45] dad I look
[1:10:47] at a man and that man needs to be able
[1:10:50] to take that word or that woman needs to
[1:10:53] be able to take that word and apply it
[1:10:54] to their own life Lord what does this
[1:10:57] mean what do you want from
[1:11:02] me but their minds verse 14 but their
[1:11:06] minds he's speaking of the people that
[1:11:09] just have
[1:11:11] this lifeless
[1:11:15] religion but their minds were blinded
[1:11:18] for until this day remaineth the same
[1:11:21] Veil untaken away
[1:11:24] in reading of the Old Testament which
[1:11:27] Veil is done away in
[1:11:30] Christ another translation says but
[1:11:32] their minds were hardened for to this
[1:11:34] day when they read the old Covenant the
[1:11:37] same Veil remains unlifted because only
[1:11:40] through Christ it is taken
[1:11:44] away he's saying that the people can
[1:11:46] read the word but they don't get it they
[1:11:49] they should be able to read Leviticus
[1:11:50] and see the sacrifices the scapegoat and
[1:11:53] the wave Chief and the sin offering all
[1:11:55] of that represented Christ it was
[1:11:57] manifested when Christ
[1:11:59] came Christ is the entire mystery of God
[1:12:03] revealed in the New Testament the New
[1:12:05] Testament isn't just writings in the
[1:12:07] Bible after Jesus was born it is a
[1:12:09] testament that all the Old Testament
[1:12:12] taught all the teachings in the Old
[1:12:14] Testament was fulfilled in this man
[1:12:16] named Jesus Christ that's what make the
[1:12:18] old Old Testament so beautiful I love
[1:12:21] reading the Old Testament because I can
[1:12:23] see here is Jesus all the way through
[1:12:26] and then in the New Testament
[1:12:28] wow fulfilled over and over again that's
[1:12:32] why Paul the very end of Paul's life he
[1:12:35] was reading his Bible the Old Testament
[1:12:39] and people were coming in and Paul was
[1:12:41] showing them
[1:12:43] look this this scapegoat going out
[1:12:47] whatever it is these prophecies are
[1:12:50] fulfilled in this man named Jesus Christ
[1:12:53] and people would come from near and far
[1:12:55] just to hear this wisdom of Paul and he
[1:12:57] would tell them about this man Jesus
[1:12:59] Christ fulfilled the Old
[1:13:03] Testament it showed that he is the
[1:13:05] fullness Jesus of the
[1:13:08] godhead he is the fullness of every
[1:13:11] sacrifice he's the fullness of every
[1:13:12] prophecy he is
[1:13:16] everything and he replaced in this
[1:13:18] atonement that Jesus made it replaced an
[1:13:21] atonement that was imperfect
[1:13:25] a goat can't die for
[1:13:27] me a lamb can't die for me only Jesus
[1:13:31] Christ could die for me it just makes
[1:13:33] the Old Testament so much more beautiful
[1:13:35] when you see it was
[1:13:37] fulfilled in Jesus Christ and the same
[1:13:39] thing with preaching the word today it
[1:13:41] does not do any good to sit and listen
[1:13:43] to a sermon preached unless that spirit
[1:13:47] is made alive in us and God is
[1:13:50] interpreting what that Minister says or
[1:13:53] what what that what reading the Bible
[1:13:55] says or the sermon that you're listening
[1:13:56] to it doesn't do any good until we are
[1:13:58] quickened with the Holy Spirit and it's
[1:14:00] made alive in
[1:14:03] us that Veil there was a veil that that
[1:14:07] they set up in the Tabernacle that Moses
[1:14:09] set up that that was a barrier between
[1:14:12] The Mercy Seat the holy of holies and
[1:14:15] one time a year that priest could go in
[1:14:18] there and he would go in and the power
[1:14:21] of God would come down and it was only
[1:14:23] that priest that could do it and he
[1:14:25] would make the atonement for the sins
[1:14:27] for the people but now when Jesus Christ
[1:14:30] died on the cross there was that curtain
[1:14:33] that veil was there it was ripped
[1:14:36] into symbolizing that now you can come
[1:14:39] to Christ and you don't have to go
[1:14:41] through a priest you don't have to go
[1:14:43] through
[1:14:45] anyone that's the whole meaning behind
[1:14:48] the Old Testament here it is and now you
[1:14:51] can go to Christ yourself amen you don't
[1:14:54] need
[1:14:59] someone verse 15 is that where I'm at
[1:15:03] but even today even this day when Moses
[1:15:06] is R the veil is still upon their heart
[1:15:10] and it's so sad that when a person is
[1:15:12] stuck in their religion or their
[1:15:14] denomination that they make the
[1:15:16] preaching of Christ of none effect
[1:15:19] because it's not about Christ
[1:15:22] anymore
[1:15:24] they still
[1:15:25] think that it's through their righteous
[1:15:28] Deeds that they'll receive Mercy you
[1:15:30] can't be righteous I think it was Isaiah
[1:15:33] that said Your Righteous Deeds are
[1:15:34] filthy rags to God brother random said I
[1:15:38] love this quote Grace is what God did
[1:15:41] for you and works sorry I already read
[1:15:44] that one brother Jordan and works is
[1:15:46] what you do for
[1:15:48] God what a what
[1:15:50] a I mean very wise statement
[1:15:55] Grace was there for me but now I love
[1:15:59] him so much here's my Works Lord here's
[1:16:02] what I want to do for you then Jesus
[1:16:05] said he also said if you love me keep my
[1:16:08] Commandments nevertheless when it shall
[1:16:11] turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken
[1:16:14] away verse
[1:16:16] 16 nevertheless when it shall turn to
[1:16:19] the Lord that Veil shall be taken away
[1:16:21] so when you finally turn your heart
[1:16:23] heart and your mind to Christ to what he
[1:16:25] did on Calvary to why his blood is an
[1:16:28] atonement when you turn to the message
[1:16:31] of love and patience and forgiveness
[1:16:33] that's not taught in the
[1:16:35] law but is manifested in both the man
[1:16:39] and the message of Jesus
[1:16:42] Christ that's when things change then
[1:16:46] there's no longer a covering over your
[1:16:49] eyes you see you clearly see the
[1:16:53] meaning behind the Old Testament you see
[1:16:56] the meaning of the words of God in Jesus
[1:16:59] Christ becomes real to you and then you
[1:17:01] are filled with his spirit and you
[1:17:03] become one with the word and you are
[1:17:05] reborn into a living breathing disciple
[1:17:10] of Jesus
[1:17:11] Christ and as I said then you are able
[1:17:14] to open your Bible and apply this to
[1:17:16] your own life it shouldn't offend
[1:17:20] you if it's something that disagrees
[1:17:23] with the way that you are living pray
[1:17:25] about it and say Lord where in this word
[1:17:28] what do I need to do to change my life
[1:17:31] because I want to do it because here you
[1:17:33] are here is your perfect word from God
[1:17:37] himself not from a preacher from God
[1:17:40] himself and you're reading it and it you
[1:17:43] need to say Lord how does this effect
[1:17:47] interpret your word to me because I want
[1:17:49] to live up to this
[1:17:52] word
[1:17:53] as I said the men they can open their
[1:17:56] Bible and see that they can be
[1:17:59] more of a husband to their wives they
[1:18:01] can be more of a dad to their children
[1:18:04] and as I said before the new testament's
[1:18:07] vague it's not cut and dry it's vague
[1:18:11] because it allows for the Holy Spirit to
[1:18:14] come in and interpret the law was
[1:18:17] imperfect before but with Christ it
[1:18:20] becomes
[1:18:21] perfect amen
[1:18:24] now the Lord is that
[1:18:27] spirit and where the Lord where the
[1:18:30] spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:18:33] Liberty we see that the Lord here and
[1:18:37] the spirit are the same thing it makes
[1:18:39] not a trinity of three separate but
[1:18:41] equal Gods but of one God operating in
[1:18:45] three different
[1:18:46] capacities but it's one
[1:18:50] God and
[1:18:51] where verse number 18 but we all with
[1:18:56] open face beholding as in a glass the
[1:18:59] glory of the Lord are changed into the
[1:19:02] same image from glory to
[1:19:05] glory even as by the spirit of the
[1:19:08] Lord another translation says and we all
[1:19:12] with unveiled
[1:19:15] face now that's brother one it's not
[1:19:17] going to leave us
[1:19:18] anymore that shining Glory that's that's
[1:19:22] within us now it doesn't
[1:19:25] Fade with an unveiled face beholding the
[1:19:28] glory of the Lord are being transformed
[1:19:30] into the same image from one degree of
[1:19:34] Glory to another as the King James says
[1:19:36] from glory to
[1:19:38] glory for this comes from the Lord who
[1:19:42] is the spirit so if Moses experienced
[1:19:45] this change that was so powerful that
[1:19:48] his face
[1:19:49] shined but that Glory faded over time
[1:19:53] Paul is saying here that that's not
[1:19:55] anything compared to what you have
[1:19:59] because that same Glory that was up on
[1:20:01] the mountain in the in the burning bush
[1:20:05] that same Glory that came down into the
[1:20:08] Tabernacle now at the day of Pentecost
[1:20:11] that same Glory entered into
[1:20:14] you and now you shine forth as Sons and
[1:20:20] Daughters of God to repr
[1:20:23] represent the Jesus represent Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ a
[1:20:28] resurrected crucified and resurrected
[1:20:31] Jesus
[1:20:35] Christ then we can pray as I open my
[1:20:38] bible and I see here Lord it says that
[1:20:41] I'll be
[1:20:43] healed so I'm going to act on your word
[1:20:47] I'm going to believe your word Lord it
[1:20:49] says for me to change my ways in these
[1:20:51] certain ways I'm going to act on your
[1:20:53] word now Lord you act on your
[1:20:56] word because you
[1:21:00] promised at the day of
[1:21:02] Pentecost when they received the Living
[1:21:06] Word of God and the spirit of God would
[1:21:09] no longer fade like it did for
[1:21:12] Moses so much
[1:21:15] so they receed that they went
[1:21:19] out and they started preaching and there
[1:21:21] were people that spoke to different
[1:21:22] languages people were hearing them in
[1:21:24] their own language this is the glory of
[1:21:27] the Lord shining forth after they had
[1:21:29] received the Holy Spirit so much so that
[1:21:32] even the shadow of a disciple going by
[1:21:35] someone who is sick just the shadow
[1:21:38] going over they were healed in the name
[1:21:40] of Jesus Christ that's
[1:21:42] Glory that and it doesn't fade that Holy
[1:21:46] Spirit is as strong today as it ever has
[1:21:50] been the people saw
[1:21:55] this and they were cut in their
[1:21:58] hearts they were they were like Lord
[1:22:03] this is
[1:22:04] amazing if the musicians could
[1:22:08] come Acts chapter
[1:22:21] 2
[1:22:24] Peter is preaching they're doing
[1:22:27] Miracles speaking in tongues they're
[1:22:29] they're preaching the gospel and other
[1:22:31] languages that they didn't
[1:22:35] speak they go to Peter and they say
[1:22:38] this now when they heard this they were
[1:22:41] pricked in their heart they were cut in
[1:22:43] their
[1:22:45] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[1:22:49] rest of the
[1:22:50] Apostles men and Bre what shall we
[1:22:55] do that's where we should be that light
[1:23:00] should shine forth all the
[1:23:04] time glow not a a glow that Fades but
[1:23:08] all the time this gospel should shine
[1:23:11] forth this Holy Spirit should shine
[1:23:13] forth and it's it's not a temporary
[1:23:15] thing this will last us through
[1:23:19] eternity and then people will see
[1:23:23] and they'll say what must we
[1:23:28] do this is this is something that I've
[1:23:31] never been I've never
[1:23:33] been introduced to this Jesus Christ how
[1:23:38] maybe they always thought that he was
[1:23:39] just some some past person that taught
[1:23:41] you to live a good life but no this
[1:23:45] Jesus Christ is
[1:23:47] alive he rose from the dead and he's
[1:23:51] alive not in a man but he is alive in
[1:23:55] men and women of
[1:23:58] God and then people will
[1:24:01] see say I need to do something with my
[1:24:05] life I need to
[1:24:09] change what must we
[1:24:12] do and Peter said unto
[1:24:15] them
[1:24:17] repent go back on your sins change
[1:24:23] don't stay in your
[1:24:26] sins come to this water be a different
[1:24:31] person

[1:24:44] other
[1:24:45] way repent and be baptized every one of
[1:24:51] you

[1:25:02] another place it says come to the water
[1:25:04] that you may be washed your sins may be

[1:25:39] Ghost the same gift that Peter had when
[1:25:42] he preached it the same gift that Peter
[1:25:44] had when he walked by and his shadow
[1:25:46] caused people to be healed the same gift
[1:25:49] that Peter and John had when they came
[1:25:51] to the man at the gate called Beautiful
