[Applause] [Music] it's a meaning of Our Lives for our Lord to have his way in all that we do I'm excited this morning are you excited to be here it feels good to be in the house of the Lord this

the room done upstairs yet but I don't want to waste any more time as far as not having that so let's do that this Friday at six all the youth are welcome um and on Wednesday if the Lord's willing for a Wednesday night service I've been wanting to do this for a while and I see us back there before brother Bobby Wertz leaves I want to have brother Bobby up um in the front and he and I will be up here and I'll be asking him some questions and we'll be talking about some of the testimonies that brother Bobby has about brother Branham and about some of the special things that you may have heard on tape and now we'll have the real deal right in front of us so we're looking forward to that the Lord Terry's and um it's his will we'll do that on Wednesday night and then I want to remind everyone that Elizabeth sister Elizabeth Guerra has a notepad that's in the fellowship hall right as as you leave and you exit the building please put your information there your contact information and

we got that done this week on tucsontabernacle.com and I want to remind everyone that the first Sunday of March we are going to have our communion so please start preparing for that now start praying about that and that'll be the first evening of March so about a month from now excited about this young man right here but Eli Castillo is somebody that I've been wanting to introduce to the church he's I first heard him I don't know three four five years ago at brother Poe's church and I still remember he took his text out of Jeremiah I believe it was and he talked about that if you are wearied in walking running with the footman how can you run with the horses and he took that text out of that and it really impressed me that the brother had such a deep and solid understanding of this word and he's been on my heart now for a while and I know that our brother is going to be a blessing to all of us so brother Eli if you'd come and take the pulpit God bless you my friend [Music] God bless each and every one of you so good to be here in the house of the Lord so good to fellowship with each and every one of you I know you know we come to the church and we come here fellowship with one another because we have an expectation of the Lord and I surely have an expectation just being here it's an honor to be here I remember when I was a child coming here and just feeling the presence of the Lord here and I first I want to thank our brother Daniel Evans for allowing me to be here and just giving me the having the confidence in me to just come and Minister the word it's always been a pleasure to just be around our brother and I can you know see wisdom in him and all and also our brother Aaron Guerra I remember in some ministerial meetings you know what we've met we fellowshipped and it's always just been a blessing to to be here and I don't know if I see brother Arnie but just allowing us to be you feel welcomed thank you brother Arnie wherever you are it was we felt we felt at home coming here last night and just just feeling it welcome amen so um I just first want to thank each and every one of you and I want to greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ we're all here for the same reason we want to give God all the honor and Glory and that that's why we're here um so um so I don't take all of your times if you would like to turn with me to uh let's see to Psalms we'll go to Psalms 42 7. and uh this is this is a scripture that our Prophet used many times and he spoke on this scripture a lot it goes Psalms 42 7 it says deep calls or calleth to the Deep at the noise of your water spouts all your waves and Billows are gone over me let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we we just read your sacred and holy Eternal Word father we know Lord that your word never changes your word is constant father and Lord It's because of your word we're here Lord Jesus it's because of your word we have we are waiting for a Rapture father we are waiting for a body change because of your word and your Prophet that it came and revealed that word to us Lord Jesus Lord I ask that as as we speak father that you just have the preeminence in this place father Lord that you take my thoughts you take my mistakes aside father and you allow each and every open heart to receive your Eternal Word father God that we may grow in as the body of Christ we thank you Jesus we want to give you the honor and the glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen God bless you you may be seated I'm going to be reading another scripture but um you know I I remember this scripture the Deep calleth to the deep and and as a child when I first saw the the video of brother Brandon preaching this message it was such a blessing to actually see our Prophet you know I heard so many tapes and I heard so many scriptures and and as I was a child I would go to sleep with the tape on and and um but to see the prophet preach this message the Deep calleth to the Deep which in reality is a very simple message it's a very simple message how brother Branham brought it out he said if there's a deep calling there is a deep to respond to that calling and um it was just such a blessing that we're able to hear a prophet preach that beautiful message in First John 3 2 it says beloved now are we the sons of God now we are the sons of God and it doeth not appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is so for me I I attached myself to that scripture and I realized down throughout the whole ages there was a deep calling to a deep and brother Branham he would say how how a little child he would eat the bicycle petals and he said because there was something calling in his body for something and and um God throughout the whole ages has been calling calling the people calling and throughout the years and throughout the ages people have been responding to that call there has been a call to the Bride of Jesus Christ but there was a response from the bride saying yes Lord here we are here we are here we are and and as simple as the prophet brought it to us it's such a profound thought that God from heaven we just heard that song down from his glory he came down from his glory he came down from eternity so that Earth and Eternity can touch ground and touch places so that we can know that we are not from this place and um so I wanted to take that little thought of deep calleth to the deep and thinking about throughout the seven Church ages that there was a deep calling to a deep there was prophets there was Apostles there was people Messengers calling out saying God is here God is preparing a bride God and they they cried out to the people and throughout the ages we've seen that deep calling to the Deep but today you think about it there's not another age left we're not waiting for another messenger we're not waiting for another age we're not waiting for another time we're waiting for those two deeps to meet that's what we're waiting for throughout our years we've been listening to deep call it to the deep but it's at that moment where those two deeps finally meet we've been responding to the Lord but now it's time to meet that other deep meet that desire that we've had the desire of of not wanting to live in the world brother brother Arnie if um you know I'm sorry if I say too much but he was talking to me about a person that was crying out he was crying because the life he was living he was living a a bad life and he was crying to brother Arnie because something inside of him he's crying out for something and and I could see we all had that cry that deep Lord Save Me Lord Lord take this habit From Me Lord Lord make me more like you father Lord make me a better Christian and these these might seem very simple things that are going on in our lives Lord make me a better Christian Lord make me make me to walk in in your way father take this habit off of me but but not knowing that that the Bible says and brother Branham declares that we were in the thinking of God that we were part of God that we were a piece of him so it's just not God saved me but Lord we're trying to go back to God and and that is the cry that we have and I thought of that child um brother Branham sometimes called him a baby but he and he would call him a child but this little child that began to eat bicycle petals and he would eat erasers and how the parents thought it was very very strange the way he was acting now remember when there's a deep calling to a deep we begin to act strange you know if you're in the world you begin to act strange you know if if you're still out doing what you're doing maybe nobody knows but yet it's hard to stay away from that word it's hard to stop talking about church stop talking about the Lord and people say man I'm not trying to have a good time why are you still talking to me about the Lord here there's a deep calling to a deep we we feel like we're still insufficient and we say Lord I still need more of you maybe somebody else might say man that that sister she she's an example to us that brother that brother he's such an example but to that brother might say I'm still insufficient you know Paul that's what he said he said I'm still reaching I'm leaving those things behind and I'm still reaching for things Beyond me now you're talking about the Apostle the prophet of the age yet he was still reaching out why there was something calling out and for this child he was his body was calling out for something and it made me think of of Genesis 3 19 how it said dust Thou Art and dust you shall return we were all made of dust we were all made of these these uh brother Branham City 16 elements I looked it up and they said we are made up 99 of our body is made up of six elements and then the rest is is is different things like sulfur and everything like that but we are made up of six elements of sulfur carbon or not not sulfur carbon hydrogen uh I don't know it's six of them I I've got it here but I won't bore you with it this is not a science class here but six elements that are in us that we are made up of oxygen all of these things we are made up of the ground so we are made up of the dust and one of these days this body has to return to that dust one of these days so our body begins to cry out to the dust our body is um once more of the dust and that's why that child began to eat that bicycle pedal because he was deficient of sulfur he needed sulfur so he began to eat the bicycle pedal and people said man that's a very strange kid eating bicycle petals something's wrong with him eating he races off pencils but they didn't know there was a deep call in his body and he didn't even know and that's why I'm saying sometimes you feel like man for some reason I need to go to church sometimes I feel like I need to sing a special for the Lord and I don't know why I need to do something for the Lord and you think it's simple and you think it's it's on the outward but you don't know that there's a deficient there's a deficiency inside of you asking for a part of God asking for something deeper but in our life we're just we're just chewing on the bicycle pedal we're just saying wait I need to go to church not knowing that you were from God and you're trying to go back to God but when we go to church we're chewing on that eraser where we begin to testify at work and people say man this guy is acting crazy man this this lady why is she dressed that way why there's a deep calling to a deep there's something going on and that boy's body was calling for sulfur because he was deficient in him brother Branham says in um in hearing recognizing and acting is it okay if I read some quotes amen um like the little boy that I always speak of eating erasers off pencils and The Petal off the bicycle he needed sulfur and as long as there was something to Crave for sulfur there had to be sulfur some were first made there had to be sulfur before he had the Crave and it the sulfur projected him and he went back to the sulfur see the dust is calling for the Dust you know brother Branham says we were born with the cocoa burn nature sin is connected to sin we we can't help when we're born in this world we're born in sin we're shaped in iniquity so when we come we come already fallen we already come with the body Desiring the Dust you know I thought about it in the beginning brother how God he he cursed the serpent he cursed the woman and I'm like man Adam he he got he got away he didn't curse at him but I realized God did the most hardest thing when he cursed the ground who was made out of the ground we all are we all are so everything is made up of these six elements there's I believe four essential elements that are made up of the universe those same elements those same that same matter that you have inside you is consisted the same consistency of the star you see out there You're Made Of that Stardust You're Made Of that ground so when God said curse it be the ground the whole world the whole universe went into bondage every element went into sin so when he said curse it be the Dust We are crying out for that curse because we're made of that dust we're made of that curse so it's natural for a young man or a young woman to cry out to the world see brother Branham says you can raise him as best as you can but once that music hits their ears they they're attached to it that we have a cocoa berm nature that that attaches to sin and um you know I never knew it was called a cocober and I looked it up and I'm like oh my goodness those things those things they have little barbs in it you know I you have the goat heads you have other ones but these ones have barbs and you're trying to take it off your pants and and then they get stuck on your finger and you just it's a mess that's what our nature is we we are crying out for sin we're brother Bradham says sin is connected to sin and and these six elements are crying out for the Dust if you're anemic you're crying out for iron if you need magnesium you're crying out for the dust you're crying out for life so so it's strange that the dust has to go back to the Dust though that's the only way we can get uh strengthened is by the dust that we were created from and it's the same thing with the sin we are crying out for the sin these bodies this nature this Fallen nature that we had we're crying out but Brothers we have a seventh element here there's a seventh element if I would like to say it you know it's just my thoughts but we have a peace of God in each and every predestinated seed and brother that's brother Arnie that's why sometimes people cry out even though they're in these bad conditions they're maybe in these drugs maybe they're in these things they're crying out for life I remember when I was going to those things people said man this guy is a lost cause this guy is a lost cause not knowing there was a seed inside of me what what about that woman at the well all the people turned her down all the people said she is a lost cause but brother Branham he said that there was a light there was a seed inside of her a germ of life and all she needed to do was get in contact she was calling there was a deep calling to the Deep she needed something from God and when it she was encountered with the word she came to herself she realized who she was she realized who Jesus Christ was she realized that she wasn't that person she was portraying because she had an element inside of her she had a seed of God in her that was crying out for life what a beautiful thing amen brother Branham he says or or no in in First Corinthians it says 1550 um it says now I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God so so this culcober nature we're part of these six elements brother Branham said these it's made up of 16 elements it's always going to want to cry out for the world our flesh and blood cannot please the Lord it cannot save itself flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God we cannot it has to be something inside of us there has to be a cry for a body change there has to be a cry for something eternal it says that neither doth corruption inherit incorruption so so there's something inside of us a different element that needs to cry out for eternal life not her flesh we can come to church all we want but if there's no cry if there's nothing there then there's nothing to respond all we're doing is is fulfilling a religious fulfillment and that same thing as fulfilling the dust we're going back to the dust there but there has to be a deep calling to a deep there has to be a connection you have to hear the voice and you cry back out that at that voice and then it goes beyond Church even though your heart is saying I need to go to church there's it's that's what you're doing you're eating the bicycle pedal but there's something deeper then church becomes more then when when the brother comes up to preach you're seeking for life you're not looking at the brother anymore you're looking at God and you're saying Lord I need a piece of you today Lord I I need more of you I need more of this element of Jesus Christ I need more of your spirit and we cry out to that brother Branham says he said now notice we cannot deny or that word cannot deny itself then it is satisfied or it's the desire of the um or it's the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire it in the first place because down in your soul was a predestinated seed which was eternal and always was laying there always was laying in there and all the father has given me will come to me there isn't any of them that are going to be lost this isn't thinking man's filter so there's oh there's always been a seed in you there's always been something inside of you well brother I don't feel like I have the Holy Ghost that has nothing to do with it if you have a seat in you a part of God you're bound for the Holy Ghost you're bound for eternal life because there's something crying out don't look at your cocoa Burr condition don't look at that just look at the promises look at what God has ordained for us said brother Branham he would say that that seed has everything inside of it it has the transforming power inside of that sea already and he took us all the way to the beginning how it said every seed it already had every tree inside of that seed every fruit that you're going to see in that tree was inside of that seed everything you need for the journey your healing your salvation your deliverance your family everything is inside of that seed and all we're doing is now crying out crying out for Life projecting ourselves to eternal life so that that seed can manifest so there's that deep calling to the Deep brother Branham he also says in God who's in rich in Mercy he said for when God had you in his thinking in the beginning you have to be some part um you have you have to be some part of you your life that is in you had to be with God there before so that is the connection well he says well when he before even become material on Earth before there was anything but God you were there in one of his attributes he knows you he knowed your name what would it be he knowed what color of hair you would have he knowed all about you so what is that deep calling for the Deep it's God calling from eternity is God calling you back to himself and every time we answer that deep gets closer that's the thing see we've heard many times the Deep calleth to the Deep the Deep callers to the deep but this is the day the day that we're living when those two deeps meet that we are living in such a a day that we're so privileged because nobody else in all these Ages were able to connect to that other deep and and one of these days You're Gonna come to yourself what did it say now we are the sons of God but one of these days it doesn't appear yet what we shall be but one of these days we shall see him and we will be just like him isn't that strange when we see him we'll be just like him that's such a strange scripture to me but it's so real so the the more I see him the more I become him what who is he now he's God in print form every time I open my bible every time I I feed myself with these elements these the nutrition of the word I might the body of Christ or Christ in me is formed more and more and more and more and more and more until one of these days I step into that body and we will be scared like John was in Revelations but we will be just like him and when we see him we will be afraid we will be part of that bride we will be just like him it's that deep calling to the Deep the mate calling for her mate saying Lord I need you more so it puts our body into subjection when we hear the word when we begin to cry what did it say that that the sulfur projected that little boy it projected him back to the sulfur and and that deficiency in us because brother Bradham said that we bypassed our theophany so we're calling for something we were born with the deficiency of God we were born with something that that first brother Brandon said God put a thirst in each and every person so we cry out and you see these people at the in the bars you see these people committing adultery you see all these sins in the world and people say oh what a shame what is it it's a thirst that they're trying to fulfill when you see people drink it's a Godly thirst that they're trying to fulfill but but there's a people that are going to get in contact with that word that's what brother Branham was here for that was that's what happened whenever God revealed the word to us it projected us to him it changed us from from justification sanctification from Luther Wesley Pentecost into this day it projected us because why because the word was revealed more Jesus revealed himself a little more it actually said he the seventh angel was going to reveal all the Mysteries so what does that mean brother Brown said in in the unveiling of God he was God in full View did he say that he's in full View today now I'm jumping myself but but when Moses when Moses was there in Mount Sinai he said Lord let me see your glory glory means his Splendor His image he said let me see you and at that same time God was going to reveal the word at that time what was it the Ten Commandments so he said Lord let me see your word let me see your glory he said okay but you're not going to be able to see all of it because nobody has seen me and lived you cannot see me and live so you're only going to see part of my glory and whenever he began to see him he began to worship and when he went down he then went down with the word and when he walked he said oh praise God for that Glory people began to say Moses Moses Veil yourself why because the very Glory that he beheld became him that same Glory that he saw it jumped on him and he became that very same Glory no wonder the Bible says when we see him we shall be like him why because when we see that Glory when we see that word we're carrying that word today that revealed word when everybody is carousing and everybody's down in the mountain building idols and and all these things we're here with the word looking at that Glory and as we look at that Glory you become That Glory so the more you feed on the word the more you feed on on this revelation of the word the more you become what is it a deep calling to the Deep Lord give me more of your vitamins Lord I don't want to be deficient and then you try to be healed trying to be safe not knowing you're stepping into your theophany every time brother Branham says every time we feed on the word we're forming that other body I don't know what that means but that's what's happening I can't explain it but it's happening what a beautiful thing amen amen he says now brother Branham says in the Great Commission 1958 he says you know David said when the Deep calls to the Deep the Deep begin to call to the deep and I heard that old uh bull elk bugle the storm separated them there was a separation between us and God the storm separated them through the mass of the blowing the timber falling and the herd got broke up and there was a bugling to one another to come back to one another remember when brother bran would give that testimony and and he said I acted like a crazy person he said if anybody would have saw me they would have thought I was a crazy person he was jumping her jumping around running around the tree praising the Lord and every once in a while when he would rest God would reveal something else the the rainbow he would reveal the the howling from one mate to another and then he would hear the bull owl calling to its mate what a beautiful thing I thought to myself I said Lord eventually they got together and how how did they get together by the call so every time the male act said come come with me come back together she would say okay I gotta go this way I gotta turn over here I gotta Stop This I Gotta stop this habit I gotta do this I gotta do that and she began to maneuver her her way around the timber the Fallen Timber the winds everything every time she'd hear that bugle she would get a little closer every time she would hear the voice or the word of her mate she'd get a little closer she'd get a little closer and eventually there was a day when those two mates they finally met again where are we at today what day are we living how close are we where the word is so close to us God says come up hither I gotta get a little closer I'm a little closer I hear him he's closer my life is improving I'm changing I used to do this now it just fell off of me I didn't have to try I didn't have to be this I didn't have to do anything it just fell off of me why you're getting closer and closer to your mate brother Branham he says he says the mate of the wolf calling let's come back together the eye was calling to the rainbow let's come back together he says the spirit calling to the church let's come back together let's unite God was there he says what a beautiful thing and just like I said that sulfur projected that child it projected him to do something he didn't know he he's he doesn't know about science he doesn't know what his deficiency is all he knew was to start gnawing on a pedal and maybe it starts acting strange maybe you start acting strange in your work maybe something starts happening in your life maybe you become irritable and you don't know what are you doing you're gnawing on the pedal Lord I don't know what's going on I need more of you I'm not comfortable in my own skin anymore what are we doing we're acting strange people say well I don't know what's going on but it took a physician it took a physician to say That boy is not strange that boy there's nothing wrong with him he's crying out for sulfur he's crying out for something that's deeper than that pedal deeper than just coming to church deeper than than stop acting and stop cussing the way you do deeper than dropping your habits there's something deeper it's just projecting you to do those things it's God calling back to God why because we were a piece of him we were a part of him and he's calling back to himself he divided himself in the beginning that's how True Fellowship is God dividing himself one person divides himself he that's that's been his his uh agenda this whole time God said I'm lonely he didn't get somebody some other entity he pulled out of himself and he said let us make man in my image in our image and then when he said man Adam looks a little lonely he didn't say let me make another piece of dirt he said no out of him what was it a dividing of himself to create a Unity and then whenever in the in the day of Pentecost what did God do he divided the pillar of fire and created the greatest Unity ever built I could be in Phoenix you guys can be here and somehow brother we are united why because by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and I am your brother you are my sister you are my brother we are united together in one Spirit God dividing himself and bringing back himself I remember brother Brown says I love my wife so much I just wander inside me wow well he was that's Revelation there why because that's where she came out of that's where Eve came out of she came out of Adam and in order for them to have proper Unity she had to come out of him because she was he was she was in him yet he was alone he was there packing her everywhere and when God gave him the the uh commission said multiply replenish the Earth have dominion he was talking to him and her because they were all in one but in order to fulfill that unity in order to fulfill that they had to divide God had to divide and separate himself so that he can bring us back together what up man God is something else this goes beyond church this goes beyond me me wearing suits this goes my relationship with the Lord is more is more greater than anything more greater than anything is when you find out that God is calling you personally the Deep call it to the Deep why are you acting this way because God is calling you personally what a beautiful thing amen amen he said how much there's something and he says this in the things that are to be and that message things that are to be man it is something else because there he he talks about how we were with him in the beginning it's strange because his message is things that are to be but he goes back to the beginning he says if you want to see what's going to happen over there you got to see what happened over here in order to know where we're going back to he says there's something in US calls us to live and there's something in us to do right and God will call somebody on the platform of their pulpit and will preach the absolute truth why see it shows you then if you are a real child of God you begin to cry out God take this away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me why it's needed that boy needed sulfur it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to when he's gone to prepare gone on to prepare you've got to be a real word bride of Christ that cry is a need of life it's a need well God take this this thing away from me and you're not knowing that that it's needed for your heavenly home it's needed for your theophany it's needed to go back to God Amen amen so you begin to do strange things you know every time we progress as Christians something begins to happen in heaven that's that's just the way it's always been heaven and earth begin to cry out to one another there's a deep calling to the deep and in the whole Bible there's God's revelation of his word that cry would come out in every age and Noah's time in Abraham's time in Jacobs and Isaacs in everybody's time God would reveal himself in one way or another or if I could say in a certain form he would reveal himself right he revealed to Moses as the pillar of Fire as as the fire on Mount Sinai in the in the burning bush also he revealed himself to Abraham as Melchizedek he revealed himself to Joshua as the captain of the lord of the host he revealed himself in a certain way he shows himself to people and every time he would go and he would show his glory or he would reveal his word to them it would project them and it would take them from the their condition to another condition every time God would reveal himself to them it would change him from one place to another and that's God's agenda every time God has to reveal himself God has to show himself in order so that we can be tooken out of the condition that we that we are in and and if you notice that that in the seven Church ages that's what God did and those last three ages that's when the birth of Jesus Christ begin to happen with Luther's age it was justification water right then it was blood with sanctification then it was the Holy Ghost and every time that word was revealed it changed them from this this um time of Catholicism and nickelodeonism and all of this stuff where it changed them and showed no you are justified by faith and IT project a people a bride in that little age to be justified and it projected them to be justified because that's what God revealed just a little portion of his glory then in in sanctification he revealed more he said no you know what there's more to this you have to be Sanctified you just just not justified but now you have to be clean so what happened in that justified State God revealed his word a little bit more and said you need a little bit more and what did it do it changed the people that were ready to receive it and it changed them into that Sanctified state and whenever that time of Pentecost came God says I'm going to reveal myself a little more and it projected them to Pentecost to the Holy Ghost and it continues and continues until this day this day God isn't going to reveal himself in portion but it's the mystery of all things it says so where are we supposed to be at where is the Christian supposed to be at then we're stepping into that body change it has to because there's not another message there's not another word anymore God has to show himself in full view in full Glory so that whenever we see that Glory we become That Glory and we'll become just like Jesus Christ amen I don't want to hold you guys too long but um IT projects us so when Heaven and Earth they begin to cry out that's why the Bible says whenever a person is saved what does it what happens Heavens begin to throw a party what was it it was a deep calling to the Deep you you don't know but you're in your bedside or you're in the couch and you said Lord I'm tired of my life you don't know that all of eternity all of angels saying praise the Lord Little John he already finally came up he was before the foundation of the world and finally the light has touched him finally he's coming back to us coming back to Eternity imagine that whenever you give your heart to the Lord Brother Branham says when people begin to have face to face with God he comes to himself he realizes who he is praise God amen um brother Branham also says which is a very man I cannot wrap my head around it and I wouldn't never try but he says that when we recognize the very word this is on who is this Melchizedek he said after you recognize the very word was Eagle food then you've left the other thing you have been formed what is going on you're being formed when you eat that word you're formed into that Living Image he says of the Living God you heard from your theophany wow what an amazing thing that that something to me don't be discouraged by getting yourself into this word there's so much there's so much more there's so much more in this word than we ever know I'm telling you I haven't even scratched the surface there's so much in there in this word and the more word you get the you begins to form you into what that Living Image why just like as a as a mother whenever she's uh about to have a child what happens she begins to eat the uh things that she needs in order to form the baby she eats things maybe um things that have more iron things that have more magnesium things that have more potassium whatever it is she begins to feed herself what is she doing she's forming that child Out of the Dust of the ground all of the elements that are of the ground she begins to feed herself of I've even heard stories of women eating clay because they needed that for that baby so so they begin to eat these strange things and people might say wow that is eating ice cream or ketchup or whatever it might be but they begin to eat certain things why because the baby needs it and every time she she feeds herself that baby begins to be formed in her belly every time we feed on that word every time you feed on that revealed word of God that Christ in you begins to be formed and you're formed forming him and forming and informing until you see him and you become just like him what a beautiful thing amen amen Heaven and Earth will will meet let us stand to our feet I I have so much more but I feel that this is okay um you know the whole earth is groaning it says for the manifestations of the sons of God so so nature because remember God cursed the ground so and we are linked to the ground and we have that element that is linked to God so the Earth is looking at you the the creature the trees everything is looking at you because you are that link to Eternity and they say when they change we know will change too we'll know everything will be all right when we see the sons of God be manifest so we have we have it says we are compassed about a cloud of witnesses we are compassed about and that's that always was strange to me because sometimes we do what we're supposed to do we do what we have to do in our daily lives father he goes to work he does what he has to do he puts in his eight hours his 12 hours whatever it is he does over time just so that he can help then he comes to church maybe he picks up the offering he goes back to his life mother she takes care of the children and she does the laundry she she cooks she does what she has to do and they do the best they can I know we do the best we can and sometimes we ask ourselves Lord is this enough my little portion my little my little thing that I'm doing here in church maybe nobody cares maybe they do but maybe we feel like nobody cares Lord I'm just I'm just hearing I'm a nobody father and I'm just here to fulfill my little portion and sometimes maybe it feels like like nobody cares you know in Hebrews I believe it was Hebrews 10 or was it was the Hall of Faith right it's said by faith Abraham did this by faith Gideon Barack all of these people they did these things by faith but it said that that they were what did it say you know what I'm going to go to it real quick if you don't mind it was chapter 11 right brother okay [Music] in the end of the chapter this is what it says all these having obtained a good report through faith received what not the promise having provided some better thing for us that without us they without um they without us should not be made perfect my little insignificant insignificant job my little work my little thing that I'm doing for the Lord they're not made perfect without me then in chapter 12 it starts off strange because it starts with a therefore or aware for now we don't start sentences that way so we know that there's a continuation of the last chapter so it said that they without us are not made perfect therefore seeing that we are also compassed about a cloud of witnesses when you feel like you're alone folding those those clothes when you feel like Lord am I in my post of Duty am I doing this Lord does this matter there's people in the edge of Heaven saying we will not be paid perfect if you don't do what you do you're compassed about a cloud of witnesses saying come on get up keep going son keep going daughter Abraham Isaac Jacob David Solomon all of them are in the edge of Heaven saying we will not be made perfect without you think about it all of the Heaven and Earth are in anticipation of what you're going to do what is it a deep calling to a deep there's groanings in the world there's earthquakes there's things going on crying out for your manifestation calling for you to become what you're always meant to be let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I ask that you just touch our our precious people here father Lord I know father that you have something great for each and every one of them I know it Lord God and I ask that you just touch them in a mighty way father that whatever thirst whatever cry that they may understand that it is you that called him first that no man seek after God but you're the one seeking so if they have a desire to have more to be more to to have more of your spirit it's because you have more to give touch them in a mighty way Lord touch this church bless it father with your Holy Ghost father Lord whatever you have in store Lord be there in their midst whatever meetings father whatever things whoever is praying for this place whoever is praying for somebody out there in the world that is in sickness Lord be with him father every place every person Lord that you may touch them in a mighty way show them that you are here father Lord we trust in you we give you the glory father the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen God bless you God be with you amen [Music] their desire is there a deep calling to the deep in your heart there is a promise that if there is a deep that is calling as our brother said then there is a deep to respond amen this word says that the entire creation is groaning for the manifestations of the sons of God as our brother said that all heavens and all Earth is groaning to see this word manifested in our lives and we get to stand at the very end of time and the Lord has chosen us I believe to be here when it's all wrapped up [Music] friends what our brother has said this morning is so important don't overlook that deep calling to the Deep Whenever there is a desire in your heart that there is something to meet that desire and the enemy tries he tries to impersonate it but but God is there God bless you all friends don't take what our brother said this morning lightly it is so important always think about God don't ever forget that those Cravings that we have that they're for God he's up there and he's calling to us God bless you all take the day and think about our lord Jesus and come back tonight and be again ready to hear the word I'll be preaching tonight friends back to what brother Eli said it was so important there is a deep calling to the Deep thank God that we've recognized it amen we thank God that he brought us here this morning God bless you all brother [Music] brother Aaron just told me that brother that I know I didn't know him very well but it's I don't know if you all know brother Gideon retief from South Africa he just passed away in a car accident you said his wife's in the hospital so let's bow our heads Lord God [Music] we never know the day that our turn would be to leave from this Earth we don't know the time we don't know when these things would happen but our friend the servant of the Lord went to be you with you today went on to his reward but Lord there's are others that are left and we pray for them that you would give them strength in this time his family and his friends and the congregation in South Africa bless them Lord we pray and give them strength in Jesus name amen [Music] oh more of you yes more of you I've had it all but what I need is [Music] [Music] foreign can you put those words up brother Jordan there's a song where there's a deep deep calling do you know that song where there's a deep deep calling there's a deep deep to respond where there's a hope for a city there's a land beyond the Sun where there's a yearning burning to leave this world behind there is a king returning coming to take us home you have that desire is because there's something there to fulfill that desire so here's my cup Lord I lift it up or maybe you could just say I just I just give it give it to you here's my cupboard [Music] and this thirsting of my soul [Music] [Music] here's my cup fill it up and make me I was sick for things that could not satisfy [Music] I heard my savior's speaking draw from my world [Music] but never shall run fill feel like [Music] come and quench this thirsting of my soul Bread of Heaven [Music] [Applause] here's my cup fell out and make me old there are millions in this world who are crazy the pleasures but none can match the wondrous

my cup fill it up and make me home here's my cup fill it up and make me whole there's only one way to be whole and that's to be back together with him that's whole that's complete that's finished and and brother Branham said the desire that he has for that is greater than the desire that and I never looked at it those Witnesses looking at us that way saying come on we're not complete till you get here so that desire that magnet that pull just yield to and say Here I Am Lord Lord we thank you today in a simple way Lord yet such a depth to it a young man that would give his heart and surrender himself and yield and say Lord something that would encourage our hearts Lord and I'll ask the Lord just a blessing for brother Eli and his family Lord you could hear the cry in his heart reaching up for that Lord fulfilled that drawn eye Lord you said draw an eye unto me and I will draw an eye unto you Lord let that be today Lord we we fill it with so many other things and then we wonder why sometimes why is this why am I demonstrating why is this coming out in my life Lord that what you put in is going to come out Lord let us just let us get more of you and less of the world Lord is our prayer today Lord those Witnesses are depending on us more but you've already seen us on the other side you said not a single one would be lost we're written in the palms of your hands or we're part
