more time all his grace [Music] and what joy fills my soul just to know [Music] how many knows that that it's more than enough more than enough it's sometimes you know he might look at me and the soup bowl looks about empty but you have confidence in him and and god meets our our every need so we appreciate that let's just bow our heads lord we thank you this evening we've been recipients receivers of that grace of god and grace is nothing you merit it's nothing you earned but it's something that is freely given and lord from before the foundation of the world you have seen this day it's nothing is is by chance in you lord but everything is prepared grace within you those those that part of you that had never been expressed lord you were the self-existing one but lord there was one that wanted to manifest himself and you had made provision for that today lord we're the recipients we're the receiver of that grace of god of that mercy of the lord and we just want to say thank you lord tell you that we love you for it lord and we appreciate it lord for where would be would we be without it today lord we want to speak your word today we want to hear your word we want your presence lord to just dwell in us lord and you have your way lord as we yield ourselves and surrender to you in jesus christ amen amen i'm glad of his grace and his mercy while you're standing let's read one scripture thank you musicians in first corinthians chapter 8 verse 6 and i'm praying that the lord will get my thoughts organized here because sometimes you come up with a hundred things you're not too sure which where to go but first corinthians 8 6 but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him so amen god bless you may be seated i uh i've been something that started maybe eight ten years ago when i began to first minister and brother green had spoke to me and shared with me his burden how he felt and and asked me if i if i would want to minister if i had the desire and i said well you know just we've been looking at it and so we did minister and then but something had been in my heart for a long time and had mentioned it to brother green i said i would like to get into that that message things that are to be and maybe speak on that and he said brother aaron that would be wonderful well it didn't happen for 10 years and lord knows why and and so a couple weeks ago was just studying through the rapture message and the following message is things that are to be and i said lord maybe it's time now but i don't know there's so much in there where do you start you know but i just i've asked the lord that maybe we could go in that direction and show as i was preparing this would have been monday evening had listened to what brother matt had spoken sunday morning and speaking of of a being in a place not so much the physical location of eden but the atmosphere of eden and i had god questioned did brother matt say that eden didn't exist that it was no that's not what he was saying there is a place the scripture gives us the boundaries in the place of it but he's talking what made eden was the presence of god what was going on there you know and so i thought lord well then that just ties right into what i and then brother lyle speaking on sunday night and i'm going to share something with you speaking with brother matt yesterday and and he goes man brother lyle has a scientific mind i said yes you should hear him and brother mike yarbrough together so brother mike and brother lyle were standing out here one day in the in the fellowship hall and i was listening to them but not understanding a whole lot so i walked up to them and i don't think they were expecting this at all and i said you know you two brothers i could not recommend your brains to anybody and that stopped them quite quickly i said but mine mine would sell for a very valuable price and they're both especially brother mike gave me a really good look he said i don't understand what you're trying to tell us i said look at yours millions and millions of miles used they've been used up and down back and forth mine is like brand new hardly even touched brother mike says go on get out of here but to god gives to each one in each life and the things that god has for a reason for a purpose and in speaking with brother matt and and i know he's listening because he sent me a text i'm praying for you brother aaron and i said he said i listen to brother lyle sunday evening he goes and that was amazing so i listened to it again on youtube on monday and he goes and he was it was even more amazing but he did say something and i think i think brother lyle would agree with this we're not trying to prove god by science not at all because i know what brother lyle spoke to me with me before but isn't it amazing that god leaves evidences everywhere of his work because he he does these things so and and the quote that caught my attention and and and i'm going to go ahead and read that one first brother jeremy even though it was the last one that i give you from things that are to be and and this was one of the as i was studying this is one of the last places i got to and it really stood out to me how how it fitted to you in this life as you grew everything fitted right in because you were made for that he says wasn't it a strange thing the night that you staggered into the mission the tent meeting or the little church somewhere on the corner and something the preacher preached on a certain subject and you just fell right at the altar see see god knew that before the foundation of the world see it seems strange to you why you did it then but now you understand you knew what happened it's so fitting that to you in in this life and it will also be also in the life that is to come and he says the world and its life seems to to advance as you mature everything seems to go right with you sometimes you wonder if it is but god has it all if if you had planned your own life people said i think this is going to be right this is going to be right who knows where you would have ended up but because god laid it out everything is right for you he says he says i don't believe that that a person just happened to be here by chance now just think when you come to the world everything had to be for prepared for you or pre-prepared rather for you then he said this is what caught me i don't hardly understand that how that we could think that a god that could prepare all these good things for us would not or we could not put trust in him that if he brought us in this chaos that we're in now and prepared the good things of life for us here how much more can we trust him to prepare the things that is to come see the eternal things and that's that's the statement at as far as i had been reading and studying that really caught my attention if he's brought us this far and he's prepared it all and he's never missed then how much more that because that was his intention it wasn't the life on this earth but to be restored back to the garden of eden that that atmosphere that he created there so and i just appreciate it then we'll go ahead back go to the first one there brother jeremy he says from to whom would we go he said when it's going to be i don't know but it may be before morning it may be in the next hour it may be in the next five minutes whatever it is it's near at hand there's nothing else to happen but the coming of the lord jesus the church is rallying itself getting itself together shaking itself did you ever see such a stirring amongst the people sure something's fixing to happen the coming of the lord the whole earth is waiting for the manifestations the manifestations of the sons of god the nature out yonder which man has given dominion so you and i have a part you and i have a place something to do is we're not we're not puppets on a string that god is manipulating you say well if he pre-planned it he must be work no he knows the end from the beginning he's laid it out but you and i have a place and a part to do here and and when you see see a fallen earth a decaying earth you should understand it's waiting on me it's waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god to come back to that place that we were at let's go to the next quote here adoption i think it is when when was our names put in the lamb's book of life when the lamb was slain from before the foundation of the world when god was jehovah el ella elohim the self-existent one just like one great big diamond and he could not be nothing else but inside of this diamond his attributes was a savior in his attributes on the inside of him was a healer well there was nothing to save and nothing to heal but his attributes produced it so then before the foundation of the world when he knowed that the great display in here of him that he would be a savior that he would come and be made flesh and dwelt amongst us and when he knowed by his stripes we would be healed he slayed the lamb on his book before the foundation of the world and wrote your name on the book before the foundation of the world so you might go against it but he already seen you there and sometimes they just say i surrender lord and and i i had a testimony my sister-in-law is here elizabeth i almost referred to her as misty because that's how we know her but you know we had put in a prayer request um for her because of a job change and she was wondering now do i what do i do and what do i go and she said it was just it was nervous and and things going and she was asking the lord what did i do and she heard a voice speak to her and just said this world is not your home does god still speak that way he still he can he can give you a sign he can give but he can also speak to you if you listen to him if you'll be willing to to listen sometimes we get busy we get going we get we get doing a lot of things but sometimes in that quiet time if you'll stop and say lord speak to me and make yourself she said the peace that came with it settled everything when he says this is not your place this is not your home but while you're here something's going to happen something's going to take place so he said and then let's go on to the last one i believe we had one more quote there nothing existed before him he was the the all the existence that there ever was i can't imagine that because all we've ever known is this world but before that he was the only thing that existed okay one el elohim beanzee all sufficient all-powerful almighty self-existence one oh but in genesis 2 when he made man he said i am j u y-a-h-u-j-u-v u h j v h u jehovah what did it mean i am the all existence one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or amateur little one of mine and he says glory why he gave man jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur god because he is father god and he made a man an amateur god so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family allah elohim now now he is jehovah jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family god now god made man to be predominant over all the earth he had dominion and the earth was man's dominion is that scripture then if that's his domain he was god over the earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so oh there he is god jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him there you are how many says i am amen there i am i'm so glad i'm part of that family so so as we were looking into some of these things and and um i was getting ready monday evening and and uh to start taking these thoughts and trying to put them on paper and and get them and someone had forwarded a a video to my wife and she forwarded it to me and it was about a quarter to seven and i just opened it up to look at it see what it was and i began to watch it and listen to this man as he was explaining some things and my wife came in she sat down and she goes isn't it just amazing i go yeah but i need to turn it off because i need to study so an hour later when it finished i was like wow this just put a lot of things in a different perspective so i want to share a little bit of that with you and and i know that we're not going to get very far along and things that are to be but just kind of laying a base and when realized that god has had it all in in his hands under control has never gotten out of control i heard today or i read today that california has said um no more gatherings allowed in churches interior being inside i guess that meant they could gather outside but no more than i thought in a time when people should be on their knees seeking god they're telling them no now go to church when it should be the other one we should be on our faith seeking the lord jesus and it's turned around but brother brahm talks about he's the god of this evil age he has served the authority he it was stripped from man you know but at the same time go back and look at job when he wanted to tempt job you know who he had to get permission from from your father he had to go is it okay and god said yes because i have confidence in my son so i want to share a few things with you and brother lyle in no way am i taking anything that you said in trying to make myself anywhere near that because i had to call brother peter up and ask him if i was understanding some of these things i said i mentioned once i passed science because i sat next to a very intelligent young man who was my neighbor and he helped me out quite a bit so but let's just start with this it's a little humorous but just to think about it a fellow sat under a tree once and pretending to be a master of structural engineering skills he said you know god i don't think you are very smart he says when i think of the way you made this world a huge tree holding little nuts and a small plant holding huge watermelons he says it just doesn't make sense a big tree small nuts a small plant huge watermelons as he waxed eloquent against god's inability to do something reasonably suddenly a little nut fell and hit him on the head and he cried out thank god that wasn't a watermelon tree you know and and they caught this this was a story and this the comment the mad the man made to this it's a simple way to understand why we sometimes educate ourselves to absurdity in man's best in man's wanting to create a place to live where everything is perfect what is he created but god had it all laid out and this this portion was called the first three minutes of the universe and maybe some of you have read this or heard this before but it's first time i saw it and this is taken in the thought of when the universe started and and the man that gives this thing is not talking about a big a big chance he's talking about going back far enough they can see somewhere someplace where this started how precise it had to be how it could have missed so let me just read this to you when you realize how exact to every minute my new details this world had to be not talking about minutes seconds we're talking about micro seconds and this is what i asked brother peter here like 10 to the power of negative 36. so i've heard 10 to the power but i've never heard it referred to the negative side and so i said what does that mean he said brother peter said you take 0 and you go back 35 zeros and then there's that point one that's that's next to nothing he says he says if you change the decimal point of this exactness by even one you would foul up the whole process he says this is how fine-tuned this needed to be the expansion and contraction precision of the universe in the early moments had to be so exact to the micro second category the margin of error so small that it would be like taking aim at a one square inch object at the other end of the universe 20 billion light years away it and hitting it bullseye and then he said oh and it just happened god has his hand in everything he created it he put it together he he he made the laws and formed it at all and it happens that way and speaking with brother brother lyle and we've to talk many times it's because god set these laws up not because man is so smart that he found him but because god set them there and then sometimes man stumbles on to them you know because nobody is walking around saying i know where that is they've worked and worked and worked and worked to get to that place and and so and this one here is a picture a slight picture of nasa shows 100 billion stars if you counted one per second you would be counting for 2500 years so genesis 1 16 says this and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also that simple he made the stars also so our hands our future our all is in this creator's hands the one who has it all under control and there's nothing too big for him nothing too small for him and it remind me of this song and and i i said it to you or i quote the words here how big is god how big and wide his vast domain to try to tell my lips can only start he's big enough to rule this mighty universe yet small enough to live within my heart and i think that he could make himself small enough to become human to walk in flesh to feel pain to hurt so that he could understand and it's just things that like i said i was i was reading and listening to to some of the things this man said and going and i was like good lord it we can't even begin to understand you lord but you never just said understand me you just said accept me and believe me accept what i've done for you you know our sister elizabeth she just asked the lord you know what do i do and he answered it simply he said this world's not your home you've got something ahead of you that's a greater than this so god brings peace and all let's look at luke saint john 1 or saint john 14 1 1-3 this is a scripture that brother branham uses to to to begin this things that are to be let not your heart be troubled to me it's not it's a commandment yet it's a promise it's not a uh you must do this it's god setting just telling you let your heart be in trouble this world is not your home sometimes we we look at a let not or don't do this we look at it as a law but god is just telling don't don't let it trouble you don't let it get it let not your heart be trouble ye believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and did he go so the rest of the scripture and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also something else that happened this week and the brother may be listening i don't know if he does but he's he he had wanted to get ahold of brother matt and and brother matt has told me if somebody wants to talk to brother matt and you know and he comes to me he says go ahead and give him my phone number so i did but brother matt had given me his um work number and i had given this brother his work number which brother matt had no longer used so the brother couldn't get to him so he sent me he said i've been trying to get ahold of brother matt this and this so let me just tell you and he gave me about two pages of where we are as a bride today and he said they're waiting for a rapture but there is no rapture they're waiting for a body change but there is no body change i'm reading this and i'm going well what hope do you have then and he says brother branham raised up in the um with the seven angels that was his rapture so ours and he began and i'm thinking uh he's not a young man he's going through a lot of physical problems right now and say you have no hope for a body change and then he made another comment and he said brother so and so he's been preaching he's just about got it just exactly like i've got it but he's waiting on a body change i'm waiting on a body change i don't want to take this one over there this one did something thought he could do what he could do 30 years ago yesterday my wife we bought some plants she bought 14 plants to put around the yard and and i know what that means it means i'm going to be working so i said well i'll get out there and i'll get started i'll start digging out and i've never been one who can just dig one hole one day in another hole the next day it seems like i've got to do them all so i got home relatively early yesterday about one o'clock in the afternoon so between 1 30 and 2 00 o'clock in the cool of the afternoon i went out and started digging well it was cool somewhere i'm sure and i started digging and um you know had to go down about 16 inches and then go about two feet around and the people that had lived there before they had put tarps underneath to protect keep the weeds from coming out and i started hitting them about this deep so i had her i said call and see if i need to remove that do i got to cut around it or just the hole and they said oh no cut back about two feet around or it's gonna it's gonna inhibit the the moisture getting down to things so turned out to be about a three and a half four hour project in the in the cold summer afternoon um my wife went out there and she kept saying come on in that's enough that's enough i said no i'm almost done i'm almost done i'm almost done and so we worked on it and got it all done about three and a half four hours later i was feeling a little lightheaded a little worn out the joints were all aching the knees didn't want to walk anymore but i kept telling myself you can do it and the smarter one kept saying no you can't come come on inside now so i went inside i'm feeling a little woozy and i checked my blood pressure and it was like 85 over 45. and that's pretty low for me and probably pretty low for everybody and she says i told you to take care of yourself i tell you i'm looking for a body change one other thing that i've done and my boss kind of i i went back to the shop because i thought for sure i left my ladder in the shop and it wasn't there so i left it on a job site somewhere and my boss goes my you lose ladders as fast as i use measuring tapes and i go yeah but measuring tape is a lot less expensive so i think since i've been working i've left three ladders somewhere and somebody's got them i'm waiting for a body change maybe a little selfish you'd say but no this world is not my home i'm just a passing through don't get your route set down so deep that it's hard to get out lord enough i'm ready to go home so he said and i've prepared a place for you and and i appreciate his grace and his mercy for that you know he said in my father's house are many manchester if it were not so i would tell you and i go to prepare a place for you and if i go to prepare for a place for you i will come again and will receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also it's his desire was for you to be with him because he already existed alone he doesn't want to continue existing alone he wants to be with his children with his his bride with his family and if you have representation now something calling something drawing you saying yeah that's me then you want to be there too you know and it's just not so much just to get out of this world sometimes we're praying lord i just want out of here but it's not the right motive brother branham reminds me many times when brother brahms talking about the spirit of a true attitude of a christian is lord is there more that i could take with me abraham is the one that i always go back to when when god came down and and sat down with him and told him what he was going to do down in sodom how many of you if god would brother brother if god would sit down with you this evening and tell you what he's planning to do and and the end of the destruction of the world would tell you well lord let's get it done today so i can go home but something in your heart would say lord is is there a possibility through some grace for some of these other folks the same grace that you had on me the same desire that you had for me could i give it to somebody else and that should be our heart lord as you had mercy on me as you had grace for me as as you met my knees could you meet someone else's could could we share this with someone else and i always think about that abraham saying lord if there was 50 would you destroy i think adam i mean abraham knew there wasn't 50 there i think abraham knew there was just going to be one family left when all this was done but he still was looking to see if there is that possibility lord that my neighbor that my co-worker that my brother my sister would come to this same place that i've gotten to know you same same experiences with you matthew 11 25 and and we don't gloat over this but i'm grateful for this at that time jesus answered and said i thank the o father lord of heaven and earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and the putin but has revealed them unto babes and and you know when i was reading some of this i'm thinking lord you know i'm understanding it because the man that wrote it up wrote it out understandably but if you'd written it all in equations it might as well be another language to someone that has studied that language fine but to me but god says you know what i can make it simple i can make it to your level i can go all the way down to the ground aaron if i have to get down to your level i said thank you lord and i appreciate that you have hidden this from the wise and the prudent but those that would be willing to learn and say lord teach me lord let my heart be sweet and humble with a a learning attitude he says you know and i i seem to miss it be missing one page here maybe i jump past it hold on there sometimes you write the notes down and then here they are so just just talking about attitude and looking at this and like i say this is a long ways around to get to the subject of things that are to be but by looking at what he's done for us today we have a good idea what the other side is going to be he says this was an interesting thing he said a politician was campaigning for the rights of the underprivileged and a young underprivileged man came to see him at his office a politician secretary went to the politician told him that there was a young man at the door who wanted to see him the politician answered since i have begun to fight for his cause i have no more time for i have no time for individuals anymore she said incredible sir even god hasn't reached that stage yet that was really caught my attention you're fighting for more rigid influence but i don't have time for you what i'm doing is too big and her answer was my god hasn't even reached that stage yet he can go down while he's bringing all of this to its climax and he'll go down and call you by name and talk to you and minister to you you know i shared this testimony i was talking a little bit the other day with my dad about it when we down in there in mexico when they had the the service there where the the fellowship meetings there down there at the church where we helped um tabernacle help put it together and the sister was was preoccupied the pastor's wife because she knew a lot of people were coming and and they're they're not people that can come and pay their own hotel expenses and they're poor people if in fact there were the churches um they built they have property they call them a he those would be just little properties given to them and the people are allowed to to build a little home and after x amount of time it becomes your your home why kind of because you live there now and it had light bulbs it had light switches that had everything in the house close by there but no power but the power was right down the street and had been there for seven hours for seven years he the brother told us just hadn't been connected yet you know a poor people in a very similar land that we are some temperature and all a lot of agriculture nobody had bought hay to feed their horses and cows if there was no grazing no rain their cows and their horses died they were poor people mom and dad took some clothes mom traveled with dad on this trip and they took some clothes and stuff down before they they stopped letting you cross and so he got got some information as to where to take it and they told him go up this dirt road back up on the hill up there and um and there's some folks that could really use the help so they drove up there and began to give this family they were they were a christian family and began to give them some things and my mom said it made her cry to see the the stage what these people lived in you know and he said you know got some shoes for the kids and some clothes on it and then the family stopped them and they said okay that's enough for us because the poor people live further up the hill my mom said i was already crying to see how how hard they had and they said no the poor people live up the hill up there i'm glad god looks at us all the same and not based on our stature not based on what we have what we can do but what he's done for us you know just when when this this she told incredible sir even god hasn't reached that stage yet but they're they're in in the place where where the where they were going to have the food at the church and all the sister sister santoshi or brother santos wife she she she came up she said told my dad she said i don't know what to do i don't know how we're going to feed everybody so my dad said let's go to the grocery store and let's buy what you need so they went and they're used to buying two eggs this that's all they can afford two slices of bread enough for the next day that's generally all they could he said no just take everything what you think when these they took it all so they made a big pot of soup that's usually what goes and goes best on and she came up to him several hours crying she said brother we've been serving people from the soup all day and it's still full he's a god that does those type of things he takes care of all of that he can take one into a million as quickly as i can make a million into one he's good yes see he left the 90 and 9. for one he wasn't too busy for that one for sister elizabeth there in the room when he said what do i do now this world is not your home he's not too busy for that and you know it's it's it's a thought here god sees the agony the hurts the the things that each person is going through individually sure you could say he looks at us as tucson tabernacle that's what again but you're an individual to him you know he knows who you are he knows you by name he knows what you have need of he knows and he looks at the the matters of your heart and and you know i might try to understand i i maybe could could have a good word for you but he will never miss he'll diagnose it perfect every single time he says and he answers individually brother green used to say this and those who've been here well i wouldn't remember he said brother branham told me i was to push a wheelbarrow everywhere the rest of my life until jesus came i would do it but it wouldn't ask anybody else to do it sometimes god tells us something then we want everybody to do it just like us but god has individuals god has people playing each one of their parts this one doing this and this one doing that and and it's just sometimes you're not noticed sometimes not your nobody's even aware that you're doing that part until you don't do it and then somebody goes how come this didn't get done just like the body a lot of things happen in your body until something goes wrong you weren't even aware that you had those body parts interior body parts but let them stop working and suddenly these manifestations of problems the doctor says oh this and this is going wrong you go i didn't know i had a this and this but you do but god is aware of every bit of it even your favorite colors even your favorite food even the thing your favorite smells he's aware of it i was thinking about this and i remembered brother simmons brother merritt simmons and sister simmons dad would and and we got to know the brother simmons just at towards the end of his life but they talked about how he loved flowers and how he planted it all and when he passed away there were those same but brother simmons flowers we're not going to have them anymore and brother merritt's the one that shared this with me and he said you know there was a sister and she came up and she had dreamed brother brother simmons on the other side and he had come back and he had said you think those flowers so we're so beautiful here wait till you get on this side god comforts hearts god will go down and speak to your level what you have need of so if if some of the things we've got to experience place we've got to be i just wonder what what's there going to be on the other side so don't miss it that's the best way to know and the man was this man was trying to explain because the young lady or the young daughter had asked his her mother had passed away and she asked dad she said dad why did mom have to die explain try to explain that to a child it's sometimes even as adults you don't understand those things you say why god you know it everything seemed to be so good and then this went this way you know and and he was there and how do you explain it in a child's level so they can understand and as they were following the the um the group of going to the cemetery there was a large truck that get up they got in behind and he pulled up to it and he looked at the truck and he also noticed the shadow on the side as the sun was hitting and he looked to his daughter and he goes honey he says if you were to get run over would you rather get run over by the truck or the shadow of the truck and she stopped and she looked she said by the shadow of the truck it would hurt a whole lot less and he goes well that's exactly god got run over by the truck so that you and i could get run over by the shadow i thought what an explanation david said it this way though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil he took it all for you so you didn't have to i said boy that that made it real to me now he took it all so that i wouldn't have to so he said that so that where i am you may be there also he says because then he said you know he he's he he experienced the very things that we're experiencing he had to in order to understand god as a spirit could not understand the feeling of the flesh the heartaches and the thing but when he took on flesh he could be hurt he he could have a broken heart you know so he says he he experienced these these are my words not something he said i just as he was listening he experienced everything that we're going through by living this life on earth he can say i've been there i've hurt i i've been tired i've been frustrated all of it he says in fact he cried out my god my god why has thou forsaken me so that when you would say i'm feeling alone i'm feeling left out i'm feeling abandoned he would say i know that feeling i shared that with you when i was praying here one day and i just asked the lord do you understand because you can't put god in that level trying to bring him down and say this majestic great god and bring him down to a level of a human i said lord do you understand my heart was hurt uh heavy and burdening do you understand the heaviness and the burden the feeling forsaken at times and his word just rung out to me and he said my god my god why has thou forsaken me i said you understand it thoroughly completely fully i know where you're at daughter i know where you're at son he says then he could turn around and say to you i will never leave you comfortless and i go to prepare a place for you because he'd been there and when you've been you've walked a mile in someone's shoes you can understand there's some some feeling some hurt for them somebody said you walk a mile in somebody else's shoes and then you can leave them there because you're a mile away from the other guy how they say don't don't judge a man don't criticize a man till you walk on a mile in his shoes and they said and then you're a mile away that's our attitude sometimes but he walked in our shoes so that he would understand feel i feel the feeling of your infirmities see trust comes in a relationship it doesn't come by words everybody can speak good things everybody can say nice things but in a relationship is when the trust is built or broken so when you've had a relationship with god and he's never failed you he's never left you alone he's never left you on the side of the road having to figure this out by yourself you know you can trust him for everything and on that basis of what you've learned and experiencing your relationship with christ you can learn or you've learned to trust him for what you don't know i don't know what tomorrow holds but i know who holds tomorrow you know i i asked prayer requests here not too long about having to go up there and work in phoenix and it's a lot of driving that's that's the part i didn't want to have to to spend all that time driving the two days that i wrote up there was close to 500 miles of driving and it's just you know it's that's not what i like to do and and i know tucson when they tell me to go here it's you know over there i was constantly having to look up the place and you know just so i asked the lord i said you know is there a way we can get around this so he did he worked out really well he got my schedule a lot more busy and i don't have to go up there anymore i'm now working six to eight hours a day when i was only working two or three hours a day for a while it was so slow because of cobit they canceled most of our work and now we've got a full day of work and i said lord you knew how to do it keep me right in tucson where i'm happiest now i might have asked him lord just let me stay at home and pay me you know but he knew that would be good for me no he said i can give you guys enough work in town and you can stay in town and and and he's good he meets our needs he takes care of us she says and how do you learn this by experience that's the best way to learn is experiencing it yourself hands on hearing that still small voice for yourself it's good to be encouraged and lifted up by the testimony of others because they do encourage us knowing that jesus christ is the same man but when he gets down and he encourages you personally and then it becomes even more real peter says this in first peter chapter 1 verses 2 to 4 elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied mercy and favor unto you and peace multiplied no end to that peace not a period at the end of peace but multiplied blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead there's the key by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead and you were part of him brother brahm talks about this being in him being part of him he brother branham how many times when he's given an explanation gets into the seed how much of it is about a seed everything that is in that seed is in that seed it's been there all along every fruit every flower every leaf is in that seed and what's in that seed is going to manifest itself so in him was life it had to manifest itself as life if he's in you how is it going to manifest the same as it manifests in because it's the original he talks about that that citrus i believe was up in the phoenix the citrus tree that had the ingredient they grafted in a vines you know there was a it was an orange tree but it had lemons and and other grapefruit and stuff and they were grafted in and brother brandon was talking to the man there and they said so when it produces uh uh then when they come again over next year that orange um branch is going to give lemons right because it's on the lemon base he goes no it'll give oranges but if the tree itself produces another limb it will give limits so you wonder sometimes why certain people and i'm going to say this quote unquote christians can produce something ungodly and still be happy about it and still be fine with it they're grafted in he says they're taking from the life of god because god is the giver of life but it manifests what they are but if it ever puts another branch out it's going to be godly life and this is by the wreck the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you that fadeth not away doesn't lose its splendor doesn't lose its significance doesn't lose its value it's just as much if not more so than it's ever been i'm looking forward to that are you is that your desire saying lord that scripture is mine you know and sometimes you know we get to thinking and i i would stop thinking i said what is heaven going to be like and i remind myself many times what brother brahm said when he went beyond the curtain of time how many believes that actually happened or did brother brahm just make up things to draw the people no brother branham spoke of the things because he experienced them and you know what you can experience the same things that brother brahm did the same god speaking to you making it real making it alive to you calling you by name dealing with you the very things that he knows would catch your heart and your attention you know if somebody comes by and they're talking about something that you have no interest in at all and they're trying to talk to you you're trying to figure out a way how to get this to stop change the conversation do something different whatever but if somebody comes by and starts talking tacos they got my attention until we're done uh you know the other day when we were buying all the plants and um she said well i'm just going to take two or three i said no they're on sale they were half a regular 25 each they had them on sale for 14. i said let's get them all today you had your eye surgery already right so she couldn't bend over lift anything and so i'm with her and i'm picking him up putting him on the cart and then she says while we're here let's do this and while we're here we do this and i started counting tacos that's one dozen that's two dozen that's three dozen and so the lady at the cash register she's she's pushing him doing i'm doing this i go she's paying me in tacos i said she has she's at three dozen right now and she started laughing she goes i think it's worth it found somebody that agrees with me but you know the things that that you know and we laugh about i do eat other stuff honest but uh things that that in your heart that you know you love that you cherish you like it's and it's not i'm not talking about ungodly things things that are okay things are they're fine that that god has given us on this earth you know places to go uh things to see or whatever it is some that do hobbies that really enjoy it right now my wife has she just finished uh making a blanket for asher and she has one of those um machines that does the uh what do you call it quilting right yeah embroidery and stuff and so she was doing all these nice so chloe comes into the into the room and she sees it and she said what is that papa i said that's a blanket that um mama's making for asher fernandez making for asher and she gets this look on her face like where's mine that's right so she goes and with a little nani are you going to make me one two real like oh that didn't take her long for her to be making her one fact she's got it going already god treats us the same way what's your desire what's your heart lord you've blessed my brother and you've blessed my sister and while you're doing that i know that i'm one of yours and he loves to share his blessings he loves to meet you as an individual in your needs to see that god cares what are the things that he has prepared for us what's on the other side um we have loved ones that have crossed over you know especially some of those now who have especially older in age have lost father and have lost mother and maybe brothers and sisters i i think of my f my dad he's the only one of the him and his one brother living and and two sisters but he's lost quite a few others my wife lost both of her parents already there's something there for us to see them to god knows that but to each one the greatest thing is him but he said all that the father has given me will come and i won't put anyone out it's not my job to put them out it's my job to try to draw them in and he said i go to a play prepare a place in my father's house are many mansions in this thing that the brothers sent me and and uh he put you know brother brown said there's maybe one in tucson and two in phoenix and just that would be three in arizona and he's majoring at only three in arizona are going to make it i said what spirit is that when i would say lord jesus let my brother my sister each one that can be go there now and and he may be listening and i've had these conversations with him before i don't know if he is or not but i'm looking for a body change i'm looking to leave this earth to that other place i just don't want quote unquote a spiritual rapture i want to be in spiritual places in christ jesus but i'm looking for a physical change and i want the very things that he wants for me because they're best for me because his desire is like like he said in jeremiah 29 11 i know the thoughts that i have for you not of evil but of good to bring you an expected in or the reward the very things in other words the expected ending is what he's already planned what he's already laid out and it's not going to miss you know thinking about this and and and listening to some of the things this man said he was talking a little bit about job and job's three friends that came to comfort him and and more about accusations and comfort but finally in chapter 38 god comes to see him on the whirlwind and he puts his arm around your wall job you poor little guy you really have suffered yeah no he didn't do that he listened he asked job 66 questions job where were you job how about this joe to job finally realized i can't answer those questions i really don't know don't know nothing and he says i know but i do job and all this was planned all this way was laid in and you did overcome you did come out like i saw you would come out he's already seen you on the other side he's already had fellowship with you you were part of him you've got this space of time to live on this world but he's already seen you on the other side and he's gone to prepare a place for you put your name in there maybe say this so he's gone to prepare a place for me well anybody else going with me because if there's just one from tucson i know who he is come go with me the musicians would come up come go with me this god who has laid everything out planned everything out and is not going to miss a single time to was it 10 to the power of negative 36 and and they may he made a comment that hawking had got it all the way down to negative 46. like 58 billion isn't enough you have to get it 100 billion you know it's fine god is perfect in everything he does and and and to go back and see he never changes he's the same yesterday today and forever not having to modify his agenda not having to modify his politics not having to say ooh i've got to make these people happy now uh no what he's purposed will come to pass it never fails amen that what a day it will be we'll sing that let's bow our hands lord our hearts our desire is to please you lord while we're yet here on this earth don't know how much time is left here lord it's it seems like it should be about over now but that day's coming lord and we we just want to keep pressing forward in jesus name we press on and and lord it's it's it's coming soon we want to be ready we want we want to fulfill on this earth what you have us to fulfill lord we want to do our part but our desire is is to be with you lord has your desires to be with us lord to have your family with you again to the very ones that were part of you from the beginning lord we're looking to that lord help us to to be encouraged to be strengthened to see and to look in your word as we look through the bibles we look hear the message as we just to be encouraged that you've got it all under control lord nothing is by chance lord but everything is controlling in your hands and we are we are controlled and covered by you lord in the sense that you have it all ready for us lord jesus and we willingly say yes lord we're willingly to surrender to you and and follow your lead and command lord for what a day that will be we can't even begin to imagine it at times that we we we come up and we try to compare it with something that we would understand but lord it'll be way beyond that lord it'll be worth it all the lord we thank you for it jesus christ amen oh there is in a day when no heartache shall come no more clouds in the sky no more tears to dim behind all his peace forevermore on that happy golden show what a day glorious day that will be what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promises glorious day that will be oh there'll be no [Music] no more sickness no pain no more parting over them and forever i will be with the one who died for me what a day glorious day that will be what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me [Music] through the promised [Music] brother branham says when he goes crosses over in that vision that whatever it was he's he came back trying to explain it trying to tell us how to but finally he just said just don't miss it and you won't have to ask what was it like over there what did you know you were there too you are there too celebrating that fellowshipping that experience then and you know as you start to read through some of things and you find things that brother braham said sometimes you sometimes i wish you would just list them all out in one long you could you read here a part there a piece here and a part there just things to kind of quit your appetite a little bit more he says oh no he says he talks about education he said education he goes there won't be no education over there he said we'll be way beyond education and i don't know what that is but it's way beyond education thank god for the things he allows us to learn but won't it be wonderful there on that side on the other side oh what a day that will be let's stand won't it be wonderful there having no burdens to bear and they get the words up to that i'm gonna let them get the words because i'll probably remember the first line and that's about all so you love the lord jesus do you love one another do you pray for one another by this shall all man know you're my disciples when you have love for one another when with the savior we enter the glory and won't it be wonderful [Music] ending the troubles and cares of the [Music] won't it be a wonderful way [Music] [Music] won't it be joyously [Music] [Music] oh sure that forever the lord will be keeping us joyously [Music] yes won't it be wonderful [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] come over on come over and visit while we're there you know let's see i don't know it won't be measured by ears but that's the only thing we really understand brother lyle in the year 2 billion 934 i've got some time for you there it's our way of thinking but there won't be no time brother brown says you can travel like a thought what a wonderful thing what a wonderful thing you know things that scientists today and people are trying to find to you know dwell into that a little bit here and and they can find glimpses of it but to his his bride to those it's a promise for all of us you love him today is he good to you has he ever failed yet no never even when you underst don't understand he's never failed yet so i told my wife on the way in i said i don't have to be to my first job until eight o'clock tomorrow so if you want to get up at six o'clock tomorrow morning we'll start planting the bushes because it's a lot cooler at six o'clock in the morning and she looked at me kind of like really i said well i'll try to get him he says but that which we work for will eat well won't be for anybody else's you'll drink of your own vineyard yo he said but it won't be anything like this those of you that enjoy doing some of the things you enjoy if you enjoy it now i can imagine what it would be like over there so there's a prayer request from brother gerald petty that jesus supply all my needs of wisdom to pass a test and work a work meeting and able to learn to do my work on computers and that that jesus would keep me from ending up homeless and jesus would work out all his problems that's his promise that he would take care of you brother richard and and he will bro gerald i'm sorry do you believe that we'll believe it with you let's just let's just
