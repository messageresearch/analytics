your love your kindness to us all in jesus precious name amen before we're seated please open your bible to the gospel of mark i don't see mark i see jenny god bless you jenny but mark's not here we'll read a short but very familiar passage from the 12th chapter beginning at the 28th verse in fact it's one we read together only a short time ago the context is jesus in the temple during his final week we often call this the passion week it's after palm sunday before the sham trial and cruel death he had just silenced the sadducees and the pharisees masters of the jewish faith as well as the herodians political people of the ruling power but there was an insightful observer nearby who came and spoke up we read and one of the scribes perhaps he was just a record keeper or one who copied the scriptures maybe he was a minor official maybe a recent graduate of a prominent yeshiva a place where they study the bible but he came and having heard jesus and the officials and the high-ranking priests who had been challenging him reasoning together and and describe perhaps he was a young man perceiving that jesus had answered his challengers well asked jesus that's always a good idea go right to the source which is the first commandment of all and and jesus who may have been a little bit suspicious he's just been going through this interrogation by these other guys and here's another person coming up and asking a question maybe it's another attempt to twist his words or trap him a little bit we we see a couple of verses later that why this may have been so probably turning to face this person nonetheless and it gives them a very honest straightforward answer as jesus always does he says the first the commandment of primary importance is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god to what extent with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment have you ever noticed that this primary commandment isn't part of the ten commandments ten commandments are in exodus 20 in deuteronomy 5 but this is from deuteronomy 6. and then jesus asked he added this he wasn't asked it's not part of the ten it's found in leviticus 19 but he added this he pointed it out the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself as thyself there's none other commandment greater than these matthew's account of this conversation jesus says on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets and the scribes said to him well master teacher rabbi you've said the truth there is one god there's none other but he and to love him with all the heart with all the understanding with all the soul with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself now notice they're standing in the courtyard of the temple they're on the temple grounds the altar of sacrifice is no doubt visible from where they're standing and and and this young man probably just gestured toward it as he makes the rest of his statement here more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly wisely intelligently with understanding jesus saw this wasn't an attempt to trap or to twist it was a genuine question it was from a sincere heart he said to describe thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that dare to ask him any questions please be seated the passes we just read is one that we've read often we're all familiar with the parable that we call the good samaritan which was jesus shocking answer to the question who's my neighbor a couple of weeks ago i shared with you a brief testimony about a question i had in the message regarding the angel that launched brother branham's ministry and how he tied it to the birth of the modern state of israel another question had been on my heart and my mind for a long time the answer was right in front of me in fact i'd heard it i even knew it but i hadn't recognized it as the answer until very recently and that's tonight's topic it's what i want to share with you please open your bibles to the gospel of saint john we'll read briefly from the 13th and the 15th chapters scriptures so familiar to most of us here that they're written in indelible ink on our hearts john 13 verse 34 we read jesus speaking a new commandment i give unto you we've got 613 do we need another one a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another tonight i want to speak about the nature of that love that we're to have how it identifies us when heather and i moved back to tucson from washington in december of 2012 i i had a lingering question about this very passage i asked brother greene and others somehow i didn't register the answer and messages were brother branham references this verse there are approximately ten he often speaks of love compassion breaking down walls helping a fallen brother drawing his circle of fellowship larger to encompass his critics putting out your hand in your heart to others who disagree he used denominational barriers to illustrate the walls that separate and it's all true and it's all applicable and we need to do those things but my question was what is the nature what is the expression of that love that will mark us to all men as christians put another way what's different about the love we should have for each other that almost anyone who observes us will recognize that we are jesus disciples his students his apprentices what brother branham once called messiah ets little messiahs in john 15 12 we read this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you and he goes on he says greater love has no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends now in my mind i'd always separated these two verses where to love is jesus loved but but his sacrifice laying down his life was all-encompassing we're not going to die on a cross to take away the sin of the world we're not that perfect sacrifice that's an act that can inspire us and for which we are eternally grateful but that was something for him to do and him alone he laid down his life for us not while we were even his friends while we were yet in sin his enemies we were part of that crowd that screamed crucify him we i drove the spikes in his outstretched limbs and even in that ultimate agony he screamed out father forgive them they don't know what they're doing why did he do this that we might be the children of god think about that for a moment jesus is our brother let's read from first john the third chapter you might want to leave a mark on your bible because we'll be going back to this one again tonight starting at verse 1 we read behold what manner what type behold the nature of the love of the father the father is the expression of god's office of highest authority the love the father has bestowed upon has given to us that we should be called the sons the children the offspring think of that the very children of god therefore i'm sorry we should be calm i clicked it one too many times excuse me therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god when we don't have to wait for this relationship it is our relationship at this very moment it does not yet appear what we shall be but but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we'll see him as he is paul mentions this last part in his second letter to the corinthians 2 corinthians 3 18 we read but we all with open face beholding as in a glass that's a mirror we see only a reflection of the glory of the lord and are changed into the same image the same likeness from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord god's children children i want to digress here for just a moment let's jump to the year 1996 and we'll go across the atlantic ocean an amazing thing happened in england that year some scientists took a cell from an adult you a female sheep it wasn't an egg it wasn't a stem cell it was just a cell they extracted the nucleus of the cell and from it they created a cell that was implanted in the uterus of another female sheep this cell divided and grew and after the allotted time that you gave birth to a lamb from that cell they named that lamb dolly she was a clone genetically identical to the sheep from which the cell was taken if she had fingerprints her fingerprints would match that in the adult sheet that donated the cell not an egg not a stem cell just a cell well dolly got sick and died a few years later and there was speculation that well she died early because she was a clone and and and that cell was old and so therefore she was born old and so forth so so they cloned dolly again but this time they made four sheep that's daisy debbie denise and diana there won't be a test they lived the normal lifespan of sheep they got along just fine because they weren't just siblings they were copies they had slightly different outcomes one got injured and so forth because we do not have a predetermined outcome based solely on our genetics or our dna we're also a product of an influence by our life experiences isn't that part of the reason we're here to develop character through our experiences god doesn't want clones doesn't want to stamp out on an assembly line mindless robots or identical people when you've seen one you've seen them all does not apply to humans he wants children that's his desire that's his will and children though from the same parents are different each is unique here's a rather poor photo of myself and my two brothers taken in the early days of photography yeah they had invented photography before i was born believe it or not this picture was taken on 1954-55 paul my oldest brother is there on the right noel is on the left noah was bigger than me at one point that cute little kid in the middle and yes my mother made the shirts you can see that the three of us are quite different you've seen me here with my brother noel we're recognizable as brothers have many similarities but we're very different in appearance and in other ways god loves diversity i may sound like a politician but that's not what i'm driving at i'm i'm not focusing on our differences only noting that we are all different our planet teems with myriad species and variations it's by design it's for a reason in 1957 and the message i will restore brother branham mentions this just sort of in passing he says you know there's none of us just alike if we should all go up this morning and they give us fingerprint we find out there's no two fingerprints exactly alike that's known they claim there's no to people god knows is just exactly alike be grateful we're so different one to another and many make up but we can certainly agree that we're all humans and in our religious beliefs we find the same thing we might not believe on every principle but we believe on christ and that's the main thing regardless of those differences that diversity what has god made us as children what has he called us to unity not uniformity but unity different but with a common aim and goal force is us to resolve our differences find common ground grow develop character those four sheep clones got along fine they're clones they're the same paul talks about this ephesians the fourth chapter verse 1 we read i therefore the prisoner of christ beseech implore appeal to i urge you that you walk worthy of the vocation what what is your vocation it's not your hobby that's what you do for a living your work your calling wherewith ye are called with all lowliness and meekness long suffering for bearing one another in love humility gentleness unselfishness deference patience endeavoring making every effort diligently persevering to keep the the what unity of the spirit and the bond of peace i'd like to show you a little illustration here the story behind this picture is that when this father's kid started fighting he didn't join in he just got out the big shirt the kids knew what that meant they'd both have to wear it until the fighting stopped and it worked because the big shirt taught you that harmony with others is always in your own best interest just like harmony within ourselves we must pull ourselves together or we'll rip ourselves apart i wonder if the upper room during the 10 days between the ascension and the day of pentecost wasn't a big shirt experience we read in acts 2 1 that they were all with one accord in one place then the holy spirit came the spirit didn't bring unity unity brought the spirit i recall a meeting that i attended in washington dc about 40 years ago i was 32 years of age i was part of an international all-volunteer group called amsat that that designed built and arranged for the launch of satellites for use in amateur radio we were preparing to launch our most ambitious spacecraft ever another volunteer group which i was a president wanted to do some groundbreaking experiments with digital communications computer networking if you will using this spacecraft in order to succeed we had to come to agreement on some specific ways in which we could enable these communications through a satellite that at times could see half the planet and there were strong proponents of differing incompatible approaches to accomplish this goal think of it as a kind of a tower of babel problem we had to speak the same language encode the data in an agreed way it quickly gets pretty technical i won't bore you with the details but the president of amsat saw that this problem had to be solved so he solved it with the big shirt he put us all everybody that wanted to develop and participate in these experiments we all went into a room with him he locked the door he held up the key he said no one leaves until we all agree it worked so did the experiments getting back to paul he says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace he says there's one body one spirit you're all called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of us all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ skipping down to verse 11 we read he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors teachers for the perfecting of the saints that's a plural that's us for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body that's one of christ the body of christ that's also us till we come to the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children toddlers without understanding tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him becoming adult offspring in all things which is the head even christ from which the whole body fitly joined together and compacted that by which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body and to the edifying of itself in love so we see we're all different we have different purposes different functions within the one body one is not more important or less important than another all have a role each is necessary all right but what about that love brother lyle oh thank you let's get back on track here john wrote his three epistles his letters after his patmos exile after the book of revelation of jesus christ after he witnessed the life of christ after he was present on the mount of transfiguration after walking with jesus for the duration of his ministry after he witnessed the resurrection of jesus and the outpouring of the spirit of pentecost these are among john's last words to the church after all those they express his final overriding concern he's sharing and teaching his last lesson back to first john chapter 3 verse 11. this is the message you've heard from the beginning that we should love one another nothing new here he's saying you've heard this from the beginning it's been consistent love one another a surprising statement not as cain who was of that wicked one and killed his brother and why did he kill him because cain's works were evil and abels were righteous cain was overcome with jealousy marvel not my brethren if the world hate you we know that we have passed from death unto life that's interesting it usually goes the other way because how do we know it we love the brethren he that doesn't love his brother abides in death whosoever hates whosoever detests his brother is a murderer hence the earlier reference to cain and you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him and now comes the verse that hit me between the eyes hereby perceive we this is how we understand this is how we recognize the love of god because he lay down his life for us and here it is we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren i like how the niv puts this verse this is how we know what love is jesus christ laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters it says brothers and sisters we've pointed out before that the greek word that's usually translated brothers and brethren is a gender neutral word not a transgender word a gender-neutral word so what does this mean well john goes on sounding a bit like james this point who so hath this world's good and sees his brother have need and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him how dwells the love of god in him my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but indeed and in truth james puts it be not hearers but doers and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us god's greater than our heart and knows all things beloved our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards god and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight which commandments are john speaking of here he tells us in the next verse this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ faith and too many of us stop there but there's an and love one another our opening scripture this evening as jesus conversed with the scribe as he gave us commandment which we just read in john's gospels chapter 13 and 15 to love one another as jesus loved us and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he and him and hereby we know that he abides in us by the spirit which he's given us we are to love as he loved he died for us that was sin offering it's done past completed at calvary that's why he had to be the uniquely begotten son of god but we're also told romans 8 29 the verse after the one that we always quote we're told that he was the firstborn among many brethren that's us the firstborn is a rank it carries privilege and responsibility as well as reward but what is the underlying lesson for us of his example of love journey with me back to that last night he spent with his apprentices they just had a meal together jesus had identified judas as the traitor after washing judah's feet humility he had told peter in front of them all that peter would turn his back on him and then where did he and the remaining 11 including peter where did they go guess how many let's read from luke's gospel chapter 22 starting at verse 39 he came out and went as he was want to the mount of olives in other words he went here often one of his favorite places to get alone with the father when he was in jerusalem to pray to seek his will and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place a place where he often went to pray he said to them pray that ye enter not into temptation temptation is king james english for testing put to proof adversity jesus was about to confront his greatest test and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly i can't believe that jesus was never earnest in his prayers but he's praying more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground this was his biggest trial matthew tells us he implored his father three times to bypass the cross in matthew 26 42 we read he went away again the second time and prayed saying oh my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went a gay way again and prayed the third time saying the same words what's the lesson here for us jesus died to himself at gethsemane he surrendered his own will and he did it for us likewise the example we must die to self surrender our own will reflect that nature for one another oh my or is it oh me love one another as i have loved you by this will all men know you're my disciples let me share with you something brother branham said about this topic from revelation chapter five number one preached in 1961 he's giving us a little anecdote here about when he was visiting he says a few days ago i was sitting talking to my loyal little friend here in the city a medical doctor sam adair and he said how you doing bill and i said oh pretty fair i suppose doc i said yourself and he said oh a lot of patients said i had 15 examinations this afternoon i said well that's good as long as it's just examinations and finding nothing wrong i said you know that we got talking about back when we were boys i said well doc i don't know just how long i'm going to be around we're both in our 50s and he said oh that's true bill i said but but all these years about 31 years of ministry now i've kept my heart prepared for that hour when he comes so it doesn't matter when he comes and he said oh that's true i said the greatest thrill i have is living for others and he said that's what life is makes life real is when you not what you can do for or accomplish for yourself what you can do for others that's sam adair talking brother brandon goes on see that's when you're really living if there happens to be someone among us who has never did that try to deliver somebody else give that a try see just how much more life holds for you well you will not live for what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give someone else in life such as i have give i unto you is what peter said right and you'll find it's more blessed than riches or anything that can be thought of is that what you can do for someone else to make life's burdens which life itself is a burden and will make it a little lighter for someone else you just don't know the joy unless you tried it once to do something for someone else well that's exactly what john's talking about and jesus was telling his students and demonstrating by example that's what surrendering your will to him is is to live your life for others i want to share another excerpt this is from that day on calvary 1960. random saying you're lost to begin with as long as you look to what you've done but don't look to what you've done look what that day on calvary did to you it paid your price it settled the question your sins be as scarlet they're white as snow red like crimson fight like wool then you have no sin you're perfectly sinless no matter what you've done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted jesus christ as your savior your sins are forgiven anything is forgiven is remitted and forgot about then what does it do it gives you after that condition his spirit to follow him and to do as he did for others who was following on he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing i want to say is jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved that when it come in the lamb of god he lived had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot that they were sons you're a son you're taking christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others well brother branham i can live for this brother he's sure a nice man that's not it live for that man that hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could that's what they'd done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives up its wool you look on towards calvary i hope this helps you to get in a place that's what the tabernacle is that's what all people has got to do is find out what you are what's the purpose church isn't going to church just to play music sing songs church is a place where correction judgment begins at the house of god matthew and luke allude to this from the lips of jesus let's start with luke 13 23 then one said unto him lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them strive it's a battle it takes work hard difficult not always pleasant work effort strive to enter in at the straight gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able wait i thought you said seek and you shall find why aren't these able to find because it has to be according to his will it isn't our effort though that effort is absolutely required but he's sovereign he sits on the throne as i've said before this isn't her democracy it isn't politics it's his life in you continuing when once the master of the house who's the master of the house you me it's the father when he has risen up and has shut to the door and you begin to stand without him to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us he shall answer and say unto you i know you're not once you are. what about knock and it shall be opened remember who's on the throne now is the day of salvation now he's our savior then he's our judge it's all about him it's not about us then you shall begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence it's not about bride pride or i was a friend of the prophet and thou has taught in our streets i sponsored your meeting he shall say i tell you i know not once you are depart from me all you workers of iniquity let's see what matthew relates chapter 7 verse 21 not every one that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and thy name have cast out devils and thy name done many wonderful works well look what he says then i will profess unto them i never knew you we never had a relationship depart from me yet at work iniquity in chapter 25 starting at verse 31 he really brings it home when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory the throne of his glory turns out is a throne of judgment and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats he shall set the sheep on his right hand and goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come be blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and you fed me i was thirsty you gave me a drink i was a stranger you took me in naked you clothed me i was sick you visited me i was in prison you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when did we see you hungry and fed you were thirsty and and gave you a drink when did we see you a stranger and took you in or naked and clothed you or saw with these sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto the one of the least of these my brethren my siblings you have done it unto me not my followers not my servants not my friends not my business associates not my schoolmates but my family my siblings god's children expressed the love by which all men would know that you're my disciples then shall we say unto them on the left and depart from me you cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels i was hungry you didn't feed me i was thirsty you gave me no drink i was a stranger you didn't take me in naked you didn't give me clothes sick prison you ignored me and they'll answer them lord when did we see you in this state and didn't help you out and he answered saying verily i say to you in as much as you did it not to the one of least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous and to life eternal living for others as brother branham puts it is really summed up as dying to self dying to live and john's first letter of the church expresses it is dying to self for others it's all the same thing that's exactly how that love that we must have is expressed the love by which all men shall know that you are my disciples is how jesus put it it's a constant struggle it's a battle it's not a one and done sort of thing listen what jesus said found in matthew 10 verse 38 and he that taketh not his cross doesn't surrender his own will and follow after me is not worthy of me he that finds his life shall lose it he that loses his life for my sake shall find it he's talking about dying to self not a literal cross but think of the effect this illustration had on his audience they witnessed literal crucifixions regularly the horror of it the fact that it was imposed on them by the hated conquerors the romans gentiles heathens ruling over them inflicting terrible pain and suffering and that's the context that they heard this luke tells us a bit more about this chapter 9 verse 23 he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself let him die to himself and take up his cross ooh two steps die to self live for others how often must we do this we must deny our own will and take up the cross death to self he says daily this is a daily thing this is ongoing and follow me he's carrying his cross too he was alone my god why have you forsaken me here now when i need you the most but we're not we're not alone he says i'll never leave you nor forsake you he's been there for whosoever will save his life shall lose it whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it it's not optional today we'd say it's a mandate die daily it's not easy it's an ongoing exercise i'm closing now it requires dedication work failing falling down getting up falling again getting up falling again and again and again because he wants children with character not clones without choice how can we do this back to john's gospel the first chapter as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god we must be born again born of his spirit become his children dying to self loving each other what assurance do we then have paul tells us in our final verse of the evening found in the first chapter of philippians being confident assured not a shadow of a doubt of this very thing that he that hath begun a good work in you who is that papa god will perform it until he gets bored with it all tires of us and takes a nap no until the day of jesus christ if he's begun that good work in you then you can possess that confidence as brother aaron comes to close the service maybe we could sing he's all i need [Music] need he's all i need jesus [Music] is [Music] jesus he is all i need he is all i know he is all i need [Music] jesus [Music] if you'll stand with me i'm going to live [Music] wants me to live i'm going to give until they're just no more to give i'm going to love love till there's just no more i could never never out love the lord one more time i'm going to live the way he wants me to live i'm going to give until there's just no more [Music] [Music] i'm going to live the way he wants me to live i'm going to give until there's just no more ticket that's what the song says and that's what we've sung but you can't do it by yourself you can't make this happen on your own you have to surrender to him first you have to yield to him and let him live in you and then his nature because you are his children begins to reflect in our best efforts and our best how many times have gotten them in the morning today lord i'm gonna give myself to you i'm gonna i'm gonna help somebody and then something else comes up and then the days gone by you didn't accomplish the things you thought you could accomplish but you say in the morning when you get out of bed when you wake up get your day started lord i surrender all you guide me you lead me you allow me to give that which you've placed in me and then he being that's my child that's my daughter that's my son and he begins to express himself in you because you are a child of god you are a son and daughter of god he did that for you and and sometimes a message like this is just makes a stop for a woman look at ourselves closely lord i didn't do too good today or but help me lord i wanna i wanna do that i get up in the morning and say well i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this i'm gonna but first we should say lord what would you have me do today and he brings someone across your way something happens and you're able to manifest christ to others amen and he puts it clearly in the scripture he said when did we do this to you lord when you did it to one of my little ones amen it makes life worth the living so [Music] let's just bow our hands for a moment lord all of us here under the sound of the voice she used today and brother lyle lord and those listening we all look at ourselves closely and said i definitely could do better i definitely could give more lord help us just to surrender and let you lord with that purpose in life lord to be a true disciple a true follower a true example of jesus christ on this earth is our prayer lord to one another lord and that others may see god christ in us for it's the hope of glory lord we ask it in jesus christ's name amen just a couple of things to remind you of
