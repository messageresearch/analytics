Martha listened to it quite a bit unbeknownst to me printed out the words and practiced it and then this morning I got inspired and turned it on and listened to it but I usually like to practice the song a little bit more and I was kind of praying about it as we were driving to church should we do it this morning or not and we come up Oracle here right to turn on Jacinto and there's a gentleman walking across the uh Street you could say maybe homeless or whatever and he had palm branches in his arms and I thought well Lord do you know the use when you hear the words of this song here you'll you'll know kind of why that that spoke to me there so amen God bless you this is a song that's audience participation I saw the Wayward traveler in tattered garments clap and struggling up the

morning wow to take the pulpit with that Spirit and the power that's in the church right now friends we have no idea what the Lord could do this morning but I promise you I believe he's gonna do something God bless you all it's before you before I have you seated let's turn in our Bibles to James chapter 4. I'm going to preach from the Old Testament this morning but I want to read a new testament verse because I think it applies to what I'll be talking about thank you sister that's fine James chapter 4 verse 1 reads like this from whence come Wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lust the war in your members you lust and you have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight a new war yet you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts let's bow our head Lord Jesus we thank you for your word this morning we pray father that you'd be with us this morning and Lord that our service everything that's said from this pulpit every word that's that's sung Lord and every thought that's in the people's minds I pray that it would be pleasing to you and Lord that this service will come up before you as a sweet smelling savior and father that you be pleased in Jesus name amen God bless you all you can take your seats I do feel good this morning I uh I'm excited I I believe that somehow some way that today is going to be a special day that the Lord's with us first of all I want to I want to group some greet some of our visitors I do see quite a few names quite a few people out there that I don't immediately recognize um Rafael Phipps and Carlos Lopez where are you they're in the

it's good to see you all back there if I were if if I understood right you just either walked by or driven by this church many many times and decided to stop in a few weeks ago is that right come God

Daniel that have come out from Jeffersonville and uh they Fellowship amen they fellowship at a Brother's church that's just so dear to my heart Brother Brad Burgess brother Joe is his grandson God bless you all it's good to have you I see more too it's uh well I won't recognize every everybody but I I see quite a few God bless you all and we appreciate you all coming and worshiping with us and fellowshipping with us ahead of my heart this morning to preach on the ultimate goal of a Christian and that's to have a relationship with God we I think it's overlooked so often but I think it is the most important thing that we can even think about in our lives is to have that personal relationship with our Lord and with our savior and so often I think that that we ask things of God and we forget that this is a two-way relationship that that God is a father and he loves us and he provides for our every needs but we should also show him our love and then when we do that then we see the Lord begin to operate in our midst brother Lionel Salazar shared a testimony with me last week that something that just about something that just happened last Sunday blessed me so much I thought brother Lionel you gotta tell the whole church are you willing all right come on up my brother I'll tell you what it blessed me and I think it'll probably bless you as much as it blessed me to hear what happened how the Lord used our brother when he put God first my brother it's good to see you bless you my friend greetings to you all on this blessed Sunday given to us by the Lord Jesus Christ it's a blessing to be here I'd like to thank the pastor Evans for inviting me to come up and to share this story I hope it blesses you I would like to say a special hello and God bless you to my painting Brothers they were helping us paint the uh the room next door here for the church there's more to do yeah we got more to do yeah these uh these little Peterson kids man this is that little crew man they're a little army man amen it was a blessing to have him with us um my heart's a little heavy right now because uh from the minute that brother Evans asked me if I come up and say this uh testimony man we just went under attack chaos Came Upon Us the family turned out into a a really bad bickering argument over nothing really but uh I asked them we all asked each other for forgiveness and we got past it I'd still like them to ask him for to forgive me for my part in the little argument but I see exactly what's going on the minute God wants you to do something then the devil hears it then he comes and he tries to attack amen and it's them little small things that he tries to use to try to convince you to not do the big things and the big things is these things here right now today this is the big things to tell a story about something that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ done in our lives and this is a story about a family member of mine this happened last Sunday um started with a dream again many of you all know that it was a dream that brought me here a short while ago to this church and uh we were having church last Sunday who went home the night before I had another dream and my dream showed me a family member it was a brother there was a visitor that came to the house and uh something really bad happened to a to one of my brothers and I was just shooking up really bad and uh I woke up from the dream and it affected me so much that I didn't speak about it for the whole day but I realized what the dream was doing it was trying to prepare me for something else that was going to happen that day um we came to church here in the morning last Sunday and we went home and instead of having a visitor come to the house to give us some news we get a phone call and the phone call was about a brother it wasn't my brother but it was my father-in-law's brother our uncle they had to rush him to the hospital by ambulance and uh he was in the in the emergency room fighting for his life so father-in-law calls us and tells us the news we tell them well we'll meet you there at the hospital we get to the hospital and uh they had already put the family members inside a special little room with it's a very uh urgent situation they'll kind of gather the family members into a little room so they're not all inside the ER so we're inside the little small room and uh uncle's uh boys are in there and they're they're already grown but those are his boys and while we're inside the room you know there's just a heavy feeling in the air there's a lot of there's a lot of uh there's a lot of anger there's a lot of uncertainty you can you can see the black cloud of death that's all around um we're inside the room and all of a sudden the doctors and the nurses they go running they call it code blue or they call her code blue we heard what room it was it was uncle's room um he started what what we know inside the uh the medical profession I was in for a little he started swirling the drain is what they call it's where he started dipping out so when they called The Code Blue I turned to everybody in the room I said look we're gonna have about 20 minutes and either they're going to come back in and they're going to say that he made it or they can say he did it because what they're doing is they're they're working him give him CPR and everything okay um his boy started getting sick you know we're all sitting there just watching this you can hear all the commotion going on down the hallway so we're sitting here just listening and watching this whole thing he's getting ready to go out and then um finally the nurse came in after about 20 minutes and she said look she goes what happened was his heart stopped beating she said we lost them she said but we all worked we got together and we were able to bring him back but now we're going to send him to the ICU but we got to figure out why his Hearts his heart's continuously going this way so she told us if there's anybody here that wants to go in and visit with him do it now before you get to the ICU because of the fact that they have more stricter rules in the ICU you can't just go in and see there's a one or two could only go in at a time so I had already made my mind up that I wasn't going to go in and see him because I wanted to let the other family members immediate more immediate family members see them um so my father-in-law went in one more time my wife went in one more time and I mean the situation was just it was Dire and my father-in-law comes back you know there's Tears in their eyes and everything of what just happened his son had already stepped out you know he was getting sick he couldn't sit there and listen and watch this then when we were sitting there my father-in-law looks at me and like I said I was already my mind was made up I wasn't going to go in into the room father-in-law looks at me and uh this to me is amazing because the brother Evans was speaking about the role of a father on Father's Day and he says faith the faith of a father the devil will do everything that he can to try to destroy the faith of a father and to try to get the father out of the uh out of the household okay now my father-in-law he's the oldest one uh in this family of the brothers and sisters you know we all look up to him as a father he's been to this church a couple of times I believe he looks at me and he says line on get in there and go pray for my brother what praise the Lord you know that that came as a surprise to me because all of a sudden it was with all the authority in the world he had been in there I'm sure he's prayed in his heart my wife Lionel go pray for my brother I get up immediately and say okay now I'm going to go in the room now I went into the room went up to Uncle and touched them introduced myself let him know who I was he was he was innovated he was out I started proclaiming the name of Jesus over him and letting him know that Jesus was the Healer and that he was a child a child of the king he was part of the Kingdom and as I as I prayed for him his eyes opened and they started twitching they started looking back and forth and I said the prayer we left went back to the room um my father-in-law then said that that they were going to leave because they were going to ship Uncle to the ICU and and we shook his hand said goodbye and me and my wife were going to leave but we realized that the uncle that was in the hospital had left his phone inside the room there so we wanted to wait there till his Sanders somebody else came in there so we give them the phone um finally uh one of his sons came in we gave him the phone and it was the same son that was there witnessing the doctors and the nurses running in an urgent situation because he was he had coded right then we heard the most beautiful noise you could ever hear there was another commotion going on down the hallway it was the same it was the same doctors and nurses and medical professionals you know they were see what that says only believe amen only yes amen they were running back and forth out of his room because he was now fighting to try to get out of his bed and walk out of the hospital amen now it was such an immediate thing man you say prayers sometimes and you don't realize how all of a sudden it could be that immediate yes amen you know and and we're blessed right now that the pastor Evans and brother Lyle and them are going into the book of Acts and we're reading that book and we're listening I've talked to a brother a good friend of mine real good close brother the other day that's been listening in and he says Hey inside that book of Acts the series that they're doing down there has opened my eyes up so much he goes I've seen so many new things in it he goes with the direction of the Holy Spirit now he goes I'm seeing just new things in there amen well I'm going to tell you something unless we take our position and our part in the book of Acts of itself amen there's where the power is it is a living book and inside that book there's a spirit and we open ourselves up that Holy Spirit will come and live in us and it doesn't matter whether you've been a part of a church for two weeks or 20 years 30 years whether you go to church or not what matters is if you believe in the name of Jesus amen that's it no matter where you go how young how old whatever you may be if you could just stand strong on the name of Jesus yes amen and you say that prayer Proclaim that name then just buckle up and just wait and watch and see what happens amen I'm gonna turn it back over here to the brother Evans I appreciate you for listening to me and God bless you all amen I've been praying recently past few months I've been asking the Lord Lord show us that you're with us Lord not everything it seems like can be impersonated but when God comes down and heal someone miraculously like that then we know that that is God because that can't be that Satan can't do that Jesus himself said if Satan casts out Satan then his kingdom is divided he doesn't do that it's only God that heals and if you know anything about the medical field you know that that when they are performing CPR on someone when their heart stops it's generally a very very bad thing brother Lionel was a a medical professional he's he's handled this for these type of things for a long time and you know that those things just don't turn around they almost never do and to see that to see the family gathered around what touched me the most about that testimony when he was telling me that the family was gathered around and it was just a just a somber really bad feeling as he said the sun was just sick and everything was just going really bad and then brother Lionel's father-in-law looks at him and he sees a man that loves the Lord that believes in healing and he says Lionel you go pray for him and what I want to talk about this morning is when we see someone when the world sees someone with that relationship with God they flock to that person and they rely on him and I that very thing this last Sunday that brother Lyle was Lionel was talking about is exactly what I'm saying this morning that when someone finally finds that relationship which is my goal in life when someone finally sees it then people have confidence in that manner in that woman and we fall so short of what God's given us I think about brother Branham said this I really appreciate this quote he says what is faith he says faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God and that's how when we are praying for something if we can just get into the spirit and we can just get God's mind on these things if we can just find God's will then our prayers will be answered we've been talking about the book of Acts a lot we see all these miracles happen in the book of Acts and you look at it and you see well okay well what's the big picture in this in these things in these Miracles that those people that were healed every one of them is dead today every one of them died but that miracle that happened that so many people saw over and over at the gate called beautiful and and Paul when that when the young man fell to his death and he died and this miracle like what brother Lionel was talking about those Miracles are also not only do they obviously benefit the person that it happened to but these Miracles also are a testimony of a living God that he's alive and he is not dead he is not a god of the past but he is a god of now that scripture means so much it means more to me every day in Hebrews chapter 13 verse 8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's the same God I think about this man Moses this man Moses had a relationship with God a wonderful relationship to where God tells Moses one day he said I know your name like wow what a thing for God to tell us Moses had this relationship with God he gave Moses showed how much he loved God not so much God loving us but sometimes we have to show how much we love him Moses showed how much he loved God he gave everything up in the whole world at 40 years old he was going to be the next pharaoh yet Moses gives it all up for this group of people that were in slavery Moses knew that those were God's people and he gave up riches and fame and everything he could if he would have been the next pharaoh he could have probably freed the slaves if he wanted to but no Moses sought God's Will and God's will was for him to go out in the wilderness for 40 years he was 40 years old double his age is how long that he was going to be there another 40 years Moses goes out in the wilderness comes back brings the children of of Israel out of Egypt out of bondage with a mighty hand goes out into the wilderness meets with God and Moses it was the desire of Moses's heart to please God and he knew that God Loved These people Moses goes up there speaks to God and and he gets excited and he's he tells the people he says you can meet God yourself he says I want you to know the same one that I know so he goes out and he tells the people he says Get Ready he says because you can meet this Jehovah God the creator of everything you can meet him look at the look at the the desire in Moses's heart God wanted that Exodus chapter 20. Verse 18 Moses says Get Ready get ready for this because we're going to go meet them they get up the next morning and they go with all of the congregation of Israel's goes to meet God and all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpets and the mountains smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die and Moses said unto the people trying to get them back fear not God has come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that you sin not but here are these people and they're saying wait a minute we didn't we didn't sign up for this they see them the the Fire on the Mountain and the thunderings and the lightning and they see all this and they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa this is too much if I go before this God with all the sins that I have in my life then I'm gonna die you know what Moses why don't you just go why don't you go before us Moses you have a good relationship with him I don't really want that relationship because it's too much of a burden on me so Moses you just go and you just tell us what he said what slap in the face to God brother Braham said this the unconditional Covenant with God made with the people this is the kind of thing that I need to back up with something someone else said and now how God has always made his Covenant and when he made it with a man the greatest mistake that Israel ever made was in Exodus 19th Chapter when Grace had already provided a savior it had already provided a deliverer deliver it had already provided an atonement a shed blood and Israel said don't let God speak let Moses speak they wanted law or commandment or something that they could do themselves do you see the very nature of a man for me to go before God I have to be sincere I have to want to be with him not just want my salvation but I have to want what God wants and you look at these people they wanted their own lives they wanted their own sins they didn't want they didn't want to give them up they they said well Moses has a good relationship he's God's Prophet let's just take him imagine how that made God feel you know we we think about God and we think about God is all love and judgment and we don't see that there's a whole spectrum of feelings that God has himself in the middle so they say well we we don't we don't want what God has we don't we don't want to have that relationship we would rather have a pastor or we would rather have a mother or a father or a prophet or someone else we would rather him have that or her have that relationship because we don't really want it because the stakes are too high it's too it's too important for us that we have that personal relationship with God we would just rather someone else have that it's everywhere today and it's been here since that time God says okay from that point on I'll just speak to them through a prophet I'll just have one representative sad a sad thing that happened right there was too much pressure too much was expected I can't just go to church to be a Christian I don't need I'll just go on Sunday I'll just go to church once a week I'll just that that makes me a Christian I don't want God in my personal life I don't want God telling me what to do in the quiet time when no one is watching I don't want to have to live up to his word I don't want to have to have that relationship where he's always I'm always commuting back and forth with him but it's what God wanted so what God wanted from the beginning so then time goes on Moses goes up on the mountain to speak with God and he's up there for 40 days it doesn't take any food or water with him the people see hey now that our representative between us and God now he's gone no we don't have anybody looking over us now there's no Authority at all so let's just go back and do what we want to do so they build this golden calf they start partying they start living it up Moses comes down on the mountain and he looks and he sees what are you doing I'm gone for just this long and you immediately go back into what you came out of you immediately go back into what you came out of yeah think of denominations and he says what he says he takes the calf he throws it in the furnace Burns it up grinds it up the powder puts it in a bunch of buckets of water and says drink it now so they drink it Moses takes the Levites he says he says go and take your sword and they killed 3 000 of the people the Wrath and the anger then Moses goes back up to the mountain to plead for mercy on the people of Israel how sweet of Moses Moses knew that God loves the people Moses loved the people and he goes up and he knew that he's the one that had that relationship with God and they didn't want it so Moses knew that I have that relationship with him so I'll go and talk to him on behalf of the people the people should have been going each one of us we should have been going directly to Jehovah but no we didn't want it we wanted somebody to stand in our place Moses goes up there and like I said God don't forget God has feelings Moses goes up on the mountain and he says Lord they've done all this and and I'm sorry about it God tells Moses look at look at the sweetness of God here God looks down at Moses and he says Moses he says I promised to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob I promised them that their offspring would go into this Promised Land over across this Jordan River I promised them that they would go over there he says so here's what I'm going to do he says Moses get them together and he said I will send my angel before you and he said this angel will destroy your enemies and he says you can take them and you can go over this Jordan River and you can have this promised land it's a place that's flowing with milk and honey it's a wonderful place it's a place that I promised you and he said but I won't go with you ask yourself if I could have everything in the world but God won't go with me what good is it I think so Moses comes back and he tells the people he says listen he says he says all he says you can have this he says we can go over he said and God will go with us and he'll send an angel and know he'll fight and destroy all the enemies there won't be any problems we can have all these grapes and we can have this land that's flowing with milk and honey but we're not going tells the people we're not going the reason we're not going is because God won't go with us oh and the people repented and they they felt awful so Moses goes back up and I want to read something Moses says in in um Exodus 33. verse number 15. no Exodus 33. verse 15. it says this there we go and Moses speaking and he said unto him speaking to Jehovah God he said If thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence Lord if you won't go with me I'm not going I'm staying with you wherever you wherever you want to be Lord that's where I want to be I don't have to have all the riches I don't have to have the biggest church I don't have to have the best music I don't have to have any of this Lord wherever you are is where I want to be I just want you I just want that fellowship with you Moses talks the Lord appreciated that remember he's a father he's got feelings he's not wrath and love he's those two things but there's all this stuff in the middle that he's got those if you have feelings he has feelings too we're Made In His Image God appreciated Moses he appreciated what he said and then Moses shows his true character Moses is is talking with the Lord back and forth and and he says and and the Lord's pleased and then Moses slips in a little question this is a good time right now I'm sure he was thinking in his mind this is a time right now that I can ask the desire of my heart Moses says Lord can I see you oh it shows Moses the desire of his heart was just to have that fellowship with God just to please God verse number 18. and he said I beseech thee show me thy Glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and I will show Mercy to whom I will show Mercy and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me that thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in the cleft of The Rock and I will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen and Moses did it and all of that time in the presence of the Lord Moses was able to catch a glimpse of who this Jehovah was I'll bet you it did change him so then Moses would would commune and and talk with the Lord and after that Moses would get so close to the Lord he'd be in the presence of the Lord that he would come down and his face would shine beautifully had just this glow that everyone could see it and everyone wanted to see it and here Moses after he's in the presence Lord he comes among the people and what does he do he takes a veil and covers his face why would he do that you ever think we all we know that story but why would Moses cover his face among the people and then we go back before the Lord he take it off why maybe do you think maybe Moses didn't want it to be about him it was such a supernatural thing this man glowing and and everything about him Moses wanted it to be about God but the people kept making it about him it was the desire of his heart to get the people a relationship with God but no they didn't want God they wanted a man there so that they wouldn't have to have that relationship because there was too much at stake go go down Through the Ages and you see David is a man after God's Own Heart the Bible says very very special just tremendous human being and David one day he was in his Palace Maybe I know he was thinking about the Ark of the Covenant the Tabernacle of the Lord that Moses himself had made many many decades earlier David's thinking about that maybe he was thinking about how that the presence of God would come down how I how I just said that Moses got to see him Moses got to be with him and it changed his whole face and think about David maybe thinking on this Lord your presence and this Tabernacle of the Lord and inside the Tabernacle there was this big thick curtain that covered the whole back of the church there and inside that curtain in this little room was a place for the Ark of the Covenant what and once a year the high priest would go into that place behind that thick curtain it's called The Veil behind there and get next to this Ark this little tiny room once a year in the presence of God would come down into that room just once a year you think about oh Lord I would love to have I would love to be able to do that it was only one man that got to be in that presence only the hyper East David Maybe he looks out the window of his Palace this big beautiful palace that Davis had David has and he looks doesn't say this but maybe maybe he did maybe he could see this Tabernacle and the importance of it and The Mercy Seat and what was behind those curtains and he looks and he says he says look at this is the Ark of the Covenant this is where God makes himself known he says and look it's in a tent he says here it is in this tin I have this big Palace and God's house is a tent he says look what God did for me I was a Shepherd I was a nobody and God comes and he makes me king and even says he says I'm still a nobody and look at this big place that I have and there's God's Ark in a tent behind a curtain he had it on his heart he calls Nathan the prophet he says Nathan he says let's read what he says since First Chronicles chapter 17. verse 1. it says this now it came to pass as David sat in his house that David said to Nathan the prophet lo I dwell in a house of Cedars but the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord remains under curtains and Nathan said unto David do all that is in thy heart for God is with thee so here is David and he's asking the prophet he says I want to build this house for the Lord this house for the Ark of the Covenant this place that can hold The Mercy Seat this place where God can come in like he has it through the Wilderness come into this room this place that's much nicer than a tent because look at what all I have and then the prophet says this he says do all that is in your heart David for God is with you so I always wondered well then when I was ever since I've known this story it always bothered me how could God's Prophet tell David to do something that was not God's will wondering brother Jonathan all through the years I've wondered how could that be until this week and now I understand in studying this and studying this scripture and studying this subject because it was in David's heart not to build the temple it was in David's heart to please God it was in David's heart to to glorify God that's how Nathan in and tell him wrong Nathan knew his heart he was a man David was a man after God's Own Heart so Nathan says do what's in your heart David because God's with you and David did do what was in his heart and it came to pass that same night that the word of the Lord came to Nathan saying go and tell my servant David my servant thus saith the Lord Thou shalt not be build me a house to dwell in contradict with what he just said the prophet told him do what is in your heart and that's what our hearts should be whatever it takes to please God David what a wonderful man so then so then David after he's told that David didn't complain David said praise the Lord I'm so happy we have word from the Lord and he said basically he says what can I do how can I help Nathan says we are going to build this Temple this Temple isn't going to move around anymore it's going to be in one place and we're gonna this Temple is going to be built David could have built the temple he was he was the king greatest King that ever lived had a whole Kingdom very smart very able to do all of these things and yet the prophet says no not you and then David humbles himself and says what can I do Prophet tells him your son from your family will build it and it's not even going to build be built until after you die David says praise the Lord praise the Lord and then he goes and he prays I don't have time to read it but he prays this beautiful prayer before the Lord saying Lord Ivan I'm a nothing I came from nothing I'm I'm a I'm a poor Shepherd and you've done all this for me blessed be the name of the Lord Lord you're so great look at his attitude whatever I can do to help anything and that was the king anything I can do to help so God gave because of his David's attitude God gave him a role in this David Drew up the plans for the temple David even had the stones God David stored up the gold David had everything ready and he got to have a part but he didn't get all the glory because he shouldn't get the glory anyways it should come from God so then Solomon builds it later on he tells Solomon he says God told me why I can't build the temple he said that I've shed blood abundantly and made great Wars and I've done things that maybe my hands are dirty but you God told me that you Solomon will build this and you're going to have a father that's much greater than me look at the humility of David again he said God said that he is going to be your father and you are going to be his son and David was was rejoicing over this how happy was he that now David you're not even important as a dad anymore but look at the attitude of David saying how much how much he blessed God and please God even though all the mistakes and all the failures and we know so many of them we know the few that are written down all the failures that he did yet he pleased God so much because of that attitude Lord I love you and I'm going to put you first in everything think about what a beautiful beautiful story with David in the temple and then the temple got built and God came down just like he did with the Tabernacle in the wilderness he came down the same thing when Solomon dedicated it we call it Solomon's Temple today but I wonder is that right to call it that David was the one David was the one that had it on his heart and he he was blessed by it you know he doesn't see David building great statues to himself like like we see all the all the kings in the in the Pharaohs and all of that David wanted to build something from the law for the Lord to let him let his message go on not about David and I think about our lord Jesus the son of David with all of David's failures yet how great of a man David was how wonderful of a man that this man was how humble I read that in in second Samuel and in first Chronicles how David prayed and he said I'm a nothing Lord I am nothing of sinned I've done all these things wrong you took me from the Sheep coat you took me from taking care of my father's sheep and you made me a great man but it's all because of you I think about our Lord Jesus he had prophesied many times he said that no man can come to the father except by me he said unless I go away the comforter won't come to you he said unless I be lifted up and draw a men to me I lift it up on the cross and die Jesus knew what was coming he knew that he was going to die a sinner's death and then he comes to the Garden of Gethsemane bows down on his knees weeping and upset and knowing what's about to happen knowing probably that before this time tomorrow he was going to be in the grave crucified horrible Sinner's death and here's the 33 year old young man on his knees saying Lord I know what's coming but would you let this cup pass from me there's the flesh God made flesh and there's Jesus and he's he's just upset and he knows what's going to happen but that relationship with Christ and the father was so perfect and so close he knew exactly what God's will was and it was everything to him and he was our example he knew that he was to go to the Cross he knew that he was going to live this Life of Agony he knew what was going to happen and he gets there and he says Lord let this cup pass from me but he knew and that's why he said but thy will be done and then he went as obedient son to the cross thinking how he had that relationship with the father how Moses had that relationship with God how David had that relationship with God and we see all these Servants of the Lord then we see that Spirit come in on the with the disciples in the book of Acts and how they had that relationship with God and people would see them and they would ask for prayer just like with brother Lionel and God would God would take care of it he would answer those prayers and I look at us and how I want that relationship with God just think about up on the mountain Moses is there God's up there and I Say No Moses you go ahead I don't want to live that life I don't care as much I'll just let you do all my work for me I'll stay here and then Moses is gone for 40 years and all of a sudden you fall right into sin 40 days I'm sorry fall right into sin like that because that was in their heart and what is in our heart today do we truly want to serve God whatever it takes Lord I want to be there I want to have that relationship with you or do you just come to church just come to church once a week and say oh well you know it's a good sermon today really made me think that doesn't matter what matters is that you know him doesn't matter who's in the Pulpit it doesn't matter what prophet was there doesn't matter how great of a man or a woman your mom or your dad were was are what matters is that you know him and Moses it was everything to him he was all excited come meet him come we we can we can we can meet him and then what No Moses you go ahead we quote that scripture so much because it's true but let me tell you it was a bad thing that happened on that day and God separated himself from mankind and yet the sweetness of God he says I promised it to you you go ahead go ahead into this Promised Land just go over Jordan I'll send an angel and and one angel I mean what could he do conquers everybody said he says there won't be any enemies or anything you can go there I'll kill them all with my angel will kill them all but I'm not going to go Moses said uh-uh no no no no if you're not going we're not going where would you have been what decision would you have made in that day you can have everything you can go to church they have great church have a feel-good sermon you can you can have wealth you can have a good job you can have whatever you can have a good retirement you can have whatever you want but I'm not there you could have miracles you think the angel wouldn't have performed Miracles he would have you can have all of this but you won't have a relationship with me how many fall into that category how many in the room today fall into that category do we spend time do we spend the time that Moses did seeking God Jesus himself says he prayed all night before he even chose his disciples the son of God but do we do I have that relationship am I willing to give whatever it takes to have that relationship with God Jesus says in John chapter 8 Jesus says I always do that which pleases my father what a what a statement a I think about that statement all the time I always do that which pleases my father Jesus was a virgin-born Son of God he was perfect he never made a mistake he never sinned we are much different than that but we can have that same attitude where I always want to do that which pleases my father and how many times we fail we make mistakes look at Peter I've been talking this week a number of people a few have talked to me and said I've made a mistake and I feel bad I feel embarrassed for it or they say that I have I have a decision to make and I need to make the right decision and I think I look at Peter and I think about the embarrassment if we make a mistake and we all do and we all think everybody's looking at us imagine Peter's mistakes Peter made him and it wasn't just his friends that found out about him it was 2 000 years of Bible readers know every single one of Peter's mistakes well you're talking about being embarrassed Peter made all these mistakes person after person preacher after preacher Bible reader after Bible reader has looked at this like wow Peter really messed up right there yet Peter was willing to always repent he was willing to always make things right and I thank God that these mistakes are recorded from these Great Men of God because I look at myself it's like yeah Peter made that one I've made a lot worse but there has to be the musicians can come and we'll close there has to be a relationship there has to be that we talk with God we want to be closer to him and when we are making these decisions and many of us are up against a decision right now don't think Lord how will this benefit me get on your knees and pray and say Lord I need this or I want this maybe we should get on our knees and say Lord what do you want what will benefit you how can I serve you because that is what we need that's the same that Moses had to say that David had the same that Jesus had Lord what can I say that will further your kingdom and your will that's a true relationship with God and it's not so much Lord I need this and I need that and and I need help here because it's not about me it's not about us God has made this whole book everything has been about us taking care of us healing us giving us joy he's making he's made everything about us if we have his same Holy Spirit maybe we should start making it about him amen do you believe that when you're making a decision when you're doing everything in our lives make it about him go up on that mountain as Moses did go up there saying Lord I want to talk with you I want to see you that is the holy spirit operating in a person it's not saying well I'll get this brother and we should pray for each other prophets ask for prayer for each other but when we're making a decision Lord what do you want me to do what would please you I love that scripture so much how David looked out and he saw this tent and he saw the Ark of the Covenant in there he saw that God comes in there once a year with the high priest he saw it and he says Lord [Music] I want to build you a house it's for you and Nathan says do all that's in your heart and he did do what was in his heart thinking about that that thick curtain I was there and how that the holy of holies back there God would come in back there and he would just have that one high priest and his presence would be made known behind that curtain then Jesus we see him at the Garden of the Gethsemane the next day he goes in he's crucified there was an earthquake in Jerusalem that same curtain that was now in that Temple that curtain was ripped from the bottom to the top no more no more do you have to go through a mediator there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus that curtain was up there it was ripped into and now before to go inside that curtain was death now if you don't go to that place if you don't meet that same Jehovah God it's death what a wonderful thing that Jesus did for us made it to where we can go straight to God they made that mistake in Exodus but now it's different now we can't go straight to God if we want that relationship we have to have it friends It's gotta be let's stand do you want the relationship with God raise your hand if you want it foreign and I can promise you this you know in the scriptures that I've I've read here God wants that relationship more with you than you want it with him he's got feelings he's got a sweetness to him he loves us and however many times we put him off no you you might be driving to work and it's like well I prayed today I I said Lord take me to take me safely today I prayed today I I asked him Lord help me with this Lord help me with that that's not worship that's just asking him for something and he gives and I know he gives but maybe do you think that we could go before him and ask him Lord what do you want to say Moses did if you're not there I'm not going Lord what do you want [Music] ask him that let's bow our heads in the quietness of the room this morning listening to the piano play and instruments [Music] you talk to him you ask him Lord what do you want [Music] Lord Jesus what do you want what do you want from us Lord how can I serve you you've served me my whole life you've given me life you've healed healed me when I was sick you've given me a home you give me a place to live you give me a church to go to now Lord what can I do for you not for me as David prayed before you Lord so we we pray to you Lord you've taken us you've protected us we want to serve you Lord and we want to make this Temple that we call our body we want to make it a temple of worship to you Lord give you our lives [Music] lord it's a hard thing to say [Music] but I want to say Lord that whatever it takes whatever it takes
