[14:29] is
[14:30] simple we had a brother one time not
[14:34] here but the other Church come up to
[14:37] speak and it was a youth service and
[14:40] they were giving all of us a chance to
[14:41] speak it was his turn so he got up opens
[14:45] his Bible as notes and he begins to
[14:48] minister and for five minutes he did
[14:53] good I think you know the rest of the
[14:55] story now but he got lost in his notes
[14:59] and he literally stood there for about 5
[15:01] minutes without saying a word and one of
[15:04] the deacons came up closed his Bible got
[15:06] his notes and walked him out the
[15:08] door so I was hoping that wasn't about
[15:11] to
[15:13] happen but appreciate the goodness of
[15:16] God don't you he deserves the glory amen
[15:20] we have a couple of song specials so
[15:24] brother Josiah and sister

[15:53] thing if if you're doing something that
[15:55] that you feel God has placed in your
[15:57] heart there's a a battle a constant
[16:00] battle to be able to get up here and
[16:02] deliver it because Satan knows lives are
[16:06] going to get changed he's going to get
[16:09] exposed and he battles it but I believe

[31:08] Martin comes to the to the uh platform I
[31:12] want to share a
[31:13] testimony 6 eight months ago I don't
[31:16] remember how long it
[31:18] was we had a service it was an evening
[31:21] service I was I believe it was a
[31:23] Wednesday or Sunday I can't remember
[31:25] which one it was but it was an evening
[31:26] service
[31:27] and uh a man stumbled in here he was
[31:31] [Music]
[31:32] um Wayward off in his directional life
[31:37] and um wanting to uh wanting to get into
[31:43] rehab and we had our
[31:45] service and the spirit was here in the
[31:49] evening and I remember it was really
[31:51] strong many of you are here I called up
[31:53] brother Lionel Salazar and uh brother
[31:56] Paul m Murray came up and a lot of
[31:58] brothers came up and they prayed with a
[31:59] brother and and the brother stayed and
[32:03] he was weeping and and just praising the
[32:06] Lord and he made this statement to me he
[32:08] says brother he says he says i' want to
[32:11] go to church every day in this church he
[32:13] said he said this is just a special
[32:15] place and and as he was before he said
[32:20] that he was praying and he was uh sister
[32:22] Katie is about in a row that you are
[32:23] maybe one row
[32:25] forward and he was down on his knees
[32:27] between the pews and I came up from
[32:31] behind
[32:32] him and he was thanking the lord and he
[32:36] said these words he said Lord fill up
[32:38] these
[32:40] pews and he was talking about how how
[32:43] thankful he was for the
[32:45] church and um then after that I gave the
[32:50] testimony we
[32:52] had within a within two weeks it was we
[32:56] had six 00 people in this little church
[33:00] well it's a big church but in in in this
[33:02] church there were 600 people there were
[33:05] so many people up in the in the upper um
[33:08] balcony up there that the that the pews
[33:11] broke and and and there was just there's
[33:14] people lined up we have chairs in the in
[33:16] the highways and I thought you
[33:18] know that one brother that came in here
[33:22] that night I believe it was the Lord
[33:25] speaking to him he didn't I was there he
[33:28] was knelt down between the
[33:30] pews and prayed that and I witnessed it
[33:35] and the Lord did it I believe as i' talk
[33:38] been talking about prayer over the past
[33:40] month and how when we enter into praying
[33:44] that we don't even know it's us when we
[33:46] really enter enter into that spirit and
[33:49] it just becomes a holy spirit then
[33:51] speaking through us as we go before the
[33:54] Lord and as we pray and
[33:58] then the
[33:59] brother he uh didn't see him for a long
[34:04] time and
[34:06] uh God bless you brother
[34:08] Felton raise your hand here he
[34:14] [Applause]
[34:15] is he was gone for a while he went up to

[34:21] with us for for a little while here at
[34:22] the Tabernacle brother Felton you're
[34:24] always welcome God bless you my friend
[34:29] and I I really appreciated the the
[34:31] sincerity of his prayer and when I
[34:34] walked up so often we spend most of our
[34:37] time praying for
[34:39] ourselves but this brother he was in
[34:41] Dire Straits he he needed something in
[34:45] life but he was taking his time in that
[34:49] Pew and he was praying for all of us and
[34:52] brother Felton we over twice the size
[34:54] now that is when you prayed that prayer

[35:07] evening we have the honor tonight of
[35:10] hearing from a true missionary I've been
[35:13] overseas many times
[35:16] and I've uh I've never done missionary
[35:21] work what I've done is is gone over and
[35:24] and do the business and make sure that
[35:27] uh the offices or or the the recipients
[35:30] were getting their information getting
[35:32] their material but someone who really
[35:35] goes overseas and really
[35:38] sleeps in the places that you wouldn't
[35:41] want to sleep and goes to the places
[35:43] that you wouldn't want to go that's a
[35:46] true missionary so Brother Martin Warner

[36:30] singing will
[36:31] do uh I was glad brother Aaron sang that
[36:35] Amazing Grace it was on my heart to sing
[36:38] it tonight so you sang it and uh I just
[36:43] you know some songs like that when you
[36:47] realize the inspiration behind them that
[36:51] I think it was was it John Newton that
[36:53] wrote that song John Newton and and he
[36:56] was a he was a slave trader and he was
[37:01] on a ship in a
[37:03] storm and God got a hold of
[37:06] him and uh he gave his heart to the Lord
[37:09] and he said oh the grace that saved a
[37:12] Wretch like Me and then he for the rest
[37:16] of his life he fought against slavery
[37:19] and he abolished it in the UK amen so
[37:23] those Inspirations come from from Deep
[37:26] deep
[37:28] spiritual uh
[37:30] experiences amen that we we sing them
[37:32] and we don't
[37:34] realize uh what's behind them but uh I'm
[37:38] I'm glad you're saying that tonight uh I
[37:41] want to just get into the word tonight
[37:42] right away let's take our Bibles uh to
[37:46] um turn to
[37:48] Ephesians I greet you all in the name of
[37:51] the Lord Jesus
[37:53] Christ amen and uh bring your greetings
[37:56] again uh like I said Wednesday from
[37:59] Canada the different churches there
[38:01] maybe there's there's some new faces
[38:03] here I haven't seen before so uh I don't
[38:08] I don't think I need to say a lot I just
[38:12] uh about myself I do Mission work
[38:15] overseas and uh I've been doing Mission
[38:18] work probably for about 30 years or more

[38:25] eskimos and with the Indians uh up in
[38:28] the northern tribes of of Canada and uh
[38:33] right down into the jungles of the Congo
[38:37] so uh God has God has been gracious to
[38:41] allow me I've was privileged to do that
[38:45] amen he saved a Wretch like
[38:49] Me you know to to allow me to do
[38:52] something for him that is a privilege
[38:55] and and uh it's a privilege to address
[38:57] you tonight it's a privilege to be in
[38:59] Tucson uh we had a lot of Trials we have
[39:03] a lot of hindrances coming and we had a
[39:06] lot of storms we came through on the
[39:08] roads and different things you know it
[39:11] just seemed the enemy was trying to
[39:12] hinder us so I know there's something
[39:15] good is going to happen amen you know I
[39:18] I tell the brother sometimes I get the
[39:20] feeling that that Satan doesn't like
[39:24] me you ever get that feeling
[39:27] you know he's just throwing everything
[39:29] in your way I get this feeling amen so
[39:33] he he doesn't like it like brother a
[39:35] said he he knows he's going to be
[39:38] exposed amen so let's let's just uh go

[44:32] Ephesians a couple places I want to read
[44:35] Ephesians
[44:37] 4:11 and he gave some Apostles and some
[44:40] prophets and some evangelists and some
[44:42] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[44:45] and we know that word there means
[44:47] maturing right we're perfect by his
[44:52] sacrifice we're perfect by the life that
[44:55] was shed on the blood but the maturing
[44:59] comes through the gifts in the church
[45:02] for the perfecting of the maturing of
[45:04] the Saints for the work of the ministry
[45:06] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[45:08] till we all come in the unity of the
[45:10] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[45:12] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[45:14] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[45:16] that we hence henceforth be no more
[45:19] children tossed to and fro and carried
[45:21] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[45:23] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[45:26] whereby they lie and wait to deceived
[45:28] now watch this last verse but speaking

[46:04] believe it is let's go to Revelations
[46:07] chapter 2 I'm sorry verse one
[46:10] Revelations 2 verse one and unto the
[46:13] angel of the Church of Ephesus write
[46:15] these things saith he that holdeth the
[46:17] Seven Stars in his right hand and and
[46:20] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[46:22] candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy
[46:25] labor and thy patience and how thou
[46:27] canot bear them which are evil and thou
[46:31] Hast tried them which say they are
[46:35] Apostles and are not and has found them
[46:40] Liars amen Satan is a liar how do you
[46:44] know when he's lying when he opens his
[46:47] mouth right here he whispers in your ear
[46:50] that's when you know it's not the word
[46:53] you know it's him he's lying one more
[46:56] scriptures in Psalms uh chapter
[47:01] 116 this is a a scripture that's dear to
[47:04] my heart in the last in the last few
[47:06] months of of
[47:09] Trials um David speaking here in the
[47:12] spirit how many know the prophet said
[47:15] the Psalms were
[47:17] inspired you know he also said that the
[47:20] Psalms are
[47:23] prophecy singing is prophecy you are
[47:28] prophesying and then someone will get a
[47:30] hold of that and be
[47:32] inspired amen and it can deliver
[47:35] someone my it's amazing so I verse n of

[47:57] call upon his the name of the Lord I
[47:59] will pay my vows unto the Lord now in
[48:02] the presence of all his
[48:03] people precious in the sight of the Lord
[48:06] is the death of his
[48:08] Saints we heard that this morning didn't

[48:13] glorious wonderful time Heaven's
[48:17] receiving them we're we
[48:19] sorrow we sorrow but not like
[48:23] others oh Lord truly I am am thy servant
[48:26] I am thy servant and the son of thy
[48:28] handmate thou Hast loosed my bonds I
[48:31] will offer to thee the sacrifice of

[48:42] and in the midst of the old Jerusalem
[48:44] praise ye the Lord you may be seated may
[48:47] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[48:49] of his word amen um I want to put that
[48:53] PowerPoint up I just want to those
[48:55] scriptures I'd like to tie them into
[48:57] this uh
[49:01] report and it'll be a little different
[49:05] report I'm not speaking I was thinking
[49:06] about speaking on Mosen Beek and the
[49:09] flood relief there that we did for the
[49:12] Believers they still really haven't
[49:14] recovered in some areas and I know that
[49:17] different churches have helped and voice
[49:20] of God has helped different ones have
[49:21] helped but you know that the impact of
[49:23] those things is years they don't recover
[49:27] like we would recover have the
[49:29] government come in and build you houses
[49:31] and things like that but anyway I just
[49:33] felt led to go this
[49:35] way uh to uh Europe when I was I was
[49:40] there in Europe in July and August and
[49:43] uh I was doing some some camps there and
[49:47] uh it turned out I you know I realized
[49:50] that what the prophet said was true that
[49:53] he said
[49:54] America needs missionaries yes wow
[49:57] that's the truth America I mean I'm over
[50:00] there I see the supernatural I see see
[50:03] the faith of the people I see error but
[50:06] I also see the faith that they have and
[50:10] the Simplicity they have to manifest the
[50:13] word and I think you know we are we are
[50:16] the ones that need missionaries amen and
[50:19] a missionary is the New Testament the
[50:22] prophet said it's it's really scriptural
[50:24] it's apostle
[50:26] he said denomination changed it to
[50:28] missionary he said but it's really
[50:31] Apostle and Apostle is someone that's
[50:34] sent that's sent and he said to set in
[50:38] order and I think you know sometimes we
[50:41] need that here and I and I think
[50:44] sometimes churches are afraid of
[50:46] that churches are afraid of that and I
[50:50] and I couldn't figure out why but on
[50:52] this last mission trip it just seemed to
[50:55] all conal together where we're
[50:58] at we need all the
[51:02] ministry we need them all and the pastor
[51:05] you know the story the short stubby one
[51:09] the strong one he can work with all the
[51:12] rest right but you know it we need them
[51:17] all and so tonight I'll try to get into
[51:19] this and we'll try to get through this
[51:21] power point real quick this Eagle is
[51:23] there because he's my friend
[51:26] and I go to a special place on the river
[51:29] to pray in in Edmonton and it's a secret
[51:31] little place and he sits there all the
[51:34] time every time I'm there mostly he's
[51:37] there but now he's now he flew self like
[51:40] me he's a real he's a real Snowbird is
[51:43] he yeah he's a real Snowbird but he is
[51:47] massive he he is massive I don't know if
[51:49] you can see his claws but when his wings
[51:52] go up man I just like wow he is one
[51:56] massive eagle and uh you know the Lord
[51:59] the Lord I I used him as a fleece to
[52:01] come down here and he answered my fleece
[52:05] so he's precious to me he may be around
[52:08] here
[52:09] somewhere amen uh I don't know if I
[52:12] should use the
[52:14] pointer
[52:16] um can you do it yeah why don't you do
[52:20] it brother go ahead uh we were in U in
[52:23] July August we were in C in Berlin
[52:26] Germany and uh had some a lot of
[52:30] churches come together there and I took
[52:33] three of those meetings in Germany and
[52:36] we had a wonderful time it seemed like
[52:38] that the Lord spoke to the Y the youth
[52:42] and I don't know why because I was never
[52:44] a
[52:45] youth guy I was never a youth pastor or
[52:48] youth oriented but it just seemed like
[52:51] the youth were reaching out and that's a
[52:54] wonderful thing
[52:55] you know in mission mission work to see
[52:57] the youth coming up the new
[53:00] generation amen they're the ones that
[53:01] are going to carry this gospel amen and
[53:04] and to see their hunger and their thirst
[53:08] and I preached on a few things like that
[53:10] were a little controversial like
[53:13] music and and uh a little bit of church
[53:17] order things like that and it just
[53:18] Stires everything up and man do you ever
[53:21] get bombarded with questions after that
[53:24] you know and what is right what is wrong
[53:27] and you know I always deflect brother
[53:29] Daniel to the
[53:31] pastor because I say you know ultimately
[53:34] it's the pastor's responsibility I'll go
[53:37] out and say something it'll create a lot
[53:40] of stir and questions and people start
[53:42] searching the message they start
[53:45] searching the word and that's good amen
[53:48] But ultimately it is the pastor's
[53:50] responsibility so a few of those things
[53:53] came up and we had a good time uh
[53:55] regardless I enjoyed those meetings I
[53:58] shared them with brother yasik wallik
[54:00] from Poland and uh he took he took the
[54:04] last three I took the first three and
[54:06] then I I was supposed to go to Slovakia
[54:08] after that next slide uh these are young
[54:11] people in in Berlin just on a day outing
[54:14] we had uh next
[54:18] slide yeah so we went from there to the
[54:21] the Slovakia there was another Camp
[54:24] there just back to back and I expected
[54:26] to take one or two Services brother
[54:29] Daniel and uh I was prepared for that
[54:32] because I just came through these
[54:33] meetings in Berlin and uh so it's a
[54:36] beautiful place and the camp was just
[54:39] just a wonderful old very old but you
[54:42] know and and outdated the building but
[54:45] you know it's nothing for a missionary
[54:48] you know there was no bed
[54:50] bugs there was no rats running above you
[54:53] in the room there was no rats hats there
[54:55] was no mice there was no bed bugs praise
[54:58] the
[54:59] Lord amen this is the this is a five
[55:02] star they said it was only a one star
[55:05] but I I thought it was a five star
[55:08] anyway uh next
[55:10] slide yeah it was nestled in this little
[55:14] area here in Slovakia and we had a camp
[55:17] there and there was quite a few came
[55:19] together there in that
[55:22] camp and we uh you know I I I asked him
[55:27] I saidwell you know I was getting tired
[55:29] and I asked him well you know you got
[55:30] some brothers here and he' he'd have
[55:33] them get up before the service and say a
[55:35] few things the ministers but he he said
[55:38] you know brother martin as the first
[55:40] weekend I took the weekend and he said
[55:42] what you've been preaching and it's been
[55:44] really zoning in on a lot of different
[55:46] things here that you don't know anything
[55:49] about a lot of different uh doctrines
[55:52] and Revelations and you know special
[55:56] things that I didn't know anything about
[55:59] but the Holy Spirit was hitting them and
[56:02] he said would you
[56:03] continue well I had limped I had brother
[56:07] Aon I had literally limped to to to
[56:10] these
[56:11] meetings I I fought through the pain and
[56:14] I limp to Europe and I limped they had
[56:16] be climbing these
[56:19] mountains and I said Brothers you don't
[56:21] know like we're just going to go on a
[56:23] day outing we'll drive this hill and
[56:26] yeah you got to walk another mile and a
[56:27] half up to the top to get the view right
[56:30] so wow it was something but uh you know
[56:35] all in all it just seemed like that's
[56:37] the way it went so I had to take I had
[56:40] to I took all of the meetings for the
[56:44] whole week there was five or so meetings
[56:46] five days and uh so by the time that was
[56:50] done I was
[56:53] spent and you know it it just seemed
[56:56] like something came through to me that
[57:00] you know there was a lot of these things
[57:03] uh like I said you know the Paul said
[57:05] one has a Doctrine one has a Psalm one
[57:08] has a revelation one has this one has
[57:10] that and all these special interests you
[57:13] know and I thought what are we
[57:16] reflecting you know in in message
[57:19] churches what are we reflecting are we
[57:21] reflecting our our own
[57:23] Doctrine we go to seed on one Doctrine
[57:26] and if you know like I I I touched on
[57:29] the millennial Doctrine and I said you
[57:32] know just I wasn't thinking about it
[57:34] very much but I said you know people
[57:35] think we're in the Millennium right now
[57:38] and uh I've heard that preached in
[57:41] message circles and I think you got to
[57:43] come to with me to
[57:45] Africa you got to come and get that Lion
[57:48] in your face that lion that's right
[57:52] there you know and and and just feel the
[57:55] Roar of that lion and your blood just
[58:00] thickens it just you wouldn't feel a
[58:02] thing if they if they caught you you
[58:05] wouldn't feel a thing you're you're
[58:08] paralyzed before that even gets to you
[58:12] like before he even gets to you so uh I
[58:14] said they got to come to Africa because
[58:17] if we're in the Millennium where's my
[58:21] Rapture you know and I just kind of just
[58:23] hit on a few things like that and boy
[58:26] you could just feel
[58:27] it you know you could feel it and and
[58:30] you you're just running into that that
[58:33] kind of that uneasiness under the under
[58:35] the current thing that you don't know
[58:37] why and you're fighting things and you
[58:39] don't know why and and then later you
[58:42] realize what it was so that's part I'm
[58:45] saying that because it's part of mission
[58:48] work you know Mission work is not just
[58:51] it's not just handing out
[58:53] books or printing ing books or sending
[58:57] CDs or you know I I had a brother one
[59:00] time he was talking about that and he
[59:01] said you know we got this and I won't
[59:04] mention the names but we got this venue
[59:06] now and you know you won't have to have
[59:08] missionaries going to these countries
[59:10] that you just send them this and they
[59:11] got all the
[59:13] messages no he God still needs
[59:16] this he needs Flesh and
[59:19] Blood yeah that that's his program you
[59:22] can never change it amen a book won't
[59:25] take that place a tape won't take that
[59:28] place I'm for missionary work I mean I'm
[59:31] for we're printing now in Malawi the
[59:34] message in their own country and they're
[59:38] they're they're setting up now uh was
[59:40] just talking them the other day they're
[59:41] setting up uh sound booths so that they
[59:44] can overvoice like was done in the
[59:46] earlier years but they they only got a
[59:49] quarter still in Malawi it's only a
[59:51] quarter of the
[59:53] messages we got them all
[59:55] all amen we got we got them all on our
[59:59] phones right at our fingertips but they
[1:00:02] would like to hear it they would like to
[1:00:04] hear the rest of the story amen it's
[1:00:07] nice to have the whole thing isn't it so
[1:00:09] anyway uh we uh we ran into that and I
[1:00:13] thought you know what is uh maybe next
[1:00:16] slide as some young people in Slovakia
[1:00:19] next
[1:00:21] slide
[1:00:23] Slovakia uh this brother here I'll just
[1:00:25] stop there for a sec this brother in the
[1:00:27] center the tall one he was in the
[1:00:30] meetings and he' just come from the
[1:00:32] Ukraine and uh it was you know he had he
[1:00:36] had somehow got out at his age and uh
[1:00:40] you know didn't have to he was in a bad
[1:00:43] area and he was wanting to bring the
[1:00:47] message there and he asked me and these
[1:00:49] two young men also knew Ukrainian and
[1:00:52] Slovakian they could speak and English
[1:00:55] so they interpreted for me and his
[1:00:57] desire was to get the message out in
[1:01:01] Ukraine Amen to go back and get the
[1:01:03] message out in the Ukraine and go on the
[1:01:06] street and and and and witness the
[1:01:10] message and I thought wow you know what
[1:01:13] a great what a great desire for young
[1:01:15] men like this and it encourages an older
[1:01:18] man that we've been around for a long
[1:01:21] time and you see this this youth amen
[1:01:23] and this vibrancy and this fervor and
[1:01:27] you know they they they said Brother
[1:01:29] Martin just pray with us just pray with
[1:01:31] us that God will use
[1:01:33] us my I said that's easy that's easy to
[1:01:37] do I just prayed with all my heart we
[1:01:39] had a nice nice time with him and you
[1:01:41] know it comes to your mind if it comes
[1:01:43] to your mind pray for
[1:01:45] missionaries pray for people that are on
[1:01:47] the field pray for people that are
[1:01:49] risking their lives next
[1:01:51] slide uh we went to Poland after yeah it
[1:01:54] was wasn't over yet I thought it was
[1:01:55] over but then uh I did schedule a
[1:01:58] meeting with brother yasek uh in Poland
[1:02:02] in his church and uh uh you know it's
[1:02:06] funny because I found some of the same
[1:02:08] things there and not not Downing any
[1:02:11] church it's just you know there's two
[1:02:13] Spirits working in the framework of the
[1:02:16] Christian church and like brother Daniel
[1:02:19] said this morning we got to be aware
[1:02:20] there's
[1:02:21] demons there's demons and religious Dem
[1:02:24] demons and there's
[1:02:26] Angels amen so you know uh we went from
[1:02:30] there to uh next slide that's the pastor
[1:02:33] and his wife there brother Jack he's
[1:02:35] shared meetings with me in in Africa and
[1:02:37] he's doing a lot of missionary work he's
[1:02:39] doing a lot of printing English books
[1:02:41] around the continent of Africa he's
[1:02:43] helping a lot he's done a great work
[1:02:46] next slide uh this is the church we went
[1:02:49] from Brother Jack to Walla Petrova
[1:02:51] that's a small uh Village sort of small
[1:02:54] small village community um I'm not sure
[1:02:57] the direction in in Poland but it's
[1:02:59] quite a wayss it's about a 5H hour drive
[1:03:02] from Brother Jack so there's five hours
[1:03:04] there and five hours back and meetings
[1:03:06] all the time so after two camps and all
[1:03:09] those meetings you know everything was
[1:03:12] taken out the people were just pulling
[1:03:15] and you know that's what operate you
[1:03:16] operate the gift and when you get people
[1:03:19] under expectation and pulling amen God
[1:03:22] can meet needs amen God can God can do
[1:03:26] miraculous things so we saw some of that
[1:03:29] there um we were in this church that
[1:03:32] Community they're all message
[1:03:35] Believers in that community in that
[1:03:37] Village there's one Pentecostal church
[1:03:40] and they know the message very well they
[1:03:44] just don't see the message but uh you
[1:03:47] know they're all just wonderful
[1:03:48] Christians and they get along well
[1:03:51] together but the whole Community they
[1:03:53] they run uh they run cows and milk cows
[1:03:57] and stuff and you know that's how they
[1:03:59] survive and they all work on on that in
[1:04:02] that farm and it's just like it's just
[1:04:05] amazing you know they're just kind of
[1:04:08] insulated from everything else he said
[1:04:11] you know the one guy was saying that Co
[1:04:13] didn't even affect
[1:04:14] them never affected them at all it was
[1:04:17] like it never happened you know he just
[1:04:20] said some of the people that delivered
[1:04:21] stuff they stopped
[1:04:23] coming
[1:04:24] you know but they just went on as as
[1:04:26] usual they just stopped coming but uh
[1:04:30] you know it was it was real eye opener
[1:04:33] to get up there I've been my wife and I
[1:04:35] have been there before and uh you know
[1:04:38] this time was a little special this time
[1:04:40] uh next slide yeah that's uh one of the
[1:04:43] Pastors in the the new church that was
[1:04:45] just built John
[1:04:47] silik uh and and a lot of older
[1:04:50] Believers there too next
[1:04:53] slide yeah
[1:04:54] um the brother interpreting there for me
[1:04:58] uh is a young man and I think God's got
[1:05:00] a call on his life for Mission work and
[1:05:02] uh he he wants to he wants to go along
[1:05:06] to Africa too so it was a good
[1:05:09] connection next
[1:05:11] slide that's the pastor of that church
[1:05:14] brother uh snan Peter snan his wife just
[1:05:17] passed away and uh I really wanted to
[1:05:19] make it there to encourage him he's an
[1:05:21] old soldier in the gospel and uh he's a
[1:05:25] fire brand he's a
[1:05:27] fiery fiery preacher and he just even at
[1:05:31] you know in his 80s he's just he's just
[1:05:34] a fireball and I'm thinking man you know
[1:05:37] if he can do that what can I do you know
[1:05:41] I'm not that old yet so uh he encourages
[1:05:44] me I encourage him next slide yeah and
[1:05:47] these are some of the older books that
[1:05:50] they showed me that you know was were
[1:05:52] past the first message books that came
[1:05:53] in into Poland and and German some in
[1:05:56] Germany were handwritten out and then
[1:05:58] they they' pass them to someone else and
[1:06:00] someone else would read them and they'
[1:06:02] you know Mark it up and then someone
[1:06:03] else would read it and it was passed
[1:06:05] around and we got them all on the
[1:06:07] phone and that was so precious to them
[1:06:10] one message book was so precious to them
[1:06:13] to read so we I think we take it for
[1:06:16] granted and we're all guilty I'm guilty
[1:06:19] I get back home and I I I get in the
[1:06:21] swing of things again and I just
[1:06:23] sometimes just for get so that's why you
[1:06:25] have to continue to get out there so you
[1:06:28] don't lose that burden amen and I think
[1:06:31] uh yeah that's another one there they
[1:06:33] were showing me in their language and
[1:06:36] really
[1:06:37] inspiring um I think that's that's
[1:06:41] that's we'll just stop there for a
[1:06:42] second I just wanted
[1:06:44] to comment now is that slide
[1:06:47] 16 yeah thanks brother Jeremy so we find
[1:06:51] you know the many doctrines Revelations
[1:06:54] like I said just things that you know
[1:06:57] don't some of them don't really
[1:07:00] matter you know like uh one church was a
[1:07:03] vaccine Church another church was a
[1:07:06] non-vaccine church so and in the message
[1:07:10] and one Church well that's the mark of
[1:07:12] the
[1:07:13] beast no the mark of the beast the
[1:07:15] prophet said is to reject the Seal of
[1:07:18] God the Holy Ghost that's the mark of
[1:07:20] the beast it's not a
[1:07:22] vaccine amen but you know know you got
[1:07:24] to go between them and you got to stand
[1:07:27] in the Gap and you got to be all things
[1:07:29] to all men sometimes and you know even
[1:07:31] if they don't listen to you you still
[1:07:33] got to love them you still got to love
[1:07:36] them and pray for them and be and show
[1:07:38] brotherly
[1:07:39] kindness amen so that's that's that's
[1:07:43] that's the part of a a missionary and uh
[1:07:46] you know I wouldn't trade what God's
[1:07:49] having me to do for for a pastor's job I
[1:07:53] would and trade it for the world no I it
[1:07:56] just go you're built a certain way that
[1:07:59] you can stand in in between and a pastor
[1:08:02] is built that he can take the burdens of
[1:08:04] the people and have the patience and I
[1:08:07] don't have the
[1:08:09] patience I'm F I'm just a fiery you know
[1:08:12] I'm just uh brother brother Ernie knows
[1:08:16] yeah you just asked brother Ernie you
[1:08:18] know it just sometimes it just doesn't
[1:08:20] come out
[1:08:22] nice it doesn't come out gentle and uh
[1:08:26] it just how God anoints you right
[1:08:28] because like I was telling brother AR
[1:08:29] this is my favorite thing you know Jesus
[1:08:33] we want to be like Jesus we want to act
[1:08:35] like Jesus but sometimes Jesus one time
[1:08:38] the prophet said he had compassion and
[1:08:41] he and he and he braided a
[1:08:43] whip yeah he braided a whip and he said
[1:08:47] and the prophet said he took the part of
[1:08:48] a deacon and he was just quietly
[1:08:52] braiding that Whip and all of a sudden
[1:08:55] Wham he just whipped those people out of
[1:08:58] the temple that were making the house of
[1:09:01] God a house of
[1:09:03] merchandise amen he he he played the
[1:09:06] part of a deacon and I I would have like
[1:09:10] to see that
[1:09:11] fight I would have like to see that day
[1:09:15] when he did that go get him boy sick him
[1:09:20] amen you know I just thought wow there's
[1:09:23] gentle Jesus with a whip in his
[1:09:25] hand
[1:09:27] sometimes
[1:09:29] compassion it looks it can be hard hard
[1:09:32] to look at Compassion is not
[1:09:35] sympathy it's not
[1:09:37] sympathizing with our human weaknesses
[1:09:40] God didn't sympathize with Moses he gave
[1:09:43] them all the
[1:09:44] excuses but then God said no more
[1:09:47] excuses I built you for this hallelujah
[1:09:51] we're built for this age Saints we're
[1:09:54] built to overcome we're built to stand
[1:09:57] in Satan's face and call him a
[1:10:00] liar amen you heard that this morning I
[1:10:03] love that I love that kind of thing you
[1:10:06] know he's a liar and he's and he's lied
[1:10:09] long enough so you know you see all
[1:10:12] these things and whether it's you know
[1:10:14] the mark of the beast or the Millennium
[1:10:16] or Thunders or return Ministry or
[1:10:20] polygamy in the message still
[1:10:24] in
[1:10:25] Africa yeah you know I'm I'm being a
[1:10:28] little blunt but I I'm not eloquent you
[1:10:31] know and you can't be eloquent with this
[1:10:33] and brother Jack Wallock from Poland he
[1:10:36] he helped me out there in in uh some of
[1:10:39] the countries there and where that was
[1:10:40] being preached and and that influence
[1:10:43] was trying to spread itself boy did he
[1:10:46] he ever he's
[1:10:47] militant he's very militant so it he got
[1:10:50] the point across and sometimes that's
[1:10:53] what it is it's a
[1:10:55] whip you can't be
[1:10:57] gentle sometimes with those things yes
[1:10:59] there's wisdom and there's timing but
[1:11:03] you know you have to say it like it is
[1:11:06] and you're not after you're not trying
[1:11:09] to influence people and win
[1:11:11] friends in the message if you stay with
[1:11:14] the word people will people some people
[1:11:17] will be against you but you got to bring
[1:11:20] it anyhow so we are associated with all
[1:11:24] of those things uh whether we like it or
[1:11:27] not you know that's the way I look at it
[1:11:30] because you know like the prophet said
[1:11:32] to be an American you have to be
[1:11:34] associated with all that America is all
[1:11:37] of her
[1:11:38] shame slavery all of her shame all of
[1:11:42] those things that you know that were
[1:11:45] shameful or you know that we identified
[1:11:47] we're still identified with it in the
[1:11:50] message we're identified I'm still
[1:11:52] identified with these people
[1:11:54] I still want to identify with them and
[1:11:57] win them if I
[1:11:59] can amen so it doesn't mean we have to
[1:12:03] compromise amen it doesn't mean we have
[1:12:05] to compromise with it we've got the
[1:12:08] message we've got the word for the hour
[1:12:11] we've got the
[1:12:12] truth and we just look at it in the
[1:12:16] right way amen and come together and
[1:12:19] reason together see so uh we had a
[1:12:22] Minister's meeting after this
[1:12:25] Slovakia and uh in the Slovakian
[1:12:28] meetings and uh although there was
[1:12:29] different things there uh we the the
[1:12:33] pastor he took a subject on you know
[1:12:36] discouragement for ministers and pastors
[1:12:40] and there was there was quite a few
[1:12:41] pastors and ministers there we were all
[1:12:43] in a circle and we had this Minister
[1:12:45] meeting and you know he said you know
[1:12:48] what do you Brothers do and it was a
[1:12:51] really interesting topic and you know
[1:12:54] there was a lot of nice good feedback
[1:12:57] coming from each one of the ministers
[1:12:59] and in total it just the wisdom of God
[1:13:04] what one didn't have the other had what
[1:13:06] one perspective was there was another
[1:13:09] perspective and it just brought a
[1:13:11] balance in all of it and then the and
[1:13:12] then among the ministers because there
[1:13:15] they were a little bit uneasy because
[1:13:17] sometimes I whatever you know the Lord
[1:13:19] used me to step on their toes but in
[1:13:22] that Minister's meeting we all came
[1:13:26] together and it was unifying and it was
[1:13:29] just edifying and we left that place
[1:13:31] with Ling our hearts and hugging one
[1:13:33] another and praying for one another and
[1:13:37] you know that's how it should be you
[1:13:39] know love can conquer all love is the
[1:13:43] most powerful force and it's and love is
[1:13:46] bearing with someone when when they're
[1:13:49] wrong bearing with each other praying
[1:13:52] for one another when you're when you're
[1:13:53] wrong you're wrong or they're wrong so
[1:13:57] that's that's what I see in Mission work
[1:13:59] that's why I'm saying these things
[1:14:01] because we need the body of Christ to
[1:14:04] come in the unity of the faith amen
[1:14:06] speaking the truth in love grow up into
[1:14:09] him in all things it's time we grow
[1:14:12] up amen it's time we grow up in the
[1:14:15] message amen and uh we're we're into
[1:14:18] another generation like we're you're
[1:14:19] preaching here on the Book of Judges and
[1:14:22] I thought it was so timely with my with
[1:14:25] uh with my message that the Lord's been
[1:14:28] dealing with me you know and and I
[1:14:31] emphasize in these meetings that I
[1:14:34] thought the reason for all of this
[1:14:37] there's there's maybe a couple of things
[1:14:39] one is sometimes people just get out of
[1:14:43] Step they're not serpent seed they're
[1:14:46] not you know they might be off on some
[1:14:49] little thing or see something a
[1:14:50] different way and the prophet said we'll
[1:14:52] all always have
[1:14:54] that but you know uh if if we if we
[1:14:57] contend for the faith and just feed the
[1:15:00] people the word amen that will correct
[1:15:04] the error the word of the hour corrects
[1:15:06] the error of the hour that's you know
[1:15:10] it's not us judging the prophet said
[1:15:12] it's the word that
[1:15:14] judges it's not you or I judging it's
[1:15:17] the word that will
[1:15:19] judge amen so uh you know they I
[1:15:22] emphasize Iz a couple of things like
[1:15:26] sometimes you get out of
[1:15:28] Step oh boy I'd like to like to do a
[1:15:32] demonstration but I don't think I have
[1:15:33] enough time I can't see oh there
[1:15:37] somebody's smiling at me there I think
[1:15:38] it's brother Daniel come on up brother
[1:15:41] Daniel come on up I got to do this real
[1:15:44] quick just uh I gotta watch my time
[1:15:49] too
[1:15:50] uh brother Daniel I'm gonna I used to be
[1:15:53] in a military
[1:15:54] band yeah did we do this before no no
[1:15:58] okay first time for everything you're
[1:16:01] gonna preach tonight and I was going to
[1:16:03] ask
[1:16:05] Lydia you want to come up
[1:16:07] Lydia no she won't come up no all right
[1:16:10] I won't Force you but you know you're a
[1:16:12] soldier too such
[1:16:13] aydia so you know when we're in the
[1:16:16] youth par and you start off with on your
[1:16:19] left quick March left left
[1:16:23] left right left right so you're going to
[1:16:26] follow me so we're going to lift our
[1:16:27] left leg first yeah okay let's go up
[1:16:31] left and your let's go
[1:16:34] left left that's it left right left
[1:16:38] that's it left left left right left left
[1:16:44] left left right left left left left
[1:16:50] right left okay that he did pretty good
[1:16:54] didn't
[1:16:56] he so we're going to try it again now
[1:16:59] and I'm going to get out a step this
[1:17:00] time so we'll start with left right left
[1:17:03] okay left left left right left left left
[1:17:10] left right left see I'm at of Step left
[1:17:13] left he's not out of Step but I'm at of
[1:17:16] Step but sometimes we think the other
[1:17:19] guy's at a step when we're at a step
[1:17:22] it's not about us amen so we got to
[1:17:25] learn this lesson see he's still in step
[1:17:28] now all I have to do to get back in step
[1:17:30] is take another step see now I'm back in
[1:17:33] step and that's what you learn you just
[1:17:36] take that little step thank you
[1:17:40] brother you just take that little step
[1:17:44] you know I'm I'm I'm you know I'm
[1:17:47] sorry I I was wrong forgive me that's
[1:17:51] just a little step yeah but it's so hard
[1:17:54] for us to change to say our thinking the
[1:17:59] way we were brought up like we heard is
[1:18:01] wrong or it it wasn't quite right amen
[1:18:05] so that's that's what you know I think
[1:18:08] that
[1:18:09] encouragement to get back in step when I
[1:18:12] was in that youth band I remember I was
[1:18:14] the shortest guy in my line I played the
[1:18:17] you know I played the symbols I was so
[1:18:19] musically talented
[1:18:21] brother I'll hold that uh They promoted
[1:18:25] me from the symbols to the
[1:18:29] flag and then from the flag to the front
[1:18:33] man and they gave me a golden
[1:18:36] hat what a what a I got and and we made
[1:18:39] a
[1:18:40] record I made a record with holding the
[1:18:45] flag anyway I learned something there we
[1:18:48] learned things in our youth that we
[1:18:51] don't think we're going to use down the
[1:18:53] road but every experience we have is for
[1:18:56] a reason God allows you to go through
[1:18:58] these things God allows you to be
[1:19:00] rejected at school among friends things
[1:19:04] that happen to you God allows that
[1:19:06] because he's going to use that down the
[1:19:08] road he's going to use that for Christ
[1:19:12] all the all the hard things all the bad
[1:19:15] things that happen so you know I in my
[1:19:18] in my line I had to keep I had to keep
[1:19:21] the line straight so I'd yell them get
[1:19:23] in line stay in line you know and I put
[1:19:27] my arm out on practice we we could put
[1:19:29] our arm out you couldn't e it on on on
[1:19:31] the parades but you could put it in
[1:19:33] practice you get stay in line you're at
[1:19:36] a step get back and step and that's all
[1:19:39] it is sometimes yes am amen it's all it
[1:19:44] is and and and that goes for a church
[1:19:47] that goes for individuales amen it's
[1:19:49] just someone gets out of Step a little
[1:19:51] bit pray for them the prophet don't
[1:19:53] gossip about them don't talk about them
[1:19:56] pray for them and and be kind be kind to
[1:20:00] them do something for them amen so uh
[1:20:06] let me see now I got to watch my time I
[1:20:08] said I'd watch my time
[1:20:11] uh I have plenty okay I got a little bit
[1:20:14] more
[1:20:15] time okay six 16 time five okay I got a
[1:20:20] little bit of time I got a little bit of
[1:20:23] time and I'll just I'll just watch my
[1:20:25] wife's
[1:20:27] Expressions she's my best
[1:20:30] critic amen she's a positive one so you
[1:20:35] know Paul a preser of the Prophet said
[1:20:37] always don't judge your life by how much
[1:20:38] power you have to perform Miracles and
[1:20:41] we don't judge ourselves by how much
[1:20:43] knowledge we have of the word but always
[1:20:45] judge yourself look back and take
[1:20:46] inventory of what kind of fruit that
[1:20:49] your life is presently now
[1:20:51] bearing
[1:20:53] what am I what am I reflecting
[1:20:56] now our church our
[1:21:00] Doctrine you know what are if you're not
[1:21:02] part of us if you don't see it this way
[1:21:05] what are we
[1:21:06] reflecting are we reflecting Christ do
[1:21:10] people see Christ in US amen I told one
[1:21:14] of the brothers we were fellowshipping
[1:21:15] the brother from Haiti I think I don't
[1:21:17] know if he's here what we're talking
[1:21:18] about and I you know I said you know I
[1:21:20] emphasize you do the small thing
[1:21:23] missionary work you do the small things
[1:21:26] God will give you big
[1:21:28] things God will give you the spoken word
[1:21:31] he'll manifest that right
[1:21:35] supernaturally he'll raise the
[1:21:38] dead he'll Open the Eyes of blind
[1:21:42] people amen my lots of things but you
[1:21:47] know we don't want to do the little
[1:21:50] things the little things the the little
[1:21:53] helps the little things in the church
[1:21:55] amen so these are some of the things
[1:21:57] that I rehearse and and and just you
[1:22:01] know encourage the Brethren overseas and
[1:22:03] you know it doesn't have to be deep
[1:22:06] doctrinal
[1:22:07] things you know Paul or John the Apostle
[1:22:11] when he came back from the aisle of
[1:22:12] patmas he said Brethren love one
[1:22:16] another this is the message that you
[1:22:19] love one
[1:22:20] another in in first John he also said
[1:22:23] this is the message that God is light
[1:22:26] and in him is no Darkness at all this
[1:22:29] message is pure light not not the light
[1:22:32] of the Sun purer than that brighter than
[1:22:37] that he'll be the light in that City and
[1:22:41] the sun will be outside that's nothing
[1:22:43] compared to that light and when you get
[1:22:46] in that light all things are possible
[1:22:49] amen so we got to realize who we're
[1:22:51] reflecting
[1:22:53] and take inventory you know you were
[1:22:55] talking about uh the Book of Judges here
[1:22:59] and uh as it relates the mission work
[1:23:01] that's the time I shared with brother
[1:23:03] Daniel that's the time we're in now when
[1:23:05] Joshua had passed off the scene and all
[1:23:08] the elders that served
[1:23:11] Joshua that were under Joshua passed off
[1:23:14] the scene that's the time we're in now
[1:23:18] all those elders and the Joshua
[1:23:20] commission they're gone off the scene
[1:23:22] and now we're in approving time now we
[1:23:25] come to the Book of Judges which Joshua
[1:23:29] types
[1:23:31] Ephesians and judges types
[1:23:35] leosia when every man did what was right
[1:23:38] in his own eyes wow that's the time
[1:23:40] we're at everyone's doing what they all
[1:23:43] want to do you want to stay home from
[1:23:46] church stay home from church you don't
[1:23:48] want to go to church don't go to church
[1:23:50] do what you want to do do what feels
[1:23:51] good I'm still in the message
[1:23:55] my amen that's the time we're living in
[1:23:58] Saints that's the you know in in that
[1:23:59] interm in that delay amen and God said I
[1:24:03] want to prove
[1:24:05] you that's why he left their enemies and
[1:24:08] that's why time went on he said I'm
[1:24:10] going to prove you whether you'll stay
[1:24:12] with Joshua Joshua types the end time
[1:24:16] leader isn't that what the prophet said
[1:24:19] Joshua types the Holy Ghost are you
[1:24:22] going to stay with what the Holy Ghost
[1:24:23] gave us or are you going to take your
[1:24:25] own ideas amen amen amen you can say
[1:24:30] amen amen you know if you unless you
[1:24:32] have spiritual
[1:24:34] laryngitis or your arms are
[1:24:37] broke has anyone got broken arms
[1:24:40] today you should raise your hand you
[1:24:43] should
[1:24:45] clap amen you should clap for the Lord
[1:24:48] take those little hands and clap amen
[1:24:52] the the lord loves seeing
[1:24:54] that he loves to see you raise your hand
[1:24:57] remember the first time you raised your
[1:24:58] hand brother AR in church you remember
[1:25:02] that what a what a what a victory it was
[1:25:06] to raise your hand and say I'm praising
[1:25:10] God I'm thanking
[1:25:12] God Amen I just thought wow we forget
[1:25:15] those simple things but it takes Faith
[1:25:18] to raise your hand takes Faith to say
[1:25:21] Amen this is not a spectator
[1:25:25] sport this is a
[1:25:27] participating everyone has to
[1:25:30] participate we're not here just to sit
[1:25:32] on a church a message Pew we're here to
[1:25:36] participate to put our shoulders to the
[1:25:39] wheel and the sacrifice of lifting up
[1:25:41] our hands the sacrifice of worship amen
[1:25:45] so you know uh and you want to encourage
[1:25:47] your pastor say Amen to the
[1:25:50] Worden yeah say Amen
[1:25:53] that you know you know the story about
[1:25:54] the
[1:25:56] dog the
[1:25:58] dog you know the story about the
[1:26:00] dog the prophet said when when they're
[1:26:02] after those cool dogs he just say
[1:26:04] sick them sick them you say Amen to a
[1:26:07] preacher you're saying sick them sick
[1:26:09] them that's what I say to my little dog
[1:26:12] when he's around the rot Waters he's
[1:26:14] about this big I say sick them boots
[1:26:16] sick and he'll go up and he'll
[1:26:20] go and then look back off it's not the
[1:26:24] size of the dog in the fight it's the
[1:26:25] size of the fight in the dog that guy's
[1:26:28] got some fight in
[1:26:30] him but you know uh yeah we want to
[1:26:35] encourage the pastor encourage the
[1:26:38] ministry you know because it's an age
[1:26:40] when a time when they can get
[1:26:41] discouraged discouragement is
[1:26:44] deadly with ministers you know and and
[1:26:47] it was like that in The Minister's
[1:26:48] meeting like one brother said I just
[1:26:50] feel like quitting there's no change I
[1:26:53] pour my heart out I do everything I can
[1:26:56] there's no response and there's no
[1:26:59] change in the life now that's
[1:27:02] discouraging that can be discouraging
[1:27:04] you want to help your pastor participate
[1:27:07] in spiritual worship amen and most
[1:27:10] importantly let that word change you
[1:27:13] that you come in here and you go out of
[1:27:15] here different like we did this morning
[1:27:18] I went out different you know the
[1:27:19] preaching of the word brother Daniel it
[1:27:21] casts out Devils you don't have to lay
[1:27:24] hands on the sick or cast out
[1:27:27] Devils you can I've done it but you know
[1:27:32] preaching the word can cast out Devils
[1:27:36] of
[1:27:37] fear amen and things that holding us
[1:27:41] down holding us back praise God Amen so
[1:27:45] you know if you you want to help me say
[1:27:47] Amen because the Lord knows I need it
[1:27:51] amen Ephesians
[1:27:52] was for the perfecting of the maturity
[1:27:54] of the Saints so glad you know the
[1:27:57] brothers here it seems like there's such
[1:28:00] momentum here and I can feel it I've
[1:28:04] I've been
[1:28:04] streaming more than you know I've been
[1:28:08] streaming and i' I've been seeing the
[1:28:10] momentum building and I think this
[1:28:13] church is just right for a powerful
[1:28:17] Revival a sweep of the Holy
[1:28:20] Ghost the fire of God Amen that you'll
[1:28:24] see lives transformed and people on fire
[1:28:28] I mean on fire and setting other people
[1:28:31] on
[1:28:31] fire Hallelujah man I think the last
[1:28:35] time we were here we were preaching and
[1:28:37] this young sister came to me my wife
[1:28:39] afterwards and she said you know it was
[1:28:42] time brother Aaron I was down and we
[1:28:45] with you
[1:28:47] and I think uh we were just having such
[1:28:50] a good time and I I could see a was just
[1:28:53] kind of just really kind of looser he
[1:28:55] was really loose and he was like you
[1:28:57] know anointed and he was just having a
[1:28:59] good time and he said well why you know
[1:29:01] why do we need to
[1:29:02] stop and and the sister came to us after
[1:29:05] she said you know as as you were holding
[1:29:07] the service and he said the pillar of
[1:29:09] fire the fire was going across the altar
[1:29:11] back and forth back and forth and I
[1:29:15] could not quit I had such a hard time
[1:29:18] quitting that I think Aaron was in the
[1:29:20] same anointing
[1:29:22] anden so you know that's where we want
[1:29:24] to get the prophets said they lost
[1:29:26] Ephesians lost their love for the Holy
[1:29:28] Ghost meetings
[1:29:31] wow that's what I want I'm not saying
[1:29:34] the days past were better but you know
[1:29:36] what we can have that and more we can
[1:29:39] have more than that amen and God can
[1:29:42] speak
[1:29:43] directly to our lives and to our
[1:29:46] situations he's the discerner of the
[1:29:48] thoughts and intents of the heart so
[1:29:50] every you know that's the time we're
[1:29:52] living in I I just feel the momentum of
[1:29:54] the spirit here and exactly the time
[1:29:57] that you know Israel strayed and God had
[1:30:01] given them judges like we heard you know
[1:30:03] and God sent Gideon a prophet you notice
[1:30:06] that our brother referred to it this
[1:30:07] morning he sent a a prophet an angel and
[1:30:10] a
[1:30:11] judge a fivefold Ministry he sent the
[1:30:16] prophet the angel and he sent a fivefold
[1:30:18] Ministry for the perfecting of the
[1:30:21] maturing
[1:30:22] of the Saints amen so you know it's not
[1:30:26] so much like I said it's not so much
[1:30:29] churches stray but they just get out of
[1:30:32] Step
[1:30:33] or another reason is there's a lack of
[1:30:37] the new
[1:30:39] birth that's what the holy spirit said
[1:30:41] to me as I meditated on it I thought
[1:30:43] about this report because I was going to
[1:30:45] go a different way but the holy spirit
[1:30:47] said say this there's a lack of the new
[1:30:50] birth and that that's why you'll see
[1:30:54] confusion that's why you'll see
[1:30:57] defeat that's why you'll see a church
[1:30:59] will not Thrive you know we just don't
[1:31:02] want to survive another 20
[1:31:04] years we want to
[1:31:06] thrive we want to let's get out of here
[1:31:10] let's get it done Amen Let let's mean
[1:31:14] business with God we come here to the
[1:31:16] house of God judgment begins at the
[1:31:18] house of the Lord isn't that right and
[1:31:21] and the scripture said in 1 Corinthians
[1:31:23] 11 if we judge ourselves we wouldn't be
[1:31:26] judged with the
[1:31:28] world and condemned with the world
[1:31:30] because when we're judged of God then
[1:31:32] we're chastened of God so when we come
[1:31:34] to the house of God it's it you know
[1:31:38] it's to be edified it's to be ministered
[1:31:41] to but it's also to be
[1:31:45] corrected if there's no
[1:31:47] correction sometimes it's not worth very
[1:31:50] much if there's no correction there's
[1:31:52] got to be
[1:31:53] correction amen we all need correction
[1:31:56] even I need
[1:31:57] correction amen we all need correction
[1:32:00] and and sometimes you you're hanging on
[1:32:03] to something and if you'll just be in
[1:32:06] the spirit be under expectation have
[1:32:08] that man speak to me have that man today
[1:32:12] that Pastor speak to me he doesn't know
[1:32:14] anything about my trials you know I
[1:32:17] remember I did that one time with at
[1:32:19] when I was when I was called to preach
[1:32:22] and I struggled with it and I thought
[1:32:24] you know I do not want to preach my
[1:32:25] family's quiet I'm a reserved person my
[1:32:28] dad was a man of few words nobody in the
[1:32:31] family spoke we were C raised Catholics
[1:32:33] and I said you know get up in front of
[1:32:35] people wow that's you know I don't I
[1:32:37] don't want to do that and I ran from it
[1:32:41] until God got a hold of me and I said
[1:32:44] finally I said God that tape that I'm
[1:32:47] listening to that was a sign of the
[1:32:50] Messiah and I I said if that's true I
[1:32:54] said God if that's true then have this
[1:32:56] special speaker coming in today have him
[1:33:00] tell me have him say that brother martin
[1:33:03] is a minister didn't know me from anyone
[1:33:07] but I said if that's true what's on the
[1:33:08] tape it's true today he's Jesus Christ
[1:33:12] the same yesterday today forever he can
[1:33:14] use anyone he could use a donkey he
[1:33:17] could use an eagle to speak to
[1:33:19] you amen and I said that and it was
[1:33:22] brother bcll came in and he related a
[1:33:26] story about Hungary I think it was and a
[1:33:28] brother there that was ministering and
[1:33:30] his name was Martin and he said by the
[1:33:32] way he said Brother Martin and he
[1:33:33] pointed right brother martin is a
[1:33:36] minister I thought is anything too hard
[1:33:39] for God I thought this will get me out
[1:33:42] of it if God can't do this then he's not
[1:33:45] God right and if he's the same God on
[1:33:48] the tape he's the same God here
[1:33:50] today h Hallelujah he's the same in your
[1:33:54] life he knows what you need he knows
[1:33:57] when you need it he knows how to give it
[1:33:59] to you amen and we just ought to praise
[1:34:02] him for it amen and and and Just
[1:34:05] Surrender ourselves amen so it takes
[1:34:08] spiritual courage to change and the Book
[1:34:11] of Judges proved that you know and it
[1:34:13] and it took them uh like like JEA jepta
[1:34:17] he was a hero of faith in in judges 11
[1:34:19] we read that you read that on on
[1:34:21] Wednesday night brother Daniel and you
[1:34:23] know he he rehearsed all the ammonites
[1:34:28] they said This is Our Land and he
[1:34:30] rehearsed the whole is history of Israel
[1:34:33] where they came out of Egypt and they
[1:34:35] just came down the coast of M to to to
[1:34:39] the ammonites and the other tribes the
[1:34:41] other nations and they say can we pass
[1:34:44] through your land just let us pass and
[1:34:47] they wouldn't let them pass and then
[1:34:50] they they attacked them
[1:34:52] and God gave Israel the victory over
[1:34:55] them and gave Israel their
[1:34:59] land and and jeepa stood up and he said
[1:35:03] what God has given us we will
[1:35:06] possess we we haven't taken your land
[1:35:09] this is not your land the land is
[1:35:12] whoever God gives it to now remember
[1:35:16] that your land is whoever God whatever
[1:35:20] God gives you what ever promises that
[1:35:23] he's given us in this hour amen they're
[1:35:26] yours how much land do you
[1:35:29] want do you want your Mountain do you
[1:35:32] want your victories you want to possess
[1:35:34] those things amen there he is over there
[1:35:37] the brother I didn't see you God bless
[1:35:41] you amen so you know it's up to us God's
[1:35:45] waiting on us to take our land and
[1:35:49] possess it like like jeepa he rehearsed
[1:35:51] the whole thing he saidou God
[1:35:54] chimus it it's 300 years now since we've
[1:35:57] been in here if he wanted to give it
[1:35:58] back to you why isn't he given back to
[1:36:00] you now you're coming to attack us again
[1:36:03] the amorites were coming against them
[1:36:05] and they wanted JEA jeepa to fight for
[1:36:08] them amen and jeffa just stood up and he
[1:36:11] was a fighter he was a mighty warrior
[1:36:14] amen and he he made a vow we heard about
[1:36:17] that too he made a vow and he said God
[1:36:20] if you'll give me the victory over the
[1:36:22] enemy I'll give you the first thing that
[1:36:24] comes out of my house what was that his
[1:36:26] only daughter right and in a sense it
[1:36:29] was a foolish vow because you don't have
[1:36:31] to vow
[1:36:32] anything God didn't require that but
[1:36:36] whatever you vow you got to pay
[1:36:38] it like he said to D David said I will
[1:36:41] pay my vows in the presence of the
[1:36:45] congregation in the presence of the Lord
[1:36:47] I'll pay my vows in the house of the
[1:36:49] Lord amen so that that's that's what's
[1:36:52] happening right now in
[1:36:53] Israel they're saying this that Israel
[1:36:56] took their land yes well God gave it to
[1:36:59] them that's Theirs Whatever God gives
[1:37:02] you that's yours
[1:37:04] Footprints are
[1:37:06] possession wherever your foot Treads if
[1:37:09] I if I was healed if I could walk before
[1:37:11] I'll walk in the land of the living
[1:37:14] David said I'll walk in the land of the
[1:37:17] living why why did I want to be healed
[1:37:19] so I could go on the mission field amen
[1:37:21] so I could go back and preach that's why
[1:37:24] I wanted to be healed amen I I I could
[1:37:27] retire I could just sit back now I I
[1:37:30] think you know really I think I've done
[1:37:32] enough I could sit back but you know I
[1:37:34] want to do the devil as much damage I
[1:37:38] want to destroy and tear down everything
[1:37:41] he's took from me and from God's people
[1:37:45] amen and we all got to feel that way
[1:37:47] we're all missionaries amen so they
[1:37:49] attacked Israel and that's what they're
[1:37:51] doing doing now but it's God Who David
[1:37:54] said uh in the Psalms 24 he said the
[1:37:57] Earth is the Lord's and the fullness
[1:37:58] thereof the world and they that dwell in
[1:38:01] therein whose Land Is It
[1:38:03] Anyway whose Earth is it it's God's
[1:38:06] Earth and if he gives it to you it's
[1:38:10] yours amen several other scriptures
[1:38:13] there see uh but he was
[1:38:16] anointed and and and to to fulfill that
[1:38:19] so the scripture says in Genesis one
[1:38:21] more scripture in Genesis 28 Genesis 28
[1:38:25] I don't know if you can pick it up
[1:38:26] Brothers I don't have it on the slides
[1:38:28] Genesis 28 verse 10 uh and then you
[1:38:31] could go back to the
[1:38:32] slide Genesis what I say
[1:38:36] 2810 just
[1:38:38] quickly
[1:38:41] uh something I wanted to drop in here
[1:38:44] because it it pertains to Mission work
[1:38:46] because it's what I
[1:38:49] see uh 28 8 10 it's what I see happening
[1:38:54] now no that's the wrong book here it is
[1:39:00] Jacob went out from berseba and went to
[1:39:03] towards haran and he lighted upon a
[1:39:05] certain place and carried there all
[1:39:07] night because the sun was set and he
[1:39:09] took stones of that place and put them
[1:39:11] for his pillows and lay down in the
[1:39:13] place to sleep and he dreamed a dream
[1:39:15] and behold a ladder set up on the earth
[1:39:18] and the top it reached to heaven and
[1:39:20] behold it angels of God ascending and
[1:39:22] descending on it I wonder who those
[1:39:25] angels
[1:39:26] were I wonder what it looked like to
[1:39:29] Jacob you know maybe maybe he you know
[1:39:32] i' like to just this is just me but
[1:39:34] maybe he saw
[1:39:36] Paul maybe he saw arus maybe he saw
[1:39:39] Martin maybe he saw Columba maybe he saw
[1:39:43] Luther how because their theophanies
[1:39:47] were built before the foundation of the
[1:39:48] world God had this this was all done in
[1:39:51] God's mind before the foundation of the
[1:39:53] world and Jacob's beholding this see and
[1:39:57] and it's it's amazing he says and behold
[1:40:00] the Lord above it stood above it and I
[1:40:02] the Lord he said I am the Lord God
[1:40:04] Abraham the father of thy fathers and
[1:40:06] the god of Israel Isaac and the land
[1:40:09] wherein thou liest to thee will I give
[1:40:11] it and to thy seed and thy seed as the D
[1:40:14] shall be as the dust of the earth not
[1:40:17] only the sand brother Jordan
[1:40:21] but the
[1:40:23] dust that's why there's 300 billion
[1:40:26] stars in our galaxy
[1:40:29] alone your seed will like be like the
[1:40:31] dust of the
[1:40:33] earth and thou shal spread abroad to the
[1:40:37] west to the East and to the North and
[1:40:38] the South and in thee and thy seed shall
[1:40:41] all the families of the earth be blessed
[1:40:42] and behold I am with thee and I will
[1:40:44] keep thee and all the places wherein
[1:40:46] thou goest and will bring thee again
[1:40:48] into this land for I will not leave thee
[1:40:51] until I have done that which I have
[1:40:52] spoken unto you God is given him a
[1:40:55] covenant like he did with Abraham he's
[1:40:58] making a covenant God is
[1:41:01] vowing God's made a covenant with us
[1:41:04] Saints he vowed in this age he's made a
[1:41:08] covenant with us an
[1:41:09] unconditional
[1:41:11] Covenant I will make you a
[1:41:14] blessing your neighbors are going to be
[1:41:18] blessed your co-workers are going to be
[1:41:21] blessed I heard a testimony the other
[1:41:23] day here about a coworker and and we had
[1:41:27] one in on our street they she went in
[1:41:30] for an operation simple operation and
[1:41:32] and and whatever they did they paralyzed
[1:41:36] her her whole body was
[1:41:38] paralyzed and you know I they got her
[1:41:42] home from the hospital she could hardly
[1:41:43] walk hardly walk and I I met her and I
[1:41:46] asked what's your name Victoria and you
[1:41:49] know and I was going in for a hipop
[1:41:50] operation so we had a little bit in
[1:41:52] common and we talked about that and and
[1:41:54] then you know I said well we're going to
[1:41:55] pray for you Victoria we're going to

[1:42:00] thank you very much she said thank you

[1:42:05] within a month she was going down the
[1:42:08] street by herself in a month am man I

[1:42:29] whether you're stubborn or not he's
[1:42:31] going to make you a blessing amen so you
[1:42:34] know I wondered about this because Jacob

[1:51:34] gospel and they probably lock me
[1:51:37] up said do you know what price was paid
[1:51:40] for your Liberty and look what you're

[1:52:05] injured he was bleeding and dying and
[1:52:06] usually they left them and he could hear
[1:52:08] the groans and people dying around him
[1:52:11] and you know he got desperate and he
[1:52:14] said Lord God if you will save my life
[1:52:19] if you will give me another chance I
[1:52:22] will sculpt that was his gift was
[1:52:25] sculpting said I'll sculpt sculptures
[1:52:28] for you about
[1:52:31] Jesus and you know what God miraculously
[1:52:35] saved him wow he saved his life someone
[1:52:38] came along got him out of there and got
[1:52:41] him to a triage they got him back to
[1:52:43] America it was in the 30s he later in
[1:52:47] the 30s after the war was over he found
[1:52:50] himself drifting and he drifted to
[1:52:52] Tucson
[1:52:53] Arizona and when he drifted here it was
[1:52:56] the depression so you know he was
[1:52:59] homeless he was a homeless person
[1:53:01] brother Arnie he was homeless this man
[1:53:04] was homeless and he had a cardboard box
[1:53:07] and he lived under the Congress bridge
[1:53:11] and that's where he lived and he would
[1:53:13] go down to the river or to the to the
[1:53:15] wash you call it I don't yeah you call
[1:53:18] it a wash I call it River but it's a
[1:53:21] wash and a river right so anyway we were
[1:53:24] we were walking along that when we found
[1:53:26] this and we saw all this trash and
[1:53:27] garbage and saying man why don't they
[1:53:29] clean this up this this looks terrible
[1:53:33] you know this why isn't the city doing
[1:53:35] something about this and then we come
[1:53:36] across the story of this man and he
[1:53:39] would go down to the wash and he would
[1:53:41] pick up old trash like bed springs and
[1:53:45] stuff and then he'd put them in his his
[1:53:48] his his models his frames and he made
[1:53:51] the the last supper table out of bed
[1:53:54] springs and sand from the river he dug
[1:53:58] sand you know he was fulfilling his vow
[1:54:01] he said I vowed and I'm going to fulfill
[1:54:03] it and no matter how poor I am no matter
[1:54:06] how bum wrap I get no matter how far I'm
[1:54:09] pushed down I'm going to do it cuz God
[1:54:12] did something for me God saved my life
[1:54:17] amen and you know he he took the trash
[1:54:19] and everything and he he built these
[1:54:21] things and then a a businessman from the
[1:54:23] city here he he saw what was being done
[1:54:26] and people were coming and and he said
[1:54:28] you know what I want to help you and so
[1:54:29] he got a guy that was really good at at
[1:54:32] cement work and they added cement to the
[1:54:34] plaster and the sand so it would be take
[1:54:36] the elements better and that's what you
[1:54:38] see
[1:54:39] there you know he had a lot of obstacles
[1:54:43] he had a lot against him but you know
[1:54:46] when you make a vow to serve God you you
[1:54:49] make it you you break it you'll pay for
[1:54:52] it but you make it you obey it amen you
[1:54:56] live it don't just come and say I'm a
[1:54:59] Christian live something else the
[1:55:00] prophet said right I mean we we will
[1:55:03] make mistakes we will fall but you get
[1:55:06] up again you repent you come to church
[1:55:10] am Meen you get Washed by the Water of
[1:55:12] the word amen and and get the victory
[1:55:15] again it's not how many times we fall
[1:55:18] and I know you're getting TI
[1:55:20] I I just want to finish with this this
[1:55:23] little story here because I I just
[1:55:25] thought about this you know uh the
[1:55:29] circumstances our
[1:55:31] circumstances there were nowhere near
[1:55:32] his circumstances you know he was a
[1:55:34] homeless person but you know people are
[1:55:37] homeless it's not the homelessness we
[1:55:39] see in
[1:55:41] Lea they don't have he didn't have
[1:55:44] shelters he didn't have handouts he
[1:55:46] didn't have food coming to him amen he
[1:55:49] didn't he didn't stand on the street not
[1:55:51] nothing against those people but you see
[1:55:53] what I mean he
[1:55:55] overcame
[1:55:57] regardless people helped him or not and
[1:55:59] people noticed because why because God
[1:56:02] honored that vow he honored his vow and
[1:56:07] and it's amazing you know what God can
[1:56:09] do if we vow a vow and sometimes it
[1:56:12] takes desperation like Jacob he vowed a
[1:56:16] vow the scripture said that if you will
[1:56:19] bless me and return me to my land again
[1:56:23] I will I will serve you and I will build
[1:56:25] a house here I will build a house for
[1:56:28] you here upon that rock that's how he
[1:56:31] built the church upon the rock of
[1:56:33] Revelation see
[1:56:35] Jacob he had that that experience but he
[1:56:38] wasn't converted
[1:56:40] yet he still needed to be
[1:56:43] converted and and it you know in type
[1:56:46] because like our brother said the Holy
[1:56:48] Ghost was on them but would go back but
[1:56:51] in type he needed another step and it
[1:56:54] wasn't until he faced
[1:56:57] Esau his his brother in the flesh that
[1:57:00] he
[1:57:01] realized hey I've got to pay what I said
[1:57:05] back there when I left I got to pay my
[1:57:07] vows and he and Jacob said I'll give you
[1:57:10] a
[1:57:11] tenth I'll give you my tithe I'll give
[1:57:15] you my offerings that's part of our vow
[1:57:19] to serve God where have you robbed me

[1:57:25] have you robbed me I don't want to be
[1:57:27] guilty of robbing God I don't want to be
[1:57:29] guilty of picking God's
[1:57:32] Pockets amen n it got quiet in the
[1:57:36] house but it's part of it that's our vow
[1:57:40] that's part of worship you can't afford
[1:57:42] not to pay you can't afford it man none
[1:57:47] of us can even even if it's a little
[1:57:50] bit amen so you know uh as I was

[1:58:39] coming forth something from the Lord I
[1:58:41] know it as thus sayeth the Lord there's
[1:58:43] coming forth something and we better get
[1:58:46] desperate it's between life and death
[1:58:48] it'll pass right through us and we won't
[1:58:51] see it what a solemn warning to us in
[1:58:55] the
[1:58:56] message he'd already brought the seals
[1:59:00] he' already brought the church ages he
[1:59:02] already brought thus sayeth the Lord
[1:59:04] there's coming forth something from the
[1:59:06] Lord it had already been brought we have

[1:59:16] Lord but Joshua said Son stand
[1:59:20] still we have more than that we have
[1:59:23] thus sayith the Lord but we have the
[1:59:25] spoken word and it's up to us to confess
[1:59:29] it and believe it and accept it and take
[1:59:33] that land that belongs to us take your
[1:59:35] land tonight that's what I'm exhorting

[1:59:42] how many would vow tonight how many
[1:59:44] would renew your vow tonight you know
[1:59:47] sometimes it's good for us to as married
[1:59:49] couple to renew our vows or make a vow
[1:59:53] not a foolish vow but a vow to serve
[1:59:57] God a vow to be more desperate about the
[2:00:01] things of God a vow to be on fire a vow
[2:00:04] to
[2:00:06] surrender to live faithful see that
[2:00:10] desperation that's why the prophet
[2:00:11] preached the token and then he preached
[2:00:15] desperation you've got to be desperate
[2:00:17] to have it
[2:00:19] amen I remember one time I was
[2:00:23] desperate and I was a 19-year-old boy in
[2:00:26] a YMCA
[2:00:28] dying and I told the Lord I went to
[2:00:31] hell and God showed me hell and he
[2:00:34] showed me the fire there is a hell let
[2:00:37] me tell you there is a hell and it's
[2:00:42] burning unquenchable
[2:00:45] fire and darkness at the same time well
[2:00:48] that would smother you and I said God if
[2:00:52] you'll get me out of this place I'll
[2:00:55] change
[2:00:57] tomorrow give me one more chance like
[2:01:00] that man on the
[2:01:01] battlefield give me just another chance

[2:01:46] separation I was under death and when I
[2:01:49] came to I was so glad to be alive and I
[2:01:54] said wow that that was more than a
[2:01:58] dream that was you know that was that
[2:02:02] was that was God I left this place and
[2:02:07] that's where I was heading and that's
[2:02:09] where Satan will take out young lives

[2:02:14] that's where they'll end up but for the
[2:02:17] grace of God there go I

[2:04:27] room for the devil say God spoke to me
[2:04:30] now I wanted to run out of that
[2:04:33] church because there was a devil on this
[2:04:35] side saying get out and there was an
[2:04:37] angel on this side saying this is God
[2:04:40] you just walked into the Bible you just
[2:04:43] walked into the presence of God and I
[2:04:44] could feel it and and brother hilbrand
[2:04:47] said at the end of the service said uh
[2:04:49] now does anyone have anything to say
[2:04:51] here because I've never heard him and he
[2:04:53] was my pastor for 36 more than 36 38
[2:04:57] years I've never heard him say that once
[2:05:01] since then he said does anyone here have
[2:05:03] something to say I was on my feet before
[2:05:06] I knew it speaking saying I'm not worthy
[2:05:10] of this I'm not like you people all you
[2:05:13] good holy people here I I'm I'm just I'm
[2:05:16] off the street I I can't like you guys
[2:05:19] and I said uh you know I was supposed to
[2:05:21] get baptized tonight but I'm having
[2:05:23] second thoughts and he said you know
[2:05:25] what we don't force anyone to get
[2:05:27] baptized here we just preach the gospel
[2:05:31] he said you go with the deacons they'll
[2:05:32] show you in the scripture and when they
[2:05:34] showed me in the scripture I knew I'm on
[2:05:36] the right path amen I'm going through
[2:05:39] with it I listen to the angel not to the
[2:05:43] devil not to fear I listen to Faith amen
[2:05:48] and I overcame that amen and everyone
[2:05:52] rejected me after that but God received
[2:05:55] me amen I remember leaving that service
[2:05:59] going with one of the brothers they were
[2:06:01] playing a message tape in the truck and
[2:06:04] it was an old GMC with a three in the
[2:06:06] tree you know that one some of you older
[2:06:09] ones know that one yeah they're fun to
[2:06:11] drive anyway we were going to we were
[2:06:13] going to build a church they were
[2:06:14] building a new church in Edmonton and
[2:06:16] they hired me well I got in in that
[2:06:19] truck and the tape was playing and the
[2:06:21] pillar of fire came in that truck
[2:06:24] glory glory amen it was so milky in that
[2:06:28] truck I just melted I melted in the seat
[2:06:32] I was the first revelation I got was I'm
[2:06:37] lost I'm lost without the Holy Ghost you
[2:06:41] know the they asked the prophet will our
[2:06:42] children go in the Rapture if they have
[2:06:44] the Holy
[2:06:47] Ghost there's a difference he said
[2:06:49] between a Believer a Christian a
[2:06:52] Believer and a holy ghost filled
[2:06:54] Christian there's a big difference he
[2:06:56] said so we need to grow up into him in
[2:07:01] All Things there's a difference between
[2:07:04] believing in God you ask a homeless
[2:07:06] person you ask a drunk on the street do
[2:07:09] you believe in God
[2:07:11] absolutely absolutely brother oh yeah I
[2:07:14] believe in God you want to come to
[2:07:16] church no God say
[2:07:19] everywhere God's in nature yeah God's in
[2:07:22] nature but God's God's got a house
[2:07:24] too God's got a word amen come to the
[2:07:28] house of the Lord amen we are the house
[2:07:31] of the Lord oh my and I'm I'm getting
[2:07:33] along I know but I I'm just relieving
[2:07:36] myself a little bit it's been three
[2:07:37] months almost through my operation
[2:07:40] forgive
[2:07:41] me but I'm so excited to preach for God
[2:07:45] again amen and you know I ran out on the
[2:07:48] street and musicians come come please
[2:07:52] come now yeah it's over uh you know I
[2:07:55] ran out onto the street brother Daniel
[2:07:57] and I was after that Pillar of Fire
[2:08:00] experience I went I got out of the truck
[2:08:02] the brother said Brother Martin you got
[2:08:03] to get out of the truck I got family I
[2:08:05] got I got I got a supper the wife's
[2:08:07] waiting you got to get out of the truck
[2:08:09] I was just
[2:08:10] like I was I just didn't want to move
[2:08:13] that presence and I just said you know I
[2:08:16] just said yeah okay I got out of the
[2:08:17] truck and then I can still remember the
[2:08:20] place my experience will be different
[2:08:22] from yours I'm not preaching experience
[2:08:25] for truth everyone's will be different
[2:08:28] but God had something for me to do and I
[2:08:32] suffered some things for my
[2:08:35] mistakes and and I have had to pay for
[2:08:37] that I I had to suffer many things
[2:08:40] because of that but you know when I got
[2:08:42] out of that and sometimes it's good to
[2:08:44] look back you can play anything you feel
[2:08:47] sometimes it's good to look back to the
[2:08:49] pit from when you came and I and I I
[2:08:52] looked up and in my mind's eye I didn't
[2:08:54] see a vision but in my mind's eye I
[2:08:56] could see the
[2:08:58] cross like that white cross that Felix
[2:09:03] made I could see the cross and I could
[2:09:05] see him nailed there and I could
[2:09:09] see my my
[2:09:13] sin I could see my
[2:09:16] sin young people
[2:09:19] God has no
[2:09:21] grandchildren it's not your parents'
[2:09:23] experience it's your experience young
[2:09:26] man it's your experience young lady it's
[2:09:30] not your parents you got to have a
[2:09:33] personal revelation of Jesus
[2:09:36] Christ I'm sorry I'm preaching and not
[2:09:39] staying but it's Mission work and that's
[2:09:42] what I see lacking it's a lack of the
[2:09:45] new birth to mean business with God to
[2:09:48] get get in his presence and allow him to
[2:09:50] change
[2:09:51] us we're all at different stages let him
[2:09:54] change us as a minister change me
[2:09:58] Lord as a Believer change me Lord I

[2:10:05] tonight how many would do that with me
[2:10:09] amen you know when I went down when I
[2:10:13] saw that then it got personal then it
[2:10:17] then it got personal
[2:10:18] that was my sin that put him there and
[2:10:21] he's saying
[2:10:22] Martin I died for
[2:10:25] you I died for you brother Joe I died
[2:10:29] for you if he had to die for one person
[2:10:32] he'd come and die for you ain't that
[2:10:35] wonderful isn't he so
[2:10:38] good God would come for one just
[2:10:42] 99 and one he'd come for one and he came
[2:10:46] for me and he came for you he came for
[2:10:50] all of
[2:10:51] us I ran out into the street brother
[2:10:54] Daniel I ran out of the street I jumped
[2:10:57] up in the air I'm just remembering it
[2:10:59] now I'm reliving it a young man 19 dying
[2:11:05] and God saved me God called me I've made
[2:11:10] stupid mistakes but he called me anyway

[2:11:32] up like like that amen I did it
[2:11:36] see I was about this high jumping up in
[2:11:40] the air I'm
[2:11:42] saved running down the main street of
[2:11:45] Edmonton the busiest Street in the city

[2:12:15] was in the in the war in Asia and he
[2:12:19] stepped on a mine and it blew his leg
[2:12:21] off he had one leg and he was standing
[2:12:25] there with one leg talking to me and he
[2:12:28] said when I was laying dying he said I
[2:12:32] asked God if you'll save my life I'll
[2:12:35] serve you the rest of my life he said
[2:12:39] then he said I give my heart to the Lord
[2:12:42] he said and he saved my soul so he said
[2:12:45] he saved my life and he saved my soul we
[2:12:48] Rejoice together on that street corner I
[2:12:51] can still
[2:12:53] remember we we we

[2:20:23] love to hear what's going on in
[2:20:26] different parts of the
[2:20:27] world and I looked up there and the um
[2:20:32] the
[2:20:33] handwritten sermon book that brother
[2:20:36] martin put up there it's
[2:20:39] um is this the sign of the end
[2:20:43] sir was the sermon that was up there I
[2:20:46] recognized a couple words on on there
[2:20:48] and I looked it up and thought how
[2:20:52] important it
[2:20:54] is brother brandom wanted his message
[2:20:57] translated and that is something that I
[2:20:59] know that we've we've done so much with
[2:21:02] it and messed it up and and changed it
[2:21:05] and made it about something he didn't
[2:21:06] want it to be about but there's one
[2:21:08] thing that he wanted is he wanted it
[2:21:09] translated and he wanted it sent
[2:21:13] overseas and that's something that I
[2:21:15] dedicated my life too it's something
[2:21:19] that Stephanie and I I I remember I had
[2:21:22] it in my heart one time
[2:21:24] to do something but we didn't have the
[2:21:26] money and it was Christmas time and I
[2:21:29] remember I talked to the kids and I said
[2:21:32] how about this year instead of
[2:21:35] gifts that we just take this money and
[2:21:39] and we donate it so maybe other people
[2:21:42] could have this message that we all hold
[2:21:46] hold so dear neared us and of course the
[2:21:48] kids were little and they agreed and I I
[2:21:50] promised the kids I said I promise you
[2:21:54] that if we do this that the Lord will
[2:21:56] return these blessings a lot more than
[2:22:00] what we have given today and not having
[2:22:04] these
[2:22:06] gifts it was as I said it was something
[2:22:08] that I dedicated my life
[2:22:11] to and I just wish that it would have
[2:22:15] been something that we could have all
[2:22:16] gotten together on and gotten
[2:22:20] behind but with all the division and
[2:22:23] everything that's around in the world I
[2:22:24] appreciate what Brother Martin said is
[2:22:27] that as a missionary you go overseas and
[2:22:30] you kind of have to walk through the
[2:22:31] middle of it because there are doctrines
[2:22:34] on all sides so I do I appreciate that
[2:22:37] and
[2:22:39] appreciate well not only brother martin
[2:22:41] but what the Brethren we're doing
[2:22:42] overseas and still trying to translate
[2:22:46] brother bram's message message it's been
[2:22:47] a blessing to me and my family and I I
[2:22:50] pray that it will be an equal blessing
[2:22:53] to all those that get to hear it and I
[2:22:56] appreciate Brothers like this going over
[2:22:59] and telling how important it is because
[2:23:02] it is it's something that it pleases god
[2:23:05] let's bow our
[2:23:09] heads Heavenly
[2:23:12] Father we're grateful Lord
[2:23:16] that as our brother was telling us
[2:23:20] that we didn't take it far enough that
[2:23:22] there's got to be a new
[2:23:24] [Music]
[2:23:25] birth Lord that new birth
[2:23:28] is it's what brother brandom came for
[2:23:31] it's what the message is for it's it's
[2:23:33] what your word is for so that we might
[2:23:36] have that that
[2:23:38] relationship with Jesus Christ and that
[2:23:41] we might have that new
[2:23:43] birth else
[2:23:45] father would good is anything that we do
[2:23:48] what good is preaching what good is is
[2:23:51] witnessing what good is duplicating
[2:23:53] these sermons translating sermons what
[2:23:55] good is it if there's no new
[2:23:57] birth father we pray
[2:24:00] that all of us here

[2:24:13] what the prophet said and go all the way
[2:24:18] we thank you Lord for a time of
[2:24:20] reflection

[2:24:25] reflection would always be in our hearts
