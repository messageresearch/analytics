I can't wait till I can hold it. Sweetheart, God bless you. I don't uh brothers, I didn't get any prayer requests. Are there any any in the back? So we don't have any written requests and but friends let's never take it for granted that we can raise our hand in the name of Jesus Christ if we have something on our hearts and that he will look down and he will see that we made the effort to raise a hand and then we can rest assured that he saw it and that he will answer. So, let's bow our heads and friends, if you have a request on your heart that you would make known to the Lord Jesus, lift up your hand with a prayer request in your heart and hold it before him as we approach his throne. Almighty God, Lord, you look down upon our little gathering tonight. And Lord, how many gatherings like this have there been throughout history where you have made yourself known, Lord, and you have answered prayers. Lord, we lift these requests up before you in the name of Jesus Christ, according to your word. And as is it is written in the book of John spoken by Jesus himself and said if you ask anything in my name I will do it. Father we bring these requests before you in the name of Jesus Christ and ask that you would father meet the needs that we have. We love you and we pray that your blessings would be be upon our service tonight in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] You can all be seated. Let's go down to F. Sing. There is none like you.

[Music] Sister Hope, you have a song tonight. You want to come up? That is what I do. I give you praise for you are my rightousness. [Music] I worship you almighty God. There is none like you. I have a little testimony to share. In January, the Lord healed me when we were singing. I was at brother Israel's and they sang only believe. And the presence of the Lord swept through there and he healed me instantly of something that I was asking him to. I just felt it in my body. It was just really supernatural. But we were singing only believe. And um the Lord, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. and he's my God and he's so supernatural and so personal. So sing it with me if you will. [Music] All things are possible only. [Music] All things are possible only be fear not through the cross to the throne from into he all power in earth. All power above [Music] is given [Music] his love. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. [Music] All things are possible. Lord I be fear not little he go ahead your sheer selected the path you Theers of my feeling for thee. He drank all the blessing me. [Music] All things are possible. Only believe. [Music] All things are possible. [Music] Only believe. Fear not. Whatever your light, he enters or doors being locked. He never forsakes. is gone. So count on his presence in darkness and Jesus is here. Jesus is here. All things are possible. Jesus is here. Jesus is here. Jesus is here. [Music] All things are possible. [Music] Jesus is here. Lord, I receive. Lord, I receive. All things are possible. Lord, I receive. Lord, I receive. Lord, I receive. All things are possible. [Music] Lord, I receive. Thank you, sister. you'd all stand as brother Lyall's going to come. I didn't have this one back there, but can you can you put up the lyrics to Above All [Music] whenever something bad or tragic happens, it's always really sad and you get to thinking about what the Lord did. He was above everyone. He was more powerful. The perfect mighty God. [Music] Didn't even get a Jewish death. Didn't even get a Jewish stoning at the temple. Got hung on a on a cross by pagans and suffered and died. [Music] There's no way to measure what he did for us. Above all powers, above all kings, above all nature and all created things, [Music] above all wisdom and all the ways of men. Think of this. Oh, you were here before the world began. Above all kingdoms, above all kingoms, [Music] above all thrones. [Music] Above all wonders the world has ever known. [Music] There's no way to measure. [Music] Crucified, [Music] laid behind a stone. You live to die. You checked it and alone. [Music] You took the fall and thought of me above all. Let's sing those verses again. Above all powers, [Music] above all kings, above all nature and all created things, above all wisdom and all the ways of man. Oh yes, you were here before the world began. Above all kingdoms, above all kingoms, above all thrones, above all wonders the world has ever known. Above all wealth and treasures of the earth, there's no way to measure what your worth. Crucified, laid behind the stone. You live to die. Rejected and alone like a rose trampled on the ground. You took the fall and thought of me above all. [Music] Thank you. Such love. Such love that he would do that not only for all of us but for each of us. Wonder if we could get the uh first slide up. I hope you all can read that. Good evening. It's so good to be back with you, Heather. and I I'm glad to be back with you. Heather and I were gone for several weeks visiting family in Washington and Oregon. Started with a wedding, then multiple birthdays, including twin grandsons turning 18, ending with Heather's oldest sibling turning 80. And in the midst of all of it, we were able to see and hold our newest great grandchild, Suie Anne Johnson, when she was less than a day old and pray with her and her parents in the hospital room. So, it was a wonderful trip, but we're so glad to be back. Last Wednesday evening, as our pastor mentioned, Brother Josiah AO started a series on praise and worship. The thoughts I want to share this evening are on the same topic. Praise and worship. Praise of the Lord, I think, is always a form of worship. Worship of the Lord doesn't always include praise. Or does it? Before we read our opening scriptures, let's start by uniting our hearts once more in prayer. Lord Jesus, it's such an honor to be here. Lord, to be among the people that you died for, that you paid the ultimate price. Lord, it's it's a responsibility to be here. Lord, I pray that you would help the the thoughts that are to be expressed this evening, Lord, to be the way you want them to be expressed, to be the thoughts you want expressed, that they would be heard in the way that you want them to be heard, Lord. Lord, I thank you so much for our musicians and worship leaders, Lord, to help set the atmosphere, to help us set aside the weights of this world and the troubles and the thoughts and the concerns, Lord, that we can just focus our attention, our hearts, our lives, our souls, our spirits on you. That's our desire this evening, Lord, to worship you, to praise you, to exalt you, to lift you up. Lord, be with us this evening. Forgive us, Lord, and forgive me for we've fallen short, Lord. Cleanse my heart. Cleanse my thoughts, Lord. We're here to worship you. We love you, Lord Jesus. Thank you. Amen. This image is of the Hebrew text from the Lengrad Codeex of the very first time a word translated as praise occurs in the Bible. I I've enclosed the word in a box. I'm sure you can read it. It says Odette. Any guesses as to who uttered this first recorded praise of the Lord? It was I'll tell you later. Our topic verses are found in the book of Genesis chapter 29. The context is that of Jacob. He's fled from the wrath of Esau because Jacob in conjunction with his mom had deceived his father Isaac into giving Jacob the blessing of the firstborn. Jacob ran away. He settled in Syria. Jacob's working for his uncle Laban and after seven years has been allowed to marry Laban's daughter, Jacob's own first cousin. He thought he was marrying Rachel, but woke up to find her older sister, Leia, next to him. Jacob and Laban then worked out an additional seven-year obligation, and Jacob married Rachel a week after marrying Leia. Not a happy situation. But remember, our study is about praise and worship. What's going on? Let's read from Genesis 29 starting at verse 30. And Jacob went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leia, and served with Laban yet seven other years. And when the Lord saw that Leia was hated, now some translations say she was despised or she was unloved. But the Hebrew word sane literally means hate. When the Lord saw that Leia was hated, the Lord opened Leia's womb. But Rachel was barren, unable to become pregnant. And Leia conceived and bare a son. And she called his name Reuben. Look, a son. Jacob, you're a dad. You have an heir. Your firstborn is a son. She said, "Surely the Lord has looked upon my affliction. Now therefore, because of this birth, my husband will love me." conceived again and bare a son and said, "Because the Lord has heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also." She called his name Simeon. She means to hear or be heard. and Leia conceived again and bare a son and said, "Now this time will my husband be joined unto me because I have borne him three sons." Therefore, his name was called, we say Levi, it's Levie means joined to note Moses the greatest prophet of the Old Testament was descended from this Levi as were the priests which ministered. ministered to the Lord and the Levites which took care of the tabernacle and later the temple and all of its instruments. They're all descended from this third psalm. But wait, there's more. You may be thinking, "Brother Wild. Why read about an unhappy marriage? What does this have to do with praise and worship?" And Leia conceived again. and bear a son. And notice the change in her attitude. She said, "Now will I praise the Lord." Praising the Lord, one of our topics. Therefore, she called his name Judah. Yehuda, praise, and left bearing. Please be seated. So, so back to our question, who was the first to offer praise to God that's recorded in the Bible? Was it Adam, the first human communed with God every evening until the fall? Abel, the first to offer a sacrifice that God accepted. Seth, Enoch, who walked with God and was not. Noah, who survived the flood by careful obedience. Abraham, who received the promises of God. Isaac, the the patriarch who never left the promised land. Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel and was the progenator of the nation. Were any of these the first to offer praise to God? No. The first recording of praise to the Lord in the entire Bible. The first use of the word is attributed to Leia, the hated, unwanted spouse of Jacob. Do a word search on praise if you want to verify this. If somebody told me that, I'd do a word search. I'm such a trusting guy. I want to draw your attention to the sequence. Here's a woman who was snuck into Jacob's marriage bed after his father-in-law Laban made sure Jacob was drunk and the night was dark. How do you suppose Jacob felt when he woke up? And to our point, how do you think Leia felt knowing she was being substituted for her little sister? Knowing Jacob didn't want her from the outset of his sojurnn with her family, being ignored by him for seven years as he gazed with longing on her baby sister. Rachel this and Rachel that. Rachel, Rachel, Rachel. When Reuben was born, Leia says the Lord has looked on her affliction. The fact that her husband was using her but hates her. Thinks that by bearing him a son, Jacob will realize what a treasure she is. and will genuinely love her. She's hurting. She's looking for comfort, soulless, wanting love from her mate. Didn't happen. No. Okay, time for sidebar. It didn't happen till many years later. Remember, Jacob had fled home because he stole the blessing of the firstborn from Esau. Later, Reuben, Jacob's firstborn and possessor of the birthright, will sacrifice his birthright and stain his blessing of the firstborn, the things that Jacob so highly valued to force Jacob to finally give Leia her proper place. And we read the result at the end of Genesis where Jacob asks to be buried in the family tomb to be laid beside Leia. reminds us of the story of David's selection as Saul's successor. The part where God tells Samuel to not see as man sees, but God looks on the heart. Saul was descended from Rachel. David was descended from Leia. Sorry for the distraction. I can't help. I love that part of the story. Well, back back to our topic with son number two. Leia confesses she's still hated, but knows that God has heard of her plight. Leia is still focused on her situation. Completely understandable, 100% human with son number three. She's still looking to be joined to her husband. Joined in heart, I think, is a safe interpretation of her desire, of her longing. But look what happens with son number At last, Leia looks beyond her personal situation, her pain. It hasn't changed. Jacob's still a rotten husband regarding her. Maybe she's given up on him ever truly loving her, but her expression is no longer one of despair. Her hope is no longer towards Jacob. In the midst of her ongoing affliction and longing, she turns to the Lord. Not as an agent to correct her predicament. Lord, please make my husband love me. No, but to praise the Lord in spite of her circumstances, to look to him for what she needs, not as the agent, but as the solution. Let's look at the name she gives to this fourthborn. Judah, we say in English, Yahuda in Hebrew, the the one word interpretation is praise. This Bible study, we can go deeper than one word. So, let's let's dig a little bit. The root word of this name is yada, a verb. In its most primitive form, it means to throw or shoot or cast. The noun form of this word is yad, which is hand, which kind of suggests why we like to raise our hands when we praise the Lord. Depending on how it is used in a sentence and its verb form, it's used in the Bible in four different ways. There's a simple active form like raising your hand. There's an intensive act of like throwing something, casting down your crown. There's a a causitive action like saying thank you when someone does something nice for you. And then there's what they call the intensive reflexive. It's an intense action on yourself like repentance leading to baptism or praising the Lord in the midst of your troubles like Leia. Strongs tells us yadas to use to hold out the hand physically to throw something to revere or worship with extended hands intensively to be moaned by ringing the hands. In Hebrew, Judah's name Yehudah includes the name of God Yahweh as well as the root word of praise. The rabbis tell us that the name Yehudah envelopes God's name in praise. Yehudah is the only one of Jacob's sons whose name includes the name of God. Okay, some of you are either still awake or you've tattooed your eyes so that you look like you're awake, but it's okay. You can wake up now. Now, I want to ask a question. Which of Jacob's sons was the ancestor of David? Was it Reuben, Levi, Dan, Joseph, Benjamin? No, Judah. One more question. To which of Jacob's sons do the genealogies recorded in Matthews and Luke's gospels link Jesus? Judah. Have you ever wondered why the accounts of Matthew and Luke make a point about the ancestry of Joseph? Since Jesus was the only begotten son of God, how could he be of the line of Judah? What's going on? In Matthew 1, we read the book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. We we see that son simply means descendant. And and now we trace a lineage. Abraham begat Isaac. Isaac begat Jacob. Jacob begat Judas. That's translated from the from the Greek Judah. Yehudah and his brethren. And Judah begat Ferz and Zarah of Tamar. We we know the story several verses down many generations. Elude begat Eleazar. Eleazar begat Matan. Matan begat Jacob. Not the Jacob we normally think of. Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary. Of whom was born Jesus who was called Christ anointed Messiah. Joseph listed as the husband of Mary, not as the father of her son. Curious what what does Luke have to say about this? Luke chapter 3. Jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age being as was supposed the local rumor mill did not require AI or Tik Tok or social media or news outlets to spread gossip and halftruths. being as was supposed the son of Joseph, again skipping many generations, the son of Phz, which was the son of Judah, Yehuda, the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham. Both gospel accounts make it clear that Joseph wasn't Jesus' biological dad. So, what's the big deal? Why? How would this information be here to convince Jewish readers that Jesus was in fact a son of David? Ever wonder how these serve to overcome objections that might be raised about his ancestry? I confess I I wondered about it. In fact, it was just earlier this week preparing for this lesson that I I either I got it or or I think I did. So, if you'll uh if you'll bear with me just a moment. This is a technical thing. It has I think that's an off switch. I think that that means on. Yeah, it lights up. I need to get a couple of people here from the audience. Yeah, I think would it be okay if I uh borrowed Kayla and Hadasa for a moment. Come on, girls. Come on. You can do this. You can do this. Let's come this way. And just just have a seat here. Just make yourself comfortable, as comfortable as you can sitting next to an old guy like me. So, your name is &gt;&gt; Hadassa. &gt;&gt; What's your last name? &gt;&gt; Bagot. &gt;&gt; Hada Bagot. Your name is &gt;&gt; Michaela. &gt;&gt; Michaela &gt;&gt; Bagot. &gt;&gt; Michaela Bagot. Was that always your name? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Was that always your name? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. How did you get your new name? How did you get your new name? Was it uh perhaps because you were adopted? They're shaking their head. That means yes, the microphone didn't pick it up. If I shook my head, you hear a rattle, but they're they're a little more solid than I am. So So does that make Brother Jeremy and Sister Angela your dad and mom? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Your dad and mom. I think I might have a couple of questions for them. Let's let's walk back that way. But but first first I want to thank you for your help. Okay, there's two of you. That's a $2 bill. Let's go this way. [Applause] So I I just heard that these are your adopted daughters. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Okay. Um, so in the eyes of the law they're your daughters. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They've taken your name. They are now part of the tribe of Bagot. &gt;&gt; They are descendants of the tribe of Bagot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, now if brother Merl's dad had been named Amos Judah, then these kids would be named Judah and they'd be part of the tribe of Judah. Except they're part of the tribe of Bagot. Got it. So that also means they have the full rights including inheritance. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; That's correct. Full rights of inheritance. Wow. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Does the Bible have something to say about that? In Romans 8, we read, "For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. And Paul explains with an illustration from the law and culture of his time. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you've received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, abba, father, the spirit itself, bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. It's about adoption. We have no record of any sort of formal proceeding, but Joseph clearly filled the role of an adoptive father, Joseph, who very clearly is of the tribe of Judah. Recall in the temple at age 12, Mary telling Jesus, she didn't say, "Joseph and I have been looking for you." She didn't say, "My husband and I." She said, "Your father and I have been looking for you. I spent a bit of our time about Judah, Yehuda, because it was important enough to God that he made sure Jesus was tied to him and helped underscore how important praise is to God. Dr. Gary Chapman, a Baptist minister, wrote a book about loving relationships in 1992. You may be familiar with the five love languages. He identified five primary ways we express love to one another. Although all five are important, people generally have one primary love language or maybe more than one. The five love languages in no particular order of importance that depends on the individual are words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time, physical touch. Since we are a created species in the image of God, it seems reasonable to me to to think that God also values these and our relationship to him. For example, brother Daniel's series on prayer emphasizes quality time. Isn't that what prayer is partly all about? Is building that relationship with quality time? Our current focus on praise certainly qualifies under the heading of words of affirmation. We know God likes praise. Isaiah 6 tells of a multitude of saraphim flying around the throne crying out, "Holy, holy, holy." As for the other three, Perhaps we'll see them in the future. For now, let's take a look at some examples of praise. In 2 Chronicles 5, we read of the dedication of Solomon's temple. In the first verses, we read of a procession of the sacrifice of a great number of animals. The ark containing only the stone tablets placed by Moses was carried into the Holy of Holies. In verse 11, we read, "It came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place, the Holy of Holies, where they had just placed the ark." It says, "For all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course." By course. You might recall in the gospels in the story of John the Baptist that his dad was a priest and went by course. He he went to Jerusalem from time to time when it was his shift, if you will. He spent his week or month or whatever down there and then went back home until his course came up again. So this verse in 2 Chronicles tells us a book was written many years after the events it describes because it it is careful to point out that they weren't doing it by course. Then in the Hebrew Bible Chronicles is the last book because it was the last book that was written. It came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course. Also the Levites, which were the singers of them, of Asaf, of Hemmon, and Yedithan, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having symbols and sulties and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them 120 priests sounding with trumpets. It came to pass. Is that text big enough for you to you can see that? Okay, you can always move up closer. It came to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one unity to make one sound to be heard doing or saying what in praising and thanking the Lord. And when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praised the Lord, saying, "For he is good. His mercy endures forever." Something happens. when we're in unity, not in discord, but with one voice, praising the Lord, that then and not until then, the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the Lord, so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud. For the glory of the Lord, now we'd say, the presence of the Lord, filled the house of God. Sounds a bit like Acts chapter 2. Now we are the temple. And when we are in unity and praising and worshiping the Lord, then the Holy Spirit can move in our midst just as it did in Solomon's day, just as it did in the upper room. Let's look at another example. This is many years later dur during the reign of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. What sort of man was this Jehoshaphat? We're going to talk about 2 Chronicles 17 tells us that the Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father David. He sought not unto Balum but sought the Lord God of his father. He walked in his commandments. His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord. It even tells us that in the third year of Jehoshaphat's reign, he sent to his princes to teach in the cities of Judah. And with them he sent Levites and with them priests and they taught in Judah and had the book of the law of the Lord with them and went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people. This is the kind of man that Jehoshaphat was. I want to read now from 2 Chronicles chapter 20. I'll I'll read a good portion of the chapter. It's about praise. That's our topic tonight. Remember that this is about praise. It came to pass after this also that the children of Moab and the children of Amman and with them other besides the Ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to battle. And there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, "There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea in this side of Syria, and behold, they be in Hazantamar, which is in Getty." I'll show you that location in a map in a moment. Yahos feared and called the officers of his considerable army. No, no. Visited the armory to be sure he had arrows and lances and chariots. No, no, no. The king set himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. This is a serious time. This is a serious threat. Judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the Lord. Even out of all the cities of Judah, they came to seek the Lord. The Lord wasn't their last resort. He was their first resort. It's a good example. Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court and gave a pep talk. Oh no, no, it doesn't say that. He said he's praying before the people. Oh Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen, and in thy hand? Is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee? Art not thou art God, who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham thy friend forever? and they dwell therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying, If when evil come upon us, as the sword of judgment or pestilence or famine, we stand before this house and in thy presence, for thy name is in this house. Baptism we take on his name. Thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction. Then wil thou hear and help. And now, Lord, behold, the children of Amman and Moab and Mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade when we were coming through. You told us to leave them alone. When they came out of their land of Egypt, but they turned from them and destroyed them not. Behold, I say, how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou hast given to us to inherit. Oh our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us, and we don't know what to do, but our eyes are upon thee. And all Judah, all Yehuda stood before the Lord with their little ones, their wives, their children. Then upon Yahazael, how many have read the prophet Yazael? There was no prophet Yahaziel. Upon Yahaziel, the son of Zachchariah, the son of Banayiah, the son of Yael, the son of Mataniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaf, came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation. Notice he's he's he's not a prophet, not that we know of. He he's probably a singer being a Levite and descended from Asaf, who wrote many of the psalms. And he said, "Hearken ye, oh Judah, ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and and thou, King Jehoshaphat." He brings it down from the nation to the city to the king, the leader. That's pretty impent this guy addressing the king like this. Thus saith the Lord unto you. Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God's. Tomorrow go ye down against them, opposite them. Behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz, and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of Yurel. You've got your opera glasses, you can you can read that. There's a map showing the lay of the land. We have Jerusalem up here. Here's Engeti down here. This is the Dead Sea. And this is the ascent of Ziz. I've covered it up with that red mark there, but there's a brook there that that goes up. And it goes up, you come out of there near Takcoa and then go north to Jerusalem. And that's about 11 miles or so between Jerusalem and Takcoa. Got that firmly implanted? You can refer to it now as we go on. You shall not need to fight in this battle. Set yourselves. Stand ye still. See the salvation of the Lord with you, oh Judah and Jerusalem. Fear not, nor be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, for the Lord will be with you. And Jehoshaphat, look at his humility. Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground. And following Jehoshaphat's example, all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord, worshiping the Lord. And the Levites of the children of the Kathites and of the children of the Korites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high. This is before anything's happened. There's this guy that's proclaimed this and they're rejoicing. They're celebrating. They're praising God. And they, king, priests, army, the inhabitants, the people rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Takcoa, again about 11 miles to the south. Is that with all the kids and stuff? That's maybe a three-hour walk, maybe a little longer. And as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Hear me, O Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be established. Believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper." This is faith before the fact. They're marching to see deliverance or engage in battle and see destruction. Hasn't happened yet. They just got this word. And when Jehoshaphat had consulted with the people, it's cooperation, agreement, unity. He appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army, and to say, "Praise the Lord, for his mercy endureth forever." And notice the timing. When they began to sing and to praise, the Lord sent ambushments against the children of Amman, Moab, and Mount Seir, which were come against Judah, and they were smitten. For the children, this is how the Lord did it, the children of Amman and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them. These are their allies. These three armies are together. And now these two are attacking the third. And when they had made an end to the inhabitants of Seir, Moab and Aman had killed those of Mount Seir. And I'm sure they suffered a few casualties. Everyone helped to destroy another. They couldn't stop killing each other. And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness there at Takcoa, they looked unto the multitude, and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth. None escaped. We see faith, commitment, leadership, all united as one. We see a people turning to the Lord. We see the Lord responding, his word being fulfilled when the people are focused on him, &gt;&gt; not on the problem that they're trying to solve and praising the Lord. And then and not until then, the Lord moves. In the case of the temple dedication, the presence of the Lord fills the place. In the case of the attack of the invading army against Judah, the Lord spreads the opposite of unity. He uses discord to weaken and destroy the invaders. Proverbs chapter 6 tells us that the Lord hates he that sweth discord among the brethren. Here we see what discord what lack of unity does. Our worship, our praise of the Lord is vital along with our unity. Remember Jesus prayer? Our pastor read that to us recently. Father, make them one as we are one. The book of Psalms is full of examples of praise and worship. The authors, there are many. It's not just David. The authors consistently encourage us to praise the Lord. I want to read you just a few examples, just a line here and there moving through the Psalms. Sing praises to the Lord which dwelleth in Zion. Declare among the people his doings. 18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, oh Lord, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. 223 But thou art holy, oh thou that inhabits the praises of Israel. 476 Sing praises to God. Sing praises. Sing praises to our king. Sing praises. The next verse, for God is the king of all the earth. Sing ye praises with understanding. 68:4 Sing unto the Lord. Sing praises to his name. Extol him that writeth upon the heavens by his name. Yah, and rejoice before him. You know, the last psalm in the book of Psalms that's attributed to David, not necessarily the last one he wrote, but in the order of the book, is Psalm 145. I I I'd like to read it. I'd also like to ask the worship team to come at this time. Now, don't get your hopes up. I'm not done yet. I want to mix things up a little bit this evening. Psalm 145 is called David's Psalm of praise. Notice the word praise doesn't occur in every verse, but every verse is praise. I will extol thee, my God, O king, and I will bless thy name forever and ever. Every day will I bless thee. I will praise thy name forever and ever. Great is the Lord, greatly to be praised, his greatness unsearchable. One generation shall praise thy works to another shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty, of thy wondrous works. Men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts, and I will declare thy greatness. They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. The Lord is gracious, full of compassion, slow to anger, and of great mercy. The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord, and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of thy glory, of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power, to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. Thy dominion endureth through all generations. The Lord upholdeth all that fall, raisth up all those that be bowed down. The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest thine hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing. The Lord is righteous in all his ways, holy in all his works. The Lord is nigh to them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him. He also will hear their cry and will save them. The Lord preserveth all them that love him, but all the wicked will he destroy. My mouth shall speak of the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever. You know, a lot of times what may be spoken up here about our lives and conduct can't always be immediately applied. You have to go outside and and do it right. But it's absolutely appropriate to practice what we're preaching or teaching or sharing this evening right here, right now. Verse 21 of David's psalm, his psalm of praise is on the screen. Let's sing. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. I will sing. [Music] I will sing. [Music] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord. With my mouth will I make known [Music] thy faithfulness. Thy faithfulness with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. I will sing. I will sing. [Music] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord. With my mouth will I make known [Music] thy faithfulness. Thy faithfulness with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. [Music] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. I will sing. I will sing. [Music] I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord. We should always be ready to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's look at a few more examples as we continue through the Psalms. Psalm 68:32, sing unto the Lord, ye kingdoms of the earth. Sing praises unto the Lord. Saha means think about that. I will declare forever Psalm 75, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. We will not hide them from their children, showing generation to come the praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done. Psalm 92. It's a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, to sing praises unto thy name, oh most high. Psalm 108, I will praise thee, oh Lord, among the people. I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. Psalm 135, praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing praises unto his name, for it is pleasant. It's a good thing to give thanks. The Lord is good. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. Well, let's sing in praise and worship again. This time about the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; For your mercy fails me. All my days I've been held in your hands. &gt;&gt; From the moment that I wake up till I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of God. Is this true for you? All my life, &gt;&gt; all my life you have been faithful. [Music] &gt;&gt; All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, [Music] I will sing &gt;&gt; of the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; I love your voice. &gt;&gt; You have led me through the fire. In darkest nights, you are close like no other. &gt;&gt; I've known you as a father. I've known you as a friend. I have lived in the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Worship and praise everyone. All my life you have been faithful. [Music] &gt;&gt; All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God. the goodness of God. He's so good to us, undeserving, but we are his children. He's helping us grow, to mature. Can't help but love him. A couple more lines from the Psalms. 144. I will sing a new song unto thee, oh God. Sometimes we like to hear the songs we're familiar with. I will sing a new song, oh God. Upon a sultry and an instrument of 10 strings will I sing praises unto thee. God continues to inspire. He didn't stop inspiring a 100 years ago or 50 years ago or 300 years ago. He's still inspiring today. &gt;&gt; Psalm 146, while I live will I praise the Lord. I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 147 Praise ye the Lord. It is good to sing praises unto our God. It is pleasant. Praises calmly while I live while I praise the Lord. You You've all heard my testimony from a few years ago when I had the heart attack. I was sitting over here roughly where your wife is sitting and we Heather and I would come into service and I just didn't have any air. this this heart attack happened on Thanksgiving and or the day after and and so we'd be worshiping and I'd get maybe the first few lines out kind of singing and then after that I was just lip syncing because I had no air. I had no breath. One Wednesday night there was no prayer line. There was no particular thing going on really. It was just a good Wednesday night service. And towards the end of the service there, we were worshiping and I just felt like the Lord was telling me, L, just raise your hands and worship me. Just praise me. Well, yeah, that's why we're here. So, so that's what I did that Sunday morning. The people that were sitting near where Heather and I sat didn't want to sit there anymore because I didn't run out of air. I was singing the whole entire 25 minutes or so that we were singing. While I had breath, I was praising the Lord. While I had life, I was praising the Lord. I'm 75 years old, right? We're told about 70. So, I used to say that that I was well, I don't know what I used to say because I'm old and I forgot, but I'm on bonus time. I'm on bonus time. The Lord's given me breath. The Lord's given me life. So, like the Psalms say, while you have breath, while you have life, praise the Lord. Like we just sang, one last thing. We're told that hallelujah is a Hebrew word or phrase. It's actually two words meaning praise the Lord. Right? You've been told that. You've been taught that. I don't imagine anybody's here above the age of six or seven that's not familiar with that. But have you ever done a word search of the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible, and found it? Do a word search? I did many times. I never found it. What's all this about hallelujah? Did you know that the final five psalms all begin and end with hallelujah? The opening words, opening phrases, hallelujah. And the last phrase of each of those psalms is hallelujah. But if you look in your Bible, it doesn't say hallelujah because the translators translated it. Well, a note in the Bible we used for morning devotions indicated this. I just discovered this yesterday morning. Being the trusting soul that I am, I looked it up in the Hebrew. Yeah, right. I'm not sure who edited this edition. Right. Sure enough, those five psalms begin and end with hallelujah. So, our closing scripture reading for this evening will be the last psalm number 150. It's said that the last five psalms were read during the dedication of the second temple and and we're coming up to the 60th anniversary dedication of of this church. Psalm one, the very beginning, the book ending the psalm. Psalm 1 begins with blessed is the man whose delight is in the law of the Lord who meditates in it day and night. The opening psalm is one of the Lord blessing us. Well, let's read this closing psalm. You may please join me in reading it. I'll put it on the screen. I've taken the liberty to substitute the word hallelujah where it occurs in the original. And it's a call for us to bless the Lord, to praise him. Psalms begin with the Lord blessing us and his very last word is hallelujah. Us blessing him. Psalm 150. And I'll read it, but feel free to make your voice heard. Don't lip sync with me. Hallelujah. Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts. Praise him according to his excellent greatness. Praise him with the sound of the trumpet. Praise him with the sultry and harp. Praise him with the timberal and dance. Anybody here starting to get enough freedom to dance? Praise him with stringed instruments and organs. Praise him on the loud symbols. Praise him on the high sounding symbols. That literally means the clanging symbols. Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is the closing song. That's as long as we have breath, we should praise him. Remember Leia? In her darkest hour of pain and rejection, she turned to the Lord in praise. So much so that Jesus came as the lion of the tribe of praise. Why are we here this evening? Let's close this portion of the service as we sing about that very purpose. Here I am to worship. Light of the world, you step down into darkness. [Music] Open my eyes. Let me see. &gt;&gt; Beauty that may this heart adore you. Hope of a life spent with you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God. You're all together lovely. Allto together worthy. All together wonderful to me. [Music] &gt;&gt; King of all days. Oh so highly exalted. Glorious in heaven above. [Music] Oh hly you came to the earth you ced and all for love's sake became for oh here I am to worship here I am to bow down here I am to say that you're My God, you're all together lovely, worthy, allto together wonderful, &gt;&gt; wonderful to me. And I'll never know how much it costs to see my sin upon that cross. I'll never know how much to see my s to see my s upon I'll never know I'll never know how much it cost to see myself upon that cross. I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin upon that cross. Here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that You're my God. &gt;&gt; You're all together lovely. All together worthy. All together wonderful to me. &gt;&gt; Here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God. You're all together lovey. Allto together worthy. Allto together wonderful to me. I'll never know how much it costs to see my sin upon that cross. I'll never know how much it costs to see my sin upon that cross. Amen. you know, of all the things that I know of, I can come up here and I can open this Bible and I can read the words in this Bible and I can expound on the words, but it really can't compare to the unity that comes when we worship together. We may see the scriptures different. We may not see the things the same. But when we truly worship together, then we can unite. Some people like the old songs. The people that like the new ones sing the old ones to the Lord, too. The people that like like the the old songs and when we sing the new songs, sing the new ones to the Lord, too. The Bible says, "Whatever you do, do it unto the Lord." I tell you, when brother Lia was telling that story, I like to I like to tell that story about Jehoshaphat when he was putting together this army to go out and meet the enemy. And it was like like if I was Jehoshaphat, it was like Christopher, Zeke, and Daniel, and Isaac back there. Get these kids up there, these these young men up there, big, strong, intimidating kids. put them out there in the front and say, "Okay, give them a sword and and they're there. They're battle hardened. They're ready to they're ready to fight and these are our best warriors and set them out there." And then the Lord comes through a prophecy and says, "Send out Katie first." &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. But but she's she's pregnant. Send out hope with her. They can't fight, but they can sing [Music] and they can worship. And that's exactly what happened in that story in 2 Chronicles. He had the battle in array and the word came to one of these worship leaders, a prophecy, and said, "Send out the worshippers. Send out the singers." And they were no match, brother Ly. They were no match for that worship. And I love the way brother Lyall said and everyone was in unity. And you watch what happened. They won the battle. They didn't what did what did he say? That that the battle is the Lord's. And it was. Let's all stand. [Music] Josiah &gt;&gt; awesome. &gt;&gt; He is. So let's just worship him. He is awesome. So now we've heard the word. Now let's just worship him. &gt;&gt; My God is awesome. He can move mountains. Keep me in the valley. Hide me from the rain. &gt;&gt; My God is awome. heals me when I'm broken. &gt;&gt; I've been forever. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again. &gt;&gt; My God is awesome. He can move mountains. Keep me in the valley. Guide me from the rain. My God is awome. Heals me when I'm broken. And strength where I've been weaken forever. He reigns. &gt;&gt; Oh my God is awesome. Oh, awesome. Awesome. Awesome. My God is awesome. Awome. Awome. Awome. My God is awesome. Savior of the whole world, giver of salvation. By his stripes I heal. Oh my God is awesome. Today I am forgi. His grace is why I'm living. Praise his holy name. My God is awome. &gt;&gt; Yes. Awesome. Awesome. [Music] Awesome. My God is awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Sing that again. My God is awome. [Music] Awome. Awesome. [Music] Awome. My God is awome. Awome. Awome. Awome. [Music] He is awesome. &gt;&gt; Isn't he great? Just give the Lord a clap offering and tell him you love him. [Applause] We always think, "I want to go to battle. I'm going to draw my sword, Satan. I'm going to I'm going to take you out. And right here with brother L's sermon, it was like, praise him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just worship him and then watch the demons flee. Why? Watch everything just kind of fall away. Well, I have problems with this. I have problems with that. Don't worry about the problems. Just praise him. &gt;&gt; Well, but I'm struggling, pastor. I'm struggling with this. I know. Just praise him. &gt;&gt; Just praise him. And you and you watch. You just get your mind focused on him, your mind praising him. And and then we come together, brother Jonathan, and and now we have two people praising him. And now we have 20 people. Now we have 50 people praising him all together. And then everything just all the bad stuff just just goes away. You know, it it's it's just away right now. Just keep it away, friends, as you go. Brother Jeremy, can I pull you away from your lineage? As brother Lyall said, that was good. That was really good. But I really like that adoption. That was excellent. [Applause] Made me think. Believe Brother Lyle read out of uh Romans chapter 8 that talks about You know what? Let me let me just as brother Jeremy's coming, let me just read it. Maybe get our minds softened and and ready for brother Jeremy to pray. believe it's Romans believe it was Romans 8 by the L. I think it was almost there. [Music] Here it is. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." Amen. Let's bow our hands. Gracious heavenly father, we just love you, Lord. We thank you, Lord, that we can we can look to you, the author and finisher of our faith, and even seek that city that is to come whose author and maker is God. We just count it a privilege to gather again. Bless each one here. Have mercy on us as we travel and go our separate ways. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And let us be your light, Lord, whenever you need us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In your precious name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy, [Music] oh Lord, to receive glory, glory and honor, glory. Glory and honor and power. &gt;&gt; Sing thou art worthy again. Oh, thou art worthy. Oh, thou art worthy. Thou art worthy, oh Lord. Oh yes, to receive glory. Oh, glory and honor. Glory and honor and power. Oh, for thou hast created, hast all things created. Thou hast created all things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And for thy pleasure they are created. Thou art worthy, oh Lord, with all our hearts tonight. Oh yes, thou art worthy. Oh, thou are worthy. Thou art worthy, oh Lord. Oh, to receive glory. Oh, glory and honor. Glory and honor and power. For thou hast created, hast all things created.
