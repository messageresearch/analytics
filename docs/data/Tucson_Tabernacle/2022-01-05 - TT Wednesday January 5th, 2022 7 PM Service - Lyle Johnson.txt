true for me god's mercy rewrote my life and i'm so thankful for that and it's such a pleasure to be here this evening amongst my siblings in christ because we're all part of the family of god it's a wonderful way i think to start the new year this first wednesday evening service of the year and you know we're so privileged to live in this land and even more so that we have life with purpose that we can recognize that purpose we're told in the revelation of jesus christ and we sang it just now that we're created for god's pleasure both isaiah and jeremiah remind us that we're clay and the potter's wheel and we've been made aware of and are partakers of the marvelous plan of salvation looking to that ultimate redemption we long for that day but patiently toil until it arrives maybe it'll be tonight maybe it won't be for many years but it doesn't matter because we don't live wondering if it will come we know it will come we have that assurance let's join our hearts together in prayer this evening lord jesus it is such an awesome honor to be here with your people this evening at the start of a new year lord that we can look to you the author and finisher of our faith lord and we know that we're secure in your arms and in your love lord jesus i pray that tonight you'd help lyle johnson to just get out of here and that you might speak words that would speak to the hearts of your people that you'd answer needs and questions lord and that you just somehow draw us all ever closer to yourself and we thank you we thank you and we thank you again in jesus precious name amen before we're seated i guess i should get this turned on yeah that's working let's read a short section from john's gospel chapter six we'll begin at the eighth verse the occasion is the feeding of the five thousand and the subsequent cleanup effort i'm glad jesus didn't like to leave a mess behind because if he did he probably would have left me behind the feeding of the 5000 is related all four gospel accounts we're told that the passover was nigh this is spring jesus has just taught the crowd it has compassion on them the day has passed it's now towards evening it's been a long day for everyone there jesus asked his disciples for food for this very large crowd knowing of course that they didn't have any so let's join them one of his disciples andrew simon peter's brother said to him there's a lad here which has five barley loaves and two small fish but what are they among so many notice the disciples didn't have any food with them nor apparently did anyone else except a boy in the crowd no one expected the sermon to be so long i guess anyone here bring food with you no okay it's okay i'm not gonna be long but if you'd been that boy if you'd been that youth would you've been willing to give up your lunch to some guys who hung around a long-winded preacher and didn't bring their own food well jesus said make the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand i think it's safe to assume that women and children sad as well jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks father this may not seem like much but we're thankful for all that you provide he distributed the bread to the disciples and the disciples distributed it to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would as much as they wanted as much as they could eat reminds me a bit of the first deacons in the book of acts when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost therefore they the disciples gathered the fragments together and filled 12 baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did notice these people just witnessed a miracle they didn't just see it they ate it and based on that and no doubt aided by the words jesus spoke decided this is of a truth that prophet that should come unto the world they declare that jesus must be the one moses has indicated would come because of the miracle the sign the bread when jesus perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone please be seated jesus knew that someday he would become the king not just a king but not yet he had to first redeem his people so he slipped away and hid himself matthews and mark's accounts of this episode inform us that he was praying on that mountain he then walks on the water in the midst of a storm a contrary wind peter meets him on the water they arrive at the shore of guinesseret about halfway between tiberius and capernaum where jesus starts healing people and what else happens that same day that he's starting to heal people there in ganesha the day after the miracle of the loaves and the fishes the very same people that saw that miracle seek him out and they find him the very ones who based on that miracle that that sign had declared he must be the one moses wrote about the messiah our ancestors ate manna bread from heaven we ate miracle bread and fish it's got to be him i just love this these are broken fallible human beings i see myself so often and the unnamed people that are represented in the gospel and in the bible they're real to me because they're so like me so these people find him and we'll read again skipping now down to verse 28 then said they but some of the men who had eaten of the miraculous loaves and fishes unto jesus what shall we do that we might work the works of god how can we make bread like you did yesterday you made it look easy and they listened but he didn't give them the answer they expected jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent say what no no no no no it's making bread and man and stuff that that's the works of god we're after so because they didn't get the answer they wanted they they said therefore unto jesus what sign are you going to show us that we can see and believe you what are you going to work hello excuse me guys remember what you said yesterday just yesterday based on the miracle you saw jesus must be that promised prophet hello why did you just ask how to work this kind of a miracle if you didn't already believe him and they go on uh our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat jesus come on let's get back on topic bread we want to get free bread from heaven like our forefathers like yesterday that's the work we want come on how'd you do that what's the secret so jesus said unto them bread is that what this is about you want to talk about bread okay listen up verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father gives you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god as he which comes down from heaven and gives life unto the world then they said unto him oh now he's talking lord evermore give us this bread don't stop after one day not after 40 years let's keep this good thing going and jesus said unto them you're not listening okay ready for a shock how about this i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst wow we're so often focused on our short existence here on this earth and so easily overlook the really important things no let me restate that i all too often become focused on my short existence on this earth and i frequently overlook the important things well this event followed by jesus discourse on the bread of life got me to thinking uh oh always dangerous what was the significance of bread in first century galilee or the province of judea how was bread made at that time what part of a daily diet was it give us this day our daily bread was part of what we call the lord's prayer so it must have been a staple what were the breads like then compared to the breads we eat today was the grain different even if it was does that make any difference in the context of the parables the illustrations that jesus used for the spiritual lessons that he was sharing and by the way what are those bread-based lessons bread is composed of four basic ingredients flour water salt and yeast jesus spoke of all four of these ingredients in the gospels as well of course his bread itself a little personal note in june of this year actually of last year heather and i drove to reno nevada to attend the high school graduation of lily johnson our son josiah's youngest child during that visit we saw that psy had recently started baking some homemade bread he has a really high stress job and this helped him relax a little bit besides that the bread was really good well there was a copy of this book on the kitchen counter so i noted it when we got home i got on amazon and bought a copy i sent him a photo of me holding my copy of it a few days later was father's day a package arrived with a proofing basket a dutch oven and a couple of accessories for bread making so i realized he had to start to learn to bake bread uh oh but but but i digress back on topic we see the four ingredients of basic bread flour water salt yeast jesus spoke of all these but this is wednesday we need to pick one to explore in our limited time now i've learned in the experiments that i've been performing in our chemistry lab at you know heather's kitchen that red dough uses a lot of flour a lot of water a little salt and a tiny amount of yeast so for tonight let's go with yeast the king james version of the bible uses the term leaven apparently yeast wasn't part of the vocabulary 400 years ago well here are some photos from one of my recent bread making episodes the stuff i'm making here is called poolish rhymes with foolish which is how i kind of felt when i was starting to do this stuff poolish is a wet sponge-like pre-ferment used to make some kinds of bread or to try and make such bread well i use 500 grams that's a little over a pound of all-purpose flour the same amount of warm water but a mere .4 of a gram less than an eighth of a teaspoon just a generous pinch of leaven of yeast i mixed the tiny amount of yeast into the heap of dry flour added the water got my hands all goopy mixing this stuff up it's really sticky anyway then i covered it and let it sit overnight and look what happened point four of a gram of yeast in a kilogram of flour and water that's one part in 2500 and after only eight or so hours it's grown and spread changes volume texture flavor what's actually happened is that the yeast the leaven has altered and consumed some of the flour it's thrived feeding on the wheat and in the process released carbon dioxide as gas produced some amount of alcohol in other words it's fermented the dough jesus spoke about this the effect of leaven recorded in the gospels of matthew and luke both gospels are relating a series of parables that jesus was using to illustrate what he called the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is like the kingdom of god is like this by the way a kingdom's not a democracy or a republic you don't get to vote he makes the rules and one illustration of this kingdom found in matthew 13 jesus talks about a farmer's seeds falling on various soils some sprouted some didn't some didn't last very long we know the story he tells another story of an enemy sowing weeds among a field of wheat the kingdom of god we're all familiar with these stories but but he goes on matthew 13 33 another parable spake unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened what's he talking about here all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable he didn't speak to them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet and this is actually a paraphrase of psalm 78 2 saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world leaven is consistently used in the old testament as being a symbol of something bad perhaps even evil one exception is the wave offering detailed in leviticus 23 where the bread must contain leaven but this bread is for the priests it's not to be burnt on the altar of sacrifice otherwise we we read in leviticus 2 about grain offerings and no we have to be careful with the english of the early 1600s the king james version consistently says meat when the hebrew is meal or grain it's not about animal parts it's about grain it says in leviticus 2 11 no meat that's meal or grain offering which you shall bring unto the lord shall be made with leaven with yeast you shall burn no leaven nor any honey and in the offering of the lord made by fire here we see that one absolutely positively never offers a grain offering with yeast if it's to be burnt on the altar period this includes breads wafers and so forth whatever form it might take but other than burnt offerings where are one else's leaven forbidden anywhere remember we're looking for context something to help us better understand jesus parable of leaven in the kingdom of heaven during the celebration of passover and the seven day feast following it is to be no leaven found in any of the dwellings of the faithful the consequences can be fatal we read in exodus 12 for example starting at verse 17 ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in the selfsame day the day following the passover have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt therefore shall ye observe this day and your generations by an ordinance until you reach the promised land no no by an ordinance until the messiah comes no no it's to be observed forever in the first month that's called aviv just like tel aviv it means spring and our calendar it's in march or april on the 14th day of the month at even the setting of the sun the rising of the full moon you shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even and not only are you not to partake of leaven during this feast but seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eats that which is leavened even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel whether he be a stranger or born in the land seven days reminds me of seven church ages no leaven is to be found in all israel during the seven days after the sacrifice of the passover lamb there should be no leaven in the body of christ throughout the seven church ages following his sacrifice his death on our behalf this rule in israel about levin applies to both jew born in the land and gentile stranger no leaven in your dwelling so you don't even accidentally consume any it's important enough to god he has moses repeated in the very next chapter exodus 13 7 unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters this is serious spring cleaning even if you live in a tent in the dusty wilderness of the sinai when we lived in israel heather and i some 47 years ago we dwelt for a number of months a couple of years actually adjacent to an ultra-orthodox jewish community in netanya called kiryat sans kyriad is just a hebrew term that means a a settlement or a town or a neighborhood some of our number were permitted to live within the borders of that sex area specifically my brother noel with his family and my parents just before pesach just before passover usually the day before remember the jewish day begins at sundown when two stars are visible a representative a rabbi from the curios would come to brother quinton erickson he was our designated leader at that time the rabbi would have a legal enforceable contract a deed and he'd sell the dwellings the entire curio the entire settlement he'd sell it and everything in it including the medicine cabinets and everything to brother clinton for some nominal token summit a dollar two dollars something but for a specific limited time until the end of the feast of unleavened bread why it may be that a speck of leaven fell in a place where it couldn't be found or cleaned perhaps a tiny crack in a kitchen floor or behind a cabinet trapped to the wall or maybe there was a non-kosher ingredient especially leaven that might have been contained in some medicine that somebody had in their medicine chest how many know exactly how any medicines that you take or buy are formulated and what their actual total contents are they took this command of moses very seriously this this rule that's been established three and a half thousand years ago and they took it so seriously that well there's to be no leaven found in my dwelling i'll sell my dwelling so even though i'm staying there it's not on me if there's living in here after i've scrubbed it and cleaned it and done my best and what would happen if someone needed some of that medicine in the medicine chest perhaps someone had asthma and they needed some relief well what would they do they would they they or someone close to them would drop by brother quinton and of course they can't just ask can i have some of that medicine that's in the medicine chest in the house where i'm living because i can't breathe right now i've got asthma no no no you can't ask for it because it might have something forbidden in it so you just combine and say i'm having a tough time breathing i think there might be something that could believe that you you know what i mean and then brother clinton would say oh would you like to have some of my asthma medicine i've got some conveniently placed in a medicine chest in my house where you're living and so they could go and take their medicine and everything's kosher right now at the conclusion of pesach at the seven day feast if brother quinton had wanted to continue to be the landlord well now we'd have to pay the real price for the curiat you know a few million bucks not going to happen so this ensured that the property would be redeemed returned to the original owners at the conclusion of the seven days how appropriate that the possession loss the ownership transfer was only temporary and that redemption would occur at the conclusion of the feast of unleavened bread seven days seven church ages i'm sure you see it look up your redemption is near 3 500 years after moses recorded that no ye should be found in their houses they took it so seriously 3 500 years seems like a long time but in the context of eternity it's nothing so with this is background what's jesus talking about in this one-liner parable let's let's read it again another parable spake unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven yeast which a woman took and hid concealed and three measures of meal till the hole was completely leavened is he saying a little gospel goes a long way some commentator suggests this is a meeting john wesley thought so he wrote his commentary the bible three measures this was the quantity which they usually baked at once until the whole was leavened thus will the gospel leaven the world and grace the christian that's what john wesley thought about that but if this is so why is it being propagated by an anonymous woman rather than say a priest or a disciple why is it being concealed rather than mixed openly why so secretive and what's the result is this consistent with the rest of the body of scripture regarding leaven jesus had just said the kingdom of heaven is like a field of wheat which an enemy sowed weeds told the field workers let them grow together until the harvest in this set of parables he's talking about problems that occur in the earthly phase of the kingdom of god so it may be that jesus is sounding a warning let's look a while after teaching this parable jesus again speaks to his students about the topic of leaven this takes place after another feeding this time of four thousand and it's just a few days before peter says thou art the christ the son of the living god they're together again crossing the lake in a boat matthew tells us matthew 16 5 when his disciples were come to the other side they'd forgotten to take bread oops hey matthew weren't you supposed to get the bread this time oh no no it was judas turn me i i thought peter was bringing it or maybe james just like us then jesus said unto them take heed listen up pay careful attention now and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees and they reasoned among themselves saying it's because we've taken no bread yeah now i think about it it was james's turn these are real people which when jesus perceived he said unto them oh ye of little faith guys really uh oh he's scolding us again we're missing something he thinks should be obvious by now he sure looks exasperated why reason you among yourselves that she brought no bread do ye not yet understand guys are you really so dense haven't you been paying any attention neither remember the five loaves of the 5 000 and how many baskets you took up oh i know that was 12. neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets you took up how is it that you do not understand i can't believe it that i spake it not to you concerning bread that you should beware of leaven of the pharisees and the sadducees do those priests and lawyers look like bakers to you really then understood they how he made them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the pharisees and the sadducees the doctrine the teaching salvation by works by adhering to a set of rules and especially related to the teaching of traditions that superseded the law and the prophets in our day brother branham would call this sort of thing creeds and dogmas from from the token in 1963 he's talking about the infilling of the holy spirit he says you can't have no leaven when this mark the holy spirit when this mark has come into your house this token you cannot have a leaven in it that's the world you can't love god and mammon the world at the same time all the cares of the world all that cares and your creeds your fusses your difference you're coming to jesus christ similarly and god's only provided place of worship brother branham comments about the passover from deuteronomy 16. in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it what does that typify in the sacrifice he says don't mix it with any creed it's got to be the word no leavened bread leaven is that you know what eleven is in anything a little eleven leavens the whole lump the whole lump is the body you can't put one speck of denomination or creed into christ no sir won't work denomination is building walls around your particular interpretation or revelation or whatever other excuse we use to divide and separate ourselves from other christians creed creed is a concise statement of a particular interpretation usually it's something foundational the intent is not to substitute or divide but to distill and explain and to summarize but all too often such statements are used to draw battle lines locate areas of disagreement rather than agreement fussing fighting feuding separating dividing misunderstanding in our day in the context of what we call the message there are plenty of unwritten creeds floating around as well as many denominations not taking their guidance from some sort of headquarters but all too often seeming to take direction from other than god's holy spirit too often building around personalities when we should be building on the foundation of the person of jesus christ much like the days of the judges in israel when every man did what was right in his own sight there was no king either way central leadership or no central leadership can lead to chaos and destruction missing the mark sin in other words we can't alter the bible to make it say what we wanted to say to better conform to our idea of what it ought to say or what we wish it meant we have to conform to the word not the other way around it's god's kingdom not a republic not a democracy in luke's gospel the 12th chapter opens with yet another observation about leaven in the meantime when there were dads together a few dozen curious onlookers oh no a small crowd with nothing better to do oh no gather together an innumerable multitude of people and so much that they trod one upon another this isn't some rap concert in houston a jostling mass of muslim pilgrims walking around a cube in mecca these are people anxious to hear the words of jesus sometimes i wonder how anxious am i he began to say unto his disciples first of all beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy this is just another characteristic of that leaven not its only characteristic understand the meaning of hypocrite in those days was acting that is a person performing in a play for example was a hypocrite but had no negative connotation that was his job he was a play actor one who pretends so jesus is saying that some pharisees were insincere they were play acting brother branham referred to such as make believers let's go back once more to the example of bread dough and yeast what if you mix your basic dough just just flour in water and let it sit no leaven added what happens any beakers out here it begins to ferment anyway that's how you make sourdough starter no use required well well how how how does that work it happens because there are tiny microbes of yeast that's it's a one-celled plant right in the wild they attach themselves to the wheat and barley and so forth if you get table grapes and sometimes they have a little bit of a white powdery thing on the outside surface that's wild yeast so these these microbes of yeast attach themselves to the wheat and they feed on it or they wait for the chance to feed on it sourdough starter is just cultivating the wild yeast it's not magic it's biochemistry right peter yeah he's shaking he said yes he's got a phd in that stuff he knows if there's enough wheat there will be a tiny amount of yeast of leaven and if you feed it give it the right environment it'll grow astonishingly fast just like i showed you earlier this evening when i was making poolish a pre-ferment and preparation of making bread i created an environment for the yeast for the leaven to thrive however here we want to be sure we don't have an environment amongst our fellowship that encourages the growth of yeast of leaven amongst us recall from a word to the church which we reviewed here a couple of months ago brother branham tells us love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in set him down cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poise and stuff and he'll start to the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be safe too or that woman ever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of god to do so now do you remember that the enemy will come when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all remember the story of the first nations leader in canada who spoke with the two dogs fighting inside of him which one wins one gets fed the jewish culture refers to each one of us having inside a good inclination and a bad inclination paul deals with this topic in the context of levin twice in his letters in his very first letter galatians he wrote about those telling the gentile converts that they had to convert to judaism to be saved the males had to be circumcised and so forth but his advice to the galatians is applicable to us today a thousand nine hundred and seventy years after he wrote it we we may deal with different issues different conflicts different misunderstandings different false teachings but the same spirits are behind them let's read from galatians 5 starting at the first verse stand fast therefore and the liberty where with christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage we're free to serve not forced to serve behold i paul say unto you that if you be circumcised based on these teachings these guys are spreading around christ shall profit you nothing if you substitute the law attempting to earn salvation and substitute it for grace for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he's a debtor to do the whole law christ has become of no effect unto you whosoever if you were justified by the law you're fallen from grace you've made a bad choice we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith this is exactly what brother john mcfadden preached about sunday morning israel's choice in exodus 19 accepting law instead of grace rules and place of faith for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision doesn't matter if you're jew or gentile but faith which works by what love his love for us which we should reflect as the moon reflects the sun you did run well who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion this teaching this giant step backwards comes not of him that calls you instead it's an example of how a little leaven leavens the whole lump i have confidence in you through the lord that you will be none otherwise minded you'll come back to the truth but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be and i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yet suffer persecution then is the offense of the cross ceased i would they were even cut off which trouble you for brethren you've been called unto liberty you're free you're not under bondage you're not being forced or coerced only use not liberty that freedom for an occasion to the flesh to fulfill the lusts and desires of your old nature the flesh that you must overcome daily but by love not obligation but love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love without leaven that's how jesus loves us if you bite and devour one another take heed you be not consumed one of another that leaven that yeast feeds off of you starve it brother branham touches on this last verse using the context of leaven in a total deliverance when uh one member would talk against the other member you know that's wrong you're commanded to pray for one another not to talk against one another but to love one another and if someone's down let's pick him up help him that makes us a unified group of believers now when we don't obey that then we don't obey god and we displease god and therefore our church our people cannot prosper the church can't go on because they're disunified together as jesus said a little leaven leavens the lump later writing to the corinthians about a particularly offensive development in their midst paul admonishes the church to confront the sin he speaks of judgment in the body and that our attitude in all of this must reflect the nature of jesus christ that's my words my summary but read the whole chapter first corinthians 5 and see but let's focus now not on the particulars of the sin not on how to deal with the person or people involved with it or committing it but focus on our own attitude while focus on your attitude in the midst of this sort of thing the danger of leaven in our midst don't feed it not just as manifested in the sin but in how insiduously it the effect of the leaven not the sin itself may spread yeast which was concealed hidden in three measures of meal as jesus said these would be our closing scriptures first corinthians chapter 5 we'll start at verse 6. you're glorying paul tells the corinthians in the midst of all this your boasting is not good oh yeah that's that may be some bad stuff but look how tolerant we are know ye not that a little levin leavens the whole lump don't let down your guard paul's shouting johnny get out of the street there's a car coming purge out cleanse thoroughly this isn't passive you don't kick back and say jesus do this right purging is hard work paul tells him purge it's hard work it's scrubbing it's removing purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feasts not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth christ the bread which came down from heaven to give us life is represented by the unleavened bread of passover did you ever look closely at the matzah the unleavened bread used at passover of all the possible forms of unleavened bread what form is used maybe jesus paid it all softly notice it has stripes it has piercings what a reminder of the words of david in the psalms and of the prophecies of isaiah and zachariah not about the passover not about unleavened bread but about the messiah jesus our passover sacrifice david said they pierced my hands and my feet psalms 22 16. isaiah wrote with his stripes were healed isaiah 53 5 zachariah prophesied they shall look upon me whom they have pierced zechariah 12 10 repentance again as our brother john spoke about last sunday jesus offered himself for our sins paying the price for our redemption at that very passover observance it's such a clear indicator a beacon really like the powerful being from a lighthouse that we must avoid the leaven paul says of malice and wickedness the old leaven of our sinful nature being unkind talking about rather than praying for one another gossip rumor misunderstandings instead of such leaven we should replace it paul says with sincerity and truth expressed by loving our neighbor not because we must but because we are free and choose to do so we must always be careful to keep the leaven out of our own lives lyle has to work at that lyle has to purge that to purge ourselves dying to our flesh daily we're to crucify our old nature take up our cross daily as jesus said to be sincere not play acting as he talked about the pharisees not faking it to not be or have any part over with the woman in the parable the one who seeks to hide the leaven in our midst until it grows and penetrates and consumes us jesus paid it all is a hymn first penned by elvina hall in the spring of 1865. she wrote it in the fly leaf of a hymnal in baltimore maryland right at the end of the civil war in america perhaps we can sing this together as brother aaron comes to close tonight's [Music] child service weakness watch and pray find in me thine all in all jesus paid it [Music] sin had left a crimson stain he washed it white as snow lord now [Music] indeed alone [Music] jesus faded all all to him i own sin had left a crimson stain he washed it white as snow for nothing could have on whereby thy grace [Music] jesus paid it all all to him i own sin had left a crimson stain [Music] him completely jesus died my soul to say my lips shall still be [Music] sin had left a crime oh jesus paid [Music] all to jesus i surrendered [Music] all to him [Music] him [Music] save your eyes [Music] all to jesus [Music] all forsaken take jesus take me [Music] search me [Music] and know my heart [Music] know my thoughts i pray see if there be somewhere [Music] me [Music] from [Music] cleanse me from every sin sin is unbelief and that unbelief then manifests itself in many different ways and that's that it starts with some unbelief that's really what god was dealing with he said it's unbelief and then it manifests like love and it just begins to move and in no time you'll find this comes up and this comes up brother branham tells us he said go back to where you left him and find him there again and make your heart right before him and let him do that work it's not in our good deeds it's not saying i'm going to keep this i'm going to do that because you can't do that by yourself it takes the holy spirit holy ghost revival starts in me if you get that [Music] me [Music] me [Music] our names [Music] the greatest blessing that we could receive is a cleansing of ourselves and letting god then be let him come forth out of us sometimes the blessings we look lord i want some more of this but that doesn't help the situation many times it increases our trouble but say lord let me empty of myself let me get on and let christ have i believe that's what he was saying you saw i could feed the ten thousand the twelve thousand you saw he said but there's things that i'm teaching you're showing that are even greater than that and that is i am the bread of life in you and he that drinks of this warranties of this bread will no wise thirst or hunger again and that's that's the satisfying portion if we'll stand together you say lord that's me that's who i want to be that's how i'll be on whatever it takes i'll be willing to do lord we you see the hands raised and the hearts hear each one of us lord as you've spoken today and just examine our own selves as individuals saying lord what's in it what's in me that is causing this that would cause this eleven to to grow in my life or things that would come out say where did that come from how did that get in here we go back and say cleanse us lord wash us make us whole and let the life of god that unleavened bread the very life growing us it's our prayer lord we thank you for that lord in jesus christ's name amen you know when he speaks to us this way it's because he's merciful and he's letting mercy rewrote my life [Music] rewrote my life i should have fallen my soul cast [Music] [Music] oh mercy [Music] my i should have fallen my soul cast him god's mercy rewrote my love and it's amazing grace how sweet this word of god today wasn't to condemn you but it was his grace and mercy reaching saying child my son my daughter this is where the help comes from i once was lost but now i'm [Music] that taught my heart to fear and embrace my fears [Music] how precious did that great [Music] [Music] through many [Music] i [Music] uh [Music] when every one of the redeemed are gathered together after going through all you've gone through through a purging through a cleansing throat washing to be standing [Music] now let's just thank him and praise him for the word he's given to us today praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god brother branham used to say i don't want no trouble at the gate i don't want no trouble at the crossing so thank you brother lyle for yielding yourself to remind us to let's just check ourselves over that's constantly why is that coming out this way why is that growing like this where did that come from and check ourselves every day because it's god's grace to our lives i don't want to get there that day thinking that it's all okay and he says you know i'm sorry but you just passed through and there's some living that that was still there no lord i want it all gone
