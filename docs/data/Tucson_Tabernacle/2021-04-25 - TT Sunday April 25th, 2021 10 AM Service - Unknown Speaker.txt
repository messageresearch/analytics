little nathan there and ethan and logan and sister sylvia god bless you start mentioning names each one of you all are special have become a part of our our lives good to see sister mercedes back there i remember baptizing her a couple of weeks ago and sister hosanna i was sad to hear that brother joseph had a little accident yesterday but the devil's out to get us all isn't he amen the devil's trying to get us but amen we got a savior he watches over us it says the angels of the lord are encamped around about those that fear him amen so they're all around those that fear him no matter where we go or what we go through he's there amen i just want to thank each one of you for making us feel welcome and the love and the gifts and the cards and things that you all have done to make us feel welcome god bless you all there's only one church and that's the church of the living god amen i'm glad to be a part of that and i just thought we'd talk here for just a minute i know we were here i guess it's been three weeks ago and i guess a month before that we had agreed to be together for a period of time and then we would separate and pray and um i've done a lot of praying in the last three weeks and spent a lot of time alone with the lord and praying and and you all have been praying last sunday or you all had a vote and agreed that it would be you would have me to come back for another four weeks so here we are amen to see what we can do for the kingdom of god amen i i believe the lord is writing another book of acts and i've been writing and keeping a journal and and writing the things that the lord maybe it's just me maybe he's just doing something in my life but i i want it to be in every one of our lives brother ram said if the branch puts forth another the vine puts forth another branch they'll write a book of acts behind it and i've got a journal i'm writing the things that god's doing in my life and this and this and i see it in the scripture i see it in the book of acts and something happened the other day there's about five supernatural things that happened in my life and i and i was writing him down i said lord that's what that's what that is that's what's happening in my life and how the holy spirit i'm doing a study on it when the holy spirit spoke in the book of the acts and the holy spirit did this and this and this and so i'm be i'm seeing that in my life and i'm so thankful for it i want to see it in all of our lives i say lord i want to see that branch put forth another that vine put forth another branch and i want to be one of i want to be one of those branches he said i'm the vines you be the branches you bear the fruit amen and i believe it's there for us we have a promise that we have a message that would come and turn our hearts back to the faith of our fathers and i believe god's doing something in my life amen i believe he's getting a people ready right before he comes to take him take that bride home there's a short quick work that he's doing and i want to be a part of it i don't we're not here for popularity or any fame i don't really care about any of those things i'm not here for money i'm just here because i love you all and and the lord has put a burden on my heart for for you all and we'll just try to go through the next four weeks and just see what the lord will do among us i was reading something i went away after i went back i went away for a few days to pray and i was the lord did some things in my life and i was driving up to this one area there and and uh isn't it amazing as you listen to god's prophet you're branded where you are as a geographical location i don't know if you have experiences like that but so i'm going to read this quote where i wa and then i'll go back there virtually in my mind where i was when i heard brother branham say this this is in the message elijah brahm said i want god to love me i want the people to love me that's exactly the truth and if god loves me then the people will love me and if i love his people then he will love me for doing it he said god would rather i'd love you than love him did you know that i'd rather you love my boy back there no matter what you say about me i want you to love my children any father would think that so father god knows the same thing thinks the same thing for he said in so much as you've done it unto the least of these my little ones you have did it unto me so if you want to love god just start loving his children god will reward you if you'll just love his children that shows the love of god is in you amen so i want to love the lord jesus i want to love his people amen i was just just thinking so many memories that we had in the last four weeks of having the revival and having the communion and having the prayer line and seeing god do things in people's lives and i don't think god's finished with this yet i don't know i believe just another season here that god will do more things before i'm anticipating it wherever god is there's supernatural things happening in people's lives happening in marriages happening in children's life young people's life changing their lives we need the holy spirit more than we ever did we were back home dealing with the young people and this and that we were talking about okay i heard my wife on the phone she said you know my child we went through that but when my son received the holy spirit everything changed in his life the rebellion and all the other stuff and all of that stuff changed because of the holy spirit encountering the holy spirit we need it we as adults need it sometimes like the kids need it but we as adults need the holy spirit continue to have experiences through our our lives in christ amen we have a special family special guest our brother john mcfadden and his wife we've grown to love them and know them and appreciated their daughter singing i know brother matthew has grown to have a special place in my heart and i appreciate him i don't know all of their family in fact i've never heard him speak and we've not spent a lot of time together but i can tell by his children that he loves the lord and he's put a lot of work into that that's not an accident and somebody laboring amen and so i want him to come i've just uh he's got a wedding tonight i think he has to attend or perform but i just want him to come and maybe take about 10 or 15 minutes and greet us he doesn't have his bible so it's not maybe it won't be as long as brother daniel but i just want him to greet you all and say something to encourage us the bible says there's many ministry one gives exhortation one prophesies one preaches and so we just want our brother to come and say what the lord's put on his heart brother john god bless you my friend yes all right thank you god bless you it's good to be here and i i promise to be sure i promised him that so that's why i left the bible there i uh i have this one confidence no matter what we think or what we think should be god's in control you know and so sometimes as humans we think things should be this way or that way but i really deep down hope that we trust god's going to have his way and i was talking to brother daniel i really appreciate brother daniel i've heard him preach and he's much better than i am so i'm glad to hear him today but we know that that's god that uses different ministries it's not ever the man the very first time i spoke the lord dealt with me that the gift in the ministry is not for the ministry it's for the people it's like the heavens declare the glory of god right so they're speaking to us every day sometimes we don't look up but it's still speaking and that's what god does he'll put a gift in a man's life and it's not really the man but it's our god who loves to hide himself he comes down and he and he and he speaks and he ministers and that's god's blessing to you so i think we should just respect the the different ministries and it's not just in it's in it's in all of us christ in us the hope of glory so i just wanted to share something that lord's been blessing me with and i had a i was really blessed to hear what he had to say about the book of acts because back home we've been talking about for for many weeks i was listening to brother branham in the third exodus and he said in there and you can listen for yourself he says now they told him about the exodus out of israel egypt he says now the question is why were they out of the promised land and and he says now we've got to go back to genesis to see what happened and why they were there and then he says and you can catch it as you listen to it he says and why is the church out of the land that god promised to them he said pentecost and the book of acts amen you know and i like to be honest with myself i know we individuals like daniel was saying you have experiences but what i'm seeing is not what i see in the book of acts i want to see a book of acts church and so i think that's the holy spirit ministering through daniel and laying on my heart we are promised a book of acts church pentecost is the promised land not churchianity denominationalism intellectualism and all those things we want the supernatural baptism of the holy ghost leading the bride into the rapture and out of here and so um i was so happy to hear that because that's the true church of god what the lord's blessed me with and i got to talk to brother lyle about it he's been feeding on this author hugh ross how many people have heard of hugh ross raise your hand okay there's a few lyle's been feeding on his books for years and just in the past year that i feel like the lord led me to this man who is a christian man but he's an astrophysicist and he's on the autistic scale so when he was seven years old he could hardly talk to people he couldn't really write but he was reading seven physics books a week so he has this gift in his mind and he was he was bullied and things and you can hear him talk about it he's on the internet hugh ross i think it'll be a blessing to you so i just want to share that i think this man god led him you know to realize at a young age through his scientific mind that there was a beginning that the big bang was true he said well if there's a beginning there had to be a beginner and he started looking through philosophy and the holy books looking for the the creator the beginner and he he was he dismissed many of the holy books and he said he was real smug until he got to the bible and when he got to the bible he says all right there's something here he started reading genesis and then he he said all right i'll i'm going to commit to an hour a day and he estimated it would take him four weeks 18 months later he turned to the back of his gideon bible and signed and gave his life to jesus christ he said the god of this bible is the god that created this universe and and i just love this guy he's in his 70s now he has a great demeanor he'll debate these atheists that say you know there's no god and he when they're rude he he holds himself dignified because he knows he's right and he's able to present evidence now here's the thing all the evidence in the universe and and all the modern discoveries are pointing to the fact that the bible is correct and the god of the bible is the creator now we know this so so what's the big deal brother john well as you look at what he's done he's amassed so many evidences of how the universe is fine-tuned it's precise for instance i'll take one little one the sun if it was any bigger or smaller we couldn't be here if we were any closer or farther we couldn't be here there's so many of those things in the universe that his conclusion as an astrophysicist is that it appears that the whole universe was designed so that human life could exist here on this planet and then he's got a book improbable planet there's so many special things about this planet it's unlikely there's another planet like it in the whole universe our galaxy is special we are placed in a special place in the galaxy between the spiral arms we are we have a special solar system our moon is unusually large there's so many things that are precisely fine-tuned our atmosphere everything the tectonic plates you can just look constantly there's if you do the math it's you have a better chance to win the lottery than for all this falling in place to be a coincidence so it's not a coincidence our god is god so then i think of all humanity in the short time that we're here and and then i think of christianity and and you know listen if you realize that the god of creation has revealed himself to you you are beyond blessed we should never take that for granted i was talking a lot about isn't it something that we can really know we're being taught by god we're being schooled sometimes it's correction sometimes he lifts us up when we're down but we're being schooled by god not just for this life but for the beyond and so what encouraged me is i saw all this preparation now i don't believe in seven 24-hour days and and because that's not what it appears to be and i don't think god's like fooling us out there you know it shows that the universe is probably about 13.73 billion years old and the earth itself and the sun is about 4.5 billion years old and when you let this this genius huros take you through what happened and all the steps and this had to happen so this could happen and this could happen and all the preparation for humanity to exist god spent a lot of time and effort so humans could live here it makes me think everything in our life is preparation for right now god is fixing to do something that people have no idea what's about to hit this earth don't look at the way things are remember the ball on the bicycle look at where you're going don't look where you don't look at the your condition the church's condition the world's condition look at the promise of god he's coming back for abroad and i just want you to know all the trials and all the tests in your life everything you're going through it's all preparation we can trust god he knows what he's doing and i for one let's throw in behind daniel and his wife let's believe god is able you know we're not giving complete control of the world to daniel and his wife god's still in control but i see committed people and i've heard him preach and i enjoy it every time so let's hear him preach today is that all right [Applause] man thank you brother brother john god bless you let's all stand together amen isn't god good give us so many blessings man i've got a tablet here today i'm going to try something new preaching off this thing because i don't have a printer where we're staying and all that good stuff so if it all of a sudden takes a left turn brother aaron you'll know the battery died in this thing or something happened and brother daniel's on his own but amen i studied most of the day yesterday and are in the room praying and listening to some tapes of god's prophet and just praying for the lord amen speak to our hearts that's what we need is god to speak to us god just speak to our wife god speak to our son our daughter our children if they can have an experience with god it'll make all the difference we can teach about god but there's a difference when you meet the lord jesus christ it changed moses it changed saint paul and it changed me it's so easy to preach about something you've experienced amen let's just pray together heavenly father it's so good to be in your house today to feel your presence lord we love you father we believe lord there's still mercy and there's you're still on the throne today father and as we open your word lord we just pray you would speak to us lord i pray that you would take the thoughts that you've placed on my heart and i pray that you would help the lord to just be effective to the those that it's intended for lord we believe you're we're your children lord and we just pray that you would bless us now in a special way bless those that are online and that are streaming i pray that they would feel the presence of the lord as well and they would be drawn closer to you we pray and ask it in jesus name amen amen i want to also thank the elders brother aaron especially he's been so faithful through the years how many years you've been going to the church brother aaron 32 god bless you amen brother aaron i appreciate him [Applause] i didn't get through all the trustees brother arne and brother ed and brother jordan they all are special men that have a lot of character and i am thankful to be associated with men who have character and not only them but their family amen their families each one are special to us if you have your bible saint john chapter 9 saint john chapter nine you know sometimes people take things that i say and they take it out of context so if you hear something about me you don't understand it just give me a couple more services and you'll you'll maybe find out that that wasn't exactly right so you'll learn about me and give me a chance to express myself and and that just like having this pulpit down here i'm not used to being that so far away from people that's probably just me where we turn we uh we're in our church the first person's right there and then they're just packed body to body at our church where we are so you all are way away from me right now it's back in our backyard when i went to the branham tabernacle we moved there when i was two and i helped brother brad when i was 19. so for 17 years we went to the branham tabernacle and if you've been there the pulpit's here and the first row is right there they've taken a row out now for weddings and things but the row is right there so when i was sat on the front row it was just you were just right in the right in the thick of it so it's you all just take it for brother daniel's got some problems but the lord's working on him saint john chapter nine verse one and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asking master who did send this man or his parents that he was born blind jesus answered neither what a shocker well surely that you know that's the day we live in everybody wants to blame somebody i want to blame somebody i've had this problem and i want to blame and jesus said neither hath this man sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him sometimes we go through things in life and we want to blame rather than just saying you know what this was all for the glory of god we'd never had a testimony this man being healed if the works of christ hadn't come and he could manifest himself he goes on in verse 4 says jesus said i must works the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world may god add his blessing to the word you may be seated i'm just going to kind of relax and be myself this morning if that's okay this is just brother daniel i can't be brother john mcfadden he's brother john mcfadden but i can just be brother daniel you know every person is an influence each one of you are an influence brother brandon would have the prayer line at the end he said now don't move around he said because each one of you is a spirit and when you move i i watch your spirits so each one of us our life is speaking today your life has already spoken to people if you're a father and you got up and went to the house of the lord your children are watching you are you with me today your life is speaking even if you die abel died and god came to cain said where's your brother he said i don't know am i my brother's keeper he said but his blood cries from the earth i got a text this morning from my son and said dad i appreciate you what you did was right in your life our lives are speaking our brother said you mothers you're the fifth gospel sister figueroa your life is still speaking to your children you're sitting by your grandchildren your life is a loud voice she's sitting there she's quiet but her life is speaking so i say all that to say a couple weeks ago i logged in and brother peter was speaking at the church and i was trying to be a part of the service and and he was speaking about each one of us having a work to do for the lord and the lord just began to deal with me on this subject here in verse number four jesus said i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work the holy spirit began to deal with me that the the little subject the work while it's day work while it's day and so sometimes the holy spirit will put something on your heart and you just kind of let it go and so thursday when we were flying in i'm going through the tsi line and a tsa and i got all my bags i don't know why i think i end up with four trays so they're like you want your phone and your tablet then your computer and then i had a drone in another bag and all of a sudden i got all this stuff all like and i feel like a train going through there and the man said no you got to stand right here and push everything till it goes in there like okay i stand there and he pushes all and i get to the other line of stuff's coming out the other end and the holy spirit speaks to me and says work while it's day the night comes when no man can work so as i began to think about this i began to think because jesus says it here and he's talking about his work being impeded or stopped or inhibited because the night was coming and as i began to think about that i just want to read a couple quotes here to identify who jesus was and then who you are is we can all read the bible know who jesus is but can you recognize yourself in this great plan a lot of people recognize jesus 2000 years ago but what about today so brother branham says in the message show us the father he said god is a spirit he has no hands he had no hands till he became jesus he had no feet no arms no legs so forth until he became jesus he manifested no man has seen the father at any time the only begotten has declared him he god dwelt in a body of christ it's amazing he said he came to a stable born over a manure power pile little jehovah crying in a manger little jehovah playing as a boy little jehovah toiling as a man he cried he crossed his cast with us he became human i think it's saint john 4 god is a spirit and then the bible says saint john 1 the word became flesh and dwelt among us in the body of jesus christ he said when jesus christ was born god was human on earth manifesting god what he was he toiled he labored he felt for the teenager he went through every temptation that we go through amen brother adam goes on to say now christ he ascended up on high we know that he gave gifts unto men paul meets him on the road to damascus the light strikes him down and he said who are you lord and he said i am jesus brother ram goes on to say what he said the pillar of fire again to fulfill his promise he said i came from the spirit world i go back to the spirit world the flesh was only brought here for a sacrifice to redeem us as sinners so jesus christ has ascended back but he sent his spirit back to live inside of a people aren't you thankful for that amen he said i won't leave you comfortless sister fiora amen he said i will come to you i'll be a comforter to you i love it he said i'll be a guide to you oh blessed be the name of jesus christ he'll be a guide to you how do people ever go through life without a guide they need a guide if you're here today and you're wondering you're like i don't know you need a guide you need that everlasting eternal god to live inside of you he said i'm not going to leave you out there you'll have a guide that will lead you and will guide you i'm so thankful for that guide today he goes on to say brother adam said this in the message faith he said jesus said he said i am the vine you are the branches the vine doesn't bear fruit it purges the branches the branches bear the fruit he has no hands but mine and yours i think we talked about that a couple weeks ago remember jesus can't touch the earth because the bible says the dead in christ will rise first and we'll be caught up to meet him in the air so he's limited that he can't come down and work with people at the at your job site or somebody at the the laundromat or or so he can't do that because he's limited by the scriptures so he has no hands but your hands he has no he goes on to say he has no eyes but mine and yours because he has returned into the spirit and another message be not afraid he said he hasn't got no lips but mine and yours he only has hands as he can use mine and yours oh i trust this just comes and becomes real real to us today amen how many of us have hindered the ministry of jesus christ by not giving him our lips not giving him our hands or maybe are using our lips for something that's maybe how can it not bad it's just idle using our hands and something that's not i think at 12 years old jesus said i've got to be about my father's business oh isn't it great at 12 years old he has a purpose in life he has a purpose he's got to be about our father's business oh if we would get a revelation of that that god is totally and he's hampered because he doesn't have lips or hands or if this would come to such a revelation our hearts we as sisters could testify and pick up our phone and call somebody and just talk to them and witness to them and be god manifested in the flesh great is the mystery of godless god was manifested in the flesh we can see jesus christ but can you see today that god is manifested in the flesh and modest sisters that play their instance or brother enoch sitting here playing his instruments that's not an accident gravity there's a thing called gravity and when you let it go things just f it's a law every one of us have a law it's the i think the bible says it's the law of sin and being turned loose how's it say in revelation man is water and man he flows to the water flows to the lowest form and picks up dirt and contamination along the way we'll say it like that that's why brother jordan can stand in here and experience people having many mental conditions and going to the lowest form but god rich in mercy has reached and touched our lives has touched the musicians and now they're using their talent not for the devil but using it for jesus christ i say that's a miracle i say that's supernatural that's god doing something in their their lives and not only to use them but each one of us god wants to use you as as a mother as a grandmother as a as a young man amen i see our helicopter pilots back there god bless them aren't you thankful for our military i'm standing here today with the freedom of religion because people went and gave their life that we could stand here for the freedom of religion amen we our hats ought to be off to those people it grieves me when you see people go the korean war and the and the vietnam and come back and and the things that were done to those veterans amen we ought to i mean freedom's not free i'll say let's just put a plug in for the military freedom's not free somebody gave their life i mean this gospel is not free people gave amen gave their blood as the song said there's many that have given their blood and there'll be more that'll give their life's blood for this holy ghost gospel amen i want to be one to give my life for christ amen how many want to give your life to christ today say lord take my hands lord take my lips lord take my strength lord and give me the holy ghost lord and let me do something for the kingdom of god amen the bible says if you want to be great in the kingdom be the servants be the servant of all matthew chapter five i'm trying to work with our audio video keep people i wrote i don't i'm just everywhere but so i wrote a couple verses down matthew chapter 5 verse 13. amen matthew chapter 5 verse 13 to 16 jesus now is talking he said ye are the salt of the earth i don't know if they gave them to you back their brothers or not jesus said ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savior wherewith shall it be salted as the one man said you you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink but the other man said well hey i can put enough salt in his oats that he'll want to drink and i can't make people love jesus christ but i trust that we may become so salty in our life portrayed such a god that loves you and cares about you and gave his all that you could have peace and you can lay down on your bed at night and have peace in your soul i tell you i remember what it was as a 15 year old boy and raised in a christian home a godly home and and such a never anything out of the way just a life given to christ and my father and my mother what godly people and to think i straight away just listening to some bad music and at night i would lay in bed and just the tears run out of my eyes and fill my pillow because i wanted to find god i wanted to experience the lord jesus christ amen and a young boy at a camp at 15 years old i walked down an order oh i was sitting about where brother mcfadden was and i remember i walked down and knelt down and i gave my whole life to jesus christ not under an emotion but lord i want to give you my life amen i want you to live inside of me i want to live eternally and i can't do this without you oh if we could get to that place this morning lord i can't do this without you jesus says it without me you can do nothing but sometimes we get in our heads hey i got this you might have that in your head sorry my eyes leak sometimes when god squeezes my heart my eyes leak it's another problem i have i tell my secretaries at work i say hey it's one good thing i say you can just say hey i work with handicapped people brother daniel's got so many handicaps and that's one of them when god's squeezing my heart my tears come out of my eyes but it wouldn't do us all a little bit to cry a little bit you see men that can't be touched that's not a that's not a man that's a brute the greatest man was jesus christ and he sat one day and looked at the condition of his disciples and the bible says the shortest verse you probably if you went to sunday school it was your go-to verse they said you got a verse that jesus wept jesus wept jesus wept oh if we could just learn that and become like jesus and we could weep a little bit when you see the condition of the church and the people and how things are going away and then he climbs up on jerusalem and he sits down again the bible says he sat down and he held jerusalem of jerusalem he's looking at the condition of the church and he's beginning to weep there was a burden in his heart we need more men like that have a burden for the condition of the church of god and not just this church but christianity of the message as a whole and have a bird and say how can it be going this way we see the music becoming modern and contemporary and those things and where is the real sincerity and even the preaching sometimes where is the preaching that grips your heart and convicts you and when you leave you say you know what i was convicted by the holy ghost i didn't hear good you know words and a lot of that but i was convicted and when i leave i could say you know what i felt the presence of god in that meeting that's what we need to amen not just talk about but experience the presence of almighty god amen people can come in and feel the presence of god and no those people are praying people they walk out and say i don't understand what they believe but there's something different about those people hey man they've met god there's something that touches their hearts amen and amen god is a reality he said year the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savior wherewith shall it be salted it is henceforth good for nothing be cast out and to be trodden under foot then jesus said ye are the light of the world oh i thought he said he was yeah he said as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world but now he said you are the light of the world that old sunday school song this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine hide it under a bush oh no i'm gonna let it shine somewhere we need to take the bush off the bushel and say lord let my light shine because jesus said i am the light of the world if some of you old-timers you get those cold those lamps we used to have them you and you have that little lamp you get it up we always turned it up to it i got all that smoke and then your thing got smokey sometimes people's testimony they get away from the lord and they're the the flames still there but it's just covered over with so many other things cares of the world and smoking you just have to take that you know what i'm talking about you take that globe off and you take it put it in the water and you clean it out you set it back there and then it shines that light again we need to come into the presence of the lord and say lord will you just cleanse me today let's listen that tape by the ramp said not unchristianized people we just need to come back and clean that globe back get back to our first works and our first love for the lord jesus where the very first thing jesus what is the greatest commandment love the lord with all of your heart with all of your soul with all your might and then love your neighbor just like yourself jesus said all the law and all the prophets and men are hung on these two commandments people get so caught up in the law of the message and this just forget about all that and just love the lord jesus just love him with all there was a man came to our church and he had a rough life and a lot of baggage and he come one time and like hey can i do voodoo and i'm like you know i don't know i do know but i don't know how to just get jesus in your heart and then let him tell you what's right and what's wrong that's the main thing we've got to get to christ i think i read it here before brother raymond said i'm afraid remember rising and suddenly said i'm afraid we're getting people to church we're getting them to a theory but we're not getting them to christ as a minister i want to get you to christ i want you to get to jesus christ you say what about the message brother daniel well the bible says i think it's what is it saint john john saint john 14 when he the spirit of truth has come he will lead you and he will guide you into all truth so you really get jesus he will guide you into the truth now when he begins to lead you into the truth and you're not willing to go into the truth you better go back and see make sure you've got the jesus of the bible how many understand what i'm saying we just fall in love with jesus we sing that little song let me fall in love with you all over again let me know you like never before we need to go back amen and do our first works over he said you are the light of the world a city that said on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and they giveth light unto all in the house you say brother daniel it's dark outside it is dark outside but you know when a light shines the light the brightest it's when it's the darkest so maybe 50 years ago and there's a revival man it was just like every you know but now it's so dark you just shine a light and you let a sister walk into walmart with long hair and a modest dress like wow they just like from another planet yeah we're from another planet this world is not my home i'm just passing through i'm an ambassador for another kingdom that's why we dress different that's why we act different we're from a different kingdom we represent the kingdom of jesus christ don't ever try to fit in with this world you'll never do it and be a christian jesus said if you love me how do you say if the world hated me it'll hate you as well so the house the bible says be well beware when all men speak well of you as a minister when everybody speaks well of you and they're just high on good fellow then beware brother daniel beware when all men speak well of you amen because that's not what happened to jesus jesus got a temper he came in our church and flipped all the money tables over and flipped them all over and said you all are doing something contrary to the bible because the bible says my house shall be called a house of prayer oh he's got a temper they weren't speaking well of jesus christ john's out there with camel hair locus honey running down his beard he says repent bring forth fruits meet for repentance verse 16 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven how we doing on time i made a vow to myself yesterday i'm going to try to preach shorter it's all relative you have to interpret that for me in the back rather than you know so i was just thinking about this because when we think of nighttime and jesus is saying i've got to work the works of him that sent me while it's day the night cometh when no man can work now in their day they're thinking okay we've got land lamps and we can only get out and dig this ditch or have my ox to pull the plow in the daytime and the night comes and then i can't work and as i begin to meditate on the night time and i begin to realize the night time is not necessarily darkness but it's inhibitions that that keep you from accomplishing what you're trying to accomplish i began to think about that because we've conquered the night time we have these lights and you can put up lights and you my son has a roofing company and so we've conquered we can bring lights out spotlights and do it but there's another darkness which is a handicap which says your neighbors don't want you hammering at four o'clock in the morning hammering with a power nailer on their roof how many understand what i'm saying i'm trying i'm saying that there's other handicaps that keep you which are then defined as that nighttime that darkness that keeps you from working so i might overcome the light and so but but there's other handicaps and ordinances in your town that says you can't do that we were walking through a subdivision my wife and i the other day and we were talking about how that we would probably get kicked out of the subdivision in the first couple of days with our boys because they're always banging or building or a go-kart or this or this and running through the neighbor's yard and they were you know so you see that there's other things that would begin to think about this and just kind of meditate on this i thought about this pandemic that has just come through and so we've been having churches and jesus is saying work while it's day the night is coming where you can't work i was thinking about this pandemic that i never saw that coming but now this darkness let me just say like this this darkness this circumstance has crossed our nation i guess it's more real up at brother biscuits church where they're not allowed to have church they can't have church there and isn't it ironic probably two or three hundred feet away they have a christian school that can be open but 300 feet away they have a church that cannot be opened by regulations of the government now let me read this verse again jesus said i must work the works of him that sent me while it's day the night comes the circumstances come when no man can work when what you have now and i just want to maybe jump ahead of myself what we think is is that we've enjoyed this pleasure of being together and going to church and that's we must work while it's day because there are circumstances that are coming when no man can work i just want to take a few minutes here and go through this with the government restrictions so one year ago a year in maybe january february this pandemic began to pass and i don't blame the the officials and everybody's trying when it first come out trying to figure out what is this and the mask and things and and but all of a sudden we saw regulations there was no flights you couldn't fly out to arizona you couldn't have any meetings it was shelter in place you had to stay in your home and you had to wear masks and and it was it was interesting i think even was it thanksgiving i forget where in canada you could only have your family and one other visitor come into your house and so now you see how that if god has given you a work to do on the earth how that the night circumstance come when you can't work so if we were had the circumstances of a year ago i wouldn't have been able to fly out here thursday and minister so the night time came and now the day the circumstances have been lifted again for a period of time we don't know and here i'm able to to to be here again but we don't know when that darkness will come again i hope you understand what i'm saying you see the circumstances that that would come and there's so many i would like to maybe we won't get through this this morning because we have a service tonight and so i don't have to preach at all this morning and you're like praise the lord we get shorter sermons but i thought about those things that you know how that they're saying that maybe even to fly you have to have a vaccination and maybe you feel like i don't want to have that vaccination for whatever reason to put a foreign substance in my body unless i have to i say okay that's fine but you're not going to be able to fly if you don't do that so then there would be a darkness that would uh freedom that would be taken and maybe we'll talk about some of them tonight maybe a health issue or or sickness or or old age or maybe a deep trial that you go through in your life that would cause you to not be able to work and maybe when i said that there's no hands but your hands and there's no voice but your voice and maybe the lord sparks something in your heart that you should do something for the lord and maybe that little something whatever he spoke to you then amen maybe you should write it down and say you know i'm going to do that because there may be darkness that would come in your life that you wouldn't be able to do that maybe you say you know what i'm going to go visit that sick person and then maybe there would be a car accident that would leave you in a state that you're not able to go visit that sick person the darkness would come and so today if you hear his voice don't harden your heart say lord i'm going to do that i know some of you are doing it some of you are sending cards and sending texts and i don't want to get ahead of myself but i want us to just see this darkness can come that no man can work i was listening to this message yesterday church order brother adam said and remember god is looking to me to see that i stay with the word he's he's the oversee of the church he's meeting with the brothers and he said i'm looking to you to see you carry out the word cc in this church and keep it spiritual that's a good thing isn't it keep it spiritual he said for remember all the forces of the dark kingdom of satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow in the lord so i love a prophet you know i i just love to be able to sit and hear a prophet and yesterday listening to it and i got a book and i'm just sitting down and i'm going to school and the prophet is sitting there talking to me and he's teaching me he's teaching he said now daniel i want you to know that all the forces of the darkness of the satan's kingdom will be turned against you when you start to grow in the lord and not only do i hear a prophet say it but now i experience it every day i get up and the devil went to bed around 11 or 12 whatever last night around four o'clock in the morning i wake up there and the holy spirit's dealing with me i can't sleep i got the service and the burden of the word you go back and read of it a preacher is not just somebody gets up and does an oration there's a burden of the word of the lord that comes to the person and they try to get away from it they can't get it's a burden for the souls of the people and so i'm there and the devil's right there to come so if you ever run out of you want to do something for the lord you can pray for brother daniel say i want to do something for the lord pray put me at the top of your prayer list well you tell me what it takes to get to the top of your prayer list and i'll try to do it because i want to be at the top i want to know people are praying and i know people that are streaming today all across the nation are praying for me and i thank god for it and sometimes i wonder when the devil comes so much against my mind i say lord how am i even standing how because he would love to just remember god jesus told peter he said satan has desired to have you he desires to have every one of you he desires to have you as young people he decides you have you as a grandmother like i just no satan said but jesus said i prayed for you that your faith would fail not oh blessed be the name of jesus i'm so glad he prayed for me and not only him but he has a voice in the earth of saints sons and daughters of god that are his voice on the earth that are praying for me why wouldn't it be good to have a prayer chain where the bible says pray ye one for another pray ye one for another oh what a supernatural power amen of prayer you can have experiences with god and just while i'm sitting here and i'm preaching i'm going back the last couple of weeks to places in in the motel and places uh there that the lord spoke to me in dealing with my heart we need experiences with god we need to meet god in a real way amen where god is supernaturally speaking to you he still has a voice god is a spirit and he speaks in a spiritual realm amen he had to have dealt with you or you wouldn't be here today something woke you up this morning sister and said why don't you go to the house to the lord i say we say that was jesus christ there's only two forces in the world we need to make this really simple get it black back to black and white something is dealing with your heart amen who said why don't you get up and go to the house of the lord and then god does something down on the inside not through a dry sermon with a quarterly that's printed out at the first year hey this is what we're all going to study no we get up in the morning say lord we need you today i don't know what's going to happen tomorrow lord but we need you today to help us lord amen and whatever god equipped me for what's going to happen tomorrow amen we need the lord jesus but he's real and he'll be there amen i've told this story i'm going to tell it again amen we left that brother russ wallace's and we were going down the road brother ted passed lee's i think he had the funeral here just a couple of weeks ago i was streaming the service there i appreciate brother ted and sister murder the wonderful people servants of the lord we were getting out of church and going down and there was two i didn't know i thought it was a semi in the middle of the road we were there and we just pulled off the road and i got out and ran up there and i realized two vehicles this is for somebody today and i went up and there were two vehicles a ford f-150 silver truck is on its side another vehicle there and i get up there brother zach wallace is there and he's running out trying to see if this is the people from the church we had lingered fellowshipping a little bit in the in the parking lot and then we run up there the people are still hanging in their seat belts in this in the car and and and we just didn't know if it was the people from the church and we just went up there and said like no that one's passed away this one's a little bit of a pulse but we don't know and i just realized it wasn't the people from the church they called the paramedics brother jeremy i'm not a paramedic so i stay in my lane somebody more qualified will take you know they were there to help but then they came and they were taken but i'm walking back to my car and the holy spirit said what if they had been from your church and what if you didn't give a call and give them a chance to surrender their life to god and didn't have a didn't challenge them to put their sins underneath the blood of jesus christ and be forgiven and now they're hanging in their seat belt and where about you daniel what about you why didn't you preach the gospel this is the holy spirit preaching to me his holy spirit preaching to me and say daniel did you just preach nice flowery words do you know daniel you're going to have to stand before the judgment seat of god one day and give an account for the opportunity that you had in my house and you didn't challenge people to take their sins and put them under the blood of jesus christ and because the holy spirit is training and he's tutoring and he's whipping me brother aaron i've never tried to always have that opportunity at the end of a service that someone could surrender their life to jesus christ because there is a fountain filled with blood drawing from emmanuel's veins and sinners plunged beneath that flood they lose all of their guilty stains aren't you thankful for that fountain filled with blood and i believe it's still efficacious this morning i believe that fountain is still there because there's something the holy spirit in my spirit is is crying out come to the fountain come to the fountain there'll be a day there'll be no more mercy but this isn't that day this is the day god is calling there is mercy there's room at the cross for you was it billy graham's greatest son there's room at the cross for you there's room at the cross for you though millions have come there's still room for one there's room at the cross for you i need that cross i need that cross blessed be the name of the lord amen so brother adam goes on to say and satan will try he said he will come among you and cause you to sp dispute with one another if he can turn him down just immediately your brethren that's the enemy and we're here to hold a standard in this evening light time that when the world listen to this here when the world is darkened and the whole church kingdom is going into the council of churches and pretty soon they'll try listen to this they'll try to tack a sign on this door here closed and then we're going to have to meet other places because they'll certainly close these churches one of these days if we don't take the mark of the beast it's a prophet he's prophesying they certainly tried to close the doors i know back in our state they're trying to close and close it in canada they already the school can be open but the church can't be opened isn't that discrimination the bars are open and the casinos are open but the church can't be open you see what the devil is doing he's got a scheme i don't know what the virus whatever it is at the end of the day one year later what has it accomplished churches cannot be open you see how the devil he's got a plan he knows what he's doing the bible says forsake not the assembling of ourselves together we don't know how it's going to happen we might have to meet down at the soccer field and we're oh yeah they're all huddling down there we're praying in jesus name god strengthen us heal our bodies and deliver us most people ain't playing soccer they're having church okay hey we'll see you down at walmart aisle five oh i'm sorry i spent this whole thing a flower they're all down on their knees those people are praying in aisle five we laugh about it work while it's day the night cometh when no man can work but you'll never destroy the church of god amen jesus said i'm going to build my church and the gates of hell will never prevail against it amen a little persecution causes the church to become stronger those that have faith in christ they become strong in the lord that's where the paul i believe as paul said be strong in the lord and in the power of his might you know the book of acts the brother is talking about the book of acts it wasn't all miracles and signs and wonders they took paul in and they stoned him and they threw him outside of the city and there was no disciples there he just picked up a rock picked up another rock picked up another rock pushed the rocks up and got up that's the book of ass oh i don't want that book of acts i just want to see the lame man get up and run around no it wasn't that way amen there was a lot of persecution that happened there here's peter throwing in prison here's paul amen they're in this in the jail with paul and silas and they had beat those people they had beat them and they're flogging them and they're sitting there i don't know the stocks brothers brother um you know brother probably been to israel and over there i've never been over there and now they've got them in stocks you've seen they're sitting like this and they look at each other what else we gonna do they started singing the praises of almighty god hey man and god came right down among them the doors and windows started shaking their stocks broke loose amen we need god to come among us a little bit amen take a little beating for the gospel's sake some of us get so soft and hampered and we get a little offended we want to run off somewhere hey man we're about to the recognition with our brothers and sisters that were burned at the stake and torn apart by lions and my feelings are no and they tore johnny apart and he killed sally for their testimony in jesus christ we need strong rugged christians and the bible says and they love not their lives even unto death oh i want to love the lord jesus i want to have something of a revelation down in my heart though it might might cost my life that i i know in whom i have believed amen you need to have that in your own self and you know that you've tried to walk this life or maybe you tried to do reformation you tried to be a good person you realize that you couldn't be a good person we have an old nature and it's strong especially we men we're just and you realize i can't do this without christ and you need to have an experience with god and god breaks that old man and he breaks him down paul said i can do all things through christ who strengthens me and then you mothers would say yeah that's what my husband needs that's what he needs he needs to meet jesus christ reformation will never work i tried to do a gp i write it on my hand gp is a teenager gp go pray it took something stronger than a tattoo on my hand or a little it takes an experience with god to break that nature brother ram said he goes on to say and we're depending on staying true to god until death sets it's free and that's what we intend to do that's what i intend to do so i was thinking about that at night cometh when no man can work i say we need to keep working for the lord we need to keep preaching we need to keep singing we need to keep teaching sunday school we need to keep meeting together amen preaching the gospel repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ we need to keep baptizing people in the water amen let them get filled with the holy ghost it's more than being baptized there's an experience of the baptism of the holy spirit and the fire of god that will burn every every sin and every desire out of your life amen we just need to go deep in christ amen i was thinking was it when we were here the last time it was friday night when we were going out of the service my brother john preached when i was there the people were going out sister hosanna was over there on her knees with their hands raised and god was doing something in her life amen it's just not oh have an experience that's continually going on and have an experience after experience after experience with almighty god great men did it in the bible amen there's just not abraham god spoke to him said get out of this land but he went he built altars jacob look at all those mighty men they had experience after experience after experience with god we see people like yeah i received the holy spirit 20 years ago it's more than 20 years ago remember the man i had to fall every day a fresh experience with god that's what happened sometimes we try to keep our experience from yesterday to today we need a fresh experience with almighty god we need to be renewed the bible says be renewed in the holy ghost we never know when this will be ended you know as time goes on we see a prophet is prophesying and we think it means one thing i'll just say this brother ram said science and education is the worst enemy the gospel ever had we thought it was reading and writing arithmetic and we realized now the cell phone science and education is the worst enemy brotherhood said it's made the church of god a bunch of ragweeds just a bunch of common people that should be the salt of the earth laying their hands on the sick the power of the holy spirit casting out devils testifying for god and now they're just sitting holding the phone playing some game frivolous mindless game and a waste of time and jesus said hey you're my witness you're my witness what are you doing may it challenge it challenges me i'm not preaching i'm preaching to brother daniel now lord i must be about my father's business at 12 years old let it challenge us as christians we don't just come to church to hear a nice flower he said but lord let it challenge me today lord let me be about my father's business don't let me how's the bible say redeem the time not waste the time redeem the time and so i thought about that how brother em said that science and education now we can see what he was saying is being fulfilled he's a prophet he's prophesy so there's things that he would say like oh that means that listen to this brother iran said i was thinking as i was down there driving down the road a while ago being out for a little prayer just before entering the pulpit as any real sincere clergyman does so now he's telling us what a real preacher is a clergyman man that spends time in prayer not out running around all the time in this he's a man that's in prayer and he said i was thinking you know we're having some of the most glorious time when we meet here he said but the people gathering from many states sitting right here now and from all the way hundreds and hundreds of miles and we've assembled together to fellowship around the world word he said but there will come a time soon when this will just be a fond memory that's right and i always thought it was brother branham having meetings at the branham tabernacle because i was a member there and then wow we play the same tapes and it's a fond memory brother ram's there and they're standing up my father-in-law said you had to come early standing along the wall and yes that is a fond memory but now brother bam said and these times will be taken away from us so therefore we must do all that we know to do know how to do and make this every minute counts so yes that is a fond memory but what about what we're experiencing today is a fond memory some of you go back 50 years when this church was full of people and mine just such a revival and a wonderful thing fond memory and now we're sitting here could it be a prophecy that one day they will tack something on the door and you're like you know what i remember the time when i could go put a little piece of paper into the church and if god put a song in my heart i could sing a special in front of the church i remember the time when we could stand publicly and open our bibles and read our bibles and have the freedom of religion what a fond memory that was i remember brother jordan could come out and we could have a public address system and we could sing christian songs publicly just a fond memory jesus said work while it's day the night comes when no man can work oh brother daniel couldn't happen in tucson it did a year ago they did a year ago said you don't learn heaven church you're shutting down it's still that way in canada you all can't have a church the night cometh when no man can work i say we take what the prophet said let's let make every amen minute count let's let make every service count for the lord jesus amen because we never know when we won't be able to have these opportunities i was thinking of my brother john and i know many people are doing around the the world and and doing things for the lord i was just thinking of my brother john he's he was here yesterday he was having a revival i think this whole weekend they're having a revival i don't even know what the the country is where they're they're hosting the revival but they had they were doing an online revival they had 50 countries people logged in a thousand people logged in virtually to my brother john uh preaching the gospel and and ministering like wow that is just amazing i said brother john just keep preaching the gospel all around the world my my nephew timothy was he was he they patched me into a link he's preaching to the people in pakistan through a translator in a zoom meeting i mean why because sometimes they can't meet up in canada but there's a little outlet that just a little window that you can say oh yeah that's really neat they can do that zoom but what about when they shut that down oh that could never happen they shut your president down they shut your president down said you can't be on social media twitter or whatever those social media my son william posted a verse on facebook and they they they banned him said oh you can't do that so we see brother ben kept using the word boycott boycott boycott they'll boycate boycott you they'll boycott you and when they boycott the bible from social media and twitter and facebook and youtube and you can no longer preach we have the freedom today we're streaming and using the vehicle brother jordan the different brothers are in the audio video we're streaming on youtube but what about when they say hey that's christianity you're preaching against sin and what we call alternative lifestyles you can't preach against that well hey i'd have to tell a couple of verses out of my bibles we'd have to tear go back to genesis we'd have to tell romans 1 we have to tear jude out all these things are written for examples that's an accelerant that brings the wrath of god down on you i'm sorry hey they're going to ban you well they're going to have to ban us because we have to preach the word of god so what we see is day work while it's day do something for god because the night is coming when they may ban you from all of that when they banned this message from being publicly distributed could they do it absolutely pull a couple quotes out of context of brother ranum call him a racist and call him these things and call him national security when he says russia is raised up to destroy america and that's a threat and and they start doing these things my what would they have done to jesus christ well i tell you we know what they did to all of them i think isaiah they saw him asunder and they burn them at the stake amen i think john the revelator they put him in a vat and tried to burn him and try to try to boil it out of him but there's something about this holy ghost amen you can't boil it out of a christian amen amen when the persecution comes or something inside of them it becomes stronger and i was thinking about that just as we come down to a close i was thinking romans chapter 15 verse 1. what do i do in these times brother daniel romans chapter 15 verse 1. the bible says we then that are strong ought to make a million dollars and all retire in the bahamas and just live our own lives the best way that we want to is that what your bible says no we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak all those people are just a bunch of uneducated people and they're just poor people god loves poor people he made so many of them and you're like oh i'm i'm educated i've got all these towns just forget all those people can you be the bride and think like that i don't know it's not what the bible says remember the bible to be the bride you have to live by every word so when the scripture says we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not please ourselves let every one of us please his own neighbor for his good to the edification even so christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproach of them that reproached thee fell on me tell you what i want to stand with god's people i want i'm not ashamed to be identified with the bride of jesus christ and the message of the hour paul said in the way that's called heresy is the way that i worship the god of our fathers i'm not ashamed to believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i'm not ashamed to be identified with people that believe in holiness and long hair and modest apparel i'm not ashamed to be with but uh believe amen be identified with people that are acts book of acts believers and believe that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover to speak in dongs and cast out devils because it's the bible i want to be identified with those people second corinthians chapter 15. i had marked a couple verses down i didn't want to be long because we have another service tonight and i want to go through some other dark times tonight that people go through in their life sometimes our health you heard my father-in-law said that one time he said you know as daniel he said there's one thing i never counted on in in life that was old age i just thought i'd be strong i'd be healthy i'd do that you know just and he told me something he said daniel if you're ever going to do anything in life do it while you're young and now as i get older i realize sometimes my memory and things i don't have like that i tell you we ought to do all that we can while we can today some people have that they're procrastinating why put off to tomorrow which you can do the day after tomorrow what why put off to tomorrow which you can do today we can do something today and jesus is telling work while it's day daniel there's a time coming where you may not be able to stand publicly and preach the gospel you may not even be able to stream youtube you may not even be able to send a whatsapp thing out from that church because that church is identified with those holy ghost-filled christian people work while it's day he goes on ii corinthians chapter 5 verse 15 and that he died for all that they which lived should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again amen may god help us to not live for ourselves amen but live for him who died for us you know i believe there's a people that are willing to work just like the book of acts there was a man called stephen he was just a he was a deacon and then they come out and he preached the gospel and the bible says they gnashed on him with their teeth and it's so amazing you see man here's christ at calvary said father forgive them they know not what they do and just a few years months later here's stephen giving his life they're stoning him he said father lay not this sin to their charge and the life that was in christ is now inside of stephen he's being stoned oh we like the book of acts man angel came put a shout a force field around him he just walked out there and the rocks just bounced off no he gave his life and he was manifesting the life of christ by saying father lay not this sin to their charge and it was the greatest man a great manifestation that the life that was in christ now is inside of this believer i don't know what we're going to have to go through but i know one thing i want the life that was in christ to be inside of me when the bible says that he prayed earnestly i want to be someone that's praying earnestly when the bible says paul was pressed in the spirit i want to be one that can be pressed in the spirit i i want to be one the bible is reading there was it acts 13 the bible says when they fasted and prayed the holy spirit spake to them and said separate to me paul and barnabas and the holy spirit is speaking i want to be a part of a church like that where the holy spirit can speak and we can be moved by the holy ghost and we come and we pray and we wait on the lord and the lord says do this and move over here and do this i want to be a part of that church some people don't want a part of that they don't want anything to do with that because he starts digging down into their personal life and going brother man preaches a message called the door doors and a door and he goes through and he said one is pride one is this one is your financial don't go in there lord and you you welcome but don't go in there another one he said is your private life we're like lock deadbolt combination and you're not going into my private life but the bible says he already sees all how was it david said if you i go to the bottom of the sea they're there if i go to heaven you're there wherever i go lord you're there he already knows so we're better off saying lord here i am maybe something you're like i don't like this just be say lord you know i don't like that sister i pray you would help me and make me what i ought to be to love my enemies and jesus sister been baptized in jesus name and loves the lord we take communion together lord help me lord help us lord jesus amen i was thinking about that just as a word of encouragement what could we do for the lord what about texting these fine elders most of us i know kids like i think with ours is like 16 like okay when i when you're driving i don't know where you are then maybe a phone but now it's like at 12 years old 14 years old i gotta have a phone i gotta you know and i'd tell them i said all right either parent you instruct them about the dangers of pornography or i as the youth leader are going to have to deal with it it's really quiet in here but i'd never take a gun and load it up hand it to a 12 year old like here you go have a good day be quiet with that i'm working just sit anybody would take a cell phone and hand it to a child there's more power computing power on that phone than the original space capsule that went to the moon and you hand it to a child and power without character is satanic and you give that to a teenager with no guidance and no instruction just be prepared just be prepared and there was i walked up to a teenager this week said hey i heard you got a cell phone and i'm concerned about it even the young girls well that's pretty intrusive in people's personal life yeah but there's a real devil out there trying to destroy people's lives as we said one time i'd rather my son be in a room with a loaded gun than sitting in a room with un how could i say unattended internet access where they can go places in their mind and leave scott listen to me leave scars in their mind that they'll never be able to get rid of when they see that and i didn't know my goodness and it scars that little because the internet has taken away all innocency that little child is in it this is kind of pastoral but it's the truth that little age where they're little kids at 10 years old and all of a sudden they go from 10 to 18 that quick and their innocence of like little playing with dollies and paper dolls in him and all of it's gone like wow what happened the internet came in may god help us amen to say burn you know i know some preachers like preach you can't have it well then what are you going to do quit your job you're going to stop going to school like they took the school books away from us and gave them tablets you got to do your school like that i say it's like a fire that heats the furnace you got to put it in his place and then keep it in its place and have a holy ghost-filled dad say you're right brother down you're absolutely right brother jane i don't want to hear it but you're right i got to take this thing and put it back in its place put it back in its place that's a whole other sermon isn't it what about texan our brother jordan today and say brother jordan that was an encouragement to see you leading songs what about our musician when's the last time you text our musician say god bless you i appreciate i don't start naming names for each one of them and the rotating sister martha back there given she sang a song a couple months ago and it had a month or so ago and made an impression on me amen each one of us have a ministry and do something for the lord what about texting and people are giving so much you send them a little text you'll never know what it means to get a text like that brother texted me this morning back home and he sends a text to me brother daniel i'm praying preach the word of god yesterday a brother texts me and you have that power that you could do that you become an agent for jesus christ what about visiting a sick person what about praying for brother daniel what about being a witness what about being a witness i'm on the plane man boy sitting there like hey talking a little chat there like hey hey here's a card i pulled out one of the the witnessing cards the message.com said hey listen look at this take a look at i'm going to tucson tabernacle on you know invite somebody to church we got those cards i don't know how to witness just give them a card say hey come listen to our singing we got some good musicians we got people that love the lord god touch your heart you come to our services pray for somebody matthew 25 40. jesus said the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me when you say that encouraging word to lift that person up the bible says you've done it unto jesus christ the bible says when you know you loan somebody somebody and they pay you back he said what thank you the world does that but when you do things that they can't pay you back he said you've done it unto me i trust tonight this morning it's in one of those you know it's one of those provoking services that provokes us to be our best you're a schoolteacher you going to third grade what's the goal to get the child from third grade to fourth grade we come to church not to find out how good we are say lord how can i be a better christian lord there's this thing at the end that says the bride without spot or wrinkle lord have i been have i been living to myself lord you really don't have any hands you don't really have a voice you really christ you can't sing a special at our church no i can't i'm waiting on you to do it i'm waiting on you to use your talent to play and do something for the lord jesus christ i'm waiting for you jesus you can't be a grandmother no i'm waiting on you to call your grandkids and say jesus is the only true god don't forget about the lord don't forget about jesus i know you're busy in your schoolwork but don't forget about jesus you'd be surprised what that little word does when that child's out somewhere alone somewhere in the hour of temptation and they hear that voice of the grandmother speaking to them abel's dead and is still speaking my grandfather he would get down and pray and say lord we pray that you would apply the token he's been dead i don't know third 40 years for 35 years he but he's life is still speaking it's speaking it's speaking to us speaking to me speaking to our family may it be a challenge today if our musicians will come i did pretty good right i'm doing better i learned listened to a tape yesterday brother graham said all right i'm trying to do better we got tonight i don't have to preach at all this morning work well it's day the night is coming is that a prophecy the night is coming when you won't be able to do anything for the lord as christians it should provoke us say lord jesus help me lord a year ago we couldn't even come to church we couldn't even and lord we we see even to our they took the most powerful man in the world the president and shut him out why wouldn't he take and shut these things and why why yeah you see there there there's they're banning there's going to be a boycott of christianity and things of god i say we work while it's day if you have the holy spirit that's what the holy spirit is given remember was it acts 1 go and terry in the city of jerusalem to you being due with power and then you'll be my witness if you've received the holy spirit it's not just to sit and say yep got a ticket to heaven no it's to be a witness for christ and maybe you're sitting here today and he said brother daniel i don't have the power i don't have a testimony to witness but you realize christ has no hands but he wants your hands he's calling you today he's knocking what's to say in revelations chapter 3 if any man will hear my voice it's the voice of the spirit of god not phonetics it's the spirit of god coming down and knocking on your heart if any man will hear my voice i'm gonna open the door of his heart he said i'll come in oh what a promise i'll come into him and i'll sup with him i'll commune with him [Music] and we'll have fellowship and then a great promise i hope blessed be the name of the lord let's pray together heavenly father lord as we bow our heads lord we've not tried to preach a long time but just try to say something lord as a admonition a prophecy that you gave that work while it's day the night is coming lord when no man will be able to work lord today we have freedoms our great military or so many in this audience and their family have given so much of their life to let us have these freedoms lord great nation in the world lord we see those freedoms being eroded we don't know how long we'll have them you prophesied there would be coming circumstances that would not allow us to work father we see it around us now we see the prophecy being fulfilled in the last year with the pandemic and the national laws that even appear to be discriminatory against churches and christianity help us today lord jesus lord it's a sobering time it's a serious time lord we didn't come to play church or try to get a popularity vote lord we try to draw closer to you father or we want our family to go with this lord we don't want to just go and leave our husband behind or our children or we want to go together lord when they left egypt they said we don't want to leave a hoof behind we don't want to leave a little one or we don't want to have a great zeal for god in our teenager not feel the presence of god lord i i've tried to be honest and transparent as a burden from my heart lord knowing before you that one day i'll stand and i'll give an account for the things i say lord i want to be a servant of christ and encourage people to get away from the world and draw closer to you father we turn away from the glamour just thinking what your prophet said and why christ speak he said either your faith will paralyze the glamour of the world or the world will glamor will paralyze your faith lord let the faith of god paralyze the world

strife take away all indifference father those little funny feelings lord may they just leave us and may the holy spirit come and weld us together lord we're in a battle we're fighting lord the enemy today we're not fighting our brothers and sisters lord we're fighting the enemy may you reveal that to us these are our brothers and sisters in this room today join us together lord as a body of christ where one body lord one one member supplies every member's lord supplies something to the body may you help us and strengthen us lord lord when there's things we don't understand or may we just just still be part of the body father may you help us through these difficult changing times we pray lord we pray that you would help us now in jesus name amen and amen that song that she's playing i surrender all let's just lift it up to the lord help me brother oh yes lord let's surrender all to my [Music] hallelujah [Music] my [Music] yes surrender all yes lord [Music] amen there's a little song he cares for you i wonder if we could just be real soft this is the time you you preachers delivered his message like the ups guy delivers you a message sometimes a box you take that box you take you back in your house you don't open it in the middle of the street you take it back sit down you open it up somebody sent me something holy spirit's delivered us a message today work well it's day the night comes when no man can work we worship the lord we open that gift up say lord jesus you brought this message to me lord i gotta work while it's day the night it's coming it's a prophecy we've seen it in preliminary phone form how was it the man said i was listening to our pastor the other day they said the number first three killers this last year you think pandemic right covet no it's number three first one is cancer second is heart disease third is covet but brother branham said there's diseases coming that'll make cancer look like a toothache kovid's way down the list but you see how covet is taking away the freedoms that we have and jesus prophesied and said the night's coming daniel the night's coming when you wish you could have sang a special when you wished you had the freedom to send a text to that brother and sister and you weren't sanctioned by the government i say we take that message and open it up in our hearts as we worship say lord let me work the works of him that sent me lord remember jesus said i come from god i go back to god i must do the works of him that sent me if you're a holy ghost believer and you believe in predestination amen then you must do the works that of the one that sent us in this day let's not be idle christians and sit around and waste time and frivolous nonsense of the world let's have a purpose let's have a purpose i was thinking i had it i just stuck it in my notes there yesterday brother ram talked about the psalm of life he said tell me not in mournful numbers life is but an empty dream the soul is dead that slumbers and things are not what they seem life is real life is earnest and the grave is not his goal dost thou art to dust return us was not spoken of the soul lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing or life solemn maine a forlorn ship left brethren seeing shall take heart again let us then be up and doing jesus at 12 years old we i'm smart well jesus was doing it at 12 surely we 25 35 45 55 65 with all that knowledge let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate still achieve still achieving still pursuing learn to labor learn to wait that was long longfellow's psalm of life let it challenge us today lord let me do more for your kingdom let me do what i can for the kingdom of god i think there's a verse in the bible my wife tells me that what she wants on her gravestone i am getting old we are getting all that's what i wanted my tim's up she did what she could she did what she could i want to do all that i can for the kingdom of god some of you do it some of your labor and i hear about like this one's doing this and they're sending a card they're sending a text and brother aaron labor and working and brother arnie and brother jordan and brother brother ed and they're doing and maybe there but each one of us have something that we can do for the kingdom of god and oh brother john has labored for years and years and years out in the east and started with a brother testifying i think to your brother wasn't it jerry that was in the military terror and he went back to a family reunion and they knew jerry and his temper and all that he was and and he was such a changed man like what happened to you what happened to you somebody testified to him and i haven't even met his brother as far as i know but his testimony his life is speaking to me today and i'm testifying of the power of jesus you say i got a temper brother daniel no problem god's got the answer for your temper brother daniel i got this secret sin that i can't overcome no problem god created you he can overcome that thing remember my sermon on palm sunday about the the donkey that never been ridden on had a nature and the creator went and sat on a donkey no man and he tamed that nature he contained the nature of a donkey and then surely he contained the nature of sons and daughters of almighty god that were created in his image oh blessed be the name lord there's nothing my god can't do there's no man that god can't break down and like paul is a pharisee of the pharisee and break him down and make him a a pillar make him the first church age messenger i'm so glad we serve a mighty god like that let's sing this little song is before we go oh for you yes lord isn't it good to have somebody that cares for your sunshine [Music] he cares oh thank you lord [Music] yes amen i know we end every service a little different but brother matt can you break loose from that come up here and pray for us his father spoke to us appreciate this family i don't know him really well but their life speaks amen their life speaks that's the main thing words are cheap but your life speaks amen brother matt just dismissed us in prayer and that little song will work till jesus comes i don't know if you all know that one amen let's all pray [Music] oh lord jesus we choose to put our trust in you lord with our thoughts lord we want to serve you lord with our words lord with our deeds and actions [Music] lord help me to put my shoulder to the wheel lord to work lord for

know that you are god we thank you lord for your word thank you lord for for planning from however long ago lord with this entire universe to create this people to worship you now today oh lord how great you are we cannot understand but with all that we can we love you [Music] as we go lord never from your presence always in your word in jesus name [Music] amen did you switch our mics all right praise the lord we'll find a mic that works and i don't like to close the service in a form because we don't want to have a form we just want to be free in the holy spirit and we're going to dismiss and sing this little song we'll work till jesus comes and if you want to stay and pray or sing you just stay brother jordan will take the service i like brother john would you mind maybe you and your wife would you all stand by the door and just shake the people's hands i appreciate them we've known brother peter mcfadden i want to talk about a few people's lives down through the years and man made a difference amen it's just not somebody coming but it's lives of great men have all woven together and parents and grandparents and make churches all across the nation i want to talk a little bit about some of that tonight seeing the petersons many years ago i think about 10 years ago brother jordan and sister martha's wedding out in florida it's quite a miracle how we just met cross paths and the next thing we're in arizona and just how it's all a network god has a body all across the world amen people that are working for the kingdom of god even before you were maybe even born god already had this church had people and people working for the kingdom of god i want to work till jesus comes we do it i work we'll we'll work till jesus comes and we'll pray to jesus comes we'll sing
