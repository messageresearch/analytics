[0:01] through our lane there where we live at
[0:03] morning it's like a
[0:06] racetrack have to hurry home to wash the
[0:09] dishes or listen to Arthur God for your
[0:11] something where are you going what's the
[0:16] matter what's got the thing all upset is
[0:19] because men and women have become lovers
[0:23] of this present
[0:26] World great thing ought to be would be
[0:29] come home to read the Bible into time to
[0:32] pray I think about John Wesley's mother
[0:36] Suzanne she was a mother of 17
[0:40] children and she had time to spend I
[0:43] think it was either two or three hours
[0:45] every day in prayer and raised and
[0:47] mother 17 children which brought forth
[0:52] one of the world's greatest preachers
[0:54] and one of the greatest songwriters of
[0:56] the day Charles and John
[1:00] because she took time to serve
[1:04] God and not dally in the things of the
[1:08] world and when we seen our foundation of
[1:12] our nation the foundation of our home
[1:15] the foundation of our church
[1:19] sinking then Brethren what can we
[1:23] do and I want to say this oh if I had a
[1:28] voice I could EO to the the world we
[1:31] have a solid
[1:35] foundation left and that's God's blessed
[1:38] holy word the
[1:41] Bible for all heavens and earth will
[1:45] pass away but God's word shall never
[1:48] pass
[1:50] away and upon found this Rock God said
[1:54] I'll build my church and the Gates of
[1:57] Hell cannot Prevail against it
[2:01] so what a blessed privilege it is to all
[2:03] of us to reach over and get God's good
[2:06] old Bible and turn the pages back and
[2:09] know that we're reading directly truth
[2:12] praise the Lord and to see that these
[2:16] times happened in days gone by for it
[2:19] speaks of a historical
[2:23] God and the only way that we're ever
[2:26] going to be to cope with these ways are
[2:29] to to to fall in line is to call up out
[2:34] of history that historical
[2:38] God or through all days of the andalan
[2:41] destruction before the coming of Christ
[2:44] and different events he never fails when
[2:48] he called on he's always
[2:53] right I'm thinking of a time now that
[2:57] when a
[2:58] nation was in captivity it was
[3:02] Israel and they were down in Egypt and
[3:05] was made hard and rigor to serve the
[3:10] Egyptians it seemed like that everybody
[3:13] had just grown cold did you know Israel
[3:17] was in Egypt twice as long as the United
[3:21] States has been a
[3:23] nation we're not over about 150 or 70
[3:26] years old something like that and they
[3:28] were 4 20 years in bondage or down in
[3:33] Egypt but it come a time when seemed
[3:36] like that all hopes is gone but there
[3:39] was one man and woman who seemed to have
[3:43] faith in a historical
[3:46] God that spoke to Abraham in the time of
[3:49] Crisis and they believed they could call
[3:51] on him and he'd
[3:53] answer that was ham amram and
[3:58] jehos the wife of H uh amram the mother
[4:02] and father of
[4:05] Moses and it's year sometime ago I was
[4:09] preaching and gave a little
[4:12] illustration of how that amram would
[4:16] come home at night and he'd say Jose I
[4:20] am so
[4:23] tired and the fresh lashes on his back
[4:26] from a a task Master's whip
[4:30] and she would sit down patiently perhaps
[4:33] and wash out the the places and weep and
[4:37] say oh
[4:39] am isn't there something that can be
[4:45] done I would hear him say oh dear if
[4:49] you'd have been with me today and seen
[4:51] them beat them young boys trying to pull
[4:54] those
[4:55] loads but they were heartless they
[4:58] treated him like they were animal
[5:01] and that's our young man of
[5:04] Israel isn't there something can be
[5:08] done that's what I wonder now to see our
[5:12] young teenage
[5:14] boys that will be the men and women of
[5:17] Tomorrow our teams
[5:19] today hair down in their neck and bres
[5:23] pulled out over their hips of the pistol
[5:26] stuck in their side and a cigarette and
[5:28] the side of their mouths what will it be
[5:31] it's still slavery under the
[5:36] devil isn't there something that can be
[5:42] done and amran perhaps one of the only
[5:45] ones of the nation would climb up a
[5:48] little stair
[5:49] steps regardless of how tart he was
[5:53] there each night he'd call on the god of
[5:58] Abraham one that he
[6:00] learned that come to Abraham and come to
[6:04] job and come to Isaac and come to
[6:08] Jacob and hours of distress and surely
[6:12] if he was God in their day he'd be God
[6:15] in that
[6:17] day and if he was God in Moses day he's
[6:21] God
[6:22] today
[6:24] amen he just needs to be called up out
[6:27] of
[6:28] History and called on the scene of
[6:34] action and I can see amram night after
[6:38] night no matter how
[6:41] tired that proved his faith in that
[6:45] God but today the people if they don't
[6:48] get everything they asked
[6:51] for the first time they pray they seem
[6:54] to think that he's
[6:57] dead what we need is man and women today
[7:00] of God's
[7:03] spirit man and women who are determined
[7:06] to hold on till they see a God that
[7:09] really lives come into
[7:14] action that will not take no for an
[7:18] answer they're determined to stay with
[7:22] it if they are sick and the doctor said
[7:25] they can't get well yet something within
[7:28] them tell am there going to be well hold
[7:31] on no matter what takes
[7:35] place have you join the churches of the
[7:39] denominational world after you have set
[7:43] all your strength from walking from
[7:45] place to place and you still can't find
[7:48] relief there's still a God that answers
[7:51] prayer and saves from sin
[7:56] amen and as we can see am those weary
[8:01] nights back bleeding climbing up the
[8:05] steps again until two and three o00 in
[8:08] the morning praying and seemed like he's
[8:11] just talking to the
[8:14] wind down in his Jewish heart there
[8:17] burned of
[8:19] faith that no Winds of Doubt could ever
[8:23] blow
[8:24] out that's the kind of man and women we
[8:27] need to rise on the scene today
[8:32] if he doesn't answer tonight he will
[8:34] tomorrow night if he doesn't answer this
[8:37] year he will next
[8:40] year for he's a
[8:43] God not a God but the God Amen and we
[8:49] see night after night as amran climbed
[8:52] the steps and jeos would come up to him
[8:55] and say amram dear you've been up here
[8:59] praying all
[9:03] night why don't you just tell some of
[9:05] the boys where you're working and let
[9:08] them pray a while well honey what if
[9:11] they don't do it somebody's got to do it
[9:16] somebody's got to pray
[9:18] through amen that's the way every
[9:20] Christian ought to feel tonight not
[9:23] waiting for somebody else but take the
[9:25] front ourselves and go
[9:28] through
[9:30] if we believe the Bible to be a history
[9:33] it's also a prophetic
[9:36] book that tells that that same God shall
[9:39] rise in the last
[9:41] days and it's time for him to come on
[9:44] scene that's what amram
[9:47] know that Moses had prophesied or not
[9:51] Moses pardon me
[9:52] Abraham had been given a promise by this
[9:55] God of History who hadn't answered a
[9:57] prayer in 400 years
[10:01] as far as we have
[10:02] record but he made a
[10:05] promise that he would bring them
[10:10] out and seemingly we've had a silent God
[10:13] for a long time but the hour has come
[10:18] where he's going to rise on the
[10:21] scene one night one amram had prayed
[10:25] maybe for several
[10:26] years and his hair now was turning GR
[10:29] praying no Deliverance but just getting
[10:32] worse one night he got right down to
[10:35] business that's how we have to do
[10:38] it get right down to
[10:40] business he said God you promise this
[10:46] and we've look forward to it and we see
[10:49] the signs all year and the time is at
[10:51] hand it's time for you to do something
[10:54] about it while he was in deep
[10:57] concentrated prayer praying with all of
[11:00] his heart he looks stand in the
[11:02] corner he rubbed his eyes and looked
[11:06] again there stood an
[11:08] angel with a sword
[11:11] drawn he said Deliverance is
[11:14] coming and you're going to bring a son
[11:17] into the world and he's going to be the
[11:19] one to deliver
[11:21] him see God always answers prayer
[11:26] doesn't he if we just hold on
[11:31] Moses when he had led the children of
[11:34] Israel Faithfully Into the
[11:37] Wilderness and he came to the Red
[11:41] Sea and the mountains on one side and
[11:45] the deserts on the other and Pharaoh's
[11:47] Army this away and the Red Sea in ahead
[11:50] of them and they were trapped in a
[11:51] little
[11:54] nck seemed like it even nature would cry
[11:58] out what's going to happen they're
[12:02] finished Pharaoh's Army by the tens of
[12:06] thousands to ride them down but what did
[12:09] the people begin to murmur and
[12:11] complain or have been better if we'd
[12:13] stayed back in our place where we were
[12:15] at but there was one among those people
[12:19] who had the flame of God's faith burning
[12:21] in his heart who believe that the
[12:23] historical God could rise on the scene
[12:25] in any kind of a
[12:28] difficulty Moses stood with his hands up
[12:30] to God and prayed until a god of History
[12:34] rose on the scene to be a God in present
[12:36] day and he opened up the way and Israel
[12:40] went through the waters on dry
[12:44] land Bo it was not long after that until
[12:47] Joshua had led the same group are their
[12:51] children to the
[12:54] jarden and it was in the month of April
[12:56] when the whole streams are swelling and
[12:59] the Jordan was five times its
[13:02] size look like any good military leader
[13:05] would have brought him there different
[13:06] from that in is that that very time when
[13:08] there wasn't a possibility to cross it
[13:11] but Joshua he remember there was a god
[13:14] of History 40 years before that opened
[13:16] the Red
[13:17] Sea and he called on that God that God
[13:21] came down in great power and become a
[13:24] God in present crisis and open the
[13:28] Jordan and cross them
[13:31] over was many years
[13:33] later when our text reading tonight or
[13:37] subject
[13:38] reading when Elijah had seen the curse
[13:41] of that nation and was up on the
[13:44] mountain and for hundreds of years there
[13:47] had been no prayer answered in Israel
[13:50] yet Elisha knew that there was a god of
[13:54] history that could come on the scene and
[13:56] he challenged the unbelieving world to
[13:59] stand in the presence of this God and
[14:00] see which one would answer by
[14:02] fire The God Who Could protect the
[14:05] Hebrew children from the fiery furnace
[14:07] brought down far and consumed the
[14:09] sacrifice it was also not long after
[14:12] that when a man had died by the name of
[14:16] Lazarus and there was a God that still
[14:21] lived that could take e home without
[14:25] even seeing death and take Elijah up on
[14:28] a CH a fire and he was called on the
[14:32] scene in the dark hour of death and he
[14:34] acted just the way he would at any time
[14:37] yet he was a god of history but was
[14:40] raised up from history to a present
[14:43] crisis down by the Jericho gate or a
[14:47] blind
[14:48] man set by the road
[14:51] crying all hopes is gone no doctors
[14:54] could do him any good his money was
[14:57] spent there was nothing nothing left for
[14:59] him but to sit there and dream for a few
[15:02] days till death would be a sweet relief
[15:06] one day coming down the road a god of
[15:09] History come on the scene in a present
[15:13] crisis God opened the eyes of the blind
[15:16] is in ji's house where the doctors had
[15:19] failed and turned the little girl back
[15:22] to the to be to die and death had come
[15:26] in and taken its bitter toll and taken
[15:29] the only child of the home the little
[15:31] girl of 12 and stretched her out on a
[15:34] couch when a brokenhearted little
[15:36] preacher had to forsake his denomination
[15:39] and all of his
[15:40] friends but he remembered that there was
[15:43] a god of History who could raise it
[15:45] there amen and he went to find him seek
[15:50] and ye shall find knock and it'll be
[15:53] open unto you as and it shall be given
[15:56] unto
[15:57] you he still the same
[16:01] God when this God dwelling in a body
[16:04] called Jesus the son of God when he was
[16:07] called on the scene called up out of
[16:12] History The God Who Could raise the dead
[16:15] in the Old Testament bring life back to
[16:17] a dead baby through a
[16:19] prophet but God cannot
[16:22] die he's God for
[16:25] eternity that baby laying down on the
[16:28] bed stretched out and little Jas knowing
[16:33] that the shunamite got her baby back he
[16:36] said that God of History if he could
[16:38] ever be called into action he's the same
[16:41] God today
[16:43] amen and searching through he had heard
[16:46] some man that's claimed to have the
[16:49] power and that was Jesus of Nazareth who
[16:51] they all hated but he called him on the
[16:54] scene for he's the closest
[16:56] representative he could find of God at
[16:58] the today the god of the Living God and
[17:01] when he was called on the scene and the
[17:03] historical God was called up he acted
[17:06] the same way he did when he spoke to
[17:08] Elijah on that dead baby let me more say
[17:13] today my brother sister in this present
[17:15] day when crisis and when cancer is
[17:18] eatting the world up and diseases of all

[17:25] dead is the same God today he's waiting
[17:28] an for his people to call him on the
[17:30] scene of
[17:33] action one who could forgive a heart for
[17:36] committing adultery seven times in a day
[17:40] he who could cleanse the B Sinner and
[17:43] make them white as a Lily that same God
[17:47] of History lives today to clean out
[17:49] blacken heart of sin and unbelief
[17:53] Hallelujah there was a man had a bar
[17:55] with epilepsy one day and he talking to
[17:57] the church and the was danced and
[17:59] hollered around him for a while and
[18:01] could do no good but there was still a
[18:03] god of history that lived he was
[18:06] determined to find him see me coming off
[18:09] the mountain he run to him and said Lord
[18:11] have mercy on me a devil stuck my child
[18:15] and he Pines away and falls into the
[18:17] fire Jesus said I can if you believe if
[18:21] you believe
[18:23] what if you believe that the god of
[18:25] History still lives today and he was
[18:28] called on the scene and the epilepsy
