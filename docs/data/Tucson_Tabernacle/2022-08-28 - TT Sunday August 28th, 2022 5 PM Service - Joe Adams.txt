thank the lord for that this evening [Music] the prayer of faith went up and the god that we serve responded so thank the lord for that let's just go to him in prayer this evening as we commit to service to him father with a great honor great privilege that we have to come and before the purchase of the blood lord and we're so thankful that we can come into your house and your presence lord expecting great three things from you today and god we just asked you to speak lord we heard you this morning and we just invite you once again lord not only into this church but father we invite you into our hearts we invite you into our private lives lord we invite you to every door we open it up this morning and say voice of god speak speak to our needs god may you move us in the direction you would have us to go this evening and i just pray lord you'll know the ears of the hero so we love you father we just commit this to you now in jesus name if you have your bibles we're going to we're going to pick back up here in revelations 3. pick back where we left off this morning trust you enjoy the word this morning god is faithful he's good to us he says behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and i will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and i am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches god bless you saints you can be seated this evening so we find here as we had looked at this morning and the bible would tell us behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hears or attends to that voice gives credence to that voice understands what that voice is saying not just the audible voice but the reason behind the voice and opens their door the heart of their door to him he said i will come in and i will sup with him or i will have fellowship with him and he will have fellowship with me and we find here this is the church of laodicea and we notice where he is at in the end time the bible would tell us that the church system has gone with the voice of man and they put the voice of god on the outside of the church they have gone with the ideas of man they've gone with the denominational mindset and what have they done they put christ on the outside and now he's on the outside of his own church knocking to get back in and i'm afraid church that many even now many message churches are getting in this same predicament where they're pushing christ outside the door because they're saying well it's got to be this way and that way and this way and when you say it's got to be this way that way and you hinder the movement of the spirit you essentially put christ on the outside but we find here these men have gone on many men many many people today in denominations they've gone on with man's psychology they've gone on with traditions of man they put god on the outside of the church but here he is compelling if you open the door if you hear my voice if you open your heart if you would do that then i will come in and i will make a change in your life and that's what we're looking for in this hour we don't want to just be church goers we don't want to be just christians i'm sorry i don't want to just be a christian but i want to be a believer i want to be a part of that special group that we spoke about this morning that bride and it takes us opening our lives up to him and giving him the preeminence into our lives that he desires that means we gotta withhold nothing back that means we gotta open up every door the door to the bedroom the door to the living room the door to the secret place all these different aspects you gotta open up every door because he's knocking he's desiring to come in he wants to have the preeminence in his body but he's a gentleman he's not going to kick the door down so we're looking at again this this evening listen to the voice now he's looking for those that have ears to hear those that can open up their lives and and receive that voice and we heard just as we we heard this morning in john 10 my sheep they hear my voice and i know them god recognizes who is his and who is not his but we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that those that are his sheep those that hear the voice of god those that are known by god there's no way that they can be deceived by any false teaching they're not going to be deceived by by man's intellect they're not going to be deceived by denominational views or hierarchies or traditions of man they're going to hear nothing but the voice of god i will say this it's not possible for you here this evening that are tuned into the voice to be deceived now there's going to be many who will be but there's going to be a group that will not be they can't be they're predestinated not to be the sea because why because your ears have been anointed to hear the truth your ears have been anointed to hear the voice of god that vindicated voice that anointed voice that living voice and that's why we're here today is because we have heard from our beloved and notice has there been many of you we have internet so we we we watch the news on the internet or we listen or read the news or whatever it may be and there's all these different aspects but there's in this day that we're living in there's so many voices that are vying for your attention some good some bad right and we find that but the sheep are only going to hear the voice of the shepherd so what a blessed people we are this morning to be able to hear and i'm driving this home because i know you heard a lot of this this morning but we're down we're picking back up blessed are you that have ears that can hear never take for granted your position or never take her for granted the opportunity that has been given to you that has been afforded to you to be able to receive the message of the hour because there's multitudes that would desire to sit where you sit but they're not elected to that place you have been predestinated to hear this message what a great people we are now the bible would tell us in amos 3 7 surely the lord god will do nothing but what he revealeth his secrets unto his servants the prophets so god uses humanity right some humanity you get discouraged with some humanity we prop up but yet it's god's way brother bam will tell us he said in the angel of god and preached in phoenix 1947 he said he sent the angel to speak through man or the voice of man god always used man for his work so god has no other way he uses man he doesn't use organizations or so forth and mechanical devices that's a sticky little topic today hitting it around the message and they're wanting you to push play but he says he doesn't use mechanical devices god orchestrated in his word a five-fold ministry that is the method by which he's coming that is the means by which he's going to deliver his voice to his elect now i'm not saying that you can't push play because as i said many times before i push play all the time i was pushing play on the way here i push play on the plane i push play in my study i'm pushing play at the gym i'm always pushing play but we're in a house of god and he's not going to get back in there's an anointed fivefold ministry that's part of that voice but see he uses man the holy spirit fellow man and that's god's instrument here on earth god he said god used man for his agents is that right always god used man to be his agent jesus was god's agent elijah was god's agent john was god's agent and i will say this brother aaron guerra is god's agent i'm god's agent william branham was god's agent all the anointed ministry out there they're god's agent that's the way that's the means by which god is coming to deliver his voice into his people john 15 and verse 4. let's turn there this evening i'm not going to hold you too long this evening so don't worry i don't know what happened to the rest of our church like we we had a church split this morning we had about 85 90 here this morning we're about 45 47 this evening i'm not sure what i said but god please forgive me he says abide in me and i in you and as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye accept you abide in me so i am the vine and you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing notice now the vine has a certain life in it so if the vine has a certain life in it and the branch is part of the vine then won't the branch have the very same life that's in the vine just you can't separate the two right but he that he says now notice but when he was here on earth he was divine and when he was going away he is still the vine and made up of the branches see he said he doesn't have any any hands on earth but your hands so look at your hands this evening my my my some of you see wrinkles some of you like me you got little scuffs and some scrapes but those are the hands of christ now i know sometimes you don't feel that way right how in the world can he use me but he has no hands on earth but your hands he has no lips on earth but your lips no mouth to speak but what we allow him to speak through our being he says he doesn't have any hands on earth but your hands no hands but mine and yours we are his mouthpiece his earpiece his eyes and so forth of the earth is that right he said the branch is energized by the life of the vine therefore jesus has no lips tonight on earth but mine in yours oh my be careful what you speak see he has no eyes but mine and here he has no hands but mine and yours he energizes us and we bring forth his life as he brings it through us see whether it's preaching the gospel by lip seeing by vision whether it's whatever it is laying on the hands on the sick whatever it is christ is working through the branches of his church every office literally electrified by his presence every office preacher teacher pastor evangelist and profit every office electrified by his presence is that all right but we find that voice has always been veiled by the human flesh now how many have ever been hung up never don't raise your hand that's a trick that's a rhetorical question but sometimes we get hung up on this humanity right right and i'm coaching y'all this evening sometimes we get hung up but god's method god's way is always man and we know there's some men you like are you sure you're called because you watched their life you know things may just don't settle out right and you're watching it and if you're not careful many times we see the faults and the failures of the individual and then we make a statement that god there's no way god could speak through that vessel right but the prophet if you remember the prophet said he could bring a rank center off the street and preach the gospel to him and he'd go right back out now we don't want that but what i'm saying is sometimes we get hung up on this vessel okay so as i keep going here listen he is veiled in man he always was veiled but he was veiled unto them he was veiled in his human temple god was in his human temple be real careful now he's the same yesterday today and forever so god veiled himself hiding himself from the world veiled in human flesh so where is he yet today he's veiled today in human flesh when brother branham went off the scene christ is still here the holy ghost is still here the word is still here he only emorphate he changed his robe and he now he's no longer in a one-man ministry but now he's in a multi-member body now it's the body of his bride and we find that he's veiled in human flesh right see moses was that veil the living word of god fell behind human flesh and the pillar of fire was in moses right well let me just tell you the same pillar of fire that was in moses is here with us today he's still god he's still a pillar of fire he's still a deserter the very thoughts and intents of the heart he's still the healer he's still a deliverer he's still god and his voice is still prevalent and revelant today amongst the body of christ that he is coming for church she says now brother baby says in the unveiling of god it's been failed through these ages according to what god said it will be open in the last days those seven seals will be broke and the full thing will come into view of the people what took place all along the hour of the seventh angel's message all the mysteries of god should be made known in that elijah that last hour how that christ is put out of the church the son of god how he is revealed as the son of man again son of man the opening of the word revealing of the word of god how that the church is to put them out in order and everything for the last day no creed no denomination just absolutely the word living in the individual let me tell you that's what we're wanting today i don't want my man's idea i don't want man's psychology i want the living god by the living word orchestrating through my vessel and be able to preaching through my lips and anointing your ears that you're not hearing the voice of a man but you're hearing the voice behind the voice and when you can hear that voice then it doesn't matter what your problem is it doesn't matter what your situation is it doesn't matter what your need for healing is because god will respond because you hear the voice behind the voice see they had to hear the voice behind moses because moses tried and he failed as a man but when the voice spoke through moses let my people go satan had to let go pharaoh had to let go so god has always veiled himself today behind these old badger skins you know the badger was a mean animal still is a mean animal he had a hard time catching that badger to strip those skins off of them to make the tabernacles the curtains of the tabernacle but god was veiled behind those curtains and today he's fell behind these old badgers skins of ours you look at people you got questions let's just be honest but it's still christ he's still there the thing is we've got to be able to discern what's the spirit of the word versus the spirit of the man so notice now the veil in human flesh the promised word to this age must also be veiled this is in the unveiling of god notice the sin-loving church members and sinners cannot see it because of this human veil so i wonder why they can't see what we see because of this human veil because remember the prophet of god is the mouthpiece of god he would say it's a sign that's always overlooked the prophet and this veil has hid the word through a seventh grade kentuckian from the masses but your ears have been tuned in to hear what the spirit is saying to the church he says now this is in the mess of super sign if the world could only see that god and man are one the super sign was first man that god could come into all that god was he pours into christ and all that christ was he pours into the church the super sign god and man together that was to be the super sign of the last day when the entire bible was to be fulfilled in the last day not waiting on a prophet to come back not waiting on a prophet to finish the word but god now all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he empties itself out into a people oh come on you're the super sign today you're the ones that he's coming for your everything that god has done has been done with you in mind that god was gonna so fill you with the word god was going to so fill you with his anointing god was going to so move in your life that you can lay a little mother can lay your hand on the fevered brow and that fever bride will leave and that kid will be made well not looking to a preacher not looking to a prophet but you in your own home you in your own bed chamber you in your own prayer closet can reach the throne of god and get your knees met by almighty god he said they got their superman today they got fake fictions of superman all these kind of super things but the church has got a super sign god back in the church manifested in human flesh god united with man his super sign i say oh glory to god tonight you may have questioned who you were but the prophet of god just told you you're god's super sign for this hour i told i think i told y'all before when i was young my brother and i used to wake up on saturday morning cartoons right i got any cartoon watchers back when you were young i know y'all grew up in the messes i didn't so sorry blame my mom and dad we'd get up on saturday morning it was cartoon saturday hey we like batman and robin and we like superman and i was always superman but i was a super fat superman i'd put that pillowcase around my neck climb up on my dresser jump off the bed fly around i'm superman he was my hero but god ain't looking for that superman now the superman is living right here in front of me you are the voice the final voice to the final age god ain't looking from super some super fantastic he's looking for a bride that'll take him at his word and she will be the little voice she will be the manifestation of the word of god and i'm looking at the super song paleodicia you are the word made flesh you are the manifestation of the sons of god you are what god has desired in his in his ministry you right here tonight everything that he has done he's veiling it behind your humanity oh you're good oh you're bad as they like to say the good the bad the ugly he says now as it is done in every age deity failed in human flesh y'all know what deity means i'm not challenging your intelligence i'm trying to draw a point deity veiled in human flesh the prophets was deity veiled they was the word of god is that right veiled in human flesh but notice what the prophet of god says here now this is gonna this to me just really just strikes my heart he says this is in the deity of jesus christ the same power the same christ hallelujah let the fundamentalists let them whoever deny the power of god they say that it's wrong but the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the holy ghost i don't know how you can't shout about that the same power that spoke the world otherwise that same power that believed what he was going to speak when he spoke it it formed exactly what he spoke and he's saying that same power that same existence is in the people that's got the holy ghost today he didn't put it off in a day gone by but he's telling you that same power that same anointing that same holy ghost that same deity is right here tonight and the prophet of god will say you can take the words of god and place it on your lips and it's just just the same as deity speaking your voice can become his voice notice what he says now men and women it's time that you found out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little coward down something you're not your sons and daughters of god deity is not in heaven can i finish this sentence deity is not in heaven it's in you oh my you look at yourself you know your shortcomings you know your habits you know your faults you know your failures but he says deity is not in heaven it's in you oh my that's shouting grounds he said he's the creator of all things he made frogs he made bees and ducks and chickens animals created everything there was nothing that was made but was made by him who christ and the deity and he brought down plagues everything in the days of egypt who christ he stopped the mouths of lions he quenched the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword they raised the dead from the grave who he said christ who is christ christ is the deity and he said my brother sister that deity is in you oh hallelujah otherwise that voice the voice is in you tonight but he's veiled behind this so we find out as i was saying many times we get hung up brother aaron on the veil of this human vessel right we we we begin to whether it be not your favorite preacher maybe he's too loud maybe he shouts too much maybe he's too evangelistic or maybe he's too boring let's just go to the opposite side of the spectrum because i'm not boring i can tell you that i know better than that the devil can take a bunch of names on me but he could not put that one there but we find all these things but yet we are the vessel by which he chooses to work through and many times we get hung up on this human veil and we fail to hear the word or we fail to listen to the voice okay i'm going somewhere with this we find that the closer the closer you become to a pastor the closer you become to a preacher the closer you become to the evangelists and you begin to see the humanity you begin to see that they're just like you they make mistakes they're not perfect what no and if we're not careful we put too much focus we can put too much focus on their faults and their humanity and when they stand behind the pulpit and they're preaching and the anointing of the holy spirit is down and because you're close to them and you know some things because they're not perfect it can hinder you from receiving the word it can hinder you from listening to the voice now on the flip side of that there are those that we elevate and we elevate them to an office that they shouldn't be we elevate them they can't make any wrong anything that they say becomes thus saith the lord and when that happens because we elevate the vessel to such a high place and then when that happens we can fail and miss the voice because we're thinking everything that they say is thus saith the lord thus saith the lord thou sayeth but the humans they're veiled the word is veiled behind human flesh see god chose this weak frail vessel to speak the word and he chose weak frail vessels to hear the word but god equips us to discern between what is right and what is wrong see and if you're in in and here's the thing is you you got to you got to get to the place church where it's not your favorite preacher i may not be your favorite preacher i'm not here trying to be your favorite preacher brother aaron may not be he he's not trying to be your favorite preacher but nevertheless whether it's your favorite preacher or not favorite delivery or not because some people some of you are like teaching there's ain't nothing wrong with teaching this anointed some of you like evangelistic we all have different appetites how many of y'all like cheesecake okay three or four yo my goodness it's a tough crowd tonight on a sunday night but we all have our different likes and dislikes now i'm a dessert fan i love dessert i like ice cream you can tell i got a little bit of love handle on that side a little bit of ice cream on that side cheesecake here everywhere here there everywhere you know old macdonald had a farm where he added some couple farms right there so i enjoy desserts but i don't eat all of them because some of them i don't like and so we have different tastes but long as we're eating as long as we're feeding on the word and that's what the prophet of god will tell us you may not like cherry pie just spit the seed out don't go not showing up because you don't like it get what you can get and then spit the stuff out you don't like but you got to make sure that you're hearing the voice don't spit that out so now we find every voice the prophet of god said has a sign or every sign has a voice so when moses came to the pillar of fire there was a voice that spoke out of that pillar of fire and the pillar of fire that burning bush had what moses liked and so the same pillar fire that was in is the same pillar of fire today what the burning bush had then we have it today and yet it's the same and why does god do these things god sends a sign and he sends a voice with that sign to attract the attention of the people so why did we have a healing revival in the 40s and 50s so the brother brandon can prop himself up to be somebody no god was getting a people ready to hear the opening of the word god knew that he was going to provide he had that seventh angel on the scene and he knew that at a certain time in 63 in march that they was going to meet that prophet in that closet and he was going to loose the seals and the people were finally going to see exactly what the word was for them in that day but what did he do he many years prior 10 the 40s and the 50s some 10 to 15 to 20 years he was preparing the people getting them ready attracting their attention so that they could receive the word when the word came when that voice began to thunder out and it shifted now from the healing revival it shifted from the signs and it shifted from the wonders and now it moved into the phase of the opening of the word now he has a people ready that can receive that voice and that's why we're here today some 59 60 years later we're here because why because our ears have been attended to we have attended to what that spirit says what that voice says and anytime god gets ready to speak god has to get an audience he doesn't just speak to speak so a prophet is always a sign that god is ready to speak he said the coming of a prophet is a sign that's overlooked by the people every time they overlooked it they never get it somehow he says let's just those who have got eyes that are open to see it those who are elected to see it see they those that are elected to see it they do see it but the coming of a prophet was a sign that god is ready to speak and let me go on notice today to say god has already spoken there's not another message there's not another messenger there's not another age we don't need profits rising up like major profits in that regard we don't need somebody to rise up and finish what brother branham started though if you are aware what's going on around the ranks of the message around the world there's men raising up to that caliber now they're going to finish what the prophet of god didn't finish but the bible says when the seventh angels shall begin to sound the mysteries of god should be finished we don't need another man rising up i'm not looking for another man to rise up i got my man i've heard the voice behind the voice so notice now brother but i'll make this statement here in the voice of the sign the laodicean sign must be the same as it was then there will be a voice speak to us in the last day how many can say amen to that can i get a louder amen maybe all right that's better i'm working with you we're going to get there before it's over with see he says now remember laodicean sign jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and when he was put out of the church there in the level of cnh we found out that he was put out he put out again on the outside look the voice if any man will cooperate if anybody will let me in i'll come in and sup with him and they with me i'll come in i will be in them standing on the outside of the rank of the church age knocking trying to get back in and he says if any man will open the door and just cooperate with me a little i'll come in and sup with him i will make myself known to them so the sign of the scriptural the sign of the scriptural voice is for the word to be vindicated so how do you know that it's a supernatural voice when it comes to past that's how you discern whether it's the voice of god or not now the bible would tell us here in first samuel 3 and verse 1. many of us are familiar with this the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days because there was no open vision if you go back and you read the first part of first samuel here 3 2 chapters 1 2 3 we find that that samuel came on the scene and the eli began to let down the bars eli his sons were taking the best of the offerings they were doing this and doing that and eli refused to correct his sons and he allowed this and the prophet of god would say that he got careless about the way he handled the commandments of the lord and the real word of god was a rare thing and he says that's the way it is today that's why we got to make sure we line completely up with this message that's what we want to hear i don't care what man man can say well the prophet of god said this and the prophet of god i said that point me back to it let me see it because you find that man has made those statements all along and when you get back to it he never made that statement he may have said something similar to that and yet it's got misconstrued or it's got misinterpreted and we have the prophet of god we have the voice saying something that it never said so we got to be careful always take it back to the bible take it back to the message don't just hear with anybody say don't just gum down anything brother baby says now we got so many things ahead of the lord you can't have a prayer meeting obviously i don't know where 45 people went this evening but you can't have a prayer meeting because mr godfrey's own tonight you can't have a prayer meeting because we love susie is on tonight or some kind of foolish nonsense like that that takes up the time and we don't have time to hear the voice of the lord now let me just say i'm not picking on those that are not here they hey who knows what come up so let me just make that correction but those who do claim to be christians just kneel down a little prayer like this kind of homemade lord bless me my family take care of us good night now i know none of you have ever prayed that prayer oh maybe you have now i'm guilty i'm just going to be honest with you tonight i'm tired i'm like lord hey look i want to talk to you but tonight ain't tonight i'm going to bed good night but he said the next morning we rise and we say just guide us through the day good day and he says we shall wait on the lord he says we do all the talking we don't give him a chance to talk back to us that if we would pray and pray until our souls come into the presence of god and then just relax and listen to his voice you know since i've gone full time in the ministry i have time now brother aaron to in the mornings when i had my devotion i would get up before i would get up an hour too early and i would read my bible and i would pray but you're always in a time restraint because you got to go to work right you got to get there on time and you got to be ready and you got to be alert you got to be awake and all that but now i can devote that mourning my time and i can sit there and i can begin to pray and it doesn't matter how long i pray it doesn't matter how long i read the bible it doesn't matter how long i have communion and fellowship with him because now time has been allotted but we have to get to that place to where when we begin to pray and and we stop praying for a minute or stop doing all the talking that the voice can begin to speak to us i was praying several months back and i believe i preached a service here uh from that prayer from that devotion that morning that nothing is impossible with god not even cancer and because i was praying and i was caught up the lord began to speak to me nothing will stand before the believer's prayer and he dropped those words not even cancer and we find but everything now is vying for your attention how many has an iphone how many has a samsung we got smartphones we got ipads we got gadgets beyond gadgets we got smart tvs we got dumb tvs and some of you got tv so don't act like you don't but all these things what is it it's voices trying to get your attention and now you find young people even young teenagers they're so occupied with this social media and that social media this chat group and that chat group i was working out with my son the other day and we go to the gym and he's on his phone the whole time like how in the world can you work out texting the entire time like put your phone down let's enjoy this father-son time we're getting swole together i'm swelling up in other ways he's swelling up in good ways right but we find we have so many things there's so many voices and let me get there because i'm i'm i'm losing time here i want to get to some of these things but we find the voice of god has become foreign and that's the same thing that's happened in america today that now america is no longer deemed a christian nation think about our political system it's full of right wing left ring wing liberals who refused the voice of god they refused the voice of conservatism they refused biblical principles our country and many other countries around the world now do not recognize the voice of god in any of their leadership you think about even in the past two years of this administration you see the laws that have been passed i know some of you know that you just got tacked on with taking care of all the student loan debt right thank your administrator then we find that laws are being passed that you have to do this and you have to do this and you know the laws that support homosexual transgender movement and laws that strip away our civil liberties and yet we find that you got people calling to the politicians that you know about abortion it's our body we should be able to do what we want with it but come early in 2020 when we were refusing to take the vaccination and saying it's our body we should have a choice those same people that is crying out it's our body we can do what we want with it wasn't saying the same then they were saying you need to get the vaccine see the double standard in the liberal media and we find that the liberal media is taking this and america has rejected the word it's turned down the voice of god and the only thing left for america is judgment and the problem of god was that there are so many voices in the earth today that it's absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men who are intelligent that in their intellectual conditions even shake the nations and they're just not overnight he said they're just not overnight people but they shaped the nations bringing great organizations together great campaigns flowery he said and a person would be a bit confused it's enough to confuse him of how these things can go on and prosper in their voices that raise up and do these things and it causes the voice of god to be placed back on a shelf since it causes people to be confused what is the voice of god because isn't if if they're so blessed and so prosperous then shouldn't the voice be there for blessed are your eyes blessed are your ears for they hear let me get down to somewhere i want to get to this evening see elijah we know the story about elijah he went and hung out in a cave and we find here in first kings 19 and verse 11 he said go go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and the great and strong wind rent the mountains and breaking the pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake of fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice see and it was so that when elijah heard it then he wrapped his face in his mantle he went out and he stood in the entering of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou hear elijah and if we're not careful we get caught up we can get caught up in the wind but the voice wasn't in the wind see his ears were trained to listen to the voice of god the winds came but he didn't hear the voice and some people get captivated by all the emotion people get captivated by the noise he said there wasn't an earthquake it wasn't in the fire but it was in that still small voice see elijah had trained is there he knew how to listen to god and he knew what he was listening for when he was in the cave he was listening for what caused the excitement he was listening for what caused that wind to blow by or what caused the earth to quake or what caused the fire to roar he was listening for what was behind that and that's what we need to be listening for in every sermon that has ever preached don't just listen to the audible voice of the man but listen to the voice that has anointed him to say the things that he's saying what spirit is anointed that man to say those things because the last thing you want is to take the spirit of a man so we find now we have to be able to to discern the voice of reason from the voice of doubt from the voice of unbelief from the voice of intellectualism to that of the genuine voice of god the genuine voice of god will manifest itself every time but we find there's great voices in the land today and brother adam goes through a few of these and we'll go through a few of these real quick before we close this evening he says many times we just as we just seen recently that the voice of politics is actually a stronger is actually stronger than the voice of god in the churches and he says now are the american people would have never did what they just did this is in 1963 what did they just do they just elected a catholic president and we find now we're 60 years down the road from this how loud is that political voice today my mama think about it we're 60 years down the road that political voice has gotten louder and louder and louder do you know that six of the nine supreme court justices are all catholic nine are catholic i mean six are catholic excuse me 30.5 of congress is catholic protestants make up 55 of the seats in the house and senate but there's so many different protestant denominations that the catholic voice is the single largest faith group in the house and senate therefore it gives him the largest voice and the voice of politics is changing rules in the land every day making decisions that do not line up to us to what we would do or what we would support and we also hear there's a boys bill graham said there's also in america the day and the rest of the world there's a loud voice speaking today and that's the voice of hollywood and what does hollywood hollywood films glorify sex they glorify violence attacking the moral values of our societies and leads to youth astray do you know when young people gun down violence they begin to act out violence when they look and they feed on sexual activity they begin to be curious and they begin to practice even at a young age sexual acts and they get careless in their actions we find here that the hollywood voice promotes risky behaviors such as drinking and smoking doing drugs it promotes violence and vital behaviors murders and rapes and etc it entices fast cars and even faster women the voice of hollywood promotes the lgbq agenda and it desensitizes the youth to feel that this lifestyle is okay because now everything goes people have become woke y'all know what that term means right they become awakened to the injustices of what appears to be the unjust no it's laodicea people's rights everybody has a right to give their own voice and when they do they drowned out the voice of god and that is what's happened in our day and that is why we have to be careful that we only hear the voice now how many of you are patriotic okay that's okay you don't like what's happening to our country do you but you get to the place where it has to happen because we know there's something greater behind it because it's prophecy being fulfilled because we've heard the voice if we didn't have this message if we didn't have the voice that we have telling us what to prepare for we have every right to be up in arms there would be another civil war and i frankly i'd start the thing it drive me nuts but you have to recognize that's not the voice that i'm listening to voice of politics the voice of patriotism yeah i'm an american but before i'm an american i'm a christian i'm a believer and i'm listening to that voice and so we got to be careful of what voice and what we allow ourselves to get captivated by and caught up by but we find the hollywood voice is screaming out against everything that the bible stands against and is screaming out against everything that you stand for and satan is doing his very best with his propaganda machine called hollywood and his liberal media to create his eden he's done a great job church give him a round of applause he can have his eating because where we're going we don't have to worry about that any longer but we find hollywood all these things are trying to captivate our attention and they want to influence the decisions that you make the decisions that you make in your private life the decisions that you make in your home decisions that you make for your kids do you realize that there are former message believers that their kids are grown kids 14 15 and they are yet given them the permission to choose what gender they want to be they have so succumbed to the the mindset and the thinking of the voice of laodicea and satan's eden that former message believers grew up in the message godly mom godly brothers and sisters people that i know personally and yet because they've been so influenced they've yielded themselves to that voice their kids now have a right to choose what sex they want to be i'm figuring out how they gonna put this neutral gender thing on the bathroom doors and we find now the one of the uh i think one of their kids he's he's a he or they don't even go by he now they go by they and them confuse the world out of me i'm like man that's that's nouns and pronouns and i'm all messed up but them and they because they don't know what they are yet because them is stupid is what i said them is dumb god made you one way but we fine now the boy who's like 13 he's bisexual now how are you bisexual when you never had an encounter so you see the mindset of this age and hollywood has promoted it and the voice of laodicea has promoted it and that's why we have to protect our young people that's why we have to protect what we're watching what we're listening to we have to make sure that we're listening to the voice of god listen moms and dads don't you compromise kids may fight they may rebel but don't you compromise because you're their protection i have four kids and there's times that you know what the kids can kick they can scream they can fuss they can holler but at the end of the day i'm responsible and we make sure that they if they're going to watch anything it's going to be something that's holy something that's that's wholesome and family oriented but we find now so many of the churches today the nominal system they don't they've gotten away from the voice brother aaron of the lord and they're going after their own voice and brother bam said it's smothered out by so many different voices that it's the voice of god is so dim but it goes back to blessed are your eyes for they hear in your ears or your ears for they hear in your eyes for they see so when god wants to speak he gets a people ready to hear now as i bring this to a close this evening i want to bring it with this testimony here of this story how many ever heard of brother uh david gibbs he's not a message believer but he's of the christian law association he gives a testimony and you can find it on youtube and other places a very powerful testimony and i'm going to go through it with you this morning because or they're seeing them because it just parallels right here so perfectly there's two attorneys david gibbs and another attorney they were in alaska in the aleutian islands and they were doing a lawsuit and they were getting ready to fly back to anchorage and then they were going to go home and they would be at home with their families and they had a ticket in their pocket they're about to get on the plane and a pastor come up to him and he says listen i can save you some money no who don't want to hey i'm all about saving money right maybe you don't maybe you want to spend a little extra when he says well how's that he says well i flew a plane up here and i fi i fly a small plane up here and i can take you in my plane back to anchorage you can save that ticket save that money use it again later and he debated it for several minutes and he said against my better judgment i agreed so they went out to the airport he took him around the plane and he looked at it and he thought well you know it's very shiny sometimes i saw we look at on the outside well you know it's shiny it's yeah i think that could do it and the pastor walked around and got in the plane and david gibbs got in the front and another attorney got in the back and you know they started out on the runway everything is doing fine and they tax it out to the runway and uh he david spoke to the pastor he said should we pray says well you know it probably wouldn't hurt we don't normally do this well he says we're going to this time and so they go out on you know they prayed and they started down the runway and everything is great and there's no problem they begin to climb up into the you know lift up and begin to to lift up into the clouds or lift up into the sky and everything's going great about three to four minutes into it and the pilot turned to the attorney or he turned to david gibbs and he says we're going into the clouds and i can't fly in the clouds they make me pass out hold up that's the wrong time to tell me you can't fly in the clouds but the attorney said the clouds the clouds make you do what he said the clouds make me pass out he says now it's been cloudy all day and they're going right up into the clouds right then and he said the attorney or the pilot looked over at him and he began to mumble and his eyes rolled back and he passed out now they're in the clouds they don't know which way they're going they don't know if they're upside down they don't know nothing all that they know is that they don't have a pilot and neither one know how to fly a plane now here i think we got a fighter jet pilot back here maybe he can help me out this evening but he says now it's been cloudy all day and they go right up into the clouds and can't see nothing and the pilot looked at the attorney his eyes wrote back in his hand he starts mumbling and he passes out and he passed out cold and he took him and he shook him brother and he said come on you got to wake up but he wasn't waking up and the attorney in the back says we're dead aren't we he said it's a good chance that we are he says what are we going to do and they had got on the the radio and they began to say hello hello they didn't have any proper radio etiquette and this other guy got on on the other end and he answered back he was a a freighter pilot he said you guys don't know how y'all don't have any radio editing he said we don't have any radio etiquette we don't have any we don't have no understanding only thing that we know is we're in a plane we don't know how to fly the plane and we got a pilot that is passed out he says you mean to tell me you don't know how to fly the plane and you got a passed out pilot he said yes that is correct we don't know nothing but we know that we don't know how to get home and he says well i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to circle around so i don't lose you because if i get out of if i get out of range then you're going to lose me he says what i'll do is i'll i'll contact anchorage emergency and anchorage emergency will be the ones that will get you home they will help you get home and it goes any he says now five minutes pass and anchorage came on and he said we understand that you have a passed out pilot you don't know how to you don't know how to fly the plane he said well that's correct he said well the first thing i got to do is i got to find you what did god do he says i come to seek and save those that were lost he's got to find us right he goes my job is to get you home safe he said now here's the deal if you want me to get you home safe you got to promise me that you'll listen to my voice he goes he says now you can't see me but i can see you and if you're gonna if you're not gonna listen to my voice then you're gonna die and the man from anchorage came back and and they're talking back and he goes okay i finally found you now hear me clear he says you're about four minutes away from a mountain he goes you're gonna crash into that mountain and you're gonna die if you don't follow my voice the attorney he didn't look at him and say does this make sense do i really need to follow your voice see he understood that without that voice he had nothing and without that voice church that voice the voice we have nothing we don't have a message we don't have an absolute we don't have anything what are we we're flying but we're flying without a pilot he goes that way in anchorage amer or anchorage alaska came back says now i'm going to freeze all the traffic in the area because i'm going to it's going to take me about an hour and a half to get you back to anchorage and there's a lot of bad weather between you and anchorage he goes it's going to be a rough ride but he says i want you to hear me now don't he goes i don't want you to look at what's going on on the outside i don't want you to pay attention to the storm i want you to just pay attention to my voice and i believe god can say the same things to us today don't pay attention to what's going on on the outside don't look at all the political chaos don't pay attention to the storms that you're going through the personal tragedies the personal storms just listen to my voice pay attention to his voice it'll be that voice that'll get us through brother aaron so he cleared all the traffic and there's other pilots that begin to come on after they cleared the pile of 747 pilots and freighter pilots began to come on they're saying guys we're praying for you you're going to make it but just make sure you listen to the voice they will encourage them just listen to the voice that's the key trust the voice and and he realized david gibbs realized that at this point there were so many voices in his head imagine yourself in his position all these voices trying to be the controlling voice one voice you should have known better get on that plane another voice you're never gonna see your family again another voice you're gonna die of horrible death you're going to crash you're never going to see your loved ones again you're never going to put your arms around your wife you're never going to hug your your kids all these voices trying to be the controlling voice but god says i want you to be a living sacrifice and i want you to put yourself on the altar and let my voice be your voice that's what god is looking for somebody that can lay their life down and allow him to speak through them him to use them so they went through the worst of the weather and they were but there was still a bit more to come and they in the the anchorage alaska came back on he says now i'm going to line you up and i'm going to bring you right down the runway he says now at the foot of the runway there are some lights and they're in the form of a cross he said now remember don't forget this the cross is the way home so maybe you're groping in darkness out there somewhere just remember the cross is always the way home and he kept saying just stay with me even when you can't see god stay with me even when you don't hear god stay with me the bible says that his sheep hear the voice and they only hear his voice and they were just a couple hundred feet from the ground and they saw they finally saw the cross and the attorney said he landed the plane or david gibbs landed the plane he said in fact i landed that plane seven times he said when that plane finally come to a stop the pilot woke up he didn't miss all the action he said the pilot finally woke up but he said the voice said thanks for listening to the voice he goes i watch them crash and burn all the time because they don't follow my voice they don't understand that i'm the one that can see them they can't see me but they get in their head all these voices and they kill themselves they self-destruct he said thanks for listening to my voice so they took david gibbs and they took the other tourney took him back to a hotel room so they could get some rest i'm sure it was a very trying ordeal and about four o'clock in the morning come a knock on the door and he went to the door and he answered it and the voice and he says hello david and he said you're the voice you're the one that got me home church there's going to be a day that we stand before him and we're going to be able to say you're the voice you're the voice that got me home when i didn't know how to get there i didn't know how to fly the plane i didn't know how my life was going but you're the voice that got me home and he says yes one day we're going to stand before that voice but we find that there's so many voices in our head and we wonder why we wonder why our kids crash and burn i wonder why our marriages become shattered wonder why people commit suicide wonder why people are so depressed and full of anxieties because they're listening to their own voice they're paying attention to all the chaos that's going on and they're not listening they're not staying with the voice doesn't the bible tell us that i'm the way the truth and the life he's still the same way he is still that truth he is still the life see stay with me don't listen to all the other voices don't be distracted by what's going on around you don't be distracted about what this group is doing or what that group is doing what's going on in your head the storms because those thoughts come you know you can't keep the thoughts from coming but you can keep the thoughts from roosting right it's like the old farmer took the took the word he took a shotgun and he blew the birds out that's what we ought to do church listen to the voice now as the musicians will make their way back i want you to bow your heads just briefly for a minute so we bring this down to a close i'm a little bit over time but that's okay this evening listen to the voice maybe you're here this evening and you just be honest with yourself that you've been listening to the voice of depression maybe you've been listening to the voice of discouragement voice of complex is telling you you're never going to fit in you don't fit in nowhere nobody no group everyone's against you maybe you've even been listening to the voice of suicide just go ahead and take your life nobody's going to miss you the voice of reasoning and the doubts you don't know you know you question whether this message is real or not or you question is it the truth or not maybe it's a voice of fear and you're nervous all the time no peace no joy everything stripped away from you your home is upside down maybe you listen yielded to the voices of the world and you're doing things that you shouldn't do going to websites that you shouldn't go to but i believe today there's been a voice here i believe there's a voice that is present today that can meet your need and i believe that voice will tell you you don't have to stay bound stay with me you don't have to be bound by depression and anxiety you don't have to struggle with those suicidal thoughts you don't have to have doubts whether this message is truth or not you can have that assurance today he can come he can become a personal god to you this evening he can become a living voice that lives through your life maybe fear has gripped you this evening fear can release its grip off of your life this evening church because i believe the chain breaker is here to liberate you if at you this scene and just slip your hand up to god god sees your hand back there in the back god sees your hands you need a touch of god and you just be honest with yourself and every every eye closing every head bowed just say lord i've been listening to the wrong voice i want to hear that voice tonight god sees your hands you want to say lord forgive me forgive me for for listening to that voice lord i i pray today that i make a vow before you and before god's people that i'll just hear your voice from now on so father we we come before you lord tonight and i know this is service kind of went a little different than maybe what we expected lord we're so thankful though father that you're mindful of us god we're so thankful that we can hear the voice of god for this hour and lord we're not scrupled up we're not confused we're not worried about all that what to believe the sign or don't believe the signs are saying lord about the cloud and about the bridge and about all these different aspects lord we know that that voice is the voice that is taking care of us it's your voice father that is bringing us through and lord we're here tonight many times we yielded our lives to hear maybe things of man are we yielded to those things that would get in our heads father and maybe a little bit of depression and complex and anxiety and those things but lord we're asking that you'd forgive us for that and we want to just hear your voice tonight we pray father that you just release unto us your spirit give us ears that can hear father give us hearts that we receive lord give us the mind of god tonight father to stay true and faithful to your word lord i just pray for the believers that are here lord those that are on the phone hook up those that are streaming lord may you just speak expressly father surely lord you laid this on upon my heart for a purpose there's a need in the body and i believe you don't make mistakes lord i believe you know how to meet that need we just asked lord tonight that you would meet the needs of your people god in your own personal way and i believe if you was here god standing behind this desk you'd be saying the same things hear my voice stay with me listen only to my voice don't be distracted by what's going on around you so father we just commit this service to you tonight commit the church to you the believers here tonight those that are simple god may you bless them bless their homes lord bless the young people father that they will give their ears to you lord pull so many directions lord so many enticements in this hour but yet god you said you're going to have a bride and she's going to be made up of young people middle-aged people and old people father so we just want to yield ourselves to you vessels of instruments of righteousness tonight have your way now lord we pray in jesus name amen [Music] oh i'm learning i'm
