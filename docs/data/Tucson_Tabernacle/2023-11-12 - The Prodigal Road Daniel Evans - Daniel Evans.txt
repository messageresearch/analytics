[44:26] that brother Jordan was singing and
[44:31] uh I'm going to get carried away when I
[44:33] get carried away I thought what what
[44:34] kind of a a strange person would say
[44:37] something like that well it's somebody
[44:39] that it's talking about when we die and
[44:42] Hallelujah by and by we're going to fly
[44:44] away and it's a Christian that looks
[44:47] forward to that day what an odd thing
[44:50] for the world to think everybody's
[44:52] dreading going Beyond this this time and
[44:55] this world but we're looking forward to
[44:57] it that's a Christian walk right
[45:01] there I appreciate the prayer request
[45:04] and and brother Jordan said
[45:06] something
[45:08] that I thought you know that that's
[45:10] right he said each prayer request is
[45:15] important to the
[45:16] Lord and that's the truth every time
[45:20] that we bring something before the Lord
[45:23] it's important to him as brother Jordan
[45:25] said no matter how small how big
[45:28] whatever it is it could be a wayward
[45:29] child or it could be just Lord help me
[45:32] to get through today I'm not feeling
[45:34] good whatever it is it's important to
[45:37] him because he loves us I appreciate he
[45:41] mentioned uh we went through we had our
[45:43] meeting last night with
[45:45] trustees uh mentioned that Stephanie and
[45:47] I are taken off um we're going on a on a
[45:52] trip she's not here so I can talk about
[45:54] her she's up in Sunday school still but
[45:57] uh yeah we uh 25 years ago we got
[46:00] married and uh we went to the island of
[46:03] kaai in our honeymoon and we're going to
[46:05] go back at the Lord's will in tomorrow
[46:08] looking forward to it um looking forward
[46:10] to getting some rest and really praying
[46:12] about some things that that we have in
[46:14] our heart um I think especially
[46:17] Stephanie needs it I I just you know
[46:19] friends I I just appreciate appreciate
[46:22] the Lord so much I appreciate the
[46:23] message that he's given us
[46:26] I've been thinking lately this isn't one
[46:28] I'm going to be ministering on today but
[46:30] I've been thinking
[46:31] lately about about the message and about
[46:35] how to bring the word across to the
[46:38] people and it's the desire of my heart
[46:42] is I want to
[46:43] introduce everyone that I can to a
[46:46] living Jesus Christ that is the purpose
[46:50] that's everything and sometimes we get
[46:52] sidetracked and we we preach about our
[46:55] own Ministry minies or we preach about
[46:57] something that
[47:00] that is supposed to take us to Christ
[47:04] and then we just leave it right at at
[47:06] the very foundation and we need to make
[47:09] sure that we're moving on in the Lord
[47:11] Jesus I appreciate if you know me
[47:16] personally which I think everybody does
[47:18] you know I appreciate brother brandom's
[47:20] message so much the reason the main
[47:23] reason I appreciate it main reason I
[47:26] listen to it every day the main reason I
[47:28] just covet the things that he said is
[47:30] because his message even though I never
[47:34] knew him he died well before I was born
[47:38] but his message introduced me to a
[47:43] living Jesus Christ that is the purpose
[47:46] I could not pay him a greater compliment
[47:48] than to say one day I will meet him and
[47:50] I'll say brother brandom your message
[47:53] inspired me to serve Jesus Jesus Christ
[47:56] and it inspired me to lay hands on the
[47:59] sick and know that that Jesus is there
[48:03] he's the same yesterday today and
[48:04] forever and he can heal the sick and
[48:07] that's what it that's what it means so
[48:09] much to me and it's not trying
[48:12] to place him in the different scriptures
[48:15] and and all that that's good but the
[48:18] main thing is that we find Christ in the
[48:22] message because it's everything no one
[48:25] else that has ever
[48:27] lived can do anything Christ is
[48:32] everything and if we can point people to
[48:35] a living Christ Christ in every sermon
[48:40] Christ in every service Christ every day
[48:43] on my lips talking about Jesus all the
[48:45] time this is what he did for me that's
[48:49] why I can say when I die Hallelujah by
[48:53] and by I will fly away that's why I can
[48:56] say what brother Jordan said I'm going
[48:58] to get carried away when I get carried
[49:00] away is because of the man that died on
[49:04] that cross he means
[49:07] everything
[49:09] everything any
[49:12] Minister preach about Jesus because you
[49:17] can't find Salvation in any other in any
[49:21] denomination in any system in anything
[49:23] else there is no salvation in any other
[49:26] but our Lord Jesus
[49:29] Christ I um this morning I want to talk
[49:32] about this
[49:33] Parable in Luke chapter
[49:36] 15
[49:38] and it's um it talks about Jesus tell
[49:43] tells three
[49:44] stories and the first story he tells is
[49:48] he
[49:49] tells he's talking to a group of
[49:53] Pharisees and these Pharisees see Jesus
[49:56] there and we know the Pharisees and we
[49:58] know the attitude that the Pharisees had
[50:00] towards him and they say they see Jesus
[50:03] there and Jesus W is with is surrounding
[50:06] himself with
[50:09] Sinners I was talking with somebody I
[50:11] can't remember who it was
[50:14] yesterday and somebody told me that
[50:16] somebody was wanting to come to church
[50:18] but this person had to get a few things
[50:20] right before he comes to church and I
[50:23] said no that's not true that's why you
[50:26] come to church is to get those things
[50:28] right you don't have to get them right
[50:29] before you come just come just get in
[50:32] this place just come in here and then
[50:34] the Lord will work it out you don't have
[50:36] to get right before you come here that's
[50:38] the whole purpose of church is to get in
[50:41] and to get closer with the Lord and to
[50:43] get these things right and Jesus is
[50:46] talking to he's telling the story to
[50:48] these Pharisees and these Pharisees are
[50:50] seeing that he's surrounding himself
[50:52] with
[50:53] Sinners bad people people prostitutes
[50:56] and tax collectors and and Jesus is
[50:58] surrounding himself with them and
[51:00] they're pointing their finger at him
[51:01] look at look at who he's with Jesus
[51:04] turns to these Pharisees and he says he
[51:06] says listen he says there was a
[51:09] Shepherd this man had a hundred
[51:12] sheep and he said one of those sheep got
[51:17] lost and he said this man he goes out
[51:20] and he's looking for his sheep and he
[51:22] wasn't even thinking about the 99 he was
[51:26] thinking about this one sheep that had
[51:27] gone he looked everywhere for it and he
[51:30] finally found the sheep and he took the
[51:31] sheep and he put it up on his shoulders
[51:34] he was so thankful he was so happy and
[51:37] he brings this sheep in and he tells his
[51:39] friends let me read Luke 15:
[51:47] 7 when he brings that sheep
[51:51] back he says
[51:54] this
[51:55] Jesus is talking he says I I say unto
[51:58] you likewise Joy shall be in heaven over
[52:02] one
[52:04] sinner Joy shall be in heaven over one
[52:07] sinner that repenteth more than over the
[52:10] 99 just persons which need no
[52:15] repentance what a what a statement and
[52:17] there's those Pharisees looking and he's
[52:19] he's saying listen it's important that
[52:22] these people come to the
[52:24] Lord and then tells him another story a
[52:27] second story is about a woman
[52:30] that she was she was going to be married
[52:33] and she and she lost a coin she had 10
[52:36] coins and she lost a coin and these 10
[52:38] coins were going to be in a hairpiece
[52:40] that she would wear as a married
[52:42] woman and she had lost one of those
[52:46] coins and she was looking everywhere and
[52:48] she cleaned her house and she was trying
[52:50] to find these coins everywhere and
[52:53] finally she found the coin coin that was
[52:56] missing and she rejoiced and she told
[52:59] all of her friends that that I found my
[53:01] coin that was lost and she wasn't even
[53:04] thinking about these other nine coins
[53:06] they were there they were safe where
[53:08] they should have been but it was the one
[53:10] coin that was
[53:12] lost these two Parables Jesus was laying
[53:16] the
[53:17] foundation for the third
[53:20] Parable and you have to remember again
[53:23] Jesus's audience I'll read Luke 15:1 it
[53:26] says here as I said before then Drew
[53:29] near unto him all the publicans and
[53:31] sinners for to hear him and Jesus and
[53:34] the Pharisees and the scribes murmured
[53:36] saying this man receiveth Sinners and
[53:39] eateth with
[53:41] them now this third
[53:44] story that Jesus tells after he tells
[53:48] about the sheep and after he tells about
[53:49] the coins is about this young
[53:53] man this young man was
[53:56] probably raised we know he was raised in
[53:58] a good
[54:00] home good
[54:02] parents Abraham
[54:04] Lincoln one time said he said that the
[54:06] strength of a country lies in the homes
[54:09] of her
[54:11] people and the
[54:14] strength of this
[54:16] America is in the home is what Abraham
[54:19] Lincoln
[54:20] said and if the home continues the way
[54:23] it's going friends if it continues and
[54:25] the separation of the nuclear family
[54:28] continues to go the way it's going the
[54:30] family doesn't eat dinner together where
[54:33] the word of the Lord is talked about by
[54:35] Mom and Dad the family devotions where
[54:37] we get our families together and we talk
[54:39] about the Lord Jesus and we talk about
[54:41] his word and we read our Bibles where
[54:43] dad reads the Bible to the family and
[54:46] where where they pray together and Mom
[54:48] and Dad pray with the kids when we see
[54:51] those times
[54:54] go and they are going they're almost
[54:57] gone this country is going to be
[55:00] defeated once again it's going to be
[55:02] defeated like Rome was defeated like
[55:04] Greece like Babylon and like Israel Was
[55:07] Defeated so many times it's going to be
[55:09] defeated not by military might but it's
[55:12] going to be defeated by
[55:14] sin that's what's prophesied to be in
[55:17] this last
[55:19] day this country will fall as I said it
[55:23] won't fall because of mil military might
[55:26] that may be the ultimate conclusion but
[55:28] it will fall because of the sin that is
[55:31] in the people and it starts right in
[55:35] this nuclear family and we see it spread
[55:40] we see it spread with a legalizing of
[55:42] drugs towards a censoring of
[55:45] Christianity calling it hate speech
[55:48] towards the promotion of
[55:52] homosexuality which has come because of
[55:54] the the degradation of the morals that
[55:58] are in this
[56:00] country
[56:02] see even the sanctity of marriage is not
[56:08] respected if you look in in the in this
[56:10] book this
[56:13] Bible there's
[56:16] idolatry and there's the sanctity of
[56:18] marriage and those two things are seems
[56:21] to be what has failed throughout history
[56:25] and it's not taught anymore to our
[56:27] children it's not taught that when you
[56:31] are thinking about marrying someone this
[56:35] is a forever thing you are making a vow
[56:38] between between this person and God and
[56:42] you cannot go back it should be taken so
[56:46] carefully this Bond of marriage it
[56:49] shouldn't be entered into
[56:51] haphazardly it's a very very serious
[56:53] thing and it's not taught in our homes
[56:55] anymore it's not taught in our churches
[56:58] anymore it's like oh if you don't like
[57:00] this one you can just go on to the next
[57:02] one and it's something that has
[57:04] contributed to problems that are in the
[57:07] world and it's going to continue to
[57:11] degrade and here we
[57:13] have this young man he was brought up in
[57:16] this in this good
[57:19] family but there was something pulling
[57:22] on this young man
[57:26] outside of the
[57:29] Lord and what it was we see so often
[57:33] that we see and all of us see it we see
[57:35] people fail we see people fall into sin
[57:38] and what the enemy does is there is a
[57:41] pull on each of us and the enemy makes
[57:45] us think that that pull is sin and it's
[57:49] not it's God that's pulling on us it's
[57:52] God that's trying to bring us to him and
[57:55] instead Satan gets in there and he
[57:57] throws in partying he throws in sin
[58:03] sleeping around he throws in these
[58:06] things and and he makes us think that
[58:10] this is what is going to fulfill that
[58:13] desire and it always ends up in sadness
[58:18] for the
[58:20] people there's never anything
[58:22] there this young man about to's story
[58:26] what he did is he put himself
[58:31] first and it's it's one of the saddest
[58:34] stories in the
[58:35] Bible has a n has a good ending but it's
[58:38] a tremendous lesson I pray that I can do
[58:42] it
[58:43] justice what this man did this young man
[58:47] is he took what I'm calling the title of
[58:50] my sermon today he took the prodigal
[58:53] Road
[58:55] rather than taking the road that God and
[58:58] his family had set before him let's turn
[59:01] to chapter 15 of the Book of Luke and
[59:04] start with verse 11 and I'll read the
[59:06] whole
[59:09] story I believe this is the Lord's will
[59:13] I just feel it right now I believe it's
[59:15] the Lord's will to bring this message
[59:17] right
[59:18] now and he
[59:20] said a certain man had two sons and the
[59:24] Young of them said to his father father
[59:26] give me the portion of the goods that
[59:28] falleth to me and he divided unto them
[59:31] his living so he asked for his
[59:33] inheritance and his father gave him his
[59:36] inheritance
[59:37] early and not many days after the young
[59:40] son gathered all together and took his
[59:42] journey into a far country and there
[59:45] wasted his substance with riotous
[59:50] living and when he had spent all there
[59:55] arose a mighty famine in the land and he
[59:58] began to be in
[1:00:00] want and he went and joined himself to a
[1:00:03] citizen of that country and he sent him
[1:00:06] into his fields to feed
[1:00:08] swine and he would Fain have filled his
[1:00:11] belly with with the husks that the swine
[1:00:14] did eat and no man gave unto him and
[1:00:17] when he came to himself he said how many
[1:00:20] hired Servants of my fathers have bread
[1:00:22] enough to spare and I perish with
[1:00:26] Hunger I will arise and go to my father
[1:00:30] and I will say to him father I have
[1:00:32] sinned against heaven and before
[1:00:35] thee and am no more worthy to begal thy
[1:00:38] son make me as one of thy hired servants
[1:00:42] and he rose and came to his father but
[1:00:45] he when he was yet a great way off his
[1:00:48] father saw him and had compassion and
[1:00:51] ran and fell on his neck and kissed him
[1:00:55] and the son said unto himf father I have
[1:00:57] sinned against heaven and in thy sight
[1:01:00] and am no more worthy to be called thy
[1:01:02] son but the father said to his servants
[1:01:04] bring forth the best robe and put it on
[1:01:06] him and put a ring on his hand and shoes
[1:01:08] on his feet and bring hither the fatted
[1:01:10] calf and kill it and let us eat and be
[1:01:13] merry for this my son was
[1:01:19] dead and is alive
[1:01:22] again he was lost
[1:01:25] lost Amazing
[1:01:28] Grace and is
[1:01:30] found and they began to be
[1:01:32] mared now his Elder son was in the field
[1:01:36] and as he came and Drew nigh to the
[1:01:38] house he heard music and dancing and he
[1:01:41] called one of the servants and asked
[1:01:42] what these things meant and he said unto
[1:01:45] him thy brother is come and thy father
[1:01:48] had killed the fatted calf because he
[1:01:51] that received him safe and sound because
[1:01:53] he hath received him safe safe and sound
[1:01:55] and he was angry and would not go in
[1:01:57] therefore came his father out and
[1:01:59] intreated him and he answered and said
[1:02:01] to his father Lo these many years do I
[1:02:05] serve thee neither transgressed I at any
[1:02:08] time thy commandment and yet thou never
[1:02:11] gavest me a
[1:02:13] kid which is a
[1:02:16] goat that I might make Merry with my
[1:02:21] friends but as soon as this thy son was
[1:02:24] come which thou deved devoured which
[1:02:27] hath devoured thy living with
[1:02:31] harlots thou Hast killed for him a
[1:02:34] fatted calf he didn't give me a goat but
[1:02:37] you give him the fatted
[1:02:39] calf and he said unto him son thou art
[1:02:43] ever with me and all that I have is
[1:02:47] thine it was meat that we should make
[1:02:50] Merry and be glad for this thy brother
[1:02:53] was dead and and is alive again and was
[1:02:56] lost and is found what a
[1:03:00] story we look at this young man that
[1:03:02] went out he wasn't
[1:03:05] satisfied with his home life he wanted
[1:03:09] to experience the
[1:03:12] world friends so often we're not
[1:03:15] satisfied with what we've been given and
[1:03:18] we see something over here we we want
[1:03:22] something over there and it just it we
[1:03:25] lose track of what's important and then
[1:03:28] we go and we take off like this young
[1:03:31] man did and then we ruin our lives in
[1:03:34] doing
[1:03:36] so they're searching for something as I
[1:03:39] said earlier all of us are searching for
[1:03:42] something they're searching for
[1:03:45] something and and they feel this pull
[1:03:48] and they find it in drugs they find it
[1:03:50] in drinking they find it in sex they
[1:03:53] find it in pornography
[1:03:54] they find it in money they find it in
[1:03:56] power they find it in
[1:03:58] success in popularity and they are
[1:04:00] searching for something as I said there
[1:04:03] is a deep calling to the deep that Holy
[1:04:09] Spirit God is calling out to all of us
[1:04:13] and he is trying to pull us to him but
[1:04:15] we live in such a sinful world that
[1:04:18] Satan will get in there and he's far
[1:04:20] more able than any of us to we we we
[1:04:24] have the hardest time identifying
[1:04:27] this but Satan will come in and we will
[1:04:31] for I'm not satisfied I need something
[1:04:34] and he will put before us drugs or he'll
[1:04:38] put before us gossip fighting he'll put
[1:04:42] before us a a a young man or a young
[1:04:46] lady that will pull us away from the
[1:04:49] truth that will drive us into sin and we
[1:04:53] think that we are enjoy going and we
[1:04:54] think that this is where we want to be
[1:04:56] but you'll see that there's just sadness
[1:04:58] that keeps following and following and
[1:05:01] following there's never
[1:05:03] happiness but how can this be over here
[1:05:09] and then over here we can sing a song
[1:05:12] like I can't wait until I get out of
[1:05:15] this body I can't wait till I pass from
[1:05:19] this world how can someone say that and
[1:05:23] just that happiness flows from us and
[1:05:26] there's always hope no matter what bad
[1:05:29] thing happens we can always turn to the
[1:05:32] Lord and say Lord you're still there
[1:05:34] you're still hearing me yes sir we can
[1:05:37] always turn to him but Satan wants us to
[1:05:39] turn over here and he says okay well
[1:05:41] you're not happy now you need more drugs
[1:05:43] you need more
[1:05:45] medication you need more of this you
[1:05:47] need more of that you need more women
[1:05:48] you need more men you need more internet
[1:05:51] you need more all of this you need a
[1:05:52] different job and we we
[1:05:54] don't see that it's actually God pulling
[1:05:56] us and Satan trying to confuse us and
[1:06:00] that's what happened to this young
[1:06:03] man he's going out and he's as the as
[1:06:07] it's said he's with
[1:06:10] prostitutes but I look how did the young
[1:06:13] man how did the brother know that his
[1:06:16] other brother was sleeping around and
[1:06:18] drinking and partying it must have come
[1:06:21] back to the dad it must have come back
[1:06:23] to the family that your brother is out
[1:06:25] doing this
[1:06:27] squandering everything that you have and
[1:06:29] he's he's living the high life and time
[1:06:36] passed and what the young man that one
[1:06:41] off probably didn't
[1:06:43] know is he had a father at
[1:06:47] home and here is this here is this
[1:06:50] father and he gives his son his
[1:06:53] inheritance
[1:06:54] and he watches
[1:06:56] him walk away from his family he watches
[1:07:01] him walk away from their
[1:07:04] life his dad loved this young man and
[1:07:08] what this man what this young man did as
[1:07:11] he was out living in the world and he
[1:07:12] was doing all these things what he
[1:07:14] didn't know was there was a dad on his
[1:07:16] knees praying for
[1:07:20] him and maybe every
[1:07:22] evening maybe this Dad would come out
[1:07:25] and he look down the road and he'd see
[1:07:28] the sun going down the same road that he
[1:07:30] walked
[1:07:32] away maybe he'd look down that road and
[1:07:35] say maybe he's going to come back
[1:07:39] hearing all these things but the prayers
[1:07:42] of the father were always there and they
[1:07:46] went up before the Throne of the
[1:07:48] almighty God and God heard the prayers
[1:07:51] of this
[1:07:52] father this boy was lost but he was not
[1:07:56] lost
[1:07:58] forever and there he
[1:08:01] is out and spending money and living
[1:08:05] this life and he says he goes out and he
[1:08:08] makes the mistake that so many of all of
[1:08:10] us make and I don't care how old you are
[1:08:12] we all make this mistake we say I have
[1:08:15] to do what makes me happy I have to do
[1:08:19] what's best for me and when we start
[1:08:21] going down that road when we have that
[1:08:23] attitude there is destruction
[1:08:26] waiting and that's what this young man
[1:08:29] did and he had a
[1:08:31] brother that was there that was
[1:08:34] continuing doing his job and continuing
[1:08:37] doing the right thing and staying with
[1:08:39] his dad but this other brother was out
[1:08:41] and he was among the world and he was
[1:08:44] doing every little thing not a care in
[1:08:48] the
[1:08:49] world and then the money ran
[1:08:52] out
[1:08:57] his
[1:08:58] friends started to leave him to me it
[1:09:02] just shows that he was a child of God
[1:09:05] his friends started to leave
[1:09:07] him there was no money even to eat and
[1:09:09] there was a famine in the land he didn't
[1:09:11] have anything so he goes to a man that
[1:09:14] he knew before and the man gives him a
[1:09:16] job to feed the
[1:09:18] pigs and he was looking at the food that
[1:09:21] was going to feed these pigs and he was
[1:09:23] in the pig slop and his he was now in
[1:09:25] rags and what was just a little while
[1:09:27] earlier were the nicest clothes that he
[1:09:29] could have had had the nicest
[1:09:33] cars living the high life doing really
[1:09:35] good without
[1:09:38] God because he was a child of
[1:09:41] God God let him fall as low as he could
[1:09:45] be and there he is with these pigs and
[1:09:48] he's looking at the food that is going
[1:09:50] to go to the pigs and he says I'm going
[1:09:52] to eat this this is will sustain
[1:09:55] me and then the Bible says he came to
[1:10:00] himself
[1:10:01] beautiful thing let me read to you
[1:10:05] something brother brandham said about
[1:10:08] this young
[1:10:12] man what he
[1:10:14] did was he
[1:10:17] remembered the nature of his
[1:10:21] father he grown up with his dad he knew
[1:10:24] his dad and he remembered the nature of
[1:10:28] his
[1:10:29] dad brother Braham said this but he know
[1:10:32] the nature of his
[1:10:34] father and he said I will arise and go
[1:10:38] to my father the father never said when
[1:10:40] he got back the father never said wait a
[1:10:42] minute son are you bringing my money
[1:10:44] back no he never charged him for his
[1:10:47] sins he was glad that he was coming back
[1:10:51] and he was glad that he had come to
[1:10:52] himself because he was his
[1:10:55] son he was his own
[1:10:57] child he was glad when he was on his
[1:11:00] road home now he didn't endorse his
[1:11:04] sin but he was glad when he came to
[1:11:06] himself and said I have sinned before my
[1:11:09] God and before my father I will rise and
[1:11:12] go to
[1:11:13] him and when he saw him AAR off he ran
[1:11:16] to him and kissed him and he said kill
[1:11:18] the fatted calf without money bring the
[1:11:21] best robe without money bring the ring
[1:11:23] without money and put his put it on his
[1:11:26] finger let us let us eat and drink and
[1:11:29] be merry for this my son was lost and
[1:11:32] now he was found he was dead and now he
[1:11:35] is alive again let us be happy about
[1:11:38] it brother Bram says this may I close
[1:11:41] with this friends the only thing that
[1:11:43] satisfies the only real thing there is
[1:11:46] the only good things there is cannot be
[1:11:48] bought with money they are free gifts of
[1:11:52] God by Jesus Christ
[1:11:54] salvation of the Soul Joy come and eat
[1:11:57] and be
[1:11:58] satisfied wherefore do you spend your
[1:12:01] money for that which is not bread and
[1:12:04] your labor for that which satisfies not
[1:12:07] hearken Dil hearken diligent unto me and
[1:12:09] eat that which is good and let your soul
[1:12:12] Delight itself in the fatness incline
[1:12:15] your ears and come to me here and your
[1:12:18] soul shall live and I'll make an
[1:12:19] Everlasting Covenant with you even the
[1:12:21] sure mercies of David brother brandom
[1:12:24] quotes the
[1:12:27] scriptures so here is this young man and
[1:12:30] he is in this pig slop and the world had
[1:12:33] forsaken him and Satan will always
[1:12:35] forsake you Satan will take what he
[1:12:38] wants from you and then he is finished
[1:12:41] with you and his ultimate goal is your
[1:12:45] destruction his crowning Glory Satan's
[1:12:48] crowning Glory was the son of
[1:12:50] Destruction the son of predition this
[1:12:52] man named Judas is
[1:12:55] carot remember I told the story a couple
[1:12:57] weeks ago I had Daniel stand up here I
[1:12:59] told the story that brother brandham
[1:13:01] told about he had he had brother Billy
[1:13:04] Paul put his hands out and he said
[1:13:07] here's the Lord and he said as far as
[1:13:10] you go away from the Lord the that far
[1:13:14] is how you're going how long you're
[1:13:16] going to have to travel
[1:13:18] back so as far as we go we're still
[1:13:21] going to have to come back that road and
[1:13:23] here's this this young man and he's out
[1:13:27] there and he's got to come back this
[1:13:30] road of
[1:13:32] predition and here's Judas is carat and
[1:13:36] he went too
[1:13:39] far and he was never able to get back
[1:13:42] even though he tried this man Judas he
[1:13:45] he went too
[1:13:47] far and here is this
[1:13:50] man in this pig pin it's it's going to
[1:13:53] end up the same place as that and he's
[1:13:57] there and he's remembering
[1:13:59] dad I remember his
[1:14:02] nature if I can just come back and he
[1:14:04] starts getting this speech together
[1:14:06] here's what I'm GNA tell
[1:14:08] him and he's
[1:14:10] thinking I'm going to tell him that I'm
[1:14:12] not worthy to be your son but if I could
[1:14:14] just be a servant in your house if I
[1:14:16] could just make a living now I see how
[1:14:19] bad this world is now I see how terrible
[1:14:22] everything is I see is just for my own
[1:14:24] destruction if I could just work in your
[1:14:26] house I don't even have to be your son
[1:14:28] just let me get
[1:14:30] back so he gets up out of the slop he's
[1:14:33] hungry and he starts on this road the
[1:14:36] same road that he came down he starts
[1:14:41] back how many times was that father on
[1:14:44] his knees looking down that road that
[1:14:46] that son had left praying for his son
[1:14:50] please return
[1:14:52] him goes
[1:14:54] out his
[1:14:58] father who knows it may have been years
[1:15:00] probably was years later and he's
[1:15:03] looking down that
[1:15:07] road looks down there and he sees a
[1:15:10] figure
[1:15:12] walking he
[1:15:16] looks dressed in
[1:15:18] rags who is that walking down this
[1:15:22] road walks like my son doesn't look like
[1:15:25] my son he's walking like my
[1:15:29] son Closer
[1:15:32] Closer could that
[1:15:35] be my prodigal son that had left that
[1:15:38] had gone The Prodigal
[1:15:40] Road could God have answered my
[1:15:45] prayers gets
[1:15:47] closer the heath that is his
[1:15:50] son and he goes running out and he grabs
[1:15:53] his son and he hugs him and his son had
[1:15:55] rehearsed the speech and he and he
[1:15:57] starts the speech and he's like forget
[1:16:00] it forget it you are my son sir there's
[1:16:06] nothing that could have changed that he
[1:16:08] was a
[1:16:09] son no matter how far that he went no
[1:16:12] matter how much into sin that he went
[1:16:14] there was nothing that could change that
[1:16:16] he was a
[1:16:18] son he takes him and he kills a fatted
[1:16:21] calf and he takes a ring
[1:16:23] drop my ring he takes he takes a
[1:16:27] ring and he puts it
[1:16:30] on his son's finger which means this is
[1:16:37] my son he has every
[1:16:40] right that my other son
[1:16:44] has and there is nothing we can do there
[1:16:47] is nothing that can separate us from the
[1:16:50] love of God no matter how far down the
[1:16:52] road we go there is nothing that can
[1:16:55] separate us we have that ring we are a
[1:16:58] son or a daughter of God and no matter
[1:17:01] how bad that you get no matter what
[1:17:03] you've done there is always a way
[1:17:08] back but it might be a long way back I'm
[1:17:12] a Son of God brother Aon I am a son of
[1:17:16] this
[1:17:18] Lord no matter what I've done he loves
[1:17:22] me I know remember he knew his dad's
[1:17:27] nature I know my father's
[1:17:31] nature so he comes back
[1:17:34] and wonderful the father remember the 99
[1:17:38] sheep and the one and he the shepherd
[1:17:40] just rejoiced here is this father my son
[1:17:43] was dead and now he's back praise God he
[1:17:47] was everything was so happy but he had
[1:17:50] another
[1:17:52] son this other son's looking and he's
[1:17:54] like what's going
[1:17:56] on what's Happening
[1:17:59] Here the servant comes out and he says
[1:18:02] your brother is
[1:18:04] home and you know what your dad
[1:18:07] did he gave him a ring just like your
[1:18:11] ring he killed a fatted calf there's a
[1:18:15] big celebration going on he's coming in
[1:18:18] and it offended this man remember Jesus
[1:18:21] as Jesus was
[1:18:23] so
[1:18:25] awesome is you know the red part it's
[1:18:29] Jesus talking 2,000 years ago he told
[1:18:32] the same story I'm telling right now
[1:18:34] isn't that beautiful I just I just love
[1:18:37] thinking about it so there is Jesus and
[1:18:40] Jesus has all these Pharisees and you
[1:18:43] think maybe they were thinking that
[1:18:45] Jesus is comparing them to this other
[1:18:48] son and he's like
[1:18:51] listen it is a a joy that this brother
[1:18:55] is coming home and the son says listen
[1:18:58] I've been here I have served God I have
[1:19:01] done all of this father I've been with
[1:19:04] you I've been your loyal
[1:19:06] son how come he gets a
[1:19:10] party and I'm just working out in the
[1:19:13] field his dad says he says son
[1:19:16] listen he says you are my son you've
[1:19:20] been with me everything that I have is
[1:19:21] yours
[1:19:24] he
[1:19:24] said but I'm just
[1:19:28] rejoicing that your brother who was once
[1:19:31] lost is come back and this young man he
[1:19:35] should have also been
[1:19:37] rejoicing when we see people come back
[1:19:40] it's not looking down at them and saying
[1:19:43] look at how wrong they are there should
[1:19:45] be a great Rejoice saying they are
[1:19:48] coming
[1:19:49] back if it's going on in heaven
[1:19:53] and it is I read it why is it not going
[1:19:56] on
[1:19:57] here when we see one come back no matter
[1:20:00] what they looked like he was filth
[1:20:03] smelled like a pig he was as bad as you
[1:20:05] can
[1:20:07] be and you know what he had that that
[1:20:11] this other young man didn't have by the
[1:20:13] grace of God I look at these two young
[1:20:17] men and which one would I rather
[1:20:21] be I of of course would rather be the
[1:20:24] one that stayed with the
[1:20:26] father of course I'd want to be
[1:20:30] him but he looked and he saw his brother
[1:20:32] and he saw all the sin that surrounded
[1:20:34] his brother and these Pharisees look and
[1:20:36] they they had Jesus there and they saw
[1:20:37] all the sin that was surrounding
[1:20:41] him and the father could have looked at
[1:20:43] the son and said Son
[1:20:46] listen you don't have the scars that he
[1:20:50] has you don't have these bad experience
[1:20:52] experiences that he
[1:20:54] has put it in modern day you don't have
[1:20:56] the bad credit that he has you don't
[1:20:59] have the the track marks or you don't
[1:21:02] have the the the bad reputation you
[1:21:06] don't have any of that he has that and
[1:21:08] he will have to live with that forever
[1:21:10] but he is still my
[1:21:13] son I still love him he is as much my
[1:21:15] son as you
[1:21:17] are but because you have lived a good
[1:21:21] life because you have served me your
[1:21:25] life is
[1:21:26] better and it will probably always be
[1:21:30] better you've made it easier on yourself
[1:21:34] son he has made it hard on
[1:21:40] himself I
[1:21:43] think son comes and the father Embraces
[1:21:47] him and and this happens with the other
[1:21:51] son
[1:21:53] and we
[1:21:55] see the two
[1:21:58] failures in the Suns and all of us are
[1:22:00] are we're all failures let me just put
[1:22:02] it that way all of us are we see the two
[1:22:05] failures we see the one son that went
[1:22:08] into the
[1:22:09] world and he failed and we see the other
[1:22:14] son that stayed
[1:22:16] pure but he
[1:22:19] failed he failed in the
[1:22:21] self-righteousness the the other one
[1:22:23] failed in the
[1:22:25] Sin both
[1:22:29] failed I I think
[1:22:32] that all of us friends all of us have
[1:22:35] sinned against God and all of us have
[1:22:38] asked for forgiveness many
[1:22:41] times but let me tell you
[1:22:43] something our names were written we've
[1:22:47] we've gone many times before the Lord
[1:22:49] and said Lord forgive me but my name and
[1:22:52] your name one time was written in the
[1:22:54] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:22:55] foundation of the world and it's still
[1:22:58] there no matter what I've done no matter
[1:23:01] what mistakes I've made it's
[1:23:07] there problem that the Lord Jesus was
[1:23:10] getting
[1:23:11] to was
[1:23:13] that if the Pharisees would have just
[1:23:17] listened
[1:23:19] Brothers Listen these people
[1:23:23] Heaven's rejoicing I'm rejoicing that
[1:23:25] they're coming back you haven't suffered
[1:23:27] what they've
[1:23:29] suffered you
[1:23:31] haven't so give glory to God that you
[1:23:35] haven't had to go through what they go
[1:23:37] through what they've gone
[1:23:38] through look at the this prodigal son
[1:23:41] and I
[1:23:43] think look at the nature of a human
[1:23:47] being the um few years ago we had this
[1:23:52] Co
[1:23:53] I just had it again a couple weeks ago
[1:23:56] um still with us
[1:23:59] um what happened was the government said
[1:24:02] stay
[1:24:03] home don't go to work and we will pay
[1:24:07] you just to stay
[1:24:10] home exactly what happened with this
[1:24:13] prodigal son he said give me my
[1:24:16] money and I'm going to go out and do my
[1:24:20] thing and here is all of these United
[1:24:22] States
[1:24:22] and they're staying home the government
[1:24:25] is giving them money and look what
[1:24:29] happened homelessness
[1:24:32] exploded why because they took the
[1:24:35] money and they did exactly what this
[1:24:38] prodigal son did they spent it on drugs
[1:24:41] they spent it on rry they spent it on
[1:24:45] things that they shouldn't have spent it
[1:24:47] on they squandered it and now look at
[1:24:50] what's happened I don't think we'll ever
[1:24:51] come back
[1:24:53] from what happened a couple years
[1:24:55] ago look at all the homelessness around
[1:24:58] five years ago it wasn't nearly this
[1:25:01] bad 20 years
[1:25:03] ago it it wasn't even close but now it's
[1:25:07] everywhere and it's because they gave
[1:25:09] the people the money and they went out
[1:25:11] and did what was their nature which was
[1:25:13] squander
[1:25:14] it that's exactly what happened with
[1:25:17] this prodigal son and then they get too
[1:25:20] far I had a friend
[1:25:23] um I used to work with uh years
[1:25:27] ago and he got cancer he he was an older
[1:25:30] guy and he um he trained
[1:25:32] me in my job he trained me how to go out
[1:25:35] and collect the data that we were
[1:25:37] collecting where I was working and and
[1:25:40] he got
[1:25:42] cancer
[1:25:44] and I would his name is Ken I I I
[1:25:48] witnessed to him and and I went over to
[1:25:50] his house one night and he had the chemo
[1:25:53] bag on him and and
[1:25:55] uh I said Ken I said you know the Lord
[1:25:59] Jesus can heal
[1:26:01] you I said he can save
[1:26:04] you and he looked at me and he did
[1:26:07] something that so many people do today a
[1:26:10] big mistake he said no he says I don't
[1:26:12] want to be a hypocrite he says I've
[1:26:14] never believed in Jesus before I'm not
[1:26:17] going to start now just because I have
[1:26:21] cancer I said
[1:26:23] Ken I
[1:26:25] said now is the time that you need
[1:26:28] to time is desate desperate and he says
[1:26:31] no he says I'm not going to do
[1:26:34] it I said well can I can I pray for you
[1:26:37] at least he said yeah do whatever you
[1:26:38] wanted prayed for him and he went into
[1:26:42] remission and I kept telling him
[1:26:46] Ken the Lord's given you time you got to
[1:26:49] you got to start serving the lord you
[1:26:50] got to know this Lord Jesus Jesus it's
[1:26:53] simple it's a simple
[1:26:55] story he says I'm not going to start
[1:26:58] now he says I not I'm not going to do it
[1:27:01] because I've never done it before why
[1:27:03] would I be such a hypocrite to start now
[1:27:05] because I'm sick and I see our carnality
[1:27:08] and he
[1:27:11] died and I think oh God I pray before he
[1:27:16] died that he met
[1:27:19] you but it was his choice
[1:27:22] do you understand for all of us it is
[1:27:25] our choice it is my choice do I accept
[1:27:29] Christ or it can't be that easy it is
[1:27:31] that
[1:27:33] easy it is that easy to accept Christ
[1:27:36] but it's not that easy to serve God that
[1:27:41] I will
[1:27:42] admit it is a lot
[1:27:45] easier to serve the
[1:27:48] devil than it is to serve
[1:27:50] God and think
[1:27:53] that the uh
[1:27:56] brother what's his name brother sofman
[1:27:59] um old brother sometimes I I give
[1:28:01] testimonies with him he came in and he
[1:28:04] had he had another joke he has a lot of
[1:28:07] jokes and he came in and he said brother
[1:28:10] Daniel he says I found out that Crime
[1:28:14] Pays everybody said crime doesn't
[1:28:16] pay he says Crime Pays I said brother
[1:28:21] sopan and I'm and okay what's going to
[1:28:24] happen he says look at
[1:28:30] this the wages of sin is
[1:28:35] death so he said it pays and it does pay
[1:28:40] and that is what we get when when we
[1:28:43] don't serve God is we get these wages of
[1:28:48] sin which is death
[1:28:52] I
[1:28:53] think as I said before about this
[1:28:57] man this Dad and
[1:29:01] seeing his son walking down that same
[1:29:05] road that how many times did he look
[1:29:07] down
[1:29:08] there how many times did he go before
[1:29:11] the father and say Lord protect my son
[1:29:16] and he would hear from this far away
[1:29:18] land he would receive news that your son
[1:29:21] is doing this your son is doing that
[1:29:23] your son is in sin your son is running
[1:29:25] with these prostitutes he's doing all of
[1:29:27] this and yet this man continued to
[1:29:33] pray finally God answered his prayer
[1:29:36] amen and here comes the prodigal son
[1:29:40] back and the musicians can come and I'll
[1:29:43] close my point in all of
[1:29:49] this is there was two mistakes
[1:29:53] here there was two
[1:29:55] sons one went the way of
[1:29:59] sin one made the mistake of
[1:30:03] self-righteousness but this
[1:30:06] one that made the mistake of
[1:30:09] self-righteousness he didn't have to
[1:30:12] carry the sins and all the problems and
[1:30:16] all of the burden that this man would
[1:30:19] have to carry his whole life he didn't
[1:30:21] have to carry those
[1:30:23] sins for all of us don't go down that
[1:30:30] road no matter if you're going to come
[1:30:32] back and I believe we will come back but
[1:30:34] if you go down that road you pick up
[1:30:37] scars from the world that are going to
[1:30:39] be with us the rest of our
[1:30:43] lives Mom and
[1:30:44] Dad kids are coming
[1:30:48] back but we got to keep them from making
[1:30:50] the mistakes before they make
[1:30:53] them
[1:30:55] because like this young
[1:30:57] man he's gonna have to
[1:31:00] carry all of these
[1:31:03] problems all of these
[1:31:05] issues and I
[1:31:12] um back to verse 7 says this our lord
[1:31:17] Jesus saying I say unto
[1:31:20] you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven
[1:31:24] over one sinner that
[1:31:27] repenteth more than over the 9 and N
[1:31:31] just
[1:31:32] persons which need no repentance what a
[1:31:36] statement what a
[1:31:38] statement and they're coming
[1:31:41] back as long as our prayers are sincere
[1:31:43] like this father as long as we're
[1:31:46] putting this before the Lord they will
[1:31:49] come
[1:31:50] back
[1:31:53] but the father unlike the
[1:31:56] son and I love this the father saw the
[1:32:00] potential in his prodigal son that had
[1:32:02] come back the father saw that no he's my
[1:32:06] boy he makes mistakes he's done things
[1:32:11] wrong but he's still got
[1:32:15] potential the brother didn't see that in
[1:32:17] his
[1:32:18] brother it's a story it's a it's a
[1:32:23] parable that Jesus told whether it
[1:32:25] really happened we don't know but it's a
[1:32:29] lesson for all of us to
[1:32:33] learn brother Jordan if you could lead
[1:32:36] us in a
[1:32:41] song greater than
[1:32:45] all
[1:32:46] my sin is the blood that still cleans
[1:32:53] es me is the grace that still
[1:32:58] sets
[1:32:59] me
[1:33:02] free to praise
[1:33:07] him I know the
[1:33:10] Bloods
[1:33:12] of life I'm walking in
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:18] newness of
[1:33:20] life I can not fall for it's greater
[1:33:25] than all the blood of the
[1:33:31] Lamb oh greater than
[1:33:35] all
[1:33:38] my is the blood that still
[1:33:43] cleanses me is the grace that still
[1:33:47] sets me
[1:33:50] free
[1:33:52] oh to praise
[1:33:56] him I know the
[1:34:00] blood applied is it applied in your life
[1:34:03] walking in
[1:34:06] new of
[1:34:08] life I cannot fall for it's greater than
[1:34:14] all the the blood of the Lamb friends
[1:34:18] think about think about the father this
[1:34:21] Dad and all of us have a desire in our
[1:34:24] hearts all of us have needs in our
[1:34:27] lives but think about this father and
[1:34:31] how many times he had gone to
[1:34:36] prayer and God was up there on the
[1:34:40] throne
[1:34:43] listening to
[1:34:45] Dad knowing that he was going to answer
[1:34:49] that prayer in his appointed time but
[1:34:52] something had to be
[1:34:54] accomplished imagine if the young man
[1:34:57] would have come back before he was in
[1:35:00] the pig
[1:35:01] slop he would have been the same person
[1:35:05] but he had to get so low and so
[1:35:10] broken that he knew and he then was
[1:35:14] willing to
[1:35:17] repent and I can tell you our pray
[1:35:21] prayers if they are sincere they are
[1:35:24] going up to the father and he is
[1:35:27] listening he is hearing and he is
[1:35:29] waiting to the right time to answer
[1:35:33] those prayers it may be a day it may be
[1:35:36] a year it maybe a
[1:35:39] decade but he will answer those prayers
[1:35:43] have faith in
[1:35:46] God brother Jordan mentioned that
[1:35:49] there's someone that wants to be prayed
[1:35:51] for
[1:35:52] for sister Angela was it you with the
[1:35:56] kids if you could bring them forward
[1:35:58] friends let me tell
[1:36:00] you the lord loves us to

[1:36:09] two sons out there how happy would the

[1:36:14] embracing each other and loving each
[1:36:17] other our father is up there
[1:36:21] looking down at our service right now
[1:36:24] watching everything that we're doing he
[1:36:26] knows everything that's in your heart he
[1:36:28] knows everything that you're
[1:36:30] thinking he knows everything that's
[1:36:32] going on and he likes it when we pray
[1:36:36] for each
[1:36:37] other if you have a desire friends
