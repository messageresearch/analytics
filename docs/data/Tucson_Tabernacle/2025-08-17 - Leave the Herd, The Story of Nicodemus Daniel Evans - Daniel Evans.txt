[0:00] Uh you heard Bethany sing and my brother
[0:02] Adam's here. I I give a report every
[0:05] once in a while on this boxing gym that
[0:07] we started uh a number of years ago and
[0:11] I used to help teach the the Bible
[0:13] studies and I ended up leaving. Now,
[0:15] Adam, the the full load rests on my
[0:19] brother Adam. And it's just been it's
[0:21] been a real blessing to see how these
[0:25] inner city
[0:28] just a lot of them are just, excuse the
[0:31] term, but they're thugs. And let me tell
[0:34] you, they come in and Adam is not
[0:36] intimidated by anybody. And they come in
[0:39] and he'll set them straight. He'll be
[0:42] he'll be like, "Get in their face.
[0:44] you're doing wrong and they respect him.
[0:46] They call him preach. I'm like, "All
[0:48] right, man. I I like that. That that's
[0:51] good." So, he preaches to these kids
[0:53] every Wednesday evening, teaches a Bible
[0:56] study. And I thought it would be good to
[0:59] give Adam, it's usually short, you know,
[1:03] 10, 15 minutes. And I thought, I asked
[1:06] Adam, I said, "Hey, would you just give
[1:08] us a little taste of of what you do for
[1:10] these these boxers, these fighters?
[1:13] They're not just boxers, but they're MMA
[1:15] fighters. And Adam gets in there right
[1:18] in the middle of them, and they love him
[1:19] and he loves them. And we have seen
[1:22] many, many people come to the Lord Jesus
[1:25] just through this little ministry. So,
[1:27] Adam, if you'd come up and say a few
[1:28] words
[1:30] to the congregation.
[1:36] He's my little brother
[1:39] and I love him very much.
[1:41] Thank you.
[1:46] So
[1:48] Dan asked me, he said, "How about like,
[1:50] you know, 15, 20 minutes, you know, just
[1:52] the regular Bible study thing." And so
[1:55] my wife is part of me. That was five. So
[1:59] I think that takes me down to about 10
[2:02] is what I owe here. Uh I'll read a a a
[2:05] quick scripture.
[2:07] This is in Proverbs. You don't have to
[2:09] look it up. It's Proverbs 13:20.
[2:12] He that walketh with wise men shall be
[2:15] wise,
[2:17] but he that but a companion of fools
[2:21] shall be destroyed.
[2:23] So we see the these these boxers and I'm
[2:27] going tell you a little. So my brother
[2:29] asked me, he said, "Would you speak to
[2:30] him a little bit? What what do you think
[2:32] you want to talk about?" I said, "How
[2:33] about zebras?" And he goes, "Yeah, wait,
[2:35] what?"
[2:37] And I said, "Zebras? I want to talk
[2:39] about zebras." And he's like, "What?
[2:40] what are you talking about? And I kind
[2:42] of told him, he said, "That's good
[2:43] because I think I'm going to talk about
[2:45] monkeys later." It's like, "Okay, well,
[2:47] good. We're on the same page." And so,
[2:49] so I'm I'm gonna tell you a little bit
[2:50] about zebras here in a minute. But these
[2:53] boxers, like a lot of us, they they've
[2:57] just found themselves in hard times a
[2:59] lot of times. And like like my brother
[3:01] said, they're it's it's rough. It's it's
[3:03] a rough neighborhood they're in. It's a
[3:04] rough sport they're in. And for a lot of
[3:06] them, this is the only kind of refuge
[3:09] they have from this this street life for
[3:11] a lot of them. But you get to know them
[3:13] and they're they're they're good.
[3:15] They're they have a heart. They have a
[3:16] soul and and we want to give them some
[3:20] opportunity.
[3:21] But they they have vices. They have
[3:24] things that hold them back like all all
[3:26] of us do.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; We have things and sometimes some some
[3:29] are more visible than others, but we all
[3:31] have them. And they definitely have
[3:33] them. And as you see them want to live
[3:36] better lives, it's one of the things
[3:39] that that we talk about is how do we get
[3:40] rid of these vices? How do we move
[3:42] forward?
[3:45] Zebras.
[3:48] There's a there's a guy that I read some
[3:49] of his stuff. His name is Jordan
[3:51] Peterson. He's not not the Jordan
[3:53] Peterson. That's I don't know if Brother
[3:55] Jordan I don't know if he's here today,
[3:56] but it's he's a
[3:59] &gt;&gt; you have the the Jordan Peterson. This
[4:01] is just a Jordan Peterson. But but I
[4:04] read some of his stuff. Really
[4:05] interesting. It's kind of like why our
[4:07] our psyche is the way it is. Why do we
[4:09] think the way we do? And he he has some
[4:11] really interesting stuff. Well, he tells
[4:12] a story about these the study of zebras
[4:14] that these these men went and did. And
[4:17] so they went out to study zebras. And we
[4:19] all know, you know, somehow zebra
[4:21] stripes are about camouflage, right? But
[4:24] how is it that you can see a zebra a
[4:27] mile away? And it didn't didn't really
[4:29] make sense. So these people were
[4:31] studying zebras just in general.
[4:33] One of them would be watching this
[4:35] certain zebra and that zebra would go
[4:38] and do something and he'd write it down
[4:40] and he'd look up and he's like, "Ah, I
[4:42] lost my zebra." Like, where'd it go?
[4:44] Because there's all these zebras there
[4:45] and they're all intermingling together.
[4:47] And so what they did was they said, "May
[4:49] we need to be able to pick out a certain
[4:50] zebra so we could study this zebra." And
[4:52] so they went and they would paint a spot
[4:55] on this certain zebra so that way they
[4:57] could identify it easy. Okay? And so
[4:59] they painted a spot on the zebra. They
[5:01] started studying it and you know what
[5:03] happened? The lions came and ate that
[5:05] zebra with the spot on it. And it's
[5:08] like, what in the world? And so they did
[5:10] it again. And you know what happened?
[5:13] The lions came and ate that zebra with
[5:14] the spot on it. And what they kind of
[5:16] started to discover
[5:19] was we always say that lions, you know,
[5:21] they hunt the weak, the sick, the the
[5:24] the young ones. And we always thought
[5:27] that was just this like benev benevolent
[5:30] lion that had to take these out of the
[5:32] herd, you know, for suffering. But it's
[5:34] not that. What it is is the lions have
[5:37] this secret language they speak and they
[5:40] know which one that they can isolate
[5:43] and pull it off to its side and hunt
[5:45] that one.
[5:47] And they would know, oh, there's a
[5:49] different one. It's got a spot on it.
[5:52] Let's go hunt that one. And that's the
[5:54] one they would get because they could
[5:55] pull it away from its herd and isolate
[5:58] it.
[6:00] We are zebras. We can't we can't help
[6:03] it. Zebras, they don't have camouflage
[6:07] up against the Serengeti,
[6:10] but they have camouflage against
[6:11] themselves.
[6:13] And so you put these zebras together,
[6:16] you put these zebras together, and it
[6:18] confuses the lions. They can't they
[6:22] can't tell one from the other and
[6:23] they're going in and out and they can't
[6:24] pick one out. So there's safety to these
[6:29] zebras that mix together and they know
[6:31] if they stand out they're in danger and
[6:35] that's the way we feel sometimes and we
[6:37] put ourselves whether it's good or bad
[6:41] we put ourselves in this safety zone. We
[6:44] don't want to be even a zebra on the
[6:47] outside. We want to be in the middle of
[6:48] the herd, right in the middle, and we're
[6:50] safe and we're mixing in with it's like
[6:52] the same thing with fish. You see these
[6:54] schools of fish and they're all trying
[6:55] the big bad fish. They get in the middle
[6:57] of the fish. The fish on the outside,
[6:59] those are the ones that get eaten. So
[7:00] the that's why the fish school together.
[7:02] That's why you never see one zebra,
[7:04] right? They're they're in a group
[7:05] because that's where the safety is.
[7:08] Our minds are kind of the same way.
[7:11] We put ourselves
[7:13] in this box and we say we have to be the
[7:17] certain way
[7:19] because we feel safe. And that might be
[7:22] good, but it might not.
[7:25] When I'm talking to these boxers, I
[7:27] understand
[7:29] they they have this safety zone. It
[7:33] might be terrible. Their zebra herd
[7:36] might be their street gang. Yeah.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; And it's so hard for them to put the
[7:42] spot on themselves and say, "I'm leaving
[7:44] this."
[7:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to step out and do
[7:48] something different.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; Because we're zebras. We want to fit in.
[7:52] Right? So,
[7:55] I guess the message that I'm trying to
[7:57] get across is as we go through this
[8:00] life,
[8:02] always consider what box you're in.
[8:06] And it's not always bad, but it might
[8:09] be. If you're having trouble getting rid
[8:12] of your vices, you're having trouble. I
[8:14] want to serve the Lord and I want to do
[8:16] better and I don't want to do this
[8:18] thing. Ask who's influencing you. Ask
[8:21] who you're surrounding yourself with.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; That's where you feel comfortable. It's
[8:27] not comfortable. It's not good. Right?
[8:29] When those lions come to attack, that's
[8:31] not who you want to be with, right? You
[8:34] want to be you want to be around people
[8:36] who challenge you, challenge you to
[8:38] consider hard things, challenge the way
[8:41] that you've thought, challenge you to
[8:43] get better, challenge you to grow
[8:45] spiritually. That's that's the herd that
[8:48] we want to be in. Right? So, always
[8:50] think about that. Let me read this
[8:51] proverb. Let me read this proverb one
[8:53] more time and then I'll I think I don't
[8:55] know if that's 10 minutes or not, but he
[8:57] that walketh with wise men shall be
[9:00] wise,
[9:02] but he I'm sorry, but a companion of
[9:05] fools shall be destroyed. It's it's
[9:08] juxtaposing these things. Your herd is
[9:12] full of wise men. That's who you
[9:14] associate yourself with. You're going to
[9:16] be wise. Amen.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; You hang out with fools,
[9:20] you're going to be destroyed.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. So, think about it. I
[9:25] know I know my brother talks about it a
[9:26] lot. If you keep doing what you've been
[9:28] doing, you're going to keep getting what
[9:31] you've gotten,
[9:33] right? Sometimes that's, man, I'm going
[9:36] to church. I'm feeling good. The
[9:38] spirit's re revived in me. I'm doing
[9:40] right. Yeah. Keep doing that. You're
[9:41] gonna keep getting that. Man, I just
[9:43] can't get over this. What am I doing? I
[9:45] suffer. I Why can't I quit X, Y, or Z?
[9:49] It's because you're doing what you
[9:50] always been doing.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Change it up.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Change your herd.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; It's hard though. It's hard. There's
[9:57] something in us that says danger. You
[9:59] don't fit in. These people you've been
[10:01] around, you don't fit in with them
[10:03] anymore. Danger. But just understand
[10:06] it's worth it.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; Get away from them,
[10:10] &gt;&gt; right? Challenge yourself that way,
[10:13] &gt;&gt; brother. That's what I got. Appreciate
[10:16] you guys. Love you.
[10:19] Good job. Thank you.
[10:21] [Applause]
[10:23] &gt;&gt; I want to hear about the monkey.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Man, you you messed up my notes.
[10:31] I got the idea from the monkeys about
[10:34] Adam's zebras. And you know, it's like,
[10:36] okay, the Tucson Tabernacle Zoo.
[10:41] He told me, he says, I want to talk
[10:42] about zebras. And I said, you know, I
[10:44] got a story about monkeys. And I I
[10:45] looked up this story. It's a famous um
[10:48] experiment that went on and it is
[10:50] presented wrong usually this experiment
[10:53] on these monkeys. So the experiment goes
[10:57] as you read that there is a this
[11:00] scientist has this bunch of monkeys.
[11:03] Anytime you say monkeys, it makes people
[11:04] smile.
[11:06] That's why I see a bunch of smiles out
[11:08] there. When when when you so you have a
[11:11] bunch of monkeys in this room and you
[11:14] take a banana or a piece of fruit and
[11:18] you put it up at the top of a ladder
[11:21] and then when the monkeys go up to get
[11:23] the fruit,
[11:25] the scientist takes a hose and he sprays
[11:27] them all down and then they run away.
[11:31] And then when they try to go get the
[11:32] fruit again,
[11:34] even if one monkey goes to get the
[11:36] fruit, he sprays all of the monkeys
[11:38] down. So then they take one of those
[11:42] monkeys out that are educated in the in
[11:46] the use of a garden hose and they they
[11:48] put this other monkey in that has no
[11:52] idea what's going on.
[11:54] and he sees the fruit up at the top of
[11:57] the ladder and he goes to get the fruit
[12:00] and all of the monkeys know what's going
[12:02] to happen. So, they all grab him and
[12:04] say, "Don't go and get the fruit."
[12:07] And then after a while, they start
[12:09] taking one monkey out and putting
[12:11] another new monkey in. And these new
[12:13] monkeys, they learn not to get the fruit
[12:15] and to attack the ones that are going to
[12:17] get the fruit. And pretty soon, they're
[12:19] all new monkeys.
[12:21] and the old monkeys that experienced the
[12:23] garden hose are gone and still nobody's
[12:26] getting the fruit. That's how Have you
[12:28] ever heard of that that experiment?
[12:30] Well, it's not true.
[12:33] And that's the that's the monkey story I
[12:36] was going to tell today. So, I'm I'm
[12:37] reading this story and I'm thinking,
[12:40] okay, well, that's good. You know, that
[12:42] that applies to all of our lives. But
[12:44] that actually didn't happen. But the
[12:45] experiment did happen. And you know a
[12:48] lot of times when we're tell telling a
[12:51] story or when we have a testimony
[12:54] it is human nature for that testimony to
[12:58] change over time.
[13:00] It's normal. In fact your memory changes
[13:04] over time and you might tell a story
[13:07] that happened 20 years ago and it might
[13:10] be very very different than when it was.
[13:12] But you know one thing that I've noticed
[13:15] and that is the original story is always
[13:18] the best and what has changed you know
[13:22] you might exaggerate it never ends up as
[13:25] good as the original story that God
[13:26] gives you. So the original experiment
[13:29] here was you have the monkeys and you
[13:32] have the scientist and you have the
[13:34] fruit. Let's call it a banana.
[13:38] And
[13:39] the scientist puts the banana. let's say
[13:42] at the top of the ladder.
[13:45] And when the monkeys go to get the
[13:48] fruit, they're sprayed with compressed
[13:50] air and it scares them and they run
[13:53] away. And then the another one tries to
[13:56] go get the fruit and he gets sprayed
[13:59] with compressed air and they run away.
[14:01] And pretty soon they're not trying to
[14:03] get the fruit anymore because they're
[14:05] afraid they're going to get shot with
[14:07] this air. So then they take a monkey
[14:09] that has no idea what's going on and
[14:12] they place the monkey in with these
[14:15] educated monkeys
[14:17] and this monkey sees the new monkey sees
[14:21] the fruit and he goes to get the fruit
[14:25] and he gets the fruit and he goes and
[14:28] eats it. And the other monkeys see that
[14:32] this monkey got the fruit and they were
[14:34] flinching when he goes to get the fruit.
[14:36] They're like, "Okay, it's going to hit
[14:37] him." It didn't hit him.
[14:40] So then the educated monkeys, they see,
[14:46] "Oh, I think I'm gonna I got the fruit."
[14:52] And then they all go and they get the
[14:54] fruit.
[14:56] And what the bad experience that they
[14:59] had when they first started quickly gets
[15:03] forgotten and they're able to eat the
[15:05] fruit. And it was all because of this
[15:07] new monkey that came in and showed them,
[15:10] hey, don't be afraid. And he didn't know
[15:12] what was going on. He just wanted a
[15:14] banana. and he goes and he grabs the
[15:16] banana and he shows that the other
[15:18] monkeys, even though they had a bad
[15:20] experience, that it's okay to go and get
[15:24] this piece of fruit.
[15:27] And that's what we need always
[15:32] to be careful about.
[15:36] just because we do something or we have
[15:40] done something through generations.
[15:43] It's nice when a new monkey comes in and
[15:47] says, "Why do you do that?"
[15:50] And if you can't answer that question or
[15:52] if you just answer, "Well, this is the
[15:54] way that we've always done it." There's
[15:56] something wrong. And there might be some
[15:59] fruit there that you are not eating that
[16:03] you might be afraid to eat. and the new
[16:06] monkey comes in and it might be somebody
[16:08] new in the congregation and I love it
[16:10] when somebody comes in the in new and
[16:12] they say, "Hey, why do you do this and
[16:15] I'm able to answer it?"
[16:18] And it shouldn't be because that's the
[16:20] way we've always done it. There should
[16:23] be a Bible answer if there is a Bible
[16:27] question.
[16:30] And Adam, I love Adam's story of the
[16:33] zebras
[16:35] where these zebras that they they were
[16:38] they felt comfortable because they all
[16:40] look the same because they all act the
[16:41] same. But when a zebra comes out and a
[16:45] zebra maybe looks different than the
[16:47] other zebras and that zebra is opening
[16:49] himself up to the lions, we need that
[16:53] kind of a leader, that kind of zebras
[16:55] that will that will lead that's not
[16:58] afraid to maybe step away from the herd,
[17:01] maybe ask why.
[17:05] When someone tells you just believe,
[17:07] never ask why, there's something wrong.
[17:11] Always
[17:12] ask if you don't understand. Always ask
[17:15] why. Does this line up with the Bible?
[17:19] And why do we do these things? There was
[17:22] a man in the Bible that I want to talk
[17:24] about this morning. His name
[17:28] was Nicodemus.
[17:31] A lot of people have a bad opinion of
[17:32] Nicodemus that he came by night. He
[17:35] snuck out from his group of priests and
[17:39] he wanted to talk to this man Jesus. He
[17:42] had heard so much about him. He wanted
[17:45] to talk with him. He wanted to see what
[17:47] is all this about. He separated Adam. He
[17:50] separated himself from the herd.
[17:53] Even though it was by night, lions hunt
[17:55] at night, too. But he came out and he
[18:00] said, "I want to know why. I want to
[18:03] know what's going on with this man
[18:04] Jesus. So, let's get into the word.
[18:08] John chapter 1. And this is about this
[18:11] man, Nicodemus. And we'll see the
[18:14] progression of this man. Nicodemus was a
[18:18] Pharisee. Not only was he a Pharisee,
[18:20] but he was a leader of the Pharisees. I
[18:22] have heard him called the a Pharisee of
[18:24] the Pharisees. A teacher of the
[18:27] teachers. This man was very respected.
[18:30] This man Nicodemus, he had the respect
[18:33] of all the preachers. He had the respect
[18:34] of everyone. And here he comes and he's
[18:37] like, "Everybody seems to be in
[18:39] agreement here. The herd is all
[18:40] running." And Nicodemus is like, "Yeah,
[18:43] but
[18:45] that banana looks really good.
[18:49] I'd like to maybe try it out."
[18:54] There was a man John chapter 3 verse
[18:57] one. There was a man of the Pharisees
[19:00] named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[19:04] The same came to Jesus by night and said
[19:07] unto him, "Rabbi,
[19:09] we know that thou art a teacher come
[19:11] from God." What a statement, and I
[19:14] believe he was sincere when he said it.
[19:17] We know that you are a teacher that
[19:19] comes from God.
[19:22] For no man can do the miracle, these
[19:24] miracles that thou doest except God be
[19:26] with him.
[19:28] He was the top of the Sanhedrin council.
[19:32] This man Nicodemus, as I said, very well
[19:35] respected.
[19:36] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[19:38] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[19:42] a man be born again, he cannot, he
[19:44] cannot see the kingdom of God."
[19:48] Nicodemus saith unto him, "How can a man
[19:52] be born when he is old? Can he enter a
[19:55] second time into the mother's womb and
[19:56] be born? Nicodemus is taking this with
[19:58] an open mind. He didn't come to argue
[20:01] with Jesus. He came by night. He had
[20:03] something in his heart. He wanted to
[20:05] know what was going on and he was
[20:07] willing to separate himself from the
[20:09] herd a little bit. The very fact that he
[20:11] is with Jesus and that he is questioning
[20:15] it means that he's questioning his old
[20:17] way of thinking. Just the fact that he
[20:19] came out and he's with Jesus. He's not
[20:22] understanding.
[20:25] But there must have been something in
[20:27] this priest that was sincere,
[20:31] that was longing, maybe longing for a
[20:33] change, that was maybe hungry.
[20:36] And he saw everybody else cowering down
[20:39] in a corner
[20:41] or talking among them amongst
[20:42] themselves. And but there was a hunger
[20:44] inside of this man Nicodemus.
[20:49] So he asked, he says, "Can I enter back
[20:51] into my mother's womb and be born again?
[20:52] I don't understand what you're talking
[20:53] about." Jesus answered, said, "Verily,
[20:56] verily, I say unto thee, except a man be
[20:57] born of water and of the spirit, he
[21:00] cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[21:03] That which is born of the flesh is
[21:05] flesh, and that which is born of the
[21:07] spirit is spirit." So Jesus is telling
[21:10] him that there's something beyond your
[21:12] religion, Nicodemus.
[21:14] There's something beyond your life.
[21:16] There is something more. There's
[21:17] something greater.
[21:19] Marvel not that I said to thee that you
[21:22] must be born again.
[21:25] He says this. He says, "The wind bloweth
[21:27] where it listeth.
[21:30] And thou hearest the sound thereof, but
[21:32] can't not tell whence it cometh and
[21:34] whether it goest. So is everyone that is
[21:38] born of the spirit." New Living
[21:40] Translations, easier to understand on
[21:42] this one. It says, "The wind blows."
[21:44] Jesus speaking, "The wind blows wherever
[21:46] it wants."
[21:48] Just as you can hear the wind, but you
[21:50] can't tell where it comes from or where
[21:53] it is going, so you can't explain how
[21:56] people are born of the spirit.
[21:59] We all want to put a limit of God on
[22:01] God. We all want to say that if you
[22:04] become a zebra, then you'll receive the
[22:07] Holy Spirit. If you listen to this type
[22:10] of music, you will receive the Holy
[22:12] Spirit. The Holy Spirit, friends, is not
[22:14] subject to our understanding. The Holy
[22:17] Spirit's like the wind. It blows
[22:18] wherever it wants to.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if I'm just standing
[22:22] here and the wind hits me in the side of
[22:24] the face. I can't say I I don't like
[22:27] that. No, the wind controls where the
[22:29] wind goes.
[22:33] And we don't know how it happens. We
[22:35] don't know why it happens. We just know
[22:36] the wind blows. And Nicodemus answered
[22:39] and said to them, "How can these things
[22:40] be?"
[22:43] Jesus answered and said unto him, "Art
[22:45] thou a master of Israel and knowest not
[22:48] these things?"
[22:50] Nicodemus, you're teaching.
[22:54] You're a master. You're a teacher of the
[22:56] teachers, and you don't know these
[22:58] things. There are so many times that
[23:01] that ministers come in the pull pit
[23:04] and they are teaching things that they
[23:06] really don't understand.
[23:09] These things have been told to them and
[23:12] they have taken them as the truth and
[23:14] then they just regurgitate them out and
[23:17] not really having that experience. And
[23:20] Jesus is like, "Nicodemus, you got way
[23:22] more education than I do. You've been
[23:25] around this way longer than I have,
[23:26] Nicodemus, but you're a teacher of this
[23:29] and you really don't understand even
[23:31] what you're teaching.
[23:34] And it's not just pastors,
[23:36] but they tell each other how a church
[23:38] should be run and how a pastor should
[23:40] preach without understanding of what
[23:43] they're talking about
[23:46] and with no banana as their evidence.
[23:52] 1 Timothy chapter 1 says, "As I urge you
[23:55] when you when I went into Macedonia,
[23:57] remain in Ephesus that you may that you
[24:00] may charge," the Apostle Paul's
[24:02] speaking, "that you may charge some that
[24:04] they teach no other doctrine, nor give
[24:06] heed to fables and endless genealogies
[24:08] which cause disputes rather than godly
[24:10] edification which is in faith."
[24:14] Now the purpose of the commandment,
[24:17] the apostle Paul is saying, now the
[24:19] purpose of the commandment, I'm reading
[24:21] the New King James Version, is love
[24:26] from a pure heart, from a good
[24:28] conscience
[24:30] and from a sincere faith
[24:33] from which some having strayed have
[24:36] turned aside
[24:38] to idol talk. King James says to j to
[24:41] vain jangling I believe it says yes
[24:45] to idol talk desiring to be teachers of
[24:47] the law understanding neither what they
[24:49] say nor the things which they affirm
[24:53] and here is Jesus talking to Nicodemus
[24:55] he's like Nicodemus you're trying to
[24:57] teach this stuff you're trying to teach
[24:59] Moses's commandments you're trying to
[25:02] and you are the professor of the
[25:03] professors and you you don't know what's
[25:06] real Nicodemus
[25:09] You're just in the room with the monkeys
[25:14] and there's fruit there. There's food
[25:16] there.
[25:19] And here Jesus is telling the master
[25:22] teacher,
[25:24] he's like, "Nicodemus,
[25:27] you're not understanding.
[25:31] Verily, verily, I say unto thee.
[25:34] We speak that we do know, and testify
[25:40] that we have seen, and you receive not
[25:43] our witness.
[25:50] I uh
[25:53] it's very frustrating
[25:56] and I know it was frustrating to Jesus
[25:59] when he is being told by all these
[26:01] Pharisees here's how you should do it
[26:03] and Jesus comes back in Nicodemus and he
[26:05] says listen here's what's happening
[26:07] here's what's going on you don't have it
[26:09] in your church
[26:11] and you're criticizing me and you're
[26:14] criticiz he says us
[26:17] If I have told you earthly things, and
[26:20] you believe not, how shall you believe
[26:22] if I tell you heavenly things, and no
[26:25] man hath ascended up to heaven, but he
[26:27] that cometh down from heaven, even the
[26:30] Son of man which is in heaven.
[26:33] Nicodemus, his mind is probably blown
[26:35] right now
[26:37] because he was Nicodemus is a believer
[26:41] and he's like, "Wow, he's speaking to me
[26:44] here and he's saying that he's in heaven
[26:47] and and this is this is awesome."
[26:51] And Nicodemus is is is just listening to
[26:54] this. And it could be that Jesus is
[26:58] continuing to introduce him to the way
[27:02] as it was called before it was called
[27:04] Christianity.
[27:06] He was he's introducing him to the
[27:07] message. He's introducing him to the
[27:09] gospel. Whatever you want to call it,
[27:12] Jesus is giving Nicodemus the chance to
[27:14] receive eternal life.
[27:18] and Moses. And as Moses lifted up the
[27:20] serpent in the wilderness, even so must
[27:22] the Son of Man be lifted up. Nicodemus
[27:25] was a scholar. He knew his Bible. He
[27:27] knew that Moses lifted up that bronze
[27:29] serpent in the wilderness to where
[27:31] people when they were bitten by a snake,
[27:33] they could look up at this bronze
[27:35] serpent and they could be healed.
[27:38] And Jesus is comparing himself
[27:41] to that bronze serpent. He's giving
[27:44] Nicodemus a chance.
[27:47] And whosoever believeth in him should
[27:49] not perish, the one that the bronze
[27:52] serpent was made after should not
[27:54] perish, but have have eternal life.
[27:57] Nicodemus, this is greater than your
[27:59] healing, Nicodemus, this is greater than
[28:02] being delivered from nicotine or alcohol
[28:06] or pornography or sexual improprieties.
[28:08] Nicodemus, this is greater than being
[28:11] delivered of them all. This is your
[28:13] eternal salvation, Nicodemus.
[28:16] I remember Adam, Adam and I, Bethany was
[28:19] there, Stephanie was there, Daniel was
[28:20] there. My mom was dying of cancer
[28:24] and we were, it had been, it was winter
[28:27] and the sun hadn't shone and it seemed
[28:30] like months
[28:32] and we're in there and we were having
[28:34] service with mom in her house and mom
[28:38] was just she was on her deathbed. It was
[28:39] it was the late stages of cancer for
[28:42] mom.
[28:44] And we started singing after service,
[28:48] just our little service in our house.
[28:50] And as we were singing,
[28:54] the clouds
[28:56] parted and the sun started shining in
[29:00] the room.
[29:04] And
[29:05] I I remember I said, "Let's pray for
[29:07] mom."
[29:09] And we all got around mom and remember
[29:12] mom's dying. It could be any moment
[29:14] then. She couldn't get up. She couldn't
[29:16] walk. She couldn't do she couldn't do
[29:17] anything.
[29:19] And
[29:22] I laid my hands on her and and my my
[29:25] brothers and my my family laid our hands
[29:27] on her and and we started praying.
[29:32] And I remember saying this. I remember
[29:34] saying, "Satan, you have no right. Back
[29:36] off."
[29:38] And as we were all praying and as Adam
[29:40] was praying, he had his hands on mom and
[29:42] he felt and he was right by the cancer
[29:47] and Adam felt the cancer
[29:51] start to try to leave and he felt it
[29:53] push up against his side. Adam, am I
[29:55] right? Raise your hand if I'm if I'm
[29:57] saying it right.
[29:59] Pushed up against his side. the the
[30:02] enemy, the demon that was there that was
[30:04] tormenting my mom wanted out.
[30:09] And Adam basically was like, "You're not
[30:11] coming in here." That's what he told me
[30:14] after it happened.
[30:16] That day,
[30:18] mom stood up.
[30:21] She hadn't raised her arm where the
[30:23] cancer was in months. She raised one
[30:25] arm.
[30:27] We were praying. She raised both arms
[30:30] and she said, "It's leaving.
[30:33] It's leaving."
[30:35] Standing there longer than she had stood
[30:37] in months
[30:40] and the cancer left and the next day she
[30:44] hiked four miles in the state park.
[30:48] But let me tell you something. Mom got
[30:51] sick again.
[30:53] Few years later she got sick with cancer
[30:57] and she died.
[30:59] When we are healed
[31:02] there is a purpose in our healing. And
[31:04] it's not just our healing. When we see a
[31:07] miracle it's not the miracle that is the
[31:10] purpose. It is it is underlying. It is
[31:13] laying a foundation for something far
[31:15] more important. And this is what Jesus
[31:17] is telling Nicodemus. This is far
[31:20] greater Nicodemus than anything. This is
[31:22] your salvation. Mom died, but I have a
[31:25] promise that I will see her again
[31:28] because this same one that came to
[31:30] Nicodemus came to mom, saved her, saved
[31:34] me.
[31:35] That's the important thing. The healing,
[31:37] you're going to get sick again. You You
[31:39] get delivered of this, you're going to
[31:40] struggle with something else. Praise the
[31:42] Lord that he's so good to us that he
[31:44] delivers us. But the main thing is that
[31:47] we come to a living Jesus Christ like
[31:50] this Nicodemus was seeing here. And
[31:52] Nicodemus is trying to or the the Lord
[31:54] Jesus is trying to introduce him to
[31:57] this. And there's Nicodemus. And I
[31:59] guarantee he was taking it in like whoa
[32:02] whoa.
[32:04] Verse number 16.
[32:06] For God so loved the world. Jesus
[32:09] talking to Nicodemus.
[32:11] For God so loved the world that he gave
[32:13] his only begotten son
[32:15] that whosoever believeth in him should
[32:17] not perish but have everlasting life.
[32:22] How much greater of a miracle? How much
[32:25] greater of a promise is that than being
[32:28] delivered, than being healed, whatever
[32:30] it might be. That is the greatest
[32:33] promise. And that is what Jesus is
[32:35] telling Nicodemus. It's like, listen,
[32:37] this is it. And there is Jesus
[32:41] saying, "God
[32:44] gave his only begotten son." And there
[32:45] he was looking right at him. Can you
[32:48] imagine being in Nicodemus position?
[32:50] There you are looking at the son of God,
[32:54] the one that God
[32:56] is giving for our salvation.
[33:01] I'll read it again.
[33:04] We all have it memorized.
[33:07] For God so loved the world. Jesus
[33:09] talking to Nicodemus at night, maybe
[33:12] across the table. For God so loved the
[33:15] world that he gave his only begotten son
[33:17] that whosoever believeth in him should
[33:19] not perish but have everlasting life.
[33:23] For God sent not his son into the world
[33:26] to condemn the world, but that the world
[33:29] through him might be saved.
[33:32] He that believeth on him is not
[33:33] condemned. But he that believeth not is
[33:35] condemned already because he hath not
[33:39] believed in the name of the only
[33:41] begotten son of God
[33:44] and nothing else. Friends,
[33:46] the monkeys are afraid.
[33:49] But if you lift up Jesus Christ,
[33:53] overcome that fear.
[33:56] Overcome that fear like Adam said of
[33:58] leaving the herd.
[34:00] You don't have to be where you are now.
[34:05] You can walk out on your own
[34:08] and say, "You know what? The lions are
[34:11] going to eat me, but I have a champion
[34:16] and Satan, you can't do anything to me
[34:19] without him approving it."
[34:23] Verse number 19.
[34:26] And this is the condemnation that light
[34:28] is come into the world and men loved
[34:32] darkness
[34:34] rather than light because their deeds
[34:37] were evil. We think of devils and we
[34:41] think of demons.
[34:43] But Jesus here is speaking to a priest
[34:47] and he's saying that men love darkness
[34:50] rather than light. How do we know that
[34:52] these people love darkness rather than
[34:54] light is because of what they do.
[34:59] It could be drugs, could be sex, could
[35:04] be doctrines in the church.
[35:08] The ones that pull people away from
[35:11] Christ and his teaching and add
[35:14] something else are the ones that Jesus
[35:16] is talking about here. And all of us
[35:19] have weaknesses. Every person here has a
[35:23] weakness. And the enemy will use your
[35:26] weakness to pull you away from Jesus.
[35:34] For everyone
[35:36] that doeth evil hateth the light,
[35:39] neither cometh to the light, lest his
[35:41] deeds should be reproved. But he that
[35:45] doeth truth cometh to the light that his
[35:49] deeds may be made manifest that they are
[35:53] wrought in God.
[35:55] New International Version says, "But
[35:57] whoever lives by the truth comes into
[36:00] the light so that it may be seen plainly
[36:04] that what they have done has been done
[36:08] in the sight of God."
[36:12] And Jesus's conversation here with this
[36:14] priest comes to an end. But a seed was
[36:18] planted in this man. And it's probably a
[36:22] couple years passed until we see this
[36:24] Nicodemus again. It said, I was
[36:26] wondering why is Nicodemus only in John
[36:30] and Matthew, Mark, and Luke. He's not
[36:32] mentioned. And as I was studying,
[36:36] one of the theologians, one of the
[36:38] commentaries said that John's gospel was
[36:43] probably written last of all of them.
[36:47] And Nicodemus was still alive
[36:50] with these other ones. And if they would
[36:52] have mentioned him, it would have put
[36:55] Nicodemus in danger.
[36:58] I don't know if that was the answer or
[37:01] not, but here is this man Nicodemus
[37:06] and Jesus had planted a seed inside of
[37:09] him from this night conversation
[37:13] and it started to grow inside of
[37:17] Nicodemus.
[37:21] And then
[37:24] as time goes on, we see Nicodemus show
[37:27] up in the scriptures again. And
[37:29] Nicodemus is starting to develop this
[37:33] strength. He's starting to develop this
[37:35] faith. And sometimes, friends, you know,
[37:37] there's there's two kinds of
[37:38] personalities that I see in life. When
[37:41] you go swimming,
[37:43] there are the ones that just jump in.
[37:47] And then there are those of us, my wife,
[37:51] she just jumps in. And then those of of
[37:54] us that, you know, I gotta go in slow
[37:56] and
[37:58] it's cold, you know, and then you go in
[38:00] a little bit further and a little bit
[38:01] further.
[38:03] So, it's not all of us that can be a
[38:06] Peter and a James and a John and a
[38:09] Matthew that as soon as they see Jesus,
[38:11] they just jump right in. There's also in
[38:14] Nicodemus that he's just waiting in
[38:16] slow. He wants to make sure.
[38:20] So when we're witnessing to people,
[38:22] never give up.
[38:24] They might just be like Nicodemus. They
[38:26] might be coming in slowly.
[38:30] So Jesus accuses.
[38:33] Later on in the gospel, we see that
[38:35] Jesus accuses the people of exactly what
[38:37] they were planning on doing. They were
[38:39] planning to kill him.
[38:42] Jesus healed a man on the Sabbath day.
[38:45] And this scripture, really, this
[38:46] scripture always amazes me. They condemn
[38:49] Jesus for healing on the Sabbath day,
[38:51] but they but they haven't healed anyone.
[38:55] They sit in the corner, the monkeys,
[38:59] doing nothing, afraid that they're going
[39:00] to get sprayed with air.
[39:04] And here they're condemning Jesus. I'm
[39:06] about to read. They're condemning Jesus
[39:07] for healing. You shouldn't be healing
[39:09] people on the Sabbath. And here's Jesus
[39:11] is like, "What are you what are you
[39:13] doing?"
[39:15] John 7 20. Listen to this.
[39:20] The people answered and said, "Thou hast
[39:22] the devil.
[39:24] Who goeth about to kill thee?" Remember
[39:26] Jesus had just said, "You're you're
[39:27] trying to you're going to you're trying
[39:28] to kill me." And Jesus answered and said
[39:30] unto them, "I have done one work, and
[39:32] you all marvel?" Moses therefore gave
[39:35] unto you circumcision, not because it is
[39:38] of Moses, but of the fathers. And ye on
[39:41] the Sabbath day, circumcise a man. So
[39:44] what Jesus is saying here is Moses
[39:47] commanded that a that a a a boy child is
[39:51] born and then eight days later you
[39:53] circumcise him. If that eight days later
[39:56] falls on the Sabbath, then circumcision
[40:00] is more important than honoring the
[40:02] Sabbath. So you circumcise that child on
[40:06] the Sabbath. It's okay. You don't wait.
[40:11] If a man on the Sabbath day receives
[40:14] circumcision that the law of Moses
[40:16] should not be broken, are you angry at
[40:19] me? Because I have made a man every wit
[40:21] whole on the Sabbath day. I healed him
[40:23] on the Sabbath. And why are you angry at
[40:25] me? You circumcised a baby on the
[40:28] Sabbath and you're mad at me because I
[40:30] healed someone. Listen to this. Judge
[40:34] not according to the appearance,
[40:38] but judge righteous judgment.
[40:42] English Standard Version says, "Do not
[40:44] judge by appearances,
[40:47] but judge with right judgment." NIV
[40:50] says, "Stop judging by mere appearances,
[40:53] but instead judge correctly." I hear so
[40:56] many people saying, "Oh, you can't judge
[40:57] me." Well, Jesus said, "I can't.
[41:02] Yeah, right. Brother Manny just said,
[41:03] "By their fruits, but I can judge." And
[41:07] we do judge. We don't condemn someone.
[41:11] Not with condemnation do we judge. He
[41:14] just says here, "Don't look at somebody
[41:16] and try to judge them by their
[41:18] appearance."
[41:19] Commandment from Jesus. It's in red in
[41:21] your Bible. Don't judge by appearance.
[41:27] Adam's zebra story. We think that we're
[41:30] safe if we all look alike.
[41:32] If we all just look like the rest of the
[41:34] herd. But sometimes God requires us to
[41:37] look different
[41:38] and to act different. And God requires
[41:41] us to judge according to the spirit and
[41:44] that we judge righteously.
[41:47] And when you do,
[41:50] get ready to be sprayed with air. Get
[41:53] ready to be attacked with lions. and
[41:56] they will because you might just come
[41:58] out of the hurt
[42:01] and that's what Nicodemus is doing.
[42:03] It was coming out very slowly. He's
[42:06] coming out. Let's skip to verse 31.
[42:11] And many of the pe people believed on
[42:13] him and said, "When Christ cometh, he
[42:16] will do more mir when Christ cometh,
[42:19] will he do more miracles than these
[42:21] which this man hath done?" Proof of
[42:24] Jesus success was in what he had done.
[42:30] You got to see, you have to ask
[42:32] yourself, as I said, question, is your
[42:35] doctrine bearing fruit? Are you seeing
[42:38] results?
[42:40] Are you just walking around the herd and
[42:41] looking like everybody else?
[42:45] You're sitting at the bottom of the of
[42:46] the ladder looking at the banana.
[42:50] Nicodemus must have been considering all
[42:52] of these things and he must have looked
[42:54] at himself and sometimes as I said
[42:56] sometimes we change quickly and
[42:58] sometimes we change slowly. Nicodemus
[43:00] was slowly changing and Jesus said stop
[43:03] judging by appearances but instead judge
[43:07] correctly. Are you seeing a closer walk
[43:10] with the Lord in your life by what
[43:12] you're doing
[43:14] regardless of how the outside looks?
[43:19] And the Pharisees heard that the people
[43:21] murmured such things concerning him. And
[43:23] the Pharisees and the chief priests sent
[43:25] officers to take him. Skip to verse 45.
[43:30] Then came the officers to the chief
[43:32] priests and the Pharisees, and they said
[43:34] unto them, Why have you not brought him?
[43:38] And the officers answered, "Never a man
[43:40] spake like this man."
[43:44] Then answered them the Pharisees, "Are
[43:46] you also deceived?" Spray them with air.
[43:51] Scort them with water. "Are you also
[43:54] deceived?" They accused them. "Oh,
[43:57] you're coming out. You think you're
[43:59] something special, huh? Adam, you got a
[44:02] spot on your side that's making you not
[44:05] fit in with the rest of the zebras."
[44:08] Never a man spake like this man.
[44:12] And then the Pharisees answered, "Are
[44:13] you also deceived? Have any of the
[44:15] rulers
[44:17] or of the of the Pharisees believed on
[44:19] him?
[44:22] But this people who knoweth not the law
[44:24] are cursed." New Living Translation of
[44:27] those last three scriptures says this,
[44:28] "Have you been led astray too?" The one
[44:30] that said that nobody speaks like this.
[44:32] Have you been led astray too? The
[44:35] Pharisees mocked. Is there a single one
[44:38] of us rulers or Pharisees who believes
[44:41] in him?
[44:43] These foolish crowds follow him, but
[44:46] they are ignorant of the law. God's
[44:48] curse is on them is what they said. But
[44:53] there was a monkey in the troop
[44:55] that was considering that banana
[44:58] that was considering that food, that was
[45:00] considering that eternal life, that was
[45:02] considering what Jesus had told him by
[45:04] night, maybe a year or two earlier,
[45:08] Nicodemus
[45:10] saith unto them, he that came to Jesus
[45:14] by night, being one of them, one of the
[45:16] Pharisees,
[45:18] does our law judge any man before it
[45:20] hear him, and know what he doeth.
[45:24] This is just the start. Nicodemus is
[45:28] breaking the ranks. He's walking away.
[45:31] He's questioning.
[45:34] That spirit
[45:36] hates when someone questions.
[45:39] It hates it. But Nicodemus is saying,
[45:41] "Ah, wait a minute. Wait a minute." And
[45:44] they answered and said unto him, "Art
[45:46] thou also of Galilee?
[45:48] Search and look, for out of Galilee
[45:50] ariseth no prophet. Galile's up north.
[45:53] They're saying that the prophet was
[45:55] supposed to come, the Messiah is
[45:57] supposed to come out of Bethlehem.
[45:59] Bethlehem's right next to Jerusalem.
[46:02] But Jesus came from Nazareth. They
[46:04] didn't know that he was born in
[46:05] Bethlehem.
[46:08] And every man went to his own house.
[46:13] So Nicodemus, he made a little stand
[46:16] right there. He went a little bit deeper
[46:17] into the pool. It may not have seemed
[46:20] like much, but it was something.
[46:23] Don't always need to jump in with both
[46:25] feet. Sometimes it's better just to go
[46:28] slow. Make sure you're right. The
[46:30] disciples, as I said, the disciples,
[46:32] Matthew, he just jumped in with both
[46:33] feet. But Nicodemus waited in slowly. We
[46:37] want to see changes. We want to see
[46:38] changes in our children's lives. We want
[46:40] to be see changes in our lives and our
[46:43] loved ones and that and our loved ones.
[46:44] And that happens sometimes, but other
[46:47] times it happened like Nicodemus. He
[46:49] just
[46:51] went slow. The worship team can come and
[46:54] we'll close.
[46:56] And then we see Nicodemus showing up
[46:58] later on.
[47:00] The last time we see him,
[47:03] I read
[47:05] there's an apocryphal apocryphal book,
[47:08] one that's not considered inspired
[47:11] that's called the Gospel of Nicodemus.
[47:13] And then there's other histories that I
[47:15] read about Nicodemus.
[47:17] And the best that I could tell,
[47:19] Nicodemus was excommunicated from the
[47:21] Sanhedrin Council and kicked out as a
[47:23] priest
[47:25] and was thrown out because of his stand
[47:27] for Jesus. Now listen to this. This is
[47:31] after Jesus was crucified. We don't know
[47:32] that for sure. It's not in the Bible,
[47:34] but this is the last that we see of this
[47:36] man. And watch the stand that he makes.
[47:41] He's like, "All of you all, you can be
[47:43] afraid of getting sprayed by air, but
[47:47] I'm going to do it."
[47:50] And after this, Joseph of Arythea, who
[47:52] was also a priest,
[47:54] being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly
[47:57] for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate,
[48:00] that he might take away the body of
[48:02] Jesus. And Pilate gave him leave.
[48:07] And he came thereof and took the body of
[48:09] Jesus.
[48:12] And there came also Nicodemus,
[48:16] which at the first came to Jesus by
[48:19] night, and brought a mixture of myrr and
[48:23] allows about a 100 pound weight. Brother
[48:26] Aaron, if you could come and also help
[48:27] with the with our closing um music.
[48:34] Nicodemus loved this man Jesus.
[48:38] He brought all of this expensive
[48:40] inbalming material and did his best. And
[48:46] you can tell that this man, he was
[48:49] willing. He was willing to come out of
[48:50] the herd.
[48:53] Now, in the place where and then I'll go
[48:56] back to verse 40. Then they took the
[48:58] body of Jesus and wound it with linen
[49:00] clothes and with spices as the manner of
[49:02] the Jews is to bury. Now when the place
[49:06] Now in the place where he was crucified,
[49:10] there was a garden
[49:13] and in the garden a new suppler, a new
[49:16] grave,
[49:17] wherein was never a man yet laid. There
[49:21] laid they Jesus. These two priests,
[49:27] two Pharisees.
[49:31] This one Pharisee came by night and
[49:33] Jesus told him said that God so loved
[49:38] you
[49:40] that he gave his only begotten son so
[49:42] that you might have eternal life
[49:44] Nicodemus.
[49:47] And here is that man that came to Jesus
[49:50] by night and this other Pharisee.
[49:55] There they laid Jesus. Therefore,
[49:56] because the Jew because of the Jews
[49:58] preparation day
[50:01] for the supplr was not at hand. Joseph
[50:04] of Arythea, I believe, is the one that
[50:06] gave the grave
[50:08] to Jesus. Nicodemus is the one that
[50:10] brought the spices
[50:12] and laid this greatest man that has ever
[50:16] walked the earth to rest.
[50:19] G Nicodemus sat across from him and he
[50:22] got that one onone with Jesus and he was
[50:26] willing to come out of the herd
[50:28] and give his life to this man.
[50:32] [Music]
[50:34] We don't know for sure where Nicodemus
[50:37] ended up. We don't know for sure what
[50:39] happened to him. As I said, I read the
[50:41] history and he was kicked out because he
[50:45] made that stand. But what whatever
[50:48] happened to him, I think the proof is in
[50:51] the Bible that this man gave his heart
[50:56] to Jesus Christ.
[50:58] came out of the herd,
[51:00] went up the ladder,
[51:02] got the got the food, and I wonder how
[51:06] many people gave their hearts to the
[51:08] Lord because of Nicodemus's testimony,
[51:10] that Pharisee. And how come it's so much
[51:13] harder
[51:15] for a
[51:17] minister, for a priest
[51:20] to give their hearts to the Lord as it
[51:22] was to Mary Magdalene and Mary of
[51:24] Bethany and and Matthew and Peter and
[51:26] James and John. But there are still
[51:30] godly ministers, godly priests who gave
[51:33] their heart and made a stand for Jesus
[51:37] Christ. And I believe Nicodemus was one
[51:40] of them. Amen.
[51:43] Brother Heath, I'm going to meet him one
[51:44] day. Shake his hand and say, "Thanks,
[51:48] bro.
[51:50] What a testimony you had." Let's all
[51:52] stand.
[51:54] Come by here, Lord. Brother Aaron, could
[51:56] you help us with that?
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Come by here, my lord.
[52:04] Come by here.
[52:09] [Music]
[52:11] Come by here,
[52:14] Lord.
[52:17] Come by here.
[52:23] Come by here. Here my Lord
[52:29] come by here.
[52:35] Oh Lord
[52:38] come by here.
[52:44] Someone's praying Lord
[52:50] come by here. Amen. Oh yes,
[52:55] someone's praying home.
[53:01] Come by here.
[53:05] [Music]
[53:07] Someone's praying.
[53:10] Oh,
[53:12] [Music]
[53:13] come by here.
[53:19] Oh Lord,
[53:22] come by here.
[53:27] Someone's praying. Oh,
[53:33] come by here.
[53:38] Someone's praying. Lord,
[53:44] come by.
[53:50] Someone's praying. Lord,
[53:53] [Music]
[53:55] come by here.
[54:00] Oh Lord,
[54:03] come by here.
[54:06] Brothers and sisters, we all have an
[54:07] opportunity and we have an opportunity
[54:09] this morning
[54:11] to stand before
[54:14] a resurrected Jesus Christ to renew our
[54:18] vows to him and say, "Lord, I'll leave
[54:22] my herd.
[54:24] Lord, I'll leave everything that's ever
[54:26] meant anything to me. If you require it,
[54:29] just Lord, let me be
[54:33] in your will and in your word and in
[54:37] your thoughts and in your love. Lord,
[54:40] just let me be.
[54:44] The most wonderful thing about this
[54:48] is so few people could come to Jesus
[54:51] back at that time. He was just one man.
[54:54] So few people could get to him. But now
[54:56] anyone who has a desire can come to
[54:59] Jesus Christ, can give their lives to
[55:02] him.
[55:03] But he requires a total commitment. He
[55:08] requires a total surrender.
[55:12] He sets the bar very high, friends. He
[55:15] wants it all. He wants your addictions.
[55:20] He wants your religion.
[55:22] He wants everything about you that you
[55:25] hold dear. He wants it.
[55:29] Will you give it to him?
[55:32] Will you just say, "Lord, I surrender it
[55:34] all. I just want to give it to you."
[55:38] Will you do it?
[55:40] Brother, can we sing that one more time?
[55:42] Come by here.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Come by here, Lord.
[55:48] Come by here.
[55:54] Come by here, my Lord.
[56:00] Come by here.
[56:06] Come by here. My Lord,
[56:11] come by here.
[56:15] [Music]
[56:17] Oh Lord,
[56:19] come by. Let's bow our heads.
[56:23] [Music]
[56:24] Friends, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[56:28] if you would like to dedicate your life
[56:30] to him,
[56:33] you have the ability to do it right now.
[56:36] If you want a change in your life, if
[56:39] you are willing
[56:41] to be that zebra, if you're willing to
[56:45] be that monkey, if you are willing to be
[56:47] that wretch
[56:50] that gives his or her life to the Lord
[56:53] and says, "Lord, I will do whatever you
[56:56] want me to do. I lay down my religion. I
[56:59] lay down my life. I lay down my
[57:00] addiction." If you want to do that, just
[57:03] raise your hand in the name of Jesus
[57:06] Christ. Raise your hand. Say, "Lord, I
[57:08] surrender to you.
[57:12] Oh, holy and righteous God.
[57:16] Lord, you can look down upon this
[57:19] congregation and Father, see those hands
[57:21] that were raised.
[57:24] And Lord, I pray that you would honor
[57:26] everyone.
[57:28] And Father,
[57:30] it might take us leaving the herd. It
[57:34] might take us, Father, laying something
[57:36] down that that we hold dear to us or
[57:40] making a commitment.
[57:43] But Lord, we pray that you would give us
[57:44] strength and protect us from the lions
[57:48] that would attack,
[57:52] Father, your
[57:54] cherished sons and daughters.
[57:56] Thank you for those words that Jesus
[57:58] spoke to Nicodemus.
[58:01] For God so loved the world. And Lord,
[58:04] we're talking to the same one that Jesus
[58:05] was talking about that you so loved the
[58:09] world that you gave your only begotten
[58:12] son that whosoever believeth in him,
[58:17] Father, that we would not perish, Lord,
[58:20] that that that we would receive
[58:24] eternal life.
[58:26] Lord, we're grateful for that
[58:29] conversation that Jesus had, probably
[58:31] the most famous conversation ever had in
[58:34] the history of this world was between
[58:37] this priest
[58:39] who had a desire for a change in his
[58:42] life.
[58:44] Lord, I commit myself to you and commit
[58:46] all those that raise their hands to you
[58:49] in Jesus name. We love you. Amen.
