[26:24] forward to digging into this book of
[26:27] First Kings and second Kings in 1 and 2
[26:30] Chronicles uh you talk about some of the
[26:33] most interesting stories in the entire
[26:36] book they're in here and wow are they
[26:39] just absolutely incredible and really
[26:42] deep like you can really apply a lot of
[26:46] these things to your own
[26:48] life um first uh announcements is like I
[26:52] sent out on WhatsApp brother Isaac
[26:54] osario and Jerusalem Tabernacle there
[26:57] having their anniversary meetings they
[27:00] will start on Friday it would be Friday
[27:02] Saturday and Sunday morning and then uh
[27:04] brother Doug Baker is having meetings I
[27:07] believe they start tonight and they will
[27:09] be going through Sunday evening so um we
[27:14] will uh cancel probably if the Lord's
[27:16] willing we'll cancel our service on
[27:18] Sunday evening so we can all go over to
[27:20] brother Doug Baker's church and
[27:22] fellowship with them there uh for the
[27:24] close of those
[27:26] meetings so um I know that both brother
[27:30] sario and brother Baker I don't know
[27:31] brother Baker very well I think I've
[27:33] only met him one time but I know that I
[27:35] would appreciate it if people came to
[27:37] our meetings and just filled up the
[27:39] seats so if you uh if you could it would
[27:43] be nice to visit um to visit them
[27:46] Katrina it's good to see
[27:49] you you're a yeah good this is our
[27:53] neighbor right here Katrina next I have
[27:58] where are you
[28:00] going oh yeah he
[28:08] does well the Lord will provide like you
[28:11] said
[28:12] amen so we um to get into this book of
[28:18] First
[28:19] Kings we see first and second
[28:22] Samuel 1 and 2 Kings they kind of they
[28:25] go in order uh first and second Kings
[28:28] like first and 2 Samuel it was probably
[28:30] written as one book and then separated
[28:33] because of the length so we see in 1
[28:37] Samuel we see the rise of the kings in
[28:41] Israel we see the this this man
[28:45] saw that Rose to power and he was King
[28:50] over Israel for 40 years now when we say
[28:53] Israel let me go back a little bit when
[28:55] we say Israel it's this country that's
[28:58] really named after this man named Jacob
[29:01] so Jacob was he was he was Isaac's son
[29:06] who was Abraham's son so we have Abraham
[29:09] God made the promise remember he said
[29:11] that that your seed is going to be like
[29:12] the Sands and the stars of the sky so so
[29:17] Abraham comes and he has his promised
[29:20] son Isaac then Isaac has Jacob Jacob has
[29:26] 12
[29:28] sons and God changes Jacob's name to
[29:33] Israel and we see now his TW sons are
[29:37] the children of Israel and that's how we
[29:40] we talk about the children of Israel and
[29:41] that because it's actually Israel's
[29:44] Israel's Sons so we have these these 12
[29:47] tribes they want a king we know this
[29:51] story from uh the book of Samuel they
[29:54] want a king so God provides this man
[29:57] named Saul This Tall good-looking guy
[30:00] well spoken he was everything that
[30:02] anybody would ever want in a king except
[30:04] he really didn't have the character that
[30:06] he should have so he reigns for 40 years
[30:09] and then this young man named David who
[30:13] has all the character you could ever put
[30:15] into a human being he then ascends to
[30:19] the throne he's anointed to be king by
[30:21] the prophet Samuel he ascends to the
[30:23] throne and he reigns for 40 years so we
[30:27] have 40 years with Saul we have 40 years
[30:30] with David and now we're going to get in
[30:34] when we start in First Kings we're going
[30:36] to see that David is old and stricken in
[30:39] years can you guess how old he
[30:43] was he was old and stricken in he was
[30:49] 70 he had a hard life David did he
[30:53] Aaron's
[30:54] laughing he he he was he was like 140
[30:58] years packed into 70 years with David he
[31:01] he really struggled and he he was a man
[31:03] of war he had a lot of battles and and
[31:07] um he he gets he gets old and and his
[31:10] time is
[31:12] short so we see
[31:15] David and he's his life is fading so his
[31:22] oldest remaining son which is this guy
[31:26] named adonijah
[31:29] adonijah um sees that that David's
[31:32] getting old and he starts
[31:37] preparing to be king because really if
[31:40] you look at it he's probably the
[31:41] rightful Heir because he's the oldest so
[31:45] we see that that's how the book of first
[31:47] king starts it goes through really some
[31:51] some amazing times we have the the
[31:55] you're going to have Solomon come and
[31:56] then you're going to have have Solomon's
[31:58] son rabam he's going to Reign and then
[32:00] he's going to just everything's going to
[32:02] be a train wreck under him so the the
[32:05] the um kingdom is going to split it's
[32:07] going to be it's going to split into 10
[32:09] tribes in the north and two tribes in
[32:11] the South uh the book of first king
[32:14] covers um I think about uh
[32:18] eight Kings of Israel in the north and
[32:23] Four Kings of Israel in the South and if
[32:26] you're ever playing Ria or you're
[32:28] talking about Kings Israel after Solomon
[32:34] never had a good King every single one
[32:37] of them was evil now
[32:40] Judah after it split again we have
[32:43] Israel and Judah now Judah did have a
[32:45] few good Kings not many but it did have
[32:47] a few so in First Kings we're going to
[32:49] cover
[32:51] jeroboam who um was the man that took
[32:54] over the
[32:56] North naab basa Ela zimra
[33:02] omry and Ahab and aesia a little bit at
[33:06] the end so those are the ones those are
[33:08] the kings that we're going to talk about
[33:10] I'm not going to mention them all
[33:11] because we don't have enough time but
[33:13] those are the the kings that the the
[33:16] first king covers for for the North and
[33:18] then the South we have rabam which is
[33:21] Solomon's son abijah ASA and Jehoshaphat
[33:25] now two of these Kings of Judah did
[33:29] right in the eyes of the Lord that's ASA
[33:31] and Jehoshaphat very very very important
[33:35] too in this first book of Kings is we
[33:38] see the first temple built the first
[33:42] temple of God so if you're talking to a
[33:45] scholar you'll hear well that was the
[33:47] first temple period and this is the
[33:49] second temple period well this first
[33:51] temple period is what is going to start
[33:54] right here in the book of first king
[33:57] Kings and that's when the first temple
[33:58] is
[33:59] built um another thing that we see in
[34:02] this book of Kings is we see the rise of
[34:07] these mysterious men called
[34:10] prophets and usually we we saw this
[34:15] prophet Samuel arise right at the end of
[34:17] the Book of Judges there some say he was
[34:19] the last judge a Great and Mighty
[34:22] prophet in the Lord and he started a
[34:25] trend really
[34:27] that we see these men rise up and many
[34:31] times we don't know where they came from
[34:33] we don't know how they were raised they
[34:35] just show up and then they a lot of
[34:38] times they just disappear we don't even
[34:40] see their death so we have after Samuel
[34:43] we have this man named Nathan who we'll
[34:44] talk about in First Kings and then it
[34:47] goes on and these prophets that rise up
[34:53] we have the kings that have all this
[34:55] power and all of this might as far as
[34:57] the armies and they have all this wealth
[34:59] wealth and then we have these single men
[35:03] of God that show up and they are
[35:08] awesome they come in and they can just
[35:11] bring the whole country to its knees and
[35:15] they they'll just and you'll see with
[35:17] Elijah that comes on the scene they are
[35:20] the ones that really wield the power
[35:22] because they're hearing from
[35:25] Jehovah so the book of Kings we have the
[35:30] death of David again I said David was
[35:32] well stricken in years and he was 70
[35:36] cousin Jonathan good to see you back
[35:37] there too my friend God bless you we see
[35:40] David he was well stricken in years 70
[35:43] years old and his son
[35:47] adonijah as I said he sees his dad
[35:49] getting old so he's really the oldest so
[35:53] he figures that I'm going to be king so
[35:55] he starts making arrangements ments to
[35:58] take over the kingship so he has these
[36:03] 50 men they run before him and he's on
[36:05] this mule and they they they go through
[36:09] all the pump and he's got the men of God
[36:12] here and the men of War there and
[36:15] they're going to anoint this adonijah
[36:18] king and the only thing is he doesn't
[36:21] invite a couple people to the party he
[36:23] doesn't invite his dad David he doesn't
[36:27] invite his little brother
[36:30] Solomon and he doesn't invite the
[36:32] prophet
[36:34] Nathan so he's gonna have so so right
[36:37] there you can see he's probably scheming
[36:39] a little bit so the word gets back to
[36:43] Nathan the
[36:45] prophet hey adonijah is about to Crown
[36:49] himself King so then Nathan tells baath
[36:53] Sheba and bath Sheba has the the king's
[36:57] ear his wife so she goes and tells David
[37:01] and she says hey she says well she
[37:03] approaches him reverently but she says
[37:05] you said that
[37:08] Solomon was going to be king now brother
[37:11] L we don't have that yet but that's
[37:14] mentioned over in the next couple books
[37:17] in Chronicles that they they quote that
[37:21] so in First Kings it comes first and you
[37:23] kind of read that it's like well where
[37:24] did he promise this but it is promised
[37:27] and it's that promise comes in the book
[37:30] of um I I believe it's 1
[37:32] Chronicles
[37:34] so so David what David does is he said
[37:37] okay well let's have our own ceremony so
[37:40] David and David is the King David Gets
[37:44] Nathan the prophet and he gets some of
[37:46] the other priests and and he gets the
[37:49] powerful men and they
[37:54] bring um Solomon and he gets gets to
[37:56] ride on David's mule and they anoint
[38:00] Solomon King so
[38:04] adonijah he sees this he gets somebody
[38:07] comes and tells him this and he's like
[38:09] oh man I messed up because back then
[38:13] there's no Grace you
[38:16] were dead when you when you did when you
[38:21] did that type of thing so
[38:24] adonijah he
[38:27] he's he says well you know this is this
[38:29] is this is really bad what I've done so
[38:31] now we have Solomon the king and
[38:34] adonijah
[38:35] fears what what was going to happen and
[38:38] we can start reading in First Kings
[38:39] chapter 1 verse 50 brother Jeremy we can
[38:42] start right there so
[38:46] adonijah feared because of Solomon and
[38:50] arose and went and caught hold on the
[38:53] horns of the
[38:55] Altar and and it was told Solomon saying
[38:57] behold adonijah fearth the King fearth
[39:00] King Solomon for Lo he hath caught a
[39:03] hold on the of the horns of the altar
[39:05] saying let King Solomon swear unto me
[39:07] today that he will not slay his servant
[39:10] with the sword so Solomon said if he
[39:14] will show himself a worthy man there
[39:16] shall not a hair of him fall to the
[39:18] Earth but if wickedness shall be found
[39:21] in him he shall die so King Solomon sent
[39:25] and they brought him down from the Altar
[39:27] and he came and bowed himself to King
[39:30] Solomon and Solomon said unto him go to
[39:34] your
[39:35] house so we think he's safe here but
[39:39] later on adonijah makes another move
[39:41] that was interpreted by Solomon as a
[39:44] threat to his throne and adonijah
[39:47] Solomon wasn't as kind then that was the
[39:50] end of
[39:51] adonijah that happens later on so as
[39:56] this
[39:57] kingdom is is continuing David who was
[40:02] very very
[40:04] wise David sees that his son is
[40:08] Young Solomon was probably about 20
[40:10] years old from all that I could gather
[40:15] maybe between 20 and 24 so Solomon's
[40:18] pretty young he doesn't have a whole lot
[40:20] of
[40:21] experience in doing these things so what
[40:24] David does is David brings Solomon down
[40:27] and he starts giving him some
[40:29] instructions on what to do and something
[40:33] very strange happens brother Josiah what
[40:36] he does is he said okay here's here's
[40:39] the people that you need to
[40:41] kill so they start with these political
[40:45] assassinations and the best that I could
[40:49] see were some of these the these people
[40:51] that that David tells him to kill David
[40:56] being the strong man that he was and the
[41:00] strong
[41:01] leader he could
[41:03] handle these people but with the young
[41:07] man Solomon he might not have been able
[41:09] to handle this and he may have lost the
[41:11] Kingdom so he gives some instructions on
[41:16] who to kill one of those was
[41:19] David's General this ruthless man who
[41:22] was very powerful very shrewd and a very
[41:25] very great warrior the one who killed
[41:28] David's son absum this man named
[41:32] joab he tells he tells Solomon he says
[41:38] kill him he says this he says don't let
[41:40] his head stay stay on his
[41:42] shoulders or something like that that
[41:43] means his gray hair by the way it sounds
[41:46] like something different but it's
[41:47] basically it's basically the gray hair
[41:51] so he he takes joab and joab gets put
[41:54] out of his misery and then there's this
[41:57] other
[41:58] guy this this guy David do you remember
[42:02] when David was kicked out of Jerusalem
[42:04] by his own son absum so David
[42:09] leaves and he's fleeing for his life
[42:12] leaves
[42:13] Jerusalem and he's going along and
[42:15] there's this man this cranky guy named
[42:18] shimi and shimi starts starts basically
[42:23] berading David because of Saul how King
[42:27] Saul had died and he's blaming David for
[42:29] this and he's like throwing rocks at
[42:33] David and David's men like you're not
[42:36] doing that to my king pulls out his
[42:39] sword and he says I'm not going to let
[42:41] his head stay on his shoulders David's
[42:44] like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa he's like
[42:46] listen God told him to do that so just
[42:51] let him alone so now David's on his now
[42:54] that happened years and years ago
[42:55] David's on on his deathbed and he's like
[42:57] oh yeah take out that shimi guy
[43:00] too but shimi was a schemer too and he
[43:06] had issues and he would have probably
[43:08] also been a problem for
[43:10] Solomon so when we get to chapter three
[43:14] now
[43:15] Solomon is
[43:18] King and he immediately begins making
[43:23] mistakes so let's turn to First Kings
[43:25] chapter 3 verse
[43:28] 1 brother Jeremy I didn't give him a
[43:31] list of um scriptures so he's going to
[43:34] be trying to follow with
[43:36] me um so it won't be quite as fast as it
[43:40] usually is for so First Kings chapter
[43:42] 3:1 and Solomon made an affinity now
[43:45] Affinity is just a treaty or an
[43:47] alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt now
[43:51] David's gone David had passed away with
[43:54] Pharaoh king of Egypt and took Pharaoh's
[43:57] daughter and brought her into the city
[44:00] of David until he had made an end of
[44:01] building his own house and the house of
[44:03] the Lord and the wall of Jerusalem round
[44:06] about so immediately Solomon starts
[44:09] running around with these worldly girls
[44:12] and we see that that's his problem for
[44:15] his whole life especially as he gets
[44:19] older now Solomon Reigns
[44:23] really this is the greatest time
[44:26] in the history of
[44:28] Israel they have
[44:31] tremendous wealth they have great armies
[44:37] and really nobody's messing with Israel
[44:40] right now because they are such a
[44:41] powerful nation and we see that Solomon
[44:47] when he comes in he starts when he
[44:50] starts making these mistakes and if you
[44:53] haven't learned anything from our Bible
[44:56] study from Genesis now until first Kings
[44:59] you see that all of these Great Men of
[45:02] God make
[45:03] mistakes every single one of them they
[45:07] all of them fail and so often we try to
[45:10] put this this Perfection on to these
[45:14] brothers and you can't do it because no
[45:17] one in the Bible was ever perfect except
[45:21] for
[45:22] one the Bible is very careful
[45:26] to record mistakes in all of the
[45:29] Servants of God I remember I told a
[45:31] brother that one time and he about came
[45:34] over the table at me saying you did not
[45:38] these prophets never make mistakes I was
[45:40] like brother it's just written in here
[45:43] I'm sorry I can't change the Bible it's
[45:45] right here it's not that you're in
[45:47] saying that you're not lessening brother
[45:49] you're not lessening their influence or
[45:51] lessening these these people they are
[45:54] real genuine men of God that have flaws
[45:59] but then God can use them to me it makes
[46:02] it just beautiful it makes it to where
[46:04] they're great examples to me because I
[46:06] look at all my failures and all of my
[46:09] weaknesses and then yet I can still be a
[46:11] man of
[46:12] God and Solomon was one he had
[46:15] weaknesses but he also had some very
[46:17] very good
[46:19] strengths verse
[46:23] number verse number two
[46:27] only the people sacrificed in high
[46:29] places because there was no h house
[46:31] built un until the name unto the name of
[46:34] the Lord until those days and Solomon
[46:37] loved the Lord see that's what separates
[46:40] him Solomon Lov the Lord and even in his
[46:44] mistakes he
[46:46] still put the people
[46:49] first Solomon loved the Lord walking in
[46:51] the statutes of David his father only he
[46:54] sacrificed and burnt incense in high
[46:56] places so immediately we see this
[46:58] weakness of idolatry creeping up and we
[47:01] found out later that this idolatry in
[47:04] Solomon comes from these women that he's
[47:06] marrying he had a thousand wives by the
[47:09] way I don't know how he did that um so
[47:12] he worshiped in these high places but
[47:15] soon Solomon's going to get a higher
[47:18] Revelation and he's going to make a
[47:20] change watch this and the King went to
[47:24] gibian to sacrifice there for that was
[47:27] the great high place a thousand burnt
[47:30] offerings did Solomon offer upon that
[47:33] altar in gibian the Lord appeared to
[47:36] Solomon in a Dream by night and God said
[47:40] ask what I shall give thee love this
[47:44] part and Solomon said thou has showed
[47:48] unto thy servant David my father great
[47:50] Mercy according as he walked before thee
[47:52] in truth and in righteousness and in
[47:55] upright ESS of heart with thee and thou
[47:57] has kept him this great kindness that
[48:02] thou has given him a son to sit on his
[48:05] throne as it is this day
[48:07] so Solomon saying listen dad's so
[48:11] proud that I'm I'm the king
[48:14] now so thank you Lord for doing this for
[48:17] my dad I know it was really important to
[48:20] him and now oh Lord my God thou Hast
[48:24] made thy servant King instead of David
[48:27] my father and I am but a little child I
[48:32] know not how to go in how to go out or
[48:35] come in and thy servant is in the midst
[48:38] of thy people which thou H has chosen a
[48:41] great people that cannot be numbered nor
[48:43] counted for the
[48:45] multitude give therefore thy servant an
[48:50] understanding heart to judge thy people
[48:54] look at the love and the burden for his
[48:57] people manifested in Solomon what a
[49:00] beautiful thing that he just said that I
[49:03] might
[49:04] discern between good and
[49:07] bad for who is able to judge this thy so
[49:12] great people and the speech pleased the
[49:15] Lord that Solomon asked this
[49:18] thing and God said unto him because thou
[49:21] Hast asked this thing and H has not
[49:23] asked for a long life
[49:27] excuse me and has not asked for a long
[49:33] life neither H has asked for riches for
[49:36] thyself neither nor H has asked the life
[49:39] of thine enemies but has asked for thy
[49:41] self understanding to discern judgment
[49:45] behold I have done according to thy
[49:47] words lo I have given thee a wise and
[49:50] understanding heart God speaking to
[49:52] Solomon so that there was none like thee
[49:55] before thee neither after thee shall any
[49:58] arise like unto thee look at the wisdom
[50:00] that this man's going to get we always
[50:03] hear about the wisdom of Solomon well
[50:06] here is where it comes from right here
[50:08] and I have also given thee that which
[50:11] thou H has not asked both riches and
[50:14] honor so that there shall not be any
[50:18] among the Kings like unto thee all thy
[50:21] days and if thou wil walk in my ways to
[50:26] keep my statutes and my Commandments as
[50:28] thy father David did walk then I will
[50:32] lengthen thy days so Solomon wakes up
[50:36] from this dream and went to
[50:39] Jerusalem now and stood before the Ark
[50:42] of the
[50:43] Covenant and offered up offerings before
[50:46] the Lord do you see how this changed
[50:49] him notice that when he had the dream it
[50:53] shook him up and he went back to the
[50:55] proper ER place of worshiping so now
[50:58] that Solomon has this
[51:00] wisdom that God has given him now all of
[51:04] a sudden in the Bible we see this wisdom
[51:06] tested so there's these two
[51:09] prostitutes that come to Solon they got
[51:12] a dead baby and they got a alive baby
[51:15] and they come before the king and the
[51:18] one
[51:19] says this woman over here she laid down
[51:23] and rolled over and smothered her baby
[51:27] so she gets up in the middle of the
[51:28] night she takes this dead baby and she
[51:31] puts it in in the bed where my baby was
[51:35] and takes my live baby and puts it in
[51:37] her bed and now she's got my son and I
[51:43] have her dead
[51:45] baby and the other woman says no no no
[51:49] no that's wrong her she smothered her
[51:53] baby and she just now wants my baby
[51:56] because she wants to have a
[51:58] child so Solomon's looking there and he
[52:01] sees these two
[52:03] women and he sees the one live baby and
[52:05] the one dead baby and he says okay he
[52:09] says let's do this he said soldier come
[52:12] here take your sword cut the baby in
[52:15] half give half to this one half to that
[52:17] one the one that the mother of the baby
[52:20] falls down and says no no no no no no no
[52:22] don't do it give it to the other one the
[52:25] one that was lying said that's good and
[52:28] in her heart I was like yeah now we both
[52:31] have I don't have to be jealous we'll
[52:32] both have our dead babies but the one
[52:35] that loved the child said no give it to
[52:37] the other
[52:38] one
[52:40] Solomon then in chapter 3:
[52:46] 27 Solomon says this then the king
[52:49] answered and said give her the living
[52:53] child and in no wise slay it she is the
[52:56] mother thereof and all Israel heard of
[52:59] the Judgment which the king had judged
[53:01] and they feared the king for they saw
[53:04] that the wisdom of of God was in him to
[53:07] do judgment and then the fame of Solomon
[53:10] Solomon's wisdom just went out and it
[53:12] came and people started coming from
[53:14] different countries and from all over
[53:16] just to hear this wisdom of Solomon and
[53:20] this time in Israel was just a great
[53:23] time of peace and prosperity and the
[53:27] Bible shows that how much gold they had
[53:29] and how much silver and how how much
[53:32] wealth that they had and how many
[53:33] chariots and and all of the armies and
[53:36] there was no fighting it was a wonderful
[53:41] time so
[53:43] Solomon he must have looked around and
[53:45] he was just probably thankful to think
[53:48] about what his dad David had gone
[53:50] through there was no fighting his kids
[53:53] weren't rising up against each other
[53:55] this was a good time then
[53:58] Solomon remembers the instructions his
[54:00] father David had given him to build this
[54:04] Temple to Worship the Lord so Solomon
[54:07] begins construction on the temple of God
[54:09] and the Bible goes into great detail of
[54:12] the building of both the temple and
[54:14] Solomon's own house in um chapter 6:
[54:18] 11 speaking of the temple God tells
[54:21] Solomon this and the word of the Lord
[54:24] came to solom saying concerning this
[54:26] house which Thou Art building if thou
[54:29] will walk in my statutes and execute my
[54:32] judgments and keep my Commandments to
[54:35] walk in them then will I perform my word
[54:39] with thee which I spake unto David thy
[54:41] father and I will dwell among the
[54:43] children of Israel and will not forsake
[54:45] the people so Solomon built the house
[54:48] the temple and finished it and even in
[54:52] these few
[54:54] verses this type of statement is
[54:57] repeated over and over in the Old
[54:59] Testament if you will keep my
[55:02] Commandments and you will walk in them
[55:05] then I will bless you over from the Book
[55:09] of Judges we see and we see in 1 Samuel
[55:13] 2 Samuel we see now in in Kings and we
[55:16] see that same Spirit upon the Lord
[55:21] Jesus a couple thousand years later over
[55:25] well over a thousand years later Jesus
[55:28] says if you love me keep my
[55:31] commandments so look at the similarity
[55:33] in Christ and Jehovah of the Old
[55:36] Testament they are exactly the same yes
[55:41] so in chapter 8 Solomon gets all the
[55:43] people together so they finish the
[55:45] temple Solomon gets all the people and
[55:47] by the way it's very very detailed even
[55:49] even Solomon's own personal house talks
[55:52] about all the the the different
[55:55] designs and all that that are in there
[55:57] so Solomon gets all the people together
[55:59] to dedicate the temple and he spreads
[56:02] out his
[56:04] arms and he starts to pray to the Lord
[56:07] and he asks blessings upon himself and
[56:10] upon the
[56:11] people please read chapter 28 when you
[56:16] have time it's it's all mostly um
[56:20] Solomon's Prayer chapter 8 but I'll
[56:24] start in verse
[56:26] 33 and a he asks as he's praying he says
[56:30] this about the temple chapter 8 verse 33
[56:34] when thy People
[56:37] Israel be smitten down before the
[56:41] enemy because they have sinned against
[56:44] thee and shall turn again to thee and
[56:46] confess thy name and pray and make
[56:48] supplication unto thee in this house
[56:51] then hear thou in heaven and forgive the
[56:54] sin of thy People Israel and bring them
[56:57] again unto the land which thou gavest un
[57:00] their
[57:00] fathers When Heaven is shut up and
[57:03] there's no rain because they have sinned
[57:04] against thee if they pray just pray
[57:07] towards this place if they pray towards
[57:10] this place and confess thy name and turn
[57:12] from their sin when thou Afflicted them
[57:15] then hear thou in heaven and forgive the
[57:19] sin of thy servants and of thy People
[57:22] Israel that thou teach them the good way
[57:25] wherein they should walk and give rain
[57:27] upon the land which thou Hast given to
[57:30] thy people for an inheritance if there
[57:33] be in the land famine if there be
[57:34] pestilence blasting mildew Locust or
[57:38] caterpillar if there be in if their
[57:41] enemy besiege them in the land of their
[57:43] cities whatsoever plague whatsoever
[57:45] sickness there be what prayer and
[57:47] supplication soever be made by any man
[57:50] or by all thy People Israel which shall
[57:53] know every man the plague of his own
[57:56] heart and spread forth his hands towards
[58:00] this
[58:02] house then hear thou in
[58:05] heaven thy dwelling place and forgive
[58:09] and do and give to every man according
[58:11] to his
[58:13] ways whose heart thou
[58:15] knowest for thou even thou only knowest
[58:19] the heart of all the children of men
[58:22] that they may fear thee all the days
[58:24] that they live in the land which thou
[58:26] gavest unto our fathers he goes on to
[58:29] pray that if they're far away and they
[58:32] just face towards this Temple when they
[58:34] are praying that the Lord will hear them
[58:38] then Solomon finishes PR his prayer and
[58:41] it doesn't say this in First Kings but
[58:45] it does in 2 Chronicles chapter 7 that
[58:48] the fire and the glory of the Lord comes
[58:52] down and consumes the offering that was
[58:56] in the temple at that
[58:58] time as I said this is a great time to
[59:04] be a Jew it is just a tremendously
[59:08] prosperous prosperous
[59:10] time so Solomon his W his wisdom
[59:15] continues to spread the Queen of Sheba
[59:17] brings great wealth to make an offering
[59:20] to Solomon and he gives her all the
[59:22] answers to every question that she had
[59:24] on her heart
[59:25] and then we see in chapter
[59:29] 11 that all that leads up to chapter 11
[59:32] we see a
[59:35] shift let's go to chapter 11 verse
[59:39] one but King
[59:41] Solomon loved many strange women
[59:44] together with the daughter of pharaoh
[59:46] that was the one that we talked about
[59:48] before that he married women of of the
[59:50] moabites ammonites zidonians
[59:54] and
[59:55] Hittites of the Nations
[59:58] concerning which the Lord said unto the
[1:00:00] children of Israel you shall not go into
[1:00:04] them he had for God had forbidden
[1:00:07] this neither th shall they come unto you
[1:00:10] for surely they will turn away your
[1:00:12] heart after their gods Solomon clave
[1:00:15] unto these in in love so it this is
[1:00:18] exactly what happens God told him don't
[1:00:22] he told all the people don't go to these
[1:00:24] Canaan night because your hearts will be
[1:00:27] turned from God to idols and it's
[1:00:29] exactly what happens to
[1:00:31] Solomon and he had 700 wives princesses
[1:00:35] and 300 concubines and his wives turned
[1:00:38] away his
[1:00:40] heart for it came to pass when Solomon
[1:00:42] was old that his wife wives turned away
[1:00:45] his heart after other gods and his heart
[1:00:47] was not perfect with the Lord his God as
[1:00:50] was the heart of David his father for
[1:00:52] Solomon went after Ash Sho the goddess
[1:00:56] of the zidonians and now after milom the
[1:01:01] abomination of the
[1:01:24] Hill that is before Jerusalem and from
[1:01:26] moik the abomination of the children of
[1:01:29] Ammon and likewise did he for all his
[1:01:31] strange wives which burnt incense and
[1:01:34] sacrifice under their gods and the Lord
[1:01:37] was very was angry with Solomon because
[1:01:40] his heart was turned from the Lord God
[1:01:42] of Israel which had appeared unto him
[1:01:45] twice and had commanded him concerning
[1:01:47] this thing that he should not go after
[1:01:50] other gods but he kept not that which
[1:01:53] the Lord commanded he didn't remember he
[1:01:56] didn't keep which what the Lord told him
[1:01:58] he didn't hold it dear to his heart
[1:02:01] wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon for
[1:02:03] as much as this is done of thee and thou
[1:02:06] Hast not kept my Covenant and my
[1:02:08] statutes which I have commanded Thee I
[1:02:10] will surely Ren the Kingdom from me I'll
[1:02:13] take it from you and I will give it to
[1:02:15] your
[1:02:16] servant not withstanding in thy days I
[1:02:20] will not do it for David thy father's
[1:02:23] sake but I will Rend it out of the hand
[1:02:24] of thy
[1:02:26] son very very important thing that the
[1:02:31] Lord just told him and we think
[1:02:34] about being a dad being a
[1:02:38] mom how important is it that we live a
[1:02:44] holy life look at how Solomon benefited
[1:02:48] from his father David this man of
[1:02:51] impeccable character and how he was a
[1:02:53] man after God's own heart and David did
[1:02:55] his best all the time to do what God had
[1:02:57] commanded him and now David's son
[1:03:00] Solomon God says I would take it from
[1:03:02] you but because of your
[1:03:05] dad I'm not going to take it from you
[1:03:08] you're going to live out your life as
[1:03:10] king and your
[1:03:13] son is going to be the one that loses
[1:03:16] the
[1:03:20] Kingdom so as I said this chapter 11 is
[1:03:23] a transition
[1:03:25] from the book transition from Solomon to
[1:03:29] now we're going to have many other kings
[1:03:32] Solomon really he was an enigma to
[1:03:34] me he wasn't really it's like he wasn't
[1:03:37] really good with the women because he
[1:03:40] had really bad bad uh discernment as far
[1:03:42] as the girls but then he goes and he
[1:03:44] writes The Book of
[1:03:46] Proverbs and he writes Song of Solomon
[1:03:48] where it's warning about this Venom that
[1:03:51] is in these women and how dangerous they
[1:03:53] are and here's PR prbs talking about how
[1:03:55] to be a good dad and how to be a good
[1:03:57] parent and and to stay away from these
[1:03:58] girls and then Solomon it's
[1:04:01] like but you didn't do it here but the
[1:04:06] anointing I assume I know was on solom
[1:04:10] and as he was writing those things and
[1:04:12] it just shows that he was a human but
[1:04:16] his heart I really believe all the way
[1:04:18] until the end Solomon's heart was right
[1:04:21] he just he made a mistake and he got off
[1:04:25] so now we see these two men rise to
[1:04:28] power we have Solomon's
[1:04:32] son
[1:04:34] rabo and he inherits the kingdom Solomon
[1:04:39] dies and now reabo inherits the Kingdom
[1:04:42] so
[1:04:43] he starts
[1:04:46] ruling and the people of Israel remember
[1:04:53] it's all one country it's kind of like
[1:04:55] brother brandom said that the um Israel
[1:04:58] types the United States well if you look
[1:05:01] at Israel it's like here's 12 States all
[1:05:05] together you look at the United States
[1:05:06] it started with 13 states all together
[1:05:10] everyone just working
[1:05:13] together and we see rabam and
[1:05:18] rabam is going
[1:05:21] to he gets this group of people and this
[1:05:24] this other man who's a great warrior
[1:05:26] named jeroboam he comes with the people
[1:05:29] they come to to reabo and they say hey
[1:05:32] can you give us a break on the taxes
[1:05:35] it's killing us we need a tax
[1:05:37] cut and so rabam says okay well let me
[1:05:42] think about it for a few days and then
[1:05:44] then I'll get back to you so
[1:05:48] rabam
[1:05:50] goes to the ones that were with Solomon
[1:05:53] his dad and he asks them he says hey
[1:05:56] they want a tax cut what should I do and
[1:06:00] these seasoned
[1:06:02] wise advisor
[1:06:05] say give it to them deal gently with
[1:06:09] them deal more gently than your dad did
[1:06:13] and then ri's like okay so then riabal
[1:06:16] goes to his friends that he had promoted
[1:06:18] that he grew up with and he says how
[1:06:20] about what do you think should should we
[1:06:23] should I give a tax cut or should I put
[1:06:28] more taxes on him so then his
[1:06:31] buddies who don't have the experience
[1:06:33] they told him to be harder on the people
[1:06:36] collect more taxes for them assert your
[1:06:39] assert your authority over them
[1:06:42] harshly then they tell
[1:06:45] him say this my father laid you with a
[1:06:48] heavy yoke and I will add to your yoke
[1:06:52] my father has chastised you with whips
[1:06:56] but I will chastise you with
[1:07:00] scorpions how would you like
[1:07:02] that got this new
[1:07:05] leader and sometimes I'll bring it right
[1:07:09] down here sometimes we can apply it to
[1:07:11] ourselves I've heard Hey Brother green
[1:07:14] wasn't hard enough on the church you
[1:07:16] need to close up the fellowship hall you
[1:07:18] need to get rid of these unbelievers you
[1:07:20] need to enforce this dress code tell
[1:07:22] these women their Jey bells and get rid
[1:07:24] of these
[1:07:25] unbelievers that didn't work before and
[1:07:27] it doesn't work
[1:07:29] now and you see why the kingdom was
[1:07:33] divided you know you see there it's like
[1:07:37] huh Solomon had word from the Lord this
[1:07:41] is how you do this or David had word
[1:07:44] from the Lord this is how you do it and
[1:07:47] this he provided good leadership this
[1:07:50] man riab boam had very very bad
[1:07:52] leadership bad he didn't
[1:07:57] understand First Kings 12 1212 says this
[1:08:01] so jeroboam and all the people came to
[1:08:03] rabam the third day as the king had
[1:08:06] appointed saying come to me again the
[1:08:09] third day and the King answered the
[1:08:11] people roughly and forsook the old men's
[1:08:14] counsel that they gave him and spake to
[1:08:17] them after the counsil of the young men
[1:08:19] saying my father made your yoke heavy
[1:08:21] and I will add to your yoke my my father
[1:08:24] also chastised you with whips but I will
[1:08:26] chastise you with scorpions wherefore
[1:08:29] the king hearkened not unto the people
[1:08:31] for the cause was from the
[1:08:35] Lord that they might perform this saying
[1:08:38] which the Lord spake by aijah the the
[1:08:40] shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat
[1:08:44] it's referring back to a prophecy this
[1:08:45] man ahijah had
[1:08:47] made
[1:08:49] before so when all Israel saw that the
[1:08:52] king had hearkened not unto them the
[1:08:54] people answered the king saying what
[1:08:56] portion have we in David neither have we
[1:08:59] inheritance in the son of Jesse to your
[1:09:01] tents o Israel now see to thine own
[1:09:04] house David So Israel departed unto
[1:09:07] their tents so David was from the tribe
[1:09:10] of
[1:09:12] Judah as was rabam obviously because he
[1:09:15] was the grandson of David and soon after
[1:09:18] jeroboam was anointed king of Israel and
[1:09:22] we see the split because of the
[1:09:26] foolishness of the leadership in in
[1:09:31] riab he was too
[1:09:34] harsh he didn't take into account the
[1:09:38] suffering of the
[1:09:40] people so now what does jeroboam do
[1:09:44] jeroboam makes makes a fool out of
[1:09:46] himself so what he does is he see these
[1:09:49] these 10 tribes up in the north so what
[1:09:52] he does is he says okay well
[1:09:54] well I don't want them to come down to
[1:09:57] the temple that Solomon's built because
[1:10:00] then that we'll put it into not modern
[1:10:02] perspective then they might start start
[1:10:03] going to church
[1:10:05] there and then I won't have them in my
[1:10:08] church so let's build a couple more
[1:10:10] temples here we'll build build one way
[1:10:12] up in the north in Dan and then we'll be
[1:10:14] build one down here in the
[1:10:17] middle and then you can go worship there
[1:10:20] and not go to the temple that God had
[1:10:23] made
[1:10:24] do you remember Solomon saying that they
[1:10:26] would just look to this Temple and
[1:10:28] messed up all God's plan right there and
[1:10:30] then what does he do he even puts c a
[1:10:32] calf in there for them to worship at
[1:10:35] what a
[1:10:36] mess he ruined it all and God
[1:10:40] didn't God didn't take that
[1:10:44] lightly so
[1:10:46] then in Chapter 13 very interesting
[1:10:50] story happens so after jeroboam builds
[1:10:53] these two these two
[1:10:57] temples God is going to come down on him
[1:11:00] so he sends a man of God to jeroboam to
[1:11:04] prophesy of a king named
[1:11:07] Josiah that would come and
[1:11:11] condemn jeroboam's sins so jeroboam
[1:11:15] hears the prophecy and he reaches out
[1:11:18] against this man of God and his hand
[1:11:20] dries up and the altar itself splits in
[1:11:24] half and King jeroboam cries out for
[1:11:27] mercy and his hand is restored and the
[1:11:29] King says hey why don't you jerob says
[1:11:32] why don't you come home with me and hang
[1:11:34] out at my house for a while and I'll
[1:11:36] give you a reward for all this that
[1:11:37] you've
[1:11:40] done first Kings chapter 13:8 and the
[1:11:44] man of God said unto the king if thou
[1:11:47] will give me half of thine house I will
[1:11:50] not go in with thee neither will I eat
[1:11:52] bread nor drink water in this place for
[1:11:56] such for so it was charged me by the
[1:11:59] word of the Lord saying eat no bread nor
[1:12:01] drink water nor turn again by the same
[1:12:04] way that thou camest so he went another
[1:12:08] way and returned not by the way that he
[1:12:12] came to
[1:12:14] bethl so then the man of God meets a
[1:12:18] prophet and the
[1:12:22] prophet says to him remember he just got
[1:12:26] instruction from the Lord don't stop
[1:12:28] don't go anywhere else go to jobon
[1:12:31] prophesy and then don't eat or drink
[1:12:33] don't stay just
[1:12:35] leave First Kings chap 13:16 says this
[1:12:39] and he said I may not return with thee
[1:12:42] nor go in with thee neither will I eat
[1:12:45] bread nor drink water with thee in this
[1:12:47] place for it was said to me by the word
[1:12:50] of the Lord Thou shalt eat nor bread nor
[1:12:53] drink water there nor turn again to go
[1:12:56] by the way that thou camest and he said
[1:13:00] unto him I am a prophet also as Thou Art
[1:13:04] and the angel spake unto me by the word
[1:13:06] of the Lord saying bring him back with
[1:13:09] thee into thine house that he may eat
[1:13:11] bread and drink water but he lied to
[1:13:15] him so he went back with him and did eat
[1:13:18] bread in his house and drank water and
[1:13:22] it came to pass that as they sat at the
[1:13:24] table that the word of the Lord came
[1:13:25] unto the prophet that brought him back
[1:13:28] and he cried unto the man of God that
[1:13:30] came from Judah saying thus sayeth the
[1:13:33] Lord for as much as thou has disobeyed
[1:13:36] the mouth of the Lord and Hast not kept
[1:13:38] the Commandment which the Lord thy God
[1:13:41] commanded
[1:13:42] thee but camest back and Hast eaten
[1:13:45] bread and drunk water with the place of
[1:13:48] which the Lord did say to to thee eat no
[1:13:51] bread and drink no water thy carcass
[1:13:54] shall not come under the supplier of thy
[1:13:57] fathers and it and it came to pass after
[1:14:00] he had eaten bread and after he had
[1:14:02] drunk that he saddled for him the ass to
[1:14:05] wit for the prophet whom he had brought
[1:14:08] back and when he was gone a lion met him
[1:14:12] by the way and slew him and his carcass
[1:14:14] was cast in the way and the ass stood by
[1:14:16] it and the lion also stood by the
[1:14:22] carcass very
[1:14:24] very odd
[1:14:27] story brother Jeremy if you could put
[1:14:29] that quote up for me brother Bram says
[1:14:32] this now
[1:14:35] look speaking of this story that I just
[1:14:39] read now look some of these this going
[1:14:43] on
[1:14:47] around you always seek the face of God
[1:14:51] and I don't care who tells you anything
[1:14:53] contrary to what God tells you don't you
[1:14:56] believe
[1:14:57] it and you obey God will you do it I
[1:15:03] don't care who he is how righteous he is
[1:15:06] how much of a pastor he is how much of a
[1:15:08] Preacher whether he's a prophet he may
[1:15:11] be sent of God a real true ordained
[1:15:15] prophet of God but if God tells you
[1:15:17] something contrary to that Prophet don't
[1:15:20] you believe the prophet you believe God
[1:15:24] how many believe that's
[1:15:26] true read First Kings
[1:15:28] 13 a young Prophet went down and
[1:15:31] prophesied against all bethl there and
[1:15:33] done some Miracles and the Lord said
[1:15:35] don't you eat nor drink and come back
[1:15:38] another way from the way that you went
[1:15:41] in and a real prophet of God went and
[1:15:44] deceived that Prophet is that right
[1:15:47] might as well be truthful he said the
[1:15:50] angel of the Lord met me and told me to
[1:15:52] tell you to come to my house house he
[1:15:54] met me after he met you and the prophet
[1:15:57] believing that Prophet turned and went
[1:16:00] back what happened to him a lion killed
[1:16:02] him is that right the old Prophet wept
[1:16:05] sore over it sure because he listened to
[1:16:08] a man instead of
[1:16:11] God don't heard that hear that tape much
[1:16:14] or that uh quote much so a couple Kings
[1:16:19] reign in
[1:16:21] Judah and and is Israel and and like I
[1:16:24] said it's all bad in Israel there was
[1:16:27] there was one king ASA who was a good
[1:16:29] King in Judah and then we get down back
[1:16:33] to Israel back to this guy named omry
[1:16:37] this King and he was the worst yet of
[1:16:41] the
[1:16:42] Kings First Kings chapter 16 and I'm
[1:16:46] going to get to this man Elijah First
[1:16:49] Kings 16:25 says this but omry rot
[1:16:53] evil in the eyes of the Lord and did
[1:16:55] worse than all that were before him for
[1:16:58] he walked in all the ways of jeroboam
[1:17:01] the son of nebat and in his sin where
[1:17:03] with he made Israel to sin to provoke
[1:17:06] the Lord God of Israel to anger with
[1:17:09] their vanities now the rest of the acts
[1:17:12] of Armory which he did and his might
[1:17:14] that he showed are they not written in
[1:17:16] the book of The Chronicles of the Kings
[1:17:18] of Israel so Army slept with his fathers
[1:17:20] and was buried in Samaria and Ahab his
[1:17:24] son reigned in his
[1:17:26] stead and in the 38 year of Asa king of
[1:17:31] Judah now remember we got two kings
[1:17:32] going on here we have two different
[1:17:33] countries going on here and in the 3
[1:17:36] and8th year of Asa king of Judah began
[1:17:38] Ahab the son of omry to Reign Over
[1:17:41] Israel and Ahab the son of Amry reigned
[1:17:44] over Israel in Samaria 2 and2 years and
[1:17:48] Ahab the son of omry did evil in the
[1:17:51] sight of the Lord above all that were
[1:17:52] before for him and it came to pass as if
[1:17:56] it had been a light thing for him to
[1:17:59] walk in the sins of jeroboam the sons of
[1:18:01] nebat that he took to wife
[1:18:04] Jezebel the daughter of eth Bale King of
[1:18:08] the zodian and went and served Baal and
[1:18:12] worshiped him so marrying Jezebel and
[1:18:16] worshiping baale I assume that she was
[1:18:18] the influence on him that caused him to
[1:18:20] sin in this way so he reared up altar of
[1:18:24] Baal and the in the house of Baal which
[1:18:28] he had built in Samaria and Ahab made a
[1:18:30] Grove and Ahab did more to provoke the
[1:18:33] Lord God of Israel to anger than all the
[1:18:36] kings of Israel that were before
[1:18:39] him and Ahab and
[1:18:42] Jezebel they're the worst of all so God
[1:18:45] raises up one of the greatest prophets
[1:18:47] remember when Isaiah said when the enemy
[1:18:50] comes in like a flood that God will
[1:18:51] raise up a standard against him so a so
[1:18:55] God raises he has the worst King the
[1:18:57] most evil king of Israel and then he
[1:19:00] raises up the greatest Prophet against
[1:19:03] him
[1:19:06] so he shows up really out of nowhere we
[1:19:10] don't know where Elijah came he goes
[1:19:14] right into ahab's face and he says as
[1:19:16] the Lord God Lives before whom I stand
[1:19:19] there shall not be due nor rain these
[1:19:21] years except for by my word that was
[1:19:24] bold to say that to the king he calls
[1:19:28] for this drought then the Lord leads him
[1:19:30] to the mountains by a creek while he's
[1:19:32] at that Creek the Ravens bring him
[1:19:36] food and he has water from the creek and
[1:19:39] the creek dries
[1:19:41] up God sends him to a widow
[1:19:44] woman so she's out she's dying she's
[1:19:48] starving to death because there's a
[1:19:50] famine in the land because of this
[1:19:51] drought that Ahab brought I mean I'm
[1:19:54] sorry that Elijah had brought
[1:19:57] so Elijah goes up to this
[1:20:01] woman and he tells her she's out and
[1:20:04] she's getting some sticks to go cook
[1:20:06] this last handful of meal that she has
[1:20:08] for her son and him and Elijah says
[1:20:13] bring me a drink so she goes
[1:20:16] in and she's giving him a drink of
[1:20:19] water and then he says and bring me some
[1:20:23] food too and she says I don't have any
[1:20:26] we just have I just have enough for just
[1:20:28] to make for this one cake for my son and
[1:20:30] I and then we're going to die so
[1:20:33] Elijah says listen now Elijah he knew
[1:20:38] whatever he touched was
[1:20:40] blessed he knew that God was with him
[1:20:44] wouldn't you love to have that walk with
[1:20:45] the Lord that you know that whatever you
[1:20:48] touch is blessed whatever that whoever
[1:20:51] whoever's house that you you go to is
[1:20:53] blessed because you are such a man of
[1:20:55] God Elijah had that confidence so he
[1:20:59] tells her he says listen he says make me
[1:21:00] one first I don't think that he was
[1:21:03] putting himself above that widow woman I
[1:21:05] think that he had a burden for her right
[1:21:09] so she says Okay and she makes him the
[1:21:13] cake well then he says because the
[1:21:16] barrel of meal won't fail the Cru of oil
[1:21:20] won't fail you'll have it until until
[1:21:24] the time that you finally get your own
[1:21:26] food so she makes she makes Elijah that
[1:21:29] cake then she reaches in that barrel of
[1:21:33] meal and it's there she takes the oil
[1:21:36] and it's there and every time that she
[1:21:38] reached in there every time she poured
[1:21:40] that oil there was always food there so
[1:21:44] then her
[1:21:45] son little baby
[1:21:48] dies and she goes to
[1:21:51] Elijah and she says listen now my son's
[1:21:55] dead and she's carrying him and Elijah
[1:21:58] Elijah's like give me the baby so Elijah
[1:22:01] goes in he knows whatever he touches is
[1:22:02] blessed he takes that baby he lays the
[1:22:05] baby right on his bed he lays his body
[1:22:09] on top of the baby and he cries out to
[1:22:12] the Lord Lord
[1:22:15] restore this
[1:22:18] baby
[1:22:19] then God does
[1:22:27] Elijah says and the woman she looks at
[1:22:31] Elijah he brings back this now living
[1:22:35] baby and the woman says to Elijah now by
[1:22:38] this I know that thou art a man of God
[1:22:41] and the word of the Lord in thy mouth is
[1:22:43] true she could have probably
[1:22:45] said she probably should have said that
[1:22:47] every time she stuck her hand in that
[1:22:50] Barrel but but now she's I guess now
[1:22:54] she's s sure so then and I'll wrap it up
[1:22:57] so then Elijah he goes up on Mount
[1:23:02] Carmel and well he then he he goes and
[1:23:05] he meets
[1:23:06] Ahab and he and Ahab says this you know
[1:23:09] what let's read it first Kings chapter
[1:23:11] 18:1
[1:23:16] 17 and it came to pass when Elijah saw
[1:23:19] when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto
[1:23:21] him art thou he that troubleth Israel
[1:23:25] and he answered I have not troubled
[1:23:27] Israel but thou and thy father's house
[1:23:31] and that have forsaken the Commandments
[1:23:33] of the Lord and thou Hast followed balum
[1:23:37] now remember balum from numbers remember
[1:23:39] what he did he taught Israel to marry
[1:23:41] these Heathen women these Canaanite
[1:23:44] women and here is Ahab with his Idol
[1:23:46] worshipping wife Jezebel now therefore
[1:23:49] send and gather me all Israel under
[1:23:52] Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal
[1:23:54] 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400
[1:23:58] which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab
[1:24:00] sent un all the children of Israel and
[1:24:03] gathered the prophets together under
[1:24:05] Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto all
[1:24:07] the people and said how long halt ye
[1:24:10] between two opinions if the Lord be God
[1:24:12] follow him but if Baal then follow him
[1:24:17] and the people answered him not a word
[1:24:19] and Elijah said unto the people I even I
[1:24:22] only only remain a prophet of the Lord
[1:24:24] but baal's prophets are 450
[1:24:27] men they take the burnt
[1:24:31] offering he gives one to these prophets
[1:24:34] he takes the other they prepare the
[1:24:36] offerings they prepare the altars they
[1:24:38] these these he says which God will
[1:24:40] answer by fire is the real God you know
[1:24:43] the story they cut up the the offering
[1:24:46] there these these prophets are jumping
[1:24:48] up and down they're they're doing
[1:24:50] everything they can they start cutting
[1:24:52] themselves
[1:24:53] a sign of idolatry aide of being a
[1:24:55] heathen they start cutting themselves
[1:24:57] the blood's coming down they're doing
[1:25:00] everything that they can and Elijah is
[1:25:02] sitting there and he's making fun of
[1:25:04] them and then Elijah comes over
[1:25:08] here he says pour
[1:25:11] water on my Sac on my offerings three
[1:25:14] times they pour water on the water is
[1:25:17] around the offering and then the fire
[1:25:19] from God comes and cons assumes Elijah's
[1:25:23] burnt offering then he runs away
[1:25:26] again and the straw really it seems like
[1:25:30] that broke the camel's
[1:25:32] back in chapter 21 was when Ahab and
[1:25:37] Jezebel make this final mistake with
[1:25:40] this man named naboth now AB naboth
[1:25:42] owned a
[1:25:44] Vineyard
[1:25:47] and Ahab wanted his
[1:25:50] Vineyard so he goes to nabbo and he
[1:25:54] saysh hey I want to buy your Vineyard
[1:25:55] nebo's like listen this has been in my
[1:25:56] family for a long time I can't just I
[1:25:58] can't just sell this really it's it's a
[1:26:02] family heirloom so Ahab was used to
[1:26:05] getting everything that he wants so he's
[1:26:08] upset about this he goes home and he's
[1:26:10] he's sulking over this Jezebel comes in
[1:26:13] and she's like what's wrong with
[1:26:15] you Ahab says well I want this Vineyard
[1:26:19] and he won't sell it to me and she's
[1:26:21] like hey aren't you the king
[1:26:24] so she writes this
[1:26:26] letter and sends it to her
[1:26:30] people and they frame nabbo and say that
[1:26:34] he was blaspheming now
[1:26:37] listen
[1:26:39] this is a religious thing you can see
[1:26:42] these people are still
[1:26:44] Jews these people are still following
[1:26:46] what they think is the laws of God so
[1:26:49] they end up taking naboth and they Stone
[1:26:51] him kill him Jezebel says okay you can
[1:26:54] have your Vineyard
[1:26:58] now Ahab takes a
[1:27:02] Vineyard and says this first Kings
[1:27:06] 2118 arise and
[1:27:12] go arise and go down this is arise and
[1:27:15] go down to meet Ahab he's talking God is
[1:27:18] talking to Elijah his Prophet arise and
[1:27:20] go down to meet Ahab king of Israel
[1:27:23] which is in Samaria behold he is in the
[1:27:25] vineyard of naboth whether he has gone
[1:27:28] down to possess it possess it and thou
[1:27:31] shalt speak unto him saying thus sayeth
[1:27:34] the Lord hast thou killed and also taken
[1:27:37] possession and thou shalt speak unto him
[1:27:40] saying thus sayeth the Lord in the place
[1:27:42] where dogs lick the blood of naboth
[1:27:46] shall dogs lick thy blood even
[1:27:49] thine skip to verse 23 and of Jezebel
[1:27:53] also spake the Lord saying the dogs
[1:27:55] shall eat Jezebel by the wall of jezrael
[1:27:58] him that dieth of Ahab in the city the
[1:28:01] dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the
[1:28:04] field the fowls of the air shall
[1:28:07] eat so then in closing um the musicians
[1:28:12] can prepare then in closing in chapter
[1:28:16] 22 Ahab goes to battle and I just
[1:28:20] ministered on this a few weeks ago Ahab
[1:28:22] goes to battle he's struck by an
[1:28:26] arrow and he
[1:28:30] dies and his blood goes out into this
[1:28:36] Chariot so remember the prophecy that
[1:28:39] the dogs were going to lick ahab's blood
[1:28:42] so now ahab's dead the Chariots here
[1:28:46] it's full of blood so this guy that that
[1:28:50] cleans the Chariots he gets some water
[1:28:53] and he's cleaning out the Chariot the
[1:28:55] blood is washing out it's pulling on the
[1:28:58] ground and the dogs come and they start
[1:29:01] licking up the blood wow to fulfill the
[1:29:05] prophecy that Elijah had made that this
[1:29:08] Ahab was going to die and that the dogs
[1:29:11] were going to lick his
[1:29:14] blood now and that closes the first book
[1:29:19] of
[1:29:20] Kings but it's still leaves the prophecy
[1:29:23] of
[1:29:24] Jezebel and it's better that the dogs
[1:29:27] are going to eat her says that the dogs
[1:29:30] are going to lick ahab's blood but then
[1:29:34] the dogs are going to eat Jezebel so
[1:29:37] brother Lyall you got to tell us what
[1:29:39] happens in Second Kings and how Jezebel
[1:29:43] gets
[1:29:44] consumed and it's a it's pretty
[1:29:47] rough brothers and sisters the first
[1:29:50] book of Kings amen is is
[1:29:53] tremendous go back quickly to what I
[1:29:58] said about this
[1:30:00] reabo and how he had made a
[1:30:04] mistake and was harsh with the
[1:30:08] people and I also want to say that I
[1:30:12] believe the Lord led me very
[1:30:15] specifically when I came to the Tucson
[1:30:19] Tabernacle be kind don't be harsh don't
[1:30:23] be
[1:30:24] condemning and I have received as I just
[1:30:28] said quite a bit of criticism for that
[1:30:32] but I'm doing my best and I'm using I'm
[1:30:36] using the wisdom I believe the Lord has
[1:30:38] placed in me to do things right and I'm
[1:30:42] reading this Bible and applying and
[1:30:44] doing my best to apply into my life
