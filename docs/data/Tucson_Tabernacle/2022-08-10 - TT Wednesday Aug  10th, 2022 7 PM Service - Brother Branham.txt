he's the God of Peace we're going to listen to the the last portion of the tape that we've been listening to on Wednesday's Christ is the mystery of God revealed so there's 47 minutes or so left on that but that's less than an hour and I've I had read a scripture that I enjoyed and I thought maybe I could just read the scripture so let's just stand and and just just this one scripture is in Colossians and I'm not going to preach I'm just going to read this scripture so don't worry but this is Colossians 1 and 9. and this is a prayer this talks about how Paul prayed for these people that he loved and here we love one another and we say we're praying for each other but we pray for each other like this do we pray with with faith for things like this and expectations for things like this so just listen to the words of this prayer and I think you'll be blessed it says for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding so this is a seven-fold prayer in the first is that we might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that's really good you could pray that brother Jeremy let him be filled with the knowledge of your will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that's the expectations we should have for one another verse 10 that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing for the Lyle I pray that you walk worthy of the Lord and all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God sister Rachel I pray you'd be strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness for the David I pray that you'd give thanks unto the father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in life who has delivered us from the power of Darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins amen so God bless you pray for each other pray for me and let's as we let's pray together and then we'll we'll play this tape father have your way we just Commit This service to you Lord give us ears to hear our hearts to receive father let us expect great things for you the god of great things Lord so often hidden from from the eyes of the wise and prudent Lord but revealed in Simplicity Lord we believe that in in this man Christ Jesus all the mystery of God was hid and revealed Lord reveal that mystery in US to us father to us that we could be your children Lord we could walk worthy of of you and all pleasing fruitful in every good work father we thank you in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated let's let's just play this uh if you look just barely on this in just a little bit it'll be all right I don't want you to miss it I I got to I got to take this tape now I'm going to start this far one more great remark I want to make if I have to move over a little of it now notice listen to this now is the greatness now is where we want to watch remember in the last days will exactly go back and vindicate the first date leave Adam and Eve husband and wife no sin life than the fall notice notice closely notice what caused it Lucifer Lucifer is doing now as he did at the first time just as the kingdom of the Gentiles was brought in the King Nebuchadnezzar Vindicated a gentile Race by a prophet who can interpret unknown time vision dreams and has come down to the Gentiles without anything just needs a purchase an iron and so forth and in defeat it goes out the same way again the Gentile Kingdom notice Lucifer in the last days is doing as he did it first what did Lucifer do the first thing that Lucifer done to separate the fellowship of God in man he wanted to build him a United Kingdom a greater splendor and seemingly more cultured a greater Kingdom than Michael Christ had you got him now if you miss it just hold up your hand I'll say it again see the Lucifer at the beginning his purpose and heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven than Christ had is that right more beautiful more Splinter than a kingdom of Christ do you think we'll have automobiles in the Millennium for the airplane see what Lucifer's doing now the big fancy it the intellectual s and are doing the very same thing Gathering themselves together to do the same thing see they are gathering and denominating themselves each one trying to beat the other and now they got some rough Splinter they don't know what to do but to United with the Catholic Church Lucifer again building a bigger Kingdom to push out people that don't believe in denominations and even take their Church feelings and make storerooms and the pastors of such has no rights at all and a man that is a godsend man would never stand in the denomination that you're hearing this or seeing it because he's got enough to go out and look at it I think I don't say that critically I said truthfully to see that reveal notice Lucifer is doing the same thing can you see it the devil doing the same thing building up a hybrid Church a hybrid a hybrid member however by knowledge instead of the word an intellectual man instead of born again man building an intellectual Kingdom that'll outside Christ little bitty pop see what is it that did that fallen angels angels who listen to Lucifer instead of Christ who they once belong to is that right now listen close Fallen Angels what kind of angel Luther Wesley Catholic Pentecostal who can't knock their first estate like the Angels did and it's fell into organizations like Lucifer's Main and nicaea and what have they done organize the great economical Association of ministers to make an image into the beasts of the Bible said and building a Christian economy that will close the doors of this church see Lucifer at his work I'm trying to bring you the three-fold Revelation or mystery of God what did they do sold out to reasonings of wisdom and education like Eve did Fallen Angels in Wesley was a man of God but what party Four Angels got into it what was the Angels first create beings of God that fell for losers wisdom Lucifer's wisdom and she wants to become fallen angels and organizations from man of God who's went forth to establish truths in the Earth before that truth could go wrong and proximate and get onto the real revelation of Christ Fallen Angels come in and took it over and made denominations out of it that's the reason the Revelation all the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded [Applause] amen how you see it what they left off if Luther would have went on it had been here if Wesley would have went on if Pentecost went around what would they done now there's only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there is nothing else can fall and now the economical world is set up such a regime that their Cathedral denomination no rub nothing else follow it you're either in it or you're not in it amen the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit is just writing into Christ's light fruit bringing forth the same melanous as sweetness In The Same Spirit that he had in him hope you see it see I try to put too much in one day but where are you out so they sold out to reasons sold out to reasonings of denomination if I just belong to this the the mayor goes to this church right if I can be a Methodist or a presbyterian just look where they've gone now I've just explained them limbs are pruned walked or dead they're not connected with Christ anymore they bring you the same mind they're not connected with it but they're they're like a citrus fruit any citrus fruit will live on a citrus tree but it'll bring its own fruit you put a grapefruit in a orange tree it'll live by the orange tree but it rained for grapefruit you put a lemon in there it's the citrus fruit he'll bring forth an old style lemon but it's living off of life that's what the nominations are doing by under the name of the church it's a bride that's the original tree the original Spirit the Revelation comes from Christ not the denomination Christ daughters what did our nation try to exalt itself like Lucifer they so call themselves The Church the bride which they are in Revelation 17 is this folk of the false bride above Christ's Little Flock the bride Lucifer thanks and exalts himself above the humble word of God's truth by the knowledge of the revelation and has placed himself by a seminary education and theology until they have got themselves up and if you don't belong in their group then you are a outwasher like Lucifer did in the beginning say to the people just exactly what Lucifer said to Eve surely God will receive us we feed the poor that's good surely you will receive us we are a great denomination we are a beautiful Church well look at our great buildings look at our great membership we stand in the minions surely God will not turn that group down the same thing that Cain did brought in the pretty fruits from the ground that he had killed and toiled and worked and brought in the fruits and rejected the humble blood of the Lamb right God have mercy that man and women will not think I'm saying this to exalt something or some personal revelation or something I'm only telling you the truth amen can't you see what they're doing I speak it loud and harsh but you've got to drive an ill to the clinches if it's going to do any good right so you'll see it now saying to the people surely you mean to tell me that our Greek Catholic church has stood all this time our great Methodist North look at our forefathers but they broke the word of the Lord and Eve was God's one of his she was a byproduct of Adam and because she doubted one word of God's word it did it and here's Lucifer at his job again today I remember the Antichrist is not communism the Antichrist is so close like the real thing to see the very elected if it was possible Jesus said Matthew 24 the elected if it was possible Lucifer again Lucifer again is breaking God's unity in Man by his his is limited the word of God to his reasonings what he thinks is right what he thinks he breaks the word of God and same thing he did in the days of Jesus and Jesus said you by your Traditions has made the word of God of no effect and the denominations by their organized uh intellectual reasons has made God's word of no effect upon the people right they just can't see it then they say where is the god of the Bible he's right here he's the Bible that's what he is notice now Lucifer comes into communists and Bridge the unity of God to man just like you did in Eden by great Temptations of promises of self-power and exaltations well you might become a bishop of you to stay with us you might come to District presbyter why would you go to something like that see that's Pentecostal the Catholic and so forth see a great false promise to man to receive power outside the word and promise of God you receive power when the Holy Ghost has come upon you not when you become a bishop or a deacon or whatever you are amen but Lucifer's at his job again does this church understand that raise your hand so I'll see you all right I won't stay with it any longer then breaking from apart from the word of God see he did the same at Nastia Rome you know what Constantine give him you went through the church ages he get they didn't have nothing but just Christ and they're set in the low buildings anywhere they could on hard Rock floor you know that if you talk to nicia Council in the Preen I see a counseling and I see a fathers and so forth in the history of the church they have nothing but when they have this Council and inducted some of the Roman paganism into Christianity and for holy man and Bishops and so forth and popes and all this kind of nonsense what did Constantine give him I asked anything Logan to tell me he gave him property he'd give them freedom and all that they wanted and they swapped the word of God for the wisdom and culture of man and that's the same thing Lucifer did then he did in the Garden of Eden and they died right there the Pentecostal Church died at Nasir Rome but to be resurrected in the bride during the last days notice Lucifer comes in Conan like he did a dance and by Temptations and false promises of power out apart from the word of God he did the same and I see a Rome he's doing the same today at the World Council of ecumenical churches let's all unite together the Pope says I want all my economical Brethren out there to unite with me we're alone that's right into organizations you are one but that has nothing to do with the bride of Christ amen not a thing brother you'll never wash her anything like that now it is Promised in the last days that the original faith in the same to be restored to the children of God at the time of the Bride tree Malachi 4. God said before the world burns up as far behold I send to you Elijah the prophet he will restore the faith of the children now that wasn't the first Elijah to come no no now we don't teach your Elijah's Mantle and Elijah's blankets and all those things like that we just teach the word of God that's what he said see we got all kind of a Elijah this and Elijah that which is nonsense amen that's we know that that's I'm not talking about that and you it's spiritual minded to understand see as the late hours getting late and can't put it all on this tape of course now the promise in the last days now if the Jesus said and and Matthew I believe the 11th chapter of the sixth chapter and no it's 11th chapter and about the sixth verse when John sent his disciples over there to see if he really was the one Jesus said who did you go out to see a a win the Reed is shaken by the winds did you go out to see such and such he said or did you go to see a prophet he said more than a prophet John was more than a prophet he was the messenger of the Covenant yes and he said if you can receive it this is he which is spoke of the prophets I'll send my message here before my face now that's Malachi 3 not Malachi 4 because the Elisha that was the common Malachi for their Earth was to be burnt with a fervent Heat and the righteous was to walk out in the Millennium upon the ashes of the wicked so it is not that one see now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at first in John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also then the head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself to his promised word for the last days he promised this in the right State now if you're spiritual you're catch it then we can see that the married supper is at hand have I never see you again remember the married supper is at hand and then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued in the great Millennium the taking up of the church to the destroying of the wicked and the world under the Sixth seal to be purified by volcanic and take all the corruption and sin of the world and to mold her out again and bring forth a bright New Millennium for the age that is to come when we see all these great truthful revelation God in Christ Christ in the church the kingdom coming Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden and the representation of Christ and his bride and then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise praise be to God now by the revelation of the threefold mystery the secret and by the personal Vindicated word by his original headship not say well glory to God we shout hallelujah we saying that he did I'm a missionary I've been seven times frankly over the world see I sing heathens devils and everything else dancing Shout I've seen all kinds of fleshly manifestations that's carnal but I'm talking about the headship of Christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's questions [Applause] we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price and raising up the head of the body the devil can't stand it that's the reason these economical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now but there are much reasons howling the way he is his wickedness has been this scheme has been uncovered father risen resurrected Christ in the hardship over his body [Applause] you think I'm the final step or not we got the devil's answer [Applause] it was the Christ the word living in me not my idea it's his power not my idea it's his word he promised it here it is he said it would be here here it is we got his answer Christ is risen and has paid the price for our Redemption what God in Christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that in the blood might come to life and the flesh be redeemed that the god in this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day you see it oh man when you gotta stop notice it I am We Stand Justified in the presence of God as a drop of ink dropping into a uh a tub full of bleach you'll never find the stain of the ink no more it went somewhere he'll never come back again and when man is truly redeemed that predestinated seat that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished it's gone and separated it's dropped into the ache of the of the blood of Jesus Christ and it's never to be remembered God forgets it and he stands in the Son and Daughter of God in the presence of God [Applause] how we are the sons of God now we will be we are now we're ready [Applause] God's opindicated himself God proves himself to his peace in this day how did the headship is here amen amen Christ there is a lord is here in the same power of his resurrection [Applause] manifesting himself there's the devil's answer that's the reason when this man said you're a drop dead the other day sitting here we can say come back live towards the holy spirit said so that's why I could do that little baby Hunter Mexico have been dead for about 15 hours when the vision comes they call it back to that right I said let the little baby live and the baby that the doctors over a statement died at nine o'clock that morning at 11 o'clock that night come back to Life's living today what is it good people the headship and the body has become one unit it's God manifested in his people [Applause] that's reason the husband and wife's no longer tween their wand church is one Christian you got it to God even better his name is Jesus the anointed the reason is called Jesus he is the anointed his anointed Body of Christ [Applause] proving manifesting God like that body did and that body redeemed ever this these bodies yeah and through there God works is threefold manifestation going to the kingdom rierson paid the price we're redeemed God's proved it Vindicated this thing and we stand justified in Christ before him because he cannot Place judgment or he's already judged that body and we're trying to pull it up here it is [Applause] there [Music] to see them yeah there you are there's the body of Christ Living stand in redeemed redeem oh my justified in his sight why are we justifying we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we'll approve of his victory amen when we see him coming down to living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us and we're already potentially arise because we've raised from debt debt unbelief in his word from the Nation Creeds of the Eternal world of the Eternal God which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday day and forever and then the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they're a husband and wife flesh obvious flesh word of his word life of his life Spirit of his Spirit see amen how do you know it Bears the same record same fruit same word see manifest Christ stay in life same God Same Spirit same word same book amen same signs things that I do for you also oh Hallelujah man notice the Vindicated word in his body is his very Victory and the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his Spirit went to hell and preached the souls in prison is that right his flesh only died then he raised it up again and quickened it Quicken means Made Alive his flesh for Trump his body and that's the word it's being laid dead for years let the grassy began to come into reformation and now is she standing up on her feet I wish I had time to go back into Ezekiel and pull out them gobones and show you he said Can these bones again he said prophets and how can prophecy come only to the prophet it's a word [Applause] and City's skin come upon him and it stood up on Mighty heart music in a March towards [Music] glory to God that's him that's him the victory The Ransom of the Lord shall come to Zion and the joy all these holy mountains nothing hurt or shall destroy he proves his Resurrection Life there as he vindicates himself she the bride is independent from all others she's an independent woman [Applause] a Great Speckled Bird that's different from all others you remember the Bible on that the great speckle bird but she had his name she had his life for the how did this speckle the bird they were both White and then they pull the head off of one bird and drain the blood out upon the other bird and the other bird was speckled with the red blood and it flopped its wings like this and the blood cried holy holy holy has obeyed the ground so Christ the dead meat put his blood his blood from his life into US sprayed carries blood crying holy holy holy unto the Lord it's an odd looking bird sure is but she the Bride is a is identified by him and she's independent from all others keep the audience to her as long as you both live get the owner to him the word no no adultery not one sign of the nomination a sign of creed Love Don't Treat all the words on crisis Solid Rock I Stand All Over the grounds of sinking fans said Eddie Pruitt that's a Christ the word he was the word he is the word and the church becomes word by him making her part of him and that's the word again personally identified by him his property owned his property alone she is Redeemed by him through him for him and for him alone that's right then what the devil is falling about there's been revealed we're in a dangerous time remember the scripture says when these things begin to happen time is no more she's fading away we see the manifestation earthquake seven thousand kill the other day earthquakes and divers places on set fearful sights in the skies pillars of fire like floating around like flying saucers they don't know what it is they don't have any idea did you notice the angels that come down and investigated Sodom before Sodom was destroyed you remember that there was a bunch of them come down three of them one of them stayed with Abraham you remember that they were lights from heaven it came down and investigating judgment ones look where they're all found around the Pentagon and things to find them that's a world judgment Sodom and there's one represented will be represented amongst the churches be Christ himself of indicating himself see sights on the air in the heavens above and signs in the Earth certainly identified oh the devil's Talent about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her a home they don't have the answer when Jesus Come What in those Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out by he's still alone and his church stands alone amen amen she's not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the
