Lord and and if I say something wrong Lord may it be heard correctly Lord we just commit the remainder of this evening to you and we're excited to look into this book of your Prophet Zephaniah we thank you in Jesus name amen while we're standing and for our opening verses I'd like to read a short account of two incidents in the life of King Josiah both are found in 2 Chronicles chapter 34 and occurred in the time of Zephaniah the first is the finding the discovery of the book of the law it's six years into Josiah's reforms destroying the Pagan places of worship smashing idols and and so forth it says now in the 18th year of Josiah's Reign so he's aged 26 now about 623 BC when he had purged the land and the house he sent chiffon the son of aaliah and Messiah the governor of the city of Jerusalem and joah the son of jehoahaz the recorder to repair the house of the Lord his God continuing the reforms he started six years earlier and now restoring Solomon's Temple skipping to verse 14 and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord hilia the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses skipping to verse 18 then chiffon The Scribe told the King Josiah saying hilaya the priest hath given me a book and chiffon read it before the king and what's Josiah's reaction to the words he hears for the very first time it came to pass when King Josiah had heard the words of the law that he rent his clothes a way of expressing extreme grief in the culture of the time and Josiah commanded hilaya and ayim the son of sheon and abdon the son of Micah and chiffon The Scribe and aasia a servant of the Kings saying go inquire of the Lord for me and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the Wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the Lord to do all that is written in this book the second incident is the prophecy of Hala and Heather will be helping you with this assuming the microphone is ready there and H and hilka and they that King Josiah had appointed went to holda the prophetess not to Nahum not to Zephaniah not to Jeremiah all of whom were in Judah and active at that time holda the wife of shalam the son of tikva the son of hazra Keeper of the temple or priest's wardrobe now she dwelt in Jerusalem in Mish the new quarter the second part only the King James version uses the word college and they spake to her to that effect they relayed the king's inquiry and she answered them thus saith the Lord God of Israel tell ye the man that sent you to me thus saith the Lord behold I will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants there of even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah because they have forsaken me and have burned incense under other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched and as for the king of Judah Josiah who sent you to inquire of the Lord so shall you say unto him thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning The Words which thou has heard because thine heart was tender and thou did humble thyself before God when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and humblest thyself before me and did ren thy clothes and weep before me I have even heard thee also Josiah sayeth the Lord behold I will gather thee to thy fathers and thou sh sh be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same so they brought the king word again please be seated the portions we just read set the stage for the destruction of Jerusalem and Judah and provide background for our lesson this evening technical difficulties oops more technical difficulties is it's at the slide of Minor Prophets I'll I'll just go ahead and use your imagination that that slide is up there Zephaniah got it thank you Zephaniah is the ninth among the group we call Minor Prophets the Hebrew Bible does not call them minor it simply refers to them as the Dozen or the 12 reminds me of Jesus and the disciples brother brandom sometimes referring to Christians as Messiah ETS zephaniah's prophecies are focused on Judah in particular and the world of their oppressors in general this is also the third and last of the Minor Prophets to specifically mention Nineveh the capital of the ancient Assyrian Empire which we encountered in the books of Jonah and nahm the book is short has only three chapters this is one breakdown I found of the topics covered in its prophecies the the background image represents Solomon's Temple there are a total of only 53 verses in the entire book so we'll read it all this evening before we do of course we need context let's start with geography the map shows the approximate area of the Kingdom Under of Judah under Josiah it's inviolet the capital Jerusalem is circled on the map you can see it includes much of the former Northern Kingdom of Israel at the time of Josiah the Assyrians controlled the surrounding area including Egypt the whole entire area you see is under ass Syrian control Josiah's kingdom is is allowed to sort of be a kingdom uh but it's a vassal state so they're paying tribute taxes extortion to Assyria well when did this happen to get the time of the prophecy let's start reading the introduction zephani introduces himself in the contents of his writing in the very first verse the word of the Lord which came unto Zephaniah which means treasured of God the son of Kushi the son of galiah the son of amariah the son of Hezekiah and the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah Zephaniah tells us his lineage it's the longest lineage goes back more Generations is listed by any of the other prophets it may have been clear to his peers not so much to us many claim that the Hezekiah noted as a former king of Israel Josiah's grandfather it certainly is possible it it could be the difficulty is that his father is named after a tribe or people of Africa this implies that Galah married an African woman and named his son or one of his Sons Kushi after her tribe it's certainly possible of Uncertain likelihood when did all this happen what is clear is that he prophesied in the reign of Josiah the K we read about in our opening verses many place a time of his prophecy just after the book was found and read to the king in 623 BC the the 18th year of his Reign but zephaniah's angry denunciation of the widespread idolatry in Judah seems to indicate that it was before or early in the period when Josiah's reforms were initiated which began in 631 BC the 12th year of his Reign at the age of 20 either way zephaniah's prophecy is an expansion of and in complete agreement with the words of the propheus holda which we read in our opening verses so we place his prophecy is most likely between 632 and 6 22 BC less than 25 years from the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem 40 to 45 years before the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple I've indicated the likely range with the yellow line for those of you that have the quiz this is an on it all the references I found agree that Zephaniah was probably a priest and that he was in Jerusalem and for interest the only place I can find brother brandham even mentioning Zephaniah is when he was looking for something in Zachariah and accidentally turned to Zephaniah and so oh this is an old Bible I'm not going to find Zachariah in Zephaniah and flip the pages end of the entire references of all the recorded sermons of brother Bram of the name or the book of Zephaniah so we're treading new ground here let's continue on the next portion of the book is the coming judgment on Judah the book the book immediately gets right to the point I will utterly consume all things from off the land sayeth the Lord I will consume man and Beast I will consume the fowls of the Heaven and the fishes of the Sea and the stumbling blocks with the wicked and I will cut off man from off the land sayeth the Lord this speaks of a general destruction or judgment it's a shocking apocalyptic Vision it may be literal it is more likely a literary device to get people's attention telling them to prepare for an unimaginable catastrophe that the Lord is really really angry like finding out your child did something really bad and responding I'm going to kill that kid when I get home I'm reminded of a time when I was in Washington DC in that area in the spring of 2004 was in a in a in a building with a at a satellite company we were working on three small satellites a group of us had designed these we're going to hand carry them through Moscow and onto Kazakhstan for launch on a Russian rocket I was head down and focused when a dear friend of mine a NASA scientist told me he had recently purchased an automobile a Mini Cooper S and asked me why would you like to see my car now I said either no no or no not right now he was hurt by my response and I later realized when I got my head out of what I was focused on that while what he said was would you like to see my mini what he was saying was Lyle I want to show you my new car please come have a look admire it be sure to congratulate me on acquiring it I heard and responded to what he said I I completely missed what he was saying I didn't read between the lines so to speak it's my usual nerd clutz mode well and Zephaniah if everything is gone if humanity is eradicated why would the Lord then go on to speak of Juda and the people of Jerusalem if it's meant to be literal and the event sequential rest of the book doesn't seem to make sense at least to me but if on the other hand it's an expression of God's extreme disp pleasure showing us his perspective on the subsequent events described it makes perfect sense at least to me let's move on the prophecy then goes on to a more specific area in time I will also stretch out my hand upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and I will cut off the remnant of Bal from this place and the name of the Kims with the priests Ms are priests of idol worship the Lord is going to wipe out not only the priests of false gods but also the priests that are merging worship of the Lord with idol worship the kind of syncretism blending cultural religion with worship of the Lord that Paul admonishes us against in some of his letters trying to make it more comfortable within the local culture or religions I remember when Heather and I uh went to New Zealand for the first time in 1972 and and we went to a a a place I don't remember where it was but there was it was a Maui area and there was a church there and we went and saw the church and as you come up the church is all these carvings of all these demons and all these and the pulpit is held up by these strange creatures and I'm thinking wow they're they're trying to make Christianity palatable to this group of people but they're not taking out what needs to be taken out by Christianity so uh this sort of thing goes on all the time that was just a very graphic example to me it sort of jumped out well Zephaniah goes on and them that worship the host of Heaven upon the housetops the creation rather than the Creator evidence exists that worship of Astral deities the Sun the moon the stars was common in Judah in the seventh century BC and them that worship and that swear by the Lord and that also swear by m or moak or their Idol King and them that are turned back from the Lord lost their faith backslid we might say in our day and those that have not sought the Lord nor inquired for him agnostics and atheists as well are those that just don't care can't be bothered lukewarm notice this isn't the prophet reporting it's the prophet quoting the words of the Lord Jerusalem and its Temple were to be a beacon to the world instead they were crushed by the world worship of the Lord became that of religion rather than relationship from the head rather than from the heart it became polluted a cultural thing a tradition we must be careful as individuals that we don't go down that same path remember Psalm 1 from our previous lesson on neum avoid the counsel of the ungodly goes on the day of the Lord is near Zephaniah now tells of the day of the Lord understand that the word translated day can mean the daylight part of a day an entire day an unspecified period of time an era sometimes I hear well Day means a thousand years and it can but it can mean a lot of things so the day of the Lord is a period of time it's a time of judgment that goes far beyond Judah as we'll see verse seven hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord God for the day of the Lord is at hand for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice he hath bid Sanctified his guests and it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord's sacrifice that I will punish the princes and the King's children children and all such as are clothed with strange apparel that's a curious phrase he has initial focus on the leaders that mislead the clothing refers to foreign clothes in other words they're no longer wearing the fringed garments as the Lord commanded through Moses I numbers 15 I'll read it in the NIV speak to the Israelites and say to them throughout the generations to come you are to make tassel on the corners of your garments with a blue cord on each tassel you will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the commands of the Lord that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by chasing after the lust of your own hearts and eyes all such as are clothed with strange apparel returning to Zephaniah and the same day also I will punish those that leap on hop over the threshold that's another strange one it's a way that worshippers passed into or out of the Temple of an idol they didn't step on the threshold they hopped over it it's kind of like when I was a kid oh step on a crack break your mother's back you know Superstition kind of stuff but that's how they entered and exited those places and that's what he's talking about so he's talking about Idol worshippers which fill their Master's houses with violence and deceit those that kill and steal threaten and plunder and it shall come to pass in that day saeth the Lord that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate that's one of the Gates of Jerusalem and an howling from the second district and a great crashing from the hills all over Jerusalem and the surrounding territory howl the inhabitants of mesh another District of Jerusalem for all the merchant people are cut down all they that bear silver are cut off it shall come to pass at that time that I will search Jerusalem with candles I will painstakingly and search through every nook and cranny You Can't Hide and punish the men that are settled on their leaves kicking back another translation says that are stagnant in spirit that say in their heart the Lord will not do good neither will he do evil God doesn't care he doesn't do anything therefore their goods shall become a booty and their houses a desolation they also shall build houses but not inhabit them and they shall plant Vineyards but not drink the wine thereof the great day of the Lord is near it is near and hasteth greatly even the voice of the day of the Lord the mighty man shall cry there bitterly he goes on to Des described this time that day is a day of Wrath a day of trouble and distress a day of wastesson a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and thick Darkness a day of the trumpet an alarm against the fence cities and against the high Towers I read that and I remembered as a kid I guess that's what I was when I was 16 I guess that's still a kid and Tucson we had just arrived here and I noticed on Saturday mornings in midm morning there were Air Raid Sirens the entire city you couldn't be anywhere in the City of Tucson and not hear that s in midm morning Saturday it was they were practicing for when the Russians were going to bomb the place it was the Cold War and of course what they were telling the Russians is uh if you want to hit us do it at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday when we're practicing our alarms because everybody knew if it's midday Saturday ignore the alarm right so he's talking about people blowing the trumpet sounding the alarm there's danger coming and I will bring to stress upon men and they shall walk like Blind Men why because they have sinned against the Lord and their blood shall be poured out as dust and their flesh as the dung neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land wow but there's an invitation chapter 2 gather yourselves together yay gather together oh Nation not desired devoid of shame in your present State before the decree bring forth before the day passes the CHF before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you he's saying don't wait for this act now this phrase off Yahweh the Lord's anger occurs twice in this sentence it's EMP emphasized he's saying here's what you must do and don't wait do it now seek ye the Lord all ye Meek The Humble saintly gentle of the earth which have wrought his judgment performed his commands practice his ordinances act in compliance with his revealed will seek righteousness seek meekness it may be that you shall be hid and the day of the Lord's anger just like the Lord said he would seek with candles in every nook and cranny so the meek are told to seek the Lord before the day his wrath Falls he knows among the meek The Humble are those that have lived righteously judgment on judah's enemies here we see the Lord's anger is not only directed against the unrepentant of Judah but also on those that were judah's enemies he has not forgotten that even in his anger with Judah they are still the descendants of Abram through which he intends the nations of the earth to be blessed he will keep his promise to Abram in Genesis 12 he told him I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great Thou shalt be a blessing I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed Judah you've been misbehaving that doesn't give people the right to curse you to punish you to persecute you the rest of this chapter we'll see that the Lord is staying true to his promise to Abram so many centuries later verse four for Gaza shall be forsaken ashalon a desolation they shall drive out ashdot at the Noonday and erron shall be rooted up woe unto the inhabitants of the Sea Coast the nation of the carites the word of the Lord is against you oh Canaan the land of the Philistines I will even destroy thee that there shall be no inhabitant here's a a map of Israel I've circled the four cities that are mentioned in this prophecy these are four of the five Royal cities of the Philistines the fifth one not mentioned is gath I've also marked the boundary of the modern day Gaza Strip you can see that there is a lot of today in the words of zephaniah's Prophecy in the Sea Coast shall be dwellings and cottages for Shepherds and folds for flocks and the co G shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah and they shall feed thereup and the houses of ashalon shall they lie down in the evening for the Lord their God shall visit them and turn away their captivity restore their prosperity I have heard the reproach the insults the taunts of Moab and the revilings of the children of Aman whereby they have reproached they have mocked my people and magnified themselves against their border made made arrogant threats against their territory therefore as I live saith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel surely Moab shall be as Sodom and the children of Aman as Gomorrah even the breeding of nettles and salt pits and a Perpetual desolation the residue of my people shall spoil shall plunder them and the remnant of my people shall possess them the the background in the image of this slide is the Jordanian the Aman side of the Dead Sea you can see the salt there if you can see the barren Hills if you look up an aerial view of Jordan you'll see it's mostly desolate a Barren desert a Perpetual desolation to among this desolation shall they have earned for their pride because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts the Lord will be terrible unto them for he will famish all the gods of the earth men shall worship Him everyone from his place even all the Isles of the Heathen do you see yourself there isn't that what we're doing today worshiping the god of Israel all across the globe it's why we're here tonight we're fulfilling part of a prophecy of Zephaniah the Ethiopians also so ye shall be slain by my sword and again remembering Assyria and Nineveh he will stretch out his hand against the North and Destroy Assyria and will make Nineveh a desolation and dry like a Wilderness and now he describes the Desolation flocks shall lie down in the midst of her all the beasts of the Nations both the comat and the bitan shall Lodge in the upper lentil of it their voice shall sing in the Windows desolation shall be in the thresholds for he shall uncover the cedar work remember the thresholds the idol temples this is the rejoicing City that dwelt carelessly that said in her heart I am and there is none beside me how she has become a desolation a place for beasts to lie down and everyone that passes by her shall hiss and wag his hand I showed you this slide when we talked about knam we just read that flocks would lie down in the midst of Nineveh and they due to this day 2600 years after its destruction I've indicated the places where crops grow you can see the Green in there animals Graves and what was once the greatest city of Assyria Nineveh judgment on Jerusalem and the Nations the third and final chapter of the prophecy speaks of Jerusalem and all the nations first in judgment then in Hope and remember Nations it's not speaking about Portugal and Spain and Mexico and the United States and Cuba and Venezuela and Australia it's talking about peoples it's talking about ethnicities it's talking about Clans it's not talking about modern political borders as we think of Nations first in judgment then in Hope Zephaniah 3:1 woe to what sorrow awaits her that is filthy and polluted to the oppressing city he's speaking of Jerusalem she obeyed not the voice she received not correction she trusted not in the Lord she Drew not near to her God her princes within her are roaring Lions her judges are evening wolves they gnaw not at the bones till tomorrow they're so hungry so ravenous so so destructive they don't even leave the bones to chew on in the morning her prophets are light Reckless insolent and treacherous persons her priests have polluted the sanctuary they have done violence to the law substituting their words for Gods the just Lord is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity every morning do he bring his judgment to light he faileth not but the unjust knoweth no shame Here I Am the Lord is saying but you ignore and avoid me to your hurt I have cut off the Nations their towers are desolate I made their streets waste that none passes by their cities are destroyed so there is no man there is no inhabitant they lie and Silent ruin I said surely thou wil fear me thou Willl respect me that will honor me that will receive instruction remember Psalms 19 James 1 from last Sunday so their dwellings should not be cut off howsoever I punish them but they Rose early and corrupted all their doings therefore wait ye upon me sayeth the Lord until the day that I Rise up to the prey for my determination is to gather the Nations that I may assemble the kingdoms to pour out upon them mine indignation even all my Fierce anger for all the Earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy and now comes hope and promise for the future Zephaniah 3 for then verse N I will turn to the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one one consent Unity from Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliance my worshippers those who pray to me even the daughter of my dispersed shall bring mine offering and that day Thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou Hast transgressed against me for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride and thou shalt no more be hauy because of my Holy Mountain we have the temple is what they said in their pride we have the temple they have forgotten the god of the temple but we have the temple today what do we hear we have the message we have the Revelation I thank God for the words we've received but there is no place for Spiritual Pride never blessed are the meek The Humble not the proud and arrogant I will also leave in the midst of thee and Afflicted and poor people the meek and humble and they shall Trust In The Name Of The Lord the remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they shall feed and lie down and None Shall make them afraid and finally Israel's joy and restoration the final portion of the prophecy and watch how it starts not with wait and then do this but do this while you're awaiting do what [Music] sing shout O [Music] israad Lord taken away thy judgments he ha cast out th eny the K [Music] ofid Thou shalt not see evil anymore and that day it shall be said to Jerusalem fear thou not and to Zion let not thine hands be slack hanging down listless limp the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is right there with you and he is mighty he will save he will rejoice over the with joy he will rest rest he will be silent about your past sins rest in his love he will Joy over thee with singing I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly who are to thee who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burden behold at that time I will undo all that afflict Thee I will save her that is lame gather her that was exiled and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been mocked and put to shame at that time will I bring you again even in the time that I gather you for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth when I turn back your captivity when I restore you before your eyes saith the Lord we see at least two threads here the first one short term is judgment on Assyria 612 BC Judah 3 years later 609 BC and Jerusalem destroyed burned destruction 586 BC the second thread is longterm far in the future from zephaniah's time called the day of the Lord this is when all peoples of the Earth are judged the people of Israel restored we see what may be some beginning elements of that in our day two things strike me as lessons that we can apply to our lives today from Zephaniah the first has to do with our worship going back to Zephaniah 1 verse4 I will also stretch out my hand upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and I will cut off who the remnant of Baal from this place the name of the hamams with their priests and them that worship the host of Heaven upon the housetops and them that worship and that swear by the Lord and that also swear by malem and them that are turned back from the Lord and those that have not sought the Lord nor inquired for him the Lord demands our worship our love because he first loved us but he does not not want to be our part-time spiritual partner nor does he want to share us with other deities real or imagined Paul wrote about this as well I'm going to display the King James for you to follow but I'll read from the complete Jewish Bible translation as I think parts of it are a bit clearer Colossians chapter 2 verse 8 watch out so that no one will take you captive by means of philosophy and empty deceit following human tradition which Accords with the elemental spirits of the world but does not Accord with a messiah speaking of private Revelations and contrived doctrines skipping to verse 18 don't let anyone deny you the prize by insisting that you engage in self mortification or Angel worship Angel worship such people are always going on about some Vision they have had and they vainly puff themselves up by their words worldly Outlook they fail to hold to the Head Christ from whom the whole body receiving Supply and being held together by its joints and ligaments grows as God makes it grow if along with a messiah you died to the elemental spirits of the world then why as if you still belong to the world are you letting yourselves be bothered by its rules don't touch this oh don't eat that don't handle the other such prohibitions are concerned with things meant to perish by being used they're going to wear out not by being avoided and here's the key they are based on man-made rules and teachings they do indeed have the outward appearance of wisdom with their self-imposed religious observances false humility and asceticism but they have no value at all in restraining people from indulging in their old nature if the musicians would please come at this time John's gospel tells us that Jesus said John 4:23 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him and in John 14 we read Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but but by me again emphasizing pure worship not mixed with cultural and man-made ideas of religion well when should we do all of these things let's go back to Zephaniah chapter 2 and verse one gather yourselves together yeah gather together oh Nation not desired before the decree bring forth before the day passes the chaff before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you you before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you don't wait act now here's what you must do now seek ye the Lord all ye Meek of the earth which have wrought his judgment performed his commands acted in compliance with his revealed will seek righteousness seek meekness it may be you shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger seek the Lord seek righteousness a right relationship with the Lord relationship not religion I'd like to close this portion of the service with a song from Isaiah chapter 55 Heather and I learned it back in 1972 when we first visited the fellowship in gisburn New Zealand seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near
