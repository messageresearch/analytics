[32:44] I I know that they would appreciate it
[32:46] um it's it's good it's it's good to be
[32:50] Associated and we're going to hear from
[32:52] this book of Hebrews chapter 6 that that
[32:56] those people are examples
[32:58] to all of us they should be appreciated
[33:01] and and they should be
[33:02] imitated um I wanted to tell a story
[33:05] Daniel told me a story yesterday um he
[33:09] he called me up and he was on his way
[33:10] home what he did is he went to help a
[33:12] friend
[33:14] move and uh his uh his friend he knows
[33:18] him from the gym I guess and and he's
[33:20] getting a divorced from his wife and and
[33:24] Daniel helped him get all of his stuff
[33:26] out of the house and um he called me up
[33:30] yesterday and he was just ready to
[33:32] cry and Daniel said dad he says he says
[33:36] that people his first words were he
[33:40] talked about the the problems and he
[33:42] said he would go in and there was
[33:44] cameras in the house looking at them
[33:48] looking at what they were doing and and
[33:51] um he uh couldn't touch certain things
[33:54] in the house and you can imagine a
[33:59] home that was once to a married couple
[34:03] just falling into that where it's just
[34:05] pure hatred of each other and Daniel was
[34:09] when he called me yesterday he was just
[34:11] ready to cry and he said dad he says he
[34:15] said it's it's just so bad and and one
[34:18] of the things that he said he says
[34:19] people say they believe in God but they
[34:21] really
[34:22] don't and and I warned him and this is
[34:26] for young people people that this
[34:29] decision that you make on who you
[34:32] marry and who you join yourself
[34:36] to and I told Daniel I said I said buddy
[34:39] you can have it like I
[34:41] do that is just filled with joy and I
[34:44] and I have a wonderful wife and we have
[34:46] a good relationship or you can have it
[34:49] like these people do that you just met
[34:51] that this man and it's just a it's a
[34:53] curse upon
[34:55] you so be so so careful who you're
[34:59] dating who who you set your eyes on to
[35:03] marry because it could ruin your
[35:08] life and Daniel witnessed that witnessed
[35:11] that yesterday where it's just hatred
[35:13] and problems and and just and it's it's
[35:18] just
[35:19] misery but then if you find the right
[35:21] one it's a blessing and it's a it's a
[35:24] blessing every day um
[35:28] and then I was talking with a uh just
[35:33] when Daniel said that it just it made me
[35:35] think that that people say that they're
[35:39] Christians they say they believe in God
[35:41] but do they really that it's fun to say
[35:43] it but when it comes right down to it
[35:46] and we're going to get into this in the
[35:47] book of Hebrews do you really believe
[35:49] and are you willing to make the
[35:51] sacrifices that God requires I was
[35:54] talking with the cabinet guy in my house
[35:56] on Friday or Saturday Friday and he
[36:03] was he we were just talking about the
[36:05] cabinet and really really nice man and
[36:10] um he lives up he lives up in Phoenix
[36:12] now he just moved his family and and he
[36:14] was just nervous and and I started
[36:16] talking to him about his personal life
[36:18] and and it sounds like he had kind of a
[36:21] breakdown during Co he he just saw all
[36:24] of this coming in and it really scared
[36:26] him and
[36:28] he he just was really struggling and and
[36:31] I told him I said do you know do you
[36:34] know
[36:36] God and he he responded said I I don't
[36:40] know he says when I was little we were
[36:43] catholic and um and he says I I even
[36:46] worked sometimes at on the Altar and and
[36:48] and took up the offering and and he said
[36:50] but no he says I don't know and I told
[36:53] him I said I said you
[36:55] know that there is is a God and he's
[37:00] real and just me saying those
[37:03] words tears came to this man's
[37:07] eyes and he he put his head down and I
[37:10] said and he cares about you and he cares
[37:12] about me and he just he was he was
[37:15] feeling like I I could feel it he says
[37:18] oh he says I'm I'm starting to get
[37:21] emotional and what struck me so much in
[37:24] this conversation we talked for about an
[37:26] hour in my house about the Lord what
[37:27] struck me so much is Just The Mention Of
[37:31] God could bring such a
[37:35] response from somebody who had never
[37:37] been to church someone that who didn't
[37:39] know and didn't understand him but it
[37:41] brought such a a response because he
[37:44] could I could tell he knew that there is
[37:46] a God there is someone over on the other
[37:48] side that can take care of him that
[37:51] knows him I was just so taken back and
[37:56] he said I said well do you pray he says
[37:58] no he says I don't have time to prepare
[38:00] to pray he says I'm working all the time
[38:02] and I'm driving down from Phoenix and
[38:05] and I and I asked him I said
[38:07] well you're driving down from Phoenix I
[38:10] said so that's about 4 hours of travel
[38:13] time I said you can't talk to him then
[38:16] that's four hours and he said yeah I
[38:19] guess I guess I could he says but I have
[38:21] to prepare to talk to him he says he
[38:25] says and I can't I can't prepare to do
[38:27] it and I said that's an excuse and he
[38:29] wasn't trying to give me an excuse he
[38:31] was serious he didn't feel worthy to go
[38:35] before the
[38:36] Lord and I asked him I said uh we're
[38:42] made in the image of
[38:43] God and I said you're a father and you
[38:46] love your children I said answer this
[38:48] for me do your children have to prepare
[38:52] to come talk to
[38:53] you and he said no I said and neither do
[38:56] you have to prepare to go talk to talk
[38:57] to the Lord just talk to him he's a
[39:00] father go and and as you're driving talk
[39:03] to him and I said tell him your
[39:05] problems tell him what you're struggling
[39:07] with I said he'll listen to you and I
[39:10] said and then he'll speak back I said
[39:13] he'll speak in his own way it might not
[39:15] come the way that you think it'll come
[39:17] but it will come to you I said just give
[39:20] him a little bit of time and you have
[39:22] the time to do it none of us are too
[39:25] busy and it was just it was a nice nice
[39:29] conversation and it it just struck me
[39:32] just The Mention Of An Almighty God and
[39:36] how that brings that that um that
[39:38] emotion and and that tie to him I wanted
[39:42] to share something with the church um I
[39:46] had a dream on Monday night and I uh it
[39:51] really shook me up and I was asking the
[39:54] Lord and and I'm telling this uh cabinet
[39:58] guy had a talk with the Lord and then
[40:00] and then me I'm asking him and I I'm
[40:02] having trouble getting answers and and
[40:03] I'm like Lord do you want me to share do
[40:04] you not me want me to share it and I
[40:06] don't I didn't tell him that part about
[40:08] how how sometimes it is a struggle to
[40:10] get an
[40:11] answer but I was I was I was up in a
[40:14] hotel up in sholo on Monday night and I
[40:18] uh I had a
[40:19] dream that we had this this puppy and
[40:24] there was there was a bunch of us around
[40:26] and and and um we had this little puppy
[40:28] and people were kind of passing it
[40:29] around it was just the cutest little
[40:31] thing
[40:33] and um we were out in the yard and there
[40:37] was a a like a footer that had been dug
[40:41] and it was about I'd say 3 feet long and
[40:43] may maybe 2 feet wide and it was about
[40:47] maybe 3 feet deep and inside this
[40:50] rectangular footer there was a um rebar
[40:54] at the bottom like uh like you would
[40:56] pour to reinforce the concrete and then
[40:59] right at the level of the rebar the
[41:01] rebar was maybe a
[41:03] foot um above the the the bottom of the
[41:07] of the trench there of the footer and
[41:09] then at right filled up in that uh in
[41:13] that footer it must have rained because
[41:15] there was just a a really
[41:18] soupy um mud like like like a very
[41:22] liquid mud at the bottom so I I'm
[41:25] standing next to this footer
[41:27] and they they had let the little puppy
[41:31] um run around and the puppy jumped
[41:34] into the footer kind of fell in there
[41:37] and he went under the the soupy mud and
[41:42] I looked at
[41:43] him and I thought this is just a little
[41:46] little footer and and you know he he
[41:49] just he jumped in there so I
[41:51] hesitated for a minute and in my mind it
[41:55] was just for a second in my mind I
[41:56] thought well he he'll be okay I'll just
[41:58] reach in and and get him out and he
[42:00] started he started trying to swim and he
[42:02] went under the the soupy mud and I
[42:05] couldn't see him so I I got down and I
[42:08] reached down and I started digging
[42:11] around in the in the mud trying to find
[42:13] him and I and I I felt something and I
[42:16] pulled it up and it was a it was like a
[42:20] a stingray
[42:21] fish and it was something that dwells in
[42:24] the mud if you know what what a stingray
[42:26] is they they swim around in the mud and
[42:27] I and I pulled it up and and I discarded
[42:29] it and then I started to get nervous I
[42:31] couldn't find them so I'm I'm feeling
[42:33] around in there and then I I I found
[42:35] something else and I and I pulled it up
[42:36] and it was a catfish something again
[42:40] that dwells in the mud and I and I
[42:42] grabbed it and I I I threw it away and
[42:44] then I started going around and and when
[42:46] I was pulling these things up it was
[42:48] those those animals that dwell in that
[42:51] environment this puppy wasn't made for
[42:53] that environment so finally I get it and
[42:55] I pull this puppy out and it's lifeless
[42:57] I finally find it and I'm thinking how
[43:00] am I going to revive this this puppy I
[43:02] should have just grabbed him right
[43:04] before he went under and then I woke
[43:07] up and I really feel and it lines up
[43:11] with this book of Hebrews that when
[43:14] something happens when someone is in
[43:17] need to go to them right
[43:20] away grab them and pull them out don't
[43:23] let it sit or if the Lord lays something
[43:26] on your heart to do do it don't just
[43:29] wait go forward because something may be
[43:33] dependent on what you're doing and that
[43:35] that dog that that puppy was dependent
[43:37] on me and I I didn't fulfill my
[43:41] responsibilities I just waited just just
[43:43] a little bit too much and it it was a
[43:49] failure and I don't know what it means
[43:52] but I feel like the Lord is saying hey
[43:54] don't delay
[43:57] if you have something on your heart
[43:59] whether it be for this church or what
[44:02] whatever it is move forward go because
[44:06] life of an innocent creature may be at
[44:11] stake and it could be your children it
[44:15] could be a niece or a nephew or a
[44:17] brother or a sister It Whatever It Is
[44:19] don't delay reach out to that
[44:23] person because they they could be they
[44:26] could be lost
[44:30] this writer of
[44:32] Hebrews it seems like he has that same
[44:35] burden to get the people to move forward
[44:39] in the gospel and don't just stand
[44:41] around and wait and don't sit back and
[44:43] relax but go and and put this this
[44:47] gospel into
[44:49] action Hebrews 61 let's read it
[44:54] again therefore
[44:57] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[45:00] of Christ let us go on unto Perfection
[45:03] not laying again the foundation of
[45:05] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[45:07] toward God and of the doctrine of
[45:10] baptisms and of laying on of hands and
[45:12] resurrection of the dead and and of
[45:14] Eternal judgment and this will we do if
[45:18] God
[45:19] permits you know read that this will we
[45:22] do if God permits what does the author
[45:26] mean here
[45:28] and I must I must say that every time in
[45:33] my life that I've
[45:35] read that scripture and it's been many
[45:38] times I didn't quite get it until now
[45:43] and I believe I do understand it but to
[45:45] properly understand it let's go back to
[45:48] what we talked about last I believe we
[45:50] talked about last Sunday night let's go
[45:52] back to Hebrews chap
[45:55] 5 verse 12 and then this will go and
[45:59] Lead right into this Hebrews 6 Hebrews
[46:03] 5:12 says
[46:05] this for when for the time you ought to
[46:09] be teachers you have need that one teach
[46:12] you again which be the first principles
[46:15] of the Oracles of God and are become
[46:18] such as have need of milk and not of
[46:21] strong meat for everyone that uses milk
[46:25] is unskillful in the word of
[46:27] righteousness for he is a
[46:31] baby but strong meat belongeth to them
[46:36] that are full of age even those who by
[46:39] reason of use have their senses
[46:43] exercised to discern both Good and
[46:50] Evil by by reason of
[46:53] use their senses are tun moed for
[46:58] discernment of Good and Evil by reasons
[47:01] of use they're constantly in the word
[47:03] they're praying they're about the
[47:06] father's business so their senses are
[47:09] tuned to discernment there's a story
[47:12] that my brother told me about an uh
[47:16] Indian a Native American long time ago
[47:19] that met that had a friend a um a white
[47:23] man and they they were close friends and
[47:25] this Indian had never been to the big
[47:27] city where the white man lived so he one
[47:31] day he he's he's coming to visit the
[47:33] white man and they're they're they're
[47:35] going along and this Indian's looking
[47:36] around like wow this is I've never seen
[47:38] anything like this big city and it's
[47:41] just cars going everywhere and all the
[47:43] noise and everything and they're walking
[47:45] along the sidewalk and the Indian stops
[47:49] and he says do you hear
[47:51] that white man says uh what I hearing
[47:55] all the cars and all the bustling and
[47:56] all that that and he says no he says do
[47:58] you hear that
[48:01] cricket and he says no Cricket he says I
[48:07] hear a
[48:08] cricket
[48:09] so he he walks over to the to to the to
[48:14] the edge of the sidewalk and he walks
[48:16] and he sees this trellis of of these
[48:18] Vines and he gets there and he he
[48:22] listens and he he sees the vines here
[48:26] and he slowly opens up the vines and
[48:29] there's a
[48:30] cricket making its
[48:33] noise and the white man looks at him and
[48:35] he says how how did you hear that how
[48:40] did you hear that noise from that little
[48:42] bug and and the Indian says watch this
[48:46] he goes into his pocket and he pulls out
[48:49] a 50 cent piece I don't know if they
[48:50] even make those anymore but he pulls out
[48:52] a 50 cent piece and he says watch this
[48:55] and they're all this this people on the
[48:58] sidewalks and stuff and he throws it up
[49:01] and it hits the sidewalk ding ding ding
[49:04] ding and everybody around him
[49:07] stops and looks down at the at the 50
[49:11] cent piece that he had
[49:12] dropped and he goes back over and he
[49:15] picks it up and he puts it back in his
[49:18] pocket and he says and and the man says
[49:22] he says wow he says you're hearing he
[49:25] says the Native American hearing is much
[49:27] better than the white man's hearing he
[49:29] said no no no it's not he says it's
[49:32] what's my hearing tuned to he said when
[49:34] I dropped that 50 cent piece he said it
[49:38] was no louder than the cricket he said
[49:42] but did you notice everybody heard that
[49:43] noise but they didn't hear this Cricket
[49:46] over here he said my ears are tuned to
[49:51] that let me re let me quote him what he
[49:53] said he said do you realize my friend
[49:55] said the Indian that the Ring of the 50
[49:57] cent piece was no louder than the chirp
[49:58] of the cricket and still many white
[50:00] people heard it and turned around on the
[50:03] other hand I was the only one that heard
[50:04] the
[50:05] cricket the reason for that is not that
[50:08] an Indian can hear better than the white
[50:10] man no the reason is that we always hear
[50:14] very well the things we are accustomed
[50:16] to paying attention to wow and that is
[50:21] us that what we are accustomed to
[50:26] hearing and what matters the most to us
[50:29] is what our senses are attuned to and
[50:33] the the author here is saying that their
[50:38] senses are
[50:39] tuned to
[50:42] discernment and and to to know good from
[50:45] evil but he says that yours
[50:49] aren't verse number 14 but solid food is
[50:54] in uh chapter 5 thank you but solid food
[50:59] is for the mature who by constant use
[51:01] have trained themselves to distinguish
[51:03] good from evil but then in the next
[51:06] sentence he writes something that seems
[51:09] contrary to what he had just said so he
[51:13] says but solid food is for the mature
[51:15] who by constant use have trained
[51:17] themselves to distinguish good from Evil
[51:21] therefore therefore so it leads into
[51:23] something else Hebrews 61 therefore
[51:26] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[51:29] of Christ let us go on unto Perfection
[51:32] not laying again the foundation of
[51:34] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[51:37] towards god of the doctrine of baptisms
[51:39] and on laying out of hands and of
[51:41] resurrection of the dead and eternal
[51:44] judgment and this will we do if God
[51:47] permit notice that he says leave the
[51:49] doctrine of
[51:51] Christ I didn't understand
[51:55] that but he's not not talking about
[51:57] leaving the doctrines that Christ
[52:00] preached he's not talking about leaving
[52:03] Jesus because he wasn't high enough it's
[52:06] not Jesus plus something else he's
[52:09] saying that you leave the doctrine of
[52:12] what you've argued about for years and
[52:15] years and years is he the son of David
[52:18] is he the son of Joseph is he going to
[52:20] be a military King is he going to be a
[52:23] lion is he going to be a lamb is he
[52:24] going to be a literal Messiah or is it
[52:27] just an
[52:29] ideology that's what he's talking about
[52:31] he's saying that you're still trying to
[52:33] explain the Messiah and he's
[52:36] come now take what he said and put it
[52:40] into action and he says the doctrine of
[52:44] of the ceremonial washing of baptism
[52:48] that Doctrine goes all the way back to
[52:50] Deuteronomy
[52:52] Leviticus a laying on of hands and the
[52:55] resurrection of the Dead if you were
[52:57] part of our Bible study on the book of
[52:59] Acts you see that the Pharisees and the
[53:02] Sadducees they were all always at odds
[53:05] with each other because one says that
[53:07] there is a resurrection and one says
[53:10] that there's not and he's saying get
[53:12] away from those doctrines and those
[53:14] those endless those endless um debates
[53:18] and eternal judgment the Pharisees
[53:20] believed that there was a life after the
[53:22] Sadducees believed that that it was just
[53:24] here on
[53:25] Earth there getting back into the old
[53:28] arguments and the old Hebrew Traditions
[53:30] he's saying Christ has come don't fall
[53:33] back into that move on to
[53:38] Perfection What the author is saying he
[53:40] said you don't need a constant
[53:41] repetitive sermon about the fundamentals
[53:44] of
[53:45] Judaism but they need to take what they
[53:47] already know and put it into action he's
[53:50] warning them last
[53:52] week we had Hebrews chapter
[53:55] 12 I mean chapter 4 and verse 12 it said
[53:58] for the word of God is quick and
[54:01] powerful and sharper sharper than any
[54:04] two-edge sword piercing even under the
[54:06] dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit and
[54:08] the joints and Marrow and is a discerner
[54:11] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[54:13] when he says it's quick and it's
[54:15] powerful that word quick means alive
[54:18] it's not dead constantly talking about
[54:21] the definition of of what a prophet is
[54:23] or what a messiah is or these things
[54:25] it's it's alive and it's powerful and
[54:28] Powerful means that it does something
[54:31] it's not a dead religion and this author
[54:35] is saying get to that move on don't get
[54:40] stuck on the
[54:43] definitions verse one therefore leaving
[54:46] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[54:49] let us go unto
[54:54] Perfection he's not as I said he's not
[54:57] talking about Jesus here he's talking
[54:59] about the
[55:01] Messiah that has been prophesied to come
[55:03] and they've been trying to Define all of
[55:05] these years now that he came you don't
[55:07] need to to redefine it to put it in
[55:11] today's perspective and and this letter
[55:13] when he wrote that I imagine that this
[55:16] could have been very very
[55:18] offensive to what he said what he said
[55:20] to these people he said leaving leave
[55:23] the principles and move on to Perfection
[55:27] and he might have got the response
[55:29] saying are you saying I'm not filled
[55:30] with the Holy Ghost he said you know
[55:32] brother I had an experience when I was
[55:33] 18 years old and and I go back to that
[55:36] place he's saying listen don't be
[55:40] satisfied that you've come to the Altar
[55:42] and you've had a perspective or that you
[55:45] can call yourself Christ or that you've
[55:47] been baptized don't be satisfied with
[55:49] those things keep moving keep going
[55:52] don't don't stop and become deaden
[55:58] continue talked about last week we
[56:00] talked about the
[56:01] Sabbath
[56:04] and to have that rest remember the
[56:06] Sabbath is
[56:08] rest to have that rest that we were
[56:11] talking about last week that God rested
[56:14] from his Works remember he created the
[56:17] heavens and the earth I gave that long
[56:19] history of of of the things that we had
[56:22] to know and went all the way to Levi and
[56:25] Judah when we started in Genesis and God
[56:28] rested on that seventh
[56:31] day Naturally
[56:34] Speaking Naturally
[56:37] Speaking you have to
[56:40] work to earn rest you have to you have
[56:44] to it's not it's not just that you're
[56:47] going to rest or I'm just resting in
[56:49] Jesus Christ I understand that but there
[56:51] was a day of rest and what produced that
[56:53] day of rest was six days of working
[56:57] so there is a need for rest if you're
[56:59] not working if you're not doing anything
[57:02] what need do you have for rest you're
[57:04] resting all the time
[57:06] anyways and he's trying to say that that
[57:09] when you when you come into Christ all
[57:12] of those labors and and everything and
[57:15] all of the the the burden that you
[57:17] carried you can just unload them on
[57:19] Jesus and now that you can have this day
[57:22] of rest and he's saying quit drinking
[57:25] milk
[57:27] talking about the Messiah and about the
[57:29] baptism resurrection and all of that and
[57:31] put God's promises into action in the
[57:35] work
[57:36] environment I've seen so many
[57:38] intelligent
[57:40] capable people live
[57:45] below their
[57:47] potential because they don't they don't
[57:50] hold themselves to a higher
[57:53] standard they don't put they don't put
[57:56] in more hours than they're required to
[57:57] at work they don't stick with a career
[58:02] they don't always there's always
[58:04] something bigger and better and some get
[58:06] getrich scheme and it always it never
[58:09] involves good hard
[58:14] work and you see it so often you see so
[58:18] many people fail Daniel and I were
[58:20] eating at Subway the other day and we we
[58:24] sat down and and and I saw one of the
[58:27] people in the store he gets up and he
[58:30] leaves and I looked at my watch and it
[58:31] was
[58:33] 558 and I'm not a stickler on that stuff
[58:37] but he got off at
[58:40] 6 put in a little extra time and you'll
[58:44] be
[58:45] successful if that's just a job
[58:49] fine but the person that works harder
[58:52] the person that has dedication is the
[58:54] person that's owning the store
[58:57] that's the person that's going to be
[58:58] successful wow and if I can just give a
[59:01] little bit of real life
[59:04] experience and and a little bit of real
[59:06] life teaching
[59:07] here put in extra time if you want to be
[59:12] successful kids fail their tests because
[59:14] they don't spend enough time
[59:16] studying husbands and wives are fighting
[59:19] because each is not willing to put the
[59:21] desires and the feelings of the other
[59:23] person
[59:24] first people are successful in their
[59:26] jobs because they're constantly moving
[59:28] and they won't stick with anything when
[59:31] they're at work they spend a few minutes
[59:33] they won't just spend a few minutes more
[59:36] in being
[59:37] successful they're not successful
[59:39] because they're not willing to do more
[59:42] that is your life lesson here today as
[59:44] far as work and the same goes for your
[59:46] walk with the Lord It's if you want
[59:50] Miracles if you want to have this
[59:52] Supernatural experience then how much
[59:54] time do you spend in prayer
[59:57] if you want to speak in tongues how much
[59:59] do you serve other people if you want to
[1:00:02] if you want God to serve you and fill
[1:00:05] you with his Spirit then why are you
[1:00:08] trying to get in front of the next guy
[1:00:10] on the
[1:00:12] highway why aren't you yielding to
[1:00:14] someone else you're a Christian in your
[1:00:16] car just like you're a Christian on the
[1:00:19] highway you want to be a representative
[1:00:22] of Jesus Christ but you're fighting with
[1:00:23] your husband and your wife
[1:00:27] so what if she did you wrong so what if
[1:00:30] you in your mind you think that that
[1:00:33] person Did You
[1:00:34] Wrong they G they did Jesus wrong and he
[1:00:38] still gave his life for
[1:00:41] them according to First Corinthians the
[1:00:44] man represents Christ in the home he
[1:00:48] should be the one that raises above you
[1:00:50] say that God sent a prophet and you
[1:00:52] believe him but you draw a circle around
[1:00:55] the bride and say that those only those
[1:00:57] who believe can step inside this
[1:01:01] circle and you say that you believe the
[1:01:04] same one that came to tear down the
[1:01:06] denominational
[1:01:08] Spirit
[1:01:12] no you should be teaching these things
[1:01:14] he's saying you understand you should be
[1:01:16] teaching these things but instead you're
[1:01:19] just drinking milk we have no
[1:01:23] excuse Hebrews 6:4 for it is impossible
[1:01:26] possible for those who were once
[1:01:28] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:01:29] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:01:32] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[1:01:34] word of God and the powers of the world
[1:01:37] to come the truth has come in their
[1:01:39] minds and they've received a revelation
[1:01:41] of Jesus Christ they had an experience
[1:01:44] at a camp or they had an experience at a
[1:01:46] service where the minister maybe said
[1:01:48] something that that they were just
[1:01:50] thinking that was on their heart and
[1:01:51] they experienced the Heavenly gift they
[1:01:53] may have felt the power of the Holy
[1:01:55] Ghost and they maybe they repented and
[1:01:58] they made a commitment to change and
[1:01:59] maybe they were baptized you've tasted
[1:02:02] the good word you've had this experience
[1:02:05] and the powers of the coming age you
[1:02:07] know what they are but you keep going
[1:02:10] back to those experiences and you ignore
[1:02:14] what it is
[1:02:16] today I had a I had an experience one of
[1:02:19] the most powerful experiences I've ever
[1:02:21] had in my life I was a I was a counselor
[1:02:25] at a youth camp and there was a young
[1:02:28] man who just did not care about the Lord
[1:02:30] he didn't there was nothing about him
[1:02:33] that I saw any potential in that young
[1:02:36] man and I just kept reaching out to him
[1:02:38] trying to love him and and he was there
[1:02:40] because his mom signed him or his dad
[1:02:42] signed him up and he didn't want to go
[1:02:44] and he was just there to to have a good
[1:02:48] time he's going to try to have a good
[1:02:51] time day by day went
[1:02:54] by and that hard shell softened a little
[1:02:59] bit and then the Sunday morning
[1:03:03] service we finished service it was a
[1:03:06] good service I don't think it was
[1:03:07] anything out of the
[1:03:10] ordinary and everybody started to
[1:03:14] leave and he sat right in his
[1:03:18] seat pretty much then everyone was gone
[1:03:22] except for me standing like acting like
[1:03:26] as a deacon and him in the audience rest
[1:03:30] of the whole building was empty whole
[1:03:33] area was empty so I walked up to
[1:03:37] him his head
[1:03:40] down and
[1:03:42] uh I said so what's going
[1:03:46] on and he says I uh I can't do
[1:03:51] it I said okay I said well I said I'll
[1:03:54] tell you what I don't have anywhere to
[1:03:56] be for about a
[1:03:58] week so I'll just stay with you and he
[1:04:03] said I just don't think I can do it and
[1:04:05] I said I'll tell you what let's go out
[1:04:06] and we had a little area to pray and I
[1:04:08] said let's go out to this area there a
[1:04:09] little tent I said let's go sit in there
[1:04:12] and let's talk about it so we go in
[1:04:13] there and there was two chairs in there
[1:04:15] and and we had this complete
[1:04:17] privacy and uh we
[1:04:22] um started talking and and he said I
[1:04:26] can't do
[1:04:27] it and I saidd do what and he says I
[1:04:30] just can't make the
[1:04:32] commitment and I said
[1:04:34] okay um that's
[1:04:36] fine we started we talked a little bit
[1:04:39] more and he said he says I just can't do
[1:04:43] it I said let me ask you this I said do
[1:04:44] you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:04:46] he says yes I do I said well according
[1:04:49] to the Bible if you really believe him
[1:04:51] then you're
[1:04:52] saved I said I tell you what when we
[1:04:54] leave I'll just tell people
[1:04:56] that you really believe in the Lord and
[1:04:57] you got your salv and you recognize your
[1:04:59] salvation
[1:05:01] today he said
[1:05:03] no I said but what's going
[1:05:07] on is the Lord wants to fill you with
[1:05:11] his Holy
[1:05:13] Spirit and when I said
[1:05:15] that I
[1:05:17] heard an eagle scream
[1:05:21] out and I
[1:05:24] thought that's
[1:05:26] weird and I said did you hear that and
[1:05:30] he goes what I was like oh man this is
[1:05:34] I'm going I'm going into Uncharted
[1:05:35] Territory
[1:05:37] now and so IAL I talked to him a little
[1:05:40] bit more and I said I said brother I
[1:05:43] said what God wants to do he wants to
[1:05:47] bring you past just saying that you're
[1:05:51] saved and he wants his Spirit to dwell
[1:05:55] Within you and it screamed out again as
[1:05:57] soon as I said that wow it's like
[1:06:05] whoa said you didn't he goes what I was
[1:06:09] like oh
[1:06:12] man
[1:06:13] okay so then we start talking and I said
[1:06:17] I'll tell you what you just sit right
[1:06:20] there and I'll just stay here with you
[1:06:25] and you just keep making this decision
[1:06:27] and he says I can't do
[1:06:29] it and I said well then why don't you to
[1:06:31] leave he says
[1:06:34] no and he looked up he says I need to be
[1:06:36] maybe I need to be
[1:06:38] baptized and I said yeah baptize you I
[1:06:42] said uh but what Good's that going to do
[1:06:45] he goes
[1:06:48] nothing he'd been baptized before he
[1:06:52] said
[1:06:53] nothing I said brother I said God wants
[1:06:56] to fill you with the Holy Spirit we sat
[1:06:59] for a little while
[1:07:01] longer and I have never felt in my life
[1:07:06] the presence the
[1:07:09] power of the presence that I
[1:07:12] felt that
[1:07:15] kid jerked up in his chair and leaned
[1:07:19] back and said I'll do it and a flood of
[1:07:24] the Holy Spirit came into into that tent
[1:07:27] and I was just like whoa you know I was
[1:07:31] had the chills all over me and and we
[1:07:33] got up and we prayed and we got up and
[1:07:35] we walked outside and he said look how
[1:07:37] green the grass is look how beautiful
[1:07:39] this is he said look at how pretty that
[1:07:41] look at how blue the sky is and he was
[1:07:43] just so happy and and that the Holy
[1:07:46] Spirit was just on him and this was a
[1:07:48] tremendous experience one of the most as
[1:07:50] I said one of the most powerful
[1:07:51] experiences I've ever
[1:07:53] had and he was so excited and he stayed
[1:07:56] with it man he loved the Lord and and he
[1:07:59] stayed in touch with me after and as
[1:08:01] time went by he started to
[1:08:05] drift
[1:08:07] back and it was a worldly
[1:08:12] girl and he told her he said I told him
[1:08:16] I said what's going to happen is this
[1:08:19] girl is going to say that she's going
[1:08:21] because she loves you she's going to say
[1:08:22] that she believes like you do
[1:08:26] and he said okay and I told him a story
[1:08:29] about a situation that I went through
[1:08:31] and and and he actually was reading his
[1:08:35] Bible and he was reading in in in uh he
[1:08:38] just opened up his Bible and he said
[1:08:39] Lord show me if I am supposed to be with
[1:08:43] this girl or not he opened up his Bible
[1:08:46] to the Book of Proverbs and and uh
[1:08:50] Proverbs or huh yeah and it said that it
[1:08:54] talked about world
[1:08:56] women and Solomon fell because of
[1:08:59] worldly women he looked at
[1:09:03] it and the girl says no she says I'll
[1:09:06] start going to church with
[1:09:08] you I'm not saying that somebody can't
[1:09:11] come to the
[1:09:12] Lord
[1:09:13] but it started drifting away in that
[1:09:17] excitement when he left him after a few
[1:09:19] weeks the girl ended up leaving him too
[1:09:22] by the
[1:09:24] way and and he drifted
[1:09:32] away and it didn't come
[1:09:36] back verse six and if they shall fall
[1:09:38] away to renew them again unto repentance
[1:09:42] seeing They Crucified to themselves the
[1:09:44] Son of God aresh and put him to an open
[1:09:49] shame your testimony with this young man
[1:09:53] your testimony speak speaks so loud I
[1:09:57] can't hear what you're saying your
[1:10:01] life what you do every
[1:10:04] day and if you claim to be a Christian
[1:10:07] you claim to have had an experience and
[1:10:09] then you go and you get mad at the
[1:10:12] person on the other side of the
[1:10:14] counter and lose your
[1:10:16] testimony you are putting Christ you're
[1:10:20] crucifying him again and putting him to
[1:10:23] an open shame because they look at you
[1:10:26] your testimony you're saying I'm a
[1:10:28] Christian oh this is how a Christian
[1:10:30] acts wow this represents Jesus Christ I
[1:10:34] don't want any of that that's come on I
[1:10:37] don't want to be part of what you
[1:10:38] are some of the meanest people some of
[1:10:42] the the most vitory all that I've seen
[1:10:44] comes from religious
[1:10:47] circles and we put Jesus on the cross
[1:10:51] again
[1:10:57] and it says in there and this is one of
[1:10:59] the things just such a beautiful chapter
[1:11:01] I didn't understand
[1:11:03] this it says let me read it
[1:11:06] again if they shall fall away to renew
[1:11:11] them again unto
[1:11:13] repentance when there is
[1:11:16] repentance there is always Grace am no
[1:11:21] matter this young man no matter how
[1:11:23] someone can be can can receive a a gift
[1:11:26] at the altar or come to church and make
[1:11:29] the and make the commitment I'm going to
[1:11:30] do it I'm going to do it and then they
[1:11:32] drift away and they may become an enemy
[1:11:34] of God but if they can come back to
[1:11:37] repentance if they can actually repent
[1:11:39] and say I'm sorry there is always Grace
[1:11:43] there it will always be there amen but
[1:11:47] there is a time when that repentance
[1:11:50] that desire to repent will leave and
[1:11:53] that's what he's saying here saying it's
[1:11:55] impossible for that person to come back
[1:11:58] because there's no
[1:12:00] repentance but if there is repentance
[1:12:04] there will always
[1:12:07] always
[1:12:08] be
[1:12:10] Grace but if there's none there's no
[1:12:13] apology there's no confession of
[1:12:15] sin then the world sees that this man or
[1:12:18] the woman this woman claims to be a
[1:12:20] Christian and that's how a Christian
[1:12:22] acts and it puts Christ to an open shame
[1:12:25] shames
[1:12:27] him because you're attaching yourself to
[1:12:29] his
[1:12:35] name otherwise brothers and sisters when
[1:12:39] you feel the holy spirit in church or
[1:12:41] you're listening to a song or you're
[1:12:42] hearing a sermon or you're just soaking
[1:12:45] in the blessings as Jesus pours out he
[1:12:48] he's pouring out those blessings on the
[1:12:50] entire Earth and you're just you're just
[1:12:53] loving it and praising it and and you're
[1:12:55] just thinking I I just love this I love
[1:12:59] the love that is shown to me I love the
[1:13:01] way that people are acting and I just
[1:13:03] it's just so wonderful that that
[1:13:06] blessing can come on a Christian or it
[1:13:08] can come on an
[1:13:09] atheist both of them appreciate
[1:13:12] it Jesus said on The Sermon on the Mount
[1:13:16] he said but I tell you love your enemies
[1:13:18] and pray for those that persecute you
[1:13:20] that you may be children of your father
[1:13:22] in Heaven he causes his son to rise on
[1:13:25] the evil and on the good and send rain
[1:13:27] sends reain on the righteous and on the
[1:13:29] unrighteous and if you love those who
[1:13:31] love you what reward do you
[1:13:34] get are not even the tax collectors
[1:13:36] doing
[1:13:37] that so he's saying he pours out that
[1:13:40] Spirit when you're feeling that Holy
[1:13:43] Spirit anybody can feel that you're
[1:13:47] feeling the blessings of God and he's
[1:13:50] just
[1:13:51] watering his
[1:13:54] plants and then others will benefit from
[1:13:56] that
[1:13:57] watering verse number seven for the
[1:14:00] Earth which drinketh in the rain that
[1:14:02] cometh off upon it and bringeth forth
[1:14:04] herbs meat for them by whom it is
[1:14:08] dressed receive the blessing from God
[1:14:11] the NIV version says this in verse 7
[1:14:13] it's another translation it says land
[1:14:16] that drinks in the rain often falling on
[1:14:19] it and that produces a crop useful to
[1:14:21] those for whom it is farmed receives the
[1:14:24] blessings of God
[1:14:25] God so when the rain is
[1:14:28] falling in the hot and dry times of the
[1:14:31] year all of the plants are
[1:14:34] rejoicing the sticker bushes they're
[1:14:38] rejoicing and you see that they're
[1:14:40] putting out their leaves the plants in
[1:14:42] your garden are rejoicing over the water
[1:14:45] but one the trees are are rejoicing but
[1:14:49] one is a True Believer and the other one
[1:14:51] is just there to enjoy the blessings
[1:14:59] but that which beareth thorns and Briars
[1:15:02] is rejected and nigh and is nigh unto
[1:15:04] the unto cursing whose end is to be D
[1:15:07] burned this analogy is all over the New
[1:15:09] Testament by the way Jesus gave the
[1:15:12] parable of the sewer sewing seeds and
[1:15:14] and as he mentioned on the sermon of the
[1:15:15] mount and and where he's he's talking
[1:15:17] about the rainfalls on the just and on
[1:15:19] the unjust he's talking about the wheat
[1:15:22] and the tears growing together in
[1:15:23] another place and that Harvest time
[1:15:25] they're separated the wheat is put into
[1:15:28] the Garners and the weeds are burned

[1:16:44] of a
[1:16:45] tree pinee pine tree yeah now hold this
[1:16:52] what kind of a tree is Moses
[1:16:54] an apple tree how did you
[1:17:00] know by his
[1:17:03] fruits do you understand thanks Brothers
[1:17:05] you can go back thanks bro you want do
[1:17:07] you
[1:17:09] want remember that so what kind of fruit
[1:17:14] are you giving forth when someone looks
[1:17:16] at
[1:17:17] you are you crucifying Christ
[1:17:21] aresh how are you acting what fruit are
[1:17:25] you known
[1:17:26] by because they're going to look at us
[1:17:29] and they do every day and you can say
[1:17:33] that man and that
[1:17:35] woman they're truly a Christian or
[1:17:39] they're fake man they're not real
[1:17:41] they're the Briars and the thorns and
[1:17:43] the thistles and all of that
[1:17:46] stuff but we we all make mistakes we all
[1:17:51] do it we all do things wrong but that
[1:17:53] Christian when that Christian comes back
[1:17:56] and says hey I'm sorry I talked you
[1:18:00] wrong remember that when you had that
[1:18:02] testimony about how how you went to that
[1:18:04] man and you apologize and they could see
[1:18:07] that that's a Christian then all of that
[1:18:10] that you did
[1:18:11] before it was gone and now that person
[1:18:14] might even have a higher opinion of you
[1:18:18] now that you've apologized and you've
[1:18:20] repented than they did before because
[1:18:23] that's what a Christian does a Christian
[1:18:25] repents but if there is no
[1:18:28] repentance then it is impossible for
[1:18:32] those who are once enlightened and have
[1:18:34] partaken partaken of the Heavenly gift
[1:18:36] if they shall they can't come back
[1:18:38] because there's nothing in them to come
[1:18:42] back verse number
[1:18:44] nine but beloved we are persuaded better
[1:18:47] things of you and things that accompany
[1:18:49] salvation though we thus speak for God
[1:18:52] is Not unrighteous to forget your word
[1:18:55] and labor of love which you have showed
[1:18:57] toward his
[1:18:59] name in that you ministered to the
[1:19:02] Saints and did Minister as I was reading
[1:19:06] that as I was reading all the way down
[1:19:08] until Hebrews chapter to to Hebrews
[1:19:11] verse 9 I was pretty down as I was
[1:19:14] pretty
[1:19:15] harsh and then when I get to verse 9 but
[1:19:18] beloved we are persuaded better things
[1:19:21] of you like all of these these things
[1:19:23] I'm warning you against
[1:19:26] against there's better things about you
[1:19:29] and the things that accompany salvation
[1:19:31] though although we thus speak for God is
[1:19:33] Not unrighteous to forget your work and
[1:19:35] your labor of love which you have showed
[1:19:36] toward his name and that you have
[1:19:38] ministered to the Saints and do minister
[1:19:41] so these works of serving the people
[1:19:43] with labors of Love accompany
[1:19:46] salvation it's part of it serving each
[1:19:49] other once you receive once you
[1:19:51] understand your salvation the first
[1:19:53] thing you want to is help
[1:19:55] others you're so grateful of what God
[1:19:58] has done for you that you want to give
[1:20:01] more of
[1:20:04] yourself Matthew chapter 6 says don't
[1:20:07] give your offerings in front of
[1:20:10] people or to outwardly bring attention
[1:20:13] to
[1:20:14] yourself as a Christian when you do that
[1:20:16] you're rewarding yourself already the
[1:20:18] Bible says you already have your
[1:20:20] reward because others are watching you
[1:20:22] but Jesus said go into your Closet in
[1:20:25] private and pray in secret and then God
[1:20:29] will reward you openly and if you truly
[1:20:32] have a burden for what you're praying
[1:20:36] for your open reward will be that God
[1:20:39] answered your prayers because that's the
[1:20:41] desire of your heart it's not that
[1:20:42] you're
[1:20:44] exalted it's that that person that is
[1:20:46] suffering is healed or that comes to the
[1:20:49] Lord God will ultimately get the
[1:20:53] glory and we desire desire verse number
[1:20:55] 11 um
[1:20:57] Hebrews chapter 6 and we desire that
[1:21:01] every one of you do show the same
[1:21:02] diligence to the full Assurance of Hope
[1:21:05] Until the End again he's warning us this
[1:21:09] book of Hebrews it's it's a warning and
[1:21:11] he continues on saying listen be
[1:21:14] careful this isn't just I know you say
[1:21:17] you're a Christian but there's there's
[1:21:20] something you got to stay with this
[1:21:22] constantly tuning your senses
[1:21:25] back on in Hebrews chapter 4 it says let
[1:21:28] us therefore
[1:21:29] fear lest the promise being left us of
[1:21:32] entering into his rest any of you should
[1:21:34] come short of it he's warning be careful
[1:21:38] don't come short of this rest this
[1:21:40] sabbath then in chapter two he says
[1:21:42] wherefore we ought to give the more
[1:21:43] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:21:45] heard lest at any time we should let
[1:21:47] them slip for if the word spoken by
[1:21:50] Angels was steadfast in every
[1:21:53] transgression and
[1:21:55] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:21:57] of
[1:21:58] reward everything was punished for what
[1:22:00] it did how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:22:04] so great a Salvation which at the first
[1:22:06] began to be spoken by the Lord and was
[1:22:08] confirmed unto us by them that heard
[1:22:11] them God is Not
[1:22:13] unrighteous to forget your work and
[1:22:17] labor of love which you have showed in
[1:22:18] his name and that you have ministered to
[1:22:20] the Saints and do Minister and we desire
[1:22:23] that every one of you do show the same
[1:22:25] diligence to the full Assurance of Hope
[1:22:27] and the end those who are working for
[1:22:29] the Lord serving the SL Saints cleaning
[1:22:33] the church giving rides to people that
[1:22:36] need need rides to go to
[1:22:37] church helping the young people praying
[1:22:40] all hours of the day giving offerings on
[1:22:43] top of your tithes giving to the poor
[1:22:45] doing everything that you can for the
[1:22:47] Lord's work they are examples to all of
[1:22:52] us and the Bible says that
[1:22:55] we should mimic should should imitate
[1:22:59] those people verse number 12 that you be
[1:23:02] not slothful but followers of those who
[1:23:05] through faith and patience inherit the
[1:23:08] promises the word followers it's Old
[1:23:10] English today it means
[1:23:11] imitators of those who through the faith
[1:23:14] and patient inher inherit the
[1:23:17] promises there are some
[1:23:19] people who are giving their all for the
[1:23:22] gospel I know we can always do more but
[1:23:25] he's telling us to do the
[1:23:29] same
[1:23:33] there's there's there's brothers and
[1:23:35] sisters today this this world today is
[1:23:38] Serve Yourself but there's really
[1:23:40] there's people that have come to
[1:23:42] church do you think they always want to
[1:23:44] come to
[1:23:46] church no but they're coming there's
[1:23:49] people that are picking up other people
[1:23:51] and bringing them to church do you think
[1:23:52] they always want to do that no
[1:23:55] there's people who are working out on
[1:23:56] the grounds all the time and helping do
[1:24:00] you think that they want to do that not
[1:24:02] all the time
[1:24:03] no but it's important to them because
[1:24:06] they see the benefits there's people
[1:24:08] that give to the poor do you think they
[1:24:09] always want to give to the poor no but
[1:24:13] they do it
[1:24:16] anyways and the book of Hebrews is a
[1:24:18] command to put God into action and and
[1:24:21] not just rev the engine put it in a Dy D
[1:24:24] and go somewhere if you're just revving
[1:24:27] the engine you're just making
[1:24:29] noise it's not
[1:24:31] real the engine doesn't do any good if
[1:24:34] it doesn't drive the
[1:24:37] car the book of Hebrews is to a command
[1:24:40] over and over and over put this into
[1:24:44] action but the world now more than ever
[1:24:48] is slothful as this scripture says it's
[1:24:51] slothful in the things concerning the
[1:24:53] Lord
[1:24:55] think about it let's bring it
[1:24:58] home how many times do I
[1:25:02] swipe before I
[1:25:05] pray how many times do I
[1:25:07] swipe before I read my
[1:25:10] Bible how many
[1:25:12] times do I swipe before I go to
[1:25:16] church we're swiping our lives
[1:25:19] away wasting time and doesn't do any
[1:25:22] good
[1:25:24] and those people who this book commands
[1:25:26] us to imitate are the ones who are
[1:25:28] making a difference they might not want
[1:25:30] to come to church but they're doing it
[1:25:32] they might not want to pick up someone
[1:25:33] else as I as I said but they're doing it
[1:25:36] they might not want to give their more
[1:25:37] than their tithes but they're doing it
[1:25:39] they might not want to stay up late
[1:25:41] talking to their children but they're
[1:25:43] doing
[1:25:44] it they might not want to reach out to
[1:25:46] their nieces and nephews and cousins and
[1:25:48] encourage their walk with the Lord they
[1:25:50] may not always want to do it but they're
[1:25:52] doing it they overcome that
[1:25:55] and the book tells us to be PR patient
[1:25:57] and to keep
[1:25:59] praying and to have faith because God
[1:26:01] remembers his promises I'm running out
[1:26:03] of
[1:26:04] time verse number 13 for when God made a
[1:26:07] promise to Abraham because he could
[1:26:08] swear by no greater he swear by him
[1:26:11] himself saying surely blessing I Will
[1:26:13] Bless thee and multiplying I will
[1:26:15] multiply thee what he's talking about is
[1:26:18] when when Abraham received the promised
[1:26:21] son
[1:26:22] Isaac and then God tells Abraham hey
[1:26:25] this kid that you have that you and your
[1:26:28] your wife are so happy about and that
[1:26:31] you love so much take him up on Mount
[1:26:33] Mariah there and kill him as a sacrifice
[1:26:36] to
[1:26:38] me Abraham can you imagine how he felt
[1:26:42] he took the child they go up on the
[1:26:48] mountain child looks around he says Dad
[1:26:50] uh we're coming up here to make a burnt
[1:26:53] offering we've got the bundle of sticks
[1:26:55] and we built the altar but where's the
[1:26:57] sacrifice Abraham says son God will
[1:27:00] provide for himself a sacrifice fully
[1:27:02] intending to do what God said he takes
[1:27:05] the child lays him
[1:27:09] there let's take five minutes let's take
[1:27:12] a couple minutes and read it it's worth
[1:27:14] it
[1:27:16] Genesis chapter 22 I believe it
[1:27:20] is verse
[1:27:22] 15 says this so Abraham's has his child
[1:27:26] there he's he's going to do the he's
[1:27:27] going to have the burnt offering he's
[1:27:29] going to kill the sacrifice his son
[1:27:31] doing exactly what God required of him
[1:27:34] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:27:36] Abraham Out of Heaven a second time and
[1:27:38] said I'm sorry let's
[1:27:47] uh when Abraham went to kill this the CH
[1:27:50] the the child the
[1:27:55] the Lord stopped
[1:27:57] him and then he
[1:28:00] sees this Ram that's caught with his
[1:28:03] head in the bushes and God had provided
[1:28:06] that verse number 14 and Abraham called
[1:28:09] the name of that place Jehovah gyri that
[1:28:11] is said to this day in the Mount of the
[1:28:13] Lord it shall be seen so he sacrificed
[1:28:16] this Ram instead of his son but he fully
[1:28:21] intended to do what God told him and the
[1:28:24] angel of the Lord called unto Abraham
[1:28:26] Out of Heaven a second time and said by
[1:28:28] myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for
[1:28:31] because thou Hast done this thing and
[1:28:33] Hast not withheld thy son thine only son
[1:28:36] that in blessings I Will Bless thee and
[1:28:39] in multiplying I will multiply Thee I
[1:28:41] will multiply thy seed as the stars of
[1:28:44] heaven and as the sand which is upon the
[1:28:47] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[1:28:49] Gate of the enemies of his
[1:28:52] enemies and thy seed
[1:28:54] shall all be shall all be shall all the
[1:28:58] nations of the earth be blessed and
[1:29:00] because thou Hast obeyed my
[1:29:04] voice so back to Hebrews that is what
[1:29:07] this author of Hebrews is re is re um
[1:29:10] referring to saying that you are going
[1:29:12] to be blessed because like Abraham you
[1:29:16] put God
[1:29:18] first and so and speaking of Abraham
[1:29:21] verse number 15 and so after he had
[1:29:23] patiently aded endured he obtained the
[1:29:29] promise so he didn't have to
[1:29:32] wait when God made him the promise that
[1:29:35] he was going to have a
[1:29:36] son he didn't have to wait for a
[1:29:39] day for Sarah to say I'm pregnant he
[1:29:42] didn't have to wait for months he didn't
[1:29:43] have to wait for years he had to wait
[1:29:45] for decades still holding to God's
[1:29:50] promise for men verily swear by the
[1:29:53] greater and an oath for confirmation is
[1:29:57] to them an end of all Strife wherein God
[1:30:01] willing more abundantly to show unto The
[1:30:03] Heirs of Promise the IM immutability of
[1:30:07] his counsel confirmed it by an oath
[1:30:09] immutable means
[1:30:11] unchanging in NIV translation of that
[1:30:14] verse says because God wanted to make
[1:30:15] the unchanging nature of his purpose
[1:30:17] very clear to The Heirs of what was
[1:30:19] promised he confirmed it with an oath he
[1:30:23] promised to
[1:30:24] us I will never leave you or forsake
[1:30:27] you earlier in Hebrews he said that he
[1:30:30] is the high priest that can be touched
[1:30:32] by the feeling of our infirmities he
[1:30:34] knows how it is God doesn't didn't know
[1:30:37] how it was to
[1:30:39] suffer he's the Eternal God he never
[1:30:41] suffered he didn't know how it was for
[1:30:43] his friends to forsake Him He was God so
[1:30:48] he came down to earth in the form of a
[1:30:50] man so that he could suffer what we
[1:30:52] suffer and so that he could
[1:30:54] understand
[1:30:56] it and that by two immutable unchanging
[1:31:00] things in which it was possible for in
[1:31:02] which it was impossible for God to lie
[1:31:05] that we might have a strong consolation
[1:31:08] who have fled for Refuge to lay hold
[1:31:11] upon the hope that is set before
[1:31:14] us strong consolation is strong
[1:31:18] encouragement that you can have refuge
[1:31:21] in Christ if he could do what he he did
[1:31:24] with
[1:31:25] Abraham give him a son in his old age
[1:31:28] make him the father of Nations then he
[1:31:30] will honor his promise the author is
[1:31:32] telling us he will honor his promise to
[1:31:34] you and
[1:31:36] me if we lay our lives down for
[1:31:41] him then he will honor his promise but
[1:31:44] we have to accept him and part of that a
[1:31:48] big part of that is we always have to be
[1:31:50] willing to
[1:31:51] repent we always have to be willing to
[1:31:54] to lower ourselves so that God might
[1:31:57] lift us up through his
[1:31:59] promises he wants you to come here this
[1:32:03] morning to hear the word of God he wants
[1:32:06] you to experience the power of the Holy
[1:32:09] Ghost and he wants you to leave with a
[1:32:11] strong encouragement not from man but
[1:32:14] from God that will give you rest in the
[1:32:17] Holy Spirit the your entire
[1:32:20] life it will always be there you will
[1:32:24] stray from it even if you have the Holy
[1:32:26] Spirit you'll stray from it but there
[1:32:28] will be repentance in there and you'll
[1:32:30] come back there is that is God's desire
[1:32:33] he wants to make his promises known I
[1:32:36] promised you this and I am God now you
[1:32:38] receive it and then there is something
[1:32:41] that anchors our soul in that promise
[1:32:45] just as I started just me
[1:32:48] mentioning God to that
[1:32:51] man there was something about about it
[1:32:54] that just brought him to tears just The
[1:32:55] Mention Of God I didn't even say Jesus I
[1:32:59] didn't even say I he loves you I didn't
[1:33:01] I didn't quote any of his promises he
[1:33:03] just knew that there was a god there and
[1:33:05] God wants to make his promises known to
[1:33:08] us and there is something that anchors
[1:33:11] our soul that will that in that promise
[1:33:14] and in that love that God has that will
[1:33:17] never change it's a new birth it's a
[1:33:21] baptism of the Holy Spirit it's God
[1:33:24] changing your nature from the old Daniel
[1:33:28] Evans from the old woman from the old
[1:33:31] man to this new
[1:33:33] nature and a repen of heart is
[1:33:37] key if they fall away it's impossible
[1:33:41] for them to be renewed under
[1:33:43] repentance if they don't have repentance
[1:33:46] it's impossible for them to
[1:33:49] come verse number 19 which hope we have
[1:33:53] as an anchor of the Soul both sure and
[1:33:56] steadfast and which enter entereth into
[1:34:00] that within the veil what is the veil
[1:34:03] you remember the Tabernacle in the
[1:34:05] wilderness that there was there was a
[1:34:07] curtain that protected the holy of
[1:34:11] holies that protected the Ark of the
[1:34:13] Covenant and The Mercy Seat and then
[1:34:16] when they built the temple there was
[1:34:18] that holy of holies that was in
[1:34:22] there and and Jesus the high priest only
[1:34:26] the high priest could go in there once a
[1:34:28] year we've been saying it as we studied
[1:34:30] this book of Hebrews only the high
[1:34:32] priest could go in and it was only once
[1:34:34] a year to make an atonement for the
[1:34:36] people now this man
[1:34:38] Jesus he goes into there and you know
[1:34:42] what happened the curtain was there this
[1:34:44] big heavy curtain and it ripped from the
[1:34:46] top to the bottom he went in first and
[1:34:49] he said come
[1:34:51] on all of us can come into the presence
[1:34:54] of God because of his sacrifice because
[1:34:58] of that high priest that made an
[1:35:00] atonement in the Bible the high priest
[1:35:02] had to make an atonement for themselves
[1:35:04] they had to offer up a an offering a
[1:35:07] sacrifice for their own sins but then
[1:35:09] Jesus goes and offers
[1:35:12] himself a lamb without spot or
[1:35:16] blemish for that
[1:35:19] atonement opened up that curtain and
[1:35:23] said come on into the presence of God
[1:35:25] where you will find rest you will find
[1:35:28] that
[1:35:29] Sabbath whatever needs you have I'll
[1:35:32] provide
[1:35:33] it and we can rest in that as long as we
[1:35:37] are willing to put him first the
[1:35:38] musicians can come and we'll
[1:35:40] close verse number
[1:35:43] 20 whether the
[1:35:47] Forerunner speaking of
[1:35:49] Jesus whether the Forerunner is for us
[1:35:53] entered
[1:35:54] he went in behind the
[1:35:56] veil he tasted death hell the grave and
[1:36:01] conquered
[1:36:02] it whether the Forerunner is for us even
[1:36:05] Jesus made a high priest after the order
[1:36:10] of
[1:36:11] MDC this man mzc is mentioned all of
[1:36:14] about two times in the Old
[1:36:17] Testament and even there it is just a
[1:36:19] couple sentences just a few sentences
[1:36:21] about him but the author of Hebrews
[1:36:24] takes MDC and spends a couple chapters
[1:36:28] on saying who he is he says things like
[1:36:32] he is the high priest he says things
[1:36:33] like he had no beginning of days or
[1:36:35] ending of
[1:36:36] life and who is this mysterious man that
[1:36:40] Abraham when after the slaughter of the
[1:36:42] Kings Abraham's coming back and here
[1:36:44] comes this man and Abraham says oh and
[1:36:47] he pays his
[1:36:48] tithes to this man
[1:36:52] MDC wasn't even a levite as we talked
[1:36:55] about the Levites last week those are
[1:36:58] the ones that those are the ministry
[1:36:59] those are the ones that took the ties
[1:37:02] this man Mount kzdc wasn't a
[1:37:03] levite so why did Abraham pay ties to
[1:37:08] this man and who was this man that had
[1:37:10] no beginning of days or ending of Life
[1:37:15] yeah
[1:37:16] remember what I just read that we need
[1:37:18] to move past the B basic understandings
[1:37:24] of all of these principles that we've
[1:37:27] we've talked about the author of the
[1:37:30] book of Hebrews is about to get very
[1:37:33] very deep with a deep
[1:37:37] understanding a
[1:37:39] deeper understanding of who this man
[1:37:42] Jesus Christ is and that's for next
[1:37:46] week God bless you brothers and sisters

[1:39:03] University of
[1:39:04] Arizona um when I was about that age my
[1:39:07] brother played for him um the football
[1:39:11] coach and one of the things that he used
[1:39:12] to
[1:39:13] say is he said wherever you are be there
[1:39:18] don't be somewhere else if you're on the
[1:39:21] football field you be focusing on
[1:39:24] football if you're a running back You'
[1:39:27] be focused on getting that ball and
[1:39:29] hitting that hole if you're a fullback
[1:39:32] you're focused on getting to that hole
[1:39:34] and making a way so that guy running the
[1:39:36] ball can follow
