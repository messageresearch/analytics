[21:57] amen
[21:59] amen God bless you all it's good to be
[22:02] in the house of the Lord
[22:04] tonight and it's an
[22:06] honor that we are going to hear with our
[22:09] own ears a genuine prophet of God speak
[22:13] to
[22:15] us he's was speaking he spoke this
[22:18] message
[22:20] 1960 on Christmas
[22:22] Day and
[22:25] um as we're listening to brother Brandon
[22:29] preach I want everyone
[22:33] to listen
[22:36] closely listen to his
[22:38] words listen to the way that his voice
[22:42] is and and the emphasis he puts on
[22:45] certain things rather than just reading
[22:47] a minister up here reading a quote
[22:49] you're going to hear it from the
[22:50] original
[22:52] tonight and I want you to make the
[22:55] decision what was brother brand
[22:58] message and I'll tell you this sermon
[23:01] we're going to hear tonight is really no
[23:04] different than almost every sermon that
[23:06] he ever preached they all pretty much
[23:09] had the same
[23:10] theme they all focused on the same
[23:14] thing and there was just he just used
[23:18] different scriptures and different
[23:21] subjects to prove the same
[23:25] point and as you hear this tonight
[23:28] [Music]
[23:30] think
[23:33] about
[23:36] how did he emphasize a big
[23:39] church
[23:41] or in this case did he emphasize a
[23:44] Manger a baby in a Manger did he
[23:47] emphasize a big denomination in an
[23:50] exclusive
[23:52] club or did he emphasize Jesus Christ
[23:56] with open arms
[23:58] to whoever would come in did he
[24:01] emphasize this man
[24:04] Jesus being accepted by all the groups
[24:07] and all the different uh
[24:10] divisions or did he maybe say that they
[24:14] don't want
[24:15] Jesus what they want is their way and
[24:18] they want their
[24:20] churches think about that as you listen
[24:23] to this sermon tonight called God's
[24:26] wrapped gift and you can imagine
[24:29] it was a
[24:30] precious little love gift from God
[24:34] wrapped in these swaddling clothes and
[24:39] laid in a Manger not even a place for
[24:42] the baby to be born not even a a a room
[24:46] a room in the hotel the local Inn but of
[24:49] the poorest of the poor yet that is
[24:52] where Jehovah God himself chose to
[24:55] become flesh and to die to live a life
[24:59] and to die for our sins was this little
[25:03] baby let's sing only
[25:06] believe and then we'll turn the service
[25:08] to brother
[25:09] Brandon
[25:11] [Music]

[25:16] only
[25:20] be all things are
[25:25] possible
[25:26] ho
[25:30] believe

[26:16] Brandon it's always good to come to the
[26:19] house of the Lord but much better seem
[26:21] like in these uh Christmas and New Years

[26:27] special little blessing left for us and

[26:34] this Christmas feeling all the time
[26:36] people waving at you and saying the Lord

[26:42] thing about

[27:22] announcement that um I'm asking that

[27:29] like just to the pastors and Associate
[27:33] pastors of the Tabernacle trustees and
[27:36] deacons of this
[27:39] Tabernacle uh I think it's good for us
[27:41] to get together once in a while and kind
[27:44] of uh find out the way the Lord is
[27:47] leading us and many times there is
[27:49] little things come up like a scriptures
[27:52] that you would uh find that would be
[27:54] hard and if we don't we want the same
[27:57] speak the same thing
[27:59] everywhere and um we want to get
[28:02] together and I want you pastors and
[28:04] Associates of course brother Neville
[28:06] that would be and Brother Don ruddle up
[28:09] here one of our Associates brother Grim
[28:11] Snelling at udica brother Stricker here
[28:15] our missionary and the the Brethren
[28:18] that's uh pastors brother uh the
[28:22] different ones here brother Parnell and
[28:24] you know who the associat are here
[28:27] brother Junior Jackson from down in New
[28:30] Albany and um then uh the deacons and
[28:34] the trustees I tell you what I wish you
[28:37] to do this coming week get you a little
[28:39] slip of paper and write out in there the
[28:43] the thoughts are the I would say to the
[28:48] scriptures are some Duty that you have
[28:51] to tend that you might not know like a
[28:54] trustee would say just what is my duty
[28:57] if this case arises what is my duty as a
[29:00] deacon if this case arises and the
[29:02] pastor might say uh in this word here I
[29:06] see where it was supposed to be so and
[29:08] so and uh I I don't understand it it's
[29:12] the way we teach it and place that down
[29:14] in the scripture and so forth then hand
[29:17] them all into um uh brother wood if you
[29:20] will because he lives next door to me
[29:22] and as soon as you get your root out and
[29:25] as quick as you can I appreciate it so I
[29:27] can be looking it up in the scriptures
[29:29] and we'll have this not it wasn't a
[29:32] public meeting now it's just for the
[29:34] pastors and of this Tabernacle and the
[29:38] deacons and trustees of the Tabernacle
[29:41] and that'll come right away just as soon
[29:44] as we can get them in then we'll
[29:45] announce a night where there's no no
[29:48] meetings going on here and then we'll
[29:50] we'll take care of that then I think
[29:52] it'd be a good thing brother Neen and
[29:55] brother and all you pastors and so forth
[29:57] that we we might come together that way
[29:59] we can speak the same thing everywhere
[30:01] you see we know and then that will be
[30:03] taped also our questions and our answers
[30:07] will be taped and each one may have a
[30:09] tape so that you might know to play back
[30:12] in case of anything any uh question
[30:16] coming up that might be benefit to the
[30:19] church or someone would say well uh this
[30:22] uh we'll go back and see what we on the
[30:24] tape it said we have tapes of that
[30:26] nature already and now we got new
[30:29] trustees I think this year and and some
[30:32] new deacons and so forth and uh we like
[30:36] to get them in instructed on that and
[30:38] this little brother that's one of our
[30:40] Breen from up here at Sellersburg
[30:41] brother um Willard CCE sure get him a
[30:46] message of it if you will because he's
[30:49] just young in the Lord and if these
[30:52] young fellas I think can get established
[30:54] you see what I mean just know how to
[30:56] hold on little questions come up in
[30:58] their mind instead of running off on
[31:01] some limb let's come together and and
[31:03] see what it's all about then when we are
[31:06] meetings our great joint meetings when
[31:08] the churches join together like we've
[31:10] been in this last session then we we
[31:12] would know then just what to take and
[31:15] what to say just what to do we all want
[31:17] to speak the same language so we'll
[31:20] understand
[31:21] now another thing I would like to say as
[31:25] brother Neville has so well said that we
[31:28] wished you the best in the these you
[31:31] Tidings in this time of of Fellowship
[31:35] around these holy days and so forth and
[31:38] then I want to take this time to express
[31:42] to each and every one of you how
[31:45] grateful I am to you for your Christmas
[31:48] cards and gifts and things that was
[31:51] received at our house amen I certainly
[31:54] thank you with all my heart it certainly
[31:56] did us good this morning when I got a
[31:59] little boy small enough yet to kind of
[32:02] want a Christmas tree and we had it in
[32:04] the room and this morning going to there
[32:06] I found several gifts from my church
[32:09] here and my friends from around
[32:11] different places that had come in laying
[32:13] under the tree and I don't have words to
[32:18] express to you what I how I appreciate
[32:21] every one of them and may the god of
[32:24] Heaven bless you richly as my prayer and
[32:28] now and us you know how it would be we
[32:31] cannot send back uh gift
[32:35] because I just wouldn't make that much
[32:38] money you know I I make a $100 a week
[32:40] and I got a big family and about 10
[32:44] million
[32:45] friends it would sure be kind of hard to
[32:47] go around them but we U we are grateful
[32:50] to you in your thoughts and I'm sure you
[32:53] understand now don't forget the this
[32:57] this coming New Year's night oh I
[33:01] remember the first watch party I ever
[33:03] had here in this Tabernacle I don't
[33:04] guess is anyone here remembers it but
[33:07] that was one night the Lord had took
[33:09] plenty of starch out of your
[33:13] pastor so we're looking forward for a
[33:15] great time then and
[33:18] now just before we pray I would like to
[33:21] read the scripture lesson
[33:24] tonight and I have been
[33:27] kind of debating with myself today I I
[33:30] announced that I was going to speak on
[33:33] tonight if I got here uh we have seen
[33:37] his star in the east and have come to
[33:40] worship him that kind of sound familiar
[33:44] to me and our good friend brother sofman
[33:48] here the one of the trustees of the
[33:51] church I'd asked in him and he said I
[33:54] have the tape of it brother brandom you
[33:55] preached it somewhere and our precious
[33:58] friend brother Leo Mercer here the tape
[34:00] boy said yes about five
[34:04] times so I I changed it just a little
[34:08] bit and instead of preaching on we have
[34:10] seen a star in the east I want to speak
[34:13] on the subject tonight of God's wrapped
[34:19] gift and now I'm going to read from St
[34:21] Matthew's gospel the the uh second
[34:26] chapter for a scripture
[34:30] reading the second chapter of St
[34:34] Matthew now when Jesus was born in
[34:37] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
[34:40] the king behold there came wise man from
[34:43] the East to Jerusalem saying where is he
[34:47] that's born King of the Jews for we have
[34:50] seen his star in the east and are come
[34:53] to worship
[34:55] him when Herod the King heard these
[34:58] things he was troubled and all Jerusalem
[35:01] with him and when he had gathered all
[35:04] the chief priests and the scribes of the
[35:07] people together he demanded them where
[35:10] Christ should be born and they said unto
[35:13] him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is
[35:17] written by the prophet and thou
[35:21] Bethlehem in the land of Judea art thou
[35:24] not the least among the prince of Judah
[35:28] for out of thee shall come a governor
[35:31] that shall rule My People
[35:34] Israel then Herod when he had privately
[35:37] called the wise men inquired of them
[35:41] diligently what time the star
[35:44] appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem
[35:47] and said go and search diligently for
[35:49] the young child and when ye have found
[35:52] him bring word again bring me word again
[35:56] that I may come and worship him
[35:59] also when they had heard the king they
[36:02] departed and lo the star which they saw
[36:06] in the East went before them till it
[36:09] came and stood over where the young
[36:11] child
[36:12] was when they saw the star they rejoiced
[36:15] with exceeding great joy and when they
[36:19] were come into the house they saw the
[36:22] young child with Mary his mother and
[36:25] fell down and worshiped
[36:28] him when they had opened their treasures
[36:32] and presented unto him Gifts of gold
[36:35] frankincense and
[36:37] Mira and being warned of God in a dream
[36:41] that they should not return to Herod
[36:45] they departed in their own country
[36:48] another
[36:49] way now I want to take a text out of
[36:53] there tonight not from there but out of
[36:56] the same story in St Luke
[37:02] 2:7 and she brought forth brought forth
[37:06] her firstborn son and wrapped him in
[37:10] swaddling cloth and laid him in the
[37:13] manger because there was no room for
[37:16] them in the
[37:18] end let us bow our heads now for a word
[37:21] of
[37:25] prayer holy and gracious
[37:28] God who gave us the greatest gift that
[37:33] this world has ever known of the Lord

[38:20] has did that for us and we are thy
[38:23] Witnesses in this hour that you take our

[39:11] this great and Dark Hour that the world
[39:14] is now
[39:16] facing we present this reading of Thy
[39:19] word Lord to thee for this one purpose
[39:22] that out of this the Holy Spirit might
[39:25] bring together a
[39:28] context that would be sufficient tonight
[39:31] as a Christmas message to thy people
[39:34] that are waiting and we are waiting on
[39:37] thee Lord circumcise the lips that will
[39:40] speak and the ears that will hear and
[39:44] Empower and put life in the words that
[39:47] goes forth that it might bring us to a
[39:50] better knowledge of the Lord Jesus for
[39:53] we ask it in his name amen
[40:04] am writing down many scriptures here to
[40:07] refer to and so
[40:10] forth I was amazed yesterday as I heard
[40:14] that picked up the paper in where there
[40:16] is a what the commercial World calls a
[40:20] bumper
[40:23] Christmas were that there was more money
[40:25] spent this time that ever been spent in
[40:28] many many years since way back many
[40:31] years
[40:32] ago and at the crowds that gathered into
[40:37] Jerusalem and how that there was a
[40:39] little peace time between the Arabs and
[40:42] the Jews that they kind of let down
[40:45] their feeling to let the the pilgrims
[40:48] come into the city
[40:51] again on this uh season of of Christmas
[40:59] I've often wondered why this city was
[41:03] ever chosen
[41:05] Bethlehem as those uh folks sang just a
[41:09] few moments ago the the little fell an's
[41:13] wife and children and the I was amazed
[41:16] watching the little girl how she was
[41:17] keeping the time with this some sort of
[41:20] a strin harp that she was
[41:23] playing and how that little fellow was
[41:27] yet just a baby merely but yet was
[41:30] keeping the time just with the or pick
[41:33] on this heart I suppose it was called a
[41:37] heart now and then
[41:40] I'm thinking of Bethlehem and why
[41:45] did it happen to be that it was chosen
[41:48] to be the birthplace of the king of
[41:53] kings and you know Bethlehem is a a
[41:56] small place very small
[41:59] town I've often wondered why God didn't
[42:03] choose a more religious place for for
[42:06] this great event such as
[42:09] Shiloh Shiloh was the first place the
[42:12] tent the ark was set after Cross
[42:15] Jordan or gilgal another great religious
[42:20] City or
[42:23] Zion on the mountain another great
[42:26] religious City or even the proud capital
[42:30] of Jerusalem with all of its sages and
[42:33] Saints through the age why didn't God
[42:36] choose
[42:37] Jerusalem why would he choose
[42:42] Bethlehem maybe it looked like he might
[42:44] have chose someplace one of the great
[42:47] Cities of Refuge that would have
[42:49] protected his son in case that some
[42:52] trouble come up the Refuge places like
[42:55] Ray Mo Gilead that was a great Refuge
[42:59] that was built for the people could run
[43:01] into these towers kades was another
[43:05] great City of Refuge heon another great
[43:09] City of Refuge why God picked on little
[43:15] Bethlehem and then did not uh choose
[43:18] these greater cities and they had
[43:21] greater names and uh more of a spiritual
[43:25] background
[43:26] but you know God has a way of doing
[43:29] things just his own way about things I'm
[43:31] so glad he
[43:33] does sometimes he takes things that
[43:36] doesn't have a spiritual background or
[43:39] doesn't have any background at
[43:41] all and that's why he is God he can take
[43:46] something that's nothing and make
[43:47] something out of it and that that's what
[43:50] makes him God that's what makes us love
[43:52] him that's what makes us poor people
[43:55] appreciate him
[43:56] because that even though we poor with no
[43:59] background yet God can do great things
[44:02] with us if he ever gets us under his
[44:06] control Joshua of course was the one who
[44:09] taken the children of Israel over and
[44:12] divided up the
[44:14] grounds and this uh tribe of Judah was
[44:19] given this potion where Bethlehem is
[44:21] which is the upper Northern corner of
[44:25] the U province of Judah a little strip
[44:28] that kind of runs out like a little
[44:30] Peninsula and in this place this
[44:34] province this great Province it's the
[44:37] northern wheat country where the wheat
[44:40] belt was where they raised lots of Wheat
[44:42] and
[44:43] barley and one of Caleb's Sons
[44:48] established and founded this
[44:51] city Salam was his name he was one of
[44:56] Caleb's Sons if you want to look that up
[44:59] I'm skipping over a lot of these
[45:00] scriptures but I see some of the
[45:01] Brethren are putting them down and 1
[45:04] Chronicles
[45:05] 2:15 also you find it in Matthew
[45:09] 1:5 as where they uh he established and
[45:13] founded this great city which was a
[45:17] small City but it's great because of the
[45:20] great things that happened at this city
[45:23] as I've always said it isn't the great
[45:25] church it's a great God in the church
[45:28] amen amen it isn't a great Holy Mountain
[45:31] it's a great holy spirit that was on the
[45:34] mountain amen isn't the holy man it's a
[45:37] holy ghost in the man Hallelujah that's
[45:41] the way this city was it was small in
[45:45] Statue and more in the valley and it
[45:49] wasn't too much to look upon his
[45:51] population was small and is yet today
[45:54] but it was because God chose it to do
[45:56] something amen that's what I like
[46:00] something that God chooses no matter
[46:03] what it looks like the people just as
[46:04] long as God chose
[46:07] it Rahab the Harlot that we're all
[46:10] familiar
[46:11] with she being a a young girl that was
[46:16] turned on the street by Heathen father
[46:19] and
[46:20] mother that put her on the street
[46:22] because she was beautiful and was to
[46:24] bring an income to them on
[46:28] prostitution and yet down in this
[46:31] immoral girl that was turned on the
[46:34] street she had heard that there was a
[46:36] God who answered prayer amen and the
[46:39] first opportunity that she got to accept
[46:42] that God or do something for him she did
[46:46] it God spared her life and saved her
[46:49] father and mother and her family
[46:52] Hallelujah she fell in love with the
[46:54] general in the army of Israel we find in
[46:57] history and married this General and
[47:00] their courtship was wonderful and
[47:03] finally they settled down and lived at
[47:08] Bethlehem and through this General she
[47:12] brought to the world a a son the son of
[47:19] of
[47:21] uh of uh I can't think of the general's
[47:25] name
[47:27] just now I was trying to thought I had
[47:28] his name down here but I don't have her
[47:30] son's name but it was rahab's son to
[47:33] this General his name is
[47:36] Solomon not the Solomon of the built the
[47:39] temple the son of David but another
[47:42] Solomon and this Solomon brought forth a
[47:46] son whose name was
[47:50] Boaz and Boaz oh we are all acquainted
[47:54] with that wonderful story
[47:56] of Boaz and Ruth now you see this Harlot
[48:01] was a
[48:02] gentile and she was an ancient
[48:04] grandmother to our lord
[48:07] Jesus and also when when
[48:11] Boaz her
[48:14] grandson come forth and married Ruth the
[48:17] Mite he also married into a
[48:20] gentile which made Jesus also part
[48:23] Gentile Earthly speaking
[48:27] then when they brought their child forth
[48:31] his name was
[48:32] OED and oid had a son and his name was
[48:36] Jesse and Jesse had a son whose name was
[48:40] David all this taking place in little
[48:43] Bethlehem what is it the lineage of the
[48:47] Lord Jesus amen his backgrounds that the
[48:51] great spiritual man were overlooking are
[48:54] the soall spirit spiritual
[48:56] man and it was on this same
[49:00] grounds that Samuel the prophet anointed
[49:04] David to be king over Israel Hallelujah
[49:07] right here at
[49:10] Bethlehem and through David came forth
[49:14] the great
[49:16] son thou son of David
[49:19] Hallelujah the son that was born in a
[49:22] little stable manger over to the side of
[49:25] the Hill on the west side of the
[49:28] city it was there on that hill where the
[49:30] angels of God sang their first noil
[49:34] Hallelujah the word Bethlehem let's
[49:37] break it
[49:38] down b means
[49:41] house eel means god e h m means bread
[49:48] the house of God's
[49:51] bread how fitting it was then for the
[49:56] bread of life to come out of the
[50:00] Bethlehem House of God's
[50:04] bread oh it's a beautiful story
[50:09] amen it must have been just a little
[50:12] after dark and the sun had gone down the
[50:15] stars probably had been out in the light
[50:17] was about two hours
[50:21] gone as the little
[50:24] donkey was placing his little tired feet
[50:28] up along the back side of the
[50:31] Hill West of
[50:33] [Music]
[50:34] Bethlehem as he watched for he placed
[50:37] his little host because his cargo was
[50:41] precious
[50:42] hallu and Joseph was leading him gently
[50:46] along as the little Trio started up the
[50:49] Healer been traveling all day long
[50:53] coming from down to Nazareth
[50:56] and she was expecting to be mother at
[51:00] any
[51:02] time way past due maybe but all things
[51:07] are foreordained of God that works
[51:11] together for good to them that
[51:14] loving it was ordained of God that there
[51:17] should be a heartless King in that day
[51:19] the bloodthirsty
[51:21] Herod God knew about
[51:23] that God knew about the taxes and how
[51:27] this brutal government did not have no
[51:31] thoughts of the mercy on that poor
[51:34] mother that was just about to be ready
[51:37] to deliver her firstborn son just in a
[51:40] few days but he commanded that they all
[51:43] should come to their native birthplace
[51:47] and pay taxes no matter what condition
[51:49] she's in she's got to come
[51:52] anyhow God knew all about that he for
[51:55] knew all things and he he knows all
[51:58] things he and he makes everything work
[52:01] together for a
[52:02] good the little Trio is making no fuss
[52:05] about it as they come up the
[52:07] hill finally after much groaning the
[52:09] little donkey I can see them as they'
[52:12] stop at the top of the hill where the
[52:15] come up from the West Side from Nazareth
[52:17] coming over and after they top the hill
[52:20] to look down into the valley where
[52:22] little Bethlehem laid
[52:25] many torches was
[52:27] burning many people had gathered from
[52:30] all over
[52:31] Galilee to come into the birthplace
[52:34] there at Bethlehem and through the
[52:36] Providence to be taxed of the Roman
[52:39] government no matter what conditions
[52:42] they strolled along the road the sick
[52:44] and the needy and the bedridden the
[52:46] leper the cancer the the the the poor
[52:50] the lame the halt the
[52:52] blind all had to come because it was a
[52:55] government order and Herod was behind it
[52:59] and it must be
[53:02] done and as our little party stops at
[53:06] the top of the
[53:07] hill there must have been a large Rock
[53:10] laying there I can see Joseph pick her
[53:14] up tenderly in his arms and help her off
[53:17] the little mule and and set her up on
[53:21] the side of the Rock and the little mule
[53:23] sigh for his breath and as Joseph then
[53:28] walked a few steps forward looked down
[53:30] into little Bethlehem and seen the
[53:32] streets crowded and the Roaring the
[53:35] Torches of burning in the streets and
[53:37] the yells of the people and there's
[53:40] laying in the yards and in the courts
[53:42] and all outside the city
[53:44] Gates must have been some
[53:48] sight Joseph must have said something
[53:50] like this Mary
[53:53] dear just think
[53:55] just beyond the city on the North
[53:58] side that's where Ruth the Mite glean
[54:03] Yonder in the fields of
[54:07] Boaz Yonder just beyond that up over the
[54:10] mountain Y is where
[54:13] David with his sling shot took the line
[54:17] to the ground and pull the sheep from
[54:21] his
[54:22] mouth must have been there
[54:25] that word Joshua stood here with his
[54:28] gleaming sword The Fearless Warrior of
[54:31] our people and divided the lands and
[54:33] give this inheritance to the tribe of
[54:35] Judah to which sweetheart we are leanage
[54:40] to and it different things of how that
[54:43] he must been explaining to her what
[54:45] taking place and then to hear no sound
[54:49] from behind him he must have turned to
[54:52] look to see if she was still sitting on
[54:54] the rock
[54:56] and when he turned and he seen her
[54:58] pretty face turned towards the skies he
[55:01] didn't have to ask anymore because the
[55:03] reflection of the star was looking back
[55:06] through her eyes he knew she was looking
[55:08] at
[55:10] something and she looked at him and said
[55:15] Joseph have you noticed the star hanging
[55:18] Yonder and when he looked into surprise
[55:21] say I hadn't noticed it before dear well
[55:24] it's been F us ever since the sun went
[55:27] down I've watched
[55:29] it it must mean something because I have
[55:33] the most wonderful
[55:35] feeling you know God does things like
[55:38] that sometimes for his
[55:40] people shows us a light or some way that
[55:44] we can know that he's near and he's on
[55:46] the scene and no matter what the world
[55:48] has to say or do he's still there and
[55:51] everything will be all right he just
[55:53] Witnesses it back by the holy spirit
[55:56] that we can feel it and Joseph might
[55:59] have said something like this Mary you
[56:02] know what I've never been so happy in
[56:07] all my life when I've been drove around
[56:10] by the Roman government but yet I have
[56:12] never been so happy as I am right now
[56:15] and I don't know why it seems like
[56:18] there's a sacredness over the little
[56:20] city tonight where we roam when we were
[56:23] boys and girls
[56:25] back in our teenage and school
[56:29] age way into the East many hundreds of
[56:34] miles away from there the ma is already
[56:38] on the
[56:39] road they had seen his star and was
[56:43] coming to worship God's little gift
[56:46] package that he was sending to the
[56:50] world just a little while from then and
[56:54] the world was was going to receive its
[56:56] greatest gift that had ever received a
[56:59] little package wrapped up a little first
[57:02] little Christmas
[57:03] package that was ever wrapped in all the
[57:06] world God wrapped it up Hallelujah I
[57:10] want to break in all my thought and say
[57:14] this the greatest thing was ever wrapped
[57:17] in human flesh is
[57:20] wrapped God himself wrapped his own self
[57:25] and a Christmas package and sent it to
[57:27] the
[57:29] worldall why did they refuse
[57:32] it why couldn't they see
[57:38] it why did they turn it
[57:41] down why is it they didn't want
[57:43] it the same reason they don't want it
[57:47] tonight
[57:50] amen it wasn't handed to them in the
[57:53] custom that they were
[57:55] used to gifts being
[57:58] handed that's the reason it's rejected
[58:01] yet
[58:02] tonight is because it's not handed to
[58:05] the people in the custom amen that they
[58:11] have been used to receiving gifts
[58:15] amen but God wraps his own package he's
[58:18] got a right to do it he's the one that's
[58:21] given
[58:22] it amen he has a right to wrap it any
[58:25] way he wants to wrap it doesn't make any
[58:28] difference how it is he's got a right to
[58:31] do it because he's the one that's giving
[58:34] the the
[58:35] gift
[58:37] Hallelujah another thing the reason of
[58:40] it was as it was then so as it wasn't
[58:43] customary for them to receive it the way
[58:46] it was wrapped they was expecting
[58:49] something a gift coming that would come
[58:52] down on
[58:53] chariots with a Angel escort driving
[58:57] fiery
[58:58] horses but when he come as a little
[59:03] baby being born in a
[59:06] manger little did they ever know the
[59:09] scripture said I'll give this world a
[59:11] super
[59:13] [Applause]
[59:15] sign they asked for a sign one day he
[59:17] said I'll give it to
[59:19] you it'll be the Super sign it'll be the
[59:24] sign that'll last to all ages amen a
[59:28] virgin shall
[59:30] conceive and shall bear a child a
[59:34] son and they shall call his name
[59:39] Emmanuel that's the super
[59:42] sign that's the gift that I'm going to
[59:44] give but it didn't come the way they was
[59:47] expecting it and they turned it down so
[59:51] is it tonight my
[59:53] brother God gift hasn't come the way
[59:56] people wanted to come and so they'
[59:58] turned it down they don't want
[1:00:02] it they want it wrapped in the kind of
[1:00:04] the goods that they want to wrap it in
[1:00:08] they want the tensil on it they want
[1:00:11] something flowly something that's
[1:00:14] perfumed something that's
[1:00:17] glittering something that's
[1:00:20] classic but God don't s it all the time
[1:00:23] like that amen
[1:00:26] he sends it in the power the way he
[1:00:28] wants to send
[1:00:30] it another thing it was brought by the
[1:00:35] poor Mary and Martha uh Martha rather or
[1:00:38] Mary and Joseph was very poor people
[1:00:42] they were
[1:00:43] peasants and because it was brought by
[1:00:47] the poor they didn't want
[1:00:51] it so is it
[1:00:53] today when this great gift of the
[1:00:57] church the Holy Spirit falls upon the
[1:01:01] poor and
[1:01:02] humble the rich don't want
[1:01:06] it they don't want to Humble
[1:01:09] themselves they want it with
[1:01:13] class but they don't want it the way God
[1:01:15] sends it amen many people wants to
[1:01:19] receive the Holy Ghost but but they want
[1:01:21] to get it the way they want
[1:01:23] it
[1:01:25] but oh I'm so glad that you can't do it
[1:01:28] that
[1:01:29] way you have to do it the way God sends
[1:01:33] it to you Hallelujah and humble
[1:01:36] ourselves to receive
[1:01:40] it it wasn't wrapped in fine Linens it
[1:01:45] was wrapped in swalling
[1:01:47] claw which I'm taught that the very
[1:01:50] thing that Jesus was wrapped in the
[1:01:52] Christ was the stuff off the back of a
[1:01:56] yolk of an
[1:01:57] ox that was hanging in the
[1:02:00] stable he was wrapped in the swalling
[1:02:03] cloth was the the where they put the rag
[1:02:06] around the ox's yolk to keep it from
[1:02:09] rubbing a blister on him when he was
[1:02:11] pulling they they had no clothes for him
[1:02:15] and they oh I think of that it nearly
[1:02:18] breaks my
[1:02:19] heart no clothes for
[1:02:22] Emmanuel the creator of of heavens and
[1:02:26] earth and no clothes for him to put on
[1:02:29] and had to be wrapped in the rag that a
[1:02:33] ox had worked his neck
[1:02:36] through oh what a super sign it ought to
[1:02:40] be real attractive to the people little
[1:02:43] Jehovah crying like a
[1:02:45] baby God made flesh in a
[1:02:49] package God who covers all space and
[1:02:53] time before there was a wh or a star or
[1:02:56] a
[1:02:58] molecule wrapped
[1:03:00] himself in a little package and was laid
[1:03:04] in a
[1:03:05] Manger in a
[1:03:07] stable where the manures of the cattle
[1:03:10] and sheep and things up over that stable
[1:03:15] and in this little manger on straw or
[1:03:19] hey
[1:03:21] Jehovah was laying there crying like a
[1:03:24] baby Hallelujah can you imagine
[1:03:28] it why the rich didn't want nothing like
[1:03:32] that that would pollute their own
[1:03:35] thoughts anything so
[1:03:37] humble and would be brought by a girl a
[1:03:42] little peasant
[1:03:44] girl that was considered in her
[1:03:47] neighborhood a
[1:03:49] fanatic and by a
[1:03:52] carpenter who probably know
[1:03:55] ABCs and how could they ever bring forth
[1:04:00] anything that could talize or appease
[1:04:03] the
[1:04:04] eyes of the
[1:04:07] celebrity how could they ever produce
[1:04:10] something that would please or satisfy
[1:04:14] the rich highminded
[1:04:16] people are the denominations of their
[1:04:20] days they were turned down flat
[1:04:25] not only in that day but in this day
[1:04:29] also they turn it down
[1:04:32] flat it don't come wrapped the way they
[1:04:35] want
[1:04:36] it they want uh to discard it say
[1:04:40] there's nothing to
[1:04:42] it so the rich and the denominations
[1:04:45] refuse that gift they had nothing to do
[1:04:48] with
[1:04:51] it why why would they do a thing like
[1:04:55] that it wasn't wrapped in the custom of
[1:04:58] their
[1:05:00] Creeds that's the reason why today that
[1:05:04] they don't want the gift of
[1:05:06] God this United States don't want God
[1:05:11] these churches don't want God that's
[1:05:13] right they want Santa
[1:05:15] Claus they want something with t and red
[1:05:18] colors and and and and bright shiny
[1:05:22] things they views the truth of the
[1:05:26] Gospel of the power and the resurrection
[1:05:29] of Christ
[1:05:31] Jesus it won't wrap with their Creeds
[1:05:35] You Can't Rap Christ in a
[1:05:39] Creed I was listening this
[1:05:42] morning as I was going down to Mama's
[1:05:46] early turned on the
[1:05:48] radio and a a church was quoting or
[1:05:52] saying the what this called the Apostles
[1:05:56] Creed there is no such a
[1:05:58] thing the only Creed the apostles ever
[1:06:01] know to had is found in Acts
[1:06:05] 238 repent everyone of you and be
[1:06:08] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:06:10] the remission of your sins you shall
[1:06:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Oh
[1:06:14] Glory that's the only Creed I ever seen
[1:06:17] in the Bible they ever used this other
[1:06:19] is a man-made Creed and you cannot WRA
[1:06:23] Christ in a Presbyterian Creed or in a
[1:06:26] Baptist Creed or a Catholic Creed or a
[1:06:30] Pentecostal
[1:06:32] Creed the only one thing that Christ
[1:06:35] will be wrapped in in that your
[1:06:38] heart not your
[1:06:40] Creed he wants your
[1:06:43] heart he's got a control tower there
[1:06:46] that he likes to work with you bring it
[1:06:49] eternal life amen he just won't accept
[1:06:51] and you cannot wrap him in Creed s you
[1:06:55] can't then you can't now you never will
[1:06:57] be able to do it so they could not
[1:06:59] receive it because they thought more of
[1:07:01] their Creeds and they did other the
[1:07:05] gift that's the way it is today people
[1:07:08] can't accept speaking with tongues in
[1:07:10] their
[1:07:10] Church it would ruin their Creed they
[1:07:13] can't accept Divine Healing the baptism
[1:07:16] of the Holy Ghost and such great
[1:07:20] Evangelical doctrines of the Bible
[1:07:22] Apostolic truths
[1:07:24] why because our Creed condemns
[1:07:28] it oh how
[1:07:31] foolish to take the paper the packages
[1:07:34] wrapped in and throw the gift
[1:07:38] away like the
[1:07:41] he took the box and accepted it
[1:07:44] and throw the gift away that's the way
[1:07:46] the churches and people do
[1:07:50] today they forget that the gift of God
[1:07:53] is eternal life life through Jesus
[1:07:56] Christ he's rejected as much today as he
[1:07:58] was then this Christmas night he's just
[1:08:01] as much rejected as he was the first
[1:08:03] Christmas
[1:08:04] night they cannot do it because it
[1:08:07] disagrees with their Creeds all down
[1:08:10] Through the Ages we've had the same
[1:08:11] thing no wonder there was no room for
[1:08:14] him in the
[1:08:15] end
[1:08:17] no wasn't wrapped right it wasn't
[1:08:20] wrapped the classical paper around it it
[1:08:22] was wrapped as a
[1:08:26] gift as a gift from
[1:08:29] God sent from God am a God that they
[1:08:34] didn't know nothing
[1:08:35] about amen they claimed they
[1:08:38] did and they claim they was looking for
[1:08:41] him but he did not come in the way that
[1:08:44] they thought he was coming according to
[1:08:46] their Creeds and they could not receive
[1:08:48] God's Gift amen he was wrapped different
[1:08:52] he was wrapped up like a a baby he was
[1:08:55] born in a manger he come from poor
[1:08:58] people he come from a bunch of Fanatics
[1:09:01] amen so how could they receive something
[1:09:03] like that no wonder there was no room
[1:09:06] for him in the end there's no room for
[1:09:08] him yet in the churches they OU him they
[1:09:11] don't believe in it they'll set away
[1:09:13] with such a thing it's fanaticism we
[1:09:17] want nothing to do with it it's against
[1:09:19] our father's doctrines the doctrines of
[1:09:22] this church the doctrin of our uh Creeds
[1:09:25] of our forefathers therefore Christ is
[1:09:28] just as rejected today as he was back
[1:09:31] there there's no room tonight in our
[1:09:34] good churches our big churches our fine
[1:09:36] churches there's no room in our
[1:09:38] religious circles today for a holy ghost
[1:09:42] meeting they don't want
[1:09:44] it it it belittles them in the sight of
[1:09:47] the classes of the country am it
[1:09:51] belittles them to think that they humble
[1:09:54] themselves to come down to an altar to
[1:09:56] cry and to T there until they're filled
[1:09:59] with power from on high Amen to rise up
[1:10:02] from there with newness of light to let
[1:10:05] women let their hair grow out and act
[1:10:08] like women ought
[1:10:09] to to make men throw away their
[1:10:11] cigarettes and quit their drinking and
[1:10:14] treat their families
[1:10:17] right it's too much
[1:10:19] farm so they hold on to the Creed of
[1:10:22] their church instead of receiving God's
[1:10:24] Gift God's Christmas gift Lord they'
[1:10:28] rather have a Creed than they would the
[1:10:30] gift rather have the paper than the
[1:10:33] gift they want the paper sure something
[1:10:36] it's all tensil not a fuss that can do
[1:10:39] about it but the real gift that's on the
[1:10:42] inside of it they don't want it see he
[1:10:44] was wrapped in in a dirty cloth a
[1:10:47] swalling cloth and he's wrapped today in
[1:10:49] the same thing which they call Holy r
[1:10:55] fanaticism a bunch of
[1:10:58] Heretics it's wrapped
[1:11:01] up and swalling
[1:11:04] cloth and the world don't want it oh I'm
[1:11:08] so glad to raise that cloth off look
[1:11:12] what's lay underneath
[1:11:13] it eternal
[1:11:17] life God made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:11:21] Us they didn't want him
[1:11:24] it interfered with their religious
[1:11:27] circles to receive it today it
[1:11:29] interferes with them oh if somebody
[1:11:32] would raise up in the church and start
[1:11:35] shouting and praising God or somebody
[1:11:38] say Amen like this group of Minister
[1:11:40] share something or in the audience
[1:11:43] quickly an usher would lead him to the
[1:11:47] door and if you had your name on the
[1:11:49] book it'd be quickly taken
[1:11:51] off see God don't don't have a a
[1:11:55] chance if the president elect Kennedy
[1:11:59] would visit this city here the flags
[1:12:02] would would fly and the the tensil would
[1:12:05] fly and the and the carpets would be
[1:12:07] rolled out and and such a welcome you
[1:12:10] you never seen which that's all right if
[1:12:13] they want to do that he's elect
[1:12:15] President in the United
[1:12:17] States but if he'd come they do all of
[1:12:21] that and they give him the greatest
[1:12:24] welcome and think that he humbled
[1:12:27] himself to come to such a small City at
[1:12:29] Jeffersonville Indiana when New York and
[1:12:32] the big cities are calling for him
[1:12:34] everywhere just for a moment of time to
[1:12:37] speak with him if he'd come to
[1:12:39] Jeffersonville to a poor City like ours
[1:12:43] how they would put on what we call the
[1:12:45] dog and they' do everything and and
[1:12:48] dress up the streets and and do
[1:12:50] everything to make him welcome
[1:12:54] that's all right if you're a politician
[1:12:57] that's all right but Jesus can come in
[1:13:01] the form of the resurrection of his
[1:13:03] power amen can come in the Holy
[1:13:07] Ghost and can show signs and wonder amen
[1:13:11] every newspaper will criticize it but
[1:13:14] people will call Holy rulers they say
[1:13:17] the people's
[1:13:19] crazy no wonder we're got an atomic bomb
[1:13:22] with her name right
[1:13:25] spurn Mercy there's nothing left but
[1:13:28] judgment hallu oh they will not receive
[1:13:32] it they wouldn't man they want
[1:13:35] now why didn't they do it just want ask
[1:13:38] why didn't they give accept
[1:13:41] God's uh Christmas gift why didn't do it
[1:13:45] they do it if it just the gift that they
[1:13:47] could have looked at and it was fit in
[1:13:50] their society it would have been all
[1:13:52] right if our if this Holy Ghost religion
[1:13:55] would fit in people's society today
[1:13:57] they'd take
[1:13:59] it but why don't they take it them
[1:14:01] because they think more of their society
[1:14:03] than they do of
[1:14:06] Christ that is true amen you say you're
[1:14:09] speaking awful hard about him I'm taking
[1:14:11] up for him he's my Lord I have a I'm his
[1:14:16] servant I have a right to scream out
[1:14:19] against
[1:14:21] that that's right
[1:14:24] and
[1:14:25] Christians believe that and know that
[1:14:27] and accept that in order it's of
[1:14:29] Truth why was the reason they didn't
[1:14:31] receive this rap package they know what
[1:14:34] was on the inside of it and they didn't
[1:14:36] want
[1:14:37] it that's the reason the churches and
[1:14:40] people today and the governments and the
[1:14:42] lands will not receive God's Christmas
[1:14:45] present is because they know what's in
[1:14:49] it they don't want
[1:14:52] it make women act different or make men
[1:14:54] act
[1:14:55] different you'll have to bear the name
[1:14:58] of a fanatic you'll have to take the way
[1:15:01] with the Lord's dis past few you'll have
[1:15:04] to clean up your life you'll have to
[1:15:06] quit your
[1:15:07] meanus you'll have to stop doing wrong
[1:15:09] cheating stealing lying committing
[1:15:11] adultery you'll have to stop these
[1:15:15] things and the people don't want
[1:15:19] it although they may know it's right but
[1:15:22] they don't want it it brings too much
[1:15:26] truth to them it uncovers their
[1:15:29] sins so therefore they don't want it
[1:15:32] don't nothing to do with it keep away
[1:15:35] from it that's the way it was in that
[1:15:36] day they know what was wrapped in it so
[1:15:38] they said away with it they don't want
[1:15:40] it it's the same thing today amen never
[1:15:44] want it and they don't want the Holy
[1:15:46] Ghost today is because they know what's
[1:15:49] wrapped in it they can watch a a person
[1:15:52] receive the Holy Ghost ghost they stand
[1:15:55] out there and see that that woman maybe
[1:15:58] as low as she could be even the dogs are
[1:16:00] hard to look at her see that woman come
[1:16:03] up from that altar a new
[1:16:05] person to see that woman clean her life
[1:16:09] up get out and act like a
[1:16:12] lady see one that runs the bridge
[1:16:15] parties smoke four or five packs of
[1:16:18] cigarettes a
[1:16:19] day hang around the saloons a regular
[1:16:22] Barfly
[1:16:24] and they know if they ever accept this
[1:16:28] gift of God Amen that's wrapped in the
[1:16:32] package called Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:16:35] it'll spoil every bit of their worldly
[1:16:38] funds because he won't stand for
[1:16:42] that it does something to him it changes
[1:16:46] people people don't want to be changed
[1:16:48] they let me
[1:16:49] alone it reminds me that demon possess
[1:16:53] man that Jesus went over into
[1:16:55] Galera and there was a man over there
[1:16:57] had 2,000 devils in
[1:17:00] him and they said what what are we to do
[1:17:02] with the why do you come here leave our
[1:17:06] lands we don't want you here they want
[1:17:09] to be left alone amen the people felt
[1:17:13] better at home with the devils and they
[1:17:15] did with Jesus so they said go on out of
[1:17:18] our land we don't want you over
[1:17:21] here poor old Legion is the only one
[1:17:23] that that wanted help he always comes to
[1:17:27] those who wants him he comes to those
[1:17:30] who needs him so he was the only one was
[1:17:33] help I've often thought when I get to
[1:17:35] heaven I want to see how much how much
[1:17:38] weight his testimony give on hog rers
[1:17:41] over in
[1:17:42] Galleria if it's go to call them a heard
[1:17:45] of hogs they didn't want no
[1:17:47] Revival if it's going to cost people
[1:17:49] anything they don't want nothing to do
[1:17:50] with it so it is the is going to cost
[1:17:53] you your bunk Oak parties big times your
[1:17:57] cigars your dirty jokes all the filth
[1:18:01] and things of the
[1:18:03] world the reason they don't want it
[1:18:06] it'll cost them
[1:18:08] something you're a big Society name with
[1:18:11] a lot of glitter on it but it'll give
[1:18:14] you a name written in the Lamb's Book of

[1:18:23] your free moral agan oh receive God's
[1:18:27] Christmas gift is my my prayer for you

[1:18:41] was going to change his

[1:21:10] something what's God the resurrection
[1:21:12] got to do with a chicken the dirtiest
[1:21:15] bird there is what's any more filthier
[1:21:18] than a chicken and they put in there to
[1:21:19] take the place of
[1:21:21] Christ
[1:21:23] watch any more of the myth in Santa
[1:21:25] Claus never was such a thing telling
[1:21:29] children lies you'll be responsible for
[1:21:31] it at the day of the
[1:21:34] Judgment I wonder if people don't know
[1:21:36] what to
[1:21:37] do they they just don't want the real
[1:21:40] thing they'll take anything artificial
[1:21:42] but they don't want the real thing they
[1:21:43] don't want the gifts of
[1:21:46] God oh
[1:21:48] my certainly they don't want Jesus
[1:21:51] that's one thing
[1:21:53] I got rolled down here one reason they
[1:21:55] didn't morning is because that when he
[1:21:57] went into their Temple and he found
[1:21:59] their filth in the temple he turned over
[1:22:02] the tables and run the money changers
[1:22:05] out he cleaned it
[1:22:07] up and if they' ever let the Holy Ghost
[1:22:09] get into one of these big churches
[1:22:11] around here he'd clean it
[1:22:13] up so they can't accept that you see
[1:22:17] Hallelujah you make them quit gambling
[1:22:19] make them stop them rock and roll
[1:22:21] parties putting her picture in the
[1:22:23] papers beat necks like a Methodist
[1:22:25] preacher did down here in hard Park
[1:22:27] Clarksville got a brother sitting here
[1:22:29] now if he didn't comb his hair down for
[1:22:31] him and man servant of God put his
[1:22:34] picture in the paper have a beat neck
[1:22:37] party of a thing in the church John
[1:22:39] Wesley know that had turn over his
[1:22:42] grave wow they turned down the Christ
[1:22:45] that John Wesley
[1:22:46] know right and accepted a beat
[1:22:50] neck they got a beat neck
[1:22:53] religion they got beat neck children
[1:22:56] beat neck Papa beat neck
[1:22:59] Mama beat neck president just one on so
[1:23:02] this keeps on
[1:23:06] going oh what a
[1:23:10] disgrace why they refuse the
[1:23:14] real God said he' give them over to
[1:23:16] strong delusions to believe a lie be
[1:23:18] damned
[1:23:19] by God said it would do it you refuse
[1:23:22] right you have to take wrong there's no
[1:23:24] other way you refuse to go right you
[1:23:25] have to go left go some other way
[1:23:27] besides
[1:23:29] right so you can't go right and wrong at
[1:23:31] the same time well they refuse the Holy
[1:23:34] Ghost they refuse Christ they refuse
[1:23:36] God's program they refuse the messenger
[1:23:39] they refuse
[1:23:40] everything so therefore they're left in
[1:23:43] their sins there's nothing left in but
[1:23:45] judgment but being that's right just
[1:23:49] that's exactly right they have they have
[1:23:51] refused Christ they refused his program
[1:23:54] they refused his Spirit he's tried for
[1:23:56] 50 years that the Holy Ghost has been
[1:23:59] falling in America they've refused it
[1:24:01] for 50 years and theight is blacker and
[1:24:04] darker than it
[1:24:05] ever and even upon those that fell on in
[1:24:09] the
[1:24:09] beginning their children has organized
[1:24:12] and denominated it oh am and wound it
[1:24:15] into organizations so they are refusing
[1:24:18] the very God that their fathers
[1:24:21] receed
[1:24:23] they claim their
[1:24:28] Pentecostal
[1:24:29] no doesn't make a sour horse to live in
[1:24:33] a barn no indeed he no more than it does
[1:24:36] to make a Christian out of a man
[1:24:37] belonging to a Pentecostal church
[1:24:40] Baptist Presbyterian anything else he's
[1:24:42] still a sinner until he's converted and
[1:24:44] when he's converted he's borned again
[1:24:46] the spirit of God and changed over and
[1:24:49] he's accepted Christ and the Holy Ghost
[1:24:51] is coming and made him a new creature a
[1:24:54] new
[1:24:55] creation then they refused it then they
[1:24:58] refused it now he'd turn over their
[1:25:01] money tables he'd turn over their
[1:25:03] trustee board their their Pastor board
[1:25:06] they they would he they get a board all
[1:25:10] right oh what a difference there be if
[1:25:12] he come into the churches
[1:25:14] today but he can't get
[1:25:16] in we found him the other night in this
[1:25:19] church age oued out by his own church
[1:25:21] standing the door knock and trying to
[1:25:23] get back in again a merciful father
[1:25:27] after being kicked out by his own people
[1:25:29] trying to get back in his church again
[1:25:32] he said I'm the one that walks in the
[1:25:34] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:25:35] am and on the last Church age here he
[1:25:37] was on the
[1:25:38] outside they kicked him out where about
[1:25:42] and this lady is seeing age standing
[1:25:45] again trying to get back in again at his
[1:25:48] own door to his own church what a
[1:25:50] pathetic thing
[1:25:53] that's one of the most pathetic pictures
[1:25:54] that the Bible paints is that second
[1:25:58] chapter of Revelations the third rather
[1:26:01] how that it is that Christ out there
[1:26:04] another pathetic thing I think one of
[1:26:06] the most pathetic words that Jesus ever
[1:26:08] said was so he said
[1:26:11] father I sanctify myself that they might
[1:26:15] be
[1:26:16] Sanctified in other words he had a right
[1:26:18] he was a man he had a right to home he
[1:26:21] had a right to family was man much man
[1:26:25] as you are I am as much human in his
[1:26:28] manhood as we were he had a right to it
[1:26:32] but he was training 12
[1:26:34] men that was going to take the gospel to
[1:26:37] all the world Hallelujah so he
[1:26:39] Sanctified himself for their sake I
[1:26:42] sanctify myself for their sake a gift of
[1:26:45] God keeping himself
[1:26:48] Sanctified oh gifts of God you people
[1:26:52] who claim that you've received this
[1:26:54] Spirit keep yourself Sanctified
[1:26:57] Hallelujah keep away from the things of
[1:26:59] the world be
[1:27:02] Sanctified
[1:27:04] oh who did know what was in this gift
[1:27:09] package was there anybody ever found out
[1:27:11] what was in it I'm so glad that there
[1:27:14] was who know
[1:27:16] it it was a hidden thing a rejected
[1:27:19] Stone amen
[1:27:22] but there was somebody found out what
[1:27:24] was in it I'm so
[1:27:34] glad we know what was in that little
[1:27:37] package that we know what has happened
[1:27:40] in our lives and it's been made real I
[1:27:43] want to read something brother brandham
[1:27:46] said something I learned
[1:27:51] today
[1:27:55] paragraph 75 he says this they don't
[1:27:59] want
[1:28:00] it it's the same thing
[1:28:03] today never wanted it and they don't
[1:28:06] want the Holy Ghost today because they
[1:28:09] know what it's wrapped in they can watch
[1:28:11] a person receive the Holy Ghost stand
[1:28:13] out there and see that woman may be as
[1:28:17] low as she could
[1:28:19] be till even the dogs would hardly look
[1:28:22] at her and see that woman come up from
[1:28:24] the altar a new person to see that woman
[1:28:27] clean her life up and get out and act
[1:28:30] like a lady see one that runs to bridge
[1:28:34] parties and smokes four or five package
[1:28:35] of cigarettes a day hang around the
[1:28:37] saloons in a regular
[1:28:38] Barfly and they know if they ever accept
[1:28:41] a gift of God it's wrapped in the
[1:28:43] package called Jesus Christ it'll spoil
[1:28:45] every bit of their worldly funds because
[1:28:47] he won't stand for that it does
[1:28:49] something to them it changes people
[1:28:52] people people don't want to be
[1:28:56] changed they say let me alone let's all
[1:29:09] stand they can watch a person receive
[1:29:11] the Holy Ghost they stand out there and
[1:29:14] see that woman maybe as low as she could
[1:29:17] be till even the dogs would hardly look
[1:29:19] at her and see that woman come up from
[1:29:21] the the altar a new
[1:29:24] person we have
[1:29:27] seen that very
[1:29:30] thing in this
[1:29:34] congregation marily and I learn
[1:29:37] today there's a homeless
[1:29:40] woman two years ago sitting outside at
[1:29:45] this bus
[1:29:47] stop strung out nothing no hope in life
[1:29:54] calls out to
[1:29:56] God says
[1:29:59] God are you
[1:30:01] Buddhist are you
[1:30:04] Muslim what are
[1:30:06] you crying out to the
[1:30:10] Lord and the Lord laid it on her
[1:30:14] heart right out here outside of these
[1:30:17] doors a homeless
[1:30:20] lady
[1:30:24] Lord I want to be
[1:30:29] baptized you all know her or you should
[1:30:33] know
[1:30:34] her because she's been attending this
[1:30:36] church for a while maybe I'll have her
[1:30:39] give her
[1:30:40] testimony I baptized her a few months
[1:30:43] ago in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[1:30:46] she comes almost every Sunday
[1:30:50] morning
[1:30:52] this
[1:30:53] church this
[1:30:55] church believes in the Jesus Christ that
[1:30:59] this Prophet spoke of and I'll stand on
[1:31:03] that till the day I die now I ask you as
[1:31:06] you were listening to this
[1:31:08] tape what message did this man William
[1:31:11] Brandon
[1:31:14] preach did he preach a message of Christ
[1:31:18] and
[1:31:19] forgiveness or did he preach a message
[1:31:22] of
[1:31:23] denomination and
[1:31:26] secularism and drawing circles around
[1:31:29] ourselves what message did he preach you
[1:31:31] just heard him
[1:31:32] preach and those of us that listen to
[1:31:34] tapes a lot we know he says the same
[1:31:38] thing on almost every
[1:31:40] sermon it's the same spirit it's called
[1:31:43] the Holy
[1:31:45] Spirit and it says the same thing over
[1:31:48] and over again it is Jesus Christ and
[1:31:52] him crucified as I said this morning
[1:31:54] Paul said I don't want to know anything
[1:31:56] else just Jesus Christ and him
[1:32:00] crucified there is no one that can say
[1:32:04] it like William Marian
[1:32:07] Brandon I love his
[1:32:09] message I love I love I wish I could
[1:32:12] have known him but one
[1:32:14] day I'm going to shake his hand I'm
[1:32:16] going to give him a big hug and I'm
[1:32:18] going to say thank you brother brandom
[1:32:20] thank you for showing me that Jesus
[1:32:21] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:32:23] forever thank you for giving me a
[1:32:25] message I did my
