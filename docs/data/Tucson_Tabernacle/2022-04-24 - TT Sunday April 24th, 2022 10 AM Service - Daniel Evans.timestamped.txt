[40:54] brother scott is a special brother
[40:56] you've never heard any jokes like that
[40:57] have you
[40:59] but scott's a special brother to me a
[41:01] good friend
[41:03] it's uh
[41:04] and we've had some good fellowship over
[41:06] the years
[41:08] i am i'm still kind of feeding over
[41:10] service
[41:11] last sunday
[41:13] i really appreciated that what brother
[41:15] aaron had on his heart to have
[41:18] all uh
[41:19] four of us ministered i appreciated what
[41:22] the brothers said i appreciate
[41:23] appreciated what brother aaron said and
[41:25] and
[41:26] brother joe
[41:27] quoted him today when he talked about
[41:29] saturday and
[41:31] and how saturday was a hard time and
[41:34] i appreciate brother aaron ministering
[41:36] on that i appreciated brother lyle
[41:38] ministering
[41:39] also on the humility
[41:42] of mary and and how that mary was had
[41:45] the honor of being the first one to see
[41:48] the resurrected lord
[41:50] but the one thing that that really stuck
[41:52] with me
[41:53] and i think the thing that meant the
[41:55] most to me of of that whole service
[42:00] and i know it it went a little long
[42:02] everybody stayed right on time except
[42:04] for the guy that spoke last
[42:07] and you know he he got a little bit
[42:09] excited and
[42:10] and he
[42:11] let it go a little longer and i feel
[42:13] like i feel like it was when i was back
[42:15] in college i am
[42:17] and when i was getting my bachelor's
[42:19] degree brother peter i i was able to
[42:21] squeeze four years of college into six
[42:25] it's a gift
[42:28] but uh so i did i i was a little bit
[42:30] long last sunday and i apologize for
[42:33] that but i wanted to uh point out
[42:36] something that brother peter said
[42:38] and brother peter said this and i
[42:40] thought it was such a profound statement
[42:42] i went back and i i listened to the
[42:45] service
[42:46] on the website peter said this
[42:48] peter says god's plan for resurrection
[42:51] was never for a single son to be raised
[42:54] but that there would be many sons
[42:56] brought to glory
[42:58] what a what a wonderful statement and
[43:00] it's something that we may all know as
[43:02] christians we we look at that
[43:04] resurrection
[43:06] and we all we all understand what what
[43:08] peter's statement was but the way he put
[43:10] it so eloquently it just really stuck
[43:13] with me all week and brother peter i
[43:14] really believe that the lord led you in
[43:16] saying that i i listened to your whole
[43:19] sermon again and it was it was just a
[43:21] tremendous blessing to me
[43:24] i thank you thank you for that and um
[43:27] i i believe that the resurrection
[43:30] is something that
[43:32] it's so
[43:33] often overlooked
[43:35] but it is the most important thing in a
[43:40] christian's life in a christian's life
[43:43] in a christian's testimony
[43:45] we could we could go on a promise and we
[43:47] we go on promises that that we will be
[43:50] resurrected that we will we will receive
[43:53] eternal life
[43:54] but jesus showed us that
[43:58] he was the only one as i said when i was
[44:00] preaching that could lay down his life
[44:04] all of us could lay down our lives
[44:06] but he was the only one that could take
[44:07] it up back again
[44:10] and
[44:11] i get i i was excited all week i had a
[44:14] really good week
[44:15] it started with a dear friend brother ed
[44:19] calling me up and praying with me on
[44:21] monday morning you know i was going
[44:22] through some uh hard things that people
[44:25] that all of us go through at work and
[44:28] the lord took it was a really difficult
[44:30] week last week and made just a great
[44:32] week this weekend and i appreciate
[44:35] being on somebody's heart
[44:38] and let's never forget friends to reach
[44:40] out to each other
[44:42] that meant the world to me when brother
[44:44] ed called me and and said he wanted to
[44:46] pray with me
[44:47] it was important to me and i know that
[44:50] we pray for other people i i pray for
[44:53] other people all the time but when
[44:54] somebody
[44:55] calls me up
[44:57] and says hey you're on you're on my
[44:58] heart that's a real blessing
[45:02] um
[45:03] i wanted to talk this morning about a
[45:06] subject
[45:07] that is dear to my heart
[45:10] the first sermon i ever preached was
[45:14] in the traditional sense here in the
[45:16] here in the pulpit was at a minister's
[45:19] meeting and brother aaron was there
[45:21] and i preached
[45:23] on the images
[45:25] that divide us
[45:27] and
[45:29] it was it was a subject that's dear to
[45:31] me and and
[45:32] i pray that the lord will give me the
[45:34] wisdom to bring it forward to you
[45:37] and to maybe help you all in your walk
[45:40] with the lord and and
[45:43] you're
[45:44] not judging other people i think we have
[45:47] to be careful with that we all do
[45:51] and i wanted to
[45:54] maybe say i know that all of us are
[45:56] asked one of the questions
[45:57] that
[45:58] probably every one of us has asked is
[46:00] why do you go to that church
[46:03] and i've been asked many times why are
[46:05] you going to the tabernacle
[46:06] just as you all are
[46:08] why do you come to the tabernacle why do
[46:09] you go to this church or that church and
[46:11] i really don't believe that any church
[46:13] is any better than any other church
[46:16] what i believe is that you will get out
[46:19] of church
[46:20] what you put into church no matter where
[46:23] where you are
[46:24] if you come and you come expecting if
[46:27] you come not willing to all the time
[46:29] just sit back and feed just sit back and
[46:32] eat but i think that we should also come
[46:34] to church to feed
[46:36] we should also come to church to work we
[46:39] should come to church to serve others
[46:41] and i think when we start serving others
[46:44] is when we will start receiving more
[46:47] and when asked
[46:49] why
[46:50] that stephanie and i are coming to the
[46:53] tucson
[46:54] tabernacle i
[46:57] i wanted to share with you all why we're
[46:59] here
[47:01] and
[47:02] i know that this church has a long way
[47:04] to go like every other church this
[47:06] church has problems like every other
[47:08] church this church
[47:10] really needs to improve like every other
[47:13] church
[47:14] but when i come here
[47:16] i come to this church because i see a
[47:19] great potential
[47:21] i see a foundation
[47:23] in this church that's built on the
[47:25] people that are in these pews now
[47:28] that has a potential to do something
[47:30] very special
[47:32] i really see that and that's why i'm
[47:34] here brother and that's why i come to
[47:36] church here
[47:37] is because
[47:39] i want to be part
[47:41] of the lord doing anything
[47:43] i am
[47:44] my
[47:46] my dad and my my grandpa evans they used
[47:50] to follow brother branham around the
[47:51] country
[47:53] they followed brother branham because
[47:55] they knew that god was doing something
[47:58] in those meetings and they wanted to be
[48:00] part of that they wanted to be there and
[48:02] i think that i might have that same
[48:04] spirit that i want to be wherever god is
[48:09] i want to be where god is going to move
[48:12] and going to do something and
[48:15] i have two very important
[48:18] things on my heart that that i want in a
[48:21] church
[48:22] and it's something that i've always
[48:24] desired my whole life
[48:26] and we don't i don't have we don't have
[48:27] it yet
[48:28] but i want a church
[48:31] that i can witness to someone on the
[48:33] street
[48:35] and that i can bring them
[48:38] to church
[48:39] and that they would
[48:41] give their hearts to the lord it would
[48:43] have a place that wouldn't be judgmental
[48:46] that wouldn't
[48:47] wouldn't
[48:49] hammer them with doctrines
[48:51] but that could come to a place that they
[48:54] could give their hearts to the lord
[48:56] jesus and grow and receive the holy
[48:58] spirit
[48:59] i want that in a church
[49:01] and i see that this church could be that
[49:04] and i don't see that very often
[49:06] and then i also want a church
[49:09] that the people that have left
[49:12] that have left the fold maybe that have
[49:14] lost faith
[49:15] in brother braham's message i would like
[49:17] to see a church that
[49:19] would welcome them back
[49:22] instead of judging them instead of
[49:25] saying that you have to conform to our
[49:27] image of christianity that would welcome
[49:29] that and that they would feel
[49:30] comfortable coming back here those are
[49:33] the two things and and friends
[49:35] this church i see that
[49:38] that we could be that
[49:40] i want to be like i said wherever the
[49:43] lord is wherever he's moving is where i
[49:45] want to be and it may not be here
[49:48] i don't know just like you all all of us
[49:50] are constantly we should always be
[49:52] praying lord where do you want me what
[49:54] do you want me to do
[49:56] i want to be where god is i want to be
[49:59] where the holy spirit is moving where
[50:01] where the love of god exists
[50:03] and that is my purpose for being here
[50:05] because i see that we could
[50:08] be that we could possibly this church
[50:11] this church is really the first message
[50:13] church besides the branham tabernacle
[50:16] that ever was
[50:18] when brother greene felt to start a
[50:20] church and he welcomed brother branham
[50:22] to tucson
[50:24] this church was founded on that the
[50:26] church in sierra vista also i think
[50:28] that was that was the
[50:30] if not the first it was one of it was
[50:32] either this one or that one it was the
[50:34] first real message church
[50:36] and
[50:37] i see
[50:38] in this church that
[50:41] there is also the potential
[50:45] to reach across the aisle
[50:48] and break down some of the barriers
[50:51] that have come up over the years
[50:54] brother branham's message came to tear
[50:57] down the denominational system
[50:59] it came brother branham referred to the
[51:01] scripture that this prophet of malachi 4
[51:04] this angel of revelation chapter
[51:07] that this man
[51:10] was also in the book of revelation that
[51:14] it's there was a voice that said come
[51:15] out of her my people come out of those
[51:17] denominations come out of those those
[51:19] separations come out of that
[51:22] and friends i see that this message
[51:26] the the message that
[51:29] not let's say not with the capital m in
[51:31] message
[51:32] this message
[51:34] has become divided again it's become
[51:36] segregated we've started drawing circles
[51:39] that if you don't see it my way
[51:42] then then you're out you're out of the
[51:44] message
[51:45] and
[51:46] i believe the tucson tabernacle
[51:48] could be i don't know
[51:51] and the lord hasn't told me that i just
[51:53] have hope in my heart that the two son
[51:56] tabernacle could be the church that
[51:59] could reach a cross
[52:01] and say we're our brethren
[52:03] and that's what i want to see so bad
[52:05] it may not be
[52:07] it may be
[52:08] but why not
[52:10] why not this church brother branham he's
[52:12] misquoted many times on this on this
[52:14] quote
[52:15] but brother branham said this he said it
[52:18] is better to be right in your heart
[52:22] and wrong in your doctrine
[52:24] than right in your doctrine and wrong in
[52:26] your heart it's misquoted many times
[52:28] many most people say spirit brother baby
[52:30] never said that brother brahm said heart
[52:33] and i believe the people
[52:35] in this church
[52:36] have the right hearts we have a long way
[52:39] to go
[52:40] we have there's there's many weaknesses
[52:42] that we have but i think that we're
[52:44] right in our hearts and we have the
[52:46] right motives and we want to get we want
[52:49] to get
[52:50] there
[52:51] and i want so bad
[52:53] to see our children come back
[52:56] i want to see those that have left to
[52:58] have an open door an open place to
[53:01] welcome the men
[53:02] that's that's what that's why i'm here
[53:05] because i see that this church
[53:08] more than any other church that i know
[53:09] of has the potential to do that
[53:13] i uh i could
[53:16] go on and on and on
[53:18] uh about that i'll never get to my
[53:20] sermon
[53:22] but um
[53:24] brother braham said this
[53:26] brother branham said the church can
[53:28] never progress
[53:29] until it knows what grounds it's
[53:32] progressing on
[53:34] and friends that grounds
[53:36] needs needs to be none other
[53:39] none other than the lord jesus christ
[53:41] and him crucified none other
[53:45] my topic today
[53:48] is images
[53:49] that divide us let's turn in our bibles
[53:52] to the book of daniel
[53:56] now as you're turning down to daniel
[53:58] chapter two
[54:00] what's going on here
[54:02] is
[54:03] the um
[54:05] nebuchadnezzar invaded
[54:07] jerusalem invaded judah
[54:11] and he took
[54:13] thousands
[54:15] of these hebrews captive and he brought
[54:18] them back
[54:20] to his hometown to his home place which
[54:22] was the country of babylon which is the
[54:24] city of babylon
[54:26] and he took the good ones he took the
[54:27] ones that were able to do things and he
[54:29] brought them back he conquered jerusalem
[54:32] he took all the treasures he brings them
[54:34] back to his country
[54:36] and he puts these men and women to work
[54:39] in babylon
[54:41] and the king has a bad dream
[54:46] and
[54:48] this dream the king knew the king knew
[54:50] it was very significant
[54:54] and it was so significant that he wasn't
[54:56] going to trust it to his
[54:59] ministerial group
[55:01] he wanted to see some sort of a sign
[55:05] that these men were led of god
[55:09] so
[55:10] he makes a decree he says i had a dream
[55:14] he says i want you to interpret my dream
[55:18] they're like great no problem king we
[55:20] can do it
[55:21] and he says but here's the catch
[55:24] you're going to have to tell me the
[55:25] dream
[55:27] like wait wait a minute
[55:29] nobody can do that except god the king
[55:31] says that's
[55:32] right and he says oh and here's another
[55:35] kicker if you can't do it you're going
[55:37] to die
[55:40] i'm going to kill every last one of you
[55:42] if you can't do it
[55:44] that's a rough boss brother joe
[55:48] so
[55:48] they they start everybody starts getting
[55:50] upset and we can't do it they argue with
[55:52] the king and the king sticks to it i've
[55:54] made this decree and this is going to be
[55:56] how it is so just before
[55:58] the king starts slaughtering these guys
[56:02] the word comes to daniel
[56:04] this prophet
[56:06] this young man that was taken out of out
[56:08] of his country
[56:11] his family was taken out of his country
[56:13] and he had a gift
[56:16] great
[56:17] man
[56:18] and and here's what brother daniel did
[56:22] brother ed this uh makes me think of of
[56:26] you calling me on monday
[56:28] in daniel chapter 2
[56:30] 26
[56:33] um i'm sorry in daniel chapter 2 17 and
[56:36] 18 he goes to his buddies
[56:39] his buddies are shadrach meshach and
[56:42] abednego his his three friends these
[56:44] three young men he goes to them and he
[56:46] says brethren he says
[56:49] pray for me
[56:52] he said let's pray
[56:53] and what a good example it is that that
[56:56] the brethren can come together and pray
[56:58] one for another so he gets them together
[57:01] and they they pray
[57:04] and let's go to
[57:08] chapter 2 verse 26.
[57:12] and then daniel goes before the king
[57:16] and he says this the the bible says this
[57:18] and the king answered and said unto
[57:20] daniel whose name was belter
[57:23] art thou able to make known unto me the
[57:25] dream which i have seen and the
[57:27] interpretation thereof
[57:29] now listen to the prophet's answer
[57:32] daniel answered in the presence of the
[57:33] king and said
[57:35] the secret which the king had demanded
[57:38] cannot the wise men the astrologers the
[57:41] magicians the the
[57:43] sayers shall show unto thee
[57:46] daniel's saying right here he's saying
[57:48] no i can't make it known
[57:51] i can't i can't do this see the wisdom
[57:53] of the prophet then he says this but
[57:55] there is a god in heaven
[57:57] that revealeth secrets and maketh known
[58:00] to the king nebuchadnezzar
[58:02] what shall be in the latter days notice
[58:04] how the prophet gives the credit to god
[58:07] thy dream and thy visions upon thy head
[58:11] of thy head upon thy bed are these and
[58:13] then daniel goes and discerns
[58:17] the dream
[58:19] tells the king the dream and then tells
[58:22] him the interpretation of it
[58:25] the king
[58:26] was like wow
[58:29] this must have really made an impression
[58:31] on nebuchadnezzar
[58:33] so the king
[58:34] he's listening to daniel
[58:36] and he says
[58:37] he's got to be thinking in his mind none
[58:39] of my these men that i was about to kill
[58:42] none of them could do this in fact i've
[58:44] never seen anything like this
[58:46] so
[58:47] he he goes on and let's let's go to the
[58:49] next verse here
[58:52] let's go to verse 46.
[58:57] then the king nebuchadnezzar fell on his
[58:59] face and worshiped daniel
[59:00] and commanded that they should offer an
[59:02] oblation and sweet odors unto him
[59:05] the king answered unto daniel and said
[59:07] of a truth
[59:09] it is
[59:10] that your god is a god of gods and a
[59:13] lord of kings and a revealer of the
[59:15] secrets seeing that thou couldest reveal
[59:18] the secret
[59:21] then the king made daniel a great man
[59:24] and gave him many gifts
[59:26] and made him a ruler over the whole
[59:27] province of babylon and chief of the
[59:30] governors over all the wise men of
[59:31] babylon then daniel requested of the
[59:34] king
[59:35] his friends
[59:36] and he set shadrach meshach and abednego
[59:39] over the affairs of the province of
[59:40] babylon but daniel sat in the gate of
[59:44] the king
[59:46] now go over to the next verse
[59:48] chapter 3
[59:50] verse 1. nebuchadnezzar the king made an
[59:52] image of gold whose height was three
[59:54] score cubits and the breaths
[59:56] thereof six cubits
[59:58] he set it up in the plain of dura
[1:00:00] in the province of babylon
[1:00:06] look how that
[1:00:09] falls in the line of the scriptures
[1:00:12] so this king nebuchadnezzar who is who
[1:00:13] is by nature a gentile an idolater
[1:00:17] daniel does this great thing
[1:00:20] nebuchadnezzar
[1:00:22] pays homage to him
[1:00:25] and then we see right after that
[1:00:29] he goes and he builds the statue
[1:00:34] now what's going on here
[1:00:39] let me read to you
[1:00:40] before i start talking about it let me
[1:00:42] read you what brother branham said
[1:00:44] he says this in possessing the gate of
[1:00:47] the enemy after the trial
[1:00:53] he said let's take the hebrew children
[1:00:56] because they stood true and wouldn't
[1:00:58] tolerate with image worship
[1:01:01] they refused to bow down to an image
[1:01:03] that the king of the nation had made it
[1:01:05] was made after a holy man too the image
[1:01:08] of daniel
[1:01:12] so
[1:01:13] it's it's in perfect order in the bible
[1:01:15] so this statue
[1:01:17] that this king nebuchadnezzar puts up is
[1:01:21] of the prophet
[1:01:22] is of the holy man
[1:01:26] brother braham goes on showed that the
[1:01:27] gentile race was brought in under the
[1:01:30] false side of worshipping an image of a
[1:01:32] holy man
[1:01:34] it goes out the same way
[1:01:36] when people will be forced to worship
[1:01:38] images of people
[1:01:41] it come in by revelation of daniel being
[1:01:43] able to interpret the word
[1:01:45] that was wrote in the handwriting of the
[1:01:46] wall that's the way it come in
[1:01:48] and that's the way it goes out the same
[1:01:50] way of the image
[1:01:52] of the gentile
[1:01:54] so we we see that
[1:01:56] that this nebuchadnezzar he he
[1:01:59] builds this image and he he fashions it
[1:02:03] exactly how he thinks this holy man is
[1:02:06] or should be
[1:02:08] he builds it its shoulders were this
[1:02:10] wide it was this tall its head looked
[1:02:11] like this its feet its its legs looked
[1:02:14] like this the feet look looked like that
[1:02:16] it was in this perfective image of
[1:02:19] nebuchadnezzar's idea of what a holy man
[1:02:22] should be
[1:02:24] and then he says this
[1:02:27] he says if you don't
[1:02:31] do what i say if you don't worship this
[1:02:34] image that i have created in my own mind
[1:02:37] if you don't worship this
[1:02:40] then you're going to die
[1:02:43] and today we would say then you're going
[1:02:46] to be cast out then i'm going to
[1:02:48] disfellowship you i'm going to draw my
[1:02:51] circle
[1:02:53] with you outside if you don't see things
[1:02:55] the way i see them
[1:02:57] so so this great image was was set up
[1:03:00] and
[1:03:01] nebuchadnezzar made the decree if you
[1:03:03] don't follow the way i've set up church
[1:03:05] if you don't follow the way i worship if
[1:03:07] you don't follow my image of the prophet
[1:03:09] if you don't follow the way that i think
[1:03:11] then you're out
[1:03:14] then we have separation and what do we
[1:03:16] have today
[1:03:17] we have all of these different different
[1:03:19] separations within
[1:03:21] the message that was brought by a holy
[1:03:24] man
[1:03:25] a man of god
[1:03:27] a prophet
[1:03:29] a great prophet
[1:03:32] and we we see that same spirit carrying
[1:03:34] on today
[1:03:37] and then there was three three of these
[1:03:38] young men that helped daniel pray
[1:03:41] they decided
[1:03:43] we can't do it
[1:03:46] we cannot fall down and worship this
[1:03:48] image we can't do what you're telling us
[1:03:50] to because this is off the word
[1:03:53] we are taught by the prophet moses that
[1:03:56] we are not to lift any man up above god
[1:04:00] so we're not going to do it
[1:04:02] it kindle nebuchadnezzar's anger
[1:04:05] you do it the way that i say it
[1:04:08] because in nebuchadnezzar's
[1:04:10] mind like all of us if they don't do it
[1:04:13] they're saying i'm wrong
[1:04:16] and they're not they're not conforming
[1:04:17] the way i think that things should be
[1:04:21] so then
[1:04:22] nebuchadnezzar his anger gets gets all
[1:04:25] fired up he says heat that fiery furnace
[1:04:27] seven times harder and throw them guys
[1:04:30] in there
[1:04:31] and the lord delivered them
[1:04:33] we we know the story it's one of the
[1:04:36] most famous stories we learned from our
[1:04:37] kids coming up
[1:04:40] but we see that spirit
[1:04:43] of conforming to these images and it's a
[1:04:46] religious spirit
[1:04:48] it's a
[1:04:49] the the statue of daniel was a religious
[1:04:51] spirit
[1:04:53] it was a religious object
[1:04:56] so
[1:04:57] if we fast forward about 600 years
[1:05:01] we have the jewish religion has been
[1:05:05] fractured
[1:05:07] into different
[1:05:09] sects and organizations and groups
[1:05:13] we have this group called the pharisees
[1:05:16] who they were the local pastors
[1:05:18] but aaron we would be like a pharisee
[1:05:20] back then i mean if they had groups we
[1:05:23] wouldn't be i mean we'd be out of that
[1:05:24] mess but but that would be the pastor of
[1:05:27] a local church like this
[1:05:29] is a pharisee and the ministers of the
[1:05:31] local church so for the lyle brother
[1:05:33] peter
[1:05:34] and i we would we would be
[1:05:36] like these ministers
[1:05:38] in that group
[1:05:39] and then
[1:05:41] there were
[1:05:42] the sadducees and the sadducees they
[1:05:45] were too good for everybody man
[1:05:47] they worked in the temple they were the
[1:05:49] high priests they they
[1:05:52] they weren't didn't want to dirty their
[1:05:54] hands with the common people that the
[1:05:56] that the pharisees did
[1:05:58] and they disagreed and they fought like
[1:06:00] cats and dogs
[1:06:01] the the sadducees they didn't think that
[1:06:03] there was a resurrection the pharisees
[1:06:05] oh no there was a resurrection and they
[1:06:07] argued about the scriptures and then
[1:06:08] when they look at the scriptures and
[1:06:10] this will be a common theme when they
[1:06:11] would look at the scriptures they would
[1:06:13] only see what they wanted to see
[1:06:16] and then there was this other group
[1:06:17] there wasn't just pharisees and
[1:06:18] sadducees there was this other group
[1:06:20] called the essenes and these essenes
[1:06:22] they were the self-righteous ones
[1:06:25] they were the kind of the
[1:06:26] the right wing cult
[1:06:29] and they were out in the desert and they
[1:06:31] afford their they formed their own
[1:06:32] communes
[1:06:34] and they lived a life
[1:06:36] in in in their way that they didn't want
[1:06:39] to
[1:06:40] they didn't want to mix with anybody
[1:06:41] they completely separated from the world
[1:06:43] so they were out doing their thing out
[1:06:45] there and all of them hating each other
[1:06:49] and all of them claiming moses
[1:06:52] all of them
[1:06:54] reading this bible
[1:06:57] and believing it
[1:06:59] and using it against each other
[1:07:02] forming their images
[1:07:04] and they had their images and
[1:07:06] these images of christianity that they
[1:07:09] had
[1:07:12] the messiah
[1:07:15] that was supposed to come had to come
[1:07:17] according to their way of thinking
[1:07:21] they weren't
[1:07:23] they weren't able to flex
[1:07:25] a little bit they weren't able to bend
[1:07:28] and then when this man came
[1:07:31] he was nothing
[1:07:33] that fit into their images of
[1:07:35] christianity he didn't fit in with the
[1:07:36] eseems he didn't fit in with the
[1:07:38] sadducees he didn't fit in with the
[1:07:39] pharisees he was totally different than
[1:07:41] all of theirs came according perfectly
[1:07:43] according to the word
[1:07:45] but not according to their images let's
[1:07:47] turn to
[1:07:49] matthew
[1:07:50] chapter 5
[1:07:52] verse 43.
[1:08:00] and this is jesus
[1:08:01] talking
[1:08:04] now watch he's about to tear down one of
[1:08:05] their images here
[1:08:07] he says this
[1:08:08] matthew 5 43 you have heard that it had
[1:08:11] been said thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:08:14] and hate thine enemy
[1:08:16] whoa what happened to eye for an eye
[1:08:18] no no we've never heard anything like
[1:08:20] this it sounds so normal to us because
[1:08:21] we are christians but that didn't that
[1:08:23] wasn't normal to them
[1:08:25] that's not that's not the way we do
[1:08:27] things we kill people
[1:08:29] if they're not jewish
[1:08:31] we fight them but then jesus says here
[1:08:34] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[1:08:36] thy enemy
[1:08:39] but i say unto you love your enemies
[1:08:42] bless them that curse you
[1:08:45] do good to them that hate you
[1:08:48] and pray for them
[1:08:50] which despisefully use you and persecute
[1:08:53] you
[1:08:54] they ever had to be thinking uh uh
[1:08:57] i'm not going for this new doctrine you
[1:08:59] know this this guy out there preaching
[1:09:02] that you know he's got strange stuff
[1:09:04] that doesn't match up with our image of
[1:09:06] what moses talked
[1:09:09] book of mark chapter 2.
[1:09:13] in mark chapter 2 jesus goes to the
[1:09:15] house of his friend named matthew
[1:09:20] and it says this verse 15. thank you my
[1:09:22] brother it says and it came to pass that
[1:09:24] as jesus sat at mead in his house in
[1:09:27] matthew's house
[1:09:29] many publicans and sinners
[1:09:31] sat also together with jesus and his
[1:09:34] disciples for there were many and they
[1:09:36] followed him you can imagine what these
[1:09:38] pharisees were thinking look at this guy
[1:09:40] look at these sinners
[1:09:42] he's eating with these tax collectors
[1:09:44] and with these prostitutes and with
[1:09:45] these mentally with these mentally ill
[1:09:48] people
[1:09:49] how can he do that
[1:09:51] and there was mentally ill people there
[1:09:52] was a lady in mary magdalene
[1:09:55] she was delivered of seven demons
[1:09:57] that's mental illness friends
[1:10:01] it says here
[1:10:04] and when the scribes and the pharisees
[1:10:05] saw him eat with publicans and sinners
[1:10:08] they said unto his disciples how is it
[1:10:11] that he eateth and drinketh with
[1:10:13] publicans and sinners now i think i've
[1:10:14] said it before that a publican was
[1:10:17] probably worse than a sinner a
[1:10:19] publican's a tax collector so what a tax
[1:10:21] collector would do is he'd say okay
[1:10:24] brother wilson
[1:10:25] according to my ledger you owe 500 bucks
[1:10:29] for your taxes this year
[1:10:32] and then he'd look and he'd say that'll
[1:10:33] be a thousand dollars
[1:10:36] and brother wilson's like hey no i only
[1:10:38] owe 500 to rome and he says no
[1:10:41] he says you owe a thousand
[1:10:43] so matthew would take his 500 he would
[1:10:46] give it to the roman whatever and then
[1:10:48] he'd pocket the other 500.
[1:10:51] and if brother wilson couldn't pay
[1:10:53] i'm going to take your donkey
[1:10:55] i'm going to take your land
[1:10:57] that's what kind of a creep
[1:10:59] that these publicans were
[1:11:02] they were not good guys they were hated
[1:11:05] because of their dishonesty and matthew
[1:11:08] was one of them
[1:11:10] so they're eating
[1:11:12] they're eating in his house
[1:11:17] verse 17 when jesus
[1:11:20] heard it
[1:11:21] he saith to them
[1:11:23] and i love this
[1:11:24] they that are whole have no need of the
[1:11:26] physician
[1:11:28] but they that are sick
[1:11:30] i came not to call the righteous but
[1:11:32] sinners to repentance and i ask you
[1:11:35] think about who are the biggest sinners
[1:11:36] there in that room
[1:11:39] was it mary
[1:11:41] was it matthew
[1:11:43] or was it these pharisees yes
[1:11:46] was it was it these men this clergy
[1:11:49] group that thought they were better
[1:11:52] than jesus who was the biggest sinner
[1:11:54] they're the ones that should have fallen
[1:11:56] down at his feet
[1:11:57] and asked for forgiveness
[1:12:00] but it came
[1:12:01] to people like mary
[1:12:03] that would humble themselves as brother
[1:12:05] lyle talked about last week
[1:12:11] and the disciples of john
[1:12:14] and of the pharisees used to fast
[1:12:17] and they come and say unto him
[1:12:20] why do the disciples of john and of the
[1:12:22] pharisees fast
[1:12:24] but thy disciples fast not
[1:12:27] now these are some of the disciples of
[1:12:29] the forerunner of christ
[1:12:31] that they missed it
[1:12:32] they missed what john taught they should
[1:12:36] have been with jesus
[1:12:37] but they missed what the messenger said
[1:12:43] and jesus said unto them
[1:12:45] can the children of the bride chamber
[1:12:46] fast while the bridegroom is with them
[1:12:49] as long as they have the bridegroom with
[1:12:50] them they cannot fast
[1:12:52] but the days will come when the
[1:12:54] bridegroom shall be taken away from them
[1:12:57] and then shall they fast in those days
[1:13:00] no man also soweth a piece of new cloth
[1:13:03] on an old garment else the new piece
[1:13:05] that filleth it taketh away from the old
[1:13:08] and the rent is made worse
[1:13:11] and no man put a new wine into old
[1:13:13] bottles those bottles are not glass
[1:13:16] those bottles are animal skins
[1:13:28] else the new wine duff bursts the
[1:13:30] bottles and the wine is spilled and the
[1:13:32] bottles will be marred but the new wine
[1:13:35] must be put into new bottles
[1:13:38] it's put into the new bottles because
[1:13:40] the new wine has to it has to degas it
[1:13:42] has to has to swell
[1:13:44] a little bit and if you put it into
[1:13:46] something that doesn't have any flex to
[1:13:48] it
[1:13:49] it'll bust
[1:13:50] but if you put it in something that has
[1:13:52] some flex
[1:13:53] which is what i'm saying about this
[1:13:55] church
[1:13:57] and i think that we do have that
[1:14:00] that it can flex
[1:14:02] and it can move
[1:14:04] it can move as that wine starts to
[1:14:07] starts to ferment and that wine starts
[1:14:10] to really become good
[1:14:14] see where was i verse 23 and it came to
[1:14:16] pass that he went through the cornfields
[1:14:18] on the sabbath day and his disciples
[1:14:20] began as they went to pluck the ears of
[1:14:23] corn
[1:14:25] and the pharisees said unto him behold
[1:14:27] why do they on the sabbath day that
[1:14:30] which is not lawful now one thing if we
[1:14:33] go back to the book of deuteronomy or
[1:14:35] leviticus i don't remember where it's at
[1:14:38] but they weren't actually breaking any
[1:14:39] laws they were out there on the sabbath
[1:14:41] and they were taking the the ears of
[1:14:43] wheat and they were rubbing it in their
[1:14:44] hands
[1:14:46] to to wipe off the the shuck
[1:14:49] and then they they were left with seed
[1:14:51] and they were eating it but the law says
[1:14:53] they could do that on the sabbath but
[1:14:55] they couldn't take a bunch of it out
[1:14:57] of the field so they weren't actually
[1:14:59] breaking any laws
[1:15:04] but jesus he didn't address their
[1:15:06] mistake in the scriptures he showed them
[1:15:08] the meaning of the scriptures and this
[1:15:10] is important
[1:15:12] that we understand why these things are
[1:15:15] they're not just rules and regulations
[1:15:17] and laws like when we're teaching our
[1:15:19] children
[1:15:20] it's better to tell them why
[1:15:22] they're not allowed to do stuff don't
[1:15:24] touch that you're going to get burned
[1:15:27] you know or you don't just don't touch
[1:15:29] that first thing they're going to want
[1:15:30] to do is touch it
[1:15:31] but if you touch that you're going to
[1:15:33] get burned
[1:15:36] and it says here
[1:15:38] verse number 25 and he said unto them
[1:15:41] have you never read what david did and
[1:15:43] when he had need he was a hungered
[1:15:46] and when
[1:15:48] he
[1:15:49] and they that were with him
[1:15:51] how he went into the house of god in the
[1:15:53] days of abiather the high priest
[1:15:55] and did eat the shoe bread which is not
[1:15:58] lawful for to eat but for the priests
[1:16:00] and also gave also to them which were
[1:16:02] with him
[1:16:04] and he said unto them the sabbath was
[1:16:07] made for man
[1:16:09] and not man for the sabbath those
[1:16:11] pharisees probably swallowed their
[1:16:13] sermon right about that
[1:16:14] that did not make sense at all
[1:16:18] this is an ordinance from god that we
[1:16:20] are to keep this sabbath and jesus was
[1:16:22] saying listen he's like you don't
[1:16:24] understand the scriptures god gave this
[1:16:26] sabbath not for himself he's god he
[1:16:29] doesn't need it he gave the sabbath for
[1:16:32] us
[1:16:33] because god knew
[1:16:35] god knew that we're people
[1:16:38] god knew that if we didn't have this
[1:16:40] rule that we would be out on sunday
[1:16:42] working
[1:16:43] that we'd be missing church
[1:16:45] that we'd be
[1:16:47] that we wouldn't give god that time
[1:16:50] that will benefit us in the long run
[1:16:53] the time that every minute that we give
[1:16:55] to god we benefit over and over and if
[1:16:58] we take the time that we have for god
[1:17:01] and we replace it with work or something
[1:17:03] else then we're going to suffer for it
[1:17:06] and that's why jesus says this he says
[1:17:09] the sabbath is for us
[1:17:12] it's not just a law we need to
[1:17:14] understand why that we do these things
[1:17:20] therefore the son of man
[1:17:22] is lord also of the sabbath you can
[1:17:25] imagine
[1:17:26] when he said that
[1:17:28] um
[1:17:29] what happened there
[1:17:33] and you know they probably attacked him
[1:17:36] and they looked at the scriptures
[1:17:38] through their denominational eyes
[1:17:41] through their eyes of these images that
[1:17:43] they've created over the years
[1:17:46] without the leading of the holy spirit
[1:17:49] and they used those scriptures against
[1:17:52] jesus
[1:17:53] and that's my point today
[1:17:56] is we need to be careful
[1:17:58] in taking this bible
[1:18:01] and interpreting it
[1:18:03] in ways that benefit us
[1:18:06] and we need to genuinely seek the lord
[1:18:09] and seek what he says in this word and
[1:18:11] what he he says through his prophet
[1:18:14] and that
[1:18:15] is how
[1:18:18] we listen to the word that's how we
[1:18:19] listen to the tapes
[1:18:21] and so often friends i think it's more
[1:18:23] often than not i think it's a lot more
[1:18:24] often than not that people are listening
[1:18:27] to tapes
[1:18:29] to further
[1:18:30] their narrative
[1:18:33] to to increase that image that they have
[1:18:36] of brother brown's message and they're
[1:18:38] ignoring what he's saying
[1:18:41] just as they did with jesus
[1:18:43] they took the word and they attacked him
[1:18:46] with the word the very word that was
[1:18:48] standing before them in the in the form
[1:18:50] of a man in jesus christ
[1:18:52] trying to attack him with that word
[1:18:55] and
[1:18:56] jesus came back with the word and he
[1:18:58] says no you're not even you're not
[1:19:00] understanding things
[1:19:02] this word is a blessing to us
[1:19:06] these tapes that we listen to the the
[1:19:08] message of the prophet it's a blessing
[1:19:11] to us
[1:19:12] it was given to us to help us through
[1:19:14] this life
[1:19:16] and so often we take
[1:19:18] the message and we beat people over the
[1:19:21] head and what do we do it drives them
[1:19:22] out of church
[1:19:24] and that's why we see we see many of our
[1:19:26] families and friends we say you know
[1:19:29] they're finished with it and they leave
[1:19:32] they leave because they never got the
[1:19:33] meaning of it in the first place
[1:19:36] this message is not a hammer it's not a
[1:19:39] baseball bat brother joe
[1:19:41] it's a blessing
[1:19:42] to help us just as the sabbath is the
[1:19:45] sabbath is a was a blessing to the
[1:19:47] people if they would have just taken it
[1:19:48] that way
[1:19:50] they uh
[1:19:51] but they didn't they
[1:19:53] they um they use it against each other
[1:19:56] there's a
[1:19:58] there's a story you've heard brother
[1:20:00] branham i think we've all probably heard
[1:20:01] it there's a sermon called as the eagle
[1:20:04] stirth up her nest you know you know
[1:20:05] that tape it it's it's a it's a
[1:20:07] wonderful story it's a story about about
[1:20:09] this this baby eagle that the farmer
[1:20:12] took the took the egg and he put it
[1:20:14] he put it underneath the chicken and the
[1:20:16] hatch the the
[1:20:18] the eagle and that eagle was just
[1:20:20] different
[1:20:21] than all the other chickens
[1:20:23] and he's out there and then and you know
[1:20:25] the story the the mama eagle's flying
[1:20:27] and she calls and the baby hears the
[1:20:29] call
[1:20:30] and
[1:20:31] and there's two people that listened to
[1:20:33] that sermon
[1:20:35] and one of them was fired up man
[1:20:38] after hearing that
[1:20:39] he did not like what brother branham
[1:20:41] said
[1:20:43] and and you know what he said he says he
[1:20:45] says you know what i don't appreciate
[1:20:47] him calling me a chicken
[1:20:51] and the other guy said
[1:20:53] he called me an eagle
[1:20:57] so it's the different ways that you're
[1:20:59] looking at it
[1:21:00] and i want to be and as i hear brother
[1:21:02] brandt i'm
[1:21:03] saying these things and i hear him
[1:21:05] condemning sin praise god
[1:21:08] that's for me that's for my family i
[1:21:11] want to live that way but then the other
[1:21:12] people are seeing how he's just he's
[1:21:14] legalistic he's casting me out he's
[1:21:16] doing all this no friends
[1:21:19] it's not that way
[1:21:20] and that's how the ministry has to
[1:21:22] present it
[1:21:24] and not a negative beating us over the
[1:21:26] head with it but saying that this is a
[1:21:28] blessing to us
[1:21:30] it's not an image that we have of
[1:21:32] christianity that you have to conform to
[1:21:35] it's something that will help you
[1:21:37] through life
[1:21:39] it'll it'll help it'll make you more
[1:21:40] honest it'll make you more successful
[1:21:44] it'll it'll make you a better person
[1:21:46] you'll be happier
[1:21:48] if you're following this word
[1:21:52] and uh i
[1:21:55] i had a
[1:21:56] friend
[1:21:57] i was over at his house
[1:22:00] and uh he was
[1:22:05] we were
[1:22:06] talking about the word and
[1:22:08] he says
[1:22:10] he says you know he says
[1:22:13] i don't like the spirit of our church is
[1:22:15] better than everybody else i can't stand
[1:22:17] that i don't and that's why i'm here
[1:22:19] that's another reason i hear i like the
[1:22:20] way that this church is we're not better
[1:22:23] than anybody we're just trying to get
[1:22:24] through this life we're just trying to
[1:22:26] get to the lord we're just trying to
[1:22:27] give our hearts to the lord we're we're
[1:22:29] trying to be right but then i see other
[1:22:32] other
[1:22:33] churches and they're like
[1:22:35] we're better sadducees
[1:22:37] were better
[1:22:38] and and this brother tells me he says he
[1:22:40] says you know he says our pastor
[1:22:43] he says and i i love the brother i love
[1:22:46] the pastor he says he says he's
[1:22:48] one of the main things he's not afraid
[1:22:49] to preach anything that brother branham
[1:22:52] preached
[1:22:53] he's not afraid to tackle anything and
[1:22:55] he starts telling me about the third
[1:22:57] poll and he starts telling me about the
[1:22:59] the the um
[1:23:01] the tent meeting and all these things
[1:23:03] and i was like praise the lord that's
[1:23:05] that's i believe that too
[1:23:07] and i had just been doing some research
[1:23:10] i just
[1:23:11] resigned my position of voice of god
[1:23:13] recordings and i was i just had
[1:23:15] was doing some research and i just
[1:23:17] happened to have some quotes up on my
[1:23:20] phone
[1:23:21] and i i said well i said let me read you
[1:23:24] something
[1:23:27] and there's this quote i didn't give it
[1:23:28] to you brother peter i'm sorry but it's
[1:23:30] i may have it says this and jehovah
[1:23:32] jirei 6102-26
[1:23:35] brother branham says this so it's a
[1:23:37] lesson to us tonight
[1:23:39] to keep our minds upon god
[1:23:42] regardless of what man says it is
[1:23:45] of what man it is let him be a cardinal
[1:23:49] priest prophet
[1:23:52] whatever he might be he is not immune
[1:23:54] from mistakes
[1:23:56] and error
[1:23:57] and even death and sin
[1:23:59] but there is one who is and that's jesus
[1:24:01] christ
[1:24:02] he is the one and then i read a few more
[1:24:05] um quotes
[1:24:08] about brother branham i was saying the
[1:24:10] prophets are not infallible
[1:24:12] prophets make mistakes i make mistakes
[1:24:14] and man
[1:24:16] did the claws come out
[1:24:19] he was upset that i was saying that
[1:24:22] to the fact to all the way to the point
[1:24:24] he says i don't want to hear that in my
[1:24:25] house and i was like brother i'm just
[1:24:26] reading what the prophet said you told
[1:24:29] me that everything is on the table that
[1:24:31] brother branham preached how come you
[1:24:34] don't believe that
[1:24:35] and he says well you just don't need to
[1:24:36] say it i said you're the one that told
[1:24:38] me that your pastor preaches everything
[1:24:39] brother branham said he's not afraid of
[1:24:41] anything so what's
[1:24:43] why am i wrong in doing this
[1:24:45] and he was so upset at me and i said you
[1:24:47] know what i said the difference between
[1:24:48] you and me
[1:24:51] is i believe everything brother branham
[1:24:52] said
[1:24:54] you claim to believe it but you have
[1:24:56] this image
[1:24:58] of the prophet that is not true
[1:25:01] that is not right
[1:25:04] and friends these images that we have
[1:25:08] they can lead us to destruction
[1:25:11] we need to focus on the one image and
[1:25:14] that's christ and then we need to
[1:25:16] conform to his image
[1:25:21] brother branham says this
[1:25:25] he says
[1:25:26] what i'm trying to say
[1:25:28] in influence 63 11 14. what i'm trying
[1:25:31] to say
[1:25:32] don't never lose your confidence
[1:25:35] don't let satan tell you evil about me
[1:25:38] because there's much
[1:25:40] but you keep that confidence
[1:25:43] because if you don't it won't happen
[1:25:46] don't look to me as a man i'm a man full
[1:25:49] of mistakes
[1:25:51] but look to what i'm trying look to what
[1:25:53] i'm saying about him
[1:25:56] it's him
[1:25:57] he's the one now there's a man i'll
[1:25:59] follow
[1:26:00] now there's a man that is why that god
[1:26:04] vindicated this man in such a way that's
[1:26:07] a that's the reason that god said i'm
[1:26:09] with him
[1:26:12] you listen to him
[1:26:14] and that's a man that i hold dear to my
[1:26:16] heart and that's a message that i hold
[1:26:18] dear to my heart a man that can say hey
[1:26:21] i make mistakes and he did
[1:26:23] you know i'm not i'm not infallible and
[1:26:25] he's not infallible but he was a man of
[1:26:28] god and he had a relationship with
[1:26:29] christ
[1:26:31] that i want
[1:26:34] i may not be able to do the things that
[1:26:35] he did
[1:26:36] i may not be able to to preach the
[1:26:38] gospel like he preached i may not be
[1:26:40] able to do the miracles that he did
[1:26:42] but i believe that i am entitled not
[1:26:44] entitled i believe that i do have the
[1:26:47] opportunity to have the same
[1:26:49] relationship with jesus christ as
[1:26:50] brother branham did
[1:26:52] i'm just i'm another one of his sons
[1:26:55] brother branham was one of
[1:26:57] one of god's sons and i'm another one
[1:27:00] and i don't lift either one of my
[1:27:02] children any higher than the other i
[1:27:03] love them both
[1:27:04] i love them both the same we can't brand
[1:27:07] we can't love any any one kid more than
[1:27:09] the other when it's not in us to do that
[1:27:11] and it's not in god to do it either
[1:27:15] i'm going to
[1:27:17] skip down to there was a there was a man
[1:27:20] a young man
[1:27:22] we call him the rich young ruler
[1:27:26] and
[1:27:27] he was a good man
[1:27:28] he came to church didn't miss service
[1:27:31] came to church he had position in the
[1:27:33] church he gave money to the church he he
[1:27:35] was he lived a good life
[1:27:38] and he came to jesus
[1:27:41] and he asked jesus
[1:27:43] he says this luke chapter 18 verse 18.
[1:27:48] and a certain ruler came to jesus and he
[1:27:51] asked him and he said good master
[1:27:54] what shall i do
[1:27:55] to inherit eternal life
[1:27:58] and jesus said to him why call us thou
[1:28:00] me good none is good save one that is
[1:28:02] god
[1:28:03] thou knowest the commandments do not
[1:28:05] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[1:28:08] do not bear false witness honor thy
[1:28:10] father and thy mother
[1:28:12] now jesus was repeating the law to him
[1:28:14] which he knew very well
[1:28:18] and he had kept himself from doing all
[1:28:20] these things
[1:28:21] but he hadn't fully surrendered
[1:28:24] and in another place where it tells the
[1:28:27] story jesus looked on this young man and
[1:28:30] he loved him
[1:28:33] jesus wanted
[1:28:35] this young man
[1:28:37] to prosper
[1:28:38] he wanted this young man
[1:28:41] to go to heaven and to be with him in
[1:28:44] fact
[1:28:46] this young man may have even been one of
[1:28:47] the disciples
[1:28:49] if he would have done what jesus said
[1:28:52] but he missed that opportunity
[1:28:55] and jesus saw that he was going to miss
[1:28:57] this opportunity
[1:29:02] and verse 21 and he said
[1:29:05] the rich young ruler this young man said
[1:29:07] all these i've kept from my youth up
[1:29:09] now when jesus heard these things he
[1:29:12] said unto him yet thou lackest one thing
[1:29:15] sell all that thou hast and distribute
[1:29:17] it unto the poor and thou shalt have
[1:29:19] treasure in heaven and come follow me
[1:29:22] and when he heard this he was very
[1:29:24] sorrowful for he was rich
[1:29:27] he had an image in his mind he had an
[1:29:29] image of christianity in his mind this
[1:29:31] rich rugged ruler did he said well i can
[1:29:34] give
[1:29:35] and i can continue with my job and i can
[1:29:37] continue
[1:29:38] to
[1:29:39] to prosper and i can have all my stuff
[1:29:42] and he looked at maybe he looked at
[1:29:43] peter and john
[1:29:45] and he's like
[1:29:47] look at their clothes
[1:29:50] you know the car that they drive in
[1:29:51] today's words
[1:29:53] look at these guys i don't want to be
[1:29:54] like that
[1:29:56] i don't have to give up everything
[1:29:58] i'm a good person i come to church i
[1:30:01] believe the message
[1:30:03] i believe the message
[1:30:06] i'm a good person
[1:30:08] i don't have to give it up but there's
[1:30:10] one thing that jesus saw that was
[1:30:12] standing between this young man
[1:30:15] and salvation
[1:30:17] or eternal death never-ending torment
[1:30:22] everlasting torment i think the bible
[1:30:23] says
[1:30:25] and that was
[1:30:26] surrender to me
[1:30:29] and he gave him something hard to do
[1:30:32] and the young man the church-goer that
[1:30:34] he was how good he was and how he gave
[1:30:37] to the church and he showed up every
[1:30:39] every day he was a religious man
[1:30:42] he went to hell
[1:30:45] and he is in hell today
[1:30:47] that good man
[1:30:49] he's in hell today
[1:30:52] and i think
[1:30:53] are we
[1:30:55] willing
[1:30:56] as a people
[1:30:58] are we willing to give up
[1:31:01] our images
[1:31:03] the things that we were raised with
[1:31:07] check those things
[1:31:09] check those things with the word it may
[1:31:11] seem ever so right
[1:31:13] my testimony
[1:31:15] is uh i had an experience
[1:31:18] one night i was working late at voice of
[1:31:20] god
[1:31:21] um stephanie and the kids were in
[1:31:25] tucson i think it was january they we
[1:31:27] always come to tucson for christmas
[1:31:30] stephanie and the kids were still here
[1:31:32] i went back to go back to work in
[1:31:35] jeffersonville
[1:31:37] and since there was nobody home at the
[1:31:39] house i just worked late i didn't have a
[1:31:40] reason to go home so i just i just
[1:31:42] worked into the night because i had a
[1:31:43] lot to do
[1:31:45] and i had an experience
[1:31:48] with the lord
[1:31:49] and i was driving home
[1:31:53] from work
[1:31:55] and i said
[1:31:56] lord i said i was raised in this message
[1:32:01] my grandpa was probably if it wasn't his
[1:32:04] best friend it was one of his two best
[1:32:06] friends in the whole world
[1:32:07] i grew up sitting around the supper
[1:32:09] table hearing story after story about
[1:32:12] the prophet i've been so blessed
[1:32:16] but lord
[1:32:20] i am so
[1:32:22] full
[1:32:23] of
[1:32:24] doctrines i'm full of them
[1:32:28] and i was thinking about about the way
[1:32:30] that i thought
[1:32:32] of the ministry
[1:32:34] and how i thought the ministry was so
[1:32:36] evil what do they think they're doing
[1:32:37] trying to preach the gospel when you
[1:32:38] have a tape that you can play
[1:32:41] and
[1:32:43] i was like lord
[1:32:44] i have all these doctrines
[1:32:46] and
[1:32:47] i've been just listening to these tapes
[1:32:51] just to prove my doctrines
[1:32:54] and friends i'm not just saying that for
[1:32:56] me
[1:32:58] every single person in here now
[1:33:01] should be thinking on those same lines
[1:33:05] and i said lord
[1:33:07] i've been i've been listening to these
[1:33:09] tapes i've been following i've been
[1:33:10] reading my bible and all i see in this
[1:33:13] bible is
[1:33:16] listen to the prophet in him only
[1:33:19] all that i see in this word is that
[1:33:23] everything that's in me
[1:33:24] i see that image
[1:33:27] and i said lord i'm wrong
[1:33:29] i'm wrong
[1:33:31] i'm full of these doctrines and i made
[1:33:33] this commitment this is in 2012. i made
[1:33:36] this commitment i said lord i'm going to
[1:33:37] relearn your message
[1:33:40] i said i'm going to relearn it in the
[1:33:42] spirit that it was given
[1:33:45] and brother scott i've changed
[1:33:47] the way that i think
[1:33:49] because i believe that i was listening
[1:33:52] to it now
[1:33:54] under the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:33:56] and not so much under the anointing of
[1:33:58] the image that i had in my mind about
[1:34:01] how
[1:34:03] life
[1:34:04] should be lived
[1:34:06] and how that we should worship
[1:34:09] and uh
[1:34:10] i'm
[1:34:13] let's uh let's go to first corinthians
[1:34:14] chapter one
[1:34:22] now if we we read in acts chapter 2
[1:34:25] and there beyond we see that the
[1:34:28] disciples had been filled with the holy
[1:34:29] spirit they were driven in driven away
[1:34:34] they were being persecuted
[1:34:36] and they were driven to the lord they
[1:34:38] were in one one place in one accord and
[1:34:41] the holy spirit fell and they were there
[1:34:43] was such beautiful unity in the book of
[1:34:46] acts and we see the unity and we see
[1:34:49] things happening and i really believe
[1:34:51] it's because of the unity there's a
[1:34:53] reason that it says
[1:34:55] in acts chapter 4 the place that they
[1:34:57] were in the whole wall shook as they
[1:35:00] were worshiping and it says they were of
[1:35:02] one heart and one soul
[1:35:05] they were all together they loved each
[1:35:07] other
[1:35:08] they were together in this battle
[1:35:11] and that's i believe that is why that we
[1:35:13] see such miracles that have happened in
[1:35:16] the book of acts
[1:35:18] is because they were united
[1:35:20] they were united not so much in their
[1:35:22] doctrine but they were united in their
[1:35:24] purpose and they were united in christ
[1:35:27] and then paul comes on the scene a
[1:35:28] little bit later and paul is part of
[1:35:30] this great movement of unity and part of
[1:35:34] spreading the gospel and then something
[1:35:37] starts to happen
[1:35:40] paul starts seeing division
[1:35:43] he starts seeing separation among the
[1:35:46] people
[1:35:48] first corinthians chapter 1
[1:35:52] and paul is going to do everything that
[1:35:53] he can to stop it
[1:35:58] now
[1:36:00] i uh
[1:36:01] in a lot of my my education in my past
[1:36:05] i write
[1:36:06] and i've had a lot of schooling and how
[1:36:09] to write and and how to express yourself
[1:36:11] in words to the written word and one
[1:36:14] thing that's a cardinal sin
[1:36:16] of writing that is repeating yourself
[1:36:19] you don't want to say
[1:36:21] you don't want to say the the tucson
[1:36:23] tabernacle is located on stone and the
[1:36:26] tucson tabernacle is this big and the
[1:36:29] tucson tabernacle is this and this and
[1:36:31] this you want to say and the tucson
[1:36:33] tabernacle is located on stone and it
[1:36:36] is here and it in it or brother scott
[1:36:39] winter is is lives in fairbanks alaska
[1:36:41] and brother scott winner is this and
[1:36:42] brother scott winner is this you say he
[1:36:44] you define it and then you say he unless
[1:36:48] brother peter when you're writing unless
[1:36:50] you are trying to make a very pronounced
[1:36:52] point
[1:36:54] then
[1:36:55] you repeat yourself
[1:36:57] and you're jabbing it
[1:36:59] into the to the listener
[1:37:01] and you're saying i'm i know you know
[1:37:03] what i'm saying but i'm really going to
[1:37:05] stick this to you and here's what paul
[1:37:07] says now listen to the word that he
[1:37:09] repeats
[1:37:11] paul called to be an apostle of jesus
[1:37:13] christ through the will of god in
[1:37:15] sosthenes our brother unto the church of
[1:37:18] god which is a corinth to them that are
[1:37:20] sanctified in christ jesus
[1:37:23] called to be saints with all that in
[1:37:26] every place call upon the name of jesus
[1:37:28] christ our lord both theirs and ours
[1:37:32] grace be unto you and peace from god our
[1:37:34] father and from the lord jesus christ
[1:37:38] i thank god always on your behalf for
[1:37:40] the grace of god which is given you by
[1:37:43] jesus christ that in everything you are
[1:37:46] enriched in him in all utterance and all
[1:37:49] knowledge even as the testimony of
[1:37:51] christ was confirmed in you so that you
[1:37:54] so that ye come behind in no gift
[1:37:57] waiting from the coming of our lord
[1:37:59] jesus christ who shall also confirm you
[1:38:02] unto the end that ye may be blameless in
[1:38:04] the day of our lord jesus christ god is
[1:38:08] faithful by whom you were called unto
[1:38:11] the fellowship of his son jesus christ
[1:38:14] our lord paul is making a very
[1:38:16] pronounced point there don't you think
[1:38:18] he repeats himself over and over and
[1:38:20] over paul was a very educated man
[1:38:23] paul was obviously a very good writer
[1:38:27] paul was good at what he did and he was
[1:38:30] making a point right now there's
[1:38:32] pronouns in every language
[1:38:35] and then this was this was written
[1:38:37] probably in greek and there's pronouns
[1:38:40] in greek because it sounds funny to do
[1:38:42] it otherwise but paul's making a point
[1:38:44] here
[1:38:46] and he says this in verse 10
[1:38:48] now i beseech you brethren by the name
[1:38:50] of our lord jesus christ that you all
[1:38:53] speak the same thing
[1:38:55] and that there be no divisions among you
[1:38:57] but that ye be perfectly joined together
[1:39:00] in the same mind and in the same
[1:39:02] judgment
[1:39:03] for it hath been declared unto me of you
[1:39:06] my brethren by them which are the house
[1:39:08] of chloe that there are contentions
[1:39:10] among you
[1:39:12] now this
[1:39:13] i say that every one of you
[1:39:17] let me say that again
[1:39:19] now this i say that every one of you
[1:39:22] now was paul saying that every single
[1:39:24] person i don't know but he is making a
[1:39:26] point saying that
[1:39:28] a lot of you
[1:39:31] now this i say that every one of you
[1:39:33] saith
[1:39:34] i am of paul
[1:39:36] and i have apollos
[1:39:37] and i have cephas
[1:39:39] and i have christ look at the divisions
[1:39:41] that's creeping in the church even in
[1:39:42] the early church
[1:39:46] is christ divided
[1:39:48] was paul crucified for you or were you
[1:39:50] baptized in the name of paul
[1:39:55] he's saying
[1:39:57] don't go there
[1:39:59] friends don't fight
[1:40:01] don't don't argue on these doctrines
[1:40:04] some say peter some say paul some say
[1:40:06] have apollos paul throws himself right
[1:40:09] in there he says don't do it
[1:40:11] be brethren be united
[1:40:14] we are one
[1:40:16] peter and paul obviously
[1:40:18] had contention between them on
[1:40:21] circumcision and on on the different
[1:40:23] things they argue paul said i was stood
[1:40:25] into his face because he was to be
[1:40:26] blamed
[1:40:28] but they were still united they were
[1:40:30] still one and so much that even peter in
[1:40:32] his in his epistle one of the last
[1:40:34] things that he wrote he said listen to
[1:40:35] paul
[1:40:37] because people people
[1:40:38] they struggle with what paul says but
[1:40:40] listen to him
[1:40:45] and that's
[1:40:46] what images get us friends
[1:40:49] that's that's where in closing that's
[1:40:51] that's where we we develop these images
[1:40:54] and we want people to conform to them
[1:40:57] and we're we're not
[1:40:59] we're not right in doing them we're not
[1:41:01] writing and doing it to our children we
[1:41:03] want to raise them right we want to
[1:41:04] raise them in the image of god
[1:41:07] but don't force these things on each
[1:41:10] other
[1:41:11] and sisters if you come and brother matt
[1:41:13] don't don't
[1:41:16] impose that image let's make sure that
[1:41:18] we have the right image or we could be
[1:41:20] like the rich young ruler and find
[1:41:22] ourselves lost
[1:41:24] because our image that we had wasn't
[1:41:26] exactly the way it was yeah
[1:41:29] there's a story
[1:41:31] about a man
[1:41:34] his name is
[1:41:36] that's about 150 years ago
[1:41:38] his name is nox singh
[1:41:41] and he and his family he had two boys
[1:41:45] a wife and he and his family lived in
[1:41:47] india
[1:41:48] and they lived among
[1:41:51] head hunting tribes
[1:41:53] very very evil people
[1:41:57] that that noxing lived with
[1:41:59] that he was raised with
[1:42:02] and
[1:42:03] he had this image i'm sure
[1:42:06] that the way that they lived this
[1:42:08] warring and fighting that this was okay
[1:42:12] this is just the way i was raised
[1:42:14] there was a revival going on in wales
[1:42:17] over in england
[1:42:19] and
[1:42:20] a few of them and it kind of spread
[1:42:22] around the world and a few of these
[1:42:24] brothers went up to northeast india
[1:42:28] and they started witnessing
[1:42:30] about this man jesus christ
[1:42:34] and they got a hold of noxin
[1:42:37] and they started talking
[1:42:39] about how jesus taught these things and
[1:42:42] jesus said to love your enemies and it
[1:42:44] just resonated with his spirit
[1:42:49] and he just said that this man jesus is
[1:42:52] right
[1:42:53] and even though he had been raised with
[1:42:56] this image
[1:42:58] of cre of
[1:43:00] how life should be and as long as we can
[1:43:03] see it he didn't see it was wrong they
[1:43:05] didn't see it was wrong
[1:43:07] he gave that up
[1:43:09] he forsook that image
[1:43:12] and
[1:43:14] the people
[1:43:15] started coming to him in the village
[1:43:18] and they started saying hey what are you
[1:43:19] doing and he says i'm not i don't i
[1:43:22] don't do that anymore i'm not part of of
[1:43:25] this way of life
[1:43:27] i want to love my enemies now and
[1:43:29] they're like no our enemies could attack
[1:43:32] our village we don't that's not the way
[1:43:33] we live what are you what are you
[1:43:35] talking
[1:43:37] and he says i'm a christian now
[1:43:40] he says i believe in this man jesus
[1:43:42] christ
[1:43:43] so the story started propagating and it
[1:43:46] came to the chief
[1:43:48] the head guy
[1:43:50] and he goes
[1:43:53] to noxing
[1:43:55] and he says he says
[1:43:58] what are you doing
[1:44:00] everything that you've been raised with
[1:44:03] he says how dare you
[1:44:05] bring this strange thing into our
[1:44:08] village and you're telling other people
[1:44:09] about it
[1:44:10] he says how dare you
[1:44:13] do that
[1:44:14] not seeing answered
[1:44:16] and he says
[1:44:18] i've decided to follow jesus
[1:44:20] i'm not turning back
[1:44:23] and the warring tribe that this was he
[1:44:26] brings maxine's two sons his two boys
[1:44:31] he brings them up before him
[1:44:35] and he says he says this
[1:44:38] he says will you recant
[1:44:41] of this nonsense
[1:44:43] that you that you that you have been
[1:44:44] taught and you're bringing into our
[1:44:46] village
[1:44:47] [Music]
[1:44:48] and he has
[1:44:50] the men draw the bows
[1:44:53] to shoot at these two boys
[1:44:56] and oxen says this
[1:44:58] he says
[1:44:59] the world behind me the cross before me
[1:45:04] no turning back
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:07] they pull the bulls back
[1:45:10] and they shoot the two boys
[1:45:12] kill him kill him dead
[1:45:15] so then the the village elder the chief
[1:45:18] he brings his wife before noxine
[1:45:22] and he says now
[1:45:24] will you recant of this nonsense
[1:45:28] maxine says
[1:45:30] the cross before me
[1:45:33] the world behind me
[1:45:36] no
[1:45:36] turning back
[1:45:39] you draw the bow
[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:45] you can imagine how noxine felt
[1:45:50] and then he brings knox seeing it up
[1:45:55] and he says now
[1:45:56] will you recant
[1:46:00] and he looked at the chief and he says
[1:46:02] these words
[1:46:05] he said will you decide now
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:08] to follow
[1:46:10] jesus no turning back
[1:46:14] and they killed them
[1:46:16] they killed oxy
[1:46:19] but it's stuck
[1:46:20] in this chief's
[1:46:22] mind
[1:46:23] and it's stuck in the p the people's
[1:46:25] mind how this man
[1:46:28] could follow this man that had been dead
[1:46:29] for 2000 years
[1:46:32] and he could throw down all the images
[1:46:33] that he had grown up with
[1:46:37] and they thought about it
[1:46:39] and starting with the chief
[1:46:43] the one that ordered the execution
[1:46:46] starting with the chief
[1:46:48] he gave his heart to the lord jesus
[1:46:51] and the whole village followed one after
[1:46:54] the other after the other but scott they
[1:46:56] all gave their hearts to the lord jesus
[1:46:58] and now we have that song
[1:47:00] i have decided to follow jesus
[1:47:04] and friends we need to set aside all of
[1:47:06] our images that we have
[1:47:09] and we need to follow jesus
[1:47:12] god sent a prophet to show us these
[1:47:14] things
[1:47:16] and we've taken what he's said and we've
[1:47:18] messed it all up
[1:47:20] we've got to take what he said we've got
[1:47:22] to apply it to our lives and we've got
[1:47:24] to get back
[1:47:25] to christ
[1:47:26] his whole commission was to turn the
[1:47:29] heart of the children
[1:47:32] back to that
[1:47:33] of the pentecostal fathers
[1:47:37] and friends that's what we have to do so
