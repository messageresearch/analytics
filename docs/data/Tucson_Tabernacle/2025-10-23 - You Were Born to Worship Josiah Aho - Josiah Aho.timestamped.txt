[0:05] Old
[0:06] story
[0:08] how a savior came from glory.
[0:13] How he gave his life from Calvary
[0:18] to save a rich like me.
[0:22] And I heard about his groaning
[0:27] of his precious blood atoning.
[0:32] And I repented
[0:35] of my sins and won the victory.
[0:41] And oh victory
[0:43] in Jesus
[0:46] my savior
[0:48] forever.
[0:50] He saw me and he bought me with his
[0:56] redeeming
[0:57] blood
[0:59] and he loved me.
[1:02] I knew him and all my love is to him and
[1:08] he plunged me to victory
[1:13] beneath the cleansing flood.
[1:17] And I heard about his healing
[1:22] of his cleansing power revealing
[1:26] and how he made the lame to walk again.
[1:31] And he caused the blind to see.
[1:35] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
[1:40] come and heal my broken
[1:42] spirit."
[1:44] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[1:50] the victory.
[1:53] And oh victory
[1:55] in Jesus
[1:57] my savior
[2:00] forever.
[2:02] And he saw me and he bought me with his
[2:08] redeeming blood.
[2:10] And he loved me.
[2:13] I knew him and all my love is due to
[2:18] him. And he plunged me to victory
[2:24] beneath the cleansing flood.
[2:28] And I heard about a mansion
[2:33] he's built for me in glory.
[2:37] And I heard about the streets of gold
[2:42] beyond the crystal sea
[2:46] and about the angels
[2:49] singing
[2:50] of the old redemption
[2:53] story.
[2:55] And some sweet day I'll sing up there
[2:59] the song of victory.
[3:03] And oh victory
[3:06] in Jesus
[3:08] my savior
[3:10] forever.
[3:12] He s on me and he b me with his redeeing
[3:19] blood and he loved me.
[3:23] I knew him and all my love is due him
[3:29] and he plunged me to victory
[3:34] beneath the cleansing flood.
[3:38] Amen. Are you happy to be in church on a
[3:40] Wednesday night? Amen.

[3:53] in the table spread in splendor
[3:57] and someone standing by the open door.

[4:18] before.

[4:34] at the door.

[6:33] If we could stand tonight.
[6:38] For a long time, I've traveled
[6:43] and down a dark, lonely road.
[6:49] My heart was so heavy and sin I sank
[6:54] low.
[6:57] And then I heard about Jesus.

[8:10] that's taking its flight.
[8:15] Like a blind man, that guy gave back his
[8:20] side.
[8:23] Like the poor wretched beggar
[8:29] has found fortune and fame.
[8:34] I'm so glad that I found out he would
[8:39] bring me out through his holy name.

[12:47] The the plague
[12:50] has struck the Tucson tabernacle in the
[12:52] form of the flu. There are so many
[12:55] people down with the flu. Um Justin
[12:59] Baggley
[13:01] writes asks for prayer for stomach pain
[13:04] and discomfort.
[13:06] Um Jordan Peterson
[13:10] stomach pain discomfort really really
[13:13] really suffering. Brother Jordan is
[13:15] brother Dan Numer and family also
[13:18] suffering with the flu. Sister Kathy
[13:20] Dooall has got a double dose of it.
[13:23] She's really really down and and really
[13:25] in a lot of pain with her stomach. Looks
[13:28] like it's the same
[13:31] little bug. And uh I quoted to brother
[13:35] Ed. Brother Brandham said that you can
[13:39] take medicine
[13:41] and you can have the flu for seven days
[13:43] or you can not take medicine, you can
[13:47] have it for a week.
[13:50] [Music]
[13:56] Um so take medicine if you want or or
[14:00] don't take medicine if you want but one
[14:02] thing that we can do is we can most
[14:03] surely pray that that's the best thing
[14:06] that we can do. Pray friends pray for
[14:09] the church. Um we uh also the um
[14:15] we're going to start another
[14:16] construction project.
[14:19] Um we're going to uh very soon we're
[14:22] going to start ripping out the concrete
[14:24] in the uh
[14:26] back of the church that we use for the
[14:28] front of the church. And um we're going
[14:31] to build a place that we can fellowship
[14:34] more. I see all the brothers and sisters
[14:36] out there and the sun beating down on
[14:38] them and I just feel so bad about it.
[14:42] So, we are going to um rip out all the
[14:46] concrete and we are going to build a
[14:49] really nice place for us to fellowship
[14:51] for large large crowds to fellowship
[14:55] back here. We're going to John is
[14:57] designing an awning that's going to go
[15:00] over and cover a large portion of it
[15:03] that we can relax in the shade there.
[15:06] And then we're going to redo the
[15:08] concrete so it drains better.
[15:10] looking forward to that. I know it's
[15:12] going to be another construction
[15:14] project, but the Lord willing, Brother
[15:15] John promised me and I'm going to hold
[15:17] it hold him to it that we can have it
[15:18] done before our church dedication in
[15:21] November. So, yeah, we want to want to
[15:23] get that done.
[15:26] Friends, everything needs prayer. The
[15:30] sick need prayer. These decisions that
[15:33] we're making, they need prayer.
[15:36] Our our jobs and and our country, it
[15:39] just
[15:41] Prayer is so important. We really need
[15:44] to go to the Lord in prayer every day
[15:47] and go sincerely
[15:50] and whatever need that that you have. Of
[15:53] course, you're not going to forget that,
[15:54] but don't forget the needs that other
[15:56] people have, too.
[15:58] Remember, when we pray,
[16:01] we are talking to the creator of the
[16:05] universe.
[16:06] We are talking to the one that there are
[16:09] no limits in what he can do. I He
[16:12] created the earth. He created the world.
[16:16] He created He created the trees and he
[16:18] created the ocean and he created us. And
[16:21] we get to talk to him. this one that
[16:26] there's a hundred million angels
[16:32] circling around his throne singing holy,
[16:35] holy, holy unto the Lord and they're
[16:38] looking at at each other in awe and
[16:41] they're they're rejoicing over the power
[16:44] of this God and his greatness.
[16:47] And it I believe
[16:50] that God in all of his great greatness,
[16:54] I believe the greatest thing
[16:57] that God has is love.
[17:00] The Apostle John said, "For God is love.
[17:04] He loves us and he's looking down on us
[17:06] right now.
[17:08] Let's bow our heads." And as we bow our
[17:11] heads,
[17:13] just think.
[17:15] The creator of heavens and the earth,
[17:17] the almighty God, is looking down. And
[17:20] he cares
[17:22] about what's on each of our hearts.
[17:26] Remember these prayer requests. All
[17:28] those that have the flu,
[17:30] for wisdom, for the leadership in the
[17:32] church.
[17:34] And if you have a request upon your
[17:36] heart that's for yourself, for someone
[17:39] else,
[17:41] make it known with an uplifted hand
[17:43] before our Lord. Say, "Lord, here's my
[17:45] hand."
[17:47] And you know the need that I have or
[17:50] that that I'm bringing to you for
[17:52] someone else,
[17:54] Lord God Almighty.
[17:57] Hard to think that
[18:00] now we are talking
[18:02] to the great creator, the one
[18:05] who created the heavens and the earth.
[18:07] And and then the one that saw it fit
[18:12] to humble himself
[18:15] come down and be born in a manger,
[18:18] live a spotless life,
[18:22] overcome all the temptations of the
[18:23] devil, and then
[18:25] give himself to be nailed on the cross,
[18:29] die for our sins.
[18:33] or to think that
[18:35] the creator, the almighty God
[18:40] became our savior.
[18:43] And Lord, you thought enough of me.
[18:46] You thought enough of each each person
[18:48] here to die
[18:51] for our sins.
[18:53] Now Lord, we lift up these requests
[18:56] before you and ask Father that you would
[18:59] undertake for every single one.
[19:03] For the uplifted hands,
[19:06] for the sickness,
[19:08] for Lord, for all that we have need of.
[19:11] We now we place it Lord at your feet
[19:15] and ask that you would hear and Lord
[19:18] that you would provide for us and that
[19:20] we would be found as always in your
[19:22] perfect will in Jesus name. Amen.
[19:29] Daniel will continue on and I'll let
[19:31] Daniel introduce Josiah
[19:34] when he comes up to minister. Young man
[19:37] who I appreciate him. We all know Katie
[19:40] and Josiah and how much we love them and
[19:43] and Josiah have enough confidence in him
[19:46] to have him to help us in these Bible
[19:48] studies. I'm looking forward to him
[19:51] continuing on with this study on praise
[19:55] and worship. He was excited. He goes, he
[19:58] was telling me back there, he said,
[19:59] "Brother Daniel," he said, he said,
[20:02] "there's so much. There's just so much
[20:06] here." And and he's just, he was
[20:08] excited. He was excited about the word.
[20:10] Doesn't it Isn't it great to see our
[20:13] youth excited about the word? Oh, man. I
[20:18] know. I know. God feels good about it,
[20:20] too. He gave us his Bible, and he wants
[20:23] the young people to read it, just like
[20:25] the older folks. God bless you.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Uh as we sing this last verse of Sister
[20:33] Sarah, you want to get ready for your
[20:34] special. Oh perfect
[20:37] [Music]
[20:42] hall is at rest.
[20:48] I in my savior
[20:53] [Music]
[20:54] am happy and blessed.
[21:00] Oh, I'm watching and waiting.
[21:06] I'm looking above.
[21:09] [Music]
[21:12] I'm filled with his goodness.
[21:18] I'm lost in his love.
[21:24] So this is my story.
[21:27] [Music]
[21:30] This is my song.
[21:33] [Music]
[21:36] I'm praising my savior
[21:42] all the day long.
[21:48] So this is my story.
[21:51] [Music]
[21:54] This is my song.
[21:59] I'm praising my savior
[22:06] all the day long.
[22:17] [Music]
[22:26] They say sometimes you win sometimes
[22:33] you lose.
[22:37] Right now,
[22:40] right now I'm losing.
[22:44] [Music]
[22:47] I've stood on this stage night after
[22:51] night, reminding the broken it'll be all
[22:56] right. But right now,
[22:59] right now, I just can't.
[23:07] It's easy to sing when nothing is
[23:11] holding you down.
[23:16] But what will I say when I'm held to the
[23:20] flames like I am right now?
[23:26] I know you're able and I know you can
[23:31] see through the fire with your mighty
[23:34] hand. But even if you don't,
[23:40] my hope is you alone.
[23:45] And I know the sorrow and I know the
[23:48] hurt would all go away if you just say
[23:53] the word. But even if you don't,
[23:59] my hope is you alone.
[24:04] [Music]
[24:07] They say it only takes a little faith
[24:12] to move a mountain.
[24:16] [Music]
[24:18] Good thing.
[24:20] A little faith is all I have right now.
[24:28] For God, when you choose to leave
[24:30] mountains unmovable,
[24:37] give me the strength to be able to sing.
[24:41] It is well with my soul. I know you're
[24:48] able and I know you can save through the
[24:52] fire with your mighty hand. But even if
[24:58] you don't,
[25:00] my hope is you alone.
[25:04] [Music]
[25:06] God, you've been faithful.
[25:10] You've been good all my days.
[25:16] Jesus, I will cling to you. Come what
[25:23] may
[25:26] I know you're able. Yes, Lord. And I
[25:31] know you can.
[25:36] I know you're able and I know you can be
[25:41] safe through the fire with your mighty
[25:44] hand. But even if you don't,
[25:50] my hope is you alone home. And I know
[25:56] the sorrow. And I know the hurt would
[26:00] all go away if you just say the word.
[26:04] But even if you don't,
[26:08] my hope is you alone.
[26:14] God, you've been faithful.
[26:18] You've been good all my days.
[26:24] Jesus, I will cling to you.
[26:31] What?
[26:33] But I know you're a
[26:38] [Music]
[26:43] but
[26:48] my hope still you
[26:52] alone.
[27:03] Sister Sarah, that's one of my favorite
[27:05] songs right there. I love it. Let's sing
[27:08] How Great Thou Art as Brother Josiah
[27:10] comes up. If we could stand this
[27:12] evening.
[27:16] [Music]
[27:21] Oh Lord
[27:23] my God,
[27:26] when I in awome
[27:29] wonder
[27:31] [Music]
[27:32] consider
[27:34] all
[27:36] [Music]
[27:37] thy works thy hands hath made.
[27:45] And I see the stars.
[27:51] And I hear the rolling
[27:56] thunder
[27:58] thy power throughout
[28:04] the universe
[28:08] display.
[28:13] Then sings my soul,
[28:18] my savior
[28:21] God to thee.
[28:28] How great thou are.
[28:33] [Music]
[28:35] How great
[28:37] thou are.
[28:42] Then sings my soul,
[28:47] my savior
[28:50] God to thee.
[28:57] How great thou are.
[29:04] How great
[29:06] thou are.
[29:11] When through the woods
[29:17] and forest
[29:19] glades
[29:20] I wonder
[29:23] and hear the birds
[29:29] sing sweetly
[29:31] in the trees.
[29:37] When I look down
[29:42] from lofty
[29:45] mountain
[29:47] gender
[29:48] [Music]
[29:49] and hear the brook
[29:55] and feel the gentle
[29:59] breeze.
[30:03] Then sings my soul,
[30:08] my Savior
[30:11] God to thee.
[30:17] How great thou are.
[30:24] How great
[30:26] thou are.
[30:31] Then sings my soul,
[30:37] my savior
[30:39] God to thee.
[30:46] How great thou are.
[30:53] How great thou are.
[30:57] [Music]
[31:00] And when I think that God his son not
[31:07] sparing
[31:09] [Music]
[31:10] sent him to die,
[31:15] I scarce can take it in.
[31:23] And on
[31:26] that cross,
[31:29] my burdens
[31:31] gladly
[31:33] bearing,
[31:36] he bled and died
[31:41] to take
[31:43] away my sin.
[31:50] Then sings my soul,
[31:55] my savior
[31:58] God to thee.
[32:04] How great thou are.
[32:09] [Music]
[32:11] How great thou are.
[32:16] Let's tell our Lord tonight. Then sings
[32:19] my soul,
[32:23] my Savior
[32:26] God to thee.
[32:32] How great thou art.
[32:39] How great
[32:42] thou
[32:44] are. Worship,
[32:49] the English definition,
[32:52] to honor or to show reverence
[32:57] for a divine being or supernatural power
[33:00] or regard to someone with great or
[33:03] extravagant respect and devotion.
[33:07] So much in there. Would you pray with
[33:10] me?
[33:12] Lord Jesus,
[33:14] [Music]
[33:16] we have so much to be grateful for.
[33:20] We couldn't spend a whole service
[33:24] if we only gave thanks to you the whole
[33:26] service. We couldn't scratch the
[33:29] surface, Lord, of all you've done, even
[33:32] just in this church.
[33:37] Lord, we thank you for being here this
[33:39] evening. We ask that you'd just take
[33:41] control of the service.
[33:45] Pray that you'd be glorified at the end
[33:47] of this night.
[33:51] We could leave here and say truly Jesus
[33:54] was glorified in that service.
[33:58] [Music]
[34:00] All of us here, Lord, I pray we would
[34:01] all glorify you.
[34:04] Pray that the things I say would be
[34:05] glorifying to you.
[34:10] Lord, I pray for our friend Thomas who
[34:12] was here Sunday night who gave his heart
[34:14] to the Lord.
[34:16] So wonderful to see you working. Lord,
[34:20] I pray that you'd touch him.
[34:22] Draw him close to you,
[34:25] Lord. Help him in his life.
[34:29] Make him a real Christian, Lord.
[34:32] And Lord, for all of us here, Lord, make
[34:34] all of us real Christians that can get
[34:37] out there and serve you
[34:40] and be faithful.
[34:43] Thank you, Lord, for this service. We
[34:45] give it to you for your glory in Jesus
[34:47] name. Amen.
[34:52] Amen.
[34:54] What a wonderful song. I uh lead worship
[34:59] as you know and I say often that I don't
[35:02] get tired of that song and I think the
[35:06] Lord doesn't get tired of hearing it. So
[35:08] as long as we have breath and as long as
[35:11] he wants to hear it, I think we ought to
[35:13] sing it with all our hearts. Don't you?
[35:15] Amen.
[35:17] Well, I don't know. Did Daniel have you
[35:18] shake hands?
[35:21] Shake hands.
[35:23] That gives me time to get everything in
[35:26] order.
[35:56] That's right. We're safe here in church.
[36:00] Amen.
[36:11] And you can all have your seats once you
[36:13] get back to your seats. I read the
[36:15] definition of worship which is our topic
[36:17] tonight. My title is you were born to
[36:22] worship.
[36:24] And the the definition the English
[36:26] definition of the word worship uh is to
[36:28] honor or show reverence
[36:32] or uh
[36:34] to give respect or devotion. That's the
[36:37] general definition of the word worship.
[36:39] Last time we talked about praise. talked
[36:42] about in the in the Psalms how it says
[36:44] clapping your hands to the Lord, that's
[36:46] a form of praise. Lifting your voice,
[36:48] giving praise to God, those are all
[36:50] things of praise. And most of the time,
[36:53] things like praise happen right here in
[36:56] church. So, the claim I'm making tonight
[37:00] is that worship
[37:02] goes far beyond the walls of this
[37:05] church. And so does praise. We we we
[37:09] covered that. We're not saying that
[37:11] praise uh can only take place in church.
[37:14] When you speak about the goodness of
[37:16] Jesus to others, you're giving praise.
[37:18] Whether that's at work or out at school,
[37:21] whatever you're doing, you're giving
[37:22] praise to God.
[37:24] But mainly when we think of praise, we
[37:26] think of raising our hands and clap
[37:28] because that's all through the Psalms.
[37:30] Sing unto the Lord in his sanctuary.
[37:32] Sing unto the Lord a new song. All these
[37:34] things in the Psalms about singing,
[37:36] clapping, even raising your hands,
[37:38] making sound. That was the general idea
[37:41] of praise that you give your praise in
[37:44] that manner to God. My claim tonight is
[37:47] that like 90% of worship,
[37:51] that might be bold. I might come back
[37:53] and say that I was wrong, but I'm gonna
[37:56] for tonight
[37:58] 90% of what worship really is, I think
[38:01] happens outside of the church.
[38:04] I think there's a 30 minute part of the
[38:06] service that we call the worship
[38:08] service.
[38:10] And I think that's a very small fraction
[38:13] in our lives of what worship really is.
[38:17] Let's turn, if you have your Bibles, to
[38:19] John 4.
[38:25] Brother Lyle did a couple uh services on
[38:28] worship and he promised me that he would
[38:31] stay away from John 4 because I've had
[38:33] John 4 for quite a while thinking about
[38:37] this topic. And brother Lyall said,
[38:39] "Well, I'm not planning on going that
[38:42] way and if it comes to mind, I'll make
[38:44] sure to avoid it." And he didn't. He
[38:46] covered a lot of things that I wasn't
[38:47] going to cover. So, it's perfect. It
[38:49] works out perfectly.
[38:52] Um, I I asked, let's open our Bibles. I
[38:56] I made a point last time about bringing
[38:59] your Bible and reading out of your
[39:01] Bible.
[39:03] Um, just a side note here, I really
[39:06] appreciate my wife.
[39:09] Um, because
[39:11] she holds me to what I say.
[39:16] She's absolutely unreasonable.
[39:21] It's a joke, of course. Um, but there
[39:24] have been a couple services since then
[39:28] that I forgot my Bible in paper form
[39:32] and
[39:34] she reminded me of the things I said.
[39:36] She holds me to it. So, anything I say,
[39:38] I have to make sure that if I hear it
[39:41] from her, uh, I won't be angry to hear
[39:44] it from her because it's really she
[39:46] holds me to what I say.
[39:50] Chapter 4 of the Gospel of John.
[39:55] Let's start at uh
[39:59] let's start at verse six.
[40:02] Jesus is coming into Samaria.
[40:06] And Jacob's well was there. Jesus
[40:07] therefore being wearied with his journey
[40:10] sat thus on the well. And it was about
[40:13] the sixth hour. So it was hot,
[40:17] not 6:00 a.m. but 6 hours of daylight.
[40:20] So it was it was warm by this point in
[40:23] the day. He was thirsty.
[40:25] And there cometh a woman of Samaria
[40:29] to draw water.
[40:31] Jesus saith unto her, "Give me to
[40:35] drink." For his disciples were gone away
[40:37] into the city to buy food.
[40:40] Then saith the woman of Samaria unto
[40:42] him, How is it that thou being a Jew,
[40:47] ask me,
[40:49] a woman of Samaria,
[40:54] how is it, thou being a Jew, askest,
[40:56] drink of me, which is am a woman of
[40:58] Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings
[41:00] with the Samaritans. We covered this a
[41:02] little bit in the book of Ezra. there
[41:05] when they were rebuilding the temple in
[41:07] Jerusalem in the Old Testament, there
[41:09] was a group of people that came and
[41:10] said, "Let us help build the temple."
[41:13] Some of these people were Samaritans.
[41:15] And Zerubbabel said, "No, because one
[41:19] thing Samaria had got into without
[41:21] getting into too much detail there,
[41:24] there was some idolatry."
[41:26] So, there was a split. The capital of uh
[41:30] of Judah was Jerusalem and the capital
[41:33] of Israel was Samaria and they had
[41:35] separate ways of worship. Some of these
[41:37] Samaritans came to Zerubbabel. We we
[41:39] talked about it a little bit in Ezra if
[41:40] you remember far back and Zerubbabel
[41:42] said, "No, I don't want you to build the
[41:44] temple." And we discussed that it's
[41:46] possible part of his not wanting them to
[41:49] be involved was because of the idolatry.
[41:52] So she says, "How would you, being a
[41:55] Jew, ask me a Samaritan?
[41:58] The Jews don't have dealings with
[41:59] Samaritans. We we had a church split."
[42:02] Jesus answered and said unto her.
[42:06] Jesus always surprise surprises when he
[42:09] answers, "If thou kneest the gift of
[42:11] God, and who it is that saith to thee,
[42:14] Give me to drink, thou wouldest have
[42:16] asked of him, and he would have given
[42:19] thee living water.
[42:22] The woman said unto him, "Sir, thou hast
[42:25] nothing to draw with, and the well is
[42:26] deep? From whence then hast thou that
[42:30] living water? Art thou greater than our
[42:33] father Jacob, which gave us the well,
[42:35] and drank thereof himself, and his
[42:37] children, and his cattle?"
[42:42] Jesus answered and said unto her,
[42:43] "Whosoever drinkketh of this water shall
[42:46] thirst again.
[42:48] But whosoever drinkketh of the water
[42:49] that I shall give him shall never
[42:52] thirst. But the water that I shall give
[42:54] him shall be in him a well of water
[42:57] springing up into everlasting life.
[43:01] So beautiful. That's a great verse to
[43:03] memorize. The woman saith unto him,
[43:05] "Sir, give me this water that I thirst
[43:08] not, neither come hither to draw."
[43:11] Jesus saith unto her, "Go call thy
[43:13] husband and come hither." The woman
[43:15] answered and said,"I have no husband."
[43:19] Jesus said unto her,"Thou
[43:22] hast well said, 'I have no husband, for
[43:24] thou hast had five husbands,
[43:27] and he whom thou now hast is not thy
[43:30] husband. In that sets thou truly."
[43:36] The woman saith unto him, "Sir, I
[43:37] perceive that thou art a prophet."
[43:41] And then she goes back to the Jews and
[43:44] Samaritans thing. She's hung up on that.
[43:49] He just exposed her entire life. And she
[43:52] goes back to this. Our fathers worshiped
[43:54] in this mountain, and ye say that in
[43:57] Jerusalem is the place where men ought
[43:58] to worship.
[44:01] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me.
[44:06] The hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[44:09] this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[44:12] worship the father.
[44:15] Ye worship ye know not what. So then he
[44:18] he he sort of answers this this question
[44:22] of Jews and Samaritans. He he answers
[44:24] okay yes you don't know what you're
[44:26] worshiping. We know what we worship
[44:28] because salvation is of the Jews. But
[44:32] verse 23, the hour cometh, and now is,
[44:37] when true worshippers
[44:39] shall worship the Father in spirit and
[44:42] in truth.
[44:44] For the Father seeketh such to worship
[44:46] him. God is a spirit, and they that
[44:49] worship him must worship him in spirit
[44:52] and in truth.
[44:55] So beautiful. So much to talk about
[44:57] there. It's so amazing that Jesus said,
[45:00] 'Look, the time is coming. Not in
[45:04] Jerusalem,
[45:05] not in this mountain,
[45:09] not at the Los Angeles Temple,
[45:13] not at Brooklyn Tabernacle, maybe at
[45:15] Brooklyn, maybe at all those places. But
[45:17] that's not the point. True worshippers,
[45:19] no matter where they are, are going to
[45:21] worship the Father, and they're going to
[45:23] worship him truly.
[45:26] So, like I said, I made the the claim
[45:29] earlier.
[45:30] I wanted to break it right open that
[45:32] worship is not just about right here. I
[45:34] wanted to really uh hit that.
[45:38] Um it's not just that 30 minute period
[45:41] before the pastor comes out to preach.
[45:44] Worship goes beyond that.
[45:46] And my title, as I said, is you were
[45:48] born to worship.
[45:51] So, what about the people who don't
[45:52] worship anything?
[45:55] You'll meet these people. Ask them.
[45:59] Ask them what do you worship? Because
[46:02] truthfully, without exceptions, every
[46:04] human worship something. No exceptions.
[46:07] No one is exempt from that. Everyone
[46:10] will worship, has worshiped or is
[46:12] worshiping something.
[46:14] Just ask an atheist,
[46:18] what do you worship? He will reply,
[46:21] nothing.
[46:23] I don't worship anything. Come on,
[46:25] everyone worship something. And he'll
[46:27] say, "No, no, no, no, no, no. I do not
[46:30] worship anything.
[46:33] I just take care of myself.
[46:37] I do what makes me happy.
[46:40] I live my life for my own comfort.
[46:44] Just Just go ask someone." No, no, no. I
[46:47] just do whatever makes me happy. I just
[46:49] love myself. I don't worship anything.
[46:53] I worship myself, but I don't worship
[46:55] anything. That's really the claim that
[46:57] they're making. I live my life for me. I
[47:01] take care of myself. I do what makes me
[47:02] happy. I do what I want to do. If I
[47:04] don't want to do it, I don't do it. I
[47:06] live my life for me. But I don't worship
[47:07] anything.
[47:10] Everyone worships something. Do you
[47:13] understand that point I just made? That
[47:15] the atheist saying he doesn't worship
[47:17] anything that just takes care of himself
[47:18] and let he's he's worshiping himself.
[47:21] Let's turn to Romans 1.
[47:34] There's more than just worshiping
[47:36] yourself if you're not worshiping God.
[47:38] As we learn right here in Romans 1.
[47:45] Romans 1:18. Let's start at verse 18.
[47:53] The wrath of God is revealed. We have uh
[47:55] a lot of scriptures tonight. We read all
[47:57] that John 4. Now we're going to read a
[47:59] lot of this. I want to come out here and
[48:01] I don't want to say I don't want to come
[48:03] across as someone who comes out and
[48:05] says, you know, I was thinking or I had
[48:08] a thought. I want to come out here and
[48:10] say let's open our Bibles. So I want to
[48:13] everything everything we say tonight. I
[48:16] know brother Lyall lives by that.
[48:18] Brother Daniel lives by that and that's
[48:20] the right way to do it. So, I'm sorry
[48:22] for that. Side note, uh Romans 1:18, for
[48:25] the wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[48:27] against all ungodliness and
[48:29] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[48:31] truth in unrighteousness.
[48:34] Because that which may be known of God
[48:37] is manifest in them. God hath shown it
[48:39] to them. For the invisible things
[48:44] of him from the creation of the world
[48:46] are clearly seen, being understood by
[48:49] the things that are made, even even his
[48:53] God's eternal power and godhead.
[48:56] So that they human beings are without
[48:59] excuse.
[49:01] Because that when they knew God,
[49:04] they glorified him not as God. Neither
[49:08] were thankful,
[49:10] but became vain in their imaginations,
[49:14] and their foolish heart was darkened.
[49:17] This is this these next couple verses
[49:19] are heavy-hitting and they they seem to
[49:22] be very focused on sinners and people in
[49:26] the world that don't know God. And
[49:30] while that might be true, we have to be
[49:32] humble
[49:34] that we don't fall into this same c this
[49:36] same trap that all these people people
[49:40] all around us are in. because the the
[49:42] the next the next uh chapter begins by
[49:46] saying the ones who judge the people for
[49:48] doing these things are guilty of the
[49:49] same things. So let's continue reading
[49:54] uh verse 21. Because that when they knew
[49:57] God, they glorified him not as God,
[49:59] neither were thankful,
[50:01] but became vain in their imaginations,
[50:04] and their foolish heart was darkened.
[50:08] Professing themselves to be wise, they
[50:10] became fools
[50:12] and changed the glory of the
[50:14] uncorruptible God into an image made
[50:18] like to corruptible man and to birds and
[50:21] to for-footed beasts and creeping
[50:23] things.
[50:25] So all the glory that belonged to God,
[50:27] they changed it into a into this image
[50:30] or concept of no longer is God getting
[50:33] the glory, but now this image like like
[50:36] a like men or like the animals or like
[50:38] the birds.
[50:41] Verse 24. Wherefore God also gave them
[50:43] up to uncleanliness
[50:45] through the lusts of their own hearts to
[50:47] dishonor their own bodies between
[50:49] themselves,
[50:51] who changed the truth of God into a lie,
[50:57] and worshiped and served the creature
[50:59] more than the creator who is blessed
[51:02] forever. Amen. This is so important as
[51:07] we're living today. They changed the
[51:09] truth of God into a lie. And instead of
[51:12] worshiping God, now they worship and
[51:14] serve the creature more than the
[51:16] creator.
[51:18] Now more than ever is the time for
[51:20] Christians to be humble yet bold. That
[51:24] the truth is God and his son Jesus
[51:27] Christ. not the creation,
[51:30] not all of this below,
[51:33] but it says in this verse that they
[51:35] literally changed the truth of God and
[51:37] and they just considered it a lie.
[51:40] And instead of worshiping God, now they
[51:42] worship and serve the creature rather
[51:45] than the one who created.
[51:49] They worshiped and served the creature
[51:50] more than the creator who is blessed
[51:52] forever. Amen.
[51:55] For this cause
[51:57] God gave them over to vile affections.
[52:01] For even their women did change the
[52:03] natural use to that which is against
[52:05] nature. And likewise also the men
[52:07] leaving the natural use of the woman
[52:09] burned in their lust one toward another.
[52:11] Men with men working that which is
[52:14] unseemly
[52:16] and receiving in themselves that
[52:17] recompense of their error which was due.
[52:22] And even as they did not like to retain
[52:24] God in their knowledge, God gave them
[52:26] over to a repbate mind to do those
[52:28] things which are not convenient.
[52:32] These are the this is this is a
[52:33] description of the ones that worship and
[52:36] serve
[52:37] the creature rather than the creator.
[52:42] In these in these next couple verses, I
[52:45] mean it's describing people who are
[52:48] ungrateful.
[52:49] They have vain imaginations.
[52:54] self-p profofessing wisdom,
[52:56] changing the glory of God into other
[52:58] things. They dishonor their bodies.
[53:03] They worship and serve the creature,
[53:04] like we said, rather than God who
[53:06] created everything.
[53:09] There's honor and fear and respect for
[53:12] nature,
[53:14] but there's no honor, fear, and respect
[53:16] for God. You respect your mother and
[53:18] your father. Almost everyone does. But
[53:21] there's no respect for God who gave us a
[53:24] mother and a father. There's no respect
[53:26] for God who gave us
[53:29] There's this movement to save the
[53:32] planet, to save the world, to fix the
[53:35] climate problem.
[53:40] And
[53:42] all of this energy and worship is
[53:47] pointed at the earth
[53:50] for our benefit. God did give Adam the
[53:52] earth to take care of.
[53:55] But Adam was meant to worship God.
[53:58] I think I think I've made that redundant
[54:00] by now. God gave us a beautiful planet.
[54:03] The Grand Canyon,
[54:05] the Rockies,
[54:07] the baby blue water of the Bahamas, the
[54:09] Bahamas,
[54:11] the forests, the deserts, the rivers, so
[54:14] many more things
[54:16] that God created. Not even to mention
[54:18] the animals, those beautiful red birds
[54:20] we see here in Arizona.
[54:23] cardinals.
[54:26] Um, the deer, the elk, the moose, the
[54:29] antelope,
[54:31] the blue whales and the orcas,
[54:34] tuna and blue marlin, Alaskan salmon and
[54:38] largemouth bass, the brown bear, the
[54:41] lions and the buffalo, the zebras and
[54:43] the giraffes, the elephants, the rhinos,
[54:45] the alligators and the hippos,
[54:48] swans in the lake, the eagles in the
[54:50] sky,
[54:52] and so many millions of forms of life
[54:55] that don't even have souls yet all
[54:58] together
[55:00] joined with the sun, moon, and stars
[55:04] join in worship to the creator
[55:07] who is blessed as the scripture says who
[55:09] is blessed forever. Amen. And yet the
[55:13] humans
[55:16] changed verse 25 the truth of God into a
[55:20] lie and worshiped and served the
[55:21] creature instead of the creator
[55:27] dishonoring their bodies.
[55:30] Men with men, women with women,
[55:34] full of unrighteousness, fornication,
[55:36] which is sexual sin, wickedness, greed.
[55:40] Paul's saying they started worshiping
[55:43] the creature instead of God.
[55:46] And all this follows
[55:50] evil, envy, murder, strife. This is all
[55:54] uh this is a list of a recap of those
[55:57] next couple verses that follow. Murder,
[55:58] strife, deceit, malice, whisperers. The
[56:01] Amplified says they're mean-spirited,
[56:04] backbiters, gossips, haters of God,
[56:07] despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors
[56:11] of evil things, disobedient to parents,
[56:14] no understanding, untrustworthy,
[56:16] unloving, unmerciful,
[56:19] and have pleasure in all of these
[56:21] things.
[56:23] These are the type that worship and
[56:26] serve the creation more than the
[56:28] creator.
[56:31] And I want to emphasize it's God's
[56:33] creation. It's not the devil's creation.
[56:36] They're not worshiping something the
[56:37] devil created. This is worship of
[56:40] something that God himself created.
[56:44] And God gave all this to us to point to
[56:48] him. We just sang it. went through the
[56:50] woods and the forest glades. I wander
[56:54] and I hear the birds singing sweetly in
[56:56] the trees and I look down from lofty
[56:58] mountain grander
[57:00] and I hear the brook and I feel the
[57:02] gentle breeze
[57:04] and then sings my soul my savior God to
[57:08] thee how great thou art.
[57:11] It's to point us. Look, looking around
[57:14] the lofty mountain grander as that verse
[57:16] says to point us. When I see that, I
[57:19] know there's a God and I know that he's
[57:22] all powerful and I know that he's worthy
[57:23] of all of our worship. That's the point
[57:26] of all of it. Not that the wor not that
[57:28] the the creation would get the glory,
[57:30] but that God would get the glory.
[57:39] Which one is greater?
[57:42] Mount Rushmore
[57:44] or President Washington himself and his
[57:47] 50 trillion cells and all the great
[57:49] things and his complex anatomy that
[57:52] achieved all the things George
[57:53] Washington achieved in life. Which one's
[57:56] greater? Mount Rushmore or the actual
[57:59] George Washington?
[58:01] Is
[58:04] George Washington great because of Mount
[58:06] Rushmore? Or is Mount Rushmore great
[58:08] because it has George Washington on it?
[58:13] It's an illustration. Because God isn't
[58:16] great because of how amazing the world
[58:19] is. The world is amazing because of how
[58:22] great God is.
[58:26] God gave the earth, as I said, to Adam
[58:28] to take care of it, not to worship it.
[58:36] The world and everything in it like
[58:39] Mount Rushmore is a monument to the
[58:42] greatness of God.
[58:46] God created it.
[58:49] And
[58:51] God wanted men to be like him. He said,
[58:54] "Let us create man in our image." He
[58:57] made all the creation.
[59:00] But there was nothing that was like him.
[59:02] There was nothing that was like God.
[59:06] I just absolutely
[59:08] blasted the bad forms of worship as
[59:12] depicted in Romans 1. But before we're
[59:15] quick to judge, as I said, all of those
[59:18] who fall into that, we must remember the
[59:20] opening point, which is we're all born
[59:23] to worship.
[59:26] Like we said at the start, everyone
[59:28] worships. We're all worshippers and if
[59:30] you don't know any better, you're gonna
[59:33] end up worshiping something incorrect
[59:36] rather than the creator.
[59:39] So what do we worship and how? The the
[59:41] the what is easy. You worship God.
[59:44] That's the easy answer. You worship God,
[59:46] Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. But
[59:49] how?
[59:51] Now, everything I said is an
[59:52] introduction to this.
[59:55] How?
[59:57] And this is something we could spend
[59:59] several more Wednesday nights talking
[1:00:01] about.
[1:00:03] I started off again by claiming it goes
[1:00:06] far beyond the worship service.
[1:00:09] There's a few scriptures that illustrate
[1:00:10] this. Um Colossians 3:23, we put that
[1:00:14] up. This is part of worship.
[1:00:21] I'm I just got to say I'm sorry if I'm
[1:00:23] slow getting to the point.
[1:00:26] I uh my brain moves slow. Colossians
[1:00:30] 3:23.
[1:00:31] Yet whatsoever you do, do it heartily as
[1:00:35] to the Lord and not unto men.
[1:00:38] So now we're going outside of the
[1:00:40] church. Whatever you do is unto the
[1:00:44] Lord. Not unto men, but unto God.
[1:00:48] There's another scripture that we don't
[1:00:50] have to turn to it, but Ephesians 6:7,
[1:00:52] if you want to write that down. 1
[1:00:54] Corinthians 10:31 illustrates it great,
[1:00:57] too.
[1:00:59] But the point of all of it is is that
[1:01:01] everything we do in life
[1:01:03] is going to worship something.
[1:01:06] And if you do it unto the Lord,
[1:01:13] it goes so much further than just
[1:01:16] singing songs in church.
[1:01:20] It goes so much further
[1:01:22] than just
[1:01:25] being a Christian, saying you're a
[1:01:26] Christian, participating in cultural
[1:01:28] Christianity,
[1:01:30] but actually doing everything in your
[1:01:32] life
[1:01:34] like the world is, like the creation is
[1:01:37] as a testament to the greatness of God.
[1:01:39] That is worship. A life, a monument of a
[1:01:44] life dedicated to God's glory.
[1:01:49] Worship.
[1:01:51] I have this poem to read.
[1:01:56] Worship covers everything.
[1:02:00] It's in your soul. It's in your hands.
[1:02:04] It's in your hopes, your dreams, your
[1:02:06] plans. It's in your strength. It's in
[1:02:09] your mind. It's in the things you leave
[1:02:12] behind.
[1:02:14] It's in your eyes. It's on your face.
[1:02:17] It's what you shun and you embrace.
[1:02:21] The atmosphere your life creates.
[1:02:24] Everything communicates.
[1:02:27] It's how you work. It's how you play.
[1:02:31] It's how you live from day to day. It's
[1:02:34] what you see. It's what you hear. This
[1:02:36] is all worship. It's what you let your
[1:02:39] heart come near.
[1:02:42] It's what you show and it's what's
[1:02:44] unseen. It's in and out and in between.
[1:02:49] It's how you dress. It's what you wear.
[1:02:52] It's even how you wear your hair. With
[1:02:55] every look, with every phrase, you're
[1:02:57] showing that something should be
[1:02:59] praised. With every word, with every
[1:03:02] deed, you shine a light and sew a seed.
[1:03:06] It's how you serve. It's how you pray.
[1:03:08] It's how you give your life away.
[1:03:12] It's how you talk. It's how you sing.
[1:03:15] Worship covers everything.
[1:03:19] Worship is forever.
[1:03:24] If the worship team wants to come
[1:03:26] forward now,
[1:03:29] I'm already to 30 minutes, which is when
[1:03:32] I stop. I really only
[1:03:35] read a sloppy introduction, but
[1:03:38] truthfully, each one of these things I
[1:03:40] just read, we could talk about
[1:03:43] worship from the soul.
[1:03:46] It's in your soul. It's in your hands.
[1:03:48] It's what you do.
[1:03:50] We could talk about what you hope for,
[1:03:51] what you dream for. That can tell you a
[1:03:54] lot about what you're worshiping.
[1:03:56] It's in your strength. It's in your
[1:03:59] mind. As I said, it's in the things you
[1:04:01] leave behind. These are all things from
[1:04:03] the scripture we can unpack about
[1:04:05] worship.
[1:04:09] It's how you talk. It's how you sing.
[1:04:12] Worship covers everything.
[1:04:16] To sum it all up,
[1:04:19] do everything in life as unto the Lord,
[1:04:22] as the scripture said, for his glory.
[1:04:26] Don't let a moment go by without
[1:04:29] thinking, without remembering that what
[1:04:32] you're doing could be worship to God.
[1:04:35] And if it's not,
[1:04:37] if it's not worship to God,
[1:04:40] it's idolatry.
[1:04:43] There's only one person worthy of our
[1:04:45] worship.
[1:04:47] You know, this this company here,
[1:04:51] Apple,
[1:04:52] they created the smartphone.
[1:04:55] The phone used to be attached to the
[1:04:56] wall
[1:04:58] or corded on a desk in the house, but
[1:05:02] then they created it so it could be
[1:05:04] taken everywhere.
[1:05:06] They made it so that it could be the
[1:05:09] first thing you go to in the morning and
[1:05:13] the last thing you go to before you go
[1:05:15] to bed. And when you're faced with a
[1:05:17] problem, it's the first thing you jump
[1:05:19] to.
[1:05:20] And when you have good news, it's the
[1:05:22] first thing you go to to share.
[1:05:26] That's what this was created for.
[1:05:28] There's a problem.
[1:05:30] There's something else that already has
[1:05:32] that place in a Christian's life. He's
[1:05:36] the first thing we go to every day. And
[1:05:38] he's the last thing we go to each night.
[1:05:40] In time of trouble.
[1:05:43] This isn't where we run.
[1:05:48] And we have to be careful that in those
[1:05:50] times each morning, each night in
[1:05:53] between what we go to when we're in
[1:05:55] danger,
[1:05:58] is it more
[1:06:00] could it be that we're giving that thing
[1:06:02] worship
[1:06:05] rather than the creator himself who is
[1:06:08] blessed forever?
[1:06:10] Could it be?
[1:06:14] Would you stand with me?
[1:06:24] We all want to be better worshippers.
[1:06:26] Is that true? We all want to serve the
[1:06:29] Lord better. We all want to honor him
[1:06:31] more.
[1:06:33] That's why we're here on a Wednesday
[1:06:34] night.
[1:06:37] We want to love the Lord more.
[1:06:41] Let's pray together.
[1:06:44] Lord Jesus,
[1:06:48] Lord, you're so great. You're so
[1:06:50] wonderful.
[1:06:52] You're deserving of every good thing.
[1:06:57] Lord, we don't want anything to be above
[1:06:59] you.
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:03] Not the creation, not the world,
[1:07:07] not our friends, not our families, our
[1:07:09] spouses,
[1:07:11] not our gifts, not our talents, not our
[1:07:13] jobs,
[1:07:15] not our church. Lord,
[1:07:18] we want to worship you above all else.
[1:07:23] I pray that after this service, Lord, we
[1:07:25] could leave here.
[1:07:27] And Lord, even if we all were all
[1:07:30] sinners saved by your grace, if we could
[1:07:32] all leave and be 1% better,
[1:07:35] and if we could worship you more
[1:07:37] tomorrow,
[1:07:40] if we could give you more honor
[1:07:43] each day,
[1:07:46] Lord, that's all that really matters.
[1:07:52] Lord, let our lives
[1:07:55] be a monument
[1:07:57] to the goodness of God.
[1:08:01] Let our lives always point to you and
[1:08:03] how great you are.
[1:08:09] Lord, we love you. We give you our
[1:08:12] hearts tonight
[1:08:14] in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:08:18] I worship
[1:08:20] you
[1:08:22] almighty
[1:08:24] God.
[1:08:27] There is none like you.
[1:08:32] [Music]
[1:08:34] I worship
[1:08:36] you.
[1:08:38] Oh prince
[1:08:40] of peace.
[1:08:44] That is what I long
[1:08:48] to do.
[1:08:50] I give
[1:08:52] you praise
[1:08:58] for you are my righteousness.
[1:09:05] [Music]
[1:09:07] I worship
[1:09:09] you
[1:09:11] almighty
[1:09:13] God.
[1:09:16] There is none like you. Can we sing that
[1:09:21] again? Can we raise our hands to the
[1:09:23] Lord as a sign of surrender?
[1:09:25] I worship
[1:09:28] you
[1:09:30] almighty
[1:09:32] God.
[1:09:35] There is none like you.
[1:09:42] I worship
[1:09:44] you,
[1:09:46] oh prince
[1:09:48] of peace.
[1:09:52] That is what I long to do.
[1:09:58] I give
[1:10:00] you praise.
[1:10:06] For you are my rightousness.
[1:10:15] I worship
[1:10:17] you
[1:10:19] almighty
[1:10:22] God.
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:25] There is none like you.
[1:10:31] Worship
[1:10:38] you
[1:10:40] mighty
[1:10:42] God.
[1:10:45] There is none like you.
[1:10:52] I worship
[1:10:54] you,
[1:10:56] oh prince
[1:10:58] of peace.
[1:11:02] That is what I long
[1:11:05] to do.
[1:11:08] I give
[1:11:10] you praise
[1:11:15] for you are my righteousness.
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:25] I worship
[1:11:27] you
[1:11:29] almighty
[1:11:32] God.
[1:11:34] There is none like you.
[1:11:41] I don't think I'll ever forget
[1:11:45] when Josiah said,
[1:11:47] he said, "Is George Washington great
[1:11:50] because of Mount Rushmore
[1:11:52] or is Mount Rushmore great because of
[1:11:54] George Washington?"
[1:11:57] That was beautiful.
[1:12:00] We think
[1:12:01] that is God great because of all the
[1:12:06] servants of God that have come through
[1:12:09] the ages
[1:12:12] or are they great because God sent them?
[1:12:19] And friends, whenever when we go home or
[1:12:22] when, not tonight, but when when you
[1:12:24] drive around looking up at the
[1:12:25] mountains, the Catalina Mountains, and
[1:12:28] and think, is God great because of those
[1:12:30] Catalina mountains, or are they great
[1:12:31] because of God, their creator? I'll
[1:12:34] never forget that. That was very, very
[1:12:36] well said, very well stated, Daniel.
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:48] And he moves among us.
[1:12:52] All that he does
[1:12:56] and all of his mercy
[1:13:00] and all of his love.
[1:13:03] If a pin of a rider
[1:13:07] could ride every day,
[1:13:11] even this world
[1:13:14] could never contain
[1:13:19] how I've been blessed.
[1:13:25] Oh, warmth in the win,
[1:13:29] flowers in spring.
[1:13:33] Laughter at summer
[1:13:36] and changing of leaves.
[1:13:40] Oh, food on my table.
[1:13:44] A good place to sleep
[1:13:47] and clothes on my back
[1:13:51] and shoes on my feet.
[1:13:55] Oh, I have been blessed.
[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:14:02] I have been blessed.
[1:14:05] God so good to me.
[1:14:10] Precious are his thoughts of you and me.
[1:14:17] No way I can count them. There's not
[1:14:21] enough time.
[1:14:24] So I'll just thank him for being so
[1:14:30] kind.
[1:14:31] Oh, God has been good.
[1:14:35] So
[1:14:37] good.
[1:14:39] I have been blessed.
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:45] Oh, in arms that can raise,
[1:14:49] a voice that can talk,
[1:14:53] hands that can touch,
[1:14:57] and legs that can walk. Oh, and ears
[1:15:01] that can listen,
[1:15:04] eyes that can see,
[1:15:07] and I've got to praise him as long as I
[1:15:13] breathe.
[1:15:14] Oh, I have been blessed.
[1:15:18] [Music]
[1:15:21] And I have been blessed.
[1:15:25] God so good to me.
[1:15:29] And precious are his thoughts of you and
[1:15:34] me. No way I can count them. There's not
[1:15:40] enough time.
[1:15:43] So I'll just thank him for being so
[1:15:48] kind. Oh, God has been good.
[1:15:54] So
[1:15:56] good.
[1:15:57] I have been blessed.
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:04] A mother and father
[1:16:08] who nurtured and raised.
[1:16:12] Sisters and brothers
[1:16:15] and meories made
[1:16:19] our pastor to lead us. This altar to
[1:16:24] pray.
[1:16:26] Stripes that can heal.
[1:16:30] And blood that still saves.
[1:16:33] Oh, I have been blessed
[1:16:40] and I have been blessed.
[1:16:44] God so good to me
[1:16:47] and precious are his thoughts of you and
[1:16:53] me. No way I can count them. There's not
[1:16:59] enough time.
[1:17:02] So I'll just thank him for being so
[1:17:07] kind.
[1:17:09] And God has been good.
[1:17:13] So
[1:17:14] good.
[1:17:16] I have been blessed.
[1:17:20] Jeremy, can you come up and close?
[1:17:24] God's so good. Sweet spirit tonight.
[1:17:27] That song always brings a really sweet
[1:17:30] sweet closing and just so many things
[1:17:34] even breath
[1:17:36] to to speak.
[1:17:38] We've been blessed just to be able to
[1:17:40] talk.
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:46] Let's pray.
[1:17:48] Gracious heavenly father, we just count
[1:17:50] it honor privilege to be here.
[1:17:54] be amongst all those that you've saved,
[1:17:57] Lord, and encouraged our hearts through
[1:18:00] the week
[1:18:02] to just come and sit under your presence
[1:18:06] to be around the son of God's ministry
[1:18:10] because you sent gifts among us.
[1:18:14] We just love you, Lord. We appreciate
[1:18:18] all that you're doing,
[1:18:21] Lord. to answer those questions, Lord,
[1:18:24] that are on people's hearts
[1:18:27] and give them a pen in their hand to
[1:18:29] write questions down when they think it.
[1:18:33] Lord, you're mindful of everything.
[1:18:38] You know the secret things. You know the
[1:18:41] dark things. You know everything that's
[1:18:44] good. And Lord, you project that good.
[1:18:48] We just ask you, Father, to be with us
[1:18:52] the remainder of this week. Be with all
[1:18:54] those that travel out of town. Lord,
[1:18:58] you're said that the harvest is ripe.
[1:19:03] Send those souls to that revival
[1:19:06] meeting.
[1:19:09] Let everyone be mindful
[1:19:12] of their neighbor
[1:19:14] in that town of Louisville.
[1:19:20] and give everyone a chance
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; just to
[1:19:25] hear your word
[1:19:27] and show forth some faith.
[1:19:30] I just ask it
[1:19:34] and all those that come
[1:19:37] service here, bless them
[1:19:40] for remaining
[1:19:43] faithful.
[1:19:45] We just ask, Father, that you be with us
[1:19:49] all. We praise your name. We worship
[1:19:52] you,
[1:19:54] Lord. There's no one we can turn to that
[1:19:58] gives us so many benefits.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Father, for these things
[1:20:04] in your precious name, Lord Jesus
[1:20:07] Christ. Amen.
