[16:33] families with the vehicle problems
[16:35] they're never
[16:37] easy
[16:38] to go without vehicles it causes a
[16:41] challenge and it disrupts the household

[17:00] today father and we ask you to lead us
[17:03] and guide us and let your will be done
[17:05] in our lives father that we're making
[17:08] the right decisions and we're getting
[17:10] real
[17:11] we're getting real in these last days
[17:13] about
[17:14] who you are
[17:17] and that you're going to be here for us
[17:18] lord and

[17:26] we praise you and thank you for each one
[17:28] in this church i know
[17:30] personally i've gone through a lot of
[17:32] health care issues lord and i've come
[17:34] through victorious and we just asked
[17:36] that each and every one of these prayer
[17:38] requests anyone out there that has a
[17:41] need father that you just
[17:43] meet him lord meet him and and lift that

[17:50] and ask you to be with us in jesus name
[17:52] we pray amen
[17:58] you may be seated this evening
[18:01] before we sing this next song i just
[18:02] want to
[18:04] share a little thought that i
[18:07] lord had placed maybe on my heart the
[18:09] last few days and
[18:11] yesterday morning i think even before
[18:13] yesterday morning though last week or
[18:15] two i'd been thinking about this thought
[18:17] about
[18:18] many times we've come to church and
[18:22] you know i'm just speaking maybe
[18:23] just from my heart you think every
[18:25] service you know minister maybe wants
[18:28] the service to be special wants the
[18:31] prayer line or wants the people to
[18:33] respond in a certain way and and they
[18:35] have that desire on their heart to make
[18:36] an impact and you know sometimes maybe
[18:39] it could be feel like oh every service
[18:41] we we're lingering or we're staying and
[18:43] i just started thinking about that
[18:44] thought of every service we come and
[18:46] then i started thinking every day we
[18:48] dedicate our lives to to the lord and
[18:51] just want to draw closer to him and
[18:53] being the most important and i was
[18:55] sharing with the family last night
[18:56] family devotions we
[18:58] we have a
[19:00] meal every several times a day we
[19:03] we you know drink water several times a
[19:06] day we have all these other things we
[19:09] take care of our physical needs and
[19:10] maybe talk to other people and get
[19:12] you know emotional love or support or
[19:14] whatever but we just want to every day
[19:17] go spiritually before the lord and
[19:20] yesterday morning i wasn't feeling led
[19:22] to read my normal direction in my
[19:24] personal devotions and so i just opened
[19:26] the bible and
[19:27] i came to across one of these accounts
[19:29] in
[19:30] the gospels
[19:32] and i started reading the scriptures and
[19:34] just the parallels the different gospels
[19:36] and
[19:36] this just really struck out to me in
[19:38] luke chapter 9 verse 23
[19:41] where jesus says and he said to them all
[19:44] if any man will come after me let him
[19:46] deny himself and take up his cross daily
[19:49] and follow me
[19:51] for whosoever will save his life shall
[19:53] lose it but whosoever will lose his life
[19:55] for my sake the same shall save it
[19:58] for what is a man advantaged if he
[20:01] gained the whole world and lose himself
[20:02] or be cast away
[20:04] and i thought back in verse 23 there
[20:06] where it says take up his cross daily
[20:10] even i was talking to sister
[20:12] shirley moore right before service and
[20:14] she made the comment every service
[20:16] coming expecting every service
[20:18] and then i'd been thinking about every
[20:19] day
[20:20] in this verse where he says take up my
[20:22] take up your cross daily and i know a
[20:24] couple sundays ago i think
[20:27] maybe a week and a half ago i was
[20:29] leading service song service on sunday
[20:31] morning and we sang the song near the
[20:33] cross a lot of times that's maybe a song
[20:35] we sing maybe on a communion night or
[20:37] it's an older song and we don't think
[20:40] maybe we just think it's just a song and
[20:42] maybe sitting through the motions of it
[20:44] and then brother matthew saying it
[20:46] sunday night and
[20:47] it's just the last week and a half it's
[20:48] just been i just keep singing this song
[20:50] and just start coming to me more and
[20:53] more and
[20:54] more real and more
[20:55] more alive
[20:57] that cross is so real and we sometimes
[20:59] maybe and singing this song we'll take
[21:00] it for granted
[21:02] but i just like this song tonight we're
[21:04] going to play a tape
[21:06] portion of a tape this evening
[21:08] brother aaron felt led to do a spoken
[21:10] word as the original seed probably about
[21:12] an hour starting right after right when
[21:14] brother branham prays
[21:16] so just the thought before we start the
[21:18] sermon we could sing this song and just
[21:21] really dedicate our lives and just be
[21:22] wanted in that cross amen so let's just
[21:25] sing that song
[21:26] jesus keep me near the cross
[21:31] jesus
[21:33] keep
[21:33] [Music]
[21:34] me near
[21:37] the cross
[21:40] there
[21:42] [Music]
[21:44] precious fountain
[21:51] free
[21:52] to
[21:54] all

[22:14] crossing

[22:19] cross

[22:31] [Music]
[22:52] near the cross
[22:56] a
[22:57] trembling
[23:00] soul
[23:02] love
[23:15] [Music]
[23:21] shed
[23:23] its beams
[23:31] [Music]
[23:36] in

[25:28] the cross
[25:30] i'll watch

[28:26] i am
[28:30] [Music]
[28:39] before we start the tape
[28:47] [Music]
[28:51] i mentioned the wrong sermon this
[28:52] evening christ is the mystery of god
[28:54] revealed as the sermon will be listening
[28:57] to this evening i think that's the one
[28:59] that was actually on my mind because i'd
[29:01] listened to it
[29:02] [Music]
[29:04] this morning for about an hour and a
[29:06] half before i knew he was going to play
[29:08] it and
[29:09] i just
[29:10] mentioned it incorrectly
[29:13] let's sing the song only

[29:26] all things are possible
[29:31] only
[29:33] believe

[30:16] believe
[30:17] [Music]
[30:20] now believe
[30:25] now
[30:27] i believe
[30:30] all things are possible
[30:41] brother branham is going to start a
[30:42] prayer he's probably not going to dis
[30:44] seat the people after the prayer but if
[30:46] you want to remain standing for the
[30:48] prayer and then just be seated right
[30:49] after the prayer that would be just fine
[30:52] amen
[31:06] the church
[31:09] that they should
[31:11] hold together with god's unchanging hand
[31:14] their
[31:15] absolute
[31:17] the word
[31:19] warning them
[31:22] as paul warned his flock
[31:25] that there be wolves enter in
[31:30] you're the same god today as you were
[31:32] then
[31:33] and that enemy is the same
[31:36] may this fellowship and bonds of love
[31:39] always exist amongst these people
[31:42] in christ jesus
[31:44] help this morning lord as we read the
[31:46] word may the holy spirit reveal it to us
[31:49] that the church might be fully
[31:51] established in the faith that was once
[31:53] delivered to the saints
[31:56] to hold them and may as you gave the
[31:58] vision some two years ago to store up
[32:02] the food
[32:04] fine healthy looking
[32:06] vegetables that i saw in the vision
[32:08] being stored here in this tabernacle
[32:11] may we today receive a whole barrel full
[32:14] of that
[32:16] granite lord our tape load
[32:19] that it might reveal jesus christ to us
[32:23] in the hour that we live to give us
[32:24] sustaining
[32:26] strength spiritual strength for the task
[32:29] that lays ahead
[32:31] granted father bless these thy children
[32:35] they're in here this morning from many
[32:37] different parts of the nation
[32:40] a hot sticky morning
[32:43] but yet we feel the presence of the holy
[32:45] spirit and all this
[32:47] we think of john wesley and calvin and
[32:51] sinki and knox finney and many of those
[32:54] even without electric fan
[32:56] or people set in halls and perspiration
[32:59] running down their faces
[33:02] the women
[33:04] well covered and dressed set in the
[33:06] audiences and perspired till their
[33:08] clothing was soaking wet
[33:11] listening to the word of god feeding
[33:13] their souls
[33:15] now we feel are that they're at rest
[33:17] some hurry under waiting the coming of
[33:19] the lord
[33:23] keep us together father
[33:25] let the holy spirit guide us and direct
[33:27] us give us long life of service for you
[33:32] give us this great message this morning
[33:34] that we're expecting out of thy word
[33:37] that it might go to each heart
[33:40] make the lips that speak lord speak
[33:42] truth
[33:44] make the heart that years be fertile to
[33:46] receive truth amen
[33:48] i may it grow into great trees of
[33:51] eternal life
[33:53] to be shining lights and red epistles of
[33:56] all man they might know that jesus
[33:59] christ has raised from the dead
[34:01] and lives among us
[34:03] make us so full of love in the fruit of
[34:05] the spirit until other men and women
[34:08] boys and girls can see the results of
[34:11] the life of christ still living in us
[34:13] after two thousand years
[34:15] from the great event
[34:17] granted father to honor thee we asked in
[34:20] jesus christ's name amen
[34:24] now
[34:26] i want to read some of the scriptures
[34:28] and i trust now that you've got your
[34:30] pencils and papers
[34:32] and
[34:33] everything ready
[34:35] and
[34:36] brother neville you're sitting still i'm
[34:38] just going to take my coat off
[34:42] excuse me for taking off my coat but
[34:44] this
[34:45] this is
[34:46] a awfully warm up here now i want you to
[34:50] return to the book of colossians
[34:53] the first
[34:55] chapter
[34:56] of clothing
[34:57] and then while we read this
[35:00] beginning with i want you when you go
[35:01] home to read the entire chapter
[35:04] of these colossians but i want you
[35:06] to
[35:07] read this morning with me from the 15th
[35:10] verse
[35:11] uh 29th inclusive
[35:14] and i'll just
[35:15] be as patient as you can
[35:18] or i feel that in this year if god will
[35:21] help me we'll reveal
[35:24] and bring into your mind all these other
[35:28] things that i have talked on all through
[35:31] the days of the tabernacle
[35:33] why i have said what i've said and why i
[35:36] have done what i have done
[35:38] this
[35:39] is why now from the 15th verse
[35:44] who is the image of the invisible god
[35:48] the firstborn of every creature
[35:51] for by him were all things created
[35:55] that are in heaven and that are in the
[35:58] earth visible invisible where they be
[36:00] thrones
[36:01] dominions
[36:03] principalities
[36:05] powers all things were created by him
[36:09] and for him
[36:13] and he is before all things
[36:16] and by him all things consist
[36:21] and he is the head of the body the
[36:24] church who is the beginning the
[36:27] firstborn
[36:29] from the dead
[36:30] that in all things he might have the
[36:33] primitive
[36:36] for it please the father that in him
[36:39] should be all fullness dwell
[36:42] should all fullness dwell
[36:44] let me put a little emphasis on that
[36:47] again this 19th verse
[36:49] for it please the father that in him
[36:52] should all fullness dwell
[36:57] and having made peace through the blood
[37:00] of his cross by him
[37:03] to reconcile all things and to himself
[37:07] by him i say whether they be things in
[37:10] earth or things in heaven watch where
[37:13] that reconciliation went
[37:16] and you that were sometimes alienated
[37:18] and enemies in your mind by wicked works
[37:22] you now
[37:24] has he reconciled
[37:27] in the body of his flesh through death
[37:30] to present you holy unblameable approval
[37:34] in his sight
[37:37] if you continue in the faith grounded
[37:40] and settled
[37:41] and not be moved away from the hope of
[37:44] the gospel
[37:46] which you have heard and which was
[37:48] preached to every creature
[37:50] which is under heaven world of i paul
[37:54] made a minister
[37:58] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[38:02] and fill up that which is bound
[38:07] behind all the
[38:09] affections of christ
[38:11] and flesh for his body sake which is the
[38:15] church
[38:17] whereof i am made a minister according
[38:19] to the dispensation of god which is
[38:22] given to me for you to
[38:25] fulfill the word
[38:28] of god
[38:31] even the mystery
[38:34] which has been hidden
[38:38] from
[38:39] age
[38:40] and from generations
[38:43] but now is made manifest to his saints
[38:48] i want to read that verse again
[38:50] even the mystery
[38:52] which has been hid from ages
[38:57] and from generations
[38:59] but now is made manifest to his saints
[39:03] to whom god would make known
[39:06] what is the riches
[39:08] of the glory of this mystery among the
[39:12] gentiles
[39:13] which
[39:14] is christ in you the hope of glory
[39:19] whom
[39:20] we preach
[39:22] warning every man and teaching every man
[39:25] and all wisdom that we might present
[39:28] every man perfect in christ
[39:31] jesus
[39:33] or unto i also labor striving according
[39:36] to the working which worketh in me
[39:40] mightily
[39:42] now
[39:43] for a text
[39:45] i want to take out of there
[39:48] this for a text
[39:49] basically upon the entire bible
[39:53] but i want to
[39:55] title this
[39:58] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[40:02] christ being the mystery of god reveal
[40:04] now
[40:05] i talk it in order as a sunday school
[40:08] lesson so we could all read together
[40:11] and
[40:12] and uh have this fellowship together
[40:16] now
[40:18] god's secret mystery
[40:21] he had before the world began
[40:24] now back in the back part of god's mind
[40:30] there was something that he was trying
[40:32] and was going to achieve
[40:35] and he had a motive and doing it
[40:39] in order to let himself be expressed
[40:43] because first
[40:45] there wasn't even a moon star
[40:48] atom molecule or anything he was god
[40:53] but he exactly wasn't god at that time
[40:56] because god is an object of worship and
[40:58] there wasn't nothing to worship him
[41:01] so in his great
[41:03] mind
[41:04] he wanted these attributes
[41:07] to be expressed
[41:09] and in him was love
[41:12] in him was to be father in him was to be
[41:16] son
[41:17] in him was to be a savior in him was to
[41:20] be a healer all these great attributes
[41:22] that we see already expressed they were
[41:26] in god
[41:28] so my opinion the first thing that he
[41:30] made was angels
[41:32] and then they worshipped him and that
[41:34] made him god and he started from there
[41:37] as in previous messages i have tried to
[41:40] explain it
[41:41] break it down
[41:42] and now
[41:44] then when angels begin to worship him
[41:46] that was before there was even a
[41:48] molecule in the earth
[41:51] there was nothing
[41:53] it was all darkness there was no sun
[41:55] there's no moon no stars no nothing
[41:57] then he was god as he asked job where
[42:00] was you when i laid the foundations of
[42:02] the world
[42:02] i think when the morning stars sang
[42:05] together the sons of god shouted for joy
[42:08] now
[42:09] where were you see that's way back
[42:11] before the earth now god
[42:14] had a purpose
[42:16] and a hidden mystery
[42:19] and that's what i want to speak on to
[42:20] the church this morning the hidden
[42:23] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[42:25] before the world ever began
[42:28] and how that it's unfolded itself right
[42:30] down to this present hour that we're
[42:32] living praise the lord
[42:34] then you will understand clearly then
[42:37] you see on uh i believe what is being
[42:40] done
[42:41] god's great
[42:42] mystery of how it's a secret he kept it
[42:45] a secret nobody know nothing about even
[42:47] the angels didn't understand it
[42:50] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[42:52] under our seventh uh
[42:55] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[42:58] there was silence
[42:59] jesus when he was on earth
[43:02] they won't know when he would come he
[43:03] said it's not even the son himself don't
[43:06] know when it's gonna happen
[43:07] see god has this all to himself
[43:10] it's a secret
[43:12] that's reason there was silence in
[43:14] heaven for a space for a half hour and
[43:15] seven thunders earth their voices and
[43:18] john was even forbidden to write it
[43:20] see the coming of the lord that's one
[43:23] thing he hasn't revealed yet
[43:25] how he will come and when he will come
[43:27] it's a good thing that he doesn't
[43:29] no
[43:30] he has showed
[43:32] or revealed it in every type that's in
[43:36] the bible
[43:37] therefore the entire bible is the
[43:40] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[43:44] the entire bible is an expression of one
[43:48] goal
[43:49] that god had one purpose he wanted to
[43:52] achieve in the entire bible and all the
[43:55] acts of the
[43:57] the believers in the bible has been
[43:59] entitled and expressing what god's great
[44:03] goal is and now in this last day he has
[44:06] revealed it and shows it
[44:08] and god's help you see it right here
[44:10] this morning what the lord has had in
[44:13] his mind all along and has expressed it
[44:16] therefore you can see the great meaning
[44:18] of what it's been to know this and then
[44:20] try to bring it to the people see and
[44:23] then you don't i haven't went into
[44:26] details to try to explain it as god has
[44:28] revealed it to me
[44:30] now
[44:30] if you want to mark this down i've got
[44:32] so many places i want to read from
[44:34] and now
[44:35] in in the book of saint luke the 24th
[44:38] chapter of saint luke
[44:40] we find out it's
[44:43] it is the two of the apostles on the
[44:45] road to emmaus
[44:47] and jesus
[44:49] stepped out after his resurrection
[44:52] and they were on the road to over to
[44:54] emmaus
[44:56] going along the road thinking and
[44:58] talking and weeping on account of israel
[45:01] his
[45:02] death and how they seen him suffer
[45:05] for what they thought was of no
[45:08] value at all they took their lord and
[45:11] crucified him and
[45:12] and they were going along that weeping
[45:14] and he stepped out from the roadside and
[45:17] begin to talk to them
[45:19] about christ
[45:21] he said oh
[45:23] fools and slow to understand don't you
[45:26] know that all the prophets and the
[45:28] psalms
[45:29] see what was he doing
[45:31] identifying himself
[45:34] to these apostles
[45:36] that all of the prophets
[45:39] and all of the psalms
[45:41] and everything
[45:42] was him expressed
[45:45] see
[45:47] and now the reason i never talked to
[45:49] preach this morning was because i
[45:51] thought in teaching we would understand
[45:53] it better than just to take a text and
[45:55] skip over it we just uh teach it
[45:59] he was saying that all the psalms and
[46:01] all the prophets spoke of him
[46:05] well therefore that shows that all of
[46:07] the old testament all of the new
[46:10] testament and all of the psalms the
[46:13] singing the songs that were sung were
[46:15] sung of him
[46:17] take the 22nd psalm and sing it and
[46:20] compare it with the morning of the
[46:21] crucifixion see my god my god why has
[46:24] thou forsaken me all my bones they stare
[46:27] at me they pierce my feet and my hands
[46:29] yet all those things are them singing
[46:32] that psalm down there in the temple and
[46:33] crucifying the very onesie see those
[46:36] great religious leaders
[46:39] those great man those great teachers
[46:41] and yet so blinded
[46:44] that was reading the prophets
[46:47] and was singing the songs and doing the
[46:50] crime that they said they would do
[46:55] the same thing is taking place this
[46:57] morning
[47:01] now listen close because
[47:03] i ain't going to even pay attention to
[47:05] what that clock says i want you to get
[47:08] this so you can see here basically in
[47:12] the beginning
[47:14] the very thought that god
[47:16] had in his mind he hid it from all of
[47:20] those scholars
[47:22] and
[47:23] just a number a selected
[47:26] predestinated number
[47:28] a predestinated people was the only ones
[47:31] that heard it
[47:33] i now search back the scripture down
[47:35] through the age of the prophets and see
[47:37] if it wasn't the same thing
[47:41] now and jesus here referring them to the
[47:44] prophets and the psalms he said they all
[47:47] spoke of him
[47:49] see
[47:50] and here these jewish teachers rabbis
[47:53] doctors of the law professors
[47:56] have did exactly like they had done
[47:58] before
[47:59] now notice
[48:00] again he said search the scriptures for
[48:03] they are they that testify of me
[48:08] search the scriptures the scriptures the
[48:10] entire scriptures
[48:12] what am i trying to do to show you that
[48:14] this bible is the thing that's right
[48:18] the other day standing in a hospital
[48:19] room
[48:21] talking
[48:22] a sister had asked me to explain about
[48:24] the nominations why we was against
[48:26] denominations
[48:28] uh with some denominational people
[48:31] you see it's got to come back to the
[48:34] word because the word is god
[48:38] and jesus declaring the same here that
[48:41] the word is him
[48:44] you can't make the scripture contradict
[48:46] itself
[48:47] in the beginning was the word awards
[48:49] with god and the word was god and the
[48:50] word made flesh
[48:52] amen
[48:54] now
[48:55] here he says search the scriptures
[48:57] they testify me
[49:00] in them you think you have eternal life
[49:02] and that's true
[49:03] and they are the ones that bear record
[49:05] of me
[49:07] and i'm bearing record of them
[49:09] and if i do not the works has promised
[49:11] that i would do then don't hear me
[49:14] but if i do the works and you can't
[49:15] believe me believe the works because
[49:16] they testify
[49:18] that he is the word
[49:20] oh it looks like it couldn't be any
[49:22] plainer thing
[49:25] all right
[49:26] now
[49:27] search the scriptures he said moses and
[49:30] all the laws and so forth and the
[49:32] prophets and psalms spoke of him and
[49:34] again he said the scriptures testify of
[49:36] him
[49:37] he is the principal theme of the entire
[49:40] bible
[49:42] if you read the bible and don't see
[49:45] christ
[49:46] in every verse of it go back and read it
[49:48] again
[49:50] if you can't see christ in every verse
[49:52] of the bible then you read it again
[49:54] because you missed something
[49:56] the bible is christ he is the word
[50:00] when you read in the beginning god
[50:02] created there's christ
[50:04] see
[50:04] every from that to the amen in
[50:06] revelations is every word testifying of
[50:09] jesus christ
[50:11] that's why these added books that are
[50:13] called the second book of daniel in uh
[50:16] the book of the maccabees uh
[50:18] adds purgatory and stuff like that see
[50:20] it's not spoken of in the scripture see
[50:23] it doesn't theme up with the rest of it
[50:24] there's no place to place purgatory in
[50:26] there there's no place to place
[50:28] intersection of saints and things
[50:30] there's no place in there for that
[50:31] there's no place for denomination
[50:33] there's no place for for creeds outside
[50:35] of the bible
[50:38] so when you see those things they just
[50:40] don't come into the picture
[50:42] and that's why people has added those
[50:44] and got their their their jigsaw puzzle
[50:46] all mixed up
[50:47] man they can't make it right same
[50:49] yesterday and forever but if the things
[50:52] put together right there's the entire
[50:54] picture of the fall and regeneration the
[50:58] whole picture of creation god's whole
[51:00] plan revealed right in jesus christ
[51:04] amen that's the whole picture set
[51:07] together every little crooked corner
[51:09] it's just like no i don't mean to be
[51:11] sacrilegious for this but it's just like
[51:14] putting a jigsaw puzzle together
[51:16] that's why we got pictures today it
[51:17] looks horrible
[51:19] say we are believers the cow picking
[51:20] grass up on top of the tree
[51:23] don't work that's when they say he's
[51:24] ever way but just of a certain same
[51:26] yesterday and forever all but a certain
[51:28] thing see then you ruin your picture
[51:30] the bible said he is the same
[51:32] amen saint john 5 or saint john 14 12 he
[51:36] said he he anybody he that believeth on
[51:39] me the works that i do shall he do also
[51:41] well that was for another age there you
[51:43] got your picture wrong again
[51:45] you got a man fishing out in the desert
[51:47] for fish
[51:48] and a bunch of hot saying well there's
[51:49] no fish i had see see you've got to
[51:52] bring him back to where he's fishing at
[51:53] galilee where there's plenty of fish you
[51:55] see
[51:56] you you got to make the picture look
[51:57] right it's god's great picture and
[51:59] there's only one way you'll see it that
[52:00] when you see jesus christ
[52:02] there's the entire bible he's the
[52:04] principal theme of the bible now you
[52:07] realize that any of these places here
[52:09] you could take a text it's just hard for
[52:11] a preacher to hold his peace you look
[52:12] like you want to keep going with it but
[52:14] you've got to get back to what we're
[52:16] teaching on
[52:28] the bible is a prophetic book
[52:30] it's a historical book
[52:32] it's a book of love it's a book of songs
[52:36] it's a book of life
[52:37] and in there you find christ he was in
[52:40] the prophets
[52:42] he was in the psalms
[52:44] he was in the history and he also in the
[52:47] bible is the things that is to come
[52:51] so he was before and after what does
[52:54] that making then the same yesterday
[52:56] today and forever and you inject
[52:58] something in there that doesn't make him
[53:01] the same yesterday and forever brother
[53:02] lee where do you go to
[53:04] you got an awful picture there
[53:06] for he was the history
[53:08] see and he is the prophet
[53:11] he is the psalms he is everything
[53:14] and if you can't make him everything and
[53:16] the same what's your picture look like
[53:21] do you see it
[53:22] all right he is the thing
[53:25] he was the prophets he was in them he
[53:27] was in the psalms he was in the history
[53:31] and he is the things to come the same
[53:33] yesterday and forever hebrews 13 8 if
[53:35] you're writing it down
[53:37] he should be then
[53:39] he should be the principal if that's
[53:42] what he is and we believe it don't we
[53:44] yes amen
[53:45] then if he is that then he should be the
[53:48] principal theme of our talking
[53:53] of our thinking
[53:55] of our singing
[53:56] of our walks
[53:59] he should be the principal theme of our
[54:02] life
[54:04] if he's the principal theme of the bible
[54:06] and the bible is in us then he should be
[54:08] the principal theme of everything that
[54:10] we do say our thing amen
[54:12] should be christ amen
[54:14] is that right all right
[54:17] since we think this since he's been
[54:20] made the head of all things to us that
[54:23] colossians said so here he's the head of
[54:25] all things to us
[54:28] for he was made for us
[54:32] which we are considered all things
[54:34] he said what about the sinner he was
[54:36] made to be the judge of the sinner
[54:39] if he don't accept it
[54:41] he was made the glory for the believer
[54:43] who does accept it so their thing all
[54:46] things was made by him and for him
[54:49] and it takes a night
[54:51] to express the glory of the day
[54:55] it takes the vessel of dishonor to
[54:57] express the the love and care for the
[54:59] vessel of the honor
[55:02] it takes an evil woman
[55:04] that would wear immoral clothes and and
[55:07] cellar morals to express the virtue of a
[55:12] decent genuine lady
[55:15] it takes a crook and a thief in a man
[55:18] to express the genuineness of a real
[55:22] believer a real christian it takes the
[55:24] hypocrite to show up the believer
[55:27] what he is
[55:29] so all things was made by him
[55:33] and
[55:34] since he was made all thing
[55:38] made for all of us all things was made
[55:41] far by him
[55:43] then
[55:44] since that is true
[55:46] we should make our identification should
[55:49] be
[55:50] with him we should be identified
[55:53] ourselves with him because he has
[55:56] identified himself with us
[55:59] we should be identified with him
[56:02] how by living for him
[56:05] not just a confession
[56:07] so many people take a confession say i
[56:09] say it's got to this place now are you a
[56:12] christian i'm methodist
[56:15] oh that's a long ways from being making
[56:17] yourself known as a christian or look
[56:18] what the methodist does
[56:20] i'm baptist
[56:22] look what the baptist does
[56:24] i'm catholic look what they do see
[56:26] but
[56:28] the only way that you can actually be a
[56:30] christian is for christ to identify
[56:33] himself in you
[56:36] how we got some a stinger there i hope
[56:38] everybody on the tape gets that too
[56:41] see
[56:42] you say i'm pentecostal that don't mean
[56:44] a thing
[56:46] it's christ identified in you
[56:50] that's when he has recognized you
[56:53] so i spoke of tongues devils does too
[56:57] i shouted the mohammedans buddhas and
[56:59] everything shouts the indians scream at
[57:00] the snake danes
[57:02] there are
[57:04] they all do cults clans and everything
[57:06] else scream and holly holler and shallow
[57:07] the baseball game
[57:09] but when christ is identified in you
[57:12] identifying himself saying you are
[57:14] christ-like which the word christian
[57:16] means to be christ-like
[57:18] there's your identification
[57:21] all right
[57:22] now
[57:24] and since he is our identification
[57:27] then we should be identified with him
[57:30] by living for him notice
[57:32] god has had a threefold
[57:36] purpose
[57:37] in this great
[57:39] mystery secret
[57:41] god in his great mystery
[57:44] secret
[57:45] that he had before the world began
[57:48] he's got a threefold purpose in it and
[57:51] now what we want to
[57:53] go up on this morning is what is that
[57:56] threefold purpose
[57:59] now i believe by the help of the of god
[58:01] who's present
[58:03] and he he'll show it to us
[58:06] um
[58:07] now
[58:08] if he had this threefold purpose
[58:11] we want to find out what is this
[58:13] threefold purpose the first thing was
[58:16] that god
[58:18] wanted to reveal himself to the people
[58:22] he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god
[58:26] who covered all space time and eternity
[58:29] he could not is too great
[58:32] to ever be revealed to people because it
[58:35] would be too mysterious how could that
[58:38] great being
[58:39] that never did began
[58:41] that after you went beyond the cycle of
[58:44] hundreds of billions and trillions and
[58:46] trillions of years of life space
[58:49] and on out into the infinite
[58:51] into the eternity
[58:53] and a great creature
[58:55] that
[58:56] was all that and still is yes
[59:01] but what he wanted to do he loved
[59:04] fatherhood
[59:06] or he was a father
[59:08] and the only way that he could express
[59:11] it
[59:11] was to become a son
[59:14] a man
[59:16] that's reason jesus kept saying the son
[59:18] of man see they didn't know what he's
[59:20] talking about many of them
[59:21] but now you get it
[59:24] he wanted to express himself that was
[59:26] his one of his great threefold purposes
[59:29] was to express himself
[59:32] identify himself with human beings to
[59:35] reveal himself in christ
[59:38] secondly
[59:39] to have the preeminence
[59:41] in his body
[59:42] of believers that is his bride that he
[59:45] might live in people now he could do
[59:49] that in adam and eve but sin separated
[59:51] them so now there had to be some way to
[59:52] get it back again
[59:54] oh my oh no this this is rich to me just
[59:58] even think of it see
[1:00:01] see what god's purpose was
[1:00:03] now why didn't he just keep adam and eve
[1:00:05] like that then he would never been able
[1:00:07] to express his fullness
[1:00:10] his full attribute
[1:00:12] because he could be a father there
[1:00:14] that's true but also he's a savior you
[1:00:17] say how do you know he was he is because
[1:00:19] i've had the experience
[1:00:22] amen he is a savior
[1:00:25] and he had to express that and how could
[1:00:27] he do it only through christ
[1:00:29] how could he be a son only through
[1:00:30] christ how could he be a healer only
[1:00:32] through christ see all things were wound
[1:00:36] up in that one person
[1:00:38] jesus christ
[1:00:40] oh my
[1:00:42] goodness
[1:00:43] when i when i think of it i i just see
[1:00:45] denominations passed off the scene
[1:00:47] everything else is going to when i see
[1:00:49] god's great purpose revealing himself
[1:00:52] and having
[1:00:54] first to reveal himself in christ the
[1:00:56] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:00:58] and then to bring that
[1:01:01] fullness of godhead bodily
[1:01:04] into a
[1:01:05] people
[1:01:07] that he could have the premises the
[1:01:10] oversight the leading another tonight if
[1:01:13] you didn't get the tape i preached there
[1:01:14] one night on
[1:01:16] a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:01:18] paul
[1:01:20] a prisoner
[1:01:21] see when god gets you to be his prisoner
[1:01:25] then you can't do nothing but what the
[1:01:27] spirit says do
[1:01:29] paul with all his great intellects
[1:01:32] he taught he was taught by gramalia to
[1:01:35] be a great a priest or rabbi someday
[1:01:38] and he had high invasions he was
[1:01:40] intellectually a great man
[1:01:44] great authority
[1:01:45] great man in the nation
[1:01:47] but he had to sacrifice every bit of it
[1:01:52] to become part of the word
[1:01:55] to express jesus christ
[1:01:57] he knowed what it was to say uh he had
[1:02:00] an ocean to go someplace some brethren
[1:02:02] he called him but he was forbidden by
[1:02:04] the spirit
[1:02:06] to do his own will
[1:02:09] oh if
[1:02:10] if people have spiritual can pick that
[1:02:12] up
[1:02:15] he was forbidden to do his own will
[1:02:18] he only could do the spirit forbid me
[1:02:22] he was a prisoner to christ
[1:02:25] then this little fortune teller one day
[1:02:27] who you know paul know he had power to
[1:02:29] cast that devil out
[1:02:32] but he could only do it
[1:02:34] as god willed it
[1:02:36] day after day she followed him crying
[1:02:39] out after him but one day the spirit
[1:02:40] gave him permission then he rebuked her
[1:02:43] the spirit that was in her see he knowed
[1:02:46] what it was to be a prisoner
[1:02:48] moses his intellectuals he had to lose
[1:02:51] them
[1:02:52] in order to find christ to be a prisoner
[1:02:54] that when god got all the world beat out
[1:02:56] of him and all these
[1:02:58] mighty man that he wasn't standing the
[1:02:59] presence of that pillar of fire that day
[1:03:01] he was found speechless he didn't even
[1:03:03] couldn't even talk he said god had a
[1:03:06] prisoner then
[1:03:07] see you won't try it to your own
[1:03:08] searching then god had to do this man
[1:03:11] endowing with power
[1:03:14] enough that he could go down there and
[1:03:15] he said lord i told pharaoh what you
[1:03:17] said he wouldn't do he said then
[1:03:20] take this thou rock
[1:03:23] god speaking
[1:03:25] that's god's word
[1:03:27] go out there and point it towards the
[1:03:29] east he called for flies and flies come
[1:03:32] into creation because he had a prisoner
[1:03:35] that pharaoh couldn't pay off with
[1:03:37] nothing nobody else could turn him
[1:03:39] knowing he was a complete prisoner in
[1:03:42] the chains of god's word bound up
[1:03:45] only to thus saith the lord
[1:03:48] oh god can get prisoners like that
[1:03:51] now that's when he can express the
[1:03:54] preeminences you see he he's got the man
[1:03:57] or the person so that he knows nothing
[1:03:59] but christ
[1:04:01] you get what i mean
[1:04:02] all right that's secondly first to
[1:04:05] express himself completely god in christ
[1:04:08] second to have the premises by this in
[1:04:11] his church which is his body of the
[1:04:12] bride
[1:04:13] to he could have the premise to express
[1:04:15] himself through them
[1:04:17] all right and thirdly to restore the
[1:04:20] kingdom to its rightly position that
[1:04:23] fell by sin by the first adam
[1:04:26] back to where he walked in the cool
[1:04:28] evening with his people
[1:04:30] talked with them
[1:04:32] fellowship with them
[1:04:34] and now
[1:04:35] sin and death had separated them from
[1:04:38] his presence and his
[1:04:40] entire expression do you read it
[1:04:44] before the foundational world to express
[1:04:47] all of his his
[1:04:49] his attributes what he was therefore if
[1:04:52] any trinitarian here well just let
[1:04:54] yourself loose a minute
[1:04:56] you can see that father son and holy
[1:04:59] ghost is not three gods
[1:05:01] it's three attributes of the same god
[1:05:06] it's expression father he was who wanted
[1:05:08] to be a father he was a father
[1:05:10] he was the son
[1:05:12] and he is the holy ghost and the father
[1:05:14] and the holy ghost is the same spirit
[1:05:15] don't you see
[1:05:18] you get it
[1:05:19] not three gods
[1:05:21] the devils told you them things to make
[1:05:23] an idolatry out of you
[1:05:25] it's one god
[1:05:28] expressed in three attributes
[1:05:31] to be father to be savior to be son to
[1:05:34] be healer see
[1:05:36] his expressions
[1:05:39] i want to coast just a little bit so
[1:05:40] that even people listening to the table
[1:05:43] get the idea that can see
[1:05:45] it would take me around around that
[1:05:47] clock just
[1:05:48] each one of those subjects but i hope
[1:05:50] i'm making it clear enough that you can
[1:05:51] see what i'm coming to
[1:05:54] god
[1:05:55] expressed in jesus christ
[1:05:58] who was both father son and holy god the
[1:06:01] fullness of the godhead volley now the
[1:06:03] complete fullness of the goddamn volley
[1:06:05] dwells in his church the preeminence
[1:06:07] amen
[1:06:09] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:06:11] all christ was poured into the church
[1:06:13] the believers
[1:06:14] not denomination we'll get to that in a
[1:06:15] few minutes and it'll take out your mind
[1:06:17] forever
[1:06:19] show you what causes that by the help of
[1:06:21] god if he'll just permit it to us
[1:06:24] what's his purpose now express himself
[1:06:27] as a son
[1:06:29] see
[1:06:31] and now
[1:06:32] that in here might draw the fullness of
[1:06:34] the godhead bodily i've got claushes
[1:06:36] laying here right before me
[1:06:38] that
[1:06:39] all through the scripture that's what
[1:06:40] god's purpose was then through this life
[1:06:43] of this son his cross of blood it says
[1:06:44] you're of his cross that he might
[1:06:46] reconcile to himself
[1:06:49] a body a bride which is eve second eve
[1:06:53] and god give it in a type like he did
[1:06:55] moses and all of the same thing he did
[1:06:57] in adam and eve given a type that they
[1:07:00] were
[1:07:01] christ and the bride he is the second
[1:07:03] adam the church is the second eve
[1:07:06] and as long as the second eve
[1:07:08] compromises against the word isn't she
[1:07:10] doing the same thing the first eve did
[1:07:15] trying to say it well it was for some
[1:07:17] other age
[1:07:18] and we'll get to that in a few minutes
[1:07:20] whether he said that it was for another
[1:07:22] age how can it be another age when he is
[1:07:24] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:28] but god has purposed that and hid it
[1:07:31] from the eyes of the prudent and wise
[1:07:34] and reveal it to the predestinated babes
[1:07:37] who are predestinated to receive it
[1:07:40] that's reason watch down through the age
[1:07:41] whenever that light hits them they turn
[1:07:43] it away and flashed it away and great
[1:07:44] intellectuals and i'm great priests
[1:07:46] standing there there's rabbis from great
[1:07:48] teachers and authority like different
[1:07:50] ones like nicodemus them the man
[1:07:53] polishing scholarship and he couldn't
[1:07:55] even understand it
[1:07:57] and there was those great priests stood
[1:07:59] out there and rabbis who were taught in
[1:08:01] that word my they knowed it
[1:08:03] intellectually and he said you are of
[1:08:05] your father the devil and it is works
[1:08:08] you'll do think of it holy man you
[1:08:10] couldn't but your finger nowhere on
[1:08:11] their life or their father's life or
[1:08:13] their grandfather's life or their great
[1:08:14] great great great great grandfather's
[1:08:16] life if they did they died and shame is
[1:08:18] stoned to death
[1:08:19] but he understands jesus calling that
[1:08:22] group a bunch of devils
[1:08:25] religious people
[1:08:28] now
[1:08:29] oh
[1:08:31] the great revelation now
[1:08:32] now to restore back
[1:08:36] his
[1:08:37] kinship
[1:08:39] to bring back now he had to let them get
[1:08:41] lost you understand it he had to let
[1:08:43] them sin put them all free more he he
[1:08:45] could not make them sin
[1:08:48] and remain god and then punish him for
[1:08:50] something he made him do
[1:08:52] but when he put man on partnership with
[1:08:54] him then let man act as a free moral
[1:08:57] agent
[1:08:58] see the same thing he's got you on today
[1:09:01] see
[1:09:03] you act any way you want to
[1:09:05] you're free mortal asian so therefore if
[1:09:07] he put the first like that he has to put
[1:09:09] the second like that he has put everyone
[1:09:11] like that or he acted wrong in the first
[1:09:13] place
[1:09:15] but everybody is on that same basis
[1:09:18] now notice him
[1:09:19] and bringing that back
[1:09:21] and letting that man do that and knowing
[1:09:23] that he would do it
[1:09:25] nobody would do it but what did it do it
[1:09:27] displayed his attribute as savior
[1:09:30] and the whole purpose that is left in
[1:09:32] jesus christ
[1:09:34] to become god himself to take the
[1:09:36] penalty of his own law
[1:09:39] death
[1:09:40] to die to redeem the wife that was lost
[1:09:43] by rejecting him when eve went away from
[1:09:46] the word she went away from her mate
[1:09:48] and when the church goes away from the
[1:09:50] word to a denomination she rejects and
[1:09:53] commits fornications
[1:09:56] with the world of man's wisdom rejecting
[1:10:00] the authority of god's word
[1:10:04] that sound clear
[1:10:06] the bible said committing spiritual
[1:10:08] fornication
[1:10:10] any word in the bible that's rejected or
[1:10:13] has any self-interpretation put to it is
[1:10:16] absolutely rejecting and committing
[1:10:20] adultery against the god that is your
[1:10:22] husband
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:25] an adulteress never enters the kingdom
[1:10:26] of heaven we know that
[1:10:28] now
[1:10:29] see that's what eve done at the first
[1:10:31] place
[1:10:33] i notice again now what's his threefold
[1:10:35] purpose manifest himself in jesus christ
[1:10:38] to come into the body by jesus christ to
[1:10:40] have the premises so what restore back
[1:10:43] eden
[1:10:45] bring back that which lost that's the
[1:10:47] only thing out of order
[1:10:49] all the rest of these things was in
[1:10:51] order
[1:10:52] but he had to let put man on pre-moral
[1:10:54] agency to fall so that he might
[1:10:57] be a savior to display what's in him
[1:11:00] see his attribute of savior something
[1:11:03] had to be lost and the very thing that
[1:11:05] man fell and become lost he become the
[1:11:08] savior of that taking his own law and he
[1:11:12] could not do it he's that great jehovah
[1:11:14] that covered all space time see he
[1:11:15] couldn't do anything he had to become a
[1:11:16] man and he took kinship with the man
[1:11:19] that was lost amen and become a man god
[1:11:23] made flesh
[1:11:25] hallelujah
[1:11:27] i think i'm excited but i'm not
[1:11:30] something inside
[1:11:34] god
[1:11:35] it came from god to become me
[1:11:39] to take my sin upon him that he might
[1:11:41] make me him
[1:11:43] amen back to his great purpose of sons
[1:11:46] and daughters of god for he is a eternal
[1:11:49] father
[1:11:52] that attribute was in him
[1:11:54] see so that had to be displayed now see
[1:11:58] the whole threefold purpose
[1:12:00] see
[1:12:01] to express himself he wants to become i
[1:12:05] the the
[1:12:06] world is lost now he has to express
[1:12:09] himself in a man
[1:12:12] to become a savior through the
[1:12:13] reconciliation of the blood
[1:12:16] from his cross
[1:12:17] i had to become
[1:12:19] that
[1:12:20] to die in order to save and to bring
[1:12:23] himself back into
[1:12:25] the church to have the preeminences in
[1:12:28] his church now remember it can not and
[1:12:31] will not and never will be and never has
[1:12:34] been a denomination
[1:12:37] he has to have the perimeter system he
[1:12:39] is the word
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:45] how can any creed be injected in there
[1:12:48] it's a
[1:12:49] it turns the church into a prostitute
[1:12:52] to take any man's words of any creator
[1:12:55] any denomination if it quickly is marked
[1:12:57] in revelation 17 as a in harlots
[1:13:01] the roman catholic church being the
[1:13:02] and the protestants being a harlot
[1:13:04] exactly as clear as any person could
[1:13:06] read it we've come through the church
[1:13:07] ages and you can see that in those those
[1:13:09] tapes if you desire
[1:13:12] exactly then anything that joins itself
[1:13:14] with a creed outside of the bible is the
[1:13:17] in the sight of god
[1:13:19] done the same thing eve did god away
[1:13:21] from the word which is christ
[1:13:23] oh my god all right now we see his
[1:13:26] mystery
[1:13:28] he had hid in his mind before the
[1:13:30] foundation of the world
[1:13:32] now would you just like to read a little
[1:13:34] of this
[1:13:35] let's just read it uh if you've got
[1:13:36] plenty time we'll we'll read it now
[1:13:38] let's just all turn just for one reading
[1:13:41] anyhow to um the book of ephesians
[1:13:45] and let's begin at the the first chapter
[1:13:47] of the ephesians
[1:13:49] to read
[1:13:51] and now
[1:13:52] as the sunday school lesson goes on now
[1:13:54] in this threefold manifestation
[1:13:57] of christ
[1:13:58] let's read paul
[1:14:00] an apostle of jesus christ by the will
[1:14:02] of god
[1:14:03] now watch it's not addressed to the
[1:14:05] world
[1:14:06] but to the saints which are at ephesus
[1:14:09] and to the faithful
[1:14:11] in
[1:14:12] christ jesus how do you get into christ
[1:14:15] jesus
[1:14:16] by joining church
[1:14:18] by birth
[1:14:20] by one spirit first corinthians 12 we
[1:14:23] are all baptized into one body
[1:14:27] right that's the ones he's talking to
[1:14:29] that he addressed the outside world
[1:14:31] we can't talk to the center on this
[1:14:33] because he knows nothing about it
[1:14:34] paul didn't address it to no sinners he
[1:14:36] said this is to that that group there
[1:14:38] that's in christ jesus
[1:14:41] grace be unto you and peace from god our
[1:14:43] father and from the lord jesus christ
[1:14:45] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:14:47] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[1:14:48] with all spiritual blessings
[1:14:51] we're bound in
[1:14:53] heavenly places in christ
[1:14:58] heavenly places oh how which had time
[1:15:01] you've got it marked i hear my bible
[1:15:02] about heavenly places what is heavenly
[1:15:04] places
[1:15:06] heavenly places just for a moment is a
[1:15:09] believer's position in christ
[1:15:12] where the believer stands in christ in
[1:15:13] heavenly places
[1:15:15] according as he has chosen us listen
[1:15:17] close
[1:15:18] chosen us in him
[1:15:22] before
[1:15:23] the foundation of the world
[1:15:28] when did he choose us
[1:15:30] before the foundation of the world when
[1:15:33] his great hidden mystery
[1:15:36] his great secret he chose us in christ
[1:15:40] before the foundation of the world
[1:15:43] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:15:45] before him in
[1:15:48] what
[1:15:50] love
[1:15:51] having what
[1:15:53] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:15:56] children by jesus christ to himself
[1:15:59] according to
[1:16:01] the good pleasure of his will
[1:16:06] predestinated there's the mystery
[1:16:10] he before christ
[1:16:12] or anything else is ever on earth you
[1:16:14] see his great mystery
[1:16:16] that he chose the bride knowing eve
[1:16:20] would fall from disbelieving the word
[1:16:23] knowing that she would fall but he would
[1:16:25] choose a bride that would not fall
[1:16:29] that would hold that word regardless
[1:16:32] of what all the rest of the world had to
[1:16:34] say about it they would hold to that
[1:16:36] word
[1:16:38] they are predestinated to stand there
[1:16:43] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:16:46] predestinated the church to that great
[1:16:49] glorious stand
[1:16:50] now you see a secret
[1:16:52] what too to restore fallen eve
[1:16:56] as she was a pre-figure
[1:16:58] of the church
[1:17:00] and now notice as god opened up the side
[1:17:04] of adam and took out e
[1:17:07] by his own flesh and blood
[1:17:09] and divided his spirit from masculine
[1:17:12] and feminists to finish and put it in
[1:17:14] eve
[1:17:15] took the rib from under his side
[1:17:18] and made eid out of it so god did the
[1:17:20] same thing amen
[1:17:22] taken
[1:17:23] out of the side of christ the blood and
[1:17:26] the water
[1:17:27] and christ is the word and taking the
[1:17:30] word and making up his church eve
[1:17:33] see
[1:17:34] back to himself again redeemed by the
[1:17:36] blood that was coming from his body
[1:17:41] you see it now
[1:17:42] amen great mystery that being unfolded
[1:17:47] that's been hid since the foundation of
[1:17:49] the world but prefigured it all the way
[1:17:52] down through now what
[1:17:54] we find that he that he did that here in
[1:17:57] ephesians and many other places but
[1:17:58] that'll give you enough to
[1:18:00] now down through the ages he has been
[1:18:03] slowly unfolding this mystery
[1:18:08] can you see now
[1:18:09] now down to the how did he what happened
[1:18:12] in the pre-figure now he opened adam's
[1:18:15] side
[1:18:17] and took
[1:18:18] part of his flesh
[1:18:22] which was adam
[1:18:24] to make eve the bride has to be
[1:18:28] the word
[1:18:29] for he is the word
[1:18:32] she cannot stand on creeds she cannot
[1:18:35] stand on denomination she cannot stand
[1:18:37] on good behavior
[1:18:39] she has to stand alone on the word
[1:18:41] because she's part of it she was taken
[1:18:44] from christ
[1:18:48] and to be sure that the whole rapture
[1:18:51] now
[1:18:52] luther was apart
[1:18:54] wesley was apart the prophets was apart
[1:18:57] if there aren't a part
[1:18:59] just in the revelation they was making
[1:19:01] up the body feet toes arms and so forth
[1:19:03] until the head
[1:19:06] which we get to that in a few minutes
[1:19:08] see that makes the entire rapture
[1:19:11] it's the body of the word which is
[1:19:14] christ
[1:19:16] hey man outside of that your loss i
[1:19:18] don't care how good you are
[1:19:20] what your relationship is or what your
[1:19:22] fellowship is or what your organization
[1:19:24] is you're lost outside of that word
[1:19:27] being in you
[1:19:30] if ye abide in me the word
[1:19:33] my word abide in you
[1:19:35] then you ask what you will
[1:19:38] because you in the world are the same he
[1:19:39] has the preeminences
[1:19:41] he's got the rulership you're you're a
[1:19:43] prisoner to him the world is dead you
[1:19:46] have nothing more you see the rest of
[1:19:47] people living the way they do but yet
[1:19:49] you do not do it you're a prisoner
[1:19:51] you're yoked with him
[1:19:52] my yoke is easy
[1:19:55] yoked with christ with his word i do
[1:19:59] that only which pleases the father
[1:20:02] and if you can't believe that i am he
[1:20:04] then believe the word
[1:20:08] so perfect notice
[1:20:11] notice now down through the ages he's
[1:20:13] been gradually
[1:20:15] letting us out
[1:20:17] slowly unfolding the mystery through the
[1:20:20] prophets and through the times
[1:20:22] now we can just go on to that expressing
[1:20:24] himself he expressed himself in moses
[1:20:27] look at moses born in a time of
[1:20:28] persecution of the children he was born
[1:20:31] to be a deliverer
[1:20:32] he was hidden in the bull rushes just
[1:20:34] like jesus was taken down into egypt he
[1:20:36] came out he went up on the mountain come
[1:20:38] back with the commandments jesus went up
[1:20:39] to the mountain his first sermon sermon
[1:20:41] on the mount come back down with the
[1:20:42] commandments you heard him say to him of
[1:20:43] old times i shall commit adultery i said
[1:20:45] you look upon a woman who lust after her
[1:20:47] has committed adultery lawgiver priest
[1:20:50] king leader
[1:20:51] just exactly expressed himself in joseph
[1:20:54] born amongst denomination his brethren
[1:20:56] they hated him without a cause because
[1:20:58] he was spiritual he saw visions god was
[1:21:01] with him he could interpret dreams and
[1:21:03] his brothers hated him he was sold for
[1:21:05] all by his brethren but almost 30 pieces
[1:21:08] of silver just exactly like he was sold
[1:21:10] by a judas's carrot one of his brethren
[1:21:12] about 30 pieces of silver he's sowed
[1:21:14] into a ditch and supposed to been dead
[1:21:16] that's right the father and them was
[1:21:18] told that he was dead and he stole him
[1:21:20] into this ditch taken up and went to the
[1:21:22] right hand of pharaoh in the dungeon how
[1:21:24] he suffered there and and there was two
[1:21:26] saved the butler and the baker one of
[1:21:29] them lost and one saved brother and uh
[1:21:31] the butler one of them was lost and the
[1:21:33] others say just as on the cross when he
[1:21:34] was in his prison house attacked to the
[1:21:36] cross for our sins we become a prisoner
[1:21:39] one thief was lost and one was saved and
[1:21:42] just exactly then he become at the right
[1:21:44] hand of pharaoh the king that he dreamed
[1:21:46] and had the vision he was set at the
[1:21:49] king's feet
[1:21:51] and all authority in egypt was given to
[1:21:53] him
[1:21:55] his vision had to come to pass he might
[1:21:57] have stuttered of it many times while he
[1:21:58] was in that prison down there his
[1:22:00] whiskers growing out and so forth but he
[1:22:02] studied that someday his vision had to
[1:22:04] come to pass so it lingers got to happen
[1:22:07] as i spoke last night or not wednesday
[1:22:09] night you're at the service see it has
[1:22:11] to happen when god says so it's got to
[1:22:13] happen it's a vindicated prophet and it
[1:22:15] has to come to pass because it's god's
[1:22:16] word and the word comes only to the
[1:22:18] prophet
[1:22:20] the word prophet means a revealer of the
[1:22:22] divine written word as same as it does
[1:22:24] the fourth teller
[1:22:26] there's seer notice
[1:22:28] and the seer how the one yours telling
[1:22:30] forth he's divinely vindicated by
[1:22:33] foreseeing and it comes to pass if there
[1:22:35] be one whose prophet will speak to you
[1:22:37] and tell you certain things is going to
[1:22:39] happen and if it don't happen don't
[1:22:40] listen to him but if it does happen then
[1:22:41] i'm with him you better fear him because
[1:22:43] i am with him you see that's there's the
[1:22:45] vindication there where you know where
[1:22:46] it's the truth or whether it is god is
[1:22:48] speaking back to his word to his people
[1:22:51] by people see god only speaks through
[1:22:53] man
[1:22:54] i am the buying year of the branches of
[1:22:56] vine doesn't bear fruit the branches
[1:22:58] talk bears the fruit of the vine
[1:23:01] notice it's always been that way now we
[1:23:03] find joseph then that when no man could
[1:23:07] touch or come to pharaoh without first
[1:23:09] seeing joseph
[1:23:11] no man can come to the father only by
[1:23:12] the son
[1:23:13] and when joseph left the throne the
[1:23:15] sound of trumpets every knee bow
[1:23:19] joseph is coming forth
[1:23:21] glory
[1:23:22] someday every knee will bow and every
[1:23:24] tongue will confess when he leaves the
[1:23:26] throne of his father see to come forth
[1:23:28] everybody will bear witness that he's
[1:23:30] the son of god you're either years too
[1:23:32] late then do it now yes amen
[1:23:36] now we notice
[1:23:38] that through the types we could take
[1:23:39] even david as he spoke up a while ago
[1:23:42] going off his throne rejected by his own
[1:23:44] people going up the same mountain
[1:23:47] mount of olives as is going over to his
[1:23:49] prison he was going to his prison house
[1:23:52] because he was rejected of his brethren
[1:23:55] and all his own people he went up
[1:23:58] weeping that was the spirit of christ in
[1:24:00] him to be rejected as you looked up over
[1:24:02] jerusalem and went and said jerusalem
[1:24:04] how often a rejected king
[1:24:08] 800 years later the son of david stood
[1:24:10] on jerusalem up there above jerusalem
[1:24:12] rejected and wept over jerusalem it said
[1:24:15] now your hour has come that's right
[1:24:19] all those saints typing
[1:24:22] just in type but yet the mystery was he
[1:24:24] that man didn't know what they were
[1:24:26] doing
[1:24:27] they only
[1:24:28] knew that they were led by the spirit to
[1:24:30] do something now holding it back in the
[1:24:33] last days for the great revelation
[1:24:35] but expressing it
[1:24:37] express himself and moses and david and
[1:24:39] joseph and elijah and all down through
[1:24:42] you we could take each one of those
[1:24:43] prophets and bring their lives out and
[1:24:44] show and express jesus christ perfectly
[1:24:46] exactly
[1:24:48] yet never giving his secret in full
[1:24:50] waiting for to make it known in the last
[1:24:53] days
[1:24:54] waiting for it to be fully comprehended
[1:24:57] see before he could express it if he
[1:25:00] told the whole thing because the bible's
[1:25:02] written in mysteries
[1:25:03] jesus thanked the father fart
[1:25:06] see that it was ruled in mysteries now
[1:25:08] the coming of the lord is in mystery we
[1:25:10] don't know when he's coming how he's
[1:25:12] coming but we know he's coming
[1:25:14] see and so is all the mysteries of god
[1:25:17] waiting for this last day
[1:25:20] after he's already been completed then
[1:25:21] he reveals and shows what he's done
[1:25:24] oh my never gave his mystery and four
[1:25:27] it's just like this comparing the seven
[1:25:29] seals
[1:25:30] now when god used martin luther for the
[1:25:33] coming out for that first church of that
[1:25:35] church age they want to use uh john
[1:25:37] wesley and he gradually uh brought them
[1:25:39] out and was revealing in them that
[1:25:41] church age when we went goes back
[1:25:43] through the bible now and find out but
[1:25:45] in the last days the reason that was
[1:25:47] such a tremendous thing that he spoke up
[1:25:50] here and showed those seven thunders and
[1:25:51] looked like my life magazine that packed
[1:25:53] that circle of a cloud and light there
[1:25:56] that they could not understand and don't
[1:25:58] know it yet
[1:25:59] but here telly go there and wait for
[1:26:02] these mysteries to be
[1:26:04] revealed in here months before it
[1:26:06] happened
[1:26:07] and then it happened it exactly the way
[1:26:09] he said it would do did you notice in
[1:26:11] that picture even that arranged on the
[1:26:13] right when he's being materialized
[1:26:14] coming down with his wings back his head
[1:26:16] sitting sideways there it is right there
[1:26:18] in the picture
[1:26:19] just exactly months before it happened
[1:26:21] told here that he's going to bring the
[1:26:23] body of believers together to reveal
[1:26:27] take up them lost in here come
[1:26:29] luther through he only preached
[1:26:31] justification just pound it away
[1:26:33] in that age he didn't know what the age
[1:26:35] was here come wesley through and he
[1:26:37] pounded his age through see a lot of our
[1:26:40] faults come from it the other church is
[1:26:42] raising up and here come pentecost
[1:26:44] pounding away
[1:26:45] they organized went right back into
[1:26:47] death again as we'll get to in a few
[1:26:48] minutes right back in depth and then
[1:26:51] comes a revelation of the mystery
[1:26:54] to reveal what it's all been about where
[1:26:56] are these little doctrines like luther
[1:26:58] brought out catechism and everything
[1:27:00] else and wesley brought this set and the
[1:27:01] other and these other things and
[1:27:02] pentecost brought organization just the
[1:27:04] same and father son holy ghost baptism
[1:27:06] and things not knowing any different
[1:27:08] cause then come back in the last days
[1:27:10] and pick up all these mysteries and
[1:27:12] clearly explain it
[1:27:15] reveal it why it's all the last days
[1:27:19] when this great mystery that god had in
[1:27:21] his heart is being revealed do you get
[1:27:23] it

[1:27:50] began to hear it maybe a month ago
[1:27:53] and i'd hear a portion and i'd go back
[1:27:55] and hear it again
[1:27:58] i'd read a portion and then i'd hear it
[1:27:59] too
[1:28:00] it just became so real so living
[1:28:03] and i was speaking to brother dan evans
[1:28:05] the other day and he says that's a tape

[1:29:06] glory makes

[1:29:16] unworthy
[1:29:21] of such
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:27] when he
[1:29:29] was on
[1:29:31] the cross
[1:29:34] i
[1:29:35] was
[1:29:36] on his mind one more time

[1:30:17] was on
[1:30:19] the cross
[1:30:22] i
[1:30:23] was on
[1:30:25] his mind
[1:30:29] to think that he knew what eve was going
[1:30:31] to do
[1:30:32] and how adam was going to take his place
[1:30:35] next to her
[1:30:37] to redeem her back
[1:30:40] because it was something he was going to
[1:30:42] do
[1:30:43] and express that
[1:30:45] knowing that you and i would need a
[1:30:47] savior he said i'll be that one
[1:30:50] i'll give my life and
[1:30:51] you get there in gethsemane and he's
[1:30:53] he's kneeling there in the in that
[1:30:55] physical body and he's asking his father

[1:30:59] father is there another way to do this
[1:31:02] is there another way for this to be
[1:31:05] accomplished without me having to go
[1:31:07] through that
[1:31:09] and and brother branham and it just
[1:31:11] really went a place where he says it's
[1:31:13] up to you son
[1:31:15] god is being
[1:31:16] it's your choice you're going to have to
[1:31:17] make and he says not my will but your
[1:31:20] will be done
[1:31:22] on how much how much we thank god that
[1:31:24] he stood today let's stand
[1:31:28] amen what a savior
[1:31:31] nobody like him there's just nobody like
[1:31:34] him
[1:31:35] and you know but he was thinking of you
[1:31:39] you were on his mind
[1:31:41] he knew you were part of that brother
[1:31:42] branham says away in the back part of
[1:31:44] his mind
[1:31:46] you were part of that brother branham
[1:31:48] uses the word predestinated and he says
[1:31:50] i know that that stumbles somebody he
[1:31:53] said but it's his foreknowledge
[1:31:55] he knew he knows all things he wasn't
[1:31:58] going as we've heard well i like you but
[1:32:01] i don't like you no no no
[1:32:02] he knew the decision each one of us
[1:32:04] would make he knew that today he would
[1:32:06] say lord that's me
[1:32:08] i have a call back to that amen
[1:32:11] appreciate that
[1:32:12] of our lord lord we we just want to say
[1:32:14] thank you
[1:32:16] this message christ is a mystery of god
[1:32:18] reveal about four hours long but
[1:32:22] just listening to it and hearing your
[1:32:24] prophet he was just a man also
[1:32:27] a man called to to to minister to to
[1:32:29] take this and
[1:32:31] and open and and unveil the scriptures
[1:32:33] not him but you through him using that
[1:32:35] voice lord
[1:32:37] and the excitement and the joy in his
[1:32:39] life to see that he was included that
[1:32:41] and that's us today lord to see that
[1:32:43] we're included in that our name is
[1:32:45] written there also you said you would
[1:32:47] not lose a single one those whose names
[1:32:50] are written in the palms of your hand
[1:32:51] lord you would not lose a single one
[1:32:54] lord
[1:32:55] sometimes we might wonder sometimes we
[1:32:57] might say oh
[1:32:58] it looks shaky right by now i'm having a
[1:33:00] hard time i'm going through a rough time
[1:33:02] in life
[1:33:03] but lord you've seen us on the other
[1:33:05] side already lord
[1:33:07] we just want to say we thank you we love
[1:33:09] you but one of the things that your
[1:33:10] prophet expressed
[1:33:12] even at the beginning of this message
[1:33:14] lord
[1:33:15] that we ought to love one another
[1:33:18] that we ought to pray for one another
[1:33:20] that we ought to encourage one another
[1:33:22] lord
[1:33:24] i don't know who they are who is and who
