[31:48] ask the
[31:51] congregation if you have something upon
[31:53] your
[31:54] heart that you ask now this is between
[31:57] you and the Lord and as he's looking
[31:59] down at you and your head is bowed in
[32:02] reverence to him if you would raise your
[32:05] hand and say Lord you know the petition
[32:08] that's on my
[32:09] heart pray that you would Grant it
[32:12] Heavenly Father we come before you in
[32:14] the
[32:15] name above all names the name of Jesus

[32:43] uplifting hand that every
[32:47] request would be
[32:50] granted father we love you we thank you

[32:55] be if we could bring our requests to you
[32:58] and lay them at your
[33:01] feet pray father for our brother nol
[33:04] tonight Lord that your spirit would be
[33:07] upon him and as he ministers to us
[33:10] father may we

[33:32] opportunity to come together and worship
[33:34] we don't want to ever take it for
[33:35] granted in Jesus name
[33:39] amen we remain
[33:42] standing brother Aaron if you have a
[33:43] song to introduce our brother as I said
[33:46] before I've heard brother nol just speak
[33:48] one time and I thoroughly thoroughly
[33:53] enjoyed it when he spoke so I'm looking
[33:55] forward to tonight and hearing what the
[33:58] Lord has placed upon his heart to give
[34:01] to
[34:03] us
[34:05] Jesus
[34:08] Jesus
[34:12] Jesus there's just
[34:15] something
[34:17] about that
[34:20] [Music]
[34:23] name
[34:25] Master say
[34:27] [Music]
[34:31] Jesus like the
[34:35] fragrance
[34:36] After the
[34:39] [Music]
[34:41] Rain
[34:43] Jesus
[34:46] Jesus
[34:49] Jesus let all
[34:52] Heaven and Earth Proclaim
[35:01] Kings and
[35:03] kingdoms shall all pass
[35:07] away but there's
[35:12] [Music]
[35:17] something while you're standing if you'd
[35:20] open your Bibles to John chapter 1 and
[35:23] we'll read verses
[35:25] 1-5
[35:28] and then we'll just drop down to verse
[35:31] 14 I've been studying the life of Jesus
[35:34] Christ because brother manam made a
[35:35] statement I'll get into that a little
[35:38] later but it caused me to look to go
[35:41] back and what it was Jesus Christ who
[35:43] was he what was he like what was he like
[35:45] as an individual and then how does that
[35:48] relate to me so John it said in John one
[35:52] it says in the beginning was the word
[35:54] the word was with God and the Word was
[35:56] God the same was in the beginning with
[35:58] God and all things were made by him
[36:00] without anything and without him was not
[36:03] anything made that was made it goes in
[36:06] him was a life and the life was the
[36:09] light of men and the light shined in the
[36:12] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[36:14] it not and then in verse 14 it says and
[36:17] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[36:19] us and we beheld his glory the glory as
[36:21] of the only begotten of the father for
[36:23] the grace full of grace and truth and
[36:26] let's pray
[36:29] heavenly father it's an awesome
[36:32] responsibility to stand before the
[36:35] purchase of your
[36:37] blood We Stand Lord not as ministers
[36:40] with our own
[36:41] thoughts but Lord we try to become the
[36:44] channel through which you can
[36:46] flow because Lord if you will flow
[36:48] through me and your words will be that
[36:50] which is spoken then lord it's no longer
[36:52] my words but Lord it'll be yours not
[36:56] that I'm thus saying the Lord or
[36:57] anything like that but Lord you chose
[37:00] ministers that through ministers you
[37:02] could Minister unto your under the
[37:04] congregation you can Minister unto the
[37:06] Saints and so Lord I'm asking you this
[37:09] evening Lord just through me Minister
[37:12] unto your bride for I ask it in Jesus
[37:15] Christ's name amen you can be
[37:20] seated I was going through brother
[37:22] brandom was I I read I read and listen
[37:25] to the messages quite often and brother
[37:28] Bram in God's power to
[37:30] transform he makes a
[37:32] statement he said Jesus Christ was God
[37:35] himself
[37:37] manifested because he W Jesus Christ was
[37:42] Jesus Christ was God himself manifested
[37:44] because he was a son because he was
[37:46] begotten but it was just a tabernacle
[37:49] for him to dwell in no man has seen God
[37:52] at any time but the only begotten of the
[37:54] father has declared him and God built
[37:56] him a house a body to live in and come
[37:59] down so we could touch him and I began
[38:03] to think about that I began to pray
[38:05] about that where does God dwell today
[38:09] I'm looking at him you literally are the
[38:12] body of God you are the body of Jesus
[38:15] Christ so you have now you are now the
[38:18] house that God himself lives in and that
[38:22] has certain
[38:23] implications because the way that God
[38:25] lived and manifest ested and expressed
[38:27] himself through the body we call Jesus
[38:29] Christ is the same way God is wanting to
[38:32] live and express himself now through
[38:34] you Jesus Christ said I don't do what
[38:37] I'm doing because I want to do what I'm
[38:39] what I want to do he says I do because
[38:41] this is what the father that sent me to
[38:43] do I'm doing only because he has
[38:45] directed me I'm doing it only because I
[38:48] have I'm under the leadership and
[38:49] direction of My Father which is God
[38:52] himself when I I was raised in a Baptist
[38:54] Church and so you know
[38:57] trinitarianism and so sometimes when I
[38:59] read the word well I think of that
[39:01] Letter's on a page and Jesus Christ was
[39:04] a man that lived 2,000 years ago and now
[39:06] he's up in heaven someplace and now this
[39:09] thing called the Holy Ghost is something
[39:11] that dwells in us and tries to correct
[39:13] us and lead us and guide us but when you
[39:15] begin to realize they're all the same it
[39:17] say in the beginning was the word this
[39:20] word when you translate it it's the
[39:22] logos and so when you if I if if you
[39:24] don't mind me using it it's the logos
[39:27] that now dwells in you it was the logos
[39:30] that came and dwelt in their body we
[39:32] call Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit is
[39:34] the logos now dwelling in you and to me
[39:36] this takes on a different perspective
[39:39] because it makees it takes care of all
[39:40] the trinitarian stuff I've been
[39:42] programmed too from time I was a child
[39:45] and it makes me realize that there
[39:47] Eternal all sufficient all Supreme
[39:50] Being that is what dwells in
[39:52] me that is what dwells in you and as us
[39:57] and and what God does not want you to
[39:59] live a Christian life because you
[40:01] can't what he's wanting is for you to
[40:04] die out to yourself so he can live his
[40:07] life through you because his life is the
[40:10] only one that he will accept as a
[40:13] Christian we go and we try to live this
[40:15] we know that we know there are certain
[40:16] principles we're supposed to live by
[40:18] we're supposed to live a certain way and
[40:20] act a certain way and dress a certain
[40:21] way and all of this if you do all of
[40:23] that you're a good Pharisee come on but
[40:26] say if it's God inside of you doing the
[40:29] things that he wants to do through you
[40:31] it's no longer a phariseeism but now you
[40:33] become the living manifestation of God
[40:36] himself and that is what's trying God is
[40:38] trying to accomplish in the generation
[40:40] in which we are now living God sent us a
[40:42] prophit for the one of the reasons was
[40:45] to take a bride and prepare that Bride
[40:47] for a rapture we are the time we in my
[40:50] opinion we're at the end time I don't
[40:52] see how this mess can go on much longer
[40:55] I'm looking for the changing of my my
[40:56] body this one's getting kind of old and
[40:58] I'm getting tired of it so I'm looking
[40:59] for the new one okay but I I also
[41:03] understand that there is something that
[41:04] the bride itself has to manifest before
[41:07] God takes her out of here we are to
[41:09] become the final let's
[41:12] see revelations 10:7 in the be let's
[41:15] see yeah come
[41:17] on in the days of the voice of the
[41:19] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[41:21] sound the mystery of God should be
[41:25] finished we we don't realize it maybe
[41:27] but we are to be that manifestation we
[41:29] are to be the revelation of God in this
[41:31] generation and say how can that possibly
[41:35] happen it's because God wants to so live
[41:37] inside of you until it's no longer you
[41:39] living but it's himself living himself
[41:41] through you and and this is anyway this
[41:44] became this became the thought that I
[41:46] began to work on in John 1:18 it says no
[41:49] man has seen God at any time but the
[41:51] only begotten of the son which is in the
[41:52] bosom of the father he hath declared him
[41:55] he ha made him known through G the life
[41:58] of Jesus Christ we can look at that we
[42:00] can read in the scriptures and we can
[42:01] say oh yeah this is how God look we
[42:04] understand what God is like because we
[42:06] see them we see them in Jesus Christ but
[42:09] God in my opinion God updated him in
[42:12] this generation he sent me a
[42:14] prophet I see Jesus Christ in that man
[42:18] he wasn't Jesus Christ he wasn't deity
[42:21] he was a man he was a sinner saved by
[42:23] grace he's no better no worse than I am
[42:25] or any of the rest of us here but yet he
[42:27] was able to so yield himself to the god
[42:30] that dwelt in him until he actually be
[42:32] able to manifest the attributes of God
[42:39] himself it goes on going back to what is
[42:42] Jesus Christ says in Isaiah 9:6 it says
[42:45] For unto us a child is born unto us a
[42:48] son is given the government should be
[42:50] upon his shoulder so who is the son who
[42:53] is the son that Isaiah is speaking of
[42:55] here and his name Shall be Called
[42:57] wonderful the counselor the Mighty God
[43:01] the Everlasting father the Prince of
[43:04] Peace he is the summation of everything
[43:06] God
[43:07] is he was the logos and the logos is is
[43:11] the the logos is the full entity the
[43:13] full expression of what God is and so he
[43:16] became that full expression that's when
[43:18] the logos was made flesh and when that
[43:20] logos was made flesh then he began to
[43:22] declare this is the nature of what God
[43:25] is well if that same logos now dwells in
[43:28] us then we then the same attributes the
[43:31] same nature the same things that God
[43:33] expressed through that body now he's to
[43:34] be expressing itself through us it's not
[43:38] about
[43:40] us get yourself out of the picture as
[43:42] much as you possibly can it's not about
[43:45] us it's what we allow him to do through
[43:48] us I mean I I when I when I when I try
[43:51] and I
[43:52] Minister I don't want it to be about me
[43:55] I want to be the channel through which
[43:57] God can flow yeah my personality enters
[44:00] into it I am very much aware of that
[44:02] some people don't like it well I'm I'm
[44:05] stuck with it it's okay but we have to
[44:07] begin to understand our personality
[44:10] enters into how we act I mean it entered
[44:12] into brother bradam look at his life it
[44:15] entered in into Peter and James and John
[44:17] and all the rest of them their
[44:19] personality and Paul you look at their
[44:21] personality you look at the way they
[44:22] were like yeah their personality was
[44:24] there but yet God was able to take those
[44:26] vessels and he was so able to come and
[44:29] live inside of those vessels until those
[44:31] vessels began to declare and began to
[44:33] express the very nature of God
[44:36] himself and this is where we have to
[44:38] come now brother Braman possessing the
[44:41] enemy Gates he says now remember he was
[44:45] now remember he was the son of God when
[44:47] he was
[44:48] born he was God's virgin born son but
[44:52] when he become the Messiah that's when
[44:54] the Holy Spirit Come on him because the
[44:56] Messiah means the anointed one so he
[44:59] didn't become the Messiah until the
[45:01] River Jordan from what I understand in
[45:04] the River Jordan was when all of a
[45:06] sudden God in his fullness came and
[45:07] dwelt within that
[45:09] Tabernacle
[45:13] and I personally believe that I was a
[45:16] part of God from the beginning I believe
[45:19] that I was in his thoughts in the
[45:21] process of times I came into
[45:24] manifestation but because I was a part
[45:26] of God from the beginning God was
[45:28] looking for himself God was looking for
[45:30] that which was a part of him from the
[45:31] beginning well if I was a part of him
[45:34] from the beginning I had to come along I
[45:36] had to accept Jesus Christ as my savior
[45:38] I had I had to repent of my sins I had
[45:40] to go through all of that I had to go
[45:42] through water baptism but then God in
[45:44] his Mercy he filled me with the Holy
[45:46] Spirit he filled me with his spirit that
[45:49] logos began to live in sight of me for
[45:51] the expressed purpose of taking me and
[45:53] changing me into his image
[45:57] brother brandham had to go through the
[45:59] same I mean there was a time he kept
[46:01] running from God and running from God
[46:02] and finally he was on his deathbed and
[46:05] all of a sudden God says when he was
[46:07] dying he God kind of spoke to him I
[46:10] don't remember the exact things but God
[46:11] would say I've been trying to get in
[46:13] touch with you I've been trying to get a
[46:14] hold of you but obviously you don't want
[46:17] to serve me so okay you're on your way
[46:20] to
[46:21] hell and that's when brother bradam
[46:23] cried outw if you'll save me I'll serve
[46:25] you right then then the healing started
[46:28] from that point on all of a sudden God
[46:31] began to take that Prophet because
[46:33] because his calling was to be a prophet
[46:36] from the beginning you know God doesn't
[46:39] have a plan
[46:41] B God chose Moses to go into Egypt take
[46:44] the people out Moses refused he even
[46:47] tried to talk his way out of it God says
[46:49] I'm sorry there is no plan B you're it
[46:52] Jeremiah wanted to quit once he said you
[46:54] didn't tell me all the problems I was
[46:56] going to have and here nobody likes me
[46:58] everybody hates me they're trying to do
[47:00] away with me this that and the other and
[47:02] so he said I'm no longer going to even
[47:03] prophesy in your name I'm going to go
[47:05] hide out and and then he says there's
[47:07] something burning within my bones and I
[47:09] can't help to do but what I'm
[47:11] doing but see now it comes down to each
[47:13] one of us God doesn't have a plan B he
[47:18] chose
[47:19] you he chose you for a purpose he chose
[47:24] you so he could express himself through
[47:28] you and all he wants you to do is die to
[47:31] yourself so he can live his life through
[47:33] you that sounds simple but we don't die
[47:36] easy but if we when we begin to
[47:39] understand what was Jesus Christ mean as
[47:41] I was studying the life of Jesus Christ
[47:43] these are the things that came into my
[47:45] mind it goes on in in in uh living dying
[47:50] buried and Rising brother bam goes on
[47:53] and say he never there never was a life
[47:55] lived like him his
[47:57] because he was the god manifested in
[48:00] flesh when he was born he was the
[48:03] expression of God he was the expression
[48:05] of what God the father is the God the
[48:08] father being loved then Jesus was the
[48:10] full expression of love his love was
[48:13] from the very first time that his little
[48:15] baby hand strok the pretty cheeks of his
[48:18] mother God so Lov the world that is the
[48:22] unlovables that he gave his only
[48:24] begotten son that whoo whoever believeth
[48:26] in him should not perish but should have
[48:28] everlasting life amen when God found me
[48:31] I wasn't worth Saving right I was out in
[48:34] the world I wasn't bad I mean I was good
[48:36] Baptist but that doesn't count for a
[48:38] whole
[48:39] lot but I was out doing my own thing I
[48:42] was living my life I I mean I wasn't bad
[48:46] but yet when I begin to take my life and
[48:48] compare it to the life of Jesus Christ
[48:50] uh there's no comparison here Jesus
[48:53] Christ is vastly superior to anything
[48:56] that I could even hope to attain to and
[48:59] so sometimes I look at his life and I
[49:01] look at the life of brother bradam and I
[49:03] look at my life and I figured there's no
[49:05] way I could ever become what you're
[49:06] telling me to
[49:08] become and so God speaks back to me well
[49:10] if you'll die to yourself and let me
[49:12] live he says I can do
[49:14] it I just don't die very easy I mean I
[49:18] do and I go to bed you know um but I
[49:20] wake up in the morning it's like when
[49:23] one guy prayed he said Lord he says I
[49:24] haven't thought of bad thought thought
[49:26] haven't said a bad word haven't done a
[49:28] bad deed but I'm going to get out of bed
[49:30] in a minute and I'm going to need all
[49:31] the help I can
[49:33] get but see this is where we are at
[49:36] brother bradam struggled you can't tell
[49:38] me he didn't struggle when I listen to
[49:40] him and he talks about I'm just your
[49:42] unworthy servant and this that and the
[49:43] other be brother BR brother Bron told
[49:46] Brother Perry green once he says you
[49:49] know where where you live and where I'm
[49:51] living he says everything you do is
[49:54] sin but he said says where God is he
[49:57] says everything I do is sin so it's a
[50:01] constant struggle to become something
[50:03] which in one way is
[50:05] unattainable but yet that's why Jesus
[50:07] Christ died when he hung on that cross
[50:10] at Calvary he died he paid for all of my
[50:13] mistakes and so I and so I rested him
[50:17] and so every time I do something that I
[50:19] shouldn't have done or think about you
[50:21] know I'm always going back to the Cross
[50:24] because see and the cross is everything
[50:26] I
[50:27] need that's my forgiveness that's my
[50:30] grace that's my Mercy the stripes on his
[50:32] back that's my
[50:33] healing when I need peace I go back to
[50:36] him because he purchased my my peace
[50:39] everything I need is at the cross and so
[50:42] I I'm always reminding myself of why did
[50:45] you go there you went there for me I was
[50:49] I I wasn't worth anything I wasn't worth
[50:51] saving but because I was your child from
[50:54] the beginning that's why you sought me
[50:56] out and because you sought me out that's
[50:58] why you called me and when you called me
[51:00] that's why I responded to you and now
[51:03] Lord I'm trying to become what I believe
[51:04] you're wanting me to become but Lord
[51:07] there's so much of me around it's awful
[51:09] hard to attain to
[51:10] that but I know that God is still
[51:12] working in
[51:16] me Jesus Christ when he was here on
[51:20] Earth he made this statement he says I
[51:23] he said I do only what the father shows
[51:25] me and that it it's not I doing the
[51:28] works but the father that dwells in
[51:33] me Jesus Christ had to give up his
[51:37] deity and become human become
[51:40] Humanity in every aspect of the of in in
[51:43] every aspect of the word he was a human
[51:46] being he he was as C he was he was as
[51:49] human as you are with all the fra fra
[51:53] Frailty that goes with being a human
[51:54] being
[51:56] we'll get to that a little bit later but
[51:58] but well maybe that's why I'm
[52:02] here he said he said brother Bram says
[52:04] come follow me he said he was complete
[52:06] God and complete
[52:09] man in in spiritual food and de season
[52:12] he says he was both human and divine he
[52:15] was a man weeping but he had but he had
[52:18] to be but he had to be God to raise the
[52:20] dead that's right I said he was a man
[52:22] hungry but he was God feeding the 5,000
[52:25] with a couple of biscuits and and fish
[52:27] five fishes that's right he was a man
[52:29] sleeping on the back of a boat but it
[52:31] was God in him that could still the
[52:33] waters for why he and his message were
[52:37] one and he said and I and my father are
[52:40] one he said my father dwells in me so he
[52:43] was the fullness of the godhead
[52:45] bodily we can read that in Jesus Christ
[52:49] we can look at the examples in Jesus
[52:51] Christ and like what Perry greenbait
[52:54] mentioned once when he was introduced to
[52:55] the prophet he said the prophet in his
[52:58] life and in his m in his ministry he
[53:00] said he updated the he updated the
[53:02] gospel to the present day because all of
[53:06] a sudden everything that Jesus Christ
[53:08] had done or was doing had done he said
[53:11] now I see that being done in a
[53:13] man and and just a sinner saved by grace
[53:17] I mean he he spoke the squirrels into
[53:19] existence he he spoke the storm out of
[53:22] existence he I mean he'd lay hands on
[53:24] the sick they would they would be they
[53:26] would they would recover I mean he did
[53:28] all these wonderful marvelous things but
[53:30] even when you look at listen to brother
[53:32] bradam talking he says I'm not doing any
[53:34] of this
[53:35] stuff he says I'm merely being obedient
[53:38] to the god that dwells in me he's doing
[53:40] these things and we say oh that's
[53:43] wonderful in the prophet but now it has
[53:45] to come down to
[53:47] us there's no difference
[53:50] here there's no difference here the same
[53:54] God that dwelt in that body we call
[53:55] Jesus Christ the same God that dwelt in
[53:58] the prophet we we call William bradam
[54:00] that same God dwells in
[54:02] you there's no difference it's merely a
[54:06] matter do you have the faith to allow
[54:08] the god that is in you to operate
[54:10] through
[54:10] you you know to me Faith is not
[54:13] believing for
[54:15] something faith is believing in someone
[54:19] and if you have faith and confidence in
[54:21] the one that made the promise then at
[54:22] that point there should be no question
[54:25] well God promis I mean I read the
[54:27] scriptures by his stripes I am
[54:29] healed well I believe that God why would
[54:33] he lie to me why would he put it in his
[54:37] word well if he made a promise to me
[54:41] okay Lord you have already healed me now
[54:43] I'm just waiting for its
[54:44] expression and I rest in that there's no
[54:48] longer the struggle there's no longer
[54:51] trying to believe and trying to believe
[54:53] there's no long I wonder if I should do
[54:54] this I wonder if I should do that and oh
[54:56] I made a mistake today I wonder if God's
[54:58] forsaken me no I rest in the fact I am a
[55:00] Son of God I know that I am warts and
[55:05] all but I know what I am I know what I'm
[55:08] called to be it's like when the brother
[55:10] was talking about be uh being redeemed
[55:14] redeem means to restore back to the
[55:16] original
[55:17] owner what's it doing it's taking us
[55:19] back from the Sinners saved by grace
[55:21] that we are it's taking us back to what
[55:23] we were in God before before there was
[55:25] the
[55:26] fall that's what redeem means it's
[55:29] bringing us back to a full relationship
[55:31] with God so we can take and we can rest
[55:34] in the fact I am his son or I you know
[55:37] the other I am his daughter whatever but
[55:40] we have to come to the place where we
[55:41] rest in
[55:43] this I mean I I did a study on
[55:47] habac that study in habac changed my
[55:49] changed my
[55:51] life God it's it's only four chapters or
[55:53] they were just before the destruction of
[55:56] Jerusalem and God had shown habac all
[55:59] the sins and all the problems going on
[56:02] and habac got righteous indignation God
[56:05] why don't you do something why don't you
[56:06] bring judgment on these people God say
[56:08] yeah it's a good I'm paraphrasing yeah
[56:10] it's a good idea I think I will I think
[56:12] I'll send the Chaldeans in they should
[56:14] do a good job and all of a sudden habac
[56:17] no no no no it has to be a different way
[56:20] they're not nice people they kill
[56:22] because they like to kill
[56:26] and that's when when you read in in the
[56:29] scriptures where Paul quotes he says the
[56:31] just shall live by faith he's referring
[56:34] back to
[56:35] habac but the faith that it's talking
[56:37] about there is not trying I got to
[56:39] believe I got to believe I got to
[56:41] believe no it's a Rel talking about a
[56:44] relationship where there is a full
[56:45] absolute
[56:47] trust in the god that has called you and
[56:51] once you reach the place where you
[56:52] actually fully trust him
[56:55] the struggle's
[56:57] over do I get sick sure I do so God says
[57:00] go to bed for a couple three days sleep
[57:02] it off bring plenty of fluids you know
[57:04] you get get a cold they say how with
[57:07] medication the cold will last five days
[57:09] without medication it'll last for five
[57:11] days just drink plenty of fluids get
[57:12] some rest okay but but but here again
[57:16] that there's no longer the
[57:18] struggle because God
[57:21] promised and I trust him what else am I
[57:25] going to trust in and so this is anyway
[57:28] this is where I where I've come in in in
[57:30] my life but but anyway it's the father
[57:33] that dwells in Jesus Christ he says
[57:34] that's the one doing the work brother
[57:36] Brown says it's the God that was
[57:37] dwelling in me he's doing all these
[57:39] works well now it's the god that dwells
[57:42] in
[57:43] you but do you have the
[57:46] faith now brother bradam just didn't go
[57:49] out and start speaking this and speaking
[57:50] that no God
[57:52] instructed I mean otherwise I want a
[57:55] nice red Ferrari park right out
[57:57] there would he do it I seriously doubt
[58:02] it but what would what would you do with
[58:05] the spoken
[58:09] word anyway we'll get to something else
[58:12] Philip said unto him show this was at
[58:14] the Last Supper Philip said unto him
[58:16] Lord show us the father that'll that'll
[58:18] suffice us that'll satisfy us the
[58:21] response from Jesus Christ is Jesus
[58:23] saided him have I've been so long time
[58:26] with you that you yet you don't know who
[58:27] I am who you don't know me yet Phillip
[58:30] you've seen me you've seen the father
[58:33] now how sayth show us the father
[58:35] believeth not that I am in the Father
[58:37] the father is in me the believe uh the
[58:39] words that I speak are you I speak not
[58:40] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[58:42] in me he does the works believe me that
[58:45] I am in the Father the father in me or
[58:47] else believe me for the very Works sake
[58:50] it goes on in Colossians 2 he says
[58:52] beware lest any man spoil you through
[58:54] philosophy your vain deceit after the
[58:56] tradition of men after the rudiments of
[58:58] the world and not after Christ for it
[59:00] says in him dwelleth the fullness of the
[59:03] godhead
[59:07] bodily Hebrews 1 and3 God who had soned
[59:10] right times in diverse manner spake in
[59:12] times past and spake in time past unto
[59:14] the fathers by the prophets hath in
[59:16] these last days spoken unto us by his
[59:17] son whom he appointed air of All Things
[59:19] by whom he also made the world who being
[59:21] the brightness of his glory and the
[59:23] expressed image of his person and behold
[59:25] All Things by the word of his power when
[59:27] he had by himself purged our sins sat
[59:29] down at the right hand of the go of of
[59:31] of the father this was the logos now
[59:34] dwelling in that body and it was that
[59:37] logos that was doing the things which
[59:39] that logos was called in that body was
[59:41] called to perform and to take care of he
[59:45] came to be the sacrifice for my
[59:47] sins he came to declare unto the people
[59:50] around him this is God this is what God
[59:52] is like and he began to to try and tell
[59:55] them but because of their because of
[59:57] their theology because of what they had
[1:00:00] been taught in the law they could never
[1:00:02] accept Jesus
[1:00:04] Christ because he was so different than
[1:00:06] what they imagined God to
[1:00:08] be I mean there one time in the law this
[1:00:11] one guy he was out there picking up
[1:00:12] sticks on the Sabbath day he wern't
[1:00:15] hurting anybody but he violated the law
[1:00:19] so they took him to word and they they
[1:00:21] asked Moses what do what does God say we
[1:00:23] have to do to this guy take him out and
[1:00:25] now the congregation Stone him to
[1:00:28] death because he violated the the
[1:00:33] Sabbath he wasn't hurting
[1:00:35] anybody but he violated one of God's
[1:00:38] Commandments how often do we violate
[1:00:41] God's
[1:00:43] Commandments but then when we come back
[1:00:45] and we look at Jesus
[1:00:48] Christ um like the woman taken in
[1:00:50] adultery everybody's going to Stone her
[1:00:52] that's what the law said so Jesus sat
[1:00:55] down and began to ride in the
[1:00:57] sand and they kept yelling at or yelling
[1:01:00] at Jesus Christ what do we do to this
[1:01:01] woman what do we do the law says we have
[1:01:03] to Stone her to death we have to kill
[1:01:04] her you know it's interesting it says if
[1:01:06] she was killed in the very Act of
[1:01:07] adultery the man should have also come
[1:01:09] right okay they should have grabed him
[1:01:12] that was probably one of the priests so
[1:01:13] they wouldn't
[1:01:16] okay but Jesus he wrote In The
[1:01:19] Sand and one by one they began to stop
[1:01:22] the stones until everybody had left
[1:01:25] in the mouth of two or three
[1:01:27] Witnesses nobody was going to stand and
[1:01:30] condemn her so Jesus didn't have to he
[1:01:34] just just go don't sin
[1:01:39] anymore that's God's mercy wow and God's
[1:01:42] Mercy is extended to us every moment of
[1:01:45] every day I think one place it says his
[1:01:46] Mercy is given to us every morning fresh
[1:01:48] every morning or something like
[1:01:53] that in John in 10 it says my sheep hear
[1:01:56] my voice and I know them and they follow
[1:01:58] me and I gave and I give unto them
[1:02:00] eternal life and they shall never perish
[1:02:02] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:02:03] my hand my Father which gave them me is
[1:02:05] greater than I is greater than all and
[1:02:08] no man can pluck them out of my hand and
[1:02:09] it goes on to say I and my father were
[1:02:14] one but you know Jesus Christ or brother
[1:02:17] bam was saying we have to come to the
[1:02:19] place where we Unite oursel with the
[1:02:22] spirit of God that is in US
[1:02:24] until we can make the same
[1:02:29] declaration that takes
[1:02:31] commitment we're we're not talking about
[1:02:33] living a law we we are not talking about
[1:02:35] attending church we're talking about
[1:02:38] establishing a relationship between you
[1:02:40] and God Amen where you interact with him
[1:02:44] every moment of every day you're
[1:02:45] sensitive to his leading you're
[1:02:47] sensitive to his calling I mean brother
[1:02:49] Bram had to live this way all of a
[1:02:50] sudden he'd be doing something and God
[1:02:52] says I need you and he would take
[1:02:53] brother Bram here and send him there and
[1:02:56] say oh that's great for the prophet but
[1:02:57] it has to come to
[1:02:59] us God did not die in brother
[1:03:02] brandom now God through that prophet he
[1:03:05] left us a message to tell us this is how
[1:03:07] you should live this is how you should
[1:03:09] act but in order for you to do that you
[1:03:12] have to have a relationship with me you
[1:03:15] have to come to the place you love me so
[1:03:17] much you'll do whatever I'm asking you
[1:03:20] to do and once you come to the place
[1:03:23] where you love Jesus what's it what um
[1:03:25] somebody asked Jesus Christ what's the
[1:03:27] greatest of all the
[1:03:29] Commandments that's easy he says the
[1:03:31] greatest of all the Commandment love God
[1:03:33] with all your heart soul mind and spirit
[1:03:35] and the second's like in love your
[1:03:37] neighbor the same way you love yourself
[1:03:39] and this in these two Commandments is
[1:03:41] contained all of the law and all the
[1:03:43] prophets W okay so love God with
[1:03:47] everything you
[1:03:49] are it's not about you it's about him
[1:03:53] it's not about you doing it's you
[1:03:54] allowing him to do through
[1:04:05] you it goes on in in in John one we we
[1:04:08] read this in him was life and the life
[1:04:11] was the light of men and the light
[1:04:14] shined in the darkness but the darkness
[1:04:16] could comprehended it not the darkness
[1:04:18] could not accept the
[1:04:19] light it goes in in in John 3:16 through
[1:04:23] 19 for God so loved the world that he
[1:04:25] gave his only begotten son that
[1:04:27] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:04:28] perish but have everlasting life for God
[1:04:30] sent not his once for God sent not his
[1:04:33] son into the world to condemn the world
[1:04:35] but that the world through him might be
[1:04:38] saved he that believeth on him is not
[1:04:41] condemned he that believeth not is
[1:04:43] condemned already because he hath not
[1:04:45] believed on in the name of the only
[1:04:47] begotten Son of God and this is the
[1:04:50] condemnation that light has come into
[1:04:52] the world and Men love Darkness rather
[1:04:54] than light because their deeds were
[1:04:58] evil that hasn't
[1:05:01] changed that hasn't
[1:05:04] changed you you I mean we talk to
[1:05:08] different people in in different stages
[1:05:09] of life and they say well I like living
[1:05:13] like I'm living I like doing my drugs I
[1:05:15] like doing my drinking I like living
[1:05:17] carousing I like living in adultery I
[1:05:18] like living
[1:05:20] this why would I want to be a Christian
[1:05:24] well okay end of argument if you're not
[1:05:28] interested why should I force it on you
[1:05:31] but see now wherever we
[1:05:33] go I I live in a bubble I created my own
[1:05:37] little bubble okay in my bubble there's
[1:05:42] love joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:05:45] meekness patience
[1:05:47] kindness and so whenever we're
[1:05:49] interacting with somebody I mean you go
[1:05:52] to the grocery store and they always say
[1:05:53] well how are you doing is we scanning
[1:05:55] your stuff so we said well how are you
[1:05:58] doing oh um yeah okay yeah good I I you
[1:06:04] know and then we get into a conversation
[1:06:06] we'll take it as far as the Lord opens
[1:06:08] the
[1:06:09] door I'm inviting him into my
[1:06:12] bubble I'm inviting him into a
[1:06:14] relationship with Jesus Christ because I
[1:06:17] don't want to live in her bubble where
[1:06:20] it's anger and Malice and hatred and
[1:06:22] strife and all the other types of no I I
[1:06:24] like living in my bubble I I will admit
[1:06:27] to that I mean I keep up rest on the
[1:06:29] news just so I don't want to be ignorant
[1:06:32] but yet I have learned not to become
[1:06:34] emotionally involved in all this garbage
[1:06:38] okay but at but when when I talk to
[1:06:41] other
[1:06:44] people you begin to talk to some brother
[1:06:46] Bram in one place says of that guy's a
[1:06:48] good Fisher and talk to him about
[1:06:50] fishing and see if God will take the
[1:06:52] conversation and turn it toward
[1:06:55] God you guy's a good mechanic we'll
[1:06:57] start talking about mechanics I know how
[1:06:59] to put gas
[1:07:01] in yeah I still know how to do that I
[1:07:03] know how to open okay but so you talk to
[1:07:06] them about
[1:07:08] mechanics and go see if God will turn
[1:07:10] the conversation if he turns it you have
[1:07:13] an open door and I will carry it as far
[1:07:17] as God will allow it to carry I mean
[1:07:20] this is how I witness okay I I don't not
[1:07:23] I don't know how other people do it but
[1:07:26] but this is this is anyway this this is
[1:07:27] the way I do
[1:07:29] it but I'm we we are the light to the
[1:07:33] world it says in him was
[1:07:36] life and the
[1:07:38] life was the light to the
[1:07:41] world what was that life it was the life
[1:07:44] of God the life of God was to shine out
[1:07:48] unto other people and those that and
[1:07:50] those that are have any interest in in
[1:07:52] in God any interest in in Jesus Christ
[1:07:54] when the light brother BR says when the
[1:07:56] light strikes the seed the seed begins
[1:07:58] to sprout and then you can draw them in
[1:08:01] and so you have but you have to shine
[1:08:02] your
[1:08:03] light if we can't tell you from the rest
[1:08:05] of the world there ain't much light
[1:08:07] showing okay um we'll leave the rest of
[1:08:11] that alone but but you have to come down
[1:08:13] to the place where you have to let the
[1:08:16] light
[1:08:18] shine it has to be in your language it
[1:08:20] has to be in your dress it has to be
[1:08:22] where you go it has to be how you
[1:08:23] interact act it if you're businessman it
[1:08:25] has to be how you conduct your business
[1:08:28] every aspect of your life it's the life
[1:08:30] of God that is in you is wanting to
[1:08:32] express itself and that is the light
[1:08:34] that has to shine unto others and unless
[1:08:36] you let the light shine they're walk
[1:08:39] they're walking in darkness and you're
[1:08:40] not giving them much
[1:08:47] hope it goes and God came in in Jesus
[1:08:50] Christ to save the
[1:08:52] world he has he was the perfect
[1:08:54] sacrifice that would pay for the debts
[1:08:57] of the men for debt for all
[1:08:59] men but for you but for that debt for
[1:09:02] you to be
[1:09:03] paid you have to accept the
[1:09:08] payment if you owe something you know
[1:09:10] you you $1,000 dollar and I go and I'll
[1:09:12] write a check and I give it to him there
[1:09:14] you take care of it nah I don't want
[1:09:17] your check tears it up and throws it
[1:09:18] away fine enjoy your
[1:09:22] debt but see that's what you're
[1:09:24] doing if all of a sudden you know you
[1:09:27] have something in your life and God's
[1:09:29] trying to help you and God is trying and
[1:09:31] all of it was paid for at the
[1:09:33] cross I I don't hear very many people
[1:09:36] talking about the cross but the cross is
[1:09:39] the center of my life the cross is the
[1:09:42] center of every all of my hopes rest in
[1:09:44] that in that one act in the in the in in
[1:09:46] the in Calvary because there he paid for
[1:09:49] everything for me and so I keep going
[1:09:52] back because that's my hope am well if
[1:09:57] you're not offering anybody else the
[1:09:59] cross if you're not offering anybody
[1:10:00] else salvation if you're not telling
[1:10:02] them about Jesus Christ if if you're not
[1:10:03] telling them about salvation was
[1:10:05] purchased for you at at at the cross of
[1:10:08] of of Calvary and you're not in
[1:10:10] introducing that to them what are you
[1:10:12] telling
[1:10:13] them brother brand in one place says I
[1:10:16] fear too much we're getting people to
[1:10:19] church we're getting them to a Doctrine
[1:10:22] we're getting them to the
[1:10:24] message but we're not getting him to
[1:10:27] Christ but see once they accept Jesus
[1:10:31] Christ from that point everything else
[1:10:35] changes they they could believe God sent
[1:10:37] a prophet that's great Satan Satan knows
[1:10:40] that he believes that but that doesn't
[1:10:42] save Satan and nor will it save anybody
[1:10:46] else but if you bring them to the Cross
[1:10:48] if you get them to have an inner if you
[1:10:50] get them to Salvation if you get them
[1:10:52] where God himself now begins to dwell
[1:10:54] inside of them then God within them
[1:10:56] begins to mold and to change their very
[1:10:58] character until they come into the very
[1:11:00] image of Jesus
[1:11:03] Christ so sometimes we put the cart
[1:11:05] before the
[1:11:10] horse there's there's something else
[1:11:12] that I
[1:11:14] I I found
[1:11:17] interesting Jesus Christ was the second
[1:11:21] Adam okay when God created Adam Adam
[1:11:25] only had one one father if you will that
[1:11:28] that was God so the nature that Adam had
[1:11:32] my opinion would have been the same
[1:11:34] nature that Jesus Christ
[1:11:36] had okay he would have to have the
[1:11:39] genetics of of
[1:11:42] God Adam was doing great in theophany
[1:11:46] form but then God put him in a temple of
[1:11:48] clay he put him in a temple of
[1:11:51] Flesh and then he took him made him help
[1:11:54] me he took out of Eve something he
[1:11:56] created another body Eve dwelt in that
[1:12:00] body but see here again you're dealing
[1:12:02] with human
[1:12:04] nature God gave man free moral
[1:12:08] agency all of us have free moral agency
[1:12:11] brother bam says in one place you have
[1:12:13] to will to do the will of God you have
[1:12:17] to make the choice to do the will of God
[1:12:22] so Satan empty he says hey this looks
[1:12:25] interesting that brought about the
[1:12:28] fall so Adam fell the whole creation
[1:12:32] fell with him but now we look at Jesus
[1:12:36] Christ when he was in was when he was
[1:12:39] the logos okay fine when he was put and
[1:12:43] all of a sudden that logos now dwelt in
[1:12:44] human
[1:12:47] flesh would that logos and human
[1:12:50] flesh
[1:12:52] succeed where Adam
[1:12:55] failed you say was that a
[1:12:57] possibility scriptures would tend to
[1:12:59] indicate it
[1:13:01] such in uh Hebrews 4 and5 for we have
[1:13:05] not a high priest which cannot be
[1:13:06] touched with the feeling of our
[1:13:08] infirmities but was in all points
[1:13:10] tempted like we
[1:13:12] are yet without
[1:13:14] sin 1 Corinthians 10:13 there is no
[1:13:18] temptation you but such as is common to
[1:13:20] man but God is faithful who will not
[1:13:22] suffer you to be tempted above what
[1:13:23] you're able but will with the Temptation
[1:13:26] also make a way of Escape that you may
[1:13:27] be able to Bear it okay and then in
[1:13:31] James it said let no man say when he is
[1:13:33] tempted I'm tempted of God for God
[1:13:35] cannot be tempted with evil neither
[1:13:36] tempteth he any man but every man is
[1:13:39] tempted when he is drawn away with his
[1:13:41] own lust and
[1:13:43] enticed then when that lust hath
[1:13:45] conceived it bringeth forth Sin Sin when
[1:13:47] it is finished it bringeth forth
[1:13:51] death for him to be tempted in every way
[1:13:54] that we
[1:13:55] are brother bam says he was all man and
[1:13:59] all God that Temple that God was
[1:14:03] dwelling in we called Jesus Christ that
[1:14:05] was in every bit that was
[1:14:08] human so he so from what I read from
[1:14:11] this he had to be tempted the same way
[1:14:13] that we
[1:14:14] are otherwise how when you pray he say
[1:14:18] well Lord I have this problem how could
[1:14:20] he relate to the problem if he had never
[1:14:22] been tempted with that problem
[1:14:27] okay after Jesus was baptized in Matthew
[1:14:30] it says when Jesus was led up out of the
[1:14:32] spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted
[1:14:34] of the devil and when he had fasted 40
[1:14:36] days and 40 nights he was afterward
[1:14:38] hungered when the tempter came to him he
[1:14:41] if you're the Son of God command these
[1:14:44] stones to be bread prove that you're the
[1:14:46] Son of God use the power that you
[1:14:49] have take the bread take the stone turn
[1:14:52] them to bread you're hungry
[1:14:54] that that why
[1:14:55] not in Jesus Christ he says man shall
[1:14:58] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:15:00] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:15:02] God says then the devil taketh them up
[1:15:05] into the holy CI sit on the P Pinnacle
[1:15:07] of the temple and sayth if you're the
[1:15:10] Son of God cast yourself down for it's
[1:15:12] written he shall save his a he shall
[1:15:14] give his angels charge over thee and in
[1:15:15] their hands th shall bear thee up list
[1:15:17] at any time you dash your foot against
[1:15:18] the
[1:15:19] stone he's saying glorify yourself you
[1:15:23] say you're the Son of God jump off watch
[1:15:25] the Angels come if all these people
[1:15:27] around watch them all of these angels
[1:15:29] descend and bear you
[1:15:31] down make the
[1:15:33] Declaration glorify yourself in the eyes
[1:15:36] of
[1:15:39] people Jesus saith unto
[1:15:42] him it's written thou shallal not tempt
[1:15:44] the Lord your
[1:15:46] God then the devil taketh up into
[1:15:48] exceeding high mountain and showeth him
[1:15:49] all the kingdom of the world and the
[1:15:51] glory thereof and he say all these
[1:15:53] things will I give you if you'll fall
[1:15:55] down and just worship me and Jesus saith
[1:15:58] un them get thee hence Satan for it's
[1:15:59] written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy
[1:16:01] God and him only will you serve he's
[1:16:03] telling bypass the cross because Satan
[1:16:06] knew that there had to be a payment for
[1:16:08] sin and if Jesus Christ happened to be
[1:16:11] the Lamb of God if he happened to be the
[1:16:13] one that the the the one that of the
[1:16:15] woman's seed he was going to have to
[1:16:17] come and he was going to have to die in
[1:16:19] order to pay the price for our for our
[1:16:21] for our sins for our salvation he's
[1:16:23] saying bypass the cross I'll give you
[1:16:25] the kingdoms of the world you just be
[1:16:27] under my
[1:16:28] control Jesus said I'm going to inherit
[1:16:30] it anyway why should I do
[1:16:35] that identified mystery of Christ he
[1:16:37] said put on the whole armor of God don't
[1:16:39] stand back like some little idea of some
[1:16:42] creat or something that you're standing
[1:16:43] by put on the whole armor of God when
[1:16:46] you go to fight against the enemy like
[1:16:48] our Lord did he showed that how the
[1:16:51] weakest of Christians can defeat Satan
[1:16:54] just with the word he had powers he
[1:16:59] could have smoked Satan anyway he wanted
[1:17:01] to but he didn't use it he just took the
[1:17:05] word and defeated him saying it's
[1:17:08] written it's written it's written so
[1:17:11] what what did he do he showed us how we
[1:17:14] can defeat Satan it's
[1:17:18] written by your his stripes you're sick
[1:17:22] by his stripes I'm heal healed but you
[1:17:24] don't feel any better that don't make no
[1:17:26] difference by his stripes I am healed
[1:17:29] God told me I'm Healed but you're still
[1:17:31] don't feel good what does that have to
[1:17:33] do with it I'm
[1:17:35] Healed now I'm just waiting for the
[1:17:40] manifestation
[1:17:43] okay we go on and what you know what is
[1:17:45] the nature of God here again we're look
[1:17:47] we're looking at him in Philippians 2:4
[1:17:50] it says look look not every every man on
[1:17:53] his own things but every man also in the
[1:17:55] things of others let this mind be in you
[1:17:57] which was also in Christ Jesus who being
[1:18:00] in the form of God thought that robbery
[1:18:02] to be equal with God but he made himself
[1:18:04] of no reputation basically he emptied
[1:18:07] himself out and he took upon him the
[1:18:08] form of his servant who was made in the
[1:18:10] likeness of men and being found in
[1:18:12] fashion as a man he humbled himself
[1:18:14] became obedient unto death even the
[1:18:17] death of the
[1:18:18] Cross who being in the form of God who
[1:18:20] being the express image
[1:18:23] for being the exact duplication if you
[1:18:26] will who every in every aspect Jesus
[1:18:28] Christ was God he was the son of God he
[1:18:31] was born the Son of
[1:18:33] God does this have
[1:18:37] privilege who being the form of God he
[1:18:39] thought not robbery to be equal with God
[1:18:41] equal with God he says he said God God
[1:18:44] likeness does God likeness mean having
[1:18:47] your own way getting what you want but
[1:18:50] Jesus was God likeness essentially was
[1:18:52] giving
[1:18:53] and spending oneself precisely because
[1:18:56] he was in the form of God he reckoned
[1:18:57] equality with God not to be a matter of
[1:19:00] getting but of
[1:19:02] giving for God so loved the world he
[1:19:07] gave and that's what he keeps
[1:19:10] doing you need healing he
[1:19:14] gives you healing do you earn it ain't
[1:19:17] no
[1:19:18] way you need salvation he gives you
[1:19:21] salvation you need a job he gives you a
[1:19:26] job you need a house he gives you a
[1:19:30] house God gives do you earn it I haven't
[1:19:34] found a way to earn anything yet I mean
[1:19:37] I look at myself and there's nothing in
[1:19:40] me worth standing before
[1:19:43] God and the only hope I have is
[1:19:46] Calvary Bey outside of Calvary I have
[1:19:50] nothing but he invites me to come
[1:19:53] Jesus Christ when after he died he he
[1:19:56] what he he went and he entered into the
[1:19:57] holiest of
[1:19:59] holies and he says now that's where I
[1:20:01] want you to follow me what is the
[1:20:04] holiest of holies it's living in the
[1:20:06] presence of God himself it's living in
[1:20:09] the presence of that shakina Glory where
[1:20:11] you are so surrounded by the shakina
[1:20:14] glory until Satan can't even get to
[1:20:18] you but we don't want to go
[1:20:20] there because we have to
[1:20:24] die we have to forsake our
[1:20:27] will to take on his
[1:20:32] will when you go through what baptism
[1:20:34] you're making a
[1:20:36] declaration you've accepted Christ as
[1:20:39] your savior you make that declaration
[1:20:41] they take you up in the Baptist R they
[1:20:43] put you in a tank of water and when they
[1:20:46] baptize you they're taking you and and
[1:20:48] they're they're typing you with
[1:20:50] dying when you go under the water that's
[1:20:53] a type of you of your
[1:20:55] death then they raise you out of the
[1:20:57] water you are to rise to a new life
[1:21:01] fully
[1:21:02] dedicated and fully surrendered to God
[1:21:06] and God
[1:21:07] alone and we forget
[1:21:13] this it says he emptied himself he laid
[1:21:16] aside the form of God he laid aside his
[1:21:18] deity he took upon him the form the the
[1:21:20] he took upon the complete character
[1:21:22] istics of a slave a person without any
[1:21:26] advantage with no rights or
[1:21:29] privileges he did not expect to be
[1:21:32] treated any different than anybody
[1:21:35] else he didn't expect to be treated like
[1:21:38] anybody other than just a servant in in
[1:21:41] in in anybody's
[1:21:42] house he didn't expect any favoritism he
[1:21:45] didn't expect to be treated
[1:21:47] better he went about serving
[1:21:51] others
[1:21:54] he goes on in Luke 416 he says and he
[1:21:57] came to Nazareth where he had been
[1:21:59] brought up and as his custom was he went
[1:22:01] into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[1:22:02] and stood up for to read and there were
[1:22:05] delivered unto him the book of the
[1:22:06] prophet Isaiah and and when he had
[1:22:09] opened the book he found the place where
[1:22:10] it was written he says the spirit of the
[1:22:13] Lord is upon me
[1:22:16] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:22:18] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:22:20] heal the sent me to heal the brok
[1:22:22] brokenhearted preach Deliverance to the
[1:22:24] captives recovering of sight to the
[1:22:25] blind to set a liberty limb that are
[1:22:27] bruised and to preach the acceptable
[1:22:29] year of the
[1:22:30] Lord that's why one of the reasons he
[1:22:34] came that was his
[1:22:36] ministry John the Baptist was offended
[1:22:39] by this well look we want the king he
[1:22:41] say I'll come as a king but not not at
[1:22:43] this time that's
[1:22:45] later but see that's now ours the same
[1:22:49] anointing that was on him is now on us
[1:22:53] as God operated this through him now
[1:22:56] that God's wanting to operate that
[1:22:58] through us we are to carry on the
[1:23:01] ministry of Jesus Christ it's not about
[1:23:05] us it's about him it's not what I do for
[1:23:08] him it's what I allow him to do through
[1:23:11] me I am just I'm just a human being I'm
[1:23:14] just a vessel that I'm hoping God has
[1:23:16] find some use
[1:23:18] for
[1:23:21] anyway
[1:23:23] and that Dan Calvary brother Brown makes
[1:23:24] a statement he says he was just one man
[1:23:27] the perfect man he gave his life and he
[1:23:29] made an example for you now what must we
[1:23:33] do now the first thing I want to say is
[1:23:35] Jesus never lived for himself his life
[1:23:38] was spent for others that's perfectly
[1:23:42] eternal life when you say you go to
[1:23:44] church and do good things that's fine
[1:23:47] but when you live your life to yourself
[1:23:50] you haven't eternal life eternal life is
[1:23:53] living for others it proved it when he
[1:23:56] come come in the Lamb of when when it
[1:23:58] come in the Lamb of God he lived and had
[1:24:00] eternal life because he did not live for
[1:24:03] himself he lived for others and you
[1:24:05] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:24:07] day and you don't live for yourself no
[1:24:09] more you live for others someone said I
[1:24:12] how can you stand and let somebody uh
[1:24:14] call you such bad names you don't live
[1:24:17] for yourself you live for others that
[1:24:20] you might
[1:24:21] redeem that
[1:24:23] man you become sons and the trouble of
[1:24:26] it is the church has forgot their sons
[1:24:28] you are Sons you're taking Christ's
[1:24:30] place you are Sons so don't live for
[1:24:32] yourself you live for others well
[1:24:34] brother vom I can live for this brother
[1:24:36] he's such a nice man he said that's not
[1:24:39] it live for the man who hates you live
[1:24:42] for that person who'd kill you if they
[1:24:44] could that's what they done to him they
[1:24:47] killed him and he died and and and and
[1:24:50] that he might save them that's eternal
[1:24:52] life when you get that in your your bism
[1:24:56] then you're facing heaven
[1:24:59] then brother branner makes a statement
[1:25:02] God wanted to accomplish three things
[1:25:04] one of them was to gain total
[1:25:05] preeminence in a man he did that in
[1:25:08] Jesus Christ now he wants the same
[1:25:12] preeminence in his body we call the
[1:25:14] bride and if we claim to be the bride
[1:25:17] he's trying to get total
[1:25:19] preeminence in us he's trying to get
[1:25:22] total
[1:25:23] control he got that in my opinion he got
[1:25:26] that in the
[1:25:27] Prophet The Prophet no longer tried to
[1:25:30] do his own thing he was always sensitive
[1:25:33] to the spirit of God he was always
[1:25:34] wanting to know well God what do you
[1:25:36] want me to do yeah he went hunting why
[1:25:39] did he go hunting because he was out in
[1:25:40] the wilderness and hopefully he can rest
[1:25:42] and relax and you know and and calm down
[1:25:45] and before he had to go back into the
[1:25:47] thick of
[1:25:50] things you know it it's
[1:25:54] interesting God came to dwell in
[1:25:57] man and he could have been born in a
[1:26:00] palace with all the Privileges that come
[1:26:02] with wealth could have enjoyed the few
[1:26:04] Pleasures that we have but instead God
[1:26:07] elected in Jesus Christ to be born to
[1:26:11] peasants in a cave with sheep and
[1:26:15] goats okay he elected he chose to come
[1:26:19] in the most humble form and expect
[1:26:22] nothing he was even willing to sacrifice
[1:26:25] his life for the Salvation and
[1:26:27] Redemption of his children this is the
[1:26:29] nature of God this is the life that that
[1:26:33] was that was in Jesus Christ that was
[1:26:37] manifested Jesus Christ tried to kind of
[1:26:41] instruct his
[1:26:43] disciples in Mark 9ine he says and they
[1:26:45] came they and they came to capernium and
[1:26:47] being in the house he asked them what is
[1:26:50] it you disputed amongst Yourself by the
[1:26:52] way way oh but they held their peace for
[1:26:55] by the way they would had dispute among
[1:26:57] themselves who should be the
[1:26:59] greatest he sat down and called the twel
[1:27:02] and said unto them if any man desires to
[1:27:04] be first the same shall be last and the
[1:27:08] servant of all you want to be great in
[1:27:11] the eyes of God become the servant to
[1:27:14] every
[1:27:15] man Mark 10 and when the 10 heard it
[1:27:18] they because James and John wanted I
[1:27:21] want to be on the right hand the left
[1:27:22] hand you know when the tenant heard they
[1:27:25] began to be much displeased with James
[1:27:27] and John but Jesus called to them and
[1:27:29] said unto them you know that that they
[1:27:31] which are accounted to rule over the
[1:27:33] Gentiles they exercise lordship over
[1:27:35] them and their great ones exercise
[1:27:37] Authority upon them it shall not be so
[1:27:40] among you whosoever will be great among
[1:27:42] you shall be your minister whosoever you
[1:27:45] would be the chiefest shall be the
[1:27:47] servant of all for a the son of man came
[1:27:50] not to be ministered unto but to
[1:27:52] Minister and to give his life a ransom
[1:27:54] for
[1:27:56] many Peter writing he says the Elder
[1:27:58] which Elders which are among you I
[1:28:00] exhort to him also an elder and a
[1:28:02] witness of the sufferings of Christ and
[1:28:04] also I partake of the glory that shall
[1:28:06] be revealed feed the flock of God which
[1:28:08] is among you taking the oversight
[1:28:11] thereof not by constraint but willingly
[1:28:14] not for filthy lucer but of a ready mind
[1:28:18] neither being as Lords over God's
[1:28:20] Heritage but being an example to the
[1:28:23] flock live Christ before them so they
[1:28:28] can see Christ in
[1:28:29] you it's not a matter of dictating
[1:28:32] dictating that that doesn't that doesn't
[1:28:34] solve anything make good
[1:28:37] Pharisees no but if we live the life of
[1:28:40] Jesus Christ before the
[1:28:42] people and they say you know that's the
[1:28:44] way I should live and that's what I saw
[1:28:46] in in brother
[1:28:47] brandham I mean he he was a man here was
[1:28:50] a sinner he had a temporary said You'
[1:28:52] fight a buds saw buds saw here was a man
[1:28:55] I mean somebody killed his dog and he
[1:28:57] was going to he was going to go shoot
[1:28:58] the guy that killed his dog some kids
[1:29:01] beat him up he went and got his rifle
[1:29:02] and he he was a dead shot he was going
[1:29:04] to kill every one of them
[1:29:06] kids he popped his head up and says
[1:29:08] you're all dead and he pulled the G bang
[1:29:10] click click click click click click
[1:29:11] click and they all ran then he picked up
[1:29:14] the same bullet stuck them in there
[1:29:16] everyone
[1:29:17] shot that was brother
[1:29:19] bam he was a price fighter
[1:29:22] you don't get in the in the ring and say
[1:29:24] now hit me softly I'm real I bruise easy
[1:29:27] don't now be gentle because you know I
[1:29:30] I'm I'm not used to this oh no he laid
[1:29:33] it on him he was a
[1:29:36] champ but that's not what God called him
[1:29:39] to
[1:29:44] be and the seed is not air in the shook
[1:29:46] brother vam he says and then and then
[1:29:48] that logos was made flesh and dwelt
[1:29:51] Among Us
[1:29:52] and now we're in St John 1 in the
[1:29:54] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:29:56] God and the Word was God and now he gave
[1:29:58] and and now as as he gave his life for
[1:30:01] us then his Spirit comes back upon us
[1:30:03] and Jesus says at that day you'll know
[1:30:06] that I'm in the Father the father's in
[1:30:07] me I in you and you in me and brother
[1:30:10] man other places that's in that day he
[1:30:12] says that's this day he says and we
[1:30:15] today are one the the church itself an
[1:30:18] attribute of God's thinking before the
[1:30:20] foundation of the world you you have you
[1:30:22] have a church so those which are in
[1:30:25] Christ was in Christ at the beginning
[1:30:28] and was his thoughts and his thoughts
[1:30:30] was his
[1:30:32] attributes John 14 I will not leave you
[1:30:34] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[1:30:36] little while the world seeth me no more
[1:30:38] but you shall see me and because I live
[1:30:41] you shall live also because at that day
[1:30:43] you'll know that I am in the Father the
[1:30:44] father's in me I am in you and you and
[1:30:46] me the disciples he began to tell
[1:30:50] them he say he says now right now I'm
[1:30:53] the light to the world but when I go
[1:30:56] away you're going to be the
[1:30:58] light and you don't take light and shove
[1:31:00] it under a bushel and hide it no you
[1:31:03] walk
[1:31:04] around you're not to be a
[1:31:07] Hermit you interact with
[1:31:10] people but how do you interact with
[1:31:13] people are you manifesting the nature of
[1:31:16] God are you're manifesting the life of
[1:31:18] God are you trying are you by the life
[1:31:20] that you live are you expressing the
[1:31:22] very nature of of God
[1:31:24] himself because that's what God's trying
[1:31:26] to do through us Jesus Christ came to
[1:31:29] manifest God he came to he came to let
[1:31:32] the world know this is what God
[1:31:34] is and now that's come to
[1:31:37] us now the only way they're going to
[1:31:39] know what God is is they have to look at
[1:31:50] you and John 1 and5 he says and this
[1:31:53] then is the message which we have heard
[1:31:54] from him and declare unto you that God
[1:31:56] is light and in him is no darkness and
[1:31:59] if we say we have fellowship with him
[1:32:00] and walk in darkness we lie and we do
[1:32:03] not the two but if we walk in the light
[1:32:06] as he is in the light then we have
[1:32:07] Fellowship one with another and the
[1:32:10] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[1:32:12] us from all sins if the musicians would
[1:32:14] like to
[1:32:17] come it was after the disciples received
[1:32:21] the Holy Spirit at the
[1:32:22] logos that's when God's life came and
[1:32:25] dwelt in
[1:32:27] them and if you look at what they were
[1:32:30] before before
[1:32:32] Pentecost and then you look at what they
[1:32:34] were after
[1:32:35] Pentecost there's a huge difference it
[1:32:38] wasn't about them trying to gain
[1:32:40] popularity it wasn't about them trying
[1:32:42] to amass wealth it wasn't about them
[1:32:44] doing something for themselves
[1:32:46] everything they did was for somebody
[1:32:49] else they walked miles what to take the
[1:32:51] gospel they were beaten they were stoned
[1:32:55] they were
[1:32:56] crucified you think oh Christian life's
[1:32:58] going to be just a just a cakewalk just
[1:33:01] a piece of
[1:33:02] cake I haven't found it that
[1:33:05] way soon as I became a Christian said
[1:33:08] and says oh now you're my enemy now
[1:33:09] we're really going to work on you right
[1:33:14] okay but I have something inside of me
[1:33:18] now I have something inside of me that
[1:33:20] is stronger than than anything else in
[1:33:22] the
[1:33:23] universe because that which dwells in me
[1:33:26] is the logos of
[1:33:28] God the very attribute of everything God
[1:33:31] is dwells in
[1:33:34] me but I have to release him I talk to
[1:33:38] the ones in India where do you SC oh I
[1:33:40] have him hidden in my heart well I says
[1:33:43] why don't you let him out once in a
[1:33:47] while they have to see him because
[1:33:51] that's why why Christ came one last
[1:33:53] quote restoration the bride he otherwise
[1:33:56] you're going to form what's known to me
[1:33:57] as a bride see all right I'll go with
[1:34:00] you you will be a part of me you'll be
[1:34:04] my bride my life will be in your body
[1:34:09] just like a husband and wife is one you

[1:37:57] brother there's
[1:37:59] not I don't know you can't say Time and
[1:38:02] Eternity in the same sentence because
[1:38:04] they don't exact exactly work together
[1:38:06] but there's not enough time in eternity
[1:38:09] to sing the Praises and talk about our
[1:38:12] Lord Jesus Christ there's just not the
[1:38:14] time there's we can't say enough about
[1:38:17] him how great he was and and looking at
[1:38:20] the life that our brother brought out
[1:38:22] that Jesus lived it it was a life of
[1:38:24] sacrifice it was a life of pure
[1:38:27] unadulterated obedience to the father he
[1:38:31] mentioned that brother brandom was a
[1:38:33] good example to us in this age of how
[1:38:36] someone can get themselves out of the
[1:38:39] way and let Jesus Christ come forth from
[1:38:42] that person I've given this
[1:38:45] testimony before here but I believe it's
[1:38:48] really the most important testimony that
[1:38:50] I could give from my family being so
[1:38:52] close to this man named William
[1:38:55] brandom my dad my grandfather on the
[1:39:00] Evans side if you listen to tapes you've
[1:39:01] heard brother Brandon mentioned the
[1:39:03] Evans Family many times and then my
[1:39:05] other grandfather on the on the wheeler
[1:39:08] side he was a deacon in the brandham
[1:39:09] Tabernacle for brother brandham I so I
[1:39:12] grew up hearing all of these stories all
[1:39:15] the time about this man this Prophet
[1:39:19] named William brandham
[1:39:22] and I'll tell you the stories were not
[1:39:26] about the Miracles they saw many
[1:39:29] miracles over and over again they saw
[1:39:32] Miracles my grandpa Evans my dad follow
[1:39:35] followed him around the country
[1:39:37] everywhere he went they followed him
[1:39:39] they they saw hundreds and hundreds of
[1:39:42] Miracles it wasn't about the Miracles my
[1:39:45] grandpa wheeler he was a deacon every
[1:39:47] service at the brandom Tabernacle and he
[1:39:50] saw the prayer lines he saw these things
[1:39:52] happen yet the stories that I heard from
[1:39:55] Grandpa
[1:39:57] Grandma were not about the Miracles they
[1:40:00] weren't as important as the
[1:40:04] man it wasn't about even all the
[1:40:07] doctrines that he preached and all the
[1:40:10] the Mysteries that he made
[1:40:13] known it wasn't about that I didn't hear
[1:40:15] those stories growing up those stories
[1:40:17] were there and they would come out every
[1:40:19] once in a while with the Miracles and
[1:40:20] different things but it was always about
[1:40:24] the spirit that came out of that
[1:40:28] man that is what made William brandom so
[1:40:32] special it wasn't because of the man
[1:40:35] William brandham but he was able as he
[1:40:38] said brother brandham said this a
[1:40:39] perfect quote he said if William
[1:40:42] brandham has if I have a gift in my life
[1:40:45] and we know he had many of them he said
[1:40:48] if I have a gift in my life it's being
[1:40:50] being able to get William brandom out of
[1:40:53] the way and he really did
[1:40:56] that they saw how love Came From This
[1:41:01] Man
[1:41:03] servitude
[1:41:04] sacrifice obedience to God and that is
[1:41:09] what impressed them it's exactly what
[1:41:12] our brother here was talking about that
[1:41:14] is what should come forth from a real
[1:41:17] Christian and he gave us a great example
[1:41:22] so that's what Christianity that's what
[1:41:26] the whole book is
[1:41:28] about is about letting God take control
[1:41:32] of us and letting that Spirit come out
[1:41:35] of us as our brother said I say it so
[1:41:38] often and even our brother said it I
[1:41:40] want to get a sign that says it's not
[1:41:42] about you on the front of the pulpit
[1:41:45] thank you brother I say it all the time
[1:41:47] and it's nice when somebody else says it
[1:41:49] for once

[1:41:56] brother brother Aaron one more song if
