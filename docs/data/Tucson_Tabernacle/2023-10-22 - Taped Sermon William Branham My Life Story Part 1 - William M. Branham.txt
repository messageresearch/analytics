sister Unice is it is that pronounced that right Caitlyn and I met them last week at Costco and I think it was the Divine Providence and we got to talking a little bit and T talked about where we went to church and he said you know back in the 60s I delivered newspapers to that church and we got to talking a little bit and came to the conclusion he had interacted with brother green it sounded like and he had said back in there he sent this later to me he said he said I met Mr Perry when I was a bicycle paper boy way back in the early 60s and Mr P Perry just so happened to have made a big impression on me as a young boy because of his unusual kindness toward me I thought that was interesting at the time I think he said he wasn't even a Christian or whatever and just had made an impact on his life and they live up in Catalina and go to a church up there and they just came to visit us this morning so welcome God bless you brother Daniel's been talking about witnessing and sharing about the Lord and what caught my attention with him as I was walking by he had a shirt on that said Jesus loves you I think it said and I said I like the shirt that struck up a conversation and he wasn't ashamed to share what the Lord's done in his life amen amen let's just stand this morning as we turn the service over to brother Aaron [Music] sing on the wings of a snow white dove just sing the course on the wings of a snow white of God sends his pure Sweet Love A Sign from [Music] above on the wings of Ave on the wings of a snow wide do God send his pure Sweet Love A Sign from [Music] above on the wings of a dove on the [Music] wings on the wings of a d amen you may be seated we got a update just a little while ago from Brother Daniel Evans saying that they've got a flight tomorrow at 11:45 to be able to come home they couldn't leave before that because the airplanes haven't come back to the airport yet I'm sure you saw the wave action and told him if that was Southern California there'd be people surfing on that and I I talked to him on the phone and I could hear the wind it was just blasting there so he asked me if I'd ever been through one of those and I said no I've never said I've been through a couple earthquakes in Southern California and those were scary enough but um so Lord willing they'll they'll have a safe trip home'll be back with us so he had sent me a text on uh Thursday I believe it was and he said don't know if we're going to make it home this weekend he says please be ready and um that makes your heart go like oh no you know but we just be began to see if the Lord would give us something and then he on Saturday he sent the information that we would listen to the life story of brother brand the one preaching 1959 in Los Angeles and um he asked me if I'd ever met brother brandom or heard of brother brandham I said no when brother Brandon passed away I had just turned six years old I was just a young boy but my parents had heard of him but didn't get to go to his service so he said just maybe share some what it's meant to you how you heard about it so yesterday as I was thinking and how many of people one thing I remember when we heard this message about brother Brandon was the folks of the Pentecostal church we belong to were asking how could a prophet of God die in such a terrible accident and it made me to think have you ever read the scriptures about some of the most most used men of God what their life was like you would say well they just had a bed of ease no it it was a struggle it it was a battle I thought of Abraham he was given a promise the father of of of the Jewish of Israel given a promise but it was not a bad of Beast there was a battle there he even lied about his own wife so he wouldn't lose his own life but because he he was a child of God God kept him thought about Moses the greatest Prophet that at that time who spoke face to face with God got to see him and there were times that Moses was not even allowed to cross into the other side you know think about that David a man after God's Own Heart who wrote most of the book of Psalms yet look look at his life Paul the first age messenger we've just gone through the book of Acts look at all that he went through he was actually killed once and the Saints prayed for him and his life came back the scripture records that but he says I'm headed to Jerusalem knowing I'm going to give my life for this gospel all the apostles with exception of John died a cruel death so why would it be any different today willing to give yourself for him whatever it takes there was Enoch there was St John St John lived to write the Book of Revelation Liv and Enoch we just know that he pleased God and he went home but if you read the story and the history everyone had their Hard Times their hard trials so the same folks that mentioned that to my parents to my dad I believe it was about how could somebody die like that he just asked him how about this great minister of yours that you all Reverend didn't he die in a rollover accent himself then they couldn't have nothing to say but I'm grateful that God sent a prophet in this day and age because where would we be you know and if if if Paul had come in this age we'd be playing Paul's recordings today but we read his writings because that's how the information was got but by the grace of God we get to hear see and some of us not too many left got to know him and meet him but we did hear about brother brandom when he was about 14 years old I had been raised a Christian in my whole life my parents love the Lord Jesus I believe they gave their heart to the Lord both of them and their teens my mom's experience with the Holy Spirit when she received the Holy Ghost she said I was bathed in a ball of fire and changed her whole life he's still the same yesterday today and forever he changes not so we were raised that way and and dad always taught taught us TR believe the Bible it's the truth it works and he he he raises his Christians me in my brother and sister and to love the Lord Jesus in all things and when this message came we moved from California came to Tucson and been here since it's going on 47 48 years now and I don't regret it God has been good to us just thinking about those things when God makes himself real to you doesn't make a difference what the world says he's my Lord he's my savior so in my own life as I I come listening to the message maybe when you first came in you you thought you you just had to know it all you had to receive it all you had to understand it all no you just had to give your heart to the Lord and I found that to be the key if you'll just trust in him give your heart to the Lord and say Lord you lead me he'll take you to the truth sir we we and I'm not saying because I got great encouragement by brothers who who knew the message brothers who love the Lord but the experience is yours and god's together and that's that's the one that holds you and raising my my daughters the same way as best we could the lord gave me a wife who believed this message who actually attended the Tabernacle when the orig Tabernacle when she was a little girl and and got to know the truth and that doesn't make us better than anybody else we should just love the Lord Jesus more for it that he's been mindful of us if we don't take that attitude that I'm better than them because I know more but let us just be a light let a testimony like like this friend that this man that you met the family they said there's something about he said brother green the way he treated me as a young boy it spoke to me you know that somebody would come and says you know I'm in a situation I'm in a place but there's something about your life and your attitude that I feel I can go and talk to you and you could pray some people don't know how to pray some people don't know how to reach God but maybe you could lead them to that Lord Jesus Christ and that would be the greatest effect of this message of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever because of you how many would would lift their hand and say that what a blessing it would be on the other side that somebody would come up to you and say but because of you I'm here today that would be a wonderful thing in in your own life maybe not the words you said maybe not how you preach them but the life you lived the love you shared and if you read this message and you hear this message what was brother bram's greatest emphasis staying true to the word of God but he spoke of the love of God you hear him how he talks about himself how he was just a rank sinner but God in his great Mercy reached out to him so how sh why should I be any different but say Lord as you had mercy on me have mercy on somebody else you know give that have that opportunity you can can't make them believe give them the opportunity to believe amen so we'll listen to the first half this morning uh and right before just a couple paragraphs before where Brother D Daniel wants us to start brother Brandon makes a a a statement he goes I don't know if the hookup is on he goes are they are they going to be able to hear and the brother comes in and he says yes he says we've got the hookups here there'll be thousands Maybe tens of thousands listening to you this morning I thought to myself when I heard that I said man if I knew 10,000 people were listening to me this morning I don't know if I had to come out but I appreciate a man that would stand up and trust in God and believe and be able to say you know what I'm waiting for and then say he's here and when he's here all things are possible let's stand the song that pleased the angel of of the Lord that please God was brother brandham said only believe all things are possible you have something before the Lord something you desire something you have great need of only believe all things are possible [Music] only only be all things are [Music] possible only believe only be only believe all things are possible holy believe now our confession Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe you may be seated right about an hour long how many is there anybody here that's not heard brother Ram's testimonies never heard it it'll be a first time our visitors here and some here he was a man he was nothing more than a man he was not an angel he was a man who surrendered and yielded something you'll hear him talk about his some of his desires and things because he was a man who gave his heart to the Lord and if he could do it so can you God bless you my thoughts I want to preach on the subject tonight if you'll show us the father it will satisfies now I wish to read for a text this afternoon just to start off the life story found over in the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter and let's begin here about I'd say about the 12th verse wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go therefore to him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come now that is kind of a text for you see if it's a life story or anything pertaining to a human being we don't glorify that and especially a man's past if it's been as dark as mine has been but I thought if we read the scripture God would bless the scripture and my thought is that here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come now I know that you're very fond of Los Angeles you have a right to be it's a great beautiful city with its Smog and whatmore yet it's a beautiful city fine climate but this city cannot continue it's got to have an end I've stood in Rome or the great Emperors and the cities that they thought they would build Immortal and dig down 20 ft to even find the ruins of it I stood where the Pharaohs has had their great kingdoms and you dig down in the ground to find where the great pharaohs ruled all of us like to think about our city and our place but remember it cannot stand when I was a little boy I used to go to a great maple tree in my country we have a lot of hardwood and then we had this maple trees the sugar maple and what we call the hard maple soft maple this great gigantic tree it was the most beautiful tree when I would come in from the fields of working the hay and and Harvesters I would love to go to this big tree and and set that down under it and and look up and I see it's great Mighty uh uh branches Sway in the wind great huge trunk and I said you know I believe that this tree will be here for hundreds and hundreds of years not long ago I took a look at the old tree it's just a snag for here we have no continuing City no nothing here on the earth that you can look at will continue it's got to have an end everything that's smle has to give away to an immortality so no matter how good we build our highways how fine we make our structures it all has to go for here there's nothing can continue just the Unseen is what continues I remember the house that we lived in it was an old log house chinked with mud I perhaps maybe many never seen a house chinked with mud but it was all chinked up with mud and the great huge logs that was in the old house I thought that house would stand for hundreds of years but you know today where that house stood is a housing project it's so much different everything's changing but now I used to see my father he was a rather a short stocky man very strong and he was one of the strongest little man that I knew of I met Mr Coots a fellow that he used to work with in the logs he was a logger and about a year ago and Mr CS is a very good friend of mine Deacon in the First Baptist Church and he said Billy you ought to be a real powerful man and I said no I'm not Mr CS he said if you took after your daddy you would be said I seen that man weighing 140 lbs load a log on the wagon by himself it weighed 900 lb he just knew how to do it he was strong I'd seen come into the place to wash and get ready for dinner when mother would call him and we had an old apple tree out in the front yard and then there was three or four small ones along towards the back and right in the middle tree there was an old Looking Glass that been broke Mar large one and it been tacked on the side of the tree with some Nails bent in kind of like what some of you cartenders listen in would call coat hangers it had been bent in to hold the glass in place there was an old tin comb how many ever seen an old tin the oldfashioned tin comb I can just see it and then there was a little wash bench just a little board with the little sling leg beneath attacked against the tree a little old half sulfur pump there that we pumped the water out and we washed at this old tree and Mama used to take meal sacks and make towels anybody ever used a meal satile well I'm sure I'm feel at home now and those big old rough towels and when she'd give us little kitties a bath she'd feel like she's rubbing a hide off every time she rub and I remember that old meal sack and she'd pull some of the strings out make little tossel to kind of decorate it up how many ever slept on a straw tick well I will say how many ever know what a shuck pillow was well brother Glover I'm at home now sure know straw tick well hasn't been too long since I just come off of one it was oh it's good sleeping cool then the winter time they take the old feather bed and lay on it no and then had to put a piece of canvas over the top of us so cause a snowb blo in the the the cracks in the house you know where the old clapboard shingles and turn up you know when the snow would sweep through it and oh I can remember that very well and then pop used to have a shaving brush ah now this is going to get you it was made out of corn Shooks a shaving brush with corn Shooks he'd take mother's old Li soap that she had made fix it up and put it on his face with this corn Shu brush and shave it with a big old straight razor on Sunday you take the um the pieces of paper stick around his collar the four CID collars and put it around the collar like this to keep the the the lather from getting on his shirt collar did you ever see that done my m i remember a little Old Spring down below where we used to go get a drink of water and get our water out of an old gourd Dipper how many ever seen a gourd Dipper well how many of you is from Kentucky anyhow well just look at here at the Kian well Mom I'm right I thought it was all ois and Aries out here but look like kuy moving in well they did strike ARL in Kentucky few months ago you know so maybe that's some of them's coming this away and then I remember when dad used to come in and take his wash for dinner he'd roll up his sleeves them little short stubby arms and when he'd pull up his arms to wash throw the water up on his face the muscle just wed in his little arm and I said you know my daddy will live to be 150 years old he was so strong but he died at 52 here we have no continuing City that's right we can not continue now let's take a little trip all of us there's every one of you here that has a life story just as I do and it's good to stroll down memories LAN once in a while don't you think so just go back and let's all go back for a while back to similar experiences as a a little children and now the first part of the life story I'll just give it a little touch because it's in the book and many of you have the book I was born in a little mountain cabin way up in the mountains of Kentucky they had one room that we lived in no rug on the floor not even wood on the floor it was just simply a bare floor and a stump top of a stump cut off with three legs on it that was our table and all those little bandoms and pile around there and out on the front of the little old cabin and W down look like where a bunch of possums have been W out there in the dust you know all the little brothers it was nine of us and one little girl and she really had a rough time amongst that bunch of boys we have to respect her yet today from the things that we did in those days she couldn't go with us anywhere we'd run her back she was a girl so she couldn't take it you know so we had and all remember that back behind the table we had just two chairs and they were made out of limb bar just Old Hickory uh saplings put together and the bottom of them laced with Hickory bark did anybody ever see a hickory bark chair yet and I can hear Mama yet all later on when we got into a place where she could have a wooden floor with those babies on her lap like this and rocking that old chair just bang did he bang did he bang on the floor I remember to keep the little ones from going out the door when she would be washing or something she'd lay a chair down and turn it kind of catac cornered across the door to keep the little ones from getting out when she had to go spring to get water and so forth and mother was 15 years old when I was born dad was 18 and I was the first of the nine children and they told me that the morning I was born now we was very poor just the poorest a poor and we did not even have a window in this little cabin it had like a little wooden door that you open I doubt whether you ever seen anything like that a little wooden door that open instead of a window you keep it open in the daytime you closed it at night we couldn't turn on the electric lights or even burn kerosene in those days we had what you call a grease lamp I don't know whether you ever know what a grease lamp was was well what do and you ever buy burn a pine knot for just take a pine knot and light it and Lay It Up on a lid it'll burn and that's smoked up a little bit but they had no francher anyhow to smoke up so it just the cabin got the smokeing it draw good because there's plenty of roof up there for it to draw through so it um and I was barned on April the the 6th 19009 of course you know that makes me a little over 2 5 now and so uh the morning that I was born mother said that uh they opened up the window now we had no doctors it was a midwife just and that Midwife was my grandmother and so when I was born and my first beginning to cry and and mother wanted to see her child and and and she more more than a child herself and when they open up the little window just at the break of day about 5:00 and the there was an old Robin sitting by the side of a little Bush as you all seen the picture of it in in my book of my life story an old Robin was sitting there just singing for all that was in him I've always loved Robins now you boys out radio land don't shoot at my birds you see they're they're they're that my birds did you ever hear the legend of the robin how he got his red breast I'll stop here a moment how he got his red breast there was a king of kings was dying one day on a cross and he was suffering and no one would come to him he had no one to help him and there was a little brown bird wanted to take them Nails out of the cross and he kept flying in the cross and jerking on those Nails he was too little to pull them out and he got his little breast all red with blood ever since then his breast has been red don't shoot him boys let him alone he was sitting at the side of the window a chirping as the robin singing and Dad pushed back the window and when they push the little window door back that light that you see in the picture come whirling in the window says my mother and hung over the bed grandmother didn't know what to say now we are was not a religious family my people are Catholic I'm Irish on both sides my father is strictly Irish brandom my mother is Harvey only her father married a Cherokee Indian so that broke a little line of the blood of the Irish and father and mother did not go to church and they married out of the church and they had no religion at all and back there in the mountains there was not even a Catholic church so they come over in the early settlers two Brams come over and from that sprung the whole generation of Brams as a geny of the family and then she opened when they opened this window and this light stood in there they did not know what to do dad had bought him Mama set a new pair of overhauls for this event he's standing with the his arms in the bib of the old overhauls like The Woodsman and loggers used in those days and it frightened them well after I'd got up maybe 10 days old or something they taken me up to a little Baptist Church called Possum Kingdom Possum Kingdom Baptist Church that's quite a name there's an old circuit preacher the oldfashioned Baptist preacher came through there about once every two months on uh the people would have a little uh service together they go sing some songs but they had preaching ever so often on the circuit Rider they paid him each year with a sack of pumpkins and a few things like that you know that the people would raised to give it and the old preacher came by and there he offered prayer for me as a little boy that my first trip to church at the year of about something a little over two years old the first Vision taken place well they had told around in the mountains there that this light came in so they tried to figured up some of them said it must have been the sunlight reflecting on a maror in the house but there was no maror in there and the sun wasn't up so it was too early at 5:00 and then all they just passed it by and when is about uh supposed to be near 3 years old now I have to be honest there's things here that I do not like to say and I wish I could bypass it and not have to say it but yet to tell the truth you must tell the truth if it's on yourself or your people be honest about it then it's always the same my father was a long way from being a religious person he was a typical Mountain boy that drank constantly all the time and he had gotten in some trouble in a fight and there had been two or three men almost killed as a fighting shooting and cutting one another with knives at a some kind of a party up in the mountains and dad had been one of the Ring leaders of this fight because it had had been a friend of his and got hurt and hit someone with a chair and had the man had a knife out and it was going to cut Dad's friend on the floor with this knife through his heart and dad took his part and it really must have been a terrible fight because they from all the way down to burksville many miles away they sent a sheriff up after Dad horback so the man was laying at the point of death might be some of his people listening in I'm going to call his name will yarberry was his name probably I think some of them is in California if his voice but he was a bully great powerful man killed his own boy with a fence rail so he he was a very powerful and wicked man and so there was a great knife fight between he and dad and my father almost killed a man so he had to run and leave Kentucky and come across the river to Indiana and um he had a brother that lived at the time in Louisville Kentucky was the assistant superintendent of the wood Mosaic sills in Kentucky in Louisville and so Dad come to find his older brother dad was the youngest of the boys of 17 children and so he came to find his older brother and while he was gone for almost a year he could not come back because the law was looking for him and then when we had heard from him by letter signed by another name but that he told Mother how it would be that she'd hear from him and then I remember one day the spring this little cabin was just behind the house and and during that time after there's N9 11 months difference between me and my next brother and he was still crawling and I had a big rock in my hand and I was trying to show him how hard I could throw this rock and the old mud where the spring had run out of the ground and made the muddy ground and I heard a bird and it was singing up in a tree and I looked up to that tree and the bird flew away and when it did a voice spoke to me I know you think I could not think and remember that but the Lord God who judge the earth and the heavens and all there is knows that I'm telling the truth that bird when it flew away a voice came from where the bird was in the tree like a wind caught in the bush and it said you'll live near a city called New Albany and I've lived from the time I was 3 years old until this time within 3 miles of new albony Indiana I went in and told my mother about it well she thought I was just dreaming or something later we moved to Indiana and father went to work for a man Mr Wan a rich man he owns the WAN distilleries and he owned a great shears his muled millionaire and the Louisville Colonels and and baseball and so forth and then we live near there and dad being a poor man yet he could not do without his drinking so he went to making whiskey in a in a Ste and then it worked a hardship on me because I was the oldest of the children I had to come and pack water to this still to keep those Carls cool while they were making the whiskey then he got to selling it and then then he got two or three of those Stills now that's the part I don't like to tell but it's the truth and I remember one day from the barn coming up to the house crying because out at the back of the place was a pond where they used to cut ice many of you remember when they used to cut ice and put it in sawdust that's way Mr won kept ice out there in the country and father was a a chauffer for him a private chauffer and when uh this Pond was full of fish and when they would go to cutting the ice and bring it in and put it in the sawdust and when the ice melted in the summertime as it went down it was kind of clean I suppose more like a lake ice and they could use it not to drink but to keep water cold put it around the buckets and their milk and so forth one day packing water from back out at this pump which was about a city block I was squalling to who wouldn't have it because I'd come from school and all the boys went out to the pond fishing I just love to fish and so they uh all got to go fishing but me and I had to pack water for this still of course M that had to be mom is probation and um uh it was such a hardship and I remember coming along there with a stump toe I had a corn cob wrapped under my toe to keep it Out of the Dust did you ever do that just put a corn cob under your toe like this and wrap a string around it it holds your toe right up like a turtle head almost you know sticking up you could track me everywhere I went with this Carn cob under my to stumpage you know didn't have any shoes to wear so we never wore shoes sometime half the winter if we did we it was just what we could pick up somebody would give us and clo to what somebody charity would give us and I stopped under this tree and I was sitting there just squalling it was in September because I wanted to go fishing I had to pack several tubs of water with little molasse buckets just about that high half a gallon because it's just a little lad of about seven years old and I plow him in a big tub and then go back and get a another two buckets and come back pump it that's the water we had and there's go to run off a batch of that corn whiskey that night these men with Daddy up at the house and I was crying and all at once I heard something making a noise like a whirlwind something like this now I hope it isn't too loud going just a noise like that well it was awful quite and I looked around and you know what a little Whirlwind I believe you call them little Cyclones in the fall of the year they pick up through the corn feel you know the leaves and so forth in the Autumn there the leaves had just begin turning and I was under a great white popular tree stood about halfway between the barn and the the house and I heard that noise and I looked around it just as quiet as it is in this room not a leaf blowing nowhere nothing and I thought where's that noise coming from well I thought must be away from here just a lad and it got louder and louder I picked up my little buckets and squalled a couple more times and started up the lane I was resting and I got just a few feet from that out from under the branches of this big tree and oh my it made a whirl sounding and I turned to look and about halfway up that tree was another Whirlwind caught in that tree just to going around and around moving those leaves well I thought nothing strange about that because it just in that time of year and the Autumn why those whirlwinds come little we call them whirl winds and they uh and they pick up dust you seen them on the desert like that same thing so I watched but it didn't leave off usually it's just a puff for a moment then it goes but it had already been in there 2 minutes or more well I started up the lane again and I turned to look at this again and when it did a human voice just as audible as mine is said don't you never drink smoke or defile your body in any way there will be a work for you to do when you get older white like this scared me to death you can imagine how a little fell felt I dropped those buckets and home I went just as hard as I could go scream in the top of my voice and there was copperheads in that country snakes and they're very poison mother thought coming alongside the garden I'd perhaps got my foot on a copper head and she ran to meet me and I jumped up in her arm screaming hugging her and kissing her and she said what's the matter did you get snake bit look me all over I said no mama there's a man in that tree down there and she said Oh Billy Billy come on and she said did you stop and go to sleep I said no ma'am there's a man in that tree and he told me not to drink and not to smoke drink whiskies and and things and I was packing water to a moonshine still right then and he said don't you never drink or defile your body in anyway that's immoral you know and my child Young Manhood with women and to my best I have never one time been guilty of such the Lord help me with those things and as they go along you'll find out so then don't drink or don't smoke or do not defile your body for there will be a work for you to do when you get older well I told that to Mama and she just laughed at me and I was just hysterically she called the doctor and the doctor said well he's just nervous that's all so she put me to bed and I never from that day to this ever passed by that tree again I was scared I'd go down the other side of the garden because I thought there was a man up in that tree and he was talking to me great deep voice that spoke and uh then sometime about a month after that I was playing Marvels out with my little brothers out in front yard and all at once I had a strange feeling come on me and I stopped and sat down the side of the tree and right up on the bank from the Ohio river and I look down towards Jeffersonville and I seen a bridge rise up and go across that of the river span the river and I seen 16 men I count them had dropped off of there and lost their lives on that bridge I run in real quick and told my mother and she thought I went to sleep but they kept it in mind and 22 years of man the municipal bridge now many of you cross when you cross there crossed the river at the same place and 16 men lost their life building that bridge across the river it's never failed to be perfectly true as you see it here in the auditorium it's been that way all the time now they thought I was just a nervous which I am a nervous person that's true and if you ever notice people who are are inclined to be spiritual are nervous look at poets and Prophets and look at William kapper who wrote that famous song There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins did you ever you know this song I stood by his grave not long ago brother Julius I believe I know yes that's right was with us over there and his grave and and there after he had wrote that song the inspiration left him he tried to find a uh the river to commit suicide see the spirit left him and people like uh uh poets and authors and or not I mean prophets look at Elijah when he stood on the mountain and called fire out of the heaven and called rain out of heaven then when the spirit left him he run at a threat of a woman and God found him pulled back in a cave 40 Days Later look at Jonah with enough inspiration when the Lord had anointed him to preach there in Nineveh till a a city with the size of St Louis repented with sackcloth and then when the spirit left him what happened to him we find him up on the mountain n the spirit left him praying to God to take his life and see it's inspiration and when these things happen it it does something to you then I remember coming on up I got to be a young man I'll hurry to make it within the next little bit when I got to be a young man I had ideas like all young men I going to school I found I'm little girls you know I was real bashful you know and I I finally got me a little girlfriend and U like all little boys about 15 years old I guess and and so uh oh she was pretty my she had eyes like a dove and she had teeth like Pearl and neck like a swan and she she was really pretty and another little boy he uh we were buddies so he got his daddy's old Model T Ford and we got a date with our girls and we was going to take them out riding we got enough to buy two gallons of gasoline we had to Jack the back wheel up to crank it I don't know where you ever remember that or not you know to crank it but we we going along pretty good and so I had a few nickels in my pocket and we stopped at a little place and got you could get a ham sandwich for nickel and so oh I was rich I could buy four of them see and after we'd eat the sandwiches and drink the coke I started taking the bottles back and to my surprise when I come out women had just start falling falling from Grace at that time for or from Womanhood my little Dove was smoking a cigarette well I've always had my opinion of a woman that would smoke a cigarette and I haven't changed it one bit from that time on that's right it's a lowest thing she can do that's exactly right and I I now the cigarette company could get after me for this but I'm telling you that's just a stunt of the devil it's the biggest killer in sabotage this nation's got I'd rather my boy be a drunkard than to be a cigarette smoker that's the truth I'd rather see my wife laying on the floor drunk than to see her with a cigarette that's how now this spirit of God that's with me if that is the spirit of God as you might question you smoking cigarettes has got a slim chance when you get there because that just every time you notice on the platform how he condemns it it's a horrible thing keep away from it ladies if you have been guilty of that please in the Name of Christ get away from it it breaks you it'll kill you it it's a it's a cancer by the car loads a doctors try to warn you and then how they can sell you that stuff if you go down to the drugstore and say buy I want to buy 50 cents worth of cancer why they come lock them up but when you buy 50 cents worth of cigarettes you're buying the same thing doctors say so oh this money mad Nation it's too bad it's a killer it's been proved well when I seen that pretty little girl just acting smart this cigarette in her uh hand that like to kill me cuz I really thought I loved her and I thought well I'm called a woman hater you know that because I'm always kind of against women but not against you sisters I'm just against the way modern women act that's right good women should be packed long but I can remember when my father's still up there running I'd had to be out there with water and stuff I see young ladies that wasn't over 17 18 years old up there with man my age now drunk and they' have to sober him up and give them black coffee to get home to cook their husband's supper or something like that I said I this was my remark then they're not worth a good clean bullet to kill him with it that's right and I hated women that's right and I just have to watch every move now to keep them still thinking the same thing so but now a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown she should be honored she's my mother's a woman my wife is and they're lovely and I've got thousands of Christian sisters who I highly respect but if if they can respect what God made them a motherhood and a real queen that's all right she's one of the best things that God could give a man was a wife besides salvation a wife is the best thing if she is a good wife but if she isn't Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown but a a honory one or no good one is water in his blood and that's that's the worst thing could happen so a good woman if you've got a good wife brother you ought to respect her with the highest that's right you should do that a real woman and children if you've got a real mother mother that stays home and tries to take care of you keeping your clothes clean send you to school teaching you about Jesus you should honor that sweet old mother with all that's in you you should respect that woman yes sir because she's a real mother they talk about the illiteracy of Kentucky mountains you see it this your dog patch Stu some of them old mammies out there could come here to Hollywood and teach you modern mothers how to raise your kids you let her kid come in one night with her hair all messed up and lips slips what do you call it makeup stuff they put on their face and her dress all squeezed to one side and been out all night drunk brother she'd get one of the limbs off the top of that hickory tree and she' never go out no more I'm tell she if you had a little more of that You' have a better Hollywood around here and a better Nation that's right it's true just try to be modern that's one of the tricks of the devil now this little girl when I looked at her my heart just bled I thought poor little fell and she said oh you want a cigarette Billy I said no ma'am I said I don't smoke she said now you said you didn't dance they want to go to a dance I wouldn't do it so I said there's a dance down there what they called Sycamore Gardens and I said no I don't dance she said now you don't dance you don't smoke you don't drink how do you have any fun I said well I like to fish I like the hunt that didn't interest her so she said take this cigarette now I said no ma'am thank you I don't smoke and um I standing on the fender they had a running board on the Old Forge you remember I standing on that Fender sitting in the back seat she and I and she said you mean you won't smoke a cigarette said and we girls has got more nerve than you had I said no ma'am don't believe I want to do it she saidwell you big oh my I wanted to be big bad Bill so I I sure didn't want nothing said I want to be a prize fighter that was my idea of life so um I said I couldn't stand that so I said give it to me I hand I said I sure where I'm or not got that cigarette out and started to strike the match now I know you're now I'm not responsible for what you think I'm just responsible for telling the truth when I start to strike that cigarette just as much determined to smoke it as I am to pick up this Bible he I heard something going I tried again I couldn't get to my mouth I got to cry and I throw the thing down they got to laughing at me and I walked home went up through the fields sat down out there crying and and it was a terrible life remember one day dad was going down the river the boys my brother and I we had to take a boat and go up and down the river hunting bottles to put the whiskey in we got a nickel a dozen for him to pick him up along the river and dad was with me and he had one of these little flat I believe about a half pint bottles and there's a tree had blowed down and dad this man was with him Mr darn Bush I had his he had a nice boat and I wanted to find favor with him because wanted to use that boat it had a good Rudder and mine didn't have no Rudder at all we had this old boards to paddle with and if he'd let me use that boat so he done welding and he made the steels for Dad so uh he they throw their leg up across that tree and Dad reached in his back pocket and pulled out a little flat bottle of whiskey hand it to him he took a drink hand it back to Dad and he taking a drink he set it down on a little sucker on the side of the tree that went out and Mr darn Bush picked it up said here you are Billy I said thank you I don't drink he said a Brandon and don't drink everyone died with their boots on and he said uh brandom and don't drink I said no sir oh Dad said I raised one my daddy calling me a I said hand me that bottle I pull that stopper out the top of it determined to drink it when I started turn it up I hand the bottle back and Tuck off down through the field as hard as I could crying something wouldn't let me do it see I could not say well I was any good I was determined to do it but it's God grace Amazing Grace that kept me from doing those things I wanted to do them myself but he just wouldn't let me do it later on I found a girl when I was about 22 years old she was a darling she was a girl that went to church German Lutheran her name was brag b r u m b a CA come from the name of Bram ball and she was a nice girl she didn't smoke or drink or or she didn't uh dance or anything a nice girl I went with her for a little while and i' then about 22 I'd made enough money to I bought me an old Ford and uh I we'd go out on dates together and so that time there was no Lutheran Church close that moved from Howard Park up there and so there was a minister the one that AR me in the missionary Baptist Church Dr Roy Davis sister Upshaw the very one that sent the brother Upshaw over to me or talk to him about me Dr Roy Davis and um so he was preaching had the First Baptist Church or the U the uh I don't believe it was the First Baptist Church either it was a Miss called the Missionary Baptist Church at Jeffersonville and he was preaching at the place at that time and we would go to church at night so and we'd come back and I never did join church but I just like to go with her because the main thought was going with her I just might as well be honest so then uh going with her and one day I she is out of a nice family and I begin to think you know you know I ought to take that girl's time it isn't it isn't right because she's a nice girl and I'm poor and and I my daddy broke down in health and I I there was no way for me to make a living for girl like that who had been used to a nice home and rugs on the floor I remember the first rug I ever seen I didn't know what it was I walked around the side I thought it's the prettiest thing I ever seen in my life how would they put something like that on the floor it was the first rug I'd ever seen it was this one of these I believe it's called matting rugs I may have had that wrong some kind like wicker or something is laced together and laying on the floor pretty green and red big rows worked in the middle of it you know it was a pretty thing and so um I remember uh I made up my mind that I either had to ask her to marry me or I must get away and let some good man marry her somebody that would be good to her could make her a living and could be kind to her I could be kind to her but I I I was only making 20 cents an hour so I couldn't make too much of a living far and I with all the family we had to take care of and dad broke down in health and I had to take care of all them so I was having a a pretty rough time so I thought well only thing for me to do is tell her that I I she I I just won't be back because I thought too much of her to Wreck her life and to let her fool along with me and then I thought if somebody could get a hold of her and marry her make a lovely home and maybe if I couldn't have her I could I could know that she was happy and so I thought but I I just I just can't give her up and I I was in an awful shape and day after day I'd think about it so I was too bashful to ask her to marry me every night I make up my mind I'm going to ask her and what is that butterflies or something get in your all you Brethren out there probably had the same experience along that and a real funny feeling my face would get hot uh I didn't know I couldn't ask her so I guess you wonder how I ever got married you know what I wrote her a letter and asked her and so uh now it wasn't Dear Miss it was a little more you know on the love side than that it was just not a an agreement it was I I wrote it up best I could and I was a little afraid of her mother her mother was she was kind of rough and uh but her father was a gentle old Dutchman just a fine old fell he was the organizer of the Brotherhood of the traan on the railroad making about $500 a month and damn times and me making 20 cents an hour to Mary's daughter I know that would never work and her mother was very she's a nice lady and she uh she was kind of one of these high societies you know and prissy like you know and so she didn't have much use for me anyhow I was just an old plain SAS for ass country boy and she thought hope ought to go with a little better class of boy and I I think she was right and so um but I I didn't think it then so I thought well I don't know how I can't ask your daddy and I'm sure I'm not going to ask your mother and so I've got to ask her first so I wrote me a letter that morning on the road to work I dropped it in the mailbox the mail we going to church Wednesday night and that's on Monday morning I tried all day Sunday to tell her that I wanted to get married and I just couldn't get up enough nerve so then I dropped it in the mailbox and all it worked that day I happened to think what if her mother got a hold of that letter oh my then I know I was ruined if if she ever got a hold of it cuz she didn't care too much about me well I was just sweating it out and that Wednesday night when I come oh my I thought how am I going to go up there if her mother got a hold of that letter she'll really work me over so I hope she got it I dressed it to hope that was her name hope and so I said I'll just ride out here to Hope and so and I thought maybe she might have not have got a hold of of it so I know better to stop outside and blow the horn for her to come out oh my and any boy that hasn't got nerve enough to walk up to the house and knock on the door and ask for the girl ain't got no business being out with her anyhow just exactly right that's so silly that's cheap and so I stopped my old forge you know and I had it all shined up and so I went up knocked at the door mercy your mother come the door I couldn't hardly catch but I said how do you do Miss BR she said how do you do William William and uh and she said will you step in I said thank you I stepped inside the door I said is uh uh hope just about ready and just then here come hope skipping through the house just a girl at 16 and uh she said hi Billy I said hi hope I said you about ready for church said just in a minute I thought oh my she never got it she never got it good good good hope never got it either so it'll be all right cuz she'd have named it to me so I felt pretty fair and then when I got out church I happen to think what if she did get it see I couldn't hear what Dr Davis was saying I look over at her and I thought if maybe she's just holding it back and she's really going to tell me off when I get out of here for asking her that and I couldn't hear what Brother Davis was saying uh and I look over at her and I thought I hate to give her up but and I The Showdown sure to come so after church we started walking down the street together going home and and um so we walk to the old Ford and it's all along the Moon is shining bright soon I look over and she's pretty boy I look at her I thought my how I would like to have her but guess I can't and so I walked on a little further you know and I look up at her again I said H how you feeling tonight she said oh I'm all right and we stopped the old fort down we start to get out snow around sidewalk around the corner go to her house and I was walking up to the door with her I thought you know she probably um never got the letter so I just might as well forget it I'll have another week of Grace anyhow so I got feeling pretty good she said uh Billy I said yeah she said uh I got your letter oh my I said you did she said uh-huh but she just kept walking up we never said another word I thought woman tell me something run me away or tell me what you think about I said um did you uh did you read it she said uh-huh M you know how a woman can keep in suspense oh I I didn't mean it it's that way you see see but anyhow you know I I thought why don't you say something see I kept going on I said did you read it all uhhuh so he's almost to the door and I thought boy don't get me on the porch cuz I might not be able to outrun them so you tell me now and so I kept waiting and um she said Billy I would love to do that she said I love you God bless her soul now she's in glory she said I love you said I think we ought to tell our par the parents about it don't you think so and I said honey listen let's start this out with a 5050 proposition I said I'll tell your daddy if you'll tell your [Laughter] mother rooting the worst part off on her to begin with she said all right if you'll tell Daddy first I said all right I'll tell him Sunday night and so Sunday night come I brought her home from church and I she kept looking at me and I look it's 9:30 it's time for me to get going so Charlie was sitting at his desk typing away and Miss Brown back sitting over the corner doing some kind of crocheting you know or them little hooks she put over the things you know I don't know what you call it and so she was doing some of that kind of stuff and hope kept looking at me she frown at me you know motion to her daddy and oh my I thought what if he says no so I started out through the door I said well I guess I better go and I walked to the door and and uh she started door the door with me she'd always come to the door and tell me good night so I start the door and she said aren't you going to kill him and I said I said I'm sure trying to but I I I don't know why I'm going to go to do it and she said I'll just go back and you call him out so she walked back and left me standing there and I said um Charlie you turned around said yeah Bill I said

said yes if you're still willing I'm willing to and this coming July will be 45 five years ago so appreciate when God gives you a good person to be with it's a blessing amen I I just want to share one more thing with you brother Brandon was talking about that voice that spoke to him don't you ever smoke or drink telling this to my wife last night I don't know if it's the first time I ever shared with her around Junior High 7th e8th grade I thought those that smoked were the word back then was cool they look cool and so there was a little I don't even know if my parents know this it might be the first time they hear it too there was a little place in the back by where behind where we liveed was a Lemon Grove and it was a little Factory out behind that and the guys used to throw their mostly smoked cigarettes and I used to go pick them up and light them and walk around with them but never smoked them cuz I thought it was cool one day in ninth grade walking we we lived close enough that we had to walked to school didn't get the bus I found a whole pack of cigarettes and I thought my sign I hit a gold mine I'm going to hide it under this bush and on the way home I'm going to pick it up and I did on the way home and I had it in my hands and I just said what do you want these for and I put it on the ground and I crushed them with my foot and never touched him [Applause] again I didn't know that later in life where we would be but I'm grateful for God that would have enough care enough to say no that's not for you appreciate that so this evening we'll listen to the second half the second half is a lot you hear where brother brand has a hard time speaking of what he went through but you know this world's not my home this isn't where we make our career this isn't what we strive for but to get to the other side let's stand oh Lord you know I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do the Angels beckon me from Heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this worldmore this world is not my home I'm just a passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue the Angels be in me from Heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore oh Lord you know I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home then Lord what will I do the Angels beckon me from Heavens open and I can't feel at home in this world [Music] anymore so this afterno afternoon this afternoon service we'll hear the second part service starts at 5: if if you'll come and hear and and don't how could I say it don't feel sorry for brother B it's what God will take a man a woman through certain things in their lives some of you who maybe haven't struggled so hard maybe you're better than the rest of us I don't know but God knows
