Jonathan if we could just hear that when we cross over it it would mean just we could say well Lord my life was worth living um I announced I think it was last Wednesday that to uh think about these first books of the Bible that we've gone through from Genesis all the way now and we're starting in the Chronicles and when we F finish 2 Chronicles I'd like to answer some questions if you have any questions about anything from as long as it's start in Genesis and and goes through 2 Chronicles and you'll see today that 2 Chronicles covers a whole lot of ground actually over 3,000 years of ground so if you have any questions about any of the sermons that brother Lyle and I have brought forth um write them down and give them to to us and we'll have a questions and answers session on the Bible I mentioned last time I said just not like any doctrinal questions I didn't mean I mean the whole Bible's doctrinal I I shouldn't have said that what I meant was let's not talk about um the things like the seven Thunders and the Seven Seals been revealed and all that let's let's just keep it to what we've gone through in the first part of our Bible study clear I'm I'm looking forward to that actually I think I've got brother ly got some good ones for you so so uh let's make sure that we have we have some questions um I'm looking I'm going to look forward to that service I think it'll be a lot of fun um so now we are in this book of First Chronicles and you can kind of get an understanding of the book just by the title The the book of Chronicles now the original when it was written it was written in one book but it was really long so they split it into first and second chronicles the the book of Chronicles it's like a it's like a a newspaper or it's it's something that has set things in order and and brought forth a history and that's where the book uh gets its name and you'll see why it's named that it's very very aptly named in um the book of Chronicles um there are writing styles that you can see throughout the whole Bible you can see in from Genesis through Deuteronomy you can see a very very distinct writing style from the prophet Moses and that goes on and you'll see here in 1 Chronicles it also has a very very distinct style now it doesn't say who the author is but this author was you can tell he's a very educated person he was It was obviously written by a historian as you're going to see and this this man had really a Divine interpretation of the word and it's it's something that isn't really present in 1 and 2 Samuel this author most Scholars think it was Ezra The Scribe and Ezra we're not to Ezra yet but Ezra is the man who led the rebuilding of the walls around Jerusalem and rebuilding of of the the temple area there he was a scribe and he was a priest and he was a a just a great leader and it's written also after the return of the Babylonian exile so you know what the Babylonian exile is we're not there yet but that's when Nebuchadnezzar comes in so we have we have if you remember what we've gone through we have now we have two different countries we have Israel in the north we have Judah in the South Israel in the north is is invaded by the syrians they're dispersed all over the place that was pretty much the end of of that country's Rule and then you go down to the South and Judah lasted like I think it was 400 years longer than Israel did and Judah in turn later on Nebuchadnezzar came in from Babylon he attacked and conquered Judah took all of the the most prosperous and the most promising young people out brought them back home to Babylon and that is called the Captivity or the Exile this book was written after that so so that goes on and then the uh the king then the the Persians invade um Babylon Nebuchadnezzar's family they out and this King Cyrus allows the um Jews to go back home and that's where zerubabel and Nehemiah and Ezra and all of them them come into play and this it's it's just a it's a wonderful story this book was written after they go back home to Jerusalem we know that because the genealogies the um the first nine chapters of First Chronicles are genealogies and they cover about 3,000 years and then chapters 10 through 29 10 through the end they cover about 30 years and that is just about King David and you'll see the author when he's talking about David he leaves out most of the negative things most most of the negative stories about David he leaves out Saul chasing David all all around the Wilderness he leaves out the adulterous Affair that David has with basba he leaves out David killing Uriah and he leaves out the story of absolum and his Rebellion all of that is left out and it's just replaced with almost primarily the good stuff about David and it's WR like that for a reason shows that David's a man after God's Own Heart and 1 Chronicles really brings that out and it's very important that something that's present in 1 Chronicles when we get to the end that's not present in 2 Samuel is David calls for Solomon and gives him directions on how to build the first temple and these directions are amazingly in depth and precise so we'll we'll get to that here coming so again I'm going to go through 3,000 years of history with Ezra's genealogy and there's when we start with 1 First Chronicles I think it's Ezra that's I'm going to assume it's Ezra there's no introduction there's no claim of authorship it just goes right into the genealogy so let's turn to uh 1 Chronicles chapter 1 and watch how this begins 1 Chronicles chapter 1 Adam Seth enosh now the first born to Adam so we're starting right at the beginning here we're starting right at right at Adam and Eve the firstborn son here remember is Cain but notice that Cain is not listed in anywhere in the lineage of Adam anywhere in the bible really and it's not listed because he didn't have children oh and then and then it goes from Adam you have Adam and um Abel and Abel's not listen in the genealogy because Abel didn't have any children before he was murdered by Cain so the lineage comes through Seth so let's go brother Jeremy I'm sorry I'm going to take you back to Genesis chapter 5 and then I promise after that we'll stay in 1 Chronicles but I want to I want to show how 1 Chronicles and Genesis chapter 5 how how they mirror each other it says here Genesis 51 it says this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created and Adam lived 130 years and begat a son in his own likeness and after his image and called his name Seth image and likeness are pretty definitive that this child is from Adam it doesn't say that about Cain and in the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were 800 years and he begat Sons and Daughters all the days that Adam lived were 930 years and he died and Seth lived 105 years and begat enus we can go back to uh 1 Chronicles chapter 1 so the narrative from the author Moses goes on in that genealogy it goes on to Abraham in the Book of Genesis and then pass that and then back to it goes through Abraham and then Abraham we got Isaac and Isaac Jacob and then the 12 Patriarchs so that is what is going to be explained here in 1 Chronicles in great depth we're not going to read it all I promise so verse two let's just get a feeling of how this book starts Kenan Mahalo Jared hoch Methuselah lamech Noah Shem ham and japeth now instead of just Noah the Arthur records his three sons and he Chronicles these three sons of Noah now this isn't in the Book of Genesis here in 1 Chronicles he is going to tell us where that all of these sons of Noah ended up and their lineage the sons of japeth Goomer and Magog and midi and DAV and tubal and mesik and Tyrus and the sons of goer ainaz and Rath and toar and toara and the sons of Javin Elisha and Tarsus and kidum and dodanim the sons of ham Kush and misam and put and Canan the sons of kush siba and havala and sabta and Rama and SAA and the sons of Rama Sheba and danan and Kush begat Nimrod and he began to be Mighty on the earth now this man Nimrod he is usually credited he's from the lineage of ham and he's usually credited with building the Tower of Babel and the Bible doesn't directly say that he built it but he was the leader of that time and most theologians think that that was in fact Nimrod that built that now let's skip to verse 17 I'm laying a foundation here the sons of Shem Elum and Asher and arfad and ludd and Aram and O and hul and gether and meach let's skip to verse 26 serg nahor terara Abram the same as Abraham the sons of Abraham Isaac and ishmail now the author goes through the generations not just of Isaac but of also of ishmail who was born from Sarah's slave and also he also goes through the children born to coutura the woman that Abraham married after Sarah died so in Chronicles coutura is not basically he's not she's not listed as his wife she's listed as his concubine we skip to verse 40 34 and then we'll follow the line of Abraham and Sarah and Abraham begat Isaac the sons of Isaac Esau and Israel again another lineage that's not mentioned very much and that's the lineage of Esau usually we just go to Isaac and Jacob but the sons of Isaac Esau and Israel and notice that the author lists Jacob's name his change name which is Israel and not Isaac remember he wrestled with the angel Angel and didn't and and he fought him all night and then the angel blessed him and changed his name to Israel it also list the as I said list the lineage of Esau which again is rare now I said that because it goes through all of these different genealogies all the way through chapter nine let's read um 1 Chronicles 9:1 so all Israel were reckoned by gen ologies and behold they were written in the book of kings of the Kings of Israel and Judah which we just went through who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression so why is it so important that this author would take all of that time and all of that space to record all of these genealogies and we might think well we might think more on a spirit spiritual sense but if you put yourself back in Israel back in Judah at this time imagine if you wanted to be a priest you would have to be able to prove that you're from the tribe of Levi so you have all of these different genealogies coming down so you would have to say well my dad is this my grandpa is this and then I am over here and and here is my great great grandpa right here in the lineage of Levi and it's written like that to be a useful tool for Israel for years to come all the way to this day and then also if you wanted to own land in Judah then you would need to prove your heritage remember the story of Boaz and Ruth and how he was a kinsman redeemer so you would use what but Ezra wrote here to prove that you were a rightful heir to this land or that you could buy land in this area and then probably the most important is the line of the Messiah and it comes through a certain line which do you know which line that is Judah Judah comes to the tribe of Judah the first words in the New Testament in Matthew they're a lineage from the tribe of Judah so these lineages are important and then when when so Matthew goes from Abraham all the way to Joseph Mary's husband and he may have used some of these lineages in his in Matthew's research so imagine if these these genealogies weren't recorded obviously as I said I'm not going to go through them because it's just its name after name after name and after name but you might think of what significance are these and I it's it's of tremendous value and tremendous significance so this book of 1 Chronicles is kind of like a law book it's meant to be a reference quoted before by not only the priests but also the judges and and really in everyday life so it had to be perfectly accurate written by probably the greatest scribe that had ever lived and it's also important and and whether Ezra knew it or not he was inspired by God for this lineage of Jesus Christ so the author starts with Adam he goes through Noah and Abraham and Jacob he calls Israel all the 12 Patriarchs and their their lineage and all the way down through past the Babylonian captivity so that is our first nine chapters of First Chronicles there's no one sitting on the edge of their seat right now it's awesome though it really is good and it ties in a lot of things and you can look at the different names it's like oh well that name doesn't match and and you re you research these different things and it's like oh enosh oh that's Enoch or um sheth oh that's Seth so then we get to 1 Chronicles 10 and I'm not saying it's more exciting now but it's it is more exciting now maybe not as useful but more more very very much more exciting so we see the end of King Saul in 1 Chronicles 10 and we see the beginning now of King David and it tells the same story as the end of 1 Samuel where Saul Falls kills himself he falls on his own Sword and the Philistines desecrate his body and then some Valiant men they bravely go and they recover the bodies of Saul and his sons and they bring them back and bury them but watch this the writer and you can see how this writer is a gifted man of God and there's little things like this that are in 1 Chronicles that aren't necessarily present in the other books 1 Chronicles 10: 13 watch how this author interprets what happened it's a very simple statement but he says this so Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the Lord even against the word of the Lord which he kept not and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar Spirit to inquire of it and inquired not of the Lord therefore he slew him and turn the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse now you won't won't hear anything said like that about this King David and the reason is because this author whether he was knew it or whether it was just the Holy Spirit on him knew that this Messiah coming was going to be of the tribe of Judah was going to be the son of David and that comes right down through here with this book of Chronicles and the more prevalent theme is not that David ever made mistakes or David did anything wrong the more prevalent theme in this book of First Chronicles is that if you are on David's side then you're on God's side go to chapter 11 and it reads like this chapter 11 verse one then all Israel gathered themselves unto to David unto Hein saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh so before we go any further does everybody understand now it's Bible study does everybody understand that this book of First Chronicles and 2 Chronicles is covers about the same information as 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and second Kings all right so it's not it's it repeats a lot of the stories but it's it's almost a shame sometime that it comes after 1 and 2 Samuel 1 and second Second Kings because really this Chronicles is just absolutely incredible and people will read it's like oh I've already read this and then they might go on to the next book but it shouldn't be that way there's a whole lot this is rich rich book then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hein saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh look at the love and the unity the people had with David the king and moreover in time passed even when Saul was King thou was he that lest out and broughtest in Israel NIV translation said that they LED Israel that David LED Israel on their military campaigns and the Lord thy God said unto thee Thou shalt Feed My People Israel so this is the people talking to David Thou shalt Feed My People Israel and thou shalt be a ruler Over My People Israel therefore came all the Elders of Israel under to the king in Hein and David made a covenant with them in Hein before the Lord and they anointed David King over Israel according to the word of the Lord by Samuel and David and all Israel went to Jerusalem which is jabus there the jebusites were the inhabitants of the land so they went to Jerusalem and and the inhabitants of jabus said to David Thou shalt not come hither nevertheless David took the castle of Zion which is the city of David as brother Lyall pointed out last week that the city of David is just outside of Jerusalem they're right there next to each other so David conquered this city Jerusalem and the author of This Book 1 Chronicles tells us about and remember it's all about names here it's a reference book so the author tells us about these there's about 37 or so men that he describes as David's Mighty Men now there's three 1 Chronicles lists two 2 Samuel lists another one so we'll say that there are three these three were as the book says the mightiest of the mighties now there was one of these men that he went to battle against the Philistines and second and 1 Samuel says that that he killed 800 men he was the chief among the Mighty Men because he commanded a troop of 24,000 soldiers and then there was another of the three this mighty man stood for David when the Philistines tried to take a field and so he's there and the Philistines come and they invade the land and all the Israelites they all run away because remember the pH Philistines these big guys you know like Goliath these all the Israelites they run away so one of David's Mighty Men he stands up I believe his name is elaser and he stands he walks out into the middle of the field and he stands there and he pulls out his sword all of his army had run away and he says bring it on and he stands there with his sword and here comes all these Philistines and he just starts laying them down with this sword one after the other after they killing them until he got tired of swinging and his hand was cleaving to a sword and it was just one after the other and they're all dying and then all the Israelites they look and they're like oh wow the Philistines are all dead let's go back so so they go back and they start taking the spoil like taking all their gold and stuff all the dead people so that's the other mighty man so the third mighty man I believe his name is shama he does the same thing so there's this this field of lentils and here come the philis and he does the same thing he walks out there Israelites run away and he says bring it on and he does the same thing that Eleazar does just starts whacking and killing and and destroys all of the Philistines these Great Men great warriors of the Lord with David three his three most Mighty Men so these men David is out and he's losing not losing the battles but he's been he's up in the rocks and he's in this Cave of ailum the Philistines had invaded and the Philistines were winning and they had taken David's Hometown where he was born does anyone know where he was born he's this remember Jesus is the son of David Bethlehem so David's in this cave in ailum and he's just down I mean life is just not good for David and his men in the country and and David's hot and he probably I don't know there miles away he starts thinking of his upbringing and he starts thinking he's thirsty he starts thinking I would love to have a drink from this well that was by the gate of Bethlehem I used to go there when I was a kid and and drop the water and it was always so cold and just tasted so good and and he says I would just I just long to have a drink of that water well there was a Garrison of Philistines that had taken over Bethlehem and they were in charge of that there was no way that David could even go down there because he would have lost the battle so these three mighty men that I just mentioned they heard David say that I said all right now look at the Loyalty look at the love and look at The Bravery that these men had look at how the the unity of the people was so they hear David say that they say okay we'll do it so they sneak away from David David has no idea they they go down off the mountain they start battling the Philistines one after the other and they're fighting their way all the way to Bethlehem they get to that well that David mentioned at Bethlehem two probably stood guard fighting off the goliaths and everything else that was coming in thinking about how much they love their King draws up the bucket they take it and then they fight their way all the way back to to David and there's David still up in his cave still down and imagine how he felt they came before him they bring the bucket of water say King here's the water that you desired from your well where you were born David looks at that water and you saw that the men were probably bloody they had been fighting they had just battle they they put their whole lives in danger just to give this man David a drink and he said something on the order of he said you did that for me he said you spilled your own blood to just to get me a drink of water that I desired he said I'm not worthy of this look at the humility in David how much he wanted that but he he has this bucket he sees his buddies right here that risk their life they're bleeding they're tired and he takes it and he gives this water to the Lord doesn't even take a sip of it he pours it out on the ground for an offering to God I wonder if Jesus may have been thinking of that remember David this whole book of First Chronicles it is making David almost like a type of the Messiah because he's so great I wonder if Jesus may have been thinking of that story when he said this in Mark he said for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to Christ verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward think about how those men gave so much to give that to King David 1 Chronicles CH 12 the author continues to document the names to show um that all those who were loyal to David and how they were right in being loyal to the king I'll read it 1 1st Chronicles 12:17 and this is just typical of the book of 1 Chronicles and David went out to meet them and answered and said unto them if ye become peaceably unto me to Help Me Mine Heart shall be knit unto you but if you come out if you become come to betray me to my enemies seeing there is no wrong in mine hands the god of our fathers look thereon and rebuke it then the spirit Came Upon amsi who was was the chief of the captains and he said thine are we David and on thy side thy side thou son of Jesse peace peace be unto thee and peace be unto thy helpers for thine God help for thy God helpeth thee then David received them and made them captains of the band one thing to point out that the primary adversity the primary enemy in 1 Chronicles as you probably gathered by now is the Philistines and for the next few chapters we see David fight the battles which of of which most of these battles many of them are also recorded in 2 Samuel so let's go to chapter 15 so David brings the Ark of the Lord up to Jerusalem now remember instead of he makes a mistake here and it's also recorded in 1 Chronicles instead of the ark being carried with staves through the there were these Rings the Bible talks about them these rings that they put these long poles in and then the Levites would pick up the ark and carry these staves on their shoulders and they would walk they would bring the ark wherever it needed to go well David makes a mistake and that was commanded by the Lord so David makes a mistake and he puts this this arc on a cart which see seems like the easier way to go but it wasn't God's commandment so he puts this this cart in order and and it's going along and the ox stumbles and the man walking beside the ark puts his hand on on the ark to to help to keep it from falling and the man is immediately struck dead so David's fault because he did it wrong and a man lost his life so then in chapter so David finally brings the ark he does it right they puts it they put the staves in and they they bring the ark up up to Jerusalem and chapter 16 talks about bringing the ark into the City and David dancing in front of it and the worship leaders uh going and and very specific names and in instruments are being played in celebration of bringing the ark and David places The Ark in a tent now remember that in a few minutes I'm going to talk about that tent so in 16 so they set so they brought the Ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices I verse one brother Jeremy they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God now the next verses are very interesting because they me mention a very special person that I guarantee it every one of us probably in this room have read have read his name but you probably don't remember why you read his name or who he is and David made an end of offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings and he blessed the people in the name of the Lord and He dealt to every one of Israel both man and woman to everyone a loaf of bread and a good piece of FL flesh and a flagen of wine and he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the Ark of the Lord and to record and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel so these are worship leaders these are great men and they are they are there just to worship Levites this next person is going to be familiar name if you read the book of Psalms this man's name is Asaf and it's probably he was probably one of these worship leaders and he's mentioned over and over in the Book of Psalms his sons are mentioned later on in the book of First Chronicles and he's even he's even mentioned in the book of Ezra now I got this as I was researching this I got this from um gotquestions.org which is a Bible website that I often read and I I check a lot of I I'll think that that I have it right but I'll check it on this website and and this website says this if we examine the Psalms written by Asaf we can see that all of them have to do with the Judgment of God and many involve the prayers of the people at the prospect or moment of a particular event Asaf was a was a gifted individual he understood where the gift came from and he used his music to praise the Lord and communicate his word to a needy World verse 5 Asaf the chief and next to him Zachariah jel and Shimmer moth and J J and matayah and eliab and bayah and Obed Edom and jail with sues and with Harps but Asaf made a sound with symbols I love I love I love the Bible it's it it may not seem like much but here's who this guy is it says a Psalm of Asaf and then you read it it's like oh there's a Psalm of Asaf who's Asaf well here he is he's this guy he played the symbols I'm sure he played a lot of other stuff too but so we know who this man is and the book of Chronicles continues to Chronicle these names of these people so David chapter 17 David's in his house and remember I talked about the tent that the Ark of the Covenant was put in this tent David's in his house and he looks down and he sees this big beautiful home that he's in and he looks down he sees this little tent where the Ark of the Covenant was being stored so he calls Nathan the prophet and he tells Nathan something that's on his heart 17 verse one and now it came to pass as David sat in his house that David said to Nathan the prophet lo I dwell in a house of Cedars but the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord remaineth under curtains then Nathan said unto David do all that is in thine heart for God is with thee so David tells Nathan the prophet I'm living in this big beautiful house but the ark where God's strength has been manifested is in a tent so what is David's motive here he obviously wants to build a big place to hold the ark but David's main motive now I've heard Scholars say I've Heard lots of people say that that Nathan initially said yeah do what's in your heart David go ahead and do it but then then the Lord spoke to Nathan that night which I'll read here in a minute and then he comes back and he says oh I was wrong Nathan or David don't do it you can't do it but the prophet said do what's in your heart so what was in what was really in David's heart what was in David's heart was to serve God was to have the perfect will of God he had an idea and he was obviously inspired by this idea and he wanted to do it right Nathan wanted to do things right so here you have two great men a prophet and a king prophet and they are wanting to be in God's Will and then God tells them how to do it remember David was a man after God's Own Heart so his greatest desire was to do what God wanted so friends if our heart is sincere and you like David are willing to take no for an answer then God will give you exactly what you want which is to be in his perfect will and we'll do best like David did to be in his will so and that's exactly what happens here so we'll read the rest of the chapter and uh watch the comparisons in the word that that God that the word makes between Solomon and the Lord Jesus uh verse three 173 it says this and it came to pass that same night that the word of God came to Nathan saying go and tell David my servant thus sayeth the Lord Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in for I have not dwelt in in a house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day but have gone from tent to tent and from t one Tabernacle to another don't you love how God will move from person to person from church to church and there's no church there's no denomination there's no group that has an exclusive right to God God's like right here he's like no no no listen I go where I want to go I go from person to person from church to church whosoever God's still speaking whosoever I have walked with all Israel whosoever I have walked with all Israel spake i a word to any of the judges of Israel when I commanded to Feed My People saying what have you not why have you not built me a house of Cedars like I've never said to them why have you not build me a house now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David th thus sayith the Lord of hosts I took thee from the Sheep coat even from following the sheep that thou should us be a ruler Over My People Israel and I have been with thee wheresoever thou Hast walked and I have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and I have made thee a name like the name of of the great men that are in the earth also I will ordain a place for My People Israel and will plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more neither neither shall the children of wickedness waste them anymore as at the beginning and since the time that I commanded the judges to be over My People Israel moreover I will subdue all thine enemies furthermore I tell thee that the Lord will build thee a house I think the Lord is making it clear here that David I did all of these things you didn't do nothing I am the one from the beginning beginning that has done it all and it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers that I will raise up thy seed after thee which shall be of thy sons and I will establish his kingdom now as brother Lyall has pointed out a few times when he has ministered on these sons does not necessarily mean your immediate Offspring it can be in your lineage and he shall build me a house now he's going to be typing remember the scriptures often have a two-fold meaning and he shall build me a house and I will establish his throne forever look at the type here Solomon will build a temple but his throne wasn't established forever I will be his father and he shall be my son for God gave for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son his only begotten son and I will not take my Mercy away from him as I took it from him that was before thee but I will settle him in mine house and my kingdom forever and his throne shall be established forever more who's God talking about here he's talking about Solomon but he's also talking about the great son of David that was to come according to all these words and according to all this Vision did Nathan speak unto David it is all about Christ this entire book every word 66 books is about one man every word in the Bible lifts up that one man it's all about him it's all about Jesus so in chapter 18 David goes back to battle with the Philistines so let's skip and and it's recorded and we've gone through these in in 1 and 2 Samuel and let's go to 1st Chronicles chapter 22 now remember Nathan the prophet told David to do all that is in thine heart for God is with you David had a desire to build this Temple and God told him that his son would do it but Watch What Happens here in 22 chapter 22:5 and David said Solomon my son is Young and tender and the house that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifical I like that name that word I like King James sometimes that's just great exceeding magnifical of Fame and of Glory throughout all the countries I will therefore now make preparation for it so David prepared abundantly before his death then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the Lord God of Israel and David said to Solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God but the word of the Lord came to me saying thou Hast shed blood abundantly and has made great Wars Thou shalt not build a house unto my name because thou has shed much blood upon the Earth in my sight Behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and I will give him rest from all his enemies roundabout for his name shall be Solomon and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days he shall build a house for my name and he shall be my son and I will be his father and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom over Israel forever now my son the Lord be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the Lord thy God as he hath said of thee only give only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee charge concerning Israel that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord thy God then shalt thou Prosper if thou takest heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the Lord charged charged Moses concerning Israel be strong and be of good courage and Dread not neither be dismayed so then David goes on with his instruction for the building of the temple it's called Solomon's Temple but really it was all David's inspiration it was David's plan it was every David got everything from the Lord he just didn't put it together it was Solomon's job to put it together verse 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God Arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and and and the holy vessels of God into the house that God built to the name of the Lord so then in the in the subsequent chapters the following chapters David sets up the priesthood in chapter 25 he talks about the musicians and the singers again in great detail chapter 28 he has this public meeting with the leadership to announce the plans just like I've been talking about the fellowship hall and and and redoing the um the sanctuary here and David in chapter 29 David takes up an offering to raise the money to build the temple and then Solomon is anointed king a second time let's um everything as I said is in great detail because this is going to be used for the ages to come and this record provided the priest and the leadership the leaders with a template on how to conduct Church order and many other things really this is like a conduct order and Doctrine um book this first Chronicles so we will uh bring the musicians up and we will close and let's read the last chapter of First Chronicles furthermore verse one furthermore David the king said un all the congregation Solomon my son whom alone God hath chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the Lord God now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold the silver for things of silver and the brass for things of brass and the iron for things of iron and the wood for things of wood the onx stones and and the stones beset GL glistering St stones and of divers colors and all manner of precious stones marble and stones in abundant and he goes on he talks about more of the details verse six then the chief of the fathers and the princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of the thousands of hundreds with the rulers of the king's work offered willingly and gave for the service of the house of God of of gold 5,000 Talons and 10,000 drams and of silver 10,000 talents and of brass 18,000 talant and 100,000 Talons of iron and they with whom the precious stones were found gave them to The Treasure of the house of the Lord by the hand of JAL the ganite then the people rejoiced for that they had offered willingly because the perfect because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord and David the king also rejoiced with great joy wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation and David said blessed be thou Lord God of Israel Our Father forever and ever thine O Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in heaven and and Earth is thine thine is the kingdom O Lord and thou art exalted as head above all both riches and honor come from thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it it is to make great and to give strength unto all but now therefore Our God we thank thee and praise thy glorious name amen but who am I and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sword for all things come from thee and of thine own hand and thine own have we given in thee so David is saying here that all the gifts that are coming from the congregation here to help build this Temple it all comes from God in the first place for we are strangers before thee and Souljers as as we're all of our fathers our days on the Earth are as a shadow and there is none abiding oh Lord Our God all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thine holy name name cometh of thy hand and is all thine own I know also my God that thou triest the heart and has pleasure in the upright in uprightness as for me in uprightness of my of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things and now I have seen with joy thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee look at the the joy that they had they're honored to be able to give they were honored to be able to to contribute to this there's other places that that I didn't mention that God provided and maybe it's maybe it's when Solomon's putting this together but God provided every skill that was needed to build that Temple and I think even now in our in our church I thank God that we have I look at brother Ed and all that he's doing and putting in so much time brother Ed what if we didn't have you but God provided brother Ed there someone who's willing to give his time he was out he's out doing the work himself and God here records in this chronic chrles these people that came forth that freely gave their skills to help oh Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel our fathers keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy Commandments thy testimonies and thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the the palace for the which I have made provision and David said to all the congregation now bless the Lord your God and all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshiped the Lord and the king the new King James says they bowed themselves before the Lord and the King and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord and offered burnt offerings unto the Lord on the tomorrow after that day even a thousand Bullocks and a thousand Rams and a thousand Lambs with their drink offering and sacrifices in abundance of Israel look at how honored they were to be able to give and did eat and drink before the Lord on the day with great G gladness and they made Solomon the son of David King the second time remember the first first time it was done in private just with David and Nathan and the priests and a couple people now they were anointing Solomon King in front of everyone and anointed him unto the Lord to be the chief governor and zadok to be the priest then Solomon sat on the throne of the of the Lord as King instead of David his father and prospered and all Israel obeyed him and all the princes and the Mighty Men and all the sons likewise of King David submitted themselves unto Solomon the king and the Lord magnified Solomon what a beautiful type I know David's a type of Solomon's also a beautiful type of the Lord Jesus as I said it's all about Jesus and the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of Israel and bestowed upon Him such a royal majestry as had not been on any King before him in Israel thus David the son of Jesse reigned over Israel Over All isra Israel and the time that he reigned over Israel was 40 years seven years reigned he in Hein and 30 years and 30 and3 years reigned he in Jerusalem and he died in a good old age full of days you remember how many years that was 70 years old David died and he died in a good old age full of days riches and in honor and Solomon his son reigned in his stead now the acts of David the king first and the last behold they are written in the book of Samuel the sear which we just went through and in the book of Nathan the prophet and in the book of GAD the sear with all his Reign and his might and the times that went over him and over Israel and over all the kingdoms of the countries and thus we have the close of the book of 1 Chronicles let's let's stand 1 Chronicles again it's a Chronicle we have genealogies which were very very important and then we have this King David that Chronicles very much focuses on because he is in the line of the coming Messiah I would like to be one of those mighty men that David had whatever David wanted they were willing to do it all the way to risking their lives brothers and sisters whatever the Lord Jesus wants from us let's be those Mighty Men and give it to him whatever he requires of Our Lives Jah brother Jordan Jesus [Music] all for [Music] Jesus all I am and

first bit of it and then 30 years in the second all the way to the end of King David he cut the the stones he cut the he had the logs cut he had the measurements made everything was put in order for this Temple to be built and I'm grateful that the Lord has provided our little church here with everything that we've needed we've got wonderful leadership in in the Petersons and and brother Aaron and brother Ed and we've got everything that we need now we've just got to spend the next couple months putting it together and uh all of us would appreciate everybody's patience as we're doing it and we're going to have a very very nice sanctuary and a nice Fellowship all when we finish I'm not trying to compare this place to Solomon's Temple David's Temple but I do see that I am grateful that the
