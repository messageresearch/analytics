[17:17] for me tonight God bless you thank
[17:20] you I'm excited to be here tonight amen
[17:23] I trust you are too this
[17:26] evening our topic is is the book of
[17:29] Isaiah as we continue our series on the
[17:33] books of the Bible you may already know
[17:35] this but Isaiah is one of the most
[17:38] controversial books of the entire Bible
[17:43] and and I need to warn you I'm probably
[17:46] going to be five or 10 minutes longer
[17:48] than I normally am there's a lot of
[17:50] material to compress down and uh so I
[17:56] could speak a lot faster we can get done
[17:57] on time but I don't think you follow
[17:58] everything's so very well so I'm going
[18:00] to go at my normal pace and we'll just
[18:02] take a little bit longer if that's okay
[18:05] we're fortunate tonight not only to have
[18:08] this book but the author of the book is
[18:12] here with us so let's ask for his
[18:15] guidance as we once again go to him in
[18:19] prayer Lord Jesus we are completely
[18:23] insufficient and inadequate in ourselves
[18:26] Lord we're not worthy to open the
[18:29] pages of this Bible but it's a love
[18:32] letter that you've sent to us Lord that
[18:36] we could know your will and Lord that we
[18:39] could follow after you Lord in spirit
[18:42] and in truth Lord we just pray Lord that
[18:46] your spirit would continue to be present
[18:48] tonight Lord I pray that Lord there's
[18:51] nothing I have to say that anyone needs
[18:55] to hear but Lord we're here to hear from
[18:57] you speak to our hearts each one Lord
[19:01] questions that there may be whatever it
[19:03] might be Lord have your will have your
[19:07] way amongst us tonight and Lord for
[19:09] these requests that have been spoken
[19:12] Lord Lord I just don't know what to say
[19:16] except Lord our sufficiency lies in you
[19:19] and we trust you for the outcome
[19:22] according to your perfect will in each
[19:24] one of these requests and we thank you
[19:28] and that
[19:29] precious mighty name of our Lord and
[19:33] Savior Jesus Christ
[19:39] amen see if we could get
[19:43] the there we are thank you Isaiah is the
[19:48] first of what we call the Major Prophets
[19:49] they're called major because of the
[19:51] volume or quantity of their writings
[19:54] Isaiah is such an all-encompassing book
[19:57] it's hard provide a synopsis in a
[20:00] sentence or two it's not possible to
[20:02] cover it in one night or or two or 10 so
[20:07] please read it at home alone or together
[20:11] with your family tonight we're just
[20:14] going to skem over some little brief
[20:16] portions just some tiny
[20:19] selections um some of the scriptures
[20:22] you're going to hear tonight you already
[20:24] heard on on the WhatsApp my opening
[20:26] scripture Our Pastor read this morning
[20:29] even though he didn't know it was going
[20:30] to be our opening scripture and a chunk
[20:32] of what I'm going to say not long after
[20:34] that he just read to you from here just
[20:37] a moment ago without knowing that that
[20:39] was what I was going to do so so I I'll
[20:42] accept that intrusion
[20:48] brother so I'd like to open with a very
[20:51] familiar passage from Isaiah a prophecy
[20:53] concerning the
[20:55] Messiah some of you may recognize
[20:58] recognize this as part one movement 12
[21:00] of handles
[21:02] Messiah For unto us a child is born unto
[21:07] us a son is given the government shall
[21:12] be upon his shoulder his name Shall be
[21:16] Called
[21:18] wonderful
[21:20] counselor the Mighty
[21:22] God the Everlasting
[21:25] father the Prince of Peace
[21:29] of the increase of his government in
[21:31] peace there shall be no end upon the
[21:34] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[21:36] order it and to establish it with
[21:39] Justice and judgment from henceforth
[21:42] even
[21:43] forever and how do we know it's going to
[21:45] happen the Zeal of the Lord of hosts
[21:49] will accomplish
[21:52] this then a few verses from chapter 40
[21:56] starting at verse 28 a response to
[21:59] Israel's complaint that Lord you're
[22:01] ignoring our plight you don't really see
[22:04] what's going
[22:05] on hast thou not known hast thou not
[22:09] heard the Everlasting God the Lord the
[22:13] creator of the
[22:14] heavens the creator of the ends of the
[22:17] Earth fainteth not neither is weary he
[22:21] doesn't get tired there's no searching
[22:24] of his understanding we we can't fathom
[22:27] it he he gives power to the faint to
[22:31] them that have no might he increases
[22:33] strength another translation reads he
[22:35] invigorates the
[22:37] exhausted he gives
[22:39] strength to the
[22:42] powerless but they that wait upon the
[22:46] Lord shall renew their strength they
[22:49] shall Mount up with wings as eagles they
[22:53] shall run and not be weary they shall
[22:57] walk
[22:59] and not faint if you're taking notes
[23:01] this ties in with Hebrews 12:
[23:05] 1-3 please be seated when you came in
[23:08] there was a small card or text for you
[23:10] with a short length of twine
[23:13] attached if you didn't get one when you
[23:15] came in please take one when you leave
[23:19] if raise your hand maybe someone will
[23:21] bring one to you I I don't know it has
[23:23] Isaiah 4031 printed on it and again a
[23:27] length of twine
[23:29] attached to
[23:33] it um and we already talked about the
[23:35] quiz so I'll skip that it's been a while
[23:38] since we met and discussed the structure
[23:41] of the Old Testament so let's just
[23:43] review for a
[23:45] moment this is how the Hebrew Bible
[23:48] called the Tanakh is structured Tanakh
[23:51] from the from Tor the N from neim the
[23:55] from Kim tanak Torah neim
[23:59] intervene the Torah means direction or
[24:04] instruction it begins with the story of
[24:06] creation and ends with the Deliverance
[24:09] of the Jewish Nation From Slavery the
[24:11] giving of the law and the end of the
[24:13] wandering in the desert these five books
[24:16] are also known as the pentet written by
[24:19] Moses the second division neim means
[24:23] prophets the events or Ministries
[24:25] contained in these books occurred at
[24:27] least in part
[24:29] and the land of promise Joshua and
[24:31] judges Samuel and kings are included in
[24:33] this
[24:34] section prophets there were prophets in
[24:38] the times of the judges Samuel was an
[24:39] important Prophet who transitioned
[24:41] Israel from a collection of towns to a
[24:44] nation with the centralized government
[24:45] and ultimately anointed David as their
[24:48] King many prophets are mentioned in
[24:50] Kings including Nathan Elijah
[24:53] Elisha these prophets left us no
[24:56] specific writings or Scrolls what we
[24:58] know of them and their words and
[25:01] Ministries are recorded here they're
[25:04] sometimes called the earlier prophets
[25:06] those which left nothing in
[25:09] writing the prophets which left writings
[25:12] are sometimes called the later prophets
[25:14] there are 15 of them contained in four
[25:17] books and the first of these is Isaiah
[25:20] our subject this
[25:22] evening the third division Kim is Hebrew
[25:25] word that means
[25:27] writings here here we find poetry wisdom
[25:30] history other books not part of the
[25:31] Torah or considered part of the prophets
[25:35] notably Lamentations written by a major
[25:38] Prophet Jeremiah is not included in the
[25:40] writings of the prophets and Daniel
[25:42] certainly a prophet is here and not
[25:44] included in the second section because
[25:47] his ministry was conducted entirely
[25:49] outside the land of Israel and after the
[25:52] destruction of
[25:55] Jerusalem here's the Old Testament as
[25:57] organized in our Christian Bible the
[26:00] same content as the tanak but ordered
[26:03] differently there are four major
[26:04] divisions in 39 books not 24 because
[26:09] Samuel Kings Chronicles Ezra Nehemiah
[26:12] are split into two books and the Minor
[26:14] Prophets one book on the Tanakh are
[26:17] broken out into 12 individual
[26:20] books not shown is the New Testament
[26:23] with 27 books for a total of 66
[26:26] books in our Christian Bible
[26:29] we've covered the law history and poetry
[26:31] sections earlier in this series tonight
[26:34] we start the last section
[26:37] prophets the last 17 books of our Old
[26:41] Testament about onethird of its length
[26:43] are the writings of these
[26:46] Prophets You may be asking
[26:49] yourself what is a
[26:52] prophet what did they do how did God use
[26:56] them in the Old Testament
[26:58] and who is Isaiah when did he live why
[27:02] is he called a
[27:05] prophet prophets were usually men there
[27:07] were women as well such as Deborah one
[27:10] of the judges we looked at a few months
[27:12] ago in holda whom we met in Second Kings
[27:14] and 2 Chronicles though again neither of
[27:17] them left us
[27:18] writings as mentioned a moment ago the
[27:21] sections we call law and history include
[27:23] prophets like Abraham Moses Samuel
[27:26] Elijah and holda
[27:29] the focus of the last section of our Old
[27:31] Testament the section that we call the
[27:33] prophets was on the nations of Israel
[27:36] and Judah after the kingdom was
[27:40] established God raised up prophets to
[27:44] rebuke to correct to redirect his people
[27:49] when they went
[27:50] astray so as no surprise the prophets
[27:54] moved to the Forefront of scripture when
[27:55] the nation of Israel splits into two
[27:59] kingdoms and remain so until the return
[28:02] to Jerusalem after the Exile then they
[28:05] go silent for about 500 years until John
[28:10] the Baptist arrives on the scene in our
[28:13] new
[28:14] testament God primarily communicated To
[28:17] His prophets through
[28:20] dreams
[28:22] Visions visits of
[28:24] angels
[28:27] miracles he gave them messages for their
[28:30] own time messages for predicted future
[28:35] times he gave them words of Timeless
[28:37] principles of right and
[28:41] wrong Isaiah the first of the Major
[28:43] Prophets is perhaps the greatest of them
[28:46] all following the division of the
[28:49] Kingdom he introduces himself at the
[28:52] beginning of his book let's turn to the
[28:54] opening verse Isaiah 1:1
[28:58] the vision of Isaiah the son of Amos
[29:02] which he saw concerning Judah and
[29:05] Jerusalem in the days of
[29:08] Uzziah
[29:09] yam ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of
[29:15] Judah from this we learn that Isaiah's
[29:18] dad was named
[29:19] Amos Isaiah's visions and prophecy
[29:22] concerned the people of the kingdom of
[29:24] Judah and its capital
[29:26] Jerusalem his Vision or Ministry
[29:29] commenced near the end of uzziah's Reign
[29:31] and ended sometime during the reign of
[29:33] Hezekiah it's
[29:35] thought it's commonly thought his
[29:37] ministry began around 740 BC within a
[29:39] year of the death of King Uzziah and
[29:42] ended around 700 BC though there is
[29:45] certainly disagreement about the
[29:47] end so this begins nearly 200 years
[29:51] after the kingdom split in 931
[29:55] BC during his ministry the northern
[29:58] Kingdom of Israel was conquered by
[30:00] Assyria in 723 BC and the people exiled
[30:05] and replaced with people from other
[30:07] territories conquered by
[30:09] Assyria about a 100 years after Isaiah
[30:13] Judah was conquered by Babylonia and
[30:15] about 18 years later Jerusalem was
[30:19] destroyed and don't take from this verse
[30:22] that he was in some sort of a continuous
[30:24] Vision trance state for all of those
[30:26] years the division doesn't mean one
[30:29] experience of a division but it's what
[30:32] he saw what the Lord showed him over
[30:36] that
[30:40] time Isaiah didn't seek to be popular or
[30:44] ingratiate himself to people so they
[30:46] would listen to what he was sharing he
[30:48] was blunt he was
[30:51] direct he was often very
[30:55] offensive the rest of chapter one is a
[30:57] call re form in Judah and Jerusalem
[31:01] let's take a look at some of the rest of
[31:02] this short chapter see how the Lord
[31:04] describes the sin of and then presents a
[31:08] path to Mercy and righteousness for the
[31:11] people of
[31:14] Judah one two hear o heavens and give
[31:18] ear o Earth listen up pay attention
[31:22] everyone for the Lord has spoken I have
[31:25] nourished and brought up children the
[31:28] nations of Israel in Judah and they have
[31:31] rebelled against
[31:33] me the ox knoweth his owner and the ass
[31:37] his master's crib but Israel doth not
[31:40] know my people doth not
[31:43] consider what's he saying you're dumber
[31:47] than an ox you don't even have the
[31:49] brains of a
[31:51] donkey not a way to make friends and
[31:55] influence enemies right not what we
[31:57] would call politically correct or
[31:58] sensitive
[32:00] speech a sinful
[32:02] Nation a people Laden with iniquity
[32:07] loaded not just a little a seed of
[32:10] evildoers your fathers were evil
[32:13] children that are corruptors and so are
[32:17] you they speaking of the people have
[32:20] forsaken the Lord they've provoked the
[32:23] Holy One of Israel to anger they have
[32:25] gone away backward
[32:28] why should you be stricken
[32:31] anymore I'll tell you why you will
[32:34] Revolt more and
[32:36] more this is how I see you the whole
[32:39] head is sick the whole heart Fain from
[32:43] the soul of the foot even to the head
[32:44] there's no soundness in it but wounds
[32:48] and bruises putrifying
[32:51] sores they have not been clothed neither
[32:54] bound up neither mollified with ointment
[32:58] who who what do you
[32:59] mean look your country is desolate your
[33:03] cities are burned with fire your land
[33:06] strangers devour it in your presence
[33:09] it's desolate overthrown by strangers
[33:12] and the daughter of Zion Jerusalem and
[33:15] its inhabitants is left as a cottage in
[33:18] a Vineyard as a lodge in a garden of
[33:20] cucumbers as a besieged
[33:24] city except the Lord of hosts had left
[33:26] unto us a very small Remnant we should
[33:29] have been as Sodom and we should have
[33:31] been like unto
[33:33] Gomorrah if the audience was passive
[33:36] until now they'd be seething with either
[33:38] anger or shock at being compared to
[33:41] Sodom and
[33:44] Gomorrah hear the word of the Lord ye
[33:47] rulers of Sodom give ear unto the law of
[33:50] God you people of
[33:52] gomor you can imagine their reaction
[33:55] well what are you talking about Isaiah
[33:58] our King Uzziah he's a descendant of
[34:00] David we honor him we worship at the
[34:03] temple built by Solomon which was filled
[34:06] with the glory of the Lord we preserve
[34:09] the word we're righteous we do the
[34:11] Commandments of Moses who are you to
[34:13] speak to us in such a manner to speak
[34:16] against God's anointed and the children
[34:18] of Israel that have kept the
[34:21] faith the Lord replies to these thoughts
[34:23] and reactions to what purpose is the
[34:26] multitude of your sacri sacrifices unto
[34:28] me sayith the Lord I'm full of the burnt
[34:31] offerings of rams the fat of fed beasts
[34:34] I Delight not in the blood of Bullocks
[34:36] or Lambs or he goats when you come to
[34:38] appear before me who has required this
[34:40] at your hand to tread my courts bring no
[34:44] more vain oblations incense is an
[34:48] Abomination unto me the new moons and
[34:50] sabbaths the coloring of assembl I Cann
[34:51] out away with its
[34:53] iniquity even the solemn meeting you're
[34:57] new moons and your appointed Feast my
[34:59] soul hateth there are trouble unto me I
[35:02] am weary to Bear
[35:04] them I'm sick and tired of your
[35:07] religious ritual it cannot conceal your
[35:12] empty hearts and careless
[35:15] lives and when you spread forth your
[35:18] hands I will hide mine eyes from you yet
[35:20] when you make many
[35:21] prayers I will not
[35:24] hear why your hands are full of
[35:29] blood but
[35:31] wait it doesn't need to be like this you
[35:35] need a change of heart repentance it's
[35:38] not about you and what you do it's about
[35:41] what I can do for you listen to me wash
[35:44] you make you clean put away the evil of
[35:48] your doings from before mine eyes I see
[35:52] everything everything you can't hide
[35:54] from me cease to do evil don't just
[35:58] change your thoughts or your words
[36:00] change your ways just like Jesus said go
[36:04] and sin no
[36:05] more learn to do well seek judgment
[36:09] relieve the oppressed judge the
[36:11] fatherless plead for the Widow come let
[36:14] us reason together saith the Lord though
[36:18] your sins be as Scarlet they shall be
[36:21] white as snow though they be red like
[36:24] Crimson they shall be as wool if he be
[36:26] willing and obedient
[36:28] you shall eat of the good of the
[36:32] land but if you refuse and
[36:35] rebel you shall be devoured with the
[36:38] sword for the mouth of the Lord hath
[36:41] spoken
[36:44] it the parallel we see for ourselves of
[36:48] course is that we are Sinners by
[36:51] Nature I'm talking about this guy but if
[36:54] we accept the Lord and seek his will not
[36:58] just with our words but demonstrated by
[37:01] our actions he's ready to forgive and
[37:05] though our sins be as Scarlet they shall
[37:08] be white as snow though they be red like
[37:11] Crimson they shall be as
[37:15] wool when I read this
[37:17] chapter it almost seems like an overview
[37:20] of brother brandom's Ministry crying out
[37:22] against religious form without the
[37:25] substance without the life or a Paul
[37:29] decrying those that have a form of
[37:31] godliness but deny the power of God or
[37:35] the ministry of Jesus
[37:39] himself in chapter six we see a
[37:42] flashback to the start of Isaiah's
[37:45] calling as a prophet remember the Bible
[37:47] is not focused necessarily on
[37:49] chronological sequences there are lots
[37:51] of
[37:52] flashbacks and Flash forwards
[37:58] in the year that King Uzziah died 740
[38:02] BC I saw also the Lord sitting upon the
[38:05] throne high and lifted up and his train
[38:08] filled the temple what do you suppose
[38:10] Isaiah's reaction was when he saw
[38:14] that he's
[38:18] terrified Moses said Lord let me see you
[38:21] Exodus 33:20 the Lord said you can't see
[38:24] my face no man shall see me and
[38:28] live and Isaiah sees the
[38:32] Lord he is
[38:35] terrified above it above the Lord's
[38:38] Throne stood the sarapin each had six
[38:41] wings with two he covered his faith to
[38:43] his feet and two he did
[38:46] fly and one sarif whispered no one Cried
[38:51] unto another and said holy holy holy is
[38:55] the Lord of hosts the whole Earth is
[38:58] full of his
[39:00] glory and the posts of the door moved at
[39:05] the voice of him that
[39:07] cried and the house was filled with
[39:12] smoke then said I Isaiah speaking wo is
[39:18] me I'm
[39:20] undone I'm a man of unclean lips I dwell
[39:23] in the midst of a people of unclean lips
[39:26] mine eyes have SE seen the king the Lord
[39:29] of
[39:31] hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto
[39:35] me having a live coal in his hand which
[39:37] he be taken with the tongs from The
[39:42] Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[39:46] said Lo this has touched thy lips and
[39:50] thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[39:55] purged
[39:57] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[40:00] saying whom shall I send who will go for
[40:04] us then said I here I
[40:07] am send
[40:10] me and he said go and tell this people
[40:14] hear ye indeed but understand not see ye
[40:19] indeed but perceive not make the heart
[40:23] of this people fat make their ears heavy
[40:26] shut their eyes
[40:27] Li lest they see with their eyes and
[40:30] hear with their ears and understand with
[40:32] their heart and
[40:34] convert and be
[40:37] healed here we see Isaiah going through
[40:41] exactly the same process we do
[40:46] conviction woe is me I am
[40:50] undone I'm a sinner
[40:53] confession mine eyes have seen the king
[40:56] the Lord of host I'm a man of unclean
[40:57] lips I dwell in the midst of a people of
[40:59] unclean lips followed by cleansing Mercy
[41:05] salvation thine iniquity is taken away
[41:08] thy sin
[41:10] purged the Lord asked for a messenger in
[41:12] Isaiah now Sanctified cleansed set aside
[41:18] for service recognizing the grace and
[41:21] mercy of God towards him responds he
[41:23] volunteers to
[41:25] serve a perfect parallel to our
[41:30] experiences as
[41:32] Christians and these last verses reveal
[41:35] the concept of
[41:37] election sadly some are destined to hear
[41:40] without understanding to see without
[41:44] really
[41:49] seeing moving on Isaiah did some really
[41:53] strange
[41:54] things if you lived in Judah during his
[41:58] ministry you would have probably been
[42:01] shocked not only in his direct language
[42:04] but but consider this for example in
[42:06] Isaiah
[42:07] 20 in the year that tarton came unto
[42:10] ashdod when Sargon the king of Assyria
[42:12] sent him and fought against ashdod and
[42:15] took it that was in 713 BC 27 years into
[42:20] his ministry 10 years after the
[42:23] destruction of the northern kingdom by
[42:25] Assyria at the the same time the Lord
[42:29] spake the Lord by Isaiah the son of Amos
[42:32] saying go and loose a sackcloth from off
[42:35] thy loins and put off thy shoe from thy
[42:39] foot and he did so walking naked and
[42:48] Barefoot well how long did this go on
[42:51] and the Lord said like as my servant
[42:54] Isaiah hath walked naked and Barefoot
[42:56] three
[42:57] years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt
[43:01] and upon
[43:03] Ethiopia so shall the king of Assyria
[43:06] lead away the Egyptians prisoners and
[43:08] the Ethiopians captives young and old
[43:12] naked and Barefoot even with their
[43:14] buttocks uncovered to the shame of
[43:18] Egypt note that Judah at times sought to
[43:21] Ally themselves with Egypt for
[43:23] protection against a common enemy like
[43:25] Assyria
[43:27] they're warned about this again in
[43:29] Chapter 30 the Lord is showing them that
[43:31] Egypt won't be able to help
[43:33] them but can you imagine the gossip that
[43:36] went around for those three years put
[43:39] yourself in their
[43:41] place would you have
[43:43] understood would I would I AE with
[43:47] Isaiah or would I think there goes that
[43:50] crazy guy
[43:52] again he just never likes us and now
[43:55] he's running around Buck
[43:58] Naked his behavior it's
[44:03] disgusting well moving on in chapter 36
[44:06] we read of the invasion and near
[44:08] conquest of Judah by sakb King of
[44:11] Assyria you can read about this as well
[44:13] in 2 Kings 18 and
[44:17] 19 now it came to pass in the 14th year
[44:20] of King hezakiah so this is about 701
[44:24] BC Isaiah's been ministering for about
[44:27] 39 years now that sakb king of Assyria
[44:32] came up against all the defensed cities
[44:34] of Judah and took
[44:37] them he conquered most of Judah just 20
[44:40] years after Israel was conquered and
[44:42] carried off into captivity by his
[44:44] predecessors Shaner IV and Sargon
[44:48] II and the king of Assyria sent rabsha
[44:51] from Leakes Lakes is the second largest
[44:54] city in Judah at that time which he had
[44:56] just conquered
[44:58] sent rabsha from Lakers to Jerusalem
[45:00] under King Hezekiah with a great
[45:03] Army he stood by the conduit of the
[45:06] upper pool and the highway of the
[45:09] Fuller's field and he he starts
[45:11] psychological
[45:15] warfare he stands up and shouts in
[45:18] Hebrew so everybody can
[45:20] hear boasting the sex of the Assyrian
[45:24] army telling Jerusalem to surrender
[45:27] surrender become slaves but live or
[45:30] resist and will kill
[45:32] you nobody has withstood us yet and you
[45:36] can't either none of your other cities
[45:38] of Judah have withstood you your God
[45:40] hasn't protected them and he won't
[45:43] protect
[45:45] you Isaiah 37 it came to pass when King
[45:49] Hezekiah heard it that he rent his
[45:52] clothes covered himself with sackcloth
[45:55] burlap
[45:57] and
[45:58] went into the house of the
[46:01] Lord and he sent El aim who was over the
[46:04] household and shebna the Scribe and the
[46:08] Elders of the priests covered with
[46:11] sackcloth unto Isaiah the prophet the
[46:15] son of Amos notice Isaiah Hezekiah
[46:19] doesn't sit down with his war council he
[46:22] doesn't run to the Armory for more
[46:24] arrows he comes in humility he takes off
[46:27] his Royal robes comes in humility to the
[46:31] temple and sends word not to the high
[46:35] priest but to the prophet
[46:38] Isaiah we skipped over most of the book
[46:41] but Isaiah had made a number of
[46:43] short-term prophecies before this year
[46:45] is over thus and so will
[46:47] happen which came to pass
[46:50] precisely as he had declared them
[46:54] Hezekiah knew
[46:55] this and the king's Messengers said to
[46:58] Isaiah thus sayith
[47:00] Hezekiah this day is a day of trouble
[47:04] and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the
[47:06] children are come to the birth and
[47:08] there's not enough strength to bring
[47:11] forth it may be that the Lord thy God
[47:14] will hear the words of rabsha whom the
[47:16] king of Assyria his master has sent to
[47:18] reproach the Living God and will reprove
[47:22] The Words which the Lord thy God hath
[47:24] heard wherefore lift up thy praise PR
[47:27] for the remnant that's
[47:29] left and so the Servants of King
[47:33] Hezekiah came to Isaiah and Isaiah said
[47:37] unto
[47:38] them thus shall ye say to your master
[47:42] King Hezekiah thus saith the Lord be not
[47:46] afraid of the words that thou Hast heard
[47:49] wherewith the Servants of the king of
[47:52] Assyria have blasphemed me behold I will
[47:57] send a blast upon Him He Shall hear a
[48:00] rumor and return to his own land and I
[48:03] will cause him to Fall by The Sword in
[48:06] his own
[48:08] land well the Assyrians continue to
[48:11] threaten skipping to verse 14 Hezekiah
[48:14] received a letter from the hand of The
[48:15] Messengers of the king of Assyria and
[48:17] read it and Hezekiah went up under the
[48:20] house of the Lord and spread it before
[48:23] the
[48:24] Lord Lord read this
[48:28] and Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord saying
[48:30] oh lord of hosts God of Israel that
[48:33] dwelleth between the Cherub beam Thou
[48:35] Art God even thou alone of all the
[48:37] kingdoms of the earth thou Hast made
[48:39] Heaven and Earth incline thine ear O
[48:42] Lord and hear open thine eyes oh Lord
[48:44] and see hear all the words of sakra
[48:47] which he has sent to reproach the Living
[48:50] God of a truth Lord the kings of Assyria
[48:55] have laid waste all the nations
[48:57] and their countries and have cast their
[48:59] gods Into the Fire for they were no Gods
[49:02] but the work of men's hands wood and
[49:04] stone therefore have they destroyed them
[49:06] now therefore oh Lord Our God save us
[49:09] from his hand that all the kingdoms of
[49:12] the earth may know that thou art the
[49:14] Lord even thou
[49:17] only then Isaiah the son of Amos sent
[49:21] unto Hezekiah saying thus saith the Lord
[49:24] God of
[49:25] Israel whereas thou Hast prayed to
[49:28] me against sakb king of Assyria you
[49:32] didn't go to your captains you didn't go
[49:34] to your generals you didn't go to your
[49:36] Armory you came to me this is the word
[49:40] which the Lord has spoken concerning him
[49:44] the Virgin the daughter of Zion hath
[49:47] despised thee and laugh thee to Scorn
[49:50] the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her
[49:52] head at
[49:54] thee whom hast thou reproached and
[49:56] blasphemed and against whom hast thou
[49:58] exalted thy voice and lifted up thine
[50:01] eyes on high even against the Holy One
[50:05] of Israel skipping to verse 33 therefore
[50:08] thus saith the Lord concerning the king
[50:10] of Assyria he shall not come into this
[50:12] city nor shoot an arrow here nor come
[50:15] before it with shields nor cast a bank
[50:18] against it by the way that he came by
[50:21] the same shall he return and shall not
[50:24] come into this city saith the Lord Lord
[50:27] for I will defend this city to save it
[50:31] for my own sake and for my servant
[50:34] Isaiah oh no no for my servant
[50:37] Hezekiah oh no no for my servant David's
[50:44] sake then the angel of the Lord went
[50:47] forth and smokee in the camp of the
[50:49] Assyrians 104 score and 5,000 and when
[50:54] they arose the rest of them early in in
[50:56] the morning behold they were all dead
[51:00] corpses so sakb king of Assyria departed
[51:04] and went and returned and dwelt at
[51:06] Nineveh notice his Palace is at Nineveh
[51:11] and it came to pass as sakra was
[51:14] worshiping in the house of nisr his God
[51:17] that adrc and sherzer his sons smote him
[51:20] with a sword they killed him they
[51:23] escaped into the land of Armenia and Es
[51:26] had and his son reigned in his
[51:30] stead what why why are you pointing that
[51:33] out brother
[51:36] l in the various objects celebrating
[51:39] sakib's conquests he admits he never
[51:43] conquered
[51:44] Jerusalem instead he exacted a ransom so
[51:48] we have corroborating testimony from
[51:50] Antiquity as to the saving of Jerusalem
[51:53] at that time by the very King the Lord
[51:55] defeated the only city he didn't
[52:00] conquer excuse
[52:03] me I'm a little
[52:06] excited have you seen the news
[52:09] lately something just came to light in
[52:11] the past few weeks about this very
[52:14] event Isaiah chapter
[52:17] 37 was in the
[52:21] news maybe the Lord was saving it for us
[52:25] tonight I like to to think so many of
[52:28] the towns and cities the Assyrians
[52:30] conquered in Isaiah's day are lost to
[52:33] history their locations are
[52:36] uncertain and where exactly did this
[52:39] Army encamp against
[52:45] Jerusalem using information from this
[52:50] relief on the
[52:52] wall of a palace in Nineveh
[52:56] showing
[52:58] sakib's Army attacking lakish a
[53:02] gentleman named Steven Compton an
[53:04] independent scholar specializing in
[53:06] eastern archaeologies believes he's
[53:08] identified the site of the lakish
[53:10] encampment as well as many other sites
[53:13] of Assyrian encampments in sarb's
[53:16] campaign some
[53:17] 2,700 years ago he details these
[53:23] finds are you ready for this in the June
[53:28] 2024 edition of the publication near
[53:31] Eastern
[53:34] archaeology this just came
[53:37] out I think that makes it news
[53:40] notice the Syrian Camp is an oval in
[53:46] shape just like this one north of the
[53:49] old city of Jerusalem a location known
[53:52] as ammunition Hill this is likely one of
[53:55] the sites
[53:57] of sarb's army until now this location
[54:02] was long thought to have been a Roman
[54:04] military
[54:06] Camp uh-uh Roman camps are always
[54:11] rectangular if you've been to Mada and
[54:13] looked down at the traces of the camps
[54:16] from nearly 2,000 years ago you can
[54:18] plainly see their shapes as rectangles
[54:20] and not just near Mada this was standard
[54:23] practice in the Roman army
[54:27] I've included a URL in this slide in
[54:29] case you want to read an article you
[54:31] don't got to write the whole thing down
[54:32] patterns of evidence one word.com search
[54:36] there and you'll you'll find some more
[54:38] information about this if you
[54:42] wish well that's very interesting
[54:44] brother Lyall but one of our stated
[54:47] purposes in going through the books of
[54:49] the Old Testament in our Bibles is to
[54:51] show places that speak of the Messiah of
[54:54] Jesus Isaiah is filled with such
[54:58] references many of them are so familiar
[55:01] to us just a sampling of them Isaiah 7
[55:04] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[55:06] Behold a virgin shall conceive bear a
[55:10] son shall call his name
[55:13] Emanuel the
[55:15] Fulfillment Matthew 1 now all this was
[55:19] done why that it might be fulfilled
[55:22] which was spoken of the Lord by the
[55:24] prophet Isaiah saying Behold a virgin
[55:27] shall be with child and shall bring
[55:29] forth a son and they shall call his name
[55:31] Emmanuel which being interpreted as God
[55:34] with us we say Emmanuel but it's
[55:39] m another
[55:41] prophecy Isaiah 9 nevertheless the
[55:44] dimness shall not be such as was in her
[55:47] vexation when at the first he lightly
[55:49] Afflicted the land of zebulun and the
[55:52] land of nephal those were two sons of
[55:55] Jacob and afterward did more grievously
[55:58] a afflict her by the way of the sea
[56:01] which is the Sea of Galilee Beyond
[56:03] Jordan and Galilee of the Nations
[56:05] Galilee of the nations of the Gentiles I
[56:09] thought this was Israeli territory the
[56:12] people that walked in darkness have seen
[56:14] a great light they that dwell in the
[56:17] land of the shadow of death upon them
[56:21] hath the light shined I I think he's
[56:24] talking about Herod at this point but in
[56:26] Matthew 4 we read a fulfillment now when
[56:29] Jesus had heard that John the Baptist
[56:31] was cast into prison he departed into
[56:34] gallilee leaving Nazareth he came and
[56:37] dwelt at Capernaum which is upon the Sea
[56:39] Coast it's on the shore of the Sea of
[56:41] Galilee in the borders of
[56:44] zebulun and Napalm naftali why did he go
[56:50] there that it might be fulfilled which
[56:52] was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying
[56:55] the land of Z and the land of nephine by
[56:57] the way of the sea the the lake Beyond
[57:00] Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the
[57:04] people which sat in darkness saw a great
[57:07] light and to them which sat in the
[57:09] region and shadow of death light is
[57:13] sprung
[57:15] up another one I really like this one I
[57:19] like all of them but Isaiah 40:3 the
[57:23] voice of him that crith in the
[57:24] wilderness prepare the way of the Lord
[57:27] make straight in the desert a highway
[57:29] for our God every Valley shall be
[57:31] exalted Every Mountain and Hill should
[57:33] be made low the Crooked shall be made
[57:35] straight the rough places plain smooth
[57:39] the glory of the Lord shall be revealed
[57:43] and All Flesh shall see it together for
[57:47] the mouth of the Lord has spoken it and
[57:49] it's
[57:50] fulfillment Matthew 3 in those days Came
[57:53] John the Baptist preaching of the
[57:55] Wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye
[57:58] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand this is
[58:01] he that was spoken of by the prophet
[58:03] Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in
[58:06] the wilderness prepare you the way of
[58:07] the Lord make his path
[58:09] straight Mark and Luke also report this
[58:14] and so does John John's gospel is even
[58:16] more
[58:17] direct and when the representatives sent
[58:21] from the Pharisees asked John the
[58:22] Baptist oh what then art thou Elias and
[58:26] he
[58:27] said I am not art thou that Prophet
[58:30] spoken by Moses and he
[58:33] answered
[58:35] no so they said to him who are you that
[58:39] we may give an answer to them that sent
[58:40] us what sayest thou of
[58:44] thyself and John
[58:46] said I am the voice of one crying in the
[58:50] wilderness make straight the way of the
[58:52] Lord as said the prophet Isaiah
[58:56] it wasn't just others that identified
[58:58] him he identified himself that was
[59:01] pretty bold in front of those
[59:04] Pharisees another
[59:06] prophecy Isaiah 42 behold my servant
[59:09] whom I uphold my elect and whom my soul
[59:13] delighteth I have put my spirit upon him
[59:15] he shall bring forth judgment to the
[59:17] Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up
[59:21] nor cause his voice to be heard in the
[59:24] street
[59:26] a bruised Reed shall he not break and
[59:28] the smoking flax shall he not quench he
[59:30] shall bring forth judgment unto
[59:33] truth he shall not fail nor be
[59:36] discouraged till he have set judgment in
[59:38] the earth and the Isles the coasts the
[59:42] Gentiles the other nations shall wait
[59:44] for his
[59:46] law the
[59:48] Fulfillment but when Jesus knew it he
[59:51] withdrew himself from F and great
[59:53] multitudes followed him and he healed
[59:55] them all
[59:57] and charged them that they should not
[59:59] make him
[1:00:01] known
[1:00:03] why
[1:00:05] why that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:00:08] spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying
[1:00:11] behold my servant whom I have chosen my
[1:00:14] beloved in whom my soul is well pleased
[1:00:17] I will put my spirit upon him and he
[1:00:18] shall show judgment to the Gentiles he
[1:00:21] shall not strive nor cry neither shall
[1:00:23] any man hear his voice in the streets a
[1:00:26] bruised Reed shall he not break smoking
[1:00:28] flax shall he not quench till he send
[1:00:30] forth judgment under Victory and in his
[1:00:33] name shall the Gentiles
[1:00:35] trust perfect
[1:00:39] fulfillment another prophecy Isaiah 42 I
[1:00:43] the Lord have called thee in
[1:00:44] righteousness and will hold thine hand
[1:00:45] and will keep thee in give thee for a
[1:00:47] covenant of the people for a light of
[1:00:49] the Gentiles to open the blind eyes to
[1:00:52] bring out the prisoners from the prison
[1:00:54] and them that sit in darkness out of the
[1:00:56] prison house and we see a fulfillment as
[1:01:00] Jesus is asked by John's followers
[1:01:02] John's been in prison for a while he
[1:01:04] scratching his head and wondering did
[1:01:06] that really happen at that
[1:01:10] baptism John's Messengers said unto
[1:01:13] Jesus art thou he that should come or do
[1:01:17] we look for
[1:01:19] another Jesus answered and said unto
[1:01:21] them go and show John again those things
[1:01:26] which you do hear and see the blind
[1:01:28] receive their
[1:01:29] sight the lame walk lepers are cleansed
[1:01:32] the deaf here the dead are raised up the
[1:01:33] poor have the gospel preached to them
[1:01:35] and blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[1:01:39] offended in
[1:01:41] me another one I'm sure that you're all
[1:01:44] familiar with Isaiah 61 the spirit of
[1:01:46] the Lord is upon me because the Lord
[1:01:49] hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings
[1:01:51] unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up
[1:01:53] the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to
[1:01:55] the captives and the opening of the
[1:01:57] prison to them that are bound to
[1:01:59] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:02:01] the day of the Vengeance of our God to
[1:02:03] comfort all that
[1:02:04] mourn and in Luke's
[1:02:08] gospel Jesus came to Nazareth his
[1:02:11] hometown where he' been brought up and
[1:02:14] as his custom was he went into the
[1:02:16] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[1:02:19] up for to
[1:02:21] read There was delivered unto him the
[1:02:24] book SC
[1:02:26] of the prophet
[1:02:28] Isaiah and when he opened the book he
[1:02:31] found the place where it was
[1:02:34] written Jesus speaking the spirit of the
[1:02:37] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[1:02:40] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[1:02:43] hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:02:45] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[1:02:47] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:02:50] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:02:52] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:02:57] and Jesus closed the book and gave it
[1:03:00] again to the
[1:03:02] minister and sat
[1:03:04] down and the eyes of all them that were
[1:03:07] in the synagogue were fastened on
[1:03:10] him note when you're reading in the
[1:03:13] gospels always pay attention to Jesus
[1:03:16] when he sits and speaks because he's
[1:03:19] about to
[1:03:21] teach and he began to say unto them this
[1:03:24] day is this scripture
[1:03:29] fulfilled in your
[1:03:35] ears something else about the book of
[1:03:38] Isaiah it it it parallels the Bible I
[1:03:42] mentioned Isaiah is a controversial book
[1:03:45] in the late 18th century there arose a
[1:03:48] method of research sometimes referred to
[1:03:50] as higher criticism or historical
[1:03:53] criticism it's a way to de construct and
[1:03:56] examine ancient texts including the
[1:03:59] books of the Bible looking for Clues
[1:04:01] from language idiom and style as to
[1:04:05] their era perhaps their
[1:04:08] authorship as a result of this approach
[1:04:11] Isaiah is often broken into two
[1:04:14] sections Isaiah's name is mentioned over
[1:04:17] and over in chapters 1 through
[1:04:19] 39 and his name is not mentioned again
[1:04:23] chapters 40- 66 the writing style is
[1:04:27] also different in this second
[1:04:30] part some say that Isaiah stopped
[1:04:32] writing after chapter 39 for perhaps a
[1:04:35] period of 15 years or so and and then
[1:04:37] wrote the last part of the book others
[1:04:39] suggest and some insist the second part
[1:04:42] was written in one or two stages a
[1:04:44] century or more later partly because of
[1:04:46] the Precision he he predicts a
[1:04:49] Babylonian guy named Cyrus a couple
[1:04:51] hundred years before Cyrus existed and
[1:04:54] when Assyria was the ascendant thing and
[1:04:57] Babylonia was just a
[1:05:00] Backwater regardless of the controversy
[1:05:03] of when or by whom let's take a quick
[1:05:06] look at this point of
[1:05:10] division consider the opening lines
[1:05:13] first of all the first part is 39
[1:05:17] chapters corresponds to 39 books of the
[1:05:20] Old Testament the second from 40 through
[1:05:24] 66 would then correspond to the New
[1:05:26] Testament well if that's true then let's
[1:05:29] take a look at the beginning of chapter
[1:05:32] 40 which would correspond to the
[1:05:34] beginning of the New Testament the
[1:05:36] gospels right comfort you comfort ye my
[1:05:38] people saith your God speak you
[1:05:41] comfortably Jerusalem cry unto her that
[1:05:43] her Warfare is accomplished her iniquity
[1:05:46] is pardoned she hath received of the
[1:05:49] Lord's hand double for all her sins the
[1:05:51] voice of him that crith in the
[1:05:53] wilderness prepare ye the the way of the
[1:05:56] Lord make straight in the desert a
[1:05:57] highway for our God every Valley shall
[1:05:59] be exalted Every Mountain and Hill shall
[1:06:02] be made low the Crooked shall be made
[1:06:03] straight the rough plac is plain the
[1:06:06] glory of the Lord shall be revealed and
[1:06:08] All Flesh shall see it together for the
[1:06:10] mouth of the Lord ha spoken
[1:06:12] it what an introduction to the gospels
[1:06:17] of the New Testament the good news
[1:06:19] bringing comfort and eventually the
[1:06:21] comforter to the
[1:06:24] people and we saw in each of the Gospel
[1:06:27] accounts the first part of the New
[1:06:28] Testament all begin with quotes from
[1:06:32] this section identifying John the
[1:06:36] Baptist at a minimum it's a fascinating
[1:06:39] parallel in
[1:06:41] placement consider how the New Testament
[1:06:44] ends in Revelation with a description of
[1:06:46] a new Heaven and a new Earth Revelation
[1:06:48] 21 I saw a new
[1:06:51] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[1:06:55] half Heaven and the first Earth were
[1:06:56] passed away there was no more
[1:06:59] Sea and the bride of Christ is
[1:07:04] described as being
[1:07:08] Jerusalem verse n there came unto me one
[1:07:11] of the Seven Angels which had the seven
[1:07:13] vials full of the seven last plagues and
[1:07:16] talked with me saying come hither I'll
[1:07:20] show Thee the bride the Lamb's
[1:07:24] wife and he carried me away in the
[1:07:26] spirit to a great and high mountain and
[1:07:28] showed me that great City the holy
[1:07:34] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from
[1:07:39] God now look at the end of Isaiah the
[1:07:42] last two chapters Isaiah 65 say for
[1:07:45] behold I create new heavens and a new
[1:07:48] Earth the former shall not be remembered
[1:07:50] nor come into mind be ye glad and
[1:07:54] rejoiceful forever and that which I
[1:07:57] create for
[1:07:58] behold I create
[1:08:01] Jerusalem a rejoicing at her people a
[1:08:06] joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and
[1:08:10] joy in my people and the voice of
[1:08:13] weeping shall be heard no more in her
[1:08:16] nor the voice of
[1:08:19] crying Isaiah concludes in chapter 66 as
[1:08:22] the new heavens and the new Earth which
[1:08:24] I will make shall remain before me saith
[1:08:27] the Lord so shall your seed and your
[1:08:29] name remain it shall come to pass that
[1:08:33] from one new moon to another from one
[1:08:35] Sabbath to another shall All Flesh come
[1:08:37] to worship before
[1:08:39] me saith the
[1:08:43] Lord
[1:08:48] wow what about some of this I mean that
[1:08:51] these parallels are just amazing amen
[1:08:56] one of the objections or criticism
[1:08:58] raised about Isaiah is its disturbing
[1:09:02] accuracy its Precision naming Cyrus as a
[1:09:05] conqueror a couple hundred years before
[1:09:07] he came to power oh that's just history
[1:09:10] written as if it were prophecy and
[1:09:12] higher criticism gives us evidence that
[1:09:14] this part of Isaiah was not written by
[1:09:16] Isaiah or during his
[1:09:19] lifetime well the oldest Hebrew
[1:09:21] manuscripts were for centuries from
[1:09:24] around 1,000
[1:09:27] ad who knows if they were accurate or if
[1:09:30] they'd been altered the oldest Greek
[1:09:32] seagan Scrolls or parchments are from
[1:09:34] about 400 ad and these were from
[1:09:38] Christian monasteries it's easy to
[1:09:41] Discount some of the prophecies
[1:09:43] especially of Isaiah concerning the
[1:09:46] Messiah they were often considered
[1:09:48] likely to be the result of later
[1:09:50] Christian influence or manipulation
[1:09:56] well in this time of skepticism and
[1:10:00] rejection you believe the Bible you're
[1:10:03] kind of
[1:10:04] silly in
[1:10:07] 1947 came the discovery of the Dead Sea
[1:10:11] Scrolls you may recall my telling the
[1:10:13] story of how Dr elazer sukenik of the
[1:10:16] chair of Palestinian archaeology at the
[1:10:18] Hebrew University in Jerusalem came into
[1:10:21] possession of three of the first Scrolls
[1:10:25] on November
[1:10:27] 29th
[1:10:30] 1947 he began to read from them in his
[1:10:33] home that same day at the very hour the
[1:10:37] radio was playing a broadcast of the
[1:10:40] live vote at the UN that created the
[1:10:44] state of
[1:10:46] Israel one of the three Scrolls in
[1:10:49] sukenik possession that fateful night
[1:10:52] when a Hebrew scholar again read ancient
[1:10:55] Hebrew writing that had Lain dormant for
[1:10:57] nearly 2,000 years was a partial copy of
[1:11:02] the book we're reviewing this
[1:11:05] evening
[1:11:07] Isaiah and not only
[1:11:09] that but of all the Scrolls eventually
[1:11:13] found there's only
[1:11:14] one that is a complete book of the Bible
[1:11:18] as one scroll and not collections of
[1:11:20] fragments from various caves a scroll
[1:11:24] reli dated to about 150
[1:11:28] BC long before the time of Jesus 24 ft
[1:11:34] long 17 sheets of parchment each 10 or
[1:11:37] 10 and a half inches tall about the same
[1:11:40] as a standard sheet of
[1:11:42] paper 54 Columns of text it's the book
[1:11:46] of
[1:11:47] Isaiah it's not one of the Books of
[1:11:50] Moses but the book that proclaims the
[1:11:54] Messiah
[1:11:57] moving the
[1:11:58] calendar back over a thousand
[1:12:02] years and the accuracy of the copies
[1:12:04] from 1,000 ad when compared testify to
[1:12:09] the Integrity of the scribes who labored
[1:12:13] painstakingly copying the biblical texts
[1:12:15] through centuries and Millennia from the
[1:12:18] time of Moses to the present
[1:12:22] day the Dead Sea schools how God
[1:12:26] preserved these to come to light in an
[1:12:29] age of unparalleled
[1:12:31] skepticism of times of challenge to
[1:12:34] simple faith in the god of the
[1:12:36] Bible the one true God the creator of
[1:12:41] the universe the lover and Redeemer of
[1:12:44] our
[1:12:46] souls I just think of that song how I
[1:12:49] love him how I adore him my breath my
[1:12:52] sunshine my all in all the great Creator
[1:12:56] became my savior and all God's fullness
[1:13:00] dwells in
[1:13:03] him let's consider
[1:13:06] Isaiah chapter 53 now that we know its
[1:13:10] historical accuracy dated to well before
[1:13:14] the time of Christ it's only 12 verses
[1:13:16] let's read the whole
[1:13:19] chapter who hath believed our
[1:13:21] report to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:13:25] revealed for he shall grow up before
[1:13:28] him as a tender plant and as a root out
[1:13:31] of a dry ground he speaking of Jesus he
[1:13:34] hath no form nor cess and when we shall
[1:13:38] see him there's no beauty that we should
[1:13:41] desire him he's
[1:13:43] despised rejected of men a Man of
[1:13:46] Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid
[1:13:50] as it were our faces from him he was
[1:13:53] despised
[1:13:55] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[1:13:58] borne our griefs and carried our
[1:14:02] sorrows yet we did asse him stricken
[1:14:05] smitten of God and
[1:14:09] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[1:14:15] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:14:19] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:14:24] was upon him him with his stripes we are
[1:14:29] healed all we like sheep have gone
[1:14:32] astray we have turned everyone to his
[1:14:36] own way right he's talking about me and
[1:14:40] the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[1:14:43] of us all he was oppressed he was
[1:14:47] afflicted he opened not his mouth he's
[1:14:50] brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a
[1:14:52] sheep before her shearers as dumb
[1:14:55] he opened not his mouth he was taken
[1:14:58] from prison and from judgment who shall
[1:15:00] declare his generation for he was cut
[1:15:02] off out of the land of the living for
[1:15:04] the transgression of my people for the
[1:15:07] transgression of wildy Johnson was he
[1:15:12] stricken he made his grave with the
[1:15:15] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1:15:18] because he had done no violence neither
[1:15:19] was any deceit in his mouth yet it
[1:15:24] pleased the Lord to bruise him Heath put
[1:15:28] him to grief when thou shalt make his
[1:15:31] soul an offering for sin he shall see
[1:15:34] his seed he shall prolong his days and
[1:15:37] the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper
[1:15:40] in his hand he shall see the travail of
[1:15:43] his soul and shall be
[1:15:45] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[1:15:48] righteous servant justify many for he
[1:15:52] shall bear their iniquities
[1:15:55] therefore will I divide him a portion
[1:15:58] with the great and he shall divide the
[1:16:01] spoiler with the strong because he ha
[1:16:03] poured out his soul unto death he was
[1:16:06] numbered with the
[1:16:08] transgressors he be the sin of many and
[1:16:11] made
[1:16:13] intercession for the
[1:16:16] transgressors the suffering
[1:16:19] servant I want to share something with
[1:16:23] you this this is is a photo of Dr Seth
[1:16:26] pastell raised in a devout Jewish
[1:16:30] Home challenged by scripture and being
[1:16:33] told by his peers that he didn't really
[1:16:35] understand Hebrew he became a Hebrew
[1:16:37] scholar eventually obtaining a PhD in
[1:16:40] Hebrew Bible is now a recognized
[1:16:42] Authority Biblical Hebrew he's the chair
[1:16:44] of of of Hebrew language at a university
[1:16:46] in natanya Israel now he's the author of
[1:16:50] reading Moses seeing Jesus that I
[1:16:52] referred to when we looked at the Book
[1:16:54] of Numbers
[1:16:55] several months
[1:16:56] ago I want to play an 80c audio clip of
[1:17:01] part of his
[1:17:02] testimony telling how he came to faith
[1:17:06] in Christ I grew up in New Jersey very
[1:17:10] well aware of our Jewish identity I do
[1:17:12] remember that whenever my dad was really
[1:17:14] really angry the worst thing he could
[1:17:16] ever say was Jesus Christ my mom started
[1:17:19] to become more and more spiritual and
[1:17:21] she started to read the Bible she
[1:17:22] started to read the Old Testament what
[1:17:24] we called it or the the Hebrew Bible she
[1:17:27] became more and more Curious
[1:17:28] intellectually with Jesus she came home
[1:17:31] with the very good news to tell my
[1:17:34] father maray I've been searching the
[1:17:36] scriptures I've been reading I've been
[1:17:38] studying and Jesus is the
[1:17:42] Messiah my father started to cry he said
[1:17:45] I thought I married a Jew how could you
[1:17:47] betray our people how could you do this
[1:17:49] please tell me why do you believe in
[1:17:52] Jesus but please don't show me the New
[1:17:54] Testament because of course we knew
[1:17:56] Christians hate Jews Christians believe
[1:17:58] in the New Testament the New Testament
[1:18:00] must be anti-semitic as she read to him
[1:18:03] Isaiah 53 my father got very angry and
[1:18:06] he stopped her and he said I told you
[1:18:08] Lorraine I don't want to hear the New
[1:18:12] Testament and she stopped and she said
[1:18:14] well muray this is our side of the book
[1:18:18] this is this is not the New Testament
[1:18:19] there was this is a prophecy from 700
[1:18:22] years before Jesus was born
[1:18:25] well my father was in
[1:18:32] shock just in case you're wondering his
[1:18:35] father eventually came to faith in
[1:18:36] Christ as well
[1:18:41] God let's take a closer look there's so
[1:18:44] much in this
[1:18:46] book Let's Take just one lesson from it
[1:18:51] that we can apply to our lives every day
[1:18:55] uh please look at the card with the
[1:18:57] verse that you were
[1:19:06] given they that wait upon the
[1:19:10] Lord shall renew their
[1:19:13] strength they shall Mount up with wings
[1:19:15] as eagles they shall run and not be
[1:19:18] weary they shall walk and not faint this
[1:19:22] is a very familiar scripture to us but
[1:19:25] what does that
[1:19:27] mean they that wait on the Lord Lord
[1:19:29] I've prayed it's in your hands now I'm
[1:19:31] going to take a nap and when you get it
[1:19:33] done come and let me know I'm just gonna
[1:19:35] wait is that what it means I I I don't
[1:19:39] think so so I I thought what what are
[1:19:42] you saying here Lord so go to the Hebrew
[1:19:47] what is the Hebrew that the King James
[1:19:50] translates say but they that wait upon
[1:19:54] others use trust in hope in wait for
[1:19:58] turns out it's a single Hebrew word two
[1:20:03] syllables three
[1:20:05] letters
[1:20:07] kava strong tells us as a primitive root
[1:20:12] to bind together perhaps by
[1:20:15] twisting that is collect figuratively to
[1:20:18] expect gather together look patiently
[1:20:22] Terry wait for Honor upon like most
[1:20:25] words it has many
[1:20:30] meanings why is there brother Lyle on
[1:20:35] this that you've given us not a thread
[1:20:38] or a ribbon or a string but
[1:20:44] twine twine is made by
[1:20:49] twisting so you could say they that are
[1:20:52] entwined with the Lord
[1:20:55] shall renew their strength not to
[1:20:58] replace the concepts of patiently
[1:20:59] waiting or hoping or
[1:21:01] trusting but the
[1:21:03] goal is to become
[1:21:06] entwined
[1:21:08] Inseparable isn't that where our
[1:21:10] strength in the Lord comes from our
[1:21:13] Unity with our cleaving to him to be
[1:21:19] entwined
[1:21:21] Inseparable Jesus said in one of his
[1:21:24] last prayers a prayer that specifically
[1:21:27] includes us includes you includes me
[1:21:31] musicians if you would please
[1:21:34] come John 17 Jesus is praying as thou
[1:21:40] sent me into the world even so have I
[1:21:45] also sent them my disciples into the
[1:21:48] world and for their sakes I sanctify
[1:21:53] myself that they also might be
[1:21:55] Sanctified through the truth neither
[1:21:58] pray I for these alone but for them also
[1:22:03] which Shall Believe on me through their
[1:22:06] word that's Jesus praying for
[1:22:10] you that's Jesus praying for me do you
[1:22:15] think God heard the prayers of
[1:22:19] Jesus that they that's us we
[1:22:25] all may be one as thou father art in me
[1:22:28] and I in thee that they also may be one
[1:22:32] in
[1:22:33] US Ecclesiastes tells us a three-fold C
[1:22:36] three-fold cord is not quickly broken
[1:22:39] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:22:43] sent
[1:22:44] me and the glory which thou gavest me I
[1:22:48] have given
[1:22:50] them why to what end for what purpose
[1:22:54] the that they may be
[1:22:57] one
[1:22:58] entwined even as we are one utterly
[1:23:02] intwined Inseparable he emphasizes this
[1:23:06] and I in them and thou in me that they
[1:23:09] may be made perfect complete in one and
[1:23:15] that the world may know that thou Hast
[1:23:17] sent me and H has loved
[1:23:20] them as thou has loved me
[1:23:28] with that thought with that context
[1:23:32] let's close this portion of the service
[1:23:34] and pass it back to brother Daniel as we
[1:23:36] worship and song from
[1:23:39] Isaiah chapter
