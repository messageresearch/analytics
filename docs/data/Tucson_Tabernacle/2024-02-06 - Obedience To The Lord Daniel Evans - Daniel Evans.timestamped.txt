[0:01] Is he worthy?
[0:03] Yes.
[0:05] This morning,
[0:07] Brother Jordan mentioned it.
[0:10] Um,
[0:12] in the year that I've been pastor, I've
[0:13] never seen such chaos, so many problems
[0:17] before a service
[0:20] back there. and
[0:22] and seeing how things weren't weren't
[0:25] working and and and we were having
[0:26] trouble with with the song service and
[0:29] we we were having trouble with the
[0:30] people and and with the Sunday schools
[0:32] and and even the internet went out in
[0:36] the building. We weren't streaming.
[0:39] So, I was nervous.
[0:42] And if you know me,
[0:45] I like order.
[0:48] I do. I like things in order and it uh
[0:53] it's not in my happy place when when
[0:56] things are not in order. It's just
[0:58] bothering me this morning and
[1:02] I just got down back there and and
[1:05] praying and I said I said, "Lord,
[1:10] what's going on?" And something inside
[1:13] of me said, "Well, what's this title of
[1:18] your sermon today?"
[1:20] And it's obedience to the Lord.
[1:24] And uh so before we get started, let's
[1:27] just I'm going to come down here and
[1:29] let's just let's just bow our heads and
[1:32] ask him.
[1:36] Almighty God,
[1:40] Lord Jesus, how many times through
[1:43] history have Father, you've taken man's
[1:46] will and and what we think should be and
[1:49] then Lord, you change them. And if it's
[1:51] a willing heart, Father, that we can get
[1:55] into your spirit, then Lord, you bless
[1:58] the people.
[2:00] May today be one of those days, Father.
[2:04] Forgive me, Lord, for being nervous.
[2:10] And Lord, take
[2:14] this service. And Father, how many
[2:18] problems that that we've had at the
[2:19] beginning, may it be turned around,
[2:22] Father, may it be a great great blessing
[2:26] to the people. We pray. Grant, Lord, in
[2:30] Jesus name we ask it. Amen. Amen. God
[2:34] bless you all. You can be seated.
[2:41] I uh
[2:45] tell you,
[2:48] we always want to be obedient
[2:51] to the Lord.
[2:53] And uh I'm just I'm grateful I'm
[2:55] grateful to be here and and I know that
[2:58] if it's my will, if if I'm trying to
[3:01] preach my message or if I'm trying to to
[3:03] have my service or implement my will,
[3:07] then it's going to fail. But if we can
[3:10] just get into that channel of God
[3:13] to where we can just surrender ourselves
[3:15] and we can just be obedient to the
[3:18] spirit speaking and get ourselves out of
[3:22] the way. That's the hardest thing in the
[3:25] world
[3:26] is to get ourselves out of the way. The
[3:29] biggest enemy that I have on earth right
[3:31] now is Daniel Evans senior. This guy
[3:36] right here. And I feel like if we can
[3:39] just get
[3:41] just have that same spirit that the son
[3:44] of God had had where he just set himself
[3:48] aside
[3:49] and he said, "I always do that which
[3:50] pleases my father. Lord, if I could just
[3:53] have that,
[3:54] it's the desire of my heart and I I
[3:57] believe that the Lord will give us the
[3:58] desires of our hearts."
[4:00] I want to welcome our visitors this
[4:03] morning. There's quite a few. I won't
[4:04] recognize everybody, the Bates family.
[4:07] God, God bless you all. Welcome. Where'd
[4:10] you go?
[4:11] Where'd they go? Oh, there you are.
[4:13] Right there behind brother behind the
[4:15] next visitor, brother Trevor. Brother
[4:17] Trevor, did you appreciate Brother
[4:19] Trevor's song this morning?
[4:23] And really and all and all the songs.
[4:26] Um,
[4:28] when I was back there praying,
[4:30] we've been going through the book of 1
[4:32] Samuel.
[4:34] Um, we went through it on Wednesday
[4:35] night and when Saul would get nervous
[4:39] and he'd get this bad spirit on him,
[4:41] he'd invite this young man named David
[4:44] in
[4:45] to play music and it would send away
[4:48] those spirits that were tormenting Saul
[4:51] the king. And not to compare myself, I
[4:55] pray with Saul, but I'll tell you what,
[4:58] when Sister Jessica sang that song,
[5:01] just a peace came over me.
[5:04] and came come out and have brother
[5:06] Josiah
[5:07] there singing. I'm just I'm just just
[5:10] grateful um how music what a blessing
[5:13] that music is to us. I um have a friend
[5:17] here and we heard him sing, brother Trev
[5:20] Trevor Eman. He's a minister of the
[5:23] gospel. He's also a good friend, an old
[5:26] friend. Brother Trevor,
[5:30] God has placed him in my path.
[5:34] Um,
[5:35] over the years, and when I got my call
[5:39] to the ministry years ago, um, Brother
[5:43] Trevor was the one that
[5:47] I believe the Lord told me to fellowship
[5:50] with him. And we were already friends,
[5:52] but the Lord wanted us to be closer
[5:54] friends. I'm going to ask brother Trevor
[5:56] to come up and say a few words to the
[5:58] congregation. He's a beloved friend. His
[6:01] family is there in Jeffersonville.
[6:04] He's uh he's got some great kids. He's
[6:06] got a great wife. Um and and they're
[6:08] just they're they're old friends. So,
[6:11] Brother Trevor, if you would say a few
[6:14] words to the congregation, we'd really
[6:16] appreciate it. Thank you, my brother.
[6:17] Bless you.
[6:19] And God bless you this morning. I won't
[6:22] be one of those that says a few words in
[6:24] an hour and a half.
[6:27] Not not not happening. But do just want
[6:28] to read a scripture um to you. But I I
[6:32] do want to just say it's wonderful to be
[6:34] here. Um I think the last time I I stood
[6:37] behind this pulpit was about 2010. Um so
[6:40] many many years ago. A lot of water
[6:42] under the bridge since then. And um but
[6:44] just happy to be back and in fellowship
[6:46] with you all and have so many new faces
[6:48] here. That's wonderful what the grace of
[6:49] God is doing in your midst. Amen.
[6:52] Amen.
[6:53] So on that note of the grace of God in
[6:55] your midst, Acts chap 11 and verse 23.
[6:59] And this is just the verse that I
[7:01] believe God has has given to me for my
[7:04] ministry. And so if I have a few minutes
[7:06] to say something, well then this is the
[7:08] few minutes I'm going to say.
[7:10] Amen.
[7:10] Amen. So
[7:13] um and it says uh verse 22, these the
[7:16] tidings of these things came into the
[7:18] ears of the church which is at
[7:20] Jerusalem. They sent forth Barnabas that
[7:22] he should go as far as Antioch who when
[7:25] he came and had seen the grace of God
[7:28] was glad and exhorted them all that with
[7:30] purpose of heart they would cleave unto
[7:33] the Lord. And so if I could say anything
[7:36] to you, I would say if the grace of God,
[7:39] and we believe that it is, the grace of
[7:40] God is among you. Um, he sent you a a
[7:44] wonderful uh friend of mine here as as
[7:46] your pastor um after many years and and
[7:49] so the grace of God is here and you have
[7:52] fine people for musicians and
[7:54] you know the different things and and
[7:56] and the Lord can really use this.
[7:58] Amen.
[7:58] To be a blessing to your hearts. But if
[8:01] but but then what is your response? The
[8:03] grace of God is amongst you. So I would
[8:05] just say with purpose of heart, cleave
[8:08] to the Lord. Don't just let the Lord
[8:10] come along and hit you.
[8:11] Yeah.
[8:12] Those are those are the hard times.
[8:14] You know, when God wants you and you're
[8:16] not uh you're not responding, oh, those
[8:19] are some trying times. I I I learned
[8:21] real early on, Lord, if you want me to
[8:22] be a minister, I'll just, you know,
[8:24] running is running hasn't worked too
[8:26] well for those that you've called in the
[8:28] ministry.
[8:29] But just even in our personal lives,
[8:31] don't run from the Lord with purpose of
[8:33] heart. Cleave to him. You know, if if
[8:35] our brother's going to preach on
[8:37] obedience this morning, you know,
[8:38] obedience is oh, not something we all
[8:41] just love to do, right? That's not a
[8:44] that's not just the oh yeah, I can't
[8:45] wait to obey the law. Especially when it
[8:48] says speed limit 55, like just a sign me
[8:52] up to obey that one. Like obedience
[8:54] isn't exactly natural to us. It's not
[8:57] exactly something, but but if we can
[8:59] recognize that it's not just some
[9:01] bureaucrat who made the sign 55, but
[9:04] this is God Almighty.
[9:06] This is our Lord Jesus Christ who poured
[9:08] himself out to us in love and grace and
[9:11] mercy. And if it's he and his character
[9:14] that's pulling us and drawing us into
[9:16] obedience, then then what what better
[9:18] thing could we possibly do? So, I would
[9:21] just say that that that have a purpose
[9:23] in your heart today. decide to to live
[9:27] your life in such a way that Lord your
[9:28] grace is upon me. May I may I may I have
[9:32] purpose. You know, we're all longing for
[9:34] purpose and and in this day they the
[9:36] culture tries to just take away every
[9:38] purpose of of everything. I mean the
[9:40] purpose of man, purpose of woman. We
[9:41] don't even know what those things are
[9:43] anymore and that the culture tries to
[9:44] take it all away from us. But God gives
[9:46] us purpose, great purpose that that we
[9:49] can feel like there's I I have a part to
[9:52] play in this and you do. And so I would
[9:54] say friends, God bless you with purpose
[9:57] of heart. Cleave to the Lord Jesus.
[10:00] Amen.
[10:07] Funny he should say that.
[10:09] It's pretty much what my sermon's about
[10:11] today is what brother Trevor so
[10:12] eloquently said in two minutes. Well,
[10:14] it's going to take me an hour probably
[10:15] to say.
[10:18] I um I do appreciate I appreciate
[10:20] brother Trevor. Brother Trevor and I
[10:21] were talking a couple days ago and he
[10:26] was he was telling me some testimonies
[10:28] and and brother Trevor and I we have a
[10:30] relationship where where we talk about
[10:32] the deeper things and we can run things
[10:35] by each other and we may not agree on
[10:38] everything but we sure love each other
[10:41] and it's really nice having someone that
[10:44] you can talk to like brother Trevor who
[10:47] is a solid minister of the gospel that
[10:50] He is going, he knows this word as well
[10:52] as I do and we can talk about these
[10:55] things and he can say what about this
[10:56] and I can say what about that and then
[10:58] we can come together and reason many of
[11:02] these things out and I think it's
[11:04] helpful to both of us. Brother Trevor
[11:05] was he came here and he told me kind of
[11:08] the same way that our service our church
[11:13] went this morning where he had something
[11:15] in his mind that he was going to do and
[11:20] he had it in his mind that well I'll
[11:22] probably preach here and here and I'm
[11:24] going to have these sermons ready. And
[11:26] then when he got here it didn't work out
[11:29] that way. And brother Trevor and now
[11:31] he's back. I'm going to stop talking
[11:33] about him. But when when brother Trevor
[11:37] when he said
[11:39] that when he got here it didn't work out
[11:42] the way that he had it in his mind that
[11:44] it was going to be but that the Lord
[11:47] took him and he used him in a different
[11:51] way than what he thought.
[11:54] And it wasn't in a way that we might
[11:56] think.
[11:58] But in brother Trevor's obedience,
[12:02] he didn't try to make it work. He didn't
[12:05] try to make it happen what he thought
[12:08] that his trip to to Arizona should
[12:10] produce. And the what had happened was
[12:14] God used him in probably a much greater
[12:17] way
[12:18] than if it would have gone the way that
[12:20] brother Trevor wanted it to go. And it's
[12:23] the same with all of us.
[12:26] We have in our mind how church should
[12:28] go. We have in our mind
[12:31] how
[12:33] the Lord should use us.
[12:36] But most of the time, if not every time,
[12:39] it's not the way that we think.
[12:42] And if you know your Bible, then you
[12:45] know that that's the way
[12:48] that it happens with most of God's
[12:50] servants. we've been going through and
[12:51] I'm going to get to David and Saul at
[12:53] the end. But David would have never
[12:56] thought being the least,
[12:59] being the youngest, smallest probably of
[13:02] his whole family and poor, didn't have a
[13:05] lot of money that he would one day be
[13:08] king
[13:10] of the greatest country in the world.
[13:13] And it's with all of us. But David David
[13:16] humbled himself before the Lord. I um
[13:21] we had a nice time last weekend for
[13:23] those that went to um Los Cusus, New
[13:27] Mexico. It was it was just it was a real
[13:30] blessing to be there and I was so proud
[13:33] of the group that we brought with us and
[13:35] the talent that we had not only on the
[13:39] um in the in singing praises and the
[13:43] specials that we sang. We showed talent
[13:46] there, but we also showed talent on the
[13:48] basketball court.
[13:51] And and I was proud of that, too. And uh
[13:56] Me, too.
[13:57] Yeah, I was making it, man. I scored
[13:59] like half our team's points.
[14:01] It was great. Um well, maybe not half. I
[14:04] exaggerate. It's like when I go fishing,
[14:05] things get bigger. Um and and uh but I
[14:09] did score and I I scored a couple times,
[14:12] but it was a lot of fun. We we enjoyed
[14:15] our our trip there and I gave a
[14:18] testimony that while while I was there
[14:19] that I've often given about a t a man
[14:22] that I know, an old man that I met years
[14:25] ago named Tom Jennings and I've told
[14:27] this church how Tom back in the 1940s
[14:30] his dad was a trustee in the Assembly of
[14:34] God church and the pastor
[14:38] was um
[14:40] the the pastor his wife was dying of
[14:42] cancer. Well, William Brandham was
[14:44] having meetings there in Florida where
[14:47] they were and then the assembly of God
[14:49] was jealous of this evangelist coming
[14:52] through, this healing evangelist, and
[14:54] they told the people that you are not to
[14:56] go over to hear this man preach or you
[14:59] will be excommunicated. You'll be kicked
[15:01] out of the church. The pastor, of
[15:03] course, his wife um was sick. He felt
[15:06] like he couldn't go. So, he was
[15:08] basically allowing his wife to die
[15:11] while being part of this church.
[15:15] And I've I've gave that testimony
[15:17] before. His his wife ends up getting
[15:20] healed. And while they were in the
[15:22] prayer line, the pastor um the uh
[15:27] brother Brandham calls him out from
[15:29] behind him and he says the the woman
[15:32] with cancer's there and he says, "You
[15:34] have cancer." And he says, "Let me tell
[15:35] you something that no one knows." He
[15:37] says, "Your husband behind me is a
[15:39] minister and he has cancer. No one knows
[15:42] he has cancer, but he has cancer of the
[15:43] mouth." He brought them to um the
[15:47] platform. They both were healed. I
[15:51] didn't I've never given this part of the
[15:53] testimony before.
[15:55] And it shows how God requires obedience.
[15:59] This isn't
[16:01] really even um I'm trying to be obedient
[16:04] to the Lord. It's not really in my
[16:06] sermon today, but I think it goes along
[16:08] well. And while they were at those
[16:11] meetings, this is, like I said, late
[16:13] 40s. While they were at those meetings,
[16:16] Tom Jennings was there. He's a young
[16:18] man, and he watched a woman bring up two
[16:23] what's called a waterhead baby. These
[16:25] waterhead babies, they they don't see
[16:28] you don't see them as much today because
[16:29] there's not as much trauma in the womb.
[16:32] There's a lot better medicine today that
[16:33] can prevent this. But what had happened
[16:36] was that there was these two twins that
[16:39] came up and it was a very serious
[16:41] situation. These these children, these
[16:44] babies had these giant heads
[16:48] and they brought them up before
[16:52] brother Brandham and brother Brandham
[16:54] and the gift that he had and the
[16:55] discernment.
[16:57] They bring him up there
[17:00] and the the woman brings him up and he
[17:02] says, "You sister,"
[17:05] he says, "Are you their parents?"
[17:08] She says, "No, I'm not." And what had
[17:11] happened was the parents didn't want to
[17:12] bring the child up, the children up.
[17:16] So they had their friend
[17:18] bring her bring the kids. So So he says,
[17:21] "Brother Bam says, I want to see the
[17:23] parents."
[17:25] And they were there in the service
[17:27] sitting somewhere else. The young men,
[17:29] the young man, the young lady, they come
[17:31] up and they stand with their child
[17:33] there. And he says, he says, "You're the
[17:36] parents of these two children." They
[17:39] said, "Yes." And he says, "You're not
[17:42] married."
[17:44] And they said, "No, we're not."
[17:48] And he says, "If you want these children
[17:51] to be married, to be healed, then go and
[17:54] get married."
[17:56] That day after the service was over,
[18:00] that day the two parents stayed. Tom
[18:03] Jennings is a witness. He saw it happen.
[18:05] The two parents stayed. They had a the
[18:08] whoever the pastor was had a ceremony,
[18:12] married the husband and the wife and Tom
[18:16] said immediately immediately
[18:19] those two children were healed.
[18:21] Those two babies infants were healed.
[18:24] Amen.
[18:27] And it it shows that God required an
[18:31] obedience
[18:32] with these this couple that was there.
[18:35] Yeah,
[18:35] he, you know, we do things in the past
[18:37] and we've all made mistakes and things
[18:39] that doesn't matter. But what matters is
[18:41] what we're doing right now. He required
[18:43] that obedience. And imagine us, you and
[18:47] me, if we have if we have a job
[18:50] and we go to work and we tell the boss,
[18:54] you know, I'm not I'm not going to do
[18:55] that today.
[18:57] The boss is going to say, oh, you're
[18:59] not. No, you know, I just I'm not going
[19:01] to do I'm not going to do my job today.
[19:03] I um I don't feel like it.
[19:06] And your boss would say, "Well, okay."
[19:09] And that might last for a couple days,
[19:11] but you're gonna be out of a job here
[19:13] really soon.
[19:15] We wouldn't ever We wouldn't do that to
[19:17] our boss.
[19:19] But yet, we will do it to God himself.
[19:22] We will go before the Lord and say, you
[19:25] know, all of this stuff that uh that
[19:29] that you know is required of me, you
[19:30] know, I'm not I'm not going to do it.
[19:33] come to come to maybe come to the pastor
[19:36] and say, you know, pastor, I really
[19:37] appreciate your your service and I
[19:39] really like how you tell stories about
[19:40] the Bible. You know, you're really good
[19:41] about that. Good at that. And boy, it's
[19:43] really exciting, but you know, but when
[19:45] you're talking about some of this other
[19:46] stuff, you know, um why don't can you
[19:48] just stick to salvation? I don't want to
[19:50] go too far. You know, I I just I I don't
[19:53] you know, if there is a hell, I don't
[19:54] want to go to hell, but but then I I
[19:56] don't want to go all the way.
[20:00] I'll do it eventually.
[20:02] Oh my.
[20:03] And that's how that's how we hear it so
[20:05] often. You know, eventually one day I'm
[20:08] going to do it. One day I'm going to
[20:09] stop sleeping with my girlfriend. One
[20:12] day I'm going to stop looking at
[20:13] pornography. One day I'll eventually
[20:15] forgive this person
[20:17] that has done me wrong. One day
[20:20] when I'm ready, I'll do it. So what
[20:23] you're saying is you're going to do it
[20:25] under your terms
[20:28] and not under God's terms. You wouldn't
[20:29] treat your boss that way.
[20:32] And how much greater
[20:33] is our Lord Jesus Christ
[20:36] than our boss.
[20:39] I
[20:39] was talking with really had a nice time
[20:42] when we went to um Los Cusus and came
[20:46] back and I had a nice time with brother
[20:47] Josiah, sister Katie, my wife and I did
[20:50] good windshield time. You know, it's
[20:52] fun. It's fun to travel and you can talk
[20:53] about things and and one of the things I
[20:55] told brother Josiah is they just moved
[20:58] down here and I told him I said listen I
[21:00] said don't come to this Tucson
[21:02] tabernacle
[21:03] to enjoy a sermon telling you how much
[21:06] better you are than the rest of the
[21:08] world. Don't come here
[21:11] to say I'm the elect. I'm the bride. I'm
[21:14] the elite elite and we're just waiting
[21:16] waiting for the rapture to get out of
[21:18] this sinful w world. This is not the
[21:21] place for that. If you come to this
[21:23] church, this Tucson Tabernacle is a
[21:27] ministry.
[21:29] It is your ministry,
[21:32] brothers and sisters. And you might have
[21:34] to do things that you're uncomfortable
[21:35] in doing,
[21:37] but this church is to win souls.
[21:41] This church is to bring people to the
[21:45] Lord Jesus. And brother Trevor and I
[21:47] were talking and we were talking about
[21:49] building a church and how you get the
[21:52] people in, you you bring them in. But
[21:54] there must be another step
[21:58] and we think
[22:00] that other step is conforming.
[22:05] But listen,
[22:07] that next step, the Lord Jesus told us
[22:09] what that next step is. The way you grow
[22:12] in the Lord is to be more obedient to
[22:15] him. and he commissioned us to go into
[22:18] the world and to make disciples to
[22:21] Christ.
[22:23] And if we're not doing that, then we are
[22:26] not growing anymore. We stopped. Brother
[22:28] Brandham taught us that there is this
[22:30] three-step process. There's
[22:32] justification.
[22:34] You've been forgiving of your forgiven
[22:36] of your sins. You've come to the waters
[22:38] of baptism to show the whole world how
[22:40] you've repented and you've made a change
[22:42] in your life.
[22:45] first step and then there's
[22:47] sanctification. You overcome your
[22:49] sinning and the bad habits that hinder
[22:51] your walk with the Lord. But then there
[22:54] is a third step and that is the baptism
[22:56] of the Holy Spirit. We stop at the
[22:58] second step. Most most
[23:02] of the time
[23:04] we stop at that second step and say,
[23:05] "Oh, I'm sanctified. I have it. I'm
[23:08] bride. I'm great. I just want to sit
[23:11] back and just relish in my goodness.
[23:15] That is not the case.
[23:18] Then you have the baptism of the Holy
[23:20] Spirit. Then once you are once you have
[23:23] that, then you are set aside for service
[23:28] of the Lord.
[23:31] You have a work to do now. Yes.
[23:35] And that work. The Lord Jesus said, "Go
[23:37] out and make disciples of Christ.
[23:42] But there's a lot that goes with that.
[23:45] And it's, believe me, it's not just
[23:46] coming to church and enjoy a sermon. Oh
[23:49] boy, I really felt condemned on that."
[23:50] Well, well, what good did it do if you
[23:53] really felt condemned? Did you make a
[23:54] change?
[23:55] Are you doing something? Are are you
[23:58] winning souls? Are do you have a purpose
[24:00] in life? That purpose in life is not
[24:02] just to be a good person. That purpose
[24:04] in life is not to quit smoking, quit
[24:06] drinking, quit quit run running around,
[24:08] quit, as I said, quit doing those other
[24:10] things. That's not your purpose in life.
[24:13] Those are just it's not what you, as
[24:15] I've said many times, it's not what you
[24:17] don't do for God that matters.
[24:19] It's what you do for God. Amen.
[24:22] You can always make yourself better and
[24:24] you can always stop doing things. But
[24:26] when you stop doing something and you
[24:29] take that part out of your life now, it
[24:31] creates a void right there. And that
[24:34] void has to be filled with something.
[24:36] You got to fill it with service of God.
[24:39] You got to fill it with the Holy Spirit
[24:40] because if that void stays there, the
[24:43] enemy is going to come right back in and
[24:44] fill it up worse than it was before.
[24:47] So you say, "I stopped doing this."
[24:52] Okay, that's good. Praise the Lord. But
[24:54] what did you start doing to replace
[24:55] that? And that is the true church of
[24:58] God.
[25:00] One of those things, let's turn to
[25:01] Matthew chapter 18.
[25:07] Listen to this. This is great. This is a
[25:10] This is a story about how the Lord Jesus
[25:12] was teaching. He he was teaching his
[25:15] disciples and he's teaching people and
[25:17] he tells them about when you have
[25:19] something against someone else.
[25:22] Matthew chapter 8 18 verse1 15 says
[25:25] this. Moreover, if thy brother shall
[25:27] trespass against thee, go and tell him
[25:30] his fault between thee and him alone.
[25:35] We can stop right there and we can say
[25:37] everyone in this room is guilty of not
[25:39] doing that.
[25:41] If someone has done you wrong, if
[25:44] there's something in your heart against
[25:46] someone,
[25:48] don't tell anyone, go to that person.
[25:51] Commanded by not just a prophet, but God
[25:55] himself in flesh.
[25:57] I mean, the prophets messages obviously
[25:59] we believe are also from God, but this
[26:01] is from Jesus. Go and tell him his fault
[26:04] between thee and him alone. And if he
[26:05] shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
[26:08] brother.
[26:10] But if you will not hear thee, then take
[26:12] with thee one or two more that in the
[26:15] mouth of two or three witnesses every
[26:17] word may be established. He didn't say
[26:18] go tell your friends and go tell the
[26:19] people of the church and start start
[26:21] bickering among other. He didn't say any
[26:22] of that. He said just take now one
[26:24] person and go. And if he shall neglect
[26:26] to hear them, tell it to the church. But
[26:29] if it be neglect but if he neglect to
[26:31] hear the church, let him be unto thee as
[26:34] a heathen heathen man and a publican.
[26:36] Verily I say unto you, whatsoever you
[26:38] shall bind on earth
[26:41] shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever
[26:43] you shall l loose on earth shall be
[26:45] loosed in heaven. Brother Trevor, right
[26:47] after he said that,
[26:50] then he raises these stakes all the way
[26:53] here.
[26:55] And he says, oh,
[26:58] he says, if you bind it on earth, God
[27:01] will bind it in heaven. If you loose it
[27:03] on earth, he'll loosen it in heaven.
[27:04] What a great authority that he has given
[27:08] to the people. But he qualified it with
[27:10] just that one little thing about don't
[27:11] fight,
[27:13] don't bicker. And again, I say unto you
[27:15] that if two of you shall agree on earth
[27:17] as touching anything. If you agree on
[27:19] anything
[27:21] that they shall ask, it shall be done
[27:24] for them of my father which is in
[27:26] heaven. If just two of us will agree on
[27:30] asking anything from the father, then
[27:32] you will be given it. Look at what
[27:34] obedience does. If we will just be
[27:37] obedient to God's word, do what he said.
[27:41] Then look what it produces. Whatever you
[27:44] will ask.
[27:46] We live so below.
[27:48] We live so below our callings. We live
[27:50] so below these promises.
[27:53] And where two or three are gathered in
[27:55] my name, there I am in the midst.
[27:57] Imagine if we really believed that.
[27:59] Wow. If we really believed, if there was
[28:02] really two or three people here that are
[28:03] really gathered in the name of Jesus
[28:05] Christ according to his word, that he
[28:08] would be here.
[28:10] We say it all the time,
[28:13] but imagine if he was really here.
[28:17] Imagine if Jesus Christ was standing
[28:19] right here. I'd rather him be standing
[28:21] right here.
[28:24] Imagine he if if he was actually here,
[28:26] but yet it's a promise.
[28:27] That's right. that if two or three are
[28:29] gathered in my name, I will be there.
[28:32] Don't just say it.
[28:34] We believe it. Lord, you're here.
[28:38] I'm going to ask you. It says right
[28:40] here. If Brother Hano and I, if you and
[28:45] me, if we're together in this and you
[28:47] and I ask, it'll be done.
[28:50] Imagine if we really actually believe
[28:52] that.
[28:55] Now,
[28:57] I think Peter
[29:00] was just thinking about the first part
[29:02] of the sermon about this.
[29:06] Don't tell anybody. He'd missed the
[29:08] whole part about if I'm if anyone's
[29:11] gathered in my name there, I'm in the
[29:12] midst. If you ask anything, I'll do it.
[29:14] And all this. And Peter, he's like,
[29:16] "Well, what wait a minute?"
[29:20] And Peter came to him and said, "Lord,
[29:24] how
[29:27] Lord, how oft
[29:30] shall my brother sin against me and I
[29:32] forgive him till seven times?
[29:36] Bro, you missed the whole thing. You
[29:39] miss the big things. And Peter's here
[29:41] stuck. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. To
[29:43] have all this. And Peter with the
[29:44] revelation sees, whoa, I got to be
[29:46] obedient to God first
[29:48] before I can have these promises.
[29:52] And Jesus, he said, "How often shall my
[29:55] brother sin against me and I forgive him
[29:56] till seven times? Do you want me to
[29:58] forgive him seven times? Do you want him
[30:01] just keep sinning against me and I have
[30:02] to forgive him seven times?" Jesus said
[30:04] unto him, I say, "Not unto these until
[30:07] seven times, but until 70 times seven
[30:10] over and over and over again, we have to
[30:14] forgive those that do something against
[30:16] us." And yet, how many of us really do
[30:18] it? and we wonder why
[30:23] that we pray and we ask and it doesn't
[30:26] happen.
[30:29] We have to be obedient. One of the
[30:32] greatest obedience people was this man
[30:34] named Abraham
[30:36] back in the Old Testament. Abraham that
[30:39] really no one was God was not speaking
[30:42] to people. And this man Abraham was
[30:46] really he changed everything when God
[30:49] makes this covenant with this man
[30:52] Abraham. And God tells Abraham,
[30:56] he wants to show his obedience.
[30:59] So Abraham couldn't have children.
[31:01] Abraham and Sarah couldn't have
[31:02] children. God gives them a miracle. They
[31:04] have this son named Isaac.
[31:08] They're so happy.
[31:11] so happy that God had given this
[31:14] promised son to them. And then God comes
[31:17] to Abraham and he says, "Take your son
[31:22] and take him up on Mount Mariah
[31:26] and there build an altar to me.
[31:30] Take wood.
[31:34] Lay your son
[31:37] who you love."
[31:39] Yeah. on this altar
[31:42] and sacrifice him to me.
[31:45] Whoa.
[31:47] Obedience.
[31:49] How many of us
[31:52] would do that? Now, God did not require
[31:55] a human sacrifice back then,
[31:59] but he made Abraham go right to the
[32:01] place. Abraham goes up there. Here's
[32:04] young Isaac, and imagine his obedience.
[32:08] Isaac, they get this. They get the the
[32:10] bundle of wood.
[32:12] Isaac carried it himself.
[32:17] Imagine Jesus Christ carrying the cross.
[32:19] Yes.
[32:19] Where he was going to be sacrificed. And
[32:21] this time, God was not going to stop it.
[32:24] There's Isaac. He comes up.
[32:27] He says, "Father,
[32:31] uh, there's no sacrifice."
[32:35] They build the altar,
[32:37] lay Isaac down.
[32:40] God's watching all of this. Every angel
[32:43] in heaven is probably watching.
[32:48] In obedience to God, Abraham raises his
[32:51] hand with this knife.
[32:53] And then the angel of the Lord says,
[32:55] "Stop Abraham.
[32:57] Now I know you love me." He was going to
[32:59] do it.
[33:00] Now I know that you love me.
[33:06] Genesis
[33:08] chapter 22:3 says this, "And Abraham
[33:12] lifted up his eyes and looked, and
[33:15] behold, behind him a ram caught in a
[33:16] thicket by his thorns. And Abraham went
[33:19] and took the ram and offered him up for
[33:20] a burnt offering in thestead of his
[33:22] son." And Abraham called the name of
[33:24] that place Jehovah Gyra. God will
[33:27] provide himself
[33:28] a sacrifice. As it is said to this day,
[33:31] in the mount of the Lord, it shall be
[33:33] seen. And the angel of the Lord called
[33:35] unto Abraham out of the heaven a second
[33:36] time, and said, By myself I have sworn,
[33:39] sayeth the Lord, but for because thou
[33:42] hast done this thing, and hast not
[33:44] withheld thy son, thine only son.
[33:49] Abraham
[33:51] had the spirit of God on him. God didn't
[33:55] withhold his only son either,
[33:57] right? that in blessing I will bless
[33:59] thee, and multiplying I will multiply
[34:02] thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as
[34:04] the sand which is upon the seashore, and
[34:06] thy seed shall possess the gate of his
[34:08] enemies. And in thy seed shall all the
[34:11] nations of the earth be blessed, because
[34:13] thou hast obeyed my voice.
[34:16] The obedience of one man blessed the
[34:19] entire world. And we are receiving still
[34:20] receiving those blessings 4,000 years
[34:22] later.
[34:25] So what happened on that day had on
[34:27] Mount Mariah had such significance that
[34:30] that is the place that Solomon built the
[34:33] temple of the first temple of God
[34:36] and that's the place that's promised
[34:38] according to my understanding that
[34:41] another temple will one day be built
[34:43] there
[34:44] in that same place that same place where
[34:47] Abraham was going to sacrifice his son.
[34:52] But we see obedience, but we also see
[34:55] the children of disobedience. Rebellion
[34:57] is all over the Bible. We just went
[34:59] through the book of Judges and we saw
[35:01] where every man did that which was right
[35:02] in his own eyes that did that what they
[35:05] thought were right and it wasn't
[35:07] following God. He was serving
[35:08] themselves. And Satan thrives in
[35:12] rebellion against God. He loves it
[35:15] and he just keeps it going.
[35:19] Rebellion
[35:20] landed Satan in hell. Isaiah chapter 14.
[35:26] Listen to this. Verse 12.
[35:31] How art thou fallen from heaven. Oh
[35:35] Lucifer, son of the morning, how art
[35:39] thou cut down to the ground which didest
[35:41] weaken the nations? How does he how does
[35:44] he weaken the nations? He weakens the
[35:46] nations with a selfish attitude among
[35:49] the people. And it's the attitude that
[35:51] we see in our country today.
[35:53] We will destroy this country for votes.
[35:58] Wow.
[35:58] We'll take out of the pockets of
[35:59] hardworking Americans and we'll put it
[36:01] in the people who refuse to work so they
[36:04] can stay in power.
[36:08] If you want something, go to the store
[36:11] and take it.
[36:12] You're entitled to it.
[36:15] And what f and what follows? Sin and
[36:18] drugs and perversion and crime. And they
[36:22] and many times it says, you know what?
[36:24] I'm not ready to serve him now. I'm
[36:27] going to continue on serving myself.
[36:30] Wow.
[36:30] And there is Satan.
[36:33] By doing this, they come into obedience,
[36:36] not of God, but of the spirit of someone
[36:39] else.
[36:41] We see that spirit, friends, in the
[36:42] churches today. Many times we see the
[36:45] pastors, they preach a narrative that
[36:48] whatever sect they're preaching to,
[36:50] whatever the megaurch movement or the
[36:52] Baptist or what we call the message,
[36:54] what because whatever they want, they
[36:58] want to build their own popularity.
[37:01] They want to build their own influence.
[37:05] They want to build their own ministry.
[37:07] And it's about themselves.
[37:10] And we see that they may be successful,
[37:14] but it's not God's way.
[37:18] Let
[37:18] me go back to Isaiah 14:12 and read it
[37:20] again. How art thou fallen from heaven,
[37:22] oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art
[37:23] thou cut down to the ground which did
[37:25] weaken the nations? For thou hast said
[37:28] in thine heart, I
[37:30] will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[37:36] throne above the stars of God. I will
[37:40] sit also upon the mount of the
[37:42] congregation in the sides of the north.
[37:44] I will ascend above the heights of the
[37:47] clouds. I will be like the most high.
[37:50] Wow.
[37:51] Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[37:54] to the sides of the pit. I guess there's
[37:56] probably many churches that aren't
[37:58] really allowed to preach hell, but it's
[37:59] all over the Bible. There is a
[38:00] punishment for sin, and it's my job to
[38:04] say stay away from that.
[38:06] You don't want to go there. Serving
[38:09] yourself will bring sorrow.
[38:13] It'll bring sin. It'll make your life
[38:16] worse. I promise you. It may be a little
[38:19] bit of instant gratification. Maybe not
[38:22] paying for something or whatever. You
[38:23] you get to keep that money in your
[38:25] wallet, but you will suffer for it later
[38:27] if you are a child of God.
[38:32] Satan's saying, "You have no control
[38:34] over me.
[38:35] I'm not coming under your leadership.
[38:37] I'm not following your laws.
[38:41] God responds, "Oh, yes, you are." God
[38:43] created hell and Satan. I mean, hell for
[38:46] Satan and his demons.
[38:48] The spirit of Satan is, I won't be
[38:50] controlled. I will be not to in
[38:54] obedience to anyone, to any God. I'm not
[38:58] talking about
[39:00] I'm not talking about me or the pastor
[39:02] of this church. you wouldn't do it
[39:05] anyways.
[39:06] I'm talking about God and God's word.
[39:10] That's the main thing. You need to have
[39:12] that relationship with the Lord. Now, we
[39:16] see the disobedience of Satan wanting to
[39:18] serve himself. Now, let's look at the
[39:20] obedience of Jesus Christ. St. John 12
[39:23] 4049 Jesus says this. He says,"For I
[39:26] have not spoken of myself, but the
[39:29] Father which sent me, he gave me the
[39:31] commandment what I should say and what I
[39:34] should speak,
[39:36] and I know that his commandment is life
[39:38] everlasting. Whosoever I whatsoever I
[39:41] speak, therefore, even as the father
[39:44] said unto me, so I speak." So, he's
[39:47] saying that I don't even have my own
[39:48] words. This is Jesus. I don't even have
[39:51] my own words. I'm so obedient to God
[39:53] that what he tells me, that's what I
[39:55] say. St. John 5:1 18.
[39:59] Therefore, the Jews sought the more to
[40:01] kill him because he not only broken the
[40:04] Sabbath, but said also that God was his
[40:07] father, making himself equal with God.
[40:10] Exactly what Lucifer tried to do is
[40:14] exactly what they were accusing Jesus,
[40:15] the Pharisees were accusing Jesus of.
[40:18] They knew the scriptures. But by being
[40:21] so obedient to God, this man Jesus
[40:25] Christ became God.
[40:27] Then answered Jesus and said unto them,
[40:29] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son
[40:31] can do nothing of himself.
[40:35] Nothing by himself, but what he seeth
[40:38] the Father do. For what things soever he
[40:40] doeth, these also doeth the Son
[40:43] likewise." Verse 30. Let's skip to verse
[40:46] 30, please.
[40:48] I can of mine own self do nothing. This
[40:50] is Jesus talking.
[40:52] The greatest, most powerful man that had
[40:54] ever stepped on the earth.
[40:56] I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I
[41:01] judge, and my judgment is just, because
[41:03] I seek not my own will, but the will of
[41:05] the Father which has sent me. If I bear
[41:08] witness of myself, my witness is not
[41:10] true.
[41:12] If I'm telling you how great I am, then
[41:14] don't believe me. If I'm telling you how
[41:16] many miracles I've done or how many
[41:18] people I've led to the Lord or how great
[41:19] my ministry is, then don't believe me.
[41:23] If I do that, then my witness is not
[41:24] true. My witness is of myself and not
[41:27] the father.
[41:28] There is another that beareth witness of
[41:30] me and I know that the witness which he
[41:34] witnesses
[41:35] of me is true. He's speaking of the
[41:37] father.
[41:39] In another place he says that he always
[41:42] Jesus says that I always do that which
[41:44] pleases my father.
[41:47] That's why he was able brothers and
[41:49] sisters to do as much as he did. We will
[41:52] never attain
[41:54] the level that Jesus was but we can sure
[41:56] try
[41:58] and we can do everything that we can to
[42:00] serve God.
[42:03] I was um I want to talk about another
[42:05] young man
[42:07] that was rebellious.
[42:10] Um I was breaking a horse one time. We
[42:13] we were
[42:15] there was a this family that they had
[42:17] adopted these two Mustangs and they're
[42:20] they're littleer horses and they were
[42:22] they were able I was able to kind of
[42:24] manhandle the one and the little Philly
[42:27] she was great. I was she was she was
[42:31] eating out of my hand fairly within the
[42:33] first day and I mean within a couple
[42:36] days I was on her and I was I was trying
[42:39] to she she I won her I won her trust and
[42:43] and she turned out to just be a great
[42:45] horse. Um her name the the two horses
[42:49] named the uh the family named them
[42:51] Georgie and Vernon.
[42:53] So Georgie was great. Very sweet. Very
[42:56] sweet horse. But Vernon was not so much.
[42:59] I want to kill that horse.
[43:02] I couldn't catch him. He would get out
[43:05] in the in the in the uh corral and he
[43:07] would run and run and run for days. I
[43:09] tried to c catch that crazy animal and I
[43:12] couldn't get a hold of him. So I said,
[43:14] "All right, forget it. It's either going
[43:17] to be he's going to die
[43:19] or I'm going to ride him." So he comes.
[43:23] So what I did is I take my rope,
[43:27] my my lasso, and I tie
[43:30] it to the post that I was sitting on of
[43:33] the fence. And I took the other end of
[43:35] it. And here comes Vernon. And he's
[43:37] tearing around and I take my rope and I
[43:41] throw it around. And I caught him
[43:43] perfectly over his head. Tightened it up
[43:46] and I let it go. And Vernon was
[43:48] cruising, man. Full blast. And that rope
[43:51] rope came tight and he jerked back and
[43:55] all four hooves went up in the air and
[43:57] he landed on his back and I thought, "Oh
[43:59] no,
[44:01] I just broke his neck. The horse is
[44:04] dead."
[44:06] He landed on his back
[44:10] and he rolled over,
[44:13] stood up, shaking, was looking at me
[44:18] like, "How in the world did that man
[44:20] sitting on that post
[44:22] just do this to me?"
[44:26] I walked up. I jumped down off the post
[44:28] and Vernon's standing there and he's
[44:30] looking at me. I walked up to him, put
[44:33] my hand on his face,
[44:35] and he just stood still, stroked his his
[44:41] hair on his face, and I said, "Hello,
[44:43] Vernon. I'm the boss."
[44:47] And from that moment on, Vernon
[44:50] respected me. And we we de we developed
[44:54] this really nice relationship and he
[44:56] ended up being a wonderful horse, really
[44:59] good. and they could put the kids on
[45:00] these horses and and they just turned
[45:02] out great animals. And the family was so
[45:05] happy. And it goes to show that
[45:08] sometimes God, we will be running
[45:11] around, running away from God. And
[45:13] sometimes God will say, "I've had enough
[45:15] of it." Throw his rope around us and
[45:17] we'll find ourselves on our back.
[45:20] We'll find ourselves in prison. We'll
[45:23] find ourselves with no money. We'll find
[45:25] ourselves in the hospital. We're find
[45:27] ourselves completely without God.
[45:31] But it's the kindness and the love of
[45:34] God that does it. Vernon was running
[45:37] around and he you know what? If id have
[45:39] let him go then he would have done
[45:42] nothing in his life.
[45:45] But once I caught him and he realized he
[45:49] became he had a great life. He got all
[45:53] the food that he wanted. He didn't have
[45:54] to worry about out in the desert near
[45:57] Yuma where he grew up trying to find
[45:59] some food and trying to find some water.
[46:00] He grew up in this in this stall in this
[46:03] great place. His family loved him. They
[46:05] they just they he loved them. It was
[46:08] just a nice time for Vernon.
[46:13] But imagine if I would have just let him
[46:14] go. He had a calling in his life,
[46:16] brother Trevor. That horse had a
[46:18] calling,
[46:20] but it needed somebody to yank him.
[46:24] There's a man, a young man in the Bible
[46:29] who's a child of God,
[46:32] had a tremendous gift in his life.
[46:37] And he saw he was studying under the
[46:40] most respected rabbi in the entire
[46:43] country. His name, you know him well,
[46:46] his name was Saul of Tarsus.
[46:50] And he saw he saw that these new people
[46:52] were coming in following this man named
[46:55] Jesus. They didn't look like we looked.
[46:58] They didn't act like we act. They didn't
[47:01] follow this Moses that we believe. They
[47:04] didn't follow this prophet. He's this
[47:06] this man Jesus said, "No, you don't have
[47:09] to honor the Sabbath." Even though
[47:10] that's not what Jesus was saying. That's
[47:13] what they thought. So Paul in his
[47:16] self-righteousness, in his hatred, he
[47:18] gets worked up and he where he wanted to
[47:21] kill these people
[47:23] and he goes and he finds himself on his
[47:26] back just like that horse did
[47:30] with his hooves up in the air.
[47:34] Comes
[47:36] gets prayed for. He he uh loses his
[47:39] eyesight.
[47:41] He's scared to death. And there he is.
[47:45] And then the master
[47:48] comes to him and says something on the
[47:50] order of, "Paul, I'm the boss.
[47:54] You follow me." And it woke this man up.
[47:57] We have his testimony.
[47:59] You want me to read his testimony by his
[48:02] own words?
[48:08] Acts chapter 22:3.
[48:11] Paul is telling what happened.
[48:15] And the Lord got a hold of him. Verse
[48:17] three,
[48:18] he says, "I'm verily a man which I'm a
[48:21] Jew born in Tarsus, a city of Cissia,
[48:24] yet brought up in this city at the feet
[48:26] of Galo,
[48:28] and taught according to the perfect
[48:30] manner of the law of the fathers, and
[48:31] was zealous towards God as you are this
[48:34] day. He's talking to these
[48:36] self-righteous people that think that
[48:38] they've got it. And he's like, Paul
[48:39] says, I said, he says, I get it. I
[48:42] understand the way you think. And I
[48:44] persecuted this way unto death, binding
[48:47] and delivering into prisons both men and
[48:50] women, as also the high priest
[48:54] as head Sadducee,
[48:56] as also the high priest does bear me
[48:58] witness. and all the estate of the
[49:00] elders from whom also I received letters
[49:02] unto the brethren and went to Damascus
[49:05] to bring them which were bound unto
[49:07] Jerusalem for to be punished.
[49:10] Now look at what this man was guilty of.
[49:13] And it came to pass that as I made my
[49:15] journey and was come nigh to Damascus
[49:17] about noon, suddenly there shone from
[49:20] heaven a great light round about me.
[49:22] I'll bet you Vernon saw a light when
[49:24] that rope went tight.
[49:29] I wish you could have seen that. And I
[49:31] fell into the ground, and I heard a
[49:33] voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why
[49:35] persecutest thou me? And I answered, and
[49:36] I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said
[49:38] unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom
[49:40] thou persecutest?
[49:42] And they that were with me saw indeed
[49:45] the light, and were afraid, but they
[49:47] heard not the voice of him that spake to
[49:49] me. And I said, What shall I do, Lord?
[49:52] And he said unto me, "Arise, and go into
[49:54] Damascus, and there it shall be told of
[49:57] thee of all things which are appointed
[49:59] thee to do." And when I could not see,
[50:02] for the glory of the light, being led by
[50:04] the hand of them that were with me, I
[50:06] came to Damascus, and one Ananas, a
[50:08] devout man according to the law, having
[50:10] a good report of all the Jews, dwelt
[50:12] there. And he came to me and stood and
[50:16] said unto me, "Brother Saul, receive thy
[50:19] sight." And the same hour I looked upon
[50:21] him and he said, "The God of our fathers
[50:25] hath chosen thee,
[50:28] chosen you, the most unlikely
[50:32] one, the one that was running and wild
[50:35] and and couldn't be controlled." And he
[50:37] says, "No man's going to tell me what to
[50:39] do. You are going to not only be put in
[50:41] prison, but Paul said, I was consenting
[50:43] to their death,
[50:45] guilty of murder."
[50:47] wild
[50:53] that thou should us know this and we say
[50:56] that just one and should hear the voice
[50:58] of his mouth for thou shalt be his
[51:01] witness unto all men of what thou hast
[51:03] seen and heard and now why terest thou
[51:06] arise and be baptized
[51:09] and wash away thy sins calling on the
[51:12] name of the Lord
[51:15] that wild
[51:16] uncontrollable
[51:18] man
[51:20] God got a hold of.
[51:22] And what Brother Trevor said earlier was
[51:25] perfect. She said, "You don't want to be
[51:26] slapped. You don't want to be hit."
[51:30] Brothers and sisters, if you are a child
[51:32] of God, I promise you. If you want to if
[51:36] if there is something in you, if God is
[51:38] calling out to you and he loves you,
[51:39] he's going to get you.
[51:41] He might put you on your back first. He
[51:44] might cause hardships to come, but he
[51:47] loves you,
[51:48] right?
[51:49] And he wants you to serve him and he
[51:51] wants to bless you.
[51:53] Everybody thinks that serving God is
[51:55] some great burden.
[51:56] Come on.
[51:56] Let me tell you, when I started serving
[51:58] God, all my burdens went away.
[52:00] It was no more. Now I could just trust
[52:02] in him. And I would get in a
[52:04] predicament. I'd say, "Lord, what is
[52:06] going on?" Like this morning, Lord, I've
[52:08] messed up. I wasn't organized enough. I
[52:10] didn't I didn't give enough instructions
[52:12] for all the all of the the um the the
[52:15] board members and the and the leaders. I
[52:16] didn't give them enough instruction. And
[52:18] then I down on my knees and he says,
[52:20] "What's your what's your sermon? Just be
[52:23] obedient to me. I'm in charge, not you."
[52:26] And I thank God. And here is Paul. This
[52:30] man, God had changed him.
[52:33] and then
[52:35] more revelation than anyone else that
[52:38] really had ever lived aside from the
[52:40] Lord Jesus. From this man, Paul
[52:43] wrote most of the New Testament, really
[52:46] set the churches in order. In closing,
[52:51] we went through Wednesday
[52:55] night
[52:56] and came to this man, David.
[52:59] And David
[53:01] just out of the out of the blue, God
[53:03] chooses this man and brings him,
[53:09] the prophet comes to him and anoints him
[53:11] just as a little boy, anoints him king.
[53:14] Yet for decades, he had to he had to
[53:16] know that he was going to be king and
[53:18] yet live under this tyrant named King
[53:20] Saul so much that Saul hated him.
[53:24] Everything David did was blessed. He
[53:27] killed a 10- foot tall giant,
[53:30] little guy with a rock.
[53:33] Killed a lion when it came to get his
[53:35] father's sheep. Won battle after battle
[53:38] after battle. Saul would send him out on
[53:40] suicide missions and he would just win
[53:42] the battle every time. Saul got so sick
[53:44] and tired of this this young man winning
[53:48] that he began to hate him.
[53:51] And one time David was coming back
[53:54] and the women were singing. They were
[53:57] saying, "Saul has killed his thousands
[53:59] and David his 10 thousands."
[54:02] From that point on, Saul wanted to kill
[54:05] this man because he was jealous of him.
[54:10] David runs to the wilderness and he's
[54:13] he's going out and he's running and and
[54:15] they had they didn't have water
[54:16] sometime. and they didn't have food and
[54:17] they were just struggling and they were
[54:19] hungry and he's with 400 men and and and
[54:22] doing everything that they can and then
[54:23] the Lord just provides little bit by
[54:25] little bit and how many times did David
[54:27] sit on the rocks and maybe look out
[54:29] across the valley and think I'm anointed
[54:31] king and I have to live like this
[54:34] Lord
[54:35] have you forsaken me
[54:38] don't know when Psalm 22 was written
[54:44] but it may have been during most surely
[54:47] was during one of these times. Maybe
[54:49] David's sitting on the rock.
[54:54] It's like, I would just like to go back
[54:55] to my dad's sheep.
[54:58] He says this Psalm 22 verse one. He
[55:03] says, "My God, my God, why hast thou
[55:06] forsaken me?"
[55:10] Someone else said those words when he
[55:14] was hanging right here.
[55:17] David with the same inspiration says,
[55:20] "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[55:21] me? Why out thou why art thou so far
[55:24] from helping me
[55:27] and from the words of my roaring?" That
[55:30] word means groaning
[55:31] from the words of my groaning.
[55:34] Oh my God, I cry in the daytime, but
[55:37] thou hearest me not.
[55:39] and in the night season. And I'm not
[55:42] silent. Lord, I keep crying out to you.
[55:46] But thou art holy.
[55:49] Oh, thou that inhabit inhabitest the
[55:52] praises of Israel. Our fathers trusted
[55:54] in you, God.
[55:58] They trusted, and thou didest deliver
[56:01] them. They cried unto thee, and they
[56:04] were delivered. They trusted in thee,
[56:06] and were not confounded. Listen
[56:10] to the humility of this soon to be king.
[56:15] But I'm a worm
[56:17] and no man and no man a I'm a reproach
[56:22] of men
[56:24] and despised
[56:26] of the people.
[56:28] And they that see me laugh me to scorn.
[56:32] They shoot out the lip. They shake the
[56:35] head, saying, "He trusted on the Lord,
[56:37] that he would deliver him. Let him
[56:39] deliver him, seeing he delightth in him.
[56:42] But thou art he that took me out of the
[56:45] womb."
[56:48] Lord, you took me, you brought me into
[56:50] this earth.
[56:52] Thou didest make me hope when I was upon
[56:55] my mother's breasts. I was cast upon
[56:58] thee from the womb. Thou art my God from
[57:02] my mother's belly.
[57:03] Be not far from me,
[57:06] for trouble is near,
[57:10] for there is none to help. Brother
[57:13] Josiah and uh the musicians could come.
[57:21] Verse 17,
[57:24] he says, "I may tell all my bones. They
[57:26] look and they stare upon stare upon me.
[57:29] They part my garments among them and
[57:31] cast lots upon my vesture. But be not
[57:34] thou far from me, oh Lord, oh my
[57:38] strength, haste to help me.
[57:43] If you know your Bible,
[57:46] you know that Jesus Christ said these
[57:48] same same words when he was on the
[57:51] cross. And and here is David and he's
[57:53] sitting there and he's looking looking
[57:55] out and he's he's probably hungry and
[57:57] tired and he sees his men thin and not
[57:59] having what they need and he says,
[58:01] "Lord, why have you forsaken me?" And
[58:05] yet right there as he's writing writing
[58:09] these words,
[58:11] he probably had no idea
[58:14] that it was the same spirit of Jesus
[58:16] Christ that was on him, that these words
[58:18] would be recorded on all of eternity.
[58:21] And none other than the son of God would
[58:23] say the same thing when he was on the
[58:25] cross.
[58:28] Imagine
[58:30] imagine David and how down he was. And
[58:34] brothers and sisters when when things
[58:36] befall us when things come upon us and
[58:38] we think we think Lord why did why did
[58:40] all this and you see that yeah you made
[58:42] a mistake and we always do but you see
[58:44] that that everything has fallen down
[58:46] upon you. Don't worry.
[58:50] God is there.
[58:52] The same God that was there with David
[58:55] was there.
[58:57] And then it must have been a long time
[58:58] later,
[59:01] David wrote another psalm.
[59:05] He said this Psalm 34.
[59:09] [Music]
[59:11] He must have been thinking back maybe
[59:12] about all these hardships that he went
[59:14] through. He must have been thinking, I
[59:16] was once there. I was once on that
[59:18] mountain and and there was no hope for
[59:20] me.
[59:21] He said, "I will bless the Lord at all
[59:24] times."
[59:26] His praise shall continually be in my
[59:28] mouth. My soul shall make her boast in
[59:30] the Lord. The humble
[59:34] shall hear thereof and be glad.
[59:37] Oh, magnify the Lord with me. And let us
[59:41] exalt his name together.
[59:45] [Music]
[59:46] He must have thought when King Saul was
[59:49] there,
[59:52] this great king that his whole desire of
[59:55] his whole life was to kill this young
[59:58] man. There he is out there not knowing
[1:00:02] what to do, just a few hundred men
[1:00:05] against the entire army of Israel. And
[1:00:07] he says, "I sought the Lord
[1:00:11] and he heard me
[1:00:13] and delivered me from all my fears.
[1:00:16] They looked upon they looked unto him
[1:00:18] and were lightened and their faces were
[1:00:20] not ashamed. This poor man cried
[1:00:24] and the Lord heard him and saved him out
[1:00:27] of all of his troubles.
[1:00:30] The angel of the Lord encamp around them
[1:00:32] that fear him and deliverth them. Oh,
[1:00:34] taste and see that the Lord is good.
[1:00:38] Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
[1:00:40] Yes.
[1:00:41] Oh, fear the Lord, all ye saints.
[1:00:43] Amen.
[1:00:44] For there is no want to them that fear
[1:00:47] him.
[1:00:49] If you fear God
[1:00:52] and you are obedient to God,
[1:00:55] then he will always provide.
[1:01:00] Maybe we could sing that song.
[1:01:07] I sought the Lord
[1:01:12] and he answered me
[1:01:16] and delivered me
[1:01:20] from every fear.
[1:01:23] Yes. Amen.
[1:01:25] Those who look on him
[1:01:29] are radant.
[1:01:33] They'll never be ashamed.
[1:01:37] Yes,
[1:01:37] they'll never be ashamed. This poor man
[1:01:41] cried.
[1:01:42] This poor man cried.
[1:01:44] I was that man.
[1:01:46] And the Lord heard me. And he heard me
[1:01:51] and save me from
[1:01:55] my enemy.
[1:01:59] The son of God
[1:02:04] surrounds his saints.

[1:06:03] Yes, God.
[1:06:05] The presence of God in the midst, Lord,
[1:06:07] as you promised, Lord Jesus, this
[1:06:10] exhortation, oh God, that we've been
[1:06:13] been given that Lord, you and your grace
[1:06:16] are calling us, Lord, into a higher a
[1:06:18] higher obedience to you, Lord Jesus.
[1:06:20] Amen. Oh Lord, not that you could just
[1:06:23] rule over our lives because you wanted
[1:06:26] power, but God, because of love, Lord
[1:06:28] Jesus.
[1:06:29] Yes. Amen.
[1:06:30] You wanted a higher thing for us, Lord
[1:06:32] God, than our own natures, Lord, would
[1:06:34] have would have wanted. So, Father, we
[1:06:36] praise you. We praise you for the grace
[1:06:38] that you've given, Lord, mo, not, Lord,
[1:06:41] only to forgive us, Lord Jesus, but also
[1:06:44] to cleanse our hearts, Lord, of those
[1:06:46] things that that aren't pleasing to you,
[1:06:48] Lord God, and and that do nothing for
[1:06:50] our lives, Lord God. You're so good,
[1:06:53] Lord.
[1:06:55] You give us our your word to us for our
[1:06:57] instruction, for our edification.
[1:06:59] Thank you, Father,
[1:07:00] for Lord, your your reproof to us, Lord.
[1:07:03] But when it comes, Lord, it's kind and
[1:07:05] gentle. It's good, Lord. It's in love,
[1:07:07] Lord Jesus, to instruct and
[1:07:09] to bring us higher, Lord God.
[1:07:12] Lord, I'm thankful, Lord. Our hearts
[1:07:13] have been called higher,
[1:07:16] Lord, just just to think, Lord, the
[1:07:18] grace that could have come, Lord, our
[1:07:20] way to draw us into this room this
[1:07:22] morning, Lord,
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:26] Lord, that you saw fit to call us, Lord,
[1:07:28] and and open our ears to hear, Lord.
[1:07:30] We're blessed beyond measure, Lord. May
[1:07:32] we return it. May we return such grace

[1:09:57] with me Lord. Glorify yourself with me.
[1:10:01] Exalt
[1:10:03] his name
[1:10:05] forever.
[1:10:11] Brothers and sisters,
[1:10:14] I read the words of our Lord Jesus today
[1:10:17] and he said if two of you two of you
[1:10:19] will agree on anything
[1:10:21] that he will grant it,
[1:10:24] I say we should agree.
[1:10:27] And if you have something on your heart,
[1:10:31] if you have a need, if maybe the Lord
[1:10:34] threw that rope around your neck and it
[1:10:37] yanked you and you're laying on your
[1:10:38] back,
[1:10:40] be a good time to come to him and say,
[1:10:43] "Lord, help me. I have this need."
[1:10:46] [Music]
[1:10:49] If you would like
[1:10:51] to come,
[1:10:53] as always, we pray for anyone that wants
[1:10:55] to be prayed for. If the Lord is dealing
[1:10:58] with you, just in your seat, just put it
[1:11:02] before him and understand that he wants
[1:11:06] to deliver you. He wants to help you.
[1:11:10] He doesn't want
[1:11:13] anyone else. He doesn't want a minister
[1:11:14] or a priest or a pastor or anything
[1:11:17] else. He doesn't want anyone to dominate
[1:11:21] you. He
[1:11:24] wants you to be in obedience to him.
[1:11:27] And then he promised if you have a need,
[1:11:30] brothers and sisters, you're welcome to
[1:11:31] come for prayer.
[1:11:34] But I can promise you that when he said,
[1:11:36] "Wherever two or three are gathered in
[1:11:38] my name, there I will be in his midst."
[1:11:40] He's right here. He's here because I
[1:11:43] believe our worship pleased him.
[1:11:46] So, let's just pray for just quietly
[1:11:52] while the sister plays the piano just
[1:11:54] just for a few moments before we leave.
