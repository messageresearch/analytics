and we all knew it he did not need anyone's approval to do the right thing my brother loved the lord but more importantly the lord loved my brother charlie was a true friend and it didn't matter what we were what we might be doing spending time with him of any form left he wanted to spend more time with him he had an act of disarming and befriending anyone while in a conversation he had the ability to throw the ball back keeping the conversation going he listened more than he spoke and his counsel was god filled i remember sitting with him in the backyard lost in conversation or just sharing a beautiful silence together let me tell you a little bit about my brother he was proceeding in death by teresa sotelo my father aggie lopez my sister anna teresa hoyer raymond my sister he was survived by his wife terry sotelo he was survived by michelle magana charles sotelo teresa pinon william sotelo emme sotelo gracie and boswell his 19 children susan marie katrina marie sabrina marie kayla swan daniel swann samson sotelo destiny sotelo rose sotelo acai manuel sotelo uriah james otello angelo sotelo boswell teresa boswell and joseph boswell his seven great-grandchildren aviana camilla michael robert athena reed evan schwartz aiden schwartz and charles boswell his surviving siblings sosumo sotelo norma loza david sotelo debbie sotelo tim sotelo and sam sotelo charlie was born september 29 1947 at st mary's hospital and at that time my parents were living in tucson arizona construction work can be hard to find and tucson can be either feast or famine when it comes to finding work my father often followed the work taking the family with him anywhere he went he was preaching the gospel charlie lived in towns such as clifton berensi duncan mammoth and tucson arizona my father introduced charlie to the outdoors and hunting at an early age southern arizona was filled with rabbits quail javelina and deer my father bought charlie a 22 caliber caliber rifle before he started elementary school he made sure that charlie knew how to take care of it and was extremely big on safety charlie went out to the field every chance he got because of hunting and living in the small towns with lots of game charlie really got to know southern arizona in 1959 my father started to build a church the house of prayer on the property in mammoth arizona charlie was 11 years old this was a job for a man and my father and charlie were working together to build it my father was working at kitt peak observatory then would rush home to complete the project other brothers would help with the block laying a block and pouring concrete but charlie was the main person that helped my dad in 1954 charlie started elementary school and junior high and mammoth charlie was restless as all young boys are and he found his chair of mischief along with his uh sister and his co-conspirator norma in 1960 sixth grade my father noticed that charlie and norma were coming home from school scraped up from fights uh he he bought some 12 ounce leather boxing gloves and started teaching charlie how to box norma was always close by watching later that year a few boys ganged up against him after school and met him as he was leaving he was outnumbered but he had his sister fighting alongside my mom didn't like them fighting but she also told them if it was for your honor they needed to fight back and finish it they came home triumphant that same year charlie was itching to go hunting and he persisted that he was going to go hunting uh after school my mom told him not to go my dad told him not to go you wait until i get home from from work and then i'll take you charlie came home from school and went anyways one of the boys that went with him accidentally shot charlie in the ankle around seventh grade he was complaining to my mother the kids at school have so much good things to eat crunchy apples pastries hosted cupcakes chocolate she told charlie praise god anyways say thank you jesus charlie and charlie would not do it he was upset they don't they're not even christians they have so much finally after walking around upset he said thank you jesus instantly there was a knock on the door it was a young girl that worked at the grocery store nearby my mother answered the door and the young girl says sister sotelo i felt in my heart to get you these groceries i really don't know how to shop for groceries but i brought you this bag in the bag was crunchy apples pastries hosted cupcakes and chocolates tailor made for charlie reading was not one of charlie's best skills uh my mother got advice from one of the educators as he was growing up find things that that he likes to read and put them somewhere that is accessible charlie loved boxing and he loved hunting and fishing in that bathroom my mom put a magazine rack for charlie's reading materials it obviously worked because charlie knew all the boxing stats and he learned how to reload ammo of any kind regardless if it was rifle or pistol in hard times he would even melt down lead and cast his own bullets high school was spread between three high schools charlie spent his uh freshman year and part of his sophomore year at salmon well high school my parents moved back to tucson in arizona tucson arizona in 1965 where charlie did a semester at pueblo high school charlie quit school and went into the apprenticeship as a meat cutter this was a skill that he was going to use and find useful cleaning and butchering game later he apprenticed under brother agustin hoyer senior and our brother-in-law henry hoyer he stayed out of school till the fall of 1965 where he started his junior year at sunnyside high school it was at this time that he got into the carpenters apprenticeship through the shop classes at sunnyside he graduated from sunnyside high school in 1967. he started working as a second year carpenter's apprentice straight out of high school and he worked in southern arizona with companies such as hansel phelps stern rogers mckee ball and ball mm sundt del webb hickey construction co decker craven head and the list goes on charlie was working at lucky's grocery store at the southgate shopping center when he was in high school he was helping an elderly lady take her groceries to the to her car unbeknownst to him was a girl sitting in the car in the parking lot the lord spoke to that girl and told her this is going to be your husband a couple years later he met uh charlie met teresa he was star struck with her and they went out for two weeks and he proposed six months later in december the 27th of 1968 he married terry chucky and mary were born in tucson medical center here in tucson in 1976 again there was a shortage of work in southern arizona and charlie went to work in the four corners area of the state he worked at the san juan power plant near farmington uh with mm sundt charlie fell in love with the area there was antelope and elk deer bear as well as quail and rabbit there was places to go fishing everywhere you looked and work was plentiful in 1977 he sold a house in tucson and he moved to the family to farmington new mexico billy amos and gracie were born in san juan medical center in farmington new mexico no church no friends no family they had no choice but to trust in god in aztec new mexico the lord gave them a home with no money in their pockets another time they drove to church in and cedar hill new mexico by faith because they had no gas god took them to new mexico like he took moses to the back side of the desert to find out who who they were they experienced many many miracles that built their faith in god work ran out in new mexico and it was time to come back in 1987 they moved back to tucson arizona charlie started building custom homes and he employed his brothers and his brother-in-law eddie lauzon my brother was a family man and he was constantly surrounded by family charlie always stopped in to check on my mother and father and he would do all the handy man things that my mother could think of he always made time for them throughout the day and he loved to pick them up pick up my father and they would hang out every day his grandchildren were his prized possession alicia sampson angelo and teresa were constantly with tata they owned him and he loved it gracie and mary would go shopping with charlie and he loved super balmer sosimo visited charlie every day they were best friends together they would sit and load bullets for hours social would sit outside with charlie laughing have you ever heard a group of hotels left other times they would just remember about times past but mostly they always talked about going to the next hunt both of them along with david became regulars at the tucson mountain rifle and pistol range charlie loved testing and dialing in loads as you know charlie loved to go hunting he put his deer he put him for deer and elk every year but even if he didn't get drawn chucky amos sammy and samson made sure that charlie went with them many ways there's a hill in sausage arizona that they called charlie's hill almost all of us have gotten our deer there charlie would get to this hill early in the morning and sit he left the glass he taught us how to glass and spot deer it was an extremely productive place i saw him pass up big bucks so that us lesser experienced hunters would bag our first big buck because of charlie hunting trips became family events where we would we were all allowed to bond making our family stronger my brother charlie was a christian man a true and quiet leader and we all knew it my family has requested a song sister grace and sister lily was saying that [Music] precious memories

[Music] the stillness of the midnight precious sacred scenes unfold memories fill my soul hello good morning thank you for coming to my brother's life celebration i'm sam the youngest of nine children i have many wonderful memories of my brother charlie i shared a room with charlie david and tim at one time i have many great memories of my brother he was an awesome brother one of my earliest memories was when my brother married my sister-in-law terry who was like my second mom i remember feeling very lucky that terry was now in our family terry says that i slept with them on their wedding night i don't remember that throughout the years terry and i throughout the years if i ever needed any kind of mental or moral support charlie and terry were there for me it was charlie who got me to love boxing as a boy i would box charlie for what i thought was hours and he would take me to the boxing matches all the time we would even go watch the boxers train i wanted to do everything that charlie done charlie was a serious outdoorsman we liked hunting fishing and camping charlie helped me cap my first catch my first fish and fish at puerto lovos mexico i was sore for real for really in that fish for days i have left for hunting fishing and camping because charlie made it fun for me i can honestly say i was i was mad at charlie only one time and it was my own fault as a pre-teen i was a catcher of a baseball team i asked charlie to pitch a few balls to me so i could practice catching after about 20 pitches charlie thought i was ready for his curveball and that ball curved right into my eye i had a black eye for a long time there are many things in my family because of my brother charlie showed me how to be a good and loving father he showed me how to talk to my children and grandchildren charlie was a great father and grandfather he was a great example of a human being that i strive to be like what a privilege to be remembered that way for a family to have such precious memories if you understand they asked as a congregation psalm turn your eyes upon jesus to think about the words that his younger brothers speak of him that was because jesus was in charlie and he was the one being reflected oh turn your eyes upon [Music] and the things of earth will grow [Music] the family has asked our brother newton bennett if he would speak here so as he comes we'll sing it one more time [Music] and the things of earth will grow strange [Music] god bless you you could be seated again i'd like to greet you in the name of the lord jesus and welcome you to the life celebration of brother charlie sotelo been said that uh brother charlie was quite a character but in his character way he was very unassuming even in his stature and in his mannerisms uh but you knew when he was there because he changed the atmosphere charlie always come into a place and it didn't matter what was happening you felt at peace he just had that look about him in that that era about him that you know it's just it was just peaceful you always felt like i mean look at this face how would you not be at peace with his his this beautiful face is is real calming and uh reassuring and then when you then when he opened his mouth you you felt even more at peace because uh you could just know that there was something about him that was different and uh and and special i believe it's of course everyone in their own separate ways but charlotte just had his way and it was it was very special and i appreciate enjoyed brother charlie's fellowship and the time together and i didn't spend as much time with him maybe as many of you have of course family but brother charlie was very precious to me and i was very honored even just for a few months to be called his pastor and i do appreciate that honor and appreciate brother charlie and each of you being here so i want to read a couple of scriptures and just give a little thought if i could out of the word of god tonight and in honor of brother charlie because i believe that that would be the one thing that brother charlie would turn to more than anything would be the lord jesus i believe if brother charlie we're here right now he would tell you the very same thing if you haven't turned your life to jesus you should do it tonight right now there might not be a tomorrow we're not promised tomorrow and the way the world events are going we may not know if there is a tomorrow and i believe that charlie we're here in the flesh he'd tell you the very same thing because i believe charlie is in the place that he had been striving for his whole life and i believe he wants all of his family and friends to come and share that with him and be that as a part of the the inheritance and the heritage that he shared with each one of you when he was here so i'm gonna go to philippians to start now and uh philippians the third chapter read a couple of verses here starting with verse 9. philippians 3 9 and he found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is god by faith and that righteousness is by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain to the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after even that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus i believe that's how brother charlie spent his life we hear about the things that he did and the the exploits that he had in life he was a hard worker he loved hunting and outdoors and those things but in all of that the one thing that was constant it sounded through all the testimonies and the way i knew him was that he pressed toward that mark he pressed towards the mark you know when you're in a race there's always a finish line there's always a goal that you're trying to attain there's always a place you're trying to reach and for some people it seems unattainable for some people in a race they get tired or they they get weary or they faint or they fall out of the race before they finish but you know when you're a christian and and that mark is the one thing that you're striving for no matter how weary life may get and no matter hard or complicated or difficult things can seem you're always striving for that one mark that mark is the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus brother charlie's attained that prize brother charlie's enjoying that prize tonight that prize of life that he has made to that he has come to the end of he has finished his course he has run his race and he has uh gotten that prize he's attained that prize through life all of life and everything that charlie did was to bring to that one moment in time and you know every one of us will come to that one moment in time everybody every mortal person will come to that place in time where you will face the same thing that charlie faced i believe charlie was ready to go but even brother chuck told me a couple weeks ago he told him that he was ready to go even before he contracted covet brother charlie was the man who lived his life for the lord jesus and he was ready to go he was ready to go meet the lord jesus paul said here he said not though as i either or i may know him after the power of his resurrection amen the power of his resurrection so that's the thing that we're looking forward to now that's the thing that brother charlie's looking forward to is that that that uh resurrection that time where he comes forth in a perfected body amen you know there's three bodies we have this natural body here we have a celestial body which we call the theophany that's where brother charlie is now but there'll be a time at the resurrection where that body will come back and it'll pick up this body that he was housed this glorified condition it'll be a glorified body he'll pick that up no matter where it is around the world no matter what the elements no matter where it's spread you could take an ash and you can put it in every ocean and in every continent in the world and when that resurrection comes and that voice shouts out just like it did at the grave of lazarus charlie cetilla will come forth in a glorified condition he'll be come forth once again in that prize that he was looking to that that perfect body i'm assuming that this picture here is a lot closer to what he looked like when he was 18 19 21 years old i'm not sure how old he was here uh it looks like brother billy a few years ago to me as before the grace i'd i looked at it and i thought mine did they get the pictures mixed up look looks like it's sun there his son looks like him amen but he that's what he'll be like that's what we're looking for in that resurrection when they come but that high calling that he has attained that place that prize that charlie has attained is that high calling and every christian has that high calling it's a calling above all else to be called a christian it's a privilege to be called a christian do you know that it's a privilege because to be called a christian means that you are christ-like and if you are christ-like then you've reached that place to where christ is pleased with you and as our precious brother said he's identified himself with brother charlie and that identification i believe is what we recognized in brother charlie that identification that jesus was so pleased with charlie sotelo that he placed his own life in him charlie wasn't the same anymore he was a different person brand new creature in christ jesus amen and that's the place that that that's the thing that's going to take him there amen that's the place that he's looking for i believe he was ready to go he had run his race he had kept the faith he had done what god had called him to do i got another scripture i want to read to you found in ii timothy amen you know people talk about this covet thing going on and you almost get the sense that people think that that satan can rob the life of a child of god friend i'm here to tell you today that there is no way that satan can rob a child of god if you're a child of god you're in the palm of his hand and no one can pluck him out they don't matter if cancer if it's heart attack if it's whatever vehicle by which god chooses it was just charlie satello's time to go home and all and every one of us i'm looking forward to that time myself i still we're all still pressing for that mark we're still all looking for the end of that race we're all still all looking to attain that prize but it'll come looking for it charlie's already got it praise the lord he's already in that new body you know what charlie cetello is no longer hurting charlie cetillo is no longer in pain charlie sotelo is no longer confined to a wheelchair amen he's dancing if we can see him today praise the lord he's dancing forth in that dew body celebrating that life that he was looking for second timothy chapter four verse six through eight second timothy four six through 8 4 now paul said now for i am now ready to be offered the time of my departure is at hand i heard that i don't know if charlie put it in those exact words but i heard that was his that was his attitude that's how he felt he was ready to meet the lord the time of my departure is that hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith the faith the faith the faith you know jesus said if we believe and have faith in him that nothing should be impossible unto us praise the lord the faith not a faith but the faith i have fought a good fight finished my course i've kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness praise the lord what is a crown a crown is a prize a crown is something that's awarded to royalty i believe charlie satello was a member of the royal family no not in britain or england but the royal family of god he was an ambassador of heaven he was an he was a a a representative of jesus christ on this earth he is now attained that crown that righteousness that is of jesus christ it wasn't charlotte cetillos he said well i know all kinds of faults failures mistakes things charlie no no no we're not talking about that i mean the blood of jesus christ annihilates everything that satan could ever hold against charlie cetello charlie zattello was wrapped in the righteousness of jesus christ that very same righteousness every one of you if you're not in it tonight have the opportunity to be wrapped in every one of you amen can be wrapped in that same righteousness the righteousness that is of jesus christ perfection amen not not the perfection of man but the perfection of god you know men look through prisms in a different way than when god looks at it when god looks down he sees it in a different light he sees everything so his ways are greater than our ways higher than our ways he looks at it through a different lens he looks at it through different eyes he looks at it in a different way than what we do like we call love love people think love is is universal no it's not the love of god far exceeds anything the love of man could ever begin to produce and it's perplexing to people they don't understand but it's god's righteousness the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them amen can we can we put charlie's name in that would be all right amen not to me alone but to charlie sotelo amen i believe that i can put my name there too can you put your name in there i hope so i hope you can put you if you want to see charlie cetillo again your name better be able to fit right there amen don't matter if you're family or whatever i'm religious so that don't matter the devil's religious but are you christian are you born again there's there's the separating line amen that day amen that he shall give me at that day not me only but unto all them also that love his appearing praise the lord my last conversation with brother charlie was just that he was looking forward to that time he was looking forward to that that prism this is this is long before the event the hospital all that but in his heart in a christian's heart it bleeds for the lord jesus it desires the lord jesus you know jesus said in the beatitudes if you hunger and thirst after righteousness you shall be filled amen you shall be if you're hungering and thirsting for him you shall be filled now there's not another promise of that in the world there's all kinds of people that hunger for and thirst for wealth but they never attain it they hunger and thirst for riches and for fame but they never attain it they're hungering and they're thirsting for power and and and something to take over the world and humanity and but they never attain it but the promise of jesus is if you hunger and thirst after righteousness you shall be filled amen just like brother charlie was filled praise the lord charlie's in that glorified body now amen he's waiting for his family he's waiting for all of you sister teresa for the chuck for the billy for the amos amen grace i haven't seen you since they closed down the village inn i think huh amen gracie used to wait on us at the village in cartero amen it's good to see you praise the lord talked about brother charlie often when she came when we were there but i got one more scripture i want to read because i don't want to hold it too long amen there's obviously more that could be said but the thing i want us to understand today is that brother charlie is with the lord jesus now he's in that dimension where there's no sorrow and there's no pain and there's no struggle you know what charlie's not worried one iota about whether russia is invading ukraine or not he's not worried one iota about covet 19 or any disease or affliction he's not worried about the next president if there is one he's not worried about any of those he's he's attained his price he has made it he's there he's waiting for us amen and i want i want to be one to fulfill that desire in his heart to see me again because i want to see him again hebrews uh hebrews chapter 12 verses 1 and 2. wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight it's good advice tonight lay aside every weight you know a weight is something that drags you down a lot of people are weighted down today and they don't even know it sin itself is a weight that weighs you down and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us that race that brother charlie has finished the prize he has attained the crown of righteousness that is his he's finished his race he has finished his course we miss him he meant the bodily part of charlie sotillo we miss very much grieve in our hearts and there's nothing wrong with grieving there's nothing wrong with being sad but i enjoy when i hear a story about brother charlie that makes me chuckle a little bit because those are the memories i like to have those are the things i like to remember coming home all beat up and the next time he comes home and his sisters beat him him and his sisters beat up a group just that's the things i'll remember about brother charlie amen because i that's the kind of person he was amen he would rather make somebody laugh than cry he would rather make somebody happy than make them sad and you think well that sounds silly don't most people do that have you been around the world today do you think most people actually feel that way do you think most people want to see you happy rather than sad sometimes i wonder but charlie was an old soul he was a rare breed he was a man of god he loved the lord jesus amen lay aside every weight the sin which do it does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author which is the beginner and the finisher which is the ender of our faith amen who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the same is set down on the right hand of the throne of god charlie's reached his place now it's our turn it's our turn to go be with him you know i get sick of this pest house that we're living in i'm thankful there's something called death that releases me from this prism this pest house you know a pest house is a place where they used to put people with all germs and diseases and uh afflictions things like that but god is here to release us from that there's something to release us and as a christian he's waiting to receive you he's waiting to guide you across that river because he is our portion he is our guide if you don't know jesus tonight know him friend get to know him tonight let him be your savior let him be your lord your owner your ruler a lot of people like him as their savior but they don't want him as their lord no i want you to be my savior jesus but don't tell me what to do don't tell me how to live my life well there's only one way to please the lord and that's with this word charlie cetello's absolute charlie sotelo's type host jesus christ the word let it be yours tonight amen he's attained his prize i'm looking forward to seeing him again and i pray that the lord would comfort you comfort the family love you loved him appreciate each one of you being here tonight god is our portion amen and he was and he was charlie's and charlie has reached that place charlie has attained that prize he's waiting on us amen let's not disappoint him praise the lord god bless you tonight full stand blessed assurance jesus is mine [Music] many think about insurance closely associated to an assurance and you pay your dues to the insurance company and they try to find some way not to have to to resolve it if they can get around but a blessed assurance that god gave he said i will go and make sure that all the debt

want to stroll over heaven with you god bless everyone and welcome and thank you for joining us in honoring my father charles manuel sotelo um well to me my father was a hero everything i looked at him to me was a hero you know everything that he did in my eyes he was the best the way he swung a hammer i thought he was the best carpenter i've ever seen in my life when he shot a gun i thought he was the best shot the best hunter that's just the way i looked at him because he was my dad he was my hero but uh you know my father my father first and foremost was a christian he was a gentle loving father a great friend and he loved the lord i know that the lord loved him too though the lord took care of my dad through many many many many trials and errors and and all that it gives me comfort in knowing that my dad is he's in a better place now i know that he has no more pain and he's not suffering anymore and i thank god for that and i also know that he's up there with my my my nana and my tata and my dias that passed on before and the other loved ones that are passed on my cousins everybody that's up there i know that made it to the other side i know my dad's up there with him so uh my dad he raised us to be christians to go to church to pray to read the bible he taught us how to rely on the lord for everything that we needed um of course he also taught me how to hunt and to fish and to load bullets and stuff like that is definitely his passion but i think the most important lesson he ever taught me was to not be a quitter i i [Music] i struggled with that at the beginning but you know i look back now and i think that me going and following through with things was because my dad didn't like quitters my dad my dad had a lot of wisdom and a lot of patience he had a lot of patience i know that me and my brothers and my sisters you know we put my dad through a lot and uh i wish i could take all that back but i believe that it was god's plan and it was god's instrument was my dad to teach us and bring us up and uh correct us and raise us and i know that my dad did a wonderful job and i was blessed i was blessed to have my dad my wonderful father for 52 years and i love him and i miss him i miss him so much and i know you know i just look around i know he left a great legacy very much you know he left a legacy of love and family and uh my dad he uh he really enjoyed fellowship with his kids he would just love us to come and visit my son my son would go visit him all the time you know spend a lot of time with him and i used to love sitting there spending a lot of time with my dad but uh i really think that my dad really loved his grandchildren and and his great-grandchildren you know he was he was he uh showed a lot of love to everybody i guess that everybody that knew him um loved my father too because you know he put off that love to everybody else oh my father will always be with me and everything that i do every time i go to church i think of my dad i sing a song a christian song i think of my dad when i read my bible i think of my dad when i go hunting and fishing i know it's going to be on my heart you know i'm honored i am honored and blessed to be a son of charles manosutello and i thank the lord for my dad and i can only hope that i could be a fraction of the man my dad was and uh thank you once again for coming and being with us good evening thank you all for coming to celebrate my thought to charlie and his life i wrote some stuff down but um you know it's really hard to put my grandfather into words like what he meant to all of us what he meant to us as his grandchildren his brothers his uh his wife my grandma um you know i hear every everything that you know his brother said and my dad you know and i can't it's just you can't help but think of you know all the all the great memories that i got to share with him we all got to share with him you know um there's one thing for sure about my grandfather is that he was different um he he was different there was just hit the way he loved people the way he would make every single person that ever crossed paths with him feel special um there's just that's not something that everybody can say that they do you know i told my wife um my wife letty i had a conversation with her about it and you know it's really difficult to pass away and be liked by everybody that ever had any interaction with you but i know that was that was the interpretation of everybody that knew him of my grandfather that he was just great he loved differently he talked differently and anybody who ever got to hear him laugh he laughed differently you know it's just you know i heard my theo talk about walmart super walmart all of my cousins we can all every any any all of my cousins can all you know attest to that that he loved to go shopping that was his favorite thing to do my thoughts i loved to go places he left to go to the store didn't matter what it was for if it was something that my grandma grandma needed if it was something that he needed he wanted to go and he didn't want to go by himself he wanted all his grandkids to go even if that meant sitting in the back of his truck and it was 110 degrees outside he all wanted us to go and that's just how my grandfather was he he really truly lived off of love that was his thing he didn't have any hate in his heart didn't matter what anybody did to him my grandfather he loved you he forgave you he had no hard feelings towards you that's just how he was and there's not mary i don't i don't know very many people like that he's one of a kind you know it's just it it really it it sucks you know that we had to lose him but but i know that he's in a better place and i know that he's where he needs to be and where he always wanted to be you know i hear everybody talk about him being a christian and that's one for one thing for sure that he was a christian he loved jesus you cannot take that away from him that's that's what he was all about it didn't matter if he was in pain it didn't matter if he was doing good he praised god it did not matter to him and i can't say that that you know that i've that i would that i've ever been that way you know you you go through trouble you you have bad things happen to you you're like you know why is me what was me i thought the anytime i ever talked to my doctor about any issues that i ever had it was always let me pray for you or you know just my thoughts i had a way of talking to people and getting to getting through to people that i just you know i hope that when i get to his age i can be something like that you know my thought that took me was the first person to ever take me hunting he was the first person to help me to teach me how to skin a deer you know i i can go on for days talking about it but you know it's just it's it's it's the truth it's truly a blessing to to call him my grandfather i i don't know i don't have much more to say than that that's just it you know it's been hard it's you know i for those of you that don't know i when he got sick i was going through uh osa in missouri so there was a lot of time you know or i'm not able to talk on the phone i'm not able to have a phone to see if he was okay to see if he was doing good you know it's kind of a day by day thing but my thought to stay strong for all of us and and he fought very hard and but at but in the end we all knew that that my tatas in his heart he wanted to go home he wanted to you know he he suffered a lot you know and he wanted to be with god he wanted to be with his sisters and and his dad and his mom but anyways thank you hello everybody um i said i wrote down a few words from my dad to tell you a little bit about him see if i can get through this one of the first earliest memories i have of my father involves him loving my mom watching him kiss and hold her tightly inspired me and my brother here to try to pull him apart playfully we've always fought for my mom's attention but uh we're always competing for my mom's attention however that's really revealing of how my my first memories of him is how deeply he loved my mother in the years that follow my father and i would uh scour the deserts for mormon tea and hunt rabbits for food for our family so it seems like kind of comedy he's like taught us all how to hunt and fish and gather when we moved to arizona i love following my father to his work watching him build various structures with great skill and care his attention to detail was impeccable and his precision was manifested in every aspect of his life from the sacred geometry of a family home to the composition of a tiny bullet however it wasn't always business my truck my uh my dad also loved western films like playing eastwood uh we we uh we certainly tried to channel that his talent as we shot soda cans out in the desert i don't know if you guys did that with my dad but that was like his thing many nights me and my father would uh take long take the longest way home i never understood it then why my man would make a 30 minute journey i have a five minute drive but i get to know i get to know it now that all he wanted was more time to talk to listen to be together stealing these moments making a connection although the the loss of my father was impacted my family greatly and there will forever be a child-shaped hole in this world i have no regrets this community has been elevated by his relentless love and his internal impact that's all i have thank you guys for being here for me and my family good evening bear with me i'm not the best reader um but i love my father tremendously and i'm going to miss him good evening thank you guys for coming to my father memorial service losing my father has been the hardest thing i've ever had to deal with today's a hard day but it's also celebration of my father's love life and his love his love for his parents his love for his brothers and sisters his love for his wife his love for his children his love for his grandchildren and his great-grandchildren what i want us to most remember about my dad is his love how he loved all of us individually in a special way we are gathered here in this church tucson tabernacle because my father was a godly man who loved the lord his walk with jesus begins with his parent his parents manuel sotelo and teresa sotelo manuel sotelo was a cowboy who became a preacher charissa sotelo was a kind soul known for always making sure her kids were in church no matter what my dad always taught us that my non-end my thoughtless prayers always came before the throne of the lord and they always took care of him and us as a young man my dad was a wild man one thing my dad liked was fast cars and street racing one time he was racing and he fell out of his car and got drunk it's a miracle he wasn't badly hurt but it shows that the lord always was with him even when he was in the world there's even stories of him peeling out of the church parking lot when i would ask him about this he would shake his head and he would cover his face to talk about my dad you have to talk about the love of his life teresa sotelo the first time my mom ever saw my dad was in a work when he when he was working at a lucky's grocery store he was helping the older lady out with her groceries despite not knowing him at the time a voice um sorry i'm a little laid out with her groceries um sorry guys despite not knowing him at the time a voice said told her this this is your husband she sang down in her seat so he wouldn't see her after after officially meeting each other and going to the movies with some friends my dad fell in love with my mom he called her every day for two weeks later he asked her to marry him they were married 53 years with their new marriage my mom inherited my dad's two youngest brothers who were more like his oldest sons timothy and samuel sotelo my mom says three days after their wedding night my theo sam was sleeping in their bed between them he was five years old at the time and was very attached to my dad for those of you who know me you probably know me as a fighter as a boxer i can i can say that i am because of my dad when i was young i i was a wrestler but one day my dad saw me boxing my cousins in the backyard and he said you're a fighter so he found a boxing gym and started taking me there i lived in that boxing gym my dad was always in my corner some of you might even know my dad as a boxing coach he was a corner man for a lot of amateur and professional boxing matches even when i did wrong my dad was always there to support me through all my through all my trials i think out of all of his kids i needed him the most i think other i think other parents would have given up on me he was always he always made me feel good enough and i knew at the end i was he was very proud of me he was always someone that i could celebrate my victories with he was not afraid to give me correction and he could do it with very few words i remember in elementary i got into a fight at school he came and picked me up and on the way home he didn't say anything to me and right before he went inside he just told me i'm disappointed in you that hurt me more than all the spanx he said he could have gave me that's how my dad would give correction a big part of my dad's life was the accident that happened in april of 1992 two days after the funeral of my nana my dad fell off the roof and fractured while fixing the cooler and he fractured his knee i remember coming home from school and finding ambulance and fire trucks in the front yard i remember my dad laying on the side of the yard screaming he had completely shattered his knee this was devastating to my dad he was badly he was bad bedridden for very very very very long time and he became very depressed the accident had taken away his ability to walk to work to provide for his family and to be the working man he had always been i remember finding my my father in his wheelchair crying on the side of the yard it was the first time i ever seen my dad cry he told me to leave and i did but i wish i would have ran to him and gave him a hug i was angry with god before letting this happen to my dad i was angry with god for all the pain it caused my dad and and my family i thought it was a curse looking back now i could see that god did this to work on my dad to give him more patience and make him more loving before this my dad had been hard on us and back in the day it was common to whip your kids as discipline i'm sure we needed the discipline but my two older siblings god got it harder the hardness kept my dad from being as close to them as he could have been the accident softened him it helped my dad heal these relationships it helped it allowed my dad to love more deeply and to trust in god more a special thing that i got to witness was how my dad took care of his dad after my nana passed away my dad would hang out with with him all the time and pick him up and take him to all his doctor's appointments he would go with his walker and i would help load my tata's wheelchair in into the back of the truck then i would sit between the two of them as we would drive when i looked back i took these moments for granted but now i can see what a beautiful thing to witness my dad's selflessness towards his father like my dad was connected to his dad i was connected to my father i could feel when my dad was happy or sad i knew when he was confident and even scared my dad's last days we spent a lot of time my dad's last days we spent a lot of time at the hospital i spent a lot of time on the phone with him we were we were allowed to visit but we weren't allowed to to be in his room or to touch him the way we wanted to touch him there's a lot of healing in the touch we couldn't be by his side or touch him like we wanted to while while he was there he would call me at 3 4 in the morning i stayed on the phone with my dad a lot he would just lay the phone right here and i would listen to him and we would just share silence together whenever he got nervous we would talk to each other from our fighting experience i knew how to keep him calm i made sure to stay on the phone with him i knew we were in for a hard fight i wanted to bring him home during this time i heard him pray for all of you i heard him communicate with the lord he asked the lord to bless all of his children grandchildren and great-grandchildren he brought you all before the lord while he was in the hospital i had a dream that me and a mexican kid were soldiers and we were in the wilderness we had been given instruction on how to get home so we were heading back up a huge mountain as we reached as we reached the top of top i i realized i couldn't see a path forward i look back and and saw how far we had come and i got scared and i knelt down this mexican kid he tapped me on my shoulder and he told me we need to get over the ridge i followed him over the ridge and then we saw a city lights the city lights i remember i remember we were both relieved the next day i told my dad about the dream and that i thought it was about him about us trying to get him home i said to him i was with this mexican kid but he was way more mexican than me my dad said to me i am more mexican than you hmm [Music] i thought i was going to bring him home but now i think he's telling me to keep on moving forward my dad fought a beautiful fight he fought hard i'm proud to be his son the thing that i'm going to take away from my father give me a second guys i told myself i would be strong the thing that i'm the thing that i'm going to take away from my father is he wasn't the same man in his 20s that he was in his 40s he wasn't the same man in his 40s that he was in his 60s he kept growing the older he got the more love he seemed to have the more forgiveness he seemed to have i know one day when i am at the end that my dad is going to tap me on the shoulder and he's going to lead me over the ridge into that city i want to thank everybody who prayed for my dad i cannot sincerely thank you enough there's a lot of power and prayer thank you for praying for my dad i want to thank everybody that came to the service to celebrate to celebrate my father's life as my father's son as his heir and as his arrow i want to thank everybody coming to my father's service thank you guys what uh what a testimony to hear from his voice being honest from his grandchildren from his family and all see the same thing standing on the outside not being part of the family but being around them and get to see the character that developed in the in the family going to school with his two youngest brothers who he raised as his sons and i don't know if he ever heard of some of the things you guys did probably did but you know his love for use never changed but it's because he knew jesus christ because it's a love of god being expressed out and so you have a living witness and testimony of what god can do in somebody's life so and i would say this to you the family mr terry the uncles and the cousins and children love one another pray for one another encourage one another and get together and share the good memories when you can i just one one personal thing here we went back home after we had been living in arizona and got to get together with the cousins and who i thought were way younger than me because they were just smaller we found out we were pretty close in age so their kids began to ask me and my two brothers tell us everything you know about our dance and for the next couple hours we just shared a lot of good things and laughed together do the same keep the happy memories keep the good things together cry on one another's shoulders if you have to and comfort one another if you'll stand with me what a day that'll be when my jesus i shall see [Music] that will
