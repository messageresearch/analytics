inside [Music] foreign [Music] God bless you all good to be in the house of the Lord tonight while I have brother Kurt good to see you my friend well I have you standing let's turn in our Bibles [Music] let's turn to First Timothy chapter one it's a scripture I believe to lay a good foundation for this Acts chapter 9. First Timothy chapter 1 verse 12. and I thank Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer a persecutor and injurious but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus those words of your servant the Apostle Paul father is we see his ministry begin tonight in this book of Acts father we pray that you would lay your blessings upon the word as I read it and Lord may we have the understanding to benefit from it and father to to appreciate it we love you Lord we ask that you join us in Jesus name amen God bless you all you can take your seats sister Eunice pointed out that I'm hoarse it's because yesterday's Services um last night they were uh there was there's a lot of uh the the volume was raised especially when I was speaking so that's that's why the vocal cards aren't in as such as good a shape as they usually are um it's good to see everyone it's it's good to see you know I was thinking about our young people have for the past couple days and and I'm just so proud of them sister Olivia a little sister I'm proud of you you know when you come into church and you're here and um you're just good kids it was so I'm so honored to see the the Roberts family there in church last night and wow they just looked they were just like glowed you know walking in there and I may be a little bit biased but wow am I proud I just I feel good about our our kids they um they're first class and I'm honored that that they would want to come to church and I want to make church somewhere that they enjoy coming that's why we have some of the projects we're working on I want I want this to be a place that they like to come to um and I I don't see Kenneth back there I grew up I woke up grumpy this morning too I didn't I didn't get enough sleep so God bless the little guy I could for the Jordan I relate to him and you know what Hosanna I think is my favorite song so so yeah I relate to the little guy um this saw or this uh Acts chapter 9 is that as I said this morning it's a pivotal pivotal place in this book of Acts and and really in all Christian history in Acts chapter 8 that we just went through but the Lyle preached on we see that Saul was consenting to the death of Stephen and we see another deacon besides Stephen who was stoned he was murdered we have another Deacon rise on the scene this man's name's Philip we heard where Philip came from and and we see Philip had Evangelistic meetings in these different places and then we see this man Simon the Sorcerer he comes in and and he starts he he looks and he likes this and he became he becomes a Believer and then he sees that these disciples are laying their hands on the people and then these people are receiving the Holy Ghost so Simon says he said Simon Says I wonder if that were that where that comes from Simon the Sorcerer says he says that he wants to be able to he wants to not receive necessarily the Holy Spirit but he wants that power that where he can lay hands on other people and they can receive the Holy Spirit and he offers to pay the disciples and we see that Peter rebukes him and then all of a sudden we see Philip back out and he's out in the desert and he's he's going along the Lord leads him to this man of great stature this important Ethiopian man and Philip jumps on his his Carriage there and he introduces him to the Lord Jesus and to me it's so interesting that he introduces him to the Lord Jesus by the word he was reading the word and you see this man and he saw the revelation of it and then he gave his heart to the Lord I'm going to talk today that there's different ways that people give their hearts to the Lord Jesus so we see this Ethiopian he gives his heart to the Lord through the interpretation of the scripture and then as brother Lyle pointed out they're out in the middle of the desert and all of a sudden they find water I'd like to know about a while where it was it was in an oasis was it some sort of a man-made pool what was it but that Ethiopian eunuch he says Hey and He commands The Chariot to stop commands it stop and he says here's water what prevents me from being baptized and Philip says if you believe with all your heart and he says I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and then Philip baptizes him there so let's start with a scripture here before we get to Acts chapter 9 let's start with another scripture and that's Philippians chapter 3 and it just kind of it sets a mood really for for who this man is that that was struck down that we're going to read about here in a minute that how much this man appreciates the Lord Jesus further on in his ministry Philippians chapter 3 let's start with verse 3. this is who is now known when this is written as the Apostle Paul and he says this for we are the circumcision which worship God and in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh though I might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I'm more circumcise The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteous which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ wow yea doubtless and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord it's important that word right there my Lord we're going to hear something about that in in the scriptures coming for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and in the power of his resurrection and in The Fellowship of his sufferings be made conformable unto his death those are very very important things and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings really says that this man is the Christ if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after that if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus so he's saying here that I want to get a hold of the same Jesus that got a hold of me now this is 8064 according to your Bible said if you have a Scofield bible probably everybody knows this but if you have a Scofield bible in the in the sinner between the between the two readings here in the center and at the top it tells you the date the estimated date of when these things took place so according to to these dates Paul was struck down on the road to Damascus in 80 35 and he wrote this in Philippians in 1864. so this is some 30 years later and he's still had that that Zeal not as though I had already attained it either were made already perfect but I follow after that I may apprehend that I may get a hold of that for which I am apprehended of Christ that that which got a hold of me and I'm still searching for it brother Kurt 30 years later there is this great man the Apostle Paul and he's still searching for it he still has a desire there's this still this burning desire to have it you know when we receive the holy spirit that doesn't mean it's like okay I got it I'm done no that fire starts burning and then it just burns more and more and more you just want more of the Holy Ghost and more of it brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the prize to I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus what beautiful words and you can tell those words just come from his heart he just loves it and he says he says you know he says I used to be this and even here 30 years later he still mentions it I used to be this but I am still pressing towards that Mark for the prize of the High Calling of God and we see this man Saul as I said in in chapter 8 he started making Havoc of the church he started just going after them and and there was this just this hatred that he had for these people that didn't believe like him and he saw that this cult maybe was spreading and he's on his way to Damascus which is north of Jerusalem we see that that all of this what he would call a mess all of this stuff started in Jerusalem maybe in this Upper Room and then it went out and all of a sudden there's thousands of people who are following this this ministry of this man who's dead now and they're saying that he rose again and now it's starting to spread outside the city of Jerusalem and he sees that this place in Damascus this is a place a high population center for the Jews and so he goes and and he wants to kind of quarantine this place Jerusalem kind of like covid you know they had the coveted shutdowns and they shut down all the flights and all that here's what Paul is doing he wants to just just isolate it to them then we can kill them all in here put them in jail rather than having this squirt out and and then we have to chase them down all over the place so so Paul is he's looking how can we stop this and the problem in Saul's mind was you have this bunch of people who are following this man that was indicted convicted sentenced and executed put in the grave and now they're saying that this man raised from the dead how can this be true now it's it's proven Paul would say no no this is proven that this man didn't raise from the dead this was you know I've got the evidence here we've got witnesses that he didn't in fact you know this man Jesus was propagating this this prophecy before he died and that's maybe where where all and then it was he said it enough times Jesus said it enough time so people could jot it down so this was going around that Jesus had prophesied of his death I'll redo Matthew 16 21 quickly it says this from the time from that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day now there's many scriptures of this prophecy being given openly so so many could hear it not the least of these is Matthew chapter 12 verse 40. it says Jesus talk and says this for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth so Jesus had prophesied that this was going to happen so so you have to look at it from Saul's perspective he's like okay he prophesied it now these disciples they're going to go and they're going to make it happen right so in Matthew 28 verse 12. I think we should read this one this is after Jesus died after he rose from the dead Matthew 28 verse 12 and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor's ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day wow this is a rumor and look how this rumor stuck and this must have surely was in Saul's mind or else he wouldn't have been able to justify what he's doing and how this a rumor like that and like the Bible says here it's it's probably reported under this day maybe 2000 years later how a rumor or a lie can stick with someone their whole life it can be said and it can be an exaggeration and then that said about that person and then people want to believe often want to believe that lie and then it's told from here to here to here and that person has that stigma for their whole lives even if it never happened it's a perfect example right here in the scriptures do you remember um it's in the Deep College to the deep that video when the the uh the people are coming in the prayer line and there was this nervous woman that came up there and brother Branham said something like there's a dark shadow over you and and he says I see he says it's a lie he said someone has told a lie about you they called you a witch and it was making it was just ruining her health and and she and she had a heart problem because of it and brother Brown said don't worry about that he says he said you know that's that's that's what's causing your heart problems go and and be healed or and recover whatever it was that lady had a lie was told about her and how those things they just stay with us and their rumors and you hear them today you hear them about brother Brianna many of us people have told rumors about us and and it's like you know what somebody told someone told that about me 30 years ago and it's not it's just not true but then it'll creep up it'll pop up and it'll go down and then and then it'll come but we should be so so careful so this trip as Saul he's heard these stories and this trip to Damascus is it's a long way it's not just over to Bethlehem it's a ways up there I don't know brother why what is a few days probably back then I would say something like that so so Saul's going and this hatred is just building in him and you know how you you stew about stuff you know you might somebody you might think that somebody did you wrong or you might think about about somebody that that maybe lied or did or stole something or took money and and it just it builds within you and you don't talk to that person you know how it is we've all done it right yeah we've all done it and and you think well I'm gonna I'm gonna tell him this or I'm gonna tell her that and and you get this whole scenario in your mind if if she says this I'm going to say that and and this and this and this and this well how come it never works out that way it never works out the way that we have it in our minds how how this scenario and that's what happened with this man Saul thank God so he is he's going and it's building and it's building and he's he gets almost he gets almost to this place Damascus and he's gonna stop by and he's going to get these papers from the Sanhedrin I assuming is and I'm going to take them out he needs permission to do it acts chapter 9 verse 1. by the way don't worry I'm not even going to get close to finished so we'll we'll stop when we stop and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went under the high priest now notice Saul's a leader here he's a young man but he's a leader and he had access to the high priest and he had he had the confidence of the high priest and the call and the high priest had enough confidence in him to write these letters this permission and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem who was it was you sister Debbie who was talking about the way was it sister Amelia yeah so so sister Emily is out there and overheard her talking about this the way and that they they weren't called Christians yet that word has not been invented so this is this is the way I'm not quoting the Mandalorian if anybody probably don't but brother Joe you laughed but but anyways this that's what they call them of this way and so uh he's going and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly they're shined let me go back to that one I want to make sure I read every word that if you found any in this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound to Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly they're shined round about him a light from heaven now later on when Paul was telling this story to this King Agrippa he's the grandson of King Herod um he tells it that this happened in the middle of the day and he said that this light later on as I said this this light was brighter than the sun that struck him down and notice it says there it says and suddenly so this happened this was a surprise he's just going along and he's getting fired up in Damascus maybe is out in the distance and he's going and all of a sudden Wham everything changes you know we talk about testimonies a lot and we love to hear each other's testimony and we love to give our own testimonies some people give their hearts you know there's just something inside of them pulling and then um telling them to go to church and then and then when there's an altar call we find them at the altar and and they may be weeping and and then something changes in their life we saw that last night where there's many that came to the Altar and I've still been getting testimonies about how that that that changed them coming to the Altar and then there's then there's other times that we've seen that that people can they might get a disease they might get heart disease they might get cancer or something like that and then all of a sudden they get serious about the Lord there was a there was when I was in Jeffersonville I got a phone call somebody had been watching YouTube and he was just searching religion or something and he came to brother branham's sermon on the token and he started listening to that and wow I like what this guy is saying so he got through and then he so he Googled it and he found our phone number he called and and uh it got sent to me he said I want to talk to somebody about the ministry he says he says I just want to give my heart to the Lord the phone called came to me I picked up the phone there was no hello from him that wasn't anything I said hello this is Daniel Evans he said I need the token what a way to start a conversation so started talking with them and the brother was just sincere man he was first class and and I caught he was living in Pennsylvania I called up a pastor a friend of mine there and the brother baptized him in the name of the Lord and you know when people first come to the Lord there's this sweet innocence that you see especially someone that that hasn't been around and I noticed in this brother and there was another brother that the same thing happened a similar phone call a similar thing someone I think gave him a track and he called and um he just fell in love with the Lord Jesus and both of these brothers the one brother's name is Adam the other one is Craig um Craig lived in Alaska and Adam as I said lived in Pennsylvania but they saw they would see how the Bible teaches and then they they really enjoyed brother branham's message they saw brother Brandon's message taught and then they would ask brother you know brother Branham taught against denominations and he said boy every time I listen to him he's against denominations he said man it seems like there's a lot of denominations out there and people that believe brother Brianna I was like huh really and both both these brothers said that and they they look they have this innocent way of looking and they say well the segregation this this group believes this and this group believes this and he said brother they're in the same town and I can drive across town in like seven minutes how come they're not in the same church that's like brother hey uh when you figure that out you tell me um then uh another another one that called one time so so they just it was witnessed to them so another one that called one time it was someone that saw a billboard and it had our website on there they went to the website it was a it was a girl young lady and she called I believe she was in Mobile Alabama I'm not positive about that but it was an Air Force Base there and she was in the Air Force and she called up and she said yeah she says I I started studying your website and she said um this teaching on the godhead she said I have a group of Christian friends she said would you teach our Bible study on the phone I said yeah I'd love to do that so they would call in and there was this group this group of soldiers these Air Force people and we'd have a Bible studies we talked we talked about whatever subject they wanted to and we talked about the godhead and and how that when you have the Trinity there's there's a problem because when you're praying who are you praying to the father or the son are the two most common you don't see people really praying to the Holy Spirit but how does that work when you have a monotheistic God but it sounds like you have two here so so we went through that and it was really successful then we went into the serpent seed and that's what really got them so there's a couple of that little bible study tonight one I believe um I think she's at brother Yancey's church and the other one um I don't know where he is but just a group of people just just gave their hearts to the Lord just so open and so so willing to hear and willing to understand these things and that's the same thing that happened to this Ethiopian that was out in in the desert he was reading this he's like man I just don't understand this and then this man of God came and said well why don't you understand it explained it and then the brother gave his heart to the Lord verse number four now he had just seen this light and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecuteth it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks this is a this is a big time scripture right here they're all big time but this one there's just so much into it there was something about this Pharisee that knew this was God speaking to him this miracle he had fell on the ground and he was a he was afraid he was blind he started shaking and he says who are you Lord he knew that this one speaking to him was a supernatural being it wasn't just falling down and hitting your head it was something big and when he said I am Jesus whom you are persecuting you can imagine the fear that came on this man this is the one that I wanted to destroy this is the one that I didn't think was real and now he's speaking to me and he's speaking to me out of this light we just look at the significance of this moment and a few scriptures later we're gonna we're gonna see that it was in fact Christ that was speaking right there I think we already know that anyways let me read this quote to you from Brother Branham he says this the presence of God unrecognized he says when the light the pillar of Fire smote Paul down on the road to Damascus he recognized that he was in the presence of God now that Hebrew would have never called any other Spirit Lord besides he know that he was the that was the same Pillar of Fire that led his people out of the wilderness he said Lord who are you Saul Saul why persecuted thou me he said I am Jesus Jesus said I come from God and I return to God he was that fire that was in the burning bush that led Moses through the Wilderness and he returned back to that and now here he was on the road down to Damascus was stricken down I want to read another scripture that you've maybe never considered that's first Timothy chapter 6 verse 13. listen to this same Apostle speaking he says this I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keepeth this commandment without spot unrebukable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ which in his time he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the King of Kings and the Lord of lords now listen to this who only hath immortality so there's no way for the job we can live forever live eternally if it's not for this man Jesus Christ dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom the honor and power Everlasting amen this unapproachable light as Paul said is where this Christ dwells for time's sake I'm going to now let's do it we got time First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1. moreover brother and I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also you are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain for I delivered unto you first of all that which I received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures this is the same man that was going to Damascus to kill everybody because they believed this and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve and after that he was seen above 500 Brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep after that he was seen of James then of all the apostles we're talking about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus here and I like this and here's Paul and last of all he was seen of me also as one born out of due time so Paul is saying that my experience on that road to Damascus where this light came in and spoke to me it is the same as you all when you walked with him and talked with him and saw him the resurrected Christ I have the same experience because I met him on this road and he trembling back to acts six I mean back to Acts 9. verse 6. and he trembling and astonished said Lord what will thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do now here right here in this scripture here is the evidence of Paul's conversion you know you hear about people giving their hearts to the Lord and Paul says Lord right here he's converted sister Shirley he's it's the old Paul's done he says I believe him now and he is addressing him as Lord he says Lord now look at it now look at a converted sinner what will you have me to do we see Paul under his own confession he's convert converted there and now as we when we give our hearts to the lord it's not Lord what can you do for me when we come to the altar or we may be praying or we may we may be on the road to Damascus and struck down but now it's it's Lord what would you have me do I'll stop doing this I'll stop doing that I'll start doing this I'll start doing whatever you want me to do the conversion of a sinner and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man okay since it's a Bible study we've got to stop right here for a minute this is an important one yeah this is what probably most Scholars say here is an absolute contradiction in the Bible I'm going to tell you why they say that let me read it again and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man brother if you could put an acts 22 9 for me brother Branham answered this question on questions and answers somebody asked him this question now look at that look at right here now let me read Acts 9 7 again you look up there and when the man journeyed with me stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man acts 22 9 says this and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me it says they heard the voice says they didn't hear the voice all right seems like a contradiction right do you know the answer I don't either sorry sorry I don't have to sorry to lift you up now I can come up with a solution that would work but I flat out don't know brother random someone asked him you know what brother Brown said of course I would know if he said he said I don't know he did he said you know he said he said if you don't know just say you don't know and and that's this is one of those things no it's not a contradiction this Bible is inspired and true from Genesis to revelation and there's many you can look up many different explanations to why this seems to contradict which one is correct I don't know so I wanted to mention that if you're ever faced with that that question verse number eight and Saul arose from the Earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and when he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink now this is a serious time for Paul was he fasting or was he depressed and upset I don't know but we know he didn't eat or drink and imagine how he felt during this space of three days he must have felt so bad I bet you Stephen kept coming to his mind and just just struggling with that Lord what have I done I mean I make little mistakes and I I just I feel terrible this was a Whopper that the the Apostle made he was he was the chief persecutor of God's people and you'll notice that Jesus said when Jesus spoke to him he said Saul Saul why persecute us thou me Jesus was not on the Earth we don't know if Paul ever knew Jesus we don't know if he was ever in a ever in a in a meeting we don't know anything we don't know there's no record of Paul ever seeing him well no we do have a record I just read it he didn't see him until he was resurrected in the light so we know Paul was not never there but how could Jesus say you're persecuting me it was because that he was persecuting his people so we need to be careful whoever that we're talking to or talking about or or in any way you're against Christ you're not against Joe Miller you're not against Daniel Evans you're against him so we should always use caution and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananias and to him said the Lord in a vision ananias he said behold I'm here Lord I might want to go backwards you know what let me just read it in the good book here um it says here in verse 5. let's go back to verse five did I skip that it says this and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul saw why persecute us thou me and he said who art thou Lord and said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks I want to stop there for a second I've given the explanation of what that is it's a very important scripture to me when he says saw Saul why persecute it stop me it's hard for thee to kick against the Pricks but that word kick against the Pricks if you look I believe it's in the Scofield I'm not sure but that word Pricks is also called goads goads and a goad is something that you prod cattle with so when when he said it's hard for you to kick against the Pricks he's saying Saul I have been trying to hurt you too to the gospel you in your way of understanding in in your way of believing yeah you're educated you have you have a PhD yes you've grown up in this message yes you know all of these things but it's hard for you because I'm trying to move you and you kick against me this this goad is a it's it's instrument about this long it's a stick that's got a point on the end usually it's a point made of brass back then it's it's pointy and it's got a hook that comes back and when when they're trying to get the oxes to go into the shoot or wherever they poke them to get them to go and these oxes will kick back or a cow will kick back and they're just fighting against the one that's trying to push him in there and when they try to fight against them they probably get hurt worse it would be better if we would just go where God is leading us instead of being like Saul here instead of being so caught up in our way of thinking but no Jesus is like come on can't you see I've been trying to hurt you and you just kick against me and he trembling and astonish said Lord what will that have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do and the man which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man and Saul Rose from the Earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and he was there for three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananias and to him said the Lord in a vision ananias and he said behold I'm here Lord you know one of the things I'll stop right there for a second one of the things that I've heard so much growing up is that God will only speak to his prophet how many times have we heard that God will only speak to his prophet and then it'll go out that changed at the day of Pentecost now God speaks to the individual and we see this man ananias we don't know anything about you know we don't see him much in the scriptures he's just a Christian but he was on such a relationship with God that Jesus is going to speak to ananias right here I like ananias this isn't the one that was married to Sapphira they're two different ones and there was a certain disciple at Damascus named ananias and to him said the Lord in the vision ananias and he said behold I am here and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayeth I'd like to preach a sermon on that one day for behold he prayeth how sweet I'm hearing his prayers look at the import importance God places on prayer here and at this point he doesn't say that he's a messenger to the Gentiles he doesn't say that he's going to write most of the New Testament he doesn't say any of that he just says he's praying and had seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight now the Lord Jesus is telling ananias that hey Saul's already heard about this and he's expecting you then ananias answered well let me let me read this and he had seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then ananias answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem he's like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa this guy's big time this guy is putting people in prison he's he's sentencing people to death he's I mean he's dangerous and I'm gonna go to him and he's got the authority here in my city in Damascus from the chief priest to do whatever he wants to us and here he hath The Authority from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer from my name's sake wow can you imagine this conversation first of all ananias is talking to the same resurrected Jesus Christ that Paul was talking to and I think about as I was I was sitting in the office there and I was I was reading this again and I was I was like wait a minute look at the difference between the Lord Jesus and the angel Gabriel I was thinking whoa ananiah said I'm afraid of this guy Gabriel comes down and talks to Zechariah John the Baptist dad and he comes down and he says Zechariah God has heard your prayers God is going to send you a son and and he's going to be this great person and Zachariah says how can this happen because I'm old and Gabriel says listen you're not going to speak a word until this child is born just rips him and he hear the Lord Jesus look at the tender hand of the Lord he says no ananias he's going to do great things and I just compared those two and and the Lord Jesus is the one Gabriel answers to and here here is just look at that Spirit difference there and ananias went his way and entered the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that hath appeared unto thee in the way as thou Hast as thou came it hath as Alchemist hath sent me that thou mightest received thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost do you see why we call each other brother and sister I love this part brother Saul how did he say that when he went to him this guy's big time did he say brother Saul God bless you I doubt it or was it uh uh brother Saul uh or or was it brother Saul I would have liked to seen that greeting right there brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest received thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost and I want to point out something else in your King James Bible if you look at that verse 17 right there it won't show it on here but verse 17 it reads like this and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus do you see how even is in italics you know what that means it means that that word was added to the text that the King James translators it doesn't make sense Hebrew does not directly translate to English and here Greek doesn't directly translate to English it doesn't make sense if you do that so these translators they have to input words in there to make it make sense I'm not I when I read my Bible I read different translations I really like the English Standard Version so I'm not a King James only type of person but I do really appreciate the King James that they they'll put that in italics just to say hey we added this just so you know so it'll make sense that's what you get when we get a Bible study um let me read that again and ananias went his way and entered the house and putting his hands on him said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou acamest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost I I do appreciate this ananias again thinking of brother Jonathan's sermon this morning ananias didn't judge Saul I mean in in you can imagine these conversations among the Believers running him down Sam what a creep this guy is and how evil he is and all of this but here comes ananias gives him the right hand of Fellowship says brother Saul further and immediately that fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight for with and arose and was baptized now most importantly in that scripture we see Paul Saul was baptized just like any other believers of Jesus he had to come the same way now one thing that is very interesting to me we don't see how Saul reacted to receiving the Holy Ghost I don't think it's anywhere in the Bible I haven't found it how this man saw did he speak in tongues did he did it just did he just accept it and the Holy Ghost came in we don't really see that testimony did it happen right here when he was baptized we don't know but we know that the prophecy was that you would receive the Holy Ghost and we know if anybody had the Holy Ghost it was it was Paul but in this I don't necessarily see a place where he received it and how he received it which encourages me because I can just see that everyone receives it in different ways and I believe this man saw I don't know how it entered into him by by the laying on the hands or whatever it was but I do appreciate the author here Luke maybe not putting it in there I don't know if he did it on purpose I don't know if Paul said don't do it but from my studies and brother Lyle maybe you'll get to it when you come to it I haven't seen the actual time like when Peter received it we know the actual time when the disciples received it when Cornelius received it when all these ones received it we see the time but not in in this brother and I do uh I also want to mention as as we're our times winding down wow I uh didn't even get as far as I thought um I want to mention this that it says here and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight for with and arose and was baptized so the Apostle here was healed at that moment these scales fell off and he received his sight but I've heard so many times a statement that it sounds really good but we have to be careful when things just sound good and this one sounds really good I have heard when people are praying for healing or their their their seeking their healing and God starts to do something I've heard people say that God doesn't do things halfway that you'll receive it'll be completely gone that's not according to scripture and I I know that we we think that oh this is this is Jesus and Jesus healed Saul and and and the scales fell down or um this person was healed of cancer but but then later on they get cancer again friends we are all going to if God doesn't come everyone in this room is going to get sick and die every one of us if Jesus doesn't come so when when we say things like that no God can heal us and he does heal us of cancer I've seen people completely healed of cancer but I've also seen people like my mother who was honored deathbed Stephanie was there Daniel was there my mom could not even get up out of a chair and walk she was so bad stage four breast cancer she couldn't move she couldn't raise her arms she couldn't do hardly anything and we were there we were we were having a worship service and we prayed for my mom and the Lord came in and healed her honey she stood up you remember she hadn't stood up for weeks she was so bad so eaten up with cancer she stood up that arm that had been six months that she couldn't raise she raised raised both of those arms up and was worshiping the Lord with us the next day not a week later the next day she hiked in Charlestown State Park she hadn't been able to walk in months she couldn't she was out hiking and going yet later God took her with cancer but it was still to the glory of God so when when people say those things they mean well but they're not necessarily scripture Galatians chapter 6. says this verse 11. this is Paul the Apostle again writing a letter and he says this you see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand it's a little hint that Paul struggled with his eyesight from that point to the rest of his life he even says he did in other places sometimes he says he has a thorn in his flesh some people say it was his eyesight because we know that that he did struggle with his eyesight other people say it was sickness I don't really know what it was but Paul we do know after he was healed and he was healed he struggled with his eyesight so we see that God has his perfect way of doing it and his ways are not our ways his ways are perfect our ways aren't Let's uh let's have the musicians come friends I'm sorry I was so slow I just love this this book so much brother Lyle sorry my friend I'm gonna have to we're gonna have to to come back to this this one and when he had received meat he was strengthened then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God but all that hurt him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on his name on this name in Jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound under the chief priests but Saul increased the more look at the overcomer all of the stuff that it was set against solid and he could have just quit quit and went back to the synagogue but he stayed with it God bless the Apostle Paul God bless his life then Saul was certain days with the disciples that were Damascus and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues that he is the Son of God Amen way to go Saul keep doing it but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on the name on this name in Jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound into the chief priests but Saul increased the more in strength this is his own people the Christians are are saying this but Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus proving that this is very Christ all the other translations that I looked at says proving that this is the very Christ and after that many days were fulfilled the Jews took counsel to kill him you know how soon are friends forsake us yeah this is just right after Paul got his conversion all of his friends in the synagogues all of his fellow Pharisees they're right there and they they turned against him and even so they conspired to kill him hmm I don't see any of Paul's friends old friends the Pharisees sticking with them there may have been some but they're not that I can see they're not recorded but they're laying in weight was known of Saul these people are trying to kill him and they watched the gates day and night to kill him then the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in the basket ah he's starting to get accepted by the disciples now and when Saul was come to Jerusalem he is saved to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believe not that he was a disciple look at that and Saul was come to Jerusalem and he said he was he wanted to join himself with the disciples but they were afraid of him and believed not that he was a disciple for heaven's sakes these are the people that are casting out Devils these are the people that are causing uh cripples to walk these are the people that are raising the dead and they can't believe that this man was converted and there's thousands of converts just coming all the time and they can't believe that this man's Saul of Tarsus is a convert that's how bad he was I mean he was worse than the guy at the gate called Beautiful when his in his crippled this man saw they couldn't even they couldn't believe that I stood up when I read that come on are you serious all right I'll close with Barnabas I like Barnabas and Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus now remember Barnabas this is the guy that sold his land and gave it gave it all to the disciples he was somebody that had great respect and look at how this man that had such respect among the disciples he vouched for him he said no he's a servant he's a servant of God and when he was with them coming in and going out of Jerusalem and he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem then he spiked boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay in let's close there I like this let me read that verse number 27 one more time but Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way he was he was given the testimony hey here's what happened to him here's Paul's testimony how he had seen the Lord and the Lord in the way that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of the Lord Jesus so here's brother Barnabas and he's saying oh this guy's the real deal he's a Christian he loves the Lord he's been preaching the same thing that we've been preaching he's been successful in doing it and by the way he's got one of the most amazing testimonies that you've ever heard in your life that's this man Saul I got Jordan back there laughs think about Barnabas think about that great man and here he is laying his reputation on the line for this man's song and we see now that the Lord had blessed him and and what a great ministry what a great ministry this man had and it's starting right here in the book of Acts chapter 9. would you love it don't you love it this is how it all got started we're a Christian Church right here this is a Christian Church these all started 2 000 years ago in Jerusalem and now they're spreading up to Damascus we got we got ananias up there and Damascus and and Barnabas up there feels good feels good to have have a church that we can Fellowship in that that we can worship in and it all started right there friends I'll get to I'll finish the book of Acts chapter 9 on Wednesday let's stand [Music] Jordan [Music] [Applause] [Music] just [Music] foreign [Music] all realize [Music] it was in prayer for the Andy Andre would you come in close in prayer my brother foreign [Applause] [Music] so when we hear about the ax what what our boy was saying about the apostles it can encourage us to to have Grace toward each other that means I can see that Apostles they were not perfect they were men so even What the Lord Has Done for Paul it was difficult for them to accept Paul in their among I mean among them so you see so that means like they were humans but also filled with the Holy Ghost so that doesn't mean when you have the Holy Ghost you don't go to trials you don't have that's why we have differences in the message because we are humans so what we can be sure that the Holy Spirit who started to work will complete it in US [Music] amen do you have any father you are the same yesterday today and forever oh God we want to be like a nice but you know God that's what we want to be we want to be like the disciple who are so dedicated that you can come to him that he was so we were so real to him that he was a friend talking to another friend oh Lord Jesus that's what we want to be we want to be like you Lord Jesus we want to work with you like you work with the disciples in in my thought when you were talking to them and

trespasses our unbelief in Jesus name amen [Music] this is I do appreciate what Brother Andy just said that that we should have patience with each other these these were people and as he said they were filled with the Holy Spirit but they still couldn't believe this guy saw was one of them I I really appreciate that so friends God bless you all I pray that you got a blessing from first part of
