[28:23] give and in whatever Lord sometimes we
[28:26] we might just have that might in our
[28:28] pocket but you saw Lord that when that's
[28:31] that sister gave that little mic and you
[28:34] said that meant more Lord so what
[28:36] everyone has given Lord to the use Lord
[28:38] of what is is good for the body of
[28:41] Christ for this building whatever it
[28:43] might be needed for Lord we just

[28:58] smile while you do it
[28:59] God will bless you there's been times
[29:02] when you've looked in what you have in
[29:03] your hand and say Lord and God looks at
[29:06] it and says it's like two fishes and

[32:20] said that where everybody's talking
[32:21] about climate change
[32:23] but the church is looking for a change
[32:26] in this body and then the dead in Christ
[32:29] shall rise we'll see those that have
[32:31] gone on
[32:32] the dead in Christ shall rise rise first
[32:35] and those of us which are alive and
[32:37] remain shall not hinder those which are
[32:41] dead which sleep and then we will all go
[32:44] together and meet the Lord Jesus in the
[32:47] air

[36:49] amen
[36:51] God bless each and every one of you
[36:54] I greet you all in the precious name of
[36:56] the Lord Jesus Christ and it's always
[36:59] pleasure to be here and to fellowship
[37:02] with each and every one of you in in the
[37:04] worship and Adoration of our Lord Jesus
[37:08] Christ
[37:09] I just I'm so honored to be here to be
[37:13] behind the sacred desk and and for the
[37:17] confidence that our our pastor brother
[37:19] Daniel Evans has
[37:22] I I don't take that lightly at all
[37:25] I feel you know even coming in here I
[37:29] could feel the presence of the Lord I
[37:31] know somebody brought their liquor fire
[37:34] somebody came here believing not because
[37:37] uh we're gonna sing or worship or we're
[37:41] going to hear a man but because there
[37:43] was going to be a supernatural thing
[37:45] happen in this place
[37:47] um
[37:48] and every time we come into this place
[37:50] every time we assemble together we know
[37:53] that there has to
[37:55] be something happen in our lives
[37:58] something has to happen every time we
[38:01] have that little expectation we know
[38:02] that God is going to appear on the scene
[38:06] amen so I came here expecting trusting
[38:09] in the Lord that he has something in
[38:12] store for us amen
[38:14] um let us go straight to the scriptures
[38:16] if you would like
[38:18] if you would like to turn with me to
[38:20] Luke 11
[38:21] chapter 11 and verse 1 and we're going
[38:25] to be reading Luke 11 1 and then we're
[38:28] going to jump to Matthew 6. verses 5.
[38:33] to 13. whenever you have it just go
[38:36] ahead and say Amen I spoke to brother
[38:39] um Octavio yesterday and he made sure to
[38:42] tell me to greet brother Daniel and the
[38:44] church all of Jericho Tabernacle they
[38:47] just um enjoy our brother Daniel and his
[38:50] ministry and and um we're just so
[38:53] thankful for that amen
[38:55] all right let's uh go to 11 1 of Luke it
[39:00] says
[39:01] and it came to pass
[39:03] that as he was praying in a certain
[39:06] place
[39:07] when he seized one of his disciples said
[39:10] unto him Lord
[39:12] teach us to pray
[39:14] as John also taught his disciples
[39:18] and if you would like to turn with me to
[39:20] Matthew
[39:22] 6 5 and 13 5-13 it says now now they
[39:28] asked him this question Luke and and
[39:31] right away right after those
[39:34] scriptures or right after those verses
[39:36] Jesus says okay this is this is the
[39:39] template this is how you pray and he
[39:42] began to to to say the prayer Our Father
[39:46] which art in heaven and Luke he he shows
[39:50] them uh or he
[39:53] or in Matthew Matthew shows a different
[39:56] way of what Jesus said when he was about
[39:59] to talk about the Lord's Prayer he says
[40:02] when thou prayests thou shall not be as
[40:05] Hypocrites are for they love to pray
[40:08] standing in synagogues and in corners of
[40:10] streets that they may be seen of men
[40:13] verily I say unto you that they have
[40:16] their reward but thou when thou prayest
[40:19] enter into thy closet
[40:22] and when thou has shut thy door pray to
[40:25] the Father which is in secret and thy
[40:29] father which seeth in in secret shall
[40:32] reward thee openly
[40:35] what a beautiful promise he said Our
[40:38] Father which is in secret
[40:40] he will see your secret prayer and he
[40:43] will reward you openly
[40:45] but when ye pray use not vain
[40:48] repetitions as heathens do for they
[40:51] think that they shall be heard for their
[40:54] um for their much speaking be not ye
[40:57] therefore like unto them for your father
[41:00] knoweth what ye have need of before you
[41:04] ask him isn't that amazing he already
[41:07] knows what you need he just needs a
[41:09] little petition he needs you to go and
[41:12] confess it to him but he already knows
[41:14] your heart and we have to remember that
[41:17] um and then also says after this manner
[41:20] there therefore pray ye Our Father which
[41:24] art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy
[41:27] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[41:30] as it is in heaven give us this day our
[41:33] daily bread forgive us our depths as we
[41:35] forgive our debtors and lead us not into
[41:38] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[41:41] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[41:44] the glory forever amen
[41:46] let us bow our heads
[41:49] Heavenly Father
[41:51] Lord we're just so thankful that you've
[41:53] allowed us to be here once again father
[41:57] that we can be under your presence
[42:00] Lord unworthy as we are father but yet
[42:03] we want to give you all the honor and
[42:05] the glory Lord Jesus we come here for
[42:07] more of you father each and every person
[42:10] that has arrived in this place father
[42:12] you know their heart father you know
[42:14] their motive and their objective and you
[42:17] know that that many of them are Desiring
[42:20] more and more of a closer walk with you
[42:23] father God lord and you said ask in my
[42:26] name and and it shall be done for you if
[42:30] ye abide in me and my words and you ask
[42:33] whatever you want Lord so we come here
[42:36] asking father petitioning our needs unto
[42:39] you father knowing it's all for your
[42:41] honor and Glory I father I ask that you
[42:44] just bring your Holy Spirit and and have
[42:47] the preeminence father we subject
[42:49] ourselves into thee father we ask all
[42:52] these things in the precious name of
[42:54] Jesus Christ amen and amen
[42:57] amen you may be seated
[43:00] um it's such an honor like I said just
[43:03] to be here and to fellowship with each
[43:05] and every one of you
[43:07] um my sermon today it's a very simple
[43:09] one it's a very simple topic but I had
[43:12] it impressed in my heart for quite a
[43:15] while
[43:16] um it's the realities of Prayer
[43:19] there's realities in prayer and and a
[43:22] lot of times we
[43:24] it becomes very religious right it
[43:27] becomes a very monotonous thing and it's
[43:29] almost a sacrifice to go and to shut
[43:32] yourself away with God and and speak to
[43:37] in in natural you speak to nothing
[43:39] you're just there and it's quiet and
[43:42] you're you're trying to make
[43:43] conversation with something that might
[43:46] be there that's the natural way of
[43:48] thinking about it and a lot of times
[43:50] it's easy to get into that monotony and
[43:53] speak and not really know what you're
[43:55] saying but Jesus says don't don't do any
[43:58] vain babblings don't be don't try to
[44:01] make your prayers nice it's a prayer is
[44:05] a heartfelt thing
[44:07] I've heard a brother say you don't pray
[44:09] with your lips you pray with your heart
[44:12] so no matter what our prayer says
[44:15] outside it's the heart that God is
[44:17] looking at and and the Bible says he
[44:20] says he is already he already knows what
[44:23] you need before you even ask him
[44:25] but he needs you to go to the source and
[44:29] knock on the door
[44:31] and be persistent
[44:33] and ask him every single day until your
[44:36] petition is recognized
[44:39] but remember as you pray remember that
[44:43] God has already known your petition
[44:45] before you even ask
[44:47] before you even ask God God is already
[44:50] there saying son ask me and I'll do it
[44:54] and I I try to understand why why does
[44:57] God want us to ask him
[45:00] and I started to think about I don't
[45:03] know why in my life I always encounter
[45:06] people that want to
[45:09] um
[45:10] I don't know if debate or or go against
[45:13] the word
[45:15] and and believe me they are well studied
[45:18] the people that I talk to
[45:19] they're not these like uh they just
[45:22] don't know these people know the Quran
[45:25] they know the book of Buddha the monk
[45:27] book and they've read the Bible three
[45:29] times and and they know all of these
[45:32] things so when they go they have their
[45:34] ammunition
[45:36] and a lot of times one of the most
[45:38] common questions that I get is is that
[45:41] if God is so good
[45:44] why why is he allowing that little child
[45:47] to starve
[45:48] why is he allowing that that baby to to
[45:52] have cancer and he never knew sin
[45:54] why is all those things happening
[45:57] and of course people have their their
[46:00] ideas I'm not going to go and I'm not
[46:01] going to tell you all these things but
[46:04] they have these questions
[46:07] and then they also have a rebuttal if
[46:09] they if they say well you know what God
[46:10] allows those things and it's actually
[46:13] um sin that allowed all those things to
[46:16] happen and that's why we're going
[46:18] through those things and then they say
[46:19] well
[46:20] why does that happen and then we hear of
[46:23] a divine intervention over here
[46:25] so also why can God answer a prayer here
[46:28] or answer
[46:30] um divinely over here but yet over here
[46:33] he doesn't do it here
[46:36] and for me
[46:39] I ask myself I say why does God need us
[46:42] to pray
[46:44] when he already knows what we need
[46:47] when that person is starving out there
[46:49] the homeless out there is is suffering
[46:52] out there
[46:54] he already knows their need
[46:57] but he needs a connection from Heaven to
[47:00] Earth
[47:01] and I think that's the biggest
[47:02] difference
[47:04] between divine intervention here and
[47:07] nothing here it's the a matter of who's
[47:10] intervening on Earth
[47:12] who's pleading with God on Earth because
[47:15] God his license to the Earth is you
[47:20] in in the beginning God God created
[47:23] everything and for some reason I'm
[47:24] jumping my notes like crazy but I'm just
[47:26] gonna go with what God wants here
[47:30] but in the beginning God created
[47:33] everything
[47:34] and if you notice when he created the
[47:37] beast from the field he says let us
[47:39] create Beasts of the Earth
[47:43] so so their source
[47:46] was the Earth
[47:48] and what sustained him was their source
[47:51] which was the field that they came from
[47:53] when he said let us create whales and
[47:56] these great creatures he said out of the
[47:58] water
[48:00] these that was their source of their
[48:02] creation was out of the water out of the
[48:05] Dust he grabbed the dust and he began to
[48:07] create those things that were already on
[48:10] the ground that were already in the
[48:11] water all those minerals
[48:13] all those things he already created it
[48:16] but when he came to man he didn't do
[48:18] that
[48:20] he didn't say let us create man from
[48:22] this or from that he said let us create
[48:25] man in our image
[48:27] that was a spirit man
[48:30] so what is the source of man
[48:32] what is the source of our whole being is
[48:37] God
[48:39] the source of the whale is the water the
[48:41] source of the Beast is the field but the
[48:43] source of man is God himself
[48:46] so he created a spirit man and then
[48:49] right when he created it and he said let
[48:52] him have dominion over this Earth
[48:54] let him have that Dominion
[48:58] so then he he created man just from him
[49:01] then he said now you're going to rule
[49:04] over the Earth and whenever he was going
[49:06] to allow him to rule over the Earth he
[49:09] said let us form him now out of the
[49:12] Earth Earth
[49:13] out of the dirt
[49:15] so this man was a spirit man yet he
[49:18] connected him to the very thing he was
[49:20] going to have dominion over
[49:23] so now this man is connected to God and
[49:25] he's connected to the dirt
[49:28] and and God allows that to happen
[49:32] because that is God's legal or licensed
[49:35] way to work in this earth
[49:38] because he didn't say let us have
[49:40] dominion no he said let them
[49:43] but my spirit's going to be in them
[49:45] and that's how I work through them
[49:49] because they are part of me and as they
[49:52] dwell and they have dominion I am
[49:54] working through them
[49:56] but it was it was sin that separated all
[49:59] those things and what happened was sin
[50:01] separated the dirt from the spirit
[50:05] where God's spirit could not even if it
[50:08] touched the mountain nobody better touch
[50:10] it
[50:11] only only sanctified people could go
[50:14] into the temple they couldn't even see
[50:17] his Pillar of Fire they were so scared
[50:19] they said let God not speak to us
[50:22] brother Branham said he is two
[50:24] mysterious his spirit
[50:26] so he needed a body he needed you and I
[50:30] so that he could work through those
[50:32] things
[50:33] and so whenever something needs to take
[50:36] place like healing
[50:38] when death is knocking at the door
[50:42] when it seems like things will not
[50:44] change and it's getting worse and worse
[50:47] and worse whether it's sin whether it's
[50:49] it's a sickness there has to be a divine
[50:53] intervention
[50:55] where does that divine intervention come
[50:57] Lord
[50:59] help my brother
[51:01] Lord help me Lord
[51:04] and what happens there is a connection
[51:06] that happens in our lives the God is
[51:10] licensed to say now it's my turn
[51:13] now I get to move because God has or man
[51:17] has called unto me
[51:20] now I can move through him because he
[51:24] connected that way
[51:27] of course there was many things that
[51:28] happened that allowed us to have that of
[51:31] course it was Jesus Christ it says
[51:33] whenever he was baptized the Dove came
[51:36] down and said Heaven and Earth kissed
[51:39] but Jesus paved that way so that
[51:41] whenever you need that comforter
[51:43] whenever you need Jesus Christ all you
[51:46] have to do is call upon his name and
[51:48] he's quick to answer
[51:51] but we have to believe that that that's
[51:53] a reality
[51:56] that's that's it right there
[51:59] if I don't believe that's what all the
[52:02] devil's trying to do is make you
[52:03] disbelieve the word
[52:06] when he get he's attacking the word oh
[52:08] he's attacking my home he's attacking my
[52:10] dog he's attacking this no he's
[52:12] attacking the word
[52:14] and when he attacks the word it causes
[52:17] you to disbelieve
[52:19] when he attacks your your body when he
[52:22] attacks your children what he's making
[52:24] you do is disbelieve the word of God
[52:28] but you we have to stay in that constant
[52:31] communication
[52:34] now Jesus was the greatest human being
[52:36] on Earth
[52:38] there was no man like Jesus Christ
[52:42] people people try to separate the
[52:44] Divinity of God in that man but God says
[52:47] or brother Branham said no he was he was
[52:50] a God man
[52:52] yes he did cry when Lazarus died but he
[52:54] was the same one that said Lazarus come
[52:56] out
[52:57] yes he was the one that was dying but he
[53:00] was the same one that Rose the third day
[53:02] he was the greatest man on Earth
[53:05] the greatest man
[53:07] and and you know what
[53:10] I don't know how I would have reacted if
[53:12] I was there
[53:13] to see him say to the blind sea
[53:18] to see him say to the leper be clean
[53:22] to see him walk on the water
[53:25] I don't know if I would be foolish
[53:27] enough to even say Lord how did you even
[53:29] do that
[53:31] look teach me how to do that I don't
[53:33] know what I would have said
[53:36] but you you get those questions Lord how
[53:39] do you do how did you do that
[53:42] maybe we would have asked him teach us
[53:44] how to do that Lord
[53:47] teach us how to how how to speak and
[53:50] things happen
[53:52] teach us Lord
[53:53] teach me how to speak your word teach me
[53:56] to have that spoken word as brother
[53:58] Branham called it
[54:01] but whenever the disciples after seeing
[54:04] all these things
[54:06] he saw Jesus prayed
[54:09] and when he saw Jesus pray their
[54:12] question wasn't teach us how to walk on
[54:14] the water
[54:15] teach us how to heal the sick he said
[54:18] teach us how to pray Lord
[54:21] my mind is why at that question
[54:25] you're with them for three and a half
[54:27] years
[54:28] and you ask him teach us how to pray
[54:32] I think they had a revelation
[54:35] the Bible says that he was
[54:38] before the sun hours before the sun even
[54:42] came up he was in a secluded place
[54:46] praying
[54:48] for hours
[54:50] in hours
[54:51] says that he would go up to a mountain
[54:53] in a secluded place and pray
[54:57] not in front of everybody not in front
[54:59] of his disciples he would go alone and
[55:02] pray
[55:03] the greatest man on Earth
[55:06] prayed
[55:07] he only had three and a half years of
[55:09] ministry and and he spent his time in
[55:12] prayer
[55:16] I just wanted to use
[55:17] understand that just so that we don't
[55:20] think prayer oh man I don't think I have
[55:22] time
[55:23] oh
[55:25] man that's an investment
[55:27] prayer is an investment
[55:31] he had time to pray and he spent hours
[55:34] and hours and hours in prayer and then
[55:37] in the morning when they would finally
[55:39] wake up he said ah let's go to the town
[55:42] ah let's go let's go to Jerusalem let's
[55:46] go here and whenever he would go and see
[55:48] the leper he'd say be clean
[55:50] the leopard was clean
[55:52] whenever he'd see the blind he said see
[55:54] and they would see
[55:56] they would go and they say oh my
[55:58] daughter is dead oh she's just sleeping
[56:00] rise up
[56:01] my goodness
[56:04] and maybe in their mind they they said
[56:06] man
[56:08] he is spending seconds
[56:11] with man
[56:13] but doing this thing
[56:16] doing this thing all by himself he
[56:19] spends hours
[56:22] and I heard a brother say he says you
[56:25] know what we have to spend hours with
[56:27] God in seconds with man
[56:31] that's why he was able to say those
[56:34] things do those things
[56:36] why he was in connection with God
[56:40] prayer began to be a reality in his life
[56:46] to to where he he's the definition of
[56:49] prayed up
[56:52] he's the definition of preventative
[56:54] maintenance
[56:56] he is that definition
[56:59] a lot of times chaos strikes in our
[57:02] homes and we're there on our knees Lord
[57:04] what are we doing we're cleaning up the
[57:06] mess
[57:07] we didn't have preventative maintenance
[57:09] we're there on prayer and prayer and
[57:12] prayer and prayer and prayer Lord fix
[57:14] this problem that I could have maybe
[57:17] fixed a long time ago
[57:20] but we're here trying to clean up clean
[57:22] up the mess because we weren't in
[57:24] contact with God hey I'm I'm to blame
[57:28] there's many times where I was
[57:30] unprepared for things that
[57:33] were there signs were there but when
[57:35] everything fell I said oh my goodness I
[57:38] could have
[57:39] I could have fixed all of this with just
[57:42] a few little words of Prayer
[57:45] but because I was so busy in my life and
[57:48] things were happening in my life I
[57:50] forgot to give God the glory
[57:53] you spend hours with God you'll you'll
[57:57] spend seconds in your situation
[58:01] or you'll know why that situation is
[58:03] happening
[58:05] you'll be calm in the storm because you
[58:07] know Lord I've been with you
[58:10] Lord I've been praying and I know
[58:13] whatever is happening whatever is taking
[58:16] place I know it's all for your honor and
[58:19] your glory
[58:21] but it's because you're in prayer every
[58:24] single day
[58:27] so they asked him teach us
[58:29] teach us how to pray
[58:32] now
[58:33] um another thing I want to point out is
[58:35] is
[58:37] they asked him teach us how to pray
[58:39] prayer is a learned activity
[58:42] we don't just give our heart to the Lord
[58:44] and then we just know how to talk to the
[58:45] savior
[58:47] it's something that we have to ask God
[58:49] lord teach me how to pray Lord
[58:53] brother Branham whenever he gave his
[58:54] heart to the Lord what did he do he
[58:57] well let me write him a letter
[59:01] how do I get in contact with this person
[59:04] what do I have to write write him a text
[59:06] message
[59:07] where do I go what social media do I go
[59:10] to
[59:11] brother Brandon tried to write him a
[59:13] letter
[59:13] then he went to where he went to a spot
[59:16] and and he he's like okay well they I
[59:19] see them fold their hands I see them get
[59:22] on their knees
[59:24] he didn't know how
[59:26] but when that desperation began to rise
[59:29] up he says I don't know how to talk to
[59:31] you Lord
[59:33] I know there's a special way to talk to
[59:36] you but I need you
[59:39] then God stopped listening to the letter
[59:42] stop listening to the formalities he
[59:45] began to listen to his heart and his
[59:47] Hearts cry and when he heard that God
[59:50] was on the scene
[59:53] but Lord teach me how to pray
[59:56] because prayer isn't this just this
[59:58] little conversation like we would have
[1:00:02] prayer isn't just oh I gotta go talk to
[1:00:05] my buddy
[1:00:07] of course you can be comfortable that
[1:00:09] way
[1:00:10] but you're going to the almighty God
[1:00:15] you're coming into his presence
[1:00:18] you got to know that things are going to
[1:00:21] take place when you begin to speak
[1:00:24] not just from your lips but from your
[1:00:26] heart you have to know that it's not a
[1:00:29] small talk
[1:00:31] because because Jesus even told him he
[1:00:34] said didn't you say Lord Lord but your
[1:00:36] heart was far from me
[1:00:37] man I could talk all day and yet I'm
[1:00:40] still thinking about yesterday at work
[1:00:44] I could be doing all that but God wants
[1:00:47] our full Uninvited undivided attention
[1:00:51] he wants our heart to be poured out
[1:00:54] because he doesn't care what we say he
[1:00:57] doesn't care what we do he cares about
[1:00:59] the heart's desire just like that child
[1:01:02] that was an orphan his mother and his
[1:01:05] father passed away he was living with a
[1:01:08] cruel man
[1:01:10] and one day this man's walked by and he
[1:01:13] sees this little kid saying his ABCs
[1:01:16] a b c d e f g
[1:01:19] he says what is he doing
[1:01:22] son he must have thought son you're
[1:01:25] doing it all incorrect
[1:01:28] he said what are you doing
[1:01:30] he said you know what my mom died my
[1:01:33] father died
[1:01:35] and now I'm living with this man and I'm
[1:01:37] I'm praying for this cruel man
[1:01:39] but I my mom used to pray but I don't
[1:01:42] know how to pray so I learned the ABCs
[1:01:45] so that I can say all the letters in the
[1:01:48] alphabet and God can formulate what's in
[1:01:51] my heart
[1:01:53] it's not the words you say
[1:01:56] it's what's in your heart
[1:01:59] the Bible even says that there's things
[1:02:02] that we can't even utter
[1:02:05] that our mob our words we can't even
[1:02:08] express it maybe we have so much pain
[1:02:12] maybe we have so much need that I I
[1:02:15] don't know what to say but yet the Holy
[1:02:18] Spirit comes and with groanings that we
[1:02:20] don't understand he goes to the father
[1:02:23] with that petition and he says I know
[1:02:25] exactly what she needs
[1:02:27] I know exactly what he needs
[1:02:30] without even saying a word he just wants
[1:02:33] you to go and
[1:02:36] and cry out to him
[1:02:38] and say Lord I need you
[1:02:41] and God will take all that broken up
[1:02:43] English
[1:02:44] broken up Spanish whatever you speak
[1:02:48] he'll take that and he'll formulate to
[1:02:50] to a sweet smelling savior to the to God
[1:02:54] he'll bring that petition even brother
[1:02:56] Branham says when you pray under that
[1:02:58] name of Jesus Christ it's no more you
[1:03:03] it's no more e like I still praying as
[1:03:05] Jesus Christ himself petitioning
[1:03:08] saying Lord I need something and when
[1:03:11] you pray in that name watch out
[1:03:13] mountains
[1:03:15] watch out problem
[1:03:18] watch out sickness it has to move
[1:03:21] it has to change
[1:03:24] but you have to believe he says abide in
[1:03:27] me in my words in you that means you
[1:03:29] have to be in constant communication
[1:03:32] constant dwelling in Christ
[1:03:36] abide in me how can I say Lord Lord I
[1:03:39] need this and he says man you're not
[1:03:41] even abiding in me
[1:03:43] your father your heart so far from me
[1:03:46] yet we say Lord Lord
[1:03:49] Lord I need this Lord I need that
[1:03:51] brother let me tell you this whenever
[1:03:54] you abide in Christ you begin to pray
[1:03:57] his word
[1:04:00] pray his promises over your life not
[1:04:03] even knowing
[1:04:05] maybe it sounds selfish yet God's saying
[1:04:08] you're praying
[1:04:10] what I already spoke
[1:04:12] and I have to honor my word
[1:04:15] brother Branham says in in perseverance
[1:04:18] he said you must first find the will of
[1:04:21] God
[1:04:22] before you can do the will of God
[1:04:25] first you have to find it how do we find
[1:04:28] the will of God
[1:04:30] you must first know what his will is in
[1:04:34] the matter
[1:04:35] and then don't turn it loose
[1:04:38] as the lady said today she was trying to
[1:04:41] get beyond that sound barrier then the
[1:04:45] plane just picks up picks up speed and
[1:04:47] goes on Unlimited
[1:04:50] when it passes the sound barrier brother
[1:04:52] Branham says well when you can pray
[1:04:54] until you pass the doubt barrier
[1:04:58] then you're running free
[1:05:00] you can go on
[1:05:02] then you're there's nothing can bother
[1:05:05] you then
[1:05:06] because you're running free past the
[1:05:09] unbelief
[1:05:10] it's done it's been settled it's all
[1:05:12] over
[1:05:13] when you get Assurance in your heart
[1:05:15] that it's going to be that way you're as
[1:05:18] happy as it already happened
[1:05:21] brother we what happens we have to find
[1:05:25] that will of God
[1:05:28] we another word in other words we have
[1:05:31] to find the mind of Christ
[1:05:33] we have to find the mind of God in the
[1:05:36] matter of Our Lives
[1:05:38] whether it's financially whether it's
[1:05:40] spiritually whether it has to be done
[1:05:42] with your your family your children
[1:05:44] whatever it might be find God in the
[1:05:47] matter
[1:05:49] many times as human beings we try to
[1:05:52] find the hand of God instead of the Mind
[1:05:56] what is the hand it's the works
[1:05:59] we follow the works we follow the
[1:06:01] Miracles we follow those things
[1:06:04] but when you find the mind of God you
[1:06:08] find his ways
[1:06:10] you find what he truly thinks about your
[1:06:13] situation
[1:06:15] what he wants to do with you
[1:06:18] there's a brother that said an amazing
[1:06:21] quote and uh man I'm gonna hold that to
[1:06:24] me he said more work is done by prayer
[1:06:27] than work itself
[1:06:30] we try to find the hands of God we try
[1:06:33] to do the work we try to do this but
[1:06:35] sometimes God says you know what you got
[1:06:37] to invest time in prayer
[1:06:40] and when prayer is done then the work
[1:06:42] becomes a whole lot easier
[1:06:46] it becomes a way open for you God shows
[1:06:50] what you need to do in your life
[1:06:53] so prayer is you get more work done than
[1:06:57] work itself
[1:06:59] and the only way you can find his ways
[1:07:02] is by prayer
[1:07:04] find his will is by prayer
[1:07:07] he he says brother Branham says an
[1:07:10] expectation he says what a man calls
[1:07:13] great God calls foolish and what man
[1:07:16] calls foolish God calls great so what
[1:07:19] we've got to do is get back into the
[1:07:21] program of God and find out
[1:07:24] after all what God wants us to do
[1:07:28] and the only way I know to do it is
[1:07:31] prayer
[1:07:33] that's the only way we can find that
[1:07:36] what God wants us to do he says prayer
[1:07:38] is the key that that's the answer Prayer
[1:07:41] Changes Things
[1:07:43] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:07:46] was ever put in the control of human
[1:07:48] beings
[1:07:49] man I don't take that lightly brothers
[1:07:51] and sisters
[1:07:53] he says there there's no atomic bomb
[1:07:57] no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[1:08:01] will change the mind of God did you know
[1:08:05] that
[1:08:06] it did it it and it did do it one time
[1:08:11] now that's that's a mouthful for me
[1:08:15] that prayer changed the mind of God
[1:08:21] now like I said God needs us
[1:08:25] God created man in his own image he
[1:08:28] needs us so that he can act on Earth
[1:08:33] and the way he does it is by this divine
[1:08:36] intervention of Prayer
[1:08:39] so that he can change his mind
[1:08:43] that's something
[1:08:48] but uh we've got to remember that we are
[1:08:51] spirit and we are dirt
[1:08:54] and a person that is not in
[1:08:56] communication with God we begin to be
[1:08:57] governed by the dirt
[1:09:00] we've got to remember that that we need
[1:09:02] that constant communication of the
[1:09:05] source
[1:09:06] the the beasts the animals they need
[1:09:09] that source of the dirt
[1:09:11] the whales they need that source of the
[1:09:13] water
[1:09:14] but we Are Spiritual creatures inside
[1:09:17] this clay
[1:09:19] and if we can cut communication with God
[1:09:22] we begin to be governed by our bodies
[1:09:24] governed by our own thoughts governed by
[1:09:27] our own feelings governed by what the
[1:09:29] world wants us to be governed by but
[1:09:31] it's by the Holy Spirit we need to be
[1:09:33] governed by
[1:09:36] the part there is a partnership between
[1:09:38] you and God and that is prayer
[1:09:42] this is this is
[1:09:44] how the only way a child can reason with
[1:09:47] God
[1:09:49] now these things these things are are a
[1:09:52] lot to me because God for me he doesn't
[1:09:55] change his mind
[1:09:57] for me
[1:09:58] you cannot reason with God but yet
[1:10:01] brother Brandon was saying God can be
[1:10:03] changed in his mind
[1:10:06] also you see scriptures where Abraham
[1:10:09] reasoned with God
[1:10:11] it said he reasoned with him with his
[1:10:13] son and he reached him with him inside
[1:10:15] for Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:10:17] he said God God said I'm going to
[1:10:19] destroy all of them
[1:10:21] Abraham
[1:10:23] said
[1:10:24] well
[1:10:25] what if there's 50 righteous
[1:10:28] he said okay I won't destroy it for 50.
[1:10:31] and and Abraham he was bold
[1:10:34] Abraham didn't say okay I'm gonna stop
[1:10:37] there
[1:10:38] he said what about 40.
[1:10:40] okay 40. what about 30.
[1:10:44] 30. 20 10 he said 10 and he walked away
[1:10:49] but he reasoned with God he changed his
[1:10:52] mind
[1:10:54] God says I'm going to destroy all of
[1:10:56] them but Abraham said if there is 10
[1:10:58] please don't do it God says Ah okay
[1:11:03] so there's there's a way that that you
[1:11:06] can change God's mind how my mind I
[1:11:10] think how can I change God's mind
[1:11:13] brother Branham says in the message
[1:11:15] presuming he says all right so Israel
[1:11:18] God Called Moses out
[1:11:20] and said I am going to destroy the whole
[1:11:22] nation
[1:11:24] just step aside he's telling Moses step
[1:11:27] aside Moses
[1:11:28] I know you love them but I got to
[1:11:30] destroy all of them they messed up this
[1:11:32] time
[1:11:34] Moses interceded
[1:11:36] thrown himself in the breach you're
[1:11:39] doing that for your children
[1:11:42] you're doing that for the sickness that
[1:11:44] is trying to take over your life
[1:11:47] you're doing that so that you can
[1:11:48] receive the Holy Ghost so you can have a
[1:11:51] more fulfilled life you're interceding
[1:11:54] Moses interceded throwed his self in the
[1:11:57] breach
[1:11:58] now listen to this
[1:12:00] it was Christ in Moses
[1:12:05] does God change his mind
[1:12:08] this is God all the time
[1:12:11] you get you abide in Christ so much
[1:12:14] that you begin to pray his word to him
[1:12:18] you don't even know you're doing it
[1:12:21] when you get so much in his will you
[1:12:24] begin to preach back to him his word God
[1:12:27] cannot fail in his word
[1:12:30] he said it was Christ and Moses you see
[1:12:33] God would have killed the whole world
[1:12:35] one time for sin but Christ throwed
[1:12:38] himself in the breach for the whole
[1:12:40] human race brother Branham says man
[1:12:42] there was one time I I thought Jesus
[1:12:45] loved me and God hated me or he was mad
[1:12:47] at me he realized that Christ was the
[1:12:50] very heart of God
[1:12:53] it was God the whole time
[1:12:56] what amazing thing
[1:12:59] he says
[1:13:00] and and and
[1:13:02] Moses says you made a promise God
[1:13:05] this is him reasoning with God you made
[1:13:08] a promise that you would take them to a
[1:13:10] land that's right what did Moses do to
[1:13:13] God when it looked like God was going to
[1:13:15] do something contrary
[1:13:18] he throwed the word in his way amen oh I
[1:13:22] love that now I feel like shouting just
[1:13:25] talking about it you see to put the word
[1:13:29] in the way God cannot walk over his own
[1:13:32] word
[1:13:33] said you promised to do it
[1:13:35] you said you would take him to a good
[1:13:37] land that was flowing with milk and
[1:13:38] honey I told them what you said and here
[1:13:42] we are we are in your hands that was
[1:13:45] Moses talking to God
[1:13:48] if ye abide in me and I and my words
[1:13:51] abide in you
[1:13:54] hear what he says if you abide in him
[1:13:57] and his words
[1:13:59] abide in me then ask
[1:14:02] why because you're speaking his word
[1:14:05] then God begins to use you it's never
[1:14:08] God changing his mind it's God using the
[1:14:11] human body the child of God to
[1:14:14] divinely intervene in this world
[1:14:18] when you you think oh God I'm unworthy
[1:14:21] God's saying I'm going to use him today
[1:14:24] oh God help this person help this man
[1:14:27] that I saw him at Walmart and he wasn't
[1:14:29] doing good not knowing that it was
[1:14:31] predestinated for you to speak that word
[1:14:34] for that child that child of God
[1:14:38] it was predestinated for you to pray for
[1:14:41] your children
[1:14:43] Lord why does all these things happen
[1:14:45] not knowing you're the one standing in
[1:14:47] the breach and it's God Christ in you
[1:14:51] speaking back to his word
[1:14:54] I think that's beautiful
[1:14:57] I think
[1:14:59] I think that's prayer becomes more real
[1:15:02] to me
[1:15:04] you're not just talking to the air
[1:15:07] there's a god with his attention fully
[1:15:11] on you
[1:15:14] the worst thing to have is talking to
[1:15:16] somebody and their mind is somewhere
[1:15:17] else
[1:15:19] God's not like that
[1:15:22] God's not saying oh I got to do with
[1:15:24] this and I got to deal with this what do
[1:15:25] you want son no
[1:15:28] he put all of his attention to you
[1:15:32] if I'm boldly to say not because I'm
[1:15:35] special
[1:15:37] or not because I'm somebody
[1:15:40] because it's Christ in me
[1:15:42] and all he's doing is he's aha to his
[1:15:45] own word
[1:15:46] he's saying Amen to his own word and he
[1:15:49] says amen it's being fulfilled
[1:15:52] amen you're speaking my words
[1:15:56] that's all it is
[1:15:59] our prayers that is inspired by the Holy
[1:16:01] Spirit become decrees to God
[1:16:06] not selfish petitions of personal gain
[1:16:11] James he says ye ask and receive not
[1:16:14] because ye ask amiss
[1:16:18] that ye may be consumed upon your own
[1:16:20] lusts
[1:16:22] he's basically saying you you ask and
[1:16:25] you don't receive because your motives
[1:16:27] and your objectives are selfish
[1:16:31] we have to abide in him and his words in
[1:16:35] us and then when we pray I'm not saying
[1:16:37] that we can't pray personal prayers but
[1:16:39] in the end of the day it's all for the
[1:16:41] honor and the glory of God
[1:16:44] but when we go and we look at our
[1:16:46] personal and we're like oh I want to do
[1:16:48] this for a personal game that leaves God
[1:16:51] outside how can God fulfill that prayer
[1:16:56] how can God say oh I got you I'm going
[1:16:59] to help you
[1:17:01] when all he can do is listen to his own
[1:17:03] word listen to his own decree your
[1:17:05] prayer becomes the word of the Lord to
[1:17:08] him
[1:17:09] and as far as I know the word when it
[1:17:13] was spoken the logos came out
[1:17:16] it became an agent when God would speak
[1:17:19] an agent or a spirit would come out and
[1:17:22] do the things that he would speak
[1:17:25] brother Brandon says our words our
[1:17:28] tongue either holds death or life
[1:17:31] our words
[1:17:33] so we could either speak death or we
[1:17:36] could speak life what I see on that is
[1:17:39] there's two parties or two things that
[1:17:43] are anxiously waiting for what we say
[1:17:47] either death and what controls death
[1:17:52] or life
[1:17:54] and life
[1:17:56] his name is Jesus Christ
[1:17:59] he says he is the great high priest and
[1:18:01] he's waiting
[1:18:04] he's sitting there
[1:18:05] waiting to be sent out
[1:18:08] that logos when you speak and you say
[1:18:11] Lord help this
[1:18:13] logos goes out
[1:18:15] the intercessor
[1:18:18] gets your petition and goes out
[1:18:21] but there was there was one time and I
[1:18:24] hope
[1:18:25] this story it's very um
[1:18:30] it stands out
[1:18:31] where where this woman walked up to the
[1:18:34] platform with brother Brown it was
[1:18:36] actually on video
[1:18:38] and he begins to discern and God begins
[1:18:41] to use him in a mighty way and and when
[1:18:44] he was done she started to walk but then
[1:18:46] the spirit caught something he said wait
[1:18:49] wait wait hold on hold on
[1:18:51] I see a dark shadow over you
[1:18:54] he said ah it was a lie
[1:18:58] it was a lie oh your pastor said this
[1:19:02] your pastor said that you're a witch
[1:19:06] it was a lie
[1:19:08] they're just words words that can't hurt
[1:19:10] us right
[1:19:12] what was it death waiting for those
[1:19:14] words to come out saying
[1:19:17] come on send me and when we speak when
[1:19:20] we gossip about one another
[1:19:22] spirits come out
[1:19:24] and when he began to say you're a witch
[1:19:26] you're a witch a dark shadow
[1:19:28] overshadowed her this is just not words
[1:19:31] here
[1:19:32] there were Spirits behind his words to
[1:19:34] where it tormented her and he said stop
[1:19:37] believing those lies you're not a witch
[1:19:39] go on
[1:19:42] come on
[1:19:45] so if that can happen imagine good words
[1:19:48] praying for one another
[1:19:52] I know he's struggling I know I saw her
[1:19:54] she's struggling I saw her at the store
[1:19:57] she she was an acting very Christian
[1:19:59] like Lord help her
[1:20:02] instead of instead of anything else you
[1:20:05] go and you speak good words it says that
[1:20:08] a prayer of a mother even when she
[1:20:10] passes away is still intervening for
[1:20:12] that child
[1:20:15] your words they never they never end
[1:20:19] Jesus said God says my words will not
[1:20:22] return to me void
[1:20:24] that means they have to produce what has
[1:20:27] been said
[1:20:29] and whenever we pray whenever we talk
[1:20:31] for one another our words will not come
[1:20:34] void
[1:20:36] because we believed in the word we
[1:20:38] believed it just like Jesus or God
[1:20:40] believed in his own word when he said
[1:20:42] let there be light
[1:20:44] there was light
[1:20:46] maybe it could have took billions of
[1:20:48] years but there had to be light God
[1:20:51] wasn't stressing over his own word God
[1:20:53] believed in what he said and he allowed
[1:20:55] the process to take over
[1:20:58] and whenever we pray for one another
[1:21:00] allow the process to take over and
[1:21:03] believe
[1:21:04] that one another will be all right
[1:21:07] because there's an agent
[1:21:10] his name is Jesus
[1:21:12] he's been sent to go and intercede he's
[1:21:15] the only one
[1:21:17] the only high priest that can go between
[1:21:19] us and God
[1:21:22] and say Here's this petition
[1:21:25] here's this accept it Lord
[1:21:29] your prayers are more real than our
[1:21:32] physical being is
[1:21:34] your spirit who you truly are is more
[1:21:37] real than us standing here
[1:21:41] and God he will answer you even before
[1:21:44] you even speak God's already working on
[1:21:47] it
[1:21:47] God's already cooking God's already
[1:21:50] sending angels out God's already
[1:21:53] planning things and he's just waiting on
[1:21:55] you to get down on your knees and pray
[1:21:59] God was already working and and Daniel
[1:22:03] went and prayed
[1:22:05] and he prayed and he prayed and he
[1:22:07] prayed for three weeks he prayed
[1:22:11] the angel had to come and said man I was
[1:22:13] already out when you first spoke your
[1:22:16] first word
[1:22:17] I was already working
[1:22:19] on your situation
[1:22:21] now Danny wasn't praying a selfish
[1:22:23] prayer he was preaching or praying thy
[1:22:26] kingdom come kind of Prayer
[1:22:30] those are the prayers that we want when
[1:22:32] Jesus says praying like this he didn't
[1:22:34] say pray this prayer he says let me give
[1:22:37] you a blueprint
[1:22:39] let me give you a template and the first
[1:22:41] thing he said is our father that is Abba
[1:22:44] Father
[1:22:46] dad
[1:22:48] Papa
[1:22:50] God God father
[1:22:53] Our Father which is our which is in
[1:22:55] heaven
[1:22:57] your name be holy holier than anything
[1:23:02] thy kingdom come that's the first prayer
[1:23:07] Lord before my daily bread
[1:23:09] before my daily issues before anything
[1:23:12] that's going on in my life Your Kingdom
[1:23:14] Come Lord
[1:23:16] let your will be done Lord
[1:23:19] and God has to take place in your life
[1:23:23] because we're asking for his kingdom
[1:23:26] we're asking for him and what is his
[1:23:28] kingdom it's for God to dwell in his
[1:23:30] people
[1:23:32] you are the kingdom of God
[1:23:35] you are that Holy City
[1:23:38] John says or the angel told John you
[1:23:41] want to see the city or you want to see
[1:23:43] the bride he showed a city
[1:23:45] you're that City you're that temple of
[1:23:48] God that God wants to work through
[1:23:52] but we have to make that effort to say
[1:23:54] Lord your kingdom come
[1:23:57] your will be done
[1:23:58] on Earth as it is in heaven and and I
[1:24:01] tell you his will has to be done
[1:24:05] when you begin to plead his promises
[1:24:07] your will is his will
[1:24:10] when you plead his word
[1:24:14] your will is his will
[1:24:17] and God's legal right to act is through
[1:24:21] you
[1:24:22] God has to work
[1:24:24] and then you can get up
[1:24:27] and then you can get up and spend
[1:24:30] seconds in those issues
[1:24:33] you don't have to it said by the Finger
[1:24:36] of God the Devils were cast out not
[1:24:39] because we're somebody no we're
[1:24:41] connected to a lifeline
[1:24:45] it's God's divine intervention and God's
[1:24:48] divine intervention starts with prayer
[1:24:51] we have to be in constant communication
[1:24:54] everyone throughout the Bible that's
[1:24:56] what they had to do they kept constant
[1:24:58] communication when I started to look at
[1:25:00] this I said man every single man of God
[1:25:03] was in constant communication
[1:25:05] but all we see is the hands
[1:25:07] all we see is the the
[1:25:10] Red Sea be
[1:25:12] pulled apart all we see is whenever
[1:25:16] Elijah called down fire
[1:25:19] but if you look a little deeper
[1:25:22] first God had to speak to Moses
[1:25:25] first God had to have a communication
[1:25:27] with him before Moses could be this
[1:25:30] great prophet that we call great
[1:25:34] this this David that was a great king
[1:25:37] man you got a bunch of
[1:25:40] Psalms showing his prayers behind his
[1:25:43] life
[1:25:44] when he was in the greatest point of his
[1:25:46] life and when he was at the lowest he
[1:25:48] still kept communication
[1:25:51] that's the key
[1:25:54] we're human
[1:25:56] I'm human
[1:25:58] sometimes we're not living the High Life
[1:26:00] a lot of times
[1:26:02] sometimes
[1:26:04] the devil takes over in your life
[1:26:07] sometimes there's a backsliding that
[1:26:09] takes place
[1:26:11] but the thing that I can tell you is
[1:26:13] keep constant communication
[1:26:17] don't break that lifeline
[1:26:21] that's where we fail
[1:26:23] that's where when we don't when we fail
[1:26:26] to get back up
[1:26:28] when we fail to to say Lord I know you
[1:26:32] can help me
[1:26:33] I know I've I've got an answer for what
[1:26:35] I did Lord I know the consequences are
[1:26:38] coming but don't let me go
[1:26:41] don't let me lose Lord
[1:26:43] not don't let me not feel your presence
[1:26:46] with me Lord I know I messed up but fix
[1:26:49] it whether I have to hurt whether I have
[1:26:52] to go through things Lord just do
[1:26:55] something but Lord I'm not letting you
[1:26:56] go
[1:26:58] a lot of times the devil will put
[1:27:00] something in our mind to it say just
[1:27:01] give up
[1:27:03] you think he's going to listen to you
[1:27:04] now you think he'll do he'll still
[1:27:07] answer
[1:27:08] he answered David
[1:27:11] why because he had the True Heart of
[1:27:14] repentance he had the true heart that he
[1:27:17] loved God no matter how faulty of a
[1:27:19] person he was
[1:27:22] and and we're not holy we're only Holy
[1:27:25] by the righteousness of God
[1:27:28] by believing his word and because we
[1:27:30] believe in his word he will pick us up
[1:27:33] and he will help us out
[1:27:36] he will answer our prayers
[1:27:39] I know there's many needs here
[1:27:42] I've got many needs
[1:27:44] but there's a God here
[1:27:47] that wants to show himself through you
[1:27:52] all you have to do is believe brother
[1:27:54] Branham his song for every time he would
[1:27:57] go up to the pulpit 99 of the time was
[1:28:01] only belief
[1:28:03] preach the Seven Seals preached deep
[1:28:06] messages but
[1:28:07] only belief
[1:28:10] all things are possible to them that
[1:28:12] believe
[1:28:14] that's all we have to do
[1:28:16] we we don't we
[1:28:19] can't separate our prayer life from God
[1:28:24] from our works especially those that God
[1:28:26] has called you to do something great in
[1:28:29] the ministry
[1:28:31] called you to be a singer for the Lord
[1:28:35] somebody that plays an instrument for
[1:28:38] the Lord
[1:28:40] yeah you've got gifts but that's not
[1:28:42] what God wants
[1:28:45] God wants you to keep communication
[1:28:49] brother Branham said the gift is not
[1:28:51] what you do it's how much can you submit
[1:28:54] to the Lord of God
[1:28:56] how much can you submit to a man when
[1:28:58] you can submit to him then he can use
[1:29:01] the gift and you know what every single
[1:29:04] person in this place has a gift
[1:29:07] you have a gift for your family you have
[1:29:10] a gift at work you have something that
[1:29:12] God wants to use you through
[1:29:16] but we have to submit ourselves unto him
[1:29:18] amen
[1:29:20] let us stand to our feet
[1:29:24] I pray that um
[1:29:26] these words you can meditate on these
[1:29:29] words
[1:29:31] that
[1:29:32] prayer
[1:29:34] you can't fake prayer
[1:29:37] we can fake Church
[1:29:40] we can fake worshiping
[1:29:43] we can fake everything
[1:29:46] but prayer
[1:29:47] alone with God
[1:29:50] now you're coming into the presence of
[1:29:53] the one that knows everything about you
[1:29:56] you're coming into the presence of of
[1:29:59] the
[1:30:00] of the one that knows your truest and
[1:30:03] rawest form of you
[1:30:05] I can put on a smile
[1:30:07] you can put on a a nice suit a smile but
[1:30:11] nobody knows what's really going on
[1:30:13] inside
[1:30:15] but when you get into that Hour of
[1:30:17] Prayer
[1:30:19] you're you're going into the presence of
[1:30:21] the one that knows all about you
[1:30:25] then your words your lips it doesn't
[1:30:28] matter he's looking at your motive and
[1:30:31] your objective of your heart
[1:30:34] and for me that's comforting
[1:30:38] that's comforting that somebody knows me
[1:30:42] in all of my faults
[1:30:45] all of my issues
[1:30:47] you might we might hide it with a smile
[1:30:49] we might hide it with something but God
[1:30:52] knows how messed up we are
[1:30:55] sometimes how much we doubt yet we want
[1:30:58] to be the strong person
[1:31:00] sometimes how much how much we really
[1:31:03] hurt even though we we want to be the
[1:31:06] light in our family
[1:31:08] how much the sickness affects us how
[1:31:11] much it affects us to see our children a
[1:31:13] certain way
[1:31:15] whatever it might be God knows it
[1:31:19] so when we enter into this prayer
[1:31:22] don't don't you don't have to worry
[1:31:24] about who's behind you who's on the side
[1:31:26] who's in front of you there's a presence
[1:31:29] that knows everything and you know what
[1:31:32] the funny thing is he still loves you
[1:31:36] and every fault and every issue and
[1:31:38] everything he still loves you
[1:31:43] that is powerheads
[1:31:46] all right

[1:32:48] price

[1:32:52] that one
[1:32:55] think of the highest value Lord if I
