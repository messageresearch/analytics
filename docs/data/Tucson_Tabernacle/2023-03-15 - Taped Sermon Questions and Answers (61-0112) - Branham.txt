good it's good to see everyone here before we get started a couple announcements brother Jeremy and sister Angela had it on the heart to do another volleyball Gathering and a potluck that will be on Friday night at the same place it was last time it'll start at 6 30. um and I'll put a link up I didn't put up a link on the announcement to sign up for food but I will do that sister Angela um has given me the link and I just haven't put it up yet and then on Saturday we have uh brother Sammy Marriott his celebration of his life and we'll do that that'll start at three o'clock and we will have another potluck after that so we're gonna have plenty of food this this weekend and then on Sunday I'll be ministering in the morning and um on Sunday evening I wanted to do something a little bit different I've been hearing so many good testimonies from the congregation over the past few weeks I thought it'd probably be time to have a testimony service so we will all say a few words at the beginning of service on Sunday night and then we will start passing the microphone around and uh and hearing some of these wonderful things that have been happenings so please come and maybe jot down some notes and let's make sure that it's not just one testimony so keep your testimonies as brief as you can we don't want to hinder the testimony but we also want to have everyone get a chance to speak that wants to um so we have a we have a big week this week my brother Adam is coming into town tomorrow and I will probably I think I'm going to have him give a testimony I've I've talked about this boxing gym that we started a couple years ago now and how it's just flourished so I'll probably have my brother give um testimony of some things that have happened recently with this ministry that we have with with the youth not so much with the youth but with the inner city folks there in Jeffersonville tonight we have a special blessing and being able to hear this questions and answers tape it's something I've listened to it I listened to it yesterday and then I listened to it again today and I feel that it's it's something that is going to help us as a congregation brother Branham talks about the questions that were on the people's hearts this is this is a men's meeting and um it's it's just mainly the ministers that were in the church back then and it was some of the local pastors brother Junior Jackson's there brother ruddle was there brother Chris was there some of the different ones that had come from Brother branham's Ministry they were together in the Tabernacle and brother Branham was answering some of these questions and the the kind of the main theme at the beginning was about finding your position in the body finding identifying that calling that God has given to you and brother Branham goes through and some of the questions they're just beautiful questions and beautiful answers brother Branham talks about how you need to pray these things through and and sometimes people want to do something that's not their calling and other times people don't want to do something that is their calling and he tells us how to find what that is and I believe he says that watch if if you're moving in this ministry and God blesses it then you know that you're operating within that calling you're going to hear him talk about that and there's one really sweet thing that happened and it was it was something that that you might not identify and as you're listening to the sermon remember that there are ministers there that had left the Branham Tabernacle brother Junior Jackson Brother Don Ruttle and and and the different ones and started their own their own churches and some of these Brethren had differences they were divided in their Doctrine and I've said this before one of those Doctrine was in church order and in worship and in tongues and in in that part of the ministry and brother Branham there's a question on tongues and really loud just listen close as as he's answering this it'll really bless you brother Branham gives the answer about about the tongues and about how when the spirit when the spirit hits you that it's the spirit going forward now watch the pastor which is brother Neville the pastor here's brother branham's answer and he sees that oh this could be misinterpreted and that's where the pastors see the pastors watching over the congregation and he's he's listening to brother branham's answer and he's listening to the question and he says uh brother Branham and then he has a question and as brother Branham says he says well when the spirit takes control and you'll hear it I'm just paraphrasing when the spirit takes control that and brother Branham answered it perfectly as always but it could have been misinterpreted as when the spirit takes control you have no control over yourself so you could just stand up at any time and give a prophecy or speak in tongues or whatever it might be it could be interpreted that way that's not what brother Brahm said but the pastor says brother Branham he says um he he says something on the order of but there's still order right you can still control that and then brother Branham says oh yes you can still control and it must come in order and that but it blessed me so much to see the the operation of the fivefold ministry there you have the leader and he has the authority and he is he is giving the answers he is this messenger and he's giving these answers to set this church body in order and then you have the pastor and he's looking over his local body and he's saying but can we clarify that a little bit because he's seeing that maybe the congregation could take it wrong and then brother Branham goes on and clarifies it it was just such a such a blessing to me in listening to this tape and how important these things are that the prophet's talking about setting us in order and finding our place in the ministry now in this tape there's mainly ministers and Elders there but it applies to all of us every single one of us has a position in God's body it may not be to stand behind this Pulpit but all of us have a position and we need to find that position and seek the place that God wants us in and then once we find that place we will be able to operate I've seen so many mistakes and and brothers that may they may want a position doing doing something here and it's not blessing the congregation and not only is it not blessing the congregation but in wanting a position that they're not called to they are taking themselves out of a position that they are called to and then it hurts the body so if like like if me if I was looking for a position that God didn't call me to I would also be taking myself at a position that he did call me to and I know in my just in my history and growing up and the way I was raised I never wanted to be in this pulpit preacher way I don't like those guys and I saw over the years how and especially over the past few years how God has has not pushed me but nudged me in this direction and me me seeing and me saying I don't want to do that I don't want to do that I just I just I want to just live my life I want to be happy I want to serve the Lord I want to pay my tithes I want to sit in the congregation I want to worship and then I want to go hunting on the weekends on on Friday and Saturday I'll show up for church on Sunday and I want to work in my job and I want to make money and I want to be prosperous and all of that and that wasn't that's not my calling it's my calling to do something that's a little different that maybe I can help other people and I see and especially in the past few days there is such a need there is such a need in the ministry and I'm not just talking about in this pulpit I'm talking about people need love people need to be shown that there's someone that cares sister Rachel always think about you and the blessing that you are to the people that you work with we need that it's it's we can go up and we can preach a great message and how much good does it do but you know what does a do you know what does far more good than anything you could ever do is if you care and if you listen and if you show someone that you actually care and you actually love that person that's what makes the difference I know I've been on the phone pretty much all day yesterday and today with people that that aren't even most of them aren't even from this church and they're just torn up living life and and it just seems like nobody cares and and I'll get off the phone with them and then I'll hear Oh Brother Daniel um bro this this person said that that old brother Daniel he's he's just such a man of God and he he just told me the exact exact right things and you know what I did I didn't even I just listened wasn't any great wisdom that I had I just cared for the person I loved them and and I took my time for them and that's what it's so needed and I just even even just today friends there is a there is a there's a great problem in the world and it's people are falling into sin and people are going away from God because no one cares Jesus cares but he has Representatives on Earth how does he do his work he does his work through us and that's that's what the world needs to see that's what we need to be it's a Wednesday night and many times I've said the Wednesday night crowd is they are the ones that seem to make things happen you know the pillars the pillars in the church and and working hard not that not that the Lord's not using everyone but really making an effort and we can take the lead and really push and work and work for God's people because the time is short and and listening to this sermon today I felt such an anointing even though the the sermon is not an emotional sermon it's it's just you'll sit there and you'll listen to it and you'll just take in the wisdom of a prophet and just enjoy what he's saying but the wisdom in which he says it is is just tremendous and I know that you're going to get as much of a blessing out of it as I have and um I'm excited I'm excited for us to listen to it tonight we're going to start at uh we started about four minutes in start at the beginning of paragraph 11 and then we will end at the end of paragraph 139 51 minutes in so we'll start at four minutes and 14 seconds in and we'll end just shy of 52 minutes in so let's stand let's bow our heads friends have an open heart set aside any doctrines that you have that I have that we've we've learned set aside those doctrines and just take it in wisdom of a prophet of God they don't come along very often like and allow the Holy Spirit to work have an open mind and think on the things that this man says and accept them [Music] speaks on these issues of the body of Christ and on tongues let's bow our heads as as brother Branham prays our heavenly father we have assembled here is a group of man Christian man who love you who believe in you and who's dedicated our lives and services to your service there's ministers you're a young man middle-aged man they got churches they're responsible before God there's deacons here it's responsible in their offices in these different churches there's trustees their responsibilities pastors evangelists whatever Lord we're responsible to you and that's why we come together that we might all speak the same thing as we were said that we must do in the scripture let us all speak alike father we think in this kind of a group that we might find maybe some of our Brethren or some of us would have a little differences up on things and some were just asking for really to find out what is truth about it and we know that we're insufficient each of us if I should ask any of these other brothers to come here to these questions perhaps they'd be just as sufficient or more than I'd be to answer them but together we are depending on your Revelation amen that you might reveal to us through the word and through by your spirit that we might have an answer for every question that our hearts we might be filled with the answers and we could go away feeling it we were better equipped for your service and to serve our office than we are now that's our purpose of being here father Grant it now and answer our questions father as we wait upon you let there be no puzzle in any of our minds but may we stay with that question until it's fully answered and we're Satisfied by the spirit unanimously agreed because of his presence he asked it in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated thank you I just want a quote a scripture to start with is Isaiah said the prophet said O come let us reason together saith the Lord and I think that's why we're here tonight is try to reason get things uh reasoned out and now I would start and got some of the things written down here according to numbers and so forth that I had this brother Woods that caught got this envelope uh with answers in him and now I want each of you my dear Brethren to know that that these answers are are given to the very best of my knowledge the very best that I would know how to understand and these answers are not infallible see because the scriptures is infallible and as far as I know they're aligned with the scriptures I hope that makes it plain and the tape is to be uh kept now and anyone would want it well and it could have it but now I know the scriptures are infallible but my answers are not infallible so I'm sure everyone understands that and if it's not uh if it's not infallible then you have a right maybe to ask me at any time if there's somebody else's question it doesn't have to be your question but if it's somebody else's question maybe you never thought of it but it's something we're here to help we're here to to come together because we're in the last days and the days are evil and and we want to be trained at school brother Stricker the soldier brother gold back there a soldier and perhaps brother ruddle here he was a soldier brother dealer and uh the different ones it's it's been military life you set together you you counsel you you know the battle before you get out there and all the tactics you can of the enemy so that you can meet him on his ground and I used to box they find out my opponent what he was going to be what kind of a lick he used whether it's an uppercut or left jab or chop with his right hand and or his liar left-handed how strong he was and where he switched his feet and how he used his eyes and what color he come from and all the different tactics we could and they'd find out what the trainers had seen that fellow fight before so then they put a man in there with me to train me exactly like that man was fighting to to know what he was going to do that's what we're here for tonight we know the strike of the enemy we know what his tactics are and we're here tonight with scripture to cover him over so he can't move because the enemies on every hand brother Roberson I think back there seeing him he sure he don't know what a soldier is he certainly had a time of how many soldiers is in here let's see it's been soldiers in the Army just look at here a group of You Soldiers all right now you know what it is and that's what you study isn't it brother Roy brother Beeler and you veterans and so forth is study the enemy what's he going to do what's his move and then know how to meet him that's what we're here for study the enemy's move and and knowing how to meeting a thing that'll overcome him and remember let me say this brethren a little church has started here on a line of gifts saying gifts are coming into the church but whether there be gifts or not if there's never a gift I'll tell you the gift won't always defeat the enemy but the word will the word will meet him anywhere and Jesus when he was on Earth proved that he's he was God manifested in flesh but he never used any of his fine gifts to beat the enemy we find in Matthew the uh I believe is the second the third chapter of Matthew he said no second chapter of Matthew when he met the enemy he met him on the grounds of the word it is written and the enemy come back it is written and he said it is also written I can't until he beat the enemy and that's what we're here for is to meet the enemy with the material that God gave us to meet it with now I have about four questions Jared it's on the um it's on one it's on one piece of paper and I numbered him one two three four five six eight ten on down like that as soon as I get through this then I'll jump into those there it says brother Branham if these questions are out of line then just disregard them and I won't feel bad about it for I will know it was not the hand of the Lord question number one brother Branham I have heard you uh that it should should be back in the and I I I have heard you say I should be back in the ministry and I have thought up on it myself but have waited up on some definitely word from him about it up to date it hasn't come now since I know the end is so near should I still wait for the Lord Jesus to to speak to me are would he be pleased to tell you what to tell me since I know you are his spokesman for this day well now a brother I'd I got it wrote down here my answer to it um God calling this brother a call in life now there's one great thing we could just take that as a text and preach all night on it see that one thing a calling make your calling and election sure thing we don't want to be just wondering if we're called you must be called or you'll be defeated we're fighting a battle thing and uh if you are positive sure brother that your calling is of God and you've been called of God to do a work now there's a great trick there that the enemy can play on you he can make you think you're not called when you are a call then you turn right back around make you think you're not called or make you think you're you are called when you're not called vice versa either way and you had to watch it now here's the way to do it find out first but this is advice the only thing I can give on this is advising but make sure that your calling comes from God and then check your mortis and objectives thing now you know what I mean by that what is your emotive for preaching was it just do you think is the easier job and what you have and you better forget it it wasn't a call a call of God Burns so in your heart you can't rest day and night for it you just can't get away from it it's just constantly grinding at you and and if you had to preach and say well now another objective I believe it's a job I've got if I could be a successful evangelist or a pastor have a good set salary have a home and I could go into and so forth and live then uh I believe that would be a good thing much easier than what I'm doing now and really I think it would be I see your objective is wrong to begin with see it's not right think you're wrong here on that and uh you'd say well uh maybe because that I am uh think maybe it'll be more popular amongst the people see you'll find out you're just ready for a big flop really thing but now if your objective is that I don't care if I have to eat salty crackers and drink Branch water I'll preach the gospel anyhow something is tearing into you I'll either preach the gospel or die see then you you go somewhere because it's God dealing with you God is making himself known to you because it is God just won't let you rest and usually a god-called man never wants to do it did you ever think of that any man just recently is asked to me by some very precious brethren that uh so now that we have come into the way brother Branham now that we've found that Lord and received the Holy Ghost shall we uh seek gifts for our ministry that we should do I said don't never do it don't never advise people to do something like that because usually a guy that wants to do it is a guy that that can't do it it's a God is trying to run from it is the one that God uses see if he's trying to get away from it oh brother I tell you I the calling's in me but I man I hate to try that uh there you are I see that that's trying to run if he's if he wants to do it so bad the first thing he know he finds himself a stuffed shirt like you say God you give me power to move mountains I tell you I'll do something for you if you let me move mountains no he wouldn't you can't even move himself to the right attitude see so he had never moved Mountains for God just take for instance like Paul you think Paul could have got away from his calling oh brother he couldn't do it he was just grinding at him day and night till he left his church he left everything and and went out into I believe it was Asia wasn't and stayed three years down there studying the scriptures to find out whether it was right or not see to find out whether God had really called him so if God is calling you brother and he keeps digging at your heart and I'd say a lay aside ever wait and the sin that is easily besetches but if it's not digging at you and then um I I wouldn't think too much about it then just let it come to this paper now I said this brother is sitting here um a brother Branham should um do you think that God would speak to me to tell him I believe God would speak right straight to him because you know God's we're not too big but what he can speak to us he he'll speak to us all right he just he'll speak to us and I'll tell you if he told me then the brother might say well he told Brother Branham so praise God but you see it ain't brother Ram giving you the call it's the Lord Jesus giving you the cause he if it's the Lord Jesus giving a call he'll do the speaking see I can speak to you to your ears but when Christ called you to the ministry it's in your heart see that's where the thing has to Anchor and you can't get away from it now I believe on the second question now if there's any question on that any question to it okay at a man's call has to be in his heart coming from God and another brother oh I know who this is It's wrote this see I know who wrote it precious dear gracious brother that I truly believe has a call of God but I just I wouldn't want him to do it up on mine that's the reason I answered the way I did see up on me saying well yes uh brother so and so hard to go into the ministry see now you say brother Bram told me hard to do that and maybe what if something happened to brother Branham I get killed or die or get away then see your calling is over then but if Jesus calls you brother as long as there's an eternity he'll still be a ringing out scene and then you know where you're standing now on the second or something like this knowing it it is the last day I sure appreciate that for that brother I certainly appreciate that of that brother realizing that we're in the last day and the sincerity of his heart wanting to do something for Christ the next one is now if our precious Lord should let me do a little thing for him should I go back to the communities where I have ministered parsley in the an era of which I am sorry he has that in princes and try to tell them the truth they have been so they have been so upon my hearts no brother I wouldn't think it was necessary for you to go back into the same community and um I believe a brother dear when the Lord called you he may never let you go as you once does in a community and you perhaps taught things or had things that wasn't um that actually you see different on now seeing that you might see different from what you did then now and the Lord when he calls you he may if he makes it Realty he might send you anywhere see you wouldn't have to go to any certain Community or anything when you were there you were sincere I know the brother as I say this wrote these questions with the deepest of sinistering or real genuine Christian you did the best that you could do and with all you know what how to do and that's all God requires now if God should call you back that Community I'll take right back again but if he didn't I believe I just go wherever he sent me to is your question number three how does one know their rightful position in the body of Christ that's a good one very good how does that be kind of question amongst many of us here tonight how do you rightfully know now I'm presuming that this brother wants to know uh what the position what in Christ what part of Christ do I play now for instance I'd say like this brother to give you the best answer I know your position is cry and Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit and then if you want to know whether it's the Holy Spirit or not find out whether He blesses what you're doing or not and if he blesses it then that's him if he doesn't bless like someone said to me not long ago said the Lord called me to preach I said well then preach and uh so he he I really think it's so Satan if he can just get somebody to act like that and then deceive him that's just what he wants to do then the whole world points her finger at that somebody thinks they have a gift of speaking in tongues an interpretation some has a gift of Divine Healing some has these things like sometimes they're mistaken in those things and sometimes they think they haven't got it when they have so it's very tricky so always do this Brethren whenever you feel that you're supposed to do a thing first find out if it's scriptural for you to do it if it's in the scriptures not just wrote in one place but that means completely scriptural Through the Bible for you to do it your position safe just be an evangelist Pastor teacher prophet whatever God might have called you to be you see or if you have a gift of tongues gift interpretation gift of any any kind of the nine spiritual gifts in the church into four spiritual offices of the church any position first see if God called then usually the way I watch it for myself just this is me I watch the nature of the person and see what kind of a gift that they're professing see God will work with his creature the way he's made him see you make a creature if you seem real flighty and going on you and he says the Lord call me for such a such a to be a pastor Pastor can't be a flighty person pastor's solid sound see God called me to be a teacher and watch him how he interprets the order see he gets it all messed up and everything then you can tell see but then the thing to do your position is usually known whether you can do it or not now when God called me to be an evangelist I wanted to be a pastor I thought staying home here would just be fine and the Lord called me and finally all the people got together there's not a one of them left and I didn't hear him that they cried and went out there in the 1717 Spring Street and the lady Mrs Hawkins over here and met me instead of crying during the time of depression when wanted in a neighborhood to cook a mess of beans and we'd all come in and eat from that and she said I'll announce my children at the table if you'll only build a tabernacle and my calling was an evangelist the morning laying right here at this Cornerstone we could burst in every night you'll see your fly leaf off my Bible where he told me to be an evangelist see and I wasn't a successful Pastor never would be because I haven't got the patience and what it takes to be a pastor see so therefore if I tried to Pastor I would just be as far out as the pastor is trying to be an evangelist see what I mean you see the way the Lord calls you what your position is in the body is there a question do all holy ghost Theo people speak with tongues sooner or later that's the first question do all holy ghost that's it's all in one question I got it lauded here for number four question but uh I'll say this first you see do all holy ghost people speak with tongues sooner or later I find where Paul said he spoke with more tongues than them all all right question number four do all speak with tongues when receiving the whole or no said do all speak with tongues no do all the Holy Ghost feel people speak with tongues sooner or later now brother I this is a deep question now you probably I probably have some answers back on this the Holy Spirit part of the holy spirit is justification that's when you first God has to call you or you'll never be called there's nothing you can do in yourself no man can come to me except my father's drawing first is that right so part of justification is the Holy Ghost have you heard me explain to that Lutheran Dean that time about the cornfield see the car and a man went out playing two they're playing this corn field next morning he went out nothing natural while he found two little blades sticking up he said praise God for my cornfield I said did he have a cornfield and the Lutheran Dean said potentially I said that is right potentially he did but I said was you lutherans by and by the shoots grew up and it come to a tassel that was Methodist the second stage of the Corn it's a tussle I think that's right you brother from the farm and then the Apostle looks back down to the leaf and says I'm a tassel you're just a leaf see I don't need you no more and then the tassels the pollen drops in the castle back into the leaf again has to have to leave and then from that brings forth the ear that was Pentecost the restoration of the gifts like went into the first place back to the original then when the ear come out said I don't need you tossle or neither do I need you leaf but after all the same life that was in the the blade of corn made the tassel and what was in the blade and the tassel made the grain so what is the holy spirit speaking in tongues is an advanced justification see what is the Pentecostal Church the advanced Lutheran see but now when the advancing has come the question would be this then shall I just remain no no the corns matured see you start off with the green I start off with the the word the green it'll produce justification and stay in justification until it produces sanctification stay in sanctification till you receive the Holy Ghost now when you receive the Holy Ghost what will it do what is still got a question haven't you all right what is speaking with tongues speaking with tongues is nothing but a baptism of the Holy Ghost that justified you and Sanctified you it's so filled now I've wanted I wanted this question God knows I never knew the name is going to ask answered or asked him I said too if it gets too hot in here open my door if you get sleepy or something I want you to get this time because it it's really a little warm might make you get sleepy now notice notice this justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost I look here here it is let me illustrate now I'm down here in the center I'm walking this way once after a while something speaks to me and nothing can turn me but God is that right I'm turning this away now when I turn around that's my justification is that right now the picture is my object of going now I want you to place where I can feel good around them see I'm justifying I come to this stage here where I can talk to him because I still ashamed of myself I still smoke I still lied done a little sneaking things that I want to do an all-time ups and downs ups and downs but I won't even cleanse me from all those things so I can really walk up to him and talk to him see all right here it is it's stage of sanctification what did it do straighten me up then now I'm going on to the Holy Spirit see and when I get into here I'm in the Holy Spirit buy a baptism is that right what does the Holy Spirit do it gives me power to be a preacher power to be a singer power to speak with tongues power to interpret them is full of power for the holy spirit is the power of God it was the power of God to turn me around is the power of God that Sanctified me now it's the power of God that's filmed now on a certain occasion I'm standing here and I'm trying to say something the power of God comes up on me in such a great way till I just can't speak no more here it is I'm going to illustrate it this way I'm going to talk to you Brethren so it should be sure to give huh I do brother see I'm still here um sure glad I still want to know I'm so glad all right now Angela wow I know you're looking right at me in North a Hillview things have killed for the world that's a while I get cleaned up wow something's happening I'm Sanctified I can look you right in the face I'm one of you see all right brother praise God I'm glad to be in this Holy Ghost group I'm glad to be amongst you holy Brethren wow okay put your finger on me uncleaned up but now God's gonna put me in service now yes sir brother brand would you justify yes I remember and I just couldn't hardly look at you brother I can look in your face now see here we are now what's this other now I'm gonna this is cleaned and set aside for our service this is coming into service now we all know that the word sanctify is a Greek word a compound Greek word it means cleaned and set aside far service the vessels was cleansed by the altered Sanctified by the order instead aside forest service but to be in service is to be filled and putting service now I go over here and now I'm coming in to serve now it was God's attorney hear me hear me you get what I mean see and here yeah yeah yeah that's it all right and I believe this now I do not believe that speaking in tongues is any evidence of the Holy Ghost it isn't because I have seen witches Wizards snake handlers Devils everything else speaking tongues and it is not an infallible Act of God when you speak in tongues that you've got the Holy Ghost but remember the Holy Ghost does speak in tongues and the devil can impersonate it the the evidence that you've got the Holy Ghost is the life that you live see by their fruits you shall know them in the fruit of the spirit is not nowhere in the scripture found speaking in town the fruit of the spirit is love joy Faith long-suffering goodness meekness channels patience now that is the fruit that's what you find on the tree you tell what kind of a tree it is see that's what man are looking to you preachers and to you deacons and you trust thieves you evangelist you can speak in tongues out here on this street all day long they'll never believe you but you live what you're talking about you show Sweetness in all the roots of bitterness is out of you then man will realize or something it's speaking in tongues now I do believe this that sometime another that a Spirit-filled person that lays under the altar of God will speak with tongues but I've seen many speak with tongues that never know nothing about God see see know nothing about him at all and they still speak with tongues any of those gifts can be impersonated see but the fruit of the spirit proves what the spirit is on the inside you bear the witness of the life of Jesus Christ because if these peach trees snap in an apple tree it'll bear peaches and shoes or that's right because it's a life that's inside of it now that's the same thing it is here but now I thought I could get this to you all so that we could all know the same thing I believe that a Spirit-filled person that now he comes into Christ by baptism and just that is not speaking with tongues is not evidence of a baptism see a baptism you can be baptized into the devil's power and speak in tongues with the baptism of the devil's deceiving Spirit how many times have we seen it done how many times have I seen it done I even order them drinking blood out of a human skull and speaking in tongues I've seen the snake dancers on the desert when they wrap this big snake around them and go along speaking the wizard come out like that and they speak in tongues and interpret it I've entered a witch camps where they lay a pencil down like that and put a book down like this and a pencil run up down a stole pipe play shaving a hair cut two bits and right now knowing tongues and a wizard interpreted and tell exactly what happened I I know that myself see so I see you can't Paul said where there's tongues they shall cease where there's prophecies it'll fail where all these gifts they'll soon be done away with we got the question a little later but when that which is perfect has come that which is in part is done away see so we want the perfect thing brother and see we've seen too many things bogus and give the wrong interpretation to it and don't never face a person and and believe it they got the Holy Ghost because they speak in tongues but you believe they have the Holy Ghost because of the fruits that they bear for Jesus said buy their fruits you shall know them that's right father fruit now but uh now let me just not get away from that now because I don't want to dishonor a great gift that God has given see and I believe that a Spirit-filled man or woman or a child that lives under the altar of God won't live there long until he'll be speaking with tongues see I believe that he will do it or she now you can receive the Holy Ghost and maybe you didn't speak with tongues when you get but if you constantly lay there before God all the time is baptism after baptism striking you something's going to take place see you'll get so full someday you can't talk nothing else do you you try to say something you just can't say it no more you just can't say it and many times if people realize that that was the Holy Spirit they go ahead and just open their heart up and let God speak to them the Bible said with stammering lips and with other tongues will I speak to this people Isaiah 28 28 18. now with stammering lips and with other tongues will I speak what is a stammer somebody who can't talk just it's stammer is trying to see this so full of spirit he's trying to say all right let's go say a brother to Jack Jackson seat like that you're trying to you can't say it see that's so filled with the spirit I want to ask you brother have you ever felt the Holy Ghost shake you so bad that you just couldn't hardly say nothing we just said quite some time just sat there and cry have you did that well that's a Holy Ghost if you don't the reason people don't speak with tongues many times they don't know how to yield themselves to the spirit and they're looking for something way off when it's right on them that's reasonable and then some people just get yourself worked up any emotion and say a bunch of words that has no meaning to it and still ain't got the Holy Ghost and try to say they have because he spoke in him ah they're fruits you shall know them now is there a question yes brother No Doubt about a long time thank you brother Jackson that's right that's about the way I did it too brother Jackson I received the baptism the Holy Ghost back in my shed see in about a year later or something like that I was uh I was a spoken tongues and about a year or two ate that I was preaching again in a church and I stand up on the platform like this night when I was young wasn't as stiff and old as I am now I could get around a little bit I'd very emotionally preaching I stand there preaching and I just jumped up on her desk it was on a Baptist Church Middletown Baptist Church and went right down into the aisle preaching this as hard as I could preach like that and just as a stop preaching something just had me all carried away instead several words four or five or six words and unknown tongues and before I knew what I was doing I heard myself calling out the rock in a weary land the shelter in a time of Storms and then one day coming down a railroad track I was walking down the railroad track this side of Scottsburg coming down the railroad track patrolling winds blowing hard oh mine ice all over the track and I crossed the horse like I walked down my thirty three thousand 66 went up the other way and kind of went parallel to the track and I was coming down the track and all of a sudden I was walking on there I sang and I always sing I had different places where I went to pray and I was going along our singing and all at once to come to find out I was speaking in tongues see not knowing what I was doing speaking in tongues comes in such a combustion that the person hardly knows what they're doing or they don't know what they're saying and interpretation is the same way they know not what they're going to say they have no more idea they're going to say it because it's supernatural so as long as you get the natural in it then you don't you you got natural you see but if something just grabs you and takes a hold of you and you're doing it would have to be an order in service of a man couldn't control it because he is a man that has yet supposed to be controlled he can control himself yes just like yeah that's right that's right he feels it see I like the Bible said if if there be one who speaks in tongues and there'll be no interpreter then let him hold his peace now of course say princess I'm staying here or anybody when you're fixing to shout same thing do you ever feel the power of God come on you when you start to shout how many ever did that well all of us have see you just sit there you feel it coming now there's times when you can quench that see you hold it see it's not right what if you're standing talking to the the president in the United States are you standing here talking to the mayor of the city and you just talk about something other right out on the street you're talking to a bunch of people and all at once you just felt like you could jump up and down and scream the Lord Glory Hallelujah kick against everything right up down the street like that they'd say it's crazy he didn't say that man's crazy see well see you know better than to do that then although it's just digging down in you you just can't hardly hold it you say yes sir yes sir yeah yes sir boys he's just digging into pieces but you know to hold your piece right there like in a courthouse you're not long ago they had some Pentecostals up for for uh uh doing something you know they're screaming too loud or something which it was absolutely legitimate she's right but every time the judge you go to speak go to say something to him they'd talk in town see the judge said take them crazy people away from here see now if they've been an interpretation of that tongues and told a judge thus saith the Lord certain certain thing that would have been true thus saith the Lord judge what are you standing here judge me for when last night you lived with a prostitute her name is Sally Jones she lived down 44 some certain place like that why do you judge me that's thus saith the Lord now deny that you'll drop dead ah oh brother there's something different there but when you stand to speak and he said you're a barbarian to him see you know when to hold your peace and when not to do it see that's see on you get me straight now you know what I mean see that is certainly we got that question right on down here the reason I was holding it like this we got the same thing or they're supposed to hold a piece that's reason I didn't answer it out no more than what she was saying but that's the time answer it now and see right now we'll get it also on this question down here and I'll just refer back to it does everybody understand that question all right that yes brother friend certainly yes sir Cedar calls the Holy Spirit speaks in every language see on day of Pentecost every language under Heaven Must gather together see speaking in English now I always know this uh brother Freddie myself that I'm if I ever preach a sermon is any anointing to it it's the spirit given the utterance just see it said see so that would be an unknown time to a man that didn't understand English but yet and it's like the unknown tongue is not an unknown tongue it's it's somebody there like on the day of Pentecost he said all these Sinners and said how do we hear every man in our own language how do we hear these galileans speak in our own language there was no Unknown about that at all there's no such a thing as unknown tongues at Pentecost and see that's not scriptural at all see it wasn't unknown it wasn't no unknown tongue it was a language how here we every man in our own language wherein we were born nothing Unknown about it all see is that any question on that now right now before we leave it how here we ever a man in our own language things people will will fail to uh accept anything or they say I won't believe it anyway on that cardiac's people well if they had it according to Acts 2 4 they certainly wouldn't speak in an unknown time and the language of the people heard you see because every man heard in his own language now if I receive the Holy Ghost right now according to I say I believe there's one brother here seeking the Holy Ghost which is is uh as uh brother wood is that right brother wood I don't mean to call you out but at all we're just Brethren here and we're wanting to say this and um he's seeking the baptism the Holy Ghost now if brother Banks receive the Holy Ghost there the correct way if he received according to the Bible he'd rise up there speaking he's speaking in English and saying Jesus Christ the son of God has raised he speak it with fiery prophecies that tells it I know that he is because he's just come into my heart he's a Son of God my sins are gone there's nothing happened to me see there you are that's speaking in the how here are we ever men in our own language say what if we Indiana people spoke a different language from the Kentucky people and brother Banks is a Kentuckian they spoke a different language then and here we know that he couldn't speak Indiana language and then he raised up there speaking and in the in Indiana language you know what he don't know it see and we hear him in Indiana language he's thinking he's speaking Kentucky language he's just testifying praise God Jesus is raised in the dead Hallelujah but we're hearing him in Indiana language that's what it was on a day of Pentecost see how do we hear every man see or behold are not all these which are speaking galileans see kentuckians and how do we Indiana Ohio and Illinois and Maine and Massachusetts and Californians hear him in our language wherein we were born get the ID see it's inspiration see it's inspiration to them to hear its inspiration to them see the mess the thing of this is the testimony of the resurrection of Jesus Christ see that's right now if God doesn't live that life in you no matter how much you testify of it you still didn't get it dude that's right how were you is there another question now yes very good brother Roy it was at uh at the right where I'm going now yeah but uh Beaumont was it Beaumont yes sir now the prayer line was stopped there's a little Spanish girl come up on the platform well Frank I believe it's going out wasn't it Howard was taking me out and um and uh this uh I I heard somebody crying his little Spanish girl there oh about 15 16 years old right just a kid and um and I looked and she had been the next prayer car if I'd went ahead I had a bunch up there should be in the next prayer card I shall bring her on so they brought her on up I was going over to another meeting and um I said bring her on up so I come to find out I said to her something like this um now will you believe if Jesus will help me to tell you what's wrong with you will you believe that uh that uh he will heal you and she just kept her head down I thought she must be deaf and dumb see so when I looked again I said no she just can't speak English so they got an interpreter come there and I said will you believe it she motioned back to it then she could understand Through The Interpreter of course well then I said now look and I saw a vision I said I see you setting by an old-fashioned fireplace and a big kid will swinging Out full of ears of yellow corn you remember that brother right I said you overeat that car and when you did you fell violently ill and your mother puts you on the bed and you started with epileptic fits and I said you've had him ever since and then she turns around to The Interpreter and said to him through her own language I thought he couldn't speak English or speak Spanish and he turned to me and said you didn't speak Spanish did you I said no so we looked on the recorder stop the recorders is absolutely English but then The Interpreter said you tell me what he said then see he had his interpretation he said you tell me what he said and she said the very same words back to him and you give it out again now she heard me in her own language wherein she was born I speak in English she heard it in Spanish how here we ever men in our own tongue War when we were born and the child was healed see that's it it's a wonderful works of God spirit ah will not will just be a vessel and the one who feels it can't go with what whatever he desires that's right exactly right and then watch what it's filled with then you know where you got the holy ghost or not and see just watch what it's still with if the if the vessel is filled with impurities then it Ebbs and not God's vessel but it's filled with purities then it is God's vessel see what I mean oh sure and there was another man standing by and after what I had said I was sorry because I felt that I had said the wrong thing and the reason why I felt it was wrong because the man who was standing there listening could have been offended by what I said but later the man who I thought was offended was not because he heard it other than what I had spoken so I said God corrected it because he said I was sorry that's exactly right sure oh we all we see that I've seen that many times yes we all we know we're acquainted with those things I'll be that with number four do all do all holy ghost fill people speak with tongues sooner or later I find where Paul said I speak with more tongues than than them all now what I think now to finish the brother's question Paul speaking before tongues and all Paul was a smart man he knowed many languages himself see he could speak with he remember when he'd get in trial he could speak of this kind of tongue or that kind of a tongue or whatever it was that's unknown tongues to the people but that wasn't inspirational that was talk languages you seen but uh and uh but I do believe that a Spirit-filled person that lives under the altar of God no doubt sooner or later will have an experience of speaking in tongue because that's one of the lowest and least things there is according to Paul's description if you put him in order it's the last thing on the line of gifts see it's speaking with him but now first you're baptized here each one of you all are gifts I'm on the outside Now by one door one Spirit one door enters this room is that right I think coming that way can't come in this way back that way see how do I get easier my brother Roberson Nelson um well how do I get in by one door by one spirit the spirit is there all the time oh please see by one spirit I am baptized into this fight now this is Spirit you are a gift to say well that's God I'll go over and say there's a there's brother Woods he's uh Meredith see oh I had a miracle performance because I performed America not by one Miracle are we already all right I'm baptized into this body amen I'm into it now the worst father go to YouTube Seeley over something close to the door no doubt this would be one of the first things that happened but it might not be I might be so much richer in the spirit that I could go come over here to Brother Wolf bypass all the rest of it you can't tell me I haven't got the Holy Ghost because I'm in this body of a baptism but God never brought me in here to say well that's God just to sit down and I'll take her easy I'm going to heaven you know what I mean but I could go Plumb back for this here come back to there you know what I mean I could go from one extreme to the other or am I the one in the middle or anywhere but something will happen something's got to take place and what is it by the spirit baptism shows me that I'm in the body by one Spirit you get that brother uh here I have to uh I have to give a little a couple little testimonies about what brother random was saying and I was jotting them down um I know a very very good friend of mine he I've known him from a whole life he was um they had meetings I don't know if it was at North Side uh well I'll say who was it was David Phillips how many know Brother David Phillips he was um I don't know if the meetings were at North Side or if they were in Canada and there was a lot of people there was there was a there was actually there was one sister in particular at the altar there may have been more people but Brother David was praying for some of the people and this sister is from Quebec Canada I know her well also her family well and she was asking the Lord I don't know if she was seeking the Holy Spirit or what she was asking for but she didn't speak English very well and when Brother David came up and laid his hands on her and started praying she heard perfect French as Brother David was praying and Brother David doesn't know any French and she came back afterwards and I think she told them Brother David I didn't know that you spoke French and he said I didn't I don't speak French but as brother Branham was saying and I think it's Acts 2 and 4 that at the day of Pentecost they went out and they were praying or they were preaching and praying for the people and they were praying in not unknown tongues but they were praying in other languages that they didn't know as the spirit gave them utterance and they said how can these people they're they're not Greeks or they're not these these other uh races how can they be speaking in our language and that is as brother Branham was talking about that is one of the tongues that we very very seldom see but they're very useful I think I gave did I give the testimony about brother shabangu and how he was fasting and he was asking the Lord to give to help him to learn the pygmy language in Congo and and after a seven day fast brother Jonathan he sat down at his meal and he got hungry and he prayed and he began speaking fluently in that language and he is today on the field witnessing and preaching to the people in the jungles of Congo so we see we see these things they uh they happen they they mentioned the Milltown for the brand mentioned the Milltown Baptist Church I was in Milltown witnessing I just go out and try to find somebody to listen to me I guess and I was in Milltown which is about an hour west of Jeffersonville and I came to the corner and um I I saw this lady come out of the shop she owned this like second-handed store right in the middle of town and um she came out and she was doing something and I asked her I I talked to her a little about about the Lord she said oh I'm a Christian we talked for a while I said you ever hear of William Branham she said when I was a girl she said we had a little church over here and she said brother Branham would come in every so often and she was one of the pastors that we had and and he would preach there brother I'm talking about the Milltown Baptist Church she was there and she said they had a pot-bellied stove a big cast iron stove and she said that that they would March around in the winter times with that stove going they would March around singing Onward Christian Soldiers and the whole church would March March around the church around that stove she said at the sawdust floor and uh you know what she did we had such a nice conversation she gave me she still had the stove she brought me down into the basement I think it was of her store and she said this is it I was like oh wow I've put my hand on it and she said you know what you can have it so she gave it to me and I brought it back and they have it at voice of God Recordings now but really really sweet lady she talked about brother Branham and and the great times that they had um I really appreciated I have to uh I gotta read the quote um paragraph 47 let me go back to it brother Branham says uh I love this this just made me this made me feel so good with all my failures that happened every day and and every time I try to do something and I fail brother Branham said this he said when you when you were there you were sincere he was talking about the brother that was preaching and he was doing the best that he could and he was preaching and then brother bran didn't say what it was and he didn't say what it was but he got enlightened about something and then he said brother Graham should I go back to those people that I preached to my brother Pam said no that made oh that made me feel so good about all the mistakes that I made he said he says when you were there you were sincere he says I know the brother as I say that's wrote these questions with the deepest of sincerity and a real genuine Christian you did the best that you could do with all that you know how to do and that's all God requires does that make you feel good we all the mistakes that we made Lord I tried I was I was trying I just that that uh that really meant a lot to me I hope it meant a lot to you let's stand I don't know if it was that brother I think it probably was he was seeking the Lord and he was asking about a Ministry and brother Branham said something on the other on the order of well um I know this man that wrote this question he's a genuine man of God with a real calling in his in his life but but I couldn't tell him I thought well there's his answer right there I bet you he was he was right out on the field as as we close friends we had a prayer request come in and uh let me let me read it here prayer request from Sister Amelia I I noticed that she wasn't here she doesn't miss very often she said please keep me in your prayers I had an eye specialist appointment my eyes are dilated and I can't drive right now the good news is they didn't find anything wrong with them the cataracts
