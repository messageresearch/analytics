we don't know at all tonight we haven't learned at all we're still learning to lean on him we're still facing things that we never faced before and we have to learn all over again just to lean on him i want you to know he is a leaning post you can cast it all on him and you'll never knock him over he'll stand firm and secure for all of us this evening thank you for the music tonight and i want to apologize to all of you for my voice it's very aggravating to listen to have you ever listened to someone who's hoarse and you want to clear their throat you're sitting there oh if i could just clear his throat and help him out well you won't be able to do that tonight all i can do is give what i have to him and ask him to help us would you turn in your bible to isaiah 40 and i want to thank you for coming this evening thank brother aaron for the invitation to be here today and it's an honor to be here and the presence of the lord was with us we had some texts come in those who were streaming i wasn't even aware that they were streaming and they were blessed in the service today and sometimes we forget about those who we can't see but they're they're with us and they have needs and they're saying virtual amens we can't hear them maybe feel them but we're one body tonight whether we could be here in person or not we're part of this great body of christ we pray for the seniors my heart is for those who are unable to be here who are fighting sickness maybe also the enemy puts a little fear and they have to press through that my heart goes out to people because they would so love to be with us this evening so let's ask the lord to go right out to them and touch them where they are amen isaiah 40. beginning in verse 28 the scripture said hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as the eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint how many of you appreciate the word of the lord tonight i want to read just emphasize just a moment a couple of places a couple of phrases before we see have our seats i love this description that isaiah he's asking a question and he said the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary i want you to know tonight that's the god we serve he's not weary he's not powerless he's not giving up on us he remains ever more strong and mighty then i notice here it says even the youths shall faint and be weary and young men utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength mount up with wings as the eagles shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint let's pray together for just a moment lord jesus we need you tonight we need your help we need your touch we need your presence we need the anointing that destroys every yoke that sets every captive free we need help tonight to keep pressing in and pressing on in this good fight of faith i asked lord tonight that you would touch this throat this voice of mine that you would clear my voice that you would give it strength so that i might minister to this your people bought with a price redeemed by the blood of the lamb they neither belong to this church nor to any minister they are the sheep of your pasture and you've laid everything down on their behalf and i ask you tonight to walk the aisles of this house and minister who you are in a supernatural way jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever anoint our hearts to receive your word and remind us o god that you have called us to live above every circumstance of life and you have made the way possible for us to get up above it all and we thank you for that in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saints said you may be seated this evening for a moment or two this evening i want to minister about soaring above it all and you know what the prophet has taught us concerning those four living creatures that constantly stand in the presence of god giving him praise and when we read their description we find out that we're looking at a beast we're looking at a man we're looking at an eagle but there is not a description or an action that is attached to all of the four creatures when john got down to the last the one that is most significant in our age he said he had the appearance of a flying eagle now notice it wasn't a a beast a burden-bearing beast brother branham explains that that's what the beast represented it it didn't say a walking talking man it didn't say a roaring lion or some other description of a beast or an animal but when it come to the end he said he has the appearance of a flying eagle so in my mind's eye i see the eagle but he's not perched on a limb somewhere looking surveying at all but when i have an image of a flying eagle i see one that has caught the wind he's no longer pecking around in a valley he's not perched in a tree somewhere but he's taken to the sky and from where he is he sees things a whole lot differently than he would if he were walking around here on the earth that's the anointing the overcoming anointing that was attached to the age that we live in the anointing of a flying eagle and i want you to know that if you and i will allow the spirit of the lord his word will catch us up to a higher place above our problems come on above our aches and our pains and our symptoms above our situations that tend to weigh us down and cause us to be earthbound but brother aaron we were not created to be earthbound to be tethered to the trials of life god has ordained a way for you and i to be caught up above everything that's going on around us and see things from heaven's point of view for me it's the only way to overcome if i'm only looking at what i can see from earth's vantage point it looks bigger than it really is and sometimes it looks impossible but when i can get up a little bit higher when i start feasting on the living word of god it catches me up it causes me to want to spread my wings just a little bit and not just sit perched in a tree somewhere but it causes me to want to get a little higher and experience all that he has for us even in this dark hour and we mentioned this morning that there's darkness everywhere and it's increasing in the world out there but it's supposed to be getting brighter help me just a little bit we know that it's prophesied that it will become closer and closer to total insanity out there but they're supposed to be light in here when we come together with other believers we're not focusing on what's going on out there we're catching another wave we're catching another burst of wind by the spirit of god that says come on up just a little bit higher i've got a new thought for you i have a new perspective for you how many of you know that you can for instance what i like i like a lot of things about tucson i don't want to offend you there's a few things i don't like but i like a lot about it one i like the fact that there are very few high buildings i like to be on one side of the city and see clean to the other side without a skyscraper in my way so i appreciate that about this city but i've been in cities where the buildings are so tall you're standing at them you can hardly see the top but when you get in the airplane and that airplane begins to take you 30 000 feet or more on a cloudless day and you can look down and see downtown atlanta or downtown dallas or wherever you might be what looked so huge when you were standing at the foot of it looking up looks like a little lego block that i step on used to step on so much when the kids were little tiny little building block is all it looks like and now that building size hasn't changed same building same dimensions same size but your perspective your vantage point has changed i want to tell you what looks so bad right now if you and i can allow the word to catch us into a higher place with an anointing of a flying eagle because that's how the message came to us and it came to us in that way so that we could also be lifted up to another vantage point and begin to see things from heaven's point of view and realize that mountains become mole hills insurmountable obstacles become tiny little fences that we can just seemingly step over when we change our perspective when we allow the holy spirit to cause us to be what we were created to be and by the way that wasn't a chicken in the barnyard it wasn't a buzzard somewhere in the far but you and i are eagles brother branham said we are spiritual astronauts and we were created to be higher than what we are right now and we have to allow the holy spirit to catch us to pull us into a spiritual dimension that changes our perspective and the way that we look at things that we're going through right now how many of you understand it's a simple thought but i have to be reminded of it quite often in a message whoa be right back in the message putting on the whole armor of god because we mentioned that this morning in 1962 brother branham said in paragraph 82 the chief the chief is leading us home he said come on home in my father's house are many mansions if it wasn't so i'd have told you i'll not leave you comfortless he's quoting the scripture i'll come again and be with you even in you to the end of the world the works that i do shall you do also a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for i will be with you even in you to the end of the world chief leading on amen now listen to what he says my lord knows the way through the wilderness all i have to do is what follow he knows the way you're passing through territory that you've never been through before but the lord knows the way without your spiritual eyes being open you can't see five minutes into the future but god's already been there he's timeless he's not bound by time he's eternal he's already been in your future he already knows what's just ahead of you and he's leading the way and all you and i have to do is follow behind him brother branham said all i have to do is follow amen he said hear the tramping of the army marching on to victory not paying any attention to all the unbelief and the old crows and the buzzards that are hollering around here we're eagles he said hallelujah we're eagles let's soar out of everything amen now this was his perspective we were not created to be caught up in everything that's going on around us we were created to be caught up into higher realm and he built those eagles naturally in the same manner just like you and i are built that way spiritually did you know an eagle can soar up to 15 thousand feet in a burst consistently an eagle can fly ten thousand feet but he has the ability to burst into fifteen thousand feet now that's about half the height of a jet flying above our heads and we find that no other bird can fly quite as high as the eagle he's specially built for the heights i want to tell you little bride you are specially built for the heights to get up above it all the eagle has a seven up to a seven foot wingspan and those wings enable him to glide and he does it with very little energy he doesn't have to flap those wings did you know the eagle doesn't have to use a lot of energy by flapping his wings he has five primary feathers on the tips of both of his wings and he literally has the ability to circle those feathers to rotate them just like this he doesn't have to flap that big seven foot wingspan he just takes the tips of his feathers on his wings and he begins to rotate them like that in a uh in a circular motion and those who study eagle say that it creates a centrifugal force that pushes the eagle higher and higher into the sky not only that it creates a centrifugal force that flows from his chest all the way back to his tail feather and that's how a mother eagle or a father eagle is able to draw its little ones up to itself when they're kicked out of the nest when they're training for flight and they get a little far away from mama or papa that eagle will just fly above them not not not adam just above them almost suspend itself in midair and will do nothing but circulate those little feathers in hebrew that's nasha the word is nasha in hebrew and it means to to pull up under one's bosom that little eagle will just circulate those feathers and that little baby eaglet that's gotten too far away from mama and daddy and the flying lessons the force of that energy will cause that little baby to be sucked right up under the breast of that mother or that father i want you to know you have a papa eagle i want you to remember tonight that your papa eagle is flying above you when you get a little too far away for comfort all he has to do is just rotate those little feathers and pull us hallelujah right back up under him the bible tells us in in the writings of the zombies underneath are the everlasting arms he has the ability to just pull us right up i love the fact that the eagle doesn't have to use a lot of energy he just sets his wings and he's built and designed so aerodynamically that he just catches the wind and any any any breeze that blows he can just set his wings it's like tightening your elbows like this he just sets his wing and the wind does the work i want you to know you can't depend on your own strength to get up above what you're going through right now but papa has provided a way if you'll just set your wings and put your trust in him the holy spirit of god will lift you up above it give you a different perspective help you i know he'll help us to soar above whatever it is that the enemy is trying to use to destroy us do you believe that in the countdown paragraph 76 brother branham says the spiritual astronaut is eagles he goes beyond all denominational creeds all in all all denominational barriers all all denominational thinkings all their cloudy thoughts he gets above every cloud everything there is to look at he's around he's up around the stars the astronaut and the astronaut believer is also up in the heavenlies he's far beyond these earth-bound things lord lift us tonight we get weary with the news we get weary with the covid we get weary with the politics around us we get weary with seeing our children in trouble lord will you just lift us up into a higher place he said he's far beyond these earthbound things he's up high he's in outer space he's talking about you and i he's talking about the spiritual astronaut he said see the earthly man doesn't know very much about outer space but if the astronauts in outer space he's there with it he knows more about what's going on above than he does what's going on down here i advise you tonight to spend more time investigating this great truth than being carried away with everybody's blog post and everybody's podcast come on now i encourage you to bury yourself in this word and see if it won't lift you above what you're fighting right now he'll come in the truck he'll come in the home he'll come wherever we listen to this lifting word that god has sent and he'll try to catch us up a little bit higher if we'll go with him how many of you'd like to just set your wings and get up above some of this stuff god knows we need to do that now in the message countdown same message different city paragraph 81 we just read from shreveport and this is from jeffersonville he said god i hope you'll stay with me because before i'm done i want to share something else god wants man who can come into christ and believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever and don't take their own thinking but move on out into space controlled by the holy ghost i'm quoting i'm not making this up controlled by the holy ghost he said amen astronauts phew how far it is back from the old horse and buggy how far it is even from the airplane how far it is from justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost they're coming to eagles now listen to this first they were lizards then they become chickens then they become crows this is strange talk now they're eagles you'll hear brother branham saying in most places once an eagle always an eagle he's not describing who you are he's describing our behavior along the way and how many of you know we were always eagles elected before we got to this earth chosen to get above it all in the end time every bit of that in god's great foreknowledge no doubt about it but we didn't always live like eagles hello we don't always live like eagles tonight but we are sometimes we crawl around like lizards sometimes we peck around like chickens sometimes we flock around like crows and other times we recognize who we are and we allow the spirit of god to lift us into a higher place of revelation and truth he goes on to say an eagle is a special bird he can go higher than any other bird he's prepared to see to keep his head level when he gets up there there's some people can jump way up and don't know where they're at after they get there because they can't see no farther than what he's jumped but there's some that can look back and see what's going on that's the eagle maybe i just need to remind you tonight that brother adam didn't just type the prophet to the eagle he typed the prophetic believer to the eagle to the one that follows the prophetic word you are also an eagle he can stand there till he looks it over and waits till he hears a message that tells him what to do what to say that's the astronaut of god do you remember brother branham saying the bride will have thus saith the lord or she will keep still come on now you and i can hear a word from him we can be listening to a tape and god's voice ring out in such a profound way that you wonder if he was just talking directly to you he was because you were born to hear that word it's for us it's to lift us up to get us above some of the junk that goes on in our lives you know an eagle he doesn't build his nest low to the ground he always makes sure that he builds his nest above the snake line you see there's a place out in the canyons that the snake won't go any higher he'll crawl and crawl and crawl he'll climb a tree they'll do all kinds of things but there is a height that you won't find any serpent able to crawl into that space now i don't know if it's some particular number or if it's just some sense or something but i know that there is a place where the snake won't go and an eagle with their intuition they'll never build their nest down in that snake line they always want to try to find a place that's higher than where the serpent crawls that's a safe place how many of you believe we've got a safe place far above the snake line now eagles are hunters they've got razor sharp talons and claws and they're curved razor-sharp and they can catch the prey and those long talons can inflict serious wounds in battle because sometimes there's a war going on and the eagle has to use those sharp talons to take out his enemy you and i have an enemy and we have the weapon that we need to defeat that enemy if you believe that same man all right and there's so many things that we can say about this eagle the easter seal paragraph 186 phoenix brother branham said but in the last message that went forth there come a flying eagle it's eagle time reveal time the word of god man made manifest the word of god proved in the fourth seal just bear with me in the fourth seal he said but in the eagle age paragraph 120 he said but in the eagle age the last stage the prophetic age where there is to rise prophetic utterance see to whom the secrets always come he describes in this paragraph the the appetite of the eagle and that eagle won't eat just anything he's looking for a particular kind of diet and we know that and it's the revealed word of the hour and you can say amen and then the eagle vision is eyesight it's unmatched in the world of birds eight times sharper than that of humans it contains many more color sensitive cones and that's in the eye a a human eye has between 147 and 181 000 of these cones in the eye it's like pixels on a computer screen so a human eye 147 147 000 to 181 000 and if someone has perfect vision it can go all the way up to 281 thousand but an eagle has one million cones in the weaker of its two eyes god so created that eagle that he even placed his eye on the side of his head so that it extends his peripheral vision in a in an amazing way the eyes of an eagle are specifically designed for long distance focus with absolute clarity the eagle eye is one of the strongest in the entire animal kingdom four to eight times stronger than that of an average human an eagle is able to spot a rabbit two miles away now that's pretty good isn't it their eyes are stated to be larger in size than their brain by weight so a divine creator when he was building that eagle he created his eyes in a super fashion because the scripture was going to use that eagle and the message of the hour was going to use that eagle in type with a spiritual overcoming believer i like that i like that a lot but that's not what i want to share that was part one and i'm struggling a bit to get this out with my voice but it's coming it's coming but the scripture said they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles there is a behavior some of you know this well there is an observed behavior in certain varieties of eagles that have baffled scientists for many many years it's a period of time in an eagle's life when he goes so weary and so tired he becomes so weighted down with a body that is no longer functioning as it was created to function some scientists have called it a molting period because there are other birds who go through something similar but ancient writers didn't call it a molting period they called it a moping period moping anybody get it have you ever known any moping eagles you may be sitting on a pew with someone who has gotten weary and tired and worn out in this life they haven't given up on jesus they're just a little burned out hello you know even church oh even church can burn us out sometime you got to do the helping now it can wear us out same old same old same old i'm going to come down there and see you closer in a minute if you don't help me routine ritual we sing the same songs thousands of glorious songs and we sing the same ones because we think that there were no other songwriters after 65 nobody could catch any inspiration you better listen to what i'm saying god didn't stop giving inspiration for songs when brother branham left the scene he wasn't a songwriter now i love the old songs i can feel you i feel you i love the old songs i love the old hymns more than life i love those words because they bring conviction and they bring the gospel and they're not experience based they're word-based but it wouldn't hurt us every now and again i hope you agree because you were i noticed this morning you you picked up a few that aren't from the 1950s you see sometimes we need something that'll just mix it up a little bit so that we don't raise our hands at the same time in every we come to that phrase we know exactly what we're going to do we become automatic robotic creatures worship was never supposed to be that way it's supposed to be instant it's supposed to be spontaneous it's supposed to be inspired it's supposed to be anointed i want you to know the worship and creating an atmosphere for the word to go forth is one of the most important things that you and i can do to enter in to a service by singing the best that we can if it's a song you've sung all your life forget about it and sing it as though you have never sung it before when you come into this house because there's somebody here to bring a message that you and i are going to need and brother branham tells us that the atmosphere is very very important all right that's why i believe harmony was so beautiful and so successful this year because we brought it home so to speak brother bobby it was a sacred atmosphere maybe it took us a few minutes to to get used to how things would be because there's no curtain to go behind and there was no hall lining up and and it was just different but i loved it from the start all the way to the finish and i grieved the next morning i did i woke up monday morning grieved because we couldn't come and do it all again monday night what made it so special familiar songs and beautiful things that we've heard in the past over at the hotel but the atmosphere was so conducive to worship that i i had no idea i'd be worshiping up here i thought i'd be worshiping back there somewhere but i couldn't contain myself because such an atmosphere was created as we begin to sing the songs of zion don't get in a rut come on moping eagles we're almost home the fight of the good fight of faith is being fought we're closer home than we've ever been before we can't stay down in the mulley grubs in this hour we've got to pull ourselves up out of that place of moping and grieving we cannot grieve for what was we have to reach forward and embrace what god has for us in this new hour we can't go back we can't go back you're never ever ever going to have a a pastor like brother green because they don't they don't build them that way anymore he was one of a kind oh my i'm like you i find myself so often i wished i would have asked brother greene about that i wished i would have had another conversation with him about that i know you feel the same way don't you and we i grieve still and when we come here we see him and we think about him and so forth but i want you to know the enemy would like to lock us in a box and we cannot be boxed in in this hour because we've got somewhere to go and it's higher yes we were ordained to get up above the depression of life and the circumstances of life let me read this before i offend you this was this was a commentator his name was clark and i'm reading him because he quoted some ancient writers he said in verse 31 they shall mount up with wings as eagles he said this should could also have been translated they shall put forth fresh feathers like the molting eagle let me spell that m-o-u-l-t-i-n-g molting eagle he said it's been a common and popular opinion that the eagle lives live excuse me that the eagle lives and retains his vigor to a great age and that beyond the common lot of other birds as he gets older he molts in his old age it's a sad time in an eagle's life he goes through a lot of things but it ends well because in the end his feathers are renewed his ability to fly is restored his identity is restored he remembers who he is and why he was born and and when he leaves this earth he doesn't leave it in a broken down mulching place of grief and depression but god says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength their feathers shall be restored i will lift them up on their wings above the depressing circumstances of life i tell you brother that's a promise i'm going to hold on to that how many of you believe god can do that in your life as a believer because you're over 50 doesn't mean that you've lived out your best days i want you to know i believe that god has something for us in the holy spirit as we feast on this word that we can come into a place where we forget about our age let me see who amen's because i'm going to give you a quote in a minute and you'll all amen then once you find out that brother branham said this very thing when that presence of god comes we don't look around and start trying to remember how old we are and how we're not able to do what we used to do when that presence of the lord comes down some old feeble grandma who could hardly walk in the service today but when that spirit of the lord comes on her she remembers that her feathers are being renewed come on now and she can stand up as long as the young poke the young folk can and she can wave her arms in praise and shout love to her god like she did when she was young because the presence of the lord is a transforming force and it's a renewing force that god sends us if we trust in him there was a let me read this there was a an ancient writer whose name was saint ambrose and he made some notes about the eagle in latin and the translation is this the eagle lives to a very advanced age and in molting his youth is renewed with new feathers a jewish writer from ancient times wrote this long mayest thou live o king still like the eagle renew thy youth and still retain thy vigor an ancient rabbi sadius wrote this every tenth year the eagle flies closer to the sun and when no able not able any longer to bear the burning heat will fall down into the sea and lose her feathers thus renewing her strength and her vigor perhaps you're familiar with the eagle messages that were passed around in the 90s 80s and 90s around message believers a series of eagle sermons from a baptist pastor whose name was pastor bobby thompson did anybody ever hear those tapes believers gave them to me i know you wouldn't maybe want to admit it you know but believers gave it to me and they said you got to hear this this man is not a message believer he's a baptist pastor but he's preaching about the eagle in a way we've never heard before and i listened and i became so interested in what he had to say that i had an interview with this man and it really really made a difference in my thoughts about the eagle let me tell this and see if any of you will find it at all familiar because i've heard many preachers mention this bobby thompson was invited by the cherokee uh first nations tribe in cherokee north carolina to come and observe an important uh place a sacred place in the smoky mountains of north carolina and they assigned when he agreed and the reason why they invited him is because they knew he loved eagles and he was always preaching about eagles and they heard it and they said we want to show you something about eagles that you have never seen before we're sure you haven't and he agreed and he went and he met an indian god cherokee indian guide they took him to a valley in in the smoky mountains somewhere between cherokee north carolina and maggie valley north carolina he promised that he would never reveal the exact spot and this was so far off the beaten path that he said i was just hoping they didn't get mad at me and leave me out there to find my way back by myself because he said we went so far into those smoky mountains that i didn't know if we would ever get back to any kind of society the indian god set him down on the side of a mountain and put a pair of binoculars in his hand and said to him preacher i'd like for you to survey this valley and i'd like for you to tell me how many eagles you see and with his natural eyes he looked out across the valley he didn't see any eagles at all he said look closer and he said i was i was looking out across that valley to the other mountain over there and i was looking all up and around and turning my head and i couldn't see an eagle anywhere and he said well let me see how many i count and he counted about 30 the indian god he counted about 30. and bobby said i can't see them he said no you're looking in the wrong place he said what do you mean i'm looking where eagles usually are in the sky he said oh no they're not in the sky this is a valley of death the eagles come here to die they don't come here to live but he said some of these eagles they find their way and they renew their and they live for many more years bobby said to the indian god he said what's the difference what determines whether or not an eagle comes here to die or whether he uses this as a place of renewal and he began to explain to him that the cherokee indians have observed eagles for so many hundreds of years they've become so familiar with their behavior that they have been able to identify this molting period in their life and at a certain age or as brother branham described it in a cycle of life the eagle would begin to show his age his feathers would begin to wilt and unravel and he would really look a mess he would fly down from all over the country the indians said i believe there are eagles here from nearly every state where eagles survive they come here to this valley and they fly down into the bottom floor of the valley and they begin to walk around like other birds he said we have watched them closely for all of these years and they're only here for a short amount of time before they forget how to fly that's about the saddest thing i can think of in the life of an eagle that it would forget how to fly the talons become brittle and crack and break therefore rendering the eagle unable to catch its prey to feed itself feathers bloody tattered torn he said let me show you this and he pointed out some eagles that were wallowing in the dirt like a dog would wallow around in the yard he said they get so depressed they get so low they forget how to fly and they wallow around in the dirt and the dust until they die this is so sad for me to think about he said there is a calcium crust that starts forming on their beak and they breathe through holes not a nose like you and i have but holes there on the face and this calcium deposit like a crust begins to form over the breathing hole suffocating the life of that old eagle until he eventually draws his last breath unable to fly wallowing around in the dirt no longer the king of the birds the regal creature that it was created to be but now an old broken down bird with broken talons and bloody feathers and a crusty beak and it draws its last breath just about the time that bobby was going to ask another question the eagle said oh the indians said wait a minute he said look there with the binoculars he said i see some eagles that are circling up above and bobby said well what are they doing he said they're looking for prey they're about to prepare a feast for the dying eagles in the valley hear me now i hope you're not too bored to hear what i'm going to say these are younger eagles the bobby said to the to the indian these are younger eagles he said sometimes usually but not always he said i'll explain that to you later he said but what they're going to do is they're going to go down and they're going to catch a rabbit and they're going to pull that rabbit apart using their strong sharp talons and their strong sharp beak they're going to pull that in little pieces and then they're going to fly down over the valley and they're going to drop handfuls on purpose they're going to feed those eagles who have lost their ability to feed themselves is anybody with me and he said in that moment it's going to be determined which eagle lives and which eagle dies folks if you stop eating you're going to die if we don't utilize the resources that god has given us in this message and we stop eating because we think we've learned it all we're gonna die you better not let your pride keep you from reaching up and taking a piece of fresh meat when somebody passes by to drop it to you or when you're able to put that tape in and hear the voice of god speaking to you in that manner he said if these eagles and he pointed them out and now now bobby could see them through the through the binoculars he could see all these eagles wallowing around and rolling around in the dirt he said it was the saddest thing he'd ever seen and he said i gotta see this it'll be like a feeding frenzy when that food comes dropping down and the indians said no no no it won't you'll be surprised it'll be one here it'll be one there nobody knows why an eagle chooses to eat when he's dying and why he chooses not to eat but he said you've got to see it for yourself and he said they dropped down little tiny pieces of rabbit that had been torn apart and here comes one eagle and maybe another one will come and they crawl can you imagine crawling in the dirt to get over there and eating that piece of of fresh meat and finally another one would come and he said i noticed that less than half of the eagles would even eat and the indian god said by morning most of those down there will be dead he said but we're going to give it a day and i'm going to bring you back out here and show you what happens to those eagles that choose to eat and so a day later he goes out and he's looking around to try to find the eagles and he sees so many dead they didn't eat the food that was prepared and dropped for them and they died and they're just laying their carcasses everywhere and he said hey where are the eagles that chose to eat the food i don't see them did they not eat enough did they die as well and the indian god said raise your binoculars up just a little bit out of the valley oh i know the punch line so i'm already excited just a little bit all about 10 feet off the ground you don't have to get very high just about 10 feet off the ground and he began to scour the edge of the canyon on the other side there's an eagle they're they're not flying yet they don't have enough breath to fly they don't have enough strength to fly but they've gotten just enough brother to use the bend of their uh wings like elbows have you ever felt like that pulling themselves up an inch at a time they know it's like the little men in the bible why should we hear till we die if we stay here we're going to die if we go there we may die but we may not so the little eagles make the same decision we may not make it all the way to the top we may not get our flight back but at least we won't have to die down here with those who refuse to eat so they start climbing and they climb and they climb and they climb if you thought they looked bad when they were down in the dirty valley you ought to see them as they climbed the mountain he said we came back the next day and i was looking down low for him and he said raise your binoculars again so he raised his binoculars up and they'd made it about halfway across the mountain and he pointed them out there's one there's one there's one they were moving about an inch at a time there's something in that eagle that says i've got to get out of this i can't lay here and die like this i can't fizzle out like this i was born for something bigger than this do you hear what i'm saying and so they're using all they have to start climbing up out of that valley oh hallelujah hallelujah let me stop and read i'll come back i want you to hear what the prophet said letting off the pressure let me see what time it is thank you paragraph 40. going to be a little bit of reading here i hope you don't mind paragraph 40 letting off the pressure aberdeen north carolina not too far from where this event took place paragraph 40. i was reading here not long ago i preached a subject called the eagles to earth its nest in chicago and i was reading about a certain kind of eagle he said there's 40 different kinds of them they claim mean they it means a ripper with a beak god always likens his people to eagles he calls himself jehovah eagle and his little eaglets that's those who are born of him and i made a little rude illustration on that many times on that how that eagle gets their little ones ready to fly and takes them up in the air and turns them loose and if a crow tries to get up there every feather would fall out of him he's not pressurized to it see he couldn't stand the pressure did you know you were specifically built to stand the pressure of this last church age you think when you look back at the ox age you say that's the hardest age there ever was but that's not the way it is at all you're living in the most wicked age the world has ever known the the closing hours of laodicea and yet you as a believer of this message were built to withstand the pressure of this age i'm quoting again he said but the eagle is the only bird that's born with that kind of a feather that can go so high until a hawk couldn't even come around him and he's got eyes and higher you go the further you can see and what good would it do to him to get up there if he didn't have eyes to see way away he couldn't see listen he couldn't see back where he come from that's going to be important in a little bit 41 this certain kind of eagle when he begins to get old he gets weary like all of us old people well the bible said it didn't it jordan the bible said even the young people i hear way more young people telling me how tired they are than i do old people they're exhausted all the time you ever notice that about young people today they're exhausted all the time they're so worn out they can hardly get through life we're going to have to show them something after a while come on you gotta he said you couldn't see back where you come from there's too much pressure and he said there's a certain kind of eagle when he gets old he gets weary like all of us old people and he gets a crust over his head see here's brother branham telling the same kind of story gets a crust over his head he gets so weary he don't know what to do brother aaron i've been there i wouldn't know when i got there but i've been there more than once i was there oh about 18 months ago or nearly two years ago when this coveted thing began to break and my mind was so tormented by all the thoughts of how important my decisions in the next few weeks were going to be to seek the mind of god will we have service will we not have service will we ask the people to wear masks will we not ask them to wear men i got so weary in trying to make decisions that in my mind i would have liked to have resigned and ran away somewhere where i didn't have to make any more such serious decisions so weary and so worn out but i knew i couldn't stay there because there was a people depending on me to know what to do you in your life under your circumstances you get under pressure like that sometime and you don't know what to do next so brother branham said he gets so weary you don't know what to do and now the bible said the eagle renews his youth he said so i studied about this fellow and when he gets old and weary and crushed all over his head he flies just as high as he can until he finds a great high rock he sits down on the side of this rock and he sits there and beats his head on the rock now let me pick up my story and i'll come back to the quote bobby said where are these eagles going he said well the eagle has an unbelievable memory and he is going back to the rock where he was born he knows in his mind somehow in his nature i'll be all right i'll be all right if i can just get back to the rock from where i was born now brother branham says these eagles flew there and no doubt they would if they could and maybe they did but the ones that bobby thompson saw they weren't able to fly but they used every bit of strength they could get to climb that mountain through the rocks and through the rubble and through the log to get all the way back to the rock where they were born and when they got there bobby said i saw him with my own binoculars with my own eyes he said they would get back to these big old boulders that lay at the top of the smoky mountains and he said i watched them as they lay their their face down on that rock and began to scrape back and forth and back and forth sometimes even beating their head on that rock to get all that crust off of their head and off of their breathing holes so that they could breathe clearly so that their youth could be renewed isn't that powerful middle of paragraph 41 he said what's he trying to do he's trying to beat the crust off all the crust and the blood will fly out of his head he goes through all kinds of torture but as long as he can feel some of that crust on him he's got to get it off so he keeps beating his head on the rock till all the crust is off of his head and as soon as all of his crust is off his head though he's bleeding wounded he just screams let's think of it a moment to the top of his voice lebron said what's he doing he's letting off the pressure i want you to know it would do us all some good sometime to get in a real free service and let off some pressure you saw me you saw me i couldn't help myself that last was it sunday afternoon i don't know when it was i'd already preached that morning i was already just feeling good and the singing got so good and i got so excited and my buddy sitting beside me brother jim was so excited he was making me excited i didn't know until i glanced up that there were several people looking at me and i didn't want him to see me i wanted him to be focusing on what was going on in the service and i didn't want to embarrass myself so i just took a quick little trip over there behind the pulpit where the pulpit was sitting and i sat down in that chair and i raised my hands where nobody could see what expression was and i let off the pressure i just began to praise him the way i wanted to praise him normally you wouldn't have that opportunity to do it in his but i took it and i started to apologize later and then i realized that i had said that morning in service i can't apologize for praising the lord sometimes we've just got to let off the pressure and give him praise for what he's done brother branham said when he gets all that crust off he screams to the top of his voice because as soon as that crust is off his youth is renewed he said it's sure to come so as soon as all that crust is gone he can start screaming hallelujah because he knows he's got rid of all the crust his youth is about to be renewed so he can let off the pressure and start screaming because he's going back to a young eagle again he said that's wonderful i'm glad for that eagle i'm glad for that bird but he said you know i know a rock where we can go hallelujah and be in prayer till all the crust of the world is beat away from us till all the unbelief in god's word is beat away till we enter into a place where all things are possible and as soon as we got all the world and unbelief in god's word beat off of us we can scream and shout because eternal life is sure just as certain as anything because all the world has been beat off of us in another rendering of the same sermon in paragraph 76 in green lake wisconsin he said and if he can't knock it off he dies he can't breathe if he can't get rid of that crust he dies but if he gets it knocked off he'll start rejoicing and screaming you can hear him for miles just screaming because he got all the crust off he said that's wonderful i want to tell you church that's wonderful that's wonderful had he not chosen to eat the food can't force feed somebody but you can help them get to it you can give them the supernatural you can give them the tapes you can put it in their life and let them decide what they do with it but you can't force feed people but if they choose to eat it i want you to know god has given us a message that will help us get above everything that tries to keep us tethered to this whole world so bobby thompson said that with his own eyes he watched one of those eagles it made it back to the rock he saw with his own eyes it's scraping that crust off of his beak and he said i i was zeroed in on the binocular with him and i saw what looked like tears running down the eagle's face he was so happy to be back to the rock from where he had been born and bobby thompson said i watched that eagle make his way off to the edge of that rock and rare his wings back and lift up his head and let out a call that reverberated off of the rocks of the smoky mountains and he said you know i realized what he was doing he was praising his creator but he said i thought i i'd like to see if it's having any other impact so i looked down in the valley and i saw other little eagles down there that had been rolling around in the dirt they stopped and they raised their heads to try to see where that scream was coming from he said i don't know for sure but it looked to me like it gave them some encouragement hey a brother has made it all the way back to the rock a brother is sounding an alarm to say my youth is being renewed and if you'll press your way out of the valley if you'll allow your strength to be used up in getting out of the position that you're in right now you two will have a have something to to scream about he said it takes several weeks for the feathers to come back in because when that eagle is done with the crust he starts plucking those bloody feathers out one by one waiting for new feathers to come and he said i happen to be there one day when an eagle that had been spending a several weeks on the rock decided it was time to move on and i watched him as he climbed up he began to fly up above that rock and and way up into the air and i heard him as he screamed encouragement down it seemed like to all the other eagles and he said then i watched him as he went swooping right back to the valley where he had come out of and i said oh no something has gone wrong and the indian god said oh no something has gone right he's looking for a rabbit he now has the strength to feed himself but more importantly than that the first thing he's going to do is take some fresh meat back to those others hallelujah now i know life is hard and i know that we feel beat up in this end time 2022 the pressures of life the pressures of of vaccination and mandate and the pressure of not wanting to pass something on to somebody else's it's more than some of us can really function under it feels like it's more than we can stand and we get weary and we get tired just a few more moments here and we'll go we get discouraged we get tired of doing the same old thing week after week you ought to be a song leader you ought to be a preacher you ought to be a musician someone who doesn't just get to come and casually observe a service but somebody that has to put everything in every service it gets old looking for the right song to lead it gets old sometimes looking for the right message to bring and making the right decision so every one of us face our own set of pressures and circumstances and every one of us can get down in that valley and feel like there's no more hope to ever get out of it again but i want to tell you something this word releases to us an anointing of a flying eagle you can come out of the valley oh help me now let's close you can come out of the valley you can get above your stuff you can climb out of the snake line i remember there used to be an old black singer whose name was fc barnes and he used to sing this song it ain't going to sound pretty but i'm going to show you how it went he said i'm coming up on the rough side of the mountain and i'm doing my best to make it in and every time i hear that song i can see those little eagles they must be singing i'm coming up the rough side of the mountain but i am determined to find my youth renewed in the spirit i am determined not to let my problems and my circumstances keep me in the mulley grubs or in the moping period of discouragement i want to close with this quotation and thank you for being patient with me i want to get this out and be done in the message as the eagle stirs her nest paragraph 55 brother branham said as an eagle renews his youth yes sir the revival takes and shakes all the old funny feelings away from you and you fly out into an atmosphere yonder likened his heritage to an eagle because the eagle renews his youth now it makes him shout he said you watch the church it'll be sitting all dry first thing you know the holy ghost strikes them why the old person the old person that's a lot of us the old person will be up on their feet jumping shouting praising god renews their youth again that's right he said why in that moment they could do anything a young person could do folks that's what the spirit of the lord can do for your old tired bones amen brother that's what the holy spirit can do for us who have been so down and so discouraged for so long he can move in your life and cause you to feel like you're a young person again when you get in the presence of the lord he said why they can do anything a young person can do just jump and holler and scream and shout he renews his youth that's right brother brahm said i believe in that and he asked us the question don't you i want to tell you something i do i do believe in that i do believe that we have everything we need to see our spiritual youth renewed i believe we have everything we need in this word to get above every circumstance and every problem if we just make up our minds denied i'm coming out of this valley i'm determined to get to back to the rock scrape my beak and beat my face on the rock of where i was born until my my strength is renewed and my youth is restored and my feathers become new again and i can live the rest of my life however long it is in in a in a victory that only belongs to the believer we talked about all that negative talk and i want you to know that's what keeps us in the money grubs if we could begin to speak what god's word has promised for us in this hour instead of how we feel about it if we could understand that god is sovereign i want to say that he is sovereign we worry about things that we don't have to worry about how about a close i don't said that didn't i play they that wait upon the lord would you please shall renew their strength i hear believers saying things like this [Music] we lost old brother so-and-so last week [Music] if he could have just had a better hospital if he could have just got to a better doctor if they could have just got him the right medicine he'd be with us still and i just want to encourage you church don't believe that it'll run you crazy it'll run you crazy it'll take you right out of faith and it'll put you in fear that's not the message that's been delivered to us benjamin my oldest son said dad what are you preaching tonight i said well i'm not sure you ask at lunch he said i thought you might preach a sermon you just preached not by luck or chance or happenstance i said no i won't don't think i'll preach that tonight but i just took those scriptures and quotes where where brother branham said it doesn't happen by by just some luck or some draw if you're a believer all of your days are held in the hand of the lord come on now if god is calling you out of this life the best hospital the best doctor somebody said if i could have just gotten some of that good medicine from mexico my loved ones would still be here folks i believe in the sovereignty of god our days are numbered god knows the day you're born the day you're leaving here we can fight hard to stay here but how many of you know you don't even have to be sick to die he comes and he calls and we better know we're ready we better know we're ready we better talk to our young people [Music] because the standard is slipping fast in this hour we've got to encourage them to hold on to god and not compromise with the world because your salvation is the most valuable thing that god has placed within your life don't allow the enemy to confuse you with all those thoughts if only this could have happened or that could have happened they might still be with us if they left us regardless of their age they left here because god called them you know brother branham said if jesus were to come in here tonight and walk down that aisle he couldn't do anything for you that he hasn't already done the price is paid hallelujah and we're looking to jesus tonight would you stand you've been so so patient with my annoying voice and you've pulled the best you could and i appreciate it so much but i'm so burdened i feel so heavy for somebody who feels so weighty so heavy and i want to just believe god as we prepare to leave here shortly that he will lift you up that he will breathe fresh life that he will give you enough strength to beat your head on the rock of ages until all the stuff of this world is beat off and you can have perfect peace with him all the negative if we could cast that aside and stand on the promises of god tonight step back into our destiny to the center of god's perfect will his timing is always impeccable he's never too late he's never too early the songwriter said he may not come when you want him but he's right on time how many of you found that to be true with the lord jesus christ i want you to bow your hearts and your heads for just a moment and i want to pray for you i want to ask god to give you strength to feast on this living word that we have at our fingertips every single day until your strength begins to flow back into your life and you find the grace to pull yourself up out of the mud hole out of the rut that satan has tried to put you in [Music] i want to pray that you get back to the rock sooner rather than later now i'm not just speaking to those here tonight i'm speaking to a host of precious friends and believers who are streaming the service god has victory for you and your life he has encouragement where discouragement has reigned and ruled he has victory where you've been walking in defeat i believe god wants to make your footsteps lighter and he wants to encourage you that it's not all over and it's not all behind you that god has gracious grace and blessings waiting for us as we press into his presence i'm asking the lord to let somebody press into that place of grace soon if not tonight so that they could once again lift up their voice in exuberant thanksgiving and praise to the god who has been so gracious to us we've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for he's been so good your head just kind of bowed still i want you to sing this with me before we really pray they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mouth out with wings as he god you want to raise your hands you can look up they shall walk teach me lord that's sounding stronger lord these are your children i'm asking you to help lift them up they that wait upon the lord why don't you just lift a hand in cast your eyes a little higher [Music] look toward the rock where your help comes from they shall run oh they shall
