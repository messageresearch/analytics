[2:46] everything. So, that's kind of nice. But
[2:50] uh isn't he good to us? You know, he
[2:54] provides for all our needs. It's the
[2:57] advantages of turning 65 now. They they
[3:00] want to check everything. And uh that's
[3:04] good. It's a good thing. God takes care
[3:07] of us. Amen. He abides. He abides. I'm

[3:17] I don't feel like rejoicing and I don't
[3:19] feel good, I'm still going to give him
[3:21] praise. Amen.
[3:24] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[3:28] the pilgrim way for the hand of God. In
[3:32] all my life I sing.
[3:36] And the reason of my bliss. Yes. A
[3:39] secret all is is that the comforter
[3:43] abide with [music] me.
[3:48] He abides.
[3:50] Yes, he abides.
[3:54] Hallelujah. [music] He abides with me.
[4:00] I always [music] see night and day as I
[4:03] [singing] walk the narrow way. For the
[4:06] comforter abides with me.
[4:10] [singing and music]
[4:12] Once my heart was full of sin. Once I
[4:16] had no peace within. Till I heard how
[4:19] Jesus [music and singing] died upon the
[4:21] tree.
[4:24] Then I fell down at [music] his feet.
[4:27] And there [singing] came a peace so
[4:29] sweet. Now the comforter abides
[4:33] [singing] with [music] me.
[4:36] He abides.
[4:39] Yes, he [music and singing] abides.
[4:42] Hallelujah. He abides
[4:44] [music and singing] with me.
[4:48] I'm rejoicing [music] night and day as I
[4:52] walk the narrow [singing] way for the
[4:55] comforter above with me.
[5:00] He is with me everywhere and he knows my
[5:05] every care. [music]
[5:06] I'm as happy as a bird and just as free
[5:12] for the spirit has control. Jesus
[5:16] [music] satisfies [singing]
[5:17] my soul since a comforter abides with
[5:22] [music and singing] me.
[5:24] He abides.
[5:27] Yes, he abides.
[5:31] Hallelujah. He [music] abides with me.
[5:37] I'm rejoicing [music and singing] night
[5:38] and day as I walk the narrow way. For
[5:43] the comforter abides with me.
[5:49] There's no thirsting for [music] the
[5:51] things [singing] of the world. They've
[5:54] taken wings. Long ago I [music] gave
[5:57] them up and instantly
[6:01] all my night was turned to day. All
[6:04] [music and singing] my burdens rolled
[6:06] away. Now the comforter abides with me.
[6:11] [music]
[6:13] He abides.
[6:16] Yes, he [music] abides.
[6:20] Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[6:23] [music and singing]
[6:26] I am no hoisting night and day as I walk
[6:30] the [singing] narrow way. For the
[6:33] comforter abides with
[6:35] [music and singing] me.
[6:37] Yes, he abides.
[6:44] Hallelujah. He abides [singing]
[6:47] with me.
[6:50] I'm rejoicing [music] night and day as I
[6:54] walk the narrow way for the comforter
[6:58] abides with [music and singing] me.
[7:02] Sister hope as we sing that chorus one
[7:04] more time if you'll make ready for song.
[7:06] He abides.
[7:09] Yes, he abides.
[7:13] Hallelujah. He abides with
[7:16] [music and singing] me.
[7:18] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[7:22] [music and singing] the narrow way for
[7:25] the comforter abides with me.
[7:29] [music and singing]
[7:30] May take your seats.
[7:41] You can sing this with me.
[7:48] There are people almost everywhere whose
[7:52] [music] hearts are all a flame. With the
[7:55] fire that fell at
[7:58] which cleansed and made them [singing]
[8:00] clean, it is burning now within [music]
[8:03] my heart. All glory toad
[8:10] of
[8:13] one of them.

[8:38] [music]

[11:09] One of those one of I think it's been
[11:11] said the Lord's despised few. I'm
[11:14] thankful to be able to stand with the
[11:16] Lord Jesus in these last days. Uh
[11:19] brother, do we have any prayer requests?
[11:22] Okay. Um first, let me I want to greet
[11:25] my friend Billy Silva back there. God
[11:27] bless you. It's a It's a pleasure to
[11:30] have you in service and I know have
[11:32] known the family for a long time. Known
[11:34] brother Billy for a while. God bless
[11:36] you. Welcome. It's good to see you here
[11:38] in Tucson.
[11:39] Um and then also, oh, we have so few
[11:44] this evening. And um Billy, so what we
[11:48] do on Wednesday night is we've devoted a
[11:51] couple years ago I felt to have devote
[11:54] every Wednesday to a Bible study. And so
[11:57] that's what Wednesday is. It's usually a
[12:00] little bit more informal. Tonight,
[12:03] Brother Lyle at my request is going to
[12:06] start on a series on the tabernacle in
[12:09] the wilderness. I mention it a lot. You
[12:12] hear ministers mention it a lot. What is
[12:15] this? What is this tent that was erected
[12:19] at the instructions of God through the
[12:21] prophet Moses? really looking forward to
[12:24] brother Lyall expounding on this. I I
[12:27] thought he is a really really good one
[12:29] to do it. He's wellversed and
[12:31] wellstudied. So, we'll start on that
[12:33] tonight and uh we'll see how long it
[12:36] goes as far as into the future.
[12:39] For
[12:41] um plans coming up, I've invited another
[12:44] friend of mine from Quebec.
[12:47] This is another pastor and I've
[12:49] mentioned him before to the
[12:51] congregation. He has a new church near
[12:54] Montreal
[12:55] and he is uh starting just from the very
[12:59] foundation. I spoke there a couple
[13:01] months ago and uh things are going good.
[13:03] The Lord's really blessing his church. I
[13:06] um I wanted him to come out and and
[13:09] minister for us. He's uh brother Joel is
[13:14] uh he's very close with brother Steve
[13:15] Brassone who we had last week or two
[13:17] weeks ago. And uh brother Joel is is is
[13:21] a very um very learned very uh
[13:26] well-versed in the scriptures and and I
[13:29] know that he's going to be a real
[13:31] blessing to our congregation. He'll be
[13:33] coming on December the 14th. So we're
[13:36] going to have two services on that
[13:38] Sunday. The 14th will be morning and
[13:40] evening. And then on the following
[13:43] Wednesday, I bought a fire pit. And
[13:47] since we're just uh I don't know 30 or
[13:49] 40 people on Wednesday night, I thought
[13:52] it would be fun to start every once a
[13:55] month or something like that to have a
[13:57] fireside Bible study and we can sing
[14:00] songs around the fire and then maybe
[14:02] have a short 15 uh minute message or so,
[14:06] 15 minute study and then uh maybe a
[14:09] dialogue, maybe some questions and we
[14:11] can talk about whatever scriptures that
[14:13] uh that we brought to light there. and
[14:16] brother Joel will have the first
[14:18] fireside Bible study. So that'll be um
[14:21] that Wednesday after the Sunday that
[14:24] he's here. Talked with brother Steven
[14:27] Young. I told the talked to the
[14:30] congregation about our new missionary
[14:33] program that we have in Durban, South
[14:34] Africa. I talked to Stephen this morning
[14:38] and he is really really excited. We sent
[14:40] our first offering to him and uh we are
[14:44] investing in the potential of brother
[14:48] Stephen and what he's doing there in
[14:50] Durban. When you buy stock in a company,
[14:53] you are investing investing in that
[14:55] company being able to grow. You're not
[14:58] investing in the in the company the way
[15:00] it is now, but you are investing your
[15:03] money with the potential for that
[15:06] company to get to prosper. and that is
[15:09] brother Stephen Young. We're investing
[15:11] in him and his ministry and he's got a
[15:14] wonderful ministry. The brother is just
[15:17] tremendous in his understanding,
[15:19] tremendous in his ability. He has made
[15:21] contact with a local Pentecostal church
[15:24] with a pastor who is I think 80 years
[15:27] old. And uh that pastor uh laid his
[15:31] support to brother Stephen for a tent
[15:34] meeting that is going to happen in a
[15:36] couple weeks. So, we're looking forward
[15:38] to a really good report from from
[15:41] Brother Stephen. And he says he says he
[15:43] understands. He says that that's really
[15:44] not the way of the United States. He
[15:47] says, but he thinks it will be
[15:48] successful there in Durban. He says he
[15:51] believes people will come to the Lord
[15:52] there.
[15:54] um
[15:56] for um our prayer requests.
[16:00] I don't have any written requests, but I
[16:02] would like to congregation to remember a
[16:05] situation that's going on in the world
[16:07] right now. All of our eyes are on
[16:09] Venezuela and the crisis that's
[16:12] beginning to happen there, but I think
[16:15] the world is ignoring a crisis that has
[16:18] been in the works for about a year now.
[16:21] And that's in central Africa in the
[16:23] country of Nigeria.
[16:25] There is an active
[16:28] um persecution on the Christians in that
[16:32] country and killing thousands of them. I
[16:37] don't know if uh any of you are familiar
[16:39] with the genocide that happened in
[16:40] Rwanda decades ago, but this it looks
[16:45] like this could be something that could
[16:47] devolve into that type of a situation.
[16:50] So please let's let's pray for our
[16:53] brothers and sisters that are in
[16:54] Nigeria. It's a very desperate
[16:57] situation. They are kidnapping. They
[17:00] just a couple days ago they kidnapped
[17:01] 300 uh students from a school and
[17:05] they're holding them for ransom. They
[17:07] don't feed them. They treat them very
[17:11] badly. And they actually when when they
[17:15] take these people captive, they will
[17:18] call up their parents or whoever the
[17:19] contact is if they can get their phone
[17:21] numbers and they will beat those
[17:25] children. And so their parents are
[17:27] hearing them scream and hearing their
[17:30] suffering to um to try to get money out
[17:34] of out of the parents. It's a bad
[17:37] situation in Nigeria. I know all the
[17:39] world is looking at the Caribbean right
[17:41] now, but really that um keep them in
[17:46] prayer. It's it's the Muslims that are
[17:50] against the Christians in that country.
[17:52] So something that I want the church to
[17:54] continue to pray for and and continue to
[17:56] pray for our brother Steven Young there
[17:59] in Durban and the work that he's doing.
[18:02] And uh any other let's all let's all
[18:05] stand. I don't have any written
[18:07] requests.
[18:09] Oh yeah. Yeah. Thank you, brother. And
[18:12] um a dear friend of ours of Stephanie
[18:16] and mine. Um they uh I've asked the
[18:20] church to pray for this young man
[18:22] before. He had colon cancer and the Lord
[18:26] saw fit to take him a few days ago. And
[18:29] that's David Bowman, Amber Bowman's son.
[18:33] Many of you know Amber and uh and the
[18:35] family. But I can only imagine the pain
[18:40] this boy I don't know Stephanie what is
[18:42] he about 19 something like that 19 or 20
[18:45] years old and [clears throat] the kid
[18:47] has just suffered and suffered and
[18:49] suffered his suffering is over but the
[18:53] family is really suffering right now so
[18:56] remember to pray for the Bowman family
[18:59] let's bow our heads and with our heads
[19:01] bowed
[19:02] if you have a request that you would
[19:05] like to make known to for our Lord and
[19:07] Savior. As he looks down over the
[19:10] banisters of heaven, if you would raise
[19:12] your hand, say, "Lord, I have a request
[19:15] for myself, for someone else. Would you
[19:18] see my hand
[19:20] and grant, Lord, this which is on my
[19:22] heart?
[19:24] Father,
[19:27] Lord, these requests first for David's
[19:30] family,
[19:32] Lord, we don't know why these things
[19:34] happen in a young man. We don't
[19:36] understand why he would suffer like he
[19:39] did. But I know that he was a Christian.
[19:44] He had accepted the Lord as as a savior.
[19:48] And Lord, he had such a nice spirit.
[19:51] Lord, you saw fit to take him out of
[19:55] this place of many trials and
[19:58] temptations that we live in. But Lord,
[20:01] he has a family. We pray father that
[20:04] your hand would be upon them and comfort
[20:06] mom and the dad the sister
[20:11] Lord the
[20:13] situation
[20:15] in Africa with in Nigerian
[20:19] Lord persecution that's going on.
[20:22] We know that our Lord and Savior
[20:26] prophesied that we would suffer
[20:28] persecution for that name and truly they
[20:31] are today. Father, we pray that they
[20:33] would stand stand strong in the face of
[20:37] this evil that's confronting them. Lord,
[20:40] may they stand there and confess the
[20:43] name of Jesus Christ. And then, Lord, we
[20:45] pray that you would send angels through
[20:47] that country to protect them. Watch
[20:50] over, Father, your children in Africa.
[20:53] We pray, Brother Steven Young,
[20:58] Lord, in the work that he is embarking
[21:00] on.
[21:01] Lord, we pray that you would bless it.
[21:04] Pray that souls would be saved because
[21:07] of his efforts and because of our
[21:09] efforts here
[21:11] at this church in supporting the work
[21:13] that they are doing. Father,
[21:16] we can help in our monetary way, but but
[21:19] Lord, we pray that you would bless it,
[21:22] that your Lord, Holy Spirit would be
[21:25] with them and and Father, heal the sick
[21:30] at this brother's prayer. We pray and
[21:32] and and lead many, Father, call many to
[21:36] the altar and call them to salvation, we
[21:39] ask. Bless Brother Steven Young. Bless
[21:42] his family, Lord. His his wife and his
[21:45] little girls, we pray. And bless the
[21:48] little church that's forming
[21:50] now. Lord, the hands that were raised,
[21:54] bring them before you also.
[21:57] You know the need. Lord, we pray that
[22:00] you would meet every need in Jesus name.
[22:04] Amen.
[22:09] Brother Bill, you got a song for us?
[22:11] Come on up, my friend. You can be
[22:13] seated.
[22:57] I got up
[23:00] this morning
[23:03] feeling kind of blue.
[23:08] Thinking about the things [singing]
[23:13] that I had to do.
[23:18] Then I turned to read God's word.
[23:24] Something changed my mood when I learned
[23:30] just what I have
[23:33] to look forward
[23:36] to.
[23:40] There will be a table a thousand miles
[23:44] long. I'll feast with loved ones
[23:48] who've gone on. God will take me by the
[23:53] hand and lead me through my new home.
[24:00] I'll leave behind
[24:02] these former things
[24:05] when I've conquered death [music] sting.
[24:10] Why should I
[24:12] feel blue?
[24:15] I've got so much to look forward to.
[24:23] Now this world
[24:25] has a way
[24:28] of getting
[24:30] me down.
[24:33] Bad news fills my mind,
[24:37] turns a smile into a frown.
[24:43] But as a child of God, there's a peace
[24:49] that I found.
[24:52] I know just what I am
[24:57] and where
[24:59] I am bound.
[25:01] [music]
[25:02] Oh, there'll be a table [singing]
[25:06] a thousand [music] miles long. I'll
[25:09] feast with loved ones
[25:12] who've gone on. And God will take me by
[25:16] the [singing] hand and lead me through
[25:21] my new home. I'll leave [music] behind
[25:26] these former things
[25:28] when I've conquered death stink.
[25:33] Why should I
[25:36] feel blue?
[25:38] I've got so much to look forward to.
[25:45] There'll be a table a thousand [music]
[25:49] miles long. I'll feast with loved ones
[25:54] who've gone on. And God will
[25:56] [music and singing] take me by the hand
[26:00] and lead me through my [music] new home.
[26:05] I'll leave behind [singing]
[26:08] these former things
[26:11] when I've conquered
[26:13] death sting.
[26:15] Why should I
[26:18] feel blue?
[26:20] I've got so much to look forward to.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Let's stand as our brother Lyall
[26:43] prepares to to come on up.
[26:48] [clears throat]
[26:48] Let's do that song. Think about his
[26:50] love. Think about his goodness.
[26:53] Sometimes we get caught up with
[26:55] everything that's going on around us and
[26:59] and and but if you start thinking about
[27:01] how much he cares for you and how much
[27:02] he loves you, what his plans are for you
[27:06] and if you think you long for it, how
[27:08] much more he desires.
[27:10] He desired it so much that he gave his
[27:12] life for you so that you could be
[27:15] theirs.
[27:20] Think about [music] his love.
[27:25] Think about his goodness.
[27:31] Think about [music] his grace
[27:36] that's brought us [singing] through.
[27:42] For [singing]
[27:43] as high as the [music] heavens above,
[27:49] so [singing] great is the measure of our
[27:54] father's love.
[28:00] Great is the measure of our father's
[28:05] [music and singing] love.
[28:11] Oh, think about his love.
[28:17] Think about his goodness.
[28:22] Think about his grace
[28:27] that's brought us through.
[28:34] For as high [singing and music] as the
[28:36] heavens above,
[28:40] so [music] great is the measure
[28:42] [singing]
[28:43] of our heart.
[28:51] Great is the measure of our father's
[28:56] love.
[29:00] Think about his love. Think about it.
[29:05] Think about his goodness.
[29:11] Think about his grace. And what is it
[29:14] done
[29:15] that's brought us through?
[29:19] [singing]
[29:20] [music]
[29:22] For as high as the heavens above,
[29:27] so great is the measure [singing]
[29:31] of our Father's
[29:33] love. [singing]
[29:38] [music] Great is the measure [singing]
[29:41] of our Father's love.
[29:47] Thank you. I I think it's unmeasurable.
[29:51] I can't measure it.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Good evening.
[29:59] I suppose I need to turn this. There we
[30:01] go.
[30:03] Tonight we'll begin
[30:05] looking at the tabernacle in the
[30:07] wilderness. And the title image, you
[30:10] see, the tabernacle itself is the large
[30:13] tent. It was constructed and used by the
[30:16] nation of the descendants of Jacob as
[30:18] they followed their prophet leader Moses
[30:22] from Egypt through the Sinai and parts
[30:25] of Arabia on their way on their journey
[30:28] to Canaan. We'll take a brief look at
[30:31] the culture of the time of the meaning
[30:33] of temples and of the tabernacle. More
[30:35] importantly, we'll look at some lessons
[30:38] we can apply to our lives today.
[30:42] We won't finish the study tonight, but
[30:44] we will start. Before we begin this
[30:47] journey, please join me once more in
[30:49] prayer.
[30:53] Lord Jesus, we are in awe of you. So
[30:56] great is the measure of your love. We
[30:59] see that love, Lord, expressed through
[31:01] this tabernacle, through this through
[31:03] this whole time of the children of
[31:06] Israel and the building and the
[31:08] construction and the symbolism of it.
[31:11] Lord, we pray tonight. Lord, I pray
[31:13] especially that you'd anoint my lips,
[31:16] Lord, that I don't say anything that
[31:19] would cause anyone to stumble or to
[31:21] misstep or to be confused, Lord. That
[31:24] you'd anoint those that hear, Lord, that
[31:27] that anything that I may say wrong or
[31:30] anything that I may do incorrectly that
[31:33] that they would filter it through your
[31:35] spirit and hear the intent behind it.
[31:38] Lord, we commit this evening, the
[31:39] remainder of it, to you. We thank you
[31:41] for the forgiveness of our sins and for
[31:43] the presence of your spirit in Jesus
[31:46] precious name. Amen.
[31:52] Before we're seated,
[31:54] we'll read from the first time the
[31:55] tabernacle is mentioned found in Exodus
[31:58] chapter 25.
[32:00] The context is that Moses has led the
[32:03] Israelites from Egypt. They've crossed
[32:05] the Red Sea. They've arrived at the
[32:08] sacred mountain, sometimes called Si,
[32:11] sometimes called Horeb. Moses has
[32:13] received the Ten Commandments and shared
[32:15] them with the nation along with some
[32:17] other laws and instructions. He's gone
[32:19] up again on the mountain. He'll be there
[32:22] for some 40 days. Let's join Moses upon
[32:26] that mountain.
[32:29] Exodus 25 verse1. And the Lord, who?
[32:35] Yahweh spake unto who?
[32:39] Moses, saying, So this is what we'd
[32:42] later call, thus saith the Lord. Speak
[32:45] unto the children of Israel, that they
[32:47] may bring me
[32:49] who? Not Moses, the Lord Yahweh. They
[32:53] may bring me an offering of every man
[32:56] that giveth it willingly with his heart.
[32:59] He shall take my offering.
[33:01] It must be from a willing heart. It's
[33:04] not only the specific material, but the
[33:07] spirit behind the giving of it. It's an
[33:10] offering, not an obligation.
[33:13] And this is the offering. These are the
[33:15] items which you shall take of them. Gold
[33:19] and silver
[33:21] and brass. Actually, the word there is
[33:24] copper. These are metals. They might be
[33:26] jewelry or utensils,
[33:29] not coins. Coins didn't exist in Egypt
[33:31] until about 800 years later. These
[33:35] objects will be melted down for the
[33:37] metals
[33:39] and blue and purple and scarlet and fine
[33:44] linen and goats hair. These are fabrics
[33:47] and threads and yarn and ram's skins
[33:52] dyed red
[33:54] leather and badgers skins. Badger skins
[33:58] is also variously translated as seal
[34:00] skin, porpus skin or just fine leather
[34:05] and shamwood which is wood from a
[34:08] species of acacia trees.
[34:12] Oil for the light. This would be olive
[34:14] oil. Spices for anointing oil and for
[34:17] sweet incense. The specific spices would
[34:20] later be specified along with the
[34:22] recipes for blending them for various
[34:25] ritual purposes.
[34:27] Onyx, stones, and stones, again, the
[34:30] specific ones later specified, to be set
[34:33] in the EOD and the breastplate. We'll
[34:36] talk about those, not tonight. The EOD
[34:39] is like a kind of apron. And the
[34:40] breastplate is to be worn only by the
[34:42] future high priest.
[34:45] And let them make me a sanctuary,
[34:49] a special consecrated place. It's
[34:51] hallowed or considered holy. Why? What's
[34:56] the purpose of the sanctuary? That I,
[35:00] not Moses, the Lord Yahweh, that I may
[35:04] dwell among them.
[35:06] Not in the people, but among them. In
[35:09] other words, literally a a place for God
[35:12] to live
[35:14] according to all that I show thee after
[35:16] the pattern of the tabernacle.
[35:18] This is only the second time and I think
[35:21] the last time where there are specific
[35:24] plans given for construction. The first
[35:25] time was in Genesis when God told Noah
[35:28] exactly the dimensions of the ark and
[35:31] the materials to use. And here he's
[35:33] going to go into even greater detail for
[35:35] this tabernacle. The tabernacle is
[35:37] literally a tent, a portable structure
[35:39] that can be assembled, disassembled,
[35:41] transported, reassembled. This is the
[35:44] sanctuary where God will dwell among and
[35:46] meet with the people he has taken from
[35:48] slavery in Egypt and the pattern of all
[35:52] the instruments thereof. Even so shall
[35:54] you make it. Moses will be given
[35:56] explicit detailed instructions for every
[36:00] aspect of this structure.
[36:02] Please be seated.
[36:05] The tabernacle in the wilderness will be
[36:08] the first place where we are told God
[36:11] will dwell.
[36:13] Later he will dwell in the temple in
[36:15] Jerusalem. Although at the dedication of
[36:17] that building, Solomon will acknowledge
[36:19] that God is not restricted to the temple
[36:22] he has just built. Rather, these are
[36:25] places where God's presence may be
[36:27] visible or felt. We might say a
[36:30] manifestation of God's presence.
[36:34] What about today?
[36:37] In Paul's letter to the Ephesians, a
[36:39] church largely composed of gentile
[36:41] believers, he writes in Ephesians 2,
[36:44] "Now therefore, ye gentile believers are
[36:47] no more strangers and foreigners, but
[36:50] fellow citizens with the saints and of
[36:53] the household of God, your family, and
[36:57] are built upon the foundation of the
[36:59] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[37:02] himself being the chief cornerstones."
[37:05] Paul's now using a metaphor of a of a
[37:08] temple or a building
[37:10] in whom in Jesus Christ all the building
[37:14] fitly framed together grows. It's
[37:16] currently under construction
[37:19] unto an holy temple in the Lord. A
[37:21] temple, a place where God lives. In
[37:25] whom, that is in Jesus Christ ye also
[37:29] are builded together.
[37:35] for inhabitation of who?
[37:39] God. How? Through the spirit.
[37:45] In other words, God does not live in a
[37:48] tabernacle or even in a temple. When
[37:50] Paul wrote this, the temple was still in
[37:53] Jerusalem. They were actively performing
[37:56] sacrifices in the various rituals of
[37:58] Judaism. But Paul says, "God's moved on.
[38:02] Now dwells in his people. dwells. His
[38:05] presence may be seen and felt a channel
[38:08] for his righteousness in us. You
[38:13] and I, I I hope
[38:18] in ancient times, gods were believed to
[38:22] live in temples. A temple was literally
[38:24] a house where a god lived. Idols were
[38:28] placed in a temple and worshiped.
[38:30] Offerings were made and so forth. This
[38:33] was the culture certainly in Egypt and
[38:36] the Mediterranean world.
[38:39] Jacob's descendants had lived in Egypt
[38:42] for centuries. They had no religious
[38:44] practice, no priests, no liturgy, no
[38:49] writings, no specific knowledge, no
[38:52] definition of sin, no teachings of
[38:56] repentance or sacrifice or even of
[38:58] worship.
[39:00] God had not told them anything except
[39:02] that through Abraham the males were to
[39:04] be circumcised. And and maybe if you
[39:07] were taught that someday they would be
[39:09] delivered from Egyptian bondage.
[39:12] If they remembered or been taught
[39:14] anything else, it would have been the
[39:15] few rules that God told Noah. Don't eat
[39:18] blood. Don't kill your fellow man. Do be
[39:21] fruitful and multiply.
[39:23] They may have been told that Abraham and
[39:25] Isaac and Jacob offered sacrifices and
[39:27] saw other worldly beings. There's no
[39:31] record of Joseph, for example, having
[39:33] ever done that.
[39:35] This was all hundreds of years before
[39:38] the Exodus.
[39:40] How many of us
[39:42] know anything that our ancestors said
[39:46] three or 4 hundred years ago?
[39:50] I don't. I I I I couldn't even tell you
[39:52] the names of anybody from that far back
[39:54] in my lineage.
[39:56] As slaves in Egypt, many, if not most,
[40:00] would have adopted the religion of their
[40:02] masters, just as happened in America,
[40:05] worshiping Egyptian gods and goddesses,
[40:08] no doubt helping to construct temples
[40:10] and so forth.
[40:12] While Moses was receiving the plans for
[40:14] the tabernacle on top of the mountain,
[40:17] at the foot of the mountain, the people
[40:19] had given up on Moses. They implored
[40:22] Aaron to make them an idol, which we
[40:26] know was the golden calf.
[40:29] After all, this had been their practice
[40:30] for hundreds of years in Egypt. Hatur,
[40:33] the goddess represented by a cow, was
[40:36] popular. She represented love and joy,
[40:38] maternal affection and protection.
[40:41] No wonder they made a golden calf. Oops.
[40:46] It's time to stop worshiping idols and
[40:48] learn about the one true God. Before we
[40:52] look at details of the tabernacle in its
[40:54] courtyard, let's see an overview.
[40:58] This is a photo of a modern version of
[41:01] the tabernacle located in Timna Park,
[41:03] Israel. It's a it's about 30 miles north
[41:05] of Elot near the southern tip of Israel.
[41:09] It's a full scale representation here.
[41:11] Here's a view with a tour group inside
[41:14] to give you a better idea of the size
[41:18] there. Within the fabric walls, the area
[41:21] within the fabric walls is usually
[41:22] called the outer court. Within it are a
[41:26] sacrificial altar, a large bowl of water
[41:29] called a lavver and a large tent which
[41:32] is the tabernacle itself. Inside the
[41:36] tent is divided into two spaces called
[41:38] the holy place and the most holy place.
[41:41] Sometimes they're called the inner
[41:43] court, the holy of holies. We'll get
[41:45] into all of this in some detail as we
[41:47] progress.
[41:49] To begin our journey, let's first
[41:52] consider what was outside the
[41:54] tabernacle, outside the wall of its
[41:57] court.
[42:00] The people were encamped in tents or
[42:02] whatever they could carry with them as
[42:04] they fled from Egypt into the desert.
[42:07] They left in April or late March, so the
[42:09] weather was relatively mild. It's not
[42:12] like they could go in their garage and
[42:13] get all their camping gear and loaded in
[42:15] their pickup truck. They're on foot. A
[42:17] few of them have animals. Fewer of them
[42:19] have carts. These are slaves. They lived
[42:22] in mudbrick houses
[42:25] in uh in in Goan and so forth. So that
[42:28] time of year there's cool nights and
[42:30] warm days, not the blistering heat of
[42:32] summer or the cold nights of winter.
[42:35] Once they arrived at Sinai or Horeb,
[42:37] they they were near settlements in
[42:39] Midian. We know that they were near
[42:41] because Moses had gone from a settlement
[42:44] in Midian pasturing the sheep and that's
[42:46] where he saw the burning bush and that's
[42:48] where they are. So perhaps they could
[42:50] have managed to procure the things they
[42:52] needed to make tents or some sort of
[42:54] portable structures. We know that they
[42:56] had plenty of gold and silver with them.
[43:01] Mana was their food supply. Freely given
[43:05] the world's first operational largescale
[43:07] daily food bank.
[43:15] Once the tabernacle was erected,
[43:19] a person looking toward it whose view is
[43:21] not obscured by the tents of the
[43:23] migrants would have seen a view
[43:24] something like this.
[43:27] It might be seen by one of the
[43:28] Israelites or perhaps a Midionite
[43:30] shepherd with his flocks as Moses was
[43:32] when he first came to this place and saw
[43:34] the burning bush. This image is of the
[43:37] southeast of the courtyard looking
[43:39] northwest. So, you're seeing the south
[43:41] and east sides of that courtyard.
[43:45] What's the first thing you notice?
[43:50] A wall perhaps marking the boundary of
[43:53] the outer court. It's made of vertical
[43:56] pillars with horizontal poles holding
[43:59] white linen curtains, all of which are
[44:02] anchored to the desert floor with ropes
[44:04] or cords tied to brass spikes. The
[44:07] pillars making the supports for the wall
[44:09] are topped in silver.
[44:12] Looking more closely, you may notice the
[44:15] base of the supports of these pillars
[44:17] are are set in brass sockets that are on
[44:20] and protecting the pillars from the
[44:22] desert floor.
[44:25] Rising above the wall inside the court,
[44:27] you you see part of a taller tent-like
[44:29] structure with a flat top. That that's
[44:32] the tabernacle itself.
[44:34] It's covered in a series of blankets at
[44:36] the outermost, the layer you can see, is
[44:39] made of some sort of fine leather.
[44:41] You can see five golden columns at one
[44:44] end of the structure. Behind the columns
[44:47] is a multicolored curtain blocking your
[44:49] view of the inside.
[44:52] At the center of the eastern end of the
[44:54] outside wall of white linen is another
[44:57] multicolored curtain. It's currently
[44:59] closed, but but marks and forms the
[45:01] entrance to the tabernacle's courtyard.
[45:06] Both of these multicolored curtains are
[45:08] woven and include threads of blue and
[45:10] purple. and scarlet.
[45:13] But you're standing in the desert. It's
[45:16] a bleak, a forbidding place, a dangerous
[45:19] place. And you wonder at this structure,
[45:24] why is it built this way?
[45:27] What does it mean?
[45:30] Let's consider the symbolic nature of
[45:33] this structure. Starting with the
[45:35] courtyard,
[45:36] God giving instructions to Moses during
[45:38] his 40-day stint on Mount Si. Exodus 27
[45:43] verse 9, we read, "Thou shalt make the
[45:45] court of the tabernacle for the
[45:47] southside southward. There shall be
[45:49] hangings for the court of fine twined
[45:51] linen of 100 cubits long for one side,
[45:54] that's 150 ft. And the 20 pillars
[45:58] thereof, and their 20 sockets shall be
[46:00] of brass." That that means that the the
[46:04] sockets the reference of brass is to the
[46:06] sockets not to the pillar itself not the
[46:08] material of the posts. The hooks of the
[46:11] pillars and their fillets the rods on
[46:12] which the curtains hang shall be of
[46:15] silver.
[46:17] Oops, wrong button. And likewise
[46:21] for the north side and for the breadth
[46:23] of the court on the west side shall be
[46:25] hangings of 50 cubits, their pillars 10,
[46:28] their sockets 10. The breadth of the
[46:30] court on the east side eastward Shelby
[46:32] 50 cubits. So this courtyard is 50
[46:35] cubits 75 feet by 150 feet. It's maybe
[46:39] the size of two modern lots of starter
[46:44] homes. Couple of small lots certainly
[46:46] bigger than this area but not
[46:48] dramatically bigger than the area of the
[46:50] sanctuary here.
[46:54] The hangings on one side of the gate
[46:57] shall be 15 cubits. Their pillars three
[47:00] and sockets three. The other side shall
[47:02] be hangings of 15 cubits. Their pillars
[47:04] three, their sockets three, which 15 and
[47:08] 15 is 30. The width is 50. So that
[47:10] leaves the gate of the court
[47:18] shall be an hanging of 20 cubits of
[47:22] blue. and purple and scarlet and fine
[47:25] twined linen wrapped with needle work.
[47:27] It's going to be embroidered. And their
[47:30] pillars shall be four and their sockets
[47:32] four. The pillars round about the court
[47:34] shall be filleted with silver silver
[47:37] bars. Their hooks shall be of silver,
[47:39] but their sockets on the ground of
[47:42] brass.
[47:44] The length of the court, he repeats it,
[47:45] will be 100 cubits, the breadth 50
[47:48] everywhere. And the height five cubits.
[47:51] That's just under 8 ft of fine twined
[47:53] linen and their sockets of brass.
[47:56] All the vessels of the tabernacle and
[47:58] all the service thereof and all the pins
[48:01] thereof and all the pins of the cord, in
[48:03] other words, the stakes that are holding
[48:04] cords and so forth,
[48:07] shall be of brass.
[48:12] Here's a crude drawing of the tabernacle
[48:14] wall of linen.
[48:17] Outside the linen wall is the desert.
[48:22] The world in which we live. For most of
[48:25] us, it's a challenging environment. It's
[48:28] where we are born, live and die. It's
[48:32] where we work and play, eat, and sleep,
[48:36] toil, and relax, where we raise our
[48:39] children, where we learn how to survive.
[48:42] In some cases, we prosper. In others, we
[48:45] struggle. For some it represents a life
[48:48] of opportunity. For others a life of
[48:52] exploitation, hope and regret, health
[48:56] and sickness, freedom and oppression,
[49:00] sometimes war, sometimes peace. But
[49:03] wait,
[49:04] in the middle of all this uncertainty
[49:07] and danger, we see a white linen wall
[49:11] creating a small enclosure
[49:14] 75 ft wide and 150 ft long. What is
[49:19] this?
[49:21] Why is it white?
[49:24] What does it mean?
[49:27] A man named John tells us in Revelation
[49:30] chapter 19,
[49:33] "And I heard as it were the voice of a
[49:36] great multitude, and as the voice of
[49:39] many waters, and as the voice of mighty
[49:42] thunderings, saying, Allelujah, for the
[49:46] Lord God omnipotent reignth. Let us be
[49:49] glad and rejoice and give honor to him.
[49:53] For the marriage of the Lamb has come,
[49:55] and his wife hath made herself ready.
[49:59] And to her was granted that she should
[50:02] be arrayed in what?
[50:06] Fine linen, clean and white. For the
[50:10] fine linen is the righteousness of
[50:13] saints. Other translations say the
[50:16] righteous acts of the saints.
[50:20] In the midst of this world, there is a
[50:23] place of righteousness.
[50:25] And when people see us in our world
[50:28] context,
[50:29] what should they see?
[50:32] Righteousness.
[50:34] It may not be what they see, what we
[50:37] display, how we act, how we react, but
[50:41] it should be.
[50:44] To approach the tabernacle itself, one
[50:47] had to first come face to face with
[50:50] God's righteousness represented by the
[50:53] white linen curtains.
[50:56] What about our own righteousness?
[50:59] I'm I'm a good person. I live a good
[51:01] life. I don't hurt other people.
[51:03] Isn't that enough?
[51:06] Not in God's eyes. Isaiah tells us in
[51:09] chapter 64, we are all as an how many.
[51:14] We are all as an unclean thing. And all
[51:19] our righteousness
[51:22] righteousness is are as filthy rags,
[51:26] polluted garments.
[51:28] We all do fade as a leaf, and our
[51:31] iniquities, like the wind, have taken us
[51:34] away. There's none that calleth upon thy
[51:36] name, that stirth up himself to take
[51:38] hold of thee. For thou hast hid thy face
[51:41] from us, and hast consumed us because of
[51:45] our iniquities.
[51:52] What supports these linen curtains?
[51:57] The posts supporting the curtains are
[51:59] made of acacia wood. They are set into a
[52:02] socket of brass or copper. Cords or
[52:05] ropes tie the tops of the post to brass
[52:07] stakes in the ground. This is a cutting
[52:10] board made of acacia wood. It's strong,
[52:15] durable, fairly light, has beautiful
[52:18] grain. There are many species of acacia.
[52:21] This is just one of them.
[52:24] Brass is a metal that sometimes speaks
[52:27] of or symbolizes judgment. For example,
[52:31] in Leviticus 26, the Lord tells the
[52:33] people the consequences of rejecting the
[52:35] commandments and statutes. And after
[52:38] lift listing several punishments, he
[52:41] continues,
[52:43] "And if you will not yet for all this,
[52:46] hearken unto me, then I will punish you
[52:49] seven times more for your sins. I will
[52:53] break the pride of your power. I will
[52:56] make your heaven as iron and your earth
[52:59] as brass."
[53:03] wood. The the material of the pillars is
[53:06] used to symbolize many things. Judgment
[53:08] and rescue. Noah's ark of gopherwood
[53:11] saved him during the judgment by flood.
[53:16] Sacrifice and atonement. Christ's cross
[53:20] was made of wood.
[53:22] We'll see many items in the tabernacle
[53:24] are made of acacia wood, usually
[53:26] overlaid with a metal, copper, brass,
[53:29] silver, or gold.
[53:32] The tops of the posts are covered in
[53:35] silver and silver rods are used to hang
[53:38] the curtains.
[53:41] Silver is a symbol especially of
[53:43] redemption, of purity, and of value.
[53:48] In terms of redemption,
[53:51] Exodus 30 we read, "And the Lord spake
[53:53] unto Moses, saying, when thou takest the
[53:56] sum of the children of Israel after
[53:58] their number, a census, then shalt give
[54:02] every man a ransom for his soul unto the
[54:05] Lord, when thou numberest them, that
[54:07] there be no plague among them, when thou
[54:10] numberest them.
[54:14] This shall they give everyone that
[54:16] passeth among them that are numbered
[54:19] half a shekele after the shekele of the
[54:21] sanctuary. A shekele is 20 garas and
[54:25] half shekele shall be the offering to
[54:27] the Lord.
[54:30] A shekele is a measure of weight.
[54:33] Elsewhere we find that this is referring
[54:35] to silver. The the unit of currency in
[54:37] Israel today is the shekele.
[54:42] This is a ransom for his soul.
[54:45] a ransom. It's to redeem. It's to buy
[54:48] back.
[54:50] And purities, silver must be refined,
[54:53] become pure before it can be used. In
[54:55] Malachi 3, we read, "Behold, I will send
[54:58] my messenger, and he shall prepare the
[55:00] way before me. And the Lord whom you
[55:02] seek shall suddenly come to his temple,
[55:05] even the messenger of the covenant whom
[55:07] you delight in. Behold, he shall come,
[55:10] saith the Lord of hosts.
[55:13] But who may abide the day of his coming?
[55:15] Who shall stand when he appears?
[55:18] For he is like a refiner's fire, like
[55:21] fuller's soap. He shall sit as a refiner
[55:25] and purifier of silver. He shall purify
[55:28] the sons of Levi and purge them as gold
[55:31] and silver that they may offer unto the
[55:33] Lord an offering and righteousness.
[55:37] Then shall the offering of Judah and
[55:39] Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord as
[55:41] in the days of old and as in former
[55:44] years
[55:46] speaks of value. The Hebrew word for
[55:49] silver is kiff. In Israel, money is
[55:53] generically referred to as Kesv and
[55:55] nowadays measured in shuffles.
[56:04] Looking at this tabernacle wall again,
[56:07] the not the tabernacle but the outer
[56:09] wall enclosing the court. The only
[56:12] entrance to the tabernacle within is
[56:15] through the courtyard and its only
[56:18] entrance was on its east end. The
[56:22] tabernacle and the entrance to the
[56:24] courtyard were always oriented to the
[56:25] east regardless of location during the
[56:29] wanderings in the desert. The model of
[56:31] the tabernacle in the back I've set
[56:32] there so that its entrance is oriented
[56:34] to the east. Don't want to get in
[56:37] trouble with that.
[56:39] Why east?
[56:42] Who cares what direction it's oriented?
[56:45] It's not like it's facing Jerusalem or
[56:47] something. What What's this about the
[56:49] east?
[56:52] Consider that the Israelites had spent
[56:54] centuries in Egypt. much of that time as
[56:58] bond servants or slaves. This is an
[57:00] image from space showing Egypt and areas
[57:03] nearby.
[57:06] The lifeline of Egypt is the Nile River,
[57:08] the the green wavy line in the photo.
[57:12] I'm sure you can see it right there. The
[57:15] Nile flows from south to the north.
[57:18] Thus, it has an east bank and a west
[57:21] bank.
[57:24] West represented death, the setting sun.
[57:29] Egyptian cemeteries such as the pyramids
[57:32] and the valley of the kings were on the
[57:34] west of the Nile. This view is looking
[57:37] west from a balloon near the Nile to the
[57:40] mortuary temple of Hatchepsuit
[57:44] which is located here.
[57:46] She was a powerful pharaoh. She was a
[57:49] powerful pharaoh and likely the woman
[57:52] who rescued Moses from the Nile. Behind
[57:55] the ridge above her temple
[58:00] is the Valley of the Kings where many of
[58:02] the pharaohs were buried.
[58:06] To the Egyptians, the east represented
[58:09] the source of life via the rising of the
[58:12] sun. Cities and towns were generally on
[58:15] the east side of the Nile. Here's a view
[58:17] of Luxor from the same balloon
[58:20] seen through the morning mist on the
[58:23] east bank of the Nile near sunrise.
[58:26] Notice a large collection of buildings
[58:29] across the Nile, but on this side, the
[58:31] east side of the Nile, there are some
[58:33] farms and so forth, but it's not densely
[58:35] populated. Having the entrance to the
[58:38] tabernacle complex on the east would
[58:41] have resonated with the Israelites
[58:43] coming out of slavery, looking for a
[58:46] rising sun, a new beginning in Canaan.
[58:56] Priests served inside the courtyard in
[58:59] the tabernacle itself. So obviously they
[59:02] could enter through the gate. But what
[59:05] about others?
[59:07] Can they enter the courtyard? Just go in
[59:10] and go out as they please. If so, how
[59:13] can they enter?
[59:16] Bring a sacrifice.
[59:18] It might be a free will offering, a sin
[59:20] offering, guilt offering, peace
[59:22] offering, and so forth. There were
[59:24] strict regulations for all of these
[59:26] found in the book of Leviticus and
[59:27] elsewhere.
[59:29] The general rule was that the
[59:31] worshipper, the one bringing the
[59:33] offering, would lay his hands on the
[59:35] head of the animal being sacrificed
[59:38] while the priest killed it. For example,
[59:41] Leviticus begins this way.
[59:44] The Lord called unto Moses, and spake
[59:46] unto him out of the tabernacle of the
[59:48] congregation, saying, Speak unto the
[59:51] children of Israel, and say unto them,
[59:53] If any man of you bring an offering unto
[59:55] the Lord, he shall bring your offering
[59:58] of the cattle, even of the herd, and of
[1:00:00] the flock.
[1:00:02] If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of
[1:00:04] the herd, let him offer a male without
[1:00:07] blemish. He shall offer of his own
[1:00:09] voluntary will at the door of the
[1:00:12] tabernacle of the congregation before
[1:00:14] the Lord. He shall put his hand upon the
[1:00:17] head of the burnt offering, and it shall
[1:00:19] be accepted for him to make atonement
[1:00:22] for him. He shall kill the bulock before
[1:00:25] the Lord, and the priests, Aaron's sons,
[1:00:27] shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the
[1:00:29] blood roundabout upon the altar that is
[1:00:32] by the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:00:35] congregation.
[1:00:38] This is not a pleasant place. You've got
[1:00:41] the bleeding of the animals. You've got
[1:00:43] the smell of burning animals. You've got
[1:00:45] the smell of the animal going through
[1:00:49] death.
[1:00:51] But notice
[1:00:53] the worshipper was not examined.
[1:00:56] The sacrifice had to meet certain
[1:00:59] requirements to be accepted after
[1:01:02] killing it and sprinkling its blood. And
[1:01:04] if a sin offering for example the sin
[1:01:06] was forgiven
[1:01:09] okay for an individual what if it's a
[1:01:12] sin of the community of the entire
[1:01:14] nation
[1:01:16] how was that handled how many sacrifices
[1:01:18] are required
[1:01:21] if it's such a thing certain
[1:01:22] representatives of the people were
[1:01:24] required to come to the door of the
[1:01:25] tabernacle Leviticus 4 tells us this
[1:01:29] if the whole congregation of Israel
[1:01:32] the entire nation
[1:01:34] sin through ignorance and the thing beh
[1:01:39] assembly and they have done somewhat
[1:01:41] against the commandments of the Lord
[1:01:42] concerning things which should not be
[1:01:44] done and are guilty.
[1:01:48] When when the sin which they have sinned
[1:01:51] against it is known,
[1:01:53] then the congregation shall offer a
[1:01:57] young bulock for the sin and bring him
[1:02:00] before the tabernacle of the
[1:02:02] congregation.
[1:02:06] And the elders of the congregation shall
[1:02:08] lay their hands upon the head of the
[1:02:10] bullock before the Lord, and the bulock
[1:02:12] shall be killed before the Lord.
[1:02:17] Notice, a single sacrifice can atone for
[1:02:22] the entire nation.
[1:02:25] Makes me think, oh, how I love Jesus.
[1:02:30] Bring the bulock for the sin. Bring him
[1:02:32] before the tabernacle of the
[1:02:33] congregation. I can see Pilate standing
[1:02:35] at the porch with Jesus and saying,
[1:02:37] "Behold the man.
[1:02:40] One died for all our sins."
[1:02:46] What if he came to the entry without a
[1:02:47] sacrifice? Were not a priest or a Levite
[1:02:50] with specific duties to perform in
[1:02:52] support of the priests? and describing
[1:02:55] the arrangements of the various tribes
[1:02:57] and where they're camped around the
[1:02:58] tabernacle the branches of the tribe of
[1:03:01] Levi while encamped in the journey
[1:03:03] through the wilderness. We read in
[1:03:04] numbers three,
[1:03:06] but those that encamp before the
[1:03:08] tabernacle toward the east
[1:03:12] by the gate, even before the tabernacle
[1:03:14] of the congregation eastward shall be
[1:03:16] Moses and Aaron and his sons,
[1:03:21] keeping the charge of the sanctuary for
[1:03:23] the charge of the children of Israel.
[1:03:26] And the stranger that cometh nigh shall
[1:03:29] be put to death.
[1:03:32] The sense of the word stranger here
[1:03:34] means not a priest or Levite with
[1:03:36] specific duties in support of the
[1:03:38] priestly roles.
[1:03:42] A parallel that we see in our lives as
[1:03:44] Christians comes to light.
[1:03:47] God lives, dwells, enclosed, surrounded
[1:03:51] by righteousness. To come into his
[1:03:54] presence without a sacrifice to cover or
[1:03:57] remove our sins, our sinful nature is
[1:04:01] death.
[1:04:02] but to come to him in humility,
[1:04:05] recognizing we are unrighteous in
[1:04:07] ourselves,
[1:04:09] guilty of sins we may not even
[1:04:10] recognize,
[1:04:12] but with our sacrifice.
[1:04:14] This allows us to come into the outer
[1:04:16] court. Not to his holy presence inside
[1:04:19] the tabernacle, but to come to the door
[1:04:22] of the tabernacle, inside the outer
[1:04:25] court, recognizing and confessing our
[1:04:28] sin,
[1:04:30] identifying with our sacrifice, which is
[1:04:33] Jesus Christ. His death cleanses and
[1:04:36] removes and transfers our sin so that we
[1:04:38] receive life and not death.
[1:04:44] To get into the outer court, you had to
[1:04:46] pass through the door, the gate. This
[1:04:49] was made of blue, purple, and red yarn,
[1:04:53] and fine linen.
[1:04:56] We're told that blue represented the
[1:04:58] heavens, and by extension,
[1:05:01] the divine presence.
[1:05:03] Purple dye was rare and thus expensive.
[1:05:07] Recall Paul's first convert to Christ in
[1:05:10] Europe was Lydia who made a good living
[1:05:13] selling purple cloth. Purple represented
[1:05:16] royalty and wealth.
[1:05:19] Recall when Jesus was crucified in John
[1:05:23] chapter 19. Then Pilate therefore took
[1:05:27] Jesus and scorged him.
[1:05:31] The soldiers plattered a crown of
[1:05:33] thorns, put it on his head, and they put
[1:05:36] on him a purple robe. What color?
[1:05:41] Purple. Why? And they said, "Hail, King
[1:05:45] of the Jews,
[1:05:47] king." Because purple signified royalty.
[1:05:51] And they smote him with their hands.
[1:06:03] Pilate therefore went forth again, and
[1:06:05] sth unto them, Behold, I bring him forth
[1:06:08] to you, that you may know that I find no
[1:06:10] fault in him. Then came Jesus forth,
[1:06:14] wearing the crown of thorns, and the
[1:06:16] purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them,
[1:06:20] "Behold the man."
[1:06:25] Scarlet, a bright red, represented the
[1:06:28] blood of sacrifice.
[1:06:30] White, as we've said, represents
[1:06:32] righteousness.
[1:06:34] And these four colors were part of the
[1:06:37] curtain, marking the only way in or out
[1:06:40] of the courtyard.
[1:06:42] Entering the outer court, the worshipper
[1:06:45] with his or her sacrifice would see the
[1:06:47] pillars or posts that support the linen
[1:06:50] curtain in all directions except for the
[1:06:52] curtain at the gate and the east end of
[1:06:55] the tabernacle itself.
[1:06:57] If the curtain at the courtyard entry is
[1:06:59] open, you may glimpse the world outside,
[1:07:01] but you're now in a different place.
[1:07:05] The gate was a barrier to prevent
[1:07:07] unlawful entry into the courtyard, a
[1:07:10] positive mark of separation from the
[1:07:12] world outside, a distinct boundary.
[1:07:17] Sadly, today, many have put up barriers
[1:07:20] that separate us from one another,
[1:07:23] breaking fellowship between Christians,
[1:07:26] denominational walls between churches,
[1:07:29] confusing opinion with revelation. Maybe
[1:07:33] We'll talk about that sometime. The gate
[1:07:36] also provided a way of approach first to
[1:07:40] the courtyard which will then lead to
[1:07:42] the tabernacle.
[1:07:44] Jesus described himself as the gate or
[1:07:47] door.
[1:07:49] John 10:7 Then said Jesus unto them
[1:07:52] again, verily, verily I say unto you, I
[1:07:56] am the door of the sheep. All that ever
[1:07:59] came before me are thieves and robbers,
[1:08:02] but the sheep did not hear them. I am
[1:08:05] the door. If any man by me, if any man
[1:08:08] enter in, he shall be saved and shall go
[1:08:11] in and out and find pasture.
[1:08:16] In the sermon on the mount, some of you
[1:08:18] may have heard of the sermon on the
[1:08:20] mount recently. In the sermon on the
[1:08:22] mount, Jesus also speaks of a gate.
[1:08:25] Matthew 7,
[1:08:28] enter ye in at the straight gate.
[1:08:30] Straight means small.
[1:08:33] For wide is the gate and broad is the
[1:08:35] way that leads to destruction. And many
[1:08:37] there be which go in there at. Because
[1:08:41] straight is the gate, narrow is the way
[1:08:45] which leadth to life, and few there be
[1:08:48] that find it.
[1:08:51] That find it. Jesus also said, "Seek and
[1:08:55] you will find. Knock and it will be
[1:08:59] opened unto you." The gate is small, yet
[1:09:02] it's large enough to accommodate any and
[1:09:05] all who choose to go through it.
[1:09:10] What else is in the outer court? Apart
[1:09:13] from the tabernacle, the the dominant
[1:09:16] feature is the altar of sacrifice. For
[1:09:19] the worshipper in the days of the
[1:09:20] tabernacle, it was the way to atone for
[1:09:23] sin, to be cleansed through the blood of
[1:09:26] the sacrifice. The the altar itself was
[1:09:30] hollow, made of acacia wood overlaid
[1:09:33] with copper or brass with a removable
[1:09:36] brass grate suspended within it.
[1:09:41] As I mentioned before, you had to lay
[1:09:43] your hands on the head of the
[1:09:45] sacrificial animal, symbolically
[1:09:48] transferring your sin to the animal
[1:09:51] which then bore the consequences, death.
[1:09:55] As Christians, we identify with Christ
[1:09:58] our sacrifice. Paul tells us in Romans
[1:10:01] 3, "For all,"
[1:10:05] that's a big word, all have sinned and
[1:10:08] come short of the glory of God. As
[1:10:11] Isaiah said that we read earlier, our
[1:10:14] righteousness is not sufficient.
[1:10:17] Paul goes on, "Being justified freely by
[1:10:20] his grace through the redemption that is
[1:10:23] in Christ Jesus, whom God hath set forth
[1:10:25] to be a propitiation." Propitiation
[1:10:29] means atonement, mercy, reconciliation.
[1:10:34] A propitiation through faith in his
[1:10:36] blood to declare his righteousness for
[1:10:39] the remission of sins that are passed
[1:10:42] through the forbearance of God.
[1:10:43] Forbearance means merciful restraint.
[1:10:48] Peter said in 1 Peter chapter 1, "For as
[1:10:52] much as you know that you were not
[1:10:53] redeemed with corruptible things, as
[1:10:56] silver and gold, from your vain
[1:10:58] conversation, which means your futile,
[1:11:01] your your empty way of life, received by
[1:11:04] tradition from your fathers." But if not
[1:11:09] through that, how are we redeemed? with
[1:11:11] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[1:11:14] lamb without blemish and without spot
[1:11:18] an acceptable sacrifice.
[1:11:23] Looking again at the courtyard,
[1:11:26] we see a kind of picture
[1:11:28] of the word of God. The word tells us
[1:11:31] sin has tells us that sin has been
[1:11:34] judged and put underfoot.
[1:11:36] Each post or pillar is in a socket of
[1:11:38] brass, separating it from the world, the
[1:11:41] soil of the earth, yet in the world. It
[1:11:45] holds up as its head the redemptive work
[1:11:48] of Christ in the silver capital. And at
[1:11:51] the same time displays on every hand the
[1:11:54] righteousness of God. The the curtain
[1:11:57] says to the world, "Keep out." But to
[1:11:59] the one who wants to approach God, come
[1:12:02] in here. You're welcome.
[1:12:05] In here is the only path for us to God
[1:12:08] through Jesus Christ our sacrifice. Even
[1:12:12] in the wilderness, representing the
[1:12:14] world, there is a way to approach him.
[1:12:18] The chords speak of God's love for us,
[1:12:21] the grace which gives us strength and
[1:12:23] stability through Christ. Without those
[1:12:26] cords, the wall falls down.
[1:12:31] Brother Brandon once likened the outer
[1:12:33] court of the tabernacle to our Christian
[1:12:34] life in a sermon, "Why are people so
[1:12:36] tossed about?" from New Year's Day 1956.
[1:12:40] I just read a couple of very short
[1:12:41] excerpts from it.
[1:12:43] The justified man out here, he walks by
[1:12:46] daylight. Some days are gloomy. Some
[1:12:48] days you do not know whether it's really
[1:12:51] worthwhile to serve God or not. You're
[1:12:54] walking in the outer court.
[1:12:57] Sure, you're eating mana. Sure, you're a
[1:12:59] believer. You you have eternal life. If
[1:13:01] you die, you go to heaven truly. But
[1:13:04] what kind of a life are you living? If
[1:13:06] the worship team would please come. He
[1:13:09] goes on to say that the weather in the
[1:13:10] outer court is the same as the weather
[1:13:12] outside the court. Some sunny days,
[1:13:16] gloomy and foggy days. It's variable.
[1:13:20] They say, "But brother Brad, am I ups
[1:13:22] and downs? Oh, I'm the most miserable
[1:13:24] person. I have to fight every day." Oh
[1:13:27] yes, brother. It's where you're walking.
[1:13:30] That's all right. Then say, "Well, I
[1:13:33] want to go a little deeper.
[1:13:36] A little deeper."
[1:13:38] That's for next time.
[1:13:41] Here it is. Time to close. And we're
[1:13:43] only just inside the gate.
[1:13:46] And there are so many questions.
[1:13:49] What about the tabernacle?
[1:13:51] Why a tent and not a proper building?
[1:13:55] What's inside? How is it constructed?
[1:13:58] Who constructed it? And who are these
[1:14:01] priests?
[1:14:03] Why are they dressed that way? What do
[1:14:05] they do?
[1:14:08] This was all nearly 3,500 years ago. Why
[1:14:11] should we care?
[1:14:13] How does it apply to us?
[1:14:17] I ask for your prayers and putting
[1:14:20] together answers to these and other
[1:14:22] related questions as we continue this
[1:14:24] series. I also want to acknowledge my
[1:14:27] brother Null for his notes and
[1:14:29] discussions we've had while he was here
[1:14:31] this last month about the tabernacle.
[1:14:34] Finally, for this evening, we recognize
[1:14:37] that the linen wall around the whole
[1:14:38] tabernacle complex forms a sanctuary,
[1:14:42] a place set aside for worship.
[1:14:46] for renewal, for cleansing,
[1:14:49] for approaching God. As brother Daniel
[1:14:52] comes to conclude tonight's service,
[1:14:54] let's worship in this sanctuary and sing
[1:14:57] together. Lord, prepare me to be a
[1:15:01] sanctuary.
[1:15:06] Lord, prepare
[1:15:09] me
[1:15:11] to be a sanctuary,
[1:15:18] pure and [singing] holy, [music]
[1:15:24] tried and true,
[1:15:30] with [music] thanksgiving.
[1:15:35] I'll be a living
[1:15:39] [singing]
[1:15:42] sanctuary
[1:15:48] for you.
[1:15:54] Lord, [music] prepare
[1:15:56] me
[1:15:58] to be a [singing] sanctuary,
[1:16:05] pure and holy,
[1:16:11] tried and true
[1:16:16] with thanksgiving.
[1:16:23] Amen.
[1:16:39] Now what struck me the most
[1:16:43] is when brother Ly put up the the
[1:16:46] diagram
[1:16:47] of the tabernacle there and the uh the
[1:16:51] structure that surrounded the tabernacle
[1:16:53] the the court
[1:16:56] 150 ft by 75 ft. I think that was the I
[1:16:59] think that's the um dimensions you gave.
[1:17:03] And then the tent
[1:17:06] way back inside of that.
[1:17:09] I mean 150 ft by 75 ft.
[1:17:13] That's smaller than the lot that I live
[1:17:15] on.
[1:17:17] And God
[1:17:19] blessed this place. And God designed it
[1:17:23] himself. I asked brother Lyall, I said,
[1:17:27] "If you could kind of go into some of
[1:17:28] the details,
[1:17:31] the reason the details are important is
[1:17:34] because they're in the Bible.
[1:17:36] God saw it fit
[1:17:39] to design
[1:17:42] the silver, the brass,
[1:17:45] the the
[1:17:48] gate facing east,
[1:17:51] the um the different the ways even the
[1:17:54] the the courts
[1:17:57] that supported the the the fence, the
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; um the court, the the the perimeter.
[1:18:05] and he had a way to do it. And it's just
[1:18:09] amazing to me that of all the whole
[1:18:13] world
[1:18:15] that that little tiny structure with all
[1:18:19] of these little tiny details
[1:18:23] was the place that God blessed.
[1:18:27] And the pillar of fire was over it by
[1:18:30] night, and the pillar of cloud was by
[1:18:32] day. Wasn't it neat seeing the the
[1:18:35] picture that Brother Lyle had of of the
[1:18:38] tabernacle of uh the one in Israel? Wow.
[1:18:43] Just this little humble little thing
[1:18:46] and that's the tabernacle in the
[1:18:48] wilderness. It's just amazing to me.
[1:18:51] Bill, thank you. I appreciate you doing
[1:18:54] this and going through these these
[1:18:56] little details. They are important
[1:18:59] or else they wouldn't be in our Bible.
[1:19:03] Let's all stand. Brother Aaron.
[1:19:06] Oh Lord, prepare
[1:19:10] me.
[1:19:12] to be a sanctuary,
[1:19:19] pure and holy, [singing]
[1:19:21] [music]
[1:19:25] tried and true,
[1:19:30] with thanksgiving. [singing]
[1:19:36] I'll be a living
[1:19:42] sanctuary
[1:19:47] for you.
[1:19:52] Oh Lord, prepare
[1:19:55] me
[1:19:57] to be a sanctuary, [music]
[1:20:04] pure and holy,
[1:20:10] tried and true,
[1:20:15] with thanksgiving.
[1:20:21] I'll be a living
[1:20:27] sanctuary [singing]
[1:20:32] for you.
[1:20:35] Brother Ed, you're back with us. Could
[1:20:37] you come and close for that doole?
[1:20:58] Kathy went back and visited family
[1:21:02] past couple weeks and brother we miss
[1:21:04] you.
[1:21:11] I was thinking as brother Ly was talking
[1:21:15] and seeing the diagram
[1:21:19] and
[1:21:21] 150 ft and 75 ft wide.
[1:21:26] Just trying to put it in perspective
[1:21:30] from here to those doors is already 71
[1:21:33] ft.
[1:21:35] So, it wasn't really
[1:21:38] a massive area,
[1:21:40] but the details that God
[1:21:46] place an emphasis on
[1:21:48] just on the tabernacle, and I was
[1:21:51] thinking also if he was so concerned
[1:21:54] about those little details on the
[1:21:56] tabernacle, how much more is he
[1:22:01] concerned about us? That's right.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; The details in our life.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; So take that and just ponder that
[1:22:12] for a little bit and know what a
[1:22:13] merciful God we serve.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[1:22:18] Our heavenly father,
[1:22:22] Lord, as brother Lyall brought forth
[1:22:25] the beginning of this series, Lord, and
[1:22:29] and read the scripture and how you were
[1:22:33] So mindful of the little details
[1:22:37] all the way down to the to the pins that
[1:22:40] would hold
[1:22:42] the tent,
[1:22:44] the curtain around the
[1:22:46] the tent, Lord, and the inner court.
[1:22:50] And thank you, Lord, how much you're
[1:22:52] mindful of us. And Father, we're
[1:22:55] thankful for
[1:22:57] your word and for this study. Now, Lord,
[1:23:01] as we would close this service. We want
[1:23:04] to commit ourselves into your hands and
[1:23:07] ask that you'd go with us and bless us
[1:23:10] this evening. Lord,
[1:23:12] prepare us, Lord, to serve you even
[1:23:15] more. And and for the service coming up
[1:23:18] this Sunday, we'd ask that you would
[1:23:22] prepare everything, Lord. Bless each one
[1:23:25] that's here as they go. Grant them rest
[1:23:28] this evening. be with us tomorrow and
[1:23:31] the remainder of this week and we give
[1:23:33] you praise, honor and glory in the
[1:23:35] precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:23:42] Vera land
[1:23:46] a kind of home
[1:23:52] for a country
[1:23:58] to which I've [singing] never
[1:24:04] been before.
[1:24:11] Sad goodbye.
[1:24:14] [music]
[1:24:16] Will there be spoken?
[1:24:21] For time won't matter
[1:24:28] anymore.
[1:24:33] Build the land.
[1:24:38] I am longing for you.
[1:24:45] And someday [music and singing]
[1:24:50] on thee I'll stand
[1:24:56] there. [singing] My home
[1:25:01] shall be eternal.
[1:25:08] You la land,
[1:25:12] sweet
[1:25:14] land.
[1:25:18] I'm looking [singing]
[1:25:20] now
[1:25:24] across that river
[1:25:30] where my faith
[1:25:35] will end inside.
[1:25:40] There's just a few
[1:25:46] more days to labor.
[1:25:52] Then I will [singing] take
[1:25:57] my heavenly fly.
[1:26:03] Oh, build the land.
[1:26:08] I am longing for you.
[1:26:15] And someday [music and singing]
[1:26:19] on thee I'll stand.
[1:26:25] There my [singing] home
[1:26:30] shall [singing] be
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; eternal.
[1:26:37] Bua land
[1:26:42] sweet
[1:26:44] land. One more time the chorus.
[1:26:47] Oh Bill land,
[1:26:52] I am longing for you.
[1:26:59] And someday
[1:27:03] on thee I'll stand
[1:27:09] there. My [singing] home
[1:27:14] shall be eternal
[1:27:22] land
[1:27:25] sweet
[1:27:28] land.
[1:27:31] Beautiful song.
[1:27:33] So so many things are symbolic and even
[1:27:36] the Hebrews wandering in the wilderness.
[1:27:40] wanting to go over that Jordan River.
[1:27:43] It's just similar to that song. We want
[1:27:45] to go over into that promised land, into
[1:27:47] that beautiful land.
[1:27:50] It's uh it's a promise. We're going to
[1:27:52] get there one day. Reminder for service
[1:27:55] this Sunday. I'm going to get back into
[1:27:57] sermon on the mount. We'll start with
[1:28:00] Matthew chapter 6 verse one. And uh
[1:28:04] we'll see how far we get. I'll read it
[1:28:07] so you're thinking about it. Take heed
[1:28:09] that you do not your alms before men to
[1:28:12] be seen of them otherwise you have no
[1:28:14] reward of your father which is in
[1:28:17] heaven.
[1:28:18] Most of the chapter is going to be about
[1:28:20] that about uh about your motives.
[1:28:25] Why are you doing things? Why why are
[1:28:27] you making an offering? So look forward
[1:28:30] to that on Sunday. And Sunday evening,
[1:28:32] we'll probably have a prayer service and
[1:28:35] hopefully some some good it's always
[1:28:38] good music, but hopefully some song
[1:28:39] specials. God bless you, friends. Pray
[1:28:42] the Lord be with you. You're dismissed.
[1:28:50] I am longing for you.
[1:28:57] And someday [singing and music]
[1:29:02] on thee [music] I'll stand
[1:29:08] there. My home
[1:29:13] shall be eternal.
[1:29:20] Build the land.
[1:29:25] Rebuke
[1:29:27] the second verse.
[1:29:31] I'm looking now
[1:29:36] across the river
[1:29:42] to where my faith
[1:29:48] will end inside.
[1:29:53] There's just a few
[1:29:58] more days to live.
[1:30:04] Then I will take
[1:30:10] my heavenly father.
[1:30:15] Oh, beautiful land
[1:30:21] I am longing for you.
[1:30:27] And someday [singing and music]
[1:30:32] on thee I'll stand
[1:30:38] there. My home
[1:30:43] shall be [music and singing]
[1:30:45] eternal.
[1:30:49] Build the land.
[1:30:54] Sweet
[1:30:56] land.
[1:30:59] Oh
[1:31:01] lamb.
[1:31:05] I am longing [music]
[1:31:07] for you.
[1:31:12] And someday [singing]
[1:31:16] on thee I'll [music and singing]
