[47:36] announcements
[47:37] remember at four o'clock this afternoon
[47:40] the memorial service for our brother
[47:42] Robert Chacon
[47:45] and um
[47:47] I we were bringing some of the food and
[47:50] things in
[47:52] and if you ever watch brother Robert
[47:53] when the food were there he'd get a
[47:55] little bag and he put a handful of
[47:57] things and then he'd go set it somewhere
[47:59] so he would have some after service for
[48:01] himself
[48:03] and as I was put there I just said
[48:04] Robert you can't do that today
[48:07] you got to wait for the rest of us so
[48:10] just spending this week thinking it's
[48:12] about some of the things and
[48:14] I appreciate that God allows us to have
[48:17] good memories and precious things to
[48:19] remember
[48:21] to comfort ourselves and then
[48:23] this coming Thursday
[48:26] through Sunday the meetings here at the
[48:28] Tabernacle with our brother Joe Adams
[48:30] and our brother Aaron Oglesby
[48:32] so we're going to cancel Wednesday night
[48:34] service and we'll start Thursday at 7 pm
[48:38] Friday at 7 pm
[48:40] Saturday at six and Sunday morning
[48:43] at 10 A.M brother Joe and brother Aaron
[48:46] had asked for the one service and then a
[48:48] fellowship after on
[48:50] on Sunday so
[48:52] we've invited the local churches and the
[48:56] folks around and made it made them
[48:57] welcome so folks said they are coming
[49:00] but I know one who promised he said he'd
[49:02] be here so let's just just just wait on
[49:06] that and see what what God would do for
[49:07] us so
[49:09] and um
[49:11] this morning
[49:15] um
[49:16] I woke up early
[49:18] and I'd ask the Lord just just just give
[49:21] me a
[49:22] give me some a precious dream give me
[49:24] something just to encourage me
[49:26] and he didn't
[49:30] but he's still God
[49:32] and um but something came in my heart
[49:35] just on
[49:37] I guess it would have been Thursday
[49:40] and of all the things that we should be
[49:43] anticipating and looking for
[49:45] that's the soon coming of the Lord
[49:48] that should be our priority
[49:51] but in that priority and in that I I was
[49:55] talking to a brother brother today and
[49:58] and I said you know we we want
[50:01] we just memories and things we want we
[50:04] want to we want to take as many as we
[50:05] can with us
[50:08] so I was thinking about that and I said
[50:10] Lord you know we want you to I would
[50:12] want you to come today take us home
[50:14] today
[50:15] but at the same time I want that
[50:17] opportunity for others
[50:20] and and so there was that was in my
[50:22] heart and just some things reading
[50:24] reading some scriptures and things that
[50:26] brother Branham said and
[50:27] experiences in life and
[50:31] the the scripture that came to me is
[50:33] that just spoke to my heart was found in
[50:35] Genesis
[50:37] chapter 18 when Abraham is talking to
[50:39] God
[50:42] when God comes down and talks to him
[50:44] about
[50:45] about Sodom he was going to go down to
[50:47] Sodom and and destroy
[50:50] for their wickedness and all
[50:53] if we're living in a wicked generation
[50:55] it's now the things that are that are
[50:58] happening
[51:00] but the spirit of Abraham called out to
[51:02] to God and he said
[51:04] we're just going to take one of the
[51:05] verses 18 32.
[51:08] but Abraham looks and he says to God he
[51:11] said if there be 50.
[51:14] left and Sodom
[51:16] that are still righteous
[51:19] or still seeking your face
[51:21] would you withheld withhold your
[51:23] destruction
[51:25] and God tells them yes for 50 I will not
[51:28] destroy the city
[51:30] I think Abraham had a good idea that
[51:33] there was not 50 there
[51:35] so he drops it down to 40.
[51:38] and God says for 40. and he drops it
[51:40] down to 20.
[51:42] and he drops it down to 10.
[51:45] and God says Abraham for ten I will not
[51:48] destroy this city
[51:49] and that's where he says and he said oh
[51:52] let not the Lord be angry and I will
[51:55] speak yet but this once pray Adventure
[51:58] 10 shall be found there and he said I
[52:02] will not destroy it for Ten's sake
[52:05] and and as I I was thinking about then I
[52:08] sort of said Lord you are merciful
[52:11] you are long-suffering
[52:14] and and sometimes if it was if it was
[52:17] being given to us we might have said
[52:18] enough is enough I'm done with this
[52:22] but here's Abraham the father of our
[52:24] faith
[52:25] saying is there but an opportunity for
[52:28] one more
[52:30] and and it was just my heart and
[52:33] but the thought was what is that what if
[52:35] this was Resurrection morning
[52:39] I heard a brother speaking to this and
[52:40] it just just stirred my heart up
[52:43] and they said did you wake up this
[52:45] morning at six o'clock and think
[52:47] sometime between six and nine in the
[52:50] morning he's coming
[52:52] did you wake up there and say could it
[52:54] be this morning
[52:56] or did we just get up and go and
[52:58] continue on our business
[53:01] and it really struck a a a chord in my
[53:04] uh a thought in me and I say Lord
[53:06] I know that when I get up and I go I I
[53:09] speak with you and oh sometimes driving
[53:11] me into work I'll listen to a portion of
[53:14] a message or pray or whatever
[53:16] but my mind is more on what I have to
[53:18] accomplish that day
[53:20] work wise whatever it might be and got
[53:23] to be here got to be there got to text
[53:25] and they want me here first and my mind
[53:28] is more on that than Lord could this be
[53:30] that morning
[53:33] and what a day that will be
[53:36] it you know and just thinking about some
[53:38] of those things and
[53:40] it set my heart to think a little bit
[53:42] about that I said let me just Lord let
[53:44] me just
[53:45] talk to the congregation a little bit
[53:47] about this
[53:49] maybe in the morning when you wake up
[53:50] and I don't know what time you get up
[53:52] some are up very early and some not so
[53:54] early and
[53:56] but between six and nine remember said
[54:00] that Resurrection
[54:02] those saints that died in Christ are
[54:04] going to are going to be but be
[54:06] appearing
[54:08] and I said could it be this morning
[54:11] and if not this morning will it be
[54:13] tomorrow morning
[54:15] and if not the next morning then Lord
[54:17] let me anticipate it every morning
[54:21] first of all
[54:23] but also then as as I begin to think
[54:25] about that but what about others Lord
[54:27] that don't have this hope
[54:30] or maybe some that are going through a
[54:32] hard struggle and and wondering and and
[54:34] battling and they've been hurt they've
[54:36] been
[54:37] they've been Cast Away and all
[54:40] and I thank God that he is a god of The
[54:43] Castaways also
[54:44] because what chance would we have
[54:47] you know we were talking about some of
[54:49] the things that
[54:50] going back I was raised in church my
[54:52] whole life
[54:54] I've really never known the world
[54:58] but I could have become a very
[54:59] self-righteous Christian
[55:01] I've done enough Lord you have to take
[55:03] me home
[55:04] I think God hates that Spirit more than
[55:06] the other one
[55:08] the one that says just one more time
[55:10] lord would you have I think he just
[55:12] rather than Lord I think about the the
[55:15] man that stood there and he's praying he
[55:16] says Lord you know and then he says I'm
[55:18] thank I'm God I'm not like that public
[55:21] in there
[55:22] and and the Publican is saying have
[55:24] mercy on me One More Time Lord
[55:26] and God look to that public and
[55:30] Abraham's heart was reaching out because
[55:32] he had a nephew there and he had some
[55:34] loved ones there and he had and they
[55:36] were he was calling God if there's a
[55:38] possibility would you not destroy that
[55:40] City for that one
[55:43] you might look back at your own family
[55:45] or a loved one or maybe a neighbor or a
[55:47] good friend and saying God could you
[55:49] reach out and minister to that one could
[55:51] you reach out and touch their hearts
[55:53] someone some way myself somebody else
[55:55] could get to them
[55:57] and give them give them a hope
[56:00] Inspire something in them
[56:03] so if this was Resurrection morning
[56:07] what would our actions be
[56:10] how would we how would we behave in
[56:12] ourselves well how would what would be
[56:13] thinking how would we be acting
[56:16] I've shared this with be before with you
[56:19] and
[56:20] I knew that I wasn't out living in the
[56:24] world but I knew that I wasn't serving
[56:25] the lord that I like I should be
[56:28] around eighth grade or so
[56:31] and if I got home and Mama wasn't at
[56:33] home my mom wasn't home
[56:35] I'd start calling all over till I found
[56:37] her
[56:39] and I would say good Rapture hasn't
[56:41] taken place yet
[56:43] we chuckle about it now but it was a
[56:45] fear in me
[56:48] and then later I thought how come you
[56:50] never felt that way about Dad because
[56:51] Dad was working
[56:53] okay
[56:54] but Mom was supposed to be home
[56:57] so that okay that's an eighth grader
[56:59] working this way
[57:01] until one day I met God for myself
[57:05] and then it changed
[57:07] then it was if he comes today I'm going
[57:09] with him also
[57:11] but when you have the spirit of God and
[57:13] and it which was in Abraham you would
[57:15] say Lord is there a chance and
[57:17] opportunity for one more
[57:19] for my brother for my sister for my
[57:22] neighbor for that sinner in the world
[57:24] whoever that is an opportunity to get to
[57:27] know you and and it doesn't take God 20
[57:30] years to get somebody ready
[57:33] he could turn around and say this day
[57:35] you'll be with me in Paradise
[57:38] I remember
[57:40] my father-in-law when he was
[57:42] he had gotten sick and they'd take him
[57:44] to the hospital and he couldn't hardly
[57:45] breathe
[57:47] and do through some things that he had
[57:49] gone through he had felt he had turned
[57:51] his back on God he never forgave himself
[57:53] for so many years
[57:55] we would talk to him and we would
[57:57] encourage him he wasn't living a life of
[57:59] sin going out to the world but he just
[58:01] just didn't he felt like he had he had
[58:03] offended God
[58:06] and and we tried over the years and he
[58:09] would tell us you go to church you serve
[58:10] the Lord but I can't
[58:13] he got quite sick he was taken to the
[58:15] hospital
[58:17] they called my wife and they call my dad
[58:20] to go over and pray for him
[58:22] my dad got to spend about two hours with
[58:24] him there at the hospital bed
[58:26] at TMC
[58:29] and my dad began to talk to him and say
[58:31] because at that point he had not been
[58:33] intubated yet and he could still talk
[58:35] but he's having a lot of trouble
[58:36] breathing
[58:38] and right there in the bed he made his
[58:40] heart right before God
[58:43] how long does it take
[58:46] to make your heart rate
[58:49] and right then and there so by the time
[58:51] my wife got to the hospital he had been
[58:53] intubated and he could no longer speak
[58:57] so my wife asked him daddy are you okay
[58:59] and he said
[59:02] are you afraid and he goes no
[59:04] are you ready to go and he goes yes
[59:07] doesn't take any more than that
[59:11] for God to reach down
[59:14] so you say well you know it's it's taken
[59:17] me
[59:18] well for me now 63 years to get here
[59:21] but for that one next to the Head
[59:23] crossed that very day he met God in
[59:26] Paradise
[59:28] and and this same God in John 11.
[59:31] chapter 11 21-26
[59:34] he's taken on flesh he's walking on this
[59:37] Earth he's he's amongst his disciples
[59:39] he's he's amongst all the people you
[59:42] know and he's walking he's we don't know
[59:44] all the things he said but the
[59:46] scriptures do say that if everything was
[59:48] written and recorded what he did the
[59:50] books could not hold so so it it just
[59:53] you know he was in amongst the people he
[59:55] he did he didn't hide himself from
[59:57] everybody
[59:58] when they went and they asked Mary could
[1:00:01] you ask Jesus to do something about this
[1:00:04] obviously they had heard they had seen
[1:00:07] that he was able to do things
[1:00:10] speak and things happen
[1:00:12] but here
[1:00:14] we know about Lazarus here in John 11
[1:00:16] verses 21 to 26
[1:00:20] . when we know that Lazarus had passed
[1:00:22] away
[1:00:23] and Jesus just tells his disciples we'll
[1:00:25] go later
[1:00:26] he's sleeping no well then he's doing no
[1:00:28] he's passed away but there was a reason
[1:00:30] why he was going to go at that time
[1:00:34] now we know he's come close and then
[1:00:36] Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou
[1:00:38] Hat's been here my brother had not died
[1:00:41] they were confident they were sure in
[1:00:43] that
[1:00:43] they knew what he was able to do but I
[1:00:46] know that even now whatsoever thou will
[1:00:48] ask of God God will give it thee
[1:00:51] obviously something had happened in
[1:00:53] their lives something they had seen they
[1:00:56] had this confidence they had got to know
[1:00:58] God
[1:00:58] he had become personal to them a friend
[1:01:01] to them that the the if we could say the
[1:01:03] news and all had gotten around about out
[1:01:05] about him what he was able to do
[1:01:08] so she says that and Jesus said unto her
[1:01:11] thy brother shall rise again
[1:01:15] and she said amen you can read the next
[1:01:18] scripture
[1:01:19] Martha said unto him I know that he
[1:01:21] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[1:01:24] the last day
[1:01:26] and and I have that same promise you
[1:01:29] have that same confidence amen those
[1:01:32] that have gone to sleep and go and God
[1:01:34] will rise
[1:01:36] that's a promise but she didn't realize
[1:01:39] Resurrection was standing right there in
[1:01:41] front of her talking to her
[1:01:43] and and so
[1:01:45] he says thy brother she goes I know he
[1:01:48] shall rise again in the resurrection in
[1:01:49] that last day Jesus said unto her I am
[1:01:53] the resurrection and the life he that
[1:01:56] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:01:59] shall he live
[1:02:02] and you know what a promise we have
[1:02:05] what an encouragement we have to think
[1:02:08] we went the other day and had not been
[1:02:11] to uh to the cemetery in a while but we
[1:02:14] went to pick up brother Robert's remains
[1:02:16] and I thought of those folks that are
[1:02:17] buried in South lawn that we know family
[1:02:20] and friends part of the church and
[1:02:21] different ones
[1:02:22] and we know their bodies would lay there
[1:02:25] but that's not going to stop them
[1:02:28] they're not going to be knocking on that
[1:02:30] top of that coffin saying somebody get
[1:02:32] me out no no no there's a resurrection
[1:02:35] a promise and he says
[1:02:38] yes and whosoever liveth and believeth
[1:02:41] in me shall never die then he asks
[1:02:43] believeth thou this
[1:02:46] and I have to ask you the same thing do
[1:02:48] you believe this yourself
[1:02:50] do you have that same confidence is it
[1:02:53] an assurance in your life
[1:02:56] that though the skin worms destroy this
[1:02:59] body
[1:03:00] job is looking over and he's seen and he
[1:03:02] said I've seen I I've seen the weather
[1:03:04] change and I see the weather pattern and
[1:03:07] and in Spring we begin to see the the
[1:03:09] plants butt up we begin to see the
[1:03:11] growth and all and summer comes and it
[1:03:13] develops but fall comes and we begin to
[1:03:16] see the change
[1:03:17] and and then in into winter and they
[1:03:20] disappear but the next spring they rise
[1:03:22] again
[1:03:24] but I've seen men laid into the ground
[1:03:27] and I've never seen them come up again
[1:03:31] but something down inside of Joe cries I
[1:03:35] know my redeemer liveth
[1:03:38] and with these eyes I Shall Behold Him
[1:03:43] and so this this was what was in my
[1:03:45] heart of thinking These Eyes Shall
[1:03:48] Behold Him
[1:03:50] it's not hey you know I saw him
[1:03:54] but it's going to be able to say I have
[1:03:57] seen him I have to walk with him I I my
[1:04:00] own brothers and sisters those that have
[1:04:02] we've gotten to know here at the
[1:04:03] Tabernacle and or wherever that have
[1:04:05] gone on Christians without hope and I
[1:04:08] see Sister Barbara and sister glidewell
[1:04:11] their brother George and sister Mike
[1:04:12] brother Mike sorry about that
[1:04:14] brother Mike you know to think about
[1:04:17] them to come walking in
[1:04:19] I might not know them
[1:04:21] because I don't know that I'm going to
[1:04:22] know them at 21 years old
[1:04:25] My Sister Barbara
[1:04:27] and sister Gladwell the joy
[1:04:30] what a day that'll be
[1:04:33] you know I I think about it I I remember
[1:04:37] my grandmother on both sides of the
[1:04:38] family they were older
[1:04:41] so that's my picture of them I've seen
[1:04:43] pictures of them
[1:04:45] but my dad had an experience
[1:04:48] the Lord spoke he gave him a vision
[1:04:53] asking
[1:04:54] when this message came and he gave his
[1:04:56] heart to it asking why some of his other
[1:04:59] family
[1:05:00] had nobody said I know my mother had
[1:05:02] been a Christian all her life
[1:05:05] and the Lord showed her to me at about
[1:05:07] 19 years old dressed in white and she
[1:05:10] comes and she puts her arm on my
[1:05:11] shoulder and she talks to me
[1:05:13] it's a reality
[1:05:16] it is a reality it's it's brother
[1:05:20] John Rojas a good friend of ours
[1:05:23] he was passing away with with cancer
[1:05:26] and him and his wife were in the room
[1:05:28] the doctor said just given him just a a
[1:05:31] few weeks to live and we had known him
[1:05:32] back in the Pentecostal Church in
[1:05:34] California when the message came they
[1:05:36] moved to Arizona and and you know here
[1:05:39] and and he had had been filled with
[1:05:41] cancer and the doctors gave him a couple
[1:05:43] a week and while he was in the room and
[1:05:45] his wife saw it also an angel came into
[1:05:47] the room
[1:05:48] and told them well done not good and
[1:05:51] faithful servant
[1:05:52] you'll be going home
[1:05:54] those promises are true
[1:05:58] they are alive they are real
[1:06:01] in one of these mornings
[1:06:03] it's going to happen
[1:06:06] I think of brother Jose Ramirez brother
[1:06:09] Daniel Ramirez's father
[1:06:12] who in the 40s had been an interpreter
[1:06:14] for brother Branham
[1:06:16] but didn't follow didn't understand the
[1:06:18] message till later in his life
[1:06:21] but when he was sick and he was coming
[1:06:23] close to death
[1:06:25] and his wife and his daughter were
[1:06:27] sitting around him and he didn't he said
[1:06:29] I haven't eaten hey he hadn't eaten and
[1:06:31] they were trying to encourage him to eat
[1:06:34] and she was saying Daddy you know you
[1:06:36] need to eat you're getting weak you're
[1:06:38] losing your strength
[1:06:40] and he turned and looked at him he says
[1:06:41] I just ate
[1:06:43] and he's laying there in bed
[1:06:46] and they knew he just hadn't eaten
[1:06:48] because he's been laying there a bit
[1:06:50] and they said you just ate and he began
[1:06:52] to call out the names of those that had
[1:06:54] passed on he said they were just here
[1:06:56] with me
[1:06:58] and he called up he called out the name
[1:07:00] and I believe it was brother Mike Bear's
[1:07:02] little sister that had passed away very
[1:07:04] young he said she just gave me something
[1:07:07] to eat
[1:07:08] and they realized that he was closer to
[1:07:10] the other side than this side now
[1:07:14] the reality of a resurrection
[1:07:18] amen
[1:07:20] I hope
[1:07:22] that we have that lies within us
[1:07:25] amen great is his faith
[1:07:28] then their words to him was Daddy
[1:07:31] greet Danny for us when you cross over
[1:07:34] and he went home
[1:07:37] now what a way to go
[1:07:39] what a way to go
[1:07:41] but the Lord has Jesus asked
[1:07:44] Mary Martha he says do you believe this
[1:07:50] do you have enough Faith are you
[1:07:52] confident that it's for you also
[1:07:57] though the though God slay me as I'll
[1:08:00] trust him job said with these eyes I
[1:08:02] shall see my redeemer
[1:08:06] foreign
[1:08:07] go to Matthew
[1:08:10] chapter 27.
[1:08:13] verses 50 to 53.
[1:08:18] and this is crucifixion day
[1:08:23] and when he had Jesus when he had cried
[1:08:26] again with a loud voice yielded up the
[1:08:29] ghost
[1:08:30] and behold the veil of the temples was
[1:08:32] rent in Twain From the top to the bottom
[1:08:35] and the Earth did quake and the Rocks
[1:08:38] rent
[1:08:41] foreign
[1:08:46] and many bodies of the Saints which
[1:08:50] slept arose and came out of the graves
[1:08:52] after his resurrection and went into the
[1:08:55] holy city and appeared unto many
[1:09:00] it's written in the scriptures because
[1:09:02] it is true
[1:09:04] it's it's you you you base your faith on
[1:09:07] the scriptures and it is true God is
[1:09:09] faithful and appeared to many
[1:09:13] and and they began to begin to to see
[1:09:16] them
[1:09:17] could could you imagine that brother
[1:09:20] green had a dream I believe it was
[1:09:21] brother green that had the dream
[1:09:23] and he saw some of the brothers
[1:09:25] who we all knew of much older brothers
[1:09:27] here at the church and I don't remember
[1:09:29] all the ones he saw
[1:09:31] but he was standing there and these
[1:09:33] young men came up to him and began to
[1:09:35] talk to him
[1:09:38] and I just blanked on his name he used
[1:09:41] to do the sound
[1:09:44] yeah brother Murray if I believe it was
[1:09:47] him and he was it was a short brother
[1:09:49] and he's standing there and he saw me
[1:09:50] goes he don't remember me he don't know
[1:09:52] me he don't know who I am it was brother
[1:09:54] Murray as a Young Man
[1:09:57] what a promise we have
[1:10:00] yes
[1:10:02] but let's not put it so far away
[1:10:06] it could be in the morning
[1:10:10] some glad morning when this life is over
[1:10:15] he said brother Aaron I've got a lot of
[1:10:16] things I'd like to do me too
[1:10:20] some of those I've given up on him I'll
[1:10:22] never be a star athlete
[1:10:25] not that I ever really wanted to be but
[1:10:27] I've kind of gave a
[1:10:29] brother Dan Evan sent me a text
[1:10:31] yesterday I heard a rumor
[1:10:32] it was your birthday and I said yeah
[1:10:34] it's the 63rd time that rumor has been
[1:10:36] mentioned
[1:10:37] you know
[1:10:39] Life Goes On
[1:10:42] but one of these days bro Dan you're
[1:10:45] going to see me like when I was about 21
[1:10:47] years old
[1:10:48] with a full mustache
[1:10:52] got a text although you've been around
[1:10:54] for a while got a text from Joshua
[1:10:55] Hernandez
[1:10:57] saying happy birthday and we got to
[1:10:59] writing and I said how do you remember
[1:11:01] me and this was his words
[1:11:04] he said I had lunch with Pancho Villa
[1:11:07] because I used to wear a full mustache
[1:11:10] and I started laughing because I forgot
[1:11:12] that that's what they used to call me
[1:11:14] him and Nate and some of the young men
[1:11:16] at that age
[1:11:18] and I told him I don't have it anymore
[1:11:19] and he said what
[1:11:22] said yeah it stopped growing on some of
[1:11:25] the spots and it was spotty and I asked
[1:11:27] mama if I could
[1:11:29] my wife if I could
[1:11:31] shave it off and she had never seen me
[1:11:34] without it and she said no
[1:11:36] I don't know but then she told me to go
[1:11:38] ahead and shave it off and I did
[1:11:41] Sunday morning came to church
[1:11:43] and sister Martha
[1:11:45] Peterson turned around looked at me said
[1:11:47] you're shaved your mustache off
[1:11:49] and three days later I told my wife I
[1:11:52] shaved my mustache off and she goes
[1:11:54] really when
[1:11:58] I I appreciate God having a sense of
[1:12:00] humor don't you
[1:12:02] but the things that that in life and we
[1:12:04] look back now I'm further this way than
[1:12:07] that way
[1:12:08] but I have a hope I have a promise
[1:12:12] I have more than I have an assurance in
[1:12:15] my life
[1:12:17] that is what the Seal of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:18] does in your life it's a Blessed
[1:12:20] assurance
[1:12:23] as job said though God slay me yet the
[1:12:25] SK the skin words would eat this body
[1:12:28] I have a promise with these eyes I shall
[1:12:30] see
[1:12:32] Jesus tells her I am the resurrection
[1:12:37] and and and and at that you have to
[1:12:40] realize and they say
[1:12:41] yes Lord you are the resurrection and
[1:12:44] you're living in me
[1:12:46] and that's how I will be Resurrected
[1:12:51] now
[1:12:52] Paul tells us in Thessalonians chapter
[1:12:55] 4.
[1:12:58] verses 13 through 18.
[1:13:06] I don't know what the discussions were I
[1:13:08] don't know what the people were saying
[1:13:09] but you can read in the description say
[1:13:11] that they had said we've heard this
[1:13:13] promise people have told us this for
[1:13:15] many years but where is this coming
[1:13:18] and sometimes we probably get feeling
[1:13:19] the same way Lord our
[1:13:21] seems like it's taken forever
[1:13:24] it's amazing how
[1:13:26] how some things just seem to take
[1:13:27] forever when you're younger but the
[1:13:29] older you get you're like wow that's
[1:13:31] here again already it's already gone
[1:13:32] through so fast it seems like time just
[1:13:35] seems to speed up
[1:13:36] talking to a young man and he told me he
[1:13:39] says
[1:13:40] I'm going to be 40 this year and he says
[1:13:42] and it's going to be
[1:13:44] starting downhill
[1:13:47] and I I just wanted to make him feel
[1:13:49] good you know and I said no you're at
[1:13:50] the bottom of the hill already watching
[1:13:52] others tumble
[1:13:53] and he said thanks a lot
[1:13:56] well he's about 50 now and he says
[1:13:58] you're not kidding were you
[1:13:59] I said life seems to speed up as time
[1:14:02] goes on things you know
[1:14:04] but Paul says I would not have you be
[1:14:06] ignorant brethren
[1:14:08] concerning them which are asleep that
[1:14:11] yeast sorrow not even as others which
[1:14:14] have no hope
[1:14:18] great is thy faithful faithfulness your
[1:14:21] father
[1:14:22] you you it's not just words in a book
[1:14:26] but a reality an experience that we each
[1:14:29] have that we get
[1:14:31] that we get to grow up with that we get
[1:14:33] to to get to know him a faithful God
[1:14:38] uh Abby my daughter the other day or
[1:14:40] yesterday I get was sent a text to the
[1:14:43] family
[1:14:45] they're they're
[1:14:47] adding the second portion to their house
[1:14:49] and working on it and Amos had ordered a
[1:14:52] box of screws the specific screws for
[1:14:55] that portion of the job and then
[1:14:57] couldn't find them
[1:14:59] and they had to be ordered so it post
[1:15:01] that ordered again the cost and the time
[1:15:05] so she just sent a text out he said
[1:15:07] would you pray that we find it
[1:15:11] and we did
[1:15:12] and when someone when someone sends out
[1:15:14] a request take a moment to pray then
[1:15:17] just just you never know maybe he'll
[1:15:20] Touch the Hem of His Garment for
[1:15:22] somebody
[1:15:24] so we prayed in a couple little bit
[1:15:26] later she said we had gone and we had
[1:15:28] searched we had looked
[1:15:30] and we walked around and the place we
[1:15:32] had looked when you said them they were
[1:15:34] not there and when we bat went back that
[1:15:36] box was right there
[1:15:39] God is more than able if he will do that
[1:15:43] for a simple thing like that and what
[1:15:45] would he do for one of his children
[1:15:48] the hope that we have that lies within
[1:15:51] us
[1:15:51] Paul says I don't want you to be
[1:15:53] ignorant I want you to know this I want
[1:15:55] you to be aware of this he says
[1:15:58] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:16:01] rose again and every evidence of that
[1:16:03] happening is here
[1:16:05] he says
[1:16:07] even sow them which sleep in Jesus will
[1:16:10] God bring with him
[1:16:14] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:16:16] the Lord in what can be more sure there
[1:16:19] is nothing more sure than the word of
[1:16:21] God
[1:16:23] you can hang your Eternal destination on
[1:16:26] the word of God
[1:16:28] he says
[1:16:32] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:16:35] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:16:38] them which are asleep
[1:16:41] and he says they're not dead they're
[1:16:43] asleep
[1:16:44] they're resting
[1:16:46] and you know
[1:16:48] it if God and we're talking about him
[1:16:51] and my wife coming in just a little bit
[1:16:53] today and the creation with Adam being
[1:16:56] created and Eve being taken from his
[1:16:59] side and and all you know as you start
[1:17:02] to think about those things and
[1:17:05] you begin to imagine we have the
[1:17:07] scripture we've heard Brothers preach
[1:17:08] what brother Brown said but but
[1:17:09] sometimes you're just being what was it
[1:17:11] like
[1:17:12] how long was that time Adam Adam didn't
[1:17:15] have to attend the uh you know attend
[1:17:18] the soil in the way he had to after and
[1:17:19] all that went on you know brother
[1:17:21] Branham talks about he would say uh Abel
[1:17:24] Adam he says you know can you change the
[1:17:26] breathe breathe and bring it this way
[1:17:28] it's a little bit different now it's
[1:17:30] honey I
[1:17:32] turn the air conditioner a little then
[1:17:35] cool down the room and she said no it's
[1:17:36] too cold already or right now she's like
[1:17:38] turned that heater off and I say I'm
[1:17:40] freezing you know
[1:17:42] and and but Adam could just say Breeze
[1:17:44] turn and go the other way
[1:17:47] kind of hard to believe that sometimes
[1:17:50] but they were poor they were a creation
[1:17:52] of God
[1:17:53] and there was no sin no iniquity and no
[1:17:55] nothing their word was as good as his
[1:17:58] works God had told Adam you go through
[1:18:00] and you name all the animals and he
[1:18:02] named them to their character you name
[1:18:04] the the plants the trees and everything
[1:18:06] it was such a Harmony there
[1:18:10] and you got this same promise that as we
[1:18:12] look into the Crypt them
[1:18:15] those are a living will not prevent will
[1:18:18] not will not hold it up it says them
[1:18:20] which are asleep because that's all they
[1:18:22] are sleeping waiting for that call
[1:18:26] he says but I like this then we which
[1:18:29] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:18:31] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:18:34] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[1:18:37] be with the Lord
[1:18:40] I pray that that's a hope that's a
[1:18:42] reality that's a revelation in your life
[1:18:46] and you say well Lord you know I I've
[1:18:50] just not done all that good I've got
[1:18:52] some things in my life
[1:18:55] I would say fix it
[1:18:58] I would say repent of it I would say
[1:19:00] make it right don't let nothing get in
[1:19:03] your way
[1:19:05] we've done you know we've made plans and
[1:19:08] we're going to do this we're going to go
[1:19:09] that and sometimes those plans started a
[1:19:12] year or two ago a while back
[1:19:14] sometimes the plans are five minutes
[1:19:16] before it happens but some things and
[1:19:19] you make all all the the preparations
[1:19:21] for it
[1:19:22] maybe you're going to go on a trip and
[1:19:24] you you make the uh
[1:19:26] you get out you make reservations and
[1:19:28] you start setting some finances aside
[1:19:30] and you start making preparations for
[1:19:32] all of that
[1:19:33] with a hope that when that time comes
[1:19:36] that day comes you're going to be ready
[1:19:38] to go and you're going to be able to go
[1:19:41] and I don't know about you but when I
[1:19:43] know I'm leaving early early the next
[1:19:45] morning I have a hard time sleeping
[1:19:47] until about an hour before it's time to
[1:19:49] go
[1:19:49] then I fall asleep and then it's time to
[1:19:51] get up
[1:19:53] and there are some people that can lay
[1:19:54] down and sleep and get up when it's time
[1:19:56] to go every one of the different but
[1:19:58] there's something that says we shall
[1:20:00] meet him in the air
[1:20:02] there shall there will be a resurrection
[1:20:04] there's evidence of the Resurrection
[1:20:08] and then Paul finishes it wherefore
[1:20:10] Comfort one another with these words
[1:20:15] it won't be long now
[1:20:17] it won't be long now
[1:20:20] you know brother Banner makes a
[1:20:21] statement he says
[1:20:23] live like he's coming today
[1:20:28] your life should be ready if he should
[1:20:31] call you at any moment
[1:20:33] ready to go
[1:20:35] but he said plan like he's not coming
[1:20:37] for a hundred years
[1:20:40] I find people flip that
[1:20:43] they live like he's not coming for a
[1:20:46] hundred years but playing like he's
[1:20:47] coming today
[1:20:49] and I saw that happen 1977.
[1:20:53] those had put their whole Hope on that
[1:20:56] and when it didn't happen
[1:20:58] watched how they faded away their lives
[1:21:01] they quit working they quit going to
[1:21:03] school they did a lot of things
[1:21:05] and life was tough after that
[1:21:07] but if we'll take What God Says for us
[1:21:09] to do
[1:21:10] and believe it
[1:21:12] and live by that God will see us get
[1:21:15] through that part
[1:21:17] where for Comfort one another with these
[1:21:20] words he's coming soon
[1:21:23] there's more fulfilled in the word of
[1:21:25] God today than there ever had been
[1:21:28] more things that we see the falling away
[1:21:31] the the filth of the world what what
[1:21:34] what Adam what Abraham was crying out
[1:21:36] for salvation because of what was going
[1:21:38] on in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:21:41] and there was something God said I'm
[1:21:42] coming down to destroy
[1:21:45] and Adam Abraham's crying out because he
[1:21:48] knew who was there he had a nephew down
[1:21:50] there and he was calling out for that
[1:21:52] one
[1:21:53] but there's going to come that day when
[1:21:55] this is that day
[1:21:57] and maybe every morning just a thought
[1:22:00] every morning now
[1:22:02] could this be Resurrection morning
[1:22:06] could this be that day
[1:22:09] it would change how we live
[1:22:12] it would change our thoughts
[1:22:15] it would take some of that gloom and
[1:22:17] that that heartache and that that
[1:22:19] frustration
[1:22:21] and say Lord this could be that day
[1:22:24] this could be that day we're going home
[1:22:27] this could be David I'll be changed from
[1:22:30] Mortal to immortal
[1:22:32] what a day that'll be
[1:22:35] some of you young people may think and
[1:22:37] brother and you've lived your life
[1:22:38] already
[1:22:39] you've had the opportunity to to do
[1:22:42] things and see things Mary and have a
[1:22:45] family and all yes I have by the grace
[1:22:47] of God
[1:22:49] but this is greater than any of that
[1:22:54] it is
[1:22:58] brother Branham says in
[1:23:01] my life story in 1959
[1:23:05] I gave him that quote
[1:23:07] and here he was and he's talking to his
[1:23:10] sister
[1:23:11] hope there and I looked over and shook
[1:23:14] her there she was she had went down from
[1:23:17] about 120 pounds to about 60. and that
[1:23:20] shook her and if I live to be a hundred
[1:23:22] years old I'll never forget what
[1:23:24] happened
[1:23:25] she turned over in those great big
[1:23:27] pretty eyes looked up at me and she
[1:23:28] smiled she said why did you call me back
[1:23:34] I'll tell you on that side
[1:23:37] you're never going to want to come back
[1:23:39] to this life again
[1:23:43] but while I'm in yet in this life I want
[1:23:45] to reach out and grab somebody by the
[1:23:47] hand and say come go with me
[1:23:50] he says
[1:23:51] I said honey I just
[1:23:54] got the cast I just had to work and it
[1:23:56] was not was we was way in debt and a
[1:23:58] hundred hundreds of dollars of doctor
[1:24:00] bills and nothing to pay it with and I
[1:24:02] just had to work and I seen her two or
[1:24:04] three times a day and every night and
[1:24:06] then when she was in that condition
[1:24:08] and I said what do you mean call you
[1:24:10] back she said
[1:24:11] now watch this bill you preached about
[1:24:14] it
[1:24:15] you talked about it
[1:24:18] but you don't have any idea what it is
[1:24:22] we've waited for a long time
[1:24:25] some are just starting their Journey
[1:24:26] some have been at a journey for quite
[1:24:28] some time now
[1:24:31] and God has allowed us to have some
[1:24:33] glimpse of some blessing some some touch
[1:24:34] some experiences in life that tell us
[1:24:37] he's so real
[1:24:40] but he tells her he says what are you
[1:24:42] talking about she said Heaven she said
[1:24:44] look I was being escorted by some
[1:24:47] peoples men or women or something they
[1:24:50] were dressed in white and she said I was
[1:24:53] at ease and peace
[1:24:55] big pretty birds flying from tree to
[1:24:58] tree she said don't think I'm beside
[1:25:01] myself
[1:25:05] she says it's real
[1:25:08] it's for sure
[1:25:09] it's yes and amen it's eternal
[1:25:13] she says I'm not beside myself I was on
[1:25:17] that side
[1:25:20] brother Branham said you know he
[1:25:21] continues there and he talks about that
[1:25:25] the the memories
[1:25:27] and and things of of all that happened
[1:25:32] but she was a witness
[1:25:35] of the truth of that
[1:25:38] just sharing some experiences about it
[1:25:41] my dad had a good friend and I remember
[1:25:43] him as we were young people in the
[1:25:46] church he was older than my father but
[1:25:48] he was a Christian
[1:25:51] and um
[1:25:52] in the church that we went to and when
[1:25:54] we were just children young children
[1:25:57] when those people they were part of the
[1:26:00] original Pentecostal group way back
[1:26:03] when they would have prayer meetings in
[1:26:05] their Church they'd call the fire
[1:26:06] department because the church was on
[1:26:07] fire and the fire department got there
[1:26:09] and it wouldn't be on fire would just be
[1:26:11] the Holy Spirit outside the church going
[1:26:13] up and down
[1:26:15] those were testimonies about people like
[1:26:17] that it was real it's still real
[1:26:20] amen
[1:26:22] and and it was a good friend of my dad's
[1:26:25] and the brother Aguilar can show I
[1:26:28] believe his name
[1:26:29] and he had in the early 60s he had heard
[1:26:33] brother Branham preach he had gone to
[1:26:35] the meeting
[1:26:37] and um
[1:26:39] he had come back and told my dad he was
[1:26:41] older my father he said I've never heard
[1:26:44] that was a man of God I've never heard
[1:26:46] anything or seen anything like that
[1:26:48] yet they had been raised in the
[1:26:50] Pentecost church that still had the
[1:26:52] power of God in it
[1:26:54] and so
[1:26:56] we come into the message later
[1:26:59] a few years later than that and um
[1:27:04] my dad says I'm going to take the tape
[1:27:06] to him so he could hear it to see if
[1:27:08] this who that was
[1:27:10] so my dad takes it over to his house and
[1:27:12] they play the tape and he begins to cry
[1:27:14] that's him that's him that's him I'll
[1:27:16] never forget the voice that was the man
[1:27:18] of God
[1:27:20] so my dad says oh right I'm gonna be
[1:27:22] able to give him the message and he's
[1:27:23] going to hear he's going to believe it
[1:27:25] and he passes it away right after that
[1:27:28] so my dad asked the Lord why why
[1:27:30] couldn't I give him the message
[1:27:33] show my dad is a man who who sees
[1:27:35] visions and dreams
[1:27:38] and he said the Lord showed his friend
[1:27:40] can show
[1:27:41] being taken by two angels dressed in
[1:27:44] white he just waved to my dad and said
[1:27:46] I'm going home now
[1:27:48] that's a reality
[1:27:51] it's not a fantasy it's not a it's not
[1:27:53] just for the the ones in the Bible
[1:27:56] it's for every child of God
[1:27:59] it's for everyone you say well but I've
[1:28:01] made I made a mess in my life I've done
[1:28:04] so much wrong I've been a failure look
[1:28:05] at me look at this
[1:28:07] it don't take but an instant
[1:28:09] I'm just saying Lord I'm sorry and he
[1:28:12] forgives you
[1:28:14] he looked at Legion a man of thousands
[1:28:17] of music and he delivered him and what
[1:28:19] if that man he came to him and says his
[1:28:21] senses and gave his heart to God
[1:28:23] okay Lord told me okay now you go to
[1:28:25] Seminary you study for the next 25 years
[1:28:28] and you get to know all the scriptures
[1:28:29] and you get to know where everything's
[1:28:30] at and understand all the Mysteries then
[1:28:32] come talk to me again no no
[1:28:35] when God comes into a man's life a
[1:28:37] lady's life it changes them
[1:28:40] God is more than able
[1:28:43] in the message a rejected King
[1:28:47] we'll finish with this here
[1:28:49] in fact if the musicians want to come up
[1:28:53] and so I heard something say would you
[1:28:55] like to see beyond the curtain
[1:28:57] and I said it would help me so much
[1:29:02] wouldn't it wouldn't it be something
[1:29:03] just to be able to step into that that
[1:29:06] Dimension that atmosphere just for a
[1:29:07] little while
[1:29:09] he says and I looked and in just a
[1:29:11] moment one breath I had come into a
[1:29:13] little place that slanted I looked back
[1:29:16] and there I was laying on the bed and I
[1:29:18] said this is a strange thing
[1:29:21] now I would what would not want you to
[1:29:24] repeat this this is before my church or
[1:29:26] my sheep that I'm pastoring he said
[1:29:28] whether whether it was I was in this
[1:29:31] body or not whether it was a translation
[1:29:33] it wasn't like any Vision I ever had and
[1:29:36] I could look there and I could look
[1:29:37] there here
[1:29:39] and when when I hit that little place
[1:29:41] I'd never seen so many people come
[1:29:43] running screaming oh our precious
[1:29:46] brother and I looked a young woman maybe
[1:29:48] in their early 20s 18 to 20 and they
[1:29:51] were throwing their arms around me and
[1:29:52] screaming our precious brother
[1:29:54] Here Comes young men in the Brilliance
[1:29:56] of Young Manhood and their eyes
[1:29:58] glistening looking like stars on a
[1:30:00] darkened night
[1:30:02] their teeth as white as Pearl and they
[1:30:04] were screaming and grabbing me and
[1:30:05] screaming oh our precious brother and I
[1:30:08] stopped and look and I was young I
[1:30:10] looked back my old body laying there and
[1:30:13] my hand it's behind my head and I said I
[1:30:16] don't understand this
[1:30:20] it's real
[1:30:23] one more testimony these are personal
[1:30:25] for us
[1:30:27] when my sister my older sister
[1:30:30] my mom was in the hospital
[1:30:32] and had my sister
[1:30:35] my mom was diagnosed with tuberculosis
[1:30:39] and there this would be in the mid 50s
[1:30:41] my sisters were born my sister was born
[1:30:43] in 57.
[1:30:45] and tuberculosis was was a a disease
[1:30:48] that killed people
[1:30:51] and dad would work
[1:30:53] and then he'd come home and he'd go see
[1:30:55] her at the hospital
[1:30:57] so he came home to pray that day before
[1:30:59] he went to go see Mom and
[1:31:02] um
[1:31:03] he was in his body praying
[1:31:06] and suddenly he was lifted up out of his
[1:31:08] body and I remember that because that's
[1:31:09] how he tells us about it
[1:31:11] he lifted up a lot of his body and he
[1:31:13] could see himself still kneeling down
[1:31:15] praying
[1:31:16] and then that light took him to the
[1:31:19] hospital
[1:31:20] but took him down the same roads he
[1:31:22] drove
[1:31:23] took him quickly
[1:31:25] and they left him outside the hospital
[1:31:27] and the light went into the room he said
[1:31:29] I knew which was your mother's room
[1:31:31] I saw the light go into that room and
[1:31:34] then I fell back down into my body
[1:31:38] he said when I get to the hospital the
[1:31:40] doctors told me we don't know what
[1:31:41] happened but she doesn't have
[1:31:42] tuberculosis anymore
[1:31:45] he's still God
[1:31:48] he never fails
[1:31:49] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:31:52] forever
[1:31:54] and it could be Resurrection morning
[1:31:58] it won't be long now

[2:03:21] face him as your king
[2:03:26] and Jesus the light of the world
[2:03:35] and then the pills of heaven will ring
[2:03:44] Jesus the light of the world
[2:03:51] over walking
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:04:02] to Drums of Mercy in your mind and shine
[2:04:10] all around us
[2:04:12] [Music]
[2:04:17] Jesus the light of the world
[2:04:26] let
[2:04:28] it
[2:04:32] was a tiny simple stable
[2:04:41] hardly a place
[2:04:44] for a king to be born
[2:04:48] I'll just stay special to reveal his
[2:04:53] majesty
[2:04:54] so I know if I'll give him control he'll
[2:04:59] be born in me and then
[2:05:07] [Music]
[2:05:17] live inside this house
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:35] well outwardly I'm nothing not much to
[2:05:40] behold
[2:05:42] hardly a place for his word to unfold
[2:05:48] but if I'll just yield this vessel and
[2:05:52] let him have his way from glory to glory
[2:05:58] he'll change me day by day when your
[2:06:04] word be born in the manger of my heart
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:17] in this house
[2:06:20] [Music]
[2:06:33] God bless you Saints
[2:06:38] we tallied the votes in the house is
[2:06:41] pretty closely divided
[2:06:47] brother Aaron received 44 percent of the
[2:06:50] vote
[2:06:51] and to continue
[2:06:53] 56 point of the vote
[2:06:56] so the congregation has spoken that
[2:06:58] they'd like to continue
[2:07:01] seeking for seeking another brother for
[2:07:04] the position and basically voted no for
[2:07:07] brother Aaron so brother Aaron would you
[2:07:10] like to come up and say something
[2:07:13] I know this is uh it's hard
[2:07:16] but
[2:07:17] it's been a long road and
[2:07:20] I'd like to thank brother Aaron his
[2:07:22] family
[2:07:31] it's not an easy thing to stand up here
[2:07:33] and give the the results and I'd like to
[2:07:43] foreign
[2:07:48] I'd like to personally thank you
[2:07:53] when brother green died or went home
[2:07:55] should I say
[2:07:58] this brother is the one that stepped in
[2:08:00] when no one else would
[2:08:03] carried a load for the last seven years
[2:08:07] it's not been easy on brother Aaron
[2:08:09] he's not getting any younger as he
[2:08:12] mentioned this morning
[2:08:15] but we owe him a debt of gratitude
[2:08:19] and he's one of the finest Brothers I
[2:08:21] know
[2:08:22] and thank you brother Aaron
[2:08:24] I know it's not easy to share this but I
[2:08:27] I truly truly appreciate you and your
[2:08:30] family for all that you've done
[2:08:41] or they had said I could say something
[2:08:43] so something
[2:08:49] then
[2:08:51] it's been a fun seven years in one size
[2:08:53] and side has been a hard seven years but
[2:08:57] on all things God has had his his will
[2:08:59] done
[2:09:01] appreciate your prayers I appreciate
[2:09:03] your support
[2:09:05] it's um
[2:09:08] something that I never imagined would I
[2:09:10] would ever do
[2:09:11] but
[2:09:12] thank the Lord that he has allowed it
[2:09:16] the other day we just we got to thinking
[2:09:18] and remembering back when we first came
[2:09:20] I was
[2:09:22] 29 years old when we got to the
[2:09:24] Tabernacle
[2:09:25] just a young man
[2:09:28] and it didn't take long for for to get
[2:09:30] just get started in doing things in the
[2:09:32] church here
[2:09:34] appreciate your prayers appreciate your
[2:09:37] all that you have done for us in
[2:09:40] I know at times I've failed and this
[2:09:42] never was my intention to fail anybody
[2:09:44] or hurt anybody but we're human
[2:09:47] and I've I've said this and I'll
[2:09:49] continue to say this this is my home
[2:09:50] Church
[2:09:52] unless God tells me to go somewhere else
[2:09:54] and he hasn't said that so I will
[2:09:57] continue to put my shoulder to the wheel
[2:09:58] as best I can
[2:10:01] and whatever that amount of time takes
[2:10:04] to get to who the Lord would send our
[2:10:08] way
[2:10:09] whether it's somebody local or somebody
[2:10:11] you know it I'll put my shoulder the
[2:10:13] wheel and I'll ask each one of you to
[2:10:14] put your shoulder to the wheel also
[2:10:16] in your prayer and your support and your
[2:10:19] attendance and everything else
[2:10:21] and see what God has for us
[2:10:23] I
[2:10:25] I've been asked by others if I would go
[2:10:28] out and minister
[2:10:30] and from other other folks in other
[2:10:32] places if I would go Minister for them
[2:10:34] and I always said this is home I don't
[2:10:35] feel that way and I still don't feel
[2:10:37] that way but if
[2:10:38] God allows that maybe we'll do make up a
[2:10:41] few that we had said we would and we
[2:10:42] never did
[2:10:44] but this is home
[2:10:46] this is where my heart is
[2:10:48] and I want to be here when we all go
[2:10:50] home together so
[2:10:52] keep us in prayer it'll take some
[2:10:54] adjustment but I'll help every way I can
[2:10:56] to get to that next stage
[2:10:59] and I'll still pray for you he promised
[2:11:03] to pray for me
[2:11:05] I appreciate that
[2:11:07] and uh
[2:11:08] one side of me just went okay
[2:11:12] but that's all right
[2:11:14] and I I didn't tell anybody but I told
[2:11:17] my boss and my job I said
[2:11:20] I don't know what's going to happen but
[2:11:22] if if this position demands more time
[2:11:24] I'll be able to spend less time at work
[2:11:27] or I'll want to spend less time at work
[2:11:30] let's just be honest with that
[2:11:32] so Friday they called me and said what
[2:11:35] can we do to keep you
[2:11:38] and I said we'll talk about that later
[2:11:41] and as long as the Lord wants us to be
[2:11:44] here and do what we can do we're willing
[2:11:46] to do that so I'll say to each one of
[2:11:48] you thank you
[2:11:49] thank you for your prayers thank you for
[2:11:51] your kindness
[2:11:52] thank you for putting up with me
[2:11:55] but I pray one of these days where I'll
