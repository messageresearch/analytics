[30:46] this morning um I'm uh excited the uh I
[30:50] want to make an announcement if in case
[30:52] I forget the kids' rooms closed uh for
[30:55] another another day today because uh
[30:58] we're getting some flooring in we've got
[31:00] everything all piled up but it looks
[31:02] really good we got new flooring going in
[31:04] in the U in the lower rooms and I think
[31:07] it's going to be a real blessing to the
[31:08] kids the things that always stress me
[31:09] out I'd walk in there we'd clean the
[31:11] floor and there's black marks on the
[31:14] floor from the shoes and oh it's like
[31:17] but hopefully this new floor will will
[31:19] prevent that or you're going to have to
[31:20] check your shoes in at the
[31:23] door I can't handle
[31:26] it but uh it's it's all for the kids you
[31:30] know and it's it's it's for children of
[31:32] God and and we uh we talked about a
[31:35] couple weeks ago we talked about MDC and
[31:38] and that theophany body that's over on
[31:40] the other side and Jesus warned us he
[31:44] said be careful how you treat even these
[31:46] little kids because their angels are now
[31:51] beholding the face of God right at that
[31:55] moment so we always have to be careful
[31:57] and always respect to everybody even to
[31:58] the little kids have the utmost respect
[32:01] for them if you treat the kids with
[32:03] respect then you'll see that they'll be
[32:05] treating you in respect also we um we do
[32:09] we it's it's a great honor it's great
[32:11] it's really exciting I can't wait till
[32:13] we get done it I um I was born with a
[32:16] birth defect I didn't have any patience
[32:19] and and I still don't have any and and
[32:21] the Lord's working on me and but I just
[32:24] I can't wait for it to get done it's
[32:27] it's exciting it's going to be beautiful
[32:30] um and then once we finish in there then
[32:33] if the Lord's willing we'll move into
[32:35] this area we're also going to start on
[32:36] some landscaping and like I said a
[32:39] couple weeks ago I want to have a church
[32:40] meeting and uh just go over everything
[32:42] with the church just fill everybody in I
[32:45] think um everybody's going to be happy I
[32:46] think you'll enjoy um in the future when
[32:50] we when we get finished I um got a text
[32:55] this morning and um was reading reading
[32:58] in the news and uh about the Olympics
[33:02] going on over in France and uh the
[33:07] mockery that
[33:10] came from uh the the Olympic Committee
[33:14] and and what they scheduled in the
[33:15] Olympics to to start out the Olympics um
[33:19] on how they had a mockery of the Lord's
[33:23] Supper The Last Supper and they had
[33:27] instead of disciples and Jesus they had
[33:30] drag
[33:32] queens representing our Lord and the
[33:36] disciples that were
[33:38] there and it was it was a shame it was
[33:41] it was awful and as I started
[33:45] reading I said my goodness how could
[33:49] this how could this be it's something so
[33:52] big and something so worldwide as the
[33:54] Olympics and as I as I read they had
[33:58] drag queens carrying the torch the
[34:01] Olympic torch going to to light what
[34:04] they call the Eternal Flame it's not an
[34:06] eternal flame that Flame's going to go
[34:09] out and there's going to be a last
[34:11] supper one day and there's going to be a
[34:12] last supper for all of us and we better
[34:13] be right before before that last supper
[34:16] comes because then we'll have to go and
[34:19] we'll have to meet our Lord and
[34:22] savior I was I was sickened really by it
[34:25] so as as I read the article they
[34:28] interviewed whoever was in charge of
[34:31] representing those people that were in
[34:33] the um that did the parody of the Lord's
[34:35] supper and the man said he says we
[34:38] didn't go far enough he said the French
[34:40] government and the French
[34:41] Representatives didn't go far enough in
[34:43] doing
[34:45] this he said that the French
[34:48] people they don't it's not as accepted
[34:52] in their lives as this would have you
[34:55] have have you to believe and it's just
[34:58] it's the workings of the enemy to try to
[35:02] put this stuff in our face all the time
[35:05] and then eventually we get so used to it
[35:08] that it it becomes okay and then we just
[35:11] look past it it's like the the the the
[35:14] old story of putting a a frog in a pot
[35:18] of boiling water he'll start squirming
[35:20] and jump out but if you put him in there
[35:22] and you start to boil the water slowly
[35:24] he'll just stay in there and cook and
[35:27] that's what the world what's happening
[35:28] to the world today we just sit there and
[35:30] we just relax and all it's okay and more
[35:34] and more and more it happens and you
[35:39] know me I'm not against anybody and I'm
[35:42] not against if someone has that weakness
[35:45] in their
[35:47] life then okay that's fine I have seen
[35:52] people that were born that way that
[35:57] absolutely I could have I could see it
[35:59] when they were babies and all the way up
[36:01] until now and then I have seen now we
[36:04] see
[36:06] people that are being made that way
[36:10] because it makes everything
[36:12] accepted and and they get accepted from
[36:15] this group and now it's starting to be
[36:17] the trending thing to be that way
[36:21] brothers and sisters let me tell you
[36:22] it's a sin it is an absolute sin it's
[36:25] taught in this Bible it's a sin they say
[36:27] it's not in this Bible Jesus said in
[36:29] Matthew chapter 19 that a man and a
[36:31] woman are married and he doesn't say
[36:34] anything else about anything and he
[36:36] shouldn't have had to for heaven's sakes
[36:39] just common sense will tell us
[36:41] that but let me tell you that I
[36:45] understand that some people are born
[36:48] that way I don't question that I was
[36:51] born a
[36:53] sinner me the guy standing up here I was
[36:57] born with
[36:58] weaknesses that I had to overcome in my
[37:01] life that I am still overcoming so why
[37:04] does if you're born a liar or if you're
[37:06] born a cheater or if you're born
[37:08] something else that you have to overcome
[37:10] that but they don't have to overcome
[37:11] this I don't get
[37:13] it and then they press it upon the world
[37:17] it's a
[37:19] sign it's a sign of what is
[37:22] is about to happen and these signs have
[37:26] have come come along and over and over
[37:29] and over throughout history and God has
[37:31] done the same thing over and over
[37:33] throughout history they came here with
[37:34] Adam and
[37:35] Eve they had they had impurity there
[37:38] they had sin there they ended up God
[37:42] destroying it with Noah violence spread
[37:46] across the Earth God destroyed it with
[37:50] Sodom and Gora it was a prosperous time
[37:54] there were rich cities
[37:58] God destroyed those over and over and
[38:01] there's many many times in the Bible I
[38:02] mean the Tower of Babel same thing they
[38:05] got so educated and so powerful God
[38:08] destroyed that it's whenever we take our
[38:11] mind off of Jesus take our mind off of
[38:14] God and put it on something
[38:16] else that God's justice takes
[38:21] hold um I did want to read something
[38:25] this today just it got me all worked up
[38:30] and uh and not like I said not against
[38:33] the people if you have a weakness there
[38:36] overcome it I have weaknesses too I try
[38:40] to overcome them every day no we don't
[38:42] have to accept that because it's sin we
[38:45] do not have to accept that because it is
[38:50] sin amen just like we don't accept any
[38:52] other
[38:53] sin Galatians 6 verse 6 I'll read the
[38:57] new New King James Version if you could
[38:58] put up the the King James it says this
[39:01] let him who is
[39:03] taught the word share in all good things
[39:07] with him who teaches be not deceived God
[39:10] is Not mocked which is exactly what they
[39:13] were doing God is Not mocked for
[39:16] whatever a man SWS that will he also
[39:18] reap for He Who SWS to his flesh will of
[39:22] the flesh reap
[39:24] corruption but he who SWS of the spirit
[39:27] will of the spirit reap everlasting
[39:31] life and let us not grow weary of while
[39:34] doing good for in due season we shall
[39:37] reap if we do not lose heart therefore
[39:40] as we have opportunity let us do good to
[39:43] all especially to those who are of the
[39:45] household of faith so brother Manny you
[39:49] get to
[39:51] prefer the you get to prefer the
[39:53] Christians a little bit more it says it
[39:55] here but but still we reach out out to
[39:58] all
[39:59] people and I'll add this that if you are
[40:06] complacent in people mocking
[40:09] God if you don't stand up against it
[40:12] then you are also guilty of
[40:14] it I know that that's we might just turn
[40:17] our heads but me standing in this Pulpit
[40:21] it's my job to condemn
[40:24] sin and if I just look by it and I will
[40:27] be guilty of that same
[40:30] sin that's that's part of the word it's
[40:33] part of being a Christian now you don't
[40:35] attack a Christian never attacks you
[40:38] don't go after someone and and talk
[40:40] about and and run someone down because
[40:43] you might not struggle with that sin
[40:45] that they have but you don't condone it
[40:49] you don't say oh it's okay it is not
[40:52] okay and I'm not just talking about the
[40:54] drag queens and homosexuality I'm
[40:56] talking about lying and cheating and
[40:58] gossiping and and all of these other
[41:00] things we don't condone those things if
[41:05] they are a Sin then there a sin no
[41:08] matter
[41:10] what these have been
[41:14] times in just the past 20 30 years these
[41:17] have been times of unprecedented
[41:20] prosperity in the
[41:21] world the world has money we all might
[41:26] think that oh we're taxed too high or we
[41:29] don't have enough or or we want more but
[41:32] these have been very very good
[41:34] times people aren't going
[41:37] hungry here in the United States and in
[41:39] most places of the world people are
[41:41] generally very
[41:43] prosperous but look what Prosperity
[41:46] produces brothers and sisters it
[41:49] produces
[41:50] sin it produces it it it it makes it too
[41:55] easy to where we are not crying out out
[41:57] to God but then hardships and
[42:04] suffering then that produces
[42:07] repentance because it makes us more
[42:10] reliant on God so we see that that and
[42:15] I'm talking in general senses you know
[42:18] I'm not I'm not saying if if we're not
[42:21] if we're prosperous that that there's
[42:23] going to be sin in our lives I'm not
[42:24] saying that but I'm saying that in in
[42:27] general times of prosperity have turned
[42:32] our way our eyes away from God and it's
[42:34] the times of suffering and those times
[42:38] according to the Bible they're coming
[42:40] and I I feel I feel bad I feel bad that
[42:44] that we have taken these things and
[42:49] and really forsaken God and made it to
[42:53] where that Lord you're not as important
[42:57] to us and and not just I'm not talking
[43:00] about the people in our church I'm
[43:01] talking about this whole
[43:03] world and to allow something like this
[43:06] that I just mentioned it's just it's not
[43:09] right and to support it it's not right
[43:14] and the Bible says that we're going to
[43:18] reap what we
[43:19] saw and I just pray Lord and know that
[43:23] we want the Lord to come and we look
[43:25] forward to that day
[43:28] but I also pray that many many people
[43:31] will come to the Lord before that time
[43:34] maybe by my witness maybe maybe by your
[43:36] witness the love of God and many people
[43:40] that may be mocking God now always be
[43:43] kind to them always have a reach out a
[43:47] hand of love not to condone what they're
[43:49] doing but to help them and then you
[43:52] might see that you might win a soul to
[43:56] Jesus Christ and what greater honor
[43:58] could we have on Earth than to win a
[44:00] soul to Jesus Christ I always I always
[44:03] wondered why that John the Baptist was
[44:05] the greatest of the Jesus said he was
[44:08] the greatest of all the prophets why did
[44:10] he say that it's because he was the
[44:13] first Christian and he had the first
[44:15] converts to
[44:17] Christ of course he was the greatest
[44:20] because he was by his witness at least
[44:22] John and Andrew they came to the Lord so
[44:26] if he was the greatest witness then we
[44:29] also have that opportunity to lift up
[44:33] Jesus Christ to the
[44:34] world and to be that
[44:37] witness we um go on through the Hebrew
[44:41] series and it's much of it is repetitive
[44:48] is repeating back to what was said
[44:50] earlier and so we're going to start in
[44:54] Hebrews 9 and I I want to just I sent
[44:57] some pictures to the to the brothers
[44:59] back there and what I would like to do
[45:01] is I'd like to explain some of these
[45:03] things that are constantly referred to
[45:05] in the book of Hebrews which is the high
[45:08] priest and how the high priest went into
[45:10] the Tabernacle of the Lord and the holy
[45:12] place and and how the the high priest
[45:15] went into that holy of holies once a
[45:18] year and then inside that holy of holies
[45:23] is the the Ark of the Covenant so
[45:26] brother if you could put up that first
[45:27] picture this is a picture of this is
[45:30] just a general picture of what the
[45:31] Tabernacle in the wilderness look like
[45:34] you can see that pillar of cloud that
[45:38] pillar of smoke in the back and that is
[45:41] probably representative of of the the
[45:43] spirit of the Lord coming down into that
[45:45] holy of holies that you can see there
[45:49] that on the outside you can see the wall
[45:52] and you can see the the different places
[45:54] of worship in there and of sacrifice and
[45:57] if if you go to the next
[46:00] slide here is just a general diagram of
[46:04] what we just saw so at the front you
[46:07] have the altar of the burnt offerings
[46:08] that's where they would make the the U
[46:11] the offering for the people and then you
[46:13] have the bronze Laver where where they
[46:15] would do their ceremonial Washings and
[46:17] then the golden lampstands which we know
[46:19] is the manora there and then the table
[46:22] of the shoe bread the altar of incense
[46:24] and as you go left you get more Hol holy
[46:27] and then the Ark of the Covenant there
[46:30] in the back behind a thick curtain in a
[46:32] small room the Ark of the Covenant if
[46:35] you go to the next
[46:36] slide just a simple Box overlaid in
[46:41] Gold small not very big inside of it
[46:47] were the
[46:50] um it was a a basin a
[46:54] bowl that had Mana in it
[46:57] and in that bowl that Mana remember if
[47:00] it wasn't kept if it was kept over a day
[47:02] that had spoiled but the Mana that was
[47:04] put in this Ark never spoiled and then
[47:07] when a priest became a priest
[47:11] that he would take a piece of that mana
[47:15] and and taste it for years and years
[47:19] after that so there's that bowl that has
[47:21] the Mana in it and then there was the
[47:24] Aaron's Rod that bued and bore olives or
[47:29] bore I'm sorry bore almonds and then
[47:32] there were the Ten Commandments the two
[47:34] tables of stone that were inside of that
[47:37] box right there so that is back into the
[47:40] holy of holies I just as as we go
[47:43] through the book of Hebrews and as we've
[47:44] gone through I want you to kind of get a
[47:46] picture of what this is It's a tent
[47:49] that's portable that's moved in the
[47:50] wilderness and then later on that tent
[47:54] became a temple remember David wanted to
[47:57] build the temple and he said and the
[48:00] Lord said no but your son Solomon can
[48:02] build that Temple so then Solomon built
[48:07] this permanent structure for the Lord
[48:10] and called it the house of the Lord if
[48:12] you go to the next slide there and that
[48:15] was built in Jerusalem and it's said to
[48:18] have been built on Mount Mariah which is
[48:21] the place that
[48:23] Abraham went to offer his son Isaac
[48:27] so it's a very very special place in
[48:29] history and you can see there you can
[48:32] see the smoke coming up is probably the
[48:35] the altar or the the burnt offerings
[48:39] there and I want to read part of a story
[48:43] to you
[48:44] and I don't usually recommend books
[48:47] because I don't read very many books but
[48:49] um this one is some was one that I read
[48:52] years and years ago and I've read it a
[48:54] couple times brother brandom actually
[48:56] told my dad to read this book he told my
[49:01] grandfather to have his children read
[49:03] this book it's called Prince of the
[49:04] House of David and it's a
[49:08] story it's it's written in the late
[49:10] 1800s by a man named uh
[49:13] Ingram and uh it's a parody it's about a
[49:18] Jewish girl named Adena and how she left
[49:21] her home to visit this holy city that
[49:24] you see there of Jerusalem and the the
[49:26] book is a series of letters that Adena
[49:29] writes to her father her dad was a rabbi
[49:33] and she was on her way to Jerusalem to
[49:35] visit and stay with her Uncle Amos who
[49:38] is also a rabbi and she and while she's
[49:41] on her way to visit she uh she's
[49:43] describing what happens and eventually
[49:45] in the book she comes to meet this Rabbi
[49:50] named
[49:51] Jesus it's it's a beautiful Story one of
[49:54] the it's the best book aside from this
[49:58] book it's the best book I've ever
[49:59] written or ever read and I recommend it
[50:02] it's hard it's hard to understand
[50:04] because it's written in late 1800
[50:06] English but it's a really really good
[50:09] read and very very it just puts you into
[50:12] the situation of um the time that Jesus
[50:16] came I I loved it so much that Stephanie
[50:19] and I even considered naming our our
[50:21] daughter after this young lady in this
[50:24] book named ad Aden very very good book
[50:27] so I want to read a portion on of this
[50:30] book I changed a couple words just a few
[50:33] here and there to make it make it more
[50:35] understandable she says
[50:38] this and remember she's writing back to
[50:40] her father she says on reaching a high
[50:43] place Jerusalem appeared as if R risen
[50:47] out of the earth I cannot my dear father
[50:49] describe to you my emotions on beholding
[50:52] the holy city these emotions have been
[50:54] experienced by millions of our people
[50:56] they were similar to your own emotions
[51:00] as you related them to me all the past
[51:04] with its mighty men who walked with
[51:05] Jehovah rushed to my memory and
[51:08] compelled me to bow my head and to
[51:10] worship and to adore at the sight of the
[51:12] temple where God wants alas why does he
[51:17] no longer visit Earth in his holy house
[51:20] where God Once dwelt In The Flaming
[51:22] shikina and made known the Oracles of
[51:25] his will we entered the city just before
[51:27] the 6th hour of the evening and we're
[51:29] soon at the house of our relative Amos
[51:32] the
[51:33] levite I was received as if I had a
[51:36] daughter's claim to their Embraces and
[51:38] with the luxuries which with which they
[51:41] surrounded me in my gorgeously furnished
[51:43] apartment I am sure my kins folk here
[51:46] mean to tempt me to forget the joys of
[51:49] of home there that I have left the rabbi
[51:52] Amos and his family all desire to be
[51:54] commended to you he seems to be a man of
[51:57] piety and benevolence and greatly loves
[52:00] his children I have been once to the
[52:02] temple its outer Court seemed like a
[52:05] vast Marketplace being thronged with men
[52:07] who sell animals for sacrifice which
[52:10] crowded all which crowded all the parts
[52:13] thousands of doves and large cages were
[52:15] sold on one side and on the other were
[52:18] stalls of lambs and sheep and calves and
[52:20] oxen the noise and the bleeding of which
[52:22] with all the confusion of the tongues
[52:24] made the place appear like anything else
[52:26] but the Temple of
[52:28] Jehovah it appears like
[52:31] desecration to use the temple thus dear
[52:35] father and seems to show a lack of that
[52:39] Holy Love of God's house that was once
[52:41] characterized by our
[52:43] ancestors on reaching the women's Court
[52:45] I was sensible of being in the I was
[52:48] sensible of being in the temple by the
[52:50] magnificence which surrounded me with
[52:53] what awe I bowed my head in the
[52:55] direction of the Holy of holies I have
[52:57] never felt before so near to God clouds
[53:02] of incense floated above the heads of
[53:05] the multitude and rivers of blood flowed
[53:09] Down The Marvelous steps of the altar of
[53:11] the burnt offering alas how many
[53:14] innocent victims bleed every morning and
[53:17] every evening for the sins of
[53:19] Israel what a sea of blood has been
[53:22] poured out in ages that have passed what
[53:25] a strange fear ful mystery that the
[53:28] blood of an innocent lamb should atone
[53:30] for the sins that I have
[53:32] done there must be some deeper meaning
[53:35] in these sacrifices dear father yet
[53:38] unrevealed to
[53:40] us you can see you can put yourself in
[53:43] the
[53:44] place of this young Jewish
[53:47] girl as she arrived at this city a place
[53:50] that she'd heard about her whole life
[53:52] and then she she goes there and she sees
[53:55] she doesn't understand why why does this
[53:58] lamb this innocent creature why does it
[54:01] have to die for my
[54:03] sins I I I don't understand the point in
[54:06] all this and so many times it's the
[54:10] youth that might say I don't understand
[54:14] the
[54:16] point and it's something that we need to
[54:18] be able to explain to them last week I
[54:23] heard so many more probably more
[54:26] comments on on the sermon last week than
[54:28] I've than I've really ever had in the in
[54:30] the year and a half that I've been here
[54:33] and they were uh the comments were you
[54:36] know sometimes I just don't understand
[54:38] the point of many of the things that we
[54:43] do and my
[54:46] answer is usually well if you don't
[54:50] understand the
[54:51] point if you don't really get it then
[54:53] why are you doing it if you don't
[54:56] understand if you don't really believe
[54:59] this then why are you doing it just
[55:04] because you've grown up a certain way or
[55:05] just because you believe a certain way
[55:08] you have to know there has to be
[55:10] something inside of you that it hits
[55:13] home and it's not just well a Christian
[55:16] does this or a Believer does this or
[55:18] that no you have to understand the
[55:22] point and the book of Hebrews is written
[55:25] so that we might understand the point in
[55:27] all of this that it might become a
[55:31] Living spirit and that word might dwell
[55:35] within
[55:36] us so that we can understand why why
[55:40] certain things are done and then you
[55:42] might see that well we're doing this why
[55:45] well just because that's tradition and
[55:48] it may not necessarily be right as this
[55:50] young lady Adena was seeing that that
[55:54] there has to be something has to be
[55:56] something more to this so let's go to
[55:59] Hebrews let's start chapter nine let's
[56:02] continue on and uh let's start with
[56:06] verse 11 for time sake it says this
[56:10] Hebrews 9 vers
[56:14] 11 but Christ being come a high priest
[56:19] of good things to come by a greater and
[56:21] more perfect Tabernacle not made with
[56:24] hands don't forget that very important
[56:28] Christ a more perfect Tabernacle a
[56:30] tabernacle is a tent you saw the picture
[56:32] of it this Tabernacle not made with
[56:36] hands that is to say not of this
[56:39] building neither by the blood of goats
[56:42] and calves but by the blood but by his
[56:45] own blood he entered once into the holy
[56:48] Place having obtained Eternal Redemption
[56:51] for
[56:52] us book of Hebrews continues to to
[56:56] remind us of that high priest and how he
[56:58] would go into the holy of holies once a
[57:01] year and make atonement for the people
[57:03] for if the blood of blls and goats and
[57:06] the ashes of a heer sprinkling the
[57:07] unclean
[57:09] sanctify to the purifying of the flesh
[57:11] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[57:14] who through the eternal
[57:16] spirit offered himself without spot to
[57:19] God Purge your conscience from dead
[57:21] Works to serve the Living God this is a
[57:26] a personal relationship with God
[57:28] brothers and sisters that's that's the
[57:30] whole theme of the whole book Purge your
[57:33] conscience from dead Works to serve a
[57:36] living God you in particular in
[57:39] particular you do
[57:41] it and you see that a works-based
[57:45] Salvation is a failure Jehovah Witness
[57:48] there a works-based
[57:50] Salvation they go to door to door they
[57:52] spend their required hour or whatever it
[57:54] is a month
[57:57] and and they they do that because that's
[57:59] required of the church Mormons the same
[58:01] thing they're works-based salvation
[58:02] Catholics same thing it's a works-based
[58:05] salvation but the reason is because
[58:08] they're all based on the
[58:10] church and furthering the
[58:13] church they think that if they can get a
[58:15] convert to their religion then that soul
[58:18] is saved they're not thinking about the
[58:21] individual and they're not thinking
[58:23] about the needs of that individual
[58:26] if they can get them to Christ then
[58:28] Christ will fulfill those needs it's
[58:31] that's that's the whole meaning that's
[58:33] the that's that's the point of it all no
[58:36] church no Organization no
[58:38] denomination nothing can replace a
[58:41] personal relationship with Christ I know
[58:44] that seems a bit cliche that seems a bit
[58:46] Elementary but that's the meaning of the
[58:49] book Genesis to Revelation that's it
[58:52] right there and for this cause he is the
[58:56] mediator speaking of of Jesus for this
[58:59] cause he is the mediator of the New
[59:00] Testament that by the means of death for
[59:04] the Redemption of the transgressors that
[59:06] were under the first testament they
[59:08] which are called might receive the
[59:10] promise of inheritance remember that
[59:13] word
[59:14] inheritance for where a testament is
[59:17] there must also of necessity be the
[59:20] death of the
[59:21] tester for a testament is a force after
[59:26] men are dead otherwise it is of no
[59:29] strength at all while the tester liveth
[59:31] it's a bit hard to understand but let me
[59:33] read to you the English Standard Version
[59:35] the English Standard Version I use that
[59:37] a lot it's a more literal translation
[59:39] than the King James version it's it's
[59:41] not that all that old so it it uses more
[59:44] Modern English but it's to me it's a
[59:48] very very good translation because it is
[59:50] very literal says this English Standard
[59:54] Version verse 17 if you could yeah leave
[59:56] that up there for a will takes effect
[59:59] only at death since it is not in force
[1:00:02] as long as the one who made it is alive
[1:00:06] so if I put my son Daniel in my will he
[1:00:09] receives a certain part of my estate
[1:00:11] when I die but it doesn't mean anything
[1:00:14] until I'm dead until I'm gone until I
[1:00:17] die he doesn't get an inheritance until
[1:00:20] until I die and the promise the promises
[1:00:22] of redemption of adoption of inheriting
[1:00:25] eternal life they are not validated
[1:00:28] until a death has occurred because they
[1:00:31] are
[1:00:33] inheritance and then someone might ask
[1:00:35] why so I don't understand why did Jesus
[1:00:38] have to
[1:00:39] die well brothers and sisters it might
[1:00:42] not make sense to
[1:00:44] us that Jesus Christ had to die for our
[1:00:48] sins but it doesn't have to make sense
[1:00:50] to us God is Sovereign God doesn't twist
[1:00:56] his way of thinking and his law to match
[1:00:59] our understanding and the way and the
[1:01:01] things that we want we change
[1:01:05] our understanding we change our emotions
[1:01:08] we change our way of thinking to match
[1:01:12] what God has set before
[1:01:15] us it's not up to God as I said to
[1:01:18] reform to conform to our religion it's
[1:01:20] up to us to conform to his
[1:01:24] religion let's skip to verse number
[1:01:28] 22 and almost all things are by the law
[1:01:31] purged with blood and without shedding
[1:01:34] of blood is no
[1:01:37] remission so again something had to die
[1:01:41] for us to
[1:01:42] live it's got to be personal and I think
[1:01:46] that that's where so many of us miss it
[1:01:49] is we think that everything's just okay
[1:01:52] because we cause our call ourselves a
[1:01:53] Christian or we're baptized or whatever
[1:01:55] might be but it's got to be a personal
[1:01:59] it's got this has got to be between me
[1:02:01] and him you remember when uh when Trump
[1:02:04] when they when they shot uh Trump a few
[1:02:06] weeks ago a couple weeks ago and um
[1:02:09] there was a man that died in the
[1:02:12] audience this man when he died he laid
[1:02:17] across his family to protect him because
[1:02:19] he knew the bullets were coming so he
[1:02:21] laid across his family and he took the
[1:02:23] bullet for his family
[1:02:26] imagine if you were his daughter and you
[1:02:30] were laying under your
[1:02:32] dad and you felt that bullet go into
[1:02:36] your father and die that's
[1:02:39] personal imagine how you would feel
[1:02:42] imagine if if you knew that he was he
[1:02:44] was on top of you and he protected you
[1:02:46] how much would you think of your dad how
[1:02:48] much would you love your dad after that
[1:02:51] that's how personal it needs to be not
[1:02:53] only did he die on the cross
[1:02:56] not not only did he take a bullet like
[1:02:58] this man
[1:03:00] did but he he did it in in a much harder
[1:03:04] way than this man
[1:03:06] did he thought about it he had to he had
[1:03:09] to make this decision he knew what was
[1:03:11] coming he he were in The Garden of
[1:03:14] Gethsemane he was he was just so upset
[1:03:17] and so worried and and he just he got
[1:03:20] down there he's on his knees and and he
[1:03:22] was he was so in such anxiety that even
[1:03:25] blood was coming out of his pores and he
[1:03:27] said Lord if it let this cup pass from
[1:03:31] me I don't want to do it but he said but
[1:03:33] your will be
[1:03:35] done and you know why he did it for me
[1:03:40] for Daniel
[1:03:41] Evans and if I'm the only one he did it
[1:03:44] for me just like that man Laying across
[1:03:48] his daughter and taking the bullet for
[1:03:50] his daughter imagine how she feels about
[1:03:52] her dad and how much she's going to love
[1:03:55] him and we to love Jesus Christ even
[1:03:57] more and if as I said it needs to be so
[1:03:59] personal that if I am the only one he
[1:04:01] still would have lived the life that he
[1:04:03] lived he still would have gone to the
[1:04:04] cross and he still would have died for
[1:04:06] me just
[1:04:08] me or just
[1:04:11] you that's how much he loved each of us
[1:04:14] that's what Christ
[1:04:16] means this book of Hebrews is bringing
[1:04:19] that
[1:04:20] out and I say a
[1:04:24] lot that it's not about about you you
[1:04:27] know and I'm always talking about it's
[1:04:29] like well I want this and I want that
[1:04:30] well it's not all about you if you're a
[1:04:32] Christian you should want to help others
[1:04:34] but really this book it is about you it
[1:04:40] is about me it's about Redemption it's
[1:04:43] about eternal life it's about Joy it's
[1:04:46] about love and it's it pertains all of
[1:04:48] it pertains to
[1:04:50] me he did it all for
[1:04:52] me and he did it all for you if you
[1:04:55] truly accept it it is a personal
[1:04:59] Messiah we need to know him be on a
[1:05:03] speaking basis with
[1:05:05] him verse
[1:05:07] 23 it was therefore NE necessary that
[1:05:12] the patterns of the things in heaven
[1:05:14] should be purified with these but the
[1:05:16] Heavenly things themselves with better
[1:05:18] sacrifices than these for Christ is not
[1:05:21] entered into the holy places made with
[1:05:23] hands which are figures of the true
[1:05:26] copies of the true but into heaven
[1:05:29] itself now to appear in the presence of
[1:05:32] God for us so the Tabernacle in the
[1:05:36] wilderness the temple built by Solomon
[1:05:38] they're not the real
[1:05:40] thing the real thing is that Temple
[1:05:44] that's built without hands and here it
[1:05:48] Likens Jesus Christ to that Temple he's
[1:05:52] the one all of this was just as we'll
[1:05:54] read here in a minute it was just just a
[1:05:56] shadow it wasn't real but when the man
[1:05:59] Jesus Christ came it was all manifested
[1:06:01] to him and then he takes his spirit and
[1:06:04] he pours it down upon
[1:06:08] us and then we become his
[1:06:12] Representatives speaking with the
[1:06:14] authority that he gives
[1:06:17] us and the prince of the House of David
[1:06:19] as as the the book goes through this
[1:06:22] Adena she finally understands the
[1:06:23] meaning of all of this at the end
[1:06:26] when she finally meets Jesus Christ and
[1:06:29] she understands why he
[1:06:32] came and it's
[1:06:35] not that spirit and that that
[1:06:39] understanding of this word when it comes
[1:06:42] down into a human being then we become
[1:06:45] that Temple that is not made with hands
[1:06:48] and that Spirit becomes the law that is
[1:06:51] in us and it's magnified so now we can
[1:06:55] understand
[1:06:56] what to do in each
[1:06:58] situation it gives us that understanding
[1:07:00] that Holy Spirit that's what we should
[1:07:04] always seek and we always want to do
[1:07:06] better for the Lord but if we don't have
[1:07:08] that understanding we're not going to
[1:07:09] get it right it's just going to be the
[1:07:13] law and the law was not
[1:07:18] meant Christ was
[1:07:21] meant to fulfill the law nor yet
[1:07:26] that he should offer himself often as
[1:07:28] the high priest enter into the holy
[1:07:29] place every year with with blood of
[1:07:32] others for then must he often have
[1:07:34] suffered since the foundation of the
[1:07:36] world but now once in the end of the
[1:07:38] world world hath he appeared to put away
[1:07:42] sin by the sacrifice of himself so
[1:07:45] Christ died for our sins once he entered
[1:07:47] into the holy place and that is for all
[1:07:50] eternity he doesn't have to die on the
[1:07:52] cross
[1:07:53] again just like taking a a goat every
[1:07:56] time that I sin and and offering it on
[1:07:59] the altar Christ did it once and that
[1:08:04] was for
[1:08:05] all but neither brothers and sisters
[1:08:08] neither do we have to continue to make
[1:08:11] intercessions for our own sins or to
[1:08:13] continue to make sacrifices for our own
[1:08:15] sins we sin we repent we feel bad we try
[1:08:20] to make it right we bring it before the
[1:08:22] Lord and then he forgives our sins don't
[1:08:25] don't pull it try to pull it back out
[1:08:27] from under the blood it's
[1:08:28] gone so many people and it's so hard for
[1:08:33] certain people to to get past their sins
[1:08:37] that they have
[1:08:38] done and it ruins their life it puts
[1:08:41] anxiety on us it it puts this guilt on
[1:08:43] us place it in the hands of the Lord and
[1:08:47] that's it it's
[1:08:49] over Christ can handle it believe me he
[1:08:53] can handle a lot better than our worries
[1:08:55] can handle it or or our anxiety can
[1:08:58] handle
[1:08:59] it verse number 27 and as it is
[1:09:03] appointed unto men once to die but after
[1:09:06] this
[1:09:07] judgment so we all
[1:09:11] say we're going in the
[1:09:13] Rapture and the Rapture is going to
[1:09:15] happen it's promised it's going to be
[1:09:19] here they've been saying if you read in
[1:09:22] first and second Peter Peter is I get
[1:09:24] ready it's going to happen happen and
[1:09:26] that's how every person for the last
[1:09:28] 2,000 years every True Believer it's
[1:09:30] going to happen and and they're they're
[1:09:32] excited about it and then they
[1:09:35] die it's okay if we live like God is
[1:09:40] like Jesus is going to return tomorrow
[1:09:43] our lives will be get to will be better
[1:09:46] and he is going to come and just like I
[1:09:49] was talking about earlier these are
[1:09:52] signs I think undeniable signs that he
[1:09:54] is going to return we're seeing the same
[1:09:58] signs that happened every time that God
[1:10:01] pronounced judgment on the earth and
[1:10:03] he's going to pull out his
[1:10:06] sweetheart his bride he's going to pull
[1:10:10] her out before it really gets
[1:10:13] bad but and we should always be thinking
[1:10:16] about that and we may die in the flesh
[1:10:21] and then pause for a while until he
[1:10:24] comes and and brings us out brothers and
[1:10:27] sisters but what we all have to do is we
[1:10:29] all have to die our to our own
[1:10:33] selves we've got to die to ourselves and
[1:10:35] got die to our way of thinking and die
[1:10:37] to that stubbornness that is in us and
[1:10:40] that religious spirit is often very very
[1:10:43] stubborn we've got to die to
[1:10:46] that you know you you think about this
[1:10:48] 50y old man that lost his life at that
[1:10:51] Trump rally do you think when he woke up
[1:10:54] this that morning do you think think
[1:10:55] that he thought today's going to be my
[1:10:56] last
[1:10:58] day
[1:10:59] no my grandma I got a 97 year- old
[1:11:03] grandma and she's going to outlive many
[1:11:05] 16-year- old kids she's going to outlive
[1:11:08] many 50 year
[1:11:11] olds our time could be any time and we
[1:11:15] always need to be ready for that we are
[1:11:17] looking for the Rapture but the Lord may
[1:11:19] come for me before that
[1:11:21] Rapture and we need to be ready for that
[1:11:24] always seeking God and having that
[1:11:27] relationship Lord what how do you want
[1:11:28] me to act today what do you want me to
[1:11:30] do where do you want me to be always
[1:11:32] seeking that and always ready I I had a
[1:11:36] high school friend that uh right after
[1:11:39] high
[1:11:40] school he uh he was
[1:11:43] driving and lost control of his car and
[1:11:46] he hit a cable and it killed instantly
[1:11:49] you know a 19-year-old boy was he ready
[1:11:54] when he woke up W up that morning he did
[1:11:57] not there was no thought that ever
[1:11:58] crossed his mind probably that he is
[1:12:00] going to go to meet his maker this day
[1:12:03] was he
[1:12:05] ready all of us should be ready we don't
[1:12:07] know God doesn't usually reveal to us
[1:12:09] when we're going but he warns us and we
[1:12:13] are we can look around the world and we
[1:12:15] can see this warning now to be
[1:12:22] ready and if you're ready to meet the
[1:12:26] Lord you're also ready to meet a
[1:12:28] potential
[1:12:29] believer if your life is right you're
[1:12:32] ready to go you're you're you're you've
[1:12:36] made peace and everything is is is going
[1:12:38] right in your life of course you'll sin
[1:12:40] you'll do things wrong but you have the
[1:12:42] blood of Christ you understand Jesus
[1:12:43] Christ now the Lord might use you to now
[1:12:48] witness to someone else and then you can
[1:12:50] impart that joy that you have to someone
[1:12:54] else
[1:12:56] verse number 28 so Christ was once
[1:12:59] offered to Bear the sins of many and
[1:13:01] unto them that look for him shall he
[1:13:05] appear the second time without sin un
[1:13:10] Salvation let's go to verse let's go to
[1:13:12] Hebrews 10 let's continue on for the law
[1:13:15] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:13:17] and not the very image of things can
[1:13:19] never with those sacrifices which they
[1:13:21] offered year by year continually to make
[1:13:24] the comers there unto perfect so
[1:13:27] remember adena's letter to her dad that
[1:13:29] that book I know it's a fictional book
[1:13:30] but it was very very well researched and
[1:13:32] done she might have said I don't
[1:13:35] understand the meaning of this it's
[1:13:37] because she was just seeing the
[1:13:40] shadow of what is
[1:13:42] real and that's what the law was and
[1:13:45] that's what the sacrifice was and that's
[1:13:46] what the temple was and that's what the
[1:13:48] Tabernacle was it was just a shadow if
[1:13:51] you look at a shadow it's like I can see
[1:13:53] the outline of my hand I can see the
[1:13:56] outline of
[1:13:57] myself but it's not
[1:14:00] me if you look at me you can see all the
[1:14:02] detail in me you can see that yeah the
[1:14:05] round head is actually
[1:14:07] bald you can see the the skin tone and
[1:14:11] you can see all the different the
[1:14:12] different shapes if you're looking
[1:14:15] directly at that person but this is just
[1:14:17] a shadow let skip to verse
[1:14:21] 9 then said he lo I come to do thy will
[1:14:25] will oh God he taketh away the first
[1:14:29] that he may establish the second of
[1:14:33] course he's talking about the law and
[1:14:35] legalism associated with the law but to
[1:14:37] accept that we have to get rid of our
[1:14:40] own
[1:14:41] ideas we have to understand that there
[1:14:43] is a point in all this and there is a
[1:14:45] point in coming to church there's a
[1:14:46] point in singing songs of worship and
[1:14:48] we've got to make changes in our life
[1:14:51] and this all of this goes to one point
[1:14:54] which is as I've said getting to know
[1:14:58] Christ that personal relationship with
[1:15:00] God
[1:15:02] himself I was um I used to have
[1:15:04] Stephanie when we were in Jeffersonville
[1:15:06] I'd have Stephanie sometime drop me off
[1:15:10] in certain areas and I'd say just leave
[1:15:11] me for a couple hours and I'll just try
[1:15:14] to get somebody to listen to me try to
[1:15:17] witness and I was I'd go around and and
[1:15:21] um try to tell people about the Lord and
[1:15:25] and met this lady she was
[1:15:28] obviously uh on drugs and and kind of
[1:15:32] homeless and uh she was on the on the
[1:15:35] path so I started witnessing to her and
[1:15:38] ends up uh I called Stephany and and she
[1:15:41] picked us up we took her we took her to
[1:15:43] get some food and then we got her
[1:15:45] checked into a a shelter for that
[1:15:48] evening and her as I was talking about
[1:15:52] the Lord to her she said
[1:15:56] yeah I know people other people have
[1:15:57] told me all about this she says I
[1:15:59] understand that but she said it doesn't
[1:16:01] help me at
[1:16:02] all she says I don't have any
[1:16:05] money to get a to get a hotel she says I
[1:16:08] don't have food she says I don't have
[1:16:10] any of these things she said what's it
[1:16:13] what good is it for me just to know this
[1:16:17] Jesus and she didn't get the point she
[1:16:19] didn't understand it and everything that
[1:16:22] I said it it just it just wouldn't reson
[1:16:25] so it's like okay well we'll help her
[1:16:26] we'll feed her we'll give her some money
[1:16:28] we'll get her into the shelter and
[1:16:29] hopefully something that we said stuck
[1:16:32] but then there was another story and I
[1:16:34] told this story partly this story last
[1:16:36] week that there was a young lady that my
[1:16:41] brother had been in contact with and she
[1:16:44] was coming to the Bible study that he
[1:16:46] does on Wednesday night and I like to
[1:16:49] talk a little bit more about that young
[1:16:51] lady her name's Jordan she was 10 years
[1:16:56] old got in a fight with her mom 10 years
[1:16:59] old got in a fight with her mom mom and
[1:17:02] dad was split up her mom gives her a
[1:17:05] garbage
[1:17:07] bag put she puts everything she has in
[1:17:10] it she says get out and go live with
[1:17:12] your dad 10 years
[1:17:14] old so the little girl goes she lives
[1:17:18] with her dad her dad mistreats her
[1:17:21] horribly many ways

[1:17:28] through this she tells her
[1:17:32] aunt her dad's
[1:17:34] sister and she says don't ever tell
[1:17:36] anybody of this she says if you tell
[1:17:38] anybody this your dad will be put in
[1:17:40] prison and then you'll have nowhere to
[1:17:42] go so it scared the little girl time

[1:17:48] cousin who goes straight to the
[1:17:50] police her dad gets arrested

[1:18:21] University of Louisville that she wants
[1:18:24] to be lawyer because of all of this
[1:18:26] stuff that that's happened to her she
[1:18:28] gets this
[1:18:29] scholarship and she
[1:18:34] um um she gets a scholarship and and she
[1:18:39] she moves out and the scholarship says
[1:18:43] that it's a bridge program you you go
[1:18:45] into criminal justice for three years
[1:18:47] and then you go into law school for
[1:18:48] three years and if you you there's two
[1:18:51] stipulations you have to either live on
[1:18:53] campus or you have to live with your
[1:18:54] parents
[1:18:55] she was moved out she couldn't live with
[1:18:57] her mom and she couldn't afford to live
[1:19:00] with her parents I mean she couldn't
[1:19:02] afford to live on campus so she gets
[1:19:05] kicked out of
[1:19:07] school because she didn't meet those
[1:19:11] requirements then she gets a she gets a
[1:19:15] job and and she's going to work her way
[1:19:16] through school and then she gets she has
[1:19:19] that seizure as I said last week she
[1:19:23] goes into the hospital she's never had a
[1:19:25] seizure like that before and she never
[1:19:27] had one since the um the nurse witnessed
[1:19:31] to her about the Lord Jesus she gives
[1:19:33] her heart to Christ she
[1:19:38] changed that young lady she got the
[1:19:42] point she started going to church she
[1:19:45] saw how important that this community
[1:19:48] that's around her is and she she
[1:19:51] appreciated it and she loved it and she
[1:19:54] she saw that she can get strength from
[1:19:56] the church she gets baptized last week
[1:19:59] as I said and then she she witnesses to
[1:20:02] the to the group at the Bible study how
[1:20:05] she got baptized my brother asked her to
[1:20:07] give her testimony she gives her
[1:20:08] testimony to that
[1:20:11] group my brother asked her he says you
[1:20:13] know like what are you going to do are
[1:20:15] you going to try to sue the school she
[1:20:16] said no she said I'm going to work
[1:20:19] through it she said I'm a
[1:20:21] fighter and you see the difference
[1:20:23] between the two the one that I witnessed
[1:20:25] to it's like what can you give me the
[1:20:28] other one realized that all my sins are
[1:20:29] gone and there were
[1:20:31] many and now I'm saved and now I can't
[1:20:35] do enough for
[1:20:36] him very different stories let's go to
[1:20:40] verse
[1:20:41] 15 wherefore the Holy Ghost maybe one
[1:20:45] I've been thinking about it maybe we'll
[1:20:46] fly her out here and have her give her
[1:20:48] testimony to the church it just it just
[1:20:51] struck me so much and what this young
[1:20:54] lady has gone through and she's not
[1:20:56] complaining she's putting God first in
[1:20:59] her
[1:21:01] life where whereof the Holy Ghost also
[1:21:04] is a witness to us for after that he had
[1:21:07] said before this is the Covenant that I
[1:21:09] will make with them after those days
[1:21:11] sayeth the Lord and I will put my laws
[1:21:12] into their hearts and in their minds
[1:21:14] will I write them and their sins and
[1:21:17] their iniquities will I remember no more
[1:21:19] again he's quoting Jeremiah 31 as he did
[1:21:22] in chapter 8 as we've gone through
[1:21:29] and he
[1:21:33] says I'll stop right there for a moment
[1:21:36] I just thinking about how good God is
[1:21:40] and how how precious he is and that
[1:21:42] promise to Jeremiah I will put my laws
[1:21:45] in their heart it wasn't the it was just
[1:21:47] a shadow that Temple and all of the all
[1:21:50] the laws and all the rituals it was just
[1:21:53] a type but then when Christ comes he
[1:21:55] fulfills it and then he tells Jeremiah
[1:21:58] he says I'm going to put my laws in
[1:22:00] their heart they are going to be living
[1:22:03] walking talking
[1:22:06] Bibles and the spirit of the Lord is
[1:22:08] going to come from them it's going to go
[1:22:10] into them and they are going to do my
[1:22:14] will in all things how beautiful is that
[1:22:17] I just I can't I can't say enough about
[1:22:19] that how wonderful it is that he would
[1:22:21] put his law his word into to us into me
[1:22:27] what an honor I never want to forsake
[1:22:29] Him I never want to do something wrong I
[1:22:31] always want to serve
[1:22:33] him so then it's not
[1:22:37] anymore Thou shalt not go to movies Thou
[1:22:40] shalt not wear certain types of clothing
[1:22:42] Thou shalt not go to public schools
[1:22:44] don't Thou shalt not let your kids play
[1:22:45] with the neighbor koods Thou shalt not
[1:22:48] go any church outside your denomination
[1:22:50] Thou shalt not listen to any other
[1:22:52] ministers other than the ones that are
[1:22:54] approved by the
[1:22:55] denomination when you receive those laws
[1:22:59] into your heart those times stop and
[1:23:05] then whatever you do you do it in the
[1:23:08] name of Jesus Christ if you're going to
[1:23:10] go to a movie you do it in the name of
[1:23:12] Jesus Christ if you're going to visit
[1:23:13] another church you do it in the name of
[1:23:15] Jesus Christ if you go to school you're
[1:23:17] going to go in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:23:19] and you will be a witness to those other
[1:23:21] kids about Jesus you're going to be that
[1:23:24] Living Bible before
[1:23:27] them if you're wearing certain clothes
[1:23:29] you're going to do it in the name of
[1:23:30] Jesus Christ under the conviction that
[1:23:33] he put under on on top of
[1:23:36] you the Holy Spirit leading you in all
[1:23:38] things because he is dwelling
[1:23:41] inside let's skip to verse
[1:23:43] 24 and let us consider one another to
[1:23:47] provoke un love and to Good Works not
[1:23:50] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:23:51] together as the manner of some is but
[1:23:54] exort in one another and so much more as
[1:23:56] you see the day
[1:23:58] approaching he's saying we need to be in
[1:24:01] church it's
[1:24:04] important not only will singing and
[1:24:07] hearing the gospel do you good but
[1:24:10] you're also making a sacrifice to be
[1:24:12] here it's so easy to stay home you know
[1:24:16] do you think that I always want to be
[1:24:18] here do you think that the brothers that
[1:24:20] are always here and the sisters always
[1:24:21] here do you think they always want to be
[1:24:23] here and answer is no but they make that
[1:24:27] sacrifice and then when you're here have
[1:24:30] you ever regretted coming to
[1:24:32] church I have a couple times when when
[1:24:35] it got to be about about um really just
[1:24:40] about insulting other churches and and
[1:24:43] putting other people down and exalting
[1:24:45] ourselves over someone else then yeah I
[1:24:47] would have done better just to go to the
[1:24:49] local church on the corner or the
[1:24:51] closest one to my house
[1:24:54] I would have done better to go to one of
[1:24:56] those with just a just a group of people
[1:24:58] that love the Lord Jesus and lift him up
[1:25:02] and humble
[1:25:05] themselves
[1:25:07] but the most important thing the point
[1:25:11] of all of it is we need to be here we
[1:25:15] need to be part of a group do you think
[1:25:18] this young lady Jordan she is so happy
[1:25:21] that she's part of a group she's so
[1:25:22] happy that she has a pastor that cares
[1:25:24] about her she's so happy that she has
[1:25:26] friends because she knows how it is not
[1:25:29] to have that she knows how it is not to
[1:25:31] have that
[1:25:32] support and the Bible very plainly says
[1:25:35] hey don't neglect this come to church be
[1:25:40] part of it I understand you you all know
[1:25:42] that I'm not a legalist I'm not I'm not
[1:25:45] somebody who's watching every time that
[1:25:47] you you hear that's not the point the
[1:25:49] point is being part and the point is
[1:25:53] helping and not only do you come here
[1:25:55] for
[1:25:57] yourself but you come here for other
[1:25:59] people to that you can help others and
[1:26:02] encourage
[1:26:05] others where are we
[1:26:09] at verse number 25 I'll read it again
[1:26:11] not forsaking the Assemblies of
[1:26:13] assembling of ourselves together as the
[1:26:15] manner of some is but exhorting one
[1:26:17] another and so much more as you see the
[1:26:19] day approaching for if we sin willfully
[1:26:22] after that we have received the
[1:26:23] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[1:26:25] no sacrifice for sins but a certain
[1:26:28] fearful look but a certain fearful
[1:26:31] looking for of judgment and fiery
[1:26:34] indignation which shall
[1:26:37] Devour the
[1:26:40] adversaries
[1:26:42] um is it does it seem to you like he's
[1:26:46] saying that if we don't congregate we're
[1:26:49] sinning
[1:26:50] willfully let me read another
[1:26:52] translation maybe that want to make it
[1:26:53] easier which is more it says this and
[1:26:56] let us consider how to stir up one
[1:26:58] another to love and to Good Works not
[1:27:00] neglecting to meet together as is the
[1:27:03] habit of some but encouraging one
[1:27:04] another and all the more as you see the
[1:27:07] day Drawing Near for if we go on sinning
[1:27:09] deliberately after receiving the
[1:27:11] knowledge of the truth there no longer
[1:27:14] remains a sacrifice for sins but a
[1:27:16] fearful expectation of judgment and a
[1:27:19] fury of fire that will consume the
[1:27:23] adversaries
[1:27:25] same thing says the exact same thing I'm
[1:27:28] not a legalist as as I've said I
[1:27:31] understand that there's reasons that
[1:27:33] some that prevent people from coming to
[1:27:35] church I I understand that some people
[1:27:36] are not able to get out of their house
[1:27:38] and God has has giving us has given a
[1:27:41] streaming
[1:27:43] but we need to be part of that
[1:27:48] body and I'm not saying I'm really I'm
[1:27:51] not saying that if you don't come to
[1:27:53] church chch I'm not saying that you're
[1:27:55] sinning
[1:27:56] willfully the book of Hebrews is saying
[1:27:59] that it's a higher level than I
[1:28:03] am and it's it's important because as
[1:28:06] the manner of some there are many people
[1:28:09] no one here but there are many people
[1:28:13] that they don't go to church because
[1:28:15] when they come they're looking for
[1:28:18] something to criticize and you're going
[1:28:20] to get it wherever you are in my sermon
[1:28:23] today I'm sure there's many things that
[1:28:25] you could say oh well he was wrong on
[1:28:26] this and he was wrong on that and you
[1:28:28] might be
[1:28:29] right but it doesn't say that I'm going
[1:28:32] to be perfect or no that any other man
[1:28:34] is going to be perfect but it says that
[1:28:36] to come and to be part of it and I see
[1:28:40] so often that they just well I'm just
[1:28:42] going to stay home because I don't want
[1:28:45] to be part of that or or or I'm too good
[1:28:47] for that or they may or they they teach
[1:28:49] something that I don't agree with that's
[1:28:51] not according to the word that is called
[1:28:55] arrogance saying that I'm too good I
[1:28:58] know people they go from church to
[1:29:01] church and then they're just going to
[1:29:03] stay home because that's that's where
[1:29:07] they're the
[1:29:08] happiest because they're better and it's
[1:29:11] not
[1:29:12] right my little sermon on coming to
[1:29:15] church it's
[1:29:17] important I love you all so much and and
[1:29:20] and I know I look out across and
[1:29:22] everybody here comes and everybody here
[1:29:24] part and and I I do appreciate every
[1:29:26] single
[1:29:28] one but the Bible commands us to be part
[1:29:33] and to be in church and it is very
[1:29:35] important and it's not for God he
[1:29:38] doesn't need us we need
[1:29:41] him and when we come here it helps us
[1:29:46] and then we can help other people the
[1:29:49] more the more we have the the the better
[1:29:52] the fellowship and you see the kids and
[1:29:54] they have more friends and and they can
[1:29:56] draw strength from each other we all
[1:29:58] need
[1:29:59] that where was I at verse
[1:30:03] 28 and we we'll close he that despised
[1:30:07] Moses's law died without Mercy under two
[1:30:10] or three Witnesses of how so much of how
[1:30:14] much sore punishment suppose ye shall
[1:30:17] shall he be thought worthy who hath
[1:30:19] trotten underfoot the Son of God and
[1:30:21] hath counted the blood of the Covenant
[1:30:23] wherewith he was sent Sanctified an
[1:30:25] Unholy thing and hath done despite unto
[1:30:28] the spirit of Grace this it's not all
[1:30:30] fun and
[1:30:32] games if there is salvation then there's
[1:30:34] also judgment if there's forgiveness
[1:30:37] then there's also Vengeance we want
[1:30:40] forgiveness we want
[1:30:43] salvation for we know him that hath said
[1:30:46] Vengeance belongeth unto me I will
[1:30:48] recompense saying the Lord and again the
[1:30:51] Lord shall judge his people it is a
[1:30:53] fearful thing thing to fall in the hands
[1:30:55] into the hands of the Living
[1:30:58] God it's only by the grace of
[1:31:01] God that those people that were mocking
[1:31:05] the Last
[1:31:06] Supper that they weren't brought into
[1:31:08] Judgment at that very moment and it's
[1:31:11] only by the grace of God that many times
[1:31:13] that I have made mistakes in my life and
[1:31:15] many times that I have been to La too
[1:31:18] LAX with things or I have been too jokey
[1:31:21] around that God didn't just strike me
[1:31:23] down right there it was because of the
[1:31:25] blood of Jesus
[1:31:27] Christ the same
[1:31:29] blood that I believe that is staying the
[1:31:32] wrath of God for those people in France
[1:31:35] that did that abominable thing we're all
[1:31:38] under the protection of Christ and I
[1:31:40] just pray brothers and sisters that we
[1:31:42] can that he will just T so we can get
[1:31:46] everybody that we can in before he comes
[1:31:49] but call to remembrance the former days
[1:31:51] in which after you were illuminated he
[1:31:54] endured a great fight of afflictions
[1:31:56] partly was she were made a gazing stock
[1:32:01] both by reproaches and afflictions and
[1:32:03] partly whilst you became Companions of
[1:32:06] them that were so used for ye had
[1:32:08] compassion of me in my bonds and took
[1:32:11] Joy joyfully the spoiling of your goods
[1:32:14] knowing in yourselves that you have a in
[1:32:18] heaven a better and enduring place so
[1:32:19] the author is talking directly to people
[1:32:22] in a specific audience here and he's
[1:32:24] saying that because you're a Christian
[1:32:25] you had your your possessions
[1:32:27] confiscated and they were also kind to
[1:32:29] him and brother Lyall that's why I think
[1:32:31] that's really good proof I think that
[1:32:33] that Paul wrote this letter is because
[1:32:35] he is saying that you also were kind to
[1:32:38] me when I was in my bonds which Paul
[1:32:41] many times says that cast not away
[1:32:43] therefore your confidence which hath
[1:32:45] great recompense of reward for you have
[1:32:47] need of patience that after you have
[1:32:50] done the will of God you might receive
[1:32:52] the promise for yet a little while and
[1:32:55] he that shall come will come and Will T
[1:32:58] not and will not t now the just shall
[1:33:01] live by faith but if any man draw back
[1:33:04] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[1:33:07] but we are not of them who draw back
[1:33:09] into predition but of them that believe
[1:33:13] to the saving of the
[1:33:16] soul is a very very diff very tough
[1:33:19] chapter but it l it ends on a very very
[1:33:22] positive note because we are not brother
[1:33:24] Michael and the the um musicians would
[1:33:28] come and close but we are not of them
[1:33:31] who draw back unto predition but of them
[1:33:34] that believe to the saving of the Soul
[1:33:37] how beautiful how beautiful is God's
[1:33:40] word his promises and this book of
[1:33:44] Hebrews over and over again and it just
[1:33:47] repeats itself and I was amazed that as
[1:33:50] I as I dug deeper oh he said that to
[1:33:53] chapters ago and it was constantly going
[1:33:56] back telling us that this Christ is the
[1:34:01] high priest that this Temple is just a
[1:34:04] shadow of what should be which is us
[1:34:08] living this law and then this law that
[1:34:11] was given is just a shadow that it
[1:34:14] should be lived through our lives are
[1:34:17] you with me are we
[1:34:20] together as I
[1:34:22] said difficult
[1:34:24] very strong chapter in this book of
[1:34:27] Hebrews but the next
[1:34:30] chapter I'm really looking forward to
[1:34:33] that is I believe it's called a lot of
[1:34:36] people call it the Hall of
[1:34:37] faith and it goes through many many
[1:34:40] different Servants of the Lord and how
[1:34:42] they
[1:34:43] overcame and how that they weren't they
[1:34:46] didn't get caught up in the things of
[1:34:48] the world but God was with them and it
[1:34:52] doesn't mention and the thing about the
[1:34:53] next chapter is so wonderful to me is
[1:34:56] every single one of them had fa faults
[1:34:58] and flaws but the Bible it doesn't
[1:35:00] mention any of them it just sees
[1:35:04] Perfection there because Christ has come
[1:35:08] to perfect it God bless you brothers and
[1:35:11] sisters brother

[1:40:54] prayers for one another because we all
[1:40:57] need
[1:40:57] it it's it's everyone everyone's going

[1:41:30] again be an opportunity to win a soul to
