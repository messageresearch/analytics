come welcome where [Music] well [Music] come well [Music] we will come amen god bless you all you may be seated it's wonderful to minister in a packed house tonight it is it's it's great because let me tell you then this i can prove by the word that there are angels that we cannot see there are beings in this building that are present with us that we cannot see with our natural eyes brother jeremy they are here and and as i minister today i pray that not only that i please them and please you all but most of all of all that i please the lord jesus it's uh i'd like to say is everybody feeling better because i think everybody got sick and the ones that are better now are here right it was the strangest thing i got sick and i got the flu and then as a few days came by thank you jordan as as a few days went by then i got a different set of symptoms and uh i stuck my face in a bag of coffee and i couldn't smell a thing it was the weirdest thing that that when you lose your smell and your taste and uh today my wife was putting on some lotion on her hands and i smelled it it was like most beautiful thing in the world so so i i think i'm i'm on the way back brother david it's good to see you there you know i appreciated your prayer this morning or tonight about the rich young ruler that that story has always struck my heart and it's always been something that i look i've looked at it and and i see that jesus loved this young man and he gave him this opportunity and it wasn't necessarily money it was it was this is what this man his problem was with money and the story is that this man that is what was going to keep him out of the kingdom and jesus because jesus loved him he said sell all that you have because he saw that that was what was going to keep him out so brother david you know you're praying that this evening it really it touched my heart and and i liked what you said you said something about um the story of salvation that that the lord has written and that we get to have a part in it brother i appreciate it that very much brother david's special to me not because he and i have been uh close over the years but brother david has been a special person to my son daniel daniel really looks up to brother david i mean he's a cool guy he's a fighter pilot for heaven's sake what kid wouldn't like that but um i remember david when my son met you first he came to me and he's like dad i met you know brother david and sister sharon and they're the greatest the greatest things and he's like dad they're so down to earth they don't go too far this way or too far that way so someone and like you brother david you're in that position i always tell my son that daniel you are going to influence people you're going to influence them good or bad you don't have the choice of if you're going to influence them but you have the choice if you're going to influence them in a good way or in a bad way and brother david fontenaire there is somebody that i really appreciate and i appreciate you calling that you and sharon have to the youth and all that you've done brother heath my friend it's good to see you and i just uh i feel good i feel i feel good i feel like you know we're few a number but but the angels are here with us and um i uh i also appreciated i was proud of our church but aaron during harmony you know and and seeing the brothers back there seeing brother arny and brother ed and and um he's not here tonight but brother lyle you know at the post of duties and and doing so much and brother jordan just the brother has given his life to serving the people and and all that i don't see the roberts is here but sister roberts did so much sister martha did so much i was just i was proud to be associated with them and i was uh we were sitting there about where um stephanie's sitting and um i got a text and uh on a a friend from on the other side of the country he said hey i really like the beard i was like what and that camera that's up there was pointing right at us so then i started getting a couple other texts and then a sister texted my wife and she said um she says i really like your hair is it permed and uh who do you do who who do you go to to get your hair permed and this sister was in jeffersonville so somebody's always watching us and i thought i got a kick out of that um but uh yeah it's it was good i really enjoyed the fellowship and harmony and having this church full of of people didn't it feel good man i just i just loved it and having people worshiping the lord together and i thought back to the origins of this church the first message church in tucson and and the heritage that this church has and it just it blessed my heart so much i uh i'll share a little bit about myself i look here and on a wednesday night usually we have a lot of the leaders in the church and a lot of the other folks um i know there's a lot of them sick now but they stream in but those that have their post of duty and they come on wednesday night and these brothers like look at look at the brothers matthew and jordan and all the brothers they do so much and maybe my sermon tonight would help some of you all in the ministries that you all have every person that's in this building has this is uh my friend brother mark is walking in there um mark is one of the ones look back at him back there mark is one of the ones that remember we had prayer some time ago i said i met two guys at the gym and they were having problems well i think that uh the the announcement came back to those marital problems was actually problems with brother marcus having problems with a girl and uh not he's not married to her and and the holy spirit really stepped in and helped brother mark and this is the group by the mark that i asked to pray for us and pray for you and when you asked me that and the lord did he stepped in and he gave mark the answer to the question that he had on his heart and sometimes when the lord gives you an answer it's uh it's not necessarily the answer that you want isn't mine but we we stay loyal to the lord and and mark has been and uh he's also become a good friend of mine it's good to hear you thanks for thanks for coming my friend i appreciate it but i was um i wanted to share a little testimony before i get started and i preached a sermon the other day at shalom at the israel post and it was a sermon that i had preached before and the first time i preached it really resonated well with the people and it was it was talking about have you heard of this this young man kyle rittenhouse the one that uh he got he was somewhere that he shouldn't have been and he ended up shooting three people and the riots and stuff i believe is in illinois and and he um was brought brought to trial for murder and the defense attorney presented his case and at the end he raised up with his client with this young man kyle rittenhouse and i identified with his lawyer and this young man was innocent now he did say if he could take it if he could go back and do it all over again he wouldn't have been there but he was there and he was and he did act in self-defense and this lawyer everything was on his shoulders and he stood up with his client and then the verdict as they were as the verdicts were being read i identified with this lawyer and i wondered what was going through his mind and it must have been i hope i said this right i hope i said that right because this young man that i'm representing is innocent and as those verdicts came forth the um not guilty not guilty and i think it was five times became not guilty the young man just fell down he collapsed weeping and i took that analogy and i brought it back to the closing statements that great men of god have made which is peter you know when peter when he's his closing statements just before he went to the cross he said listen to paul do what he says in paul's closing statements he says i am about to be offered up and he and and then even the lord jesus the lord jesus came up and he said lord forgive them for they know not what they do and and i tried to relate those in these closing statements and my point in saying it it went it was good the first time but the second time when i brought it to shalom it didn't hit the mark and it didn't resonate with the people and i felt like lord i i made a mistake i um i didn't say anything that wasn't true but it didn't resonate with the people and it bothered me really bothered me and i prayed about it and i felt like i got my answer and my answer was well you didn't pray about this sermon for this group of people and and the sermon that i preached was good the first time i preached it but for the second group it wasn't necessarily for them so i got a little bit out of the lord's will there and and it made me think and with all the leaders here we have to take the time to pray and we have to take the time to study this word we have to take the time to listen to these sermons and then the lord can use us we have to take in that holy spirit and it's not always just putting together a sermon it's maybe it's lord what do you want to say to me today and i i think that i have something special for this group tonight and i'll be reading a lot of the scriptures and i can't go wrong with these scriptures i want to i want to read from matthew 9 and 10 and i won't get there quite yet but matthew chapter 9 is one of the most powerful books most powerful chapters in this entire book and it is it is made up of a man jesus goes forth and he has a long day he has a long day preaching and praying for the people and and i want to go through these scriptures and um but first i want to say that that the ministry that this leads to that jesus leads to it's not necessarily a pastor in the pulpit and it's not necessarily an evangelist out there's each one of us have our own ministries and i want to do mention a friend of mine and i met this friend is probably in 2008. i was in the east african country of malawi and it is a poor very very poor country and uh i was going i was there on behalf of voice guide recordings and i met this uh the office manner introduced me to a man named john catali john came to me and and brother saeedy who's the office manager he said he wants to meet you meet somebody from the united states you know so i met i met john and john's first words to me was i'm not a pastor and he said he told me that he said my wife had a child from a previous relationship before we got married and this is before i ever learned about um the message and the bible and and what this is and he said he said but brother he says i feel as if i still have a ministry he says i don't believe that i could be called to be a pastor he says but i believe i still have a ministry and he started talking to me about what he had done and uh he um what he did is he took um i'll uh brother mark when i when i talk about i'm going to talk about a couple people and i'll refer back to them one one person i'll refer back to his name is william branham william branham was a he was a preacher that came along in the time of oral roberts and billy graham and back in the in the 1950s healing and charismatic revival in fact he's the one that started it so he he started he started this ministry and he changed the face of christianity and his message was come out of these denominations these denominations aren't going to get you anywhere all it is is a brand to separate yourself so he started this ministry and it did it shook the very foundations of christianity and it started a worldwide revival and and the other man that i that you'll find mentioned here a lot is a man named perry green and brother greene was a contemporary of brother branham he he learned um came up under brother brandman he's the one that started this church he was the original pastor of this church so just just a little background for you so when i when i refer back to them but there's john catali in africa he went and he started playing brother branham's recorded sermons to these to these uh natives and he started baptizing people not only was he baptizing people but miracles started following his ministry and he started telling me he told me this one story he says he says he went to this village he talked to the village head man and uh he said can i come in can i can i preach my message can i um play this short sermon that i have and uh and then can i i can pray for the sick or whatever the village head man says sure make yourself at home so he goes in and brother john preaches his message and then towards towards the end 14 people came to be baptized in this little village so john does the same thing the next day and another i wrote her down here i think it was 16 people another 16 people came to be baptized that day so the village head man comes to john and he says if what you're preaching is the truth my daughter is deaf and cannot speak he says if what you're preaching is the truth that jesus christ is today just like he was 2000 years ago here's my daughter so this young lady little girl walks up to john john lays his hands on her and he prays and then she starts hearing she's never heard before and she was born deaf she had never heard anything in her life and she obviously started hearing and brother john in the the crowd rejoiced and in the head man the dad rejoiced and uh brother john says wait he says she needs to speak and brother john says these these words he says where is the god of elijah laid his hands on the young lady again and she started speaking she didn't have to learn how to talk she started speaking the whole village gave their hearts to the lord jesus when i talked to john and this is about in 2008 he had already baptized 3 000 people and he's on the field today doing the same thing i haven't talked to him in some time but do you see he may not have had a certain ministry that we see as normal which is maybe the pastor of a church but he still had had a ministry and anyone can go out and preach this gospel and win souls to christ preaching the gospel may not even be in word it may be indeed and that's that's what i would like to get to in our scriptures here in matthew chapter nine now the day started and this is a long day for our lord jesus the day started and uh we find out that that he was on a boat and he came in a ship across the sea of galilee now if you've ever been there it's not a real big it's not a big ocean it's just a fairly large lake and he comes across and we see this parallels in luke we see in luke that it he was preaching to all these people he was preaching to doctors of the law he was preaching to the pharisees and these men were not only from galilee which where he was where he was but they were also from all of judea and even jerusalem so these were important people that this fame of this young man had gone forth and they were listening to him and many of those people were not listening to him for the best reasons they were looking to criticize so they were they were they were as he was preaching there was a big crowd and in matthew chapter nine verses one through eight there was a man that had the palsy now the palsy is paralysis so and this crowd was so big and we see in the same story that's told in luke they lowered this man from the ceiling because the crowd was too great and and they get they get down to the lord jesus and the lord jesus healed the man but first let me read it matthew chapter 9 verse 2 and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy laying on a bed and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy sun be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven me what a strange thing for this young man to say and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemeth and jesus knowing their hearts said what wherefore think he evil in your hearts for whether is it for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk jesus was saying a very simple thing there he says is it easier for me to say your sins are forgiven which is very easy anybody could say that or to say arise and walk and then we know what happened next then he said arise and walk and the man stood to his feet and then he departed his house and when the multitude sought they they glorified god and jesus went from that men from that place and he calls a man named matthew now matthew was a publican do you know what a publican is republican is a tax collector let me tell you how a tax collector made his living now we think he just collects taxes right the reason that they were hated so much is these tax collectors were jews and these tax collectors as they were collecting these taxes they would say okay jeremy you owe thousand dollars in taxes he looked on his ledger jeremy owes one thousand dollars in taxes okay jeremy that'll be fifteen hundred bucks it's like hey man i only owe a thousand no you owe fifteen hundred because i'm going to take the 500 and i'm gonna pocket it no no no no you know it's it's a thousand it's 1500 i'm only going to give you a thousand okay roman guards go take his donkey and his ox because that's worth 500 and it puts you out of business that's why this man was hated so much and that's what tax collectors did it was an absolute creep to the to the people to the jews and it was a jew selling out a jew working for rome and pocketing this money now this is a man that jesus calls all right so jesus passes by him and he says matthew he says come follow me so matthew gets up and matthew a child of god i don't care what you used to do i don't care how bad of a person you were a child of god stands up and follows the lord jesus and he goes so then we see what happens next is matthew invites these disciples over to his house all right now he probably had a really nice house because i assume he probably had a lot of money from what he was doing so he had this big house and he invited other tax collectors and he invited other people that were sinners what we would call sinners not the best people in the world he invites them and even let me read it here this is so important i think i think we should read it and when the pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why edith your master with publicans and sinners but when jesus heard that he said to them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but the sinners to repentance this is pretty cool what jesus did that right there so so when we read the bible let's not just read it and go on to the next verse so what jesus said he says he tells these pharisees remember who he's talking to brother and he's talking to the the priests man the the big guys and he says this he says why don't you go and learn what this means and then he quotes a scripture and this scripture says i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous to the sinners he was referring to a scripture in hosea hosea 6 6 which says for i desired mercy and not sacrifice in the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings so i i thought that was a nice little dig that jesus you're so smart why don't you go and learn what the scriptures mean so then in verse 14 he uh then came to him the disciple of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast often but thy disciples fast not let me read that again and i will put emphasis on on a name then came to him the disciples of john john the baptist saying why do we and the pharisees fast off but that thy disciples fast not what you think about that question who's who are these disciples they're the prophet of malachi 3 and the prophet of malachi 4 to turn the heart of the fathers to the children these are these are his disciples and they're coming to the lord jesus the one that he had already introduced on the jordan river when he said remember brother aaron he said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world they i'm sure they were there but oh john john yeah john we believe you we believe you john we'll just stick with what you say you know we'll just stick with you john john introduce them to the lord jesus and this this strange anomaly in the scripture is all over the place so he says this why do we fast and the pharisees fast but your disciples don't fast jesus said can the children of the bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then they shall fast now we see friends and i know all of you see it we've heard all these different interpretations and everything from the third poll to the return ministry to the tent meeting to the gospel going to the jews to the seven thunders and and all these different interpretations we've we've heard that have done nothing but separate the people that have done they have not resulted in anything but division and i hate that i just can't stand it it tears it tears my heart out of me to think of what has happened all these years and the division between the churches and we see that right there in john the baptist disciples and they're saying hey you're not doing things like us you're not having church like we think you should have church you're not doing things you're not dressing like you we think you should dress you're not you're not conforming to our image of what i'll say christianity is and you know what jesus says jesus answers this and he gives them an amazing answer he says this he says no man puts a piece put it the piece of new cloth under an old garment for that which is put into it that for that which is put in to fill it up and to fill it up taketh from the garment and is rent and made worse so what he's saying is sister marilyn you're a seamstress when you when you patch a garment if you have an old pair of pants and you put this brand new piece of denim in there that brand new piece of denim will shrink and you have this old these old pants and it'll shrink and it'll rip right around right on the seam because you have it it can't it can't stretch like like the the garment that can shrink and then he then he talks about and he says and then you put new wine in old wineskins then these bottles these wine bottles before they weren't made of glass they were made of of skins and you you they they get hard and old and then so that wine when you put it in there ferments and it degasses and it swells and if it swells in something that can't move it'll break and jesus isn't just telling a story here he's like you disciples of the prophet you believe the message of the hour you gotta swell a little bit you gotta move a little bit you can't be so hard and rigid because number one this ain't what john taught but number two this is not according to the law according to the lord and i hope that i can bring that right down to us we have to be able to swell and move a little bit with our doctrines we can't we can't be so rigid and say it's got to be this way and we put god in a box and you know what we do when we put god in a box we cast them out yeah so he gives us this beautiful analogy there and let's let's keep going here and uh brother lyle just texted me said amen love you brother lyle god bless you um he says and while he spake these things unto them there came a certain ruler worshiping him saying my god my daughter is even now dead but come and lay their hand upon her and she shall live that man's name is jairus we know from the book of mark tells the same story he was a ruler and he asked the lord jesus to come jesus arose followed him took his disciples with him and while he was on the road to jairus house now this is developing into a big day while he was on the road to jairus house there was a young lady that had a blood issue for many many years and she had it in her heart this man is so special he is so special if i can just if i can just touch his garment then i will be healed so as jesus is as he's walking by she comes up behind him and she just touches his garment it's probably his his cloak or or something that hung loose and she touched it she was immediately healed she was immediately the blood dried up right then jesus turned around and you know the story jesus turns around and he says this he says virtue has gone from me and she knew she was caught and then we have the dialogue between the two it doesn't say in the book of matthew but it does in other gospels especially in luke it says that jesus said virtue has gone from me now my point in saying that and spending this time and saying that is that virtue which is strength that came from jesus it left him and went into this lady and healed her and i ask you and i believe it's first peter chapter one or chapter two maybe it's second peter chapter one or chapter two we know the statue of a perfect man add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge on its temperature and then it goes up so this virtue that jesus had he had to have it he had to have it in the first place to give it out and friends we need it if we are going to be this bride of christ this church this chosen this elect of god we have to have that virtue brother we've got to have it or we don't we won't be able to give it out you have to possess something to give it and how do we get that virtue there's one time that i don't know where it is in the gospels but there was one time that they brought to jesus and this is after this chapter 10 they brought to jesus a boy that was epileptic and they brought it to him and and this is what they said to jesus they said your disciples could not heal this per this boy so they brought it to him and jesus's answer was jesus you have little faith he said how long am i going to be with you so then he casts out the demon the boy's healed and he gets up and he walks away and his disciples a little bit later they're like lord you and let's steal here how come we couldn't do that and jesus says this he says this kind only goes out through prayer and fasting this is the son of god that was speaking jesus he said i pray i fast there's one place that jesus prayed all night the son of god prayed all night imagine how much we have to pray so jesus sets the example he says this kind only goes out through prayer and fasting so we see on the way to jairus's house this woman with the blood issue touched him strength went out from jesus and healed her so now remember he's starting to get tired maybe so now he gets to jairus's house to verse 19. uh okay alrighty let's go to verse 22. but jesus turned about him and and then that's that's the um the sister that was healed verse 23 and when jesus came to the ruler's house and he saw the minstrels and the people making a noise he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn now jesus walks in and and they start picking at him and you know what he says he says get out of my way he says get out of here i got something to do so he walks in there and and this is at least three times in the gospels get out of my way he walks in there he was on a mission jairus daughter of course he raised her up from the dead the power of god once again picking at him though have you um there's a i remember when i was a few years ago i was i was watching a golden eagle through binoculars and some of you outdoorsman heath i know you love the outdoors like i do and every time just about every time you see an eagle when has anybody seen it i know you have you've probably seen lots of them when you when you see an eagle especially here in southern arizona or in arizona these eagles are flying they're big giant birds and there's always some little bird picking at him you ever see them doing that and they're dive bombing dive bombing them and these eagles are just going along their way and i was i was watching this golden eagle through the binoculars and and he was flying along and there was this little hawk and this hawk was pestering him down and up and down in and this poor eagle you know he's probably like man will you leave me alone i just want to catch a rabbit i'm not i don't want to mess with you but but this thing is just pecking at him and die vomiting and then that eagle turned over on his back stuck out those claws and opened his beak man it was like an f-22 raptor fighter jet man he flipped over there and that i mean if that hawk would have got close had been like a meat grinder you know but he swerved off and then came right back the eagle turned over and just started going didn't do him any good didn't do that eagle any good at all to show him his goods to show him his business and that hawk just kept on pestering him and kept on going finally the eagle just kept going flying and the hawk gave up and here we see jesus doing the same thing and i think as christians a lot of times it happens to us we're trying to do something right and the devil is always picking us picking on us i believe paul it was that said that when i would do good evil is present with me and can you testify to that when we're trying to do something right we're always getting picked at and but continue on and jesus jesus did that here so let's continue on nobody's picking at me thank god um and then jesus jesus had healed jairus daughter and the fame went about and then and when jesus departed that house verse 27 two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us and when he was coming to the house the blind man came in and jesus saith unto them he's getting tired it's a long day brother aaron he's getting tired and i so love his words brother you can put it up there i so love the words that jesus said these two blind men come in and he says this he said believe ye that i am able to do this what a wonderful statement and friends i ask you whatever you have need of do you believe that he is able to do it oh i just it was just precious to me i could feel jesus and he looked and remember he's 30 years old he's a young man he says do you believe i'm able to do this do you really believe and they said yay we believe yes we believe they were healed right there and when they departed fame spread about the country verse 32 and as they went out they brought to him a dumb man possessed with the devil a man that couldn't speak possessed with the devil and when the devil was cast out the dumb spake remember my story about brother john at the beginning same holy spirit that was with our lord jesus right here and the multitudes marveled but the pharisees said he casteth out devils through the prince of devils you know i'm sure he got sick of it flying along but he just continued on the way he was going and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the the people now friends this is the point that i wanted to make now when jesus was here we we hear so much about ephesians chapter 4 in the fivefold ministry now that fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the body of what christ the body of christ so jesus and him only exemplified the entire five-fold ministry because it was his body so we look in ephesians 4 12 says it's for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body and we see that jesus acted as an apostle many many times but he acted as an apostle matthew 23 when he said woe unto you scribes and pharisee hypocrites and he corrected these pastors these ministers he corrected them doing the work of an apostle then we see in a pr the work of a of a prophet in matthew 24 when jesus said that verily i say unto you that there now there shall not be left here one stone upon the other that shall not be thrown down that's the temple he was prophesying he was acting in the office of a prophet he was prophesying and then 80 70 we see i believe it was uh what was his name titus the emperor titus came down destroyed the temple big piles of stone everywhere he was an evangelist when he met the woman at the well the samaritan woman he was an evangelist when he as i just said when he called matthew from from his tax collecting booth and he was a teacher in most of his ministry jesus's most of his ministry was in the teaching realm bringing this new gospel this new way of thinking saying if somebody smacks you on the cheek turn the other cheek and let them smack the other side that's odd that was never preached for 4 000 years no what you do is you cut their hand off or there's an eye for an eye or you know this and then evangelism started and so jesus brings this strange new doctrine through teaching of loving your enemies you killed your enemies in the old testament but you love your enemies now but here the tired young man that jesus was he had the office of a pastor right now we're looking and jesus was tired he sat he he maybe had sat down it's a long day he had been picked out all day he'd been preaching he'd been healing the sick strength was coming out of him and this is all one day he was tired and there was still so much to do i remember a book of hebrews it says that he was not a high priest that could not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but he was in all points tempted as we are yet without sin so every problem that we have jesus felt it he knew how it was to feel he knew how it was to be tempted by sin yet he overcame it makes him far greater if he would have been an angel he'd be like well you never you never had that desire jesus but he did he was a man and yet he overcame and he was there and he was tired and he looked upon all out here he looked out and he said this but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd then saith he's to his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few now watch the office of a pastor pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest he's asking for prayer pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send for his laborers into his harvest i feel so bad for him he was there and he was he was looking out and he was seeing all these sick people and he had healed probably hundreds in that day and he was seeing all these people that were lost and there's all these people throughout tucson let's say there's all these people that have left this very church and he looks out upon this and he says pray that the lord will send laborers to help them i'm just one man i can't do it all by myself pray for these people but then something happens the day of pentecost and that spirit of that one man went into many 120 in one shot but do you see that spirit that burden that he had for the people and i don't have time but i would like to um i would like to read um through matthew chapter 10 but again i'm sorry i i don't have time but um what happened in matthew chapter 10 was jesus takes his disciples and he sends them out and he says this in in matthew 10 5 he says this he says go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans energy not so what he's saying here he's like that time's going to come and we know that that time did come in the book of acts but he says but first go just our people just to maybe the tabernacle just to our families just to our group let's just go out to them first and then later on he says he says yeah and he says and if you bring your gift into this church or if you bring your gift into this house and they don't accept you he said shake your garment wipe your shoes and take your gift with you if these people refuse that gift that comes into the church we don't want you we want god that's in our box we want we want things this way and this is the way a church should be run this is the way a home should be run this is the way christianity should be we don't want you jesus said go and then and then he says to the disciples and you know they were thinking well nobody's going to accept us now what do we do and he's like listen i promise you there's plenty of work to be done you're not going to finish it before the holy spirit comes but now get on your horse and ride get going do do these things and then they did and jesus jesus is instructing them and it comes to the close of my sermon here and the sister on the piano you can come and brother um it'll be aaron but towards the end of matthew chapter 10 verse 41 and jesus is instructing these disciples to go out to heal the sick to cast out devils to preach the gospel to bring these sinners to christ and he says this he makes this statement matthew 10 41 he said he that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward now if we brother if you put up that quote from brother branham somebody asked brother branham about that scripture they said this they said brother branham if you have time please explain matthew 10 41 i would like to know what is the prophet's reward and brother braham says well now jesus said whosoever received the prophet the name of a prophet shall receive a prophetic reward a prophet's reward is to be a friend with the prophet whosoever receives the righteous man in the name of righteous man receives a righteous man's reward and and he says he goes on and he says and if they want to know what a prophet's reward is is to be a friend of a prophet that's a reward he's your friend like the shunamite woman remember elisha like the shunamite woman it might come in handy sometime and it did with her see watch god's servants now my dad passed away um last year and we were recently a few weeks ago i have a group text with with my brothers and my sister and my um they said well what do we want to put on dad's headstone you know mom has her side over here and then dad has his and i think it was my brother jeremy suggested matthew 10 41. and i was sitting back and i was kind of rejoicing over that brother aaron i was thinking you know my dad was close with brother branham you know he was my grandpa was if it wasn't his closest friend it was one of the top couple uh closest friends that brother brandon had and i was just i was just kind of rejoicing and i was thinking yeah my dad was he was a friend with that man that as great as he was my dad was his friend and and it made me i was just feeling good and then something seemed to say to me but there's two ways to look at that scripture and i would present it to all of us come on brother i would present it to all of us that are you the one receiving that prophet's reward or are you that righteous man that righteous woman that prophet are you the one that's giving that reward i want to be the one that's giving. i want to give out my friend daniel martinez and um in new mexico he uh he says this he says brother daniel he says when i die he says i want to be completely empty he says i want to give everything that i got and i would ask all of you brethren that are here today let's give everything that we got for this gospel let's walk in the light of the gospel and let's give it out amen let's all stand let's uh let's pray lord jesus we are grateful we're grateful that as you've been so good to us and lord as these disciples were commissioned to go out lord we even have something greater than they have we have jesus christ living inside of us we pray lord that that we could be that righteous man's reward or that prophet's reward to someone else we pray that we could be the light to many people we pray lord that as we believe that this sanctuary here is welcome to your angels we pray that it would also be welcome to your children father we're grateful for your love to us we're grateful for this great matthew chapter 9 and how i love it lord i've read it over and over and it just blesses me so much every time i read it all that the lord jesus did when he was here and when he looked out across the people and he he truly said the harvest is plenty but there's just so few people to do it father we pray that we could take our position as one of those laborers in your harvest father all those that are sick once again as we prayed earlier we pray that your hand will be upon them in jesus name we pray amen god bless you my friends i it's been a blessing to uh to minister up here and i pray that something that i said will encourage you i love you all i think that you are precious just the salt of the earth the greatest people on the face of the earth is if you ask me god bless you there [Music] [Music] walkway [Music] shine all around us by day [Music] permission to do what i'm gonna do he shared some things with me and in the change that he's gone through from where he is to where he is now there are people that are going after him they're just they just pick at us okay they're texting him they're calling him and they're saying how could you do this how could you go to the other side and he shared his heart because he feels god has done this so as a congregation i want us just to pray because it's it's he's well known it's a name that is known and i think we could we could bear each other's burden this way so that's just our hands lord it's my brother daniel shared his heart [Music] didn't anyway stand up here and say look at me what i am but rather who we are we're all part of the body of christ lord and satan would like to come and and and destroy the confidence in what god is doing what you're doing through our brother daniel in people when they see that and they would they would be critical they would be saying damaging things and it hurts as a human to hear these things so lord we ask you to give them grace and strength and to follow that leadership they're calling in his life to do what you want him to do [Music] even as you cried out over jerusalem as you said there you said oh jerusalem oh jerusalem how oft would i have gathered you it hurts you and it hurts us too lord so strengthen our brother his wife his family lord and even his his brothers and sisters who may at this time not understand but may the love of god go through all of them because that's what it takes in all of us lord so as a congregation lord we ask that you would do that for our brother daniel lord and may the peace of god just rest with him is our prayer lord we ask you in jesus christ's name amen god bless you thank you [Music] shine all around [Music] jesus [Music] it takes courage to stand and do what brother daniel's been doing but he shared his heart with us and he says i just i love the people and i'm tired of seeing the divisions and the breaks and this that the other we all we all we would love to because you know when when your body begins to fight against each other what happens to you you get sick you hurt you fall apart but when the body is working in unity every part doing its part there's strength in it and also let's let's just do that together so it's just a couple of reminders this weekend brother joe adams and his wife i don't know if any of the children are coming but i know brother joe adams and his wife we're going to be here ministering sunday morning sunday evening and then on saturday at 1 30 tucson time the memorial for sister lori tamlinson the family will be at up at flagstaff tabernacle and it will be on live stream for those that can't go www.flagstaff if you would like to to do that and keep the family in prayer it's um well everybody's there with you and they're encouraging you and they're it's easy but when you're quiet times and alone times it's a lot harder so keep the family in prayer at this time so also um brother sam parker which is the pastor of the church and my daughter nina and son-in-law stephen were attending he may be on the road now he's bringing his truck with fall and his trailer with all their belongings and he was going to try to leave early and be here tomorrow so he may be on the road now coming from wichita kansas to tucson and steve and nina and my daughter rachel's back there are going to start driving this way tomorrow morning and there's been quite a bit of snow going through that area in icy roads so the lord would keep them safe and bring them here possibly with us on sunday brother sam parker wanted to be here but he couldn't have get anybody to cover his service so he's going to go straight back to cover sunday morning service so we'll remember them and i i say at that time oh to be young again they can do that some of us couldn't but when he's called to pastor for a church and the desire for his people and his congregation is a strong pull so we'll remember him in prayer in that show and then sunday morning here at 10 and and at five o'clock and bring your lick of fire because you're part of the body let's draw with what the lord has so appreciate the word of god today i love the
