doing that what may look like a terrible situation yet God can glean a life and a soul from it and you that's what we're trusting we don't know the the mind of God in that aspect but we trust that

received from being at this church and uh not the least of those is the friendship that I've developed with that man right there he's been a blessing to me and and now getting to know his family um he's a true minister of the Gospel his heart's in the right place and uh I'm standing shoulder toosh shoulder with you man we're going to get this job done while uh while we're standing let's open up our Bibles to the Psalms and uh let's turn to Psalm 40 asked uh little Elijah which one did he want me to read out of Psalms or Mark and he he said he said Mark so we're we're gonna read out of both is that okay Elijah is that all right with you brother all right Psalm 40 um verse 9 says this I have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo I have not refrain my lips oh Lord thou knowest I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation I have not concealed thy loving kindness and thy truth from the great congregation amen obviously that scripture is talking about testimony and and let's let's move to uh The Book of Mark and um this is a familiar story let's turn to mark 5: 19 and it says this and I'll give a little explanation of what's going on here after I read this read the Scripture it says this it says how be it Jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee and hath had compassion on thee amen you can you can take your seats so Lord Jesus when he said that he was talking to what we call the maniac of gadera or Legion and what happened is Jesus had count casted the spirits out of him they went into the swine the swine went off a cliff and killed themselves and then Jesus was he was in his right mind and he came before the Lord and Jesus instructs him go tell people what happened to you and the greatest testimony the greatest thing the greatest witnessing tool that we have brothers and sisters is our ability to tell what the Lord's done in our lives and um I'd like to give a testimony brother Jordan I'm going to switch to my lapel mic here I'll give a testimony I want to have brother Paul get ready and we're we're going to start this service off with um with a a pretty incredible testimony a pretty um incredible thing that happened to brother Paul and I'll preface it with uh a few Services ago as a Sunday morning I was um I was ministering and I felt to go down and I like to when I pray a lot of times I'll like to go down on this this area right here so I'm a little bit closer with the congregation and as I walked down I got down to a place right about here and I had a very very odd feeling I walked and I felt like there was someone right here and I even looked it startled me and I I looked and there was no one there I didn't have this a great sensation I didn't have didn't feel that there was a lot of power there I just felt like there was someone standing there and I came down and we prayed with the congregation right here brother Paul come on up I we prayed with the congregation um right here and then uh we dismissed service and I went out where I usually go and um was was fellowshipping with the people and brother Paul meets me right over here and he tells me he says um can I can I talk to you for a minute I had something very odd happened to me and I said I said sure So brother Paul and uh and I we we go off by ourselves and uh he said he told me the testimony of something that he saw and I told him I said brother Paul was it when I stepped down the stairs and brother Paul looked at me a little bit startled he said that's exactly when it happened so now I'd like to now that I've laid a foundation did I tell everything right okay so I'd like to turn it over to brother Paul and then he can give the testimony of of what he saw let me get my notes Here can everybody hear me okay um do we have that that video available you want to go ahead and get that ready um so what I told Brother Daniel was that um I I saw when we were all worshiping at that moment and uh after I think it was after this the worship was over I I I opened my eyes and I saw brother Daniel down here on this lower platform and I thought that was odd but prior to that I had seen a man a small man in white robes and shoulder length hair walk up to the middle platform and I didn't I didn't feel I mean it was there was a wonderful presence during that worship but it wasn't in seeing that that I felt some real real powerful anointing con to confirm that it was our Lord but that's what I thought when I saw him so when brother Daniel um and I spoke um I think it was later that day or probably the the day after he sent me the link to to the video um from that service and I just I think we saw as kind of a confirmation as well um that something definitely took place but if you want to go ahead and play that just I wish I wish we could I could say that we're going to see a supernatural image of the Lord but amen do you feel good about what he's done for you let's go ahead and back up family just a little bit done but notice how he he skip the video skips we don't know exactly what happened but he the video there's a skip some some Gap in there and it happened right around the same time I'll add a little bit to it so brother Paul tells me this and I I said you know I said you know what happened is I felt this like there was somebody there so it got me thinking so I said you know I'll go back to the video and look at it and I scrubbed all the way to this point right here and I said okay this is this is when it was happening and I was going to watch my body language because I jerked um I could when when it happened I jerked like there was somebody standing there because it's it kind of startled me so I was looking for that and I really believe that whatever it was there did not want to be photographed it didn't want to um didn't want to be shown but what Watch What Happens and this has never happened brother Jordan I don't know of any time that we've ever had a video that just stopped for a few seconds and then started again but watch [Music] this amen do you feel good about what he's done for you your family what he's done from the beginning of time so I took that as a confirmation um I have never I I've had experiences where I have seen things but I've never seen the Lord like that before um and that was a that was definitely a very um very powerful service for me and I I feel it was a confirmation uh that we were we're all on the WR the right path amen and uh God has been teaching me um through this all uh a lot of patience because I I feel like we all maybe have different expectations and we want to see things happen a little quicker but God is right on time amen and uh anyway so a couple of weeks after this experience um I had something else happen and uh I like I like to write I like to write down um whenever the Lord is showing me stuff and I I felt impressed I had been feeling impressed for about a week last week um or prior to that to just really uh take the time to write this burden out that was on my heart and uh I finally wrote it out and that particular day um that particular weekend um the the enemy was really attacking me and so Sunday I had to to stream in because I was I didn't want to bring any sickness among you all and uh I was so excited after the message was preached because I so I had to call Brother Dan and I said hey I'm going to send you an email um I think I got part two so I sent him the email and uh after he read it he asked me if I wouldn't mind sharing it so um as most of you all know this is not a my favorite spot to be I'd rather be where you're at listening to someone share their testimony but um I don't like to have just like the rest of you we don't like to have the the spotlight but uh so so Lord willing um I'm going to share this with you but uh just ask for your prayers help me to get read this uh in such a way that um it will be anointed because I don't just want to share some notes right I I want it to be um given to you and the spirit was given to me um but I I titled it Discerning the Lord's body and showing you by and by you'll understand why I showed you this stuff the video and the earlier testimony not long ago brother Dan shared a story of Zachariah father of John the Baptist being told by the angel that his prayer had been heard it was an old prayer likely prayed so long ago that had been accepted as a no Zachariah had made a request so long ago ago that he had forgotten all about it but God had not he had a timing that was absolutely perfect and now was time for the greatest Prophet to ever live to be born in that very moment when brother Dan was sharing that story I felt a striking Sensation that put put a fire in my heart as if the Lord was telling me that a prayer that I'd forgotten all about would soon be answered my only question was what prayer so with great anti anticipation I waited a week or so later it happened while in church suddenly I saw the Lord Jesus and his people not anyone specifically but like a blanket that covered all I'm not entirely sure how to describe what I saw but that old prayer from a very long time ago was concerning foot washing over 24 years ago IID earnestly and fervently asked for a deeper understanding in Revelation of what Jesus was asking us to do to one another at the time like most most students of scripture I could give you the right answer but knowing the answer and having it drop 18 in into the holy of holies are to entirely different things um in addition what I saw was sort of also um later on it struck me when the prophet talked about how he had seen the veil of blood that he described it in one one sense as being a rainbow I didn't see I didn't see my brothers and sisters I saw Christ amen and I have to tell you that it has it has really transformed my attitude towards you I I have I have a deeper uh longing to serve you um and not just my fellow brothers but I've always for for the longest time I've had a burden for people outside our four walls I I want I want to to share Christ in this awesome gospel with the world but it's I was amazed and humbled at what I saw it was the Lord Jesus and his people a beautiful spotless pure woman the Bride of Jesus Christ I felt such a mixture of feelings but overall I wanted to honor and serve the Lord and his people the scene comes to mind where Jesus spoke to Saul asking why persecutest thou me prior to that moment I supposed that I wasn't exactly a Critic of the body but I also wasn't a huge fan I hate to say it but I honestly haven't been viewing her through the blood and that's not something you just muster up either you have it or you don't and if I'm totally honest I don't I know that I had to do some repenting for not Discerning the Lord's body I wasn't serving her like I should have not long ago my heart was just longing for a renewal of the joy of my salvation my eagle eyes had been filmed over I wasn't lost but my joy was a week or two after having asked that prayer it happened Joy struck my heart as I saw the amazing grace of our Lord Jesus Christ it suddenly became fresh again the only sin Jesus had was ours and the only righteousness we have is his yes amen a w toer what a beautiful wonderful gift when you see it you don't just see it for yourself you see it for all John was in heaven when he wept with profound sorrow because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look thereon we know where he was but when was did this take place I don't know for certain where this moment fits in time but I have to imagine this is where we were the lamb slain before the foundations of the world before the Plan of Salvation was unveiled we know John wept because none of us were good enough but for the longest time I didn't understand just did John somehow forget the cross the Resurrection the Ascension of our Lord Jesus could it be possible he was there before the foundations of the world seeing the plan unfold seeing that no amount of consecration prayer devotion speaking in tongues dancing in the spirit adherence to dress codes rules dreams Visions Miracles or holy living was acceptable not by a million miles I think John was where we all must come a place of utter Despair and knowledge of being lost you simply must know that you are and to totally and completely lost before you can be saved one of the Elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof John and the rest of the Heavenly hosts went went from weeping and despair to the most powerful worship service you ever witnessed Salva salvation produces Joy pure and simple and if Grace isn't amazing if Grace isn't so amazing that you you see hope and salvation is offered to any and all perhaps you've become a modern leodan Pharisee you can't sit in the seat of the scornful and the seat of Grace at the same time it just isn't possible either you're sitting next to the accuser of the Brethren or the Merciful Savior a few days later after this experience Jesus opened my eyes of understanding a little more he let me know that foot washing was also found in scripture in the form of an allegory my mind excitedly raised as I searched my heart for something something I couldn't think of anything as I but I couldn't think of anything I was about to search the scriptures to see what it had to say about feet when suddenly I saw the woman with the alabaster box she washed the feet of our precious Lord Jesus with her tears and anointed him with a very costly ointment and this infuriated the self-righteous Pharisees this man if he were a prophet would have known what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner the Pharisees always very quick to find fault they're expert fruit inspectors but Jesus never told us to be professional spec finders Jesus said Beware of false prophets amen which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they're ra raving wolves you shall know them by their fruits in another place Jesus said take heed and Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees the disciples thought he was talking about the actual bread until finally they understood that he B them not be wear of the leaven of the bread but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees we are to know the voice of the great Shepherd so well that when that we will not follow after the thief Jesus answering and said to him unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he said sayth sayith on Master there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 p and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which one of them will love him most Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most he said unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no food or no water for my feet but thou Hast washed but she hath washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman says the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment therefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body taking the wine and the bread is for ourselves but foot washing is for others foot washing is loving and honoring and serving Jesus Christ in the body and we see this beautifully Illustrated in the scene as said so many times before you can't help someone until you help yourself and I have a a picture here of the mask that drops down in the aircraft the so many of us have seen Grace is only amazing if you were First lost but now oh my now you are found notice how Jesus highlights that the volume of your love for Christ the body is a direct reflection of the grace we have receiv received you love and live for others because you have been loved and accepted by Jesus Christ by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another and the story of the woman with the alabaster box we see a sinner the church the body of Christ washing the feet of Jesus the reality of our sinful past and the need for Mercy is vivid but even more so is the reality of his M His Amazing Grace we members of the body of Jesus Christ are not dis delusional or self-righteous we know what a Wretched Man that I am however we also we are also very much aware that this free gift was not merited and it's for all who choose to believe we wash the feet of the Saints in loneliness of Mind as we esteem other better than ourselves do you see it the body of Jesus Christ the church being displayed right before the dead critical scornful Pharisees the one doesn't make Jesus or the woman feel equal accepted or loved zero Hospitality or warmth they had fellowship with their own because they were definitely not going to rub shoulders with that lower class of people we know who they are we know they're fre FR they we we have standards and they don't can you see the Publican who would not lift up so much his eyes unto heaven but smoted his breath saying God be merciful to me a sinner in stark contrast we see the Pharisee in both stories as having a hottie judgy attitude clearly seeing himself is much better than these vile Sinners saying within themselves I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing but Jesus had another testimony of them the publican walked away Justified the woman was forgiven but the Pharisee of the Pharisee Jesus says knowest Thou not that thou art wretched miserable poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to be to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy knives with Isa that thou may see when we see this glorious gift of Salvation by Amazing Grace has a tremendous effect on our attitudes towards others when I first got it I was in church filled with the Holy Spirit and at that moment I thought everyone was experiencing what I was experiencing I thought I was surrounded by angels and guess what I was I was surrounded and filled with Amazing Grace but the test comes when the rubber meets the road and we fail and others fail this is where the seed proves what kind of ground it's in and unfortunately many people are a offended and they see a prostitute a dirty low down and worthless failure the joy of their salvation is gone and bitterness has taken root apathy criticism a lack of enthusiasm and appreciation for others sets in they're not going to serve anyone many are not Discerning the Lord's body as many as I love are rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent amen so what what are we repenting of as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially them who are the household of faith amazing to see how this is is being written this all came to me in a matter of seconds but writing it seems so archaic and primitive it's taking way too long if only I could put my thought directly into your mind it would save a lot of time but here's the next piece of the picture and it's literally a picture this is uh forgive my artistic crudeness here but originally when I I drew this picture it was intended to I I was I was wanting to do a children's book that would illustrate salvation in a very simple way and I heard my son Elijah talking about a rock star um that obviously had gotten some thoughts or ideas from school and so here in this image you see um that Fountain is a representation uh of the Manifest presence of God in in heaven and this is the moment where [Music] Satan decides that he's more attractive than God is that all the Angels should follow after him so you see the disapproving angels and you see those that are caught up under Satan's anointing and I have to admit that almost every time I see this it has a a really profound impact on me that I can't put into words um I see how terrifying and how horrific it is that in the very presence of God I mean we can't even imagine how awesome it would have been or would be I mean right now there Holy Angels worshiping God um in a presence that we can't even fathom or imagine and yet in that awesome holy presence Satan decided that he was the man of the hour it's not about you if I could title that image that's what it would be t uh titled it's not about you thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty th thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee a a couple years ago I wanted to try and express I wanted to put together a children's story that would plainly show the path of Salvation I wanted to start by showing the fall in heaven and although the sketch is crued contains a powerful message we see the moment where loose forf the Manifest presence of God is represented as a Fountain of Living Water I apologize for repeating but right there in the Holy sanctuary of the most high Satan takes the attention off of God places it on himself he became the main attraction he robbed God's platform and Satan became the main character in his delusion in his delusional fantasy his Fake Make Believe Hollywood movie everyone else including God became supporting actors or even worse yet extras living props there to just fill the space we can see the angels that are following Satan and those who disapprove but how does this fit into Discerning the Lord's body how does it apply to foot washing regardless of the role or part we play preacher song leader deacons praying or even something is simply greeting one another in the church we are not the celebrity we are not the star or the main attraction Jesus Christ is and if Grace is still amazing you see Christ when you see others it's not about you it's not about me we need to realize that whether we are shy awkward or reserved or extremely confident that's the results of being being self-conscious but but guess what you're not that important it's not about you recognize whose presence you're in and honor love and serve him in his people apply the same Grace over others that you see in yourself without even trying you already are your attitude towards others is your attitude towards Christ evaluate your reflection what do you see if you see if you don't see Amazing Grace you'll see something else and your story will be very similar to Satan's and those miserable religious Pharisees who did not show honor Hospitality or love in the pre to the presence of Jesus Christ what we need and I'm not talk and I'm talking about every single one of us starting with me is a gold oldfashioned heartfelt repentance as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will and will s with him and he with me let's open the door wash his feet and break bread together there's nothing in the world that is greater let Grace become amazing again be surrounded by Angels again we can't work this up or produce it it will take a sovereign move of Jesus Christ that comes from repentance and prayer then going to church won't be a duty worshiping won't be a duty no more than loving your spouse is a duty when this when this first became real to me nobody had to ask bribe or beg me to come to church or raise my hands or worship it was real all we have to do is seek him and you shall seek me and find me and you shall search for me with all your heart when you when you shall search for me with all your heart God bless you amen I think Brother Paul's testimony there can be summed up in this he said he said you must understand that you are completely lost first before you can truly be saved and I know I always say that it's not it's not about you it's not about me and and we are far too important in our own eyes and we should in our own eyes lessen ourself lessen our importance but let me tell you that we are very important to Jesus Christ so much so that he died on the cross for each one of us that's how important we are to him but to us no to ourselves we should lower our importance to ourselves and start serving other people and get people to this Jesus Christ that we preach I uh I did appreciate thank you appreciated that brother Paul um sister hope if you would if you would come forward with a with a testimony and a song um brother Paul was uh we showed that that video and it was it was a I think it was just a it was a confirmation to us that it felt so good we had such a great service and then we I felt the presence up there and then when brother Paul said he saw that Vision or image or or whatever you want to call call it it uh it blessed me but I don't think that that the Lord with social media and the way all things happen I don't think that um he necessarily wants to be photographed like he was in 1950 in a in a picture that couldn't be couldn't be duplicated it couldn't be faked an actual picture of the holy spirit in the pillar of fire over a man and that that picture is the one that we point to and that that picture really happened it was a real thing sister hope um I wanted to share my mom was talking to me yesterday about this brother that the Lord opened his eyes that the Holy Ghost is a person and it struck me because he he came in our hearts when we when he gave us the Holy Ghost but we put him so far away like he's someone we can't see but he's right here in our hearts and if we treat him like he's a person and right here with us we wouldn't believe he wasn't with us but um I just oh my goodness it just really did a lot for me but I was thinking um brother Daniel wanted me to share the testimony of what happened to me when I got snake bit when I was little I was two years old and me and my sister were outside barefoot and by the house and it was up on blocks because my dad built it and we didn't have underpinning and um this a copperhead came out from under the house and bit my foot my sister she was a year older than me and she said o a snake let's move so we scooted back but it came for me anyway and bit my foot and um you know how deadly copperheads can be so my mom was freaking out and and she called my dad at work and had me loaded up in the car but I think it was that Sunday they had listened to perfect faith and my dad Faith Row in his heart and he just knew God was going to heal me so they came home he said we're not going to the hospital we're going to pray for her and so they prayed for me they went and found the snake and killed it and had me watch them bury it so that I knew it was dead and it would never bite me again and like three days later was my oldest sister's fifth birthday party and um they had me like trying to have me sitting down and everything and everyone was saying hope sit down sit down and you know that day I just felt like I had to run I had to run I couldn't help it it was just unbelievable and I ran up and down and up and down the driveway and and finally they got my dad and they said she won't sit down and they were getting upset and he said he noticed it was very unusual so he said he said um let her run so I ran and I ran and I ran and I I don't think I've ever run so much before Ever After but anyway the next morning my store is the craziest my mom said it was just the craziest blue green color and she knew that the Lord had let the poison come out in my stool and I don't even have a scar left our God is the same yesterday today and forever sometimes I think I'm in control and act [Music] soly facing problems on my own I don't know what's best for me [Music] my mistakes at times [Music] distur all the

testimony right here brothers and sisters I think that it'll be a blessing bling to you our brother has had it rough but he's standing strong with Jesus Christ good good evening everybody brothers and sisters um yes uh thank you Daniel and I have to say brother Daniel brother Paul his testimony prepared me for my testimony because of course I was you know like a little bit nervous and everything and I I was going to say of course don't look at me look at Jesus he is to is the one who who who saved us from Eternal damnation from our sins and so that helped me so much brother Paul when you said that it's not about us it's it's you know we're not that important I know I'm important to Jesus but that helped me so um and I don't want to say a few words in a in two hours either so I want to watch the clock um I talk too much sometimes and so but too I have to say real quick um I felt the Lord telling me to share this this morning and and also I wanted to say I'm leaving tonight to go home I just don't want to leave almost I've been so blessed by this Fellowship I'm so glad I came to Tucson and stayed here this month and a half and so I was reading my Bible this morning and I was in I was opening up to Psalms I a part of Bible I was reading and all at once it was very like strange almost like the page I had opened the page flipped it was not this one was my Bible at home the smaller one and it like as a puff of wind and the page flipped open to Psalm 122 and I was thinking had the door open like I do sometimes there at the Castro house when it's warm you know and because I'm used to the cold up home and here here it's warmer and so I looked and I was like I was thinking I had the door open I didn't so that it I felt the wind and I looked at at this Psalm and and it was I it was such a holy moment I just went on my knees because I knew it was God that it was Psalm 122 I wanted to read that off before I I give my well that's that's included in my testimony I guess you could say Psalm 122 it says let us go here is this I guess this is the right one yeah I think it would it might be brother well I was thinking it was a different translation but it's the same one the one you told me read it out of my book what would that that one is a little bit trans a little bit different uh there something okay I guess it's the same but I know it was Psalm 122 and now it it says I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord our feet shall stand within thy Gates oh Jerusalem Jerusalem is build it as a city that is compact together whether the tribes go up the tribes of the Lord unto the testimony of Israel to give thanks unto the name of the Lord for there are set the Thrones of judgment the Thrones of the House of David pray for the Peace of Jerusalem they shall prosper that love thee peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces for thy brethren for my brethren and companion sakes I will now say peace be within thee because of the house of the Lord Our God I will seek thy good and Psalm 121 just before that it was that page that it opened up and that's also that's very beautiful as well I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keep thee will not Slumber behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand the the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even forever more so yes I I I used to be Amish and uh I grew up Amish and I remember I was searching even when I was young I used to read the Bible I that the one summer I I just uh come out of school I just went to e8th grade and I was uh working the fields that summer my dad was working away from the farm kind of to support to make the payments on the farm and I remember I also read the martyr's mirror that my mom and dad had in their bookshelf it was in English and it and it and that has the history of all the Martyrs from the time of Jesus to now and it's it's this thick and it it graphically it tells of how they died and believe me Hollywood has nothing their movies their worst movies have nothing over the devil has used all means any means you can imagine and more to take down the Church of God and he has not succeeded right praise God and so um I read that and I remember the one summer I was working in the field with the horses and you would let the horses rest of course they got tired and then you'd go again and I would ask my mom for her little bible English Bible and the Amish encourage you like read it in German the mother language the Amish religion is so much like the Catholic religion very similar but just like any other religion it's it's evil like religion is evil and I read that Bible but I didn't ask many questions because you just don't when you're on especially in the community I was in it's known to be very dark even by some other Amish communities farther south in homes County who are a little bit more open and so I'd read it and then you know five minutes you rest the horse five minutes and I went again and I remember pondering it was just a new testament in English pondering as I would you know Drive the horses again I think like as I went through the gospels and especially through the Epistles of Paul you know the the Epistles that Paul wrote in John and Timothy and I remember pondering thinking how what this all meant and like this is so amazing I meant I remember the the the amazing feelings and the emotions and then when I read through Revelation I'll never forget that um the great fear like actually you you know awe and then also like just uh just awe of God and then real fear too because I I didn't ask anybody what you know what some of this meant but I and also we got gospel tracks into mail so I knew the real gospel the Amish have just gospel mixed with a lot of church rules and so I remember going up on my knees up in my room when I was like 10 or like 12 like between 10 and 12 years old many time sometimes I'd go up my room and I'd just pray I'd said Lord God I believe Jesus I believe that you died for my sins I believe that you came and died for the sins of all mankind and I believe you died for my sins and I just want to be saved and so after that I read the Bible out in the fields and I remember the struggles I would have and the one of the things that I'll never forget is when the devil now I know it was the devil it was not mental illness the devil used a scripture to control me or try to control me for like three years I remember where I was standing when I read the scripture that says all sins can be forgiven except the blaspheming except blaspheming the Holy Spirit and I remembered that great fear that just it just shot through me like what if I would but I never asked anybody later on when I asked even some of the Amish know that it's not interpreted like I did but the devil knows that too and he knew I was searching he knew I was reading the Bible that was when I was 13 and I was mocked some by my brothers and my cousin for reading the Bible and but God God saw God saw I was searching he he he knows he knows our hearts and oh I wanted that oh I wanted the faith that I saw those Martyrs who died for Jesus amen they died for Jesus gruesome deaths and it was for Jesus and so I remember I would think you know is it bad words you put in your mind like if you mistakenly think you know like like a a bad word cier word that I heard at you know at work or wherever you know I knew what bad words were and and I was thinking does that mean like if I think some bad words and then like if I just simply say a bad word against the Holy Spirit would that mean I have blasphemed Holy Spirit then and eventually uh later on the doctors diagnosed me with OCD but I know of course the de that Satan comes against us he he he comes against he he does that to us he he's and today that sermon today helped me just showed me again he is the accuser of the Brethren that's what he is that's what he is and so I I'll never forget the night when I was 16 I had also fallen into sin then and I was so disgusted with myself and I couldn't quit and I had read some Western books and it went from there and I remember the one night I thought I had gone too far and I came down I was pacing the floor and I was sure I had blasphemed the Holy Spirit now I I was I I was many times i' said maybe I had because I some bad words came to my mind and then the Holy Spirit and and just other things like that that I had the devil had convinced me that I blasphemed the holy spirit that night it was like coming to a point the guilt of the the sins the sins I was in and the blasphemed Holy Spirit finally that night I remember I'll never forget that night it was so dark and I I was like even my mom said no just think about the blood of Jesus like pouring over you she was the most open of our family always and I wanted to believe it that I hadn't blasing the holy spirit because I told her I I think God Blas the Holy Spirit I had not talked to anybody about that before and that night was so dark I remember I my whole life my whole view of Life changed from the night before till the next morning and I actually was demon possessed I think for a few days especially because that night I remember that Jaws it felt like the jaws of hell were totally open and I this is no lie it might seem ridiculous but I actually prayed that night that God would put me in a part of hell that was not one of the worst parts of hell because I remember reading the Bible that Jesus said the Pharisees will receive the greater condemnation I was so sure I was going to hell that I prayed for that and the next day my brother said I was up in the maple tree outside the house and I was laughing like a lunatic I don't even remember that day I just lost it I was there was no almost no doubt I was going to but I remember one thing that night I said God if there is a chance that I'm not going to hell I will do anything for you and I will I will do that I don't care what it what whatever God asked of me I will do I don't it doesn't matter if if it comes to the point where I have to die for Jesus I'll gladly do it because those next few years were like almost hell on Earth and I became an alcoholic to cover my pain and so long story short like I said I went with the Amish youth where it's accepted you go drink and you know be uh as kind of SE your Wild Oats what they call it and then you decide if you want to stay Amish or go out into the world and that's very Twisted too that's so it's so evil it's religion and so I was addicted to alcohol I was smoking I was overweight and all of that was to cover up the pain of I thought I was you know done for UND this Earth I was going to hell anyway and so I actually I became Born Again In I I I believe in 2009 it was in 2009 is when I I remember I was up in my room and I went on my knees and I said uh I prayed and I said I remember praying it was it was the first time it was not an anxious prayer it was a prayer and I believed it when I said I said Jesus I said I know I said oh god oh Jesus I know that you will help me that I know you can make so I can quit drinking and I believed it and I also I prayed I said Jesus I want to give my whole heart to you I believe that you died for my sins I I want I want to be saved I believe you died for my sins I give you my whole heart and I believed it that he would help me quit drinking and in the next month or so everything changed for me I I quit I uh quit drinking I quit smoking and I actually weaned myself off of the medication I was on and it was all because of Jesus it's all because of Jesus it's only him it's only him it's it's it's not me it's him doing his work in me in us it's it's and so I that those those were beautiful two beautiful years where I was just I had no thought of Leaning the Amish but it life was totally it it changed Jesus Jesus changed my life like he does for us he totally transformed my life and I quit drinking quit smoking I lost weight my health got a lot just everything and but then to I I want to keep my testimony uh down to it's already over 10 minutes so but it it's for three years I was it was so beautiful I'll never forget those years it was almost sometimes like paradise because I had thought there was no way I could like get out of this dark hole that life would always be like the counselors told me the worldly counselors you you just have to live with it but no now I see it with Jesus and by Amish like my aunt once asked me what did you do you're so different you're happy you talk and even I wasn't like I knew I was saved I was pretty sure of that but it's the homage religion is so it's so evil it's so deep and deeply religious but I knew enough that I was saved and so for 10 years um for for two or three years I was just it was I was walking with the Lord he was it it was wonderful and then I started believing the lies my own mom and dad told me once are you trying to be perfect better than us when I was on fire and I'll never foret that is why I hate religion I know exactly why brother brandham said what he did and why Jesus talked to the Pharisees like he did because it's so evil it is so evil it looks good on the outside but it's not there is a lot of sin going on and it's covered up but for 10 years that was three years it was wonderful for 10 but then I fell again and I went out the devil attacked me and those 10 years were I it was it was it was the the struggles were it it was almost hell on Earth it I mean I I knew I had lost somehow I had lost that joy and that peace I had lost that connection I knew Jesus was still there but I had lost that beautiful connection and and my I tried natural supplements I tried medication I tried almost everything that you can think about and it was up and down and then uh three years ago I was I said God whatever it takes I I only want to glor you to be glorified and I have so much pain just heal me just I just just want to glorify you I only want to follow you totally all the way and so something happened that I that I left the Amish I I had to leave home there and my brother and my sister opened up their home to me and they my brothers prayed over me and I'll never forget it I saw then that it was not I was not diagnosed with a mental illness I was not diagnosed with schizophrenia or anything it was the forces of Darkness it was the devil that was coming against me like he does all the children of God the accuser of the Brethren my brothers laid hands on me the am don't do that they laid hands on me and they prayed in the name of Jesus the darkness must leave the devil must go he is rebuked in the name of Jesus the name above all names and long story short I healed more in a year and a half than I ever had in 20 years and that was three years ago and then I and and people were amazed again how I healed and I believe God took me through that time I believe he took me through those 10 years after I after the devil I don't like to say that because I don't like to glorify the devil he tried but he did not succeed he he did not succeed Jesus Christ I like the sign there Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and I like the song only believe because truly I can't blame my parents I can't blame the people who mock me why because I if I would have kept on believing that's where the devil has no power right and so um so my brothers prayed over me and and I I I just saw the truth and then I saw that you can't read too much in the word you cannot read too much in the word the word is our answer is it's our life our hope it's everything Jesus is everything so to uh so that was three years ago and then I went through so much healing Jesus I felt the God showed me things that just wonderful but it's all about the Lord Jesus Christ and then I said God I'm with a fellowship right now where uh it was it's beautiful beautiful and and I they're they're anointed they have they've prayed over me they uh I I know the holy spirit is there it's n denominational Fellowship but I said God if there's anything more even if I think this is where you want me to stay I don't care what it takes show me and that's why I believe he show he led me to meet a brother this summer who introduced me to the message and now I know I believe that God sent a message for his bride amen the church that Jesus spoke through a Spoke through a man and he was same as me and you though he was ordained from the womb to be a prophet but yet God gave his his church the Bride of Jesus Christ a message and it's so beautiful and I was baptized in the name of Jesus this summer and all I want is to come to the fullness of of Christ and there again and that again showed me it's only Jesus it's only Jesus it's all about Jesus praise God so brother Josiah uh sister Katie if you would make ready and then after um after they sing then uh sister Jessica Adams do you have a song very very good um before I'd like to read a scripture our brother was saying I'm going to read a scripture and a quote our brother was saying about religion and and really religion has been a tool of the enemy from the beginning there is a false but there is a true James 1: 27 says this and it's this simple this simple brothers and sisters we want to make it so complicated we want to we want to have do you have to have these deep understandings and you have to have all of this the Apostle James pastor of the church in Jerusalem said this pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows in their Affliction and to keep him himself unspotted from the world it really really is that simple serve others stay away from the world and as our brother said put Jesus Christ first and brother martin has had Brother Marlin has had a hard time he's been pretty much shunned by his family and and by the people he grew up with and of course that's a very very difficult thing you can imagine us how how hard that would be for for us if the our people that we love the most would shun us would kick us out and and not be allowed to even speak to us but did you hear what our brother said wasn't my parents fault wasn't my brother's fault wasn't my friend's fault it's my fault so we can we can never blame someone else and the enemy one of the biggest tools the enemy has is to tell you that you have blaspheme the Holy Ghost it is it's around it's caused people I've seen people myself people that I have known have killed themselves one person in particular killed himself because he could not get past the F the thought that he thought he had blasphemed the Holy Ghost let me read this to you the prophet says this questions and answers he says someone asked this I have I have lived many years in sin until I found the Lord please brother brandom I have sinned again and am not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if I can be restored hold whole again yes you have not sinned my friends so far in God but what you could be restored if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you'd never want to be restored see but as long as there is something dealing with your heart you are still in the line of restoration am amen and that's from a higher office than I have praise God we didn't we didn't plan this song knowing what the testimonies were going to be about but uh part of the song says Jesus cares he cares for you and all your worrying won't help you make it through cast all your burdens upon the Lord and Trust again in the promise of his love I want to say just a quick word because it's a testimony night Katie and I moved here and we don't have any family here and I just want to thank

there's just a song here that uh that I learned uh when I was a young man uh about 20 years old um I don't want to think about how long ago that was but but it it was quite a long time ago anyway it's a song that uh that we've sung here once before and I better just be quiet and start singing [Music] yeah I searched and I search for the road that leads to Glory I wondered if I'd ever find the way I sat down to rest for my feet had grown so weary but then I Heard a Voice Within Me say you've got to Keep On Walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord I pray and I pray for the Lord to give me mercy wa for him to brighten up my way I was so afraid for the road became so lonely and then I Heard a Voice Within Me say you've got to keep on walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord and after a while I felt something going got close I stepped back up behind a great big column there and I said Heavenly Father what would you have your servant do it kept going [Music] was real still a minute and then I heard a deep voice say turn go back well I I turned and I went walking back down the street I walked and I walked on past the hotel on down through South Memphis just walking on and on was going walking along there I thought Lord I I don't know you said walk walk here I am I'm walking I just kept on walking walking walking walked out pretty near the other side of Memphis you've got to keep on walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord is that how you're walking Keep On Walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to Heaven someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord [Applause] all right we have a few minutes left does anyone want to raise their hand and give praise to the Lord for something sister Elizabeth God bless I just wanted to share a testimony about my brother and goes along with brother Martin's testimony I have to cry cuz my brother been Pelin for many many years and a severe severe alcoholic folks he's gotten so low that he was drinking mouthwash perfume cologne um just in a desperate desperate situation and he had alienated everyone from his life everyone he didn't have a place to live to stay um one day he was intoxicated he fell and he scraped his arm and his foot in a little other place in his body and then within 3 days he got really sick his limb started swelling and uh he walked to Circle K and he nearly collapsed and they called 911 and took him to the hospital so then they contacted my brother my my other brother contacted me and I went there and I have not had a relationship with my brother for many many years do you know he just didn't want really to do anything with the family family part probably for being ashamed and when I got there he was in desperate need of the Lord and medical attention so they took him into surgery and they cleaned up his wounds and then within hours they told me he had flesh eating disease and his limbs started being eaten I mean just he went into two surgeries they took almost all the flesh off his forearm up into his arm his foot they thought they were going to have to amputate it and you know I I prayed we I prayed with him that night and I asked him I said do you need to seek the Lord and you need to seek salvation for your soul first amen and then that the Lord will heal you from your alcoholism wow and he went my brother is the most um positive person I've ever met you know so much so that it's just you know click click you know you got to have a little touch with real so that you can really you know have a deep heart feeling and uh you know I'm not one to minutes words you know no never you know so I kind of laid into him you know I said you need to put a aside that false positivity and seek the Lord you know you're going to die you are going to die you know and so the Lord pretty really put a burden in my heart to visit him and I am not the most nurturing person no my daughter came that is just not my nature that you know to coddle people and but the Lord really put a burden in my heart to start visiting him weekly and you know and praying for him and my sister started visiting him also and just telling him if it wasn't for her and I nobody would visit him nobody there was no one to see him he just a nobody wanted to do anything to do with him so we just started praying and asking the Lord and and encourag him to seek the Lord and he was in the hospital for 30 days and then he went to a skill nursing facility and he really still didn't have a sense of how close he was to losing his life and I would just tell him you have this false sense of security that you're going to be well and you're going to go on with your life but you're going to continue to be an alcoholic if the Lord doesn't do something for you and you know I just and then he went to a rehab from there for alcoholism and one day I went in there and he had his false positivity and I said you need the Lord today you need to just put away that false positivity that you have and just dig deep you know and uh he started praying and asking the Lord and one day he went to the doctor and Doctor some we thought you were going to die and in that moment it clicked how close he was to death and he started really seeking the Lord he started reading his Bible and my sister took him some books from Brother mam sermons I took him some books U man sent from God and some other ones he started reading he started sharing with other people testifying of what God's been doing for him amen and because you never you cannot have a one-on-one without a counselor being on there and then he says I've shared with Amy you know brother Bam's life story and I said I encourage her to keep reading he called me yesterday he goes can you bring me some more message books because you know I run out of I've read them all and people are asking me for more books because if more people are reading and requesting and another person requested a Bible and you know we took another Bible from all the Bibles that we had and I believe the Lord is going to touch him you know and that and that is going to heal him and keep him CU right now he's in a very sheltered environment for rehab and then he's going to go to a step down and get kind of back into the society and just and I said you have to have the Lord in order to maintain your sobriety you can have AA all you want but if you don't have the Lord you're not GNA so please keep them in your prayer the Lord has really worked in his life and you know the Lord give me patience you know cuz you know it takes a lot for me to you know to help somebody you know and you know just keep us all both on my family we have a lot of people in our family who have backslid and the Lord was very gracious and call me back to the fold after 30 years here I'm standing thank you sister Misty is um she doesn't give herself credit obviously but she does have a burden this sister does she'll uh she'll call me and say this person needs a ride this now what are you going to do about it maybe not that bad but it's pretty much like that isn't it she does have a burden and she is willing sister Missy is willing to go the extra mile and do whatever it takes and I have seen that in her and that's when it produces results is when you are willing to do something sister Irma do you want to stay here or do you want to go up there and sing as sister Irma's making her way up to the front Daniel could you help with the microphone up there you can go right up there sis another testimony oh God bless you all I just wanted to talk about the Lord's timing and this is a testimony that I've had on my heart for a really long time and I always say oh we have one of those Services I'm going to say something that I never do because I get really nervous which is odd because in my old position I was a public speaker but somehow this always terrifies me some years ago um my husband and I were going to to meet family and go camping and a thought came to me uh and I asked my husband I said we were just looking and touring houses not really planning on moving but um you know just thinking about it talking about it and I I asked him I I said what would you think if if we did move then my mom moov into our house she lived about you know about 40 minutes away and we would see her you know a couple times a week and it was not a far drive but it would have been convenient for her to live closer and he said yeah absolutely so I called her and I said what would you think if you know and I start tell she didn't let me finish and she said yes yes I would love to move and I said okay well let's let's plan that with then so it I asked we had like a two-year time frame So within that two years um Nina my cousin um Nina V you might know her Nina Gara she was nanning for us uh full time and I was always terrified that whenever she moved away or decided she didn't want to then what would happen with our girls how would the Lord take care of them and he always had put someone in their place whether it's at school or preschool always Place someone there to to make me feel better and to take care of them so within that two years nah met someone and she was going to marry him and move away and that was so terrifying but the Lord was so sweet and so kind that Within in the month that she married my mom moved into the new house and everything just worked out there was the kids started a new school and there was someone there that um that I didn't know but my cousin my other cousin knew and she said she's so trusting and so loving and she's going to take care of the girls and she did and the Lord just placed everything in the right spot at the right time God and so whenever I think about my husband and his salvation I

there at Calvary and we're just waiting we're just waiting to see that day but it was done on that day do we have another testimony brother Heath sister Irma thank you beautiful song um I just wanted to share a little something with you guys today years and years and years ago I used to go to North Side fellowship and uh just like the little booth the brothers are at back here there is a booth there of course you know to handle all the electronics and everything and I just just I was having a lot of problems just a lot like I couldn't I it couldn't seem to get anything straight and and uh times haven't changed much but uh I had a key to the north side because I used to work on the air conditioners there so one day I went by uh the church I just wanted to pray you know I just wanted to you know talk to the Lord about our problems and we should really really pray for one another that's such a wonderful thing that I can say Hey Brother Dan or uh anybody else while you're talking to God could you bring my name up I mean what a miraculous thing that is but anyways I uh I was sitting in there I was praying and I was all by myself that room's dark when there's no one in there the lights are all shut off and everything and I just just sitting on a Pew and uh just like this one here and I looked up and above the vestibule over at North Side it says be still and know I am God but the projection system had came on the light it was just like an answer to my prayer we have it's like the brother said it's all about Jesus we got to take our burdens and the put them there and the problem with it is a lot of times is we take our burdens back we say Lord give me those I I'll I'll I'll I'll do it with it this way or don't do that give it to God let him have it let him straighten it out I can't tell you how many times I've faced something in the last couple of months and I've had to tell my girlfriend Missy just let it go watch it'll work itself out it's only the the Flint that's sitting there sharpening the knife and every time you get to come back you know where you didn't just react and get mad and I know I do that a lot I don't know about you I like to snap sometimes but I need people's help and I need people's prayers and uh of course you guys have mine but um just remember be still and know I am God [Applause] so Heath and I were buddies a long time
