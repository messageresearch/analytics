[4:58] brother Russ all the field make your way
[5:01] up we have one request
[5:04] asking from sister Shirley Moore asking
[5:07] to keep our sister Mercy somewhere on
[5:09] prayer she's still not doing very well I
[5:12] know my wife has spoke to her several
[5:14] times
[5:15] she's had not had much appetite not
[5:17] wanting to eat she was suffering with
[5:19] covid
[5:21] but our God is more than able so
[5:24] he's the same yesterday today and
[5:26] forever in fact
[5:28] David says in Psalms 91 we'll read those
[5:31] verses one through seven
[5:33] [Music]
[5:34] Psalms 91 is just it's an encouragement
[5:38] because it was it's it's still the same
[5:41] it still has the same effect it still
[5:43] has the same power
[5:44] he the dwelleth in the secret place of
[5:47] the most high shall abide under the
[5:48] shadow of the Almighty I will say of the
[5:51] Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my
[5:55] God in him will I trust
[5:57] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[5:59] Snare of the Fowler and from the noise
[6:01] and pestilence
[6:03] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[6:06] and under his wings Thou shalt trust his
[6:08] truth shall be thy shield and buckler
[6:10] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[6:13] by night nor for the arrow that flyeth
[6:16] by day nor for the pestilence that
[6:18] walketh in darkness nor for the
[6:20] destruction that wasteth that Noonday
[6:23] A thousand shall fall at Thai side and
[6:26] ten thousand at that right hand but it
[6:28] shall not come nigh thee
[6:31] amen it shall not come nigh thee what a
[6:34] protection we have
[6:36] so if you have a need you'd raise your
[6:39] hand and say Lord
[6:40] remember me as a as our brother Russell
[6:43] would pray and then I believe he's he's
[6:44] going to sing a song special for us
[6:47] thank you brother
[6:52] amen let's breathe in Lord how thankful
[6:55] we are for
[6:57] scripture we just heard here Lord what
[7:01] promises we have as your children Lord
[7:05] we're so thankful to belong to you and
[7:08] to be sheep of your pasture Lord and we
[7:11] want to
[7:13] we don't want anything to do with the
[7:15] Enemy with this
[7:17] culture and with this
[7:19] Satan's Eden that we're in the midst of
[7:22] Lord we have another kingdom
[7:25] Lord we want to lay up Treasures there
[7:27] in our heart's desire is we thank you
[7:30] for the thing that you prayed Lord that
[7:32] where you are we may be also
[7:35] Lord we want to fulfill that
[7:37] we thank you again for the promises in
[7:39] the word of God and
[7:42] we ask for this need that's been
[7:43] presented

[7:48] yourself the mighty deliverer on her
[7:50] behalf and
[7:51] for each need represented underneath

[7:59] thou knows the requests upon the hearts
[8:01] of your children Lord we pray you would
[8:04] answer according to thy Divine will
[8:06] ask your blessings upon the service this
[8:09] day upon each

[34:21] return unto my house once I came and
[34:25] when he cometh he findeth that swept and
[34:26] garnished
[34:28] then gothy and taketh to him seven other
[34:31] Spirits more wicked than himself
[34:33] and they enter in and dwell there and
[34:36] the last state of that man is worse than
[34:38] the first
[34:40] and came to pass as he spake these
[34:41] things a certain woman of the company
[34:43] lifted up her voice and said unto him

[35:13] night and uh I was so blessed friends I
[35:17] felt so good after our meeting last
[35:20] night and talking about these things and
[35:22] talking about some of the direction that
[35:23] the church is going we're never going to
[35:26] agree
[35:28] on everything in fact we'll probably
[35:30] never agree on any one thing except that
[35:34] we are all to serve this body in the
[35:38] best way that we can and I was just I
[35:41] was very encouraged last night got some
[35:43] really pertinent comments
[35:47] um I thought the spirit was good
[35:49] and um I just I wanted to thank everyone
[35:54] from the bottom of my heart I think we
[35:56] got a good thing going
[35:58] and I think that we are going to
[36:00] continue on and I have never been so
[36:03] excited
[36:04] as I am especially after last night
[36:07] let's let's keep her moving greetings to
[36:10] the visitors brother Cedric it's good to
[36:12] see you again my friend
[36:13] God bless you and all the other visitors
[36:16] I see a couple faces that don't readily
[36:19] recognize but welcome
[36:21] and brother Russell you and your family
[36:23] good to see you enjoyed the song before
[36:27] um I'll be in Mexico next week I have to
[36:31] go down for work I'll be there Monday
[36:32] through Friday so if people are if
[36:35] you're trying to text me I'll still get
[36:36] my text but I won't get them until the
[36:38] evening I'll check my emails during the
[36:41] week also
[36:43] um again I thought the meeting last
[36:46] night was really positive I wasn't
[36:48] trying to get the commitment on anything
[36:52] I was just trying to feel the
[36:54] congregation's spirit and I get a
[36:57] general direction on how the
[36:58] congregation was feeling and I was
[37:00] watching everybody as we were talking
[37:02] about things the things that I want to
[37:05] move forward immediately on are I want
[37:08] to get started on the upstairs room for
[37:09] the Youth sister Elizabeth Guerra I
[37:12] wanted to make sure she is getting all
[37:15] of the information for everyone with the
[37:17] birthdays and uh special how we contact
[37:21] you contact you phone numbers emails
[37:23] your birthdays and any other special
[37:25] dates that you might have so please get
[37:28] with sister Elizabeth and getting that
[37:30] information in
[37:32] um
[37:33] and uh then brother Jeremy and sister
[37:35] Angela moving forward on we're going to
[37:37] go ahead and book the the Family Camp
[37:40] for September I'm really excited thank
[37:42] you all for the all the work that you're
[37:44] doing on that I think it's going to be a
[37:47] real blessing to all of us to be able to
[37:48] get together for that camp
[37:51] so those are the immediate things in the
[37:53] next month or so we have communion on
[37:55] March 5th and um then you keep praying
[38:00] about it but that's probably that
[38:02] morning communion obviously is a supper
[38:04] so that's an evening service that
[38:06] morning is probably if we continue if I
[38:09] continue to pray that way I continue to
[38:11] feel led to move in that direction we'll
[38:12] probably take our first church offering
[38:14] uh on that morning
[38:16] I will be as I promised last night I'll
[38:19] be meeting with in the next couple weeks
[38:21] I'll be meeting with the officers in the
[38:23] church to talk about some of the
[38:25] finances like we discussed last night
[38:27] and uh I will uh Brother Andy had a good
[38:32] idea that I put together a document on
[38:34] some of the things what the word says
[38:38] about the the finances in the church and
[38:43] um
[38:44] do some research on it and put together
[38:46] that document so I'll I'll be working on
[38:48] that uh before
[38:51] one of the things that's very important
[38:52] and that we haven't discussed and that
[38:55] are is the church bylaws and we've uh
[38:59] but the Lyle has been helping me with
[39:01] that he's given me some ideas on that
[39:03] and I've taken but the why I was written
[39:06] I've written some stuff and then the
[39:08] Branham Tabernacle bylaws also so one we
[39:12] don't have to vote on everything
[39:14] but the things that we do have to vote
[39:16] on I really believe we have to vote on
[39:18] Church bylaws I think that needs to be a
[39:20] congregational decision so I'll put
[39:22] together a document I will get that out
[39:25] to the people that's going to be a
[39:26] couple months from now and not not right
[39:28] away and
[39:30] um
[39:31] that's uh so that's the direction we're
[39:34] moving I'm excited
[39:36] as as you can tell I was I was very
[39:38] encouraged after last night
[39:40] um
[39:42] we had
[39:43] a great service on Wednesday night
[39:47] uh Cedric was here with us
[39:50] um first is that's the first time you've
[39:52] come to this church right
[39:53] it was to me I was just blessed I was
[39:57] blessed beyond measure we just had a few
[39:59] people in here I think I counted 32
[40:01] people that we had in church but it was
[40:05] uh
[40:06] there was a spirit I felt
[40:09] that was with us what we did is it
[40:11] turned into it kind of the Lord I
[40:13] believe led to making it a little bit of
[40:15] a testimony service where we heard
[40:19] um I gave a couple testimonies which
[40:22] I'll be talking about a little bit this
[40:24] morning I'll be rehearsing those and uh
[40:27] and then we played the sermon where
[40:29] brother Branham gave his testimony about
[40:31] how he got his commission to go out and
[40:34] pray for the sick and then at the end
[40:38] um
[40:39] we we had a special another special
[40:43] testimony from Brother Arnie back there
[40:45] let me read you a quote it says here
[40:47] brother Branham said this in that sermon
[40:49] that we listened to brother Brown said
[40:51] do you all believe you all believe with
[40:53] all of your heart both of you he was
[40:55] looking at somebody out in the audience
[40:57] he's he said you accept it sir I tell
[41:01] you you too I see with your hand up the
[41:04] habit of smoking
[41:06] he said remember he never met any of
[41:09] these people
[41:11] he said
[41:12] quit doing that
[41:14] you smoke cigars you shouldn't do that
[41:17] makes you sick isn't that right if it is
[41:21] wave your hand like this
[41:23] that's what's upsetting you it's bad on
[41:25] your nerves throw nasty thing away and
[41:28] the TR and don't do it no more and
[41:31] you'll get over that and be all right
[41:33] and you're and your wife's heart trouble
[41:35] will leave her how do you know about
[41:37] that
[41:39] you believe that isn't that right I
[41:42] can't see you from here you know that
[41:44] but you're carrying cigars in your
[41:47] pocket in the front
[41:50] brother Amos where did Amos go um bro
[41:53] they must come up here for a second
[41:55] um I'm going to finish this quote in a
[41:57] sec
[42:04] go give that to brother uh Arnie in the
[42:06] back
[42:09] so he says this he says you believe that
[42:11] isn't that right I can't see you from
[42:13] here and you know that but you're
[42:14] carrying cigars in your pocket in the
[42:16] front that's right lay the things out
[42:19] and put your hand over on your wife tell
[42:22] God that you are through with that kind
[42:24] of stuff you'll go home well you and
[42:27] your wife will get well blessed be the
[42:30] name of the Lord Jesus so we heard that
[42:31] at the prayer line at the end of that
[42:34] service or the the discernment service
[42:36] and then brother Arnie raised his hand
[42:39] and he had something to say
[42:42] brother Arnie's dad
[42:44] was in this service
[42:47] and he grew up hearing that story
[42:49] brother Arnie if you could give that
[42:50] testimony
[42:52] yeah we buried my dad last Saturday not
[42:55] yesterday but
[42:57] so he can't verify this I'm sorry
[43:00] wish my sisters were here but my dad
[43:03] told us this story
[43:06] since
[43:07] I can remember about this man with the
[43:10] cigars in his vest because he was
[43:11] sitting close to him and saw the
[43:13] expression on his face when brother
[43:15] Bradham was talking to him and the
[43:17] surprise look you know you
[43:19] I I've heard a lot of negative about
[43:22] brother Benham I've never gone on those
[43:23] websites to see the negative but
[43:26] um I was really happy to see brother
[43:28] Cedric Cedric if I said it Elizabeth you
[43:31] could tell me your dog's name Cedric or
[43:34] Cedric but anyway
[43:36] he brought another person here and I
[43:38] said if I find this paper in my Bible
[43:40] I'm going to say this if you have one
[43:43] penny and you get one penny today
[43:45] and then tomorrow you get two pennies
[43:47] and the next day you get four pennies
[43:49] we're talking about money now if you're
[43:51] interested in money and then
[43:54] the next day you get eight pennies you
[43:56] know at the end of the month if you have
[43:57] a 32 month
[43:59] how many pennies you get
[44:01] I could have did the arithmetic wrong
[44:03] it's been a long time since I took
[44:04] arithmetic but I got two billion pennies
[44:08] in 31 days God's going to do a quick
[44:11] work he brought another
[44:13] penny with him Amen brother Cedric and
[44:16] so I just want him to be he was excited
[44:18] I played uh brother Brown talking to my
[44:21] mom and I could see the expression on
[44:23] his face he was excited to hear
[44:26] a prophet revealing the secrets of the
[44:29] heart because brother uh
[44:32] Paul talks about that
[44:35] that um
[44:37] and brother Branham quotes it in the two
[44:39] movies the the colored one in Chicago
[44:41] the bow tie remember and then the deep
[44:44] cause deep in Washington DC the black
[44:46] and white one he quotes the scripture
[44:48] where they'll an unbeliever comes among
[44:51] you they'll they'll say surely God's
[44:54] within you God's in your midst right so
[44:57] I I want to stop and just say that that
[44:59] was a true testimony from my dad because
[45:02] we and I we didn't actually listen to
[45:03] tapes till about the middle 70s and when
[45:06] that was in the middle 50s 55 and we
[45:09] didn't start listening to if I remember
[45:10] right about the middle and then we got
[45:12] to hear Brother by Adam for the first
[45:14] time talking to my mom talking to my
[45:17] friend Ozzy talking to this man that had
[45:20] the cigars in his vest coat pocket sorry
[45:22] I hope I didn't take too much time no I
[45:24] appreciate appreciate that it's and the
[45:26] Bible says and they could say nothing
[45:28] because the man was standing among them
[45:30] so we see that testimony I want to talk
[45:32] about this brother here brother Cedric
[45:35] is a minister of the gospel and his dad
[45:37] is a pastor am I right brother raise
[45:39] your hand God bless you he's a servant
[45:42] of the Lord and it's really nice to have
[45:44] him brother Arnie if you could give that
[45:45] to brother Amos oh do you have something
[45:48] Okay so we heard about that
[45:52] and then
[45:53] hang on to it Amos for a minute and then
[45:57] I gave the testimony of a man
[46:00] named Marvin that I had met in
[46:04] Jeffersonville that he used to
[46:09] um walk to school here he is he used to
[46:12] walk to school way back when in the
[46:16] 1940s brother Branham would be dressed
[46:18] up in his um in his game and fish outfit
[46:22] driving his car and he would pick up
[46:25] this young man who was segregated back
[46:27] then he went to a segregate he went to
[46:29] an all-black school brother Brandon
[46:30] would pick him up and bring him to
[46:32] school and didn't make him feel like
[46:34] such a big guy
[46:36] you know and he said you know and the
[46:38] one thing that is important that
[46:40] everything's important about these
[46:42] testimonies but one thing that struck me
[46:43] he says you know I didn't even know he
[46:45] was a preacher
[46:46] he said he was so nice to me he wasn't
[46:49] like any other preacher I ever met he
[46:51] wasn't always trying to tell me how to
[46:53] live my life and everything he said the
[46:54] only thing that he told me he said stay
[46:56] in school
[46:58] he said get an education
[47:00] because you won't regret it in the
[47:01] future
[47:02] that's what Marvin told me
[47:05] so he was he was talking about brother
[47:07] Branham and he said he said I didn't
[47:09] even know he said then he came up
[47:11] missing
[47:12] for a couple months
[47:15] and he said when he came back to our
[47:18] little town of Jeffersonville he said he
[47:21] was famous he said people were coming
[47:24] all from all over the world to come in
[47:26] and to get prayed for at the Tabernacle
[47:28] he said that little church at 8th and
[47:30] Penn Street he said they'd be lined up
[47:32] trying to get in there to get their
[47:34] healing and he said everybody throughout
[47:37] the country knew about that and he said
[47:40] I knew him right before it happened he
[47:42] said what happened
[47:43] and we heard that testimony
[47:46] on Wednesday night how the angel came to
[47:48] me in his commission that's what
[47:51] happened
[47:52] he got that commission and the Lord led
[47:54] him to go out
[47:56] he would he would have
[47:59] the the angel talked to him
[48:01] and he would he the angel told him
[48:04] you'll have these signs as Moses had and
[48:08] one of those signs sister Roberta I'm
[48:10] going to put you on the spot
[48:12] one of those signs was brother Amos if
[48:16] you could get the microphone was that
[48:18] his hand
[48:21] he would see some sort of a sickness in
[48:25] his hand and Moses had a similar sign
[48:27] right back there Amos right back there
[48:32] and then my sister talked about this she
[48:35] told me about this after service
[48:40] okay
[48:44] that's testimony
[48:47] um she was sick with a female trouble
[48:52] and they had done an operation and
[48:56] and they'd given her medications and it
[48:59] hadn't worked
[49:00] and she was still having you know would
[49:03] leave and then come again
[49:05] so they had been uh
[49:09] going to Jeffersonville they lived in
[49:12] Chicago
[49:14] and she went down to Jeffersonville and
[49:20] they were able to get an interview
[49:23] with brother Branham
[49:25] and um it was my mom and dad and then I
[49:29] believed Leo Mercer was there and
[49:32] brother Branham and then brother Gerald
[49:35] chance was there he's a brother out of
[49:37] the uh up in the Flagstaff Church
[49:41] and um
[49:43] so my mom tells it
[49:46] I'll do the best I can
[49:49] they were at Brother branham's house in
[49:53] a room she said it was off of the porch
[49:57] and they it was his little Den in his
[50:00] house
[50:01] and uh they all went in there and
[50:05] brother Branham sat in the chair and my
[50:08] mom and dad were on a little sofa
[50:10] and she said that brother Branham just
[50:15] sat there and he sort of talked to them
[50:18] and was uh
[50:20] uh expressing the importance of doing
[50:25] everything in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:27] Christ
[50:29] and then after a little bit
[50:33] he came and sat on the um
[50:37] the coffee table
[50:40] knees to knees with my my parents
[50:44] and um
[50:46] and then he
[50:49] asked her you know what was the problem
[50:52] and she told them what the problem was
[50:56] and um
[50:58] and uh
[51:02] then he said so he talked with them and
[51:07] then he says let's all stand and get in
[51:09] a circle
[51:10] and brother Gerald chance was there
[51:13] because he he wanted brother Branham to
[51:16] pray that he
[51:17] would receive the Holy Spirit
[51:19] that's what he was that's what he wanted
[51:23] and um and so they all stood in a circle
[51:27] and my mom
[51:30] said that brother Branham uh he said
[51:34] have you ever seen the
[51:37] the sign that the lord gave me in my
[51:41] hand and they said no
[51:43] and so he he showed his hand I don't
[51:47] know which hand it was
[51:49] but in the
[51:51] you know the thumb and the this part
[51:58] he took my mom's hand
[52:00] and um
[52:02] and he it started making little bumps
[52:07] and getting read like it was
[52:11] that's what she said it was it was
[52:13] getting like there was something wrong
[52:16] with brother branham's hand and he told
[52:18] her this won't this that you have will
[52:21] not take your life
[52:23] and he said
[52:25] um if it was something bad he goes my
[52:29] hand gets worse and worse and it'll look
[52:32] like leprosy
[52:35] and then um so then he had asked my dad
[52:39] something and my dad had always had
[52:42] asthma
[52:44] and um so he took my dad's hand and it
[52:48] that did and anyway brother when they
[52:51] said my dad said I have trouble with
[52:54] asthma
[52:55] brother Branham goes oh that's just the
[52:58] devil and he took my dad's hand and it
[53:01] did not show in his hand wow Ministry
[53:05] and then uh and then my dad had asked
[53:08] further Branham
[53:10] because
[53:12] um
[53:13] my dad worked in an office in Chicago he
[53:16] was an accountant
[53:18] and he worked it and it was a big room
[53:21] and uh
[53:23] and people were
[53:25] very
[53:27] um worldly and talk bad and there was
[53:30] things and my dad was a a Christian
[53:34] person and and then
[53:37] they would say and do things
[53:40] and my dad just he asked for the random
[53:43] to please pray he would get a different
[53:45] job
[53:46] and um
[53:49] so I'll finish that part
[53:52] um but when brother Brown prayed he did
[53:55] not pray for my dad to have a new job
[53:58] he he said please make him content until
[54:02] you have something else for him
[54:06] and so then when my dad went back
[54:10] he um
[54:13] he said the Lord had done something for
[54:16] him
[54:17] because it didn't bother him he was able
[54:21] to do his work ignore and and and he was
[54:26] there until
[54:27] a long time I don't know how long it was
[54:30] but he never got an another job in
[54:33] Chicago of course we moved to they moved
[54:36] us to Arizona
[54:39] and um
[54:41] and another little thing with that was
[54:44] you know on the tape brother Branham
[54:46] says
[54:47] that
[54:49] in the offices the people would throw
[54:51] their keys in a basket and then you grab
[54:55] the keys and went home with whoever
[54:57] owned the keys my dad said that they did
[55:00] that in that office wow
[55:04] and um
[55:06] so anyway so back to my mom
[55:09] and the prayer so brother they get in a
[55:12] circle and brother Branham
[55:15] um prayed and she said it was a simple
[55:18] prayer
[55:19] but he told them that I want you to
[55:22] watch my hand
[55:24] you know his so he still has my mom's
[55:26] hand
[55:27] and and he goes I want you all to watch
[55:30] my hand
[55:31] and um and he prayed and the thing that
[55:36] Mom said stood out to her
[55:38] was brother Branham when he was done he
[55:42] said he said several but the ones she
[55:46] remembers was
[55:47] he said in the name of the home and uh
[55:50] and the Holy Roman Church
[55:54] and then he said in the name of the
[55:56] Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[55:59] and he said of she thinks he said more
[56:03] than that but she can't remember it but
[56:05] then he said in the name of the Lord
[56:07] Jesus Christ in his hand immediately
[56:11] went uh cleaned back to normal again
[56:15] whatever you do in order deed
[56:17] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:19] amen
[56:21] so and then he did tell brother Gerald
[56:24] that he would receive the holy spirit
[56:26] that that week so
[56:29] and then my mom went over the men were
[56:32] talking so she went over to the door
[56:34] and then brother Branham came over by
[56:37] her and he says now Sister you can
[56:39] either take that medicine and he she
[56:42] said that he told her the two
[56:45] medications that they had given her
[56:47] and
[56:49] she said my dad didn't even know what
[56:51] they had given her and and he says now
[56:54] you can either take them or you cannot
[56:56] take them but you've been healed and
[56:59] then mom always says of course I didn't
[57:01] take them
[57:03] thank the Lord thank you
[57:08] for the Arnie and sister Roberta thank
[57:10] you very much I I also mentioned now
[57:13] remember friends as we're telling these
[57:15] testimonies we are glorifying our lord
[57:19] Jesus
[57:20] and we we read our Bibles and we see
[57:24] that these were commonplace
[57:27] from Moses putting his hand in his bosom
[57:31] and then pulling it out and pulling it
[57:33] out in his leprous and then putting it
[57:35] back in and then it was clean you know
[57:39] we see that in the Bible we see
[57:41] discernment in the in the Bible as I
[57:43] said with ananias and Sapphira how Peter
[57:47] showed that sign when he was
[57:51] when when they came before him and he
[57:53] told them what they had done about about
[57:55] keeping the money back so these things
[57:58] that we're talking about they're not new
[58:01] they are attributes of God and he
[58:04] doesn't change there was I told the
[58:07] story about a man named Robert E Lee an
[58:09] old man that I met
[58:11] and um he uh he knew I used to get the
[58:14] stories about brother Branham he knew
[58:16] brother Branham
[58:17] and he said the same thing he said you
[58:19] know he was just an ordinary guy he used
[58:21] to walk the high lines the power lines
[58:23] and he would stay with him and his
[58:26] family overnight
[58:28] because he was doing his who doing his
[58:30] run and he said like I said he said he
[58:32] was just an ordinary guy here he is in
[58:34] his in his shop that's where I talked to
[58:35] him
[58:36] and
[58:38] he uh he told the story
[58:41] to me about
[58:43] they were having a baptismal service
[58:47] and this young woman got out in a boat
[58:51] and she went out in the boat next to
[58:55] where they were baptizing all of these
[58:57] people
[58:58] and she started making fun
[59:01] of what was going on
[59:03] and she started heckling the um the the
[59:07] service there and she was warned to stop
[59:11] yet she kept on
[59:14] and then Mr Lee said he said I witnessed
[59:17] it
[59:18] he said I witnessed the woman lose her
[59:21] mind
[59:22] and be committed and he never saw her
[59:24] again be committed into this insane
[59:27] institution how careful we should be
[59:31] about condemning even if it doesn't line
[59:34] up with the way that we think
[59:36] condemning the things of God he told me
[59:40] he told me about his
[59:43] um niece
[59:45] and he was telling about his niece he
[59:47] said he said yeah she's he she had all
[59:49] these problems she said she was she was
[59:52] schizophini
[59:55] I said really he said yeah she still she
[59:58] struggled with schizophrenia and and she
[1:00:00] was she would just get so bad and I was
[1:00:03] like yeah
[1:00:04] bad and what she struggle with he says
[1:00:07] sis Vinnie
[1:00:09] did she take medicine no yeah she took
[1:00:12] medicine didn't do any good and I was
[1:00:14] like
[1:00:15] okay and and he said I said what's
[1:00:18] sisyphenic and he said you know she
[1:00:21] she'd lose her mind she had two like
[1:00:23] different personalities I said oh
[1:00:25] schizophrenia he said that's what I said
[1:00:27] schizophrenic
[1:00:29] I said I said okay I don't know we're on
[1:00:33] the same page now
[1:00:34] so he started telling this this
[1:00:37] testimony she got committed to a place
[1:00:39] anybody that's been um in Jeffersonville
[1:00:42] there was a big insane asylum which was
[1:00:45] north of Jeffersonville about an hour in
[1:00:48] a place called Madison they shipped her
[1:00:50] off to Madison because they couldn't do
[1:00:51] anything with her she
[1:00:54] was she had had lost her mind she would
[1:00:58] lose control and then come back and lose
[1:01:00] control
[1:01:01] with schizophrenia and the family
[1:01:05] asked brother Branham to go and pray for
[1:01:08] her
[1:01:09] brother Brandon made the trip to the
[1:01:12] hospital
[1:01:13] and he prayed for the young lady and she
[1:01:16] was delivered
[1:01:17] and Mr Lee told me he said she never
[1:01:20] struggled with it again
[1:01:23] which is that leads me to my sermon
[1:01:26] today which is we have to remove and
[1:01:31] replace
[1:01:33] so what happened was he had prayed for
[1:01:35] this woman this young lady
[1:01:38] she was delivered of the sickness and
[1:01:41] then she became a Christian
[1:01:44] she replaced that void
[1:01:48] that was
[1:01:49] in her
[1:01:51] when that Spirit came out of her she
[1:01:54] replaced it with serving the lord she
[1:01:57] replaced it with Christianity
[1:02:00] and you know let me let me read that
[1:02:03] scripture again quickly
[1:02:06] Luke 11 24-28 it says when an unclean
[1:02:10] spirit is gone out of a man it walketh
[1:02:12] through Dry places
[1:02:14] dry places that's places without water
[1:02:18] seeking rest and findeth none he saith I
[1:02:21] will return unto my house
[1:02:23] my house once I came out
[1:02:26] and when
[1:02:27] he cometh
[1:02:29] and findeth it swept and garnished then
[1:02:31] goeth thee and take it to him seven
[1:02:34] other Spirits more wicked than himself
[1:02:36] and they enter in and dwell there in the
[1:02:39] last state of that man is worse than the
[1:02:41] first
[1:02:42] so we we see this Parable that Jesus
[1:02:47] gave and this is in the Book of Luke The
[1:02:49] Book of Luke has the most Parables of
[1:02:52] any of the Gospels
[1:02:54] so Jesus is telling this story and these
[1:02:57] parables are they're meant to Spur our
[1:03:02] thinking
[1:03:03] and they're meant to teach us a lesson
[1:03:06] so we have this story
[1:03:08] of of the spirit
[1:03:11] and it's in this house
[1:03:15] and then it takes up residence maybe and
[1:03:19] then it's cast out it's evicted from the
[1:03:22] house
[1:03:23] so it knows it can't come in so this
[1:03:26] Spirit goes through the neighborhood and
[1:03:30] he's walking along
[1:03:31] and he goes up to other houses
[1:03:34] maybe he tries the door
[1:03:38] maybe he knocks on the window or maybe
[1:03:40] he he tries to raise the window and it's
[1:03:43] locked and he's he's going through and
[1:03:45] he's
[1:03:46] he's trying to find a place to live
[1:03:49] maybe this spirit is holding a grudge
[1:03:54] maybe the spirit is gossiping maybe it's
[1:04:00] a negative Spirit about always talking
[1:04:03] negative about someone
[1:04:06] and then it goes It goes and it's trying
[1:04:09] to find a place that it can rest
[1:04:11] remember Spirits want Fellowship just
[1:04:14] like we want
[1:04:15] they want somewhere to feel comfortable
[1:04:17] so this spirit's going along through the
[1:04:20] neighborhood and it's trying the door
[1:04:22] and it might it might come in and it
[1:04:26] might set the table
[1:04:28] get it ready it might set the situation
[1:04:33] and try to open the door for him to come
[1:04:38] in and take residence
[1:04:40] it might be like last night in our
[1:04:42] meeting I thought it went really well
[1:04:44] but there are obviously things that
[1:04:45] meant a lot to a lot of us
[1:04:48] and we see even then and always where
[1:04:52] we're at we see the spirit and it's
[1:04:54] right there
[1:04:56] and it's trying to come in and say
[1:05:00] oh this person lied
[1:05:02] oh where this person wants something
[1:05:04] that's off the word
[1:05:06] or or to come in and say oh well well
[1:05:09] this person
[1:05:11] um
[1:05:12] they just hate me they don't want
[1:05:14] anything to do with me
[1:05:15] and there's the spirit and he's trying
[1:05:18] to get in the window
[1:05:19] he's trying to open the door and then
[1:05:22] you just put him out
[1:05:23] no no they didn't want they didn't want
[1:05:25] that you can't help those thoughts from
[1:05:27] coming in your mind
[1:05:29] you can't help that the enemy he's
[1:05:31] knocking on the door he's trying to get
[1:05:33] in the house
[1:05:34] but you just put your hand up no I don't
[1:05:38] want it so then he goes to the next
[1:05:40] house and this one may be drinking
[1:05:44] and maybe smoking it may be something
[1:05:47] that these this someone was delivered of
[1:05:50] or that has a weakness there and he is
[1:05:53] trying to get in
[1:05:55] I know of a man
[1:05:58] That I Used to Know
[1:05:59] he
[1:06:03] gave his heart to the Lord
[1:06:05] started going to church
[1:06:07] serving God the best that he knew how to
[1:06:10] do
[1:06:11] he got the whole house all cleaned out
[1:06:15] but there was one thing
[1:06:18] that he just couldn't get rid of
[1:06:23] and it was an adulterous spirit
[1:06:26] so then
[1:06:28] we see that here's
[1:06:30] here's the spirit going in and then it
[1:06:33] finds a residence
[1:06:36] and if it's not cast out
[1:06:39] then it takes up takes up this
[1:06:44] home this residence
[1:06:46] so now this Spirit he's going through
[1:06:48] and he's he's walking around and he
[1:06:51] comes back to the original House
[1:06:55] that he had been to
[1:06:58] and he looks and wow this place is
[1:07:01] different
[1:07:03] he got the outside the hedges are all
[1:07:06] trimmed the grass looks nice the windows
[1:07:09] are all fixed this house looks brand new
[1:07:13] and he's the spirit's looking at the
[1:07:15] place this person had given his heart to
[1:07:18] the Lord he had
[1:07:19] he had changed his way of doing things
[1:07:24] and here comes the spirit and he pulls
[1:07:27] out the keys
[1:07:28] and he says
[1:07:30] it couldn't be
[1:07:32] sticks it in the keyhole and turns and
[1:07:35] it unlocked the door
[1:07:38] and he looks in
[1:07:41] is there anybody in this house
[1:07:44] this isn't like I remember it
[1:07:47] it's all renovated the walls are all
[1:07:49] painted he walks in and you know is
[1:07:52] there anybody here he goes in he goes
[1:07:54] down the hallway
[1:07:56] careful he's not going to get kicked out
[1:07:57] again
[1:07:58] goes through every room the bedroom and
[1:08:00] he goes to the living room and the
[1:08:02] bathrooms everything's all redone and
[1:08:03] it's all beautiful but there's no one
[1:08:05] living there
[1:08:08] and he says this is better than when I
[1:08:10] left
[1:08:12] sits down puts his feet up on the couch
[1:08:14] calls up his buddies
[1:08:17] and says come on over
[1:08:19] this house is is welcome now this man
[1:08:24] had given his heart to the Lord
[1:08:27] but that void that was created when he
[1:08:30] got rid of his sin
[1:08:32] wasn't replaced with anything
[1:08:36] so this man that I know of
[1:08:39] he
[1:08:42] didn't
[1:08:43] completely get rid of that Spirit ends
[1:08:46] up running around on his wife leaving
[1:08:48] his wife
[1:08:49] his wife left him
[1:08:52] getting another girlfriend he ended up
[1:08:55] started drinking
[1:08:57] another Spirit came in
[1:09:00] he started going to bars another Spirit
[1:09:03] came in
[1:09:04] he started showing up late for work
[1:09:07] another Spirit came in lost his job
[1:09:11] and turned out to have a complete
[1:09:15] failure in life
[1:09:17] because he had not replaced
[1:09:21] what he had cast out he didn't replace
[1:09:25] it with something else
[1:09:28] and I'm talking about
[1:09:31] when we replace
[1:09:34] something when we lose something we may
[1:09:37] come to the Altar and say Lord I'm not
[1:09:38] going to do this anymore
[1:09:40] but you can't just leave it there
[1:09:43] that void that's created in you and what
[1:09:46] Jesus is talking about here it's got to
[1:09:49] have another Spirit come in and replace
[1:09:52] that
[1:09:54] the Holy Spirit
[1:09:56] and other things I'm not just talking
[1:09:58] about spiritual things here I preached
[1:10:00] the sermon I don't know a month ago or
[1:10:03] so on the talents
[1:10:04] and how
[1:10:06] that these three men they were given one
[1:10:08] was given five talents which was like
[1:10:11] five million dollars one was given two
[1:10:14] talents one was given one Talent
[1:10:17] and
[1:10:19] each of the the the master left and when
[1:10:23] he came back the one with five talents I
[1:10:25] doubled it to ten talents
[1:10:28] the one with two had doubled it to four
[1:10:30] the one with one
[1:10:32] had just buried it and not done anything
[1:10:35] to multiply the Master's money
[1:10:38] so
[1:10:39] the point of the story was you've been
[1:10:42] given something but don't just leave it
[1:10:45] there don't bury it and what I said is
[1:10:48] it's not what you don't do for God
[1:10:53] I quit smoking I quit drinking I quit
[1:10:55] cussing I quit lying I quit watching TV
[1:10:57] I quit watching movies I quit driving I
[1:10:59] quit uh doing this and I quit doing that
[1:11:01] that's not serving God
[1:11:04] that is not doing something for God and
[1:11:07] those things will hinder your service of
[1:11:10] God
[1:11:11] but when you take something out it needs
[1:11:15] to be replaced with something else
[1:11:19] so if I'm not if if I'm if I'm not going
[1:11:23] to eat any sweets anymore
[1:11:26] you know I got to replace the Twinkies
[1:11:28] with carrots
[1:11:31] it's a bit drastic but I couldn't think
[1:11:34] of anything else
[1:11:35] but but you have to replace it with
[1:11:38] something else there's a void created in
[1:11:41] US
[1:11:42] and when we don't replace that it's like
[1:11:46] taking a shovel and shoveling water into
[1:11:48] a net
[1:11:50] which is just go and go you're not
[1:11:52] accomplishing anything nothing's going
[1:11:54] to happen
[1:11:55] you know when people I've counseled so
[1:11:58] many people they come to me and say well
[1:12:00] I just keep doing it
[1:12:02] you know I'll go and I'll give my heart
[1:12:04] to the Lord I'll rededicate my life and
[1:12:06] then I fall into the same sin of course
[1:12:08] you do you're a human being of course
[1:12:12] you fall into the same thing but what
[1:12:14] you have to do is you have to replace
[1:12:16] that that was taken out
[1:12:18] that house was swept and that house was
[1:12:21] garnished if the owner of that house
[1:12:24] would have filled it with something good
[1:12:29] when that guy came up
[1:12:31] to turn that key to open that door that
[1:12:34] house has been full and that Spirit
[1:12:36] wouldn't have won wanted
[1:12:38] to fellowship with what was in that
[1:12:40] house already
[1:12:42] so when we're doing
[1:12:44] when we're making changes in our lives
[1:12:48] or changes in church or changes in our
[1:12:51] family and we try to cut stuff out it's
[1:12:54] got to be replaced with something else
[1:12:57] you may say Well I'm
[1:12:59] Lord I'm trying to stop watching so much
[1:13:02] television I'm trying Lord forgive me
[1:13:05] for going to to bad websites I shouldn't
[1:13:08] be doing that I'm going to stop okay
[1:13:10] good you're on the right you're on the
[1:13:13] right track now replace it with
[1:13:15] something else
[1:13:16] because if you don't
[1:13:18] you might have swept the house
[1:13:20] but something's going to come back in
[1:13:23] and what do you replace it with
[1:13:25] replace it
[1:13:27] with something that should be done
[1:13:31] replace it if if you're bored get out
[1:13:36] and do something that you need to do if
[1:13:38] you're a student
[1:13:39] study
[1:13:41] you know if you're at home go out and do
[1:13:43] something in the yard fix something that
[1:13:46] needs to be done clean your car get
[1:13:48] something done because that idle time is
[1:13:51] the Devil's Playground
[1:13:53] you you replace those things when Jesus
[1:13:58] he was walking along and all the people
[1:14:01] were around him and they were they were
[1:14:03] touching him and and he's going along
[1:14:05] and there was a little lady that nobody
[1:14:08] knew anything about
[1:14:10] she was suffering with female trouble
[1:14:12] she's bleeding and she had it for long
[1:14:14] years and years
[1:14:16] and she came up and she snuck up behind
[1:14:19] Jesus and she knew in her mind if I can
[1:14:22] just touch the very Hem of this man's
[1:14:25] garment
[1:14:26] she had a revelation of who this Jesus
[1:14:28] was that he was powerful he could do
[1:14:30] anything if I can just touch His Garment
[1:14:34] then I will be healed
[1:14:37] so she goes and she sneaks up behind him
[1:14:40] and she touches it and immediately she's
[1:14:42] healed by her own face she was healed so
[1:14:45] what did Jesus do
[1:14:47] Jesus stops
[1:14:50] and he says who touched me
[1:14:52] the disciples are like hey everybody's
[1:14:54] touching you you know don't don't say
[1:14:56] that
[1:14:57] and he's like no virtue has gone from me
[1:15:04] so it came out of Jesus and it went into
[1:15:08] this woman that needed it so what did
[1:15:12] Jesus have to do
[1:15:14] he had to refill that virtue somehow and
[1:15:19] I will I will get to that scripture in a
[1:15:21] little bit now I look at
[1:15:23] look at the Dead Sea
[1:15:26] and we're familiar about with the Dead
[1:15:28] Sea and the Border there of Israel
[1:15:31] water you know why it's called Dead
[1:15:34] is because it's dead nothing lives there
[1:15:37] so water comes down the uh Jordan right
[1:15:42] the Jordan River and it goes into this
[1:15:45] big lake
[1:15:47] and nothing comes out
[1:15:50] the water comes in
[1:15:52] but nothing comes out of the lake
[1:15:54] so the water sits there
[1:15:57] and it stagnates it's in a desert area
[1:15:59] it evaporates up and everything that's
[1:16:03] impure in the water sinks down
[1:16:06] to the bottom this this water is
[1:16:09] evaporating and it concentrates all of
[1:16:13] the bad things there all of the salts
[1:16:16] and the minerals and it makes it to
[1:16:17] where nothing can live so we see the
[1:16:19] water it comes in and it doesn't come
[1:16:22] out and that's so many of us get that
[1:16:25] way
[1:16:26] the water can come in
[1:16:28] but if it's not flowing out like it did
[1:16:31] from Jesus that virtue came into Jesus
[1:16:33] and that virtue flowed out of Jesus if
[1:16:36] it doesn't do that then we get to a very
[1:16:39] low place the Dead Sea is the lowest
[1:16:42] place on Earth
[1:16:43] if some if stuff comes in
[1:16:46] and it doesn't come out we become dead
[1:16:50] and we see the Lord Jesus there
[1:16:53] The Virtue is coming in it's constantly
[1:16:56] coming in and then it's constantly going
[1:16:59] out
[1:17:00] there
[1:17:02] the um
[1:17:06] I have a friend
[1:17:07] had a friend who passed away a couple
[1:17:09] years ago I wanted to talk about him
[1:17:12] this morning
[1:17:14] he was
[1:17:15] he lived the worst life
[1:17:19] that I have ever seen
[1:17:22] his name Daniel and Stephanie gnome his
[1:17:25] name is Don Marsh
[1:17:27] Don
[1:17:29] was when he was a child his dad ran
[1:17:33] brothels in Louisville his mom was an
[1:17:36] absolutely horrible woman
[1:17:38] they were obviously divorced
[1:17:41] he gets to be about I think he was 14
[1:17:43] years old
[1:17:45] there he is right there you got to be
[1:17:48] about 14 years old and his mom just
[1:17:50] didn't want him take care of him anymore
[1:17:52] him and his brother
[1:17:53] she takes him to the orphanage and just
[1:17:56] drops him off
[1:17:58] he goes up to the second store and he
[1:18:00] told me I got I went to the Second Story
[1:18:01] I looked out the window and there was
[1:18:03] mom getting in the car leaving
[1:18:05] and me and my brother stayed there
[1:18:09] and
[1:18:10] he he was just born
[1:18:13] to be doomed really
[1:18:16] so
[1:18:17] Don grows up
[1:18:20] his brother
[1:18:23] shoots himself in the head sitting right
[1:18:25] next to him
[1:18:27] I mean how could this
[1:18:29] young man live
[1:18:31] so he goes through his life
[1:18:34] and
[1:18:36] his dad his first memories as a child
[1:18:39] was his dad beating his mom
[1:18:42] I can't say how bad his life was he
[1:18:47] joins the army
[1:18:49] and he gets into um
[1:18:51] What's called the jumping they called
[1:18:53] him the jumping junkies because they
[1:18:55] were all heroin users and they jumped
[1:18:57] out of airplanes
[1:18:59] so he was
[1:19:00] he was jumping out of airplanes he was
[1:19:02] using drugs and just just had a just an
[1:19:05] awful awful way
[1:19:08] he jumps in this ditch
[1:19:11] and he says this let me quote him
[1:19:15] he says
[1:19:18] Lord he says I'm so tired of doing drugs
[1:19:23] and I'm so confused he says I'm losing
[1:19:25] my mind
[1:19:26] he said help me Jesus
[1:19:28] didn't know Jesus didn't know anything
[1:19:31] and he said he said help me
[1:19:33] so he took that
[1:19:37] and he started getting better
[1:19:40] and he started getting rid of some of
[1:19:42] the drugs and and a real he had a real
[1:19:44] problem with with women and and he got
[1:19:46] married and and then that started to
[1:19:48] fail and and he didn't replace all of
[1:19:51] the things that he was getting rid of he
[1:19:52] didn't replace them with anything and
[1:19:54] then finally he committed a horrible
[1:19:56] crime
[1:19:57] and ended up in prison
[1:20:01] and he's he's 30 years old and he's he's
[1:20:03] in prison as a lengthy sentence and
[1:20:07] he walks up to the bookshelf in the
[1:20:10] prison one of the first days he was
[1:20:12] there and he sees this book called
[1:20:13] footprints on the sands of time
[1:20:16] he picks it he picks it up and and he
[1:20:18] reads a little bit and doesn't think
[1:20:21] doesn't think much of it
[1:20:23] but he had remembered oh
[1:20:26] after I got out of the army I went to a
[1:20:29] Pentecostal Church
[1:20:32] and they mentioned this man named
[1:20:34] William Branham and about all these
[1:20:36] Miracles that followed his ministry and
[1:20:38] he said you know it always struck me I
[1:20:40] always I always liked that and I I
[1:20:41] picked that I picked that book out and I
[1:20:43] looked at it and oh there's that's him
[1:20:45] that's what he's is he's about
[1:20:48] didn't wasn't real serious about it
[1:20:51] gets does his time
[1:20:55] comes out
[1:20:57] of
[1:20:59] um jail
[1:21:01] because back to the church
[1:21:06] again there's a void
[1:21:09] started backsliding again started
[1:21:12] sinning again started doing the same
[1:21:14] things he told me he said everywhere I'd
[1:21:17] go every billboard I'd see it was women
[1:21:19] and alcohol
[1:21:21] he said I'd watch TV everything I saw
[1:21:23] advertised was women and alcohol
[1:21:26] he said I was focused I couldn't get
[1:21:28] away from it and then he would fall
[1:21:31] again found himself back in jail
[1:21:33] again
[1:21:34] got out again back in jail again more
[1:21:37] than 20 years he spent in prison
[1:21:40] back and forth and back and forth then
[1:21:43] he gets out of prison he says well I'll
[1:21:45] go to this Branham Tabernacle
[1:21:47] um because I think he was in prison in
[1:21:49] in Indiana so he he's he's going to live
[1:21:52] there so he um he goes and he starts
[1:21:55] going to church
[1:21:58] nobody would give him the time of day
[1:22:01] this guy first of all he was huge he was
[1:22:04] like six four six five he's built like
[1:22:06] Daniel except
[1:22:08] giant bigger
[1:22:11] and
[1:22:12] people knew his past
[1:22:14] they wouldn't reach out to him
[1:22:17] and I noticed he would stand up against
[1:22:19] the wall outside a church and lean up
[1:22:22] against the bricks
[1:22:25] and
[1:22:26] I just wondered why does he stand there
[1:22:28] by himself and I started to hear a
[1:22:30] couple rumors about him
[1:22:32] so I walked up to him
[1:22:35] and I said I said Hey brother I said
[1:22:39] I'm Daniel Evans I said what's what's
[1:22:41] your name he says brother his words he
[1:22:43] didn't give me his name he said brother
[1:22:45] nobody talks to me
[1:22:48] and I said why he says because I've done
[1:22:50] time
[1:22:51] hard time
[1:22:53] and I said I don't care
[1:22:56] I said
[1:22:58] tell me about yourself so we started
[1:23:00] talking
[1:23:01] don't ever cut anybody out friends no
[1:23:04] matter what they've done never set them
[1:23:07] aside
[1:23:08] because God might want to use you to
[1:23:11] bring that person in so I started
[1:23:13] talking to Don
[1:23:15] started fellowshipping with them after
[1:23:16] after church I introduced him to a
[1:23:18] couple of my friends
[1:23:20] one day
[1:23:22] he comes in
[1:23:25] I get a call from the receptionist uh
[1:23:27] there's a man here to see you
[1:23:31] I said okay so I go down
[1:23:33] and it's Dawn
[1:23:35] and he's upset
[1:23:39] and um I said yes sir I said I know him
[1:23:42] very well I knew it was past
[1:23:44] he would grow his fingernails
[1:23:47] so he could scratch
[1:23:49] this man
[1:23:50] didn't fight to fight he fought to live
[1:23:55] and he fought to kill
[1:23:57] that's what kind of a person he was
[1:23:59] so he's standing there and I come down I
[1:24:02] said what can I do for you he said my
[1:24:05] nephew
[1:24:06] just attacked my son
[1:24:10] and put him in the hospital and he said
[1:24:12] I'm going to kill him
[1:24:14] he said I need prayer
[1:24:18] and I said
[1:24:21] gets better I said okay
[1:24:24] um
[1:24:25] he said
[1:24:27] he says he says he said and he told me
[1:24:30] what everything that he did
[1:24:33] and I said let me tell you something
[1:24:36] I got right up in his face
[1:24:39] and I said don't waste my time
[1:24:45] and I was thinking
[1:24:46] in my mind in in my secret voice
[1:24:50] I was thinking this guy's huge this
[1:24:53] guy's mean this guy's a he's he's a
[1:24:56] killer and I just told him that
[1:25:00] and I was thinking okay I got to get
[1:25:02] ready because there's probably going to
[1:25:03] be a straight right coming right aimed
[1:25:05] at my nose and I got to be able to dodge
[1:25:08] and grab a hold of him long enough to
[1:25:10] where the secretary can call the police
[1:25:12] and if I can just hold on for a few
[1:25:14] minutes I won't die
[1:25:17] so I'm there and I'm
[1:25:19] I'm thinking all this in my mind and he
[1:25:21] looks at me I said don't waste my time
[1:25:25] if I pray for you you'd better receive
[1:25:28] what I pray for I said I don't have time
[1:25:30] for you
[1:25:32] I don't know why I said that
[1:25:34] he looked at me his eyes narrowed you
[1:25:37] saw the picture of him his eyes narrowed
[1:25:40] he said that's good counsel
[1:25:46] so I brought him into the chapel
[1:25:49] and we prayed
[1:25:52] and the spirit left him
[1:25:55] there in that Chapel
[1:25:57] that temper that hatred left
[1:26:02] Brother Don
[1:26:04] and we started corresponding with each
[1:26:07] other and I mean he was in the same town
[1:26:09] so
[1:26:11] poor and I'd always I try to give him
[1:26:14] something for Christmas you know so he
[1:26:16] could he could have food for um
[1:26:20] for a Christmas dinner and and Daniel
[1:26:23] and I would take him out sometime and
[1:26:25] spend some time with him
[1:26:27] but he turned into one of the finest
[1:26:31] people you have ever met
[1:26:35] loved the Lord Jesus absolutely just
[1:26:41] what he did is he started writing songs
[1:26:44] that void that was in him that came out
[1:26:47] that day that hatred
[1:26:49] he turned it into serving God's people
[1:26:52] through psalms I I got to do it one he
[1:26:55] uh he told
[1:26:57] Brother David Phillips one time what I
[1:27:00] did is I wrote an article about him in
[1:27:02] our in our magazine
[1:27:04] and uh
[1:27:06] I um
[1:27:10] David Phillips later on a few years
[1:27:13] later David he was talking with David
[1:27:16] and he says you know he says I'm this
[1:27:18] and he said
[1:27:19] he said you know he says I've never done
[1:27:22] anything for the Lord ever nobody even
[1:27:24] likes me
[1:27:25] and David tells him he said he said
[1:27:27] Brother Don that article that came out
[1:27:29] about you it's gone around the world
[1:27:32] he said your testimony has blessed
[1:27:35] hundreds of thousands of people
[1:27:39] David told them that may be the reason
[1:27:41] you were sent on Earth so you could give
[1:27:43] somebody else strength and Don said
[1:27:45] he says is that true my testimony
[1:27:49] yeah it's gone around everywhere
[1:27:52] so Brother Don I wanted to play
[1:27:55] something for he used to call me and and
[1:27:57] sing songs for me and leave it on my
[1:27:59] voicemail but I wanted to tell you I
[1:28:02] don't know if you can hear it I'll put
[1:28:04] it up next to my microphone
[1:28:07] um
[1:28:07] but uh
[1:28:09] here's here's a song that he wrote
[1:28:13] and he sang
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:26] these days
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:40] foreign
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:55] [Music]
[1:29:14] beyond the Milky Way
[1:29:18] that's where we shall stay
[1:29:23] surrounding the throne
[1:29:26] of Jesus
[1:29:28] Jesus that he turned
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:32] to think about that
[1:29:34] Serena I made himself to you have a good
[1:29:37] night
[1:29:41] I have no seriously I really need to
[1:29:43] talk to you
[1:29:45] [Applause]
[1:29:48] God bless his heart
[1:29:51] you know he took he had a terrible
[1:29:54] terrible life and I want to play one
[1:29:56] more this one's short
[1:29:58] um this is a
[1:30:02] um
[1:30:03] a message that he gave me right before
[1:30:06] he died
[1:30:08] he was in the hospital he had liver
[1:30:10] disease from all of his abuse of his
[1:30:12] body
[1:30:13] and he gave me I hope you can understand
[1:30:15] it I'll tell you what he said if you
[1:30:17] can't
[1:30:23] ah you never know what I want to call
[1:30:26] you yeah I don't know
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:31] how you should come to me when I had a
[1:30:33] problem with part of the
[1:30:35] telling you about my nephew that one
[1:30:38] time out anyway I was with that boy
[1:30:41] anyway
[1:30:43] me and Abel Smith have bonding brother
[1:30:46] that's really great and I came to you
[1:30:48] one time about it
[1:30:51] I was like God I never went down that
[1:30:54] kind of route
[1:30:55] oh
[1:30:57] anyway I kind of laughed at myself
[1:31:00] sometimes those people whom I love the
[1:31:03] most now the ones I used to I always
[1:31:05] find software
[1:31:07] that's something
[1:31:09] don't worry God bless you got some songs
[1:31:12] coming at you soon
[1:31:18] God bless you for everything bye
[1:31:21] that makes me sad
[1:31:24] he said the ones
[1:31:26] that I used to hate the most
[1:31:28] are the ones that I love
[1:31:30] is that not the spirit of Christ
[1:31:33] did our brother Don not replace
[1:31:37] what the evil spirits and you think you
[1:31:40] have a bad
[1:31:42] you think that you struggle with things
[1:31:44] you got it easy
[1:31:47] compared to Brother Don and compared to
[1:31:49] a lot of other people
[1:31:51] but we have an obligation
[1:31:54] friends as we are working on these
[1:31:56] things in our lives
[1:31:58] that these we struggle and and we we
[1:32:02] toil and we try to get rid of all these
[1:32:07] things it has to be replaced
[1:32:09] with something it could be something so
[1:32:12] simple as going for a walk
[1:32:15] it could be something so simple as as
[1:32:18] cleaning your car
[1:32:21] or
[1:32:22] you could take 30 minutes in a day
[1:32:26] that you were doing something else
[1:32:28] and get on your knees
[1:32:31] it's the most important thing that we
[1:32:34] can do anywhere in life it's more
[1:32:38] important than reading this Bible it's
[1:32:40] more important than serving each other
[1:32:43] it's more important than anything is
[1:32:45] getting on our knees or standing or
[1:32:49] sitting in your chair or whatever it is
[1:32:51] and giving God time and talking to him
[1:32:57] praying to him Lord speak to me Lord I
[1:33:03] love you
[1:33:05] you created all of this you put me on
[1:33:08] this Earth Lord I am going to do my part
[1:33:13] now you replaced that void that's in in
[1:33:17] my heart in my body
[1:33:19] Lord you replace it
[1:33:21] and then he will you see a success story
[1:33:26] in the the worst of the worst right here
[1:33:30] and I witnessed it
[1:33:32] I saw it
[1:33:34] he went from a man that would tear your
[1:33:38] head off with temper
[1:33:40] that kept going prison and out in prison
[1:33:42] and out and fighting and all of these
[1:33:45] things but God got a hold of him
[1:33:49] and he opened himself up and he replaced
[1:33:54] that void of that evil spirit that left
[1:33:57] that day in the chapel
[1:33:59] and he replaced it with the Holy Spirit
[1:34:03] did he fail after that sure he did did
[1:34:07] he sin after that of course he did but
[1:34:09] there was something different about him
[1:34:12] there was something different about my
[1:34:14] friend
[1:34:15] and we go through I haven't I've all I
[1:34:18] have a lot of
[1:34:19] different examples let me um
[1:34:23] let me just say let me just say one
[1:34:27] and this is at the pool of Bethesda
[1:34:32] if we could uh
[1:34:33] quickly in closing turn to Saint John
[1:34:36] chapter 5.
[1:34:40] and well I'll read verse 14 and what had
[1:34:42] happened was we had this man
[1:34:46] he was by this pool and there that an
[1:34:48] angel would come
[1:34:50] and
[1:34:52] it seems superstitious
[1:34:54] just like sister Roberta Maybe
[1:34:57] a sign in a hand might see seems
[1:34:59] superstitious
[1:35:01] but
[1:35:03] these things are of God
[1:35:04] and what would happen is people would be
[1:35:07] laying around
[1:35:09] this pool in the town
[1:35:12] and every once in a while the water
[1:35:16] would start to churn
[1:35:19] and the first person that could get in
[1:35:22] the water this is in the Bible
[1:35:25] the first person that could get in the
[1:35:27] water would be healed of whatever
[1:35:29] ailment they had
[1:35:32] so we see all of these sick people
[1:35:35] laying around this pool just waiting for
[1:35:37] the churning of the water and as soon as
[1:35:39] that water would churn they'd all Rush
[1:35:41] In And they would cut in front of each
[1:35:43] other and this man was sick he had some
[1:35:47] sort of illness that made him slow
[1:35:50] other people would beat him to the water
[1:35:54] and he was laying there
[1:35:56] trying to trying to get in hopefully and
[1:35:58] who knows when it would happen once a
[1:36:00] year or whenever it was
[1:36:04] and Jesus who he didn't know
[1:36:08] walked up to this man
[1:36:11] and he says this
[1:36:16] Jesus
[1:36:18] saw him live let's turn to verse 6.
[1:36:24] and the man at verse 7 the man answered
[1:36:27] verse six I'm sorry
[1:36:30] and he saith unto him wilt thou be made
[1:36:32] whole
[1:36:33] and the impotent man answered sir I have
[1:36:36] no man
[1:36:37] when the water is troubled to put me in
[1:36:39] the into the pool but while I am coming
[1:36:41] another steps down in front of me
[1:36:45] and Jesus saith unto him rise and take
[1:36:46] up thy bed and walk
[1:36:48] and immediately the man was made whole
[1:36:51] and took up his bed and walked on the
[1:36:53] same day was the Sabbath and the Jews
[1:36:55] therefore said unto him that was cured
[1:36:58] it is the Sabbath day and is not lawful
[1:37:00] for thee to carry thy bed and he
[1:37:02] answered them
[1:37:04] he that made me whole the same said unto
[1:37:08] me take up thy bed and walk so he was
[1:37:10] breaking the rules and carrying this bed
[1:37:12] on the Sabbath he was doing work but he
[1:37:14] said hey the man that healed me
[1:37:17] he told me to do this
[1:37:21] they asked him
[1:37:23] what man said that which is said unto
[1:37:26] thee take up thy bed and walk
[1:37:28] and he that was healed
[1:37:30] was not who it was he didn't know who it
[1:37:32] was first Jesus had conveyed himself
[1:37:35] away
[1:37:36] a multitude being in that place
[1:37:40] now here's the what I wanted to get to
[1:37:42] and sisters if if um if you want to come
[1:37:45] and close
[1:37:46] here's what I want to get to
[1:37:49] afterward
[1:37:51] Jesus finding him in the temple
[1:37:55] and said unto him behold Thou Art made
[1:38:00] whole
[1:38:02] sin no more
[1:38:06] lest a worse thing come unto thee
[1:38:12] so this man
[1:38:14] had done sin
[1:38:16] this man had been a sinner
[1:38:19] we don't know anything else about him
[1:38:21] other than Jesus said don't do it
[1:38:23] anymore
[1:38:25] so he had to replace
[1:38:28] what had come out of him
[1:38:31] with something else
[1:38:33] that's wonderful thing about Divine
[1:38:35] Healing it's a wonderful thing when
[1:38:36] we're sick
[1:38:38] we're going to get sick again if the
[1:38:40] Lord doesn't come and all of us will
[1:38:43] walk that way of the Grave if we don't
[1:38:45] see the rapture
[1:38:48] but one of the wonderful thing about
[1:38:51] Divine Healing isn't necessarily so much
[1:38:54] that we get healed and we do and it's a
[1:38:56] blessing
[1:38:57] but it's that we can take that void that
[1:39:01] was created by that sickness
[1:39:04] and we can replace it
[1:39:06] with the Holy Spirit
[1:39:08] we can replace it with God
[1:39:12] we can replace it with serving his
[1:39:15] people we can replace those things
[1:39:18] else Divine Healing we're all going to
[1:39:21] die anyways like I said unless the
[1:39:23] Rapture happens
[1:39:25] but replace those things and friends
[1:39:28] that's what I want you to get
[1:39:31] out of my sermon
[1:39:33] is when you make a commitment to the
[1:39:35] Lord when you get healed when
[1:39:39] whatever it is
[1:39:41] those things come out
[1:39:43] make sure that that house gets filled
[1:39:45] back up
[1:39:46] or they'll come right back and it could
[1:39:48] be worse than the first
[1:39:51] amen God bless you let's stand brother
[1:39:54] Aaron if you could come and
[1:39:56] sing for us
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:40:11] God removed
[1:40:14] two thousand years ago
[1:40:18] God removed something that had been in
[1:40:22] place for four thousand years
[1:40:26] and that was a blood sacrifice
[1:40:29] [Music]
[1:40:31] these
[1:40:32] animals whether it be goats or bulls or
[1:40:37] Lambs these animals would be sacrificed
[1:40:40] because of our sin
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:44] that was taken out
[1:40:47] and it was replaced
[1:40:50] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:40:54] and that atonement will last from here
[1:40:57] until eternity through eternity it was
[1:41:00] Jesus Christ that died that took that
[1:41:05] sin away replaced the blood of bulls and
[1:41:09] ghosts the Bloods of animals that was
[1:41:10] not pure anyways and replaced it with
[1:41:13] the pure blood of the Lamb of God
[1:41:18] and today we have that the ultimate
[1:41:21] removal and replacement of something
[1:41:24] that's right let's bow our heads
[1:41:30] just think about his goodness
[1:41:34] and as we meditate on him just just for
[1:41:38] a minute
[1:41:40] think about the things that are in your
[1:41:43] lives
[1:41:45] each one
[1:41:47] think about something that needs to come
[1:41:49] out
[1:41:52] of my life
[1:41:56] something I need to change and all of us
[1:41:58] have a lot of things
[1:41:59] but something that's in my life that I
[1:42:01] need to change Lord
[1:42:04] as I make that effort to change it
[1:42:08] I ask by Your Word
[1:42:12] that you would replace that void
[1:42:16] [Music]
[1:42:19] let that house that has been made clean
[1:42:22] let it be filled
[1:42:25] but the holy spirit of God
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:32] think about him friends think about what
[1:42:34] he's done for us
[1:42:37] think about yourself think about what
[1:42:38] you need to do
[1:42:39] [Music]
[1:42:46] Lord it is written in your word
[1:42:50] about a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:42:53] intents of the heart
[1:42:55] and Lord as you look down upon this
[1:42:58] audience
[1:42:59] and you look down upon me Lord
[1:43:05] I ask that
[1:43:07] these voids that are created in our
[1:43:09] lives
[1:43:12] Lord may they be replaced
[1:43:15] things of God
[1:43:17] [Music]
[1:43:19] these houses that we do our best to make
[1:43:21] clean
[1:43:24] these vessels
[1:43:26] Lord may they be filled with the one
[1:43:28] Spirit the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:43:31] the Holy Spirit
[1:43:34] granted Lord we pray
[1:43:38] we love you

[1:49:31] some of the younger ones learning
[1:49:33] experiences of life

[1:49:38] would get angry and upset and frustrated
[1:49:41] at home at work
[1:49:43] rather than take it out on someone
[1:49:46] [Music]
[1:49:47] I'd go outside in the yard and I'd clean
[1:49:49] it
[1:49:51] I'd go wash the car I'd go do something
[1:49:54] and burn all that energy away
[1:49:56] and then I could come back in and say
[1:49:59] I'm sorry
[1:50:01] and not reach act in anger in harshness
[1:50:06] but rather and then
[1:50:09] it's just the fellowship is so much
[1:50:11] better that way
[1:50:13] you say Lord I'm sorry I made a mess
[1:50:16] again
[1:50:18] I'm sorry
[1:50:19] but rather than just forgiving me Lord
[1:50:21] help me to fill it with something good
[1:50:24] something that that will be beneficial
[1:50:26] something that somebody else can receive
[1:50:29] from that would be our
