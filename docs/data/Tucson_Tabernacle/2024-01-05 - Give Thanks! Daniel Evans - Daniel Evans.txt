your brother and family so jining with us today and uh we want to thank the Lord that the pastor is back amen I was telling him that we miss you there was a very big gap here and uh Church been praying and we heard you from wherever you were and we are thank that the pastor is back we have a family here and this brother I I I I I feel as I'm standing here that this man is a singer yeah the brother is a singer so brother Aon says brother Jonathan the man is a singer I said we want him to sing before he goes back so he must come and sing for us so brother Russo walk over my brother and sing for us and um um God bless you my brother maybe just say something to the church and then you sing for us God bless let me greet you first thank you God bless you these are my nieces brother I know so their their mother is my wife's sister so okay okay I haven't met you but I appreciate your enthusiasm I love the colored Saints so look forward to some fellowship so I'm glad you asked me to greet the Saints because I wanted to sing the song I was conscripted not volunteered so I guess I have the Liberty to but uh I wanted to sing the song He leadth me beautiful old hymn but in singing that just the second verse is so so precious the songwriter says sometimes he leadth me through scenes of deepest Gloom and in this Earthly Journey there's a lot of dark days but also he leads me where Eden's flowers bloom over Waters calm sometimes over troubled Seas but still it's is God's hand that leadth me and what a rest we have as Christians to know that whatever comes our way first must pass through the hand of our father and there's such a rest in that but could I just share a little story you may know what I just learned about the monarch butterfly a couple years ago and I'm embarrassed to say that you may all be educated to know all those things but it was such a striking thing to me to hear about the little monarch butterfly that starts in Mexico and every spring it starts a migration to Canada so it's 3,000 miles but they don't make it in one trip it takes three or four generations so that butterfly that starts from Mexico goes a certain distance stops makes a cocoon cocoons up it dies another Butterfly Come lays its eggs and then another but butterfly comes forth but it does that for three or four generations before it gets to Canada does everybody know this am I telling you stuff is anybody is anybody this new to you okay well it was new to me but I'll refresh your memory so that butterfly now the fifth generation is born in Canada never it's it's great great grandfather or grandmother that left Mexico and so that fifth generation now it migrates back to Mexico but doesn't do it in in four stages in one flight that 3,000 miles from Canada to Mexico and it goes back to the same 40 acres and a lot of times the very same tree that his great great grandfather or grandmother came from when it migrated to Canada so it's supernatural there's no way the scripture says the fool hath said in his heart there is no God no way for that little in insect brain to do that it's super totally Supernatural and there's so many things in nature we see that are so Supernatural like that but I like to think so God leads that little butterfly fifth generation from Canada all the way back to that same tree A lot of times and that's the animal kingdom but we're Made In His Image right we're Sons and Daughters of God how much can we have confidence that God will lead us so we'll sing this song He leadth me oh blessed thought well he that's going to be too low what are we on G that's what we said wasn't it he leadth me oh blessed thought oh words with Heavenly Comfort front what I do whereare I be still is God God's hand that leadth me he leadth me he leadth Me by his own hand he leadth me his faithful follower I would be for by his hand he Le me sometimes mid scenes of deepest Gloom sometimes where Eden flowers bloom by Waters C or troubled sea still T God's hand that leadth me he lead leth me he leth well by his own hand he leadth me and his faithful follower I would be for by his hand he leadth me Lord I would clasp my hand in in thine nor ever murmur nor repine content whatever lot I see since T my God that leadth me and when my task on Earth is done when by thy Grace the victories W even death's cold wave I will not flee since God through Jordan leth me he leadth me he leadth Me by his own hand he Le leth me his faithful follower I would be for by his hand he leadth [Music] me hallelujah thank [Applause] you he leaded me he lead me I he leth me faithful for would be but is her [Music] he one more time he he me but [Music] he he is worthful for will be for by his he shall we stand on our feet let's bow our heads in that same Spirit of worship you can close your eyes raise your hand to him if you [Music] can [Music] be be all things are [Music] possible yes Lord Oh Be Oh Be All Things Are [Music] possible [Music] ho Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I [Music] believe all things are possible Lord I [Music] believe Lord I [Music] be Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I be amen while that spirit is with us let's turn in the word of God open our bies The Same Spirit that wrote these words that I'm about to read is the Same Spirit that's here with us now Philippians chapter 4 verse [Music] 8 [Music] says [Music] this finally Brethren whatsoever things are true Hallelujah whatsoever things are honest Hallelujah whatsoever things are just oh yes whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue yes and if there be any praise think on these things Hallelujah let's bow our heads as the music [Music] plays all that are present think about the good things in life think about what you've been given if you have something upon your heart that you would like to give God thanks for just raise your hand now and in your heart say Lord I thank [Music] you Father we give you thanks Lord you look over the banisters of Heaven now and Lord your word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart you come down and Lord you know

the front and the sister God bless you welcome it's good to have you and I think there's other visitors that I see welcome to everyone it's it's an honor to be able to worship together and and think about that scripture that I just read finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things we think on all the bad things so often but the Apostle Paul right here is saying hey think on the good things be thankful for what you have I want to talk about this morning about the importance of returning thanks to our Lord there's there's so much friends we have to be thankful for I got this um this little flyer in the mail uh uh while we were we were gone and it's from the William brandom I'm sorry the um Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and uh just a really well done flyer and uh they're just advertising some of the things that they're they're doing and and wanting support for it um but it it has some different just some different short statements in there and I turn to this one right here and it said 65 million Americans ages 12 and older Abus or addicted to drugs or alcohol 65 million Americans how many Americans are there 325 330 million 65 million of those are addicted and abusing these substances I think Lord this is this is a there's never been a time think of the percentage there's never been a time like that and I I was thinking uh the the song that you sang and and and the testimony that you gave about these butterflies they're not going to make it that first generation didn't make it and another generation didn't make it generation after generation but there was a generation that made it I want to be in that generation that finally makes it that finally gets there think of what this is what they're doing here this great organization and and how they're spreading the gospel and and they're doing everything that they can and I I I read all that they're doing in different parts of the world and it almost makes me ashamed of myself and saying that if we really believe if we really believe that there was a sign of the end time if we really believe that God had sent a forerunner to his second coming of Christ let me ask you this why don't your neighbors know sure why don't everybody when we walk down the street why doesn't everyone know that God is is that Jesus is returning soon people need him we look 65 million abusing drugs and alcohol 23 million Americans struggle with depression and over 40,000 commit suicide each year 23 million Americans struggle with with depression Jesus Christ the hope of Jesus Jesus Christ can take away that depression knowing that Christ can solve all of these problems 40 million people in the United States feel trapped or crippled by fear 40 million there should be no fear what do we have to fear if we have the gospel of Christ I look at those things and I I think if we call ourselves the bride of Christ and we really believe that God sent a forerunner we really be believe that it's coming we should be always about the father's business always about serving him always about doing something for the lost if we really believe it but then there's a denomination over here that says oh we're fine we're good we're the elite we we got it all we got it all put together I'm okay I'm fine I'm good just shows that we're not if we're thinking that if there isn't a deep burning desire to help lost souls within it there is something wrong we point our fingers at somebody else and say they're a sinner we're the Sinners we are the ones that are sinful pointing our fingers at someone else and saying I'm good I'm going to sit on my high mountain and just enjoy my my greatness no we should be out doing working because this is the worst society that has ever been we are the entitled Society I was watching there's a videoos trending on on YouTube don't watch YouTube it's bad not that I was watching but if I was watching there there are some YouTube videos trending of these these young 20s somethings that have just got out of college and now they're going to to work and they're crying on the on the video and they're so sad I have to wake up at 6:30 in the morning and then I have to get ready and I have to drive 30 minutes to my job and then I have to work eight hours and by the time I get done it's like almost dark and I have to drive 30 minutes home and when I I when I get home I'm so tired that I don't have time to do what I want to do there's no me Time come on complaining and complaining and complaining and not giving God thanks that you have a job not giving God thing thanks that you have an income oh my when when I take my rent out and when I take my car insurance out and when I when I take all my my utilities out there's barely enough for me welcome to the real world you're living in a in a false world and we're ra this generation coming up and I'm not just dogging on this generation because I believe that the the worst that it is the the the the most bad generation that could rise up that same generation will have the absolute best that will counter that God will raise up a standard and it'll be out of that same generation and they're crying but they're they're they're upset that they have to go to work and they don't have any time for themselves and we're seeing that it's an unth thankful generation it's an Unholy generation that they're not thankful what for what they have they're not thankful that they can go to school they're not thankful brother Jonathan back there my my dear friend you know let me give a little rose right now God took that man from Africa and he placed him right here with us and he's a blessing he's and he's a dear friend of mine and and brother Jonathan I love you so much but brother Jonathan his children are in school and they want to go to school they're not entitled they're trying to find some way that they can pay for for the kids to go to school and they appreciate it but here with us we're entitled oh I get to go to school if Mom and Dad can't pay for it the government some will pay for it I might not get to go to Stanford but I can go to Puma and unth thankful Unholy the Bible says Luke 6:35 these are this is the Lord Jesus talking listen to his words this is the Luke version of the beatitude Matthew Chapter 5 and then Luke 6:35 listen to this Jesus instructing us and he says this but love your enemies amen and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind speaking of God for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil so what he's saying here Jesus is saying he's saying listen he says you loan some on something with the hope that they don't pay it back well that's strange that's an odd way of thinking and not only that but you loan it to that person who is against you who might hate you you loan it to that person with the hope that he doesn't pay it back especially it's the strangest thing especially if you're lending it to someone who doesn't like you and then sentence starts with but love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing in return and then your reward shall be great what Jesus is doing is he's trying to get the audience to understand the nature of God and then for us the audience to take on that same nature if you love your enemies and lend then if you get nothing in return for Lending then your reward shall be great and you will be the children of the highest just you'll be just like your father because he gave his own son to those that hated him for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil you notice he puts the unthankful and the evil right next to each other and you say well unthankful that's not that big of a deal it's right next to evil he's pretty much saying it's the same person and I ask us all of us we would never put ourselves in the evil spot but do we put ourselves in unthankful place are we there are we not thankful for what God has given us but today there's almost no thankfulness it seems in the heart of the people everywhere let's turn to Second Timothy chapter 3 read this scripture Paul in this portion of the his letter he's telling us what to watch for right before the second coming of Christ Christ what to watch for in the end times this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come this is a scripture being quot oted throughout the world by ministers saying hey we're there and we can spend really years every service just going through just this these scriptures and and show how we are in these days know this also that in the last days perilous time shall come for men should be lovers of their own selves Instagram Snapchat Facebook people constantly posting pictures of themselves changing the pictures to make themselves look better loving their own image I added that part Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disob disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors hey high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of God godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away right here he's speaking to God's people and he says hey these unthankful people turn away from them and all these other sinful people the last age described in Revelation chapter 3 I know it doesn't say ages in our Bible doesn't say Church ages it says unto the angel of the Church of in this whatever City it is leoda in this case but we know that these are ages they're periods of time and in this last age which is the Revelation which is the um leoan age it says this Revelation 3 chapter 15 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth what does that mean I will spew thee out of my mouth you know what it means it means it makes God want to throw up I'll I'll spew you out of my mouth it makes me sick it so disgusts God this lukewarm age that we live in because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowing knowest thou not that thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked so you don't know with all the self-promotion that goes on in the world we with all of our riches and all of our popularity we don't know that we are truly miserable and naked poor and blind right out there for everyone to see have you seen the I know I know probably I don't know maybe if the the the young ones there was a fairy tale you know the emperor with no clothes remember that do you kids know what that story is oh brother Dan you haven't taught your kids the emperor with no clothes it's it's a story where where this Emperor he gets swindled so he's going and and he um goes to this this salesman on the street and he says I want the KN cuz he's the best he's this narcissistic leader guy and he wants something better than everybody else so he he comes to this this Taylor and he says Hey the Taylor says hey I got something for you and he goes like this and he says look at this beautiful garment he says only a righteous man I forgot what it was only a great man or something great people can see this garment do you see how beautiful it is and it's sitting there and he's not holding up anything and the King's like yeah really nice wow I need that so he takes it and gives the guy the money and so the emperor takes off his clothes and then puts on nothing and then goes out and parades in front of the people and embarrasses himself and he gets swindled he pays this great amount of money for something that doesn't exist and he's out there and in front of the people and they're laughing at him and that's this Leo to see an age we think we're great we think we've got it we think we're better than everybody else and here we are out in the world for every with everybody seeing all of our faults and all of our problems and the Lord says the Lord Jesus says right here you're blind and miserable and naked and wretched and you don't even know it a perfect example of the leoan age of this age that we live in and Jesus says this in verse number 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold me stop that word that repent I don't think I'll get there today but that word repent repent also brings Thanksgiving when you really see you're wrong and you really see you've messed up and you've done you you've made a mistake you've sinned when you repent and you say Lord I'm sorry I I've done this wrong and then you see the grace of Jesus Christ and the love of Christ and the blood that was shed on that cross and then you're just grateful Lord thank you so much thank you that even though I have sinned even though I've messed up my life I've made all of these mistakes you still can make it right and you do repentance brings that Thanksgiving how thankful we are that even with our mistakes that God can make them right behold I stand at the door and knock If any man if anyone this is how bad the situation is not of just the best but if anyone hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and I will Su with him and he with me anyone that opens that door for me I'm going to come in this is such a bad age this is such a rotten age this is there is just no love there's no thankfulness there's just anyone it's such a sad thought that he's there he'll come in to anywhere if anyone will accept it yes to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith in the churches I think where is that Thanksgiving today where is that lovely Spirit about how much I love God and how much he's done for me if you want a witness if you want to really lead someone to Christ if you want if you want to go out and you want to change someone's life if you want to help them you don't go and say you're wrong because it says right here that that you're um baptizing wrong or you're doing this wrong or that wrong that's usually not the way to do it what you do is you go and say I want to tell you what God has done for me I was once lost and now I'm found I was once a sinner now I loved the Lord now I serve him and now just happiness is overflowing from me are you rich no I can barely make my bills are you what's changed in your life what's changed in my life is I have the hope of Jesus Christ I know that whatever place I get to wherever I am that Christ is able to deliver me and take me out of that but it has to be real within us first before we can witness to someone else that's how we get a convert that's how we bring people to the Lord because we're not bringing them to church or to a Doctrine we're bringing them to Christ and how much does he love us I want to say Lord I want to tell everybody God loves me I'm part of him well brother Daniel you make this mistake and that mistake and that mistake right that's that's the best part about about it I make these mistakes but God has brought me out of that and he's made he's given me such joy in my heart that's the whole thing once we have that and then we can give it to someone else thank God you I've just given you Jesus Christ I've just introduced you to him now you talk to him because I'm GNA fail go to him and that is the role of a minister brother that's the role of a pastor that is the role of an evangelist that's the role of a prophet that's the role of an apostle it is the role of all of the ministry is the point people to Christ and not only the ministry but all of us every person in this room I want to tell you why I'm so happy it's because Jesus Christ is alive we want such great Mysteries and and we have we've we've had these wonderful Mysteries revealed to us but the prophet himself you know what the greatest mystery is all of them there they're great there's so many great Mysteries that that have been revealed to us from baptism to to the Serpent's Seed to all of these different things you know what the prophet said the title of one of his sermons the greatest mystery Christ is the mystery of God revealed this book this mysterious book this Old Testament it's all Jesus Christ everything that they were looking for it's all revealed in a man named Christ I uh I think about how just how thankful how thankful and I I am and I know I come back from vacation and I feel good I feel rested but every day I wake up in the morning as I'm laying there I'm thanking the lord and and I have this picture in my my mind of of the church and I look out on the church and I see each one sitting there just a memory that that that from every service it's just most people sit about in the same place and I I just go through and I thank the Lord for every person and how just Lord I I thank you for their walk with the Lord and how much they love the Lord and and it's just such a strength to me and I just Lord I love him so much I'm so thankful that we have a church I'm so thankful that we have a place to worship because there's a chance that it will be taken away this is one of the few countries in the world that we could just go to any church that we want to and we see things starting to change I mean look at what has happened did you see just in this past week the anti-Semitism there was a teacher that went to a pro-israel rally and took a picture with a sign saying something on the order I'm from Israel the school rioted I think it was a I think it was a woman teacher she was locked herself up in a room scared to death that they were going to rip her out of her room and beat her this is in the United States of America how fast are things changing we think back in back in the 30s and 40s the anti-Semitism and and hating of Israel and we were they never thought that that could happen but it happened and it spread throughout good people yes and we think oh it'll never happen again it's happening now God brought them back to their Homeland and they they get into Israel and they say never again this is never happening again Jews you can come here and you can be sa safe and look at how much the world hates that place hates it why because they are Jews because they are God's people hating them wanting to kill them in this country was it in ger no was Russia planes were flying in from from what they thought was Israel and the people were going checking passports on the plane looking for Jews this is now things are changing and we should say Lord protect your people this was prophesied to come here we are now come to Christ that is your only salvation that is your only Refuge is Jesus Christ we're seeing it everywhere in fact I'll tell you how close it is God s his Forerunner do we really believe do we really believe it I think not I think we get stuck in our doctrines and we get stuck in our rules and and all of our regulations but we do do we look and see what the message is that Jesus Christ is coming soon that's the most important thing and we should be shouting it from the housetops saying get ready there was there's a this Thanksgiving holiday had just has just passed and Abraham Lincoln the greatest president that this country has ever seen is the one that signed the order to make Thanksgiving a holiday and it's just you look at the meaning behind Thanksgiving and the meaning is to give God praise and thanks for what he has given all of us what a holiday I mean tremendous holiday that this holiday is dedicated to what thanking God I love Christmas too it's dedicated to Jesus Christ wonderful but this Abraham Lincoln sign this it shows you that things have changed in this country abrah Abraham Lincoln signed this Proclamation that we have this federal holiday and it was because of what those pilgrims what our forefathers had done to make it to where we can be in this church because they didn't have that the ones that came from from Europe they didn't have what we have they couldn't worship freely like we worship there's a quote I'd like to read William brandom says this sometimes it costs you something anything that doesn't cost you something isn't worth having that's right all great things has to be paid for the reason we're worshiping today freedom of religion in this thing Thanksgiving Day this cost the blood of many American millions of them it's worth something and if it's worth something it's worth dying for and this religion that we have this Pentecostal Holy Spirit that's fell on us bring back to us a resurrected Jesus Christ alive after 1900 years it's worth all of our time our efforts and everything that we do it's worth all to us yes but instead we see an unthankful generation rise up today and our generation was unth thankful too and the generations before us were unthankful the more we are given the less thankful we are the easier we have it the less thanks we give to God isn't that strange it's only when we get sick and the Lord heals us that we give God we give God thanks it's only that when we have problems that we give God thanks when we're going through life like this generation like this leot to seea and age that we're in now we don't give God thanks because it's too easy what a strange thing we're not thanking God every day for how easy we have it instead we only thank him when things get hard times that I have been the most desperate in my life me personally is when God has spoken to me the most it's because I've cried out to him with the most sincerity and that's when I see God coming on the scene and taking care of me why aren't I crying out like that every day just giving him glory just saying Lord thank you so much I love you so much thank you for that I get to breathe thank you that my heart's beating thank you that I have children thank you that I have a wife thank you that I have I have parents my parents have gone on but thank you that they took care of me thank you that I have food on the table thank you that I have a job thank you that I have a church but instead We complain my God my drive my drive to work is too far you have a job I don't like the way the pastor's teaching you have a church it's it's the way it's this Modern Way Romans chapter 5 this is tremendous my favorite one of my favorites they're all my favorite Romans 51 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into the grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so listen to this but we glory in tribul ations also another strange statement but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulations worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope that word experience every other translation that I found was a proven character it works it makes us it gives us character these tribulations and trials that we have and Hope maketh not ashame it doesn't put us to shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us friends when we have suffered whether it be by oural mistakes or things that that we didn't have anything to do with that that just happened when we suffer it God is using that to build our character character to help us because there's a there's work to be done in the future and we are getting trained and we're getting character built within us that we can survive in the times coming these tribulations don't say Lord why am I going through this Lord why do I have to suffer all of this listen you're not suffering anything that anybody else isn't suffering you're going through these things and I go through these things to build our character to help us they blessings that's why the Apostle here is saying these are don't don't shun these things these are blessings this uh Abraham Lincoln quoted in a speech in 1859 he quoted a um an old per old Persian writing Persian literature from the 12th century and it says this Abraham Lincoln was quoting that and he says this and this too shall pass away which is from that 12th century Persian writing and this too shall pass away Abraham Lincoln says how much it expresses that saying how chastening in the hour of Pride how consoling in the depths of Affliction and this too shall pass away knowing that whatever we're going through whether it be good times they're going to pass away whether it be hard times it's going to pass away don't get discouraged it's going to pass away but one thing that should never pass away is our Thanksgiving to God to finish up the Thanksgiving holiday comes from a a great time in the history of it wasn't the United States then what but what would become the United States there were two ships leaving from northern Europe from Europe for this new land that was being called America it was this was a place of hope where they could finally find a place that they could attend any church that they wanted to and not be forced into a certain way of thinking they wanted to freely worship God that was the main reason they left in 1620 two ships were leading leaving Europe the speed well and the Mayflower before they Departed the ship speed well and Del Halen Holland Del Haven Holland it's a blessing that we have brothers from Holland here our roots go back to Holland right here Pastor John Robinson Pastor there in Holland gave this address to part of his congregation that would be leaving him and going into the unknown and these are some of the most inspired words that I have ever read and you can find these in many many history books today and how much do they apply now to us Pastor John Robinson says this I charge you before God and His blessed angels that you follow me no further further than you have seen me follow the lord Jesus Christ what a pastor what a wonderful thing to say if God reveals anything to you by any other instrument of his be as ready to receive it as you were to receive any Truth by my Ministry for I am verily persuaded the Lord hath more truth Yet To Break Forth out of his holy word these are people that were suffering persecution these are people that weren't allowed to to congregate unless they believed a certain way and I'm going to and what he says right now proves it for by for my part I cannot sufficiently bewail the condition of those reformed churches which are come to a period in religion and will go at present no further than the instruments of their Reformation what does that mean the lutherans cannot be drawn on to go beyond to what Luther saw whatever part of his will our God has revealed to Calvin another great man of God they will rather die than to embrace it and the Calvinists you see stick fast to where they were left by that great man of God who yet saw not all things this is a misery much to be lamented for though they were burning and Shining lights in their time yet they penetrated not into the whole Council of God but were but were they now living would be as willing to embrace further light as that which they first received for it is not possible the Christian should come so lately out of such thick anti-christian Darkness these are Christian churches by the way and Pastor here is saying they're coming out of anti-christian darkness and that Perfection of knowledge should break forth at once how inspired this man's words as he addresses his congregation that was about to go on this ship the speed well into the unknown so with tears in their eyes they set forth sailing to England they hooked up with the Mayflower and they started sailing West very quickly the speed well sprang a leak and they had to go back they tried to fix it they couldn't fix it so all of the I believe it was 102 um total passengers they all squeezed into one ship and they took off headed west in the Mayflower they traveled 2700 miles west and it was months that they that they took it was there was great storms and there was the main sail broke and the Mayflower they had all kinds of people 130 people I believe was total with all the crew and everything they're going and they're they're traveling west and then they finally on they finally make ground and then their troubles they made it to the promised land they made it to the United to not the United States but to America and on December 25th they leave the mayl hour some of them and start construction of houses and a settlement from that time almost one year until the last Thursday of the month in November half half of them died their children their wives their husbands half of them died died from exposure to the elements half of them died from malnutrition from disease and then they meet some kind-hearted Indians and these Indians helped them they they showed them how to plant corn they showed them how to to take the sap out of maple trees they showed them how to fish they taught them how to survive all the while people are dying and they're struggling and they're they they're they're going through all these tribulations then on at the end of November they have a feast they had been taught that hey you plant corn take your dead fish and throw it in the in the dirt and it'll fertilize it it'll help the corn grow things like that things that they they never knew before and then the leader gets there invites the natives that were there and they have a feast they didn't say we've had a hard year and this is miserable and that boat ride over here was really tough it was bad Stephanie and I were complaining because we had a five hour flight Air Conditioning you know can I have another Coke Zero thank you it's like I'm sore months they were people dying cold coming to come to a place of freedom of worship where they could build a new land they had Thanksgiving and God took these people and built a country from these people not because they complained not because they had they they lamented all their problems but because they saw hope in the future that's why we celebrate this this great day of Thanksgiving and look what's been built we here now are a result of the sacrifices that they made yes in this church thank God for them thank God for men and women that would stand up to tyranny that would say no Calvin was a great man but no I don't have to be a calvinist John Wesley was a b great man I don't have to be a Methodist Martin Luther was a great man I don't have to be a Lutheran I can believe Jesus Christ I can worship him those were great men but let me just worship God and stop persecuting me and it meant so much to them they didn't just switch churches they couldn't switch churches it meant so much to them that they risked everything that they had to head west across perilous times perilous ocean and to build a place that was free that's why it's the greatest country in the world even today even with all the problems that we're seeing even with the the filth that we see coming out of Hollywood and and through the government and all of that yet it's still the greatest country and I am proud of it and I thank God for it thank God that we can worship thank God that we can talk with each other thank God that we have our health thank God that we have a a a Bible that we can read men gave their lives so that we could have this Bi Bible William tendale Martin Luther lived about the same time here's Martin Luther over here sneaking the Hebrew and the Greek manuscripts and translating the Bible into German same time we have William tendale over here and he's getting these manuscripts and he is translating the Bible into English they burned him at the stake tendale killed him and he was thankful he was thankful that he got to do it I'm thankful that he did it we are we are stepping on this Foundation that these great men and women of God have laid and we should never forget what they have done but we need to be those men and women today I will stand Lord I'll stand
