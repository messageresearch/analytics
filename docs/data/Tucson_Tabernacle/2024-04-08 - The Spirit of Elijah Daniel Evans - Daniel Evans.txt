seats I'm going to be a little bit so y'all can sit down if you want you can stay you can stay um I wanted to talk to the congregation a little bit I knew that it was just going to be the pillars in the church tonight not that there aren't some pillars missing but I um I wanted to talk just tell the congregation some things that are on my heart and then we will have prayer um this morning as I was ministering I stopped a little short in a in a couple things one of the main things that I stopped short in was when I said that God will send a messenger God will send a servant and when he takes that servant away then the people slip into sin and I I just kind of stopped right there and and I didn't elaborate on I had in my notes to say some things but now that we're just family I wanted to say what I wanted to say this morning and what happens and we see it we've been going through our Bible study and it's been just such a blessing and we can see that the same things just happen over and over again throughout history we see in the Book of Judges when Joshua the servant of the Lord in the Book of Joshua we see Moses dies on the mountain in the end of Deuteronomy and then we see Joshua step on the scene and he takes that mantle that Moses has and the people see that oh as the Lord was with Moses so he is with Joshua then Joshua took the people they crossed over the Jordan River and they started Conquering the land that God had given to their ancestors God had promised to the ancestors and now it was being fulfilled but then when Joshua died and those that were close to Joshua died that's when the Book of Judges started and that's when we see the people start to fall into sin and it happens again and again even we just went through 2 Chronicles and we see how Josiah the king how the priest they the workers they found the Bible in church and it had not been read for years crazy how can you have a Bible in church and them not read the Bible so they find the Bible they're like oh look Josiah it's the book of Moses and he's like what wow we are sinning so he falls down and he repents and then the Lord blesses happens again and again it happened when the Lord Jesus was here the disciples took over and when those disciples died away do you remember who is the last disciple to die John John died an old man he died of old age when the disciples died then we see weird doctrines start to enter into the church very strange stuff worshiping Peter worshiping Mary I mean this is this is what the I don't know if it's the uh the Hail Mary they say Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women the Lord is with thee she was dead for hundreds of years when they wrote this the Lord is with thee blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners pray for us sinners she's dead she'd been dead for hundreds of years but do you see how strange this starts to slip in when those Servants of God would were out pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death weirdness starts to come in what do you think Mary would have said if someone would have brought that to her she'd have been like son what are you talking about it's Jesus Christ he's the one that rose from the dead He's My Savior too but instead odd things start to slip in when those Servants of the Lord are taken off the scene and remember we're family here and I'm sharing my thoughts on this we see when brother branam was here Mighty things happened powerful prayer lines and brother Brandon was up there preaching the seven Church ages the Seven Seals revealing these Mysteries to the people and it was just a tremendous time who is this MDC what a sermon if you haven't heard that one deep Souls that are in prison now tremendous sermons The People people were listening and the people were blessed and the people continued to be healed and we continued to see signs and wonders and then brother Branham was taken off the scene brother brandham said this he made this statement he said the miracle of Martin Luther's Ministry was not in that he stood against the Catholic Church it was that he was able to rise above all the fanaticism that followed his ministry have you ever read any fanaticism that followed Martin Luther's Ministry I've never been able to find it I think brother brandham was giving us a hint I think he was warning us about him now I'm sure there was there was there was fanaticism that followed Martin Luther's Ministry there was this thing called the Lutheran denomination yeah I mean and and you know and the Jews and and the persecution and and all of that I understand that but he was Martin Luther raised above that fanaticism now we have brother brandham and brother brandham passes away tremendous message tremendous man of God a true prophet of God and then he comes off the scene and the people start dissecting his message taking a quote here and a quote there and stringing them together and making doctrines out of them and ignoring 99% of what he talked about which is what I was trying to say this morning you take out Jesus Christ from Brother 's message 99% of his message it's pulled out and it's replaced with quotes about brother Brandon with quotes about legalism with quotes about all of these different things maybe won't make the video public but brother brandham I don't believe believed like we believe today I don't believe he taught that but as I said that happens every single time people take this great man's message and they mess it up and they turn it into denomination and they start drawing circles and saying we are the Elite man it ain't new with us they did it with Martin Luther they did it with John Wesley have you heard of the methodists and then the methodists couldn't get along with methodists and then they say the wesland you know and then you have the the new lutherans and the old lutherans and and all of this stuff and and and they all fight and they did exactly what we've done it's just weirdness that follows and that's what I was trying to say this morning brothers and sisters without just in a full crowd without just coming out and saying it but we've done the same thing that has been happening throughout history it happened with the disciples with Mary and worshiping Peter and and and lifting up Peter and you go to a Catholic church and man you got Peter over here and Mary over here and it's like this is very odd really strange I was um I was in Israel and uh I went to the Church of the multiplication um there's a church brother Lyall they built a church on everything who knows where it happened but this is called The Church of the multiplication it was actually built I think on an old um I think there was an old synagogue there but this is where they say Jesus um multiplied the fishes and the loaves so I'm I'm I'm in here and and I'm by myself and I'm on a soul searching trip Heath this is this is I'm really trying to find like Lord I need to find you I need to understand what you want so Stephanie she saw that her husband was ready to die I was as depressed as you can be so Stephanie my sweetheart of a wife buys me a plane ticket to Jerusalem and she tells me this she says honey I want you to go by yourself because I know you and I know that if you're by yourself then you'll be able to get what you want what you need so God on plane I flew there and I started just taking this in and I was I was praying and and going to these different places and just eating and brother ly wouldn't you love to take our congregation there oh man [Laughter] huh don't laugh we got a good tour guide back there um we might maybe maybe we'll uh maybe um so I at this church of the multiplication and I looked down and there is obviously two different rooms there was an addition there was a renovation maybe like we're doing over here but it looked like an addition so I'm looking at the floor that I'm standing on and and it's it's the church and there's there's pews in there and the um the floor was geometric designs and then I look over in this Wing over here and there's like a swan and ducks and animals and and and I thought that's weird and I'm looking at the I'm looking at geometric designs and I'm looking at this and and there was a a seam in the middle and the tour guide he says he asked me he says um do you see the difference and I was like yeah he says do you see the difference in the design and I said yeah well this one's pictures over here and this is just just design and he said and this guy was Hardcore Jew he did not like Christians I you could feel it from him just didn't respect Christians so he's uh he says that he says see this was originally built by the original Jewish people and he said then this over here he used these words with all of the graven images he said this was added later he said in 300 and something there was this man named con Constantine that brought in graven images and taught the people to worship those graven images and now you see all of these images other places but before that they never have it he said a Jew would never put a Graven image and I thought I knew that I read the church A's book and so my point in saying that is when the men of God and the women of God leave then apostasy and idolatry enters into the church and really just strangeness odd beliefs why would you worship Peter and James and John they take a I was in the Catholic bookstore I don't know six months ago so and I saw that they have this little saint that you bury in your yard if you want to sell your house and that'll help you sell your house huh oh yeah it's Catholicism and this goes way back and what had happened in is RO when Rome when it when they they started persecuting Rome the ones that really they knew Jesus and they were with Jesus and they were with the Disciples of Jesus they were forced out that First Church of Rome you read the book of Romans that First Church of Rome was solid strong Believers and you look in that book it's like wow this is some heavy stuff the Apostle Paul could really talk to these people but those people were forced out of Rome and they were replaced by another generation that didn't know Jesus they didn't know these disciples and they brought in all of these weird doctrines and we see the same thing all the way to now we see when brother brandom passed away immediately strange stuff started coming in they said he's going to resurrect whoa where is that prophesied but a lot of people thought it and then they started as I said they started dissecting his message and and started bringing in this seven Thunders Doctrine and then started bringing in this tapes only Doctrine and you know these doctrines were there in questions and answers right brother Bram addressed them 1964 he addressed those questions they said brother brandom are we to be paraphrasing are we to be perfected by the tapes are we to listen to anybody else or by Ephesians 4 I believe it was it was it was the gist of it was are we to be perfected by the the tapes brother Jonathan or the five-fold ministry you know what brother Brandon's answer was no beautiful answer wonderful answer he said no he said the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride and that by the holy spirit so those Spirits were there when he was here but it took the man passing away for them to really rise to power and brothers and sisters I believe that we are suffering for these doctrines that have entered into the church and I believe that we have taken Jesus Christ out of the message that's why it's so important to me to preach Christ because that was the foundation that the prophet preached all the prophets preached that it was the foundation of the disciples it was a foundation of the the apostles they preached Jesus Christ open up your Bible to anywhere past Matthew and find me a sermon that's not about Jesus they're not there no even this mysterious book called The Hebrews that was written the the author is mysterious we believe it's the Apostle Paul and he wrote this book that looks like it could be brother L could have be taken right out of the Old Testament and it talks about this man MDC and it talks about the Sabbath and it talks about all of these just incredible subjects and it brings it all right back to Jesus Christ am so what I wanted to do tonight I wanted to take a few minutes and I want to go through some scriptures and I didn't have time I just came up with this idea uh like 30 minutes ago so I didn't really have time to put a lot of scriptures together but I think that we can cover it so what is this man who we believe to be a prophet of God a modernday prophet of God a 20th century Prophet where is this guy in the Bible and we hear hear so many things all Malachi 4 and all this and this Malachi 3 and Luke 17:30 and in Revelation 10 let's let's let's just let's just go right to the Bible and let's read it and it would be a good time to take notes and jot some of these scriptures down so we look I read the scripture this morning in Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 brother Jeremy if you could put that up where Jesus came to his disciples and he said who do you say that I am or who does the people say that I am and then they answered and they said this Matthew 16:13 says this when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi am I right Matthew 16:13 yeah when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his deciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am now listen to this don't just read over these scriptures very very important thing right here and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist remember John was dead had been murdered by Herod some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias Elias is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Elijah the New Testament Matthew Mark L Luke and John was written the original langu language was written in Greek even though it was written by Jews do you know why it's awesome the reason why is because the common language of the day was Greek if they would have written it in Aramaic or Hebrew it would have only been read by the Hebrews wow but they wanted it to go around the world so they wrote the gospels all the way from Matthew all the way to Second Timothy was written in Greek so that the Romans could read it the Greeks could read it so everybody could read it so everybody could know about this man named Jesus how it's be the Bible is just beautiful and so and when you see the word Elias and this is the beauty of the King James Bible most other trans translations will translate it to Elijah but the beauty of the King James is it preserves the original language and it says Elias and it gives you a little hint that hey this was written in Greek that's why it says Elias awesome so right here with it says some say that you're John the Baptist some say Elias others jeremias or one of the prophets so right here we know that these men had already died and they'd been dead for hundreds of years so they were expecting the spirit to come back so let's go to 2 Kings 2 verse 11 and I will give you a concrete example of how this can happen just to lay the foundation saying that you can have a man with the spirit and then that Spirit can later on come upon someone else second Kings chapter 2: 11 and it came to pass as they went on and talked I'm going to move my microphone down a little bit here um and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire this is Elijah going up being raptured up into heaven and talked and behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them into two pieces and he took also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters remember just a little bit earlier he and his mentor Elijah came up to the water Elijah takes off his jacket smacks the water and it opens up Elisha remembered that now look what he does he takes that same one that Elijah as he was going up in the ch he throws it down now Elisha's got it and they parted hither and tither I don't know what that means but apart and Elisha went over and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him so they were watching all this going on and they're like no way they saw him they said the spirit of Elijah that went up doth rest on Elisha because he did the same thing and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him so we see that the spirit that is on a prophet can somehow return and rest upon another man later or hundreds of years later proves it right here and Malachi when this man John the Baptist came Malachi was fresh on the minds of the Jews and they had a promise according to Malachi 4 that the spirit of Elijah was going to manifest itself again just like it did with Elisha so they were looking for this do you remember when Jesus was on the cross do you remember what he said I believe he it was in Aramaic that Jesus spoke which is a a language that the Jews would understand when Jesus was up there and he's hanging on the cross and he says eloi eloi Lama sabani when they listen when they heard him they said oh he's crying out for Elijah because even those knew that there was a prophecy that this Elijah was going to return so this man Elijah is on the minds of the people so they were looking for this to happen so back to Jesus when he said when he said to to Peter he said who do you say that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah read this this morning Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven and I and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church in the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so my point in reading these two scriptures is to show that the spirit of a prophet rest upon another man after that Prophet leaves and we might even call it the anointing of a prophet I don't understand it and I don't think anyone does but it can rest upon someone else and it did so now let's turn let's see let's turn to Isaiah chapter 40 brother Jeremy if you could put it up there Isaiah chapter 40 verse three and four yeah the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight the make straight in the desert a highway of our God for our God every Valley shall be exalted and and every mountain and Hill shall be made low and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough places shall be made plain all right now let's go to Matthew chapter 3 verse three it says this in those days make sure I'm in the right place I'll go back to Isaiah 40 I got it here Matthew chapter 3 verse one in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet isaas isaas is the same thing Greek for the Hebrew name Isaiah you with me so we know is written in Greek King James man it's awesome and saying repent ye for the kingdom of of Heaven is at hand for this is he who is spoken of by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness Isaiah 40 and3 what I just read prepare ye the way of the Lord again Isaiah verse 40 and3 and make p his paths straight again Isaiah 40 and4 speaking of John the Baptist so now we have established the Fulfillment here of Isaiah 40 now let's go to the Book of Malachi turn to Malachi chapter 3 verse 1 now listen to this this is awesome behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you Delight in behold he shall come sayeth the Lord of hosts now all right we got it Malachi 3 now let's go to Mark chapter 1 the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the son of God as it is written in the prophets behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee Malachi 3:1 I just read it the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight Isaiah 40 and3 I just read that one John so it shows who he's talking about John did baptize in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins so we now we now we see established that John the Baptist fulfilled Isaiah 40 and I and Malachi chapter 3 but there's more most so-called message Believers and brothers and sisters once again we're family here and these are the pillars of the church I cannot stand when we call ourself message people to me we have given ourselves a name just like the Baptist and the Presbyterian and everything else yes I believe that brother brandom had a message yes I believe it was true but I cannot stand the fact that we have done what everybody else has done and form a denomination around it and call ourselves message I read the quote one time Sister Sarah you remember when I read that quote the reason I remember is when I read it I looked directly at you and I felt like I I just I don't know why it's stuck in my head but I read a quote that said brother brandham said he said we are Presbyterian We Are Baptist he said what did you find in church in the church churches he said you should find the works that Jesus Christ did he says when you go to a church you should find that in quoted St John The Works that I do shall you do also and More Than This shall you do for I go unto my father that's what we should find but brother brandom said but what do we find we are the Methodist we are the Baptist we are the Presbyterian we got the message that's a quote puts us right in there with the denominations I don't like it I believe it it degrades brother Brandon where was I oh yeah Malachi 4 I knew where I was at I just we all know that's that's where that's our go-to scripture let's read it Malachi chapter 4 verse number one says this for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wicked these shall be stubble and and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall lead them neither root nor Branch brother brandom said and I have it written in my Bible that he said nothing left of them there's no seed there's no stump there's no root that could Sprout up later they are dead gone and destroyed but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the SW Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayeth the Lord remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord this was hundreds of years after Elijah lived but now he's saying I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse very wellknown chapter from us that that we memorize now let's go to Matthew 11:10 and we're going to go back and forth we're going to go with John the Baptist and and and the Fulfillment of these things Matthew 11 verse 10 I think I'll start with 10 verse seven let's go let's start with verse seven speaking of John the Baptist and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitude concerning John John the Baptist what we went ye out into the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out for for to seea a man clothed in soft rainment behold they that wear soft clothing are in King's houses but what went ye out for to see a prophet yay I say unto you more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare the way before me what scripture I just read it come on folks Malachi 3 and Isaiah 42 all right verily I say unto you among them that are born of a woman there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of the heaven of Heaven is greater than he remember that remember what I just said that this John the Baptist was the greatest born of a woman it's a very very important thing I'm sorry brothers and sisters I'm taking way more time than I thought I would okay I just got excited I wanted to I want to keep going all right thank you verily I say unto you among them that are born of a woman there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and violence and violent take it over by force for all the prophets and all the law prophesied until John and if ye will receive it this is Elias for which which was for to come wow right there is amazing Malachi chapter 3 does not mention Elias that's Malachi 4 but here Jesus himself is saying this is the Elijah that was to come it gets better too Matthew chapter 17 are you with me Sean are we good all right Matthew chapter 7 17 verse 11 it says this let's let's go verse 10 sorry brother Jeremy chapter 17: 10 and his his disciples yes and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come quoting what Malachi chapter 4 there weren't chapters in there back then but quoting what we call Malachi 4 and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things what does shall mean going to it doesn't mean it happened that's future but but I say unto you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed they killed him likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them so he's saying this Malachi 4 this Elijah that's supposed to come there's only one prophecy that's supposed that Elijah is supposed to come and that's Malachi 4 now this Elijah that's supposed to come he is going to come but he's come already what does that mean to you two different people with the spirit of Elijah now this next scripture ties it all together Luke 1 verse 16 brother Jeremy and many of the children of Israel okay he's speaking of of um um John the Baptist right here this is the angel coming to Zacharias you know what let's brother Jeremy I'm sorry let's go to verse 13 just just read it I'm sorry but we'll just we'll take the time um but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and shall call his name John and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb this is the Angel Gabriel talking to the priest named Zachariah and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God literally in this case the man flesh God and he shall go before him speaking of the coming Messiah and he shall go before him in the spirit and in the power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children many so-called message churches they say well Malachi Malachi 3 is John the Baptist Malachi 4 is brother brandom right here the angel Gabriel is saying Malachi 4 is John the Baptist but watch this I'll read it again verse 17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and he doesn't say hearts of the children to the fathers whoa he says in the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord Malachi 4 verse1 the whole of the day cometh Thou shalt burn as an oven and all the proud yeah and all that do wickedly shall be burned up that didn't happen yet at least I don't think it happened because there's still life on Earth so we see that Malachi 4 part of it was fulfilled to turn the heart of the fathers to the children John the Baptist and then the second part Jesus leaves out to be fulfilled at a later time the heart of the children to the fathers remember Eli elas shall truly come but he's come already Matthew now we go to Luke and it says here yeah he's come already and he did this but he's still got more to do so that is this Spirit of Elijah that's supposed to come and then we go over to Revelation I believe it's uh chapter 11 and we see him jump up again with Moses we see him at Mount Transfiguration and Elijah again with Moses so this man this Spirit of Elijah God uses and this is what we believe was fulfilled in this man named William random now let's go back remember I told you to remember a scripture the one that says that John was the greatest man born of a woman why would he say that he says more than a prophet John the Baptist guess how many miracles John the Baptist did donut how many miracles does Moses do everywhere he went was a miracle Elijah I believe there was four great Miracles that Elijah did Elijah prayed and it didn't rain for three and a half years you talk about A great miracle right but this man John the Baptist didn't do any Miracles but why was he how could he be the greatest Prophet what's your thought think about it think right now brother Jonathan why this man John the Baptist was the greatest of them all I'm going to give you what I think it was John the Baptist had the greatest honor that had ever been given to a man and that was to introduce God himself that was to introduce Jehovah in a man born in a manger through a virgin birth raised up come into the water and here's John the savior of mankind Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world can you imagine of course he was the greatest he was the greatest because he got to introduce God himself he got to introduced the Messiah the whole Old Testament from Genesis all the way through Malachi was about this man and here's [Music] John behold man Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world and let me tell you another thing that he did this is this is even better Sean listen to this you know like this so John we talk about Christians Christians want to make more Christians I said this morning you don't see any evangelism in the Old Testament you don't see people getting converted you know like I said there's a couple that got that married into it I guess there was Ruth and and and um Rahab probably a couple more but the whole thing about Christianity Jesus said go tell the world about me go tell them Make Disciples of all the nations tell them all I'm here I came I conquered death hell and the grave he was crucified on the cross the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed us from our sins didn't just cover it but made us white as snow to where if we come now to Christ we can come as a pure being Jesus or God the Father looks down and and sees his son and doesn't brother Joe doesn't see your sins doesn't see my sins doesn't see all my mistakes he looks down and he sees that one that went into the water with John the Baptist and was baptized that's what he sees and you wonder why it's so important that I constantly preach about Jesus Christ what was brother brandom's message if we believe that he was Malachi 4 it wasn't to introduce himself it was to say I'm here I am a sign to you that Jesus Christ is on his way how beautiful but it's about Jesus and as I said we've taken and we've made it about him so when John the Baptist when John the Baptist introduced oh I didn't I didn't tell you Sean what he did when John the Baptist was in the water he said Behold the Lamb of God he looked over across the river and there was Jesus he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world there was two people that were with him oh there's probably a lot of people there's two predestinated Childs of god named John and Andrew and when John the Baptist looked out there he said that's him what did John what did John and Andrew do I'm doing it I'm doing what the prophet said I'm following him if he's the Messiah he's the Lamb of God I want to be with him the same thing yes the same thing that brother brandom did he said Behold the Lamb of God he said follow Jesus he said he is alive today he said he raises the dead casts out Devils heals the sick he still does all these things now follow him John the Baptist had the first converts to Jesus Christ what an honor what a great honor he converted the first Christian people which is John and Andrew wow and we all come from them from their witness and John the Baptist got it started man the greatest work that's ever happened John got it going why was he the greatest one I mean nobody even compares to him it's like Moses was yeah Moses I mean he brought him out of the he brought them out of Egypt but they all died in the wilderness Moses was awesome don't get me wrong but compared to John these people that came out of sin through John are alive today and have received eternal life and they will live for all of eternity well I preached the whole time I do want to say a couple more things and before you all come I still want you all to hear it too musicians there is a scripture that troubled me I remember I remember reading it years and years ago and it was along the same lines of je of of John the Baptist there and he says Behold the Lamb of God John and Andrew went and they followed him and then they started this incredible work and and they tell Andrew tells his brother Peter and and and Peter comes and John probably tells his brother James and James comes and then pretty much pretty soon there's 12 disciples and then there's a bunch of sisters there and it grows and grows and grows and grows and we see him like I talked about this morning the day of Pentecost then there's thousands and it just exponentially goes around the world but there's one scripture that's very strange let's go to uh John chapter 3 is it verse 22 if you have a skull field Bible it's it the last testimony of John the Baptist very now listen closely as I read and put yourself in 2,000 years ago in this group of people and after these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea and there he carried with them and baptized and John also was baptizing in Enon near Saleem near to Saleem because there was much water there and they came and were baptized something sound strange verse 23 and John also was baptizing verse 22 after these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea and there he carried with them and baptized and John also was baptizing what you get where I'm going if not I'll keep going for John was not yet cast into prison and there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying and they came unto John and they said unto him Rabbi he that was with thee beyond the Jordan to whom thou bearest Witness [Music] what John we love you John you're a prophet John praise the Lord for John you're Malachi 4 John you're Malachi 3 John you're Isaiah 40 John we want to be with you and the one that you told us about the reason he was there brother Jonathan Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond Jordan to whom thou bearest witness he's talking about Jesus Christ behold the same baptized baptizeth and all the men came to him John we love you John you've got the message of the hour and the one that you told us about he's baptizing and they're baptizing more than we are we need to take him out what John answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from Heaven you yourselves bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ but he that I am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom John's like listen I'm not the bride Grom guys he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this is my joy this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but I must decrease my question if John bore witness of Jesus Christ then why did he still have disciples why did they not do what the prophet said wow why didn't they go to Jesus but you know what happened they stayed with John they didn't do what he said and they continued on and to this day there is a remnant of these people that still follow the ministry of John the Baptist except for the part about Jesus Christ how many message Believers have the same testimony brother brandom said that he said many times he said I'm a Baptist and the Baptist the Baptists were a denomination but brother Brandon was he was he was proud of his roots he wasn't he wasn't trying to say that I'm I'm I'm against this but he said I'm he said I'm a Baptist but he's been filled with the Holy Spirit and changed and brother brandom brought more brought the message and of course condemned the denominations but I see all the messages all the denominations around all the sect and the um the divisions that are in the message and I say listen I'm tapes only I still am if you want to hear Brother brandom's message listen to him he said it a lot better than I can say it he's awesome but if you listen to someone tell you what he said they are going to put their own ideas in there and it's going to [Music] change just as it changed with the prophets with Paul with Peter and the Catholic Church stepped in they would have done better just to stay with the teaching rather than out all of this weird stuff it's a truth I love brother Brown's message but let me tell you something I can't preach it brother brand told my grandpa that I mean not brother Brandon brother Neville some of the people asked brother Neville they said how come you don't preach brother brandom's message you know brother Neville said he said I can't that message was for a prophet to preach he said I I got to preach what's on my heart brothers and sisters I'm a little guy I'm the pastor of this church and I love you all my message is for you live right stay with the word listen to The Prophet read your Bible don't sin don't fail love the Lord that's my job that's what I want to do but I see back to my original point I see as soon as God took the messenger off the scene Inc comes in all the heresies and all the weirdness and all the strangeness and all the divisions and and all of that and they they're all because some everybody wants to be the prophet everybody wants to be brother brandom there was only one brother brandom that spirit is going to come back but it's going to come to Israel yes and Moses I have a feeling brother Li we need to be out of here before that happens I want to go up and be with Jesus I recognize God sent this gift I recognize it I love it I love to listen to it and it's not his fault that all the weirdness IS F followed it ain't it's not God bless you brothers and sisters I'm sorry for taking so much time [Music] please brother I love it but please for me take some time tonight the time that you would have spent here praying take some time more than you usually do and spend it with the Lord because let me tell you something you can be in church and and listen to a minister and you can be blessed you can sing songs of worship and you can be blessed you can read your Bible and you can be blessed but nothing will bless you as much as praying and talking to God himself that's the greatest blessing that you could ever get brother Josiah and the the musicians come forward yes sir yes sir brother Aon asked for the I don't want this probably this video to go public but Aon brother eron asked um do do I think that's why brother Jeremy um that's brother Aon asked is is that why there's probably 50 or 60 message churches in Arizona and they don't get along you know you know sad brother Aaron along that same that same message first of all we're starting to get along and those walls are starting to come down and it's it's a beautiful thing but isn't it sad brother Aaron that we call ourselves as I said this morning we're the elite we're the bride we're the greatest and yet we can't even get along with ourselves oh well they're not bride I'm the bride the guy that you know that's the seven you know he do he doesn't have his Doctrine right please the Bible says that there will be one Shepherd and onefold there'll be one Shepherd and one herd that Shepherd's name is Jesus Christ and I am in that herd I am in that fold and I pray that all of you all to are too and let me tell you my testimony is when I was a little kid before I was born my mom played the tapes when I was in the womb the first memory I have was looking over a console Real theore Player and watching the the tapes go around and you know what it did me good I grew up when I would fall into sin then of the Manny I would hear those tapes and I would be corrected they were a blessing to me and for all these people that want to attack him and and want to take him out of context and and want to say that he made mistakes and want to say that that he exaggerated certain things or he was wrong about certain things my answer is I don't care I don't I I don't care I'm the man I am today because of those tapes I'm the man I am today because I had something I could go home to I had something I could play in my room I had something that as I drove when I was in my early 20s and I had a job and I was driving all over Arizona I could listen to those tapes and I was blessed by it that's my testimony God did he make mistakes was he wrong I don't care I know Jesus Christ today because of that that is my testimony and I'll stand strong and if brother Brandon was here today I'd love to give him a hug and say thank you so much thank you for what you did thank you for laying your hand on my grandpa when he was bitten by a rattlesnake sitting on the bank thank you for laying your your hand on him and the Lord healed him immediately thank you for Discerning my other Grandpa's stomach condition as he came through the prayer line and saying that you have colius the very thing that he drove down to act in campground to be healed of thank you brother brandom for yielding to the holy spirit because my grandpa wheeler was healed because of that thank you brother Brandon for yielding to the Holy Ghost because my grandfather Evans had his car stolen somebody took it started heading down south my grandpa and my dad and the whole family got a ride over to Brother brandom's house they got down on the knees their knees in the den and brother Brandon prayed that the Holy Spirit would go and and condemn that person and bring the car back and you know what he did my dad's the one that saw the car I can't thank him enough just like John the Baptist I can put myself Sean I can put myself in the Bible and I would be Andrew or John now you don't have to come through you didn't have to come through John the Baptist ministry there was a Matthew and there was a Nathaniel and there were others that didn't come through the Prophet Elijah's Ministry they're still there but I had the honor of doing it John and Andrew had the honor of
