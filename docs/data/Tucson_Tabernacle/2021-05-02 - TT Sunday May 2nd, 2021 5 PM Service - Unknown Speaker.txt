would bless him tonight lord and bless this service we ask in jesus name amen praise the lord if you have your bibles let's go back to luke chapter 17. i want to just launch from this area i don't know where we'll land but we got to launch from somewhere luke chapter 17. amen we read this verse this morning but i just want to come back to luke 17 verse 20. and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you the kingdom of god is within you and i just want to kind of talk a little bit more about that tonight you can have your seats keep your bibles close to you we're going to need our bibles amen if there ever was a time that we needed our bibles we need it now amen we sing a little song in times like these you need a savior it's a real old hymn sister yarborough my father in them used to sing it and it says end times like these we need an anchor everybody needs an anchor if you ever been on a boat and the winds start uh blowing and if you know anything about boating when the winds come they roll like this and if you get your boat sideways in the roll your boat will roll over but if you throw an anchor out that's why it's impossible for a boat with an anchor to ever sink because when you throw your anchor out it goes and the winds blow the boat and so rather than the waves going this way you throw an anchor out and then the boat always turns towards anchor and then it pierces the waves and breaks the waves it's amazing if you have an anchor when times of trouble you will always face your anchor amen in times of trouble in times of trouble you will always face face your anchor it's it's a kind of an interesting thing i told somebody they said well i don't believe in preachers and doctrines and you know the saying goes like that i said you know how to figure out who your pastor is i said when your child gets hit by a car the person that you call is your pastor your spiritual anchor that you're looking to all of us need an anchor in jesus christ when troubling time come amen we need to look to the word of god amen that's what david said david had an anchor it was jesus christ he said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i i've been overwhelmed many times in my life amen david said i cried unto the lord and he heard me and delivered me out of all of my fears i'm so thankful as a christian we have a place to go brother lyle amen it's not a we don't serve a dead god a god of wood and stone we serve a god that's living amen he lived in the bible and they wrote a story about him but that god of the bible still lives today can you say amen to that it should be something you've experienced in your life that god's changed your life and amen we had some this morning that made a decision for christ and and decided that they wanted to follow christ and give their heart solely to christ and that's a great place to start and a place to repentance but that's just a place to start amen that's when you get up and you start growing in grace and the knowledge of jesus christ you know we were talking this morning about the kingdom of god and i wanted to talk also about the kingdom of the devil but we never got to that because the kingdom of god is so big it's so wonderful amen in this kingdom there's healing there's deliverance there's power there's life there's hope there's no depression there's no anxiety it's just joy unpeaceable unspeakable and it's full of glory in the kingdom of god amen the spirit of god is a kingdom jesus they were looking for a physical kingdom but jesus was talking about a spiritual kingdom that would be inside of them i was thinking about the angels when they came all of us loved christmas story and the angels come and they sing and the angel came to mary and said his kingdom shall be great i believe it says in the book of daniel of his kingdom there shall be no end brother aaron there will be no end to this kingdom we live in a world now and the kingdoms of this world and the presidents and the nations are all great but there's coming a day daniel saw the prophecy that there would be a stone cut out of the mountains it would roll down it would destroy all the kingdoms of the world and we have a promise that jesus is coming to set up his kingdom amen a natural kingdom and of that kingdom there will be no end and then it all starts with the spiritual kingdom we read this morning how they came to take jesus by force and uh pilate came to him and said look uh look uh why aren't you why don't you answer me jesus said if my kingdom were of this world my servants they would fight they would all get swords remember peter got that people i think john my brother went through that at easter time he said he was going through remember it's friday sunday is coming remember that message some of you all remember that and then he preached saturday it's saturday but sunday is coming i think he left here and preached another message it's pentecost how did he say it no it's resurrection but pentecost is coming amen the pentecost is coming and so we know the disciples there when they were there and peter pulls out his sword when they come to get jesus he pulls his sword out and he goes to cut the man's head off he wasn't aiming for his ear jonah but the guy must have moved and had just cut his ear off but jesus reached and picked up the his the man's ear and he told peter what he said put away your sword put your sword away i'm not trying to build a natural kingdom i'm building a spiritual kingdom and this kingdom is inside of you as i began to think about this subject a little bit more i i was thinking about god the bible says in saint john chapter 4 verse 24 that god is a spirit the bible says in a no pla another place no man has seen god at any time god is a spirit but this god wanted to become flesh he wanted to be something that people could touch and he could be handled he was the great creator we could go back in genesis in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth we don't believe there was a big bang and all of this happened how the one man said if you believe in evolution he said it takes greater faith to believe in evolution than it does the bible said if you can believe in evolution then you can believe a man can walk past the print shop light a stick of dynamite throw it inside the print shop and there's a big bang and out comes webster's dictionary with all the definitions and the problem the the adverbs and the adjectives and the nouns and the pronouns all of it and the definitions it takes more faith to believe that and that would happen than it does to believe in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and so we believe that as christians we believe god created the heavens and the earth then we come to the new testament saint john chapter one i gave some of these verses to the brothers i'm learning how to work together with some of this technology thing so you bear with me if i make mistakes but i was thinking there in saint john chapter one verse one the bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god now this bible wasn't written in the beginning somebody wrote the book of genesis does anybody know who wrote the book of genesis moses right in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and moses wasn't standing there but the word of the lord comes to the prophet and moses begins to write down by vision what happened in the very beginning the word of the lord comes to the prophet now we come to the new testament and the bible says in the book of john in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was goss the word the word there is logos it's the concepts of god it was god himself but god wanted to be with the people so he was god above the people in the old testament little theology here so father son and holy spirit in the old testament he was the father above the people and the new testament he was the son that god took on flesh and he was the son then he said i must i i come from god i go back to god and he went back up to god you remember um was it saint paul when he was going to the road to damascus and a light strikes him down and he struck down and he looks up and he said who are you lord and what'd the voice say i am jesus there was jesus in that law ghost that pillar of fire that was with moses back there now it's jesus had to send it back up to that lagos so we see here in verse 14 first john chapter 1 saint john 1 verse 14 and the bible says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten father full of grace and truth i was reading this verse and it really struck out to me because it said it was the only begotten of the father there was only one virgin-born person that was jesus christ what was it john 3 16 we were reading that this morning or quoting it for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so there again in that verse it says he was the only begotten son he was only the the only virgin born son is that what your bible says this don't let this be too deep this is just the scripture we're reading here now adam was the only created son god created adam out of the dust of the earth but i thought about this verse it struck it struck me this afternoon as i was studying it and so the bible says he became flesh and he was full of grace and truth full of grace and full of truth i think we read that this morning pilate said what is truth in another place the bible says that the word of god is the truth he said my word is the truth god's word is the truth but i like the other part here it says he's full of grace full of grace oh jesus christ is full of grace tonight what is grace it's the unmerited favor of god the unmerited favor of god you know sometimes in the bible like john the disciple he was called the disciple of love so saint john and then first john and his whole book is about love and so he we call him john the beloved he was the but there's others people friends that i know that they're like the personification of grace so god has this attribute that he wants to be graceful he wants to show unmerited favor to somebody so sometimes god will just reach out into the world maybe somebody's not even a christian does it doesn't come from a christian family and god will just pick them up and pick them up and say you're one of mine and god that's what the bible says here he became flesh and he was full of grace full of unmerited favor with god i was thinking about saint paul and it's i got a whole sermon i'd like to preach on that but if you go through paul he wrote most of the new testament moses wrote the old man what is it genesis x leviticus and numbers in deuteronomy moses wrote those most of the old testament the others are the prophets most of the new testament was written by saint paul if you go back and look at this at the gospels of saint paul most of his writings be begin with grace be unto you grace be unto you you go through it we ephesians go through corinthians go through galatians grace be unto you grace be unto you and he closes almost every one of his letters out with the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you i'm so glad to be associated with the bible that's full of grace and truth that the messenger to the first church age messenger he said grace be unto you oh i wish we'd get a revelation like saint paul had when we meet somebody we say grace be unto you david amen when we leave one and say god's grace be with you god's grace be god's unmerited favor go with you i was reading there in colossians chapter 4 verse 6 i don't know if i put that one in there brothers i can't remember if i did or not but colossians verse 4 chapter 4 verse 6. you know this is the god is somewhat of a chef you know when he multiplied the bread he didn't multiply just raw bread and make some flour and said you all work on this no he he created it remember he multiplied five loaves of two fishes he made cooked bread and he multiplied it and then he fed another one he fed 4 000 so he is somewhat of a chef people got their cooking shows i originally just get back in their bible and read their bible but i was thinking about this how this verse stood out to me a little bit paul was talking about he said let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt the other day my wife and i were eating and she just reached over and got the salt and just shook it on everything i'm like how do you know that even needs salt it needs salt need salt but paul is saying here when you talk let it always be with grace how do they say they talk about this high fructose corn syrup or whatever it is and they're talking about it's a ingredient you go into the grocery store and it's in ketchup and i don't know all that stuff but high fructose cone stuff most of the drinks have and you know they put that stuff in there and but i was thinking about this paul is saying let your speech be always with grace sometimes we have our speech with legalism and we like this god said and god said and god said and that's true but there also is a place of grace and paul says let your speech be with grace seasoned with salt put a little salt in there as i said that's the way to make people's taste buds come up you just make it salty and you put the chips and salt and you put salsa and you put salt on it makes people thirsty as i said we said it the other day you can lead a horse to water but you can't make that horse drink you're just like ain't drinking but you can put enough salt in its oats and when it's eaten out he's like yeah i'm thirsty i'm thirsty and that's what we as christians ought to be so full of the lord and full of the love of god and the inspiration of god i mean people get around us say i don't know what you're all about but i want what you have i mean that would do us all good as christians to lay aside anything we all you know how they say troubles all of us have troubles but we sang the song this morning i cast all my cares upon the lord jesus jesus said that he said come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and i'll give you rest amen you know the world is a very complex world there's a lot of uncertainty and everything that people thought were certain amen we had a pandemic come by and now a lot of that is uncertain people's jobs and their 401ks and and even how you go to church or how you go to the store or you know it's all uncertainty and so it creates a lot of anxiety a lot of mental problems brother jordan was talking about some people that he knew going through mental things but jesus said come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and i'll give you rest and i don't know about you but i'm weary of this whole pandemic thing i'm just done with it and i just bring it to jesus say lord you know all about this father lord you know all about it we're just trying to do the best that we can you know when it comes down to it you know all of us were born one day and every one of us are going to die one day brother daniel don't talk about that in church well i'm sorry we come to the church to find out the word of god and the truth and the bible says it is appointed unto man once to die so we all start here at zero over here and then we start through life and we're all coming through life and every one of us if you're breathing you're somewhere in this course of life and the bible says three score and ten god allotted which is 70 years and by reason of strength if you have really good genes you make it to 80 and after that they're just bonus years they're just like god is just giving you these bonus years all the way out there but i don't think anybody's lived to be 200 years old so there again the scripture is true it's appointed unto man once to die so that's an appointment that every one of us had and we come to this earth to make a decision for jesus christ that's why you were born into the world that you might have an opportunity to be a christian how was it was it we read there in saint john john 3 16 he said for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved remember the disciples one day they were they went out and they come back to jesus said jesus there were some people over there that were casting out devils in your name but they didn't follow us they didn't come to our church and we should we call fire down out of heaven and jesus said oh my goodness he said the son of man came not to destroy life but to give life and so that's what jesus said here in john 3 16 we all know 16 but 17 says he he sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved i believe it says in another place it's not god's will that any should perish amen the the hell was not created for god's children the bible says that the hell was created for the devil and his angels they weren't created for god's children god doesn't want anybody to go to hell and he's made a propitiation through the cross of jesus christ that we could not go to a devil's hell and that's why verse 18 saint john 3 18 says he that believeth on him is not condemned that he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and he said this is the condemnation now we'll read these verses and one day these verses will come back to us i trust when god brings you life that we all accept life if you don't accept life then one day it comes back to you and so this is the next verse so this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest this deed should be reproved i think we talked about that a couple weeks ago remember in psalms the first chapter the ungodly and the center will not stand in the congregation of the righteous this is the this is what it says right here everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved lest they would be made manifest but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his the deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god so i was thinking about that how that our our conversation should always be with grace seasoned with salt amen may god help us to always have that attribute about us and maybe we've not done the right thing in the past i've made mistakes is there any perfect people here any perfect people okay good it's good we're all in the same boat there's no perfect people as we said the last perfect man we hung him on a cross and that was jesus christ so the bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of god we've all made mistakes i believe it says in isaiah that all we like sheep have gone astray we've turned everyone our own way and then the bible says and the lord hath laid on him jesus christ the iniquity of us all so i'm so glad one day that i found the lord jesus i was just a sinner boy doing the wrong thing raised in a christian home i was sitting about where brother dan was we were at a camp meeting and i said lord it was the lord was just dealing with me you know because god deals with a person he never calls a person the judgment without first warning that person look there's there the end is coming you need to check your life the end is coming and it might be tonight we never know when we're going to have our last service we don't know when we'll ever have our last opportunity so that's why christians are the most secure people that know they don't gamble they don't take chances they want to be secure they realize they have something that's more precious than gold which is their soul so they don't gamble with it we come we realize i'm born into this world to make a decision for jesus christ and i was thinking about this because god the spirit of god wanted to manifest himself so he created a body that he might live in it he might die and go to you know die for your sins and my sins and then he ascended up on high but he had attributes inside of him and that was you and me just like i one time was a young man and we got married at 19 years old and we were 20 we had our little boy isaac and there was attributes i had an attribute to be a father and those were expressed and god had an attribute to be a father as well he wanted to be a father of daughters of god and sons of god i was thinking about this in saint john the first chapter verse number 11 the bible says he which is this one jesus christ came into his own and his own received him not saint john 1 11 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god so the bible says as many as received him to them gave he power to be a son of god he said brother 10 i could never be a son of god i could never be like brother jordan standing here with sister martha and the two little children singing there and i don't know where if kenneth was up there hiding behind the piano but see their family say i could never but the bible says as many as received him to them gave he power to be a son of god to be a daughter of god so you say brother daniel i can't do it you're right we can't do it but the bible says if we receive him jesus christ he'll give you power to be a son of god is that what your bible says i'm so glad that our faith does not rest in what brother daniel says it rests in the word of god and brother daniel is just here as a signpost pointing you to the word of god to say go back and read the scripture it doesn't matter what the devil brings against your mind the bible says as many as received him to them gave he power to be sons and daughters of god it's just like the burden the new birth it's a it's a mystery of god and maybe this morning we're preaching it's like oh my brother daniel i don't you know i know that god's changed my nature but let me just you say i know brother daniel i'm not a pig i once had a pig nature i'd go live in a pig and you can clean a pig up and take him to church and give him to sunday school make him learn verses but that doesn't change his nature he's still a pig you turn him loose and he goes right back to the lust of the flesh and the pride and and envy and strife and pornography and he just sees a pig he just needs to be born again amen so we come in and we're washed by the water the word and god begins to clean us and we're born not only of the water but also of the spirit of god convicts us and you say brother daniel i know god has done something supernatural in my life but that doesn't mean when you walk through the walmart or the barnyard that you don't get mud on you how do you know what i'm talking about and they said no you you're i didn't make you mean you're a pig again it just means you need to go to church and get the washing of the water the word and clean all that off of us and spray that little lamb down and get all that manure off of him and because we go through those things they attack our mind you know how's the one man said you can't control your thoughts like oh no i can control my thoughts all right don't think of a pink hippopotamus ah you already did so i have the ability to put thoughts into your mind i have the the your ears and your eyes are a gateway to the soul and so they come in but you have the ability to let it go from your head down to your heart so i could say oh there's no christians and then you would say i hear that and you put a thought in my mind but i don't believe it because i am a christian so i can and that's what the world is they put all these thoughts oh there's no true christians god doesn't love me but the bible says don't let that go from your head down to your heart say no i'm going to reject that it's called a thinking man's filter and you have the word of god you say okay i got a filter on here do you we just stop right here you know why you have filters like air filters because it's protecting something precious some of us may work in hvac or something like that and you have a a fan motor and you have coils and you say look we can't let all that contamination into this precious thing so we put a filter in there and god has a filter for every one of our souls and it's the word of god and if we would just put that i could put that somewhere so it doesn't get from our head down to our heart we have a filter a thinking man's filter it's the word of god and whenever something comes in you say oh you can't be forgiven or that now if you let that drop down in your heart and you start believing it the bible says as the man thinketh in his heart so is he so pretty soon the devil says look you can't be saved you did wrong and you can't be saved and that comes to your head now if you start believing that as a man thinks in his heart so is he's like you're right i can't be saved there's no way i can be saved and you are what you think as a man thinks in his heart that's what he is and pretty soon you think there's no hope how many friends have i seen that maybe even made a start for christ and then they maybe make a mistake and the devil says see if you're a christian if you're a child of god you'd have never done that and then they start believing that there's no hope and so when it drops down in the heart then they become that as a man thinks in his heart so is he not his mind but as the bible says as he thinks in his heart because any buddy i can tell you hey you're a millionaire and you're like i don't believe that you know but if you believe it let it drop in your heart you could become that and as you think in your heart so so are you and so i say that because so many people they believe there's no hope i can't there's i can't i'll never be saved i've gone too far i've done too many bad things you don't have to raise your hand but i bet the devil's come to you and told you that he has me said look you've gone too far there's no hope for you but the bible says the thinking men's filter said no man can come except the father draws him you can't come to god unless god draws you and if god is drawing you tonight to him that means there's still hope for you god's not an indian giver he doesn't play like hey you need your drowning hey here's a life raft and then he pulls it like ah you drown ha ha god doesn't do that we just read it's not his desire that any should perish so how's the bible says the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost so when the devil says look you've gone too far then you need to take the thinking man's filter the bible says if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins that's what the thinking men's filter and you don't let it go from your head down to your heart you push that thing out and you take the filter and you clean the filter say stop all the contaminants from going down and into my soul there's a scripture that says what would a man give in exchange for his soul it's very precious you have something that's very precious every one of you i guess you drove her in a car whether it's a great car or not a great car especially in arizona you have a air filter and maybe you go get your oil change like hey do you want to change your filter and sometimes they rip people off they tried to do that to me the other day i'm like no i can it doesn't need that i know what a bad filter looks like and so you have something precious and that's your soul and you shouldn't let contaminants come into that you shouldn't let just thoughts come into that you should protect that and that's what the word of god is you come to the house of god and god has a filter that filters all the bads keeps the bad stuff out and lets only the good things in god loves me god cares about me he has a plan for my life he's watched out for me every day of my life it's not his will that i perish we just read it john 3 16 17 and 18. oh isn't that good doesn't that just kind of lift you up when the devil tries to push you down amen and the bible says as many as received him to them gave he power to be sons of god we read it this morning and i won't read it again but jesus said i have you've not chosen me but i've chose you and ordained you that you go and bring forth fruit it should bring you so much happiness when the world maybe hates christians jesus said if the world hates me it'll hate you also but jesus said i chose you hattie god chose you and ordained you that you would go and bring forth fruit brother rome god chose you that we would go and we would bring forth fruit as christians matt god chose you that you'd be a christian you'd use his talents to sing and play and use whatever we can remember arnold van winkler and it tells the whole story about they were in switzerland they were being captured and and they were coming against their country and they were being defeated and he looked they were just plows men and he looked at him he said today i give my life for switzerland i said what do you do he said today we go and we give our life for our country he said get your plow get your shovel and follow me and fight with everything that you've got we're living in a day when the devil is coming against our mind we're fighting the greatest battle ever fought it's fought in your mind i say get whatever you've got and let's fight the devil let's stand shoulder to shoulder our enemy is not your enemy is not sitting on the pew with you they're not sitting across the aisle amen these are our brothers and sisters now the devil will come to you and say no that's this ruler she's just my enemy and every time you drive up in church you're thinking about that situation that happened five years ago that's the devil just throw that thing away say that's my sister that's my brother it's the devil would try to divide us god's chosen us that we might bring forth fruit i was thinking about this a great man said brother random said i must not go around daily with my head hanging down as if something was terrible when i look at the world and see all the darkness and all they're carrying on i just raise my head and walk with my head among the eagles knowing this that i know him in the power of resurrection because he lived we live also because he raised up from the dead i shall raise also amen ye shall raise also i believe that jesus said because i live you can live also i'm so glad that i'm alive today as a christian i've had a new birth i've had a change of heart can you say amen to that and you wouldn't you know it's just not you're not called into a new reformation you read a book and i become a better person no god changed my life he changed my desires does that mean i'm perfect no but there's no more desire there's no more conscience of sin we make mistakes say lord forgive me of my sins and we get up and we move on as a christian amen we were talking about that where were you talking about friday night we're talking about the little fellowship we're talking about how many time a child falls down when it's learning to walk that child just said like i think i'm going to walk and it stands up just walk no it gets up and it falls down it gets up and it falls down it gets and sometimes as christians we we aren't perfect anthony when we get baptized we take on the name of jesus christ we don't me we're not going to be perfect people we're going to make mistakes but the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all of our sins can you say amen to that aren't you thankful for a father that doesn't expect you to get up and walk perfectly he knows you're going to make a mistake and 2 000 years ago he died on calvary for your iniquities and for your transgressions i got to make you love your father oh blessed be the name of the lord some of us made mistakes and the devil said look you fell down and there's no hope for you that's not what my father said he said i already paid for your transgressions i already paid for your iniquities oh blessed be the name of jesus makes you love him not out of the law when you got somebody who loves you like that you just it's not a do's and don'ts it's lord i love you we sing the song i love him because he first loved me not when we're sitting in church and we got our ties and our brother david sitting on the front row thank you for coming up closer to the front getting warmer and wrong are we talking about john was it last week we were talking about john he got away he got him in prison you ever been in a prison in your mind all of us get in prison circumstances and were taken captive and they said go ask jesus and if he's the one or we look for another that was his whole commission in life to be the forerunner and he said go ask if i've made a mistake with my whole life oh blessed be the name of jesus sometimes we get in that some same place that's when you come to the church of god and maybe the sisters start playing a little song brother matt comes out and and starts leading a little song you begin to feel that presence of the lord begin to speak to you again i'm here to tell you god has a voice god is a spirit and he speaks to us and you can hear now i have a voice but it's not so important that you hear my phonetic as the scientists hear the sound waves that follow come from my vocal cords to the anvil and the stirrup on your ear that's one kind of sound but there's another sound when the voice of god speaks to your heart and you know that god is warming your heart something is moving down deep inside of you how's the bible say let us lay aside the sin and the weights that so easily beset us and let's run with patience this race that's set before us looking to the author and the finish of our faith all right what time did we start gotta watch that clock back there amen i'll skip over a few notes i was thinking of this mark chapter eight matthew mark luke and john i was talking to anthony the other day and he said i don't know a whole lot about the bible we got him a new little bible but that's okay my little boy didn't know anything about this big world when he came into the world but he's got a father that teaches him amen when you're born of god you have a father it's a tutor jesus said i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you i'm going to be with you all the time i'm going to walk beside you i'm going to hold your hand he's not a physical thing that you see right now we know he's gone up to heaven but he's a spirit god is a spirit so when you get close to something you get close to it the holy spirit will speak to you and say don't do that and you just keep walking and maybe you do it in the holy spirit how does it say in ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption how many's ever grieved the holy spirit be honest like yeah i've grieved him i've done wrong and then daddy takes you in the back room shuts the door doesn't beat you in child abuse we don't believe in that but he takes and gives you a little spanking like hey you don't do that anymore you don't do that like oh okay daddy i won't and then he wraps his great big arms around you in love you see how jesus said as many as i love i chasten and rebuke but it's not abuse where he beats you down that's what the devil does he condemns you how's the one man said he tempts you to rob the bank and then as soon as you rob the bank he calls and calls the police on you that's where the devil does he tempts you like why don't you do that why don't you do that and then you do it look there's no hope for you you're lost you're not a christian if you're a really christian son of god you'd have never done that like man that's just the devil i remember my father i had the privilege of being raised in a christian home and every day i'm a beneficiary of that heritage but my dad come to me one time and he said do you know the difference between condemnation and conviction because the devil is full of condemnation jesus said the son of man came not in the world to condemn the world but that the world through him they might be saved so condemnation is of the devil conviction is of god so brother daniel how do you know the difference between condemnation and conviction condemnation is there's no more hope for you you've fallen down you've made a mistake you'll never get back up that's condemnation that's the devil but conviction is the holy spirit saying hey you did wrong you can't live like that and be my son my children don't live like that you need to make that right you need to repent and then you go back and say look maybe you've done your fellow brother or sister you might say brother sister forgive me and if we confess our sins jesus christ is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness those are verses that need to be underlined in your bible we call them go-to verses you have these go-to verses when the devil comes remember we called it um saint first john 1 9. this is the this is a good one for you anthony you're going to need this one so it's in back in the old back by the book of revelation right close to the end we teach sunday school so we teach this is our go-to verse it's our 9-1-1 call and i've told you all this a couple weeks ago but repetition is the best teacher so christians when they get in trouble if you're in your house and somebody starts beating on the window like we're gonna kill everybody in the house you get your cell phone out and you call 9-1-1 right you hope that somebody there is going to come i got news for you the average time for a police officer to get to your house is 10 minutes so if you're really waiting on the policeman to do that you need to come up with plan b and probably plan b needs to be your plan a and not depend because there's only so many policemen in the city and if a certain number of people come in and say hey we're just gonna rob all of the people in this city there's only so many policemen and they're probably not coming to my house first but that's not the way it is with the lord jesus christ because he's got someone that watches over you and we have first john the the chapter 1 verse 9 and if you do that backwards first john 1 9 backwards is 9-1-1 and so this is the christians 9-1-1 call if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness isn't that a good verse that should be a go-to verse for every christian when the devil comes to your head and says look there is no hope for you then you have god's word as a filter your 9-1-1 call it doesn't let it go in your heart it keeps it out says no i don't believe that because i know if i start believing it in my heart as a man thinketh in his heart so is he but i'm not going to let that become part of me i'm going to throw that let my filter throw that out because the bible says if i confess my sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness now i know this is really really basic but sometimes in our christian walk it's good to go back to the basics i have some friends that were in the military they were military police like brother matt he told me the other day he was military police so they had a lot of things that happened on the barracks but they go back to their training and they would train you as you go in boot camp or whatever it is and i said when the bombs are falling and the people are shooting and your buddies dying and there's blood everywhere and you're in the foxhole and they're shooting your buddy just died in your arms you start going back to the basics and you start going back to your training and there's never been a day that we don't see people dying spiritually around us and people being dismembered they're losing their faith in god and their walk with god and when all that happens and you see it's not the time to just commit suicide commit spiritual suicide it's the time to go back to your basic training and these are the basic training that's what church is about we call it sunday school we'll call it yeah sunday school we're in the house of the lord we're being schooled when the devil comes tomorrow and said look you've sent away your day of grace you're saying no i'm going to go back to the basics my 9-1-1 is if i confess my sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins that's just really basic but i love let's go to chapter two verse one because you can't hardly read the one without the other and besides all that i have a big arrow drawn in my bible to it so sometimes as a christian when you're in this battle and you go through trials and heartaches and pains and the scripture will come and set you free so sometimes you're on this road of life we talked about the path of life from cradle to the grave we're on this path and sometimes you'll fall into little pitfalls along the way and then the word of god is like a chain and your soul hangs over hell by every verse in this bible and wherever you break that chain is where you fall you remember eve she was in the garden man perfect world perfect atmosphere everything was perfect and she just had god had one word don't partake of that tree and when she broke that then her her soul fell and so that's why you get in places in your life you get in the you know get along you all don't have snow storms here but i guess you have mud tsunamis or tsunamis monsoons and so you've had people get stuck in the mud and you have this chain and you stick it down there if you're before if your big four wheel drive goes off the road it doesn't mean you're not a truck right doesn't mean you're not a human it just means you got off the path and some of us get off the path of life things happen to us maybe maybe we get washed off maybe we said i think i can cross that and maybe we get washed off the road but that's not the end that's why you come to god's house and god will have a man of god there throw a chain out to you throw the word i got out say hey just hook this on your soul and we'll reel you back in we'll get you back on the road and all of us have kind of got off the road somewhere in our life but that's not the end we just need amen the word of god to come to us hook onto our soul and pull us back up and get us back on the road again amen saint mark chapter 34 just a couple more verses and then we'll close saint mark chapter 34. now this message is for somebody amen we don't believe that things just happen by chance we believe that everything is ordained by god everything that happens in your life is just not chance it's all for a reason mark chapter 8 verse 34 and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them who whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me now you all have done that today because you all aren't at walmart you're not out walking in the mountains today looking at the pretty sunset seeing god in nature you've denied yourself and your own desires and you've come to the house of god because the bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together can you see yourself in the scripture we can see jesus in the scripture but can you see you can you see yourself fulfilling scripture you've denied yourself and take up his cross and follow me and whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for the for my sake and the gospel is the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul so if you would gain the whole world and lose your soul jesus said what would it profit you or what can a man give in exchange for a soul that's a great question what would a man give in exchange for his soul elvis presley was raised in a pentecostal church and brother bram said that he learned his moves in the pentecostal church and he sold his soul for a fleet of cadillacs i wish i had time to i wanted to do that this morning to go through the kingdom of the devil and how he tries to merge those two kingdoms together and a lot of people that start out in the kingdom of god and the devil perverts them and gets them over on his side because he he's not original he can only pervert what god did he can't create a beautiful woman he only perverts a beautiful woman that god made he can't make a man into his image he can only take a good man that's made in god image and then pervert that man how many can see that and so you see a lot of these singers that are out here in the world they started in in a christian home elvis presley was raised in a pentecostal church was that lady gaga was a catholic and has gone over to a different side i think britney spears was raised baptist uh all of the jacksons i think they were baptists trying to think uh katy perry both her parents were traveling ministers and she put out an album said i want to be the next amy grant of christian music and and it was a total fail and so she told you look it up on the unearthed the devil she told the devil look if you'll make me successful make me popular i'll sell my soul to you and she sold her soul to the devil and you see how the devil can't create he only takes these great gifts and talents of god and perverts them and puts them over on this side it's the kingdom of the devil and so the jesus asked this question what would you give in exchange for your soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me in my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also so the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with his holy angels may god help us to deny ourselves and take up our cross and follow him because the devil is right there to get you hooked and addicted on every little thing of the world it's just social media that's the craziest things that people get addicted to sometimes and somebody was telling me the other day they just got addicted to some i don't know if it's instagram or twitter they had some little reel and little funny things and they got in that and they got was just so hooked and addicted to that thing i have to realize they was stealing all of the their time and and and not getting things done of life and we see these little addictions of the devil that would steal our and so you know may god help us today the bible says to redeem the time amen just before we close i was thinking this noon i wrote the name esther down i was thinking about the kingdom of god and like the kingdom of hazarus his he wanted a wife and so he went and sent you know the story of esther and sent out a thing for all the beautiful women to come and there was one lady called esther the bible says she went into the king but she took nothing with her she didn't need anything because she was naturally beautiful and you know god is looking for he's building a spiritual kingdom and he's looking for a bride and he doesn't need a lot of stuff attached to you he just wants you he just wants you he doesn't need anything but just you just like esther was there he just needs you he needs your life it doesn't need maybe all the other women if you look at the thing of esther there maybe they said well hey we got to do this like the world and the world says i need this and i need this but esther didn't need that she just need herself to come to the king and that's the way we are we just need to come to the king jesus christ i was thinking of that great call song just as i am without one plea but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bids me come to thee o lamb of god i come just as i am my friend he had a little saying he said i've never caught a fish he's a great fisherman he said i never caught a fish that i didn't have to clean never caught a fish it i didn't have to clean a lot of bad stuff out before ever served it before i ever used it for its intended use and that's how we way we are like esther god just needs us he doesn't need all of our ideas and all of what we think he just wants us to come to jesus christ maybe another verse here before we close first timothy maybe two verses second timothy chapter three this verse was on my heart this afternoon as i was just studying second timothy chapter three verse number let's go back to ten so this is paul telling about talking to timothy about how the world and the evils of the world but in verse 10 he said but thou has fully known my doctrine so that's the way a minister is people should know that know their lives he said you've known my doctrine you know my manner of life you know my purpose you know my faith you know my long suffering you know my charity you know my patience the bible says you should know them that labor among you should know their life no and so paul goes on to say he said persecutions and afflictions which came unto me at antioch and iconium and lystria and so paul is saying look you know me you know i went to this city and there was i believe one place they stoned him another place they they they let him over the side of the wall and another place my wife and i are going through the book of acts and how he suffered great persecutions and afflictions and he said what persecutions i endure but out of them all the lord delivers me yea and all can you say all all that will live godly in christ jesus are going to suffer persecution so if you think you're going to give your heart to god you're just going to coast through life you got in the wrong wrong club this isn't the club for you but you're going to suffer persecution and he said but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse this is a prophecy the world's not going to get better the bible's prophesied they're going to get worse and worse the internet's not going to get cleaned up and all be a pure holy uh internet virtual highway because that's what the internet is it's just a road and there's a lot of junk along the road and there's some good things along the road we're streaming the service out to different people may god bless our our our audience that's streaming but the bible says that men are going to gra wax worse and worse deceiving him being deceived but continue thou he's talking to timothy but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom now has learned them and that from a child so even when you're young timothy even from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures makes me think of brother yarborough again even as a child you've known the holy scriptures and what are these scriptures going to do which are able to make thee wise unto salvation salvation comes from the scriptures as we were talking before you know somebody could say hey if you beat your head on this organ you can be saved i can't hardly believe that no because your faith doesn't rest in the shifting sands of man's theology at rest in the word of god and that's what paul is telling timothy right here you'll know the scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus so today we're going to baptize anthony in the name of the lord jesus christ there's many churches that baptize in the titles of father son and holy spirit but if you go back and study in the book of acts there's no place in the bible that anyone was ever baptized in the titles of father son and holy spirit so that's why the bible paul is telling timothy even as a young child you've known the scriptures which are able to save thee so we're saved by our knowledge and adherence to the word of god verse 16 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works that's why you hear brother daniel talk so much about the scriptures because they're able to save us matthew chapter six this is maybe the last one before we turn to our baptismal service matthew chapter 6. very simple you know somebody said the other day say i don't even know how to pray and i was thinking about that because i think it's luke 11 the disciples came to jesus and they said teach us to pray they didn't know how to pray and i was thinking about the little boy that went to church he was just a young boy and he went to church and he'd come up to the altar and he just said a b c d e f g and they asked the boy said boy you've been coming to church why do you go to the altar and you say your abcs he said well i never had a dad and mom to teach me the ways of god so i don't know how to pray but i just say my abcs and jesus will take all the letters and he'll put them together and make the right words and he knows my heart sometimes it's good for us just to go back and say our abc's to god and just say lord this is how i feel because prayer is not telling god something it's talking to god just like we would talk this and we would talk and say hey how you feeling today well i don't feel very good i feel alone or i feel lonely that's the same way you pray i pray a lot just driving down the road in my car or get up early and kneel and say lord i don't know what to do about this i was praying this morning i woke up really early and i was just got down and pray and said lord i don't know how to do i just kept praying and praying and directly the holy spirit said well this is how you do it like this and i just was there and i just wrote it down and that's what that's what i need to do to fix that sometimes we don't wait enough in prayer we need to spend time in prayer sometimes we make decisions we do things quick and we got cell phones so many times people text us and we real quick and they'll text right back and that's not the time to just how my dad's told me this too he said just because it can be done doesn't mean it should be done just because you can text that back doesn't mean you should text that back sometimes it's good to just wait a little bit and pray spend a little time in prayer and so they came here in matthew chapter six the gospel of luke tells the story and they had come to him and said teach us to pray and he goes through a different version but we call this the lord's prayer in matthew chapter 6 verse 9 after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven you know the very first word in the lord's prayer is our it takes the me out of this it's just me no it's our father it's we're us together there's somebody with you in this we're not fighting this battle alone it's our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name what is the name of our father jesus christ amen let everything house the bible say whatsoever you do in word everything you do indeed do it all in the name of jesus and if you can't do it in the name of jesus you probably shouldn't be doing it so i have the right to go down to the alcohol store and go in there and buy me a a big old bottle of bourbon because bourbon country's back in kentucky if you go through and fly into louisville the whole thing is bourbon man bourbon this and bourbon that how their governor said 95 of the bourbon original is made in in in kentucky and all the rest is imported five percent and that's their big thing is bourbon and alcohol and i have the right to go do that but i can't do it in the name of jesus christ the bible says shun the very appearance of evil so if i walk in and i've got a big brown paper bag and it's all wrapped up in there and i say just a coke just a coke like but you're shunning daniel shutting the very appearance of evil hallowed be the name of jesus christ we're going to baptize our brother in the name of jesus christ the bible says the whole family in heaven is named jesus amen you're baptized in and it's amazing and you go to other churches and they'll do everything in the name i'll do this in jesus jesus name but they refuse to be baptized in the name of jesus christ isn't that amazing he goes on to say thy kingdom come thy will be done is that your desire lord let your kingdom come lord let the spiritual we know there's two kingdoms one is a spiritual kingdom that's inside of you we know in revelation chapter 21 john saw i saw a great city the new jerusalem coming down there's going to be a physical kingdom but right now there's a spiritual kingdom and jesus said this is how you should pray lord let your kingdom come let it come inside of me let christ be the ruler of my life and this this next part of verse 10 is so amazing if you if you this this will help you so much in your life jesus said this is the way you pray thy will be done in earth as it's done in heaven sometimes we want to say lord i want this to happen i want this to happen i want this to happen rather than wait god taught us to pray let thy will be done on earth as it's done in heaven so the main thing is say lord what is your will in heaven lord what is your will that's where as a lot of times critical or just most of us if we had our way and we'd date like christianity like a one like trouble's gone my sickness is gone this problem's gone and this problem and my neighbor's gone and my kids are gone and but jesus said pray let thy world be as thy will is done in heaven so let it be done on the earth maybe god's got a little thorn in the flesh to make you humble remember paul said i sought the lord thrice and he come and told me he said my grace is sufficient for you that little handicap that you have is there for a reason paul to keep you humble it goes on to say give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen and most people stop the lord's prayer there but the next two verses are so powerful it's hard to just say amen there without reading the next verses for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you oh that's so wonderful if i forgive my brothers then god will forgive me our trespasses and a lot of us say amen right there but that's there's another verse that comes after that one he goes on to say but if he forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive you your trespasses so i got news for you none of us are going to go to heaven with sin in our lives and so if we don't forgive our brother or his trespasses then our father won't forgive us our trespasses so you can't go to heaven if you're not forgiving your brother or sister and sometimes there's bitterness and hatred and sometimes we go through things in our life and we don't forgive people and it just really how do they say bitterness only contaminates the vessel that holds it you might have the most beautiful bowl say this is just lined this is a copper bowl and it's so beautiful but then you put the acids of hatred and bitterness and malice and unforgiveness it doesn't hurt the bitterness it's just in the bowl but it starts corrupting its acids it starts corrupting and etching that nice bowl and each one of us are made in the image of god it says in the book of acts that we come to church and there's times of refreshing god refreshes us he makes us over anew says there be not conformed to this world we be transformed and we're transformed into a new creature and then sometimes these bitter acids come in and try to to taint our personalities and our our spirits and we get bitter i say it's time to just say lord forgive us lord forget and lord let me forgive my brother even if it's for a selfish reason lord i don't want my vessel to be contamin contaminated and my spirit to be contaminated so lord i'm going to forgive my dad i'm going to forgive my mom i'm going to forgive my brother forgive my sister forgive my neighbor so that god you will forgive me blessed be the name of the lord amen if the musicians

and god's drawing you to him the bible says draw nigh unto god and he will draw an i unto you resist the devil and he will flee from you heavenly father you see the hands that have been raised lord their hands have hung down most of the service gravity holds their hands down but when the word of god was gone forth lord something inside of them responding and say i want my sins to be forgiven and

presence i'm changed in his presence i'm changing the presence i'm changed in the presence of the lord i'm changed in his presence i'm changed in his presence i'm changed in the presence of the lord [Music] amen there's something about the presence of the lord that changes every situation amen we're going to change the order of the service and just read some verses here about water baptism we're going to baptize brother anthony in just a moment i'm going to read these out of corinthians i'm sorry romans chapter 6. just a few verses that talk about the what we believe we do don't believe that water saves you we believe that water this that we're doing is an outward sign of something that's happened on the inside so the other night anthony and i were sitting on the bench the other day and we were just talking about jesus christ john 3 16 jesus christ came into the world to die for sinners amen if we would confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins we're going to baptize him in a minute he believes that jesus christ is the son of god that came into the world to take anthony's sins we take our sins and by faith we place them on jesus christ and that saves us we're saved by faith in jesus christ but the bible goes on to say he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved it's not just believing and a lot of people go to the thief on the cross say well i don't have to be baptized because the thief died and and he didn't get baptized but you must remember that there was no commandment to be baptized it wasn't until after jesus rose from the dead he told them to go into all the world baptizing in the name of the father the the name of the father son and holy spirit which is the lord jesus christ so there was no commandment prior to that how many understand that and that'll take away that thought well i don't have to get baptized because after jesus rose he gave them the commandment you've got to be baptized so we find in romans chapter 6 i just want to read some verses here just take a minute again what we do comes from the scripture what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace shall abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death so the same as jesus lived and he died and was buried and then he rose again he received a glorified body we believe that we're all born in sin we're sinners we confess our sins to jesus christ and as an outward sign of what has happened on the inside we're going to take we're going to bury brother anthony in the water and we're going to go down into a water of grave and when he comes up he's going to raise in a newness of life as a new anthony he goes on to say verse 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life verse number five for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection i'd like to preach that right behind wednesday's service about the righteous man is planted by the rivers of water and that's what's happening here we're getting ready to plant him according to the scripture we're going to bury him and plant him under the water that he might rise in newness of life and from this day forward he'll always remember the day that he was baptized how many of you remember the day you were baptized yes i remember the day that i went down i got baptized and was planted according to the scripture and i laid my life down and i raised in a newness of life verse number six knowing this that our old man is crucified with him and that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also be live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead diet to no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god that's hard to stop there and not read the next three verses likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be undead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield yourselves members as instruments of unrighteousness and descent but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness and to god so when we raise the newness of life we say lord here's my life as an instrument we've got a little instrument or sister's plan there or a might have a guitar it's an instrument to be used for righteousness and each one of us we die and we're planted we raise again as an instrument that god we want god to use us as an instrument of righteousness amen so we're at this time let's just have a word of prayer and then we'll take brother anthony up and we'll change our clothes and we'll be baptized heavenly father we just lord pray to you you told us to pray without ceasing and we're just praying lord as we come to this time of the service that this young man anthony is 18 years old has made a decision to follow you lord to follow your word and to be baptized we pray lord as your scripture says go ye into all the world baptizing them in the name of the father son and holy spirit which is the lord jesus christ lord we're praying as we do this as an outward sign of an inward work we pray that you would do a work in anthony's life lord may the holy spirit come to him may it lead him and guide him may it fill his life lord to overflow him make him a witness make him a testimony lord for you and we'll know lord that something has happened because you said by their fruits you're going to know them father may you bless him today in the name of jesus christ amen there's a little song that says i am bound for the promised land do you all sing that i think it's page 200 in that book amen the bible says all of heaven rejoices over one soul that repents amen so you may be seated all of heaven is rejoicing the angels are looking over watching this young man about to take on jesus name and water baptism brother anthony or one of your brothers want to help brother anthony there and we'll just go and change and if brother matt will lead us in some songs and then close the service out afterwards amen brother matthew on jordan stole me banks [Music] where [Music] i am bound for the promised land i am bound for the promised [Music] i am bound for the promised land one eternal day there god [Music] me i am bound for the promised land no

when the saints go marching [Music] when the saints go [Music] [Music] when the saints go marching jesus he said the christ thing you got to do is repent of your sins all of us are born with their own nature so you've got to repent of your sins and then be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission for the washing away of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost yes brother anthony and i anthony and i were on the bench the other night talking about the gospels what the gospel is so many people make so many things with it but it's not taking away wafer going to a priest and saying your sins to the priest there's one mediator between god and man and that's the man christ jesus amen and so each one of us is an individual we go to jesus christ him as the son of god and then place our sins upon him and then be baptized for the remission of our sin then we have a promise that the holy spirit will come and live in our lives so many people do they they get baptized but they never go on to receive the power of god in their life their lives cause them to live in overcoming life man we believe we're going to baptize anthony and the holy spirit will just overshadow it and fill his life and make him a witness testimony people at school he graduates in a couple of weeks there and on his job he's working at wendy's pray the lord and let him be a light there let him be a light in his family to be such a change as his mother and grandparents will see such a change in his life since he accepted jesus christ as his savior amen let's just bow our heads together heavenly father we bow our heads to you lord with great joy in my heart stand with this young man that desires to be a christian lord he realizes he was born into this world as a sinner lord but you loved him so much that you left the portals of heaven came on died on the cross lord that if he would believe on the lord jesus christ he would be saved if you confess with his mouth that you're the son of god he's made that confession tonight lord before this great company of witnesses lord he comes to be baptized in the name of jesus christ that he might be saved and i pray the holy spirit would fill his life lord it would overshadow him lord it would give him power above the powers of the devil i pray lord strengthen him today lord as he would be buried in this water lord may he raise the newness of life to serve you and to love you to be a witness to his family to those around him i pray in the name of jesus christ we pray and ask him amen anthony based on your confession that jesus christ is the son of god and now baptize you in the name of jesus christ amen praise the lord is there anybody else who wants to be baptized the bible says today if you hear his voice don't harden your heart amen it's never too late to be baptized in jesus name and rid your sins of your life if you've never been baptized in jesus name you haven't been your sins have not been remitted according to the scripture amen may god bless you brother matthew if you'll lead in a song therefore there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's [Music] lose all their guilty lose all
