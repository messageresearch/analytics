couple of requests that were written out so we thought we'd handle those at the beginning as well as we join our hearts together you know if one can chase the tiles and two can chase ten thousand those exponents of ten there's about 50 or more of us here there's not enough demons in hell that can withstand the prayers that this group much less the body of Christ around the world can't defeat if we join our hearts if we join our faith if we bring together those Elixir fire Those portions of the Holy Spirit through the proportion to each one of us and just pull together in unity there is nothing that can stand before that pray for my family and my finances Sister Margaret Stevenson and family one from Sister Amelia it's been about a year since I went to see my daughter Lisa and we all prayed for her she was in her last stages of cirrhosis of the liver the Lord had healed her and she was doing well but shortly after she started drinking again and got real sick and lost her liver I'm planning on going to see her soon prayers very serious these are life and death but nothing nothing as though as the brother I shared with that this morning from Romans 8 37-39 there's there's nothing that can separate us from the love of God nothing absolutely nothing so let's join our hearts together as we take these requests and whatever's on your heart as we lay aside the burdens of this life the burdens of the world to focus on the Lord Jesus Lord we are so grateful that we can have this opportunity this night in August of 2021 in this place Lord that we can lift our hearts before you

every good thing and Lord on behalf of these that have written his requests and on behalf of each burden that might be on any heart and every heart that's here tonight Lord we pray that you'd reach down that you'd wrap your arms of Love around each one Lord that you just give us that assurance and that strength Lord to continue on to continue the battle day by day hour by hour Moment by moment

word I don't think he's ever been tested anywhere close to his limits where he has to say well hang on a bit let me go see if I can handle this but he has everything and his control let's just stand here for a moment amen you know him that way in his power and his greatness and his Mercy if you don't know him that way you can know him that way today amen let's just power his Lord we thank you hearing a song like that that just just reminds us how great you are Lord [Music] I've been able to stand and look over the Grand Canyon and and look at some of the greatest some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world and here in the states and all and just be amazed by it Laura but it's all under your control It's all under your power it's what you've done Lord we're such a privileged people to know you that way Lord not a god way far away not just a statue but a living God we appreciate that today we thank you for it thank you for your word today Lord thank you for your blessings today in Jesus Christ's name amen while you're standing we'll just read one scripture and then thank you Mrs appreciate the musicians I do very very much because if not you'd have to listen to me singing without music and all in that I don't know if you'd ever come back Isaiah chapter 26 verses 3 and 4. I'll read those scriptures that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee trustee in the Lord forever for the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength now brother Jonathan asked them to sing this song once again tonight but I didn't tell them what my scriptures were but somebody knew already so you may be seated amen so brother John Hall sent brother Daniel a text and and to let him know that today August 20th eight years ago brother green passed away I believe it was early in the morning and there was a part of us that said no no we wanted brother green back but there was a part of us that said yes he suffered long enough he's done his job so ask brother Jeremy to put a picture up there and I just said choose one of those there brother green the founder of this church God called him and left and God had a reason as to why and all and and today we're here because if somebody obeyed the call of the Lord and I don't know here who here today was way back there when it started but I know that there was some sister Mercy samurano probably listening she was the first one brother green baptized when he came my wife was was a a young girl a very young young girl when they attended the Tabernacle down there but I think we in 1975 came to the December meetings and the first time got to meet brother Greene and it wasn't so much brother green even though yes it was brother green in a sense but it was the god that brother green served and preached and talked about that's made the difference in our lives yeah that's where it is so and as I thought about it I said sister Green's with him now and it's probably changed a little bit for him because she's probably town now Perry you can't do that no you can't be like that she used to sit right there about where maybe sister hope and such a lily or they were sitting there and she'd be going like this to him like nope don't say that but it doesn't help does it my wife's going no it doesn't but appreciate the grace of God and the mercy of the Lord and the goodness that we can still be here serving the same Living God because you trust in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength so appreciate that so much so tonight just just like to bring a few things to your to your memory and just some things that brother green said and I had mentioned it thought to myself I'm going to say I listened to his the testimony that he gave his testimony at brother biscal's he had done about 20 years ago or so maybe a little longer two services and really laid a lot of it out but a couple things that just stick with me and I I don't ever forget them he says what can you do to make God love you more and you say well I could be a better Christian I could do this no God loved you with perfect love while you are yet a sinner God loved you and cared for you he was already making a way for you so if you can't make him love you more what can you do you can love him more and as something that brother green always told us and this is the one that I I remembered and it kind of fits with today as he said Jesus was a crooked lawyer or a an attorney because he would take and get rid of the evidence when Satan would come and accuse and say but he did this and this and God would say where is it the Slate is clean there was nothing he could point out I just remember brother green saying that he was a crooked lawyer because today if you found a lawyer was hiding evidence he'd get in a lot of trouble but this one washed it through his blood and perfect so I just I and it when I wrote this down this was yesterday in my mind I had the days mixed I was thinking August 15th he passed away but it was August 20th 2015. but Jesus Christ is still here the same yesterday today and forever so again here's our strength Everlasting strength brother Branham says in a quote here in uh in 55 in the calling of Abraham he says now here's what God did for us in Christ God manifested in flesh took his own son up to Calvary and there he killed his own son on calvary's Cross to make a covenant with a human race and when he did he nailed him to the cross the dead sacrifice it was and pulled out of him the Holy Spirit into thy hands I commend my spirit blood running from his side and hands and feet and God pulled out the spirit from him and shoved the body down in the grave raised it up on the third day and set it on his right hand and sent the rest of the agreement back to the church which was the same holy ghost that was upon Christ come upon the church and the only way in the world will ever be able to make it at the day of the judgment is for that same holy spirit that was Upon Jesus Christ we'll have to dovetail as his wife through the body amen and he kept his word how many know because he lives in you today he dwells in you amen so looking at that I'm going to go to some scriptures here in Isaiah and a very familiar scriptures Isaiah 53. verses 3 to 7. I'll read the scriptures and then and then we'll just look at some notes Here he was despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not now here's a translation man-made sport of him they were entertained by his death turning away from him he was a Man of Sorrows marked by disease and like one of whom men's faces are turned away he was looked down on and we put no value on him it was just another death to so many people but to me it was life-saving it was life-changing and it says surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but it was our pain he took and our diseases were put upon him while to us he seemed as one diseased on whom God's punishment had come how could this be the Son of God hanging on the cross being treated that way no he deserved what he got is what people were thinking but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed but it was for our sins he was wounded and for our evil doings he was crushed he took the punishment by which we have peace and by his wounds we are made well what could you do to earn this salvation what could you give for it to what extent could you go to say Okay God would say okay that's enough no it took a perfect sacrifice says all we like sheep have gone astray and have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all we all went wandering like sheep going every one of us after his desire and the Lord put on him the punishment of us all what I deserved he took every stripe every lashing every smacking every everything they did you were on his mind while he was going through that he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he be he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before his shears is done so he opened not his mouth men were cruel to him but he was gentle and quiet as a lamb taken to its death and as a sheep before those who take her wool make no sound so he said not a word until he said it is finished when he knew everything had been covered and taken care the thought I had was works are based on love you do works because you love him and he did all the work that he did because he loves you he knows you by name he knows everything about you both what we would call good and bad but he still loved you he still cared he still took care of it and just a little description of him the Lord Jesus Christ the greatest the highest the most powerful of whom there is no equal worthy of all adoration honor and praise worship to be exalted and I just put an on and on and on where do you stop he says yet the most humble the most forgiving loving caring he could hide himself with the common people and disappear in a crowd walk with the lowly and unworthy ones hang on a cross with thieves the only one who keeps all his word and he knows every name of every one of his own not one shall be lost and God it is all yea and amen that's a description of the one that loves you the one that cares for you the one who had you and his heart and his mind when he hung on the cross amen now just I'm going to do this a little bit different show this to brother Daniel before we were talking and just kind of looking at some things and just some thoughts just some some things that sometimes you hear another Minister speak sometimes you read sometimes you hear something and it catches your heart and you you write a note and so I just kind of put some of these things together and and and I would just say approach God as a son or a daughter you know when I go to my dad I I uh to the to their house Mom dad's house we knock on the door just it's more to let them know we're there not to ask permission to come in because the house is open to us now we're respectful about it but it's my father my mother and they say come on in and God is the same way you come seeking knocking asking he's waiting for that he wants that from you he wants you to come and says father my son my daughter come on in let's have Fellowship what can I do for you you know and when you think about this approach God as a son and daughter and the thought the prodigal son was always a son he was always a son when the father was looking back down the way he was said my son he never said it any different now the son came back thinking about himself I'm not worthy to be your son I've made a mess in my life I've ruined my inheritance I've done this that and the other I'll just be a servant and and his father said no you are my son always a son or a daughter in in this is the one that brother Dan he was just reading through this and he says I like that having the right spirit and the wrong Doctrine and not the other way around then God can work with you how many times we work hard to make sure we got every word in the right place every period everything but with the contrary spirit if I say Lord fix this heart first make it right before you and then it can say Amen to your word look into Grace and not our mistakes confession of mistakes not excuses to clean them you don't go before God and say it's because of this I did that there is no forgiveness in that but when you go Lord I failed you I did wrong would you forgive me he says yes and and sometimes we want to make them look better we want to clean them up but just go to God and say it's what it is Lord help me take note of what's in your heart and not what's in your head because this is where you have all the problems this is where Satan likes to get in and just twist things around oh you know like he went to Eve I know he said but I think he really meant this but look in your heart something in your heart says no I'm going to stay true to God I know that if I'll go back to him he'll receive me I know that if I say sorry he'll accept me because that's who he is and I was thinking of David with this thought when Satan what Satan fears the most is when what you know becomes a revelation in your heart from God and then you can put a stone in the sling and go after a giant and we have a lot of giants in our lives at times a lot of the Giants they live right here it's amazing you get such a big giant such a small place at times it wraps up your life it takes so much of your time sometimes you can't sleep sometimes you can't rest sometimes you want to pray and you say Lord I don't even know how you're going to hear me with all this going on but if you'll say father I am your son I am your daughter I'm coming through the shed blood of your only son Jesus the accepted one the rest of it gets pushed away it gets pushed aside there is no sin too great too big too many too many mistakes that you could do that he would say you're not mine anymore you're one of his and then this is I would hit me sometimes you just have to give it up and let God see that you mean it Lord I'm going through a hard time right now and I'm hurting so I'm going to give it up but when I'm feeling better I'm going to get it back now when you God says you're willing to say whatever it takes I want to let it go I'm going to commit it to you Lord I said then he will go to work on it because the Battle Belongs to the Lord when David he stood there on God's word looking at Goliath he didn't compare himself to the Giant he said this is God's Children Here we are his heirs and how could that Philistine be saying things like that no our God is greater our sister and brother Daniel singing that song He's greater than any situation even when the situation looks that little to when it looks that big you know you look at the heavens and and you'll see all those stars and sometimes I'll get on on a site and just look at the pictures taken by the Hubble and the different uh things they sent up to take pictures and been traveling out there for years and it's absolutely amazing what's out there sometimes you wonder could it really be real well we see such a small port but it's his it's all his so what is I don't mean this wrong but what is your little speck compared to that we're the ones that sometimes make it this big we look at Goliath and he just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and I keep getting smaller and smaller no take God at his word and go take it down you're human I think all of us could raise our hands oh yeah so I have to raise both because sometimes it's even worse than that you know but he's God so therefore I can go to him with whatever the situation says here it is Lord I've tried to put it together and it's not working out so I'm committing it to you as we were talking the other night I was I believe myself and and brother Lyle last Wednesday talking about some experiences and brother Daniel back here and I said you know who the greatest boss is the best boss you could have is the one who's been through where where you're at right now one who went through all the training and the experiences a couple of the best the best guys that I worked under had already done what I was going through and if you needed help they could walk out out and show you how to do it and how many times they did when we were in a hurry they would come out of the offense to come outside let us get it done let's work on this together and that's my God he wrapped himself in flesh and he walked on this Earth as a human so when I say I need some help he says I've been there I know that feeling I know that Temptation I know what happens when those thoughts come that way and he can help the ones that are hard to deal with the ones that sit in the office and on the phone tell you what to do I don't know but directions on the phone can be really hard sometimes but when somebody is there showing you and working with you something else we heard brother green often say look we're living for others is looking heaven in the face because there was one that that's all he'd lived for was for others his whole life was about me and you that's why he came in in just just the way they came to me I wrote them down well she typed him out for me let's just be honest because usually by now I wouldn't be able to read my own writing so when God is testing you and he does and the only way you know is when you go through the test to pass the test you have to take the test there was a teacher in in high school and he gave the test and he said the test is the first three pages of this book and if you memorize the first three pages and just basically write it all back down you'll Ace the test so I did I think I got two words wrong I crossed them and one other girl did and we're the only two that passed the test she took the time that's what that's what the teacher said to do so I did it and he goes up two of you did what I said both of you passed nobody else did God said take him at his word and how do you know his word when you begin to study it when you began to read it when you began to experience it when you began to fellowship with him in his word yeah God testing you to see your action how you act that's the only way you know if you know the product how good the product is by testing it by trying it by using it have a brother-in-law who used to sell I think it was Kirby vacuum cleaners they would go out to the houses and they knock on your door and they would say I'd like to test mine against yours and they would tell you and this is what he shared with me he said you wore cuffed pants and you would tell them go bring your vacuum and when or or you would have them vacuum up a space and then tell them to put their vacuum away and then he said when they put their vacuum away you took the dust out of your cuffs and you sprinkled that ground again and then you took the Kirby back I believe it was Kirby maybe it was another one and then he said then you would vacuum and then you would show them all the dust there vacuum mist he said that's how you tried to get a sale but the one that said try me test me see if I can perform went through everything that you've gone through it's hard to imagine that he could have thoughts go through his head that way but he could not be tested and attempted and tried to understand us if it didn't happen that's why you don't go worship a rock a stone you're worshiping a living God one who's been there has done it he said I Was Born This Way you must be born again you must be born again and when you get knocked down and when you fall down get right backed up get back up stand up again saying Lord I failed you're not saved by your Works you're saved by grace it's not how many times I get it right it's when I come completely give it over to him because he got it right the first time that's what he's looking at and I'm going to ask a question it's not a trick question how many are righteous in here how many are righteous because the righteous one stands in your place you have to accept that you're not righteous of your own but the righteous one stands in your place a righteous man is not a sinless man you have the righteousness of God in you Jesus Christ is the perfect sacrifice accepted in your place God looks at what his son did his righteousness for you how do I stay clean how do I keep clean what do I do you keep clean by confession and repentance I'm sorry I didn't mean that Lord help me as many times as it happens you make it right you know after what is it 44 years now we never hurt each other we never we're way past not quite no no there are still times I'll have to say I'm sorry I didn't mean it that way and if I did I'm sorry anyways it's the same way with the Lord remember when you go back to him and he's cleaned it out already and you tell him I did it again and he says what did you do and he looks at no the it's clean it's clean there's no evidence of it there it's washed away it's the first time you've done it yeah brother green called him the Crooked lawyer remember he takes the evidence he gets rid of it keep clean by confession and repentance now here here's this and this just kind of maybe put in a little bit of Works to it we can't wash our own laundry by our own works you think of a a washer and you know and I mean the electric kind not the one you're married to Brothers but the electric kind that you plug in and turn on what do you do you turn the machine on you put the water in you put the soap in and that machine begins to work yeah unless some of you are still jiggling the machine and moving it back and forth and trying to figure out how it works no the simple ways plug it in and turn it on so you cannot clean yourself by your own works then who justifies or who says how much is good enough only one heard it was enough and that was my Jesus when the father said it is finished ah we must let the blood wash us clean the work that was already done remember the natural Lamb's blood just covered sin for a year but it didn't take the desire away you know you can you can read hear from ministers brother Branham different ministers have touched on this and they say they would go away with a relief the lamb had been slain they had brought their lamb the high priest Lane the lamb the sacrifice had been accepted they went with that relief of it's covered again but the desire hadn't changed and when you still have that desire what happens you go back to what caused problems in the first place so it only covered that for a year and that was God's mercy that was being being merciful to them because he looked at a sacrifice that was accepted and then you know Abel and Cain way back in the very beginning after sin had happened in the garden and God had taken in slain lamb to cover for Adam and Eve and Adam and Eve I'm sure had had shown the uh Abel and Cain what had happened how an innocent lamb had to die how its blood had to be shed and and it came time to offer sacrifice and we know Cain offered his works that which he did which he grew what he's what he planted it was beautiful and and but but Adam had caught I mean um Abel had caught Revelation said something has to die in my place because that's what happened in the first first time and and the thought of this is if if Abel's sacrifice is being accepted When the Smoke Rose and is being accepted uh he would would think he would stop well if that's what it takes then that's what I'll do but he didn't do that he kept offering what he thought was good there is only one acceptable sacrifice and that was the Lord Jesus Christ offering himself you have to accept what he has done for you and when I say acceptance not just raising your hand and saying yes I accept it how many came that way and say I accept the Lord Jesus Billy Graham says I come and I hold this convention and 30 000 raise their hands and say yes I accept the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior but when he came back he said there might be 10 20 of them left but when you accept the sacrifice in your place then he comes in and begins to live in you and then it's there with you always you still make mistakes you still fail why you still have this human body you will make mistakes you still will fail but there is a sacrifice a perfect sacrifice there for you you know before service I uh I was thinking who do I ask this question to and I didn't see brother Dan so he didn't have to try to answer it but brother Lyle came walking by in about that and um you know you know brother Lyle the things that he's done and and been involved with and everything and I asked him one day and I'm not saying this to embarrass him I said where did you go to college for all this he said I didn't in fact he said the fur he was working for a Hamilton Airline or one of the airline companies here in Tucson and and somebody came in looking for something to do may be made and his boss said I know just the man that can do it and he took them over there to brother Lyle and brother Lyle said I didn't even know what they were talking about but I said yes and then he studied and now things that brother Lyle has done is amazing but I asked him I said what is gravity and he began to explain how gravity works what it does and we all know gravity is you drop something at false and if your foot in the way it hurts and everything but what is gravity I asked him he said nobody can really tell you what gravity is just how it works you see it manifested faith is a little bit like gravity you can talk about it you can experience it you can believe it but you can't really explain it give me a bag full of faith sell me some faith no it's an experience you know so this man that I heard speaking this or talking about this he was in Australia and he was at a well-known scientist he'd gone to see it and the man he said had a big black book and it said gravity so he asked him he said is that the book that tells you what gravity is and he said no all it tells you is how it works so that's what brought this thought he says gravity I trust it if I throw something up and it's coming down I get out of the way if I'm not trying to catch it I don't told him to say well gravity doesn't work today it's going to take off no you get out of the way if it's falling you get out of the way why because you've experienced gravity do you drop something down to the ground he goes and if you fall I haven't seen anybody float away they fall down to the ground gravity works that way I trust it I step on it every day walk in the path of gravity every day and I don't even make excuses for Gravity it is what it is I've I know of of two I don't know them personally but I read it in this book right here and I know this book is nothing but the truth there was one named Enoch who walked off I can't explain it how it happened but the Bible says he walked and was seen not and there was another one who ascended my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ but everybody else went to the Grave I don't understand gravity therefore I don't believe it I don't know anybody that has ever said that because I don't understand it I can't believe it no I see it it takes place in fact every time I've fallen down the same reaction I've fallen down it hasn't changed you take Faith the same way you trust it you walk in it you believe it even if you can't explain it explain to me Faith we could describe it up and down back and forth sister Connie explained Faith to me today but it works doesn't it it's the truth you take God at his word he keeps his word sometimes we say Lord where are you because we want it done then but God has perfect timing God knows how to do those things I as I was just kind of reading some of these things and some of these were just taken from something I heard somebody say something I read through the scriptures whatever and just just made a list of um notes points however you want to say just things that sometimes we take for granted yet it is simple if I throw it up it's coming back down even if it's a helium balloon eventually it's coming back down if I Take God at his word it will come to pass it has never failed God said it and it happened I've heard enough testimonies from enough folks to show we have one sitting right here that knows that he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever how many could how many knows that personally in your life what he's done for you brother Lyle back there that had that heart attack and look where he is today because God's A Healer he's the same yesterday today and forever and sometimes we do get frustrated sometimes we do get anxious sometimes we say when Lord when Lord but he has perfect timing he knows how to do it you know I'm going to say this because I've told this to brother Daniel I get to see it a little bit different brother Daniel back there after before and after Ministry and um brother Daniel comes across very confident have watched him how he works and how he does it it's who he is but I've seen brother Daniel back there shaken also why because because you've got something in your heart to deliver but you're just a man if you could have been around brother Branham you listen to brother Green's testimony brother Bissell some of those have spent time with them found out he was just a man but he knew a living God who was the same yesterday today and forever and you know what you can know that same God the same way last Sunday and he said he wasn't going to hear this live but he'd hear it a little bit after because he'd be traveling last Sunday as service was starting and I was walking back this way and something said go pray for brother Daniel not an audible voice just something in my heart said go so I knocked on the door brother Daniel said come in I stepped in I said can I pray for you and he said please he's just sitting there kind of holding his head don't go back there and you don't go back there to sleep you don't go back there to kick your you're asking God to help you when you come out because you're his you're his purchased possession we're here to help you that's what we're here for so I just put my arms around him I said Lord you know his burden you know what it is you just asked me to come pray for him so I'm asking you go with him help him and he ministered last Sunday then later he said had you not come to pray for me I didn't know if I could have come out I said but he did and if you'll do what God tells you to do watch him work you say well I'm insufficient but he's all sufficient he doesn't look and say well that one's good so I can use him no he goes after Peter's he goes after different people like that and says I'll show you that this is me and not them and I appreciate that his goodness and his grace remember you take Faith the same way you walk in the door you flip the light switch expecting the light to turn on in fact you generally don't even stop you just hit the light switch and keep going now if the bill hasn't been paid the electric bill except I'll tell you the bill has already been paid he's taking care of it all you can take him at his word for anything and everything you have made of but but brother Aaron I've made a mess of my life there isn't one of us that hasn't made a mess in our life and even if you don't think you haven't made a message of your life yes you have you are born and shaped born in sin and shaped in iniquity that's what the scripture says about you but God so loved the world that he who gave His only begotten son for me and for you one more thing before we close and the musicians can come up I'm sorry today I just got a 25 salary so I've used it no I told Brother Dan it'll be short just want to share this you know it's it's it's one of those things where you you you you compare yourself you look and you say am I worthy of it the worthy one already paid for it the worthy one already took care of it and what makes him happy is when you will take him at his word and go accept I remember brother green standing over this pulpit and I believe it was a twenty dollar bill and he said whoever wants this come and get it and nobody got up except one person and they got the 20 bill brother green gave it to him God is offering his Mercy his grace his forgiveness his love his life it's for you to take it whatever you have need of God offers him [Music] is that true or not amen how many would testify with an upright's hand I know that God is more than able he's done it for me he's the same yesterday today and forever now we have a special need for tonight my sister spoke to her this afternoon you know she's been coming back and forth from Sierra Vista here because of dialysis and they did the surgery for the graph and then they put another one and it's just turned into a series of complications and I'll say this is told her I was going to say as best I could without too much detail about what you're going to understand when she had her second daughter my niece Eileen she slipped and she fell my sister did and she injured herself and they had to remove some of the muscles in there that helps you go to the bathroom so since then she's always had to have medication to go

pain she cannot go to the bathroom she said I I am spasming constantly just so I said he's Jesus Christ he says I know he is we were raised this way we knew but it hurts I'm uncomfortable I have to it's just constant pain and I said Lord what do we do tonight and the Lord brought to back to him in my memory how they would some that would come and brother Branham in the prayer line would say oh you're not here for yourself you're here for somebody else and he would tell him who they were for and what now go tell them [Music] I still I believe he's still the same yesterday today and forever now I've been with my wife while she's bearing children but I didn't go through what she went through and some of you have if you've had children she's going through a hard time [Music] so if you all

but she's one of yours she's in much pain right now much discomfort the doctors have done three surgeries now on her there's been complications with them I told her we would pray and she said please she knows you to be a Healer she was at the point of death not too long ago they brought her to the hospital they didn't give her much hope dad was there he was holding her hand praying she had had no response at all and suddenly she squeezed his hand we were out of town and dad called he said she just squeezed my hand God has heard we know you're a living God [Music] there's some Lord sisters here
