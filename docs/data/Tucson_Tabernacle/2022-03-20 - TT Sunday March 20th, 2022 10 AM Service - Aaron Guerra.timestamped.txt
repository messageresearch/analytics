[48:27] you were just another employee because
[48:28] they had thousands of employees
[48:31] all over the country and maybe even
[48:32] different parts of the world
[48:36] and working for local companies you
[48:38] could go to your manager who could go to
[48:40] the owner and get it resolved quickly
[48:43] but you're working for a large
[48:45] corporation with a lot of employees you
[48:47] go to your manager who goes to his
[48:48] manager who goes to the regional manager
[48:50] who goes to the area manager and then a
[48:53] month later come back and they ask you
[48:54] what was the question
[48:56] and you start all over
[48:58] and i didn't know that when i went to
[49:00] work there he told me when my boss told
[49:02] me he said
[49:03] don't expect a quick answer
[49:05] it's got to go through the system
[49:08] but if you'll just bow your heart down
[49:10] before him
[49:12] and go directly to him
[49:15] he'll answer back
[49:17] because he loves you he takes care of
[49:19] you
[49:21] appreciate his goodness and his mercy
[49:23] and
[49:24] he's so good to us i'd like to read
[49:26] something to you it was from the daily
[49:27] strength
[49:29] came in
[49:30] last night i read it just a portion
[49:35] taken from mark chapter 4 verses 26 to
[49:38] 29
[49:40] and he said
[49:41] so is the kingdom of god if a man should
[49:43] cast seed into the ground
[49:45] and he should sleep and rise night and
[49:48] day
[49:49] and the seed should spring and grow up
[49:52] he knoweth not how
[49:54] for the earth bringeth forth fruit of
[49:56] herself first the blade then the ear
[50:00] after that the full corn in the ear
[50:03] but when the fruit is brought forth
[50:06] immediately he putteth a sickle because
[50:08] harvest has come
[50:10] and sometimes we get anxious in our own
[50:12] selves
[50:13] i i've i've wanted this i i want the
[50:16] manifestation of god
[50:18] the peace of god whatever it might be
[50:20] and we get anxious for it
[50:22] but god has a time
[50:24] and a place for it all
[50:26] and this was a thought
[50:29] there were two brothers lawrence and
[50:31] frank leibach that wrote a famous piece
[50:33] of christian literature called
[50:35] practicing his presence
[50:37] and that almost seems contrary
[50:40] practicing his presence
[50:43] you've heard the term practice makes
[50:45] perfect
[50:47] but perfect practice makes perfect
[50:51] because if you practice something wrong
[50:53] you'll get it wrong every time
[50:56] you know i practice practice but you
[50:58] were practicing wrong okay
[51:00] but he just said
[51:03] in the book one of them writes at times
[51:06] i fill my whole mind and heart being
[51:08] raised up into god's presence
[51:11] as if without effort
[51:13] that they had always belonged there
[51:17] when you experience the presence of god
[51:20] like this
[51:21] and know that you have experienced the
[51:22] lord in a unique unique way you will
[51:25] never be the same person
[51:27] and that is the truth
[51:29] you will never get to the point where
[51:31] you've had enough of the lord's presence
[51:33] we must practice being in his presence
[51:36] and make him feel welcome in our lives
[51:39] because it is only in his presence that
[51:41] we will become mature and thereby
[51:43] receive our translation into glory
[51:46] so practicing what is practicing praying
[51:49] every day
[51:50] reading your brother brown says read
[51:52] your bible and pray every day
[51:54] and make that a practice
[51:57] at times when it's even difficult you've
[51:59] got so much going on everything you're
[52:01] getting but take some time
[52:04] to practice it till it becomes part of
[52:07] your what you do what you are
[52:11] different different uh people that you
[52:14] might you know especially in sports and
[52:16] different things like that but whatever
[52:17] it is
[52:18] they'll talk about the dedication and
[52:21] the time spent
[52:22] to get to the place that they're at
[52:24] today
[52:25] yeah and i know there's some people that
[52:27] just seem to be born into it
[52:30] we we ran cross country and there was a
[52:33] young man a freshman
[52:36] for every uh uh
[52:39] whatever exercise it was whether it was
[52:40] jumping jacks or stretching you did
[52:43] ten he did one
[52:45] he hardly did it at all but he won every
[52:48] race that he ran
[52:50] and those of us that practice and
[52:52] stretch were always disappointed
[52:54] because we did everything but he was a
[52:56] natural runner
[52:58] and i'm not saying there are some people
[52:59] that way but there is a practice that
[53:01] you put in
[53:04] read your bible and pray spend time with
[53:06] god do those things which are good
[53:09] it is a practice it becomes part of your
[53:11] life
[53:13] and you know
[53:14] jesus
[53:15] humbled himself before his father
[53:19] he could have said i'm god
[53:22] and i don't need to listen
[53:24] i've got it but no he learned obedience
[53:27] through the things he suffered
[53:30] and sometimes we say lord why am i going
[53:32] through this again he said because i'm
[53:33] teaching you i'm working with you to
[53:36] become that which
[53:37] i've already seen you
[53:39] i've already seen the fruit there so
[53:43] and david says what man is he that
[53:45] feareth the lord now that fear is not
[53:47] being afraid
[53:49] but having respect and reverence
[53:51] realizing his awesomeness realizing what
[53:54] he can do
[53:56] but that he loves you
[53:58] and he has
[54:00] your best interest in mind
[54:03] he says
[54:04] him shall he teach in the way that he
[54:06] shall shall choose god will teach him or
[54:09] should he the way that god has appointed
[54:12] it to be
[54:14] and and sometimes we'll get to looking
[54:16] at somebody else's blessings
[54:18] what somebody else is going through and
[54:20] it seems that they're just further along
[54:22] than we are they get more blessings they
[54:24] seem to go along but god has a reason
[54:29] when you see um
[54:32] and i'm just going to use this as an
[54:33] example the truck that you want
[54:37] and you see it drive by on the road and
[54:39] you look at it and you say my
[54:41] i'd love to have that truck
[54:44] and you're kind of you look at the boy
[54:47] and in your mind
[54:48] and that person is driving it already
[54:51] and sometimes you forget that god gave
[54:53] you what you're driving
[54:57] but you're looking at something else and
[54:58] you're desiring it
[55:00] and i'm not saying that that's wrong to
[55:01] do that but sometimes you get to looking
[55:03] at what other blessings somebody else is
[55:05] getting you're wondering why am i
[55:06] shorted
[55:08] but god chooses your way
[55:12] and learning to surrender and yield to
[55:14] that and sometimes that's the hard part
[55:17] it seems like my brother and my sister
[55:19] or my friend or this church or that
[55:21] church seems to get more blessings
[55:25] the first quote fellowship through the
[55:26] reconciliation of the blood
[55:30] some things that brother branham says
[55:34] it's it's if if you
[55:36] realize it in your own life
[55:38] sometimes your thoughts or something
[55:40] what's burning in your heart
[55:42] and you'll open a scripture or you'll
[55:44] open a message and it seems like right
[55:46] there on that first paragraph or right
[55:47] there
[55:48] god speaks right back to you
[55:51] because
[55:52] he will take care of me and i can trust
[55:54] him
[55:57] in the beginning when god made man in
[55:59] his own image put him in the garden of
[56:01] eden he had a perfect fellowship
[56:04] in the late of the afternoon the evening
[56:06] time when the twilights was falling i
[56:08] can see the great jehovah come across
[56:10] the top of the palm trees and the
[56:12] roaring of the thunder
[56:14] when adam and eve gathered out there
[56:17] in the great open air cathedral and
[56:18] worshiped god had fellowship talked with
[56:20] him
[56:21] the lion the tigers all coming up around
[56:24] in perfect harmony
[56:26] wouldn't that be a wonderful place to
[56:28] live
[56:30] amen
[56:32] you know we
[56:34] dad took us when we were kids too
[56:36] i think it then it was called lion
[56:37] country safari in san diego
[56:40] and you drove your vehicles through it
[56:41] was one of the first ones you got to
[56:43] drive your vehicle dude we're kids
[56:45] we're trying to stick our heads out the
[56:47] windows and everything you know
[56:50] and suddenly we noticed all the lions
[56:52] coming towards us and it was about 15 of
[56:54] them
[56:55] running towards our
[56:56] truck and
[56:59] we all backed away from the windows
[57:02] and we're like is it my dad's red truck
[57:04] is it the red truck is that what we
[57:06] didn't know the food truck was falling
[57:07] right behind us
[57:09] had nothing to do with our red truck but
[57:12] would you ask me and my brothers we were
[57:14] terrified because the lions were coming
[57:15] after us
[57:17] and sometimes you get looking that way
[57:19] and you get feeling that way it's
[57:20] because of this but god has you in mind
[57:24] and a reason and a why
[57:27] because he takes care of you
[57:29] and you imagine that place of harmony
[57:32] when the lion and the tiger would come
[57:34] and they just come and lay down at adam
[57:35] and eve's feet and be petted and be
[57:38] touched by them what an amazing time
[57:43] wouldn't that be a wonderful place to
[57:45] live at abiding place where there's no
[57:47] sickness
[57:50] it's hard to read that way
[57:53] no sorrow no way of ever being upset
[57:56] everything's in perfect harmony god in
[57:59] harmony with his creature
[58:01] and the creature in harmony with his
[58:03] maker what a perfect time a complete
[58:06] fellowship
[58:07] that's the way god intended it
[58:11] he'd come in the cool of the evening
[58:14] to fellowship with his children
[58:17] and you know it it's
[58:19] it's such a time to sit down with your
[58:21] own children with your family with your
[58:23] loved ones and have a good fellowship
[58:27] and it's just it's a pleasure
[58:29] but then there are those that haven't
[58:31] had that pleasure don't have the pledge
[58:32] satan has gone in and mixed things up
[58:34] and life is difficult for them
[58:37] but we ought to be grateful that god has
[58:39] been good to us about that
[58:42] the next quote
[58:45] there's two quotes on this
[58:47] when man was made in the image of god
[58:49] and then god came down in the image of
[58:51] man to redeem man
[58:54] that that brought man and god together
[58:56] heavens and earth hugged and kissed each
[58:58] other
[58:59] god and man embrace each other as
[59:02] fatherhood and sonship when the logos
[59:05] became flesh and dwelt among us
[59:08] jesus said i came from god and i go to
[59:11] god is that right
[59:13] after his death burial and resurrection
[59:15] and ascension
[59:16] when the body was taken up to set at the
[59:19] right hand of god
[59:20] i don't mean god's got a right hand
[59:22] god's a spirit but at the right hand
[59:24] means his power
[59:26] and authority of god
[59:28] that in the name everything in heaven is
[59:30] named after it and subject to it
[59:32] everything in earth is named after and
[59:34] subject to him a name above all names
[59:37] jesus christ
[59:39] now this logo was in him which was a
[59:41] spirit of god the anointing through the
[59:43] sanctifying grace of the blood brought
[59:46] many sons to god
[59:48] which is anointed with the same logos
[59:52] it wasn't for him
[59:55] it was for me and you
[59:57] his desire of his family to share that
[1:00:01] the very spirit of god in you and me
[1:00:05] has hard times
[1:00:06] that we wonder lord where is it
[1:00:09] when we have our ups and downs
[1:00:11] and sometimes more downs and ups
[1:00:14] but that's okay
[1:00:18] one more quote there abraham's covenant
[1:00:20] confirmed
[1:00:25] and when i can show you in the bible
[1:00:27] that he forgives all our iniquity
[1:00:29] oh god heals all our diseases let me
[1:00:32] just take hold of that promise and say
[1:00:35] father god i'm weak
[1:00:37] i need you
[1:00:38] i know you keep your word
[1:00:40] your el shaddai
[1:00:42] i'm believing you lord fill me with your
[1:00:44] spirit wash me in your blood
[1:00:46] take me back o lord and try me let me
[1:00:49] lean against your bosom i am your child
[1:00:52] i was don't born to you but i got weak
[1:00:56] but you're my strength giver
[1:00:58] you promised you would do it and i'm
[1:01:00] just going to hold right there lord and
[1:01:02] i'm going to be satisfied that you'll
[1:01:04] fill me with your spirit wash me in your
[1:01:07] blood take away all of my condemnation
[1:01:10] heal my body and make me well
[1:01:13] what a promise it is
[1:01:15] to confirm his promise to abraham i'm el
[1:01:19] shaddai
[1:01:20] and he never changes
[1:01:23] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:26] forever
[1:01:28] and realize it
[1:01:30] every promise in god's word everything
[1:01:32] that was written and allowed for us to
[1:01:34] read is because he had you in mind
[1:01:37] because he's still the same yesterday
[1:01:39] today and forever
[1:01:42] sometimes we say well that was good for
[1:01:43] david that was good for abraham and it
[1:01:45] was
[1:01:46] it was good for brother branham it was
[1:01:48] good for brother green but it's good for
[1:01:49] me
[1:01:50] and i can take his very promises
[1:01:54] so as i was thinking this was david
[1:01:56] speaking here
[1:01:58] looking at the life of david
[1:02:00] looking at the life of solomon
[1:02:03] and looking at the life of paul brother
[1:02:06] lyle spoke
[1:02:08] wednesday night on paul and
[1:02:09] god had put a portion in my heart
[1:02:11] already
[1:02:13] just something that
[1:02:14] paul had said
[1:02:16] and then brother lyle brought a portion
[1:02:18] it just tied in well and i love a god
[1:02:21] that just works that way
[1:02:24] you know
[1:02:24] somebody here preaching it this way and
[1:02:26] then somebody here preaching it this way
[1:02:28] in the congregation and going which way
[1:02:30] is it
[1:02:31] but god ties it all together
[1:02:35] so what man is he that feareth the lord
[1:02:38] has respect has reverent understand
[1:02:41] that it's not him but is god and has
[1:02:43] respect unto god
[1:02:45] him shall he teach in the way that he
[1:02:47] shall choose in the way that god
[1:02:48] appointeth verse 13
[1:02:51] his soul shall dwell at ease
[1:02:54] that's not kicking back taking it easy
[1:02:56] and got nothing to do but there will be
[1:02:58] a rest there'll be a peace there'll be a
[1:03:01] portion that no matter what the trouble
[1:03:03] and what the problem is they'll say god
[1:03:05] is still in control
[1:03:07] and he has me in mind jesus
[1:03:14] his soul shall dwell at ease and his
[1:03:16] seed shall inherit or possess
[1:03:19] the earth
[1:03:22] every step in the land is possession
[1:03:28] you get out and you walk all over the
[1:03:30] promises of god if i could say it that
[1:03:32] way i don't mean step on your bible i
[1:03:33] mean walk in his promises and said
[1:03:36] that's mine
[1:03:37] that's my god said so
[1:03:39] healing is mine
[1:03:41] salvation is mine peace is mine rest is
[1:03:45] mine
[1:03:46] because god said so
[1:03:48] even in the middle of the night when you
[1:03:49] wake up because there's a sudden noise a
[1:03:51] sudden disturbance
[1:03:53] and nobody wakes up and goes oh
[1:03:55] i guess i'll get up and go see that no
[1:03:58] we jump out of bed what was that what
[1:03:59] was that
[1:04:00] that's our first reaction
[1:04:02] but when you wake up and you know god is
[1:04:04] watching you over here i can plant my
[1:04:06] feet on the ground and i can walk
[1:04:08] because god is watching over me
[1:04:11] every step
[1:04:12] in the land is possession
[1:04:16] and in today's land we're talking about
[1:04:17] the word of god
[1:04:19] this is my land this is my inheritance
[1:04:22] what god has promised me walk in it open
[1:04:25] it read it practice it
[1:04:28] god said brother branham had taught us
[1:04:30] he says you can never pray enough
[1:04:34] but you can practice
[1:04:36] you can put yourself to doing it
[1:04:38] and praying doesn't mean you're on your
[1:04:40] knees
[1:04:41] all the time
[1:04:43] because sometimes you're working all day
[1:04:45] sometimes you're driving but you can
[1:04:46] still talk to god and he can talk back
[1:04:49] to you
[1:04:52] and then david says
[1:04:55] the secret of the lord is with them that
[1:04:58] fear him
[1:04:59] the thoughts the things that god wants
[1:05:02] to reveal the unveiling of his word is
[1:05:05] with them
[1:05:06] that god wants to and fellowship he says
[1:05:10] to them that fear him and he will show
[1:05:12] them his covenant his counsel his
[1:05:15] friendship
[1:05:18] you know
[1:05:19] if if if
[1:05:20] if you got letters received somebody's
[1:05:23] writing to you and you they write them
[1:05:25] in beautiful stationary and good writing
[1:05:27] and all but you never open the letter
[1:05:29] you just stack them there
[1:05:30] you'll never know what they say
[1:05:32] you could suppose you could guess well
[1:05:35] you know i know enough about them they
[1:05:36] probably said open it up and read it
[1:05:40] open the word of god said hey your word
[1:05:42] says this lord
[1:05:44] i've talked to some folks who had never
[1:05:45] read the bible
[1:05:47] never they always had some and they
[1:05:48] opened it for themselves and said wow
[1:05:50] this is this is amazing what god says
[1:05:54] it is for us
[1:05:57] he says here
[1:06:01] the secret of the lord his counsel his
[1:06:03] friendship his own feelings his own how
[1:06:06] he is
[1:06:08] then he says mine eyes
[1:06:10] my thoughts my vision my desires are
[1:06:13] ever towards the lord
[1:06:16] for he shall pluck my feet out of the
[1:06:18] net
[1:06:20] when you think of a net it's an
[1:06:21] entrapment it's something that tangles
[1:06:23] you something that holds you to keep you
[1:06:25] from moving forward these entanglements
[1:06:27] confusion disappointments
[1:06:30] and those are part of life
[1:06:33] there are disappointments there is
[1:06:34] confusion at times which way what do i
[1:06:36] look how do i turn
[1:06:39] um
[1:06:40] i worked with a young man that had this
[1:06:43] dyslexia and i didn't know it at the
[1:06:44] time and i was going to send him to
[1:06:47] phoenix and he told me when i say he was
[1:06:48] young he was probably in his early 20s
[1:06:50] maybe late teens
[1:06:52] and i know he'd graduated from high
[1:06:54] school and all so i said i'm going to
[1:06:56] send you up to phoenix and
[1:06:58] you go pick up some material and he says
[1:06:59] i can't do that
[1:07:01] i said well you drive to work every day
[1:07:03] you should be able to drive he goes yeah
[1:07:04] because i know how to get here i said
[1:07:06] well it's real simple i'll give you a
[1:07:07] map
[1:07:09] and then he looks at me goes i got
[1:07:10] dyslexia
[1:07:13] he said and when i get nervous
[1:07:14] everything flips
[1:07:16] and when i look at a sign i'm not sure
[1:07:18] if i'm reading it right
[1:07:21] and without the holy spirit
[1:07:24] without a yielding and surrendering to
[1:07:26] god
[1:07:27] you'll have spiritual dyslexia
[1:07:30] you'll look at it and you'll not be too
[1:07:31] sure
[1:07:32] could it be could it not be
[1:07:35] it's just a natural application to that
[1:07:39] but if you'll trust in the leadership of
[1:07:41] the lord and if you'll practice
[1:07:44] learning how to yield learning how to
[1:07:45] surrender learning how to let go and let
[1:07:47] god have his way he will lead you he
[1:07:50] will guide you he'll direct you
[1:07:53] keep you away from the
[1:07:55] entanglements the confusions the
[1:07:57] disappointments
[1:07:59] life has its disappointments
[1:08:01] frustrations
[1:08:03] there's pains there's sicknesses there's
[1:08:05] hurts it's part of life
[1:08:07] it came in the fall
[1:08:10] but he became me
[1:08:12] so that i through his grace could become
[1:08:14] him
[1:08:16] he walked this earth
[1:08:18] he wore a body of flesh he suffered he
[1:08:20] bled he was sick he was tired he was
[1:08:22] worn
[1:08:24] he had his frustrations
[1:08:27] he called those those brothers of his
[1:08:29] those ones that he had just met he goes
[1:08:30] oh fools and slow of heart
[1:08:34] they had just just walked with him now
[1:08:37] he's going through emmaus and and they
[1:08:39] don't even recognize him and he called
[1:08:41] them fools
[1:08:43] the bible says the fool says there is no
[1:08:45] god
[1:08:47] have you ever looked at it that way
[1:08:50] they had thought god had died
[1:08:53] and in their mind there was no god
[1:08:58] walking and saying
[1:09:00] we thought he was going to be the one we
[1:09:02] thought at this time it was going to be
[1:09:04] and he says o fools slow of heart
[1:09:08] did not i tell you did not i say have
[1:09:11] not you read in the word jesus christ is
[1:09:13] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:09:16] healeth all thy diseases he forgiveth
[1:09:18] thine iniquities
[1:09:20] and when you live trapped up and
[1:09:22] entangled disappointed because you can't
[1:09:23] just seem to overcome go to him
[1:09:27] and realize he's with you
[1:09:30] a solomon
[1:09:32] in proverbs
[1:09:36] this is david's son
[1:09:38] the bible says and
[1:09:40] the wisest man on earth
[1:09:42] why was he that because his heart
[1:09:44] pleased god
[1:09:47] god told him you can have anything you
[1:09:49] asked for
[1:09:52] proverbs 3 11 through 13 is the
[1:09:54] scripture we'll be reading
[1:09:56] but god tells them he said solomon you
[1:09:58] can have anything you ask for riches
[1:10:02] untold wealth
[1:10:04] and he says give me a heart to rule the
[1:10:06] people
[1:10:08] and it pleased god so much
[1:10:12] he said i'll give you that and
[1:10:14] everything else too
[1:10:16] and here's solomon speaking verse 11
[1:10:20] my son despise not the chastening of the
[1:10:23] lord
[1:10:24] neither be weary of his correction
[1:10:27] or
[1:10:28] reproof the word reproof or despise not
[1:10:34] despise not either by making light of it
[1:10:36] not taking it seriously not putting any
[1:10:38] weight in it
[1:10:40] or not being duly affected with it you
[1:10:43] got to a point where it doesn't bother
[1:10:44] you anymore
[1:10:46] you can walk right through it
[1:10:48] and say oh
[1:10:50] he says
[1:10:52] more by accounting it as a un as an
[1:10:54] unnecessary thing and look at today's
[1:10:56] world
[1:10:59] the people who fill the law is for those
[1:11:02] others not me
[1:11:05] i i encountered a homeowner that way
[1:11:11] i did my best not to laugh but i thought
[1:11:13] it was funny
[1:11:15] i went to this home on a retired
[1:11:17] gentleman and
[1:11:18] he wanted some things done repaired
[1:11:21] replaced that were not our fault
[1:11:24] and i explained to him i do and he got
[1:11:25] very upset
[1:11:27] and he started telling me how i should
[1:11:29] do my work and what i should do and
[1:11:32] you know got to be
[1:11:34] let me just say you got to be nice to
[1:11:36] them you can't
[1:11:37] you got to act like you're real happy in
[1:11:39] front of them even though you might be
[1:11:41] burning up inside
[1:11:43] and he began to say things and i began
[1:11:46] to explain to him
[1:11:48] and i just said you know sir there are
[1:11:50] certain parameters that we work through
[1:11:52] and everything and these this was his
[1:11:54] answer to me he said
[1:11:56] a person of less intelligence needs
[1:11:59] parameters
[1:12:02] ah that was the nicest way to call me
[1:12:04] dumb
[1:12:07] it really is kind of what he said you're
[1:12:08] not smart enough to do this you know
[1:12:13] by that time i actually thought it was
[1:12:14] funny
[1:12:16] and i was doing my best not to laugh
[1:12:19] because then he went on and criticized
[1:12:21] his neighbors
[1:12:23] they were grading the land across the
[1:12:24] street for the next phase and he was
[1:12:26] telling me how those operators on those
[1:12:28] equipment didn't even know how to use it
[1:12:31] and i realized where the problem was
[1:12:34] his wife was back up in the corner over
[1:12:36] there just standing by the door and
[1:12:37] never said a word
[1:12:39] because i don't think she wanted to get
[1:12:41] something told to her also
[1:12:44] but when you realize that if your heart
[1:12:47] is not right you can get yourself in
[1:12:48] that same attitude
[1:12:52] and you don't want reproof you don't
[1:12:54] want correction you don't need it
[1:12:58] either by making light of it or not
[1:13:00] being duly affected by it or about by
[1:13:03] accounting it as an unnecessary thing
[1:13:06] but rather esteem it a privilege and a
[1:13:09] favor from god
[1:13:12] that he would be mindful enough of me
[1:13:14] and care enough of me that he would say
[1:13:16] hey aaron i need your attention
[1:13:19] i need your attention you're about to
[1:13:22] get yourself into some trouble here
[1:13:24] and i'm going to get you out of it if
[1:13:26] you listen
[1:13:28] don't not getting weary
[1:13:30] my son defies not the chastening the
[1:13:33] discipline instruction of the lord
[1:13:34] neither be weary of his correction
[1:13:37] reproof
[1:13:38] neither think it a tedious or hard
[1:13:40] but endure it with patientness patience
[1:13:44] and cheerfulness
[1:13:46] lord i love it when you correct me
[1:13:52] easy words to say but hard to keep that
[1:13:53] attitude
[1:13:55] but lord let me yell let me surrender
[1:13:58] let me say yes lord whatever it might be
[1:14:03] the difference between reproof and
[1:14:05] correction
[1:14:07] both are related to errors or mistakes
[1:14:10] and their consequences
[1:14:12] when you make a mistake or an error
[1:14:14] there's a consequence with it
[1:14:17] um
[1:14:18] in in in working in the shop that i did
[1:14:21] when we we got our first job in acrylics
[1:14:25] and
[1:14:26] the other guy who had seniority over me
[1:14:27] did not like the plastics and the smells
[1:14:29] and the glues so
[1:14:30] they let me do it and which i ended up
[1:14:32] doing it for about 12 years
[1:14:35] and
[1:14:36] they've they the the boss went out he
[1:14:38] got the um the training and all and then
[1:14:41] we came under his certification as long
[1:14:43] as we were working under them
[1:14:46] so they gave it to me
[1:14:47] and they gave me my first job and and it
[1:14:49] was an expensive product
[1:14:52] where count regular laminate countertops
[1:14:54] were about 15 a foot this was like 50 a
[1:14:57] foot
[1:14:58] and in the early 80s that was a lot of
[1:15:01] money
[1:15:02] and so i built it and he's watching me
[1:15:05] and we build it and get the whole job
[1:15:06] takes about two days to get it done
[1:15:08] and he comes in to do the final check on
[1:15:11] it and he read the thing
[1:15:13] and he goes did you see this right here
[1:15:15] where it said the color i said yeah he
[1:15:17] goes well why did you build it in the
[1:15:18] wrong color
[1:15:20] after two days of work i built the whole
[1:15:22] job in the wrong color
[1:15:24] because i didn't read through the whole
[1:15:26] thing didn't double check it
[1:15:28] so there was consequences
[1:15:31] a lot of time
[1:15:32] a lot of money and the delay of the job
[1:15:36] so after that you learn to read
[1:15:38] everything twice
[1:15:39] you rent then double check everything i
[1:15:41] would tell the guys as i would train
[1:15:42] them double check all my numbers
[1:15:45] i could have flipped a number
[1:15:46] ten minutes of checking and anything
[1:15:48] could save us two days of labor
[1:15:51] there are consequences
[1:15:54] jesus
[1:15:55] reproof
[1:15:56] refers to expression of blame or
[1:15:59] disapproval
[1:16:01] correction refers to the action process
[1:16:04] of the action of fixing it
[1:16:08] so god will give you some reproof
[1:16:11] but he won't leave you there
[1:16:13] he'll give you the action to correct it
[1:16:17] and that's a god rich in mercy
[1:16:20] yes you did make a mistake yes you did
[1:16:23] wrong but i'll show you how you can get
[1:16:26] right
[1:16:29] and this is what solomon is saying my
[1:16:31] son he says
[1:16:33] despise not
[1:16:35] the chasing of the lord
[1:16:37] neither be weary of his correction
[1:16:41] i don't want to find out at the end that
[1:16:43] i was wrong
[1:16:44] when it's too late
[1:16:53] the key
[1:16:54] difference
[1:16:55] between reproof and correction
[1:16:59] one is an action
[1:17:00] the other one is just words
[1:17:04] for whom the lord loveth he correcteth
[1:17:08] even as a father
[1:17:10] the son in whom he delighteth for whom
[1:17:12] the lord loveth he correcteth so when
[1:17:16] god speaks to you whether it's through
[1:17:18] the ministering of the word
[1:17:19] through reading the scriptures through
[1:17:21] hearing a message
[1:17:23] to someone
[1:17:24] however it is
[1:17:26] say lord thank you
[1:17:28] because you're mindful of me you care
[1:17:30] for me
[1:17:35] happy is a man that findeth wisdom
[1:17:38] and the man that gideth understanding
[1:17:42] happy
[1:17:43] there's a joy there's a peace and
[1:17:45] happiness
[1:17:47] there's something about being happy that
[1:17:49] transcends a lot of the trouble that's
[1:17:50] going on
[1:17:52] when you're in a happy state and it
[1:17:54] doesn't mean a drug effect to stay or a
[1:17:56] drink affected it means there's a peace
[1:17:58] of god in your life
[1:18:00] there's something beyond a natural
[1:18:02] stimulation
[1:18:03] it's god alive in you he says
[1:18:06] happy is a man that finds his wisdom and
[1:18:09] the man that gideth understanding or
[1:18:11] another word for that gets the
[1:18:12] revelation of it
[1:18:14] it becomes something real something he
[1:18:16] can live
[1:18:18] or she can live
[1:18:19] it's not just a law that i have to try
[1:18:21] to keep but god in me can live it
[1:18:26] when you find that place
[1:18:32] brother branham in the message shalom
[1:18:40] is what i'd like to get to today
[1:18:45] like paul said hallelujah he had an
[1:18:47] infirmity something was bothering him
[1:18:50] the devil would buffet him blow after
[1:18:53] blow and he consulted the lord three
[1:18:55] times to take it away from him said i
[1:18:58] don't want this lord
[1:19:00] take it away from me
[1:19:02] and then one night the lord spoke to him
[1:19:04] and said paul my grace is sufficient
[1:19:11] he said then all glory in my infirmity
[1:19:15] i'll glory in it i know you're the
[1:19:17] healer
[1:19:18] i've seen you heal the sick
[1:19:20] raise the dead and cast out devil
[1:19:23] devils open the eyes of the blind
[1:19:26] but if i've consulted you and you tell
[1:19:29] me it's your grace is sufficient that
[1:19:31] your grace is sufficient
[1:19:33] then this devil that bothers me is is
[1:19:36] the growing pains of your grace
[1:19:40] then i'll glory in my infirmities why
[1:19:44] if
[1:19:45] if les i lest i get exalted above the
[1:19:48] abundance of revelation
[1:19:53] and and if you're not careful in this
[1:19:55] message there are people that are so
[1:19:57] exalted in their revelation
[1:20:00] so exalted in their revelation they
[1:20:02] cannot be corrected
[1:20:04] they cannot you cannot talk to them you
[1:20:06] cannot have anything to do with them
[1:20:08] because they are so right
[1:20:10] and paul realized that
[1:20:13] he says all glory in my infirmities
[1:20:17] that doesn't mean i'm happy to be in
[1:20:19] pain but i'll understand that god is
[1:20:21] going to get glory out of this
[1:20:24] i'm a man an insufficient man i don't
[1:20:26] have the strength i have my problems but
[1:20:28] yet god is going to be
[1:20:31] glorified in this
[1:20:34] so let's look at the scripture here
[1:20:38] ii corinthians 12
[1:20:40] 8-10
[1:20:50] for this thing i besought the lord
[1:20:52] thrice that it might depart from me
[1:20:55] three times i went to the lord and said
[1:20:57] i could be a much better servant of
[1:21:00] yours lord
[1:21:01] i could get a whole lot more done for
[1:21:04] you
[1:21:04] i'd be so much more effective if you
[1:21:07] would take this infirmity this problem
[1:21:10] this sickness this weakness whatever it
[1:21:12] is in my life i could be a much better
[1:21:15] servant for you lord
[1:21:18] i'd have more energy i'd have more
[1:21:20] strength i'd have more understanding
[1:21:22] i would just be a better person for you
[1:21:24] lord
[1:21:25] if you would do this
[1:21:26] and the lord's saying yeah and i can see
[1:21:29] already you got a problem with it
[1:21:32] you're already beginning to exalt
[1:21:33] yourself
[1:21:36] but paul is not thinking he's doing that
[1:21:39] paul is looking at it in the natural
[1:21:40] saying i could be much better if i
[1:21:43] didn't have these problems
[1:21:47] and then paul says and he said unto me
[1:21:50] my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:21:54] my grace
[1:21:56] the unmerited favor that which you did
[1:21:59] nothing to deserve
[1:22:01] but i choose to give it to you
[1:22:05] his grace his forgiveness his love his
[1:22:08] mercy all under grace
[1:22:12] it's sufficient it's more than enough
[1:22:15] it'll get you through it
[1:22:17] and my word will be fulfilled
[1:22:20] and that which i sent you to do will get
[1:22:22] done
[1:22:24] he says
[1:22:25] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:22:28] weakness
[1:22:30] complete whole it's demonstrated to its
[1:22:32] fullness
[1:22:34] lord that had to be you because there's
[1:22:38] no way i could do that
[1:22:41] paul had to come to that understanding
[1:22:44] i've said this before
[1:22:46] the two messengers paul being the first
[1:22:49] messenger to the first stage and brother
[1:22:51] branham being the messenger to the
[1:22:53] second age to the last age i'm sorry
[1:22:56] paul who had to struggle with education
[1:23:01] he even says if you want to show your
[1:23:04] qualifications let me show you mine
[1:23:07] i was born this way i studied under the
[1:23:10] best i did this i did that
[1:23:14] and brother branham on this side he said
[1:23:15] obviously he goes i don't have the
[1:23:17] education quite often as you're reading
[1:23:19] me i i can't even pronounce the words he
[1:23:21] struggled with the fact that he did not
[1:23:23] have the education and to me god was
[1:23:25] showing i can use that one as much as i
[1:23:26] can use this one
[1:23:30] the six age messenger john wesley an
[1:23:33] intelligent man an eloquent man
[1:23:36] god used him
[1:23:38] brother branham a man with very little
[1:23:40] education and god used him
[1:23:43] he's telling paul this
[1:23:45] my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:23:48] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:23:51] weakness
[1:23:52] when i can realize lord that was you
[1:23:56] because i had no strength to do it on my
[1:23:58] own
[1:23:58] no ability to do it on my own
[1:24:00] i would have failed i was going the
[1:24:03] wrong direction i thought i would do it
[1:24:05] this way and you took it around and did
[1:24:06] it this way
[1:24:08] to god be the glory
[1:24:10] so then paul says most gladly therefore
[1:24:12] will i glory in my infirmities
[1:24:14] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:24:17] me
[1:24:18] therefore i take pleasure in my
[1:24:20] infirmities
[1:24:22] in reproaches in necessities in
[1:24:24] persecutions in distresses for christ's
[1:24:27] sake for when i am weak then i am strong
[1:24:32] oh those are two opposites when i'm weak
[1:24:35] i'm strong
[1:24:37] when i can't lift this up i gotta depend
[1:24:39] on him
[1:24:41] and i get myself out of the way and
[1:24:44] that's the hardest part sometimes
[1:24:45] getting yourself out of the way
[1:24:48] this is what paul is saying here
[1:24:52] the message shalom and
[1:24:57] brother branham
[1:24:58] speaks here in shalom
[1:25:03] paul said hallelujah he had an infirmity
[1:25:07] something was bothering him
[1:25:09] the devil the devil would buff and
[1:25:11] buffet him
[1:25:12] blow after blow and he consulted the
[1:25:15] lord three times to take it away from
[1:25:17] him
[1:25:18] i don't know i don't want this lord take
[1:25:20] it away from me
[1:25:22] and then one night the lord spoke to him
[1:25:24] in
[1:25:24] paul and said my grace is sufficient
[1:25:28] he said then i'll glory in my infirmity
[1:25:31] when i am weak he's made strong
[1:25:34] when i can't he will
[1:25:37] but when i can he can't because i don't
[1:25:40] get him
[1:25:41] lord i can handle this by myself
[1:25:44] i've got this figured out
[1:25:46] i know that i can handle let me go and
[1:25:48] sometimes god says go
[1:25:52] and then he sits down he says
[1:25:54] hey angels come on let's watch this for
[1:25:56] a little while
[1:25:57] watch this no
[1:25:59] he's got his eye over you
[1:26:02] he's caring for you
[1:26:03] he knows
[1:26:04] he's been there already
[1:26:06] he's walked this path before he was
[1:26:08] tempted he was tried
[1:26:11] he didn't give in to it
[1:26:13] but he was tempted he knows the feeling
[1:26:15] of temptation
[1:26:16] he knows the pull the desire because he
[1:26:19] wore flesh
[1:26:21] he bathed himself so he could understand
[1:26:25] or else he wouldn't know what you're
[1:26:26] asking him about he wouldn't understand
[1:26:28] it
[1:26:30] it would be like going and talking to
[1:26:32] your cat
[1:26:33] and telling your cat how terrible you
[1:26:35] feel
[1:26:36] and the cat just walks away
[1:26:40] no understanding it's not human
[1:26:43] but he
[1:26:44] took flesh upon himself
[1:26:47] he hurt
[1:26:49] if he cut himself he bled if he tripped
[1:26:51] it hurt when he hit his knee
[1:26:53] when he laid down and he was tired his
[1:26:56] body ate
[1:26:58] as hard as it is to imagine a god and
[1:27:00] flesh could be but he did he took it
[1:27:02] upon himself
[1:27:04] so he could be touched by the feeling of
[1:27:06] mine and year's infirmities
[1:27:09] and paul realizes when i'm weak
[1:27:12] he's made strong
[1:27:13] because he's the one that begins to work
[1:27:16] this out paul on his way and brother
[1:27:19] lyle covered it well
[1:27:21] on his way
[1:27:22] self-righteous
[1:27:24] doing what he thought was a perfect will
[1:27:26] of god i'm going to destroy these
[1:27:29] christians
[1:27:31] when we've had this truth the law of
[1:27:33] moses that god established from the
[1:27:35] beginning and they're saying that god is
[1:27:38] in a man today
[1:27:42] i'm going to put a stop to this
[1:27:45] brother lyle covered that very well on
[1:27:47] wednesday night through the scriptures
[1:27:50] but god rich in mercy
[1:27:53] said oh paul you're going to have to
[1:27:54] come to the place
[1:27:56] where you're going to glory in your
[1:27:58] infirmities
[1:27:59] that had to be god this was not paul
[1:28:02] because i could not do this
[1:28:07] paul had to live
[1:28:09] with the thought
[1:28:10] that he committed christians to death
[1:28:16] i don't know
[1:28:18] you know i don't know what you've been
[1:28:20] through i don't know what you've been
[1:28:21] through in your life
[1:28:24] but if you've done something that you
[1:28:25] can't go and do
[1:28:29] and it troubles you the rest of your
[1:28:30] life you wish you could go fix it
[1:28:33] but you can't
[1:28:36] you know you see in the news when a
[1:28:38] drunk person a person high on drugs or
[1:28:40] something they get an accident and
[1:28:41] people are killed
[1:28:43] and the remorse the feeling that you'll
[1:28:46] see the picture of them they're crying
[1:28:48] they can't undo it
[1:28:51] the remorse and it's too late now
[1:28:53] how do you fix it
[1:28:57] paul had to be sitting there thinking
[1:29:01] i had them put to death
[1:29:03] for this very god that i'm certain this
[1:29:05] very christian life this very way that
[1:29:07] i'm serving god i had people put to
[1:29:10] death for that
[1:29:13] he said i'm going to glory in my efforts
[1:29:15] god had a reason for it
[1:29:22] now
[1:29:23] brother bran i'm in a message called i
[1:29:25] know
[1:29:28] it's a fairly long quote
[1:29:33] a few days ago when i come out of the
[1:29:35] most prettiest and most gorgeous place
[1:29:37] that i ever saw in my life
[1:29:39] is a great building of our brother oral
[1:29:41] roberts
[1:29:43] when i seen that solid marble and not a
[1:29:45] window in it nowhere
[1:29:47] but how it was fixed
[1:29:50] i've been to hollywood and i've seen
[1:29:51] things kings palaces and i've
[1:29:54] been everywhere
[1:29:57] that could be
[1:30:01] and i've been everywhere that could be
[1:30:02] hardly around the world and all that
[1:30:04] swanky swanky sorry lovely places in the
[1:30:08] home
[1:30:09] but i never seen anything any place to
[1:30:11] compare with it nowhere at all
[1:30:15] how the little aluminum wires weave the
[1:30:17] inside together and oh i've never seen
[1:30:19] anything so gorgeous in all my life
[1:30:23] that's his descriptions those are his
[1:30:24] words
[1:30:25] when i walked through there and i took
[1:30:27] and it took my hands and rubbed those
[1:30:28] pole pilasters and the great granite
[1:30:31] all the form of the trinity of the
[1:30:33] father son and holy ghost the carmens in
[1:30:35] it all those things
[1:30:37] had just come from brother tommy osborne
[1:30:39] and seen his great mighty work there for
[1:30:41] the lord
[1:30:42] i stood on the outside looked back at
[1:30:45] that building thought god surely i have
[1:30:48] become a hypocrite
[1:30:51] surely i have become an outcast
[1:30:52] somewhere
[1:30:54] for these men's ministries come off a
[1:30:56] mine
[1:30:57] and i thought what maybe i'm so
[1:30:59] untrusted lord that you couldn't trust
[1:31:01] me with anything like that even the
[1:31:03] little few dollars
[1:31:05] that you let me pay for the campaigns
[1:31:07] and things now they're trying to send me
[1:31:09] to the penitentiary for it and why am i
[1:31:12] such a hypocrite or why am i such an
[1:31:14] untrusted person
[1:31:17] here's brother branham saying look what
[1:31:18] they got
[1:31:21] and obviously
[1:31:22] i didn't deserve it i'm not worthy of it
[1:31:25] i'm no good for it and he begins to look
[1:31:26] at himself that way
[1:31:29] he's just being honest with his words
[1:31:30] here
[1:31:33] the beauty and and and the the the
[1:31:35] vastness of it all
[1:31:37] and it's just amazing to him
[1:31:42] he says
[1:31:43] i was on the ash sheep as job was of old
[1:31:46] when i stood outside there
[1:31:48] with just couldn't hardly get my breath
[1:31:50] from such a majesty that a poor boy born
[1:31:53] in a dugout a pentecostal could do and
[1:31:55] bring that into that great mammoth
[1:31:57] building and i thought oh god maybe i am
[1:32:00] not worthy
[1:32:03] but watch this and then a little voice
[1:32:05] came down through those quarters and
[1:32:06] said
[1:32:07] but i am your portion
[1:32:12] stop for a little bit here's brother ben
[1:32:14] i'm walking through this place
[1:32:16] a manus of god like people had never
[1:32:18] seen before
[1:32:20] it had been amazing what god was doing
[1:32:22] and he said their ministries came from
[1:32:24] mine people who saw what was god doing
[1:32:26] and say lord if you can do that with him
[1:32:27] you can do it with me and god allowed
[1:32:28] that to be let this word of god get out
[1:32:31] all over the world
[1:32:33] but brethren random is walking through
[1:32:35] it he's amazed by the beauty of it and
[1:32:37] all
[1:32:38] and he says obviously god you didn't
[1:32:40] trust me
[1:32:43] you wouldn't give me such a thing i
[1:32:44] couldn't handle it
[1:32:46] here listen to paul again saying lord if
[1:32:49] you'll do this for me i'll be better at
[1:32:52] that
[1:32:53] here's brother branham doing the exact
[1:32:55] same thing
[1:32:57] god answers paul and says
[1:33:00] my grace is sufficient for you paul
[1:33:05] and here god tells brother branham i am
[1:33:09] your portion
[1:33:14] he says
[1:33:17] so then i thought oh lord god oh let
[1:33:20] that just let that
[1:33:22] let that stay that way then lord
[1:33:25] because i wouldn't have the intelligence
[1:33:27] to carry in a great word like that for
[1:33:29] you and i'm i'm an illiterate person but
[1:33:31] as long as you're my portion i am yours
[1:33:34] and you will lead me i could not lead
[1:33:37] myself but o lord lead me
[1:33:43] both of them come to the same place
[1:33:48] paul says therefore i will glory in my
[1:33:50] infirmities
[1:33:52] in my weaknesses in my inability and
[1:33:55] i'll let god have his way and he said as
[1:33:58] long as i can stay like this and let you
[1:34:01] be my portion he said then the work can
[1:34:03] get done
[1:34:05] both messengers
[1:34:07] and god says i am your person
[1:34:10] my grace is sufficient for you
[1:34:15] grace unmerited favor
[1:34:17] nothing you did to deserve it
[1:34:19] nothing you could earn it by
[1:34:24] 500 hours of prayer
[1:34:26] reading all the messages
[1:34:28] going to every campaign every every uh
[1:34:31] uh
[1:34:33] church that has their their uh services
[1:34:36] and fellowship and all not missing a
[1:34:37] single one if you're basing it on that
[1:34:40] you've deserved nothing
[1:34:43] because then it becomes works
[1:34:46] but if you have him and he's that
[1:34:49] portion in you
[1:34:52] then it's his grace in your life
[1:34:56] and he begins to work his life out
[1:34:58] through your life direction
[1:35:01] taking care of
[1:35:03] leading you guiding you where sometimes
[1:35:05] you say my how did i accident it must
[1:35:07] have been by accident then i turned the
[1:35:09] wrong way here and god says no no that's
[1:35:11] not an accident there's a purpose for
[1:35:13] that there's a reason as to why
[1:35:16] the different testimonies that we've
[1:35:18] heard from behind this pulpit over the
[1:35:19] years how what seemed like how could
[1:35:22] that have happened but god had a purpose
[1:35:23] for it in life
[1:35:26] and because of that
[1:35:27] some of us are here today
[1:35:29] because somebody
[1:35:31] quote unquote took the wrong turn
[1:35:34] but there were you
[1:35:36] and god knew it
[1:35:40] i'll ask this question this way how many
[1:35:42] of you were so holy and so righteous and
[1:35:44] so perfect that god had to come to you
[1:35:49] that's what i thought none of us
[1:35:52] how many know
[1:35:53] that god had to reach out to where you
[1:35:55] are and get your life and bring it back
[1:35:59] that's why he gives the story of the
[1:36:00] prodigal son
[1:36:03] a man who had everything a son
[1:36:07] i said give me my inheritance that i may
[1:36:09] go do what i want to do
[1:36:11] and he went
[1:36:14] and it didn't take long to make a mess
[1:36:15] of his life
[1:36:18] and one day he comes too
[1:36:21] and for each one of us there was a time
[1:36:23] in our lives that we came to and
[1:36:24] realized
[1:36:26] i'm not where i want to be
[1:36:28] this is not the life i want to live
[1:36:31] but a god rich in mercy
[1:36:34] set somebody down your way
[1:36:36] say something down your way or caused a
[1:36:38] reason to why whatever it was maybe flat
[1:36:41] on your back somewhere
[1:36:42] maybe a co-worker who knows however it
[1:36:45] wasn't god
[1:36:46] allowed it to be
[1:36:48] to reach out and touch your life
[1:36:50] and he said that's what it's been all
[1:36:53] along
[1:36:54] not because i was good not because i
[1:36:57] deserved this not because god owed it to
[1:36:59] me but a god rich in mercy reached out
[1:37:02] to my life
[1:37:03] and got a hold of me
[1:37:07] you know it and it's amazing
[1:37:10] how many people
[1:37:12] in today's world
[1:37:14] are looking for a god like that and
[1:37:15] can't find them
[1:37:19] because they've just been given man's
[1:37:20] religion
[1:37:23] i've worked with some
[1:37:27] and and i'm not putting any religion
[1:37:28] down in any ways they're people they're
[1:37:30] human
[1:37:32] they need a god just like i needed a god
[1:37:36] they deserve a god as much as i deserve
[1:37:38] the god
[1:37:39] god didn't do it just because it was me
[1:37:41] god did for each one that would
[1:37:43] he said i would that none would perish
[1:37:46] but that all would come to life
[1:37:50] and hear some of their stories
[1:37:52] what they've done what they've had to do
[1:37:54] what they've had to try to accomplish
[1:37:56] and when they couldn't get it do it so
[1:37:58] disappointed
[1:38:00] because it didn't it didn't come out
[1:38:02] that way
[1:38:04] went to my co-workers funeral
[1:38:06] service
[1:38:08] a good man a good man one of the best um
[1:38:12] when i was was the the area manager and
[1:38:14] i had him working under me as my service
[1:38:17] tech one of the best guys ever worked he
[1:38:19] was an old gentleman
[1:38:20] he had good work habits just a good man
[1:38:23] did good work you know
[1:38:26] passed away and we went to his his
[1:38:27] memorial
[1:38:28] and the service it was a catholic church
[1:38:31] and on one side the priest around his
[1:38:33] cactus kept his
[1:38:36] casket not the cactus the casket
[1:38:39] he's the instance i'd never been when
[1:38:41] the incense and all and on one side he's
[1:38:43] talking about how safely my friend
[1:38:47] was in the hands of jesus
[1:38:49] and on the other side of it and he's
[1:38:51] doing the same thing he's asking for god
[1:38:53] to lift him out of purgatory
[1:38:57] and i'm thinking are these people not
[1:38:59] hearing what the priest is saying
[1:39:02] on one side he's saved on the other side
[1:39:04] he's still in purgatory
[1:39:08] but god rich in mercy
[1:39:12] the same god who said my grace is
[1:39:14] sufficient to paul
[1:39:16] and told brother branham i am your
[1:39:18] portion
[1:39:20] it's the same one that came to me and
[1:39:21] said my grace is sufficient for you
[1:39:24] i am your portion
[1:39:27] took me beyond
[1:39:28] that and brought me to
[1:39:30] the real word of god the unveiled word
[1:39:33] of god
[1:39:34] to what he really is
[1:39:36] and it's not something mysterious
[1:39:38] it's not something so great you can't
[1:39:40] understand but by faith you can receive
[1:39:42] it and put it to action
[1:39:45] a god rich in mercy
[1:39:47] a god of grace
[1:39:50] paul said hallelujah he had an infirmity
[1:39:54] and i will glory in my infirmity
[1:39:57] therefore his strength is made known
[1:40:01] you say i'm weak i'm tired
[1:40:04] i've got problems
[1:40:06] young man young lady especially coming
[1:40:08] through your teenage years you go
[1:40:10] through the struggles you go through the
[1:40:11] hard times we've all been there
[1:40:14] and because sin has really come out i
[1:40:17] would say they're going through a harder
[1:40:18] time than some of us had to go through
[1:40:21] but his grace is still sufficient
[1:40:25] it's not any weaker it's not any less
[1:40:26] and it's more today as it needs to be
[1:40:29] met
[1:40:30] whoever you are wherever you are his
[1:40:33] grace is sufficient for you
[1:40:36] cast all your cares upon
[1:40:40] he cares for you
[1:40:42] brother peter if you would come back up
[1:40:45] musicians
[1:40:49] his grace is sufficient
[1:40:52] more than enough
[1:40:54] whatever it's needed
[1:40:57] his shed blood
[1:40:59] puts sin through his shed blood it
[1:41:01] confessed sin it's clean it no longer
[1:41:03] exists
[1:41:05] it's not held against you
[1:41:08] cleanse my heart oh god
[1:41:12] take that that that feeling of i'm lost
[1:41:14] i mean
[1:41:15] give me a peace over
[1:41:17] give me a satisfaction over it it's
[1:41:20] borious
[1:41:23] lord your your prophet brother branham
[1:41:25] preach a message called
[1:41:26] shalom
[1:41:28] peace
[1:41:29] rest
[1:41:31] not in our own abilities
[1:41:34] not because we're good enough
[1:41:37] not x amount of works and x amount of
[1:41:39] quotes and x amount of praying could
[1:41:40] cover this but rather your grace is
[1:41:42] sufficient
[1:41:44] your unmerited favorite heart
[1:41:47] how could we what what would be the
[1:41:49] measure to merit it
[1:41:53] who would we compare ourselves to who
[1:41:54] would be the determining one
[1:41:57] who would set the level in the mark
[1:42:01] we look in the natural life of humans
[1:42:03] lord especially in sports or in great
[1:42:05] businesses or those that are very
[1:42:08] wealthy
[1:42:11] at one time the thought was a million
[1:42:13] dollars of a million seems so much
[1:42:15] [Music]
[1:42:17] and today lord in today's world
[1:42:20] a million is just another number
[1:42:23] we're talking into the billions now
[1:42:27] to be the greatest in sports and each
[1:42:29] one trying to outdo the next and being
[1:42:32] break this record and go to this
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:37] when would it be enough
[1:42:40] but you said my grace is sufficient
[1:42:44] it always has been sufficient it will
[1:42:46] always be sufficient
[1:42:49] therefore let us glory in the fact that
[1:42:51] we are not able
[1:42:53] we love and serve a living god who is
[1:42:56] more able
[1:42:57] more than able today lord
