pentecost sunday the holy spirit fell that that sermon that we read in acts 2 that's so powerful that there was such a crowd gathered there that morning and it was arranged because the faithful were told that they had to gather in jerusalem three times a year and shavuot what we call pentecost was one of those times to set the stage so that peter could give that sermon so that 5 000 people could be baptized the church could be born and we're so grateful that we're living in this day in this anniversary of that very moment when the holy spirit fell those tongues of fire were over each one in that room that day and and lord open our eyes that we can see the tongues of fire over each one that's here tonight and we're praying for the moving of his spirit and we're depending on that and we believe that that's going to happen as our brother joe adams comes and shares what's on his heart let's go to the lord in prayer lord jesus we're so grateful that we can be gathered today on this day

holy ghost is ours he sent it for us so that we can overcome in this wicked generation so thankful for that let's just go to him in prayer this evening father we thank you for your presence lord we thank you lord that we can sing the songs of zion this evening and we'll just worship you here in spirit and in truth this evening father we just look forward to what you would have in store for the young people god we just pray you'll know on our lips to speak the words that would just encourage them lord just in the back praying and just talking to you about the things lord as a young person we all hear once were father we know those struggles we know the difficulties lord that a young person faced and lord we're just asking that you would speak intimately directly lord to their needs this evening so we just want to yield ourselves to you lord this evening for whatever time you want to speak father we just want to have you let you have the preeminence in this service not only in the service but in our hearts and our lives lord and we just want to say thank you father for the opportunity it's in jesus name amen if you have your bibles you can turn to romans 9 and as you're turning there just want to read a portion of scripture here in john but i want you to turn to romans 9. this is john 21 and verse 15. it says so when they had done jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonah loveth thou me more than these he saith unto him yea lord knowest thou that i love thee and he saith unto him feed my lambs and in verse 16 and he said to him again the second time son of jonas our simon son of jonas loveth thou me and he said unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee and he saith unto him feed my sheep so we understand that preaching of the gospel is not only feeding the sheep but it's also feeding the lambs and as i was preparing this weekend or this past week we just got in from newfoundland canada and knew it knowing that we would have a week home or a sunday home and then we'd be out here and just praying lord give us the direction for the services the lord spoke to me earlier this week said won't you take sunday evening and speak to the young people and so i was in the back as uh earlier this morning and i asked brother aaron i said when's the last time that there was a service dedicated to the young young people of tucson tabernacle he said well it's it's been quite a long time i said well that's fine because god laid it on my heart to do this and i understand that you know uh his daughter i think his sister elizabeth had mentioned to him and he was supposed to reach out to me to see if i would do it but see god's working on both the end so god knew this weekend would be here he knew exactly what needed to be said and how it needed to be said so it should let us know even in where we are right now that god is mindful of you he's mindful of the church and not only that he's mindful of your young people so god is concerned god is and he is here i believe tonight just to speak something i'm not sure how long i'll hold you i promise you it won't be two or three hours y'all can size our relief i know there's cakes in there we're going to sample after service and i'm a cake man i'm ready we can say amen dismiss let's go eat cake and had service right but we're going to give you some word just a little bit romans 9 and verse 1 says i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continuous sorrow in my heart for i could wish that myself were a curse from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises for who are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god bless forever amen but not all not as though the world the word of god hath taken none effect for they that are not all israel which are israel neither because they are seated abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called this or that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for seed for this is a word of promise at that time will i come and sarah shall have a son and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac for the children yet the children being not born yet born neither having done good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but a hymn that calleth god bless you you can have your seats this evening i just want to take a few minutes this evening just to kind of speak to the young people where's the young people at raise your hand young people all right everybody should have their hands raised right we're all young people but we're actually going to be directing the service tonight to those that are relatively 24 and under and i want to speak to you on you have a purpose if you have a purpose this word purpose here is a reason for which something exists or is done the reason why something is made or reason why something is used many times if we're all honest with ourselves and you adults you can reminisce back when you was a child when you was going through puberty and you was going through your teenage years and those adolescent years and there's been a lot of times you wondered what is my purpose have y'all ever wondered that or maybe here in tucson you exactly know what god has for you what is my purpose or do i even have a purpose you know and sometimes we think just because our life in our life we go through trials and as a young person you know there's that stage where you're trying to fit into this group or you're trying to be accepted and you just kind of you're kind of backwards you're kind of awkward right i got a couple of honest people here this this evening hey man yeah i'll take that brother whoever said that i'm not gonna call your name i know who you were but we find that fitting in sometimes is so awkward you know you want to be in the clique right come on church we all want to be accepted and yet we find sometimes we have struggle with our acceptance and our purpose what does god have me to do this and god has me to do that and i've dealt in a lot of prayer lines with young people and one of the common themes in a youth service or a a prayer line that you deal with young people is brother joe i just want to know what my purpose is and that would br that that very question is what brings me to this thought today because as i was preparing for canada i had completely a different direction i was going to go and one night god said i want you to speak you have a purpose and that night i had to get home get in there and i preached on a saturday night and i knew i was going to have or it was actually preached on sunday and we were out tour in newfoundland canada if you've never been there go it's beautiful but on tuesday night the lord dropped it in my heart you're gonna speak this so i was up till midnight preparing to speak to them on wednesday night to the young people and in that we find that we all struggle at certain times in our life well what is my purpose what has god called me to do what is my purpose i'm not worried about brother aaron's purpose he that's for him to figure out but tonight what about me what about my christian what about my journey in life what about my future what about my career what about these aspects of my life god what is my purpose what is my reason for being why am i in existence sometimes we think well let's make a lot of money i remember as a young kid i was very y'all probably wouldn't recognize but i'm very motivated i'm i'm very driven i got a lot of drive i don't have to be slapped them and beating the head i'm prodded and whooped because i'm getting up every day at 6 30 i'm getting life started i'm not going to wait and i've been like that all my life and my wife will tell you sometimes you got to put a bridle in my mouth and pull the reins back because i'm moving ahead but in my years before i was saved as a as a non-believer as a if we want to call it a center i was determined i was going to make something out of my life i grew up very poor and i'm just going to share some testimony and just share my heart with you because you have a purpose young people no matter what kind of background you come from what kind of life you come from you have a purpose for god placing you here god placing you in this age god placing you in this state and god placing you in this church you have a purpose and i recall as a young person my parents were divorced when i was two years old and from that time you know as a young boy you want your dad and then you struggle and you fight and dad's not there he's in the picture one day and he's out of the picture the next and it's all this topsy-turvy and your life is all a mess and you watch your parents see in a divorce it's not so much the parents that hurt it's the children that hurt and i had a lot of built up animosity toward my parents as a even as a teenager because the road that they were taking us down i looked at it and i couldn't have friends over because my parents did drugs and so because they did drugs i was embarrassed of the childhood i had i was embarrassed of my family i was embarrassed and it brought a lot of shame and it brought a lot of things in it made me question well what is your purpose and from that point i was determined my wife would testify i'm not like any of my siblings completely different because i used what the devil meant for evil and allowed it to motivate me to be successful now my success in my mind was i was going to be the first one and i was the first one in my family to ever go to college to graduate college and to get a real paying job you know we think well real paying job yeah sometimes a real paying job is a plus but i used that childhood all that hurt to motivate me and i was determined that i was going to be successful i was going to be a lawyer well that fell through because i realized when i got to school i ain't sticking this out i'm not peter peter he may be unassuming but he's very intelligent he's got he's cut out for it i'm just an accountant right i got to settle for second best and so i was determined i was gonna i was gonna do something in business because i kind of fell away from the law part and when i first my first day in college i never looked back i said i'm going to do this i'm going to go and what made me decide i'm just giving y'all personal personal accounts now don't follow my example young people on this one so my first classes i had a finance class and an accounting class and i didn't know what i was going to do just yet but i said you know what whichever one i do better in that's what i'm going to major in well i squeaked by and got an a i got to a in both but i had a higher a in accounting than i did finance see i didn't know what my career or what my life was going to bring i'm just thinking well this sounds good right i made better obviously i'm better accounted than i am in finance so i chose that career but see god knew exactly where he was going to place me and god knew what degree that i needed that would suit the need so that god can use that because see i had a purpose now i didn't rightly know my purpose i thought well i'm just going to be a businessman i'm going to make something myself and this is before i got saved i was going to make all the money that i can and get all that i can and do everything that i can i wasn't worried about a wife i wasn't worried about these things i was worried about one thing and that's not being poor because we grew up poor my mom was a single single mother raising three kids working herself to death trying to raise three kids and it's very difficult as a single parent but yet and i struggle with what my purpose was and then i slanted that purpose to be career-minded career-minded career-minded career-minded i'm like this is the reason why i'm here i'm not going to be like my family i'm going to be the ones going to break that cycle i'm going to do this but when i got to i was about 21-22 i gave my heart to the lord and from that point on i told the lord then i said i will not let money dictate my future i will not let money dictate my future in church i've had countless offers through my career hundreds of thousands of dollars to go move and to get away from the church and to go to some other hospital somewhere else that offered 200 plus thousand dollars a year even before i decided to go full time but see you had to determine what is my purpose my purpose now is not to chase a dollar purpose now is to serve god and so each of you here you have a purpose and sometimes satan will use your past he will use your family dynamics he'll use those things that come against you to try to detour you if we would say or distract you from what your real purpose in life is so that's why we want to speak to you this evening on you have a purpose god has a reason for you being here and as we look back at the scripture it says for the children being not yet born not yet born neither having done good or evil they hadn't done good or evil nothing but the purpose of god according to election might stand not a works but at him that calleth and the word election here is the act of god's free will by which before the foundation of the world he decreed his blessings upon a certain person so god's purpose in your life is based on his election and his election is his decree that he places on you because of his own free will see god has to create his blessings on each of you here this evening in john 15 and verse 16 the bible says that you have not chosen me but i have chosen you what a consolation you know sometimes we think well i chose god i sought god i thought that when i was 22 i'm seeking god no i wasn't seeking god god taught me and so if god thought so much of me to seek me out when he could have sought anybody out then surely god won't throw me away and that's how we have to look at it now if you sought god out and yet you found favor with god there's be something in the back of your mind so well i did this i did this and then god can disregard you but when god seeks you out and god places you in his hand and god comes into your life and it's nothing that we have to do with it then surely god will not discard me because god has a purpose for doing what he's done in my life so we'd ask ourselves what is my purpose we look at the life of job and we look back and we think about my how could god use that situation for his prophet and we look in job 1 and verse 6 and it says now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also excuse me how to set my time or y'all got all that for free satan came also among them and the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou and satan asked the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and his skew is evil and satan answered the lord and said doeth job fear god for naught has not thou made a hedge about him about his house and about all that he has on every sign that thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substances increased in his land so satan is accusing god of blessing job and saying that's the only reason why job serves you but god was going to show otherwise because god said i got a purpose for job and just as i have a purpose for job i got a purpose for you and i got a purpose for everything that i allow you to go through he says now put for now satan is still continually speaking he says put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon him putting not forth thy hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord so here we find god asking satan have you carefully observed my servant job then he goes on to brag about job there's none like him in all the earth look at job he's perfect that word perfect means he's morally innocent he has integrity he's complete and the spirit the scripture says he's upright otherwise he's a righteous man he fears god he reverences god he excuse evil otherwise he departs from evil and satan decides that he has no confidence in human ability he says if you remove your hands off of job's life and let me come against job i will get him to curse you see satan did have confidence in what god has placed in job but see god had a purpose for allowing job to go through the trial that he went through and god has a purpose for each of us in the trials that we go through for the scripture says that we know that all things work together now sometimes it's hard for our finite minds to comprehend how is this working again god how is this benefiting me because we look at it from that aspect we heard the famous saying god loves a cheerful giver you're not out give god how many's ever heard that how many has ever said that and sometimes we think man we're just gonna give and give and give and thinking that we're gonna get it back in return but you know what god's return on the investment that you make by giving is not always a financial return see sometimes that return is your children sometimes that return is the salvation of a young person i was up in newfoundland canada and there was a young girl about 16 17 years old and she was ready to pack her bags and leave the house go out and just do whatever she was ready to quit the private school go back to public school leave her family the church was torn up about this because they seen this girl begin to pull back and pull back and regress and regress and i told my wife it was a saturday night i said god is gonna do something special tonight i said i don't know why but i feel something come over me that god's gonna do something special and that night there was a prayer line that formed and she stepped into that prayer line and the spirit of discern began to discern her heart and the spirit of god began to deal with her and deal with her and before she left that prayer line she was a different person because see because somebody paid in and the dividend wasn't a financial return the dividend was a soul of a young person and from saturday night to wednesday night when i preached wednesday night when you have a purpose her countenance changed i mean you'd have you'd have to been there and seen what i'm talking about you're talking about somebody who didn't want to be in the house of god somebody who was done packed their bags mentally then checked out on the message then checked out on god to somebody now who's the first one standing up worshiping god on a wednesday night and just the joy of the lord illuminating and displaying all over her face see i didn't have anything to do with that but the parents were paying in paying in when you bring them to church i know they kick and scream sometimes don't they do we have to go yes you're paying in because there's going to be a return on that investment because god has a purpose it has a purpose for every individual that's here tonight to bless you maybe not in the way you expect to be blessed but in the way that he wants to bless you and the prophet of god when we look at the life of job and we see his trials he lost his wealth he lost his children he had a nagging old wife man she hounded him every day come on honey just curse god just curse god get this over with thank god none of you have wives like that right brother dan that's better be amen that's exactly right you know if you didn't say amen we're gonna be in trouble after service i'll help you though we'll team up but he he lost all these things but see the thing that job wasn't privy to was the conversation that god had with satan regarding job's life have you considered my servant job see god know he placed him on earth for a purpose and satan declared well you've blessed him that's the only reason why he serves you but yet when god allows satan to strip everything away god still had a purpose and job was that purpose because job god was using job to tell satan no matter what you do you don't have enough that my true sons and daughters of god will not curse me they will bless my name they will honor my name they will assemble themselves together they will approach the throne of mercy and we find that the prophet of god will tell us that god purged job with the intent to bless job that's hard to fathom ain't it purged him put him through hell so that he can bless him in the end because god had a purpose and sometimes god allows the devil to do you and i the same way especially you young people you're at a very pivotal point in life right now in your youth you can be swayed this way and you can be swayed that way and you've got the world pulling on you just like job he had satan just there to ridicule to accuse you've done this and you're a secret sinner and the world is constantly pulling on you and it depermans which dog you feed the most whether you feed the black dog or whether you feed the white dog are you feeding in the message are you reading the word of god are you praying the way you should or are you giving in to the enticements of the world see satan knew where man's weakness is and god also knows that in that weakness he said i'll be strong so we all have our own weakness and your weakness may be different than my weakness and my weakness may be different than your weakness but yet god places those things in your life for a purpose so that he can get honor because even when the devil exploits your weakness god says i'm going to have complete honor and no matter what they're going through they will not curse me and i believe god has found young people in this hour with that same determination no matter what we see no matter what we face no matter what we endure i'm here to serve a purpose and many times we ask ourselves why why me being a christian with this would this be this way how many have ever asked that why me god i thought i was a christian i thought i was a believer i thought i was a son of god well lord you told me my name was joseph blessed and highly favored i don't feel blessed and i don't feel favored and we wonder sometimes and we ask that but yet the prophet of god will say god is the only one that has the right to say why why didn't you accept my way why didn't you accept my word why didn't you accept my prophet why didn't you accept this god's the only one that has the right to say why so we find now there's a law contrast working in our lives there's good and there's evil there's valleys in our mountaintops and so god allows you to have a mountaintop young person so that when you're in your valley you know that this is not a permanent place there's a mountaintop just ahead and it gives you the mountain top so you can be encouraged when you hit the valley that you're coming out of it it's not a permanent place see brother brown will tell us in the message i know he says now satan had touched job for a purpose to try him because he and god had a debate and satan's had a debate for you young people look i'll i won't give them a pastor now i'm just using that because we don't have a pastor right but i'll use it i'll get them to have no confidence in the ministry that comes through here they don't have really what's going on it's just all chaos you know there's no really no order here and and he starts working on your intellect and working on your mind so you don't have confidence and he's doing that to try to sway you but god has a purpose for everything that he permits and allows satan to do to our lives so god told satan i got a servant on the earth there's none like him whatever i say to him he will do it he's a perfect man a just man now how many wants that testimony he's a perfect man he's a just man we all want that testimony but we don't want to go through what job went through to get it there's the difference we want the accolades we want the prestige we want the praise man brother joe's a good man but you don't know the pain that brother joe's been through he don't know the disappointments that he's been through you don't understand that i don't have a relationship with many of my family members because i decided to put this message first and foremost in my life and they decided to go the way of the world and so there's always that barrier there's always that pain there's always that hurt but god has a purpose and he has a purpose for my life when we had our first child lauren i had to make my mind up and i had to stand and sometimes standing for the truth and standing for righteousness when it means standing against your family members it can be very tough it can be very difficult but god's called us to not compromise but to stand on the word of god because he's calling you for a purpose and young person you got to make your mind up i'm going to stand for what is right even now i'm going to start standing right now in this service i'm going to dedicate my heart to god i'm going to live for the lord because god has a purpose for me of being here and it's not just to breathe the oxygen it's not just to soak up the sunshine it's not to walk out there and be blasted by 100 degree heat no god placed you here for a purpose let me just say this nobody else can fulfill that purpose you know that there is a table set in heaven that's got every born-again believer's name on it there's a table there's a place you have a plate set at the table at the wedding supper and nobody can take your place and that should give you confidence i got a purpose god put my name on that place man and i'm going to sit right next to shamgar me and shamgar are going to have a wonderful time reminiscing about his victories and my victories i could just imagine oh shammy being about five foot six balding a little bit you know praise god is right you know full of energy full of life got to a point where he was beat down but he realized the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob is my god and i have rights i got a purpose and he grabbed the only thing that he had an ox gold and he proceeded to whoop philistines so you're never too young to start serving god my only wish today young person is that i would have served the lord when i was 14 and 15 when i felt in my junior high days to serve god but you know i was pulled by peer pressure how many ever felt peer pressure you know high school students you know and they want to pull you in to do this and they want to get you to do this try your first drink of alcohol try your first smoke a cigarette those things are real just because we believe the message doesn't mean that you're not uh prone to not having those things placed before you we all are placed before you and yet many times i felt i fell to those things because i didn't have any structure in the home life back home to support me and though i wanted to serve god when i was 14 i went to a pentecostal church for many years for about maybe six months to a year i went there and i really wanted to serve the lord but i couldn't because i was doing it all on my own but i knew there was a pool on the inside of serve god now i didn't know what that purpose was and then when i was 22 i had a failed relationship and i was telling my wife we were just talking about that earlier today i had a relationship with a young lady that i thought i was going to marry one day and la la la la we know we've always some of us has had those and your heart broken but god used that situation to get me where i am today and i told earlier i said i would never i would do that every day of my life so that i could have a wife like you so that i could have children like we have so that i can have the life that i'm living now all that hurt all that pain i didn't understand the purpose of it because i was broken my heart was broken and my life seemed to be enshattered and i didn't have a desire and at one moment in my life i no longer had the zeal to live but i wanted to commit suicide but see god knows the end from the beginning so god knew where he'd purpose my life to be he knew what he placed on the inside of my life and yet i couldn't see it and there's a lot of times satan will blind you from seeing your purpose just hold on because he will bring it to manifestation see satan was adamant that if god removed his hand from job's life to job of cursing but god was adamant no matter what you do no matter the test no matter the accusations no matter the loss of loved ones no matter the sickness no matter the prodding from his wife no matter the trial god said job will not curse me he will not curse me see god had confidence in what he placed in job's life he placed a seed on the inside of job and there wasn't enough devils in hell could stop that seed from coming to life and that same god has that same confidence in you tonight he knew what age to put you in think about it you could have been in the first stage and it could have been horse and buggy or this however they made it around and you know you would have had the pressures of that age but he waited until this age and he placed you in this age the most wicked age in the most wicked time but yet the prophet of god will tell us it's the greatest of all ages because it's the blending of time with eternity there's going to be a people in this room tonight that is going to receive a body change and then a moment in the twinkling of an eye things are going to start breaking apart or however it takes place and we're going to see loved ones that have gone by the way of the grave they're going to come back in and they're not going to be old they're not going to be wrinkled they're not going to be stooped over they're going to be young again and when our eye system merely sees him walking through the door you know that the change is on and there ain't enough devils in hell can stop it because that's what god has purpose and he placed you here to live out that purpose god purpose in his heart that he's going to have an old person that's going to serve him to the bitter end he's going to have a young person that's going to dedicate their life and they're going to serve god from a young age all the way up they'll not they'll not move away from the dictations of the word of god they will serve god with a whole heart with a whole purpose if their whole mind they've dedicated their life god is purposed in his heart to bring a people to fruition and there's got to be a people in the end time that's purpose in their heart we're going to serve god no matter what no matter the pressure no matter the strain no matter the family dynamics no matter the trial that i go through no matter the sickness that the devil does i'm going to serve god because that's our purpose that's our purpose has our purpose tonight is to serve a living god to let the word of god be made manifest through your failed humanity how big is our god he knew your every weakness and yet he says i'm going to live through that weakness he knew your shortcomings and yet he says i'm going to manifest myself through their shortcomings you know what sometimes i think i'm always right yeah my is right sometimes we think we're always right but when you can recognize that you're wrong and then you recognize that god still uses you my what a promise that god even in my mistakes the bible says even when we're not faithful he remains faithful even when we fall not that we do it on purpose because the bible says that a son of god cannot sin because the seed of god remaineth in him that word practice or that word committed means to practice we don't practice sin we're not in the art of practicing sin that we do but we do fall we do fall short of the glory of god at times and yet because of that god still decides to use us anyway man we serve a mighty god i mean how wonderful is it brother aaron when you make mistakes and i know that your wife thinks man you're perfect don't say no right now i'm talking to her i'm looking at her but i'm pointing at you man he's perfect look at him tall dark and handsome never makes a mistake yeah i saw that sometimes that's what we think of the ministry too though they don't make mistakes no we're just as human as you're human we all have a purpose though and sometimes you young people think you don't have a part to play in an assembly you have a part to play in an assembly there's no church service complete without the young people in that church you understand what i'm saying there's no church service complete without the young people in the service our church our young people when they go off to camp meetings or they go off to special meetings when they leave it's a void in the church they played that much of a role in the service of the lord they have that much of an effect on the worship they have that much of an effect on the pulling of the gift of god through the ministry and you think god can't use you no don't sell yourself short don't let the devil pull the wool over your eyes you're a vital part of this congregation and furthermore you're a vital part of the family and the dynamics of god god's economy includes you god has a purpose and that purpose is to make sure that he places you in position and don't get out of position stay in your calling wherewith you have been called and in time you would reach that you'll know what that purpose is and that calling is so we find we think about well brother joe you talked about job and you you talked about all these different things you talked about your life but come on i'm a young person what about me how does this pertain to me well i'm glad you asked because there's three in particular young people that i want to speak about right now how many believe that trials will come hardships will come disappointments will come stay around long enough you'll find out and brother baby says when trials and troubles and heartaches and disappointments set in something holds see it's not you holding something's holding you it isn't the question whether i held on or not it's the question whether he held on or not so god called you and god doesn't call you to lose you god doesn't place you in his hands and holds you in his hands for you to fall through his hands no we're in the hands of god and the same hands that he blew off those the the milky way and the galaxies and the worlds that that we see out there the stars at night that same god is holding you tonight he had a purpose for doing it then and he has a purpose for doing it now and yet he formed you and he fashioned you into his image that's god's purpose for our life so we find now as we go back and we want to look not go back we want to look here briefly at these three hebrew children and i understand we sometimes we we read this and we only use them in the reference to young people because they were young people but i believe if you look i think we all can find our place there but for the sake of time tonight we are dealing with the young people and we wonder how can god use me i'm just a young person what can i do well let's just read the story is that okay we can read the story tonight on the young people of babylon it was probably around this kind of temperature outside 100 degrees it was on a sunday night service man come on you're a hard crowd to crack tonight just work with me give me just a laugh or chuckle or something a little slight amen a work i'm good daniel 3 and verse 8 wherefore at the time certain chaldeans came near and accused the jews and they spake and they said to the king nebuchadnezzar o king live forever thou o king has made a decree notice they reminded the king of the decree that he made that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet the flute the harp the sackbut the sultry and the dulcimer and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and whosoever falleth not down and worship it that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and there are certain jews whom thou said over the affairs of the province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego these men o king have not regarded thee they serve not their gods nor worship the golden image with thou has set up notice this golden image was the image of daniel their friend a prophet but they also knew that exodus 34 verse 14 said that for thou shall worship no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god so they knew to only worship the one true living god then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and his fury he commanded to bring shadrach meshach and abednego then they brought these men before the king and nebuchadnezzar spake and he said unto them is it true o shadrach meshach and abednego do you not serve the gods no worship the golden image which i have set up now if you be ready that at the what time you hear the sound of the country music playing the sound of the rap music playing the sound of the rock music playing the sound of the mexican music playing i mean i guess y'all got mexican music here i'm just assuming i don't know it just leads to believe that we're in tucson but this time that you hear all these kinds of music that you don't fall down and worship the image which i have made well but if you worship not you shall be cast that same hour in the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is the god that shall deliver you out of my hands notice nebuchadnezzar made a challenge whose god is able to deliver you and satan makes the same challenge to you in this hour who's god is it william branham's god is it the pastor's god is it your dad's god what god is going to deliver you from my clutches look at what i got i got them shooting up in the schools shooting up they're shooting up crack cocaine they're shooting up methamphetamines they're shooting up young people young teens doing all these things addicted to drugs addicted to alcohol addicted to pornography addicted to sex sins in grade school in high school in elementary school and all this and yet satan says you can't overcome this but we find here shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this manner if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thy hand okay here are these young men 13 14 15-ish in their age made a determination they were going to serve god they were held as prisoners they were in a foreign land away from mama away from their dad away from their church away from their norm their worship and yet they had purpose in their heart that they would not defile themselves with the things of babylon and they purposed in their heart that they would not serve any other gods but the god of jehovah notice the confession that these young men made because god had purposed in their heart and it says in verse 18 but if not be it known unto the o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image with thou has set up i mean you want to talk about strike a man in the face nebuchadnezzar was i think he was a little bit stunned and the bible would go on to tell us then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visions was changed against shadrach meshach and abednego therefore he's spaking the commandment they that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was ever want to be heated and he commanded the most notice he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach meshach and abednego to cast him into the burning fiery furnace he called the best that he had to bind these men to these children and to throw them in the fire and these men were bound in their coats and they're hosing in their hats and they're go out their other garments and they were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the the king's commandment was urgent and a furnace exceeding hot that the flames of the fire slew the men that took took up shadrach meshach and abednego slew the mighty man and these three men shadrach meshach and abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and he rose up in haste and he spake and he said unto the counselors did not we cast three men bound into the fire and they answered and said unto the king true o king and he answered and he said lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt they have no hurt but see because they purposed in their heart that they will not bow to the image and you must purpose in your heart you're not going to bow to the image that man is trying to erect today but you're going to serve god you're not going to serve the vices of the enemy you're not going to serve the enticements of the world but you're going to serve god you're going to dedicate your life at a young age to serve the lord and to fulfill the purpose which he has for you and the bible would tell us in verse 26 then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the fire of the furnace and he spake and he said shadrach meshach and abednego you servants of the most high god come forth and come hither then shadrach meshach and abednego came forth out of the midst of the fire and the bible would tell us that his eye is on the sparrow if his eye is on the sparrow certainly he watches over us his eye is on the sparrow one of the smallest birds and yet he's so mindful of his creation certainly he's mindful of his creation he's mindful of us see his eyes are on the sparrow and he left all of all of his glory to come down to babylon when these three young men purposed in their heart they wasn't thrown into the fire they stepped into the fire because they knew in their heart of hearts that god was able to deliver and even if he wasn't they were willing to take god at his word anyway and they refused to bow they refused to bend they refused to burn and god met them in their furnace but the bible say the hebrew children was a witness that god could deliver from fire when the furnace had been hot seven times they they said and had been thrown into the fire because they refused to give glory to the other god but the unseen god god wants us to to take him at his word and they refused to bow down to the image they went into the fiery furnace and god made their testimony to witness that he can deliver from fire so you say what was the purpose god was determined that he was going to have a young person so no matter what he put them through or allowed them to go through he was going to get the glory from the trial he says we the young children when god had a purpose for them when they were down in babylon the furnace was hit seven times hotter than it ever was heeded to destroy the purpose of god and all of babylon was on a rage and they were determined satan was to destroy the purpose of god for he knew those children was going into the furnace so he made the furnace when they heated it up seven times hotter to be sure that the program of god will be destroyed but god wanted to display his power and what has god done in this hour displayed his power god has displayed his power and all of babylon and all of hell could not defeat the purpose no sir no matter if they couldn't they could have heated the furnace up a million times hotter it would have never destroyed the purpose of god god wanted to show that he was god of deliverance and he'd bring deliverance to whomever he desired to bring it and nothing will interfere with this program and we find in this sage the seventh age the age that is heated up seven times hotter than any other age there has been in no other age that l g b t movement same-sex marriage let your kids determine their gender no god's already determined the gender but yet the furnace is being heated up now there's video games so realistic that it encourages young men to take assault rifles and go to school and shoot up their classmates because they begin to be dumbed down to it because they play it in virtual reality in their homes blood and gore and guts and all this they think nothing about taking another person's life see satan has heated the furnace seven times hotter music that entertains the spirit but prepares a soul for hell you know you you go to places and the stores and different things and maybe you catch some of the lyrics you don't just start tapping your foot and doing the boogie woogie to it but you hear some of the lyrics and especially some of the rap and you hear some of just the the the words and what they're talking about and it's like oh my word really we're talking about rape we're talking about murder we're talking about all this and they talk about it openly and this is what the young people of this age is is filling their minds on and they're feeding on it and feeding on it and yet they and we think or the parents think that this is okay it's not okay the furnace is being heated up and we got fashion today and we knew that the prophet prophesied that there'd be you know no clothes and now you walk in my i seen enough i've not seen enough clothes on some of the girls here in tucson since we've been here it's so hot everybody just wants to take their clothes off and we find but yet the struggle and what's it do it send more souls to hell and you find young girls and young boys now dealing with pornography and addictions and suicide and depression and anxiety more so they've ever seen in any other age it's here the furnace is head up seven times hotter but god has a purpose god has determined i'm gonna have a young person in tucson tabernacle so no matter how hot this thing gets they're going to serve me heat it up satan you can heat it up a million times hotter than what it is right now because my word is stronger than anything you can put out there see they want to talk about you can receive the holy ghost without sensation the days of miracles has passed now they got people discredited in the prophet's ministry and satan has done all this to destroy the purpose of god but shadrach meshach and abednego said we will not bow we will not bow our god is able to deliver we will not bow we will not bend we will not burn god is able and i'm here to tell you our god is able tonight see god used the hebrews children testimony to prove that he has the ultimate say in what happens in a believer's life is there any believers here willing to go to the furnace tonight just step on you may be you know satan had it so hot trying to get them to fear the flames but i want you to look at it from this side of it god started a fire so he can fellowship with his children god started a fire so he could have fellowship with his children because he had a purpose satan thought well i got em now i'm gonna destroy the purpose of god we're gonna heat this baby up it ain't never been this hot god said perfect i like heat stepped on down and the boys didn't even smell of smoke when they come out nice thing about it though the bands that were on their hands and on their feet that's the only thing that was touched because god doesn't intend for you to be bound he tends for you to be loose so you can walk in victory so you can live in victory so you can worship in victory let me tell you church your hands aren't bound you can lift those hands up and worship a living god you may be in the furnace but he designed a furnace to bring you into fellowship you say i need a quote for that brother joe perfect i'm so glad you want to quote for that here he says it he says this he says now let me find it because it's kind of on down here well maybe i passed it but he said sometimes god will harness troubles and trials and put a bit in its mouth and pull you into the presence of god so that he can have a closer fellowship with you see the trials that we go through are not all unfair and young person you're going to have your moment you're going to have your day when you're like what in the world is going on with me god is pulling you into his presence because he longs to have fellowship think about daniel daniel purpose in his heart that he wasn't going to defile himself with the king's meat and he had lentils and i learned just the other day because we were speaking to a young man who was a recent convert to the message and indian guy he's a jain from his origin and they eat lentils they don't eat meat but there's more protein than lentils than there is in meat and so that's how daniel and the hebrew boys could live because they were getting all the protein from lentils and yet we find that daniel purpose in his heart that he wasn't going to defile himself with the things of babylon he wasn't going to drink the alcohol he wasn't going to eat the food he wasn't going to do the things that they were doing and he was going to worship his god he was going to throw the curtains open and pray he wasn't afraid to give god honor to give god glory to give god praise but you know what i think god reserved to be a verbo for daniel he reserved the best place you think man where did he reserve down in babylon he reserved the l.d manor you say what does ld matter lion's den manner he's put it on special order and he reserved it before the foundation of the world because he wanted fellowship with his prophet you know there was nobody requesting that room but god requested it and daniel said o king i'll see you in the morning i'm not afraid of what's about to happen and the prophet of god said the angel of the lord met daniel in the lines then i can just imagine daniel just you know he wasn't fearful we're talking to the young people so i can get casual he wasn't worried he just had come on kitty kitty laid back oh yes oh this is nice oh yeah they're just meowing and meowing we want to think the worst of the event god's in control they may be ferocious but there was a presence of the supernatural there daniel wasn't worried making them cats can march back and forth they hadn't fed them in weeks they were starving ready to devour but god reserved that place because god had a purpose that he was going to prove that he was greater than a king that he's greater than anything that this world can throw at you or god is greater so no matter what you're facing god's reserved your room and god has placed you in a furnace for a purpose and there's no devil in hell can defeat the purpose of god and your purpose is to serve god your purpose the bible will tell us is to be a son and daughter of god beloved what manner of love hath the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called sons of god think about that as we're bringing this down to a close the prophet of god will say all the powers of hell may wage against it but it will not prevail we have god's eternal promise there may be teachers rise there may be isms rise there may be great programs rise there may be things that we look like to try to be destroyed but it can never be destroyed it is the purpose of god to see that it will prevail then it's not up to you it's not up to me it's not up to whether you will be destroyed or not it's up to god and we can rest assure on it that god will never let our heritage be destroyed for it is his purpose to give it to us you say well brother joe all the guns are hell or they're they're pouring on me and all the kids at school are making fun of me and they're they're accusing me of this isaiah 54 verse 17 says no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper no weapon whatever form it comes in no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper in every tongue that rise up against thee thou shall condemn and the bible will tell us in romans 8 and verse 31 if god be for us then who can be against us see god has called you you have a purpose in romans 8 and verse 28 we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son notice those he called he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born of many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate to them he also called that word called there means you received a name you're bearing a title and it's not a family title but it's a family title those whom he did predestinate he allowed you to bear the title of son he allowed you to bear the title of daughter in whom he called he already justified and whom he justified he already had glorified see god is working everything for his purpose which you were formed in the image of god to fulfill that purpose so you may wonder how many young girls do we have here tonight we have some how many of you've got your wedding already planned one of them's being honest she's probably how old are you eight eight nine ten maybe six eleven okay eleven she's getting closer got her wedding already planned he's gonna be certain certain height he's gonna be certain certain look he's going to be certain certain bills he's going to may have this kind of job and we got it all planned out don't you you got your dress planned out you got your bridesmaids planned out you got his groomsmen planned out you got it all planned out i got three daughters i know how this works and we think well i've got this this is i'm gonna do this but god has the final say god has a purpose and your purpose in life is not who you're going to marry it's not where you're going to go to church it's not who you're going to be affiliated with but your purpose in life is to serve god so the question that we've all have wrestled with what is my purpose what is god's purpose for my life that is to let the word of the hour be manifested through you god's desire is to have a bride to have a body that she would be born of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life the prophet of god says she is him so that's your purpose i'm glad you have your marriage planned but god has a greater purpose for your life and i understand you young boys some of you probably want to be very athletic and be a superstar i thought man i when i was in sixth grade this is what i was i'm like man i'm gonna be a giant i'm sixth grade i'm five foot six i play football i loved it but everybody just grew up and i was just stay right where i was at see i had purpose i was gonna be something great in worldly standards but god has something greater according to his standards so our purpose is not to be who's who our purpose is not what kind of fancy car we're going to drive or what nice house we're going to live in and how much money we're going to make but our purpose is simple be a child of god be a child of god how do you become a child of god by one spirit are we born into the family of god to allow the holy spirit to come in your life and to be born again that's your purpose it's not difficult we don't have to bring a bunch of scriptures into it we don't have to complicate it with a bunch of quotes it's that simple god has one purpose for your life and that's to be a child of god it doesn't have to get any more complicated than that right there now if he has other things for you to do he will lead you to those things as we discussed this morning but your purpose on earth is to declare him is to declare him that he's alive that he's not a god of history but he's a god of now that the same god that walked the shores of galilee the prophet of god would say he's the same in every detail except the corporal body is living and manifesting in laodicea through my life that's your purpose want to musicians come see it's that simple yet it can be that difficult because we wrestle with it because satan has access to the mind and he begins to complicate it and complicate it and complicate it because you're driving one way but he knows the way you're going to go so sometimes satan because you're driving one way he will allow a little bit of pain and struggle to bring you back to the way he wants you to go and i believe the lord did that in my own personal experience and my own personal life was a young age god allowed the circumstances of my life to childhood because i was running from the childhood trying to be something or somebody worldly speaking and yet god knew he had an end for me he knew i would be standing before you today declaring this word so he had to put something in the way a roadblock and say you're going the wrong way i don't intend for you to go down this road you need to stop you need to turn around you need to go home and i can say god spoke to me through a literal voice to turn your car around and go home young person if that be you tonight turn your car around turn around don't keep going the same way you've been going god has a purpose for your life don't you just balance bower heads just for a brief minute if you would just play something there'd be a young person here we dedicated this service to you tonight and i just don't want to miss the opportunity to give you a chance if you've been going the wrong way i want you to know right now you could just slip your hand up say god remember me tonight remember me tonight i'm lifting my hand before you i want to serve you lord i don't want to defile myself tonight with the things of this world i feel the poor i i feel the struggle i hear what brother joe's talked about and yet maybe i've struggled with my own purpose and calling in life but god i see it it's so plain and so simple tonight my purpose is to be a child of god this will declare christ that he's alive in this hour father i just ask tonight lord that has we taken the time just to be able to minister something personally to the young people and we just ask father you just allow this word just to begin to settle down right now or just begin to resonate in their soul realm go beyond the mind father go down into the regions of the soul where the word of god can take on reality and that word in that word is life and that life comes down through the channel of the mind into the depths of the soul father and that life begins to be lived out lord you didn't intend for no one here tonight to be a drunk to be a drugged to be a prostitute to be lost to be wayward but you intended each of us here to be sons and daughters of god and lord we purpose tonight and we renew our vows to you father that we will serve you lord we may not understand the conversation that's being had in heaven regarding our life the lord we will serve you for me and my house we will serve the lord and i'm asking lord tonight in this august presence so does i feel you just moved by me right now so sweetly god i ask tonight that we as a church as a body can dedicate our lives a fresh and a new lord not just a young person in age but lord each of us tonight can just dedicate our hearts to god lord i just pray that we can rekindle those fires god that once burned so brightly and lord this kind of now just embers lord may you just let the breath of god begin to blow on it lord and may lord it just become a flame father and the revival fires of the word just become a new and you begin to stimulate our hearts lord by the the word of god for this hour god we're so thankful for this message we're so thankful lord you saw fit to allow the prophet's ministry to come across our lives because when you saw that you were going to send the prophet lord you saw us right there in need of a prophetic ministry to bring us out of the world and the conditions of that world and lord and i pray for the young people here at tucson tabernacle those that are present that are hearing my voice now lord i asked dear god that you would put your hedge of protection around them father and god made their hearts may their hearts be determined to serve you come and they purpose within their hearts tonight god that they will not defile themselves with the things of this world they will serve you lord they will dedicate their lives from this night on father and lord when the strain of the world began to pull on them god may you remind them of the message tonight that they have a purpose they have a place in the economy of god and you have a plan for them so lord i ask that you had blessed each and every young person i asked lord you'd bless every adult that's here tonight mom and dad grandparent bless us as a church body lord as we rededicate our lives and god realizing we have a purpose and you have a plan and we know that nothing can defeat the purpose

seemed to be no out god you provided and you're here again providing for your children lord you said feed the sheep we did that this morning you told peter if you love them feed the lambs and lord we've done that tonight surely we love you father we want to feed your children and we ask lord that your children will be fed and they will continue to eat upon the word of life and allow their bodies to be strengthened by this word by the message of the hour by the prophet ministry lord not man's ideas but the word that you've placed in this hour so lord we just give this service to you
