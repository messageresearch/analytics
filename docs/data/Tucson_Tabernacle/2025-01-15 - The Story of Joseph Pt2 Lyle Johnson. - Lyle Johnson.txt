brothers and sisters how many believe that God answers prayer I believe it with all my heart I've seen it happen so many times now I believe you heard these prayer requests and I believe it's important for us to make an effort and that effort could be getting down on your knees that effort could be however the Lord leads you but a small effort that we can make is to raise our hands if you

each hand father we lift those requests up before you along with young Lydia father and this lady that ask for prayer because of the Fall father we pray for her in Jesus name and our dear friend

Wednesday night bible study amen last time we began an investigation into the life of Joseph what lessons it holds for us tonight we'll continue our study of his life but before we resume let's join

our choice Lord we pray that you'd be continue to be present here this evening Lord pray that you'd help me Lord to not say anything that would cause a problem cause anyone to stumble Point anyone in

thank you for your word and for your love and your grace to us each one in Jesus name amen we concluded Genesis chapter 37 last time but we have some unfinished business regarding Joseph being sold to spice not slave but spice traitors who then sold him into slavery in Egypt let's go back a moment for opening verses I'm not going to surprise you and jump to some other place in the Bible we're in Genesis the brothers are in Dothan Joseph is stripped starving and thirsty beaten dumped into an empty and dry sistern meanwhile callously his brothers are having a meal while they discuss what to do with them and they some or all of the nine older brothers Ruben wasn't present they sat down to eat bread uh maybe at their lunch there they had some treats that Joseph had brought from Jacob's a little nuts and honey we know that Jacob likes to send nuts and honey to people so they're sitting there maybe enjoying this snack that Joseph had brought while he was starving in the sstn and they lifted up their eyes and they looked and behold a company of Israelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing Spicer and bomb and myrr going to carry it down to Egypt the spice trade must have been pretty good camels were not in wide use at this time a domesticated camel would have been a very expensive animal and Judah the fourth oldest about age 20 he saw this and he turned to his brothers and he said what profit what what do we gain what what advantage is it if if we kill our brother and and conceal his blood come let's sell him to the ishmaelites let not our hand be upon him for even though we hate him he is our brother and our flesh and his Brethren were content they they consented they greed and their passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Israelites for 20 pieces of silver and they that the ishmaelite midianites brought Joseph into Egypt now we'll get back to this map in this verse in a moment skipping down to verse 36 the last verse of chapter 37 the midianites sold Joseph into Egypt unto potier an officer of pharaohs and captain of the Guard Chief executioner head of the Secret Service and the FBI and the CIA and Homeland Security please be seated there are at least three questions that come to mind when we read these verses why would the brothers think they could get away with their crime against Joseph and against their father by selling Joseph to these Merchants how would they know that word wouldn't get back to Jacob why would spice Traders agree to buy a slave and why does Moses who wrote Genesis make it clear that these were ishmaelites rather than simply calling them midianites once again you know me we need to get context well let's look at the probable route from Dothan to Egypt the brothers know the area they know the likely route the caravan's going to take from Dothan to Egypt and they know Joseph do you see the problem Joseph isn't going to be appliable quiet guys they attach them to the pack animals and force them to walk the next 300 miles to and across the scorching Sinai desert into Egypt he's young strong can survive the journey but he'll be talking he'll be bleading he'll recognize some of the route as well assume they cover 25 or 30 miles a day on the second day of the journey they're going to pass within 20 miles of heon of Jacob's home hey guys listen to me my my my dad's a very wealthy man very wealthy and if we just detour or or if you can send one of your servants to to Hebron look on the map I've got a little dashed red line for you to follow here my my dad he'll pay you a huge Ransom many times more than you can possibly make by by selling me to the Egyptian slave market you guys are all about making a profit right my my dad will pay plenty for me I tell you no questions asked he he's rich and I'm his favorite no no really I I I am Hey Hey My My grandpa Isaac and your grandpa Ishmael they're Brothers we're some sort of cousins we're family guys guys why won't you to listen to me please ow ow ow why are you hitting me shut up you filthy Hebrew we're going to take you to Egypt frankly we don't care if we lose money on you we're just going to enjoy seeing you suffer and know that you'll be suffering for as long as you live your short life toiling in the hot Egyptian sun you think it's only your brothers that hate you well what's really going on why wouldn't they make a small d sort to cash in on Joseph and how could the brothers have absolute confidence that Joseph would not succeed in persuading these Merchants to do so why would they be willing to risk everything for 20 shekels you're right we need more context first let's look at Midian where these guys came from but not looking so much at the place but but the person after whom the place is named the the founder if you will he was born to Abraham of coutura flashback 125 years or so Genesis 251 then again long after Hagar's departure sometime following Sarah's death Abraham took a wife and her name was coutura she bear him zimran and yakin and Medan and I and ishack and shua yeah yeah I'm I'm I'm shua we often think of Abraham as having two sons ishmail and Isaac but we see he had at least eight skipping down to verse five Abraham gave gave all that he had unto Isaac but Unto the Sons of the concubines zimran Jan mid Midian ishac and shua which Abraham had Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son while he yet lived Eastward into the East Country into the desert so the midianites were among the disinherited of Abraham Midian received a gift but not an inheritance he was sent away into the desert the Arabian penins Pula Abraham wanted nothing further to do with him nor they him when Abraham died and was buried none of curra's sons were listed as present Midian settled in an area he named after himself it's the area marked on the lower right of the screen it's in present day Saudi Arabia it's the place to which Moses the guy writing this book would later Flee for his life from Egypt and possibly where he began to write Genesis after leaving Egypt the second time moving on who was the first born of Abraham wasn't Isaac it was ishmail born of Hagar sarai's Egyptian slave Sarai who later became Sarah and Abram who later became Abraham received a promise of a son he had Faith Abraham believed God but he didn't trust God for the timing tried to take matters into his own hand slept with sarai's slave Hagar because Sarai didn't trust God's timing either well what did the Lord say about ishmail to Hagar his mother when she fled for her life from Sarai before ishmail was born the angel of the Lord found Hagar by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to Shure and he said Hagar sise maid once comest thou whether wilt thou go where are you coming from where where are you headed and she said I flee from the face of my mistress Sarah and the angel of the Lord said unto her this Egyptian slave said unto her her return to thy mistress submit thyself under her hands and the angel of the Lord said unto her I will multiply thy descendants exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude you're going to get through this and the angel of the Lord said unto her behold thou art with child this is not news to her but the rest of it is and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name Ishmael God will hear because the Lord hath heard thy Affliction he'll be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he'll dwell in the presence of of all his Brethren ESV ends with he shall dwell over against or near all his Kinsmen well we expect ishmail and likely his descendants to be at odds with Isaac and his descendants and ishmael's descendants of course are called ishmaelites well Abraham was 86 when Ishmael was born Genesis 16:16 it's on the handout all the scriptures that that I'm referencing although this ones may not be because we're not actually reading it he was a hundred years old when Isaac was born 14 years later Genesis 215 how is ishmail ultimately treated by Abraham let's flash back to the Celebration when the toddler Isaac was weaned at about three years of age making ishmail about 17 Genesis 219 and Sarah saw ishmail the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had borne unto Abraham mocking kind of like a normal teenage boy right 17 years old his three-year-old half brother over here look at this little God wherefore Sarah said unto Abraham Abraham cast out this Bond woman and her son the son of this Bond woman should not be air with my son not not with my Isaac well the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son Abraham loved ishmail they were buddies they were pal they got along God said unto Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy Bond woman and all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be called Abraham she may be throwing a hisy fit but listen to your wife whoa excuse me I don't know where we're at now we'll get there sorry I don't know what happened here you're getting a sneak preview well hopefully it'll come back oh okay thank you and also the son of the Bond woman will I make a nation because he's thy seed he's your Offspring he's your descendant Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle like a win skin a bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar and putting it on her shoulder why ishmail is this strong strapping 17-year-old boy Hagar's carrying it because she's a slave and the child ishma now AED 17 and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beva that's the southern part of modern day Israel and Islam the Quran claims that hegar was in Medina not Bersa their version of the miracle to be described in the next few verses is why Medina is the second holiest place in that religion and the water was spent in the bottle they they drank it it's a long way they've been Walking In the Heat of the desert and and Hagar cast Ishmael under one of the shrubs a little shade and she went and sat down over against him a good way off about a bow shot a few hundred feet maybe from from here to the to the back wall of the church there or so and she said let let me not see the death of the child and she sat over opposite him to lift lifted up her voice and wept oh Lord what is this happening in her distress she forgot the promise that the angel of the Lord had made to her some 17 or 18 years earlier when I'm stressed out that she usually when I need to be reminded as well that's when I tend to forget and God heard the voice of Hagar no we have no idea but he heard the voice of ishmail he heard the voice of the lad and the angel of God Called to the lad no to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aith the Hagar fear not God ha heard your voice no God has heard the voice of the lad where he is arise lift up the lad hold him in thine hand I will make him a great nation he's reminding hegar the promise he made to her before ishmail was born just like the previous time she's in the wilderness she's fleeing from Sarah and I'm a little nervous here okay and God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water just like before in the desert and there's some water and she went and filled the bottle of water and gave the lad drink and God was with ishmail and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness became an Archer he dwelt in the wilderness of pan and Hagar took him a wife out of the land of Egypt you can be sure ishmael's descendants knew the story of the banishment visited upon Him by Abraham and Sarah and here in Dothan are descendants of Isaac the favored son who got the birthright and inheritance that should have been ishmael's Joseph's brothers are offering these ishmaelites from Midian another ill-treated son of Abraham the son favored by Jacob who himself is the son of Isaac whom Abraham favored over ishmail this is the the Hatfields and The McCoys there we go how can the Israelites refuse and at 20 pieces of silver the price is cheap these guys could afford camels the brothers knew that there's no way these ishmaelite spice Traders from Midian will ever let Joseph Escape nor sell him back to Jacob Joseph is going to Egypt to a life of slavery performing harsh labor in their broiling sun or toiling in a mine probably dying in early death how the Merchant's eyes must have glistened at the thought ah Sweet Revenge and even better his suffering will be in Egypt where our matriarch Hagar came from as what a Slave how old was our ancestor Ishmael when he was banished with Hagar 17 how old is this Hebrew grandson of the usurper Isaac the favorite of his father Jacob 17 She Came From Slavery you're going into slavery oh the irony yeah we'll take them well we'll only give you 20 pieces of silver and the brothers thought good riddance good luck with those dreams Joey bye-bye and now begins a 300 mile trk it is uncomfortable these guys hate him for what he represents yet yet that very hatred is what is saving Joseph's life but what's really going on here let's let's turn to Psalm 105 I'm using the SV for clarity here Psalm 105 opens up oh give thanks to the Lord always a good idea call upon his name make known his deeds among the peoples sing to him sing praises to Him tell of all his wondrous Works glory in His holy name let the hearts of those who seek the Lord Rejoice well what may be included in this list of deeds and wondrous works for which we are to sing praises to the Lord Brother Lyall I thought we were in the story of Joseph oh oh yeah you're you're right oh oh ver verse 16 when the Lord summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread the Lord sent a man ahead of Jacob's family Joseph who was sold as a slave Joseph's feet were hurt with Fetters his neck was put in a collar of iron until what he said came to pass the word of the Lord tested Joseph the Lord was sending Joseph to Egypt just not the way we often think of these things not on a jet airliner Warn and air conditioned automobile not staying in nice hotels eating in restaurants speaking to Friendly groups before jetting home not moving to a town with a church to attend but be en and starved Shackled betrayed dehydrated thirsting to a life of unrequited toil years later Isaiah knew this story of Joseph's hardship and misery deception and pain yet Isaiah said here am I Lord send me send me back to Joseph's Journey no mercy from his ishmaelite owners other than to keep him alive so he'll be marketable hot thirsty hungry sunburnt the metal collar even hotter in the sun burning his neck the shackles doing the same to his ankles and feet chafing them besides the heat feet swollen ankles raw bleeding blistered don't want him trying to run away and the smell not just sweat animal dung in urine the usual odors along our primitive Road or track but the spices many of these spices weren't for flavoring food they were for perfumes and incense the Egyptians that that could afford it would mix them with animal fat then put a GOP of it on their heads maybe smear some in other parts of their bodies their cleanly shaved bodies was a custom in Egypt amongst the elite as the day wore on the fat would melt run down their scalp neck and so forth to help offset the odors of an Agricultural Society replacing it with the fragrances of the elite I don't know about you but to me that sounds pretty disgusting would you want to put a glob of lard on your head mixed with some sort of cologne or perfume then let it heat up in the Sun and dribble down your face and neck neither would I but the Egyptians did and many of these spices were particularly aromatic they fetched a good price among the upper classes in Egypt and that's what Joseph would smell for the long forced March of two weeks or so the spices and other Goods weren't in hermetically sealed containers or wrapped in plastic bags or wrapped from Costco or something they were in poorest Sachs forced to along to a foreign land among people speaking a language he doesn't understand strange Customs a religion full of various gods and goddesses and very different culture far from home he would be associating these smells of the elite with the Heartbreak of leaving his family the cruel rejection of his brothers the taunt mistreatment by his owners pain hunger thirst The Thirst towards the end of his journey he would pass the Eastern edge of the Nile Delta an area we know is Goan on on the map here that's here this is uh it may not look terribly green to you but this is the Nile river flowing here you can see the desert's all brown and this is a very fertile area he's coming from Dothan coming down across the Sinai now he's at the edge of Goan at the Eastern edge of the Nile Delta it's Lush fertile almost tropical plenty of water lakes ducks and geese all sorts of wildlife he'd never seen before beautiful place little did he know that it would become the home of his clan as they became a nation a bit further on leaving the Delta area he would pass own later called heliopolis by the Greeks it was a center for among other things worship of the sun today this is a location in Cairo near the airport and there were multiple obelisks there well part of sun god worship these were Granite needle-like structures one piece stood on end with no supports not in a socket or got on a pit just flat on the bottom and placed on a solid surface unlike anything he'd ever seen this Obelisk and the photograph was erected at own to celebrate the 30th year of the reign of pharaoh cus R first shown on the right among other things sinus read the first established diplomatic and trade relations with various towns in Syria and Canaan which would have helped enable the Caravan of the ishmaelites to trade when Joseph passed by on his way to the slave market in Memphis this Obelisk would have been less than 50 years old this is an old photograph it's maybe a hundred years old or so of one of the obelisks that sesr one set which Joseph saw a solid piece of red granite standing 69 ft tall weighing 120 tons you can get some impression been size by the man standing next to the base which I've circled that's a full-size man not a kid that is one massive thing and here it is standing in the same place unmoved the weather War 4,000 years later it's the only Obelisk still standing in own it would have been new when Joseph walked by he would have seen it and oh by the way there may have been a a little girl playing outside as he was marched by perhaps she she stopped and looked up when she caught the powerful scent of the passing spice Caravan that smells like my daddy if so she might have noticed the out ofpl slave Tethered to the end of the line after it passed she probably went back to playing with her friends a a little girl daughter of the priest of an that would someday be Joseph's wife become the matriarch of two tribes of Israel and the only wife of any of Jacob's sons that is named in the Bible a very special little girl to a young man who had never seen anything more imposing than perhaps a two-story Stone building or a defensive wall around a small City such a sight must have been awe inspiring a gigantic pillar of granite carved with strange symbols just standing there he must have been wondering who are these people how can they do things like this as he continued on to the Nile he must have marveled at the size of the river in an utterly Barren desert much wider and deeper than the branch of the Euphrates near his boyhood home or the Jordan that he crossed about six years old coming into Canaan looking across it he would have spotted the Giza plateau and the mighty pyramids upon it pyramids that were only a few hundred years old the tallest most massive structures in the ancient world the Egyptians were masters of stonecraft many of their accomplishments are still all inspiring just ask the folks in the picture finally they came to Memphis the nominal capital of may have been U just outside of Memphis and established about the time Joseph arrived archaeological evidence suggest it was a little more than one of the royal residences the capital before then was stes another 400 miles further south along the Nile Egypt was earlier and from time to time became again two kingdoms with the capital for the lower Kingdom and for the upper Kingdom the reason for the capital shifting from time to time time from the Delta to thieves well let's rejoin Joseph now we've got a lot of context here let's rejoin Joseph as he arrives in the slave market Genesis 37 King James the midianite sold Joseph into Egypt unto potier an officer of pharaohs and captain of the guard and in the ESV we read meanwhile most translations read meanwhile as as Jacob is mourning his son and won't be comforted meanwhile the midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to pitifer an officer of pharaoh the captain of the Guard now you may have noticed that chapter 37 which we read last time and had been reviewing this evening so far never mentions God I've skipped around and read from other chapters where references to God are present but in chapter 37 his mention is conspicuously absent he does doesn't speak he isn't even referred to moses' ancient audience may have been wondering just like Joseph and Jacob must have been wondering Where's God has he abandoned me why is all this bad stuff happening what did I do to bring it about and of course why me have you ever had the meanwhiles wondered where God was in the midst of your life let's do a quick summary an overview of part of chapter 37 and as we leave it to see the hand of God working in the background Joseph had to be sent from heon by his dad exactly when he was so he could arrive at sheam precisely when he did so he could happen to encounter a stranger who had just happened to overhear the brothers saying they were going to Dothan Dothan which just happened to be a perfect place to inspire a murder Ruben had to persuade his brothers postpone the kill and his rescue plan had to fail the passing traitors had to be Israelites who happened to have a grudge against Jacob and they had to be on the to gilean to Egypt spice route that just happened to go through Dothan they had to arrive at the precise moment that the brothers were eating and they had to have a motive for refusing a large reward for returning Joseph to his father they had to take him to a specific City in Egypt and to sell them on a specific day to a specific Man Who Would happened to be in the slave market at the moment Joseph was for sale and happened to have a use for another young male slave and happen to be Pharaoh's captain of the Guard God did and does use all sorts of people with diverse motives orchestrating the entire sequence in his perfect timing working behind the scenes with his invisible hand guiding it all just as we read in Psalm 105 God sent Joseph to Egypt and used people motivated by hatred and jealousy to accomplish his will back to our story chapter 38 deals with Judah and we'll get to it God willing at a future date because judah's story of transformation runs parallel to Joseph's and when they intersect well you won't want to miss it chapter 39 opens with a repeat of the last verse of chapter 37 with one significant addition shesis 391 Joseph was brought down to Egypt potier an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Israelites which had brought him down thither and the Lord was with Joseph the Lord was with Joseph I've been told I can't confirm that one Jewish tradition says that potier smelled the aroma that's associated with nobility as he passed near the slave market that Aroma shouldn't be there unless a heavily guarded Noble was present but in His official capacity he would have known of such a visit he had not been advised so he rushed in to potentially defend the unknown Noble who might need protection from the sort of folks that Gather in such places the sight of potier charging into the slave market looking for the source of the aroma would have struck fear in the people he's the captain of the Guard the Royal executioner a very powerful and physically intimidating person the crowd's perspective would have been one of intimidation by his sudden presence there would be a sudden hush fall on the Marketplace Piper's perspective would be surprise perhaps confusion and instead of seeing a noble perhaps in need of protection he sees a young man on the slave block that smells of nobility yet is clearly a foreigner young and strong though clearly abused Joseph's perspective on The Auction Block in a bewildering Place one of the largest cities in the world at that that time hearing a language that he doesn't yet speak in the midst of a culture he certainly doesn't understand among people whose values are very different than his and smelling like the spices he's been marching and sleeping with for the past several days a fragrance the crowd would associate with their oppressors and overlords making the crowd hostile towards him everybody hates me and suddenly this Hulk of a guy comes charging in weapon drawn searching the suddenly silent crowd and then he stares at Joseph eyes locked comes closer perhaps he sniffs Joseph wonders what's going on who is this guy potier walks to the person running the slave market indicates Joseph transactions concluded Joseph's shackles and collar removed Potter for points Joseph walks out of the market just ahead of him people moving out of the way clearing a path not because of Joseph that'll happen many years later right now he's just a foreign slave no the crowd Parts because of the guy right behind him potier one of the most powerful and feared men in the country how did this happen and the Lord was with Joseph and always had been H looks like we still have time let's move on into chapter 39 the Lord was with Joseph he was a prosperous man that takes time several years and he was in the house of his master Piper the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with Joseph and that the Lord made all that Joseph did to prosper in his hand Joseph found Grace in Piper's sight and he served potier and pfer made Joseph overseer over his house and all that potterer had he put into Joseph's hand this is a big deal today we'd say he was promoted through the ranks from janitor to the Sea Suite he became the Chief Operating Officer the the COO of the plantation and Piper's other business interests it came to pass from the time that Piper had made Joseph Overseer in his house and all that he had since he' made him his coo that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that Piper had in the house and in the field this represents the passive of some years it's from the Nile potier didn't March Joseph from the market to his house have a conversation along the way check out his LinkedIn profile on his ey Stone and decide to put Joseph in charge of everything upon their arrival at the place let me see here you dream you wear a fancy coat you help watch flocks of sheep you file reports wow you're just a guy I've been looking for it to run my business no no Joseph would have been put in the slave quarters taught how to do the most menial tasks learned to speak the Egyptian language hey Hebrew that means muck out the cattle stalls now go do it we learn from verse five that Piper had fields in fact Middle Kingdom Egypt officials were often compensated with land to farm for food and trade as as a high official Piper's Holdings would have been extensive near the time of Joseph an Egyptian official named MRI was buried his tomb was robbed but a sealed off area was Miss by the thieves thousands of years later it was eventually found by archaeologists it contained lots of detailed wooden models of Life on his estate this is a 4,000 year old wooden model of a cattle stall you can see the cattle you can see the people taking care of them the model on the left is of a granery with six workers filling the storage areas and several scribes keeping accounts it must have been a government officials six people are working and eight or nine people are keeping track of them I'm sorry I shouldn't just said that the model on the right is of a slaughterous with cattle and geese being butchered the models provide a glimpse of a state life in Joseph's era over a period of at least a few years Piper would have taken note of this exceptional servant for Joseph to become prosperous successful takes time and work determination Joseph would have spent years in the field learning the seasons how to plant how to get the best yield how to harvest and winnow and thresh and store and preserve grain after all in his first Dream he saw sheep of wheat Joseph needs to learn to master all aspects of Agriculture related to wheat he's in the field he's getting some Hands-On training and but specifically such agriculture is practiced in Egypt recall years earlier there was a famine in Canaan and Abram traveled to Egypt why because unlike the surrounding areas Egypt did not depend on local seasonal rains for crops the Nile is the longest river in the world traveling some 4,000 miles from the mountain mountains of East Africa modern day Uganda and Ethiopia nearby areas to the Mediterranean Sea the equatorial rains there far away from the Mediterranean fed the sources of the Nile the resulting flooding of the Nile came every year like clockwork the river would rise depositing fresh soil replenishing the Aid Desert along its banks when the floods receded the farmers then went into the mud and planted their crops as the water continued to recede lacking irrigation pumps the Farm Workers would employ device called a shaduf to move water from the river to the fields the result was good soil a reliable supply of water for agriculture very different from agriculture in Canan and Mesopotamia which depended on local seasonal rain often unreliable and a very real threat of famine and certainly all quite new to a Shepherd like Joseph and meanwhile there's always a meanwhile Joseph applied himself to learn the Customs the culture the language the dress of Egypt and and his station within that hierarchy as he eventually Advanced he learned how to win the trust and loyalty of those he managed how to motivate them to get the best from them and with complete Integrity to obtain Grace favor with his master poer I suspect Joseph's attitude became one of gratitude he could have been sold to a cruel Master condemned to work in the minds of the Sinai or the sewage pits who knows but the Lord was with Joseph and he prospered years of toil in the fields gaining experience and responsibility and eventually potier left all that he had in Joseph's hand he knew not ought that he had he didn't worry about anything he had no concern about anything except the bread which he did eat what's cooking today the estate was booming abundant crops healthy cattle everything running smoothly with excellent results and we're told Joseph was a goodly person and and well favored by now in his mid-20s Joseph was not only successful and smart and wise he was also a strong good-looking young man other translations say he was handsome well-built attractive should be no surprise he came from a line of Attractive people great grandma Sarah was attractive enough she was wanted by an earlier Pharaoh Grandma Rebecca was another good-looking woman as was his mom Rachel the Bible rarely comments on physical appearances but these three ladies along on with Joseph are described to set the stage for what happens next Joseph's been proed he's no longer working in the fields now he's working in the house danger works in the house centuries later Solomon would observe talking about a father's advice to his son for the Commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life life and here's part of what this will protect you from to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids Solomon certainly was an expert in this area back to our text this time in the ESV is a language is a bit easier to follow as Joseph speaks after a time his m Piper's Wife cast her eyes on Joseph and said lie with me potier was a powerful man he may have been a poor husband but this isn't just about hormones or having an affair with a hired help she wants to dominate Joseph she wants to be in control manipulate him and maintain her self-image of irresistibility but Joseph much to her surprise bewilderment and embarrassment refused and said to his master's wife behold because of me Integrity honesty trustworthiness my master Piper has no concern about anything in the house he's put everything everything that he has in my charge he's not greater in his own house than I am nor has he kept back anything from me except you because you are his wife how then can I do this great wickedness against my master pfer and sin against God Joseph's God his religion is not the Egyptian religion with its many gods and goddesses and elaborate rituals he's a foreigner his God is foreign to the Egyptians and Joseph even as a slave torn from his home still worships and believes in the god of his fathers but he is also a hormonal young man in his mid 20s lonely subject to all the thoughts and desires that go with that and here's a beautiful woman urging him to satisfy his own longings and telling what he probably wants to hear you can be sure he was tempted as we read in Psalms God was testing him all the while Joseph isn't an angel he's human but he knows to give in would be wrong his final argument is that it would displease God so he resists another good lesson for us in whatever circumstances we find ourselves to trust in God and not willfully sin against him resist Temptations to sin resist means active engagement fighting I've never had to resist taking street drugs I've never taken them and never had any desire to they have no Allure or hold on me but other things in my life were Temptations I've had to fight to resist not always successfully and as she spoke to Joseph day after day relentlessly pursuing him he would not listen to her to lie beside her or to be with her you can be sure Mrs P was a beautiful Egyptian woman she was a mistress of the Palace of a very powerful and feared senior Egyptian official she was accustomed to getting her way no one denied her anything Joseph is painstakingly avoiding her avoiding any situation that could lead to her winning this battle whether by her strength his weakness or both battling day after day she was persistent she saw Joseph was carefully avoiding her her traps yet she was constantly coming on to him it's only reasonable the other servants in the house saw and heard and knew it was going on Joseph may not have been the first young man she went about to seduce but Joseph was probably the first to not fall for her WS or be threatened by her position to comply with her demands the struggle goes on it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within coincidence or had Mrs P instructed them to hide themselves or sent them to go do some task that we get them away from being near her when she saw or knew Joseph was on his way Joseph was being very careful to never be alone with her he managed the routine of the house so he was no doubt surprised caught off guard when entered the house and no one else was visible and Mrs potier caught him by His Garment she grabbed she seized his Kilt saying lie with me and Joseph left His Garment in her hand and fled and got out escaped to the outside the image on the right of the slide is from a tomb of a noble about Joseph's time the noble is standing next to his wife he can see her hand around around his waist and you can see how he's dressed you may have seen art depicting Joseph wearing a cloak or a robe or some turbine some heavy medieval stuff a lot of Renaissance artists thought that Egypt was in northern Europe I think they didn't dress like that in Egypt so Mrs P was grabbing at nothing more than the short cotton or linen skirt or Kilt when he ran out of the palace he was almost certainly wearing nothing and it came to pass when she saw that Joseph had left His Garment in her hand she had a tight grip on it as he pulled himself away and was fled forth out of the house he was gone and she was a woman scorned she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying see she shows him Joseph's skirt pfer brought an in Hebrew one to us to mock to make fun of us laugh at us he he came in unto me to to to lie with me to force himself on me and I cried with a loud voice when he came at me I screamed she's rehearsing the story she wants the servants to provide to back up her later accusations the verse tells us she didn't shout when she called the men she didn't have to raise her voice they weren't very far away at the end she claims that she cried with a loud voice if what she was telling them was true the men would have already been there and she would have not had to call for them she would have been pushing and fighting not holding on to Joseph's Kilt not trying to keep him there in other words she was saying here's the deal as you can see this is that Hebrew Joseph's Kilt he came in here to attack me but screamed yeah I know you never heard me scream but I did what you heard me when I just now asked you to come you must have been distracted or something because remember if you're asked I screamed and that's when you came running got it and it came to pass when Joseph heard that I was screaming he left his garment with me and fled and and ran out of the house I screamed so loud he ran out and H and left his clothing behind it's nonsense of course no one heard a scream it was her pre-planned setup to seduce Joseph Joseph expected the servants to be around invisible doing their normal work routine they weren't and Mrs spottier grabbed his skirt and demanded that he be with her he ran off while she clung to his Egyptian cotton Kilt which came off and rabinal Legends asserts was torn and she held on while he pulled away so she kept Joseph's garment by her until potier came home and she spake unto her husband according to these words [Music] say the Hebrew servant which which you brought onto us he came in to mock me what happened it's all your fault poer you brought this disgusting slave into our house and made him your personal servant look what he did when he saw his chance he came on to me that nasty filthy Hebrew it came to pass as I lifted up my voice and screamed he left his garment with me it fled out it came to pass when pfer heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying after this man did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled and Joseph's Master took him and that's for next time what can we take away from this that can help us today Joseph was in a terrible situation he'd been treated evily by his brothers and by the ishmaelites yet he was successful in spite of it all the musicians would would please come Paul tells us in Romans 1221 be not overcome of evil Joseph but overcome evil with good his situation with Mrs P reminds us not only of Solomon's admonition in Proverbs but of the wisdom which Paul expressed in his letter to the Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians 5:22 were told abstain from all appearance of evil don't enable it right Joseph was careful to be sure others were around whenever he was in the house never alone with Mrs P a few verses earlier Paul tells those in thessalonia thessalonica see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you this is good advice we see it at work in Joseph's life in all situations good or bad God's will is that we follow for that which is good that we Rejoice that we pray and that we give thanks even when things seem insurmountable the situation impossible like Joseph is once again facing as we'll see next time let's let's sing as we close and brother Daniel Comes got

other day and we were talking about talking about brother ly's sermon last Wednesday and talking about um what I preached on on Sunday and I said honey these people these prophets these great Servants of God they were just like you and me I said we've learned that and Stephanie said she said but there's one big difference she said they've suffered they suffered a lot more than any of us have ever suffered and you wonder why they had such great character I have nothing else Fit For A King except this Hallelujah imagine Joseph down there in that well imagine Joseph these people that hate hate him not because of because of Joseph but because he was a Hebrew and they were ishmaelites and that rivalry between Isaac and ishmail comes all the way down to today and we see that hatred that that is just as prevalent today as it was when Joseph was there look at what happened in our day brother ly so eloquently said it they said they hate you they hated Joseph and they didn't care if it was 20 pieces of silver they didn't care if if his dad would have paid him more and look what they did a year ago to the Hebrews and look at how they made them suffer and look at look at the the ruthlessness it's not nothing's changed that rivalry is still here brother L thank you so much for showing us that makes it makes makes it so plain these prophets wow what a hard life Mrs P what a nasty woman you know and and what a great young man with with such character and I love what brother Lyall said that Mrs P this probably wasn't her first time Joseph he didn't fall for it God bless his loyal heart that character that is in these prophets I believe we can have that same character we may not suffer as much as they suffer and I know when we suffer boy it's it's hard on us but it does build character I am yeah amen all I have is a Hallelujah to give to the Lord I want to continue on with these great characters in The Bible Well um the L will come to the the last chapter of Joseph the Lord's willing next Wednesday and then we'll start up I might try to pull on brother Aaron a little bit more maybe you can help out in some of these lessons maybe some mothers could help on u in teaching about these these men of God and one thing that's been on my heart and I would like the church um to give me some feedback on this brother Jordan and I were talking before service and uh he told me something that that has been on my heart for a long time and and we did it a little bit on Sunday night but I would like to take a topic that you might not understand that and it could be it could be personal finances it could be music it could be it could be different translations of the Bible something that you don't understand that that would help you if if you did have a better understanding of it why do we do certain things rather Christians do certain things as long as it's bible-based um bring it tell one of the deacons or or tell one of the brothers tell Daniel and get the message to me and maybe we could devote a service here and there a Wednesday night to talking about these questions that you might have these subjects in the Bible and I and I could go through different places um that they are in the Bible and and help you to understand because you got to understand it'll help you and and just because the Pastor said so it doesn't cut it it's because brother brandom said so you need more you need to really understand these things so if you have something on your heart tell one of the brothers and and they can get it to me and give me some time to pray about it and and time to study on it and we can do some of those subjects I I would like um would you like to do that does it sound like a good idea I hope so um if it doesn't it won't do it but I I think um I wish somebody would have I wish I'd have had something like that when I was a kid um and I could just say you know I just I just don't understand I don't understand why we do these things I don't understand where in the Bible are my are is and divorce how come we don't believe in divorce we see it in Deuteronomy we see it in different places why do we not believe in it you know when I'm when I'm when I want to get married what type of a of a man or what type of a woman should I marry and where is that in the Bible whatever it is it's on your heart and I know that I know we'll be blessed by the brothers and bringing out these different characters in The Bible and I I want to be a good pastor I want to be able to show you these things in God's word Amen brother Josiah
