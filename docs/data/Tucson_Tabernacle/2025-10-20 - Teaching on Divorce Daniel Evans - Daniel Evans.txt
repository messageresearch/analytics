[0:00] Pray.
[0:02] Father. Glory to your name.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're so thankful, Father. We're so
[0:07] thankful for your goodness, Lord. We're
[0:10] thankful for the strength that you have
[0:11] given us. Lord, we're thankful for your
[0:14] word. We're thankful for each other.
[0:18] Thankful for your spirit. Father, we
[0:20] pray that you would join us tonight once
[0:22] again.
[0:24] Father, be with us as we open up the
[0:27] Bible and the scriptures. And Lord, give
[0:29] us the wisdom. Give me the wisdom to
[0:32] minister it according to your perfect
[0:35] will in Jesus name. Amen. Praise God.
[0:39] You can be seated.
[0:44] You know, I feel good. I feel really
[0:47] good tonight. And uh I did just drink a
[0:50] Celsius that Daniel had in the back.
[0:53] [Laughter]
[0:55] So So if I talk fast, it was good. I'm
[0:58] not used to that uh artificial
[1:01] stimulant. Um but I, you know, I was
[1:06] after after this morning's service,
[1:09] I was kind of down. And I was just
[1:10] really struggling
[1:12] like u like sometimes you do, you know,
[1:15] you get down and and I was telling a
[1:18] couple people today, Sister Esther, I
[1:20] was telling you and I was telling some
[1:21] others that a spirit
[1:27] has a way of acting and it could be the
[1:31] Holy Spirit of God or it could be an
[1:34] evil spirit from the devil.
[1:37] But a spirit acts different than a flesh
[1:41] and blood person. A spirit comes and it
[1:46] goes.
[1:47] Like when at the very beginning of the
[1:50] Bible it says, "And the spirit of God
[1:52] moved across the face of the deep. It
[1:56] moved and then it comes back."
[2:00] When Jesus when he was being tormented,
[2:02] when he was being tempted by the devil,
[2:04] the enemy's spirit moved on Jesus and
[2:08] then it went away for a little while.
[2:12] And that's how spirits are. They come
[2:14] and they go. And that's how with with
[2:15] the Holy Spirit, we can feel we can just
[2:17] feel that presence of God and we we want
[2:21] it to be there all the time. And we set
[2:24] that standard of it being there all the
[2:26] time. But that's not how the spirit
[2:28] works.
[2:29] It comes and it goes. And that's how the
[2:34] enemy spirit is too. It will it will
[2:36] press on you and press on you and press
[2:38] on you and then it will pull back.
[2:41] And like I said with Jesus, it stayed
[2:44] there for a season. It didn't go away
[2:46] completely when Jesus overcame it. It
[2:50] says and the spirit went away for a
[2:52] season.
[2:54] And for us and and this this afternoon I
[2:57] was just really struggling. I was down
[3:00] and just had a lot of anxiety. And I I
[3:03] called I I texted a friend of mine. You
[3:06] remember when Daniel when in the Bible
[3:09] when the king made the decree and and
[3:14] said, you know, kill all the wise men if
[3:16] you can't tell me my dream. And then
[3:17] what did Daniel do? Daniel called his
[3:19] friends Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo.
[3:22] and he said, "Hey, pray for me." So, I
[3:24] texted a friend who I know loves me very
[3:27] much and I know that he prays and that's
[3:30] Lionel Salazar. And I said, "Hey, bro."
[3:33] I said, "Uh,
[3:35] um, pray for me. I'm struggling this
[3:38] afternoon." And he did. And wow, it just
[3:43] left me just that spirit. And I just
[3:46] feel so good tonight. It's so important
[3:49] that we pray for each other, friends. It
[3:51] is. It is vital and it works. I'm a
[3:54] testimony today. It worked. Brother
[3:56] Lionel prayed for me and I feel great. I
[4:00] feel just I feel really really good and
[4:02] ready to ready to minister tonight.
[4:05] Let's go back to this question. Matthew
[4:07] chapter 5 on marriage and divorce. I
[4:10] want to read these stats again. The
[4:12] divorce rate for first marriages in the
[4:14] United States is 41%.
[4:16] So almost half of first marriages fail.
[4:19] Divorce rates for second marriages is
[4:21] 63%.
[4:24] Over over 70% of third marriages end in
[4:29] divorce.
[4:31] Just those stats say make the first one
[4:34] work.
[4:36] And obviously
[4:38] if
[4:40] you when you get married, no one goes
[4:44] to the altar with failure in mind.
[4:49] But these things should be approached
[4:51] and and when you read when I marry
[4:53] people, I I read the scripture should or
[4:56] the the saying that it says that these
[4:58] things should be approached prayerfully
[5:01] and in reverence in marrying because
[5:05] if you make the wrong marry the wrong
[5:08] person, it's a very difficult life
[5:10] ahead.
[5:12] Divorce rate among Protestant Christians
[5:14] is 51%.
[5:16] And national average is 41%. Why among
[5:19] Protestant Christians is the is the
[5:21] divorce rate so high? It's because that
[5:25] they lump in anyone that that calls
[5:27] themselves a Christian, not Catholic,
[5:30] and say that they are a Christian. It
[5:33] puts them all together and they're not
[5:35] committed to their their faith. So
[5:38] really, why would they be committed to
[5:40] their marriage?
[5:42] They fail. Those marriages fail more
[5:45] often than not. But if you drill down to
[5:47] the more
[5:49] consecrated ones, the ones that actually
[5:51] attend church, that actually are part of
[5:54] a church and have this community of a
[5:56] church. Now it drops from 51 to the
[6:00] national average of 41, it drops down to
[6:02] 28% of marriages fail.
[6:06] And the stats for the Catholics, 19%.
[6:11] And it's because they have a support
[6:14] structure. They have people that care
[6:17] about them. They have a priest that will
[6:21] counsel them through these things. Then
[6:24] when you get down to the Jehovah
[6:26] Witnesses and and the Mormons, it's all
[6:28] the way down to 9%.
[6:30] It shows that dedication dedication
[6:34] to a marriage will help and attending
[6:39] church will greatly help your union. It
[6:43] will greatly help your family. So a
[6:47] successful marriage,
[6:49] you're four times more likely to have a
[6:51] successful marriage really if you are
[6:54] devoted
[6:56] to a church.
[6:59] And that church preaches against
[7:01] divorce.
[7:03] And this church preaches against
[7:05] divorce.
[7:09] So, um, I want to I want to go back to
[7:13] this sermon on the mount
[7:15] and let's read what Jesus said. And I
[7:18] think that I can I can get done with
[7:20] this. I think we'll probably be about 30
[7:23] minutes. Matthew 5:31. If you can put
[7:26] that up there.
[7:28] We read it this morning. I'm read it
[7:30] again. Jesus speaking. He said, "It has
[7:33] been said that whosoever shall put away
[7:34] his wife, let him give her a writing of
[7:36] divorcement."
[7:38] And I'm I'm going to be reading most of
[7:40] the time from the New King James
[7:42] Version. Um I'll stick with the Old King
[7:44] James from Matthew. So Jesus says again,
[7:47] it has been said. So he's referring to
[7:49] Old Testament scriptures and doctrine.
[7:54] Now he is referring to
[7:58] this writing of divorcement. I want to
[8:01] read it again. I read the New King James
[8:04] Version of Deuteronomy, chapter 24. And
[8:07] Sister Rachel, you're doing a great job.
[8:08] I didn't give you any scriptures, but
[8:10] you're doing a good job. And uh we will
[8:14] uh um continue on with these scriptures.
[8:16] Deuteronomy chapter 24 verse one. When a
[8:20] man takes a wife and marries her and it
[8:22] happens that she finds no favor in his
[8:24] eyes because he has found some
[8:26] uncleanness or indecency in her and he
[8:30] writes her a certificate of divorce,
[8:32] puts it in her hand and sends her out of
[8:35] his house when she has departed from his
[8:38] house and goes and becomes another man's
[8:40] wife. If the latter husband detests her
[8:44] and writes her a certificate of divorce,
[8:47] this lady can't win, and puts it into
[8:50] her hand
[8:52] and sends her out of his house, or if
[8:54] the latter husband dies, who took her as
[8:57] a wife, then the former husband who
[8:59] divorced her must not take her back to
[9:02] be wife after she has been defiled,
[9:04] after she has slept with this other man.
[9:07] For that is an for that is an
[9:08] abomination before the Lord. and you
[9:11] shall not bring sin on the land which
[9:13] the Lord your God has given you as an
[9:16] inher inheritance.
[9:18] Other prophets have referred back
[9:21] to that writing in Deuteronomy. Jeremiah
[9:25] referred back to that
[9:27] um and saying that that this is this is
[9:32] true and and and using that as a a
[9:35] reference. I was on a plane one time.
[9:38] Oh, we were going either to Los Angeles
[9:40] or from Los Angeles. I've never gone to
[9:43] Los Angeles. I just hopped from Los
[9:46] Angeles. It's not a place I ever really
[9:47] wanted to go. But uh Stephanie and I
[9:50] were on a plane and we were sitting I
[9:53] believe um I was sitting on one side of
[9:56] the aisle, she was sitting on the other
[9:57] side of an aisle of the aisle and then
[9:59] there was an open seat and some lady
[10:04] came back during the flight and she sits
[10:07] next to me
[10:09] and
[10:11] she says,
[10:14] "Um,
[10:15] I wanted to see
[10:18] what I was missing. And I looked at her,
[10:21] I said, "I don't know what you're
[10:22] talking about. My wife's right here."
[10:25] And and she was she was like, "No, no, I
[10:27] wanted to see. I felt like something
[10:28] told me to go sit in that open seat."
[10:32] And I said,
[10:34] "Well, what's on your mind?"
[10:38] And she says, "Well," she says,
[10:41] "Church."
[10:44] and she didn't know me. She had no idea
[10:47] who I was or anything. She just came
[10:49] down and sat down. Something led her to
[10:51] sit next to me. And she she said,
[10:55] "I uh my husband left me."
[10:58] And we got, you know, we got in these
[11:00] fights and stuff. He didn't leave her,
[11:01] but they they they split up. They
[11:03] divorced. And of course, it was his
[11:05] fault um because I was talking to her
[11:08] and
[11:09] you know how it is. and and she uh she
[11:12] said so she says I don't know what to
[11:14] do. She says my pastor
[11:18] told me
[11:20] that if my husband
[11:23] writes me a note
[11:26] that says that he releases me that I am
[11:31] able to go and marry someone else.
[11:35] And she says that's what the Bible says.
[11:37] This is the strangest thing. I mean, I'm
[11:39] sitting here, this lady comes and sits
[11:40] next to me and says, "I I need to talk
[11:42] to you about marriage." I'm like,
[11:43] "What?" Um, and she quotes, her pastor
[11:49] had quoted this Deuteronomy to her and
[11:52] said, "Yeah, it's okay if you want to go
[11:53] get remarried as long as he writes you a
[11:56] letter of divorce." This what Moses is
[11:59] talking about, it's modern, pure
[12:03] divorce. That that simple. And I I
[12:07] mentioned irreconcilable differences is
[12:09] what most people say. When you are
[12:12] married, you are going to have
[12:14] irreconcilable differences. There are
[12:18] going to be things that you and your
[12:19] husband have difficulty agreeing on. It
[12:23] could be church. It could be money. It
[12:27] could it could be anything.
[12:30] There are going to be things in your
[12:32] marriage, but those are not reasons for
[12:33] divorce.
[12:35] I was talking to brother John, sister
[12:38] Ann, sister. Oh, no. Uh, they're here.
[12:42] Um, I've already gone too far down. I
[12:45] dove in the water. Um, she I knew you
[12:48] were here. I was just kidding. Um, so,
[12:51] Brother John, I was telling I was
[12:53] talking about the irreconcilable
[12:55] differences and we were kind of laughing
[12:56] about it and and brother John said,
[13:00] "This is how he usually handles things."
[13:02] And sister Anne quoted brother John. She
[13:04] said, "Brother John says that, well, I
[13:08] when you have a difference, I could
[13:09] agree with you, but then we'd both be
[13:12] wrong."
[13:21] And that's how it is being married.
[13:23] There are things that you may not agree
[13:25] on, but they are not they are not
[13:28] grounds for divorce.
[13:30] And Jesus is very plain and I'm going to
[13:33] get to the scriptures that say God hates
[13:35] divorce.
[13:36] It's it's not a good thing. So Matthew
[13:40] chapter 5, let's read it again. It has
[13:42] been said that whosoever shall put away
[13:44] his wife, let him give her a writing of
[13:45] divorcement. But I say unto you, we just
[13:48] read that writing of divorcement in
[13:49] Deuteronomy. But I say unto you that
[13:51] whosoever shall put away his wife,
[13:52] saving for the cause of fornication
[13:55] causeth her to commit adultery, and
[13:57] whosoever shall marry her that is
[13:59] divorced committh adultery. Don't forget
[14:01] about the lady sitting next to me on the
[14:03] plane. Okay, I'm going to get back to
[14:05] that story.
[14:07] Matthew chapter 9 verse one. You'll
[14:12] notice after the sermon on the mount,
[14:17] Jesus often goes back to that sermon
[14:23] later on and
[14:27] quotes himself.
[14:29] It's amazing. He will say the exact same
[14:32] thing later on in his ministry that he
[14:36] said on the sermon on the mount. Here is
[14:39] one of those times.
[14:41] Matthew chapter 19 verse one. Now it
[14:43] came to pass when Jesus had finished
[14:45] these sayings that he departed from
[14:47] Galilee and came to the region of Judea
[14:49] beyond Jordan and great multitudes
[14:52] followed him and he healed them there.
[14:55] And the Pharisees also came to him
[14:57] testing him and saying to him is it
[15:01] lawful for a man to divorce his wife for
[15:05] just any reason? For any reason.
[15:09] Now
[15:11] back in that time
[15:15] there was there were two different lines
[15:18] of thinking
[15:20] that was
[15:22] this rabbi named Helil.
[15:26] Helil taught that the liberal
[15:29] interpretation of what Moses said that
[15:33] you can divorce your wife for anything.
[15:35] just write her a writing of divorcement
[15:38] and give it to her and then she's free
[15:41] and you're free. Okay, you can see I
[15:43] read the very thing that they were
[15:46] quoting. You can see how they would
[15:48] think that. And then there was this
[15:51] other rabi ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra
[15:52] ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra rabbi named
[15:53] Shemi
[15:54] and Shmai was saying no no no that's not
[15:57] what Moses meant.
[16:00] Moses was saying that only for the cause
[16:03] of sexual immorality can you marry
[16:06] someone else.
[16:08] That's the only reason. So then there's
[16:11] this big battle going on. And now we see
[16:14] these Pharisees and they know all of
[16:16] this is going on. Of course they're
[16:18] they're part of it and each one of them
[16:19] I'm sure had their own opinion. Now they
[16:21] are saying to Jesus, "Now where do you
[16:24] stand?" All right. So we have to put
[16:27] ourselves in context.
[16:30] And he answered and said to them, "Have
[16:34] you not read that he who made them at
[16:37] the beginning made them male and
[16:38] female?" And said, "For this reason a
[16:41] man shall leave his father and mother
[16:43] and be joined to his wife, and the two
[16:45] shall be one flesh."
[16:49] So then they are no longer two,
[16:53] but one flesh.
[16:55] Therefore, what God has joined together,
[16:58] let let
[17:00] not man put us under. Let no man
[17:02] separate.
[17:05] So, he's telling us, if we are married,
[17:08] make it work. All right?
[17:12] They said to him,
[17:15] why then did Moses command to give it a
[17:18] give a certificate of divorce and to put
[17:20] her away? I just read the certificate of
[17:22] divorce. I just read where they are
[17:24] getting that. This is their
[17:25] justification in saying that. So why did
[17:27] Moses write this certificate of divorce
[17:29] saying that you can divorce her?
[17:34] Ah here is God in flesh speaking. Now
[17:37] this isn't a prophet.
[17:39] This is God made flesh speaking. He had
[17:43] every right
[17:45] to say this. And he said to them,
[17:48] "Moses, because of the hardness of your
[17:50] hearts,
[17:52] permitted you to divorce your wives,
[17:55] but from the beginning it was not so."
[17:57] Remember, he just said God made them
[17:59] male and female in the beginning. He
[18:01] made Adam and Eve. He wanted them
[18:02] together. He didn't want them to split
[18:04] up and and go with other people. Because
[18:07] of the hardness of your heart, he
[18:09] permitted you to divorce your wives.
[18:11] Notice he he said you
[18:15] because this had come down and they had
[18:17] the same spirit as the one the ones that
[18:19] were giving Moses problems at the
[18:20] beginning that didn't want to live with
[18:22] their wives that wanted to get somebody
[18:23] else
[18:25] and just put her away. But he said
[18:27] because of the hardness of your hearts
[18:29] permitted you to divorce your wives but
[18:31] from the beginning it was not so. And I
[18:34] say to you, whoever divorces his wife,
[18:37] except for sexual immorality and marries
[18:39] another commits adultery. And whosoever
[18:42] marries her who is divorced commits
[18:45] adultery.
[18:47] And his disciples said to him, "If such
[18:49] is the case of the man with his wife, it
[18:52] is better not to marry." You can imagine
[18:56] that they're all thinking, "Well, mom
[18:57] and dad were always fighting and and I
[18:59] know this person over here and they they
[19:00] struggled and they they divorced their
[19:02] wives and and you know what? It's better
[19:04] just just leave it alone. I'm not even
[19:06] going to get married." You can see why I
[19:09] don't want to deal with it. And Jesus is
[19:12] saying, he's pointing out all of these
[19:13] problems that can be between a husband
[19:15] and a wife. And the disciples are seeing
[19:17] this and they're like, "Man, I don't
[19:20] even want to get married."
[19:22] But I believe that they were wrong. He
[19:25] still said that God put man and a woman
[19:29] together and it is still a blessing.
[19:35] So his disciples said to him, "If such
[19:37] be the case of the man with his wife, it
[19:40] is better not to marry."
[19:42] When that lady when she came down and
[19:45] she sat next to me,
[19:48] she quoted this writing of divorcement
[19:53] and it's like Lord I have and I remember
[19:56] praying I have no idea.
[19:59] Well, I had an idea but I was like Lord
[20:01] I'm here I am. She comes here she has no
[20:04] idea who I am. She's sitting next to me
[20:07] and she is asking a Bible question. And
[20:10] I told her, I said, "Sister," I said,
[20:11] "no."
[20:13] I said, "Jesus said because of the
[20:15] hardness of their hearts,
[20:19] he allowed that God allowed this that
[20:22] Moses wrote this writing of divorcement,
[20:24] but it wasn't right to do it in the
[20:26] beginning." And I told her, I said,
[20:29] "No." I said, "That's that's not the
[20:30] right way to go."
[20:33] And uh we actually me and Stephanie and
[20:36] her prayed and
[20:39] I don't know what happened but God put
[20:41] me in her way. God put me in her path
[20:45] and if nothing else it was to quote the
[20:47] words of the Lord Jesus.
[20:50] Now again, God gave us marriage as a
[20:54] blessing.
[20:56] And there
[21:00] whenever there's two people involved,
[21:01] there are two different opinions. And
[21:04] there are going to be issues in every
[21:06] single marriage. It's okay. Be a
[21:09] Christian in all things. Put God first
[21:13] and then put the other person above
[21:15] yourself
[21:17] and then the Lord will work it out. God
[21:18] first and then the other person above
[21:21] yourself. But God first.
[21:24] Now 1 Corinthians chapter 7,
[21:27] Paul is talking about the marriage vows.
[21:31] This is beautiful, man. This is this is
[21:34] just
[21:36] I love the way the the wisdom of the
[21:39] Apostle Paul.
[21:41] He says this. Now to the married I
[21:44] command
[21:46] yet not I
[21:49] but the Lord. Okay, this is thus sayaeth
[21:53] the Lord. This is he's saying that God
[21:56] commands this.
[21:59] And to the mar and to the married I
[22:01] command yet not I but the Lord. A wife
[22:06] is not to depart from her husband,
[22:10] but if
[22:12] she departs, let her remain unmarried or
[22:16] be reconciled to her husband.
[22:20] And the husband is not to divorce his
[22:22] wife. So notice Paul is saying, not I,
[22:24] but the Lord, but the Lord. So he's
[22:25] saying that this is the best way to do
[22:27] it. Stay together, but if you separate,
[22:30] don't go and get remarried, but be
[22:32] reconciled to your husband. Okay? So,
[22:35] he's saying that, yeah, you might you
[22:36] might separate for a little while, but
[22:38] don't don't go and and marry someone
[22:41] else because now you're going to ruin
[22:42] your chances of getting back together.
[22:45] Okay? So, that's the best way to do it.
[22:50] But to the rest,
[22:54] I
[22:56] not the Lord. Okay? So, the apostle here
[23:00] is saying the best way would be to make
[23:03] it work. All right.
[23:06] That's that was the Lord. But now
[23:10] this is me speaking
[23:13] and he's he's loves these people and he
[23:16] wants to see them succeed and you see
[23:18] the apostle and he's he's saying here is
[23:20] my advice to you.
[23:23] But to the rest, I not the Lord say, if
[23:27] any brother has a wife who does not
[23:29] believe and she is willing to live with
[23:32] him, let him not divorce her.
[23:37] And a woman who has a husband who does
[23:39] not believe, if he is willing to to live
[23:42] with her, let her not divorce him.
[23:46] I know it's a little different than the
[23:48] King James. This is this is the New King
[23:50] James with our spoken English.
[23:55] For the unbelieving husband is
[23:57] sanctified by the wife and the
[23:59] unbelieving wife is sanctified by the
[24:02] husband. Otherwise your children would
[24:04] be unclean but now now they now they are
[24:07] holy. So what he is saying is that the
[24:09] believing husband can lead his wife to
[24:12] the Lord and vice versa. But he's
[24:15] saying, but listen,
[24:17] don't get married unless you are
[24:19] standing on the same word of God.
[24:23] He's saying that before you get married,
[24:26] make sure you agree on the gospel. Make
[24:28] sure that you have that unity of Jesus
[24:31] Christ in your family because if you
[24:33] marry someone who's not a Christian,
[24:35] you're going to have problems. But this
[24:37] say I not the Lord. If you have done
[24:40] this, if you have already been you've
[24:42] already married and you've married
[24:44] somebody that's not a believer, live
[24:46] with them,
[24:50] but you can lead them to the Lord still.
[24:53] Okay?
[24:54] Now listen to this
[24:57] verse number 15.
[25:00] But if the unbeliever departs, let him
[25:01] depart. A brother or a sister is not
[25:04] under bondage in some caa in such cases.
[25:07] But God called us to peace. Okay.
[25:11] Abandonment.
[25:14] For how do you know, oh wife, whether
[25:16] you whether you will save your husband
[25:19] or how do you know, oh husband, whether
[25:21] you will save your wife? But as God has
[25:23] distributed to each one, as the Lord has
[25:26] called each one, let him walk.
[25:30] This is really good. Let him walk. And
[25:34] all and so I ordain in all the churches.
[25:38] Was anyone called while circumcised?
[25:42] Let him not be.
[25:44] What was anyone called while
[25:46] uncircumcised?
[25:48] All right.
[25:51] Gentile.
[25:52] Someone that doesn't believe
[25:55] like this certain way.
[25:58] Let anyone that was called while they
[26:01] were uncircumcised,
[26:03] let him not become while uncircumcised.
[26:09] Where am I? Let's see. So, it's all I
[26:13] just got a little out of order. And so
[26:16] are in or in all churches. Was anyone
[26:19] called while circumcised? Let him not
[26:21] become uncircumcised. Was anyone called
[26:24] while uncircumcised? Let him not become
[26:27] circumcised.
[26:30] An amazing statement. Pause. Let that
[26:33] cook for a minute.
[26:35] Don't change.
[26:38] If you believe on Jesus Christ,
[26:42] stay
[26:44] the way you are. All right?
[26:47] Circumcision is nothing and
[26:50] uncircumcision is nothing. But keeping
[26:52] the commandments of God is what matters.
[26:56] Let each one remain in the same calling
[26:59] in which he was called.
[27:03] Let me read the new living translation
[27:04] of that and I think that that will
[27:06] explain it. Verse number 17. Each of you
[27:09] should continue to live in whatever
[27:11] situation the Lord has placed you
[27:15] and remain as you were be when God first
[27:18] called you.
[27:20] All right? Remain as you were when God
[27:23] first called you. This is my rule for
[27:25] all the churches. For instance, for
[27:27] instance, he's giving an example here.
[27:29] This isn't categorically. It's not just
[27:31] limited to this. He's making a broad
[27:33] statement. For instance, a man who was
[27:35] circumcised before he became a believer
[27:37] should not try to reverse it. And a man
[27:40] who was uncircumcised when he became a
[27:42] believer should not be circumcised now.
[27:45] For it makes no difference whether or
[27:48] not a man has been circumcised. The
[27:50] important thing is to keep God's
[27:52] commandments.
[27:54] All right. I wrote a quote this morning.
[27:57] I'll read it again. Brother Brandham
[27:59] said, "If you are happy with her,
[28:02] live with her." He was talking to two
[28:04] people that were divorced.
[28:07] All right? And he says this, "If you are
[28:10] happy with her, live with her. Raise
[28:12] your children in the admonition of God.
[28:15] But God be merciful to you if you ever
[28:18] do that again.
[28:20] You teach your children to never do a
[28:22] thing like that. bring them up in the
[28:24] admonition of God.
[28:26] So he's saying the the place where you
[28:29] are, you gave your heart to the Lord,
[28:31] the place where you are, stay where
[28:33] you're at. Don't try to make a change
[28:35] because you'll probably just mess stuff
[28:37] up.
[28:39] Stay there
[28:41] and live for God in the position that
[28:44] you are in.
[28:45] It's beautiful how 1 Corinthians chapter
[28:48] 7 and then that quote from marriage and
[28:50] divorce, boy, they are just
[28:53] Perfectly am I. Now,
[28:58] what about
[29:00] Moses said,
[29:03] "Here's the way to divorce your wife."
[29:06] All right. Here's a way to do it.
[29:10] But Jesus said, "Hey,
[29:13] except for certain circumstances," and
[29:15] Paul said, "Except for very certain
[29:17] circumstances, don't do it." So where is
[29:20] the answer?
[29:22] to it. The answer, let me tell you, I'll
[29:25] I'll speak this way. In general, the
[29:28] answer is to seek God in everything. Get
[29:31] on your knees. Pray about this. Don't
[29:34] make the mistake in the first place for
[29:36] the young people. Make sure that you
[29:38] have the right one. And I think that
[29:41] anyone who has been divorced
[29:44] can tell you, "Brother Daniel is
[29:47] speaking the truth."
[29:49] make for sure of that person.
[29:54] But I think the answer and and that is
[29:56] the answer. But let's go back to the Old
[29:59] Testament in closing
[30:02] to the book of Malachi.
[30:04] And I believe it will tell us here
[30:07] really is how God feels about this. He
[30:11] says, you know, the Apostle Paul said,
[30:13] "Stay where you're at. You're okay.
[30:14] Serve God now. Don't worry about the
[30:16] past. Don't worry about that stuff. Just
[30:18] just now move forward in the spirit.
[30:23] Be a Christian. Okay. That's what the
[30:25] apostle is telling us. You made mistakes
[30:27] in the past. Leave them in the past.
[30:30] Stay where you're at now. All right.
[30:33] Malachi chapter 2 verse number 13. I'll
[30:37] again I'll read the um New King James
[30:40] Version.
[30:44] Malachi 2 verse 13 says this.
[30:49] You know the book of Malachi first,
[30:52] the people
[30:55] were going through the motions of going
[30:57] to church. They were going through the
[30:59] motions of making sacrifices. They were
[31:03] going through the motions of paying
[31:05] their tithes. What they did is they
[31:08] said, "Okay, well, you know, it takes me
[31:12] $1,000 a month or whatever it is to pay
[31:15] my bills." And okay, I have $1,200 or I
[31:19] have I have $1,12.
[31:22] I can take I have 12 bucks extra. I can
[31:24] give that to an offering. I can give
[31:26] that for my tithes.
[31:28] Or they were saying, I have this flock
[31:30] of sheep and and I have all of these
[31:33] good-looking lambs. Oh, here's one
[31:34] that's kind of he's kind of deformed.
[31:35] He's he's not going to be he's not going
[31:37] to sell a lot for at the market. I'll
[31:39] take that one and that will be my
[31:41] sacrifice when I go to the temple.
[31:43] That's what the book of Malachi is
[31:44] about.
[31:46] And there's this back and forth with ma
[31:50] with with God and and the people and God
[31:54] is like, "Listen, you didn't give me
[31:55] your best." And they're like, "Well,
[31:57] what do you mean we didn't give you your
[31:59] best?" And then God will tell them why.
[32:02] And the whole book of Malachi, the whole
[32:04] first part of the book of Malachi is
[32:05] about that. It's like, "Hey, you're
[32:07] giving God the worst.
[32:10] You're not giving him your best." And
[32:12] Malachi chapter 2 is along those lines.
[32:15] And as I said, it's a dialogue back and
[32:18] forth between God and the people.
[32:21] And this second thing to this second
[32:23] thing you do,
[32:25] God is
[32:27] um indicting the people. And this second
[32:31] thing that you do, you cover the altar
[32:33] of the Lord with tears,
[32:37] with weeping and crying.
[32:40] So he does not regard the offering
[32:42] anymore,
[32:44] nor receive it with goodwill from your
[32:46] hands.
[32:48] And yet you say, "For what reason?"
[32:52] So you go to the altar, you're you're
[32:53] doing this big thing and you and and and
[32:55] you're you're crying and you're weeping
[32:57] and he's saying, "You know what? It's
[33:00] nothing."
[33:02] And then you say, "For what reason are
[33:03] you saying that? Because the Lord has
[33:06] been witness between you and your wife.
[33:11] The Lord has been witness between you
[33:13] and the wife of your youth.
[33:16] He's in your home.
[33:20] He's watching you.
[33:22] He knows about all of those things that
[33:25] you've done wrong. He knows about the
[33:27] the the mean things that you say to said
[33:30] to each other. He knows about the
[33:32] indiscretions. He knows about all of
[33:34] these things. And and he says that
[33:36] because the Lord has been a witness
[33:38] between you and the wife of your youth
[33:41] with whom you have dealt treacherously,
[33:45] yet she is your companion
[33:49] and the wife and your wife by covenant.
[33:54] But but did he not make them one?
[33:59] Having a remnant of the spirit? And why
[34:03] one?
[34:05] He seeks godly offspring.
[34:08] Therefore, take heed to your spirit, and
[34:11] let none deal treacherously with the
[34:13] wife of his youth.
[34:16] He's saying, you're in your home.
[34:19] God gave you this wife. He gave you this
[34:23] sweetheart.
[34:25] You need to treat her right. You need to
[34:27] love her. You need to cherish her. And
[34:30] really, I can say this. Say I. Also, the
[34:34] wives for the husbands.
[34:36] Love your husbands. God has given you
[34:39] this. He's it's a gift that you have.
[34:44] And it's just it's it's a wonderful
[34:45] thing that he's given you. And don't
[34:48] take it for granted.
[34:53] And let none deal treacher treacherously
[34:56] with the wife of his youth.
[34:58] For the Lord God of Israel says that he
[35:02] hates divorce.
[35:06] He he says that he hateth the putting
[35:10] away which is divorce.
[35:12] He hates divorce
[35:15] for it covers one's garment with
[35:17] violence, says the Lord of hosts.
[35:19] Therefore, take heed to your spirit
[35:22] that you deal that you do not deal
[35:25] treacherous treacherously.
[35:28] You have wearied the Lord with your
[35:30] words. And yet you say, "In what way
[35:33] have we wearied him?"
[35:36] Malachi, the Lord is saying, "You have
[35:39] we wearied the Lord. You've made me
[35:41] tired of what you're saying."
[35:44] And you say, "Oh, well, how have we made
[35:46] you tired, God? How have we wearied you?
[35:49] And that you say that you say everyone
[35:51] who does evil is good in the sight of
[35:53] the Lord.
[35:56] It's like, oh, everybody's good.
[35:58] Everybody's fine. Everyone who does evil
[36:01] is just fine. And you weary the Lord and
[36:05] he and you say that he is the he
[36:07] delights in them. Or where is the God of
[36:10] just justice of judgment?
[36:12] So, do you see in Malachi,
[36:16] God is saying, "I gave you a spouse.
[36:20] I gave you a blessing. Cherish each
[36:24] other.
[36:26] Don't fight.
[36:28] Don't." He said, he says, "I've watched
[36:31] you. I've watched you in your home. I've
[36:35] watched you in your kitchen. I've
[36:37] watched you in the car on the way to
[36:39] church.
[36:41] I watch you.
[36:43] Don't disrespect each other. Husbands,
[36:46] love your wives.
[36:49] Wives,
[36:51] obey your husbands.
[36:53] This is right in the Lord.
[36:56] Respect one another. And then you go
[36:58] back a few verses. God hates divorce.
[37:05] Sometimes it happens.
[37:08] All right.
[37:10] But it doesn't mean that he likes it.
[37:13] You might be justified
[37:16] in divorcing your wife or your husband,
[37:20] but it's not pleasing to God.
[37:24] You might have to do it,
[37:27] but it's not a joyous thing to the Lord.
[37:31] You see what I'm You see where the word
[37:33] is going with this? And you see how it
[37:35] all makes sense what Jesus said.
[37:38] He says, he says, you know, be well, we
[37:42] well, we say that that we can divorce
[37:44] like the the lady sitting next to me.
[37:46] Well, I can go marry whoever I want
[37:48] because he agreed to it. That's just a
[37:50] modern divorce. And and and Jesus says,
[37:52] no. He says, because of the hardness of
[37:55] your heart, you wouldn't try to work it
[37:56] out.
[37:58] You and Malachi says, you wouldn't give
[38:00] respect to the other one.
[38:03] And then it causes shame and it causes
[38:06] hardship on the families. As I said this
[38:08] morning,
[38:11] when the husband and the wife divorce,
[38:14] it affects the children.
[38:17] It affects the parents of both.
[38:20] It affects the friends
[38:23] and it affects them for the rest of
[38:25] their lives.
[38:27] It's nothing but problems.
[38:30] As I said, I understand
[38:32] sometimes it is justified, but it is
[38:35] never good.
[38:37] You with me? Marriage and divorce is a
[38:40] very, very difficult subject.
[38:43] And it has been a difficult subject when
[38:46] Moses was here. He had to deal with it.
[38:49] And he says, "Here, do it this way. This
[38:51] is the best. You're going to do it
[38:52] anyways. So here, do it this way." And
[38:56] Jesus was like, "Yeah, Moses said that.
[38:58] I understand." And Moses had to do it
[39:00] because of the hardness of your heart
[39:03] because you were going to just you were
[39:05] going to do it anyways.
[39:08] So here is the best way. And then Paul
[39:12] over here, he's saying,
[39:15] listen, choose a believer,
[39:18] marry a Christian.
[39:21] This is what God says. But if you don't,
[39:26] here's the best way to handle it. to say
[39:28] I not the Lord. Do you appreciate
[39:32] for you married people? Do you
[39:33] appreciate your spouse?
[39:35] You should.
[39:41] Yeah, the worship team can come.
[39:45] Zeke was like, "Yeah, I wish I had his
[39:47] spells."
[39:52] You will, man. One day. Just don't go
[39:56] too fast.
[39:59] Friends, the word is so beautiful.
[40:03] It's so lovely. And you see how how that
[40:08] we we um
[40:12] he makes a way of escape. I quoted I
[40:15] quoted the Apostle Paul this morning. I
[40:18] said, "He won't tempt you." Paul said,
[40:20] "He won't tempt you above that which you
[40:22] can bear, but he will make a way of
[40:24] escape. He'll take care of it. But where
[40:27] you are right now, stay in that position
[40:31] and serve God and do well and be happy
[40:34] in what God has given you. And respect,
[40:37] if you're married, respect that spouse,
[40:40] that gift that God has given you.
[40:43] That's the way of the Lord. That is what
[40:45] he wanted. He wants us to be happy. He
[40:48] wants us to be lovely. He wants us to to
[40:51] live in unity in this world.
[40:56] So, do your best to do it. It's a a
[40:58] marriage
[41:01] is a two-way street.
[41:04] Some say it's a two-story house.
[41:07] Her story and his story.
[41:11] That's not the way it is. Well, it is. I
[41:13] mean, we all have our opinions, but a
[41:16] marriage is a union between two souls.
[41:25] And the way to make it work is you have
[41:28] two people, but two is an incomplete
[41:32] number.
[41:33] You have two people. You need the Lord
[41:36] Jesus there. And he is the center of
[41:41] your marriage. He is the center of your
[41:44] relationship. And if you put him first,
[41:47] you can disagree all that you want. You
[41:49] can have all these irreconcilable
[41:50] differences, but you can always come
[41:53] together that the Lord loves us. And you
[41:55] can say, "Sweetheart, and I love you.
[41:59] You are a gift to me." So when you when
[42:03] you are
[42:07] with your spouse and and you might have
[42:10] maybe troubles between each other,
[42:15] go to prayer. Stop. stand back.
[42:20] Go get quiet.
[42:23] Pray for that person. Lord, help my
[42:26] spouse.
[42:27] Help this per help my husband. Help my
[42:30] wife. And then Lord, help me
[42:35] to enter into her suffering or into into
[42:39] his suffering. And then the Lord will
[42:41] show you that this is how they are
[42:44] feeling.
[42:47] Don't you wish that we could always do
[42:49] it that way? We can. We have the
[42:53] opportunity to do it.
[42:55] We just don't because we let our flesh,
[42:57] we let ourselves get in the way. Amen.
[43:00] Let's all stand.
[43:06] We've got the power.
[43:13] And if your husband or wife is sitting
[43:14] next to you, grab their hand as we sing
[43:16] this.
[43:18] Give me your hand.
[43:22] Let's agree together
[43:26] that all of our eneies
[43:31] will crumble at our feet.
[43:36] Whatever we bind on earth shall be bound
[43:41] in heaven.
[43:44] At the name of Jesus,
[43:49] Satan has to flee.
[43:53] We've got the power
[43:58] in the name of Jesus.
