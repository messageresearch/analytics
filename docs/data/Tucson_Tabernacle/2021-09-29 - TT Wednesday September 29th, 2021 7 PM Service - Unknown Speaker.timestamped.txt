[31:48] [Music]
[32:07] i don't sing so
[32:10] spare everybody that
[32:13] while you're standing if you'd open your
[32:14] bibles to the romans the fifth chapter
[32:17] read verses one and two
[32:28] romans chapter 5 starting at verse 1.
[32:36] therefore being justified by faith we
[32:38] have peace with god through our lord
[32:39] jesus christ
[32:41] by whom we have we also have access by
[32:44] faith unto this unto this grace wherein
[32:47] we stand
[32:48] and rejoice in the hope
[32:50] of the glory of god
[32:52] let's just pray
[32:55] our most gracious and loving heavenly
[32:57] father
[32:58] it is always our privilege
[33:00] to gather ourselves together round your
[33:02] word
[33:04] to quieten our hearts and our minds and
[33:06] sing songs of worship and praise unto
[33:08] you because lord you're worthy of all
[33:10] those things
[33:11] but then lord we come to the time in the
[33:13] service when we want to hear from you
[33:17] you've chosen to speak through men but
[33:19] lord
[33:20] it's our desire as men as ministers of
[33:22] the gospel to let it not be our thoughts
[33:25] and our words but lord let it be yours
[33:28] so use me lord this evening as your
[33:30] servant
[33:32] move me aside guide the thoughts of my
[33:33] mind
[33:34] that the words that are spoken lord may
[33:36] they glorify you
[33:38] grant this lord for i ask it in jesus
[33:40] christ's name
[33:41] amen
[33:42] you can be seated
[33:48] over the last
[33:50] couple of years god's been dealing with
[33:52] me in different ways
[33:55] but i came across this verse in romans
[33:57] and it says therefore being justified by
[33:59] faith which we are we are peace
[34:03] and sometimes i look at my own life and
[34:05] there's a struggle
[34:08] because sometimes i'm never quite sure
[34:10] of my relationship if you will with my
[34:13] with god
[34:15] because i keep looking at myself
[34:18] i have false shortcomings i know you
[34:20] don't but but but i do and i'll make up
[34:22] for all of yours
[34:24] but it comes down to the place when i
[34:26] was reading this in in romans 5
[34:29] it talks about having faith
[34:31] it talks about taking what god has said
[34:34] and actually believing it
[34:36] when it says we're justified it means
[34:39] you're without sin
[34:41] you stand as righteous and pure as god
[34:43] himself is
[34:44] and that's awful hard for most of us to
[34:46] accept
[34:48] but in reality that's how god views us
[34:51] when adam and eve sinned in the garden
[34:53] what happened
[34:54] god went and he took two animals he
[34:56] killed those animals he skinned them
[34:59] then he took the skin to those animals
[35:00] and gave it unto his children
[35:02] and so whenever god looked at them what
[35:04] did he see he saw the sacrifice that he
[35:07] himself had made for them
[35:09] and so whenever he looked upon them he
[35:11] had to be reminded blood was shed
[35:14] blood was said in order to take and
[35:16] cover their sins and and to re-establish
[35:18] the relationship that god desired to
[35:21] have with him with them
[35:23] and sometimes we forget the fact you
[35:25] know god desires our fellowship more
[35:27] than we often desire his
[35:30] but it comes down to the place where we
[35:32] have to be able to accept what god has
[35:34] said to to us
[35:36] in our christian life seems to be a
[35:37] struggle for most people
[35:39] but i believe it's because we are not
[35:41] willing to rest in the promises god has
[35:43] given to us
[35:45] because if we have the faith to believe
[35:48] if
[35:49] faith is not believing for someone or
[35:51] for something
[35:53] but faith is believing in someone
[35:56] and if we have the faith to believe in
[35:58] the god that we claim to serve
[36:01] and we believe that he's faithful and
[36:02] just to forgive us of our sins that
[36:04] we've if we believe that he's faithful
[36:06] to honor his word if we believe that
[36:08] he's faithful to take care of us and
[36:10] watch over his children
[36:11] if we can if we can never come to the
[36:13] place of of of taking our our lives and
[36:16] placing them in his hands
[36:18] and then we can be at rest
[36:21] i i know it it's i mean coming to this
[36:24] place of rest i mean it's
[36:26] it's it's there's no there's no longer a
[36:28] struggle in our lives
[36:30] yeah i mean we struggle day by day we
[36:32] have our problems we have our
[36:33] shortcomings we have
[36:35] areas that okay we we're constantly
[36:37] battling we're constantly trying to
[36:38] overcome but see god has made god has
[36:42] provided a way
[36:43] when we look at the at the bible the
[36:45] bible is the history of the book of
[36:47] redemption
[36:48] redemption it means restoring us back to
[36:51] our rightful position with our father in
[36:54] the beginning you were a part of god you
[36:55] were part of god from the beginning
[36:57] brother branham makes that statement
[36:59] more often more times
[37:00] quite often anyway
[37:02] because he says you have to if you're a
[37:04] part of god now you had to be a part of
[37:06] god then if you weren't of card of god
[37:08] then he says there's no way for you to
[37:10] ever be a part of him
[37:11] and because you are a part of him he
[37:13] says god has provided a means of
[37:15] salvation to to take us and restore us
[37:18] into our position that we should
[37:19] rightfully have with him and we have our
[37:22] f and our father loves us
[37:25] you know it's interesting when you he
[37:26] knew you before before the foundations
[37:28] of the world
[37:30] he knew what you would be liking brother
[37:31] brown says he knew the color of your
[37:32] hair how high or how big you'd get and
[37:35] your your hair color he knew what you
[37:37] would be like as you were going through
[37:39] your childhood you know the mistakes
[37:41] that you'd make he knew your attitudes
[37:43] and what you would make what the
[37:44] mistakes you would make as a teenager
[37:47] he knows the mistakes that you made
[37:49] today
[37:50] he knows the mistakes she'll make
[37:51] tomorrow
[37:53] but he loved you
[37:55] and when when we were in sin he died for
[37:58] you
[37:59] greater love had no man than this than a
[38:01] man would lay down his life for his
[38:03] friends but here again it comes down to
[38:05] the place we have to we have to be
[38:07] willing to come to the grasp and
[38:08] actually believe this
[38:10] it has to be more than just words on a
[38:12] piece of paper it asks me more than just
[38:14] a nice sermon that somebody preached now
[38:17] that has to come to the place in our
[38:18] lives this becomes a reality to us
[38:22] you know a couple of years back i i did
[38:24] a study in a book called habakkuk
[38:27] it's only three chapters long very short
[38:30] but you know habakkuk lived in the time
[38:32] when
[38:33] when when uh
[38:35] during the time of jeremiah just before
[38:36] the destruction of jerusalem
[38:39] and god had showed him
[38:41] him being a prophet god had shown to him
[38:43] the hypocrisy of the priesthood he
[38:46] showed them the lives of the people that
[38:47] were there that oh yeah we you've got to
[38:49] bring another sacrifice well yeah i
[38:51] think this one might do hopefully the
[38:53] priests will accept it if not i'll bribe
[38:55] them maybe
[38:56] you know they would go but their worship
[38:57] was not sincere
[38:59] it was just it was a formality that they
[39:01] went through
[39:03] but see too often in our christian life
[39:05] in too many churches
[39:08] coming to church is a formality
[39:10] it's something we do because well yeah
[39:12] it's sunday i guess i better go
[39:14] otherwise pastor is going to preach
[39:15] against me this time or else can you
[39:17] come come to wednesday well you have
[39:19] nothing better to do so i guess i'll
[39:20] come to church you know
[39:22] but see there has to be the time there
[39:24] has to be the desire to come
[39:26] there has to be the desire to worship
[39:28] there has to be something within our
[39:30] heart that desires to draw ourselves
[39:32] closer
[39:33] to god
[39:35] so havoc lived during this time and
[39:36] after god had showed him all these
[39:38] things
[39:39] god's
[39:40] habit because lord why don't you bring a
[39:42] judgment why don't you bring
[39:43] condemnation to these people
[39:45] and god says okay i think i will i'll
[39:47] bring the chaldeans which are the
[39:48] assyrians
[39:50] or that maybe those anyway
[39:53] but habakkuk didn't like that answer
[39:54] because he was afraid for himself
[39:58] if all of a sudden the nation or the
[39:59] city is is invaded and the and the
[40:02] soldiers come going through the city
[40:04] they kill because they enjoy killing
[40:07] they they would they would kill men
[40:08] women children young old it didn't
[40:10] matter to them they did it because
[40:11] that's what they like to do and because
[40:13] the more that they killed the more
[40:14] spoiled they could take and that's how
[40:15] they that's how they made their living
[40:19] and so havoca became disturbed at this
[40:21] and then god began to answer him
[40:23] and have a good two and four says behold
[40:25] the soul which is lifted up is not
[40:27] upright in him but the just
[40:29] shall live by his faith
[40:31] and that's where paul gets in this thing
[40:32] and the just being justified by faith
[40:34] this is the reference it goes back to is
[40:36] back in habakkuk
[40:38] and it's interesting the way that the
[40:40] wording is here it says it says it talks
[40:42] about he whose soul is not right in he
[40:46] he whose soul is lifted up is not
[40:47] upright in him in other words from what
[40:50] i was able to understand from the
[40:51] commentary i read
[40:53] it talks about a man that is
[40:54] self-reliant talks about a man i can do
[40:57] this myself
[40:58] i don't need god's help
[41:00] and so he says yeah oh there's a there's
[41:03] an invasion coming fine i've survived a
[41:05] few other ones yeah i can survive this
[41:07] one you know yeah i'll just make
[41:08] preparations i'll take care of it and i
[41:10] can do this by myself
[41:12] but but see god says okay if you're
[41:15] going to do it by yourself he says you
[41:16] don't need my help i'll just take my
[41:17] hands off and good luck
[41:20] but it says this but he says the the the
[41:24] but it says the just shall live by his
[41:26] faith
[41:27] and this is an interesting wording in
[41:29] here and the faith that it talks about
[41:31] here is a total dependence between the
[41:33] creature and the creator
[41:35] it's not where you get where you say
[41:37] well i can do this by myself no it comes
[41:39] to the beyond that place it says lord he
[41:41] says without you he says i can't do
[41:43] anything lord without you i need your
[41:45] assistance i mean we got up this morning
[41:48] why because god woke you up
[41:51] you have no guarantee for tomorrow
[41:53] you have no guarantee for anything
[41:56] i mean our illustrious president can
[41:58] sign a declaration or whatever like that
[41:59] he can shut the whole country down and
[42:01] overnight we factor he may be already
[42:03] doing that we don't know this
[42:06] i mean our last president shut it down
[42:07] for how many months
[42:09] so we have no guarantee for tomorrow we
[42:11] have no guarantee for our jobs we have
[42:12] no guarantee for anything but it comes
[42:15] down to the place if we put our faith
[42:17] and our trust in god god has guaran god
[42:19] had said he will watch over us and he
[42:20] will provide for us and he will take
[42:22] care of you and this is what god was
[42:24] trying to impress upon habakkuk because
[42:26] habakkuk maybe he was going to be
[42:28] self-reliant maybe even even the
[42:30] relationship that he had with god
[42:33] yet he was had to come to he had to come
[42:35] to the place in his relationship with
[42:37] god where he would trust god literally
[42:39] for everything
[42:41] and this is what god's been dealing with
[42:42] me over the last couple years that's
[42:44] that's why this scripture has meant so
[42:46] much to me
[42:49] but you know when we when we when we
[42:52] jesus christ gave a parable in luke the
[42:54] 18th chapter
[42:56] and he talks about two people went into
[42:58] that went into the temple to pray says
[42:59] one was a pharisee one was a publican
[43:02] now the pharisee were the righteous or
[43:03] the righteous they figured they kept the
[43:05] law
[43:06] the public and on the other hand was a
[43:08] tax collector he would collect money
[43:10] from his own people and give it to the
[43:11] roman government so he was basically he
[43:13] was a traitor to his own people
[43:16] but the pharisee would go in and says oh
[43:18] i thank god that i'm not like all the
[43:19] other people
[43:20] he said i fast twice in a week i i give
[43:23] tithes of all that i possess and i'm
[43:24] sure he had a whole list of things he
[43:26] was telling god how great he was
[43:29] but then when we look at the public and
[43:30] he said he said he was a standing afar
[43:32] off would not lift up so much as his
[43:34] eyes to heaven
[43:35] but smote upon his breast saying god be
[43:37] merciful to me a sinner
[43:40] and the scofield notes it says be to me
[43:43] be toward me as thou are when you're
[43:45] looking upon the atoning blood
[43:47] in other words don't look at me because
[43:48] i have nothing to offer you but what i
[43:50] want to do i want you to look upon the
[43:52] blood that's been placed upon the mercy
[43:53] seat
[43:55] because the public can realize that's
[43:57] the only hope that he had
[43:59] you know we sing songs about the cross
[44:02] but see it's in the cross everything
[44:03] that you have need of that's where
[44:05] you'll find it
[44:06] the stripes laid on his back you has
[44:08] already healed you but you have to
[44:11] accept that you have to believe that
[44:13] if i mean we all make our mistakes so
[44:15] what do we do we so we go to the we go
[44:17] there before god we confess him he says
[44:19] he's faithful and just to forgive us of
[44:21] all of our sins and to cleanse us from
[44:22] all unrighteousness but see it talks it
[44:25] there it's a relationship here that
[44:26] we're looking at
[44:28] jesus said that he said i tell you
[44:30] talking about the public and this man
[44:32] went down to his house justified rather
[44:33] than the other for everyone that exalts
[44:35] themselves shall be abased
[44:38] but say here again it's how do you
[44:39] approach god
[44:42] whenever i whenever i pray i realize i'm
[44:44] approaching not only my not only god but
[44:46] he's my father
[44:48] when i was i was making that statement
[44:50] once and i was preaching something and
[44:52] all of a sudden i there was a scripture
[44:53] there it says and he's god has given you
[44:56] the holy spirit because god is your
[44:57] father
[44:58] and as i was preaching all of a sudden i
[45:00] thought about that as i was preaching
[45:03] god actually is my father
[45:07] my earthly parents gave me this
[45:08] tabernacle i live in
[45:10] but yet i was a part of god from the
[45:12] beginning in the process of time i came
[45:14] into manifestation and god has a plan
[45:17] for my life just as he has a plan for
[45:18] all of your lives
[45:20] you don't know what your plan is and
[45:22] maybe you you haven't fulfilled it maybe
[45:24] god will reveal it later on or maybe you
[45:26] are fulfilling it now i mean i don't
[45:27] know
[45:28] but it has to come to the place in our
[45:30] lives we have to accept that god
[45:32] actually is my father
[45:34] and if we accept the fact that god is
[45:36] your father then there's certain there's
[45:38] certain privileges which goes along with
[45:40] with that with that with with you being
[45:42] his son or his daughter
[45:44] you know when we look at when we go into
[45:46] the bible and we look at elisha
[45:49] and he was there and the king of syria
[45:51] was sitting there waging war against the
[45:53] nation of israel
[45:55] or was judah at that point
[45:57] anyway he goes in
[45:59] and the prophet was there and he would
[46:00] tell the king he says don't go by this
[46:02] way the king of syria is sitting there
[46:05] and the king of syria was waiting for
[46:06] the people to come by or for the army or
[46:08] something like that then they moved to
[46:10] another place another place and somebody
[46:12] and so the king of of of syria has he
[46:15] says who is a traitor in my in my midst
[46:17] who is telling the king of israel he
[46:19] says where you were living and where
[46:21] we're camping
[46:22] and when guy says oh yes you don't
[46:24] understand he says there's a prophet in
[46:25] the land and god is showing that prophet
[46:28] well where is he at well he's in dothan
[46:31] so that that that night they packed up
[46:33] they went around oath and they
[46:34] surrounded the city
[46:35] and so all of it and so in the morning
[46:37] elijah
[46:38] as he lied your elijah kept the two
[46:40] mixed up but anyway he said he said well
[46:43] go get me my breakfast
[46:45] and so the servant went up there and all
[46:47] of a sudden he looked over the wall of
[46:48] the city
[46:49] and says oh my
[46:51] he said all the syrian army is camped
[46:53] around about us so he went running back
[46:54] to the prophet
[46:56] and and the and the prophet says well
[46:58] where's my breakfast he says no you
[47:00] don't understand we're surrounded by the
[47:02] army he says they're going to invade the
[47:03] city and we're all going to die
[47:05] he said no we're not he said there's
[47:07] more with us than there is with all of
[47:08] with all of them
[47:10] and the pride and the servant would look
[47:12] at you and me and me and you
[47:15] you me me you
[47:18] um
[47:19] and so the prophet said lord open his
[47:21] eyes and all around the hills with
[47:23] chariots of fire and angels and all the
[47:25] other stuff
[47:27] the servant did not realize the position
[47:29] that he had
[47:31] but the prophet did
[47:33] but see we have to come to the same
[47:34] realization of ourselves if god is our
[47:36] father god will protect us god will
[47:38] guide us and he he will he he will watch
[47:41] over us and he becomes our provider he
[47:43] becomes our protector
[47:45] you have because you are a son and a son
[47:47] and daughter of god you have access to
[47:49] everything god is
[47:52] god will bankrupt heaven i think brother
[47:53] branham says before he'll let one of his
[47:55] promises to one of his children fail
[47:58] but you have to accept the promise
[48:01] you have to come to the realization in
[48:03] your life god made the promise to you
[48:06] often we say oh yeah god heals and
[48:07] that's great
[48:09] but you have to come down to the place
[48:10] by his stripes i am healed and you have
[48:13] to take the promise and make it personal
[48:14] to yourself because once you make it
[48:16] personal to yourself then god is
[48:18] obligated to you to fulfill that promise
[48:21] but then if you have the faith to
[48:23] believe in him then what you do is after
[48:24] you've asked for ask for healing then
[48:26] you wait you rest
[48:28] waiting for the fulfillment of that
[48:30] promise
[48:31] but see this is the way our christian
[48:33] life should be
[48:34] it should not be a struggle of wondering
[48:36] today what's going to happen today or
[48:37] wondering what's going to happen
[48:39] tomorrow and you know oh lord we're all
[48:41] in a turmoil we don't know what's going
[48:42] to we don't know what's going to happen
[48:44] within our country
[48:46] but yet if we rest in him
[48:49] tomorrow doesn't matter
[48:52] because he's already been there
[48:54] he already knows what you're going to
[48:55] face tomorrow he already knows the
[48:57] trials the trump troubles and the things
[48:59] that they're going to that are going to
[49:00] come your way and if you can believe god
[49:03] if you can put your faith and trust in
[49:05] him then he then you can rest in the god
[49:07] that has called you
[49:14] you know brother browner makes an
[49:15] interesting statement in ministry
[49:17] explain
[49:18] somebody says
[49:19] how does divine healing is it does it
[49:22] last all the time
[49:23] brother rams it lasts just as long as
[49:25] faith lasts
[49:27] and salvation lasts the same way just as
[49:30] long as faith lasts when you when you
[49:32] feel that you're not saved anymore
[49:34] he said then you're not saved
[49:37] and sometimes brother branham in his own
[49:39] life he says there are times i don't
[49:41] feel like i'm saved
[49:43] but he says i have to go back to what
[49:45] the scripture says and because i have
[49:47] fulfilled the requirements of the
[49:48] scriptures by that basis by the basis of
[49:50] the word of god and his faith in that
[49:52] word he says on that basis i am saved
[49:55] it can't it can be on your emotions it
[49:58] can't be on the circumstances that
[49:59] you're in no it has to come between a
[50:02] relationship between you and between god
[50:05] too often when we get into this message
[50:07] it's all intellectual stuff
[50:10] oh we have to understand the deepest the
[50:12] mysteries oh we have to understand the
[50:13] revelation of the seven seals oh we have
[50:16] to understand where
[50:17] the time frame we're in we have to
[50:18] understand the spoken word we have to
[50:20] understand the ten vision we have to
[50:22] that's nonsense
[50:24] what you have to have is a personal
[50:26] relationship with jesus christ
[50:29] because that is what will sustain you
[50:32] the rest of the stuff won't having an
[50:34] intellectual knowledge of stuff doesn't
[50:36] help you
[50:36] no it's a faith relationship it's you
[50:39] coming to a time between you and god
[50:41] where you are in a personal personal
[50:43] relationship with him
[50:47] it's like when you look at abraham
[50:50] god
[50:52] god spoke to abraham we don't know what
[50:54] what age he was then
[50:56] but his father decided to to do and god
[50:58] told him he says you have to leave the
[51:00] place of your nativity your friends your
[51:02] family and everything else
[51:04] and then his father decided to move from
[51:06] where they were and go to a place called
[51:08] heron
[51:09] well god had to take abraham's father
[51:11] home
[51:12] so that abraham would continue on and
[51:14] come down into the palace into the
[51:16] promised land
[51:18] but then when he got into the promised
[51:19] land god says ah this is the land that i
[51:21] promised you this is the land i was
[51:22] leading you to
[51:24] but there was a famine going on at that
[51:25] point in time
[51:27] so abraham looked around and says well
[51:29] maybe the promised land but right now
[51:32] it's in trouble
[51:33] so what did he do he journeyed on down
[51:35] into egypt but see egypt to me speaks of
[51:38] the world it talks about self-reliance
[51:40] it talks about you're going to do it
[51:42] yourself you're where you're relying
[51:44] upon yourself so god had to bring
[51:46] circumstances to pass to force abraham
[51:48] out of egypt and take him back up to the
[51:50] promised land
[51:52] then god had to create circumstances
[51:53] where lot and abraham would separate it
[51:55] wasn't until lot and abraham separated
[51:58] that all of a sudden god could fulfill
[52:00] the promise that he had made unto
[52:01] abraham
[52:03] but all the time that abraham lived in
[52:04] that land it wasn't always easy
[52:08] but see during the time that abraham
[52:10] lived there he got to he to see the hand
[52:12] of god in his life he got to be re he
[52:15] got he began to realize that okay god is
[52:17] the one he provided for me today he'll
[52:19] provide for me tomorrow well we're in a
[52:21] famine but god brought the rain so now
[52:23] we can feed our sheep and our cattle and
[52:24] all the other types of things
[52:26] abraham had to learn over time to
[52:28] believe god
[52:30] until one time abraham came into god and
[52:33] key questioned
[52:35] he says he says you keep promising me a
[52:37] son i'm to be a father of many nations
[52:40] but i have no children
[52:42] so that that means
[52:45] eleazar is going to inherit everything
[52:48] and god says no i promise it through
[52:50] sarah
[52:51] and abraham says how do i know you're
[52:53] going to fulfill this
[52:55] so god had to come to abraham and says
[52:56] okay you have a way in your country
[52:58] during your time in to make a covenant
[53:01] so you go ahead you take the animal you
[53:03] kill that you kill the beast you split
[53:05] the animal and you sit in the middle of
[53:06] the of the carcass
[53:08] and because in his time what they did
[53:10] when they made an agreement he said both
[53:12] of the parties would sit in the carcass
[53:14] of that animal
[53:15] and whoever broke the agreement of the
[53:17] thing he says then you would have to die
[53:19] like this sacrifice had died
[53:22] so then abraham sat there and as the sun
[53:24] was sitting down all of a sudden god put
[53:26] asleep on him showing him he actually he
[53:28] should go to hell
[53:30] but then god in the light he came
[53:31] through and he passed between the
[53:33] sacrifice
[53:36] and that god came down and said see if i
[53:38] do not fulfill my promise to you
[53:40] i will die the same way that sacrifice
[53:42] has died
[53:44] and god can't die
[53:46] so god made a promise to abraham and it
[53:48] was unconditional there was no
[53:50] conditions on abraham's side and what
[53:52] brother branham has tried to express
[53:54] unto us with his agreement with us is
[53:56] unconditional
[53:57] it's not whether you keep the law it's
[53:59] not whether you fulfill certain
[54:01] obligations no it's whether you accept
[54:03] jesus christ as your savior and from
[54:05] that point on god will watch over you
[54:07] and care for you and provide for you
[54:10] whenever when god when abraham finally
[54:12] came to the place where it says he
[54:13] believed god and god counted it to him
[54:15] for righteousness from that point on god
[54:17] always regarded him as righteous
[54:21] when you accept jesus christ as your
[54:23] savior all of a sudden god regards you
[54:25] as righteous and god from that point on
[54:28] does not change his opinion
[54:30] in the eyes of god you are righteous
[54:33] you may not feel like it you may not you
[54:35] know you have your struggles and
[54:36] whatever else in your in your life but
[54:38] god does not change his opinion of you
[54:41] you are righteous because god said yet
[54:43] you are not because you think you are
[54:49] we go a little bit further on we look at
[54:51] a man named david
[54:54] now david was sitting there and
[54:56] taking care of his dad's sheep a lion
[54:58] came in and took one of the one of the
[55:00] lambs and
[55:01] david went after the lion
[55:03] he's killed the lion so he could rescue
[55:05] the lamb
[55:07] a little while later bear came in did
[55:09] the same thing so what did david do he
[55:10] ran after the bear he killed the bear so
[55:13] he could rescue the lamb
[55:15] but see there was going to come a point
[55:16] in david's life
[55:18] when he was going to have he was going
[55:20] to refer back to that time when god
[55:22] smote those animals for him
[55:24] because he was going to stand before a
[55:26] man named goliath
[55:28] in fact when all of a sudden he
[55:30] goliath was making his boast and david
[55:32] heard it and he went before saul and
[55:34] saul says oh he says you can't go you're
[55:36] better you're but a youth
[55:38] he says god gave god god smote the lion
[55:40] and god smote the bear god will give me
[55:42] this goliath also
[55:44] when david went he took he took five
[55:46] stones put him in his little shepherd's
[55:48] pouch and when he saw goliath after
[55:50] making his most he ran toward goliath
[55:53] he didn't crouch down he didn't try and
[55:55] hide behind the trees or the bushes
[55:57] whatever no he said god is going to
[55:59] deliver you into my hand because god has
[56:01] because because i believe in god that he
[56:03] will do that
[56:05] but see we have our goliaths
[56:08] we have our struggles
[56:10] we have the things that we face
[56:12] but see you should be able to look back
[56:14] in your life and you can see well god
[56:15] healed me here if you healed me there he
[56:18] he'll heal me here well i had a need
[56:20] here and god and god provided for me
[56:22] then god will provide for me now well i
[56:24] had this other need in my life and god
[56:26] intervened and god took care of that
[56:27] well if god did that then he'll do for
[56:29] me now it should have it should give us
[56:31] faith to rely upon him
[56:34] well we cannot we actually come to our
[56:36] lives where we rest in the promises of
[56:38] god
[56:40] there came a time also david was
[56:42] watching over the sheep
[56:44] one of the servants came over and says
[56:45] hey your dad wants to see you
[56:48] so david goes into the house and there's
[56:49] this crazy old man
[56:51] takes his horn of oil
[56:53] pours it all over david said you're the
[56:54] next king of israel
[56:57] says really
[56:59] um
[57:00] okay you say so
[57:02] um what did david do he ran to say hey
[57:05] i'm to be the next king teach me how to
[57:06] be a king
[57:08] now he says ah
[57:10] he went back to sheep
[57:12] he was more comfortable with the sheep
[57:15] but then god called god made
[57:17] circumstances come to pass where david
[57:19] became
[57:21] david was taken into the court of saul
[57:24] and that began his education how do you
[57:26] how do you govern a nation
[57:28] but then saul became jealous since he
[57:30] tried to kill david
[57:32] but see so david had to run and hide in
[57:35] caves in different places
[57:38] but see always in the back of his mind
[57:40] there was a prophet that came to me and
[57:42] said i was to be the next king of israel
[57:46] and he refused to kill king saul
[57:49] he said no no god will bring it to pass
[57:51] in his own time in his own way but see
[57:54] it has to come to the place in our lives
[57:56] here
[57:57] we will rule and reign with jesus christ
[58:00] that is our that is what god is
[58:02] preparing us for now to reign with him
[58:04] during the millennium
[58:06] but we have to learn to rest in him we
[58:08] have to be able to sit at his feet even
[58:10] now and begin to take instruction what
[58:12] does it mean to rule
[58:14] the bible says you are kings and priests
[58:16] what does kings do they rule what do we
[58:19] rule we rule over satan's kingdom
[58:23] satan has to obey us
[58:26] because of who we represent
[58:28] we have the authority we don't have the
[58:30] power we have the authority because
[58:31] jesus christ has given us that authority
[58:33] he gave it to his disciples he go into
[58:35] the villages around about you i you know
[58:37] i've given you you go ahead and heal the
[58:39] sick and raise the dead and cast out
[58:41] demons freely i've given you this
[58:42] authority freely use it
[58:44] he never took that back
[58:46] so we have that
[58:48] but see why did god send the prophet in
[58:50] our generation
[58:52] so we would begin to actually believe
[58:54] what we are
[58:55] we would be actually begin to believe we
[58:57] actually have we actually have the have
[59:00] the authority to rule over satan's
[59:02] kingdom when sickness comes what can we
[59:04] do we can rebuke it we can tell that
[59:06] demon to leave
[59:08] when he'll do it
[59:09] don't know but he has to go
[59:12] because we have the authority to tell
[59:14] him to go
[59:16] but you have to believe it it can't be
[59:18] just a mental thing it can't be well the
[59:20] bible says that so i guess it's true no
[59:22] it has to come from inside the heart if
[59:24] you say you believe in your heart and
[59:25] you say the mountain go from hence the
[59:27] underplay and you believe in your heart
[59:29] it has to move which means it has to be
[59:31] an integral part of you it has to be a
[59:33] faith which is unmovable it has to be a
[59:35] faith without question
[59:37] because oh yeah i want the mountain to
[59:39] move and i wonder if it will no it won't
[59:42] but if all of a sudden god comes out
[59:44] like with brother branham he says oh
[59:46] yeah there's going to be a miracle.
[59:48] and they they were they were fishing
[59:50] like brother banks was i guess and a few
[59:52] of the other ones that were there
[59:53] and all of a sudden god told brother
[59:55] brown stand up
[59:57] okay what happened he says little fish i
[1:00:00] give you your life
[1:00:02] okay but see god commanded god
[1:00:04] instructed him what to do
[1:00:07] and you look at the times in the spoken
[1:00:09] word god instructed him what to say
[1:00:12] it wasn't he said well hey you know i
[1:00:14] think it'd be great today well let's why
[1:00:15] don't we have a snowstorm i'd like to go
[1:00:17] skiing or i like to go sledding or
[1:00:18] something and it's the middle of july
[1:00:20] okay no that ain't going to happen but
[1:00:23] see it has to come under the anointing
[1:00:25] it has to come where god inspires us to
[1:00:27] say
[1:00:30] i know there was a brother in
[1:00:32] recently in our in our church and he
[1:00:34] came to me and says we were
[1:00:36] at a function within the church and the
[1:00:38] brother came to me he says you know he
[1:00:40] said i've had this terrible headache
[1:00:41] i've taken these pills and stuff but it
[1:00:42] doesn't seem effective
[1:00:44] and so i said well let's pray so as i
[1:00:47] was praying i said
[1:00:48] i was going to say lord lord be gracious
[1:00:50] to heal him and all of a sudden
[1:00:53] it changed i said satan i command you to
[1:00:55] leave in the name of jesus christ
[1:00:57] because i have the authority because
[1:00:59] jesus christ has given me that authority
[1:01:01] and you have no rights because that
[1:01:03] brother is a purchase of the blood of
[1:01:04] jesus christ
[1:01:07] it had to go
[1:01:09] we had another brother in our church
[1:01:11] and uh they did an operation on one of
[1:01:14] his elbows
[1:01:15] and doctors as far as they were
[1:01:18] concerned
[1:01:19] the operation was successful
[1:01:21] but he got an infection a staph
[1:01:22] infection they treated with antibiotics
[1:01:26] they had to open up one other time and
[1:01:27] pump it for more antibiotics and drain
[1:01:29] it some more
[1:01:30] and you can only do that so many times
[1:01:32] and the damage that becomes irreversible
[1:01:36] and so they were he was in the hospital
[1:01:38] again and the doctors were going to
[1:01:40] treat him one more time
[1:01:42] and god told me he says go and pray for
[1:01:44] him
[1:01:46] um okay i don't like going to charlotte
[1:01:48] traffic is heavy i don't like traffic
[1:01:51] that's why we live where we live anyway
[1:01:54] so i went in there i found the room he
[1:01:56] was in we visited for a few minutes and
[1:01:58] i said you know why i'm here he said
[1:01:59] well no not really
[1:02:00] i said god sent me here to pray for you
[1:02:02] and to rebuke this thing because no
[1:02:04] longer is a physical problem it's a
[1:02:06] spiritual one
[1:02:08] so i prayed and i rebuked that thing and
[1:02:10] cast a demon out of that out of the the
[1:02:13] bacteria that was in his elbow
[1:02:15] and from that point on it began to heal
[1:02:19] it doesn't make me anything
[1:02:21] it's merely i was trying to be obedient
[1:02:22] to what god had
[1:02:24] god would have me to do
[1:02:27] i i know
[1:02:28] well
[1:02:30] i know my wife she worked for labor and
[1:02:32] delivery she was she worked there as a
[1:02:34] doula and labor support
[1:02:37] and uh
[1:02:38] she would hear the nurses are there and
[1:02:39] they'd oh yeah this lady is having
[1:02:41] problems giving giving birth or whatever
[1:02:43] like that
[1:02:44] and shirley would hear it
[1:02:46] so she'd started praying
[1:02:49] and all of a sudden the nurses came in
[1:02:50] to her and says
[1:02:51] you've been praying again haven't you
[1:02:54] well yeah
[1:02:56] yeah because now the baby has turned and
[1:02:58] now we hadn't had a normal delivery
[1:03:00] and that's not just one time that's
[1:03:02] multiple times
[1:03:04] so through her prayers all of a sudden
[1:03:07] you know i mean that
[1:03:08] you know the whole labor and delivery of
[1:03:10] it it was it was it was different
[1:03:12] because she was there that's why she was
[1:03:14] there but it comes down to the place we
[1:03:17] have to rule we rule satan's kingdom
[1:03:20] you look at brother branham's life
[1:03:22] brother branham when he was born he was
[1:03:24] born a prophet
[1:03:26] but see brother branham even when he was
[1:03:28] born a prophet he had no he had no idea
[1:03:30] exactly what that entailed
[1:03:32] he refused to accept jesus christ as his
[1:03:34] savior until finally got put him
[1:03:36] basically on his deathbed
[1:03:38] and from that point on when he said well
[1:03:40] if you let me live he says i'll serve
[1:03:42] you so say okay so god so god healed him
[1:03:46] and then the visions that god had given
[1:03:48] brother branham
[1:03:50] the people told him well that's of the
[1:03:52] devil but yet every vision that he had
[1:03:54] it always proved out to be correct
[1:03:57] he had faith in those visions he says if
[1:03:59] i see a vision i know that's exactly
[1:04:01] what's going to happen
[1:04:03] and then you go and he was reading
[1:04:04] through his bible
[1:04:06] and he looked at how god dealt with
[1:04:08] prophets
[1:04:10] he said well that's how god deals with
[1:04:11] me as a prophet so i must be a prophet
[1:04:14] therefore so it was the bible
[1:04:16] referencing him
[1:04:18] that made him believe that he was a
[1:04:19] prophet
[1:04:20] when all of a sudden the discernments
[1:04:22] began he says hey there's the scripture
[1:04:25] about that that's when that's when god
[1:04:26] came down in human flesh and and and
[1:04:29] actually had a uh could discern the
[1:04:31] thoughts of sarah sarah's heart
[1:04:33] and so he from that point on he would
[1:04:35] turn his back and says say god is here
[1:04:37] he was trying to prove god was present
[1:04:40] he was not trying to exalt himself look
[1:04:42] at what i am i am you know i am this
[1:04:44] mighty angel that's here no he wasn't
[1:04:45] even trying to do that he said i want
[1:04:47] you to see god is actually here because
[1:04:49] if you can believe god is here then if
[1:04:51] you can believe that then god will
[1:04:53] answer your prayer
[1:04:56] then he always believed that billy
[1:04:58] graham was was the church age messenger
[1:05:01] he preached that up until 63.
[1:05:04] because he preached in 62
[1:05:07] kennedy was elected president he says oh
[1:05:09] yeah it's the vote of the women that
[1:05:11] i'll put him in office
[1:05:12] so he says we this is that we must be
[1:05:14] there he says you know so many of the
[1:05:16] visions have already been fulfilled
[1:05:18] so then he preached the church ages and
[1:05:19] after he preached them he said the angel
[1:05:21] told him now you go read malachi 4.
[1:05:24] that's when he began to understand i'm
[1:05:26] the messenger to this age
[1:05:29] but it says in the days of the voice of
[1:05:30] the seventh angel and he shall begin to
[1:05:32] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:05:33] finished brother branham says that that
[1:05:36] seventh angel did not begin to sound
[1:05:38] until the opening of the seals
[1:05:41] and then he says there there's been a
[1:05:43] message committed to me and i have to
[1:05:44] obey that
[1:05:46] so you have to look at his life and now
[1:05:49] as his life progressed from one thing to
[1:05:51] another thing to another because god was
[1:05:53] training him for the final thing to be
[1:05:55] the final to be to be the seventh church
[1:05:58] age messenger to be able to take into
[1:06:00] and to speak to the bride you know it's
[1:06:02] interesting when you read the church
[1:06:04] ages
[1:06:05] god was always had messages to two
[1:06:07] different groups
[1:06:09] one was the true vine one was the false
[1:06:11] mind
[1:06:12] but when you get to the lady of certain
[1:06:14] church age all he's talking about is to
[1:06:15] the false mind
[1:06:17] because god had to send a prophet in
[1:06:19] this generation say no no he says you're
[1:06:21] not luke roman like the ladies in church
[1:06:23] no you are the virtuous sinless bride of
[1:06:25] jesus christ
[1:06:27] god through him was trying to tell the
[1:06:29] bride this is who you are
[1:06:31] god does not hold anything to your
[1:06:33] charge in your in god's eyes you are the
[1:06:35] virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ
[1:06:38] and we have to begin to accept that
[1:06:43] you know going back to habakkuk
[1:06:45] habakkuk after god had been dealing with
[1:06:47] him
[1:06:49] habakkuk came to a revelation of what it
[1:06:51] was going to what it's going to take in
[1:06:52] his life
[1:06:54] in hebrews 3 and 16 it says when i heard
[1:06:56] he said my belly trembled my lips
[1:06:57] quivered at the voice rottnest entered
[1:06:59] into my bones and i trembled in myself
[1:07:01] that i might rest in the day of trouble
[1:07:03] when he cometh up unto the people he
[1:07:05] will invade them with his troops
[1:07:07] havoc was scared
[1:07:10] it wasn't just another passing day
[1:07:12] no he was looking at his own life and
[1:07:14] says i wonder what's going to happen am
[1:07:16] i going to be able to survive this
[1:07:19] but he had to come to the real to the
[1:07:20] revelation within himself he says
[1:07:22] although the fig tree shall not blossom
[1:07:23] neither shall fruit be in the vine the
[1:07:25] labor of the olives shall fail in the
[1:07:27] field shall yield no meat the flock
[1:07:28] shall be cut off from the fold and there
[1:07:30] shall be no hurt in the stall those will
[1:07:32] be total devastation
[1:07:34] though everything is lost
[1:07:37] he said yet i will rejoice in the lord i
[1:07:39] will joy in the god of my salvation
[1:07:43] he will go back to the temple and he
[1:07:44] will shout and he will dance and he will
[1:07:46] and he will with all the energy that he
[1:07:48] had he will praise his god
[1:07:51] it did not matter what he had it did not
[1:07:53] matter the conditions of the world did
[1:07:54] not matter the conditions of the city he
[1:07:56] said nothing will happen which will
[1:07:58] change my relationship with my god
[1:08:01] but see we have to come to the same
[1:08:04] i know in covet when coveted hit i know
[1:08:07] it devastated india
[1:08:09] and i've been going there for the last
[1:08:11] 15 years and
[1:08:12] and i have a burden for the people
[1:08:15] and so i preached on habakkuk
[1:08:18] shortly after after the covet hit
[1:08:21] and i told the brother i work with i
[1:08:22] says out in the villages he says make
[1:08:24] sure they have food
[1:08:26] don't worry about the building projects
[1:08:27] or any anything else make sure they have
[1:08:29] food
[1:08:30] what good is a building if everybody's
[1:08:32] dead i mean you know
[1:08:35] and so
[1:08:36] and you know um
[1:08:38] i have some say in
[1:08:40] how the money is distributed i i don't
[1:08:42] control it control it but
[1:08:44] at least if i make a recommendation
[1:08:45] normally he'll follow my recommendations
[1:08:49] but i told him i said if all of a sudden
[1:08:51] you have nothing
[1:08:53] and there were times in india really
[1:08:55] they had nothing
[1:08:57] they could not leave their neighborhood
[1:08:59] they had they had they had the military
[1:09:02] was posted around the neighborhood nope
[1:09:04] and they even had it roped off
[1:09:07] you cannot leave your neighborhood
[1:09:08] there's a place where you can get some
[1:09:09] fresh some vegetables there's a place
[1:09:11] where you can get some bread there's a
[1:09:12] place you can get the the necessities
[1:09:14] you have but you're not leaving your
[1:09:16] neighborhood
[1:09:18] okay
[1:09:19] what about the people that worked in
[1:09:21] india you work today so you can eat
[1:09:23] tomorrow
[1:09:24] and all of a sudden if there's no work
[1:09:26] there's no money if there's no money
[1:09:27] there's no food
[1:09:29] but see this is the can this was the
[1:09:31] condition in india
[1:09:32] you say oh that's not going to happen
[1:09:34] here
[1:09:35] well how many restaurants have closed
[1:09:38] how many people have been put out of
[1:09:40] work
[1:09:42] okay
[1:09:44] do you trust god
[1:09:46] if everything is lost
[1:09:49] will that affect your relationship with
[1:09:52] your god
[1:09:55] you're right now you're blessed
[1:09:58] what happens tomorrow if everything's
[1:09:59] gone
[1:10:00] well you'll still come to church and
[1:10:02] worship and praise god as if you still
[1:10:04] possessed everything
[1:10:06] and this is something only you can
[1:10:07] answer yourself
[1:10:09] like i say faith is not believing for
[1:10:11] something but it's believing in someone
[1:10:15] it's coming to the realization that god
[1:10:17] is god
[1:10:18] and god is all-powerful
[1:10:20] and god is omnipotent he can do whatever
[1:10:23] he desires to do and he is that he is in
[1:10:25] control of the mess that we're in as a
[1:10:27] nation in fact i look around this nation
[1:10:30] why why is all the this why is why is
[1:10:33] the judgment falling upon this nation
[1:10:35] why does god send judgment
[1:10:38] to have people turn their heart back to
[1:10:39] him
[1:10:41] because all of a sudden they begin to
[1:10:42] cry out at least that was the hope
[1:10:44] though they begin to cry out they'll
[1:10:45] repent of their sins and their
[1:10:47] iniquities and all of a sudden then
[1:10:48] they'll turn back to god and then god
[1:10:50] then god will
[1:10:52] will restore you know the things which
[1:10:54] they were losing
[1:10:56] but our nation doesn't want god
[1:10:59] it's run by a bunch of infidels
[1:11:02] well maybe not all of them but at least
[1:11:04] on the outward sign it sure seems that
[1:11:06] way
[1:11:07] but it comes down to the place where
[1:11:09] where god is wanting this nation to turn
[1:11:11] back to him but brother branham says in
[1:11:13] 15
[1:11:14] i think it was 54 or something like that
[1:11:16] he says this nation has turned their
[1:11:17] back on god
[1:11:20] from that point on and so it's it's
[1:11:21] judgments destruction
[1:11:24] you know there was there's a lady in me
[1:11:26] she was in memphis tennessee
[1:11:29] and this this just struck with me when i
[1:11:31] when i when i read the story of this
[1:11:33] this lady
[1:11:35] she was she said i'm the pseudomite
[1:11:37] woman where's your elijah
[1:11:40] her prayer caused the plane brother
[1:11:42] branham was on to land
[1:11:45] in memphis
[1:11:47] brother branham got up in the morning he
[1:11:49] was going to mail a letter or something
[1:11:50] like that and god says i want you to
[1:11:51] keep
[1:11:52] walking he said well where am i going no
[1:11:55] i just want you to walk but no he has no
[1:11:57] butts just walk
[1:11:59] and brother branham knew to be obedient
[1:12:02] so he went walking along down into the
[1:12:04] poor section of town
[1:12:06] and there was this colored sister which
[1:12:08] was there
[1:12:09] and she'd been there since daybreak
[1:12:12] brother branham walked by and
[1:12:14] she said morning parson
[1:12:17] how did you know i was a parson
[1:12:19] well you see if i fell asleep and god
[1:12:21] gave me a dream you were coming
[1:12:24] he said well i'm brother i'm brother
[1:12:25] branham
[1:12:26] have you heard me nope never heard of
[1:12:27] you before
[1:12:29] well i have healing campaigns well
[1:12:30] that's nice
[1:12:33] she didn't understand the seven seals
[1:12:35] did not have a revelation of the spoken
[1:12:37] word
[1:12:38] she didn't have a revelation of all
[1:12:39] these things that people in this message
[1:12:41] put so much emphasis on
[1:12:43] but she had a relationship with jesus
[1:12:45] christ
[1:12:46] where when she prayed god heard and
[1:12:48] brought that plane down
[1:12:50] and sometimes i wonder is our
[1:12:52] relationship as good as
[1:12:54] that sisters
[1:12:56] have we come to the place in our
[1:12:58] relationship with god where we believe
[1:12:59] that if we pray god will hear our prayer
[1:13:02] and god will answer that prayer
[1:13:04] because this is where we have to come
[1:13:07] this is where we have to come
[1:13:11] brother branham he swore by himself
[1:13:13] brother branham makes this statement
[1:13:15] he says faith is unconscious he says
[1:13:17] you've got faith and you don't even know
[1:13:18] it he said that's right he said jesus
[1:13:20] christ no matter if he was in a storm in
[1:13:22] the in the gales knocking the boat from
[1:13:24] one side to the other or he was standing
[1:13:26] in the face of a mess of demons or if he
[1:13:28] was hanging anywhere never moved him he
[1:13:31] walked right along just as calm and
[1:13:33] quiet as he could be why
[1:13:35] he was simply unconscious of fear of
[1:13:37] anything around him
[1:13:41] he that's right he said whether it's
[1:13:43] going to happen or whether it wasn't
[1:13:44] going to happen he knowed it was going
[1:13:45] to happen because god said said so
[1:13:48] he just walked right on unconscious of
[1:13:50] fear
[1:13:52] but see he knew who he was
[1:13:56] and the problem i find within most of
[1:13:57] the message believers we are we're not
[1:14:00] willing to accept who we are
[1:14:04] we keep looking i know when i was in the
[1:14:06] baptist church
[1:14:08] and even in the assemblies of god and
[1:14:09] stuff i've been in
[1:14:11] that we'd always you know we they would
[1:14:14] preach and say yeah you are a sinner
[1:14:16] saved by grace
[1:14:18] the emphasis being sinner
[1:14:20] because they always want you to realize
[1:14:22] you're imperfect
[1:14:24] you're sinner
[1:14:25] but god's grace has saved you
[1:14:27] well that's true
[1:14:29] but in this message it tells me i am a
[1:14:30] son of god that has been fully restored
[1:14:32] to my rightful position with my father
[1:14:35] i may be a sinner saved by grace because
[1:14:37] that is true but also in the presence in
[1:14:39] the present age in which we're living no
[1:14:42] i am a son of god and i have been fully
[1:14:44] restored to my rightful position with my
[1:14:46] father
[1:14:48] and therefore everything that my father
[1:14:49] is i have access to
[1:14:53] all i have to do is have the faith to
[1:14:54] believe it
[1:14:57] brother branham and obama and gilead
[1:14:59] it's one thing we have to move up to now
[1:15:00] is supreme faith
[1:15:03] supreme faith
[1:15:05] oh my that's you know what it how we can
[1:15:08] ever come to supreme faith he said most
[1:15:10] people don't have enough faith to
[1:15:12] believe for a toothache okay
[1:15:14] but then he goes on and and he gives
[1:15:16] examples
[1:15:18] he say well you say well i'm going home
[1:15:21] i'm going to go out and start the car he
[1:15:23] said that's all an act of faith tomorrow
[1:15:25] they meet you at a certain place he said
[1:15:26] that's all an act of an act of faith he
[1:15:29] says because you've just done it so much
[1:15:31] because it's a regular routine with you
[1:15:35] you're going to go out and start your
[1:15:36] car
[1:15:38] you put the key in the ignition or push
[1:15:40] the button however they are now
[1:15:42] you expect it to start there is no
[1:15:44] question
[1:15:46] well if there is no question that is
[1:15:48] supreme faith
[1:15:50] you just expect it
[1:15:52] you go into your house it's dark you you
[1:15:55] feel for the light switch
[1:15:57] you flip the switch you expect there to
[1:15:58] be light
[1:16:01] why
[1:16:02] you don't doubt
[1:16:04] well that's supreme faith
[1:16:08] by his stripes you're healed
[1:16:10] well god said so
[1:16:12] well if god said so i am
[1:16:14] okay now i just wait for its
[1:16:15] manifestation
[1:16:17] that's supreme faith you don't question
[1:16:20] you believe in the god that has made the
[1:16:22] promise
[1:16:23] in one place in in talking about abraham
[1:16:26] abraham believed in the god that had
[1:16:28] made the promise to him that he he
[1:16:30] believed that the god that had made the
[1:16:31] promise was more than able to bring that
[1:16:33] promise to pass
[1:16:36] but see this is where it comes down with
[1:16:38] us
[1:16:39] do you actually believe that when you
[1:16:41] pray you that god will hear
[1:16:44] and moses says well i believe god will
[1:16:46] heal others but but me i i don't know i
[1:16:49] mean i haven't i haven't done everything
[1:16:51] right today
[1:16:53] that's irrelevant
[1:16:56] i'm not saying you have a license to sin
[1:16:58] i'm not saying you can go out in the
[1:16:59] world and live in the world and corrals
[1:17:01] with the world and do the things of the
[1:17:02] world and then expect god to answer your
[1:17:04] prayer in fact if you can do that you've
[1:17:06] never met jesus christ
[1:17:08] when you met jesus christ there has to
[1:17:10] be a change in your life conversion
[1:17:12] indicates there is a change
[1:17:14] but once the change takes place god
[1:17:16] regards you as righteous
[1:17:18] it doesn't matter what you think about
[1:17:20] you brother brown says it's more
[1:17:21] important for you to believe god says
[1:17:23] you are than what you think you are
[1:17:26] because then when you go to god in
[1:17:27] prayer say well lord i have a need today
[1:17:30] okay what's your need well okay
[1:17:32] and you ask
[1:17:34] and god you know
[1:17:36] you expect god to fulfill it because
[1:17:38] there should be no more question
[1:17:41] and that is supreme faith and brother
[1:17:44] branham he goes on he said that's the
[1:17:46] way the things of god are after you have
[1:17:47] trusted him
[1:17:49] and watched him do so many things till
[1:17:51] it becomes just a regular routine
[1:17:54] and that's the condition i think the
[1:17:55] church will be in just before the coming
[1:17:58] of the lord so the rapture will go on
[1:18:00] right that way it'll just be regular
[1:18:02] routine of following the scriptures and
[1:18:04] the plan of god
[1:18:06] your walk with god
[1:18:08] day by day is that walk is what will
[1:18:11] take you in a rapture
[1:18:13] because you have faith and you're
[1:18:14] walking with enoch walked with god and
[1:18:16] he was not because god took him
[1:18:18] well are we walking with god are we
[1:18:21] walking in the scriptures are we walking
[1:18:22] in the plan of god do we walk trying to
[1:18:24] please him
[1:18:27] serving serving jesus christ
[1:18:29] is not a bunch of rules and regulations
[1:18:31] it's not by law
[1:18:34] i serve him because i love him
[1:18:37] it's the love i have for him that
[1:18:39] motivates me to live the life that i
[1:18:41] live
[1:18:42] it's not because i'm afraid of judgments
[1:18:44] not because i'm afraid of being
[1:18:45] chastised
[1:18:47] no i love him
[1:18:49] i want to please him
[1:18:51] i know there were days when i was when i
[1:18:53] was young i wasn't always good
[1:18:57] but i remember there was one day that
[1:19:00] i don't know what i did but
[1:19:02] mom looked at me and says wait till dad
[1:19:04] gets home
[1:19:07] when she said that i knew man i crossed
[1:19:09] the line
[1:19:11] i made sure dad had his slippers i made
[1:19:13] sure he had his paper i made sure he had
[1:19:15] us
[1:19:16] you know
[1:19:17] and dad look oh what have you done today
[1:19:19] oh nothing i've just been wonderful well
[1:19:22] let me go talk to your mom
[1:19:25] then i had to go and i don't know if you
[1:19:26] know what a willow switch is
[1:19:28] um
[1:19:29] nice and flexible
[1:19:32] and uh go get yourself one
[1:19:36] so i got to stand up for dinner that
[1:19:38] night
[1:19:40] but i was always his son
[1:19:43] even though i had made even though i had
[1:19:45] made
[1:19:46] my mom mad even though i had crossed the
[1:19:48] line more than once
[1:19:50] yet it never changed my relationship
[1:19:52] with my father
[1:19:54] my father loved me
[1:19:58] i respected him
[1:20:00] well i my heaven do i make mistakes
[1:20:02] should i do we all do
[1:20:05] but he says if you confess your faults
[1:20:06] you say faithful and just to forgive you
[1:20:08] of your sins and all unrighteous and all
[1:20:10] in righteousness
[1:20:11] okay so you confess it it's gone brother
[1:20:13] brother greene i know he made mention
[1:20:15] here he says you know repentance is one
[1:20:16] of the was one of the biggest bargains
[1:20:18] you have as a christian
[1:20:20] because once you confess it it's gone
[1:20:23] god can't even remind can't even find it
[1:20:26] i know there was one minister once he
[1:20:27] was having problems there was some
[1:20:29] people in the church
[1:20:31] those people were going through some
[1:20:33] problem
[1:20:34] and the minister said well lord show me
[1:20:36] what the problem is in their life so i
[1:20:37] can i can help them
[1:20:40] and god spoke back and says i can't show
[1:20:42] it to you
[1:20:43] because i can't find it because they've
[1:20:46] already confessed it
[1:20:50] see that's our relationship
[1:20:52] but you have to believe this
[1:20:55] it has i mean it's god's word i'm not
[1:20:57] trying to get you to believe it because
[1:20:58] i say no this is god's word this is what
[1:21:00] god himself has said
[1:21:02] but you have to grasp hold of this to
[1:21:04] the point where now all of a sudden it
[1:21:06] becomes a reality to your life
[1:21:10] brother brown or yeah and god who is
[1:21:12] rich in mercy he says i'm only saying
[1:21:14] this not to mix up doctrine but just
[1:21:16] straighten it out that we might get away
[1:21:17] from this fear and the scare
[1:21:19] what are we scared of
[1:21:21] what is this fear that grips us as
[1:21:24] christians
[1:21:26] you don't know who you are
[1:21:29] that was in 65.
[1:21:32] you're not willing to acknowledge what
[1:21:34] you are
[1:21:35] you're not willing to acknowledge you
[1:21:37] are a son and a daughter of god
[1:21:40] you want to look at your humanity you
[1:21:42] want to look at the problems around you
[1:21:43] you want to look at all the different
[1:21:45] things going on in your life but if you
[1:21:47] can if you can accept what god says you
[1:21:49] are if you can accept the fact god is
[1:21:51] your father
[1:21:53] and you can believe that and you can
[1:21:55] establish the relationship between a
[1:21:57] child and their and their father
[1:21:59] then god is there always for your be on
[1:22:02] your behalf god is always there to
[1:22:03] answer your prayer we i was we were at
[1:22:06] some place
[1:22:07] and this little kid he was running
[1:22:09] around just being a kid
[1:22:10] he's four or five maybe not even that
[1:22:12] old anyway he was running his trip and
[1:22:15] skipped and and skinned his knee
[1:22:18] what does he do runs to his dad
[1:22:21] his dad didn't say ah grow up be a man.
[1:22:25] no he picked the son up and put him on
[1:22:27] his shoulder and said oh it's all right
[1:22:29] son it's all right it'll be okay you
[1:22:31] know it's you know you'll be all right
[1:22:33] it's fun daddy loves you that'll take
[1:22:35] care of you dad will watch out for you
[1:22:38] a few minutes later put the kid down
[1:22:40] kid ran off to play
[1:22:42] but the father by showing his love to
[1:22:45] his child
[1:22:46] by the father comforting his son
[1:22:50] his son to gain strength
[1:22:52] and then could go out and play some more
[1:22:55] so whenever we stumble and fall and skin
[1:22:57] our knee
[1:22:58] we just run into our father
[1:23:00] father made a mistake today father i've
[1:23:02] had some problems today father i haven't
[1:23:04] quite lived up to your expectations i
[1:23:06] know but father i love you
[1:23:08] and he'll grab you in his loving arms
[1:23:09] and he'll wrap his arms around you and
[1:23:11] says but you're my child
[1:23:14] i loved you enough to die on the cross
[1:23:15] for you
[1:23:17] i've redeemed you back into myself we
[1:23:19] now have a relationship
[1:23:21] that is unbreakable
[1:23:23] now just go ahead
[1:23:24] just don't sin anymore try harder
[1:23:27] but see this is how it is this is the
[1:23:29] relationship i'm trying to get across
[1:23:32] he says you're not going to be but now
[1:23:34] you are sons of god say you always were
[1:23:36] sons of god for when god had you in his
[1:23:38] thinking from the beginning you have to
[1:23:40] some part of you and in your life
[1:23:43] your life it had to be there
[1:23:44] um
[1:23:46] he says and when you heard the word you
[1:23:48] you know that you come you know where
[1:23:49] you came from you know what was the
[1:23:51] truth
[1:23:54] god when you were born god placed his
[1:23:56] seed in you
[1:23:59] and that said when when the bible says
[1:24:01] and and and he quickened you to life
[1:24:04] what did he do you accepted jesus christ
[1:24:06] as your savior that seed gene that god
[1:24:08] had placed in you
[1:24:09] at the time of your birth that is what
[1:24:11] germinated that is what sprouted
[1:24:14] and that began to grow and brother
[1:24:15] branham says what it comes into your you
[1:24:17] get the holy ghost it comes in about the
[1:24:18] size of a button or your fingernail or
[1:24:21] something
[1:24:22] but he says the more you feed on god's
[1:24:24] word he says what happens is by you
[1:24:26] feeding on god's word by you praying by
[1:24:28] you coming and worshiping doing the
[1:24:29] things that christians do he says what
[1:24:31] does it do he says all of a sudden he
[1:24:32] begins to push at all the unbelief and
[1:24:34] all the things of the world until slowly
[1:24:36] but surely god cleanses you from the
[1:24:38] inside out
[1:24:41] under the law he said god wrote it on
[1:24:43] tables of stone
[1:24:45] but he said now he says in the christian
[1:24:47] dispensation i'm going to write in your
[1:24:48] heart and in your mind
[1:24:50] why because it will become a part of you
[1:24:53] you will live it because it's your
[1:24:54] nature to live it
[1:24:56] but you're still going to have to battle
[1:24:58] the
[1:24:59] the shell that you live in
[1:25:04] brother branham in the written
[1:25:06] exposition of the seven church ages
[1:25:08] he talks about he talks about satan he
[1:25:10] says he knows that if the people can get
[1:25:12] a true revelation of the true church
[1:25:14] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:25:16] she can do the greater works
[1:25:18] she will be an invincible army
[1:25:21] and if they get a true revelation of the
[1:25:22] two spirits within the framework of the
[1:25:24] christian church and by god's spirit
[1:25:25] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:25:27] spirit satan is powerless before her
[1:25:30] so why aren't we an invincible army
[1:25:32] invincible means undefeatable
[1:25:36] it says when they get it the true
[1:25:37] revelation of the true church when you
[1:25:40] realize your bride
[1:25:43] when you realize you're not false the
[1:25:45] false vine but you're the true vine
[1:25:47] when you realize you are a part of god
[1:25:49] from the beginning when you realize it's
[1:25:51] god in you god changing your very nature
[1:25:53] from the inside out when you begin to
[1:25:54] understand
[1:25:56] your relationship that you have with god
[1:25:58] where where you and god have
[1:26:01] you and god literally become one
[1:26:03] in fact when you talk about oneness
[1:26:05] um brother branham he in one place i
[1:26:07] don't have that in front of me but he
[1:26:09] talks about one you see all the god was
[1:26:10] he poured into christ all the christ was
[1:26:12] important to the church see the church
[1:26:14] therefore collectively is the fullness
[1:26:15] of the godhead body he said don't you
[1:26:17] see the oneness of god
[1:26:21] he's elevating you to the place
[1:26:24] where you are part of the godhead
[1:26:27] at least that's that that's how i
[1:26:29] understand this
[1:26:30] it doesn't mean i can die for your sins
[1:26:32] it doesn't it i mean you know it's jesus
[1:26:35] christ was the only sinless character
[1:26:36] jesus christ was he came so that he
[1:26:39] could die on the cross so he could pay
[1:26:40] for my sin so there i mean that that
[1:26:42] doesn't doesn't even enter into the
[1:26:44] picture
[1:26:45] but i come to the place where i where
[1:26:47] where god it so lives in me until it's
[1:26:49] no longer i living but it's christ
[1:26:51] living living through me through me
[1:26:54] paul and he talks about in the
[1:26:57] he talks about there's a great mystery
[1:26:59] which has been hidden down through time
[1:27:02] what is this great mystery
[1:27:04] it's christ in you
[1:27:06] it's god living his life in you
[1:27:09] god doesn't want you to live a christian
[1:27:11] life
[1:27:12] he wants you to die to yourself so he
[1:27:14] can live his life through you
[1:27:16] because you'll never be able to live it
[1:27:18] by yourself
[1:27:19] you have to yield your bodies to to god
[1:27:22] and let god live his life through you
[1:27:25] jesus christ never performed one miracle
[1:27:28] he says that the father dwells in me he
[1:27:30] performs the miracle brother branham and
[1:27:33] so when they when what when god came
[1:27:35] down on the ohio river he said i just
[1:27:36] happen to be standing there
[1:27:39] and all of a sudden he's standing there
[1:27:40] and discernment line he's well i just
[1:27:42] happen to be standing there and god just
[1:27:43] using my voice
[1:27:45] and this had this miracle happen that
[1:27:46] merely happened well i just happened to
[1:27:48] be standing there and god performed it
[1:27:50] brother branham never took it to himself
[1:27:53] he never claimed that he had the power
[1:27:55] and the authority to do it by himself in
[1:27:57] fact one time when the angel said oh
[1:27:59] yeah he says you're going to take a
[1:28:00] message of divine healing around the
[1:28:02] world and so he would advertise in his
[1:28:04] effort in his first few campaigns he saw
[1:28:06] yeah bring the halt and the blind and
[1:28:08] the lame he says watch god perform
[1:28:09] miracles
[1:28:11] and the angel says don't do
[1:28:12] that. he did that two or three times and
[1:28:15] all of a sudden god says you think you
[1:28:16] can do it go for it
[1:28:19] brother brahm called the prayer line i
[1:28:20] think the people were hard of hearing
[1:28:23] one person came up hard of hearing when
[1:28:25] they left they were still hard of
[1:28:26] hearing next person came up i think and
[1:28:27] he prayed that person went off deaf
[1:28:30] i think the third one was a child if my
[1:28:32] memory serves me right and that's not
[1:28:34] always the best thing to go by
[1:28:37] but all of a sudden he stopped the
[1:28:38] meeting
[1:28:40] and he went back to god he began to pray
[1:28:42] lord what happened
[1:28:44] he says i told you not to do it
[1:28:46] the angel says the gift god placed in
[1:28:48] you is for god to use
[1:28:51] not you
[1:28:53] and so when he and he had to repent i
[1:28:55] mean i think he talked in the next few
[1:28:57] sermons like that he said i was like
[1:28:58] balaam
[1:29:01] but he said after that he took the gift
[1:29:03] and he gave it to back to god
[1:29:05] and said god now you use it
[1:29:08] he stands up there and here for a prayer
[1:29:09] line he said and he would just sit there
[1:29:10] and talk and talk and talk he said you
[1:29:12] know what i'm waiting for
[1:29:13] i'm waiting for him because if he
[1:29:14] doesn't come i can't do anything
[1:29:16] he acknowledged that
[1:29:18] but then i says he's here i take every
[1:29:20] spirit under control in the name of
[1:29:22] jesus christ because at that point god
[1:29:25] was there and god was directing and god
[1:29:27] was using him in that capacity
[1:29:29] but so it comes down into your lives
[1:29:33] you have the power to speak it
[1:29:35] but you have to have a relationship with
[1:29:37] god so you know what god's will is
[1:29:42] you have to come to a place in your
[1:29:44] relationship with god where you're on a
[1:29:46] personal name basis
[1:29:48] where he isn't god up in heaven
[1:29:50] someplace
[1:29:52] i mean i can be driving in my car and
[1:29:54] all of a sudden have a thought come
[1:29:55] along oh lord i don't understand that
[1:29:57] scripture could you help me out
[1:29:59] and then all of a sudden i'd be driving
[1:30:00] it along another thought will come
[1:30:01] another one thank you lord i was
[1:30:03] wondering about that
[1:30:04] one or else i ask a question he doesn't
[1:30:07] answer me that my pastor will get up the
[1:30:09] next service and he'll answer my
[1:30:10] question
[1:30:11] or something else will come along and
[1:30:12] i'm wondering about this and all of a
[1:30:14] sudden somebody else will be talking to
[1:30:16] another brother and he'll make he'll say
[1:30:17] something and ah that's what that means
[1:30:20] okay thank you lord
[1:30:21] but see god has different ways of
[1:30:23] speaking
[1:30:24] but you have to be you have to be
[1:30:26] sensitive enough to him
[1:30:28] to be able to recognize that and to be
[1:30:30] able to claim it for yourself
[1:30:34] i know we have
[1:30:35] in our church and i'm pretty sure it's
[1:30:37] in most places when we come to church we
[1:30:39] quieten ourselves down and try to forget
[1:30:41] about the today and try and forget about
[1:30:43] tomorrow and try to forget about the
[1:30:45] things that have happened
[1:30:47] and you try and get your mind upon god
[1:30:49] upon jesus christ so that all of a
[1:30:51] sudden when the word comes forth you're
[1:30:53] in a con
[1:30:54] in a condition where you could receive
[1:30:56] it
[1:30:56] well i just wrote my bible one sunday
[1:30:58] and i turned to isaiah 31
[1:31:01] and again 31 1 it says woe unto them
[1:31:03] they go down to egypt for help and stay
[1:31:05] on horses and trust in chariots because
[1:31:07] they are many and horsemen because they
[1:31:09] are very strong
[1:31:10] but they look not unto the holy one of
[1:31:12] israel
[1:31:14] neither seek the lord
[1:31:16] and verse 3 it goes on now the egyptians
[1:31:18] are men and not god
[1:31:21] and the horses are flesh
[1:31:23] and not spirit
[1:31:25] and i got to think because this was the
[1:31:27] time when when hezekiah was the king of
[1:31:30] jerusalem
[1:31:31] and the the babylonian army had
[1:31:33] surrounded the city and he was going to
[1:31:35] go to egypt for help because egypt had
[1:31:37] only had the largest military available
[1:31:39] to be able to counter the
[1:31:41] this other army and isaiah went to him
[1:31:45] and says don't go to egypt
[1:31:48] trust god
[1:31:50] that would be awful difficult for the
[1:31:53] for hezekiah
[1:31:56] what about the people if these people
[1:31:58] storm the gates we can't withstand them
[1:32:01] if these people put their ladders up on
[1:32:03] the wall and cry crawl over the wall
[1:32:04] what are we going to do
[1:32:06] and isaiah says trust god god is trying
[1:32:09] you god wants you to trust him
[1:32:13] hezekiah did
[1:32:15] but anyway we my wife and i were flying
[1:32:18] to
[1:32:19] to india
[1:32:21] and uh we had landed in london after a
[1:32:24] six-hour flight i think it was and then
[1:32:25] we took off from london for a 10 or 12
[1:32:27] hour flight or more to go to india
[1:32:31] and the food's not what it used to be
[1:32:33] but it's food
[1:32:35] and
[1:32:36] my wife wasn't eating
[1:32:39] i says well what's wrong
[1:32:41] he said i got this terrible headache i
[1:32:43] must have picked up something something
[1:32:45] when we were in london
[1:32:47] i said oh well all of our pills happen
[1:32:49] to be in the
[1:32:50] like i called the belly of the beast you
[1:32:52] know in the luggage compartment
[1:32:54] and uh well we'll get to indiana
[1:32:57] in a few hours you can take a couple of
[1:32:59] pills and go to bed and sleep and get
[1:33:01] some rest you know you're kicking
[1:33:04] you'll kick this thing
[1:33:06] and then god
[1:33:08] reminded me of isaiah
[1:33:12] woe to them that go down to egypt for
[1:33:14] hell
[1:33:15] egypt speaks of the world
[1:33:18] egypt speaks of self-reliance
[1:33:20] to me it does
[1:33:22] why do i always rely upon myself
[1:33:25] why do i always rely upon what i can do
[1:33:29] why do i always rely upon the things i
[1:33:31] believe i can accomplish
[1:33:34] rather than relying upon god
[1:33:37] the egyptians they're just men
[1:33:40] men is limited
[1:33:42] all men are limited
[1:33:45] no matter what they think they are no
[1:33:46] matter how great they are no matter how
[1:33:48] much money they got or whatever else
[1:33:49] they're limited
[1:33:53] so why do why do we put our trust there
[1:33:57] and see this is what god was trying to
[1:33:59] deal with me because when we were in
[1:34:00] india that that time
[1:34:02] there were a couple of three instances
[1:34:04] when we were there that
[1:34:06] i needed god then
[1:34:08] so there were some situations that arose
[1:34:10] and
[1:34:10] if it hadn't been for god's intervention
[1:34:12] we
[1:34:13] we would have been in tough shape
[1:34:16] but see god was trying to get me don't
[1:34:18] rely upon egypt don't rely upon yourself
[1:34:21] rely on me
[1:34:22] i have sent you i promise to take care
[1:34:24] of you
[1:34:26] and so if you put your trust in me i
[1:34:28] will i will do that and so here again it
[1:34:30] goes back to habakkuk habakkuk had to
[1:34:32] come to the time in his own in his
[1:34:34] relationship with god where if
[1:34:35] everything be gone
[1:34:37] i will still worship god nothing will
[1:34:38] happen which will change my relationship
[1:34:40] with my god
[1:34:43] and so here again it came to the place
[1:34:45] in my life that and in
[1:34:48] the last year so anyway i've come to
[1:34:50] this
[1:34:51] i i believe personally
[1:34:53] if i take my hand and i put it in god's
[1:34:56] and ask him ask him to hold my hand
[1:35:00] that he will guide me he will take care
[1:35:02] of me he'll provide for me
[1:35:05] i have to take and put my faith and my
[1:35:07] trust in him
[1:35:08] it's not believing for something
[1:35:11] it's not believing for healing it's not
[1:35:12] believing for riches it's not believing
[1:35:14] for anything no it's it's believing in
[1:35:17] the god that has made the promise
[1:35:20] and then taking the promise god has made
[1:35:22] to me
[1:35:23] and resting in that
[1:35:25] until god brings it to pass
[1:35:29] one last thing before i close with i was
[1:35:31] in we had youth meetings we were up in
[1:35:34] uh i think that was in
[1:35:37] probably in ohio when they had the
[1:35:38] meetings up there
[1:35:40] and i don't know who preached it really
[1:35:42] was kind of irrelevant but a minister
[1:35:43] would get up there and he would preach
[1:35:46] and eighty percent of the congregation
[1:35:48] the young people would head for the
[1:35:49] altars and we'd go around as ministers
[1:35:50] we pray for all these people
[1:35:53] i feel oh great you know they're finally
[1:35:55] getting what they want
[1:35:57] well the next night same thing
[1:36:01] figured well i wonder what's going on
[1:36:02] their night the same thing
[1:36:05] and i began to question i says lord what
[1:36:08] is the hindrance here
[1:36:11] why is it that they cannot receive
[1:36:15] because they're seeking they're asking
[1:36:16] they're crying out
[1:36:18] but why can't they break through why
[1:36:20] can't they receive
[1:36:22] and so all of a sudden some thoughts
[1:36:24] came in my mind
[1:36:26] and and the thoughts were there there
[1:36:28] was there was this lady
[1:36:30] and she was in a in a city or village
[1:36:32] whatever like that and and she was she
[1:36:34] was destitute she was going in the
[1:36:36] street her hair was a mess her clothes
[1:36:38] were all filthy and she was going around
[1:36:40] persons who were begging please could i
[1:36:42] have a little piece of bread please i'm
[1:36:44] so hungry just just give me just a
[1:36:46] little morsel of bread i've i haven't
[1:36:48] eaten for days and i'm just so hungry
[1:36:49] can you just spare me just a little
[1:36:51] something
[1:36:53] and this went on for a while and finally
[1:36:54] she says you know i understand there's a
[1:36:56] real kind man up on the mountain
[1:36:59] i'll go to him
[1:37:01] so she goes up to the mountain and she
[1:37:02] goes up there and she begins to knock
[1:37:04] and this good man opened the door and
[1:37:08] she begins to beg please can i have just
[1:37:10] a little morsel of bread i haven't eaten
[1:37:12] for three four days now and i'm just i'm
[1:37:14] just so hungry i just i just
[1:37:16] please please help me would you please
[1:37:18] help me
[1:37:20] and the good man he looks at her and
[1:37:21] says sweetheart
[1:37:24] why are you begging
[1:37:27] i wondered where you've been
[1:37:30] we have a banquet table set there with
[1:37:32] all the food that you've always liked
[1:37:33] and enjoyed
[1:37:35] oh and sweetheart look at your dress
[1:37:37] it's so filthy
[1:37:39] why don't you go in there oh
[1:37:41] take a nice hot bath and washing the
[1:37:43] water by the word
[1:37:45] and go take in one of the gowns we have
[1:37:47] plenty of them they're all pure white
[1:37:49] and stuff just go ahead and put one of
[1:37:51] them on
[1:37:53] and then come down and sit at the table
[1:37:54] and feast
[1:37:56] she was his wife
[1:38:01] she did not have to beg
[1:38:04] everything in the house belonged to her
[1:38:07] by virtue of who she was
[1:38:10] we are the bride of jesus christ
[1:38:13] we are the pure virtuous sinless bride
[1:38:15] of jesus christ
[1:38:18] everything you have need of is there
[1:38:21] you are hungry feed on his word
[1:38:24] you need you need forgiveness it's there
[1:38:27] for you he died on the cross for that
[1:38:29] the why his stripes are healed so you
[1:38:30] already have your healing
[1:38:32] everything you have natives at the cross
[1:38:35] it's not a matter of begging
[1:38:38] it's a matter of accepting
[1:38:40] it's a matter of having having faith in
[1:38:42] the one that has called you it's having
[1:38:44] faith in the god that has watched over
[1:38:47] you from the time of your birth even
[1:38:48] until this present day
[1:38:51] that is the god you need to have faith
[1:38:53] in
[1:38:54] and have faith to believe his word
[1:38:58] because if you can believe it like we
[1:39:00] like we read there
[1:39:01] in romans
[1:39:03] therefore being justified by faith
[1:39:06] believing that we are the pure virtuous
[1:39:08] sinless bride of jesus christ
[1:39:11] believing that we stand before him as if
[1:39:13] we had never sinned
[1:39:15] that we are pure and sinless as god
[1:39:17] himself is pure
[1:39:19] therefore being justified by this faith
[1:39:21] by actually believing this
[1:39:23] by having a relationship with god where
[1:39:26] we don't rely upon ourselves we don't
[1:39:27] rely upon our thoughts we don't rely
[1:39:29] upon our own abilities if we do have any
[1:39:32] no we rely totally upon him for
[1:39:34] literally everything
[1:39:36] i'm justified because he justified me
[1:39:39] i'm sinless because he told me i am
[1:39:42] i am healed because he already said i
[1:39:44] was
[1:39:47] and because i believe that i have peace
[1:39:50] through jesus christ
[1:39:53] let's pray
[1:40:00] our most gracious and loving heavenly
[1:40:01] father
[1:40:03] has been chopped up i know
[1:40:06] and for that i'm asking
[1:40:09] i'm sorry lord
[1:40:11] but lord your place is upon my heart and
[1:40:13] i don't know if the thought was managed
[1:40:15] to get across
[1:40:17] but lord we love you
[1:40:20] because you loved us
[1:40:23] you justified me
[1:40:25] because of what you did at the cross
[1:40:28] you healed me
[1:40:30] because of the stripes it was put on
[1:40:31] your back
[1:40:33] and lord you're calling us to accept the
[1:40:36] fact that we are your sons and your
[1:40:38] daughters
[1:40:40] you're asking us not to have this fear
[1:40:42] and this scare
[1:40:44] but to be able to take by faith and grab
[1:40:46] hold of the fact that you are our father
[1:40:50] and there is something that we as the
[1:40:52] bride must fulfill
[1:40:54] in the hour in which we find ourselves
[1:40:57] we've seen you've been taking a lot of
[1:40:59] people home recently lord
[1:41:01] we had a funeral the other night
[1:41:03] you took a beautiful sister home
[1:41:06] i pray lord for rather
[1:41:08] for them that lord the for the family
[1:41:11] brother figaro and his family
[1:41:13] because lord a part of him now is
[1:41:15] missing
[1:41:16] and you have to fill that void lord as
[1:41:18] much as it's possible
[1:41:20] and be with the family lord they've lost
[1:41:22] a mother they've they've lost aunts
[1:41:24] uncles whatever
[1:41:26] be with that family lord i pray
[1:41:29] but above all lord help us to take and
[1:41:31] come to the realization of who we are in
[1:41:34] you
[1:41:35] it's not what we are in ourselves
[1:41:36] because lord we're nothing
[1:41:39] but lord you want to live your life
[1:41:40] through us
[1:41:42] and lord we have to surrender us lives
[1:41:45] to you
[1:41:46] so you can do that
[1:41:48] so take the words that have been spoken
[1:41:50] lord put them together in a way that has
[1:41:52] meaning in the hearts of the people
[1:41:54] but above all lord help us to grasp hold
[1:41:56] of and have make it a reality in our
[1:41:58] lives that we are your sons
[1:42:02] and your daughters
[1:42:03] grant this lord from asking it in the
[1:42:05] precious and wonderful name
[1:42:07] of jesus christ
[1:42:09] amen
[1:42:12] brother matthew if you could be right
