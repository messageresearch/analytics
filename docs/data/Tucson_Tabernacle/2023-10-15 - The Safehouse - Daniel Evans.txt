um to that Philip represented to Nathaniel it's it's good to have all the visitors if I missed anyone I apologize I it's sister Priscilla FR good to have you back good to have you out of the hospital on your way to recovery welcome back God bless you I um had something on my heart to minister about this morning and it started last week after our service on Sunday I talked about Israel it's not something I talk about very often um because I I know that sometimes and as I said last week sometimes we can go too far in in looking at the signs around us and and remember as I said last week that that prophecy that the interpretation of Prophecy is the Fulfillment of that prophecy it's not what we say about it it's not our ideas about it but it's when it happens is when those prophecies um are interpreted and they're made known just as Peter at the day of Pentecost when Peter saw he saw the pillar of fire come down and resting upon the 120 in the upper room and he saw that they were they were speaking in unknown unkknown tongues and he said this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel so when he saw it happen he he saw that it was real and this was what the prophecy was talking about and when I speak this morning I'm gonna stay on the same subject as I was I was last week and as I said I'm careful I don't want to introduce any strange doctrines I don't want to point anybody to anything other than our Lord Jesus Christ and him only as that song that brother Jordan was singing says but I also want to not just close our eyes and not see the things that are going on around us I was on my knees and I was praying early last week I was praying about the um the situation going on in Israel and how we are warned that these things are going to happen it seems like everything always you read the Bible and everything always seems to come back to Jerusalem and Israel there's all kinds of of problems that are going around and it seems like it all everything always just comes back to this one little place in the world world and I think we're seeing that again today and what's happening is as I was praying about that I was asking the Lord I said Lord is written in your word to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem and I see that because everything comes back to that one place that if we're praying for the Peace of Jerusalem that peace also spreads around the world so when we're praying about the Peace of Jerusalem we're also praying Lord for your peace all over over the place and as I was praying for the for Jerusalem and for all of these these men and women that have died and and and become captive and and in a very very difficult situation I finished my prayer and I said these words very common words that should never be common to us I said these words I said in Jesus name and and it struck me really strongly wait a minute they don't have that name they don't understand this man Jesus Christ and what an honor that we have just to bow down on our knees and pray in the name of Jesus Christ when we pray to God it's not just like Lord bless this food in Jesus name amen never say anything like that that's not how we pray when we pray in the name of Jesus it is as if Jesus himself is talking to the father in jesus' name if you go somewhere in the name of the Tucson Tabernacle you are representing the Tucson Tabernacle if you go somewhere in the name of your work you are representing your work and your work is the one responsible for backing you up and the same when we go before the father in the name of Jesus Christ we are praying as is if it's Jesus himself speaking so we should never take those things lightly and I was as I was praying it just struck me I was really taken back that I that I'm able to pray in that name and my mind went to a friend of mine many of you know him he was uh Peter mcfaden and and his wife had met him and and he had just this young man was he he's a Jew and Peter had uh invited him to church and I believe it was on a Wednesday night and I was preaching this is over well over a year ago and uh maybe about a year ago and I felt on my heart to preach about baptism and as I was as I was ministering on baptism it was I pointed out that it's very important that when we are baptized we are baptized in a name and not in something that is a a title or something that doesn't mean much but in a name and there is a name ass associated with our walk with the Lord and as I was ministering the the uh the young Jewish man was here in the front and he's actually a he was in the IDF for a while he's Soldier and uh and really a great man if if you know him he's um just you look at him you see he's a warrior this guy is I believe he's a um now he's a professor um he works at the U OFA we go to lunch every once in a while and I was uh so I started thinking about him and he just really came on my heart because of all this that's going on in Israel and these these armies that are that that are now mobilizing to invade Gaza and so I reached out to him a couple days ago he didn't answer my call and I thought well I'll I'll just leave him alone so then I tried to call him again the next day he didn't answer my call but he text me back and I I feel that it would be okay with him if I if I read his text to you think about he's he's Jewish again he was in the Jewish military he says this he says hi brother Dan I'm sorry I'm just too overwhelmed with emotion and Life to talk at this moment I'm sure you know that the entire people of Israel is locked in horror and I noticed that our brother's very educated and and when he says this he says the entire people is locked in horror is is a singular verb and it represents a singular people in one body he says the entire people of Israel is locked in horror many of us are stuck in the first stage of grief and denial how can this possibly have happened to us on the most joyous day of the year simcat Torah the rejoicing of the Torah when we celebrate God's word by dancing with the Torah Scrolls and thousands of my brothers and sisters were slaughtered and brutalized and kidnapped on this day their blood cries out to me my soul is in unbearable anguish it's a read his text thought look at the burden that this man has for his own people look at the love that he has for these people like they are his closest friends his his brothers and his sisters and yet he probably knows very few of them yet he says their blood is crying out to me and it took me back saying Lord do I have that type of love in my heart I look at what's going on there in in Gaza and and and the fighting that's going on and there are hundreds or thousands maybe of Americans that are stranded and yet we won't send an airplane our government won't send transportation to bring them back home and countries throughout Europe they have to get they have to get on a flight and go to Europe and then come home and we our own countrymen we won't send help to bring them out and I read David's text and I thought look at the difference between me as an American and this man how much he loves his people made me think about Matthew 24 and if we could turn in our Bibles to Matthew 24 verse4 our lord Jesus is speaking gives us warning of the end time warning of when that the second coming of Christ is at hand and he says this take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am the Christ and shall deceive many and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places these are the beginning of Sorrows and they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall arise tell and deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold reading that and thinking where is the love that was present where is the love that's present in this man's text to me where is that love among the people of the world that they they love each other so much that they would be willing to do anything to help them and the love of many shall actx cold I thought truly we are in this last day this Matthew chapter 24 I'm going to tell a story from the last few chapters in The Book of judges and it it starts with in there in those days there was no king in Israel there was no leadership in Israel so it's kind of given the the the qualifying statement like hey this is because there wasn't any good leadership in Israel so I want to qualify it with that and it ends with the same statement saying that there was no king in Israel and Men did what was right in their own eyes so what happens in this story and as I said it's in the last three chapters of the Book of Judges and I'm going to give you the watered down version um and the reason I'm going to give you the water down version is because there's some pretty heavyduty um things going on that it's maybe not appropriate for me to uh say it from the uh the pull pit so with the kids um if you want to know some of the det s uh ask your parents after service and maybe you can talk about it um and good luck parents with with explaining this story I think about you know I think about how good how wonderful this book is and and how interesting it is and and just how blessed it is I think about I've told the story a couple times I think about Nathan Taylor stood over there you standing out in the field with your cousin and you guys are reading out of the Book of Genesis and just the excitement that you both had this book is full of excitement it's full of great stories it's it's full of love it's got everything in it so this man in judges he's a levite he from the tribe of Levi he goes and and he has what's called a concubine and a concubine back then was was somebody that maybe a woman that maybe back then wasn't worthy of marriage to this man but he he still may have loved her or um it it was it was to have children or whatever it might be well this man this levite his concubine had left him and she had gone to be with her dad and and he goes and finds her and he tracks her down and and and he talks with the with the dad and he ends up bringing the girl his for uh his wife for his concubine back with him and he's going home and it's getting dark and he comes to the city and one of the men that was with him was was like well let's stay in this city and he says no he says don't feel comfortable staying in this city because these are not our people they're not Jewish people of course Levi was of the one of the 12 tribes of Israel the the ancestors to the Jewish people he says let's go on to this next town and so it's continued to getting dark and he goes down to this next town which is giba and he can't find anybody that he can stay with them so he stays he goes and he sets up camp in the city Square in the middle and this old man comes up to him and he's like hey what what are you doing and they're like well we're gonna stay stay here the night he's like no it's not such a good idea here why don't you come and stay with me so he goes with with his concubine and with with the other guys that were with him and he stays with this man well there were some very evil men that were were watching all of this happen perverted men and they followed this man to this old man's house and they knock on the door and they say hey send this new man out because we want to basically do the same thing that happened in Sodom and Gomorrah and he said remember I'm trying to give the Fairly maybe PG rated version of this and he says well he says and things were different back then he says well take just ends up sending out his concubine and they take this woman and they ended up um abusing her and ended up killing her and leaving her on the doorstep of the old man and so the levite picks her up throws her on his donkey and goes home very upset so he gets her home and he sends out packages to all the 12 tribes of Judah all 12 tribes of Israel saying here's what happened and again ask your parents what was in the packages and um sometimes your Bible you're like you look at it you're like whoa no way yeah it's there and so he sends these packages out and he gets all of Israel fired up really upset and they come as one unit and they say okay what are we going to do against this town of giba which is of the tribe of Benjamin one of the 12 tribes so they end up organizing a force and they ask the Lord about it and he says go forward they end up organizing a force and going to battle and these men of Benjamin were really the greatest warriors in all the country that they were fighting against so they lose tens of thousands of people and then they go back and they go fight them again and again Benjamin The Tribe of Benjamin wins and then finally they send out the armies again and they Conquer The Tribe of Benjamin they conquer it so strongly that it almost wipes out the entire race the entire Tribe of Benjamin so then the other 11 tribes they feel bad about this this whole situation though so they say we can't let one of our own tribes go extinct there's only I think 600 men left in Benjamin so and they killed they killed all the women they killed all the children they killed everybody when they went into this when they fought against this Tribe of Benjamin so it ends up to where they they go and they conquer another city and they kill everybody again except for certain women and they take those women and they marry them off to the Tribe of Benjamin I know it's a very strange story um but it's it's really strange if you read it but it's um it's the word so they they end up doing this but you see there you see the rage that was produced when just this one Mo woman that belonged to this levite what happened to her and you see Israel how they they took such care in their own people they conquered them and then they said well we can't wipe them out so we got to help them you see this comaraderie that's not anywhere else I believe in the world and remember these people people in Israel today are descendants maybe 3,000 years ago or whatever it is they're descendants of these 12 tribes so now we look and we see that Israel as I said last week it's been almost it was 1900 and something years that Israel the the early 1900s we see this anti-Semitism start and we see the Jewish people they start to be pulled back to their Homeland and there's always been this great hatred of of these Jewish people and they they start they come back they start coming back to their Homeland there was these 12 people that came from Europe and there was 10 men and two women and they started in the in the early 1900s they they came home they they ran away from the persecution that was happening there and they started a farm just south of the Sea of Galilee called the kots and so they they started this Farm the farm grew and then these these little settlements they started going they started popping up all over this land of Israel those are going to come up later on and as this anti-Semitism grew in in Russia and millions of of them started being exterminated and it started to grow with Hitler in Germany and in Poland and millions of Jews started being exterminated they wanted a place to go where they could be safe and as history suggests the only place that they feel safe is is among their own people so as this anti-Semitism and as as this extermination of the Jews continued on in World War II and in stalling Russia they came home and they formed this country called Israel and we know that that in 1948 Israel the United Nations publicly announced that this Israel would become a nation and their plan was the un's plan was to partition Israel into an Arab side and a Jewish side and the Jews said we agree the Arab says no we don't agree so the day after that they had made this nation the Arab countries attacked Israel and it was it should have been a Slaughter they had no organized army they had no really way to fight they they had a few people that were trained what happened was American Jews started coming in with fighter fighter planes totally outgun outnumbered and then the Lord fights for Israel and protects them and then we see after that we see that in 1967 the Arab Nations they got together they got their buddies together with Iraq and Lebanon and and Jordan and and um especially Egypt and they again attacked these Jewish people and God again delivered them in amazing amazing way Miracle after Miracle after Miracle trying to exterminate at these people Genesis 121 says this now the Lord said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from th father's house and unto the land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed so we see that that this nation of Israel whether you agree with them or not they are blessed by the word of God Zechariah 12 verse one says this the burden of the Lord for Israel saith sayeth the Lord which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and forth the spirit of man within behold I will make Jerusalem a cou of trembling unto the people round about when they shall be in The Siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem and in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all the people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it prophesying here that everyone is going to be against this little country but I the Lord will fight for them Ezekiel chapter 38 listen to this and tell me which side that you want to be on Verse 18 and it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog God represents the countries from the North and the East like Russia and Iran and others shall come against the land of Israel sayeth the Lord God that my Fury shall come up in my face for I for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel so that the fishes of the Sea and the fowls of the Heaven and the beasts of the field and all the all the creeping things that creep upon the Earth and all men that are upon the face of the Earth shall shake at my presence and the mountain shall be thrown down and the Steep places shall fall and every wall shall fall to the ground and I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains sayith the Lord God every man's sword shall be against his brother and I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood and I will reign upon him and upon his hands and upon the many people that are with him and overflowing rain and great hailstones and fire and brim Stones thus will I magnify myself and sanctify myself and I will be known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that I am the Lord which side do you want to be on God is fighting for Israel then immediately after this 1967 war that they won they had an Arab Summit in Sudan they said the three famous NOS all of these Arab groups got together three NOS no recognition of Israel's right to exist as a nation no peace we will never have peace with Israel and no negotiations these things are not negotiable they made their stand and they reiterated that stand that we will not have peace with this country and then in 1973 the yam Kapur War happened in October and again the Arab countries gathered all their friends together and they came against Israel Israel and Israel fought for their lives once again and Israel defeated them now 50 years later that was the last time that Israel declared war on another Nation exactly 50 years to the day the attack was made from Gaza onto the Israeli people Prim back in we know what Gaza is back in 2005 and I'm trying to lay Foundation of what's going on so we all kind of understand the situation over there in 2005 the prime minister of Israel Ariel Chiron he made a decision to withdraw the troops out of Gaza brother if you can put that picture up just so we know where we're at that they could withdraw all the troops out of the Gaza Strip now Gaza here you see it down in the lower left part of Israel where the pointer is there that's a it's a small place but there was there were thousands of Jewish settlers there there were thousands of farmers there there was the the Israeli defense um force and then there was also police and all that so Ariel Chiron says okay we'll give you the Gaza Strip we'll pull out all of our people that was in 2005 and and you can see there in Gaza it it borders Egypt and and you see Israel well the people came out the the Jewish people came out of that area and that was in 2005 thank you brother Jeremy that was in 2005 then in 2006 they elected this group called Hamas to govern they had a vote and they elected this group Hamas to govern um Gaza this newly independent area of Israel called Gaza and um Hamas is an acronym for the Islamic resistance movement it was started by a militant group called The mus Muslim Brotherhood and that was the last time that they voted and the Hamas Charter and I'd like to read a couple things that this Hamas Charter says and it's a a series of 36 articles in it Article 13 says this there is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad sort of like a religious war and fighting and initiatives proposals and international conferences are a waste of time and vain Endeavors and all of these different articles that they have there are basically laying a foundation for this the the situation with Israel and it's basically we will never recognize these people we want them gone and I as I was reading these articles I did I did think one part of it was a little bit humorous and it defines the role article 18 defines the role of women as Homemakers and child rearers and I think wow the LI the Liberals support Palestinians and uh I thought but if a pastor preaches that kind of thing he gets attacked Hamas attacked Israel on the 50th anniversary of the yam Kapur War and what did it accomplish like to ask you all to ask yourselves what why would they do this they know they can't win and if they're backed by Iran why would what would aan hope to accomplish by having these men fly over the walls go under the walls and go through the the the walls and to attack these these areas the kabut I don't know what the plural of Kuts is but these little farms in these settlements what did they hope to do they're not going to win a war with Israel no they don't think that but I think that Israel has been actively seeking peace and negotiations with their neighbors Saudi Arabia in particular and you look at what's going on J you can turn you can put the M map off so you see what's what's going on there why would Iran and these militant groups why would they encourage the Israelis or why would they encourage Hamas to go and attack these innocent people what they want to do is they want to see dead women and children Palestinian women and children on the news I'm not picking on the news media but what do they want to see they want to see these images of these dead Palestinian children because Israel remember the story in in U judges Israel is going to come in and they are going to fight and these people are there's going to be innocent lives lost and they are going to show these people on the news and it's going to create a negative opinion of this country of Israel that's why you always he use restraint use restraint and and many of us are like yeah go get them fight them they they attacked you go get them and kill them but wait a minute if they go in people are going to die innocent people are going to die children are going to die women are are going to die and they're going to put those people on the news to sway public opinion and now even we look at Saudi Arabia they started to turn from Israel now over to Iran in their talks and we're already seeing it on college campuses Israel has no right to go in there and they're going to start showing these images of these these dead people and it's going to sway opinion and that's the whole thing every country all countries are going to come against this Israel how is that going to happen I'm not saying that this is I'm not trying to prophesy or saying that this is going to be the way it happens but look at what's going on they watch on television these dead Palestinians it's Israel's fault how dare they and it starts to change public opinion and if they go too far you're going to see everyone saying hey you're going too far now and it could bring all countries against this Israel and here is Israel these people that have come through the Holocaust they have been attacked defenseless men women babies killed in this attack and you look back at the fifth seal we understand from Brother brandom teaching that here are these Souls that are under the Altar and they're crying out to avenge our blood how long Lord are you going to wait until you avenge our blood here's the Rage of these people that have been done wrong they want revenge and and now we see them going in I believe in the Lord's will but now watch how everyone is going to see this happen we see in Revelation 11 we see that there would come to these Jewish people in Jerusalem there would be these two witnesses they would be preaching the gospel and yet they would be killed and lay in the streets for three days and the whole world would see it how would the whole world see it without this spoken of in Revelation 11 how can the whole world see something well you see it because it's on television it's on the internet so they see this all of this that's going on in Gaza and you watch these these protests are going to get more and they're going to get more as this if they do have a ground invasion and people start dying and they have to because they build their they build their safe houses underneath hospitals and underneath schools and all that it's going to happen and you're going to see more and more negative sentiment come I pray that he has Mercy I pray that this isn't the beginning of something really big so we see we see all of this happening and as I said don't get too caught up as I said last week with the alarm clock God's time piece we see it there and it should wake us up that these time the time is late now if the time is late what about us what are we doing how are we getting our lives straight when they went when Hamas attacked it was in an hour no one thought it was going to happen how many times have you heard Jesus say in reading your Bible it'll be in an hour when you think not that the Lord will come he'll come as a thief in the night it's going to be like it was in the days of Noah they're like oh everything's good I'm just going on living my life and everything's good marrying and and giving in marriage and eating and drinking like nothing else is happening and then boom it's over and you missed it I missed it if we're not ready so when Hamas attacked it was a secret they kept it very hidden they had bulldozzer come in and knock down the fence and they came in through motorbikes there that way they flew in with ultral light air planes two of them on top on those and flying in and and coming in and attacking then they went under the tunnels they had every way that they had they sent these drones over and they had grenades or bombs on them they they would drop them on the on the communication devices so the Israelis couldn't talk to each other they came in in as quiet and as easy as they could and then they started massacring people and I want to relate us to this they come in the Israeli people had these things called safe houses and there are places that they would go to in their house a safe room that's fortified so when the bombs start dropping they had a place to go that was safe the attackers knew where these places were they knew these homes they knew what these Israelis had been trained to do when the siren starts going off they knew to go into your safe house because they're used to the bombs coming from the sky so when this happened they came in and they all went to their safe their safe houses and the attackers knew exactly where they would be they came and they were locked they're in there and they would either kidnap them kill them burn their houses around them they knew where these people would be but there were a few there was a there was a grandfather he heard that this attack was going on he had a he had a pistol this grandfather gets in his car and goes to his grandchildren with his pistol and fights off the attackers and saves his grandchildren there's another one I just read this morning that there's a man that he was he was in his safe house with his family and they barricaded the door and the the the attacker started shooting through the door and he could see the little holes and he had his gun in there and he returned fire and then they left they came back with a grenade launcher got it up to his shoulder boom he shoots the guy in the leg they take off he protects his family he protects his his his loved ones it's not all friends it's not all about defense it's not all about just hiding in your safe house that's what where so many people make their mistake is I'm going to just I'm just going to get in my little house I'm going to hide and I know that if the bombs come I'm going to be safe but what if the enemy comes right into your house are your children trained are you trained to fight back Tim I'm not talking about a Insurrection reprising here I'm talking about spiritual things see it in the paper this guy's trying to start a [Laughter] war but they they were able to fight back those ones that could fight instead of just hunkering down in our little our little safe house it could be our tomb we must be able to come out and to fight for the Lord how do we fight we fight in prayer we fight in study we go out and get the lost loved ones and bring them back not hunker down in our safe house afraid that something's going to happen to us that's right teach our children here is the word here here is how you preach the gospel here is how you go out and you get a lost soul and bring that person back just like these old generals there were 65 70 year old generals that when this when they heard this was going on on their phones they got what they had and they went to battle against these Invaders God blessed them saved many because they were trained and the same for us we must not hunker down and be afraid of the devil coming against us the gospel is not always defensive sometimes you go on the offense and you go and you get those lost souls and you bring them back Ephesians chapter 6 says this verse 10 the Apostle Paul speaking he says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities it's not in this case what I'm speaking of today it's not a flesh and blood B battle for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places the stakes are higher from for us and the devil coming into our homes to kill us than it is for our flesh wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gir about with truth and having your bless breastplate of righteousness and your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all take the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to Quin all the fiery darts of the wicked look at this everything that I've said is defensive you're covered with armor you're holding the shield of Faith you have the helmet of salvation on these things are defensive to protect us and our families this is this safe house yeah we fortify this so if the bombs come raining down we can get to safety but take the h and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God it's not all getting into the safe house and hunkering down a sword is not a defense defensive weapon a sword is for offense a sword is used to strike the enemy and how do we do that praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints remember David's text what a burden that he had for his people says right here with all perseverance and supplications for All Saints how much do we fall short a brother or a sister is going through something hard and we just get into our safe house put our feet up watching on Fox news or are we going to battle for these people are we really praying for them is there really a burden in our hearts in my heart is there a burden that should be there or is it just well it's a long way away doesn't really matter to me watching there unto watch the enemy moves know his tactics he wants to get inside your home he wants to lock you up and think that you're in a safe house and then he's going to burn it around you and as for me that utterance that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly and make known The Mystery of the Gospel for which I am an ambassador in bonds that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak we close if the musicians could come I'm talking about this Safe House friends and we get as I as I spoke a couple weeks ago about this simulation of Christianity and It produced a lot of questions among the people and there were a number brothers and sisters that came to me and they said listen I feel like I'm flying around in a video game and this whole Christianity thing isn't real I need something real and the question always came how do I get it what do I need to do to get that real thing to receive that new birth what do I have to get and the answer is it has to be the number one most important thing in your life it's more important than your job it's more important than than your friends it's more important that than your social status everything must go back to Lord I have to have that new birth I have to be filled with your spirit and if you don't care if it's not that important then you're not going to get it it has to be number one in our lives and instead we think just because we're in this fortified house like these Jews were that we're safe because the alarm went off well the alarm went off and it didn't come like they thought it was going to come the attack didn't come from up here the attack came from down here totally unexpected and that's where many of us are we think that we're in this safe house because oh we have a message or we have a a good church or we have any of this and it's it's a safe house it is safe there's nothing wrong with it but there is more because the enemy can come from a different angle and you look at the gospel the Bible says in Ezekiel that only those that sigh and cry for the sins of the city would be saved how many how many of us are in that place or are we just sitting in a safe house saying I'm good I'm good I got a message I got a church I live a good life it's a safe house but don't burn in that safe house because the enemy is coming he's coming for each of us and if it's not the most most important thing in our lives that we have that relationship with Christ I ask you to please re-evaluate your relationship do you know him is he real is it the most important thing in your life Lord I will give everything whatever it is Lord I'll give it and sometimes you have to draw your sword remember when he tried to come into my house I drew that sword and I had to to protect my family because Satan was on his way he was coming in not past me I'd rather die there's that man with his gun and he's got a door between him and death between his family and death and he protected them the old man going to protect his grandkids with a pistol against automatic weapons and he was successful because God was with him and it's the same with us the prayer of a righteous man the Bible says availeth [Music] much don't think because you are in a safe house don't think because you don't see sin around you don't think it's not coming don't think it's not already there there is something more the enemy comes in like a flood comes in everywhere Isaiah said but God will raise up a standard against him that standard today is the Holy Ghost it's Jesus Jesus Christ Living in the individual and the rage that happens and what we're seeing overseas right now we're we're we're seeing maybe a change remember this is the worst day last Saturday was the worst day in Israel's history yes since back to 1948 it was the worst day of that country more people lost their lives in that one day than any other day in all of these Wars one day and it came in through a a sneak attack when everything was going on just good everything's fine and as our as the Apostle Paul says here he says our battle is not with flesh and blood our b battle is a spiritual battle and I encourage you you friends it is the most important thing in the world don't be caught up in the safe house as I was talking about the simulation of Christianity and flying around in a in a jet simulator just because you're flying and just because you have all the cockpit and everything going doesn't mean you are a Christian you may look like a Christian act like a Christian talk like a Christian but un until you receive that new birth that the Lord Jesus talked about you are not there you're just in a safe house don't forget the word not only is defensive but it's also offensive let's all [Music] stand I felt in my heart to cancel service tonight I want I want you to spend time with your families talk to each other be a blessing to each other talk about what's going on in the world love one another encourage one another to know Jesus Christ we may be in this safe house but ask yourself do I really know what the blood of Christ is about do I understand it or is I am I just going along like I've been warned not to do let's bow our [Music] [Music] heads can't get over that text that David sent me the passion that he [Music] had as I look across our audience how many people here are being attacked and may not even know [Music] it Lord God pray that your hand would be upon all those overseas father all those in Israel father have mercy on the innocent and father we pray that peace would rain we know that it's one day it's not going to rain and one day that that there will be a war and all guns will be pointed at Israel Lord we ask that you would stay your wrath so that we might go and witness and bring up others to [Music] Christ father forgive us of our weaknesses and thinking maybe more highly of ourselves than we should think pray father that your will would be done and that we would be in your will and that we would truly have that sword which is the word of God may it be so Lord we love you we thank you father I pray for each person that's here you knew all of us you knew who would walk in these doors Lord I pray that for all who have come [Music] today that the spirit of God would deal with each one father that your hand would be upon them Lord that that your spirit would speak to them not not a church father but but greater than a church God himself speaking to the individual may it be so Lord may we all know you better and understand you better Lord and we'll do our best father in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] Amen to thee to thee in even though it be a cross that raes me still all my song shall be Nearer My God to thee near my God to thee nearer to thee though like the wer the sun gone down Darkness be over me my rest of stone yet in my dreams i' be Nearer My God to thee Nearer My God to thee nearer to thee there let the way appear steps onto Heaven all that thou sendest me in Mercy given and angels to back in me Nearer My God to thee Nearer My God to thee nearer to thee then with my wakeing thoughts right with thy praise out of my Stoney griefs in I'll raise so by my w to be Nearer My my God to [Music] him my God to thee nearer to thee or if on joyful Wing cleaving the sky Sun MO moon and stars forgot upward I fly still all my song shall be Nearer My God to thee Nearer My God to thee near to thee brothers and [Music] sisters there is coming a [Music] time when this Life as we know it is going to come to an end there's coming a time when these prophecies from all the prophets are going to come to pass it's going to happen and my burden is to see all of you brothers and sisters don't think that you are safe just because you built this shelter around you that's good and you should but there is a walk with Christ that we all need to have and that walk with Christ is not a church it's not a message it's not anything other than the Holy Spirit dwelling in human fa in human flesh and that's you and me I pray that this church WIll point you that I know the message of the hour point you to that but make sure you don't stop keep moving understand God learn more about him get into this book don't just go go home into your safe house put your feet up and watch all of this stuff happening around you get in the fight get in the battle if an old man can go and fight for his people all of us can too and we fight as the Apostle Paul said not with flesh and blood amen but with our prayers amen with our witness with our testimony laying hands on the sick and them recovering yes amen leading souls to Jesus Christ through salvation friends it's not cliche yes amen it's the truth amen make sure that you have that walk make sure yes because if you don't the same fate is going to happen to you and happen to anybody else as those people that were in those safe houses they thought that they were safe but they were not be safe come into the Peace of Jesus Christ know him know God God bless you friends as I said no service tonight take time love your families love your friends be with them spend some time with the Lord that personal that personal time I'll be gone this week I'll be um leaving tomorrow
