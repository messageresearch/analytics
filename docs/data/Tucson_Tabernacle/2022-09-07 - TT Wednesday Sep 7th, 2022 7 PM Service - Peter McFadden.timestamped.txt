[26:54] lord
[26:56] that you could speak
[26:57] [Music]
[26:59] lord we need your words in this
[27:02] day lord this
[27:04] this dark time that we're going through
[27:06] father when
[27:09] lord it'll be your grace that brings us
[27:11] through
[27:11] [Music]
[27:12] father nothing
[27:14] [Music]
[27:15] nothing of our own strength or power but
[27:17] lord by your power by your might through
[27:20] your blood lord
[27:21] you lead your children with a still and
[27:23] small voice father
[27:25] [Music]
[27:26] you still whisper
[27:28] love to your own lord to your bride
[27:34] would you have
[27:36] total preeminence lord in everything
[27:38] that's said and done lord let it not be
[27:39] to lift up any flesh but lord let you be
[27:42] glorified
[27:44] and father the needs that we have
[27:46] father we're blind to many of them
[27:50] but you know
[27:53] so father give us that which we have
[27:54] need of i pray
[27:57] [Music]
[27:58] we can't ask too much from you lord
[28:02] you're you're the source that'll never
[28:04] run dry father
[28:07] help us just to press in closer to you
[28:09] father
[28:11] and as we go from here lord let us not
[28:13] leave from your presence but lord let us
[28:17] just be caught up a little higher just
[28:18] like enoch that walked
[28:20] with you until one day he just
[28:22] didn't go back to his old ways
[28:25] just came up with you father we believe
[28:27] that
[28:28] that's our calling in this days
[28:31] to take a walk like enoch walked lord
[28:34] help us father to walk that way lord day
[28:37] by day more and more
[28:40] to be filled with your love lord that
[28:41] there'd be nothing to come and divide us
[28:43] lord nothing that would get us to
[28:46] have any hatred in our hearts towards
[28:48] each other lord but
[28:51] the people would
[28:52] know that we're your disciples by our
[28:54] love one for another
[28:58] pray these things lord have your way
[29:00] keep my lips from saying anything that's
[29:02] not your pure word and due season
[29:06] and anoint the years of the year father
[29:09] if we ask these things with expectation
[29:11] that you'll grant it father
[29:13] in jesus name amen
[29:16] amen let's turn to psalm 63
[29:20] verse 1. thank you sister martha
[29:33] this is a psalm of david
[29:36] when he was in the wilderness of judah
[29:40] another another place very dry like like
[29:43] our surroundings
[29:45] they've got
[29:46] entire
[29:49] seas that are dead
[29:50] so salty and you wouldn't even think an
[29:53] ocean could be dead and dry but that's
[29:55] that's the condition of this place that
[29:57] david was often hiding and running for
[29:59] his life
[30:01] but
[30:02] but look what comes out of his heart
[30:04] when he's in such a place
[30:09] he says oh god
[30:11] thou art my god
[30:13] early will i seek thee
[30:16] my soul thirsteth for thee
[30:19] that's what he's thirsting for
[30:22] is for god my flesh longeth for thee in
[30:25] a dry and thirsty land where no water is
[30:28] to see thy power
[30:30] and thy glory
[30:32] so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary
[30:35] because thy loving-kindness is better
[30:37] than life
[30:38] my lips shall praise thee
[30:41] thus will i bless thee while i live i
[30:44] will lift up my hands in thy name
[30:47] my soul shall be satisfied do you have
[30:49] that confidence though you're in a dry
[30:52] place
[30:53] as you call out to the lord my soul
[30:56] shall be satisfied
[30:59] as with marrow and fatness
[31:01] my mouth shall praise thee with joyful
[31:03] lips
[31:06] is that a prophecy of you
[31:08] my mouth lord will praise you with
[31:10] joyful lips
[31:13] when i remember thee upon my bed and
[31:15] meditate on thee in the night watches
[31:19] because thou hast been my help
[31:21] therefore in the shadow of thy wings
[31:24] will i rejoice
[31:26] my soul followeth hard after thee
[31:29] thy right hand upholdeth me another
[31:32] translation says
[31:34] my soul clings to you
[31:36] thy right hand upholdeth me
[31:39] that's david's thirst and then let's go
[31:42] to john
[31:43] chapter 4 verse 13.
[31:48] i always
[31:50] seem to
[31:51] when i'm
[31:52] studying to to get some
[31:54] some scriptures together it seems like
[31:57] there's always
[31:59] such beautiful scripture for any subject
[32:02] that i've
[32:03] i've thought on or meditated on or
[32:06] studied
[32:07] it's always been the case that there's
[32:10] this same theme in the old testament
[32:12] and it's brought out in the new
[32:14] testament
[32:15] and it's been such a blessing to me to
[32:16] see that that no matter what the thought
[32:18] is or what it is
[32:20] it's always something that
[32:24] runs through the bible because this is a
[32:26] perfect book
[32:28] john chapter 4
[32:30] verse 13 this is jesus
[32:33] answered and said
[32:35] unto her this is the woman at the well
[32:38] said unto her
[32:39] whosoever drinketh of this water
[32:42] shall thirst again
[32:45] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[32:47] i
[32:47] shall give him
[32:49] shall never thirst
[32:52] but the water that i shall give him
[32:54] shall be in him
[32:56] a well of water springing up
[32:59] into everlasting life amen you may be
[33:02] seated
[33:07] so
[33:11] i'd like to talk for a few minutes on
[33:13] thirst
[33:15] and
[33:16] maybe part of this came from
[33:19] we were blessed to go up to for the
[33:21] enoch peterson and sister jessica
[33:23] peterson's
[33:25] wedding
[33:26] and
[33:28] this is the first time i'd really been
[33:29] up to that part of the country boise
[33:31] idaho
[33:32] and
[33:34] flying over there it's quite a place
[33:37] because it's amazing that
[33:39] from whatever vantage point you're at
[33:41] and from whatever place you you can see
[33:44] you can immediately tell
[33:46] the condition of that
[33:48] place that you're seeing
[33:51] and whether it has water or not
[33:53] from the airplane or from across the
[33:55] valley or wherever you're at you can
[33:57] just look a long ways off
[33:59] and all the places up there in idaho
[34:02] that have got water that have got a well
[34:04] or have got a river a stream or
[34:06] something
[34:08] they're pretty
[34:09] there's trees and there's there's good
[34:11] grass and crops and
[34:14] animals and different things
[34:16] but then everywhere else it just looks
[34:18] like a potato
[34:19] it's just this brown ugly barren dusty
[34:24] nothing just dead
[34:27] people think that this desert around
[34:29] here is
[34:30] is barren and desolate but the desert up
[34:33] there i mean it's
[34:34] i guess it gets bombarded by the heat
[34:36] and by the snow and just
[34:38] it's brutal up there
[34:41] but
[34:42] it just got me thinking about water
[34:45] and
[34:46] it was amazing to see that you'd be
[34:48] driving down the road
[34:50] away from everything
[34:52] and you'd see on the one side of the
[34:53] road
[34:54] there's a well there's irrigation and
[34:56] there's just green fields real nice
[34:59] and the ground on the other side of the
[35:00] road i mean this is just
[35:02] 10
[35:03] 15 feet away
[35:04] where there's no well there's no
[35:06] irrigation
[35:07] it's just dead it's just nothing
[35:11] and
[35:13] it was just something to to see the
[35:15] power of water
[35:17] and to see that
[35:19] i think sometimes we get the idea you
[35:21] know this
[35:22] this word
[35:24] is water talks about washing water by
[35:26] the word this word is spirit and its
[35:29] life
[35:30] this word and when it comes in in its
[35:32] purity when it comes in in true
[35:34] anointing when it comes in its entirety
[35:37] not having been
[35:39] sliced and diced and mixed up
[35:41] its water its life
[35:44] and i think
[35:45] sometimes we
[35:47] we put too little confidence
[35:50] in the word of god
[35:52] because
[35:53] up there
[35:55] there were no places
[35:57] that there was water and there was
[35:58] nothing growing
[36:00] everywhere that there was water there
[36:02] was life
[36:04] and
[36:05] i didn't see any farmers out there that
[36:08] were irrigating that said oh i hope this
[36:10] works i hope this this water does what
[36:12] it's supposed to do
[36:15] you know they were just putting it out
[36:17] there in in
[36:18] in they had faith
[36:20] in what they were
[36:21] going through all this work to get out
[36:23] there they did a lot of work they had to
[36:25] dig down wells to it
[36:27] dig way down i believe that's what
[36:28] brother enoch has been doing is digging
[36:30] wells
[36:31] and there's jacob in the old testament
[36:34] doug some wells you know this is worth
[36:36] working for
[36:38] this is worth going down and
[36:41] and whatever it takes
[36:43] get down to that water
[36:45] and then bring it up spread it out
[36:48] because it will bring forth life
[36:52] and i believe we ought to have
[36:55] confidence in this word that
[36:59] we wouldn't be ashamed of this gospel
[37:02] because no matter
[37:04] if you really preach this word
[37:08] in its purity it will bring life
[37:11] now we know not everyone's predestinated
[37:13] to eternal life and some people are just
[37:16] going to
[37:17] be blessed for a little while and
[37:18] they're going to fall away but that's
[37:21] that's above our pay grade that's not
[37:22] our business
[37:25] but everybody
[37:27] everything
[37:29] will be blessed by the pure word of god
[37:32] because it's water
[37:33] so don't be ashamed
[37:35] to be a christian
[37:36] to let your light shine
[37:39] because it is
[37:41] what turns the dry
[37:44] desolate
[37:45] desert
[37:47] into green
[37:48] beauty
[37:50] and that's
[37:52] that's something that i was just so
[37:53] inspired to see in a set and i just
[37:55] got to thinking well lord
[37:58] make me a well
[37:59] make me
[38:00] make me somebody that would just
[38:02] work so hard to to dig down and and do
[38:06] whatever it takes lord that my life
[38:08] could just bring your water and spread
[38:10] it out that i could
[38:11] turn a little area around me beautiful
[38:14] because it's got nothing to do with me
[38:16] it's just got to do with the power of
[38:17] this water
[38:18] as long as i can just keep from
[38:20] contaminating my own
[38:22] self into it if i can just be a conduit
[38:25] and just pull this water from way down
[38:28] deep and push it out then
[38:31] around me will be beauty
[38:33] the people whose lives i touch they will
[38:36] be enriched
[38:37] i think that's the confidence that we
[38:39] should have in this gospel that it's not
[38:41] an insult when we witness to somebody
[38:43] it's not we're not giving them rotten
[38:45] fruits
[38:47] but we're giving them life
[38:49] we're giving them something that no
[38:50] matter who they are no matter where they
[38:52] are
[38:53] this will help you
[38:55] this will make your life better
[38:57] this will
[38:59] this will be a blessing
[39:00] and so that was the thinking that i had
[39:03] was to come back and preach okay
[39:04] everybody we all need to dig we all need
[39:06] to be real good well drillers
[39:08] we need to
[39:10] no matter how far deep it is let's just
[39:12] dig until
[39:14] but thank the lord i found this
[39:15] scripture that says
[39:17] it's not even that way we're not
[39:21] we're not supposed to be
[39:23] well diggers
[39:26] like that even though that's part of it
[39:28] but it's even better than that
[39:30] jesus says
[39:32] that if we drink of his water
[39:35] that this water would be a well of water
[39:38] springing up
[39:40] that's even better
[39:42] that's wonderful
[39:44] no that's
[39:46] that's glorious because i didn't have to
[39:48] work for it
[39:49] i just had to surrender to it
[39:52] i just had to keep out of the way
[39:54] and it's his work just like that little
[39:56] brook that we've heard about that's
[39:58] bubbling
[40:00] you know it's not me that's doing the
[40:01] bubbling
[40:03] it's just
[40:05] for the glory of god
[40:07] because he
[40:08] desired to come and destroy the works of
[40:11] the devil
[40:13] everything that would bring death
[40:15] and destruction and emptiness and
[40:17] barrenness
[40:19] he came that we would have life and that
[40:20] more abundantly
[40:22] this is good news
[40:24] this is good water
[40:27] but i was puzzled
[40:30] looking at this scripture i've been
[40:31] thinking a lot about this scripture
[40:33] in in john
[40:35] because
[40:39] it says
[40:40] he that drinks whosoever drinks of the
[40:42] water that i shall give him shall never
[40:43] thirst
[40:45] and so you see
[40:47] you see these scriptures like david
[40:50] and you see this man that's just so
[40:53] thirsty for god
[40:55] and you hear about some of the old-time
[40:58] you know prayer meetings and the
[40:59] old-time
[41:00] dedication
[41:02] you know people would wrestle all night
[41:04] with an angel
[41:06] right
[41:07] and there was this this desperate
[41:09] longing for more of god
[41:13] but then there's this scripture that
[41:15] says
[41:16] once you drink
[41:18] you'll never thirst
[41:20] and it's a little bit puzzling because
[41:24] that means you've been satisfied
[41:27] and that's a good thing
[41:29] but also what is this
[41:31] what of this thirst and i look and see
[41:35] in my own self
[41:37] you know is that the case am i really
[41:40] thirsting for god
[41:42] or am i not thirsty
[41:44] and
[41:45] and it's a little bit puzzling because
[41:48] you know we want to set the church in
[41:50] order and
[41:51] the church show this problem that
[41:52] problem well how do we do that we start
[41:54] with ourselves
[41:56] we start with what's in our own eye
[41:58] right say okay well if i can uh if i can
[42:01] get this guy straightened out first
[42:02] maybe i can help one of you guys but for
[42:04] now
[42:06] working on myself and what i see in
[42:07] myself is a complacency
[42:10] and where i see david
[42:12] and he's saying oh god early will i seek
[42:15] you
[42:16] i see myself wanting to sleep in
[42:18] and i see a laziness
[42:20] and i say is that the proper fulfillment
[42:24] of this scripture
[42:26] that
[42:27] i'm not thirsty because i've of drinking
[42:31] and i'm good
[42:32] and
[42:33] the thirsting was for the days gone by
[42:35] but once you're sealed then
[42:38] you know
[42:39] that's no longer a part of a christian
[42:41] walk
[42:44] and so i kind of wrestled with this
[42:47] with this scripture because it's
[42:50] these things are important i'll tell you
[42:52] i'll tell you a little testimony
[42:54] of um
[42:55] tonight
[42:57] we're gonna come to church and you know
[42:59] i've been running around working this
[43:00] and that and everybody's been running
[43:02] around taking care of the kids and so
[43:05] go to get in the car
[43:07] kids are all loaded
[43:09] the kids are all dressed for church
[43:10] lydia's all dressed for church her hair
[43:12] is done you know a lot of work had had
[43:15] gone into getting the mcfadden family
[43:18] ready for church
[43:19] i say a lot of work had been done it had
[43:21] been done by lydia
[43:22] i was i was studying and things but she
[43:25] put a lot of work into getting the kids
[43:26] ready to go
[43:28] everything and it was it was the right
[43:30] time she was on time i was really proud
[43:33] of her that she was on time
[43:36] and everything was good every we were
[43:38] all just
[43:40] ready for church
[43:43] but we couldn't find the key
[43:46] somewhere other the the car key had
[43:48] gotten
[43:49] hidden
[43:51] lost gone
[43:53] and there was no way to turn the car on
[43:55] there was gas in the car
[43:57] there was air in the tires there was an
[43:58] engine
[44:02] but we almost missed church
[44:06] because of something this big
[44:09] this little thing
[44:12] thanks lord lydia found the key i left
[44:14] her i left my wife to come to church and
[44:16] and then she found the key
[44:18] thank the lord
[44:20] and so she came
[44:22] but it got me thinking you know there
[44:24] will be people
[44:25] that are so ready for the rapture
[44:29] their hair is done their clothes are
[44:31] there they got their family lined up
[44:33] they're at the right place at the right
[44:34] time they've got gas in the engine
[44:36] they've got
[44:37] air in the tires
[44:40] but there's going to be a people that's
[44:44] missing
[44:46] just a little
[44:47] detail
[44:49] no oil in the lamp
[44:52] somewhere other
[44:54] they ran out of the spirit
[44:59] somewhere other that
[45:00] where there was supposed to be this
[45:02] well of water that was just pushing out
[45:04] and overflowing and they're supposed to
[45:06] just be
[45:08] every need supplied
[45:12] they got empty
[45:14] i thought oh god
[45:18] these are serious things
[45:21] i want to make sure that my satisfaction
[45:24] and my lack of thirst
[45:26] is the
[45:27] proper
[45:29] fulfillment of this scripture
[45:32] because
[45:34] we see in in the letter to the
[45:37] laodiceans we see a people
[45:39] that they think they got need of nothing
[45:42] and so they're not thirsting for
[45:43] anything they've got no
[45:45] no desire for any more of anything but
[45:48] spiritually they're so seriously lacking
[45:52] that they can't possibly make that
[45:54] rapture
[45:57] and i'm
[45:58] this this is for me right i'm not
[46:01] i'm not out here saying well you you're
[46:02] all dry potatoes like idaho i'm i'm i'm
[46:05] trying to figure out where i'm at
[46:08] and what i need
[46:10] and
[46:14] i'm so encouraged
[46:16] by this word because i believe that for
[46:18] every question that you can have there's
[46:20] an answer right there
[46:23] and i believe if we'll just be honest
[46:24] before the lord and say i don't
[46:25] understand this lord
[46:28] what's going on
[46:31] in his time i believe he'll show us
[46:34] and it won't be any contrary thing to
[46:35] this word it'll just line up perfectly
[46:37] with this word
[46:41] but in the psalms
[46:42] it says that our god
[46:45] satisfies the longing soul
[46:49] and he fills the hungry soul
[46:51] with goodness
[46:54] so i know that that's
[46:55] his desire
[46:57] for me
[47:00] is that i would be properly satisfied
[47:03] is that my soul
[47:05] once hungry would be filled with
[47:06] goodness
[47:08] and he's the only one good so you have
[47:10] to be filled with him
[47:13] and we know that when jesus is talking
[47:15] about these rivers of water it says
[47:17] later
[47:18] in john 7 it says that he spake of the
[47:21] spirit
[47:22] which they that should believe on him
[47:24] should
[47:25] receive so what he's talking about this
[47:27] this fountain that you'd never thirst
[47:29] again
[47:30] it's the spirit of god
[47:36] and so there's there's no thirst but
[47:39] then
[47:41] it's
[47:42] it's two parts it doesn't just say
[47:45] whosoever drinketh the water let's just
[47:48] put it up again john 4 14 just so we can
[47:50] see it together
[47:54] but
[47:56] i believe the answer is there in the
[47:57] scripture is it says whosoever drinketh
[48:00] of the water that i shall give him shall
[48:02] never thirst
[48:04] doesn't end there but the water that i
[48:06] shall give him shall be in him a well of
[48:09] water springing up onto everlasting life
[48:15] see the reason there's no thirst is
[48:17] because there's a continuous supply
[48:20] that as soon as you would start to get
[48:22] thirsty
[48:23] it's right there
[48:25] as soon as you would start to need a
[48:27] little more god
[48:29] he's there as soon as you would try to
[48:31] go and draw an eye to him he'd draw an
[48:33] eye to you
[48:34] if you take a step towards him he'd run
[48:36] to you
[48:37] prodigal
[48:39] that's our god
[48:41] you say oh know that you know once
[48:43] you're
[48:44] once you're all filled up that's just
[48:45] for everyone else that is for everyone
[48:47] else but the ox that treads the corn
[48:50] is not to be muzzled because
[48:52] the worker is supposed to eat that too
[48:54] that's for us too
[48:56] if we're not drinking we're dead
[48:59] we're just like the ugly part to idaho
[49:03] we're dry and we're dead
[49:06] and i don't want to be that
[49:08] i want to be
[49:10] quick i want to be alive i want
[49:12] i don't just want
[49:15] to have my soul
[49:17] sealed and filled with the spirit
[49:19] and then have the rest of my
[49:22] life the rest of my being just be
[49:24] cracked and dry and dead
[49:28] but i believe the desire of god for each
[49:30] of us
[49:32] is that we would just be fulfilled
[49:35] head to toe
[49:37] everywhere just with his spirit
[49:40] and i believe that
[49:44] there should be a desire in our hearts
[49:47] for that to be
[49:49] and i think
[49:50] if we come to the place that i can find
[49:52] myself in that we're just
[49:54] satisfied not to be drinking
[49:57] not to be
[49:59] taken and enjoying this fountain
[50:03] then i don't believe that that's the
[50:04] correct
[50:05] lack of thirst
[50:08] but i believe that though we're filled
[50:10] with the spirit there should still be a
[50:11] desire
[50:12] you know if
[50:14] if he's really
[50:17] if we're really the bride and he's
[50:19] really the groom
[50:20] he ought to mean everything to us
[50:23] we ought to be so in love with him
[50:27] that we just want to be where he is
[50:30] that we just want to sit at his feet and
[50:33] learn with him that we just want to be a
[50:34] door keeper in his house we just
[50:37] we ought to be twitter twitter-pated
[50:39] right
[50:41] and sometimes
[50:43] i don't see that i see a lack of desire
[50:46] for that
[50:49] and i don't want to be
[50:51] satisfied and empty i just want to be
[50:54] satisfied and filled
[50:56] i don't want to find myself
[50:58] at the end of the day
[51:00] having once had oil
[51:03] and you know maybe being
[51:07] maybe being saved still but empty
[51:12] but oh god just help me to
[51:15] to want you
[51:17] because i know that this scripture says
[51:19] i'll never thirst
[51:21] you know i heard a striking statement
[51:24] i may have said this before but i've
[51:25] been chewing on it
[51:28] and and the statement says
[51:30] you're as close to god as you want to be
[51:35] you've got as much of god as you want to
[51:37] have
[51:40] you're as in love with him as you want
[51:42] to be
[51:44] because if you would thirst
[51:46] if you would say oh god
[51:48] i want a little bit more
[51:51] that would be satisfied
[51:55] say oh god
[51:57] in my flesh i see such corruption won't
[52:00] you quicken me
[52:02] won't you make me alive
[52:05] there is a fountain
[52:08] we won't thirst
[52:11] but sometimes i feel like
[52:14] we've been
[52:18] just been made complacent
[52:21] there was a
[52:24] there was a quote here that i found from
[52:28] there's a preacher named tozer
[52:31] and i thought this was pretty good
[52:34] this kind of goes in line with that
[52:37] it says
[52:38] before we can be filled with the spirit
[52:41] the desire to be filled must be
[52:42] all-consuming
[52:44] it must be for the time the biggest
[52:46] thing in the life so acute
[52:48] so intrusive as to crowd out everything
[52:50] else
[52:53] and then it says
[52:54] the degree of fullness in any life
[52:57] accords perfectly with the intensity of
[53:00] true desire
[53:03] so how full any life is is perfectly in
[53:05] accord with the intensity of what the
[53:07] desire is
[53:09] we have as much of god as we actually
[53:12] want
[53:13] one great hindrance to the spirit-filled
[53:15] life
[53:16] is the theology of complacency
[53:20] so widely accepted among gospel
[53:22] christians today
[53:25] this lukewarmness right i don't know if
[53:27] mr brother tozer
[53:30] knew about legacy and church age and
[53:32] this lukewarmness
[53:34] but he could see this spirit of
[53:36] complacency
[53:38] that said well just give me enough just
[53:41] i'll be satisfied to be average
[53:47] and that is very widely
[53:50] accepted even
[53:52] you know even among us it's easy to just
[53:54] say well how's everyone else doing
[53:56] okay i'm about there
[53:59] good
[54:02] but i believe there ought to be
[54:03] something that's just drawing us like a
[54:05] magnet
[54:07] that just day by day oh
[54:10] maybe that was enough for yesterday but
[54:12] can i get a little closer today
[54:14] can i get a little more full today can i
[54:16] get a little more emptied out today
[54:19] can i be a little more green today
[54:24] he continues he says according to this
[54:26] acute view
[54:27] uh to this view acute desire is an evil
[54:30] evidence of unbelief and
[54:32] proof of lack of knowledge of the
[54:33] scripture so he's saying
[54:35] these uh these people that accept
[54:37] complacency think that anything else is
[54:39] just
[54:40] unbelief and
[54:42] lack of knowledge in the scriptures he
[54:43] says a sufficient refutation of this
[54:45] position
[54:47] is afforded by the word of god itself
[54:51] and by the fact that it always fails to
[54:53] produce real saintliness
[54:56] among those who hold it
[55:01] is that satisfaction that complacency is
[55:04] it producing the life of christ
[55:08] is it making real saints now we don't
[55:11] we don't judge on outward appearances
[55:14] we don't judge anything before it's time
[55:17] and so we don't you know even if we're
[55:20] not seeing what the promises are we
[55:22] still hold to the promises
[55:25] but at the same time we want to look and
[55:26] see
[55:27] well what fruits is this producing in my
[55:30] life
[55:31] am i satisfied am i not thirsting
[55:34] because
[55:36] this life of christ is a fountain coming
[55:39] out of me
[55:40] and i'm drinking from that fountain and
[55:42] other people are being blessed from that
[55:43] fountain and this is just according to
[55:45] the scriptures and that's why i'm not
[55:47] thirsty
[55:48] or am i not thirsty because i've fallen
[55:50] into this slumber
[55:53] this complacency
[55:55] because just like we're talking last
[55:57] time about every word
[55:59] you know if you take this and you only
[56:01] preach the parts that you like
[56:04] it's cursed your name if you take parts
[56:06] out of this
[56:07] your name is taken from the book of life
[56:09] it's a very serious thing
[56:12] and so
[56:14] we want to be sure that we've got the
[56:16] key
[56:19] he's the door he's the way i believe
[56:20] he's the key
[56:23] do we really have him
[56:25] is he our treasure
[56:29] are we satisfied because we've
[56:32] we've found that pro of great price and
[56:35] we're we've given everything for it
[56:38] where our treasure is there's where our
[56:39] heart will be also
[56:43] i have to ask myself
[56:45] lord
[56:47] were you my treasure today
[56:49] i know before
[56:52] you have been but lord have i
[56:54] have i changed my desires
[56:57] have i lost my first love
[56:59] have i been has my eyes been caught by
[57:02] the glitter and glamour of this world
[57:04] where am i at lord
[57:08] because in my heart
[57:10] i want to be what he wants me to be
[57:14] i want to be where he is
[57:16] there's
[57:18] so
[57:19] what i almost
[57:21] did tonight instead of speaking this is
[57:23] i almost played there's a there's a
[57:26] sermon called getting in the spirit
[57:29] and i almost just played that but
[57:31] if you get a chance to listen that i
[57:33] just believe it'd be a real blessing to
[57:34] you
[57:36] and
[57:37] in this
[57:38] this gets a little bit closer to the
[57:40] well
[57:42] well digging
[57:43] but it's not
[57:45] it's not that we've got to go and do it
[57:47] all ourselves
[57:48] but in this
[57:50] in this sermon getting in the spirit
[57:54] brother branham was talking about in the
[57:55] bible
[57:56] where
[57:58] the the king of israel ahab said hey
[58:01] come and fight with me to the king of
[58:02] judah come you know we're going to go
[58:04] fight together
[58:05] and they went up and it says they went
[58:08] seven days
[58:10] before they thought to ask of the lord
[58:12] what to do
[58:15] and what a striking thing that we can be
[58:17] all
[58:18] all ready to go and get her done
[58:22] that we don't consult with the lord
[58:26] say lord is this your will and and you
[58:28] know brother brandon was comparing that
[58:30] kind of to the seven church ages
[58:33] and then uh i couldn't help but think
[58:35] we've been we've been seven years now
[58:40] now i don't know if
[58:42] that's anything but
[58:44] i so
[58:45] believe that we ought to be
[58:47] desirous
[58:49] to be sure that
[58:52] there's nothing blocking us
[58:54] from that promise of this fountain
[58:57] because that's a promise that's for you
[58:59] whether you receive it
[59:02] or
[59:02] not he said whosoever will
[59:06] whosoever
[59:09] would drink of this water
[59:12] so if you if you have a desire for that
[59:15] you won't thirst
[59:17] he'll fill that desire
[59:19] and so brother branham's talking about
[59:21] this where they wait seven day seven
[59:23] days and then they ask the prophet
[59:26] okay what do we do
[59:28] and
[59:29] and the prophet says go down into the
[59:31] valley and dig you know make these
[59:33] make this valley full of ditches
[59:36] get real low go and
[59:38] dig everything else
[59:40] dig everything out
[59:42] and god supplied the water they didn't
[59:44] have to dig wells they didn't have to
[59:45] dig down to it
[59:47] but they had to do something
[59:49] they had to want to obey and they had to
[59:51] want to to clear whatever was
[59:54] in the way of
[59:56] of what god had told them to
[59:58] do and i thought well
[1:00:01] peter
[1:00:02] look at yourself what's
[1:00:05] what needs to be
[1:00:06] removed
[1:00:08] the brand was talking about like a well
[1:00:10] that got clogged up with logs
[1:00:12] and different things that would you know
[1:00:14] once this was a fountain once this was a
[1:00:17] life-giving source but
[1:00:19] things had gone and gotten in there
[1:00:22] and he says you don't need a new
[1:00:23] organization you don't need a new
[1:00:27] still small voice i think even said
[1:00:29] you just need to clean out what's gotten
[1:00:31] in there
[1:00:33] just over the time
[1:00:35] have we gotten old have we gotten stiff
[1:00:37] have we gotten hard
[1:00:39] and are we not thirsting just because
[1:00:41] we've gotten
[1:00:43] a little dry and
[1:00:45] and we're okay with it
[1:00:49] but i believe the lord is coming to
[1:00:50] restore our youth like the eagle
[1:00:54] just like abraham and sarah the last
[1:00:57] last sign there
[1:00:59] before the promised son is they were
[1:01:01] made young again
[1:01:03] and i believe where maybe we've gotten
[1:01:05] old and we've gotten
[1:01:07] kind of dried up i believe the lord's
[1:01:09] here to make us new again
[1:01:12] to bring us back to the joy of our
[1:01:14] salvation to bring us fully in love with
[1:01:16] him not to make us new again like we
[1:01:19] were in
[1:01:20] 65 or you know whenever you first came
[1:01:23] here but to make us pentecost new again
[1:01:27] to make us the original to take us all
[1:01:30] the way back
[1:01:31] until we would
[1:01:33] not even consider our own lives so we
[1:01:35] just say lord for your glory use me
[1:01:39] that he would be everything to us
[1:01:43] i believe that's what we're going to be
[1:01:44] restored back to and i believe that if
[1:01:46] we'll just want that
[1:01:49] that we won't thirst
[1:01:52] but that
[1:01:54] he satisfies the the hungry soul
[1:01:58] and he
[1:01:59] satisfies the long and soul and fills
[1:02:01] the hungry soul with goodness
[1:02:04] i believe that there are promises of god
[1:02:07] yet to be fulfilled in this bible
[1:02:09] for us
[1:02:12] but in my own self a lot of times
[1:02:15] i can be hungry here in church for that
[1:02:16] i can be desirous
[1:02:18] that but then
[1:02:19] during the week is that my treasure
[1:02:21] during the week
[1:02:22] or is that only my treasure three times
[1:02:24] a week
[1:02:26] is it three times a week i come to
[1:02:27] church no
[1:02:29] calvary means everything to me his
[1:02:32] people mean everything to me and then am
[1:02:34] i just living for myself the rest of the
[1:02:35] week
[1:02:38] i don't want to deceive myself you know
[1:02:44] but he promised
[1:02:46] that if we drink
[1:02:48] that's why we've got to drink every word
[1:02:51] we've just got to keep drawing in
[1:02:53] even though maybe i can't
[1:02:55] see it yet i can't understand it yet
[1:02:58] i just keep saying yes lord
[1:03:01] i'll take it lord yes
[1:03:03] help thou my unbelief oh lord
[1:03:06] take the scales off my eyes
[1:03:09] unstop my ears
[1:03:11] see he healed every manner
[1:03:14] of infirmity when he was here
[1:03:17] and that's to prove that he can do it
[1:03:20] but it's also to prove that whatever
[1:03:22] spiritual condition you have
[1:03:24] whatever your spiritual problem is
[1:03:27] he can heal that in the spiritual just
[1:03:29] like the natural if you've got ears that
[1:03:31] you just can't hear right
[1:03:34] he can open the deaf ears
[1:03:36] if you can't see right
[1:03:38] he can open the blind eyes
[1:03:40] if you can't walk right if you can see
[1:03:42] how a christian ought to walk but you
[1:03:44] just always walk crooked you always walk
[1:03:46] with a limp
[1:03:49] he's the healer of that
[1:03:53] and if you're spiritually dead
[1:03:56] he can raise the dead
[1:03:59] those dry bones that they got really dry
[1:04:03] and we always talk about that like
[1:04:05] that's a bad thing oh those bones were
[1:04:07] very dry
[1:04:09] maybe that was
[1:04:10] maybe that was good maybe the flesh that
[1:04:12] was on was the problem in the first
[1:04:14] place i don't know
[1:04:16] but whatever it is
[1:04:19] he can help us
[1:04:24] but let's just look to him let's look to
[1:04:26] his promises that i really encourage you
[1:04:28] to go listen to that sermon
[1:04:30] but here was a part of it that
[1:04:33] kind of jumped out to me
[1:04:35] is um
[1:04:44] so he says here
[1:04:47] god wants to call us together
[1:04:51] are you interested in what god wants i
[1:04:54] am
[1:04:56] god wants to call us together in a unity
[1:04:58] of power
[1:05:00] to bring back the fullness of the holy
[1:05:02] ghost
[1:05:04] into the church again
[1:05:07] with all the spiritual gifts in
[1:05:09] operation
[1:05:10] in every local body
[1:05:13] that's what he wants
[1:05:17] are we hungry for that are we thirsty
[1:05:19] for that does that
[1:05:21] are we interested
[1:05:24] because he said we wouldn't thirst
[1:05:27] so if we would if we would just say yes
[1:05:29] lord amen
[1:05:32] then before we could get too thirsty i
[1:05:33] believe we'd see it i believe
[1:05:36] that that spirit would just brood over
[1:05:39] us
[1:05:42] i believe it's the time
[1:05:49] you know when i look at
[1:05:58] i look at paul's life
[1:06:02] god used this man he i mean he took him
[1:06:05] off his high horse
[1:06:09] he supernaturally moved in this man's
[1:06:11] life that we could have so much of the
[1:06:12] of the new testament what a blessing and
[1:06:15] so
[1:06:16] i do believe that he was
[1:06:18] filled with the holy ghost
[1:06:22] and i believe he said follow me as i
[1:06:24] follow christ so i want to see how did
[1:06:26] he follow christ was he just
[1:06:29] not thirsty anymore and just
[1:06:32] you know well just waiting to be picked
[1:06:34] up boys
[1:06:37] but in in philippians 3 if we can go to
[1:06:39] philippians 3 and 8 and read through
[1:06:41] here
[1:06:43] when i see what paul's attitude is
[1:06:46] towards christ i see such a desire
[1:06:51] that i want in my own life
[1:06:54] and i want to say amen
[1:06:56] because in philippians
[1:06:59] 3 and 8.
[1:07:00] he says and we'll read down philippians
[1:07:03] 3 8
[1:07:05] read down to verse 16.
[1:07:09] he says
[1:07:11] ye doubtless
[1:07:13] and i count all things but loss
[1:07:16] for the excellency
[1:07:17] of the knowledge of jesus christ my lord
[1:07:21] for whom i have suffered loss of all
[1:07:23] things
[1:07:24] and you count them but dung
[1:07:26] that i may win christ
[1:07:30] so he's
[1:07:31] you can see where his treasure is is to
[1:07:33] know christ
[1:07:36] and that's what i want is
[1:07:39] where he says that i may win christ he
[1:07:41] says later that i may know him but here
[1:07:43] he says if philippians 3 and 8
[1:07:46] if we can put up
[1:07:49] you know everything else is secondary
[1:07:52] but he has this
[1:07:54] he's still pressing towards us that i
[1:07:56] may win christ and then philippians 3
[1:07:59] and 9
[1:08:00] we'll read the next verse and be found
[1:08:03] in him
[1:08:04] not having my own righteousness
[1:08:07] which is of the law
[1:08:09] but that which is through the faith of
[1:08:11] christ the righteousness which is of god
[1:08:13] by faith
[1:08:16] that i may know him
[1:08:20] see it's not well i do know him no he's
[1:08:23] not he's not saying he's already there
[1:08:26] but he's saying that i may know him
[1:08:28] that i may
[1:08:30] he's
[1:08:31] you could almost say he's thirsty
[1:08:35] we know that
[1:08:37] the bible says he'll never thirst
[1:08:39] but it's like he's getting ready to
[1:08:40] thirst and the lord's just day by day
[1:08:42] giving him his daily bread
[1:08:46] is that our desire though are we praying
[1:08:48] lord
[1:08:49] whatever spiritual bread you have for me
[1:08:51] today
[1:08:52] i need it
[1:08:54] are we still asking that are we still
[1:08:55] praying that part of the lord's parents
[1:08:57] and lord
[1:08:59] it's another day i need more bread i
[1:09:00] need more wine
[1:09:02] i need a little bit of something to pick
[1:09:04] me up here i need a little joy
[1:09:08] i believe we should be drunk in the
[1:09:10] spirit
[1:09:11] that's that's what they were back at
[1:09:13] pentecost you can't say well we're going
[1:09:14] all the way back to pentecost and we're
[1:09:16] just going to be
[1:09:17] all theologians
[1:09:19] no they were drunks
[1:09:21] drunks on the spirit but
[1:09:23] but see it's
[1:09:24] it's a kind of drunkenness that
[1:09:27] causes you to give your life for others
[1:09:31] it doesn't just lift you up and make you
[1:09:33] just fool yourself but it makes you
[1:09:36] always empty out and just surrender to
[1:09:39] the lord
[1:09:40] it says that i may know him
[1:09:42] and the power of his resurrection and
[1:09:44] the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:09:47] being made conformable unto his death
[1:09:50] if by any amine any means
[1:09:54] i might attain unto the resurrection of
[1:09:56] the dead
[1:09:58] not as though i had already attained
[1:10:01] either already perfect
[1:10:03] but i follow after
[1:10:05] if that i may apprehend that for which
[1:10:07] also i am apprehended
[1:10:09] of christ jesus
[1:10:12] he still
[1:10:15] pursuing
[1:10:18] he's still
[1:10:22] taking in
[1:10:23] he's still eating he's still drinking
[1:10:26] see he's not saying i want this and
[1:10:29] and you know i haven't found any way to
[1:10:31] get it
[1:10:32] but he's saying i'm
[1:10:34] he's going forward in faith
[1:10:37] he's going to try to apprehend this for
[1:10:39] which he's apprehended by
[1:10:41] christ jesus
[1:10:43] he says brethren i count not myself to
[1:10:46] have apprehended
[1:10:47] but this one thing i do
[1:10:49] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:10:51] and reaching forth
[1:10:53] unto those things which are before
[1:10:56] i press towards the mark for the prize
[1:10:58] of the high calling of god
[1:11:00] in christ jesus
[1:11:06] i don't want to be so satisfied in my
[1:11:08] current situation that i'm not
[1:11:10] pressing
[1:11:12] towards the mark
[1:11:17] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[1:11:19] be thus minded
[1:11:21] everyone else
[1:11:22] this is how we're to be minded
[1:11:24] and if your if in anything you be
[1:11:27] otherwise minded
[1:11:28] god shall reveal even this unto you
[1:11:31] nevertheless we're unto we have already
[1:11:33] attained let us walk by the same rule
[1:11:35] let us mind the same thing
[1:11:43] are we still
[1:11:45] drinking from that fountain because this
[1:11:47] this is water from that fountain
[1:11:50] this is not just the words of paul this
[1:11:52] is the words that the holy ghost
[1:11:54] spoke through paul
[1:11:57] and so if we take that out and we say
[1:11:58] yeah well
[1:12:00] i don't really see that right now so i'm
[1:12:01] just not gonna
[1:12:03] not gonna address that
[1:12:06] then you've changed the gospel
[1:12:09] you've no longer got
[1:12:11] jesus christ the living word
[1:12:14] but you've got an idol that's
[1:12:17] kind of close but it's missing part
[1:12:22] see it's not that the water is not there
[1:12:23] it's that
[1:12:24] people voluntarily will leave
[1:12:27] the water and they'll go to something
[1:12:28] that's close but a little bit
[1:12:31] more appetizing
[1:12:33] and jeremiah says for my people have
[1:12:35] committed two evils
[1:12:38] they have forsaken me the fountain of
[1:12:40] living waters
[1:12:41] and hewed them out cisterns broken
[1:12:43] cisterns that can hold no water
[1:12:47] see it doesn't say that the fountain
[1:12:48] ever stopped
[1:12:50] that promise of god
[1:12:52] is that the fountain would be there
[1:12:56] but have we left it
[1:12:58] have we turned aside is there anywhere
[1:13:00] in our lives and i'm not talking about
[1:13:02] you know as a as a church or a body or
[1:13:05] as a family i'm talking about
[1:13:07] individuals have i in my heart
[1:13:10] anywhere have i
[1:13:12] set up some image of god
[1:13:15] to worship and stuff
[1:13:18] every word
[1:13:21] have i have i just kind of looked around
[1:13:24] and tried to figure out based on what
[1:13:26] everyone else is doing what a christian
[1:13:28] ought to be
[1:13:30] or am i minded like paul
[1:13:32] who's just pressing
[1:13:35] every day
[1:13:43] but i believe we're meant to be walking
[1:13:46] in the spirit
[1:13:48] i believe that
[1:13:50] this
[1:13:56] if we could go
[1:13:57] go to galatians chapter 5
[1:14:00] and verse 18. i believe the spirit's not
[1:14:02] just
[1:14:04] something that's in our soul but it's
[1:14:06] something that that we walk in something
[1:14:08] that
[1:14:09] that we're called to
[1:14:11] to take in our our everyday life
[1:14:15] it says in galatians 5
[1:14:20] and 13.
[1:14:24] see there's always the two sides we
[1:14:26] always want to keep balanced
[1:14:29] and so the one side will just look
[1:14:31] only at you know
[1:14:33] works the other side will look at grace
[1:14:36] but the truth is
[1:14:39] if you just leave that channel open you
[1:14:40] just stay drinking
[1:14:43] it'll push out
[1:14:44] goodness
[1:14:46] that water
[1:14:47] is life and that seed will bring forth
[1:14:50] of its kind
[1:14:52] that word won't return void it'll
[1:14:54] accomplish that which it's supposed to
[1:14:55] do
[1:14:56] but look what it'll do if we'll just
[1:14:58] take it it says for brethren ye have
[1:15:01] been called unto liberty
[1:15:03] we are free
[1:15:05] we're not doing this to try to paul is
[1:15:07] not chasing us to try to save his soul
[1:15:09] but his soul is saved
[1:15:13] but still there's something in paul that
[1:15:15] he's just got to have a little bit more
[1:15:19] he's just got to get a little closer
[1:15:23] he says brethren we've been called unto
[1:15:24] liberty
[1:15:25] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[1:15:28] the flesh
[1:15:30] but by love serve one another
[1:15:33] see if we say we
[1:15:35] know god and love god or we hate our
[1:15:37] brother
[1:15:39] something's wrong
[1:15:41] but this liberty that we're called into
[1:15:43] ought to make us
[1:15:44] love one another
[1:15:46] to the point that we serve one another
[1:15:48] but by love serve one another
[1:15:51] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[1:15:53] even in this
[1:15:54] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:15:58] that's what we're getting restored back
[1:16:00] to you that's pentecost
[1:16:03] but if you bite and devour one another
[1:16:05] take heed that you be not consumed one
[1:16:07] another
[1:16:09] this i say then walk in the spirit
[1:16:13] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:16:15] the flesh
[1:16:20] see where's our desire
[1:16:23] because in myself
[1:16:25] i see the lust of the flesh popping up
[1:16:27] here and there
[1:16:30] this catches my eye and this catches my
[1:16:32] eye things that are
[1:16:33] just worldly
[1:16:37] but here in galatians it says we can
[1:16:39] walk in the spirit and we won't fulfill
[1:16:42] that lust
[1:16:44] i want that
[1:16:48] you know this this is not
[1:16:50] i don't believe that's
[1:16:52] a question of salvation
[1:16:54] i don't believe that
[1:16:56] you know we're saved by grace through
[1:16:57] faith
[1:17:00] but there is a way that a believer can
[1:17:02] walk in the spirit so that we don't
[1:17:04] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:17:07] and i have a desire for that and i know
[1:17:09] that if i would just start to thirst for
[1:17:11] that
[1:17:13] lord would meet that thirst
[1:17:16] because he said that i wouldn't thirst
[1:17:20] so amen
[1:17:22] that's for me
[1:17:23] walk in the spirit you should not
[1:17:24] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:17:26] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:17:28] the spirit against the flesh
[1:17:30] and these are contrary
[1:17:33] one to the other so you cannot do the
[1:17:35] things that you would
[1:17:36] it's still a battle
[1:17:40] still fighting
[1:17:42] but if you be led of the spirit you're
[1:17:44] not under the law
[1:17:46] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[1:17:49] well a lot of times we just skip over
[1:17:51] that part and we just kind of say we'll
[1:17:52] walk in the spirit and we'll skip
[1:17:54] straight down to the fruit of the spirit
[1:17:57] but no there are works of the flesh that
[1:17:59] we've got to keep an eye out for
[1:18:01] we've got to watch for these things
[1:18:04] because they'll always try to
[1:18:07] poke back in
[1:18:10] works of the flesh are manifest which
[1:18:11] are these adultery
[1:18:13] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[1:18:17] idolatry
[1:18:18] that's a big one right say well you know
[1:18:21] adultery fornication uncleanness
[1:18:23] lasciviousness
[1:18:24] didn't do any of those what about
[1:18:25] idolatry
[1:18:27] what idols have we let
[1:18:29] creep in where has our love
[1:18:32] grown cold there and even those those
[1:18:35] first four where have
[1:18:38] you know
[1:18:39] in the way that you're you're looking or
[1:18:41] presenting yourself you know these are
[1:18:43] these are matters of the heart that
[1:18:44] we're looking at
[1:18:46] it's not just
[1:18:48] um
[1:18:49] not just the act but it's what's in our
[1:18:51] heart
[1:18:52] is there any
[1:18:54] anything in us that's not totally just
[1:18:56] true and pure and lovely
[1:19:01] if we'll walk in the spirit we won't
[1:19:03] fulfill those lusts of the flesh
[1:19:07] idolatry witchcraft hatred
[1:19:10] variants emulations wrath strife
[1:19:13] seditions heresies
[1:19:16] envyings
[1:19:18] another bad one
[1:19:20] murderers
[1:19:21] drunkenness revelings and such like
[1:19:25] of the which i tell you before as i've
[1:19:27] told you in times past
[1:19:29] that they which do such things shall not
[1:19:31] inherit the kingdom of god
[1:19:35] she said well you said those things
[1:19:36] aren't a matter of
[1:19:38] of salvation
[1:19:39] well see
[1:19:41] when you've been saved
[1:19:43] there is something that draws you in
[1:19:46] to walk in the spirit
[1:19:48] so it's not you're saved directly on
[1:19:50] you know whether you can avoid these
[1:19:52] things
[1:19:53] there's no law if you're in the spirit
[1:19:54] but if you're not in the spirit you are
[1:19:56] going to fall into these things
[1:19:58] no way about it your flesh is born to
[1:20:01] sin
[1:20:03] it's good at it
[1:20:05] and this is a perfect
[1:20:07] age and place to sin in i mean this is
[1:20:10] satan's eden this is
[1:20:12] this is the time
[1:20:15] unless we're abiding in him
[1:20:18] we can do nothing
[1:20:23] but are we desirous of that
[1:20:26] are we pressing into that or have we
[1:20:29] or if we just
[1:20:30] lost all hunger and thirst for
[1:20:32] righteousness
[1:20:38] it says but the fruit of the spirit is
[1:20:40] love
[1:20:41] joy peace
[1:20:44] long-suffering
[1:20:45] gentleness goodness
[1:20:48] faith meekness temperance
[1:20:50] against such there's no law
[1:20:55] i'm thirsty for that
[1:20:59] and that's easy to say
[1:21:01] but if i'll just start
[1:21:04] i believe
[1:21:05] the lord
[1:21:06] desires to bear that fruit on me more
[1:21:09] than i desire it myself
[1:21:11] so if i can get to the point where it's
[1:21:13] not i desire it here
[1:21:15] but if i can just get to the point where
[1:21:17] i just say amen
[1:21:19] and i don't look at anything else i just
[1:21:21] look at the word and i don't look at my
[1:21:23] own shortcomings and my own failures and
[1:21:26] anything contrary to the word but i'll
[1:21:28] just say
[1:21:30] this is the fruit of the spirit
[1:21:32] i have a promise that there'd be a
[1:21:35] fountain of the spirit there there'd be
[1:21:37] all this water so how can there not be
[1:21:39] all this green
[1:21:42] and if i just say yes lord i believe it
[1:21:45] be it unto me according to your word
[1:21:48] then all of a sudden these lusts of the
[1:21:50] flesh
[1:21:52] they just start falling away
[1:21:56] these fruits of the spirit start coming
[1:21:58] up see it's not
[1:22:01] not what we do it's just can we
[1:22:04] dig those things out of the way those
[1:22:05] ideas those ideas like being a christian
[1:22:08] is just coming to church and doing what
[1:22:10] we're doing and and what we're doing is
[1:22:13] great and enough i don't believe that
[1:22:15] i believe there's so much more that the
[1:22:17] lord wants to do with us i believe just
[1:22:19] like the brandon said that every
[1:22:22] gift
[1:22:23] operating in every local body
[1:22:25] i believe
[1:22:27] there's more
[1:22:31] so let's throw out these ideas that just
[1:22:35] god to only operate in the box that we'd
[1:22:38] expect him to operate in
[1:22:41] maybe he wants to do something with us
[1:22:43] that none of us have ever
[1:22:45] considered
[1:22:47] i don't know
[1:22:49] but i want to want his will more than my
[1:22:52] own
[1:22:56] thy kingdom come thy will be done on
[1:22:58] earth as in heaven
[1:23:00] i want that to be from my heart not just
[1:23:03] for my lips i want that to be so part of
[1:23:06] me
[1:23:09] but if i'll desire that
[1:23:12] he's a good god he he fills the hungry
[1:23:15] soul
[1:23:19] let's see where were we
[1:23:21] and they that are
[1:23:22] meekness temperance against such there's
[1:23:24] no law
[1:23:25] verse 24 and they that are christ have
[1:23:28] crucified the flesh
[1:23:30] with all the affections and lusts i'm
[1:23:33] crucified with christ
[1:23:35] that's part of it too
[1:23:37] we want that part too
[1:23:40] not i that live but christ that is
[1:23:42] within me
[1:23:44] crucified the flesh with all
[1:23:46] affections and lusts if we live in the
[1:23:48] spirit let us also walk in the spirit
[1:23:51] let us not be desirous of vain glory
[1:23:53] provoking one another envying one
[1:23:55] another
[1:23:58] this is life
[1:24:01] this is bread this is daily bread
[1:24:05] let's just keep drinking
[1:24:08] just keep taking every day
[1:24:10] everything that he has for us
[1:24:13] if
[1:24:15] this is martha if you come back up
[1:24:17] and we'll end with some songs
[1:24:24] i'm thinking about that
[1:24:27] that key
[1:24:28] that one thing
[1:24:32] the most important thing
[1:24:34] let's put up john
[1:24:36] 17 3.
[1:24:41] jesus speaking
[1:24:45] says and this is life eternal
[1:24:48] that they might know thee the only true
[1:24:51] god
[1:24:52] and jesus christ whom thou has sent
[1:24:56] just like paul i want to really know him
[1:25:02] i want to know him more today than i did
[1:25:04] yesterday
[1:25:05] i want to know more the next day
[1:25:10] that's life eternal is to know him i
[1:25:12] don't want to get there
[1:25:14] and him say i never knew you
[1:25:17] depart from me
[1:25:18] to miss that the most important thing
[1:25:28] but we have that promise
[1:25:34] let's put that up again john 4 13 and 14
[1:25:37] and we'll just finish with that
[1:25:41] we'll and then we'll
[1:25:42] if you could play in b flat there's a
[1:25:44] fountain filled with blood
[1:25:48] jesus answered and said unto her
[1:25:49] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:25:52] thirst again but whosoever drinketh that
[1:25:55] the water that i shall give him shall
[1:25:57] never thirst
[1:25:59] but the water that i shall give him
[1:26:01] shall be in him
[1:26:03] a well of water springing up onto
[1:26:05] everlasting life springing up to the
[1:26:08] knowledge of him
[1:26:11] because that is
[1:26:13] what we just read
[1:26:15] you know
[1:26:16] in in matthew and john this is life
[1:26:19] eternal that we that they may know thee
[1:26:22] the only true god and jesus christ now
[1:26:25] said
[1:26:25] so if we'll just stay with us
[1:26:27] if we just keep the channels clear
[1:26:31] god is moving
[1:26:34] i believe he's drawing us
[1:26:39] so
[1:26:41] i don't mean to be tricky i don't mean
[1:26:42] to say well are we supposed to be
[1:26:44] thirsty are we supposed to not
[1:26:47] just be a christian
[1:26:49] just
[1:26:50] let your heart
[1:26:51] be so in love with him
[1:26:55] but expect
[1:26:57] what this book says
[1:27:00] don't expect whatever version
[1:27:03] whatever half version you can find
[1:27:05] anywhere but expect this whole thing
[1:27:07] every part of it
[1:27:10] and he'll bring our righteousness forth
[1:27:12] like the light
[1:27:15] promises
[1:27:16] we've got great and exceeding wonderful
[1:27:18] promises
[1:27:19] let's just hold on to them let's pray

[1:34:23] [Music]
[1:34:26] and i know his
[1:34:28] spirit's moving
[1:34:39] he
[1:34:40] speaks to me
[1:34:45] and
[1:34:46] i
[1:34:47] agree
[1:34:52] lord please come and take
[1:34:57] control
[1:35:05] at night
[1:35:07] i lay
[1:35:08] in bed
[1:35:10] and i
[1:35:11] begin
[1:35:13] to cry
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:18] and my
[1:35:20] mind just fails to know
[1:35:25] exactly why
[1:35:31] i can't explain
[1:35:34] with tongue or pen
[1:35:37] the spirit's
[1:35:39] crawling steep within
[1:35:43] it must be
[1:35:45] god here in my soul
[1:35:50] i feel
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:09] and i know his
[1:36:11] spirit's
[1:36:12] moving me
[1:36:15] to give
[1:36:16] my own
[1:36:21] he
[1:36:22] speaks to me
[1:36:27] and i
[1:36:29] agree
[1:36:34] lord please come
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:45] i just want to say something before
[1:36:48] before everyone leaves
[1:36:50] what i said there about you know being
[1:36:52] seven years and making sure we've sought
[1:36:54] the lord i don't mean to shake your
[1:36:56] confidence at all i do believe the lord
[1:36:58] has
[1:36:59] led us this way and i believe we've been
[1:37:01] the way that we've been for a reason and
[1:37:04] you know i don't understand all of it
[1:37:05] but i have confidence that it's been for
[1:37:07] our good
[1:37:08] uh for i know that he works all things
[1:37:11] together for the good of them that love
[1:37:12] god and are they called according to his
[1:37:14] purpose
[1:37:15] so i don't mean to criticize or say
[1:37:17] anything like that but what i do mean to
[1:37:19] say is
[1:37:20] let's make sure as we go forward that we
[1:37:22] don't just go
[1:37:24] you know any any
[1:37:27] any way without really
[1:37:29] seeking him first seeking his will first
[1:37:32] inquiring of the lord i believe
[1:37:34] you know whatever the last seven years
[1:37:36] have been have been that way for a
[1:37:37] reason and let's just make sure that
[1:37:40] here where we're at that we just really
[1:37:42] press into the lord and really look at
[1:37:44] ourselves and not just say okay what are
[1:37:46] the problems with everyone else but look
[1:37:48] and say oh lord what's the problem with
[1:37:50] me where am i causing this church to
[1:37:52] fail brother branham said
[1:37:54] one
[1:37:55] one person's sins in a congregation can
[1:37:57] cause the whole church to bitterly fail
[1:38:00] and that doesn't make you look around
[1:38:01] and say well you you says lord where
[1:38:04] where are my sins hindering your
[1:38:06] movement where is my unbelief hurting my
[1:38:09] brothers and my sisters oh lord let me
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:14] be healed
[1:38:15] that i wouldn't be in your way
[1:38:18] so i believe if we'll just go with that
[1:38:19] attitude that desire and just say oh god
[1:38:23] you know i was thinking
[1:38:25] and maybe some of us we are just living
[1:38:28] in that fountain we are i pray it is
[1:38:30] that some of us are just really
[1:38:33] just
[1:38:34] every day more and more i believe
[1:38:37] i believe it is that way
[1:38:39] but there was also there were three men
[1:38:42] that they thought so much of their
[1:38:43] brother the king
[1:38:45] that he was thirsty
[1:38:47] and they went and fought through an army
[1:38:48] of philistines just to bring him a drink
[1:38:52] i think we ought to have that
[1:38:54] that respect towards one another
[1:38:58] the word says you're kings and priests
[1:38:59] we don't say well i'm a king and a
[1:39:01] priest you say okay these my brothers
[1:39:02] and sisters these are kings and priests
[1:39:04] and if one of these kings one of these
[1:39:06] queens is thirsty
[1:39:07] i'll fight through an army for you
[1:39:10] i'll get sent out of my life for you
[1:39:12] that god can move
[1:39:15] and heal us
[1:39:17] i believe
[1:39:18] for us to get where we want to be where
[1:39:20] the lord wants us to be we cannot get
[1:39:22] there without a love like that
[1:39:24] without a love that'll say i'm gonna
[1:39:26] fight through an army of philistines
[1:39:27] because somebody there needs a drink
[1:39:32] but that's part of the promise
[1:39:35] that we could love like he loved we
[1:39:36] could love to lay down our lives for one
[1:39:39] another
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:41] he's so good
[1:39:46] i went to hear
[1:39:48] the word
[1:39:50] and with each line and frames
[1:39:59] he was
[1:40:01] calling me
[1:40:03] to give a higher
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:11] oh there's a
[1:40:13] deep call to the deep
[1:40:18] like a great magnet
[1:40:22] me
[1:40:24] i know for sure you know
[1:40:27] i'll reach the goal
[1:40:30] for i feel the poll he that started a
[1:40:33] good work we'll finish
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:49] and i know his
[1:40:51] spirit's
[1:40:53] moving me
[1:40:55] to give
