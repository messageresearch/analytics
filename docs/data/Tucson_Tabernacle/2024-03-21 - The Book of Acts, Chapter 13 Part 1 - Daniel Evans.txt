and father I know that this is a different day but Lord you are the same God there are attributes Lord that you have that have been from the beginning and there until now Lord we pray that that those attributes father would be manifested within us within our church and Lord that you would give us wisdom to understand this word and father may your Holy Spirit abide in our hearts and in our lives in Jesus name may God bless you all you can be seated I am appreciated communion service on Saturday or on Sunday it was um wow it's such a blessing I love seeing everybody everyone come up and and really really blesses me to see families up here and see all the families from the moms and the dads all the way to the young ones taking communion um it's what they did in the book of Acts and we are following along in those same principles and and I pray that the Lord will pour out his blessings just like he did in that book we um for the Lyle sister Heather brother Ed brother Jeremy sister Angela and I went over to Sister Green's house for the Perry Green's wife and took communion with her on Sunday after service she uh from what I heard she's getting pretty low but from what I saw she seemed like she was doing pretty good she still had her smile on her face and and I thought that she enjoyed it and I know we all certainly enjoyed being with her it was a great blessing we um we take communion we don't take communion by ourselves that was one of the questions that I used to get over and over and over is can I take communion by myself and my answer was always well is there another church can you not get to a church in the end and the response was always um well yeah but I don't believe like them or they don't believe like us and always putting us in there like I'm involved in that us and uh no brother or sister you take communion with other Saints other Christians it's it's an ordinance of God and no communion is not to be taken by yourself it's not that misses the whole purpose of it we have a Minister's meeting this Saturday and I got to tell you I really appreciate the efforts that uh brother Caleb Duran brother Steve Robson and we're going to be at brother Aaron McGarry's Church up in Phoenix I really so so appreciate that reaching out the right hand of Fellowship and inviting Unity among among the the ministers and I pray that that Unity brother and I pray that it spreads to the congregations I am I think that we have gone just we've gone too far and uh I have to say but there and I wasn't real fond of your testimony that you just gave about that was it you that met that sister you know and I'm sure brother Aaron was kind and he paraphrased it but um to have an attitude like that that it's my way and we're the right ones and if you don't believe it like me then then you're somehow off or you're you're somehow less than we are or or you're somehow not in our little Club of Believers here Brendan that is a brothers and sisters that is a false Doctrine you can trace that Doctrine all the way back as I preached on Sunday you can trace that Doctrine all the way back to murmuring in the wilderness and how Paul said these are our examples is those people and all the mistakes that they made in the wilderness we can take those examples and we can apply them to ourselves here and that is one of the examples one of the mistakes that they made is they fought and they murmured against Moses they murmured against Aaron they murmured against each other they complained and it frustrated God to no end to the point where they they fell into sin and God said I'm just going to wipe the whole thing clean and you see the spirit of Christ in Moses say no Lord no no have mercy and I see it I see it today and brother Aaron when you were when you were saying that let's uh I didn't it made me think of this scripture First Corinthians chapter 1. listen to this chapter 1 verse 12 the Apostle Paul who I'm going to be talking about tonight he says this he says now this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul and I am of Apollos and I have cephas and I have Christ then Paul asked this question is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul he's talking to the ones that were saying oh we're Paul and he's rebuking them and then he says it again later on in his letter I believe it's in chapter three yeah right here chapter 3 verse verse 4 he says this while one saith I am a Paul not a verse let's start with verse three chapter three verse 3. for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men for a while one saith I am of Paul and another I am of Apollos are you not carnal the same thing as as as you experienced it's the same thing now and I am sick of it I just it makes it makes me sick it just even dealing with it this week it just gets it makes my skin crawl saying can you not read the scriptures and if you don't believe the scriptures can you not listen to brother Branham you claim oh we believe brother Branham he did not teach that how hard is it to just believe it you say you believe every word you say it's infallible then do what it says verse number 22 even he whether Paul 3 22 whether Paul or Apollos or cephas or the world or life or death are things present or things to come all are yours and your Christ and Christ is God's oh amen you know I I look at that let me I'll level with you okay I always love it with you oh yeah everybody sometimes my loved ones say well you say too much that's why I am at this church is because this church is is a place that I came and I brother Aaron I didn't feel that spirit I didn't feel that we're better than you and let me tell you it was it was attractive to me it was something that there was an attraction brother Brown preached that message what is the attraction on the mountain it was God on the mountain and it was something to me I thought those people are not like that and it I mean I'm here it brought me here and I just and I just loved it I didn't feel that spirit and I pray it never it is never here I always want to reach out that that right hand of Fellowship and even uh brother Lyle at you and and brother Arnie and me going up there and representing this Congregation of believers representing all of us and saying no brothers we love you and we're not gonna boycott we're not going to stay away we are going to come we're going to make an effort to drive all the way up there just so we can shake your hand just so we can be with you and that's the spirit we need in the churches and I believe that is what the Apostle taught here and and we are going to see as we move into this book of Acts now we are going to see that infighting and those problems start to arise among the people and we'll see maybe tie them in in the future tie them in with other books other um Epistles that the apostles wrote and maybe say okay here in the book of Acts this is happening well here's what's written in this epistle and tie them in I'll do that if the Lord's willing a little bit tonight um but the enemy wants to divide us and he knows that if we're together in the bonds of love that he is broken and he has lost the battle if we can just stay that way love one another don't put each other down pick each other up that's how we should be as a church always welcoming people in and and I was as I was trying to say on Sunday that if you see a visitor in our midst there should be a line waiting to shake that person's hand I don't care what they look like and I'll tell you what I believe that we have a church that has that attitude sometimes you just have to as Elijah as the Bible says about Elijah he had to gird up his loins and and and just just do it to really just make an effort if you are shy it's okay overcome the shyness and go and greet people and love them and uh also you can get into their business a little bit say brother sister is there anything I can do for you ask them try to try to get a feeling about how they are and and then you might as I said on Sunday you might find that they need someone my son's been witnessing to uh to another young man he's older than Daniel he's got a house like 30 something he's got a family where his father-in-law's sick and he's just really really struggling with it and Daniel's been witnessing to him and encouraging him and now he can't wait to see Daniel because he knows that if he sees that young man he is going to get lifted up and that he seeks them out and then there's there's other ones that are doing the same with it's at a gym or at a work or wherever it is they when you walk into the room they should smile and they said oh they should say oh I just I love it when sister Shirley comes in sister Shirley I saw you here you were the first one here I peeked out the door and saw you there praying and I it just lifted me up and I was a little bit down and I see sister Shirley there praise the Lord sister Shirley loves the Lord she loves me she loves this congregation I know that that sister prays for me brother Aaron I know she does and it just it makes me feel good just to see you I it and I just all of you everybody here I know every single one of you and we should we should just not take each other for granted I better get I better get to my subject did you just say yes do you hear sister Shirley I forgive you I'm gonna practice what I preach acts Acts chapter 13. it's a tough crowd Acts chapter 12 it ends it ends with this it said but the word of God grew and multiplied and Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem so they came from Jerusalem back to Antioch when they had fulfilled their Ministry and took with them John whose surname was Mark Chapter 13 Verse 1. now there were in the church that was that Antioch certain prophets and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and Maine which had been brought up with Herod the tetrack now once again I want to spend just a few minutes on who these these men are in this first verse it's uh this man Barnabas we've we remember him he's a popular character in the book of Acts to this point acts 11 24 says he is a good man and full of the Holy Ghost and the faith he's the one who donated he sold land in Cyprus which we're going to hear about right now he sold land in Cyprus and he gave the full proceeds of that property to the disciples he also stood up for Saul of Tarsus when the Christians they couldn't believe he was converted so this man Barnabas had a good reputation he was it was a very very good man then the next one is Simeon called Niger that word Niger it means black so we don't know where this man is from but we can assume that he's an African and there are some Scholars I think as I was brother Lyle you probably read this too but as I was studying this and I was reading the different takes on who these people were there are some Scholars that think that this Simeon is actually Simon the siren who carried Jesus's cross whether he is or he isn't I don't know but I pray that one day I'll be able to shake his hand and ask him then the next one is Lucius of Cyrene and like these other brothers he was one of the founders of the church here at AF of Antioch and he was probably another African acts 11 verse 19. referring back to this Lucius it says this acts 11 19 it says now they they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as fenishi and Cyprus and Antioch preaching the word to none other but the Jews only and some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene which when they were come to Antioch spake unto the grecians preaching the Lord Jesus so this is this man Lucius this is almost surely this one that was spoken of in Acts 11 being a siren and he was probably among those Jews who were speaking to these Greek these greek-speaking Jews back in Acts 11. and then there's this man named Maine the the the last one there and the verse the the verse says that he was brought up with Herod the tetrarch now remember from remembering brother Lyle's sermon last week that Herod the tetrarch and Herod Antipas are the same person um and The Gospel According to Lyle um and I did a lot of research too places the birth of Herod the tetraarch about 20 BC so if you look in your Scofield bible in Acts 13 you'll see at the top that there is a date and that's 45 A.D now these aren't exact dates these are just the best guests but they're they're they're probably really close so if you look if he was born according to brother Lyle and and also the research that I I did to back you up 20 years plus 45 years this man an was about 65 years old and possibly older than that so we see that he's he's an older fellow I mean he's not as old as brother Lyle but he he's he's he's older fellow you can laugh [Laughter] brother loud picks on me too um but you could see that that even some of the more aged people are preaching the gospel now this man meaning it's it's really neat because it says that he grew up with this Herod Antipas Herod Antipas was not a great guy if I remember right if I have my history right he married his his brother's wife and then his brother's wife he had a thing for his brother's wife's daughter and she danced for him and then he had John the Baptist head cut off and uh killing John the Baptist and coming in against the Christians all they did he was really a creepy guy just not not the best person that around but this man an grew up with him and look at the Divergent ways of their lives you see Antipas over here just following sin in his life and then you see this man over here serving God giving his heart accepting Jesus Christ two very very different people here and uh I also want to point out the diversity of this group of four that it looks like they were instrumental in founding this this church at Antioch there you have in Maine and you have a Jew probably from Jerusalem and Paul you have a Jew that was actually from outside of Israel gree is speaking Greek growing up among the Romans then you have this these two siren probably black Brothers all of them working together to preach the gospel that's the book of Acts just absolutely no separation at all working together for the furtherance of the Gospel now this chapter it starts chapter 13 it starts in Antioch and it ends in Antioch but they're two different places they have the same name starts in Antioch which is the Antioch in Syria and then it ends up at the end of the chapter which we won't get to today but we'll we'll get there eventually it ends up in southern turkey so two different cities with the same name but um they uh two very very different places verse number two as they minister to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where unto I have called them and now again look at the dedication of the church as they ministered to the Lord how can you minister to the Lord that's a good question huh how can you Minister well the word minister is not necessarily preaching some translations say serving others say worshiping so they were praising they were fasting they were serving they were worshiping and then the Holy Spirit spoke how did the Holy Spirit speak it always speaks through a human being's voice almost always so they were they were consecrating their lives of the Lord they were praying they were fasting they were right with the Lord they were they were in unity and then whether somebody may have given a prophecy someone may have spoken in tongues I don't know how exactly it came but the Holy Spirit here said and it it most likely came through a human being just like it always always does separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where until I have called them the bottom line here is God was speaking through the people just as he does as always does and he does now Barnabas is a Jew from Cyprus so it makes sense that he and Saul are headed there for this missionary trip and and when they had fasted and prayed they laid their hands on them and they sent them away now the theme of the book of Acts is the acts of the Holy Spirit working in these Apostles and I think brother Lyle and I mention it whenever we're teaching on this we probably mention it every sermon and it's good dimension that these are human beings these are very flawed human beings these are human beings that have opinions these are human beings that make mistakes and you're going to see some of these mistakes they make mistakes but yet they are filled with the Holy Spirit and they are working exactly in line with what God wants them to do and I think it's it's really beautiful to me to see that that God is sending these people out to preach the gospel and you think well why doesn't God just go to this I'm going to speak about this this governor here in a couple verses why doesn't he just go to him directly or why didn't God just go to Cornelius directly and introduce Christ why does does why doesn't God just do it send an angel and do it himself sometimes he sends an angel but that angel will introduce a believer and then that believer will bring the message and it's because the way that God does things is he sees he wants his people working together he wants them leaning on each other and helping each other and that's that's why it's but they're in that that story just bothers me so much because that's not love that's just getting someone to believe like you believe and we're going to see here how that it fails verse number four so they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost departed unto solution and from thence they sailed to Cyprus and when they were at Solomon's they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews and they had also John to their Minister now there are obviously a lot of Jews in this area of Cyprus because it says plural it says synagogues and I want you to note this man that was with them John it's also called John Mark and it says John was their Minister but that word minister in this sense it means helper or assistant someone that that basically does things for them that assists them and when they had gone through the aisle into paphos they found a certain sorcerer a false prophet a Jew whose name was bar Jesus do you know what bar Jesus means brother Lyle said it means son of Jesus remember Simon barjona talking about Peter Simon son of Jonah this man is bar Jesus now I don't think I don't see anywhere that Jesus was actually a common name back then so I don't think that this man had anything to do with Jesus Christ that was just the name that that he was given um and uh it's it's really strange too because sorcery was strictly forbidden in the Jewish religion and it was punishable I think by death I think about Saul uh King Saul and The Witch of Endor and that story and and how that that these Sorcerers Through the Bible and witches they it was it was death penalty you didn't practice this stuff but we see that this man barred Jesus was a Jew and a false prophet so he had mixed Judaism probably with local beliefs of idolatry and and Paul is going to encounter Through the Ages through the his missionary trips all kinds of idolatry and heathenism and and all these things are going to rise up and It also says that as I said it says that this man is a false prophet so he's someone that's Leading the People astray for his own game then let me let me uh read that one again and when they had gone through the aisle papers they found a certain Sorcerer of false prophet a Jew whose name was bar Jesus which was with the deputy of the country Serge's paulus a prudent man who had called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the word of God now sergius paulus was a governor or of the leader of Cyprus assumed somehow appointed by Rome and uh there was something special about this governor and that he was seeking the truth he wanted to know he had heard maybe about this Christianity and he wanted to know more but we see this false prophet this barred Jesus we see him sneak in and try to prevent this governor from hearing the gospel and that's a spirit that isn't just back then but it's a spirit that is so prevalent today we see that that so often that you'll you'll see some young people dating and one will be of this religion and one bill that religion there'll be one that has Zeal and then the one might have a family that that they've never gone to church or anything but they were born Baptist or Catholic or whatever and then they see their sons start to date this this Holiness Holiness girl and then all of a sudden they are Catholic and they're starting to go to mass and they're starting to go to church and they all of a sudden find religion when they see that that their son or their daughter might be dating someone that's not part of their religion it's hypocrisy and we see here that this bar Jesus he's doing the same thing he's saying wait wait wait don't don't listen to what these people say and he does everything he can to hinder it but elements the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith then Saul who is also called Paul filled with the Holy Ghost set his eyes on him now this is the first time Saul of Tarsus is called Paul and it's it's really it's really neat that the timing of it and it's probably not the first time that he was ever called this name Saul of Tarsus was of The Tribe of Benjamin which was also King Saul way back when remember the first king of Israel so the king the first king of Israel was named Saul so we can maybe guess that Saul of Tarsus being also of The Tribe of Benjamin may have been named after King Saul we don't know that but that's the first one we know with that name Saul my point in saying that is Saul is a Hebrew name so Paul is a Latin name or a Roman name so I assume that he grew up in in this Saul of Tarsus went to school with Hebrews he studied in Jerusalem he was a very Pious legalized legalistic man he's probably always went by his Hebrew name Saul but then he as he is moving into this work with the Gentiles God changes his heart as you know from earlier and also changed his name to his Latin or his Roman name Paul so he's probably given both names just after his birth but now we see him changing to a messenger to the Gentiles and then taking on that Gentile name of Paul an overview of how God prepares a man for the job you know we've heard so many times that God doesn't call the qualified he qualifies the called this man Paul was born for this work he you can see as as his as his life goes on and the experiences that happened to him he had Jewish Bloodlines all the way back to the Tribe of Benjamin and he was Roman by birth because his dad had purchased his purchased his own Freedom so the dad purchased his freedom and then Paul was born after the dad had purchased his freedom so Paul was free because his dad was a Roman citizen now so Paul being born to his dad even though they were Jews born to his dad who had purchased his Roman citizenship now Paul was born free it would be like an immigrant coming to the United States that if their parents come here and then that child is born here they're citizen so on this one it was Paul that Paul's dad had purchased his Roman citizenship with a great amount of money probably and then because he had done that when Paul was born he was born a Roman citizen which had to have made things a lot easier in his missionary Journeys that he's about to embark on and he's Greek culturally so he was born meaning he was he was one of these Greek speaking Jews probably born outside of Israel raised out outside of Israel in the city of Tarsus and he was raised in the Jewish faith in his home and eventually studying Judaism under under in Jerusalem under the most respected of all the teachers gamalia and then by a miracle so we see that he was he was by his bloodline he's Jew he was born Roman he was educated as a Jew and then we see by a supernatural experience he became a Christian so look at all of these things working up to to building this character in this ability of Paul to preach the gospel remember what I preached on Sunday is that I asked for strength and then God gave me trials I asked for love and then God gave me all these people to love I asked for this and and he gave me something that that didn't necessarily match up with what I thought it was going to be but it was exactly what I needed when I asked for it and that's here we have the Apostle Paul a man that has been prepared for this job and then he's also spent three years studying the scriptures and tracing Christ back from Genesis all the way to that day Let's uh let's go to the next verse verse number 10. go back to verse number nine then Saul who is also called Paul filled with the Holy Ghost set his eyes on him speaking to this sorcerer and said oath full of all subtlety and Mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord again the biggest problem with this bar Jesus was not that he was he was a hypocritical Jew or he was even a sorcerer but the biggest problem with bar Jesus was that he was trying to prevent someone from coming to Christ and we see it today all over the place we see the Seventh-day Adventist saying well you have to worship on Saturday that that should be the Sabbath or you're out we see the book of we see the Mormons saying you have to accept the Book of Mormon or you're out we see the Jehovah Witnesses saying that Christ can't be divine or deity because that makes more than one God and over and over and over and I'm sure all of us have dealt with it ourselves and now behold this is again Paul speaking and now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the Sun for a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand does that sound familiar exactly it sounds like exactly what happened to Paul Paul was he was fighting against the Lord the Lord struck him down somebody had to lead him now one thing I really appreciate about this let me read that verse again verse number 11. and now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the son for a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand he said brother Lyle for a season and I think even the Lord left it open for this man to come the same way that Paul did dy I don't know I hope he did God's the judge whether he did or he didn't I don't know but he said for a season so he probably received his sight later on we don't know we don't we don't know what happens to this this man but I do I do appreciate that that the door is open a little bit he didn't drop dead the door is open for repentance there then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord so even with this this opposition the Lord uses the opposition of this this evil person to show this Deputy the glory of God and I want to show right there do you see we've seen it from Acts chapter 2 all the way till now do you see how important Miracles are the signs of God these great things that happened this miracle right here that happened smiting this man blind is probably the reason that this Deputy saw that okay this is something there's something to this this isn't just someone's preaching a new doctrine there's actually power behind what he is saying and that should be us as we're as whoever's in the Pulpit we're preaching the gospel whoever's out witnessing whoever's just living a life there should be a power behind that testimony they should be a power behind that sermon there should be these signs that come from God they should be with us and we I believe that we should see more of them and I'm praying Lord I don't want to be a hypocrite I preach about I preach about miracles I preach about signs I preach about tongues I preach about prophecy I support those things now Lord I lay it at your feet and I say like Gideon does Lord if God be with us and where are all the Miracles I know that we have someone we don't want to Discount what God does for us but we also look in this book of Acts and these people were converted because they saw the supernatural signs of God happen I'll read that again then when the deputy then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord now when Paul and his company loose from Papas they came to perga and pamphilia and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem this is a big deal right here it doesn't sound like a big deal does it it is so much is going on in this book of Acts and I thank God that the author recorded these seemingly Little Things John John Mark is a cousin cousin of Barnabas and it seems like I think it's a cousin or nephew he's he's related to Barnabas somehow and it seems like he was a great help to the team so the team arrives to pamphilia and John Mark says I'm out of here I'm leaving why would he do that we don't I don't have an answer for it but he could have he could have got sick he could have um he could have wanted to go back home he could have had to go back to work he could have been a myriad of things or it could have been some sort of a contention between him and Paul maybe it doesn't seem like Barnabas and Paul but there was some sort of a contention that that happened right there and some sort of a problem that happens right there and then John Mark goes home now let's turn a couple Pages a couple uh pages to the right and go to um Acts chapter 15. verse 36. now this the First Missionary trips over great things were accomplished great things happened and then they're planning the second missionary trip all right so we jumped into the future a little ways acts 15 36 says this and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do and Barnabas determined to take with them John whose surname was Mark same guy the servant but Paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them in pamphilia and went not with them to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from another so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus and Paul chose Silas and departed being recommended by the Brethren unto the grace of God now that word departed I was I was looking at the different translations of it it's different than the first time it's used in Chapter 13 Departed this time it's used and it's basically it says the amplifier Amplified Bible says this the one who had quit and deserted them in pamphilia and not gone on with them to the work most other translations says deserted them so we see that there was some sort of an issue there and we know that from listening to tapes we know that that Barnabas isn't even mentioned really again after this so Paul goes his way and Barnabas I'm sure Barnabas was a man of God and and and doing doing the things of God but his time in the book of Acts is over now so let's go back to Chapter 13 Verse 14. and when they departed from perga they came to Antioch in pasidia and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down and after reading of the law and of the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying ye men and Brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people say on so here Barnabas and Paul so they're visiting ministers to the church they're visiting rabbis to the church and and so we we see we see this even today that that different Brothers will come to different churches and and they'll preach and we see it all the way back here in the book of Acts and we see that that Paul hear is about to give his first public sermon and we know that he's spoken a little bit here and there but this is the first recorded sermon that Paul gives and uh I might just get started in a little bit but let's uh if the musicians will come forward let's let's put it off brother Lyle um I'll pray about it and uh maybe I'll come back to it Sunday morning or maybe Sunday night can you just can you be on standby for chapter 14. okay thank you so so we see that Paul is now he's stepping forward and you see that now Paul is taking some leadership here and Barnabas is maybe stepping back into the background so Paul raises his hand and says listen listen to me he stands up beckons with his hand and says men of Israel and ye that fear God give audience the God of this people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt and with a high arm brought them out of it so if you'll notice in the book of Acts you see Peter preach then you see Stephen preach and now you're seeing Paul preach and brothers and sisters it's the same sermon they say very very similar things starts with a history of how that that God has done all these great things and brought them to this time and then it goes to about how that that those old times now they they were talking about this man Jesus and then it goes into a call for the people to believe and usually it's he hits them pretty hard and he says he says your families your ancestors are the ones that did this and we see that that Paul in uh in doing this he's holding strong to that same way of ministering and um [Music] I'll stop I'll stop there as far as this book of Acts but I do want to say in and we're all family and friends here that [Music] every sermon that's in the book of Acts every sermon that's in the New Testament that's past the gospels and and that that is is preached every single one points to one thing and it's the Christ and it's it's without exception they're preaching the same thing they're pointing people to Christ and that's how I believe that that's how our sermon should be we may start in Genesis we may start in Isaiah we may start in Revelation but wherever we we start from we should end up in Christ every sermon should you believe that God bless you I appreciate you coming out tonight I am I know sometimes Wednesday is is a hard time but this book of Acts is friends it's just wonderful it's it's a tremendous example of what can happen to normal people when they just believe do you believe let's stand foreign [Music] the Lord's willing I don't know if I'll uh I'm gonna pray about it the remainder of the week I might preach on Paul's sermon on Sunday morning I do have some things in my heart I'd like to talk about my son and uh and I we lost a somebody we knew in Jeffersonville we had that Ministry and uh with the boxing gym well it was basically built on four young men it was my son it was my two nephews and a professional heavyweight fighter well he died tragically a couple days ago and I don't know really don't know why I died in his sleep but um I'd like to talk a little bit about that this Sunday and I believe the Lord laid Something in My Heart about how that we shouldn't neglect to preach this gospel gospel none of us should Wherever You Are we shouldn't neglect to tell people about the Lord Jesus because you don't know that you may be talking to somebody that might be their last day on Earth friends God bless you all I pray that that some of the book of Acts chapter 13 would stay with you tonight think about these four men that went to that went to Antioch and and and started this work and then going and traveling and and how that John Mark he something happened there and there was there was a split in the division and and we see this this sorcerer this magician come in and he tries to keep the word away from from the leader there and um I think we can see it all today's world God bless you all over there foreign [Music] yes God still moves [Music] he does not seen nor does his life God still yes God still works oh God still moves yes God still moves [Music] nor does his life [Music] oh God soon [Music] Lord [Music] Bauer heads Lord we thank you because we know that you still move you're not just a god of yesterday or to OK like so many focus on a day you're a God of
