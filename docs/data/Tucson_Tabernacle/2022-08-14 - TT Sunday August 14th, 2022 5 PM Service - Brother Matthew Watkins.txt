for your kingdom may lord you speak words of life lord you know what's going to be spoken here tonight lord you've predestinated even before we ever even gathered or scheduled this service lord you already knew the end from the beginning lord and your word will accomplish that which you've intended for it too i pray god that you would have your way lord in every life we ask it now in jesus christ's name amen can you say amen amen judges chapter 13 if you have your bible amen god bless you judges chapter 13. would they mind turning on the lights on this left side would that be okay aaron i don't know where you're at um if that be or if that'd be okay i'd sure appreciate that a lot amen i'm a child of the light judges chapter 13. we just want to greet you again and say it's been a privilege to be here with you and just to be able to stand and minister and i trust that something was said today that tonight or this morning and tonight that'll be a blessing to you and something that you could take home and fight the enemy with because we've got a real enemy but we've also got a risen savior amen and he's the same yesterday today and forever how many believers do we have here of that tonight judges chapter 13 i want to take just a thought here tonight and i'm just going to title this put on your strength put on your strength we're going to read two scriptures the first one is going to be in judges then we'll turn to isaiah chapter 52 judges chapter 13. let's just skip down all the way down and we'll just begin reading at the at the sixth verse let's actually let's just start we'll just begin reading at verse 3 and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art bear and embarrass not but thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware i pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for lo thou shalt conceive and bear a son no razor shall come upon his head for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb notice i'm only reading this just for context we'll reference samson we're not going to preach on him tonight but i just want to key in on a few things we read here in verse 5. notice this he shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of god very terrible but i asked him not once he was neither told me his name and he said and she repeats everything that he says and let's just read it here but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of his death so that covers everything from the womb all the way unto his death isaiah 52 turn there with me quickly if you could and we'll have you be seated isaiah 52 and we're going to read something here i just want to take a context or a title from you're going to you're going to read awake and he repeats it awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck old captive daughter of zion for thus saith the lord you have sowed yourself for naught and you shall be redeemed without money for thus saith the lord god my people went down a four time into egypt to sojourn there in the assyrian oppress them without calls lord we give you thanks for the reading of your word we're already lord blessed just by reading it for truly lord it's more than just a book it's not like a newspaper lord it's not just a novel that we could pick up and be entertained by lord but it's a living book it's one that controls everything that happens in our daily life everything that happens from the cradle to the grave lord it also is controlling everything that happens in the world around us lord and we believe father we're believers of it tonight and lord we believe that it's relevant that it applies to our life our daily life and god i pray that you would come and make the word live lord make it real to your children lord for any sick that's amongst us lord or those that may be at home lord i pray that you would touch them in a special way lord for any of those that are bound or afflicted here god i pray that you'd set them free tonight made tonight lord be a night of freedom for your children lord i pray god as we've re read these words now god may you come and give the unction give the anointing lord and make may your word lord just have free reign in our hearts we give you liberty just now in the name of jesus christ and the church says amen you can be seated awake put on your strength o zion i want you to hold your place there in isaiah 52 and i just want to bring you right where i'm at here so that we know that it's a sunday night and we don't want to keep you too long but just want to minister what the lord put upon our heart knowing he just brought us in this direction i'm going to look at the life of jacob here and we read something about samson that's going to give context to jacob's life but i want to parallel this back to isaiah 52 when he's speaking to the captive daughter of zion and he's saying in this con condition that israel is in that she's like a captive daughter she's laying in the dirt she's groveling on the ground and god comes with a word to this child that's bound and she's afflicted and she's uh she's she's as the bible says that the philistines are coming in and there she's a mockery and the bible now remember this is not jezebel's daughter that's laying on the ground this is the daughter of zion this is the daughter of the lord and god comes with the word and he says awake put on your strength o zion in other words this isn't who you are israel this isn't who i made you to be this is not the real you as we spoke of this morning and he says pick yourself up put on your beautiful garment so apparently whatever they had on was tattered and torn and dusty and and god is speaking to them saying put on your beautiful garments and now what a pitiful sight that she's in the redeemed of the lord once stood in beauty and once stood in honor and glory and now she's on the ground and she's in it you could say it this way that she was in a r in a rut she was in a ditch she couldn't go forward she couldn't get up she was just laying there and groveling on the ground what a pitiful sight and the bible says she's clutching at the yoke that's upon her neck she's she's in bondage and and the bible says release yourself or set yourself free uh loose yourself from the bonds of your neck o captive daughter of zion and so then you notice here this condition that she comes into and and it's a it's a it's a horrible place you could say she's in a horrible condition but i want you to notice the the loving words of a kind heavenly father to a child who has enslaved themself now make no mistake god didn't put her here and not even the devil put her here but she put herself and many times you come under bondage and you come under affliction and it's at your own hands that's why the apostle paul says be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage wherewith christ has set you free you did run well what did hinder you oh foolish galatians notice all of these times where you come up and you're you maybe you could say that they were on a high and then they come down to a low and the bible says here that he says awake awake this is the words of a heavenly father awake and put on your strength put on your strength this isn't who you are you've got to recognize that you're a daughter of the king and you don't belong on the ground you don't belong bound didn't save you so that you could live in bondage i saved you so that you could be free free from sin free from yourself free from pride free from complex free from fear hello free from anything whatever you need freedom for whatever you need freedom from tonight god has freedom for you whoever the son sets free the bible says is free indeed in other words he's free of everything and he says here awake put on your strength put on your beautiful garments what a condition he says here put on your beautiful garment notice there's no rebuke there's no chastisement in his voice there's no condemnation there's no taking back of his love for his child there's no taking back of his mercy let me say this god never takes back his mercy people forsake their own mercy that's why that book of i think it's the book of isaiah says you have forsaken your own mercy but god never withdraws his promise oh i'm so glad for that here tonight he never withdraws his promise that means it's always available to you it's always just a prayer away his promise is always available to you he never withdraws his mercy he never withdraws his promise he never abandons his children never i don't care what the devil's lied to you and told you god's abandoned you he's never abandoned his children notice the lord this is this is how god responds and this is this is what the bible says here in isaiah it says when the afflicted daughter of zion she says the lord hath forsaken me this is isaiah 49 the lord hath forsaken me no notice how god responds to this in isaiah 49 verse 14 brother jordan you can put it on the screen this is the way that god replies to this statement god has forsaken me can a woman notice the bible the zion has said the lord has forsaken me my lord hath forgotten me verse 15. can a woman zion said yet verse 15 can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea yea they may forget yet i will not forget thee behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me notice this this word here and i know we've covered this here in in months past but i just want to revisit it here just for a moment for the sermon thy walls notice i've graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me that wall is the hebrew word shoma i may not be pronouncing that right but i just want to give you the definition for this word it literally means to be joined to a wall it's amazing how alone we feel in our personal battles and our personal struggles satan will if he can give you any feeling he'll make you feel that you're all by yourself and you're all alone and you're isolated all to yourself and nobody's going to come for you has he ever made you feel that way if you could ever pour it on like the prophet of god says when satan gets you down that's when he really throws on the punches and if he could ever get sell you a lie it'll be that god has forsaken you you're isolated you're abandoned you're all alone in your struggle god has left you because he's angry at you and he's left you to battle the enemy all by yourself and it's so incredible how a son of god a believer can get a deformed distorted thinking like this about god it's a vain imagination but god's word says the contrary i will not forget you let me go further i cannot forget you hallelujah i've graven you on the palms of my hands what a promise thy wolves the choma that's the word it literally means to be joined to a wall and that wall speaks of a prison wall captive wall of a captive i've joined myself to you in your captivity this is going to make sense here in a moment i've joined i've joined myself to you when i gave you a promise i want you to know i've not just verbally given you a promise but i've attached my life i've attached myself to you let me give you the new testament language for this same exact phrase i'm a high priest who can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities i'm a high priest who can be touched when you feel an infirmity i can fill it to when you feel despondent i can feel it too when you feel abandoned i can feel it too when you feel rejected i am a high priest who can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities hallelujah notice this man and i want you to turn to genesis 28 if you could you could you could if you have a bible i'd love for you to use them they have it here on the screen but i just believe we should be uh wearing our bibles out we should be replacing them every few years from worn pages amen genesis chapter 28 notice what god promises this man jacob now this is not a good man i want to get that clear he's not a good man esau's a much better man he's not a good man but if i could get away with saying this but he's god's man and many times god's man is not always at that moment a good man and jacob at this moment is not a good man he's a he's a the the bible uses the word in the prophet if god uses it he's a shyster he's a conniver he's a supplanter he's a deceiver he would even deceive his own father and he's a he's the kind of a man that when he's going to go before battle and he's when he's going to go from to it through a uh he's uh to a to an enemy a hostile enemy and he doesn't know he's going to cross over uh into this unknown territory he's the kind of man that says i'm not sure if this is an enemy if it's a foe or it's a friend so you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna send my wife and children ahead of me to see if they get killed i'll know whether it's a foe or a friend well you can decide if you think he's a good man or not i'd say he's not a good man he's jacob and that's the problem this isn't the real you he's jacob and that's the problem notice here in genesis chapter uh where did i tell you to turn genesis 28. let's just read this together just for a moment i want you to notice this promise that god gives to this man and it's incredible you can see this that he was such a disobedient servant he was such a disobedient one who was anointed with the promise but him and his own selfishness and his own pride took his entire family down to rock bottom and you could call it rock bottom took him to disgrace because of his pride everybody but long before this record of jacob's struggles and all of his mistakes long before that jacob has a supernatural experience he has a powerful supernatural vision that god gives him it's in genesis chapter 28 and let's just begin reading here let me find my place let's just begin reading here at verse 11. and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried their own night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it so what does god give jacob god gives jacob a very special look he gives them a very special peek he peers back the dimensional curtain in jacob's mind and jacob is going to peer into a a powerful picture and a powerful scene of a of a ladder a way of uh of of of communication between heaven and earth and jacob's dreaming all of this and he sees angels that are ascending and angels that are descending and angels that are ascending and angels that are descending listen friends that vision that jacob had if god could give you hit you'd get the same vision today if you laid your head at your pillow tonight and god opened your eyes you know what you would see you would see angels that are working constantly for your family for your children for your for your mind for your body for your health for your home for the believers the bible says those that fear the lord an angel uh uh encamps themselves angels and cabbed themselves around the family of god what are these elijah servant have trouble seeing oh he sees the armies on the hills and the prophet praise and says god open his eyes for they that are with us are more than they with them do you realize what what the bible's called jehovah calls him the the lord of hosts the lord of hosts i love the english translation for that it literally means the god of angel armies what a powerful name the god of angel armies this is what god is trying to get his family to understand that when you as the song says when you feel like you're surrounded i'm surrounded by you when i feel like i'm surrounded lord i'm surrounded by you jacob sees a ladder with angels going up and down and up and down what's god saying jacob i'm always working for your life even when it feels like you're not working you never stop working angels ascending and descending what a powerful vision notice here he says the the he he wakes up he sees this dream and verse 12 and the top of it reached to heaven and behaved behold the angels of god has sinned and sinning and behold the lord stood above it and said now notice the promise god gives to jacob the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land wherein thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed what a promise god makes to what we would call a very bad man but i want you to notice because i preached to you this morning on the real you i want you to notice that there was more to jacob than just the shyster that we see but there was a seed gene of god down inside of him that was the real jacob and god predestinated that seed and the apostle paul picks it up in the new testament and says jacob have i loved esau have i hated and paul says and god made that choice before before either were born or either had done right or wrong you see the power of the true revelation of election when you are part of god's family god places a seed down inside of you and the potential of that seed let me say it this way the confidence that god has in that he doesn't have confidence in you or your flesh but he has confidence in the seed that he placed down inside of you that if it gets in the right atmosphere it'll bring forth the potential he put inside of it and god says before either had done wrong before either had sinned before he that had done right or wrong god says i've made that choice and paul says that election might stand god makes this man a promise and he says here notice here in verse 15 and behold i am with thee what a powerful promise when god joins himself by covenant by a promise i am joined like like we just read the definition thy walls are continually before me i cannot forget thee by your graven unto that to my hands and to the palms of my hands i've joined myself to you behold jacob i am with thee and will keep thee in all the places all the turns all the u-turns all the left turns all the right turns i'll keep you in all the crossroads i'll keep you in all of the major times and all of the minor times i'll never leave you i'm making you a promise jacob and it's a powerful promise i'm with you and will keep you in all the places whether thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee do you know that this is the same promise that is transferred to the new testament believer when jesus said i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you you want to you ought to hit the devil in the face with that promise the next time he comes to you i've got a promise from my father he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me doesn't matter where i go he'll stay right by my side as paul says even when we're not faithful he remaineth faithful i love that until notice i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of and jacob woke out of his sleep and said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not verse 16. surely the lord is in this place verse 17 and he was afraid and said how dreadful that actually is not how you think it means awesome how how dreadful is this place there this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven joke of jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil what's he trying to do he's trying to memorialize something has happened something has taken place he's humanly he's trying to do anything he can just imagine you wake up out of this kind of a dream and and and then you have a promise i'll never leave you i'll uh until i've accomplished that until i've i've done that which i've spoken of jacob is is trying to do anything so he picks up the stones and he looks this is this is where my head was this is where i slept last night and he picks up the stones and he starts to place a memorial and then he takes some oil and he pours the oil over on top of it now you know a lot of people would look and say oh brother you're just getting emotional oh come on jacob you're just getting a little bit come on ain't you getting a little bit carried you know but later on you're going to find out when jacob did that god noticed what he did and god reminds him of what he did he said i'm the god of bethel when you anoint us the pillar when you made a monument when you made a memorial something took place something happened and jacob pours oil on the top of it verse 19 and he called the name of that place bethel he gives it a name anoints it he builds a he builds a monument you know when god does something for you you should mark it even if it's just in your mind you should mark it and put it in your pocket and every time the devil comes knocking and trying to lie to you you pull out and say no satan god met me and i'm positive of that i may not feel him right now but i know he's real and i know that you're a liar and you're a bluff and he calls the name of that place bethel jacob valdival verse 20 saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and rain it to put on so that i come again to my father's house in peace then shall the lord be my god and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be god's house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee this is a special experience jacob has special experiences god gives him this dream and you know what this is a powerful powerful vision that helps jacob no doubt for the rest of his life he could draw back from this dream you know i reminded so much of god's prophet when he's laying his head on his bed and he says my hands behind my head and just and they're sitting in that room and the butt and brother adam says and the voice spoke the voice angel of the lord spoke to me and said would you like to look just beyond the curtain and brother branham says oh it would help me so much and god opens back that dimension just as he did for jacob and god opens up the curtain of time and you know what let me just say this he went to a real place he's seen real people it wasn't a figment of his imagination it was appearing into another dimension and when he said it would help me so much let me echo that to you it helps me so much it helps you so much it helps you and your family today to know that just beyond this mortal realm that they call time is a place without pain without sorrow without sadness without pressure without stress oh are you going there church i'm so glad to live within a with a reality that it's really real brother madam says do whatever you got to do but don't miss that place lay aside everything jacob has this powerful dream and you know what happens 20 years go by like that man time just flashes by 20 long years of jacob's life following this powerful experience that god does for him and 20 long years 20 years of trial sorrow disobedience calamity that jacob brings upon himself god says go left jacob goes right god says stop jacob goes forward god says turn around jacob keeps going 20 long years of disobedience you know you can spend a long time in disobedience he spends 20 long years of trial and sorrow disobedience and sinfulness and loose laxadaisical living lukewarm living but you know what god was with jacob the whole time you know why because he was joined to jacob he never left him he stayed with him after leaving bethel jacob settles down and instead of being more spiritual instead of instead of rising and ascending jacob does the very opposite it becomes cold he becomes backslid he becomes very carnal in his nature god speaks to him again notice in genesis chapter 31 if you just turn two two chapters over genesis chapter 31 notice god appears to jacob again and he speaks to him and i want you to notice here in genesis chapter 31 and let's just begin reading it at verse 13. and i god here's what god says to jacob i am the god of bethel where thou anoint us the pillar and where thou vow to vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred it's almost just like what he says to that captive daughter of zion awake stand up get up stand up put on your strength put on your beautiful garments what are you doing down here jacob what are you doing for years he goes and years and years passes by and year passes by five years and then 10 years and you say surely god you surely after five years surely you gave up right sort of like samson's life god appears to manoah his wife you have a son and deliver the philistines he'll be a nazarite unto god from the birth from when he's born all the way till he dies i want to i want to share something with you that's that is that is uh so true in your life and in my life in the life of jacob and the life of samson let me just say this when god sets his purpose upon a life nothing changes that purpose not even samson was going to shake the purpose of god when god gave a promise i want you to notice this god didn't wait for samson to be born to grow up get past adolescence become a man give his heart to god start serving jehovah and then god goes uh-huh you know what i've been looking at this character right here you know what yep that's him that's it that's the got right there that's the guy i've seen his heart i've seen his obedience that's my guy now i'm gonna appear to manoa and i'm gonna appear to sampson and say samson i've got a special mission for you no no before samson's even born god makes a promise before samson before you ever open your bible and turn to judges and start reading about the life of samson there's already an eternal unchanging unstoppable purpose that god has put over samson's life and no matter where samson goes no matter what he does that purpose follows his life oh that's powerful it doesn't matter where or what samson does there's a promise over his life in other words god says i've already charted your course before you ever breathe your first breath i've charted from the beginning to the middle to almost to the end to the very end i've charted the whole thing i've mapped it all out i've blueprinted your entire life samson now what's up to samson is that he surrenders his will to the will of him who created him i've charted your entire life and it doesn't matter what happens i'm going to be with you from the birth all the way to your death all the way from the cradle to the grave same promise for jacob i'll never leave you i'll be with you in all the places notice how god promises him i'll be with you in all the places but not all the places that jacob goes is where god told him to go not all the terms that he makes are what god told him to make but you know what when god said go left and jacob went right god went right to and jacob followed god jehovah followed his life and he appears jacob arise go back to bethel notice go back to where i touched you go back to where i spoke to you go back to where you made your promise to me go back to the altar where where you met me where you vowed a vow where you created a monument where you created a memorial and you poured oil over remember that jacob i'm the god of that i'm not the god of this i'm not forsaking you i'm not turning my back on you i'm not leaving you i'm going to stay right beside you i'm never going to quit on you i'm never going to forsake you i'm just going to keep giving you my word i'm going to keep reminding you of my word i'm going to keep coming and admonishing you to get back up jacob go back jacob remember all your promises so brother matt surely after that jacob finally stood up and he went back no he stood up but he just kept going jacob in genesis 33 turned their two chapters over he settles in this place called shechem and it's incredible because in hebrew the town shechem means going back not going back to bethel but going back or backsliding and it also means a place of burdens you know when you're out of the will of god when you disobey what the lord has told you do you know what place you go to you go to the place of burdens heavy burdens and shechem he's going to come into all kinds of trouble his house is going to become dishonored his daughter dina is going to become defiled by a boy from shechem now it's incredible because god never told him to go to shechem he taught him to go to bethel don't go to shechem around jacob go back but instead jacob settles down in a place of burdens what's the trouble with brother jacob you know what the trouble is he's jacob that's the trouble remember what we read today the number one enemy you got is you so don't be you you know what i'm referring to don't be you be the real you and the problem with jacob is as long as he's jacob the pattern will never change as long as he's jacob it'll never change but you know what god will never quit and he'll never walk away god you gave up to him surely lord after this i mean he's defiled his how he's shamed his house his daughters raped and now your boys have to go and rescue her and they end up becoming murderers all because jacob disobeys the lord and calamity and collateral damage follow the life of disobedience much like samson's life if you could chart it and pattern samson's life the trouble that he brings upon his entire home and his entire family because he never surrenders he never surrenders he just continues with a promise he's content with an anointing he's content with a promise but he never changes and he barrels over warning after warning after warning after warning after warning mother father samson why do you have to go and get a wife from the daughter of the philistines is there not a girl amongst our own people you know samson says get her for me to wife for she pleaseth me well and you know what happens calamity and trouble and problems and strife and destruction he wakes up in the middle of the night in gaza conviction falls upon his heart he's in a mess he's in trouble god comes on the scene delivers him you know what you know what you notice as you notice a pattern you notice a pattern of this repentance or the sorrow that comes upon his life but not real true repentance because the bible says true god godly sorrow brings forth repentance but you watch a life that that is quick to say i'm sorry but never changes never changes this continues going down the same path getting the same results mom and dad the preacher tries to stop in the pastor isn't it incredible how a person would get into a vehicle and and go down a road and and there's there's barricades in that road saying don't go this way stop flashing lights road closed block box signs and barricades and flashing lights what kind of person would get in their vehicle and just bust over barricade and bust over sandbags and barrels flying everywhere and flashing lights turn around wrong way do not enter and they would just barrel right through every single one of them you say oh i would never brother matt i would never do that but how many warning signs does god bring in our life and we just barrel right over and right over and right over and we just continue to go and continue to go and continue to go arise go back to bethel jacob's house is defiled we don't want to get into it here tonight but notice what happens when god speaks to jacob about his choices and about what he does i want you to look in genesis 35 genesis 35 now we're going to read here the lord responding to jacob and i wonder if it was me who would respond to a man like this or you could respond to a man like this that has caused so much trouble and so much calamity and ruined his home and ruined his daughter and ruined his children how would we treat how would genesis 35 verse 1 read if it was us but i want you to notice how differently our kind heavenly father handles a situation than how we handle it you know god looks very often at things totally different than how you or me do you isaiah says for his ways are are higher god says my ways are higher than your ways as high as the heaven is from the earth so are my ways god oftentimes looks at a situation that you're looking at and you think you're looking at it correctly and righteously and it's totally different than how god sees it notice how god responds to jacob genesis 35 verse 1 and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel wait whoa hold on god now that's good but let's talk about shechem first come on you got to mention something about dina you got to mention something about the mistakes you got to chastise him in some kind of way you've got to scold him lord you've noticed god never mentions any of that jacob knows what mess he's made for himself god never there's no there's no i'm giving up that's it i made up my mind you know what after this long jacob and you messed up this far you just ain't no you know what you know what jacob just forget it just forget i forget it forget i ever even made a promise i'm so glad that's not how god responds to jacob because that means that's not how he responds to me when i busted my head again and again and again and again and again and again and again god just comes back with the same word and the same encouragement arise child get up go back to bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou flettest from the face of esau thy brother get up jacob you know what jacob does he gets up and the bible says he throws out all of his idols he throws out gathers up his entire family look at verse two if you could just keep reading here jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments and let us arise and go up finally finally the son of god is repeating the word of god arise go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went god comes to jacob time and time and time and time again and now jacob gets up takes his family you know what he starts with repentance it must always start with repentance it must always i'm going to say it to you say amen it must always start with repentance a true turning back a cast in the side of my idols and it starts with building an altar and coming back to god notice this here awake awake put on your beautiful garment shake thyself verse 2 of isaiah 52 shake thyself from the dust rise and sit down old jerusalem lose thyself from the bands of thine of thy neck o captive daughter of zion put on your strength that hebrew word is oe it means boldness this is what paul says when he says enter into the throne room of god with boldness come boldly before the throne of god that you may find grace to help in the time of need put on your strength boldness it's like the the the definition i have here says it's like a lion raising up from his bed and shaking his mane to stirring to reveal his strength this is what god is saying to that daughter i've put something inside of you even if you don't believe it's there it's there even if you don't feel like it's there it's there put on your strength oh daughter of zion put on your beautiful garment this is the love this is the kind heavenly loving father to his daughter brother man you say what would have happened lord why wouldn't you have just picked her up why wouldn't you have just reached down and picked her up why didn't you just pick up jacob when jacob got stuck in a rut for 20 years god you could have any time at those moments just supernaturally picked him up and put him on his feet but it does not work that way for sons and daughters of god you've got to get up you say brother man oh if someone would just come and someone could just come and help me like the man at the pool of bethesda i have no man to pick me up and put me in the in the pool awake awake put on your strength what's going to happen if she doesn't she'll die what's going to happen to jacob if he doesn't he'd die he would have never became israel she's a daughter of god he's a son of god do you know what happened to samson's life all of the potential that god had put in his life he spends his entire life running from that call of god you say oh but god gets glory yeah god gets glory in the very end of his life in the very last closing moments of his life god gets glory out of samson's life but all what could have been but oh what could we have read oh what could have been the record of samson's life had he yielded or surrendered to that voice of the lord in his life bow your heads with me if you could we're going to close nothing was holding her down on the ground nothing was stopping her from getting up she was free at any time she was free at any moment to stand up no one's stopping her except her no one's stopping you jacob except you jacob you could have put on your beautiful garment they were there for you the whole time what's stopping you the lord just directed me here tonight minister this to you what stops you 20 years jacob goes down this road it couldn't it didn't have to be it didn't have to be could have ended way long deena didn't have to happen he didn't have to have the collateral damage that he had he didn't have to live in you say well it's a wonderful story and jacob and samson what a wonderful ending oh wonderful god always gets the glory out of a seed gene of god even if it means bringing them to their death and ending their life jesus said all the father hath given me will come unto me and i won't lose one of them but oh what could be daughter of zion no one's stopping you [Music] there's no enemy your garment of holiness is right there you can return at any time but you got to wake up awake wake up put on your strength put on your beautiful garment loose yourself isn't it amazing that chain that you're waiting for god to come down and supernaturally take off of your life he says i've already given you the key all you got to do is unlock it i've already placed inside of you everything children

company delivering cabinets and if you went down tangerine you got to first that's as far as i went you had to go down towards town and the cdo wash didn't have a bridge then and they had it all barricaded and said go back but other cars were going around the barricades and making it across so i said so can i and about halfway through i kept going drifting away from the edge where the water was falling and i got into the sand and the truck went like this and in the middle of cdl wash i was stuck and then the sheriff comes and he tells me i should give you a ticket for crossing the barricades when it was blocked i had to walk out and hook up a chain and tow the truck out but the whole time i'm stuck other cars are going around me and and yeah i'm feeling like a full and embarrassed now i get to the other side he said that's going to be a 40 charge for this i learned my lesson i didn't cross another barricade but i had to go through that experience but you know what when i got to work they paid the fine and they just said don't do it again amazing grace how sweet the sound we heard the grace of god in the lives of each one in the old testament and the grace of god in our lives it says i'm still with you i haven't left you every time you've made a mistake i'm still there for you how many knows that how many could testify how many times god has done that for
