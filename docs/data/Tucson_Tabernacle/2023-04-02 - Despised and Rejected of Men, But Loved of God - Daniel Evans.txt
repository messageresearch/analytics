and you all know that when you find a piano the white keys and The Black Keys are very wide and the cracks are very narrow I tend to inhabit the cracks so but we just had Sunday school this morning we had 11 students and thank you so much for those of you that brought your children we pray that it will be a blessing so I thought the song that I'd like to show you this morning I'd start with a picture that looked like it might come from a Sunday school book but today as you know it's Palm Sunday we know that Jesus entered Jerusalem many times dozens perhaps hundreds but one time one time it was different than every other time that he entered it occurred on what we refer to as Palm Sunday and today Palm Sunday it's a day of the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem to start what we call the passion week and today today Palm Sunday 2023 falls on April 2nd and the 70th week of Daniel brother random tells us now now Jesus Messiah rode into the city of Jerusalem Triumph on the back of a white mule on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 83 [Applause] 1993 years ago to the day April 2nd most years Palm Sunday is not April 2nd today it is and we know the crowds including the 12 disciples were shouting Hosanna which means o save or give now salvation blessed is he that cometh in the name [Music] put a pair Mark 11 they that went before and they that followed cried saying Hosanna blessed is he that cometh In The Name Of The Lord and they were saying what David said in the Psalms and in Psalm 118 26 it starts out blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord they were fulfilling scripture that very day and and I've got it in yellow up there on the screen for those of you that read Hebrew it says Adonai [Music] I'd like us to welcome the Lord in song as so many of them did that momentous Day in Hebrew as you know only too well I'm not a singer so I'm going to need you to join me the tune is so are the words but but for the moment we're we're gonna we're gonna speak in tongues we're gonna sing I just want you to repeat this and and I want you to read it and I want you to repeat it I want to hear you if you can hear me you're not saying it loud enough Baruch bashem Adonai say it with me Adonai now here's what it means if we spoke in tongues you shouldn't do it publicly unless there's interpretation so we're going to interpret it for you [Music] means blessed ha means the ba is comes or coming the object the he is implied by his male gender Hebrews a very compact language so that's blessed is he that comes but is a preposition that means in or in the Shem means name Adonai the the The Vape you might not recognize the Hebrew but the lower left-hand corner there is a good a hey evolve and hay that's the tetragrammatron the Jewish people never pronounce or attempt to pronounce that name so instead they substitute Adonai which simply means Lord [Music] is blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord now you've said it in Hebrew you've spoken it in tongues we're going to sing it together how often are we going to sing it it's a simple tune we'll sing it till you get it when I can't hear you anymore I'll sit down on our pastor can come so I'll sing it once so you get the tune and then we'll go from there [Music] um I don't know I don't know [Music] at a night Hashem [Music] s [Music] that's much better don't you just love to praise the Lord introduced on the anniversary of atonement all of Jerusalem was praising and welcoming him with these very words in great expectation what's your expectation this morning let's do it again in the same language the same words let's stand to our feet let's sing this with enthusiasm it's the same Lord Jesus that rode into Jerusalem on the back of a donkey 1993 years ago is here with us this morning and we should be in the same expectation if not greater than they were then so we'll sing it as we welcome our pastor to the pulpit [Music] I don't know [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] man that feels good that is the first time that I have ever spoken Hebrew thank you thank you thank you let's um while I have you here let's turn in our Bibles to the Book of Luke chapter 14. we've been studying this this author in another book that he wrote and now I want to go back to the original the first book that he wrote [Music] Luke Chapter 14. we'll start with verse 11. for whosoever exalt us himself shall be abased and he that humble himself shall be exalted then said he also to him that bait him when thou makeest a dinner or supper call not thy friends nor thy Brethren neither thy Kinsmen nor thy Rich neighbors lest they also bid thee again and recompense be made another version that's a little easier to understand it says when you give a dinner or a banquet don't invite your friends or your relatives or Rich neighbors unless they also invite you in return and you be repaid verse number 13 when thou makeest a feast call the poor and the maimed the lame the blind and thou shalt be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for Thou shalt be recompense that the resurrection of the just and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and made many sent his servant at supper time to say to them that we're bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make an excuse the first said unto him I've bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray that you have me excused and another said I bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray to have me excused and another said I have married a wife and therefore cannot come so the servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said unto and said to the servant go out quickly into the streets in the lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the Halt and the blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were Biden shall taste of my supper and there went great multitudes with them and he turned and said unto them if any man come unto me and hate not his father and his mother and his wife and children and Brethren and sisters yea in his own life also he cannot be my disciple whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple may the Lord add the blessings to the reading of his word you can be seated thank you I forgot one thing and I forgot to give it to brother Aaron brother Glenn tablinger sent in this prayer request and I want to read it before the congregation this Monday at 8 45 I'm seeing a guest a gastrointolo in gastroenterology specialist they are going to do an exploratory ultrasound and biopsy procedure on the mass in my abdomen the procedure will take about 45 minutes they will be determining the next step they'll need to take I'm believing that the word is true that by his stripes I am healed and that by his stripes I was healed I'm believing for no foreign life in it and that it is benign and will be easily taken care of it'll take about three days for the biopsy results to be returned pray for the Lord's Mercy Grace and deliverance and the results being negative and all is well thank you and God bless you brother Glenn Lord Jesus we lift this request up before you and ask that you would meet the needs of our brother in your name we pray amen it's uh I appreciate it brother Aaron's testimony brother Larry brother Aaron told me called me before right after he had this dream so I'm a witness brother Aaron called me and told me this dream and he said he said brother Daniel he says I don't dream like that he says he says just a few dreams in my life he says but and I could tell he believed that that this dream came from the Lord and brother Aaron I mean that testimony of your dad singing wow you know the Bible says that your young men shall see Visions in your old men so dream dreams so brother Aaron you've graduated my friend God bless you I uh I really appreciate him a while sister Heather and uh and those are working the Sunday School really appreciated the kids coming in that made me feel good um this as brother Lyle pointed out today is Palm Sunday this is this is um sometimes called Holy Week week of Easter one week from today will be Easter um I'd like to have a potluck on Saturday evening with the church and whoever you want to invite every everybody's invited um this coming Saturday at five now we may change the time we may change things a little bit but for right now let's plan on five o'clock this Saturday and I'll send out probably tomorrow I'll send out a confirmation um and everyone's invited and you'll understand why I'm saying that when you hear my sermon today normal time next Sunday morning for Easter and we will not have an evening service next Sunday we uh have a special blessing tonight Brother Martin sister Marjorie Warner are with us dear friends uh there you are I've become close with over the past few months Brother Martin will be preaching tonight and brother Alan and sister Shelly Dole friends of theirs up from up in Edmonton also I assume up near in that area they'll be singing tonight for us so it's we're looking forward to that and then if the Lord's willing on Wednesday I'm going to try to pull on brother martin again to give us a missionary report of his recent trip to Africa looking forward to that greetings all the visitors I see a few faces that I don't readily recognize God bless you all welcome and we have some people that are far less of a visitor than I am the married brother Mark back there God bless you sister Bonnie and uh sister I didn't get your name next to sister Bonnie God bless you my sister welcome it's it's good to see you here it's good to see everyone here this morning The Book of Luke this testimony this parable that I just read about this wedding supper and and how this man this great man it was a story that Jesus told and he was typing it to something and I don't believe that there is a parable in the Bible that Jesus told that is more applicable to this day than this Parable that I read to start the service in the Book of Luke it is it's this man I would assume probably represents Christ calling people to his supper calling people to him and the the people that are represented are those that maybe are the church members maybe are the people that should know Jesus the most that should know this man of the house the most and they're the ones that get invited first and then they have something else to do and they don't see the importance of the supper of this this banquet that this great man is putting on so you'll you see as I read that that they come up with different excuses to why they can't go one of them you know he was busy he just he just bought some land and he wanted to go see it another one just got married and it's just excuse after excuse so it upset this man of the house and he had his servant there and he said if they're not going to come I have all these seats laid out he says I want every seat taken so he says go out go out to the poor people go out to the sick people and compel them to come in brother Branham said when he when he was reading that scripture one time he said there's three polls even associated with that that Parable the first it went out to the it went out to the ones that should know and then it went out to the sick in the healing and it said it said come into these poor people so this servant he goes out and he starts filling up this room filling up this church filling up this table and and he sets them down and they're still their seats open so he goes back to the master and he says the master says is my table full he says he says I did what you said and there's not enough people and he says go back out and find people and bring them here I want every seat full amen amen and another thing those ones that I invited they will never taste of my supper they won't ever they'll they'll never be invited back it's going to be these people taking these seats that were really meant for someone else but because they will humble themselves and because you know what they appreciated Brother Martin they appreciated a meal they appreciated someone inviting them and showing them a little bit of love and they they came in and they filled they filled this this place up and the bad thing was those people that had such a good life Maybe they were spoiled it didn't mean anything to him they didn't appreciate it they didn't appreciate and I'll say with with maybe with church they didn't appreciate a church that they could come to because they were so used to it they didn't appreciate a group of people maybe that loved them because they were used to it it wasn't something different to them but these people that came off the streets they were like wow this is this is special will come or you bet will come I want to sit at that table I want to eat that food I am honored to even be here but the others it's an excuse Lord you know I'm busy I'm gonna start praying I'm going to start coming to church I'm going to start reading my Bible I'm going to start I'm going to start a work at church I'm gonna I'm gonna start reaching out to my friends maybe that have left I'm going to start who's not sir these people that aren't serving the lord Lord I'm going to reach out to them I know them I'm going to start I'm going to I'm going to welcome them I'm going to maybe have them over to my home for dinner I'm gonna I'm going to I'm gonna be nice to them but Lord you know how busy I am today I just don't have time to do it I'll do it tomorrow you know what you won't do it tomorrow because tomorrow will come and you'll still be busy you'll still have something better to do than serve the Lord and then you'll be busy the next day and eventually you won't be capable of doing it anymore and then you look back and maybe say you know I really wish that I would have done more but you'll get to a point that it's too late now but as I say many times if you're breathing today in the audience it looks like everybody is then there is still time to start working one of the greatest experiences of my life people a lot of times they say well the Lord spoke to me about this and this and this and this and then it gets to be too common and they think maybe because they have a thought that the Lord spoke to them but I really believe on my 33rd birthday the Lord spoke to me I was on my knees and I was praying and I said Lord I am 33 years old I'm the same age as Jesus was as you were when you gave all of you gave your life for all of humanity and I've never done anything for you and yes as a young man I I was paying my tithes I was going to church I had a good life I had a couple of babies that were you know the the healthy and good you know sweet kids I had a good job I was making plenty of money we had a new house up in Oro Valley we were doing really good at a pretty wife I still got one same one um I was a good Christian I was doing what I should have been doing yet there were still there was something missing in my life there was something when I was praying when I was on my knees that day there was something that wasn't there that should have been there and I I understood that and I asked the Lord Lord I'm I'm this age and I've never done anything for you and the thought came to my mind of this young man that we call the Rich Young Ruler in the very same position I was at that time on my 33rd birthday he most likely if you read the scriptures looks like he had a wife he probably had young children he was doing well in life so much so that he was progressing in the work that he was doing that later on we see that he had to build barns for all of his stuff that he had and I was on my knees and I was I was praying and then felt like the Lord told me he said move to Jefferson though and it's a long story but the Lord just opened up all these doors and I was so excited and and Stephanie and I and the kids you know we moved we got there and the Lord continued to bless me and and I kept thinking about this man the Rich Young Ruler and what he did and it scared me because I was that same I was in his position and there's many here we may not be young but there's many here that are in the same position maybe we all are and what are we going to do with what God's given us let's turn to Mark I have time let's turn to Mark chapter 10. and I want to read this story it's it's short verse 17. Lord Jesus when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeling kneeling to him and asked him good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus answered him and said why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defied not defraud not honor thy father and thy mother and I could have answered the same as this man answered he said and he said unto him Master I've observed all these from my youth I'm doing it I'm living this Christian Life I'm already doing it Jesus beholding him loved him I've always known the Lord's loved me as you do you can feel that and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and take up the cross and follow me Jesus is telling him he's you're a good man you pay your tithes you live true to your wife you don't lie you honor your parents and your parents are very proud of you and what you've accomplished in life but I require that you give everything especially the thing that means the most to you and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions he knew good and well that he wasn't going to do that you know Jesus you're asking too much of me I'm a good Christian I go to church I never miss a service do you know how hard I have worked to build up this wealth that I have this wealth is what makes me important this wealth is what gives me respect in the church this wealth wealth is when I walk into the church is in the clothes that I wear I have nicer clothes so I I'm welcomed and I don't want to be like Peter and John these guys who look at the way they're dressed I don't want to be like that they don't have any money at all they're not respected but I have this respect I have this respect because I've what I've worked for and and I've put this together and now I can contribute to the church and I like that and you know he's he I'm sure he was thinking I'm able to buy people lunch I'm able to give to the poor I may I'm able to do all of this but we can see that that problem that he had that money and what that money got him was the very thing that was going to send him to hell and Jesus loved this young man just as he loved me and he he loves you he loved this man and Jesus understood that what's on this Earth is not that important but what's on the other side is what's important and if this thing it may buy you happiness it may give you respect but if this thing is going to send you to hell and keep you from the kingdom get rid of it it's not worth it you know if and I'm not telling everybody to go go sell everything and and give it to the poor but if there's something that is standing between you and God that that is the most important thing in your life then get rid of it it may be it may be your time it may be a television standing between you and God that you just that's the most important thing I spend my time doing that or it might be your phone it might be social media it might it could be anything but whatever that is that stands between you and God get rid of it you know what you know what it was for me this may sound really strange it was hunting and fishing when I was that age when I was 33 years old and I was there praying in my in in my room my thoughts were always up in the mountains oh and how I loved and I would take Stephanie and the kids and we put the kids in the backpacks and we we'd go and I used to always think about just how much I love this hunting and I and I would guide other people and and it was just so important to me but it was separating me from God such a small thing like that you think well that's a wholesome thing where it could sin come in it wasn't sinful it was it was standing between me and God I spent more time thinking about that so then when I moved to Jeffersonville you know what I didn't have anymore he said I didn't have hunting anymore man remember when we used to go you can't do that back there it's just yeah yeah you rent a oh you rent a farm and you go Massacre some poor deer that walks by with them 50 feet of you or whatever it's just the dumbest thing to hunt back there but I digress don't tell anybody who said that but it it was it was something that was important to me and I was able and I thank God I was able to to give that up and I gave it up for the Lord and now I come back and I no I still enjoy but it's not as it's not like it used to be and I I look at this young man and I can see how much how much that money meant to him it was just it was the most important thing because that's what gave him his importance he drove the nice car people he would show up to church and people would respect him and imagine if Jesus and he didn't know Jesus was the Messiah really here he seek all them good masteries he says basically you're a good preacher you're a good Minister you say things that are really encouraging to me and when he heard Jesus say this it was like oh no and the same thing could be with the whoever the minister is in the Pulpit or some one of your friends tell you he doesn't have to be some important person but when he says something and you take it like oh that's right and there's something inside of you that knows that this is something I have a problem with and you ignore it and continue on and that voice is speaking to you like it was to me you're spending too much time you're thinking about it too much there's not enough time in this Bible there's not enough time in prayer and the more it's like no no it may be your money you know it's you're thinking too much about it you're you're you're you're earning too much money it's it's taking it's taking the toll on you it's taking the toll on your walk with the Lord and you start ignoring that voice and ignoring that voice pretty soon that voice will become silent as it did with this man and that voice will stop speaking to you and then your time is over when there's no more of a conviction anymore and that's what happened with this young man and he kept on the way he was going and he didn't fail he didn't fall he continued to prosper verse number 23. and Jesus looked around about and saith unto the disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God how many people has the Love of Money sent to hell and think about it does your testimony go out the window when you're dealing with money how many times have I heard that so-called Believers cheating each other and fighting and not paying their bills and not living up to an agreement these things can send us to hell just as drinking and smoking and drugs and prostitution and and fornication and adultery those things too these things can send us to hell too let's skip to verse 28. then Peter began to say Lo we have left all and have followed thee Peter's like obviously we don't have any money we left our jobs we gave away everything and Jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there is no man that has left house or Brethren or sisters or father and mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the Gospels but he shall receive a hundred fold now in this time houses and Brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecution and in the world to come eternal life he said Peter Peter's like Lord we've left everything we've left our money we we we've left our jobs to follow you and Jesus very plainly said that is not enough you've got to leave everything Peter this Christianity isn't just I'm just going to make a little sacrifice here and there I'm going to come to church I'm going to be a faithful Church guard I'm going to be I'm going to pay my tithes I'm going to I'm going to I'm not going to cost not going to drink not gonna smoke not gonna do those things he requires everything every part of our Lives Jesus requires and you can see why he said straight As the gate and narrow is the way brother Dan and few there will be to find it very few but he gave us a blueprint here you've got to let me read that again verse number 29 and Jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there is no man that hath left house or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake in the gospels but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and Brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life you've got a much greater reward if you make a little sacrifice for God he's going to give you a lot not Prosperity Gospel like oh if I give my church a thousand dollars I'm gonna get ten thousand dollars that's nonsense no what will happen is if you give the church a thousand dollars you're gonna be out a thousand dollars you're not gonna you're not gonna receive that because that's not what it's about it's not so you're gonna have more money what it's about is you giving it because you believe in the cause but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first and I really believe that that Rich Young Ruler that was me that made the right choice I think about I think about him and Jesus himself loved him and this man he was he's probably just very very capable a very capable person somebody that all of us would want to have in church he comes up and he kneels down and he said he says what do I need to do to receive eternal life and there is Jesus Jesus says forsake everything and follow me think about that statement I wonder we'll never know he wasn't even important enough to put his name in there but I wonder if he would have been a disciple I wonder if he would have been one of the twelve and look at how much we know about all these disciples and all that they did and here is this man we don't even know his name and he just couldn't couldn't do it that one thing he couldn't do it and now he's alive today and he's regretting that decision and I think back about this table that this master has set and he says these people like the Rich Young Ruler were invited and they said well I'm busy I got to go take care of this I gotta go take care of that and here's the Master of the House saying he'll never he will never eat at my table I don't care how important he is I don't care how good he is I don't care I want my table filled now I want these church pews filled now and I want the people to come in that appreciate it that want it I was you know we were teaching on the book of Acts chapter one the other a couple weeks ago and Peter knew that it was prophesied that they that that this one that was taken out this Judas that it had to be replaced and he replaced him with Matthias but there was there was a void there and it had to be filled and that is the same as God's table if there is a void taken out it has to be it has to be filled because the Lord was really dealing with me this week especially on Tuesday I woke up in the morning I uh took the day off of work I woke up in the morning and I just I just felt the presence of the Lord and it's this it's this heavy feeling I feel and I just felt like Lord there's something you're doing something and prayed and and I feel like when that when I feel but I'm gonna when I feel that presence I feel like ask pray because he's listening to me so I was praying and then I said Lord I just feel like you're going to do something today and I uh went picked up Heath and uh and your boy and they came and helped in the in the room up here and um the moral sister Roberta came and helped also and I just had this heavy feeling all day it's like Lord I feel like you're gonna like you're gonna do something and and we worked and we were painting and we were doing our thing and and putting together furniture and and I took Heath back to his house and I picked up uh Daniel came and and started we kept working up there in the room up there trying to get things ready continued to work and as I said on Wednesday the the door was open and we heard these voices from outside the church a very strange thing there was only a couple cars in the parking lot and it's these these girls and they say hello anybody there who would drive up to the Tabernacle with only a couple cars and then walk up about here and start hollering is anybody home so uh Daniel walked out and greeted them and and and showed them around and I was thinking of my mind Lord is is this it is is this what is this what you've been dealing with me about and and Daniel showed him around and they ended up saying they said we used to we used to come to church here when we were little we went to the school up here and they were so excited and they were talking about everything that was going on and and they were just so happy and fellowshipping and uh the one girl said she says you know what she says I was baptized right there and I I was just like oh Lord maybe this is it maybe it's these two young ladies and they end up coming to church on Wednesday night with their families Salazar family is the name and many of you know Sister Salazar they ended up coming to church on Wednesday night but we were they left and and uh we finished up upstairs and then I and it was dark it was it was pretty well into the evening and I walked into the church to shut off all the lights still just heavy on my heart Lord what is going on is it those two Souls so I walked in and I shut off all the lights and then brother Ernie I walked in to the sanctuary it was dark and the lights were on the platform and I thought oh God I walked in and I could feel the presence of the Lord and and I was standing back there and I didn't know what to say didn't know what to do and seeing this light and I thought I have never seen a more beautiful place in my whole life than where I'm standing right now seeing this cross lit up in this light and the Darkness out there I was just overwhelmed and I I leaned on the Pew and I said Lord do you want This Place full of people and I was leaning there and I had a um a thought a vivid thought and and I was looking around the audience and I was seeing just every Pew just a thought every Pew full and and I bowed my head and I said Lord I don't know what to pray for I don't know what you want do you want that I prayed as the Lord If It Be Your Will and then fill this place up but if it not be not your will then Lord bring somebody whoever it is that wandering soul I went and got Daniel and I brought Daniel Daniel in and we stood back there and Daniel was just like wow and we just stood back there for a little bit just taking it in so I I get back in the car get back in in my vehicle and I'm driving home I said Lord is was that it driving home it's I don't know 8 30 or whatever 8 or 8 30 whatever time it was and I was just just feeling the presence of the Lord and I stopped to pick up a Subway sandwich at Subway for Stephanie and me and walked in to the place and it was this um black man there middle aged and uh started talking to him ordered my sandwich I was the only one in the store started talking with him and he made a statement he said something on the order of well I said something I can't remember what I said he said something on the order of well it's either Heaven or Hell and I looked at him and I said do you believe that there's a real hell and he says yeah he says he says I believe that you could be in Hell on Earth and I could tell right there he's struggling he needed something because I could tell he was thinking that he was on this hell on Earth and I said I said I'm a minister and uh he didn't really answer and I said um I said his I said what are your plans I said you're gonna stay at Subway and he said I'm 57 years old and he said you can imagine why I'm working here he says you can you can imagine the mistakes that I've made I said well I said why don't you come to church and he said well um I said do you go to church he said no I said well why don't you come to church I said I'd like for you to come and he says well he goes let me ask my store manager which what she thinks because she's uh she's she goes sometimes she goes to church so he said hey uh Melissa he said hey come on out and she comes out and uh tattoos on her arm sweet and she comes up she walks up to me she said do you believe in the Holy Ghost I said yes ma'am I said I said I believe that that should be the goal of all of us to receive the Holy Spirit and she said she talked to me about a few other things and I said why don't you why don't you come to church and she says okay she says I have a nine-year-old son brother Lyle and I said we're just this weekend's gonna be our first Sunday school class she says I have to work she said but she said but I'm going to try she says I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna switch with somebody and I'm gonna come to church and and then the man his name's will and he said he says yeah I'll come too and I said I said my praise God I said I want to see you so I went and I got in my my vehicle and I sat there I said Lord what am I doing I said these people and my mind went worldly my mind went to the world and I said I said these people they don't have much that they can bring to our church they don't have much to offer and I said you know and I was I was just thinking and there was been somebody this has been a family in my heart that I've been wanting to come to church and and they just haven't given me the time of day some a family that could really bring a lot and and I was I was thinking about that person and I was oh they have you know they're well off and they're just they're just good people and I was thinking about those people and then I was thinking about this woman and this man inside of Subway and I was like Lord what am I doing am I doing right for however long that you want me to be in this position at church am I even going in the right direction I was thinking I should be witnessing on the golf course or something no I was like Lord what do you want me to do and then I felt that same presence and the question came in my mind who do you want to be there at your church and I didn't hesitate I said Lord I want them that are in Subway those are the people that I want here those are the people that you cried out to come and fill my table up and he did and they're going to be they're going to come to church I assume they're going to come where else are they going to go who else cares about them think about it who else cares but God cares who is more important is it the Rich Young Ruler I'm not I'm not comparing the the other guy to the Rich Young Ruler but this is different but isn't the Rich Young Ruler or is it Peter and John that don't have two nickels to rub together who's more important it's the ones that will humble themselves that will come it's the ones that feel honored it's the ones that come to that table say I'm not worthy to come to this table it's the ones that that are out there maybe the drug addicts maybe the ones that were in prison whoever it is it's them that we compel to come in it's scripture bring them in I think about I think about my grandpa brother Evans being as close brother branham's two best friends woods and Evans to nobodies in this world nobodies my grandpa he ran a filling station down in Georgia he would save up all of his money and spend it to go and hear a message to drive wherever it was because he saw something real he saw the Holy Spirit working so he would give everything just to go my my grandpa and my um and brother woods and brother Branham were out to eat one time brother Woods looked over he looked over the table and the waitress comes and he says I'll have what their what that person's having over there so so they ordered off the menu then brother Woods gets up and and go goes somewhere brother Brandon tells my grandpa he says you see how he ordered he said he can't read this man brother Brown's best friend he can't read think about that same Spirit of Christ I think about sister Alberta and your family sister batazzi sold her wedding ring so that they could come down and come to a meeting where the Holy Spirit was moving when I when she told me that she said I don't think anything of it what was more important to her compared David and Carol batazi to this Rich Young Ruler look at the difference because they appreciated it and that's where brother Brandon came to this little place Jeffersonville had this little church it wasn't much but it was what God chose and the people came brother I think about Elijah he was out and he called the famine and who did God send Elijah the prophet to he sent her to a poor widow woman with a son that we're about to die that were as poor as you get brother Ed they that's who God chose was this poor widow woman and that's who he we should never neglect these people Luke chapter 7. I love this story of Mary of Bethany verse 36. it means so much to me it means so much to me to see people to see people that want the Lord not not are thinking they're so good but people that want to be here that people that want to hear the gospel people that want to be healed people that want to give their hearts to the Lord people that have a desire that's who fills up his table and it's people like this sister I'm going to read about right now those are God's people and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with them speaking of the Lord Jesus and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment now when the Pharisees which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself this man Simon the Pharisee if this man were a prophet would he have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner a low-life poorly dressed woman that had lived in sin that everybody knew her and what a bad reputation that she had Jesus wasn't too good for her and Jesus answering said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 Pence the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him the most Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seethau this woman I entered into thine house and gave us and now gave us me no water from my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou does not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven she believed imagine how that felt and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace Simon the Pharisee looked at the way that she was dressed he looked at the way that she looked and he didn't he could not see and he didn't care that there was a desire to serve God she was wrong she sinned she didn't maybe she didn't know better and here she comes in and she sees maybe this congregation oh God oh Lord thank you thank you for giving me the honor of coming in here and we and we might say well you know the way that the way that she looks or there may be somebody come in the man and maybe the man doesn't look maybe he's not dressed right maybe he doesn't look like he should never Jesus did not cast them out at least they came which is more that we could say about this Rich Young Ruler he was he was he wanted the world he wanted his own if the sisters if the musicians could come I remember I knew a brother in Jeffersonville and he heard the gospel of the hour and he just loved it rough background he'd go on his way home from work pick up a six-pack go home set it down crack One open and listen to a tape he didn't know any better and as he started listening the Lord started working on him and he started he started getting better and better and he's like oh I should not have done that but he was innocent in doing it now the brother is a Believer one of the strongest Believers you'll ever know but that's how that's how he came and that's how he started that Rich Young Ruler he didn't have any baggage [Music] he didn't have a past behind him he came in everybody's accepted all the you know the the the the good young man like I wasn't 33 years old everything going just right [Music] but he cared more about the things in the world than the things of God and look at these sinners these people that we say well a pastor might say well what do they bring to the church let me tell you something they bring Jesus Christ to this church I'd rather have Jesus than anything else I'd rather have Mary Magdalene than Jezebel any day of the week I'd rather have I'd rather have Peter and James and John these people that were that were rough than this Rich Young Ruler anytime and [Music] we don't look our brother last week how did he put it he said defiled in the body pure in spirit boy did I appreciate brother Jonathan that was good wasn't it appreciated what he said [Music] when I was at Subway I don't necessarily [Music] know that it was those two people but I know God was teaching me he was telling me it was showing me these are my people these are the people that I have already asked these other ones to come they refused me but my table will be full we're looking at we're looking at Palm Sunday today it was probably brother Lyle it was probably the highlight of Jesus's Ministry there he is coming into this coming into the city of Jerusalem the holiest place on Earth riding on a donkey people throwing their their clothes down in front of him so so the donkey wouldn't walk on the dirt and throwing Palm leaves down and waving singing Hosanna Here Comes This triumphant King [Music] into the city this great king this great young Rabbi at 33 years old [Music] and in less than a week he was dying on the cross a convicted felon a convicted sinner with two men on either side two of the worst two of the biggest sinners in the world and there is Jesus [Music] completely forsaken and there is Jesus there with his arms stretched out and yet [Music] he led someone to the kingdom even in his death even before he died still leading Souls to the kingdom of God and there is Jesus now coming into us [Music] and how that burden should be in us all the time Jesus said take up your cross and follow me that cross is heavy he was carrying that cross that cross put him out of the churches that cross caused him to give up any type of riches that he would have ever had that cross required a complete and total separation from Jesus Christ himself and then he said now you take up your cross you take your cross and you did you do what I do it's not just being a good Christian it's everything in our lives carrying that cross Lord whatever you would have me do whatever Lord that that I can give to you that I can get rid of or that I can do I want to do it and I want to I want to be that one I want to be that one that the master sends out and says go get them and then I might bring one in and I Lord I I brought one in since there's all these empty seats go get more go get em continue to bring them in that is Christianity that is the true meaning behind this parable but Martin you go all over the world I know and and you're you're doing your best to give more into this Kingdom and the missionary work is all of us are missionaries and it should be right here at home the poor lame the blind the sinner like Mary this sinner come in sister come in foreign these brothers the thief on the cross vile sinner brother come in come in that's the people [Music] he said go out into the hedges go to the highways and compel them to come in let's stand [Music] if there is anything friends if there is anything in your life that prevents you from taking up this same cross that Jesus carried that prevents you from taking that get rid of it it's not worth it [Music] if it's money give it all away like Jesus told told the um Rich Young Ruler if it's a television get rid of it if it's a phone get a flip phone they're kind of coming into style now whatever it is that's separating you Christ get rid of it because it is not worth it it is not worth you may live good here but it's not worth going to that place at that same Rich Young Ruler went to it's powerheads [Music] think about him friends Jesus said take up your cross follow me Walk In by footsteps do what I did [Music] pray for these people at Subway that I wouldn't assume pray for these young ladies that that came by the church just after Wednesday after Wednesday service they were just weeping they said we have no idea why we did that we have no idea why we came [Music] the one said I told Daniel when they left I told I told Daniel I said buddy what just happened [Music] and they told me that when they were leaving without me hearing me say that they said to each other what just happened [Music] the Lord was working [Music] dear Lord we are thankful dear God that you have given us so much Lord let us take all that you have given us and let us go out and compel them to come in [Music] Oh Lord You're So Good we love you so much I'm so grateful shown us the way father we pray that we can walk that straight and narrow path and dear Lord we pray for this church may it be a lighthouse Lord I believe it already is dear Lord I Thank you for walking in and just Lord looking at this platform looking at this pulpin thinking how many people have knelt down and given their hearts to the Lord in that very place foreign chest and said I'm not worthy to go in [Music] me a sinner Lord I Thank you may we stand for Jesus Christ and for lost souls help us Lord help us to walk that straight and narrow and show us how we can carry that cross please love you amen [Music] there was nothing [Music] good [Music] morning [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] sorry [Music] there is from with me living on there is a fountains every song O come to this water there is a is awesome [Music] there is a river [Music] that came down from heaven like a rock washing my mind [Music] God [Music] is a river [Music] names foreign [Music] friends does it feel good doesn't it feel good to have the Lord Jesus that no matter what we've done no matter where we've gone or what we come from or what sins that we've we've committed there's something in our hearts that wants to be right and we know that that something is Jesus Christ calling us the closer I get to the Lord the more of a desire I have to get even closer to him it's like a ball when it when it starts rolling down a hill it picks up speed and it picks up speed and the farther it gets down the faster it goes the faster it wants to go that's my heart's desire friends God bless you all I pray that you can take something that I said today that you can apply it that you can welcome that you can go out and and be a blessing to someone and remember like I said that Jesus table is going to be filled I just want to make sure I'm sitting there for a while I want to make sure I'm there I want to make sure my
