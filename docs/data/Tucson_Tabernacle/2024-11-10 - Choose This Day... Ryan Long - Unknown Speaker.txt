brother Ryan I think the first sermon you preached here was ringing in my ears for the past few days brother Ryan made a made a comment he said that uh he said when when when you're at a service he said and and the minister says something he says don't automatically think oh it would be it would have been great for this person that's not here right now they should have heard this and and I'm going to send them this video and and and this really you should have been there he said you were there and it was for you and Wednesday night I was thinking so much of you all and I was thinking oh this would have been great for all of you all to hear and and then I was thinking no brother Ryan said don't think that way but it was great and I wish everybody was here what a testimony we heard from um from Brother John Davis from um up in Alaska what just tremendous how the Lord brought him out of alcoholism and and and just crime and and brought him just done did A great miracle in his life if you haven't watched it it's on our website you can go back and you can watch it um I wanted to share a testimony before we get started and before we take up the offering um what happened to me this past week I was um I was down I was uh just a bit overwhelmed with everything that's going on all these decisions that had to be made and um with with the new Courtyards looking beautiful and and uh the um Fellowship Hall and everything that we're going to be doing here and I just felt like like Lord I'm just not measuring up I'm failing in a lot of things I need to do a better job and I got I just got discouraged and you know sometimes you get discouraged and then you start getting kind of a negative attitude and and that's how I started to feel and then I have some other things going on um outside of church that have been a a we on Weighing on me and um I started to just get a little bit more taking an just an attitude that that wasn't quite quite right I usually have a positive attitude I I don't have high highs or low lows I'm just I'm usually pretty steady but I was discouraged and I don't know if it was um Friday or yesterday morning I can't remember when it was could have been even uh Thursday um but I was uh I was just kind of U just kind of down I was kind of thinking thinking on things and all of a sudden immediately I felt this this Rush of like positive energy and and it was this renewed feeling of excitement to the church and excitement to everything that's going on and and saying you we can do this and and and then I started started having these ideas and and it just it felt so good just this real positive attitude and this real strength that entered me and it it stuck with me and I was I was just I was feeling just just great and then yesterday morning Daniel and I went to hear Brother Paul durksen at the Shalom Tabernacle meetings and uh before service I was um just had my Bible open I wasn't reading it but I was just thinking like Lord I feel so good I just feel I feel like you really help me and you know how I am about saying that God said or God told me we have to be careful in doing that however I felt this really strong feeling that God was speaking to me and I felt like he said this as I was as I was thanking the lord for for this change in attitude that I had I felt like the Lord told me somebody prayed for you and I said Lord wow it happened and that very moment I firmly believe that that very M moment that I had a change of attitude and and and this great encouragement I believe there was somebody probably here that was was praying for me and God heard those prayers and it changed me and and it worked and I think thank God thank God that we can pray for each other the Book of James and and I felt led and here's the direction that we're going to move over the next month is we're going to go into the Book of James on Sunday morning and and I'm going to teach word line by line in this book and it's it's a tremendous lesson and and I was just I was feeling just the confidence and moving forward in that and and and believe it's in James chapter 5 the last chapter in James it says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much that righteous man that word man is a generic term for a person so the sisters also it's not it's not gender specific the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous per person has a great effect and I am a witness to that brothers and sisters Somebody Prayed for me and I felt the the success it availed much and that's how we should be for each other the effectual for our prayers for each other they work don't be discouraged in praying for one another don't be discouraged in lifting one another up because it works pray for your friends pray for your friends family those that are going through a hard time pray for them it worked for me I am the recipient and it will work for you I firmly believe that I wanted to share that with the church knowing yes I Promise You by the word of God God hears your prayers and they make a difference Sister Sarah Z brenon she says this please pray for my boss and his family my boss lost his son on Friday due to a motorcycle accident that's uh can only imagine the relationship between a father and a son and um how how what that family is going through through now so Sister Sarah ask that we pray for this this man and his family um brother Joe texted me this morning very important prayer request and she's probably in surgery right now I think sister MaryAnn's amarano uh has hip surgery is having hip surgery right now so if we could pray as a church um if the brothers could come forward for the offering also um sister Shirley Mo writes please pray for Sister Sarah cogner and her sister they needs God's strength this morning we were um went to visit it's probably a year ago sister Sarah's sister and she was on her deathbed and we went in sister Shirley were you there when we went and prayed we went and and uh and prayed for her sister and this was there were they weren't expecting she was hoping that her family could get down from I believe they're in Phoenix to come down and see her and uh that was going to be the next day she was hoping that she can make it that far and it's been almost a year it's been a year and she's still alive still still the Lord's still dealing with her so if we could pray for Sister Sarah and uh and her her sister and then sister hope buckles texted me just now she's sick um and she needs a touch from the Lord let's all stand brothers and sisters I am a witness God answers prayer he did a miracle in my life this week I mean he changed everything and it was in in in a moment it was immediate so whoever whoever was praying for me um thank you sincerely I thank you because God God blessed me because of it if you have a request let's bow our heads if you have a request on your heart that you'd like to make known to the Lord with an uplifted hand raise your [Music] hand our father thank you so much Lord thank you for all that you do for us thank you for what you've done for me Lord we raise our hands in the name of Jesus Christ

we've maybe forgotten you Lord that you give us that that that Revelation Lord to just call out to you Lord I believe you remember our name I believe you know it Lord I I I just want to lean on you now Lord we want to just approach your word Lord as a as Lord a group of Believers that have come together Lord with one purpose Lord I pray and that's to hear from you this morning Lord to have you take just a single word out of your out of your Bible Lord Lord and just open it to our hearts father that's what we want this morning Lord we want to be blessed we want to be touched we want to be healed Lord we want to be saved L Lord we want to hear from you this morning we want to feel your presence and your spirit Among Us Lord and we ask you would just come now in jesus' name amen amen good morning God bless everybody here forgive me this morning just a little uh I I know if the word is nervous but um just had the Lord kind of I believe it was the Lord you know I had a lot of things on my on my plate per se maybe a lot of things on my mind that I wanted to speak about and just have the Lord kind of erase all that yesterday and uh it's a little scary and it's good scary but it's uh it's much easier when you're not standing up here to say that it's good I've heard other ministers tell me you the Lord just kind of you just kind of erased my thought and I'm like oh it's going to be good brother and I believed it at the moment but I know they didn't so and now I find myself in that same place but you know we just I could not I wouldn't be able to drive over here and stand before you if I didn't serve a God that I could trust and I believe that you wouldn't even waste the time to come to church and get dressed up and come over here if you didn't believe in the same God that I believe in and so what I want to do do and I pray what you'll do this morning is that if we can just even more just let go and let him have his way this morning amen let's just read a scripture um I got a scripture I got that much so if we can read a scripture I think we're doing a good start there Luke 16 um and uh we're just going to pray that the Lord uh gives us notes and gives us what to say this morning I'm not a I'm not a preacher um but uh I I definitely love the Lord amen that's all I know I can do is I can love the Lord and we're just going to we're just going to turn it over to him amen so Luke 16 and uh let's see I want to start with verse 10 he says he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much if therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches and if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's who shall give you that which is your own and then the verse I wanted to get to it says no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon you may be seated and maybe why this scripture stuck out to me I I just want to I'm really going to talk to you from my heart this morning because I can't talk to you from a notepad and um so it might be real short brother Dan it might might I appreciate it I know that I know the kids and secretly some of the adults get real happy if the minister says it's going to be short so maybe I could just make you all happy by just you know if we just spent 15 20 minutes around the word I think it's better spent than any other thing that I could do I don't know how you feel and I feel blessed already that I was just able to come in and and be under the presence of worship be under the presence of of really a god that we all love and serve and when we invite him with our worship he comes and I've already felt him today I've already felt him in testimony so if we just spent just a few minutes around a scripture I think it would I think it would be beneficial but no more beneficial than if he just came right now and touched your heart and really the preaching of the word is important but nothing is as important as God himself the person God coming down and just revealing to you one single thing and I believe that he if he hasn't done that for you already I believe he can do do that for you right now amen and that's the kind of God that I serve you know there's no reason why that you can't be touched by the Holy Ghost right now I know that that we talk about it all the time and maybe we even strive for it maybe we even believe it maybe we want it but there's no reason that you can't have the Holy Ghost right now and you might say I already have the Holy Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost you'll want more that's right I I never want to have the attitude that I've received too much from God and if you don't have the Holy Ghost I I heard this saying and I believe it's true you know what the devil does is he he convinces those that don't have the Holy Ghost that they're okay and he convinces those that do have the holy ghost that they're not okay I don't know where you sit this morning right I I think I've been in both seats before sometimes in the same service sometimes I started off thinking that I was not so good and then by the end I thought I was good and I don't know where I was at but I'm telling you when the Holy Ghost comes not just in a service it's it's good when we praise the Lord amen it's good when we feel his anointing around the the sanctuary and around the people but there's nothing like when it drops down inside your heart that's when lives are changed you know I feel good when I come into an atmosphere of worship but I could walk out the same person I could walk out even worse I could walk out in that presentence leave or I leave that presence and I haven't taken them with me but when that Holy Ghost drops down inside I don't even have plan to read this scripture but there's a scripture it talks about in Acts 10 where Peter comes Upon A group of Believers you know the Lord had given him a vision that that these that these Believers even though they were Romans that it was good for him to be able to go to them and preach the word I don't know about you but sometimes I feel just like a Roman I I don't feel worthy of the Gospel I I I read the Bible I read the message I don't feel worthy that something this good was sent to me but God sent a vision to Peter while he was just resting in a room that said you call now he he showed him a vision of animals of food but Peter caught a revelation he showed him these visions of these food and he said you know we don't eat this food as a as a Jewish na we don't eat this food and God said what you have called unclean I call clean and Peter got a revelation later on when the Lord sent him to talk to these Romans and he said you know normally I wouldn't talk to you I wouldn't preach to you because you're not worthy but God changed my mind is what Peter said God changed my mind he goes and he confesses to him he doesn't come to him to go well just buckle up now I'm going to preach to you he starts off with saying you know I was wrong I thought of you as dirty I thought of you as unworthy maybe you think of yourself that way I know certainly I think of myself that way sometimes but God doesn't see you that way that doesn't sound convincing right you say but I see the I see what's wrong God has to see what's wrong but he doesn't have to see what's wrong because he made a way that he would never have to see what you've done wrong he sent his son right simple simple message he sent his son and his son died but the purpose was that God would never have to look upon you and I and see our sin and then God gives this Vision over to Peter and he says what you call unclean I say is clean and Peter talking to these Romans he says you know I normally wouldn't preach to you but I was wrong and the Lord revealed to me that what I thought was unclean which is you is actually clean and worthy of him so now I'm going to preach to you the gospel and Peter starts to just give them even what we heard right now brother brother Dan he just starts to give them a testimony he doesn't tell them how they got to live he doesn't tell them what they're doing wrong certainly they were probably doing things wrong he doesn't start with that you know he starts to tell them well I want to tell you about the Lord Jesus and he starts to tell them how the Lord Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit to do this and the Holy Spirit was led by this to to perform this miracle and to preach this type of message and to save the lost and he starts to speak to them just a test Tony about Jesus you can do exactly that same thing you who you might think that you're unworthy are actually worthy to take the testimony of Jesus to somebody and by doing that now Peter's talking to them and they're listening they're listening to him and um I don't have the scripture in front of me because I honestly didn't didn't remember I didn't plan on reading it I think it's in uh if you give me a moment I'm going to find it I believe it's in Acts when I tell you that I'm I'm going to be led of the Lord this morning I want really want to be led of the Lord this morning I don't have any notes I want to just speak to you this morning actually I don't want to speak to you at all this morning I want to I want to let the Lord have his way it it's in 10 yeah verse thank you so he's talking about these these men and he's preaching to them and we get all the way all the way to the end of the chapter I believe so he preaches to him for 43 verses telling them testimonies of Jesus Christ telling them testimonies of what God did and I love this verse it says in 44 it says while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon all of them which heard the word amen and I love this verse because you know I I've heard and I I'll just I just I I'll leave this real General because I don't want to I don't I'm not picking on anybody but I've heard I've heard ministers use this scripture to say you have to be listening to the minister in order to receive the Holy Ghost but I love this scripture because it says while Peter yet spake and if you actually take those words and you find out what they mean they that means while he was still speaking the Holy Ghost fell on those that heard him and I almost think of it as even even while he was speaking in spite of Peter speaking the Holy Ghost fell on those that were listening which mean it really had nothing to do with Peter but it had to do with those that were listening to the word and I believe in Ministry I'm not up here to tell you that we don't believe in a Ministry but really it's it's a condition of you it's a condition of the heart you know we even talk about prayer and and I believe that kneeling down to to pray I believe that that's a good thing I I don't don't come away saying brother Ryan said don't kneel down to pray but I'm telling you that prayer is not a position of your body it's not a position that you're in I believe that we kneel down and that's good but you know what I've been driving in my car and I've prayed I've been standing and I've prayed I was sitting in that chair right there not 5 minutes ago and I was praying prayer is not the position of your body it's the condition of your heart you know we're told to pray without ceasing to pray always well we can't function if we have to be down our knees right all the time it's because if you catch just that little it's it's not complicated just that little revelation of Lord I always want to be seeking what you want in every single thing I do even if it's just Lord Lord help me you know that's a prayer now I know what prayers have been turned into these these these these kind of speeches that we do that have big words and that have tone of voice that's not a prayer to God God wants a heart that is hungry he wants a heart that's not just hungry that calls out to him in desperation and and to God it doesn't matter how dirty that heart is when I tell you the condition of the heart matters I think sometimes we in my mind I think okay well I better clean up that heart so that heart can be in the condition to receive God that's not the condition I'm talking about it just needs to be surrendered you know you can be dirty and surrendered and God will come in and no but but I know what Satan does he says no you need to be clean and surrendered well then why do you need the Holy Ghost why do you need the Holy Ghost if I can get cleaned up without the Holy Ghost and in the Scripture it says if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous man and how many would just say I I don't know if I've been faithful in everything Lord I think I've been unfaithful in a few things he's telling you that if you have that it's not too late and really what the scripture says to me I I want to read one more scripture over in Deuteronomy but it tells me that a decision has to be made and for you maybe I I don't know everybody here um I don't know how long that you this might be your first service you ever been in church and this might be your uh might be your 3,000 service I don't know I don't know where you're at I don't know where everybody's at but I know that this morning a decision lays before you today amen whether you're a veteran of the Gospel or whether you just came in right now a decision lays before you this morning who are you going to serve and it doesn't matter what you decided yesterday that's good it doesn't matter what you decided to serve yesterday today you have to decide who you're going to serve amen and I'll tell you why that's the case and you you might think well it does matter it does matter who I decided because I can tell you this that there were days that I decided not to serve the Lord and they don't matter there were times yesterday there were times years ago there were times months ago weeks ago days ago where I made the wrong decision and guess what today it doesn't matter and I want to say the same thing if you say you know what I decided that I would serve the Lord yesterday that's good but today that doesn't matter today you have a new decision that lays before you it's a daily decision let's go over to Deuteronomy verse 30 I had two scriptures written down brother Dan so I'm going to use them both up right now and then we're going to we're really going to be in for it just Deuteronomy 30:1 it says it's a little bit of a I got a few verses if that's okay just reading the Bible for this commandment which I command thee when just a simple Bible reading it's I'm not making this up this day you you say well this was spoken way back in in in Moses's time yes but the Bible to me is a Bible of today and so when I read this I need to read this the right way it says for this commandment which I have commanded me this day it is not hidden from thee neither it is far off what does that mean this is not a mystery this is not something that he's going to he's going to ask you that's hard to understand it's not something that you need I'm just going to say this you don't need me up here explaining it to you you don't need a minister up here explaining to you that God is is plain and clear in the word what he's about to tell you this commandment is it is not in heaven that thou should say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it it's not you know I I I think maybe sometimes I do this you know I I make something in the in the in the in the word so mysterious that well I'll believe that as soon as it's explained to me the right way anybody ever thought that maybe not that maybe not that flippantly but you know you know I just really don't understand that so I don't know what to do with that as soon Lord as soon as I I understand that I'm going to believe that or if you can explain it to me but he's saying this is not that type of commandment he's going to give you it's real plain it's real clear and you have a clear when I when I tell you that you have a decision to make today it's going to be the clearest decision possible that you can make neither is it beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word this is I want to tell you this is the same word that Cornelius heard in that chapter of Acts when the Holy Ghost fell upon him it's that same word to those who heard the word the word is very nigh unto thee it's right here it's right here this morning in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it and this scripture it says I have set before you this day life and good and death and evil seems like a pretty black and white decision doesn't it I mean if we were to be honest that's pretty easy okay we could do a we could do an instant survey right now how many thinks it's it's the right thing to choose death and evil raise your hand awesome that was an easy one so it's an easy decision right if I mean we can't brother Dan if we asked where we're going to go to for lunch we wouldn't get that type of agreement and now we're talking about one of the most important decisions that we make and I think we had 100% agreement you don't find that anywhere right is right you don't find that anywhere 100% agreement and yet you all just agreed with that it's so clear and yet when I find in the Bible that When God says that you cannot serve two masters he's not talk if it wasn't possible for you to do that it wouldn't be in the Bible the reason why it's in the Bible is because it is possible for us to serve two Master it's possible for us to to to serve Mammon over God you know it's possible and sometimes I don't want to use the word likely but sometimes it's easy for us to actually choose death and evil even though we wouldn't raise our hand and I didn't raise my hand and yet I I can't even tell you how many times I've chosen death and evil over life and good even though it's a clear-cut decision and it's easy and I hope that you I hope that you're staying with me on this that I'm not trying to just make something out of nothing with these scriptures but I think sometimes we just read right over the scripture and don't realize that inside of that scripture is so much there's so much inside of there he says I have commanded you this day to love the Lord thy God if God has to command you to do something then there's a possibility that you won't do it if you just if you just did it naturally then there was no need for him to command you to do it but God has commanded Ed you to love the Lord thy God and to walk in his ways which means there's a possibility and a likely possibility of you not walking in his ways to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply notice I want to go back to this verse 15 he says I've set before you life and death and I'm sorry life and good and death and evil I don't want to misquote the Bible life and good and death and evil I don't see anywhere in that scripture okay let's do the opposite survey how many choose life and good there were some people that are in between I don't even know what you're choosing right now you didn't choose the first one but maybe okay but it was most everybody okay I don't see anywhere in the scripture where it says easy in fact I'll tell you right now that the easy path is the path to death and evil so now you have have another decision do I choose the hard path or do I choose the easy path wow and and and I I know what I know I'd get hands if I ask you this but how many has chosen the easy path but today that doesn't matter anymore because I serve a God who knows my name I serve a God who knows not the decisions I make that are wrong but he knows the person that's making them and he loves the person that's making them if you have kids have your have your children ever made a wrong decision I should hear some amens on that do you still love them why CU they're yours right and you could even go man they chose the path of of death they chose the path of evil they've made mistakes they've done wrong they turned their back on God they've rejected God I I know I'm speaking to real people I know we have issues like this they've said God isn't real they said he isn't who you say he is there's nothing to that Bible there's nothing to the message there's nothing to what you believe but today that doesn't matter anymore because they belong to you and if you know their name and go and God knows your name it's not a grandchild no it's that a token of a holy ghost has been applied to them and if you choose a path of good and life God there's an effect that happens there's a benefit to the believer's life and the benefit just like if you make good decisions in your household your children Prosper off of those good decisions right just like if you make a bad decision your children will suffer because of your bad decisions even though they didn't make them but if you decide if you make a good decision today it has benefits to your household and you say well you know what I I made a bunch of wrong decisions and now my children don't serve the Lord but today that doesn't matter anymore because today you have a decision that lays before you a new decision today not only who are you going to serve but who's going to die and guess who has to die today right here the same one deciding is the same this is why I could get a survey that has aund 120 people maybe 150 people here all in agreement and yet we'll walk out those doors and we'll struggle with it and you know why because in order to choose life and death this person has to die not once when you gave your heart to the Lord today you say I woke up in a good mood I woke up praying I woke up singing but today you got to take can every I I'm not much for participation or forcing you to do something so you don't have to but every just point at this person right here you got to take this person out and kill it and I tell you why because this person is the Mammon in that scripture this person is the other master that you serve now I know sometimes we go no that's the devil that's Satan that's this and that Satan has no power except the power that you give him you know that he can't force you to do a single thing he can't make you do something the devil made me do it the devil can't make you do a single thing you have to allow him to have governance of your life amen you have to allow him that so really the god I want to tell you this the god that comes up against the real God is this God and you say well I'm not a God I I don't think I'm a God but sometimes we act like we're God we act like what we think matters most of all that what I want and what I feel and what I think is the most important thing you know the definition of a God that's what that is and what he saying in the scriptures he's saying you cannot serve God and yourself at the same time so then now a decision lays before you will I serve myself or will I serve God now I don't know of a single person I bet you I could do another hand raise I don't know of a single person that would go I want to serve myself today just like nobody would choose the path of sin and death and evil and yet it's a struggle right yet we have a battle before us because the flesh wants what the flesh wants right right I mean just tell yourself hey I'm not gonna I'm not going to eat and then the stomach goes to rumbling a little bit right try telling your stomach no it's hard how much more when the flesh pulls on you when maybe it's not even bad right maybe it's just a thought about somebody but that thought if it's evil is not of God and if that thought is evil and it's not of God then there's someone else making decisions you know um it's really it's time to stop playing games it's time to stop playing church it's stop to it's time to stop playing church I you know there's there's a there's an expression in and it's a little bit crude but I'm going to use it this expression is called Allin you know it's it's from poker I hate to use that expression but you know it's in other things too but but it just fits you know there's some things that you can only do if you're Allin but I don't know for years and years I've done this years and years I wonder if we've served the Lord if we've served him just giv a little bit at a time but not everything right just give a little bit at a time I'm Gonna Keep some back because there's more there's more to this serving thing instead of just being Allin Lord I believe you and I believe that you're good I I do have a quote that I had um I'll flip to it and because it wasn't for I just had it on the side he says you know uh people brother R says this people let him in talking about the Lord now and say I'll let him be my savior but they won't let him be Lord why because they're not all in Come Into My Heart Lord oh he says they won't let him be Lord Lord means ownership rulership and if anything in the world is telling you right now don't be owned don't be ruled don't be a slave don't be oppressed okay but yet we let our work oppress us and own us we let our mind oppress us and own us right we let the desire of the flesh oppress us and own us and yet when it comes time for God to have ownership oh well we don't want to really be owned by anything I want to be free I thought I was supposed to be free when I became a Christian I became free as a Christian I became free from sin and death when I chose goodness and life right but it wasn't me that chose that it was something inside of me that chose that because if this guy had a decision to make it would be wrong if this I'm going to say if this God and you have one made a decision it would be the wrong decision this God has to be taken out and it has to be killed so that the real God can come in and then you're free but I've made a choice now you know what I've done this is it's it's a paradox I've made a choice with my freedom you know what I've chosen with my free choice to be a prisoner I wasn't hauled away in Chains into jail against my will no it's with my own will I've chosen to be a prisoner of God and I'm telling you being a prisoner of God feels way different brother Daniel when you choose it how many likes being drugged to church you don't even have don't raise your hand on that one right the kids just came back from Sunday school nobody likes being drugged to Church why because you're a prisoner of God against your own will and you know I don't that's when I tell you it's time to stop playing church I do not go to church because I have to I I'll tell you this I don't even go to church because the Bible and the message tell me to do it I I know it might get a little bit I got a it might get a little bit quiet now if you don't have a revelation do it because the Bible tells you to do it right but there's nothing like when you do it because you want to do it when you have been freed to make the choice to chain yourself to God I go to church I come down here I don't want I'm telling you right now I'm just we're just G to be honest this morning I don't want to stand before you and preach I don't I want to come down here Brother Dan Brother Aaron one of the other brothers I it it refills me and I don't have to stand up here before you preach to you but I've chained myself to God and I love it so much that if he says go to church if he says go to Tucson if he says go to the other side of the world if he says sit down and do nothing I'm happy to do it because with my freedom I've chose to be a prisoner it's it it sounds good but it's it's not easy because tomorrow that decision won't matter tomorrow I got to decide again who do I want to be a prisoner of tomorrow I'm just as free do I decide to be a prisoner of Christ or a prisoner of this God and I I I I I just say that that way and I hope you I hope you catch what I'm trying to say I hope you really see what's on my heart I really really hate to keep blaming the devil now I know the devil is wrong I know that Satan is there I know Lucifer is a real being I I know that but I I really hate to keep giving him credit for things I decided to do and and sometimes he becomes the scapegoat well the devil made me do it well the devil caused me to do this you know what I just didn't have the right decision and he becomes the person or he becomes the guilty one and the real problem lies right here and if that if I put all the blame on him and certainly does he have influence over our life certainly he has influence over our life but none that I don't give him none that I don't give him you say well no wait a minute what do you mean I I mean there's things out there on the on the internet and and uh you know it's just is what it is yeah but you don't have to have the internet well you don't understand brother I got a business around I got I you know just I got family I got to keep in touch with and you know they're trying to get a hold of me I've heard the excuse I've heard the excuse why we have to have this in church when I hear the ringers going off I'm just going to you may not like it but I'm just going to say it mine's gone off too so I'm preaching myself you know what the response was oh well I got family they may need to get a hold of me and I have to have my phone well what did you do before the cell phone the family got a hold of you somehow well there could be you know I got somebody in the hospital and they're sick it always used to be that way and yet we came to church I'm not preaching against technology I'm preaching against that the devil has no influence over you except the one that you give him so if I give him if I accept the phone then I accept things that come with the phone right if I accept the internet then I accept the things that come with the internet if I can't handle those things I need to reject the internet I'm sorry just to say it plain black and white but if your right hand offends you cut it off and it's better to enter into the kingdom of heaven with no arm I'm sorry it's better to be a Christian with no internet wow than it is to to to sit in the Kingdom of hell with your cell phone and all of your all the access that it gives you that's just as plain as I can make it and I'm preaching to myself I'd rather enter into heaven with no arm and no leg and no eyeball if that's what it takes if I got to take it out I'd rather enter in that way because if I enter in that way he's able to restore me he's able to restore what I had to decide to get rid of in order to be all in I wonder if we really are all in if we're not willing to give up everything now now okay now when you leave from here and you say and brother Dan if you get if you get somebody calling you now brother Ryan said I had to give up my phone I had to give up the internet or I wasn't going to go to heaven that's not what I'm telling you I'm telling you that if you are being influenced by it you have a decision that lays before you if you continue if I continue to be influenced I've made my decision and it doesn't matter if I didn't raise my hand for death and evil you know what I've done I choose death and evil that's what I've done wow if I continue to let influence have power in my life he says a lord means ownership rulership he says in quotations Come Into My Heart Lord and save me from hell but don't tell me what to do that's the attitude of the people I listened to this testimony and I hope it's okay to tell this testimony it's not of a it's of a I don't even know if the Man's Alive anymore but it was a a a denominational preacher you probably have heard it's on the internet that internet I was just talking about and he gave this testimony you know I'm a little bit cautious when I when I take anything that's not really been Vindicated by God himself I listened to this testimony and brother and it there was a there was a that certain sound to it now I didn't hear the whole thing I heard about I heard about 10 minutes of it but this man had a he had a life um he almost died I can't remember if it was a heart attack or what had happened to him but he's he's on the way to the hospital and he's like in a coma and he says when he woke up he says he actually went to what he he didn't know if it was a dream or what was happening again the basis of the of the testimony is not important it was what he said he said he stood before the Gates of Heaven and they asked him and he said a voice came and he said he knew it was the Lord he said he couldn't even move and the Lord asked him if he thought he deserved to go in and he said uh yes Lord I believe that I do and the Lord said make your case and he said said well I've been a preacher for 30 40 years he goes I started to tell him about all the preaching that I've done he said he started to tell him about all the souls that he had won to Christ that he genuinely said he had won to Christ he had been a missionary he had been he had done charity work where he fed thousands and thousands of people brought the word to them preach he saids I never I never didn't he didn't say he didn't do anything wrong he says but you know since the Lord changed me I've not I've not strayed away from this and this is what The Voice came back and told him he says all those things you did for yourself and he said he started to get almost almost h a little bit not angry but kind of like wait a minute Lord no I did those for you you are I did those for you you are the Lord and this is what the Lord told him in this video he said you call me Lord but you've never made me your lord you call me your ruler your owner but he says you've never made me your owner and he says right when he heard those words he realized it was true he says you couldn't argue with it and he knew he deserved to go to hell and he says he was he he just broke down and the angels came to him and said we're going to take you before him one more time make your case and they brought him before the voice and he said Lord I don't deserve to go to heaven I deserve exactly the Judgment that you said I deserved you're right I did it for me because he goes I didn't think at the time but when I look back I didn't make you ruler I didn't make you owner and he says then the Lord started to talk to him softly gently then he said the Lord treated him like he was his child not when he came to him with all that what he done because I think when we do that maybe when I do that it's trying to present to the Lord somebody worthy when that is just lifting up Mammon it's lifting up and really that word we you could read throughout the message in the Bible that word means it does mean the world but it also means wealth it also means riches and it also means Security in your own riches and if you go to the Lord and you present to him that you are secure in yourself he can't accept that because you have chosen to serve a different God you know even in the Bible that the Jesus says that you must be now this is just this is like the basis of of what we believe Jesus says You must be baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost and then by the by by in the message we learn okay over here in Acts 238 that Peter says repent and be baptized in the name of it does not say Lord Jesus Christ it says Jesus Christ and yet when we read in the message and we read and we hear preaching it's that the father Son and Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ and you say well it takes a revelation to know that it's because Jesus Christ is there and you can say you know what I accept him as Jesus Christ he's good he died for me brother Aaron he did all these things for me but that doesn't mean you've made him Lord yet in order to really fulfill what Jesus is saying back here in baptism and really fulfill what is over here in Acts 238 you have to take Jesus Christ and make him your lord and the only way you can make him your lord is if your current Lord dies and you cannot tell me oh I'm here neutral I don't have a lord you have a lord right now in your seat right now you have a lord you decide which one it is now if you walked in and I I can just tell you this if you walked in and you had chose the wrong one that doesn't matter right now amen that old Lord that you chose maybe it was this one right here that can die right now this morning and the Lord can come in and take ownership now I'm not trying to pep you up I'm not trying to get you riled I'm telling you that I I believe there's so many people that have just woke up and maybe they were good yesterday or the day before they were good a month ago when the Lord did something for them but maybe you woke up today and you chose the wrong thing and you didn't even know it if you don't choose God you've chosen already a different Lord I'll put it that way you can't walk through the day neutral and go I'm going to see what happens to me today Daniel I'm gonna see what happens to me today and then I'll know if it was a good day or not you wake up and you choose what you want you choose the influence that you want over here there's a there's a there's a quote I think you might have referenced this last time I was here brother Dan what we were talking about I don't to read it anyways if that's okay he's talking about Le Levi this is the uh great grandson of Abraham he says when Abraham paid tith es unto MDC that his great grandson who wasn't even born yet those ties were counted to him which means when Abraham paid ties Levi got the benefits of that and I want to tell you this too that works the other way there's been Generations sometimes in families of sin and and and men and women turning from the Lord and their children their great-grandchildren their grandchildren have a negative effect because of it it's in the Bible but God doesn't care if there is a willing heart that's willing to accept him as Lord yeah I know that so is so basic and simple but he can take generational decisions of sin and evil like we saw on that scripture and wipe it away in a moment he can even take your lifetime whether you're 15 years old 18 years old 30 years old 40 years old doesn't matter your lifetime of deciding wrong things and wipe it out right now and it says and you don't have to take my word for it now let's just go back to the word he says that's predestination here comes into perfect view predestination God's Own thinking God the great spirit spirit in the beginning he was God did you know I want to ask you the same question he's asking did you know that you were in him then okay so if you know it it's good if you don't know it that's what I'm talking about this morning if you know that there's peace right how many knows that and still does something wrong right but there's peace knowing I can come back to you I can come under the shed blood of your son and I can take this old God out to the field and slay him and if you don't know him that way it's so simple and easy to know him that way you are a Christian now if you are a Christian now you were in him then and then if that be so the whole godhead bodily shaped up into the person of Jesus Christ and then this is so good this is good for me when he talking about Jesus when Jesus died on the cross I died with him there were two Gods hanging on that cross I know that sounds W that sounds like some weird Doctrine two Gods brother that I hung with him and this God died this master died this Lord died with him when Jesus died at the cross I died with him for I was in him then he was the fullness of the word manifested we we were we now he says we how many would how many would join in that we all right we got a few we were at Calvary with him we went into the grave with him and we were raised with him and his resurrection and now we've ascended by his Spirit to the throne of grace sitting together in Heavenly places and when the entire word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ I love this now in there God made me pay for my sins you got to pay for your sins only if you claim listen you can pay for them now yes or you can pay for them later what do you decide the decision lays before you you said I made that decision 20 years ago brother the decision lays before you today Paul says I Die daily why would there be a need to Die daily because every day this Lord has to be taken out and killed every single day I have to decide who is going to be my God every day I have to decide that and this is like the base this is such a basic message but I hope that I really can just get across to you that there is a decision that lays before you even right now you could you could you could decide this morning that was okay that was good that was for somebody but that wasn't for me and I'm not going to sit here and tell you you're were wrong but a decision lays before you even right now because whenever the word comes forth a decision comes with it amen whenever the word is preached you know even in brother Dan's testimony you know brother brandham was telling a testimony to Sister Hatty wght he was just telling a testimony and right when he told the testimony guess what happened a decision came before her just by a testimony all of a sudden before this sister came a testimony what are you going to say and she says that's the truth so even a testimony coming out when I say even a testimony like it's a small thing it's so good what the Lord does for us when a testimony comes forth a decision lays before you are you going to believe it or you going to reject it you say you know what that was good for you brother Dan that was great or you're going to accept it and then all of a sudden you feel that same exact prayer come and start to come into your life somebody praying for you you know there might be somebody praying for you but the decisions that you've made keep that prayer from getting to you you ever think about that you might have a mom and dad you might have a brother or a sister who's praying for you but you continue to reject the prayer I don't think that we're malicious I don't think we do that out of it's just choosing this flesh it's choosing what this person wants and I I really do believe that two two Gods two Lords hung on that cross that day I was in him I can't put you there that's your decision right I was a captive to alcohol to lust to filth to music to pleasures of the world and I'm not a captive to those things anymore do I still have a decision oh yeah every day I got to make a decision do I want to be captive again do I want to make them my Lord again or do I use my freedom to choose to be captive of God Amen and I know this when I serve one of those Gods I know I know it's just so sometimes it seems so silly we don't look at ourselves really and think that we're a God but who are we serving and I tell you who you serve is your god do I serve this flesh do I serve this mind do I serve what this what this guy wants do you do that and I tell you when I serve one of these two Gods one gives me happiness brother Daniel when I serve myself I'm not I'm not going to lie I get happy I get happy we don't serve oursel and go do something we don't like to do right we go we serve oursel in something we want to do and there's happiness but the happiness Fades what's left in its place shame disappointment regret oh Lord just give me a chance to make that decision again right give me a chance to make that decision again and then sometimes he gives us a chance the very next day we decide to serve this guy again and it's happiness but when I serve the other one there's joy you know the difference there's a big difference between that it means when I'm down when I'm when I'm when I'm in shame when I'm in when I'm doing what I shouldn't be doing there's a joy that says you know what my father he's got a mansion and his servants eat better than I eat right now you know all I have to do is go back and tell them I'm sorry all I have to do is go back and say Lord I made a mistake I'm wrong and he'll receive me gladly and there's a joy in that or you could have some temporary relief or you can have some peace right you could have you know you could even have some healing of the body or you can have a healing of your soul I just wonder which God that we spend the most time worshiping and serving because really he wants to be your Lord God is not this I don't believe God is just this being that's just out there in the universe I believe I I really do believe that he sits right next to you and that he wants you to choose him to be your lord and and really ownership by the Lord is the most freeing thing you could ever choose and you get to do you know it's even in the message he said you know well you get to do whatever you want and brother Ram saids I always do whatever I want because what he changes is what I want that's why I tell you I don't I don't come to church I don't Worship the Lord because I have to I do it because I want to do it do I make mistakes uh uh probably more than but then all of you combined I make mistakes but I have to get up I have to take this person out I have to kill it say Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry I let this man have lordship over me even if it's for a minute it's got to go out and it's got to die I'll read one more thing and I think we'll close uh he says here I want to be dead Earnest when he speaks to me I just I can just say what he showed me whether it's good or bad I have to say it this isn't a a message of everybody jumping and shouting sometime maybe even might maybe it didn't even sound good but he says it's good or bad I have to say it and sometimes it's not pleasant to tell people those things but yet I'm just as Duty bound to tell the evil things that will befall them as I am Duty bound to tell them the good things that will befall them and after all we want the will of the Lord right which Lord which Lord Jesus Christ he's Jesus Christ but he's the Lord Jesus Christ after all we want the will of the Lord and oh this you should agree with this statement sometimes the will of the Lord is contrary to our desires right but still if we want the will of the lord it's just as precious listen now it's just as precious if this could if anything could encourage you this morning it's just as precious to know that the evil will befall us if it's the will of the Lord because you don't care what happens to you you don't care if it's good you don't care if it's bad you've chosen him as Lord you've chosen him as ownership and everything you know everything that happens to you is good if you chose the Lord there's a man who says even if the Lord slays me I'll trust in him that was somebody who decided even though I'm on the ash Heap even though I lost my children my family my riches my household my wife my health his will is still the right will his ownership is still better than my own ownership and even if he takes my life I we can make this statement casually but I'm telling you this morning a decision lays before you you got to be you have to decide is this what you you believe are you willing to to rest your Eternal destination on this word that's the decision that really lays before you this morning and and I'll tell you this he says this I'll finish this it's just as precious to know that evil will be followed us if it's the will of the Lord whether it be good or evil it's the will of the Lord that we want done and I I've made a decision now I've made M I'm I've made mistakes I hope I don't continue to make mistakes but I've made a decision that if I'm all in I'm all in if the God that I serve is not God if Jesus Christ was just another man and it turns out that Muhammad was the one or this other one was the it was the right one I've chosen Jesus Christ and if Jesus Christ is false and he sent to whatever hell that there is is I've chosen to go there with Jesus Christ I'm all in there's no turning back if if if this word and this message is false I've chosen it and I'm all in I'm all in I cannot be unconvinced I cannot I can't be I've the Lord's done too much for me whatever Lord has done something for me he is God he is my God and he's done so much for me I I've seen what I was and I'm not that person anymore and there's no possible way that this God could have made that change I've tried I don't know how many of you have tried you ever tried to make yourself change that's this God trying to make change and it doesn't work but I've met the God and if that God is false I go wherever he goes if he's not the true God I go exactly where that's I'm all in because Jesus Christ is my Lord he is my Lord if if he slay me he's good if I'm suffering he's good am when I'm down when I'm depressed when I'm you know discouraged he's good when I have family members that are sick he's good when I have family members that are not serving the lord he's good am when I when I have family members that die church members that die he's still good when I don't know what I'm doing he's good when I don't know where I belong he's good when I I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow to get through the day he's good it's not just when things are going good it's he's good because I've made him my Lord not because not because I'm good it's because he's good he does not want he does not want people to serve him because they have to serve him neither do you want somebody to love you because they have to love you right what kind of marriage would you have with your spouse if your spouse says I love you because I have to I mean I really don't want to but I know it's the right thing that's not a love and God doesn't want that kind of love either a decision he's placed his decision before you today and you say well I I I think I've made that decision just examine today have you made that decision yes I I'm not trying to preach some some you know some Baptist Doctrine this is real and and I'm telling you you might have woke up today and made the wrong one but it doesn't matter because the decision lays before you right now you can take that God out and kill him and I think I'm gonna leave it there brother Dan I I really hope that you know that this came from my heart that I didn't have on my mind what to talk to you about that I you write down scriptures you write down quotes but I I I just want to I want to encourage you this morning we hear so much about what's going wrong we hear so much about all the bad in the world but I get peace in knowing that if I just turn to him like he says to Israel you've sinned against me you've gone after Egypt you've gone after riches you've gone after spoils you've gone after Mammon but if you just turn and look at me I'll restore you that's what I want to do this morning Amen brother Dan if you want to come [Applause] I think next time brother Ryan speaks for us when he walks up to the pulpit I'm going to say I'll take your notes do you appreciate that this morning when um brother Ryan talked about two Gods there's another word for a god it's very very often found in the Bible and and a lot of times they're they're used synonymously with each other and that's the word Idol and you can you can make yourself an idol you can make your wants an idol and our brother our brother told us that today and there has to be a death you have to die it's what baptism is all about you have to die you have to go into the grave and you have to raise up a new person that the old man is dead I really appreciated what brother Ryan was saying about um about being Allin if there's something that I want in my life it's to be Allin Lord I don't want to be a Halfway Christian Lord I want to be Allin I want I want to live my life for you I want to I want to stand for you I don't want to just be a Christian in 90% of my life but then in 10% not be a Christian brother Ryan said that he said what you do today he said this day he said that was yesterday many of us have have said that I wish I would have raised my children different I wish I would have done this different I would I wish I would have done that different Lord I I just wish I would have been different but the question is what will you do this day will you be all in it's a question brothers and sisters and I think that it's a it's a question that that needs to be answered today will you be all in what will you do this day yesterday's yesterday but what will you do this [Music] day Joshua said [Music] this he said and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord if it seems wrong to you to serve the Lord they were caught between two Gods here they were caught between the idol of the world and they were caught between this God of the old this Jehovah of the Old Testament which we believe is Jesus Christ they were caught between two gods and Joshua and the Lord says through Joshua he says choose this day whom you will serve [Music] whether the gods which are your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood of the god of the amorites in whose land you dwell Joshua was saying choose this day he says choose this day who you will serve and he says but but I've I've failed my family I've failed my children I've failed all of these things but choose this day who you will serve and it says this the very next sentence Joshua says this but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord not we served him behind but we will serve the Lord choose this day who you will serve and Joshua said as far as me in my house not that I haven't raised him right not that I made made mistakes but from now on we will serve the Lord as far as me in my house let's all stand lead me Lord I Will Follow Me Lord I will go you have called me I will [Applause] answer leave me Al I will go leave me Lord I will follow leave you Lord I will go you have called me I will answer leave me Lord I will brothers and sisters I believe brother Ryan I believe he was influenced by the Lord by the Holy Spirit to encourage us to make a decision in our lives like you said I don't care if you made this decision yesterday I don't care if you made it 10 years ago I don't care if you made it when you were 12 years old when you were or or when you were 20 years old and you were filled with the Holy Spirit I don't that's not what I'm talking about choose this day who you will serve choose this day show of hands will you make a decision today that you will choose this day to be Allin will you choose this day to be all in I raise my hand in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I choose this day I'm all in I'm serving I'm serving God he is good let's bow our heads head Heavenly Father you saw the [Music] hands Lord I pray that they're sincere father I think about your word and I I think about all of of these stories that are in the Bible of of people that truly chose and our brother mentioned Cornelius the Gentile Centurion Peter gave him a testimony of what what God had done in this man Jesus Christ and he made the right choice and and he was filled with the Holy Spirit even before he was baptized he was filled father I choose this day once again I choose Jesus Christ as we said last week I vote for Jesus Christ today we love you Lord we thank you for this time together Lord we thank you for all that are in the congregation and Lord may this decision that so many made with a raised hand Lord I pray it would be real and Lord bring it back to our remembrance when the enemy tempts us the things of evil or evil thoughts whatever it might be Lord bring to remembrance I raised my hand that Sunday morning that I choose this day I choose Jesus Christ bring it to our remembrance Lord when we go to battle I pray
