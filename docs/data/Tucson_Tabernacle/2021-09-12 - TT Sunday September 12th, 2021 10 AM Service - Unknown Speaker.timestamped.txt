[38:48] lord help us to recognize your presence
[38:51] as we spoke last sunday
[38:53] job said
[38:55] but i perceive him not
[38:58] the great the one we sang about we came
[39:00] down from his glory
[39:02] oh how i love him
[39:04] yet sometimes we perceive him not
[39:07] but he said i'll be in the midst of you
[39:09] and he keeps his word so
[39:11] i appreciate that we have some prayer
[39:13] requests
[39:15] some praise and some announcements to
[39:17] make so
[39:19] let's remember bethany carey how
[39:22] she's not feeling well with headache and
[39:24] nauseous
[39:25] i believe that says maybe
[39:28] put these on it might help
[39:30] and some nausea so let's remember our
[39:32] sister bethany
[39:34] brother ed dougal let me know yesterday
[39:37] and also this morning both him and
[39:40] sister kathy were not feeling well
[39:42] brother ed is having been having some
[39:44] low back problems and they were both
[39:47] feeling like they had a cold or
[39:48] something so
[39:49] remember
[39:50] and sister joyce dougal
[39:53] left me saying she was not feeling well
[39:55] this morning either
[39:57] i remember my daughter sarah
[40:00] the
[40:02] the newport and
[40:04] that they put in the things that they
[40:06] did it working very well but she's
[40:08] having a reaction to something that's
[40:10] causing her body to itch quite a bit so
[40:13] she's had to take some medication that
[40:15] leaves her very drowsy so she doesn't
[40:17] feel that way so but just remember her
[40:21] brother robert figueroa called me um
[40:25] i guess it would have been tuesday
[40:27] i believe it was
[40:29] and the covet has hit the church there
[40:31] with brother robert there was five
[40:33] of the congregation including his
[40:35] daughter and granddaughter who tested
[40:38] positive with cobit
[40:39] brother robert and sister delia had
[40:42] themselves tested and they were fine
[40:44] but they've had to close the church down
[40:45] because there's there's only about 10
[40:47] people in the church so
[40:49] he just requested
[40:50] prayer and then my wife requests prayer
[40:53] for her sister elizabeth
[40:56] she's not been feeling well for the last
[40:58] few days and so would
[41:00] remember her in prayer
[41:03] i got the text from brother matthew
[41:05] watkins this morning that their
[41:07] results came back negative
[41:10] but they were both not feeling very well
[41:12] still but the church had some positive
[41:15] results in the in the congregation so
[41:18] that's the reason why brother matt is
[41:19] not here he could not travel couldn't
[41:21] get on an airplane until without the
[41:22] results
[41:23] so um lord willing everything works well
[41:26] he'll be here this coming weekend
[41:28] we put the announcement on whatsapp and
[41:30] i know not everybody has it but
[41:32] they are so
[41:34] and
[41:35] i went to the doctor on
[41:37] thursday the surgeon
[41:39] and the
[41:40] surgeon said it has healed very
[41:43] very well the
[41:44] infection is gone the fever is gone but
[41:48] she said it would be better to do the
[41:50] surgery in the hospital than in her
[41:52] office there's

[50:24] god bless you this morning like to
[50:27] greet you in the name of the lord jesus
[50:29] on this beautiful
[50:31] resurrection morning
[50:38] so sweet to know that
[50:41] that's what we've come to do is to honor
[50:44] his resurrection and
[50:46] not only to honor it but
[50:49] to believe in it and to know that that's
[50:53] our hope
[50:55] is in what he can do
[51:00] not what we can do but
[51:03] what he can do and
[51:05] and to come with us inside sincere heart
[51:10] believing that the lord's
[51:12] every bit is able this morning to do
[51:15] miracles
[51:17] to do miracles in our heart in our life
[51:20] in our body
[51:24] that he's
[51:25] every bit the same that he
[51:28] always has been
[51:31] and it's in that
[51:33] knowledge and faith and trust in him
[51:35] that we approach his word this morning
[51:37] and
[51:40] knowing that it's a very sacred thing
[51:42] and
[51:43] jesus when he was on earth he said my
[51:46] words are spirit and life
[51:51] and we that are believers we've
[51:54] seen that supernatural thing that is his
[51:58] word works in your life it's
[52:00] kind of a paradox that
[52:03] god works and so as we approach his word
[52:05] this morning i'd like to tell you how
[52:08] honored we are to be here and
[52:11] to be with you and to worship the lord
[52:14] with you and
[52:15] just a great honor and privilege so
[52:18] if you'd like to
[52:20] turn with me while you're standing
[52:24] in the book of john
[52:26] the sixth chapter
[52:32] and the 65th
[52:35] verse
[52:40] i'd like to thank our
[52:42] musicians just so much appreciate that
[52:52] jesus speaking in john the 6th
[52:57] chapter in the 65th verse
[53:01] therefore said i unto you
[53:04] no man can come unto me
[53:06] except it were given unto him of my
[53:09] father
[53:11] from that time many of his disciples
[53:14] went back and
[53:16] walked no more with him
[53:21] then said jesus unto the twelve
[53:24] will ye also
[53:26] go away
[53:28] then simon peter answered him
[53:31] lord
[53:33] to whom shall we go
[53:36] thou hast the words
[53:39] of eternal life
[53:44] i'd like to turn also in the book of
[53:47] judges
[53:49] in the 11th chapter
[54:04] the 11th chapter of the book of judges
[54:11] and verse 34
[54:17] and japheth came
[54:19] to mispa
[54:21] unto his house and
[54:23] behold his daughter came out to meet him
[54:26] with timbrels and with dances
[54:30] and she was his only child and
[54:33] beside her
[54:35] he had neither son
[54:37] nor daughter
[54:41] and it came to pass
[54:43] when he saw her
[54:45] that he rent his clothes
[54:48] and said alas my daughter
[54:51] thou has brought me very low
[54:55] and thou
[54:57] and thou art one of them that trouble me
[55:01] for i have opened my mouth unto the lord
[55:06] and i cannot
[55:08] go back
[55:10] let's bow our heads
[55:14] dear lord jesus
[55:17] where can we go
[55:20] where can we go for healing
[55:23] where can we go for forgiveness where
[55:26] what what pool
[55:30] where could we go to wash ourselves from
[55:32] our sins and iniquity
[55:36] lord we have no place to go
[55:39] this morning but to you
[55:41] when we look for hell
[55:44] our help comes only from you
[55:47] man's help is vain and
[55:49] all these things of earth are
[55:51] fleeing and
[55:53] failing and fading away
[55:56] but our hope is in you this morning lord
[55:58] and
[55:59] we asked this morning lord that you
[56:01] would come and
[56:02] somehow lord
[56:04] despite ourselves lord that you'd come
[56:07] and get into your word and move in our
[56:10] hearts and
[56:12] change us lord work
[56:14] you're working in us because we belong
[56:16] to you we are yours lord we've given you
[56:19] our heart in our life
[56:21] now lord we ask that you'd come and
[56:24] minister to our hearts
[56:26] we're so
[56:28] needy of you lord we ask you to come in
[56:30] jesus name believing
[56:33] that we have what we ask
[56:35] because you said if we believe when we
[56:37] ask we shall have what we ask and we ask
[56:40] these things in jesus name amen amen god
[56:44] bless you this morning it's
[56:47] so wonderful to look to the word of god
[56:48] you may be seated
[56:58] the disciples
[57:01] were in a a place of necessity
[57:06] they had
[57:08] forsaken
[57:10] their religious life they had many of
[57:14] them forsaken their jobs or forsaken
[57:18] uh
[57:20] their business
[57:22] and
[57:22] maybe even some of their family and
[57:25] camaraderie to be
[57:27] identified with the lord jesus
[57:31] and when the lord
[57:35] oh it's off okay it's not on there very
[57:38] good
[57:40] i can try to change that
[57:43] i'm sorry saints
[57:45] for this little interruption
[57:50] uh
[57:58] okay is that a little
[58:03] that's good okay excuse me
[58:07] and they had
[58:09] identified with the lord jesus and then
[58:12] jesus began to say some very
[58:15] hard things
[58:18] about being the bread of life come down
[58:21] from heaven and
[58:22] he also said
[58:25] he spoke about eating his flesh and
[58:28] drinking his blood
[58:31] and
[58:32] some of those things as we are bible
[58:34] readers seem very
[58:36] strange to us and
[58:39] sometimes we
[58:40] we wonder you know what we should
[58:43] understand from that and
[58:47] in the
[58:49] days of the when the dark ages when the
[58:52] catholic church was the only
[58:54] church
[58:56] to be to go to and to attend they began
[58:59] to teach the people that
[59:01] the only way that you can do this is
[59:03] through the sacrament of communion
[59:07] and
[59:10] they taught these things you know that
[59:12] jesus said this
[59:14] but what they also taught was the way
[59:17] that you fulfill that
[59:21] of eating his flesh and drinking his
[59:23] blood is by
[59:25] partaking of the sacrament
[59:28] of communion
[59:30] and so they devised this ritual in which
[59:35] the priest
[59:38] would
[59:39] have the power the power that was given
[59:41] him by the pope or
[59:43] invested in him and they
[59:46] had a mass and at a certain point in the
[59:49] mass the priest holds up this
[59:52] little
[59:53] wafer
[59:54] and they call it the miracle of the mass
[59:57] and they call it the mystery of
[1:00:00] transubstantiation
[1:00:03] it's an awful big word and it's an awful
[1:00:05] big idea
[1:00:07] that
[1:00:08] by the power of the priest and if there
[1:00:10] be any catholics in here you'll know
[1:00:12] these things
[1:00:14] that that bread
[1:00:16] becomes literally the body of christ
[1:00:19] and the same he holds up the cup and it
[1:00:21] and and and you're to believe that that
[1:00:24] miracle actually happened and it happens
[1:00:27] in every mass and then when you come
[1:00:29] forward and the priest holds that little
[1:00:32] wafer out he says unto you body of
[1:00:34] christ you believe it's the body of
[1:00:36] christ and you say amen and they put it
[1:00:38] on your
[1:00:40] tongue
[1:00:43] uh and as every good catholic knows
[1:00:45] don't let it stick to the roof of your
[1:00:47] mouth
[1:00:48] because you'll never get it off until it
[1:00:51] dissolves
[1:00:56] but
[1:00:58] the word always interprets itself and
[1:01:01] after those
[1:01:03] dissertations that jesus said he said
[1:01:05] the words
[1:01:07] that i speak unto you he said the flesh
[1:01:11] profiteth nothing but the words that i
[1:01:15] speak unto you they are life so he makes
[1:01:18] these
[1:01:18] he
[1:01:19] he expresses to the people that i am the
[1:01:22] bread of god that came out of heaven
[1:01:24] and he expresses those things to the
[1:01:27] people and then he gives them a little
[1:01:30] inside way to understand that this is
[1:01:33] the partaking that
[1:01:35] you believe in him and you believe in
[1:01:39] his word and you take his
[1:01:43] word
[1:01:44] into your heart
[1:01:48] not into your intellect not into your
[1:01:50] mind but the
[1:01:51] the mind is is the womb to the soul
[1:01:55] that's why it's so tragic to give our
[1:01:57] minds over to
[1:02:00] unpure things and unprofitable things
[1:02:03] because this same
[1:02:05] womb of our mind is such a sacred
[1:02:07] betting ground for the things that god
[1:02:10] wants to do to us he brings it first to
[1:02:13] our mind and down into our hearts he
[1:02:15] brings it into our hearing sometimes
[1:02:17] somehow supernaturally he's brought you
[1:02:22] into the hearing of his word
[1:02:25] and maybe life becomes normal to you and
[1:02:28] it doesn't seem very supernatural but it
[1:02:30] really is
[1:02:31] look out in the world and see how many
[1:02:35] are truly
[1:02:37] born again and have given their hearts
[1:02:39] and lives to the lord jesus and are
[1:02:43] partaking of him and his word they're
[1:02:46] very few and so it's a very marvelous
[1:02:49] thing and a great miracle that you are
[1:02:51] believing today
[1:02:55] now
[1:02:58] paul
[1:03:00] in hebrews
[1:03:03] he took
[1:03:04] 10 chapters to explain
[1:03:08] what we are believing
[1:03:10] and one of the first things that he puts
[1:03:12] forth
[1:03:14] is that
[1:03:15] jesus
[1:03:17] became
[1:03:18] man
[1:03:19] and he
[1:03:20] explains the kind
[1:03:23] of man that jesus was and how god
[1:03:26] became man
[1:03:28] and
[1:03:30] he speaks of
[1:03:32] the son of man
[1:03:34] and
[1:03:34] by the
[1:03:36] if the
[1:03:37] by the lord's help i'd like to
[1:03:39] save that for this evening
[1:03:42] but it's that great mystery
[1:03:46] that paul in the first
[1:03:48] chapters of hebrews is talking about how
[1:03:50] that god became man
[1:03:54] to
[1:03:55] fulfill his word and to become a kinsman
[1:03:59] to become a high priest to become
[1:04:02] the the first son of many brethren to
[1:04:05] become
[1:04:08] what
[1:04:09] we are
[1:04:11] and the prophet of god said that he had
[1:04:13] to become
[1:04:15] what we are
[1:04:17] to know
[1:04:18] what it was
[1:04:20] to be tempted and to know what it was
[1:04:22] that we go through
[1:04:24] and and i think we've spoke on it before
[1:04:26] how that we would have maybe thought
[1:04:28] that god was omnipotent
[1:04:31] uh and knowing everything that
[1:04:35] he would just know because he's god he
[1:04:37] would know what we went through but
[1:04:40] isn't it marvelous that god
[1:04:42] would send a divine interpreter of his
[1:04:45] word to take us a little deeper than
[1:04:47] that and to say that he had to become
[1:04:50] one of us to really
[1:04:53] know
[1:04:54] what we're going through
[1:04:57] and these are things that are taken on
[1:05:00] by the heart
[1:05:02] these are things that touch your heart
[1:05:05] and that that pull you into faith
[1:05:09] by your affections for christ
[1:05:12] because of what he did for you
[1:05:16] and it's a marvelous thing that your
[1:05:18] when your heart
[1:05:20] is drawn into the realms of god and into
[1:05:24] the word of god
[1:05:26] it's a much greater thing
[1:05:29] than just looking and believing and
[1:05:31] saying well i can accept that
[1:05:33] i can believe that
[1:05:38] can you imagine if you fell in love with
[1:05:40] somebody
[1:05:42] and you tried to express to them that
[1:05:44] you know i love you i want to marry you
[1:05:48] and the person just kind of said yeah
[1:05:50] okay i can relate you know
[1:05:53] that's
[1:05:54] it's conceivable it's
[1:05:57] like you know okay
[1:05:59] so what
[1:06:01] i don't mean to make humor but but but
[1:06:05] but god
[1:06:07] put in us
[1:06:09] a love for him
[1:06:12] and for his word so that this could be a
[1:06:15] love affair
[1:06:18] then that love abiding in us
[1:06:21] is what makes us love our fellow man
[1:06:24] and it's not enough that
[1:06:26] we believe the truth we're not knocking
[1:06:28] on every door and saying join the church
[1:06:31] because we have the truth
[1:06:33] it's the sensible thing to do
[1:06:36] no we're saying
[1:06:38] do you know what it is to fall in love
[1:06:40] with god
[1:06:42] do you know the love of god do you know
[1:06:45] what that could do to you and and that
[1:06:47] burns in your heart and you see your
[1:06:49] fellow man and and compassion
[1:06:53] for your fellow man raises up in you
[1:06:56] and the love of god reaches out to that
[1:06:59] person and said oh
[1:07:02] if you could just know the lord
[1:07:05] what a deliverance you could have what a
[1:07:08] peace you could have what what healing
[1:07:10] you could have what what joy of being
[1:07:14] clean and free before god
[1:07:17] it's just as close as me standing to you
[1:07:21] my brother
[1:07:22] if you can receive it
[1:07:32] but sometimes
[1:07:34] the gospel
[1:07:35] the love of god in the word of god
[1:07:44] as we've heard it said many times that
[1:07:47] that the
[1:07:48] the thund the lightning and the thunder
[1:07:51] that's born out of jagged skies is what
[1:07:54] brings the rain
[1:07:57] and if the lord help us this morning i'd
[1:07:59] like to speak on a little subject i
[1:08:02] cannot
[1:08:03] go back
[1:08:06] because
[1:08:07] peter when he
[1:08:10] i mean paul in hebrews when he lays
[1:08:12] forth this
[1:08:15] subject of what the faith is
[1:08:20] he talks about jesus and the
[1:08:22] who he was and how he became man and how
[1:08:26] he
[1:08:28] offered himself
[1:08:30] the final and complete sacrifice for sin
[1:08:39] and he says in
[1:08:43] hebrews
[1:08:45] 11 and 16
[1:08:47] or 10 and 16 this is the covenant that i
[1:08:50] will make with them quoting
[1:08:52] old testament scripture this is the
[1:08:54] covenant that i will make with them
[1:08:57] after those days saith the lord i will
[1:08:59] put my laws in their hearts
[1:09:03] and in their minds will i write them and
[1:09:05] their sins and iniquities will i
[1:09:09] remember
[1:09:10] no more
[1:09:12] so can god forget
[1:09:15] yes
[1:09:16] is that ascribing weakness to god
[1:09:20] no
[1:09:21] is it the word of god
[1:09:23] yes because god said i will remember no
[1:09:27] more
[1:09:32] so can god forget your sins and forget
[1:09:36] your iniquities yes
[1:09:38] he promised he would
[1:09:44] and then he went on to say he was
[1:09:46] speaking of
[1:09:48] this sacrifice
[1:09:50] that jesus made at calvary how complete
[1:09:53] it was and he said
[1:09:55] one by one offering hath he perfected
[1:09:59] forever them that are sanctified
[1:10:02] so for those that he made this offering
[1:10:05] for those that come under
[1:10:08] this
[1:10:09] sacrifice
[1:10:11] that he gives
[1:10:14] that is done once and for all and he
[1:10:17] says in verse 18 of hebrews 10
[1:10:20] now where remission of these is there is
[1:10:24] no more offering for sin
[1:10:31] because there was only one
[1:10:33] so it doesn't matter how much
[1:10:37] we want to
[1:10:38] bring a greater repentance
[1:10:41] how much we want to give a greater oath
[1:10:45] this time that lord i'm gonna do better
[1:10:49] no matter how
[1:10:51] as the songwriter said could my tears
[1:10:53] forever flow and my zeal no langer no
[1:10:58] these for sins could not atone thou must
[1:11:00] save and thou alone
[1:11:03] i believe sometimes as believers we we
[1:11:06] look
[1:11:08] for this offering
[1:11:10] for sin we think well if i just would
[1:11:14] just
[1:11:15] maybe beat myself and show myself
[1:11:19] how you should know better and
[1:11:22] and and you believe the message of the
[1:11:24] hour and you've heard the prophet say
[1:11:26] these things or or you're a bible reader
[1:11:30] and you know better
[1:11:34] excuse me
[1:11:36] and after all this time and you serving
[1:11:38] the lord and making this profession and
[1:11:41] teaching others and
[1:11:43] and and and and
[1:11:46] claiming a perfect word
[1:11:48] and then you
[1:11:50] stumble and fall again
[1:11:54] certainly if we could give ourselves
[1:11:57] enough of a beating
[1:11:59] it would be some offering for sin but
[1:12:02] there isn't another offering
[1:12:05] there's only one offering
[1:12:07] there's not a greater repentance maybe
[1:12:09] you you you say well if i could find a
[1:12:11] bigger tub
[1:12:13] of of being sorry
[1:12:16] you know
[1:12:17] before i i i i
[1:12:21] i brought this
[1:12:22] gallon bowl of being sorry
[1:12:25] but now i feel so much more guilty
[1:12:29] because i owe the lord after all he's
[1:12:32] done for me i'm farther down the road so
[1:12:35] now i'm bringing a five gallon bucket of
[1:12:39] sorry for my offering
[1:12:43] there is no offering
[1:12:45] where remission of these is there is no
[1:12:50] more
[1:12:51] offering
[1:12:52] for sin
[1:12:54] you say brother mcgary are you saying we
[1:12:55] shouldn't repent yes we should repent
[1:12:57] but
[1:13:01] when we
[1:13:02] kneel there we can only accept
[1:13:06] the atonement that has already been made
[1:13:10] we can only embrace it we can only
[1:13:13] receive it we can only believe in its
[1:13:16] power to make us clean to make us pure
[1:13:21] we have no other place to go
[1:13:24] of necessity we must believe
[1:13:32] oh
[1:13:34] i would to god he helped me this morning
[1:13:36] to express it how i feel it in my heart
[1:13:38] but it seems like the enemy
[1:13:41] and i don't know what it is
[1:13:44] he always is demanding something that
[1:13:47] looks a little cleaner
[1:13:49] a little crisper a little more well done
[1:13:52] a little more
[1:13:54] uh you know not so rough around the
[1:13:57] edges not so full them up down and get
[1:14:00] up again and fall down and get up again
[1:14:03] but you know what the the thing that he
[1:14:05] hates is that you're going forward
[1:14:08] that that that forward momentum is
[1:14:11] taking you towards your home in glory
[1:14:14] it's a demonstration of your love affair
[1:14:18] for him and his word because you must go
[1:14:22] on
[1:14:24] but it is born of necessity
[1:14:27] and paul talked about these necessities
[1:14:29] in our lives and and and in his battles
[1:14:32] and he said god put necessities in my
[1:14:35] life and he put these things that i have
[1:14:38] to overcome
[1:14:40] and it's it's not as pretty
[1:14:43] as we want it to be
[1:14:46] but we are going on
[1:14:50] and you say well did you
[1:14:52] did you attain
[1:14:54] to some noble
[1:14:58] revelation
[1:15:00] that
[1:15:02] that you got so high and so powerful and
[1:15:05] you were
[1:15:06] so much of an overcomer that you've just
[1:15:10] learned to have to go you know full
[1:15:13] speed ahead at all times and stay the
[1:15:16] course and you know all the motors are
[1:15:18] running good and and the ship is headed
[1:15:21] toward port and she's a beautiful sight
[1:15:30] no
[1:15:33] though the
[1:15:35] sails be battered
[1:15:39] the anchor holds the ship's going on and
[1:15:42] paul showed up on the shore the ship was
[1:15:46] beat to pieces but he said stick with me
[1:15:50] and stick with the ship because there's
[1:15:52] gonna come no harm
[1:15:55] just believe this because the angel of
[1:15:57] the lord came and told me this night
[1:16:00] that we're not gonna this thing is not
[1:16:02] gonna come to doom and death but we're
[1:16:06] all going to be saved
[1:16:10] just
[1:16:11] stick with this thing and write it out
[1:16:14] and
[1:16:17] that's what the disciples said to jesus
[1:16:19] said where else can we go
[1:16:23] and
[1:16:29] so
[1:16:30] paul brings the believer to a place
[1:16:34] where there isn't any other place of
[1:16:37] atonement
[1:16:39] but in jesus christ
[1:16:41] there's no place of perfection there's
[1:16:43] no place of safety there there's no
[1:16:46] other place to be clean but in
[1:16:50] jesus christ
[1:16:53] having therefore brethren boldness to
[1:16:56] enter into the holiest by
[1:16:58] the blood of jesus
[1:17:00] by a new and living way
[1:17:03] which hath
[1:17:04] which he
[1:17:05] hath consecrated for us through the veil
[1:17:09] that is to say
[1:17:11] his flesh
[1:17:13] and so after establishing this faith he
[1:17:16] goes on into
[1:17:19] chapter 11 and he says
[1:17:23] and just the kind of the intro to
[1:17:24] chapter 11 is
[1:17:26] for yet a little while and he that shall
[1:17:29] come will come and will not tarry
[1:17:33] now the just shall live by faith but if
[1:17:35] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[1:17:38] pleasure in him
[1:17:40] but we are not of them who draw back
[1:17:43] unto perdition
[1:17:44] but of them that believe to the saving
[1:17:48] of the soul
[1:17:53] and he begins to talk
[1:17:56] about those
[1:17:58] that had faith and the company
[1:18:01] that we are
[1:18:03] numbered in
[1:18:05] and
[1:18:06] i believe that all of us
[1:18:08] we like to be appreciated
[1:18:11] we like to hear
[1:18:13] some
[1:18:14] compliments
[1:18:16] we like to hear
[1:18:18] affirmations
[1:18:22] but you know
[1:18:23] if you're a son or daughter of god
[1:18:26] you were born into this
[1:18:29] and god has given you a revelation that
[1:18:32] you are a son or daughter of god you're
[1:18:36] a soldier of the cross
[1:18:39] you have a revelation within you that
[1:18:42] this is what you were born for that you
[1:18:45] were born to serve the lord
[1:18:49] and that abides
[1:18:51] within you
[1:18:53] there's a witness in you there is a
[1:18:56] spirit in you
[1:18:57] and paul said in galatians because you
[1:19:00] are sons
[1:19:01] god's put
[1:19:03] the spirit of his son in you crying of a
[1:19:07] father
[1:19:08] and no matter what condition you get in
[1:19:11] there is always that witness in you that
[1:19:14] cries out to god because you are a son
[1:19:17] or daughter of god and that's that's
[1:19:20] what you do that's who you are
[1:19:23] and this living for god is what we do
[1:19:27] because it's in our genes it's it's in
[1:19:29] our dna it's in our heart we're going to
[1:19:32] get to a place
[1:19:33] here if god will help us but
[1:19:36] if we to get praise or if we don't get
[1:19:39] praise if we get recognition or if we
[1:19:41] don't get recognition
[1:19:45] we're not
[1:19:46] living by that
[1:19:48] we're living by faith
[1:19:50] and it's a revelation that god put in
[1:19:53] our heart of who we are and what our
[1:19:56] mission is and what our purpose is and
[1:19:59] what is living
[1:20:00] and and abiding and working and moving
[1:20:04] in our heart and soul and what's moving
[1:20:07] this ship forward in hell or high water
[1:20:11] is this love of god and his word that he
[1:20:15] put within us and it will bring the ship
[1:20:18] to harbor
[1:20:31] we believe it
[1:20:33] of necessity
[1:20:36] strange to say
[1:20:38] but we have no place else to go
[1:20:45] after god has brought to you the truth
[1:20:48] of who he is jesus said if i had not
[1:20:51] come
[1:20:52] and done a work among you which no man
[1:20:54] could do
[1:20:56] you would have no sin but now sin
[1:20:59] lays at your door because jesus did come
[1:21:05] i remember witnessing to a man from
[1:21:07] france and we
[1:21:08] brought him to the post office and i
[1:21:10] said now
[1:21:12] i said now it's on you
[1:21:15] to believe or disbelief you know we had
[1:21:18] kind of told them the gospel story and
[1:21:19] things
[1:21:22] and the man began to shake and and
[1:21:25] stutter and he said it's not fair
[1:21:29] he said it's not fair what you've what
[1:21:31] the place that you brought me here
[1:21:34] what am i to do
[1:21:36] and i marvel that how a man could have
[1:21:39] the depth of understanding that he
[1:21:41] understood that he was right in that
[1:21:43] place that he had to believe
[1:21:46] or not believe
[1:21:48] and he recognized he was right there
[1:21:52] and he was kind of saying well how can
[1:21:54] you do this to me
[1:21:58] and you know i i
[1:22:00] i had to feel for the man but
[1:22:02] of course it wasn't me
[1:22:05] it's god does that god brings his word
[1:22:08] to you and you
[1:22:11] are put in the position to accept or
[1:22:14] reject and as god reveals more of his
[1:22:17] word to you
[1:22:19] you realize
[1:22:23] that if you believe this
[1:22:26] then you must believe that
[1:22:28] if you believe that the lamb was slain
[1:22:31] before the foundation of the world and
[1:22:33] you believe in god's foreknowledge
[1:22:38] and let's put just put it simply does
[1:22:40] god know who's going to heaven and who's
[1:22:42] not
[1:22:45] yes
[1:22:47] when did god know that
[1:22:50] did he just learn that when
[1:22:53] you accepted him and said i accept jesus
[1:22:55] as my savior and he says oh
[1:22:57] i didn't know that man glad to have you
[1:23:00] in the family
[1:23:02] no he knew
[1:23:04] what your decision would be
[1:23:07] actually he knew you before the
[1:23:09] foundation of the world
[1:23:22] and really
[1:23:25] if you're part of him
[1:23:28] your spirit now
[1:23:33] was always part of him
[1:23:36] i wasn't going to go here this morning
[1:23:38] and i do want to
[1:23:40] be a gentleman and
[1:23:41] pay attention to the time
[1:23:52] perhaps the lord will help us and give
[1:23:54] us understanding
[1:23:57] and if you'll notice how that eve was
[1:24:00] united with adam
[1:24:03] she became part of him god did you
[1:24:06] notice in genesis 1 and 27
[1:24:10] he created man
[1:24:12] male and female
[1:24:13] created he them
[1:24:15] so if you read your bible that's just
[1:24:16] how it reads
[1:24:18] now isn't that interesting that he say
[1:24:20] he created man
[1:24:22] male and female
[1:24:25] but this was the creation that was in
[1:24:27] god's own image spirit man
[1:24:31] so remember there's no
[1:24:34] man to teal the soil at this point
[1:24:36] there's no
[1:24:37] this isn't god creating man from the
[1:24:40] dust of the earth
[1:24:42] this is the man that was created in the
[1:24:46] image of god he was spirit man
[1:24:49] and this spirit man was male and female
[1:24:59] he created man male and female created
[1:25:02] he them now the man was both male and
[1:25:05] female when it come to being in the
[1:25:08] spirit of feminist and masculine
[1:25:13] then god took from his side a rib
[1:25:17] did you notice the body part
[1:25:19] was the byproduct but not the spirit
[1:25:27] the body part was the byproduct but not
[1:25:30] the spirit
[1:25:32] the body part of the woman was a
[1:25:34] byproduct after the creation had been
[1:25:37] finished
[1:25:38] god took from the side of adam a rib and
[1:25:41] made a woman
[1:25:43] but not the spirit
[1:25:45] the spirit was part of adam
[1:25:48] for he was both man and woman feminist
[1:25:50] spiritually speaking
[1:25:53] both masculine and feminine
[1:25:55] now don't you see the great picture
[1:25:59] we in the flesh are different
[1:26:01] we're like a byproduct a created being
[1:26:04] by holy wedlock but in spirit we are
[1:26:07] sons and daughters of god not some other
[1:26:10] spirit but the spirit of the living god
[1:26:14] we are in his likeness
[1:26:17] in his unity in the perfect image of the
[1:26:20] living god because we become sons and
[1:26:23] daughters not separated but the same
[1:26:26] spirit the same god
[1:26:29] the same person
[1:26:35] we won't go on but
[1:26:40] when we first believe
[1:26:43] we fell in love with the lord jesus not
[1:26:46] really understanding
[1:26:49] but
[1:26:51] it was so great to know his love he came
[1:26:54] by a demonstration
[1:26:57] of his spirit
[1:26:59] he came close to you
[1:27:02] and he made himself known to you and he
[1:27:05] loved you and you
[1:27:07] recognized that
[1:27:12] and you were afraid to draw an eye to
[1:27:15] him but he said i love you and i
[1:27:18] forgive you
[1:27:22] and you took him at his word and you and
[1:27:25] you came a little closer
[1:27:28] based on your faith
[1:27:30] in his forgiveness
[1:27:33] not really understanding but your heart
[1:27:37] was moving you
[1:27:39] in this direction because you are
[1:27:42] reciprocating to his presence he came
[1:27:45] close to you and because that you are
[1:27:48] made out of metal
[1:27:50] his magnet
[1:27:51] pulled you to himself
[1:27:55] because of who you are because of that
[1:27:58] affinity
[1:27:59] between you and the great magnet
[1:28:07] you couldn't do anything but come
[1:28:13] so
[1:28:15] in hebrews
[1:28:18] paul starts talking about how that
[1:28:21] you're going to have to live by this
[1:28:23] faith this
[1:28:24] this thing that is working in you
[1:28:28] it's not going to line up with reasoning
[1:28:30] and intellect and all the affirmations
[1:28:33] of this present world that we are living
[1:28:36] in but it's going to move you
[1:28:38] as it did these heroes of faith
[1:28:42] and he begins to name all these heroes
[1:28:45] of faith and we won't go all those
[1:28:47] places but he does come into verse 30
[1:28:50] and he you know he names uh uh
[1:28:54] abraham and enoch and noah and abraham
[1:28:58] and sarah and
[1:29:00] isaac and jacob and joseph and moses
[1:29:03] and moses's parents and
[1:29:06] joshua and israel and he comes down to
[1:29:11] a harlot
[1:29:15] now
[1:29:17] how is it
[1:29:19] that a woman that
[1:29:21] sells her body
[1:29:24] for a living
[1:29:26] comes into
[1:29:29] this
[1:29:30] registry
[1:29:33] of the heroes of faith
[1:29:35] and god preserves this woman
[1:29:39] in his word
[1:29:44] as one of those that lived by faith
[1:29:49] and it's beautiful when you go back and
[1:29:51] read it and you just
[1:29:53] hear
[1:29:54] rahab pouring out her heart
[1:29:57] to these
[1:29:58] spies and he's saying she's saying this
[1:30:02] is the way it really is
[1:30:12] i don't know what they were
[1:30:13] putting on posters in the streets i
[1:30:15] don't know what they were saying on the
[1:30:17] radio or on the television maybe they're
[1:30:19] telling all the people you know be
[1:30:20] strong uh
[1:30:22] jericho's a great city we can run horses
[1:30:25] around there and i don't know what the
[1:30:27] promotion was at the day in the hour but
[1:30:30] she bore her heart to these spies
[1:30:35] i don't know how they find their way to
[1:30:38] the harlot's house
[1:30:41] god always shrouds his words and his
[1:30:44] workings in such a mysterious thing how
[1:30:47] what in the world would you say if a
[1:30:49] couple of brothers went overseas and
[1:30:51] they said yeah well we're at this
[1:30:53] harlot's house and she believes
[1:30:57] and you're going what
[1:31:04] the scripture doesn't offer any
[1:31:05] explanations it just tells it the way it
[1:31:08] is and here she is
[1:31:10] and then
[1:31:11] she tells the spies the real story
[1:31:15] i don't know maybe if she they would
[1:31:16] have went into somebody you know kind of
[1:31:18] polished in high society and everything
[1:31:21] they would say well we're not really
[1:31:23] afraid of you guys
[1:31:24] you know we've been here a long time and
[1:31:26] we've had a lot of people raise up like
[1:31:28] you and do crazy stuff like run around
[1:31:31] the
[1:31:32] building
[1:31:36] but this woman i don't think she had
[1:31:38] anything to hide
[1:31:40] she just was what she was and she said
[1:31:42] you know what's going on here
[1:31:44] we're all scared to death we heard of
[1:31:47] you we heard you passed through the red
[1:31:49] sea we heard that who you've conquered
[1:31:53] on your way here
[1:31:54] and all i want to do
[1:31:57] is ask for mercy
[1:32:01] all i want to do is ask for mercy for me
[1:32:03] and my house
[1:32:05] she's still thinking of her family i
[1:32:07] don't know what her family thought of
[1:32:08] her but she thought a lot of her family
[1:32:13] oh my
[1:32:15] oh there's nothing quite so sad as
[1:32:18] unrequited love
[1:32:20] people get rejected
[1:32:22] but the beauty of the gospel and the
[1:32:24] word of god and what god does is even
[1:32:26] when they're rejected their love
[1:32:29] presses on
[1:32:31] look what she did for her family
[1:32:37] and she made them promise and she hung
[1:32:39] that scarlet thread out and they went
[1:32:41] down on that line and they said
[1:32:44] just let this scarlet thread show
[1:32:49] and you and your house will be saved
[1:32:52] and there's been a scarlet thread all
[1:32:54] through scripture
[1:32:55] whether it be righteous or unrighteous
[1:32:57] but here she is the harlot and then paul
[1:33:00] goes on to say and i want to read these
[1:33:01] real fast
[1:33:02] uh and you excuse me for reading so much
[1:33:05] scripture
[1:33:07] and what shall we what shall i say more
[1:33:09] then
[1:33:11] and time would fail me to tell of gideon
[1:33:13] and a barack and of samson and of
[1:33:15] japheth
[1:33:16] and of david also and of samuel and the
[1:33:19] prophets who through faith subdued
[1:33:21] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[1:33:23] promises stopped the mouths of lion
[1:33:25] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[1:33:27] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[1:33:30] were made strong waxed valiant and fight
[1:33:32] turned the flight of the armies of the
[1:33:34] aliens women received their dead race to
[1:33:37] life again and others were tortured not
[1:33:39] accepting deliverance that they might
[1:33:41] obtain a better resurrection and others
[1:33:44] had trials of cruel mockings and
[1:33:46] scourging jay more over bonds and
[1:33:49] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[1:33:52] sawn asunder they temp they were tempted
[1:33:55] and they were slain with the sword and
[1:33:57] they wandered about in sheepskins and
[1:34:00] goatskins being destitute and afflicted
[1:34:03] tormented of whom the world
[1:34:07] was not worthy they wandered in deserts
[1:34:10] and in mountains and in dens and in
[1:34:12] caves of the earth
[1:34:17] and these all having obtained a good
[1:34:19] report through faith received not the
[1:34:21] promise god having provided some better
[1:34:24] thing for us that we without
[1:34:27] that we that they without us should not
[1:34:30] be made complete or perfect
[1:34:35] so it looks like they did all the
[1:34:36] suffering they went through all the
[1:34:38] trials they went through the mockings
[1:34:40] and the persecutions and somehow we
[1:34:43] flowed in because
[1:34:44] we got the revelation
[1:34:46] i don't think so
[1:34:48] i think that every christian is going to
[1:34:50] bear the reproach of jesus christ in
[1:34:52] their life
[1:34:53] the word of god is going to bring a
[1:34:55] reproach in your life
[1:34:57] your faith in god is going to be
[1:34:59] reproached it's going to be reproached
[1:35:02] with by intellect it's going to be
[1:35:04] reproached by reason it's going to be
[1:35:06] reproached by common sense every
[1:35:10] vow and
[1:35:11] and promise you make to god in every
[1:35:16] devotion of love and consecration you
[1:35:19] make to him will be sorely tested
[1:35:29] should i float to heaven on a bed of
[1:35:31] ease when others sailed through bloody
[1:35:33] seas
[1:35:35] no
[1:35:38] no
[1:35:40] chapter 12
[1:35:41] paul gives a pretty stern rebuke and he
[1:35:43] said hey you have not yet resisted the
[1:35:46] blood
[1:35:49] you're going to bear
[1:35:50] chastening
[1:35:57] but he says hold fast
[1:35:59] your profession
[1:36:02] that has great recompense of reward
[1:36:07] not someone else's profession you ever
[1:36:10] talk to somebody and they say we believe
[1:36:13] we believe this is what we believe
[1:36:16] you're thinking you and who i remember
[1:36:18] brother branham he asked some
[1:36:20] so there was some theologian or
[1:36:22] something and said well we believe and
[1:36:24] he said well it's certainly not you and
[1:36:25] god because that's not god's word
[1:36:28] so well we don't know who this we is
[1:36:31] but i believe that god
[1:36:34] his desire is that you have a profession
[1:36:37] that you hold past your profession and
[1:36:40] your profession what you profess
[1:36:44] as a christian as a believer god already
[1:36:47] said it you're not making it up as you
[1:36:49] go
[1:36:52] god sent his word and you recognize that
[1:36:55] and you said yes i believe that
[1:36:59] jesus said
[1:37:02] no man cometh on the
[1:37:04] unto the father except by me
[1:37:06] is very absolute
[1:37:08] and very unpopular in this day and age
[1:37:12] that we live
[1:37:13] but you say
[1:37:16] amen and then
[1:37:18] what he said becomes your profession
[1:37:23] or you confess that that's true that's
[1:37:25] your profession or your confession
[1:37:33] not someone else's yours
[1:37:38] and as you live that out that may not be
[1:37:42] as pretty
[1:37:43] as you want it to be
[1:37:45] but as long as it's lived
[1:37:48] through a true heart
[1:37:52] so there's certain necessities and
[1:37:54] realities that we desire things to look
[1:37:57] better
[1:37:59] we desire things to be
[1:38:02] cleaner clearer cut
[1:38:05] you know
[1:38:08] kind of a a faultless rendition
[1:38:14] and we always kind of feeling like man
[1:38:16] let me let me try that again let me do
[1:38:18] that again
[1:38:20] give me another opportunity lord and
[1:38:23] i'll do better and we do we do do better
[1:38:25] praise god aren't you thankful for that
[1:38:32] but sometimes we desire things
[1:38:35] that god's got a greater order than what
[1:38:38] we're longing for
[1:38:42] we're longing for order we're we're
[1:38:43] longing for rightness
[1:38:45] i would say righteousness but it just
[1:38:47] seems like a big word but but you can
[1:38:50] hear people around you saying you know
[1:38:52] well i just want it to be done right you
[1:38:54] know why don't they just do right
[1:38:57] you know
[1:38:59] as if
[1:39:01] as if it's as easy as learning how to
[1:39:03] throw the darts in the center you know
[1:39:04] and one person figures out how to do it
[1:39:07] and
[1:39:09] i was with some guys doing the arrows
[1:39:12] you know and the other guys are they're
[1:39:13] all over the
[1:39:14] hay bag hay bale you know
[1:39:17] and this one brother he's just
[1:39:20] you know he's messing up his arrows
[1:39:22] shooting them so close together
[1:39:26] you know so so we sometimes in our
[1:39:28] thinking we think well you know how come
[1:39:29] they can't get it right
[1:39:32] you know all i want is things done right
[1:39:36] and i just want to be right with god and
[1:39:38] i want everybody else please to be right
[1:39:40] with god also
[1:39:42] hello
[1:39:44] and we struggle within ourselves
[1:39:46] but god's got such a greater picture
[1:39:49] going on
[1:39:50] i brought my little grandson a rock
[1:39:52] tumbler he's all excited about it
[1:39:55] you're not trying to be funny i'm just
[1:39:57] trying to give a little comic
[1:39:59] relief that we could rest a little while
[1:40:01] but
[1:40:02] he's all excited about the rock tumbler
[1:40:04] his mother is not
[1:40:06] because the settings on the rock tumbler
[1:40:10] are not hours or minutes
[1:40:12] it stays
[1:40:13] you set it for five days on this speed
[1:40:17] with this grid in there and the rocks
[1:40:19] tumble and they got a tumble in there
[1:40:20] for five days
[1:40:22] so they're trying to think of a place in
[1:40:24] the house they can tolerate this
[1:40:28] you know rubbing
[1:40:29] and grinding and
[1:40:31] you know going on
[1:40:34] i think you get the picture
[1:40:38] being polished where god's great gems
[1:40:41] being
[1:40:42] polished the way he wants to do it
[1:40:47] don't miss this revelation brother
[1:40:50] branham says
[1:40:51] let's let's try to go up a little bit
[1:40:54] watch god then what
[1:40:56] did he tell adam and eve go and multiply
[1:40:59] and replenish the earth scatter the
[1:41:01] human race all over the earth
[1:41:04] so he could deal with them individually
[1:41:07] till he could bring them back together
[1:41:09] dealing with the people individuals each
[1:41:12] one person
[1:41:14] but they didn't want it that way
[1:41:17] don't miss this revelation god
[1:41:20] let it happen may you see it in the way
[1:41:23] i'm looking at it
[1:41:26] see it wasn't that god don't deal with a
[1:41:29] person in a
[1:41:30] group god don't deal with you in an
[1:41:34] organization he deals with you as an
[1:41:36] individual
[1:41:38] an individual individually we are
[1:41:40] baptized with the holy ghost
[1:41:43] collectively we are baptized into the
[1:41:45] body when we are baptized with the holy
[1:41:48] ghost
[1:41:49] individually each one baptized with the
[1:41:52] holy ghost
[1:41:53] god dealing with each one
[1:41:56] that was his purpose
[1:41:58] scatter them across the earth so he
[1:42:01] could deal individually
[1:42:03] with them
[1:42:12] look at paul when jesus dealt with paul
[1:42:14] where did he go
[1:42:15] do you head to jerusalem say hey guys
[1:42:17] this is what happened
[1:42:19] yeah you approve disapprove what do you
[1:42:21] think
[1:42:22] no
[1:42:23] he went to the wilderness and he looked
[1:42:24] to the word of god he had an experience
[1:42:26] with god and he wanted to see if his
[1:42:28] experience matched the word of god
[1:42:31] isn't that what we all did
[1:42:33] god come and work to work in our life
[1:42:35] that we did not understand it was such a
[1:42:38] marvelous thing and we were changed
[1:42:42] and our heart was changed and as we
[1:42:45] began to hear the gospel we heard new
[1:42:47] terminology and new things and we said
[1:42:50] god is this what that is
[1:42:53] is this that
[1:42:57] and then the enemy comes and tries to
[1:42:58] accuse you and say well you don't even
[1:43:00] know but prophet of god said if this
[1:43:02] isn't that i'm going to keep this until
[1:43:04] that comes
[1:43:08] so
[1:43:12] we we we long for things that
[1:43:18] sometimes god has such a greater picture
[1:43:21] and i like to just kind of close this
[1:43:24] morning by
[1:43:26] taking one of these
[1:43:27] characters
[1:43:30] that paul mentioned
[1:43:32] and going back to our scripture that we
[1:43:35] opened with this morning in judges
[1:43:41] japeth
[1:43:48] and japheth was a son of gilead not the
[1:43:50] gilead formally and judges apparently
[1:43:53] another
[1:43:54] man named gilead and
[1:43:58] in judges 11 it says now japeth the
[1:44:00] gilean was a mighty man of valor and he
[1:44:03] was the son of an harlot and gilead
[1:44:07] begot
[1:44:09] japheth
[1:44:11] and gilead's wife bare him sons and his
[1:44:14] wife's sons grew up
[1:44:17] and they thrust out japeth
[1:44:20] and said unto him
[1:44:22] thou shalt not inherit our father's
[1:44:24] house for thou art the son
[1:44:27] of a strange woman
[1:44:29] then jabeth fled
[1:44:31] from his brethren and dwelt in the land
[1:44:33] of tobe
[1:44:35] and there were gathered vain men to
[1:44:38] japheth and went out with him
[1:44:41] now you get this idea that okay this man
[1:44:44] is a mighty man of valor but you already
[1:44:49] judged him because he was the son of a
[1:44:51] harlot
[1:44:53] and you think well you know he's
[1:44:55] probably tough dude
[1:44:58] you know don't mess with him
[1:45:02] and
[1:45:04] you get a certain picture that because
[1:45:06] it said that he was son of a harlot and
[1:45:08] his own brothers
[1:45:10] who were also sons of his own dad
[1:45:14] they didn't want him around and they
[1:45:16] sent him off but when israel got in
[1:45:18] trouble
[1:45:19] and they had to fight the
[1:45:22] amorites
[1:45:23] or the sons the children of ammon
[1:45:28] lo and behold
[1:45:29] they call for japeth
[1:45:32] because they knew somebody they had that
[1:45:34] they needed somebody on the scene who
[1:45:36] had something
[1:45:39] now the scripture don't give us the
[1:45:41] details of this but it does say that the
[1:45:44] elders
[1:45:46] they called for him
[1:45:49] and they knew that they had this war
[1:45:51] against the sons of ammon and and they
[1:45:54] knew they were outnumbered and and and
[1:45:56] the greater army than they could face
[1:45:59] and they needed somebody
[1:46:02] somebody like
[1:46:04] japheth
[1:46:06] maybe who wasn't afraid maybe who had
[1:46:08] courage maybe maybe who was a fighter i
[1:46:11] you know it didn't look too pretty he
[1:46:13] was the son of a harlot
[1:46:16] but he's named
[1:46:19] in the book of hebrews
[1:46:21] as a hero of faith
[1:46:24] paul's saying
[1:46:26] we are encompassed with such
[1:46:29] a great cloud of witnesses these are the
[1:46:32] kind of men these are the kind of people
[1:46:34] these women he names women and men both
[1:46:37] that
[1:46:40] these are this is the stalk that we are
[1:46:42] of these are the fighters of faith
[1:46:46] if you're gonna be in this thing you're
[1:46:48] gonna have to yield your sword like
[1:46:50] these guys did
[1:46:52] the sword in this oneness message we
[1:46:55] won't read the quote but brother brahm
[1:46:57] says the sword's completely
[1:46:59] powerless or mute or or uneffective
[1:47:02] unless it's in the hand of faith
[1:47:05] and that sword is only if you could only
[1:47:08] cut out a little bit and say well
[1:47:12] by god's grace i'm saved that's a big
[1:47:15] cut
[1:47:16] that's a big cut your hand was strong
[1:47:18] enough to cut out that much
[1:47:20] but in a strong hand of faith take that
[1:47:22] same sword it's plenty sharp it'll cut
[1:47:26] but it just takes the force
[1:47:28] of the hand of faith to make the cut but
[1:47:32] it will do it
[1:47:34] you just got to put enough pressure on
[1:47:36] that sword you just got to yield that
[1:47:38] sword and it'll cut out every promise of
[1:47:41] god
[1:47:43] it just depends on the arm that that
[1:47:46] that that sword's in
[1:47:51] so they called for japheth
[1:47:55] and
[1:47:57] he said you know you you rejected me
[1:48:00] you sent me out you you separated me
[1:48:04] from my own house
[1:48:07] and you know that word
[1:48:10] about god's children being separated
[1:48:14] it's always how god deals with his
[1:48:16] children he separates you out
[1:48:20] he always somehow you say well i wasn't
[1:48:22] separated from my family or you know i
[1:48:25] didn't have that condition but god
[1:48:27] always has a way
[1:48:29] to take you aside and separate you
[1:48:33] and talk to you
[1:48:36] and then you
[1:48:38] know that down in your heart
[1:48:41] and somehow japheth had this confidence
[1:48:44] down in him i don't know it doesn't say
[1:48:46] anything about him praying it doesn't
[1:48:49] say all these details of his life but i
[1:48:52] tell you what he had enough courage to
[1:48:54] go back he didn't stay out there and say
[1:48:57] oh you fight your own battles guys you
[1:49:00] know i'm out here you rejected me
[1:49:03] and and this thing's over
[1:49:06] no he had the courage to walk back there
[1:49:08] and face the very people that rejected
[1:49:11] him
[1:49:14] and say okay
[1:49:15] you're in trouble now
[1:49:17] are you going to make me leader
[1:49:20] and they said yeah we have to
[1:49:23] we need you
[1:49:25] they said all right let's go let's go
[1:49:27] talk to the enemy now what's amazing
[1:49:29] when he goes and talks to the enemy this
[1:49:31] is not a man that's oblivious of the
[1:49:33] word of god
[1:49:36] he's not some hooligan some wild guy
[1:49:38] some you know as we would say the son of
[1:49:40] a harlot and he's been gone from town
[1:49:42] and we don't know where he was and these
[1:49:44] vain guys hooked up with them and we
[1:49:47] heard that he goes out and i i assume
[1:49:50] goes out and beats up on
[1:49:51] amorites and hittites and whatever and
[1:49:53] gets their spoil
[1:49:58] but when he talks to the ammonites he
[1:50:00] goes back in 300 years of history
[1:50:05] if i if i did my math right and
[1:50:08] you that are
[1:50:09] really astute and academic you can
[1:50:12] test me out on that
[1:50:13] but he brings them back to where they
[1:50:15] first came into the land and he said
[1:50:19] you guys want a war with us
[1:50:21] but you know when we came through the
[1:50:23] land and we wanted to pass through
[1:50:25] peacefully
[1:50:27] and we said we won't eat no grass we
[1:50:29] won't even drink your water if you just
[1:50:31] let us go down the king's highway we'll
[1:50:34] just pass through your land we won't
[1:50:36] cause you no trouble
[1:50:46] and the
[1:50:47] ammonites the children of ammon they
[1:50:49] said nothing doing
[1:50:51] you're not passing through our land and
[1:50:54] they amassed themselves against
[1:50:56] the children of israel
[1:50:58] on their way to their promise
[1:51:01] and god was with the children of israel
[1:51:03] and beat the fire out of them
[1:51:06] beat them down beat every city beat kill
[1:51:08] them all
[1:51:10] and took their land
[1:51:13] and
[1:51:17] japheth rehearses all this history to
[1:51:20] them and says
[1:51:21] so you see
[1:51:23] you want to take this land and say that
[1:51:25] it's yours but
[1:51:27] that's not the story that's not the
[1:51:29] history
[1:51:31] and i was just amazed at this man
[1:51:33] because when
[1:51:35] jesus came to the well and told that
[1:51:38] woman
[1:51:39] you know call your husband and she said
[1:51:41] i have no husband and
[1:51:43] jesus said you say well because you've
[1:51:46] had
[1:51:47] five husbands and the one you're with
[1:51:48] now is not your husband
[1:51:52] she had enough knowledge now her life
[1:51:56] looked like a wreck
[1:51:59] but she had something down in her heart
[1:52:01] she had the word of god in there she
[1:52:04] knew the word of god
[1:52:05] and
[1:52:06] she believed it
[1:52:08] because she said when the messiah comes
[1:52:10] he'll do this thing and jesus says he
[1:52:12] that speaketh to you that's me
[1:52:14] and she dropped her water apart she went
[1:52:16] into the city the truth
[1:52:19] so overwhelmed
[1:52:22] her past
[1:52:23] to her
[1:52:25] oh hallelujah what a thought of that she
[1:52:28] was so
[1:52:29] thrilled that the messiah was there she
[1:52:32] had so much faith in him and who he was
[1:52:34] because she knew down in her heart when
[1:52:37] the messiah comes things are going to be
[1:52:39] different
[1:52:42] and she had that knowledge down in her
[1:52:44] heart and when she spoke to jesus
[1:52:47] all of her past
[1:52:49] all of her messiness all of her
[1:52:51] brokenness all of her
[1:52:53] insignificance and in in in failures and
[1:52:57] and shame and
[1:52:58] all this disgusting life of hers it
[1:53:01] didn't matter what mattered was the
[1:53:03] truth and she said come and see a man is
[1:53:07] not this the very messiah
[1:53:17] what else could she do
[1:53:19] she had a revelation
[1:53:32] so
[1:53:36] we're not trying to go all morning all
[1:53:38] day today
[1:53:40] if god help us we'll move
[1:53:43] to a close
[1:53:49] so japheth
[1:53:52] he goes forth
[1:53:56] to meet
[1:53:58] the ammonites
[1:54:01] and verse 29 says then the spirit of the
[1:54:04] lord came upon japheth
[1:54:07] and he passed over gilead and manasseh
[1:54:09] and passed over miss buff and gilead
[1:54:13] and from mispath
[1:54:14] of gilead he passed over unto the
[1:54:18] children
[1:54:19] of ammon
[1:54:21] so the spirit of the lord was on him and
[1:54:23] he's going out after these guys
[1:54:27] something
[1:54:28] that god did
[1:54:30] for him
[1:54:31] is now
[1:54:33] moving him in his course of action
[1:54:36] without dread or fear
[1:54:39] this spirit of the lord that was in
[1:54:41] japheth
[1:54:44] is moving him
[1:54:46] to encounter his foes
[1:54:49] and in verse 30
[1:54:50] and japeth vowed a vow unto the lord and
[1:54:54] said if thou shalt
[1:54:57] without fail deliver the children of
[1:55:00] ammon
[1:55:01] into mine hands
[1:55:04] then it shall be that whatsoever cometh
[1:55:07] forth of the doors of my house to meet
[1:55:10] me when i return in peace from the
[1:55:13] children of ammon
[1:55:15] shall surely be the lords and i will
[1:55:17] offer it up
[1:55:19] for a burnt offering
[1:55:22] so jacob passed over unto the children
[1:55:25] of ammon to fight against them and the
[1:55:27] lord delivered them into his hand now
[1:55:30] japheth was in no way obligated to make
[1:55:34] this vow
[1:55:36] and by his own testimony you can read it
[1:55:38] there that he told those children of
[1:55:41] ammon we're in the right god is with us
[1:55:44] and this is i'm in the right cause
[1:55:47] and you are not
[1:55:49] and we're gonna let the lord
[1:55:53] decide between
[1:55:55] ye
[1:55:56] and us
[1:55:57] what's right here
[1:56:01] so he wasn't making any deals with the
[1:56:03] lord
[1:56:05] he wasn't making any bargains
[1:56:07] the he presented his case to the
[1:56:09] children ramen he said we're going to
[1:56:11] come and fight this battle in the name
[1:56:13] of the lord
[1:56:15] i've given you opportunity to forsake
[1:56:18] this foolish thing that you're doing
[1:56:20] i've given you the history i've told you
[1:56:23] what the will of god was
[1:56:25] and
[1:56:26] and now we are coming
[1:56:29] what
[1:56:30] moved
[1:56:32] on japheth to make this vow before the
[1:56:35] lord
[1:56:40] but he did
[1:56:44] so japeth smote
[1:56:46] all of the ammonites city after city he
[1:56:49] made this great
[1:56:51] conquest
[1:56:54] and he came back
[1:56:57] in victory
[1:57:02] and as we read and we'll read again and
[1:57:04] joseph came to mispa unto his house and
[1:57:07] behold his daughter came out to meet him
[1:57:10] with timbrels and with dances and she
[1:57:12] was his
[1:57:13] only child besides her
[1:57:17] he had neither son or daughter what a
[1:57:19] beautiful sight that was
[1:57:21] for a
[1:57:22] father to see his daughter after he'd
[1:57:25] gone through
[1:57:27] this big
[1:57:28] ugly battle
[1:57:31] and and
[1:57:32] and you can well imagine how ugly
[1:57:35] that war was
[1:57:37] and he comes back to his house in peace
[1:57:40] all of that violence and ugliness has
[1:57:43] passed
[1:57:45] and out comes
[1:57:47] his beloved daughter dancing with
[1:57:50] timbrels how precious that must have
[1:57:53] been in his sight
[1:57:55] what a beautiful thing
[1:57:57] what a beautiful thing
[1:58:01] and it came to pass when he saw her that
[1:58:03] he rent
[1:58:05] his clothes and it doesn't say that he
[1:58:07] wailed but
[1:58:09] we were at the funeral of a
[1:58:12] infant child and
[1:58:13] it was time to close the casket
[1:58:17] and the mother
[1:58:19] wailed
[1:58:24] and i could relate to that
[1:58:28] something down in my soul said it's
[1:58:31] it's only right and good that this
[1:58:34] congregation of people would hear
[1:58:36] that mother
[1:58:37] whale
[1:58:44] and he said alas my daughter thou has
[1:58:47] brought me very low and thou art one of
[1:58:50] them
[1:58:51] that trouble me for i have opened my
[1:58:54] mouth unto the lord
[1:58:56] and i cannot go back
[1:59:00] every
[1:59:02] born-again christian
[1:59:04] who's come in the presence of the lord
[1:59:07] jesus
[1:59:09] if you've really experienced the new
[1:59:11] birth
[1:59:12] you made a vow
[1:59:15] it may have been an unspoken vow
[1:59:19] but your own spirit and your own heart
[1:59:22] is a witness
[1:59:25] that you said to him lord i believe you
[1:59:29] i trust you
[1:59:31] i'm going with you i'm going with you
[1:59:34] all the way
[1:59:35] you
[1:59:36] every believer has had to have their
[1:59:40] gethsemane
[1:59:42] where they surrendered their own will
[1:59:45] and said
[1:59:47] not my will
[1:59:49] but thine be done
[1:59:53] you say was that a vow
[1:59:55] yes
[1:59:57] it's a vow your heart made with him
[2:00:01] and you have a witness that speaks to
[2:00:03] you
[2:00:04] your heart
[2:00:06] speaks to you
[2:00:07] and says you know you made that vow
[2:00:11] you know that you've been in that
[2:00:13] intimate place with the savior where you
[2:00:17] consecrated yourself to him you
[2:00:19] recognize that he gave himself for you
[2:00:24] and you reciprocated and said
[2:00:26] lord
[2:00:28] i
[2:00:29] surrender all
[2:00:37] it was a vow
[2:00:40] and it's a vow that has stayed
[2:00:43] in your life
[2:00:45] that no matter how much falling down
[2:00:47] there's been
[2:00:49] and no matter how much questioning
[2:00:51] there's been this has abided in your
[2:00:54] life this sacred vow between you and
[2:00:58] your savior
[2:00:59] and you have opened your mouth unto the
[2:01:02] lord you made your profession
[2:01:07] you made your confession
[2:01:10] but you could do nothing else because it
[2:01:13] was god moving in you it's a mysterious
[2:01:17] thing perhaps your spouse don't
[2:01:19] understand your
[2:01:20] family your friends whoever it might be
[2:01:23] someone else in the church don't
[2:01:25] understand what god's doing in your
[2:01:27] heart but you made your vow
[2:01:32] and for every believer we find ourselves
[2:01:36] in this place that japeth said i have
[2:01:40] opened my mouth unto the lord
[2:01:44] i
[2:01:45] cannot go back
[2:01:52] i don't know what voice it is who it is
[2:01:54] that's demanding that this be more
[2:01:56] pretty more beautiful more romantic
[2:02:00] more perfect more eloquent whatever that
[2:02:03] the enemy is demanding out of your life
[2:02:05] you can only say that this is the way it
[2:02:08] is i cannot go back
[2:02:11] i of necessity i don't have any other
[2:02:14] place to go i can't do anything else but
[2:02:17] fight this fight of faith you don't
[2:02:19] understand who i am i cannot go back
[2:02:30] oh
[2:02:31] and how beautiful
[2:02:38] and how beautiful was this daughter
[2:02:43] and she said unto him my father
[2:02:47] thou has opened thy mouth unto the lord
[2:02:52] she knew
[2:02:54] she understood
[2:02:56] it's the respect
[2:02:59] every believer
[2:03:01] has for their brother and sister that
[2:03:03] this working of god in you is a sacred
[2:03:06] thing
[2:03:08] i'm not gonna meddle
[2:03:11] i'm not gonna cast my opinion i'm not
[2:03:14] going to have my say can you imagine
[2:03:16] if japeth had come to town and said well
[2:03:19] you know i want a great victory for you
[2:03:21] guys
[2:03:22] and then i made this promise to the lord
[2:03:24] what do you think
[2:03:27] you think i should keep it
[2:03:28] oh they say oh no no no no japeth you
[2:03:31] know you don't you don't want to you
[2:03:32] don't want to do that
[2:03:35] but his daughter understood
[2:03:38] and she said do unto me according to
[2:03:40] that which hath proceeded out of thy
[2:03:43] mouth
[2:03:44] for as much as the lord hath taken
[2:03:46] vengeance for thee of thine enemy even
[2:03:48] of the children of amith and she said
[2:03:50] unto her father let this thing be done
[2:03:52] for me
[2:03:55] let me alone two months that i may go up
[2:03:58] and down the mountains and bewail my
[2:04:00] virginity
[2:04:02] i and my fellows
[2:04:10] excuse me she doesn't know why
[2:04:13] what was going on between god and her
[2:04:16] dad
[2:04:17] but she had such a
[2:04:19] devout respect for it
[2:04:22] and such a fear of god and and and and
[2:04:26] just
[2:04:28] a young lady it appears that she must
[2:04:31] have been of teenage you know to be
[2:04:34] let
[2:04:34] go for a
[2:04:36] period of time and just go into the
[2:04:38] mountains and so
[2:04:41] probably a young lady
[2:04:43] and she said let me lament what could
[2:04:45] have been
[2:04:47] there's just a lot of human
[2:04:50] sadness in life their sorrow
[2:04:53] and hearty
[2:04:55] and god
[2:04:57] allows it
[2:05:00] but she said just give me time to lament
[2:05:07] that i'm not going to
[2:05:09] partake of the things in this life that
[2:05:12] every young girl would
[2:05:16] because of this
[2:05:18] thou
[2:05:21] let me go and
[2:05:23] lament these things and
[2:05:27] you might have said well you know dad
[2:05:28] would have
[2:05:29] maybe sat her down and said well you
[2:05:31] know job spoke of a resurrection
[2:05:34] and you know this isn't you know you're
[2:05:37] just going to cross over to a better
[2:05:38] life
[2:05:39] you know
[2:05:41] maybe
[2:05:42] somebody would have said well sit her
[2:05:44] down and explain
[2:05:45] but no our father said let her lament
[2:05:49] and there is sadness in life and we do
[2:05:52] recognize
[2:05:56] we recognize the big picture
[2:06:02] that god's
[2:06:04] got a greater plan
[2:06:06] but we also recognize
[2:06:09] suffering
[2:06:12] and our brothers and sisters and the
[2:06:14] heartache and we
[2:06:17] we don't shield ourselves from it we
[2:06:19] don't step away from it
[2:06:21] we don't try to fix it
[2:06:24] we just have
[2:06:26] a heart
[2:06:28] broken
[2:06:29] reverence for the sovereignty of god
[2:06:33] and deep down knowing
[2:06:36] that he's good

[2:11:26] let's remain standing and sing a
[2:11:30] little chorus they're playing
[2:11:33] i
[2:11:34] love you
[2:11:37] [Music]
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:12:03] joy
[2:12:11] [Music]
[2:12:17] made me a street
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:32] just before we sing another chorus
[2:12:39] is there anything
[2:12:43] [Music]
[2:12:45] that hinders you from that perfect
[2:12:48] oneness with god today
[2:12:53] do you have anything that
[2:12:56] you didn't put under the blood because
[2:12:59] once it's under the blood
[2:13:02] can't
[2:13:03] stand in the way of that intimacy that
[2:13:06] you have with your savior
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:15] and if he's made you clean
[2:13:20] there's not a thing in the world that
[2:13:22] you can do to make yourself any cleaner
[2:13:25] you're
[2:13:26] completely clean because of the
[2:13:29] perfect
[2:13:30] sacrifice
[2:13:32] has made you perfectly clean
