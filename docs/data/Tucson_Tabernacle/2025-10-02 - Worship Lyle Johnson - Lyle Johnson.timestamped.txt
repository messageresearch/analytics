[1:37] in mind.
[1:38] [Music]
[1:41] I left some hearts
[1:45] who loved me so strong.
[1:49] But I had no treasures
[1:54] to find.
[1:55] [Music]
[1:58] Treesures
[2:00] were wasted
[2:02] and pleasures
[2:04] I tasted
[2:06] were bitter
[2:08] to me. At the end
[2:12] [Music]
[2:15] when
[2:17] I saw
[2:19] I woke up and thought
[2:23] I heard a sweet voice on the wind.

[2:55] the room.

[5:14] for
[5:15] come home
[5:21] Jesus
[5:23] is waiting Sing
[5:27] home
[5:39] see that that young man that had left
[5:42] home and had wasted all his living
[5:46] and he said in my father's house the
[5:50] servants do better than I am. He said,
[5:53] "I'll just go back and tell him, I'm not
[5:54] worthy to be your son. Just make me one
[5:57] of your servants." But you know, his
[6:00] father was looking down the road. When
[6:02] he comes home, I'll be waiting for him.
[6:05] Sometimes we think, "I just can't do it.
[6:07] I'm not good enough." No. The father
[6:08] says, "Come, come, oh weary. Come."
[6:13] Amen.
[6:14] And because of that, we can sing, "Bless
[6:16] the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is
[6:20] within.
[6:25] Bless the Lord,
[6:28] oh my soul,
[6:32] and all

[10:49] Just express it in your way for the
[10:51] great things he has done.
[10:54] Tell him, "Lord, I love you. Lord, I
[10:56] appreciate you.

[11:50] Without him, where would we be? We can
[11:52] give him praise. We can give him honor.
[11:54] Say, "Thank you, Lord, for being so good
[11:55] to me." Amen. As our brother Ly prepares
[11:59] to come out this evening,
[12:03] he uh
[12:05] you know, sometimes he might might not
[12:07] know what a a minister or brother goes
[12:10] trying to prepare if he's if he really
[12:14] wants to share not what he thinks, but
[12:16] what God wants. And he sent a couple of
[12:19] songs that he would like sung. And then
[12:21] he also said, "Can you pray for me? I
[12:23] just can't seem to find what what which
[12:26] way to go." And so those of us that know
[12:29] that say, "Lord, help him because I've
[12:31] been there, too." But God always comes
[12:34] through. He He let us know today. He
[12:37] said, "It's come together." So
[12:39] appreciate that. Let's stand. Amen.
[12:42] Amen.
[12:45] Worthy.
[12:50] Worthy,
[12:53] [Music]
[12:55] worthy.
[12:57] The lamb

[13:10] Yes. Worthy.

[13:59] that was slain.
[14:04] [Music]
[14:06] Yes. Worthy, worthy is the lamb that was
[14:09] slain. that that by his blood as we sang
[14:13] in the just the previous song that his
[14:15] blood saved us. How is that even
[14:17] possible?
[14:19] How is that possible?
[14:21] We'll talk about that tonight.
[14:24] Thank you so much. Good evening.
[14:30] Tonight we continue our look at praise
[14:32] and worship. The series began four weeks
[14:35] ago when brother Josiah AO brought us a
[14:38] lesson on the overall theme of praise
[14:40] and worship. A week later, we had a
[14:42] lesson on praise, focusing on Jacob's
[14:45] fourth son, Judah, whose name means
[14:48] praise.
[14:50] We looked at how Jesus could be
[14:51] considered of that lineage by taking a
[14:54] look at adoption, illustrating with how
[14:55] Hadassa and Michaela Bagot took on the
[14:58] name of Bagot. Last Wednesday, Brother
[15:01] Daniel brought a lesson on baptism, on
[15:03] how we take on the name of Jesus.
[15:06] Tonight, let's explore a bit the nature
[15:09] and meaning of worship.
[15:12] And we'll tie in a little on sacrifice.
[15:15] Before we start, let's approach the
[15:17] throne of our creator together one more
[15:19] time. Lord Jesus,
[15:22] truly you are our Lord
[15:26] and we are so grateful.
[15:28] We are so grateful,
[15:31] Lord. We pray that tonight you'd help us
[15:33] to set aside the burdens of this life,
[15:35] the chaos of this world, the
[15:37] difficulties that we often face, Lord,
[15:40] that we can just focus on you. We thank
[15:42] you for this opportunity we've had to
[15:44] sing, Lord, to praise you, to join our
[15:47] hearts together. And now, Lord, we just
[15:50] pray that you'd speak to our hearts,
[15:51] Lord. Lord, pray that I don't say
[15:54] anything tonight, Lord. Nothing crosses
[15:56] these lips that that causes difficulty
[15:59] or problems, Lord. But but Lord, may you
[16:02] bring peace and joy and enlightenment
[16:04] and truth and answer questions, Lord.
[16:08] We're so grateful we have this
[16:09] opportunity to be together. Forgive us,
[16:12] Lord, in every way that we fall short.
[16:14] Lord, help us to be the people that
[16:16] bring a smile to your face. We thank you
[16:19] in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[16:24] For our topic verses, we'll we'll read
[16:27] from the very first time the word
[16:29] worship appears in the King James and
[16:32] most other English translations. It's
[16:35] not associated with Adam or Abel
[16:39] or Seth or Enoch
[16:43] or Noah.
[16:45] Let's read a very familiar passage from
[16:47] Abraham's life. Genesis chapter 22 and
[16:51] beginning at verse one.
[16:55] And it came to pass after these things,
[16:58] what things? Uh, these things include
[17:00] the birth of Isaac, uh, the expulsion of
[17:03] Hagar and Ishmamail, settling at Beeva,
[17:06] and so forth. Isaac's probably in his
[17:08] teens by this point after these things
[17:10] that God did tempt. Now, the word
[17:12] tempter doesn't mean entice, like, I
[17:14] know you're on a diet, but have a second
[17:16] bowl of gelato, Abraham. He's not
[17:18] talking about that kind of tempt. It
[17:21] means to test,
[17:23] not to entice. God tested Abraham and
[17:26] said unto him,"Abraham."
[17:29] And Abraham said, "Oh, behold, here I
[17:32] am." Understand, he's 115 or so at this
[17:36] point. And and the Lord said,
[17:39] "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac,
[17:43] whom thou lovest. Get thee into the land
[17:46] of Mariah. Offer him therefore a burnt
[17:49] offering upon one of the mountains which
[17:52] I will tell thee of.
[17:55] And Abraham didn't like this very much.
[17:58] So he procrastinated to see how long God
[18:01] would let him delay.
[18:03] Doesn't say that. He pleaded with God to
[18:06] change his mind.
[18:08] He slept in. No. Abraham rose up early
[18:13] in the morning, saddled his ass, took
[18:16] two of his young men with him, and
[18:19] Isaac's son, and cave, that means
[18:22] chopped or split the wood for the burnt
[18:24] offering, and rose up and went under the
[18:28] place of which God had told him.
[18:32] Then on the third day, this was a
[18:35] significant journey. Today it's 66 miles
[18:38] by road from Beeba to Jerusalem.
[18:42] Was Abraham going to have second
[18:43] thoughts?
[18:45] Turn around, decide maybe, maybe that
[18:49] was my imagination. God didn't really
[18:51] tell me to do this horrible thing. No.
[18:55] No. On the third day, Abraham lifted up
[18:58] his eyes and saw the place a far off.
[19:02] And Abraham said unto his young men,
[19:06] "Abide you here with ass, and I and the
[19:09] lad will go yonder and worship and come
[19:12] again to you."
[19:14] And Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[19:16] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son.
[19:19] And he took the fire in his hand and a
[19:21] knife, and they went, both of them
[19:24] together.
[19:26] Please be seated.
[19:29] Verse five is the first instance of the
[19:32] word worship
[19:34] in most English translations of the
[19:37] Bible.
[19:41] What do you suppose it means
[19:44] to offer a sacrifice?
[19:47] Perhaps to offer a sacrifices God
[19:49] demands, meeting specified requirements.
[19:54] But God had specified Isaac. Yet we know
[19:56] when Abraham was going to kill Isaac,
[19:59] the Lord stayed his hand and Abraham and
[20:00] Isaac together offered a ram on the
[20:02] altar instead.
[20:05] Is offering a ram or or a blood
[20:08] sacrifice the meaning of worship?
[20:12] Are worship and sacrifice synonyms in
[20:15] some way?
[20:16] Is sacrifice independent of worship?
[20:20] Certainly Abel's offering of a
[20:21] sacrificial lamb was accepted by God
[20:23] that there's no specific mention of
[20:25] worship in that account.
[20:29] What is worship?
[20:31] What does it mean?
[20:33] What does it signify?
[20:37] Let's look at an earlier event in
[20:38] Abraham's life when he was about a
[20:40] hundred years old. A story most of us
[20:43] have heard many, many times. Genesis 18
[20:47] from verse one.
[20:52] And the Lord, the Lord, the the word
[20:56] here is Yahweh,
[20:58] the self-existing God, the also vision
[21:00] one, Yahweh,
[21:02] appeared unto Abraham in the plains of
[21:04] Mamry.
[21:06] And here's how it took place. Abraham
[21:10] sat in the tent door in the heat of the
[21:13] day. Wasn't the cool of the evening.
[21:17] The context to me anyway suggests might
[21:19] have been taking a nap. A siesta, if you
[21:22] will, midday in the desert heat, sitting
[21:24] in the door.
[21:28] That's probably what I'd be doing. And
[21:30] I'm not quite a hundred. I'm getting
[21:31] there. But and Abraham, it says Abraham
[21:35] lifted up his eyes, which to me suggests
[21:38] he he woke up and looked and lo, three
[21:42] men stood by him. It doesn't say that
[21:45] Abraham saw them approach or he watched
[21:47] them as they came. They had already
[21:50] arrived and were standing there.
[21:53] And and when he saw them, he ran as fast
[21:58] as a hundred-year-old man can run. He
[22:00] ran to meet them from the tent door and
[22:04] bowed himself toward the ground
[22:09] and said, "Oh my my lord, if uh now I
[22:13] have found favor in thy sight, pass not
[22:15] away, I pray thee, from thy servant.
[22:18] Let a little water, I pray you, be
[22:20] fetched, and wash your feet, cleanses
[22:23] and cools. Rest yourselves under the
[22:26] tree. I will fetch a morsel of bread and
[22:30] comfort you your hearts and after that
[22:33] you shall pass on for therefore are you
[22:36] come to your servant.
[22:38] And they said
[22:40] so do as thou hast said.
[22:43] And Abraham hastened into the tent unto
[22:47] Sarah and said oh make ready uh quickly
[22:50] three measures of fine meal needed and
[22:53] make cakes upon the hearth.
[22:56] And Abraham
[22:58] at about a hundred years of age ran
[23:01] under the herd and fetched a calf tender
[23:03] and good, gave it to a young man, and he
[23:06] hasted to dress it. And Abraham took
[23:10] butter and milk and the calf which he
[23:13] had dressed and set it before them. And
[23:16] he stood by them under the tree, and
[23:19] they did eat.
[23:23] Abraham was taking the role of a servant
[23:25] to these travelers,
[23:27] standing by, waiting on them, not
[23:30] sitting and eating with them. And he
[23:33] told them he knew that's why they came.
[23:37] Now, you might be asking yourself,
[23:41] why did brother Lyall read that?
[23:44] I don't see any reference to worship.
[23:48] Okay, Caitlyn, are you paying attention
[23:50] here? We got a Hebrew word coming up.
[23:52] She's been doing a little bit with
[23:54] Hebrew lately. The Hebrew word here is
[23:57] shaka.
[23:58] I've circled it up here. It's it's from
[24:00] a maseretic text containing Genesis 22:5
[24:04] with the word which is translated as
[24:06] worship outline shaka.
[24:09] It it means
[24:11] to depress, to prostate, especially in
[24:15] homage to royalty or God. to bow, to
[24:17] crouch, to fall down, to beseech, to do
[24:20] obedience,
[24:22] worship.
[24:24] The word is variously translated as
[24:26] worship, bow down, prostrate,
[24:30] do obesence. Recall two weeks ago, the
[24:34] word for praise shares its root with the
[24:38] word for hand. And we often raise our
[24:40] hands when we praise the Lord.
[24:45] What other time might we raise our hands
[24:48] to show we're unarmed? To show we don't
[24:51] represent a threat. In some
[24:53] circumstances, it might be a sign of
[24:55] surrender.
[24:57] In ancient times, one bowed down to the
[25:00] king or ruler to prostrate oneself on
[25:03] the ground before him or her.
[25:10] And we read, "Abraham ran to meet them
[25:13] from the tent door and bowed himself."
[25:15] Shaka, the Hebrew word worship is
[25:18] translated here, bowed himself toward
[25:21] the ground. Describes the physical act
[25:24] associated with worship. If you're
[25:26] laying face down on the ground, you're
[25:28] displaying that you are subservient to
[25:30] the one before whom you lay. You're
[25:33] defenseless, completely at their mercy.
[25:38] In other words, the biblical concept of
[25:41] worship is that of complete,
[25:44] unconditional,
[25:46] total surrender.
[25:50] Another word we might use is submission.
[25:54] And in this case, the word shakah was
[25:56] translated and bowed himself.
[26:00] God demands complete surrender of our
[26:03] life, of our will to him.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; This is what worship means.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; We usually express it in hymns and songs
[26:14] rather than by physically bowing.
[26:17] Throughout the Old Testament, we
[26:19] constantly see a tie between worship and
[26:22] bowing to the ground and how the Lord
[26:25] reserves that relationship for himself.
[26:29] Let's jump ahead to Israel at Mount Si.
[26:33] Having left Egypt, Moses receives what
[26:35] we call the Ten Commandments. And how do
[26:37] they begin?
[26:40] Exodus 20
[26:42] verse one. God spake all these words,
[26:44] saying, I am the Lord thy God, which
[26:47] have brought thee out of the land of
[26:48] Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
[26:52] Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
[26:56] Now, some take verse three to mean that
[26:58] well, it's okay to have other deities as
[27:00] long as as long as Yahweh is the main
[27:03] one. You can have other kinds. It
[27:05] doesn't matter. He just doesn't want
[27:06] them before him.
[27:08] It's not what it means. That's taking it
[27:11] out of context. It's making excuses for
[27:14] sin.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
[27:21] Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
[27:24] image. I think we were talking about
[27:26] graven images the other day. Thou shalt
[27:28] not take under thee any graven image or
[27:30] any likeness of anything that is in
[27:33] heaven above or the earth beneath or the
[27:35] water under the earth.
[27:38] This was their background for hundreds
[27:40] of years in Egypt. These people had been
[27:43] in Egypt for generations
[27:46] and the general way in which gods were
[27:47] made and represented in that part of the
[27:49] world at that time. We know the story of
[27:50] the golden calf making animals, images
[27:53] of animals and worshiping, bowing down
[27:56] to them.
[27:58] He goes on, "Thou shalt not bow down.
[28:01] Thou shalt not shaka. Thou shalt not
[28:03] worship bow down thyself to them, nor
[28:06] serve them, for I, the Lord thy God, am
[28:10] a jealous God."
[28:14] You want to make me really mad?
[28:17] worship another god and see what
[28:19] happens. I'm a jealous God visiting the
[28:23] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[28:24] children to the third and fourth
[28:26] generation of them that hate me.
[28:29] You don't love me if you're bowing down
[28:31] to one of them and showing mercy unto
[28:35] thousands of them that love me and keep
[28:39] my commandments.
[28:41] Jesus would later say the same thing.
[28:42] He'd say, "If you love me, do what I
[28:45] say.
[28:48] God repeatedly warns the people to
[28:50] worship no other gods. Blessings if you
[28:54] obey, destruction if you ignore.
[28:58] Exodus 34, for example, verse 12, take
[29:01] heed to thyself, lest thou make a
[29:04] covenant with the inhabitants of the
[29:05] land whether thou goest, lest it be a
[29:08] snare in the midst of thee. Be careful
[29:12] of what they worship and their culture.
[29:15] But ye shall destroy their altars, break
[29:18] their images, cut down their groves,
[29:22] those graven images. For thou shalt
[29:25] worship, shaka, no other god. For the
[29:30] Lord whose name is jealous
[29:34] is a jealous God. Jealous. You want to
[29:38] make him angry? Serve another god.
[29:42] Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
[29:47] The last time the word shaka is used in
[29:50] the writings of Moses is in Deuteronomy
[29:54] chapter 30
[29:59] verse 15. See I have set before thee
[30:01] this day life and good or death and
[30:06] evil.
[30:08] In that I command thee this day to love
[30:12] the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways,
[30:16] to keep his commandments and his
[30:19] statutes and his judgments, that thou
[30:22] mayest live and multiply, and the Lord
[30:26] thy God shall bless thee in the land
[30:28] whether thou goest to possess it.
[30:32] But
[30:34] if thine heart turn away, so that thou
[30:36] wilt not hear, but shall be drawn away,
[30:41] and worship shaka, other gods, and serve
[30:45] them.
[30:47] I denounce unto you this day, that ye
[30:50] shall surely perish, and that you shall
[30:52] not prolong your days upon the land
[30:54] whether thou passest over Jordan to go
[30:56] to possess it. I call heaven and earth
[31:02] to record this day against you that I
[31:05] have set before you life and death,
[31:09] blessing and cursing. Therefore, choose
[31:14] life that both thou and thy seed may
[31:17] live. You have free will. There are
[31:21] consequences to your choices.
[31:25] This is the right choice.
[31:28] make it
[31:31] that thou mayest love the Lord thy God,
[31:35] and that thou mayest obey his voice, and
[31:38] that thou mayest cleave unto him, for he
[31:41] is thy life, and the length of thy days,
[31:45] that thou mayest dwell in the land which
[31:47] the Lord swear unto thy fathers, to
[31:50] Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
[31:54] to give them
[31:59] In the New Testament, which is written
[32:01] in Greek, there are at least three
[32:02] different words translated as worship.
[32:05] One is like the Hebrew to prostrate
[32:07] oneself. It's what Satan asked Jesus to
[32:10] do during the temptation in the
[32:11] wilderness. Matthew 4:es 9 and 10. This
[32:15] is the most common form of the word
[32:18] translated worship in Greek in the New
[32:20] Testament. Another is to adore or
[32:23] revere. Mark 7:7 might be an example of
[32:26] that. A third word means to give honor,
[32:30] such as when Jesus says, "If you're
[32:31] invited to a feast, take the lowest seat
[32:34] and let the guy that's running the
[32:35] place, if he wants to, ask you to come
[32:37] up higher and then you'll get worship
[32:39] from others." And in that case, he's
[32:42] he's uh he's talking about um uh
[32:47] he's not talking about worship like
[32:49] prostrating yourself, but you'll receive
[32:51] honor.
[32:54] Those are the three sort of Greek words
[32:57] that are used.
[32:59] Well,
[33:01] let's go back to our opening verses
[33:03] story of Abraham.
[33:06] One thing I'd like you to notice in
[33:08] Abraham's worship of the three men.
[33:12] Abraham served them.
[33:14] He took on the role of servant.
[33:18] He didn't sit and eat with them. He
[33:21] served them, stood by, attended to any
[33:25] need or desire they might have.
[33:29] We so often come to God with lists of
[33:32] things we want him to do for us.
[33:35] We often treat him like our servant, a
[33:38] tool in our toolbox for when it's
[33:40] convenient for us to call upon him to
[33:42] ask for things. Lord, I need healing.
[33:46] He's the healer.
[33:48] Lord, I can't pay my bills. Lord, I
[33:50] can't do anything.
[33:53] Abraham wasn't asking for anything. He
[33:57] was asking how he might serve them. A
[34:01] man about a hundred years old.
[34:04] If I found your favor, stop here on your
[34:07] journey. Here, sit under the shade tree.
[34:10] Let me get some water, wash your feet.
[34:13] I'll prepare the best, freshest foods I
[34:15] can for you while you rest. I'm here to
[34:18] serve you. That's why you came to me for
[34:21] me to serve.
[34:24] We need to be careful that we
[34:29] I'm pointing at myself are in our proper
[34:32] place.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Notice another thing. Abraham saw three
[34:38] men nearby and he addressed them as
[34:42] Lord,
[34:45] as the Almighty God.
[34:48] He recognized that even though this was
[34:50] a very unusual meeting, he saw it was
[34:53] God in all of it.
[34:56] Many years later, there was another
[34:59] meeting in what we call the upper room,
[35:04] an event we call the last supper.
[35:08] Jesus had just finished washing the feet
[35:13] of his disciples,
[35:15] including the feet of Judas's chariot.
[35:21] Footnote sidebar, be careful during
[35:23] communion, footwashing. I don't want to
[35:25] wash that guy's feet. He Jesus washed
[35:29] Judah's feet knowing who Judas was.
[35:33] He then sat down and addressed the
[35:37] group. Notice whenever Jesus sits down
[35:39] and starts talking, in almost every
[35:41] case, he's teaching.
[35:44] Sometimes with parables, sometimes with
[35:46] examples,
[35:48] always more than the simple story or
[35:50] act, but using them to illustrate a
[35:52] greater truth. Let's listen for a
[35:55] moment. John John 13.
[36:01] You call me master. This means teacher
[36:04] or instructor
[36:06] and lord supreme in authority.
[36:10] And you say, 'Well, for so I am.
[36:15] If I, then, your lord and master, have
[36:18] washed your feet, you also ought to wash
[36:22] one another's feet. For I have given you
[36:25] an example that you should do as I have
[36:27] done to you.
[36:29] Now we're having communion services this
[36:31] coming Sunday evening and we include a
[36:34] footwashing opportunity after communion.
[36:37] These verses are used at that time. We
[36:39] talk about instituting an ordinance or a
[36:41] sacrament, a a sacred service and it's
[36:44] appropriate and it's right and we should
[36:46] do that. But Jesus is talking about much
[36:49] more than instituting a ritual practice
[36:54] of washing feet.
[36:56] He says, "This is an example. I have
[36:59] given you an example, not the example."
[37:03] Right. At the last supper, the disciples
[37:05] didn't immediately jump up and start
[37:06] re-washing their feet. Right. Right.
[37:09] He's saying service. He's taking the
[37:12] lowest rank of servant, the footwash
[37:14] flunky. Brother Random says, to
[37:19] serve his students, his disciples, those
[37:22] that are following him. And now he is
[37:25] serving them in the lowest way that he
[37:27] can, including the one that he knows in
[37:31] a few hours is going to be responsible
[37:33] for betraying him and sending him off to
[37:36] torture and death.
[37:40] He's telling his followers that they
[37:42] ought to serve one another.
[37:47] He goes on, "Verily, verily, I say unto
[37:50] you, the servant is not greater than his
[37:54] Lord, neither he that is sent greater
[37:59] than he that sent him.
[38:01] If you know these things, happy are ye
[38:03] if you do them. Be content to serve one
[38:07] another.
[38:09] Find joy in service to others.
[38:13] But your motive needs to be correct, not
[38:17] just your actions.
[38:20] Further in that same chapter of John 13,
[38:22] Jesus says, "A new commandment I give
[38:25] unto you that you love one another."
[38:29] New
[38:32] way back way back in Moses' writings, it
[38:34] says, "Love your neighbor. Love your
[38:36] neighbor as yourself kind of thing."
[38:40] What what's new? that you love one
[38:43] another as I have loved you.
[38:47] That's what's new. That ye also love one
[38:51] another. By this shall all men know that
[38:55] you're my disciples. If you have this
[38:59] kind of love one to another,
[39:04] Paul explains it this way in Galatians
[39:07] chapter 5:13. Brethren,
[39:10] you've been called unto liberty.
[39:13] Only use not liberty for an occasion to
[39:15] the flesh.
[39:17] Choice,
[39:19] right? You have the ability to choose.
[39:23] But by love,
[39:25] serve one another.
[39:28] By love,
[39:30] serve one another. You might remember
[39:34] last time I spoke I mentioned the five
[39:36] love languages from Gary Chapman for our
[39:39] relationship with the Lord. Quality time
[39:42] represented by prayer. Words of
[39:44] affirmation by praise. Oh, now we see
[39:48] acts of service through our serving one
[39:50] another by what? Love.
[39:56] Jesus was consistent in his ministry
[39:59] regarding service to each other.
[40:02] After he came down from the mountain,
[40:04] what we call the mount of
[40:05] transfiguration, he had Peter, James,
[40:07] and John with him. Coming down the
[40:09] mountain, there was this this boy that
[40:11] was demonpossessed, foaming at the
[40:13] mouth, really in bad shape. And the
[40:16] other nine disciples that hadn't been
[40:18] invited to go up the mountain, couldn't
[40:20] help the child. They and and so Jesus
[40:24] healed the boy. And the disciples said,
[40:27] "How come we couldn't do this?"
[40:30] And Jesus said, "This kind of thing can
[40:32] only be delivered by prayer and fasting
[40:36] and fasting." And then they walked
[40:39] through Galilee towards Capernaum. In
[40:42] Mark 9, we read
[40:45] and Jesus came to Capernaum. And being
[40:48] in the house, he asked his disciples,
[40:51] "Oh, what was it that uh you guys
[40:54] disputed among yourselves? By the way, I
[40:56] heard you talking about something there.
[40:59] What uh what were you guys arguing
[41:01] about?
[41:03] Oops, he heard us. They held their
[41:05] peace. For by the way, they disputed
[41:08] among themselves
[41:11] who should be the greatest.
[41:16] Jesus sat down.
[41:19] Jesus sat down, called the twel, and
[41:23] saith unto them,
[41:25] "If any man desire to be first, the same
[41:28] shall be last of all, and servant of
[41:31] all."
[41:33] Sometimes you read that and you think,
[41:34] "Well, he's scolding him." You You want
[41:36] to be the the the the main guy here? Get
[41:39] to the back of the line. No, you not
[41:41] you. You get to the back of the line.
[41:43] It's not what he's saying.
[41:46] He's teaching. He's telling if you
[41:48] really if you really want to be great,
[41:51] if you really want to be among the
[41:53] greatest disciples, serve others.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Don't be served. Go to the back of the
[41:59] line. Serve others.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; That's where you'll find the great ones
[42:05] at the back of the line, not the front.
[42:09] He wasn't chewing them out. He's helping
[42:11] them understand God's perspective on
[42:14] what makes a person great.
[42:19] Later,
[42:21] James and John with a cooperation or
[42:24] maybe the instigation of their mom
[42:27] came to ask Jesus if they could sit next
[42:30] to him in his kingdom. Well, we want to
[42:32] be one of us on the right hand or one of
[42:33] us on the left. Look, there was three of
[42:35] us went up to Mount Transfiguration.
[42:37] That's Peter. No, James. We're we're
[42:39] we're brothers. We're we're we're blood.
[42:41] We're closer here. So, we should sit
[42:42] next to you, right? Right. We're gonna
[42:44] have that position.
[42:47] I'm sure Jesus rolled his eyes. Time to
[42:50] reinforce the lesson. Mark 10, we read,
[42:54] "And when the 10 heard it, they began to
[42:57] be much displeased with James and John."
[43:00] Yeah. Any humans here? Yeah. Yeah. Much
[43:04] displeased.
[43:06] Yeah. Oh, I remember that one guy that
[43:09] was the zealot, right? He might have
[43:11] started practicing a few moves for these
[43:13] guys. But Jesus called to them
[43:17] and said to them,
[43:20] "You know that they which are accounted
[43:22] to rule over the Gentiles exercise
[43:25] lordship over them, and their great ones
[43:28] exercise authority upon them." I imagine
[43:33] he was looking directly at James and
[43:35] John as he said this.
[43:38] But so it shall not be among you. That's
[43:41] not how God sees things. It's it it it
[43:44] reminds me of Samuel being sent to get
[43:47] the successor for Saul and looking for
[43:49] David. And and God tells Samuel, "Don't
[43:52] see as a man sees." God looks on the
[43:54] heart. God's perspective is different.
[43:58] But whosoever will be great among you
[44:01] shall be your minister. He'll serve you.
[44:04] In other words, whosoever of you will be
[44:06] the chiefest shall be the servant of
[44:08] all. It's the same lesson.
[44:12] For even now he uses himself his
[44:14] example. For even the son of man,
[44:17] speaking of himself, came not to be
[44:20] ministered unto but to minister to give
[44:23] his life a ransom for many.
[44:31] a ransom for many.
[44:35] There's an associated aspect of worship
[44:38] and that is sacrifice.
[44:43] In Old Testament times, there were
[44:45] strict rules regarding sacrifices.
[44:48] Excuse me, I'm an old man.
[44:53] Some were blood sacrifices.
[44:55] Which animals could be sacrificed? the
[44:57] condition of the animal, the conditions
[45:01] that had to be met, who could perform
[45:03] the act of sacrifice, the manner in
[45:06] which it must be done, the location
[45:09] where it must be done. Some sacrifices
[45:12] were not of blood, but of foods such as
[45:16] grain. Again, the rules were precise and
[45:20] strict.
[45:22] Some sacrifices were optional, free will
[45:24] offerings to God. Thanksgiving
[45:27] offerings. Others were required.
[45:31] Some, like a sin offering, were
[45:34] personal.
[45:35] Others, like the daily morning and
[45:37] evening sacrifices, were
[45:39] community-based.
[45:42] When you read the rules regarding
[45:44] sacrifices in the books of Moses, you'll
[45:46] find that there are other rules than the
[45:49] sacrificial animal or food.
[45:53] rules for priests.
[45:57] They have to be washed to wear certain
[45:59] garments to perform the sacrificial act
[46:01] in certain ways.
[46:03] But for the worshipper,
[46:05] the one bringing the sacrifice,
[46:08] in the case of personal blood
[46:11] sacrifices, the person bringing it
[46:14] usually has to place his hands on the
[46:16] head of the animal as it's killed at the
[46:20] entrance of the tabernacle.
[46:24] If the sacrifice is accepted and offered
[46:28] as prescribed,
[46:30] the worshipper is accepted. sin
[46:32] forgiven. For example, the priest did
[46:35] not examine the one bringing the
[46:37] sacrifice. The priest examined the
[46:41] sacrifice. If the sacrifice met the
[46:44] condition, you're in.
[46:50] The priest didn't quiz. Okay, you
[46:52] brought this animal. Now, uh you need to
[46:54] tell me the ten commandments in reverse
[46:56] order. Um uh let's see. I I need you to
[47:00] recite the rules regarding this. I
[47:04] didn't have to know various
[47:06] interpretations and doctrines and so
[47:08] forth. You just had to bring the
[47:10] sacrifice,
[47:12] bring the correct sacrifice and be
[47:14] identified with it, united if you will
[47:17] as it died.
[47:20] But there was another requirement. He
[47:23] had to be sincere.
[47:25] If just going through the motions, his
[47:27] heart's not in it. While the priest
[47:29] would accept it, the Lord would not. We
[47:32] see this throughout the history of
[47:34] Israel and Judah. David hints at it in
[47:37] uh Psalm 51.
[47:42] For thou desireest not sacrifice, else I
[47:45] would give it. Thou delightest not in
[47:48] burnt offering.
[47:50] The sacrifices of God are a broken
[47:53] spirit,
[47:55] a broken and a contrite heart. Oh God,
[47:58] thou wilt not despise.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; It's the first biatitude.
[48:04] Blessed are the poor in spirit for
[48:07] theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[48:10] As Christians,
[48:12] our blood sacrifice is Jesus Christ
[48:15] himself.
[48:16] So if we partake,
[48:19] we put our hands on the head of the
[48:21] sacrifice
[48:23] through sincere repentance,
[48:26] we'll be accepted
[48:28] because our sacrifice has been accepted.
[48:34] How is this possible?
[48:40] Let's look at a particular observance
[48:42] from Moses time.
[48:48] You may recall there are two seasons of
[48:50] feasts or festivals or celebrations
[48:52] prescribed in the law. The spring begins
[48:55] with Passover, the feast of unleavened
[48:58] bread, first fruits, and the feast of
[49:00] weeks, what we call Pentecost.
[49:04] The fall festivals begin with trumpets,
[49:07] then atonement, and tabernacles.
[49:11] The feast of trumpets is otherwise known
[49:13] as Rosha Shana, sometimes called Jewish
[49:16] New Year. It marks the new year on the
[49:19] civil calendar and it occurred last week
[49:22] on Monday. Some folks were at the house
[49:25] and we got out the chauffear and we blew
[49:28] it.
[49:30] Feast of trumpets. I'm not doing it here
[49:32] because I am not a trumpet player. I am
[49:35] not a musician. 10 days from trumpets to
[49:38] atonement. that period of time are known
[49:41] as the days of awe,
[49:43] days of reflection.
[49:45] For example, they blow the chauffear
[49:47] every day. They read Psalm 27 every day.
[49:50] You might want to consider reading Psalm
[49:51] 27. We won't read it here tonight.
[49:55] And the Day of Atonement,
[49:58] Yumkipur,
[49:59] is regarded as the holiest day on the
[50:03] Jewish religious calendar.
[50:07] This year, Yung Kipur started at sunset
[50:11] this evening. It just began.
[50:15] It will continue until sunset tomorrow
[50:18] evening.
[50:20] Jewish people will fast the entire time.
[50:25] I I can't help but remember a few
[50:28] significant yum kipurs in my life. In
[50:31] 1973,
[50:33] I was uh in the army with the 101st
[50:35] Airborne Division. And on that day, it
[50:38] was October 6th in 1973,
[50:41] the armies of Egypt crossed into Israel
[50:45] and the armies of Syria crossed into
[50:48] Israel. And it was a a a horrible
[50:52] bloodbath. Many, many, many uh people
[50:56] were killed. It was the highest holy
[50:58] day. Everybody was in synagogue.
[51:00] Everybody was fasting.
[51:03] And uh we were, you know, President
[51:05] Nixon activated the 101st Airborne
[51:08] Division. We were on the rotation to go
[51:10] and assist if that's what was required.
[51:13] I remember getting a phone call about
[51:14] 3:00 or 4 in the morning to get up, come
[51:16] into the base, roll out the Constantino
[51:18] wire, pack up your gear, get ready to
[51:20] load the helicopters on the C130s. We
[51:23] may be heading out. I I don't think I'll
[51:25] forget Yom Kipur of 1973.
[51:29] uh two others that I remember 2013
[51:31] that's the day my oldest brother died
[51:33] passed away on Yum Kipur and very
[51:37] exactly a year later on Yum Kipur of
[51:39] 2014 a very dear friend of mine brother
[51:41] Quinton Ericson in in Israel passed away
[51:45] anyway enough personal reflection
[51:50] answers the question
[51:53] of how we as Christians can be saved
[51:57] through the sacrifice of Jesus Jesus,
[52:00] the work he performed on Calvary.
[52:05] Leviticus chapter 16 is devoted to
[52:07] Yomkipor. It's a very unusual day.
[52:09] There's lots and lots of things going
[52:10] on. Let's read just three verses from
[52:13] Leviticus 16 verse 29. This shall be a
[52:19] statue forever unto you, that in the
[52:22] seventh month, on the 10th day of the
[52:25] month, you shall afflict your souls
[52:30] and do no work at all. Whether it be one
[52:33] of your own country or a stranger that
[52:35] sojourns among you. Doesn't matter if
[52:37] the person's a citizen of Israel or not.
[52:39] If they're in the land, they're doing
[52:40] this.
[52:43] There are certain things that the rabbis
[52:44] say that you must do and certain things
[52:47] that they say you must not do in order
[52:49] to afflict your souls. But the emphasis
[52:52] is on repentance.
[52:55] The action is to obease or chasen.
[52:59] It's in recognition of one's sins,
[53:03] genuine sorrow as we reflect on our
[53:05] shortcomings and failures and embrace
[53:07] his grace. And unlike other special
[53:10] days, this is the only command, the
[53:14] people's only command to afflict their
[53:17] souls. Do no work.
[53:20] What else happens?
[53:23] For on this day,
[53:25] who you each of us? No.
[53:31] On that day shall the priest
[53:33] make an atonement. Atonement at onement.
[53:37] We sometimes say the the root of this
[53:39] word means to cover.
[53:41] We'll make an atonement for you to
[53:43] cleanse you that ye may be clean from
[53:45] all your sins before the Lord.
[53:49] The priest, one guy, the day you're
[53:52] supposed to do no work, he's going to be
[53:53] working hard. And he's the only guy, one
[53:56] guy. And if he does his work correctly,
[54:00] all the sins of the nation are forgiven.
[54:04] One man, one sacrifice,
[54:07] all sins forgiven. It shall be a Sabbath
[54:10] of rest unto you. He shall afflict your
[54:13] souls by a statue forever.
[54:17] If you read the entire chapter, you'll
[54:19] see the person working on the Sabbath of
[54:21] rest is the high priest. He has a
[54:23] lengthy series of sacrifices. First on
[54:25] his behalf, then he has to wash himself.
[54:27] Then he has to change his clothes, and
[54:30] ultimately he enters the holy of holies.
[54:33] the only time he is allowed to enter the
[54:35] Holy of Holies. Otherwise, the penalty
[54:37] is death. And he's the only one that's
[54:40] allowed to enter to sprinkle blood on
[54:44] the mercy seat, the ark of testimony.
[54:47] And the net result is that the sins of
[54:49] the nations, the sins of all the people
[54:51] are forgiven.
[54:54] If the priest hes, he may die. The sins
[54:56] of the nation will not be forgiven.
[54:58] We're told a rope was tied to the high
[55:00] priest's leg or ankle so that if he
[55:02] failed and died that he could be removed
[55:05] from that holy place without anyone else
[55:06] attempting to go in to get him because
[55:09] they can't go in to get him. We had an
[55:12] example of of someone touching the ark
[55:14] when they shouldn't have when David
[55:15] tried to move it to Jerusalem. God had
[55:18] some pretty strict rules. Then
[55:23] Jesus is our high priest.
[55:26] He made an offering of himself
[55:30] to cleanse our sins.
[55:32] Reflecting the earlier practice of the
[55:34] Levitical high priest offering one
[55:36] sacrifice for the sins of all the
[55:38] people. Like the high priest on Yumipur,
[55:42] Jesus did all the work on our behalf.
[55:49] As the people of the earlier days had to
[55:51] afflict their souls, recognize and
[55:53] repent of their sins, so must we
[55:56] recognize and repent before Jesus
[55:59] sacrifice can cleanse us from our sins.
[56:04] Paul explains some of this at length in
[56:06] in his letter to the Hebrews. We won't
[56:09] dig into it tonight. Our topic is
[56:12] worship. But there is a sacrifice that
[56:16] Paul tells us we should make in that
[56:19] same letter to the Hebrews and it fits
[56:22] perfectly I think with this series on
[56:24] praise and worship. Hebrews 13
[56:28] verse 12.
[56:30] Wherefore Jesus also that he might
[56:33] sanctify the people with his own blood
[56:36] suffered without the gate. He died
[56:38] outside the city of Jerusalem.
[56:41] Let us go forth therefore unto him
[56:44] without outside beyond the limits of the
[56:47] camp bearing his reproach having taken
[56:50] on his name.
[56:53] Sunday we saw an example of that taking
[56:57] on his name being identified with
[57:00] Christ.
[57:02] Paul goes on here we have no continuing
[57:04] city. We seek one to come by him.
[57:09] Therefore, let us offer the sacrifice.
[57:13] Here it comes. The sacrifice we are to
[57:15] offer as Christians. The sacrifice of
[57:18] praise to God.
[57:23] How often? Only in church? No. Offered
[57:26] continually.
[57:28] That is the fruit of our lips, our
[57:31] voices giving thanks to his name.
[57:35] praise, thanksgiving,
[57:41] but to do good and to communicate,
[57:46] forget not. For with such sacrifices,
[57:49] God is well pleased. It's not just off
[57:52] in a corner by yourself. There has to be
[57:55] community involved.
[57:57] How do you communicate without
[57:59] community? How do you do good without
[58:02] community? In the letter to the Romans,
[58:06] Paul summarizes how we as Christians
[58:08] should act. I want to read chapter 12.
[58:12] It'll be our our closing set of
[58:14] scriptures for this evening.
[58:18] Paul says,
[58:19] "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
[58:23] the mercies of God, that you present
[58:26] your bodies a living sacrifice,
[58:30] holy,
[58:32] acceptable unto God,
[58:34] which is your reasonable service.
[58:38] This is not an unreasonable demand. This
[58:41] is worship
[58:45] surrendering by an act of free will to
[58:49] God.
[58:51] And in light of what Jesus did, Paul
[58:53] says, "It's reasonable for us to
[58:55] worship, to surrender in this way.
[58:59] Be not conformed to this world. be
[59:02] transformed
[59:04] by the renewing of your mind that you
[59:06] may prove what is that good and
[59:08] acceptable and perfect will of God.
[59:13] For I say through the grace given unto
[59:15] me to every man that is among you to not
[59:18] think of himself more highly than he
[59:20] ought to think.
[59:23] It's not about sitting on the right hand
[59:25] or the left hand, but to think soberly
[59:29] according as God has dealt to every man
[59:32] the measure of faith.
[59:36] Back to the biatitudes.
[59:38] Now Paul goes on to help us reach beyond
[59:41] ourselves, our personal walk with the
[59:44] Lord. We cannot isolate ourselves.
[59:47] For as we have many members
[59:50] &gt;&gt; in one body, and all members have not
[59:53] the same office,
[59:56] so we being many are one body in Christ,
[1:00:02] and everyone members one of another.
[1:00:08] We're inseparable.
[1:00:12] You can't separate yourself.
[1:00:16] having then gifts differing different
[1:00:19] gifts but they're not ranked well this
[1:00:20] is a better gift than that one and this
[1:00:22] is a
[1:00:24] they're they're different according to
[1:00:27] the grace the unmmerited favor that is
[1:00:31] given to us whether prophecy let us
[1:00:34] prophesy according to proportion of
[1:00:36] faith
[1:00:38] ministry let us wait on our ministering
[1:00:41] or or he that teaches unte teaching or
[1:00:45] he that exhorts an exhortation.
[1:00:49] He that gives,
[1:00:51] let him do it with simplicity.
[1:00:54] He that rules with diligence. He that
[1:00:58] shows mercy,
[1:01:00] forgives with cheerfulness.
[1:01:03] God loves a cheerful giver. The best
[1:01:05] thing you can give is forgiveness to
[1:01:07] another.
[1:01:08] Let love be without dissimilation,
[1:01:11] without hypocrisy, unfeigned.
[1:01:15] Don't act.
[1:01:17] Abore that which is evil. Cleave to that
[1:01:22] which is good.
[1:01:24] Be kindly affectionate one to another
[1:01:27] with brotherly love and honor,
[1:01:30] preferring one another.
[1:01:34] If you're going to fight over a place in
[1:01:35] line, fight for the back.
[1:01:38] Not soulful in business,
[1:01:41] fervent in spirit,
[1:01:43] serving the Lord,
[1:01:46] rejoicing in hope, patient in
[1:01:50] tribulation,
[1:01:52] continuing instant in prayer.
[1:01:56] Someone says, "I have this need. I have
[1:01:59] this problem." Don't say, "Well, I'll
[1:02:00] pray about it and hope that you
[1:02:01] remember." No. Be instant, continuing
[1:02:06] instant in prayer, distributing to the
[1:02:08] necessity of saints,
[1:02:11] given to hospitality.
[1:02:14] Can't you can't be a hermit. Bless them
[1:02:17] which persecute you. Bless and curse
[1:02:21] not.
[1:02:24] Back to the biatitudes.
[1:02:26] Rejoice with them that you rejoice
[1:02:29] and weep with them that weep.
[1:02:33] Be of the same mind one toward another.
[1:02:36] Mind not high things, but condescend to
[1:02:39] men of low estate.
[1:02:42] Be not wise in your own conceits.
[1:02:45] Recompense to no man evil for evil.
[1:02:49] Provide things honest in the sight of
[1:02:51] all men. If it be possible, as much as
[1:02:56] lith in you, live peaceably with all
[1:02:59] men.
[1:03:02] This seems to be a problem. So he goes
[1:03:04] into it a little bit here. Dearly
[1:03:05] beloved, avenge not yourselves. Rather
[1:03:07] give place unto wrath. It is written,
[1:03:10] "Vengeance is mine. I will repay,
[1:03:12] sayaeth the Lord. Therefore, if thine
[1:03:14] enemy hunger, feed him. If he thirst,
[1:03:16] give him drink." So doing thou shalt
[1:03:18] heap coals of fire on his head. That
[1:03:20] shouldn't be the reason you do it. Be
[1:03:23] not overcome of evil, but overcome evil
[1:03:27] with good
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; in love.
[1:03:32] Serve one another.
[1:03:34] By this will all men know that you're my
[1:03:38] disciples.
[1:03:41] If the
[1:03:43] musicians, our worship team would please
[1:03:46] come at this time. as they come. I hope
[1:03:49] you recognize that we are blessed by our
[1:03:52] musicians. Not just raw talent, but
[1:03:55] expressing the love of the Lord in their
[1:03:57] hearts through those talents, sharing
[1:04:01] service. They're the last to leave after
[1:04:04] service. They help set an atmosphere
[1:04:07] where we can set aside our problems, the
[1:04:10] worries, and issues and focus on the
[1:04:12] Lord. help us quieten our spirits and
[1:04:16] enter his presence. Frankly,
[1:04:19] I think their role was and is more
[1:04:22] important this evening than mine.
[1:04:25] I hope you remember from time to time to
[1:04:29] thank them individually,
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; encourage them
[1:04:34] in love, serving one another.
[1:04:39] I had thought of three different songs
[1:04:41] to close this portion of the service as
[1:04:43] we prepare to pass it over to our
[1:04:45] pastor, brother Daniel. But we'll
[1:04:47] throttle that back to to two.
[1:04:50] I'm no singer, you know that. But I love
[1:04:54] to sing about the Lord. So maybe on this
[1:04:56] first one, Brother Josiah could help me.
[1:05:01] It's a uh it's a recent song. I I give
[1:05:05] you my heart.
[1:05:16] This is my desire
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; to honor
[1:05:25] you.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, with all my heart
[1:05:34] I worship you.
[1:05:39] [Music]
[1:05:42] All I have within me,
[1:05:48] I give you
[1:05:51] praise.
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:05:54] All that I adore
[1:05:59] is in you.

[1:06:07] Lord, I give you my heart.
[1:06:11] I give you my soul.
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; I live for you alone.
[1:06:20] Every breath that I take,
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; every moment I'm away,
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, have your way in me.
[1:06:36] This is my desire,
[1:06:39] our desire
[1:06:40] to honor you, Lord, with all my heart, I
[1:06:46] worship you. My free will, I submit to
[1:06:49] you. All I have within me, I give you
[1:06:53] praise.
[1:06:55] All that I adore is in you, Lord. I give
[1:06:59] you my heart. I give you my soul.
[1:07:04] I live for you alone. Every breath that
[1:07:07] I take, every moment I'm awake, Lord,
[1:07:11] have your way in me. We sing that one
[1:07:15] more time.
[1:07:16] [Music]
[1:07:18] This is my desire
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; to honor
[1:07:27] you,
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Lord. With all my heart.
[1:07:36] I worship you.
[1:07:39] [Music]
[1:07:43] All I have within me,
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; I give you
[1:07:52] praise.
[1:07:55] All that I adore
[1:08:00] is in you,
[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Lord. I give you my heart.
[1:08:11] I give you my soul.
[1:08:14] [Music]
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; I live for you alone.
[1:08:20] Every breath that I take,
[1:08:24] every moment I'm awake,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, have your way in me.
[1:08:33] Every give you my heart.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; I give you my soul.
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:41] I live for you alone.
[1:08:46] Every breath that I take,
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; every moment I'm awake,
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, have your way. It be
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; the the second song is less recent. It
[1:09:07] was written in 1896.
[1:09:11] It's called I surrender all
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; to Jesus
[1:09:28] I surrender.
[1:09:31] All to him I freely
[1:09:37] give.
[1:09:39] I will ever love
[1:09:44] and trust him in his presence
[1:09:50] daily
[1:09:51] live.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; I surrender
[1:09:58] all.
[1:10:01] I surrender
[1:10:05] all.

[1:10:13] Savior.
[1:10:14] I surrender
[1:10:17] all.
[1:10:21] All to Jesus.
[1:10:24] I surrender.
[1:10:27] Humbly at his feet I bow.
[1:10:33] Worldly
[1:10:35] pleasures all forsen.
[1:10:40] Take me Jesus.
[1:10:43] Take me now.
[1:10:46] I surrender
[1:10:49] all.
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:52] I surrender
[1:10:55] all.
[1:10:58] All to thee. My blessed
[1:11:03] savior
[1:11:05] I surrender
[1:11:08] all
[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:11] and all to Jesus
[1:11:14] I surrender.
[1:11:18] Make me savior.
[1:11:21] Holy thine.
[1:11:24] Let me feel thy holy spirit.
[1:11:30] Truly know that thou art mine.
[1:11:37] I surrender
[1:11:40] all.
[1:11:43] I surrender
[1:11:46] all.
[1:11:49] All to thee, my blessed
[1:11:54] Savior.

[1:12:05] I surrender,
[1:12:08] Lord. I give myself
[1:12:12] to thee.
[1:12:14] Fill me with thy love and power. Let thy
[1:12:21] blessing
[1:12:23] fall on me.

[1:12:48] all.
[1:12:51] All to Jesus.
[1:12:54] I surrender.
[1:12:57] Now I feel the sacred flame.
[1:13:03] Oh, the joy of full salvation.
[1:13:10] Glory,
[1:13:11] glory
[1:13:13] to his name.
[1:13:16] I surrender
[1:13:19] all.
