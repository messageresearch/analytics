[46:00] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[46:02] letting him be manifested and growing
[46:04] you amen
[46:06] heal me o lord and i will be healed
[46:09] let's read a scripture in from
[46:12] philippians
[46:15] chapter 4 6 7 and 8.
[46:19] this morning i had several requests
[46:22] texts to me and uh
[46:26] asking for prayer and scripture of the
[46:29] day
[46:30] [Music]
[46:32] an app on the phone and one on the
[46:34] computer and
[46:36] open it up and it's it's good to read
[46:38] the word of god
[46:40] the next page you flip on the computer
[46:42] or the next we open may be some bad news
[46:46] but god's word is good news all the time
[46:49] philippians 4 verses 6 through 8.
[46:52] [Music]
[46:54] if they'll put that up there
[46:58] [Music]
[47:01] it says be careful for nothing but in
[47:03] everything by prayer and supplication
[47:05] with thanksgiving let your requests be
[47:08] made known to god
[47:09] being careful for nothing be don't be
[47:11] worried don't be anxious don't don't
[47:13] don't get to the point where you're
[47:15] you're frozen you're stiff you can't you
[47:16] don't know how to go forward
[47:18] but he says you know give god praise
[47:21] give god thanks
[47:22] and the peace of god which passes all
[47:24] understanding
[47:26] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[47:28] to christ jesus
[47:30] then paul says this finally brethren
[47:32] whatsoever things are true
[47:34] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[47:36] things are just whatsoever things are
[47:38] pure
[47:39] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[47:42] things
[47:43] are of good report if there be any
[47:45] virtue any way
[47:46] to re receive strength from and if there
[47:49] be any praise
[47:50] think on these things and sometimes we
[47:54] we get to and and we're all the same
[47:57] we feel pain we feel hurts and and so it
[47:59] affects us
[48:01] but if we as quickly as we can we take
[48:03] god's word and say
[48:05] let's apply god's word to the situation
[48:07] so we have some requests to
[48:10] to bring to your attention and
[48:14] our sister tony
[48:18] just asking her prayer for her brother
[48:20] david he's an icu
[48:22] with a weak heart and fluid in his lungs
[48:26] spoke to brother rome as as we were he
[48:30] was coming in he's got a doctor's
[48:31] appointment too
[48:33] she's been having some pains and things
[48:34] and they're looking there and then
[48:37] spent some time with dad and mom
[48:38] yesterday and dad's going to go in for
[48:40] an mri
[48:40] of his back it's been doctors have not
[48:44] been able to find some of the causes
[48:47] the blood test and everything you've
[48:48] done recently have been perfect been
[48:50] fine no issues but there are some things
[48:51] going on
[48:52] so sister glide will ask us to remember
[48:56] her daughter sister rachel says
[48:59] special prayer requests so we know god
[49:01] is mindful
[49:02] that's her statement we know god over
[49:05] and over
[49:06] he's proved that to us
[49:10] and then brother robert figured i sent a
[49:12] text this morning about seven o'clock
[49:15] and he had asked prayer during this week
[49:18] sister dalia was going to be
[49:19] back in the hospital with the
[49:22] you know the diabetes they had done
[49:24] surgery on her legs and all
[49:26] and there were some complications so she
[49:28] was this week there and this morning
[49:30] she was in a lot of pain so he called
[49:32] the doctor and they asked her
[49:34] to take her back to the hospital so i
[49:36] believe there at tmc this morning and he
[49:38] requested prayer
[49:39] so i told him we would do that
[49:43] it has been uh if you hear brother
[49:46] branham
[49:46] quite often he said diabetes that ugly
[49:49] disease
[49:50] he called it not that there's a good
[49:52] disease but he just how he how he would
[49:54] identify it
[49:56] but he never said it's too great for god
[49:59] it's too much
[50:00] he said i am the lord god that healeth
[50:02] thee so
[50:05] and continue to remember brother daniel
[50:07] freijo in prayer
[50:11] uh sister karen had put a posted
[50:14] good news and then we read wednesday
[50:17] night
[50:18] doctors told him about six weeks of
[50:20] therapy
[50:21] and he would be able to walk again but i
[50:24] know a god
[50:26] i met him personally he's my god lord
[50:28] and savior
[50:29] and he said rise up and walk and right
[50:32] then and there
[50:33] took him by and then he shows that he's
[50:35] still the same yesterday
[50:37] yesterday today and forever because
[50:38] peter and john are walking over to the
[50:40] temple
[50:41] and peter turned around john says such
[50:42] as i have i give unto thee
[50:44] in the name of lord jesus christ rise up
[50:46] and walk so
[50:47] because he's still the same and then
[50:51] my wife received a text from
[50:54] sister grant most of you here have been
[50:57] wild sister litha grant
[50:59] she's been she requested prayer she's
[51:02] been
[51:02] diagnosed with cancer in the stomach she
[51:05] has to
[51:06] we can't began chemo soon and is
[51:09] trusting the lord
[51:11] her times and seasons are in his hands
[51:13] so
[51:15] the chemotherapy would they said would
[51:18] start this coming week i believe
[51:20] what she said to my wife and the doctor
[51:22] told her she's going to experience a lot
[51:24] of fatigue and
[51:25] things but they're still the doctor we
[51:28] talked to
[51:28] if you'll stand with me
[51:32] there there's a peace and a rest
[51:35] and a comfort beyond our understanding
[51:39] beyond our reasoning that god is more
[51:41] than able
[51:43] god has a reason and a time and a season
[51:45] for all things
[51:47] we rest in that saying lord i believe
[51:50] and sometimes we have to raise the other
[51:52] hand it says lord help my unbelief
[51:54] but god is mindful of us let's just pray
[51:56] lord we
[51:58] we've read these requests and
[52:01] you weren't listening and saying oh my i
[52:03] didn't know that i wasn't aware of that

[54:46] in this time
[54:48] as we seek the will of the lord take to
[54:51] my time in prayer
[54:52] trusting in god that what he has for us
[54:55] is best i know sometimes we get anxious
[54:59] we anticipate we want to go but
[55:02] waiting on the lord we shall re renew
[55:04] our strength
[55:05] trust that we have brother dennis
[55:07] mcgeary with us this morning and
[55:09] his wife is here with them and i i
[55:12] remind you
[55:13] god saw this day so god set it up
[55:17] so god had you in mind this morning so
[55:19] receive what the lord has for you
[55:22] as you draw the lord has placed
[55:24] something on brother dennis's heart
[55:26] maybe brother dennis said lord why this
[55:30] but it's what god has has placed in his
[55:32] heart so as he comes let's
[55:34] he'll be here also this evening with us
[55:36] so
[55:38] how many just know that god is mindful
[55:40] of you
[55:42] say lord what i have need if sometimes
[55:43] he comes out and says you know i need to
[55:44] deal with this about with you
[55:47] and lord that wasn't what i thought i
[55:49] needed but god knows best so
[55:51] i appreciate that i was brother peter
[55:53] was standing there with jonas and
[55:56] in the hallway and i said you know i had
[55:58] we had six daughters
[56:00] and when you got what you thought one
[56:01] train the next one came and the next one
[56:03] came and
[56:04] it took a little bit of time i said but
[56:06] you'll get past it it'll be all right
[56:08] and sometimes we say lord again you'll
[56:11] get you'll get through
[56:12] god is so good to us so amazing grace
[56:15] how sweet the sound
[56:16] it saved a wretch like me and it still
[56:19] keeps me
[56:23] in grace
[56:30] [Music]
[56:37] like me
[56:42] i once was lost
[56:53] i was
[56:58] let's praise him let's praise him
[57:00] [Music]
[57:10] praise
[57:17] praise god praise god
[57:26] praise god praise god
[57:42] [Music]
[57:47] god bless you this morning it's a real
[57:50] privilege to be in the house of the lord
[57:52] and
[57:53] to be with you this morning
[57:56] i wondered just before we
[58:00] read our scripture this morning if you'd
[58:02] like to just keep playing sister so
[58:04] enjoy the music and just want to commit
[58:08] this portion
[58:12] of the service into his hands
[58:15] we've worshipped him in song and
[58:17] [Music]
[58:20] heard a lovely special now we want to
[58:24] worship him in his word
[58:27] but before we turn to his word how could
[58:31] we approach it without
[58:33] asking for his help so let's just bow
[58:37] our heads
[58:42] lord jesus it's so wonderful to see your
[58:45] saints
[58:47] this morning lord
[58:53] to see some battle-scarred veterans lord
[58:58] [Music]
[59:00] to see mothers lord and if
[59:04] given their lives for
[59:08] to see young men
[59:13] to see lovely young girls lord
[59:18] all these precious hearts have come
[59:22] to hear from you lord
[59:24] [Music]
[59:25] father we could probably fellowship one
[59:28] with another
[59:32] gain some great insights and get help
[59:35] and encouragement from one another lord
[59:38] but
[59:43] many have a lot to bring to the table
[59:45] lord a lot to offer the family
[59:49] a lot of good counsel and we love that
[59:52] lord
[59:54] but what we came this morning for lord
[59:57] is
[59:58] for what you bring to the table lord
[1:00:00] [Music]
[1:00:02] we look for you lord
[1:00:07] maybe one would say to another is is
[1:00:09] so-and-so gonna be there
[1:00:15] lord if someone said well jesus is going
[1:00:18] to be there
[1:00:18] oh lord we'd look
[1:00:22] for what you'd have to say lord
[1:00:25] that's where we are this morning lord we
[1:00:27] look for what you'd have to say and we
[1:00:30] pray
[1:00:31] that you'd come now and take preeminence
[1:00:35] for we love you lord and we ask it in
[1:00:38] your name
[1:00:40] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:00:44] amen god bless you this morning if you'd
[1:00:46] like to turn in your bibles
[1:00:48] if you have them we'd like to thank you
[1:00:52] musicians and
[1:01:00] i'd like to turn in uh saint john the
[1:01:02] second chapter
[1:01:05] and we'd like to read a few verses very
[1:01:08] familiar scripture when jesus came to
[1:01:10] the temple
[1:01:12] and he braided three cords and
[1:01:15] if we could in our mind eyes imagine
[1:01:18] that the people
[1:01:20] in their normal way of
[1:01:24] serving god and you know like they came
[1:01:26] to church all the time
[1:01:28] but one day something quite
[1:01:32] unexpected happened and jesus began to
[1:01:36] drive
[1:01:37] all of the sellers out of the temple
[1:01:40] like he owned the place
[1:01:42] and you know we think well jesus had a
[1:01:44] right to do that
[1:01:46] so in our mind's eye we but put yourself
[1:01:50] in their place
[1:01:51] they didn't know him from adam and they
[1:01:54] thought well who
[1:01:55] is this man what in the world is going
[1:01:59] on here
[1:02:01] and so the
[1:02:05] the jews said
[1:02:08] in verse 18 then answered the jews and
[1:02:12] said unto him what
[1:02:14] sign show us thou unto us seeing that
[1:02:17] thou doest these things and jesus
[1:02:20] answered and said unto them destroy
[1:02:24] this temple and in three days
[1:02:27] i will raise it up then said the jews
[1:02:31] 40 in six years was this temple
[1:02:35] in building and wilt thou rear it up in
[1:02:38] three days
[1:02:41] but he spake of the temple of his body
[1:02:45] when therefore he was risen from the
[1:02:47] dead his disciples remembered that he
[1:02:49] had said this unto them
[1:02:51] and they believed the scriptures and the
[1:02:53] word which
[1:02:54] jesus had said now when he was in
[1:02:57] jerusalem at the passover in the feast
[1:03:00] day many believed his name
[1:03:03] when they saw the miracles which he did
[1:03:07] but jesus did not commit himself unto
[1:03:10] them
[1:03:11] because he knew all men
[1:03:16] and needed not that any should testify
[1:03:19] of man
[1:03:21] for he knew what was in
[1:03:24] man may the lord bless his word you may
[1:03:27] be seated
[1:03:36] so the bible says that he knew
[1:03:39] what was in man
[1:03:42] and i think as believers and people that
[1:03:45] have
[1:03:46] read their bibles and gone to church for
[1:03:49] many years we have a revelation that
[1:03:51] god knows all things we know that he's
[1:03:55] omnipotent and we know that if he
[1:03:59] is god then he he has to know and he's
[1:04:02] not
[1:04:03] learning he's not gaining any knowledge
[1:04:06] but
[1:04:07] he knew and i had the opportunity to
[1:04:11] talk to two muslim men
[1:04:13] and very simple subject i said did god
[1:04:16] does god know who's going to heaven
[1:04:20] and they said well of course he does and
[1:04:22] i said well then when did he know that
[1:04:26] and when we started on that subject we
[1:04:29] had to go to predestination and
[1:04:32] so i think the omnipotence of god is
[1:04:34] something that
[1:04:38] turn it on
[1:04:43] okay excuse me
[1:04:47] thank you
[1:04:51] it's something that we know very well
[1:04:54] that god knows
[1:04:55] all things and even though it's hard for
[1:04:59] us to imagine
[1:05:00] the prophet of god said that he knows
[1:05:04] every gnat and how many times it would
[1:05:06] blink its eyes and how much
[1:05:08] tallow it would produce and in our mind
[1:05:12] that's it's very hard for us to wrap our
[1:05:14] minds
[1:05:16] around god being all-knowing
[1:05:20] and man in his
[1:05:23] uh feeble attempts to be like
[1:05:26] god he's building big warehouses so that
[1:05:30] uh some lady in brazil can keep the
[1:05:34] picture of her
[1:05:35] cat in storage
[1:05:38] and however many pixels that is but
[1:05:41] this is what man's doing if you think
[1:05:43] that now everybody in china
[1:05:45] also wants their photographs of their
[1:05:48] grandchildren
[1:05:49] their dog their
[1:05:52] art project that they made everybody
[1:05:54] wants to keep
[1:05:56] a remembrance of this and so
[1:06:00] man is trying to fulfill that
[1:06:04] and if you pay a few dollars a month
[1:06:07] you can have just about unlimited
[1:06:10] storage
[1:06:11] so so we can begin
[1:06:15] to kind of get a concept of it in modern
[1:06:17] times
[1:06:19] and this idea of god
[1:06:22] knowing as we have served the lord and
[1:06:26] been in church we we begin to understand
[1:06:29] that
[1:06:30] and brother brown said that if you were
[1:06:31] aware of the presence of the lord
[1:06:34] you wouldn't sin
[1:06:37] you know it it's it's if if we were more
[1:06:40] conscious
[1:06:41] of him but i think many times our
[1:06:44] consciousness
[1:06:45] is kind of a intellectual concept that
[1:06:49] we know
[1:06:50] that god knows all things and so
[1:06:53] we read the scripture this morning
[1:06:55] because in verse 25
[1:06:57] it says and he needed not that any
[1:06:59] should testify of man
[1:07:01] for he knew what was in man
[1:07:07] and he knows what's in us and scofield
[1:07:10] in this scripture
[1:07:12] he made a reference to samuel how that
[1:07:14] when the prophet of samuel
[1:07:16] went to choose the next king when god
[1:07:19] rejected saul
[1:07:20] he went to his house and he said uh
[1:07:23] you know show me the family and they
[1:07:25] went through each one of the sons
[1:07:28] and god
[1:07:31] rejected all of the sons that looked
[1:07:34] like they would be a good candidate to
[1:07:36] be the next king of israel
[1:07:38] and the prophet said you look on the
[1:07:41] outward appearance of man
[1:07:44] but god looketh on the heart and so he
[1:07:47] saw
[1:07:48] in david a heart that loved
[1:07:52] [Music]
[1:07:54] god
[1:07:57] and that's the part of us
[1:08:01] that we think about
[1:08:04] most but if you'll bear with me this
[1:08:07] morning
[1:08:08] if we would think about jesus
[1:08:12] saying destroy this temple
[1:08:18] the next verse it says then the
[1:08:21] disciples knew that he spoke of the
[1:08:23] temple of his body
[1:08:27] the lord to help us this morning we'd
[1:08:28] like to speak about what is
[1:08:30] man and
[1:08:34] if you'd like to go with me you don't
[1:08:38] have to but in
[1:08:39] we're going to read something that paul
[1:08:41] quoted
[1:08:43] in hebrews
[1:08:47] and in hebrews chapter 2 he quoted this
[1:08:51] verse out of psalms and we're going to
[1:08:54] read the verses around it's
[1:08:57] psalms 8 and 3.
[1:09:04] when i consider the heavens and the work
[1:09:06] of thy fingers
[1:09:07] the moon and the stars which thou hast
[1:09:10] ordained
[1:09:13] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[1:09:17] and the son of man that thou visitest
[1:09:20] him
[1:09:23] for thou has made him a little lower
[1:09:25] than the angels and has crowned him with
[1:09:27] glory and honor
[1:09:29] thou madest him to have dominion over
[1:09:32] the works of thy hands thou hast
[1:09:35] put all things under his feet all sheep
[1:09:38] and oxen yay and the beast of the field
[1:09:42] the fowls of the air and the fish of the
[1:09:44] sea and whatever passes
[1:09:46] through the paths of the seas
[1:09:49] oh lord our lord how excellent
[1:09:52] is thy name in all the earth so
[1:09:56] david was looking out at the universe he
[1:09:59] could look at the stars
[1:10:01] he could look out at the greatness of
[1:10:03] god's creation
[1:10:05] you know they they say they can see a a
[1:10:08] hundred
[1:10:09] light years of space maybe even more now
[1:10:13] but in light travels at
[1:10:16] 8 000 miles per second i think is
[1:10:21] close to being right so
[1:10:25] david looked out at how great god's
[1:10:27] creation was
[1:10:30] and he thought what is man
[1:10:36] looking at at how great your works are
[1:10:39] what is
[1:10:39] what is man that that that those thou
[1:10:42] are mindful of them or the son of man
[1:10:44] that
[1:10:46] that thou visitest him
[1:10:51] and why would he use that expression the
[1:10:53] son of man because
[1:10:57] you know there's another place in the
[1:10:58] scripture that says man that's born of a
[1:11:00] woman is
[1:11:02] uh a few days and full of trouble
[1:11:06] well well what man isn't born of woman
[1:11:08] well there was only one that was
[1:11:10] adam and uh
[1:11:14] uh we're gonna go there in just a minute
[1:11:16] so
[1:11:17] it's an expression that you know a son
[1:11:20] of man it's just a it's a it's a it's a
[1:11:22] man born
[1:11:23] into this world like every other man
[1:11:26] and and paul is saying you know
[1:11:29] what is he that thou art mindful of him
[1:11:33] and
[1:11:34] like you'd also read a little something
[1:11:36] in ecclesiastes
[1:11:40] where
[1:11:44] solomon was commenting on the estate of
[1:11:47] man and he said
[1:11:50] i said in my heart concerning the estate
[1:11:54] of the sons of man that god might
[1:11:57] manifest them
[1:11:58] and that they might see that they
[1:12:01] themselves
[1:12:02] are beast for that which befalleth the
[1:12:07] sons of
[1:12:08] men befalleth the beast
[1:12:12] this is ecclesiastics 3 and 18
[1:12:17] for which for that which befalleth the
[1:12:21] sons of men
[1:12:22] befalleth beast even one thing befalleth
[1:12:26] them
[1:12:27] as the one dieth so dieth the other
[1:12:31] yea they have all one breath
[1:12:34] so that man hath no preeminence over
[1:12:38] a beast for all his vanity
[1:12:41] all go unto one place all
[1:12:44] are of the dust and all
[1:12:48] turn to the dust again
[1:12:52] isn't that a striking thing and we don't
[1:12:55] think of ourselves as dust but the truth
[1:12:59] is
[1:13:00] that we are and we
[1:13:05] in the book of genesis when we
[1:13:09] consider what man is and
[1:13:13] how man came to be
[1:13:16] we find out that we're just so much of
[1:13:20] about six common elements some of the
[1:13:23] most
[1:13:24] common elements in all creation carbon
[1:13:27] and
[1:13:27] oxygen we're about 50 water and then
[1:13:30] we're
[1:13:31] you know five percent calcium and you
[1:13:34] know if you just see
[1:13:35] one of these dirt trucks driving down
[1:13:37] the road
[1:13:38] that truck's worth hundreds of times
[1:13:42] the value of what you are if we were to
[1:13:45] trade you in or get you back
[1:13:47] to your original elements
[1:13:52] and it's a very strange thing because we
[1:13:54] never think of ourselves like that
[1:13:57] we never think of ourselves as dust but
[1:14:00] it was
[1:14:00] recorded in god's word for some divine
[1:14:04] purpose of how
[1:14:06] man was created and in genesis 1
[1:14:10] we'll just rehearse these things to you
[1:14:12] uh
[1:14:17] in genesis 1 and 26
[1:14:23] god said let us make man in our image
[1:14:26] after our likeness and let them have
[1:14:29] dominion over the fish
[1:14:31] in the sea and over the fowls of the air
[1:14:33] and over the cattle and over the
[1:14:35] all the earth and over every creeping
[1:14:37] thing that creepeth upon the earth
[1:14:40] so god created man in his own image
[1:14:43] in the image of god created he him male
[1:14:46] and female created he them well you say
[1:14:49] brother dennis no dust there
[1:14:52] well we're not talking about dust man
[1:14:54] here
[1:14:55] we're talking about spirit man
[1:14:58] this theophany man that was in
[1:15:01] god's image this was the form that
[1:15:05] god was in we know that god
[1:15:08] filled all space in eternity and he
[1:15:11] just began to take a form towards
[1:15:14] man and he he was in this light
[1:15:19] that they called the logos and it was
[1:15:22] god
[1:15:23] taking the form and brother brown called
[1:15:25] that the theophany of god and then
[1:15:27] he said that when he created man
[1:15:32] he created him in his image and
[1:15:35] and male and female created he them that
[1:15:38] was spirit man so
[1:15:41] that
[1:15:46] spirit man
[1:15:52] ruled over the brooded over the earth
[1:15:58] and brother branham talked about the
[1:16:01] spirit of god
[1:16:03] brooding over the earth before he commit
[1:16:06] commanded adam and eve and he brought
[1:16:10] forth life and he brought forth a little
[1:16:13] greater life and he kept bringing
[1:16:16] greater life by brooding over
[1:16:20] the earth and i thought
[1:16:24] wouldn't it be wonderful if the lord
[1:16:26] could brood over us this morning
[1:16:30] and because he's an evolutionist if he
[1:16:32] could brood over us and bring
[1:16:34] a little higher spiritual life to us
[1:16:37] brood over us this morning and bring us
[1:16:40] into a little higher
[1:16:42] form in this spirit man form that we've
[1:16:46] come to talk about at church
[1:16:49] we didn't come to talk about dust man
[1:16:52] but
[1:16:53] to get to where god wants us to be
[1:16:57] in this fellowship with him and to
[1:16:59] accept
[1:17:00] his thought that he's trying to express
[1:17:04] to us
[1:17:04] something he wants us to possess and we
[1:17:08] know that by the word of god we'll
[1:17:10] understand
[1:17:11] by a revelation of what reality
[1:17:15] really is we're going to overcome
[1:17:18] lies and and and falseness and
[1:17:22] false accu accusation the devil puts on
[1:17:25] you
[1:17:26] and and misguidings and we know in the
[1:17:29] bible that
[1:17:30] only those that had their names on the
[1:17:32] book of life before the foundation of
[1:17:34] the world
[1:17:35] only those will not be deceived and
[1:17:38] not take the mark of the beast and all
[1:17:41] the rest of them will be deceived
[1:17:44] and so what's going to keep us from
[1:17:46] committing ourselves to man remember how
[1:17:48] jesus said he said he's not going to
[1:17:50] commit himself to that
[1:17:51] he's not going to come into that arena
[1:17:55] of man's uh approval and man's
[1:17:59] acclamation and all what man thinks is
[1:18:02] great and what
[1:18:03] man thinks his vindication of his
[1:18:06] righteousness and a vindication that he
[1:18:09] did the right thing that he
[1:18:10] took the right job that he got the right
[1:18:12] degree that he
[1:18:14] did good and he got approval and he came
[1:18:17] into this social atmosphere whether it
[1:18:19] be the church
[1:18:20] the school wherever and to get man's
[1:18:23] approval and to say hey this
[1:18:25] makes me who i am this makes me
[1:18:29] right or just
[1:18:36] jesus wasn't going to go there because
[1:18:39] he had
[1:18:40] a divine purpose
[1:18:43] and he didn't need that and you don't
[1:18:46] need that
[1:18:47] because you have a divine purpose you
[1:18:50] have no
[1:18:51] less commission than john the baptist
[1:18:53] when the angel said to him
[1:18:55] to zacharias you're going to have a son
[1:18:57] in your old age
[1:18:59] and his name's going to be john
[1:19:04] and he's going to do this and he's going
[1:19:06] to
[1:19:07] this is going to be his life this is
[1:19:09] going to be his purpose
[1:19:10] this is going to be his ministry and all
[1:19:14] the friends and family came around when
[1:19:15] he was born and wanted to argue about
[1:19:17] what his name was
[1:19:18] and zachariah being muted
[1:19:23] he had to ask for a patent say his name
[1:19:26] is
[1:19:26] john already
[1:19:29] and god knew your name before anybody
[1:19:32] chose it he
[1:19:33] he knew all about you and the purpose
[1:19:36] that he brought you
[1:19:37] this far is that he wanted fellowship
[1:19:41] with you
[1:19:44] he just wanted it like it was at the
[1:19:47] garden when he came down and he
[1:19:49] in the cool of the evening he could talk
[1:19:52] to adam and eve and there was nothing
[1:19:55] between
[1:19:57] there was nothing to hinder there was
[1:20:00] nothing
[1:20:02] no insufficiencies ineptness
[1:20:10] oh god help us this morning to come
[1:20:13] into the fellowship that he wants with
[1:20:17] us and the way he's helping us to get
[1:20:20] there is by expressing his thoughts
[1:20:23] through his word
[1:20:28] and a lot of times somehow
[1:20:31] we're reading his word and let it go
[1:20:34] right over the top of us
[1:20:37] how do we know that happens because some
[1:20:41] years later
[1:20:42] we see the picture and we go oh my
[1:20:45] goodness
[1:20:47] now i hope today that you'll never use
[1:20:50] that expression
[1:20:51] my goodness off the cuff again
[1:20:56] without thinking what is my goodness
[1:21:00] now so here was spirit man but
[1:21:05] in verses
[1:21:09] 2 and 7 let's go a little bit
[1:21:12] above that
[1:21:18] verse 5 it said for the lord god had
[1:21:22] not caused it to rain on the earth and
[1:21:24] there was no
[1:21:25] and there was not a man
[1:21:28] to till the ground so he had this garden
[1:21:31] in eden but he had no gardener
[1:21:35] and there was no man to till the ground
[1:21:38] and the lord formed man of the dust of
[1:21:41] the ground
[1:21:43] and breathed into his nostrils the
[1:21:45] breath of life
[1:21:47] and man became a living soul
[1:22:01] in verse
[1:22:04] 1 and 24 speaking of
[1:22:08] animals and
[1:22:12] and god said let the earth bring forth
[1:22:14] the living creature after his kind
[1:22:17] cattle and creeping things and beast of
[1:22:20] the earth
[1:22:21] after his kind and it was so
[1:22:25] and god made the beast of the earth
[1:22:28] after his kind the cattle after their
[1:22:30] kind and everything that creepeth on the
[1:22:32] earth
[1:22:32] after its kind and god saw
[1:22:35] that it was good he made the animals
[1:22:40] out of the same materials
[1:22:44] that he made us
[1:22:49] and it's astounding
[1:22:52] that
[1:22:57] when you think of this and you can get
[1:23:00] so anointed with these thoughts i
[1:23:02] was preaching last sunday in
[1:23:06] in phoenix and and stopped at a rest
[1:23:08] stop and this little lizard came up
[1:23:10] on the post and having studied these
[1:23:14] things and kind of meditated on these
[1:23:16] things
[1:23:19] it's almost as if the the lizard came up
[1:23:23] real close to me and
[1:23:25] you know it was kind of like good
[1:23:26] morning little buddy
[1:23:29] and if the lizard could talk he'd say
[1:23:31] well you know i like your
[1:23:33] carbon i like the way the god did carbon
[1:23:36] and calcium and potash and cosmic light
[1:23:40] in you
[1:23:41] look at your outfit i say thank you
[1:23:44] you know thank you i like it too
[1:23:48] they said yeah well this is the suit
[1:23:49] that god put
[1:23:51] me in i'm i'm carbon too i'm calcium two
[1:23:55] i'm
[1:23:55] i'm i'm from the dirt too i'm made out
[1:23:57] of dust too daddy
[1:23:59] how do you like my suit
[1:24:02] because i'm just dirt like you are but
[1:24:04] look how god made you and
[1:24:06] look how god made me you're going to
[1:24:09] think the preacher's crazy this morning
[1:24:11] but
[1:24:11] but you know if you could really think
[1:24:13] of that
[1:24:14] that he is just what you are makes you
[1:24:17] feel closer to the animals
[1:24:19] you know a lot of you are maybe even too
[1:24:21] close to animals already but
[1:24:22] you know i mean as far as that affection
[1:24:24] thing i when i mean close i mean
[1:24:26] you know affectionate i'm working for a
[1:24:29] lady that
[1:24:30] is over the top so but
[1:24:33] uh you know we have this
[1:24:37] this this affinity with with
[1:24:40] with animals and and mankind sees that
[1:24:44] now he's never found the missing link
[1:24:47] and
[1:24:47] and and we'll touch on that briefly but
[1:24:51] let's go to to genesis 2 and 7.
[1:24:58] and we'll just
[1:25:08] we wanted to go a little further than
[1:25:09] two and seven and he breathed into them
[1:25:11] the
[1:25:12] breath of life
[1:25:18] now this man here
[1:25:21] which we're going to call dust man
[1:25:24] this is after the introduction of the
[1:25:27] shovel and
[1:25:28] and so you know we could
[1:25:32] we could see that man was in this state
[1:25:35] of being the dust of the earth
[1:25:38] and we see these things that were spoken
[1:25:42] in ecclesiastes and we
[1:25:44] and we see what this creation of man
[1:25:50] really is in reference to this
[1:25:52] tabernacle
[1:25:55] and so we have adam
[1:25:58] before the fall he's this
[1:26:02] dust man but he's in fellowship with god
[1:26:11] and adam had the title in the bible
[1:26:15] as son of god because we know
[1:26:18] in the genealogies when they
[1:26:22] went down through the genealogies coming
[1:26:28] down to jesus
[1:26:31] when it came to jesus it said who was
[1:26:34] born of mary
[1:26:36] it didn't say the son of who was the son
[1:26:39] of
[1:26:40] who was the son of it didn't say that
[1:26:43] concerning jesus when it came to jesus
[1:26:46] it said who was born
[1:26:47] of mary but
[1:26:51] when it went the other way backwards
[1:26:55] and it started you know somewhere in
[1:26:57] abraham and went
[1:26:58] kept going backwards and backwards and
[1:27:01] it said
[1:27:02] you know the the the son of enos which
[1:27:05] was the
[1:27:06] son of seth which was the son of adam
[1:27:10] which was the son of god
[1:27:16] now adam was in this dust man
[1:27:21] body in perfect fellowship
[1:27:25] with god
[1:27:28] and then god looked down at adam and saw
[1:27:32] that he was lonely gives us a little
[1:27:34] insight
[1:27:35] into god's feelings because the prophet
[1:27:38] said that god looked at adam and saw
[1:27:40] that he was as
[1:27:41] adam was like him that and he said it's
[1:27:44] not good for a man to
[1:27:46] dwell alone and he
[1:27:50] put adam to sleep and he took
[1:27:53] one of his ribs
[1:27:57] and he made the woman
[1:28:01] so that woman was not a new creation out
[1:28:04] of the dust of the earth
[1:28:06] but that woman was also
[1:28:10] dust of the earth because she came out
[1:28:13] of adam
[1:28:17] so here they were in the garden in this
[1:28:21] beautiful
[1:28:23] rest peace
[1:28:26] beautiful there's no evil there's no
[1:28:29] nervousness there's no
[1:28:30] tension there's no awkwardness there's
[1:28:33] no
[1:28:34] nothing like that there's only
[1:28:36] fellowship with god
[1:28:38] but then in the third chapter of genesis
[1:28:43] we find adam
[1:28:47] in another condition because now
[1:28:53] he's still dust man
[1:28:57] but now he's feeling guilty
[1:29:02] he's hiding from god he's afraid he said
[1:29:07] god said you know why did you hide he
[1:29:09] said well we were afraid because we
[1:29:11] we knew that we we were naked and he
[1:29:13] said well who who who
[1:29:15] who told you you were naked and so
[1:29:19] in genesis 3
[1:29:22] god said
[1:29:27] because you've done this because they
[1:29:31] transgressed the word of god
[1:29:37] he said from now on you're going to have
[1:29:39] trouble
[1:29:40] on every hand and we could read those
[1:29:43] verses but you're all bible students
[1:29:46] you know the the earth is going to bear
[1:29:48] for thorns and he
[1:29:50] said how it was going to be for the
[1:29:52] woman he said how it was going to be
[1:29:53] from the man and he said because of this
[1:29:56] transgression
[1:30:01] this is how life's going to be now
[1:30:06] and then he also cursed the serpent and
[1:30:09] he said because you did this because you
[1:30:12] beguiled the woman
[1:30:19] this is from now on you're going to
[1:30:22] crawl on your belly and i'd like to read
[1:30:25] what schofield said about that
[1:30:32] scripture
[1:30:34] scofield said the serpent
[1:30:37] in his edenic form is not to be
[1:30:40] thought of as a writhing
[1:30:44] reptile eudenic form means you know in
[1:30:48] edom
[1:30:48] before the fall the serpent is not to be
[1:30:51] thought of as a writhing reptile
[1:30:54] scofield said this scofield predates
[1:30:57] brother branham
[1:31:00] what in the world people think man
[1:31:02] you're a cult
[1:31:03] you're you're you're off the deep end
[1:31:05] you're following some man because he
[1:31:07] says
[1:31:08] these these outrageous things
[1:31:14] okay let's choose another bible
[1:31:17] well-esteemed bible student
[1:31:21] and what is he saying
[1:31:26] he need not be thought of as a writhing
[1:31:29] reptile that is the effect
[1:31:31] of the curse the creature
[1:31:35] which is which lent itself to satan
[1:31:38] may well have been the most beautiful as
[1:31:41] it was the most subtle of the creatures
[1:31:45] less than man
[1:31:49] this is kind of common knowledge in the
[1:31:53] theological world
[1:32:02] we see man we see now he's
[1:32:05] in his fallen condition and nevertheless
[1:32:10] man attained to some great heights even
[1:32:14] in his fallen condition
[1:32:17] if we think about job
[1:32:21] job also had the same thought
[1:32:25] as david did and in
[1:32:29] job 17 and 17
[1:32:32] he makes a very similar
[1:32:38] statement
[1:32:49] and we'll just read it this morning
[1:32:56] now job is suffering and
[1:32:59] why is he suffering because god bragged
[1:33:01] on him
[1:33:02] god said to satan he said
[1:33:07] have you considered job have you have
[1:33:10] you looked it
[1:33:10] at what what kind of a man he is
[1:33:15] and so all of these things befell
[1:33:18] job and he began
[1:33:22] to he said in verse 15
[1:33:25] so that my soul he in the suffering he
[1:33:28] suffered so much that is
[1:33:30] that my soul would choosethe strangling
[1:33:33] and death
[1:33:34] rather than my life i loathe it i would
[1:33:37] not live
[1:33:39] all way let me alone for my days our
[1:33:42] vanity
[1:33:44] and he said what is man
[1:33:47] that thou should magnify him and that
[1:33:50] thou should have set
[1:33:52] thine heart upon him
[1:33:55] and that thou should just visit him
[1:33:58] every morning and try him
[1:34:00] every moment so
[1:34:04] job is wanting to hide from god and he's
[1:34:07] he's kind of reminding god
[1:34:10] what is man
[1:34:13] and this is a good man this is man that
[1:34:16] is
[1:34:17] at his good state and and he's pleading
[1:34:20] with god and he's saying
[1:34:24] you know what am i what is man that thou
[1:34:26] should us magnify him why am i
[1:34:28] in the spotlight have you ever felt like
[1:34:32] this you ever thought
[1:34:33] you know you you come under such con
[1:34:39] constrainment and such frustration in
[1:34:41] your life
[1:34:42] and such a challenge in your thinking
[1:34:45] and in your heart and in your human
[1:34:47] condition
[1:34:49] and now you have god to deal with and
[1:34:51] you try
[1:34:52] in prayer and soul-searching
[1:34:55] to to reconcile things with god and to
[1:34:59] understand
[1:35:01] and then you feel like man if i could
[1:35:03] just disappear
[1:35:06] you know if i could just go somewhere
[1:35:09] and david said well where could i go and
[1:35:11] god would not be there
[1:35:14] and i've always envisioned in my life
[1:35:16] you know i i i just fly away to uruguay
[1:35:19] i go down on the beach and with whatever
[1:35:22] cash i could have mustered to get out of
[1:35:24] town
[1:35:25] i got my little shack there by the beach
[1:35:28] and just everybody leave me alone
[1:35:32] and and let the rest of the world go by
[1:35:38] and then some little hispanic guy that
[1:35:41] knows english
[1:35:42] you know he's walking on the beach and
[1:35:44] he sees me there and he says
[1:35:46] you know do you know the lord
[1:35:50] i think do i know the lord do i know the
[1:35:54] lord
[1:35:58] so job he
[1:36:02] he he answered his his counselors his
[1:36:06] his religious friends that wanted to
[1:36:08] fellowship with them
[1:36:10] and kind of solve the problem
[1:36:14] and he said if i be wicked why then
[1:36:17] labor i
[1:36:18] in vain you know if i'm so out of sorts
[1:36:23] if i'm so
[1:36:24] away from god if if i'm so messed up
[1:36:27] then what is it in me that drives me and
[1:36:30] pushes me
[1:36:31] for more of god for more truth for
[1:36:34] for more of his spirit for more of the
[1:36:37] love of god
[1:36:38] what is this thirst in me because you
[1:36:41] come into this courtroom with the enemy
[1:36:43] the devil that he's an accuser of the
[1:36:46] brethren
[1:36:46] 24 7. the the bible says that he accuses
[1:36:50] the brethren
[1:36:51] day and night so we're bound to come
[1:36:54] into this
[1:36:54] this courtroom where the light's shining
[1:36:57] in your eyes and you're sitting on the
[1:37:00] on the seat and the prosecutor is is
[1:37:03] is putting it on you
[1:37:07] and making you feel like a rat and
[1:37:10] making you feel like a hypocrite oh he
[1:37:12] don't make you feel like a rat
[1:37:13] he wants you to be one of those polished
[1:37:16] religious hypocrites
[1:37:18] you know really sophisticatedly evil
[1:37:22] like you're professing and you're saying
[1:37:24] i've got the holy ghost
[1:37:26] and you're saying that i'm a son of god
[1:37:28] and you're saying that
[1:37:29] i was in his thinking before the
[1:37:31] foundation of the world
[1:37:33] and that the lord said i will send unto
[1:37:37] you a prophet and you said amen lord
[1:37:41] that's
[1:37:41] me and i'm believing that that word of
[1:37:44] god
[1:37:45] that he sent by that man i believe in
[1:37:48] that he's one of those stars
[1:37:49] in the hand of jesus to reveal to my
[1:37:52] heart
[1:37:53] the secrets of god so i could be in
[1:37:56] fellowship with god and i'm a son of god
[1:37:58] but now
[1:37:58] in this courtroom
[1:38:02] a failure and you're not what you say
[1:38:05] you
[1:38:06] are and you polish things up real nice
[1:38:09] and you have a testimony
[1:38:13] and you're on the witness stand
[1:38:17] with a really sharp prosecutor
[1:38:22] and job got under all of that and he
[1:38:25] said you know what
[1:38:26] if i am wicked why am i laboring
[1:38:30] to be right with god
[1:38:34] if i wash myself with snow water and
[1:38:37] make my hands
[1:38:38] ever so clean yet shall thou plunge me
[1:38:42] in the ditch and mine own clothes shall
[1:38:44] abhor me
[1:38:47] for he is not a man as i am
[1:38:51] that i should answer him and we should
[1:38:53] come together in judgment
[1:38:55] neither is there any days men betwixt us
[1:38:59] that might lay his hand upon us both
[1:39:04] a days man it's a beautiful sermon think
[1:39:07] we've
[1:39:07] maybe preached on that one time but
[1:39:10] job's saying
[1:39:11] there's nobody between this holy god
[1:39:15] and man that can just put his arms
[1:39:17] around both of us and says hey guys
[1:39:19] what's it take to make this right
[1:39:22] and that's where that word dazed comes
[1:39:25] from the english courts and
[1:39:26] that's quite another subject but job
[1:39:28] didn't have that
[1:39:31] so here is job in this house of clay
[1:39:36] abhoring this clay that he's in
[1:39:41] and he's saying what is man that thou
[1:39:43] should us magnify him what is man that
[1:39:45] thou
[1:39:45] should visit him
[1:39:50] and you might say brother dennis we're
[1:39:52] well aware
[1:39:54] of all these things but
[1:39:58] if god help us to go
[1:40:01] quickly and we would go a little further
[1:40:08] you might say that
[1:40:14] you know man was disobedient in the
[1:40:16] garden and then so
[1:40:18] god said life's going to be hard and
[1:40:21] it's very easy
[1:40:22] for religious people and mankind to kind
[1:40:25] of understand it that way
[1:40:28] you know that the sin in the garden was
[1:40:30] disobedience
[1:40:31] and just let us leave it at that we
[1:40:34] don't need to go into detail
[1:40:36] we don't need to know but but man
[1:40:40] is so suffering with this affliction
[1:40:43] in this tabernacle
[1:40:48] that when you begin to speak about how
[1:40:53] you got in this condition
[1:40:55] man says yes i would like to know
[1:40:58] how i got in this condition and then we
[1:41:02] say well because of the fall in the
[1:41:03] garden and you say well what was that
[1:41:05] fall in the garden
[1:41:07] and the fall in the garden was eve
[1:41:10] having an adulterous affair with the
[1:41:13] serpent
[1:41:14] and that serpent wasn't a snake but it
[1:41:16] was the creation
[1:41:18] it was the uh animal
[1:41:22] life that was right next to man
[1:41:26] like scofield made this reference to
[1:41:30] and satan used that
[1:41:33] serpent and it's so hard to get out of
[1:41:37] your mind when you say the word serpent
[1:41:39] instantly you say snake we just do that
[1:41:45] but so let's just say this man-like
[1:41:48] creature
[1:41:51] so satan used this
[1:41:54] man-like creature the most subtle of all
[1:41:57] of the beast
[1:42:00] to get to eve and to bring his seed
[1:42:04] into mankind because we know that when
[1:42:08] god spoke to the serpent
[1:42:10] he said to the serpent he said i'm going
[1:42:13] to put an enmity between thy seed
[1:42:16] and the woman's seed but we know that
[1:42:18] the woman doesn't have a seed so we know
[1:42:20] that was the first prophecy about jesus
[1:42:22] i know this is all review but what
[1:42:25] happened
[1:42:26] it would be one thing to say well they
[1:42:28] were both disobedient
[1:42:30] and now we have to work by the sweat of
[1:42:33] our brow
[1:42:33] and life is hard and and we're in this
[1:42:36] condition but there's something more
[1:42:38] there
[1:42:38] that happened to man is that he took on
[1:42:43] by that sin he took on in his tabernacle
[1:42:48] that animal nature
[1:42:52] that was the avenue that this animal
[1:42:55] nature came into mankind
[1:42:59] and i've often used that reference to a
[1:43:01] little fluffy dog he's your little pet
[1:43:03] and he's nothing but pure love you know
[1:43:05] in fur
[1:43:07] and then let the neighbor dog go to his
[1:43:10] food dish
[1:43:11] and see what happens to him your little
[1:43:14] angel
[1:43:15] is rip and tear and fight to death
[1:43:19] and let the blood fly
[1:43:22] and you're going wow you know foofy what
[1:43:25] got into you
[1:43:25] there's nothing got into fufi that was
[1:43:28] always in foofy
[1:43:31] but it's the same thing that was in
[1:43:33] david he was a man
[1:43:35] after god's own heart he loved god he
[1:43:38] god used him to prophesy in all of the
[1:43:41] things that he went through
[1:43:42] god used those things to speak of our
[1:43:45] lord jesus christ and he
[1:43:48] spoke the word of god and described
[1:43:50] jesus life
[1:43:51] hundreds of years before jesus ever came
[1:43:55] but he had in him this curse from the
[1:43:58] garden
[1:44:00] and brother branham said that man in his
[1:44:03] unregenerated
[1:44:04] condition is worse than a beast man
[1:44:08] and when we say it we're saying mankind
[1:44:10] and woman kind
[1:44:12] and we we don't need to rehearse the
[1:44:15] evil things that
[1:44:17] a bad spirit gets on women and men both
[1:44:20] but
[1:44:21] mankind they will act worse
[1:44:24] than animals there's a higher
[1:44:28] order in animals by nature than what man
[1:44:31] does
[1:44:33] so much that they just begin to get
[1:44:36] farther and farther away from god and
[1:44:38] degrade themselves more
[1:44:40] and more and more it's worse than
[1:44:43] animals
[1:44:47] so by this fall in the garden we
[1:44:49] understand
[1:44:50] by the truths that were revealed by the
[1:44:54] prophet of god the messenger sent to us
[1:44:57] he went
[1:44:58] into these scriptures and god used that
[1:45:01] prophet to
[1:45:02] sh to explain to us what happened in the
[1:45:05] garden
[1:45:06] and why you're in the condition you're
[1:45:08] in
[1:45:11] so then for a young man that that
[1:45:14] or a young girl or or a young person i i
[1:45:18] i especially have a a a
[1:45:21] a compassion for for young people
[1:45:23] because
[1:45:24] they're not understanding they're coming
[1:45:26] into life
[1:45:27] and they're trying to figure out what's
[1:45:29] going on with me
[1:45:31] and they'll come here at the altar and
[1:45:33] they'll give their heart to the lord
[1:45:35] jesus
[1:45:37] with all the purity and sincerity and
[1:45:40] surrender their life to god
[1:45:44] and then walk out back into life
[1:45:48] and a huge temptation comes over them
[1:45:53] and then they think uh what is that
[1:45:57] what is that and then they'll think well
[1:45:59] i must not have been born again that
[1:46:01] must not be the holy ghost i must
[1:46:04] that must not have been the real thing
[1:46:05] and so they're waiting for the next
[1:46:07] revival
[1:46:08] to really settle it
[1:46:13] and then you say talking about young
[1:46:15] people
[1:46:17] come on friends come on let's just be
[1:46:20] real
[1:46:21] one with another how many times have we
[1:46:24] said
[1:46:25] from now on
[1:46:28] you know from this day in my closet
[1:46:33] i will never do that again
[1:46:40] i'm never going to be like that again
[1:46:42] you know god
[1:46:43] help me i'm going to drive a steak and i
[1:46:46] and i won't be tempted with that again
[1:46:49] i won't let something like that come out
[1:46:51] of my mouth again
[1:46:53] i won't let my eyes fall on that again i
[1:46:55] i won't let that anger
[1:46:57] raise up in me like some kind of animal
[1:47:06] this is the day by golly
[1:47:09] you know you can mark my words
[1:47:13] that's great you know yeah hey great
[1:47:16] your words are
[1:47:18] so much higher and loftier than every
[1:47:20] man on this earth that's just
[1:47:22] a complete failure you know but okay
[1:47:24] we'll mark your words
[1:47:34] so this nature
[1:47:38] that we saw manifested in david
[1:47:42] that we see in ourselves
[1:47:45] this was the nature that paul spoke
[1:47:48] about in romans 7.
[1:47:52] he said with my heart i serve god
[1:47:57] but i see in my flesh another law
[1:48:01] working like these laws of physics
[1:48:05] you know you know what's going to happen
[1:48:08] to the pen when i throw it up
[1:48:11] it's going to keep just going
[1:48:15] because what goes up comes down it's the
[1:48:17] law of physics
[1:48:19] and in in and these laws are in all of
[1:48:22] god's creation and
[1:48:24] paul saw in his body
[1:48:29] a law that he didn't like but it was
[1:48:32] there
[1:48:33] and it it it caused him so much
[1:48:36] consternation
[1:48:37] that he finally cried out and he said oh
[1:48:41] wretched man that i am
[1:48:44] oh wretched man he hated it he hated to
[1:48:48] see it he
[1:48:49] he he saw this perfect
[1:48:53] love that he had for god he saw this
[1:48:55] realm
[1:48:56] of pure fellowship he could be with god
[1:48:59] he
[1:48:59] he he saw this thing that god
[1:49:02] put in his heart to love his fellow man
[1:49:06] it's something that god put in his heart
[1:49:09] to make himself a servant to others it's
[1:49:12] something that
[1:49:12] god put in his heart to forsake his own
[1:49:16] life
[1:49:17] and and let himself be as nothing
[1:49:22] and he said it's not i that liveth but
[1:49:25] it's
[1:49:25] christ that liveth in me he saw
[1:49:29] god's working in his life and he had to
[1:49:32] do
[1:49:32] as you and i do we marvel
[1:49:36] at what god's doing in your heart and we
[1:49:39] say like david said what is man
[1:49:45] who am i lord that you come close to me
[1:49:49] and draw me to yourself
[1:49:52] who am i lord that you would reveal the
[1:49:55] secrets
[1:49:56] of your heart who
[1:49:59] who am i that i should know what
[1:50:02] happened in the garden that i
[1:50:03] should know what really happened at
[1:50:06] pentecost that i should know that you
[1:50:07] should make
[1:50:08] known to me really what the new birth is
[1:50:14] and that you can show me what
[1:50:16] forgiveness of sin is
[1:50:19] that i should know these things
[1:50:22] who am i that you should bring me in
[1:50:25] this realm
[1:50:25] of fellowship with you lord
[1:50:29] and paul had all of those things
[1:50:32] but he looked at the tabernacle that he
[1:50:34] was in and he said
[1:50:36] oh wretched man
[1:50:40] that i am
[1:50:46] but
[1:50:51] god chose paul
[1:50:55] to explain to us who jesus
[1:50:58] really is
[1:51:01] remember in the scripture it said they
[1:51:03] started to believe on his name while
[1:51:04] they didn't believe
[1:51:06] it wasn't that they believed that his
[1:51:08] name was jesus
[1:51:10] but they started saying to see who he
[1:51:12] was
[1:51:14] that he was not just a rabbi
[1:51:20] that he was not just one of the prophets
[1:51:23] and so in the book of hebrews
[1:51:27] paul begins to say now in former times
[1:51:30] god spoke unto us by his prophets
[1:51:34] and and showed us who he was by the word
[1:51:37] but in these last days he's spoken unto
[1:51:39] us
[1:51:40] through his son jesus so now
[1:51:44] god was living in this
[1:51:48] man jesus declaring his very
[1:51:51] nature he was the express image
[1:51:55] of god he was the perfect expression of
[1:51:58] god
[1:51:59] he was this logos in
[1:52:04] in flesh
[1:52:08] and at christmas time we
[1:52:13] celebrate god
[1:52:16] being born
[1:52:20] in a manger
[1:52:23] and you know it's a beautiful song isn't
[1:52:25] that a beautiful song that says we sang
[1:52:27] it this morning that says
[1:52:30] let the word be born in the manger of my
[1:52:33] heart and that one verse said it's just
[1:52:35] a lonely
[1:52:36] just a lowly stable
[1:52:39] hardly a place where a king would be
[1:52:41] born
[1:52:43] and then that that raises up in us yes
[1:52:46] lord let that be
[1:52:47] me but you know that picture of jesus
[1:52:53] being born in a manger
[1:52:56] is only in symbol and type and you know
[1:52:59] we
[1:53:00] think of how that brother bradham
[1:53:02] preached a sermon called
[1:53:04] uh why it had to be shepherds and he
[1:53:06] talked about
[1:53:07] how that the high priest couldn't go in
[1:53:09] there because they'd have their nice
[1:53:11] robes on and
[1:53:12] they'd be holding their nose and
[1:53:14] tiptoeing through the manure
[1:53:16] and you know it'd be no place for
[1:53:18] somebody high and haughty like that but
[1:53:20] the shepherds could come in there
[1:53:22] because they were used to all that
[1:53:23] stinky smell and all that dirty
[1:53:26] mustiness and the the animals and you
[1:53:28] know all this straw and hay
[1:53:30] and and dirtiness and you know that was
[1:53:32] nothing to them
[1:53:34] and then we think of the lovely lord
[1:53:37] jesus the
[1:53:39] emmanuel god with us born as a baby and
[1:53:42] then wrapped in that swaddling cloth
[1:53:46] of an ox that was sweating and plowing
[1:53:49] the fields and
[1:53:50] they put that rag between the yoke and
[1:53:53] his
[1:53:54] neck and he just labored and stunk and
[1:53:57] sweated and it got to be that ratty
[1:53:59] cloth and then
[1:54:00] this proud mother wrapped her
[1:54:05] little infant baby in that
[1:54:13] but i'd like to invite you to entertain
[1:54:17] the thought this morning that that
[1:54:19] all looks pretty good when we think
[1:54:24] of jesus and the tabernacle
[1:54:27] that he came to not the manger
[1:54:31] not the swaddling cloth but what kind of
[1:54:35] man did when he
[1:54:38] came when god came to tabernacle with
[1:54:41] man
[1:54:42] what what did he come to and that's what
[1:54:48] paul was trying to express in the book
[1:54:51] of hebrews
[1:54:52] and he said now he didn't come
[1:54:56] as an angel
[1:55:00] and then brother branham comments on
[1:55:01] that and it's also he talked about how
[1:55:03] angels were also a type of prophets
[1:55:06] but paul was saying he didn't come as
[1:55:09] angel
[1:55:10] nor as a prophet although we know that
[1:55:13] adam said the lord your god will raise
[1:55:15] up a prophet like unto me we know that
[1:55:18] but what paul was trying to express in
[1:55:20] the first few
[1:55:21] chapters of hebrews was is who jesus was
[1:55:26] and he says in hebrews the second
[1:55:29] chapter he said for
[1:55:30] unto angels hath he not put into
[1:55:32] subjections the world to come
[1:55:34] whereof we speak but one in a certain
[1:55:37] place testified saying what is
[1:55:39] man that thou art mindful of him
[1:55:42] or the son of man that thou visitest him
[1:55:46] thou made us this is hebrews 2 7 now we
[1:55:48] are on
[1:55:50] thou madest him a little lower than the
[1:55:52] angels
[1:55:53] thou crownest him with glory and honor
[1:55:56] and didn't set him over the works of thy
[1:55:59] hands
[1:56:01] thou has put all things subject under
[1:56:03] him for in that he put
[1:56:05] all in subjection under him he left
[1:56:07] nothing that is not
[1:56:08] under him but now we see not yet all
[1:56:11] things
[1:56:12] put under him who's he speaking of man
[1:56:18] man and man no matter how good he was he
[1:56:21] was subject to death
[1:56:23] he's heading for death like the animals
[1:56:26] had for death
[1:56:27] every man is heading for death
[1:56:34] so this is
[1:56:38] the tabernacle this is the robe
[1:56:42] that jesus wore this is whom
[1:56:45] he became
[1:56:54] when
[1:56:56] paul said he but we see jesus who was
[1:56:59] made a little lower than the angels for
[1:57:01] the suffering of death crowned with
[1:57:03] glory and honor
[1:57:04] that he by the grace of god should
[1:57:07] taste death for every man i'd like
[1:57:11] you to think about that this morning
[1:57:13] taste
[1:57:14] death you ever
[1:57:18] eat something and you want the other
[1:57:19] person to taste it and they refuse
[1:57:23] and you're just saying this is so good
[1:57:25] and they say i don't want to touch it
[1:57:26] and you no no no you don't understand
[1:57:29] just
[1:57:30] taste a little bit and you'll be
[1:57:33] convinced
[1:57:34] you just got to have it on your own
[1:57:37] taste buds and then you'll know
[1:57:38] another's like no no no no
[1:57:40] i'm not i'm not touching that
[1:57:44] so what's it take they got to taste it
[1:57:49] and you could tell them well they could
[1:57:52] say well just describe it for me and
[1:57:54] that'll be fine
[1:57:57] no when we're not saying those things to
[1:58:00] be funny this morning we're laboring
[1:58:02] that
[1:58:02] god might help us this morning to
[1:58:06] understand that he came to taste
[1:58:09] death for every man
[1:58:13] and he had to become flesh
[1:58:17] for that stinger to hook in there
[1:58:21] it had to be flesh
[1:58:24] the curse was on flesh he had to become
[1:58:27] flesh
[1:58:28] so that that stinger of death
[1:58:31] could anchor and we always think well
[1:58:36] the way we think of the scripture is we
[1:58:39] think
[1:58:40] that the the sting of sin is death
[1:58:45] is that what the scripture says no
[1:58:49] the sting of death is sin
[1:58:54] you see that's what makes death fearful
[1:58:56] that's why man
[1:58:57] feared every death it's because he knew
[1:59:00] he had to face
[1:59:01] god and and and the sin question was
[1:59:04] there
[1:59:06] so that's what the sting of death was
[1:59:09] because if there was no sin what would
[1:59:12] be death
[1:59:14] so that's how jesus took the sting
[1:59:18] out of death is he took the sin out of
[1:59:20] it because that
[1:59:21] sin anchored in him because
[1:59:24] he became not dust man
[1:59:29] so a lot of us too many times we think
[1:59:31] that way i know i have
[1:59:33] that's why i'm preaching that this
[1:59:34] morning because we see that you can go
[1:59:37] many many years and not have the
[1:59:40] revelation that god really wants you to
[1:59:42] have
[1:59:43] jesus did not come as dust man just
[1:59:46] step into that remember when he went and
[1:59:49] saw
[1:59:50] abraham and he said
[1:59:53] step into that gabriel dust body
[1:59:58] step into that wormwood i don't know who
[2:00:00] he said was the other angel
[2:00:03] and then he stepped into that that was
[2:00:06] god in dust man
[2:00:08] that was not jesus that was christ that
[2:00:10] was the anointed one that was god that
[2:00:12] was the spirit of god
[2:00:14] in a dust man body but it wasn't jesus
[2:00:17] no when jesus came jesus came as sinful
[2:00:21] man
[2:00:22] that same curse that came upon man that
[2:00:25] animal
[2:00:26] nature that was in man and all of those
[2:00:29] feelings and temptations and sufferings
[2:00:32] all of that that was in man jesus became
[2:00:36] son of man
[2:00:42] that's what he introduced himself all
[2:00:44] the time he said to peter
[2:00:47] who does man say that i the son of man
[2:00:52] am he was declaring
[2:00:56] who who what condition he was in he
[2:00:58] didn't come as son of god
[2:01:00] he didn't come as an angel
[2:01:04] he became a son of man he was declaring
[2:01:07] his humanness
[2:01:11] peter said peter didn't say well you're
[2:01:15] jesus
[2:01:16] like i know your name you know i know
[2:01:19] you
[2:01:19] you're dave right oh perhaps not dave
[2:01:22] you know
[2:01:23] but he didn't say you're jesus
[2:01:27] he said thou art the christ the son of
[2:01:29] god
[2:01:30] so jesus is saying who am i the son of
[2:01:33] man
[2:01:34] he's declaring who he is and peter's
[2:01:37] declaring who i am
[2:01:38] and he said you got it peter
[2:01:41] but you know we we we know a
[2:01:45] sermon title you know god called man
[2:01:48] and it's kind of a a thing it depends on
[2:01:50] how you
[2:01:51] want to look at that group of words
[2:01:54] and and and if you're aspiring
[2:01:58] maybe you feel a call of god on your
[2:02:00] life and you're thinking you know am i a
[2:02:02] god-called man you know am i called of
[2:02:04] god
[2:02:04] well all of us are called of god
[2:02:08] you know we're a god called people
[2:02:12] so we think of well a god called man but
[2:02:15] but
[2:02:16] the the real expression of the sermon
[2:02:18] was
[2:02:19] god called man
[2:02:22] you know god working god moving god
[2:02:25] doing something
[2:02:26] and people saying it's just a man
[2:02:30] but it was god but look at jesus when he
[2:02:33] was on earth and declaring himself
[2:02:35] amongst mankind he was calling himself
[2:02:38] the son of man
[2:02:40] because he took on sinful flesh
[2:02:49] if you would look up some of these
[2:02:51] scriptures and that's where we fail
[2:02:52] saints of god
[2:02:53] we read something like hebrews and and
[2:02:56] we don't even look up the footnotes so
[2:03:00] paul is quoting all these scriptures
[2:03:02] from the old testament
[2:03:03] and and we we just kind of read on
[2:03:07] until we find something we understand
[2:03:10] we just press on you know this is our
[2:03:12] bible reading this week i'm going to
[2:03:13] read
[2:03:14] hebrews and to be honest with you
[2:03:17] most of chapter 2 i didn't know if he
[2:03:20] was talking about man or jesus or who
[2:03:24] but anyway we got here farther to
[2:03:25] something we understood why
[2:03:27] why should we live like that saints but
[2:03:29] if we would run the margins
[2:03:31] and we'd hear and brother brother paul
[2:03:34] says
[2:03:34] excuse me in verse 12 saying i will
[2:03:37] declare thy name unto my brethren
[2:03:40] in the midst of the church will i sing
[2:03:43] praise unto thee well he's quoting david
[2:03:46] i will declare thy name
[2:03:48] unto my brethren but you go over there
[2:03:50] in in
[2:03:51] psalms 22 and it's a familiar psalm to
[2:03:54] most of us it starts out my god my god
[2:03:57] why hast thou forsaken me you know
[2:04:00] they've pierced my hands and my feet
[2:04:02] you know they gave me gall and i was
[2:04:04] thirsty they gave me vinegar and all
[2:04:06] these
[2:04:07] psalms we see christ in there
[2:04:11] and so here in chapter 2 paul is telling
[2:04:15] us
[2:04:20] that he was not ashamed to call us
[2:04:23] brethren
[2:04:29] for verily he took not on him the nature
[2:04:31] of angels but he took on him
[2:04:34] the seed of abraham
[2:04:37] look at what condition the seed of
[2:04:39] abraham was in the day that he came
[2:04:41] all the religious confusion and the
[2:04:43] scribes and the pharisees and the
[2:04:45] roman occupation and and all the dis
[2:04:49] uh harmony and everything in the
[2:04:53] seed of abraham and jesus walked right
[2:04:57] in to the middle of it as one of us
[2:05:03] wherefore in all things it behooved him
[2:05:06] to be made like unto his brethren
[2:05:08] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[2:05:12] high priest
[2:05:13] in things pertaining to god
[2:05:17] to make reconciliation
[2:05:20] for the sins of the people
[2:05:27] the time is getting late let me read
[2:05:31] something that brother bradham said
[2:05:49] quoting that scripture same scripture
[2:05:51] again it won't hurt us to hear it again
[2:05:54] wherefore in all things that behooved
[2:05:56] him to be made like
[2:05:58] unto his brethren his brethren
[2:06:01] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[2:06:04] high priest
[2:06:05] in things pertaining to god to make
[2:06:08] reconciliations
[2:06:10] for the sins of the people to reconcile
[2:06:13] now
[2:06:14] god knowing justice had to become
[2:06:17] unjust to feel what it was
[2:06:21] to be a sinner to go back to reconcile
[2:06:25] through reconciliation
[2:06:27] and have mercy on the people
[2:06:32] god could not suffer in spirit
[2:06:36] he had to become flesh to feel the pain
[2:06:39] of sickness
[2:06:40] to feel the temptation of lust
[2:06:43] to feel the temptation of want to feel
[2:06:46] the temptation of hunger
[2:06:48] to feel the power of death that he might
[2:06:52] take it upon himself to stand in the
[2:06:55] presence
[2:06:55] of the great spirit jehovah the spirit
[2:06:59] not the man the spirit
[2:07:00] to make intercessions to this life
[2:07:04] and jesus took that in order to make
[2:07:07] intercessions
[2:07:08] for us for he knows how
[2:07:12] it feels when you get sick
[2:07:16] he knows how you feel when you're
[2:07:18] tempted
[2:07:19] he knows how you feel
[2:07:22] now did you ever notice when he when we
[2:07:24] vote for president every
[2:07:26] farmer will vote for a president that's
[2:07:28] been a farmer
[2:07:29] for he knows the hard part of a farmer's
[2:07:32] life see he wants some man
[2:07:34] who understands and before god
[2:07:38] could ever understand him being that
[2:07:41] great holiness
[2:07:44] how he could ever understand after
[2:07:47] he condemned man by his
[2:07:50] holiness he condemned man and the
[2:07:54] only way he'll ever know how to justify
[2:07:58] man is to become man
[2:08:08] the only way he'll ever know how to
[2:08:10] justify man
[2:08:12] is to become man
[2:08:16] isn't that a lot different understanding
[2:08:19] to say god knows all things
[2:08:21] god's omnipotent god knows every man you
[2:08:24] know when
[2:08:25] when we read in in john there in the
[2:08:28] beginning of the service and we say well
[2:08:30] you know god knows man and he knows
[2:08:32] what's in man
[2:08:34] and and we when we when we get in
[2:08:36] trouble and
[2:08:37] and when we fail the lord and we say
[2:08:39] lord you saw
[2:08:40] everything you saw how i failed you
[2:08:44] you saw how i didn't measure up today
[2:08:46] and and i'm not hiding anything because
[2:08:48] you know
[2:08:49] everything
[2:08:54] and that's where our disconnect comes
[2:08:58] we begin to feel dirty and we begin to
[2:09:02] feel
[2:09:03] wretched and like paul said when we we
[2:09:06] feel
[2:09:06] weary and we begin to apologize to god
[2:09:10] and we say god
[2:09:11] i shouldn't be weary like this with all
[2:09:14] the word of god i know with
[2:09:16] with you know what i know about romans
[2:09:19] 28 2 or 8 and 28
[2:09:23] all things work together for good i
[2:09:25] should be strong i
[2:09:26] i i should be built up in the word of
[2:09:29] god i should be doing different and and
[2:09:32] you know all things so you know where
[2:09:34] i'm at lord
[2:09:35] no no that's so wrong
[2:09:41] it's true but it's so wrong
[2:09:44] it isn't that he knows what's going on
[2:09:48] with you
[2:09:49] it's that he knows because
[2:09:52] he was there he's been weary he's been
[2:09:56] sick
[2:09:57] he's been tempted i remember the first
[2:09:59] time
[2:10:00] i heard somebody quote brother branham
[2:10:02] say jesus was tempted with lust
[2:10:04] i my eyes dropped open
[2:10:07] and the brother laughed at me he said
[2:10:08] what you'd think you didn't think so
[2:10:12] i have to be honest no i didn't think so
[2:10:14] why because i was thinking
[2:10:15] that jesus was walking amongst us with
[2:10:17] like
[2:10:19] step into that oh no no no
[2:10:22] that swaddling cloth was a real pretty
[2:10:24] picture
[2:10:25] compared to the sinful man that he dwelt
[2:10:28] in
[2:10:28] he became sin for us
[2:10:32] he took on flesh he was every bit man
[2:10:36] and he called himself the son of man
[2:10:44] he felt it he feels what you're feeling
[2:10:49] and you think oh i shouldn't feel this
[2:10:51] way it's just it's your man nature
[2:10:54] you're weak he was weak
[2:10:59] you're tired mentally tired he was
[2:11:02] mentally tired
[2:11:06] you're tempted to throw in the towel he
[2:11:08] was tempted
[2:11:10] he went to the garden and he feared
[2:11:11] death so much the bible says
[2:11:14] it was seen in that he feared he said
[2:11:17] lord let this cup pass from me
[2:11:26] but when a vision came he could raise
[2:11:30] the dead
[2:11:31] when that anointing that was with him
[2:11:33] showed itself
[2:11:34] but god took that off of him so he'd go
[2:11:37] to calvary
[2:11:38] and die like a man
[2:11:43] oh friends
[2:11:47] we'd only understand the heart of god
[2:11:50] i can go over and as i did the other day
[2:11:53] and read moses ten commandments
[2:11:57] and i thought oh my goodness
[2:12:00] for me to look over at something and say
[2:12:03] i wish i had that that's coveting
[2:12:06] and i said to myself reverend mcgary
[2:12:09] i'll just use that expression reverend
[2:12:11] mcgary this is pretty fundamental stuff
[2:12:14] this is the ten commandments you're
[2:12:16] supposed to learn that stuff
[2:12:18] in in bible school in in sunday school
[2:12:22] and i had to say to myself you know
[2:12:25] you know self it would do you some good
[2:12:28] for just some old-fashioned
[2:12:29] godly fear that hey the ten commandments
[2:12:33] say
[2:12:34] don't do that and i should be saying yes
[2:12:36] sir
[2:12:40] but we get down the road and we get all
[2:12:42] sophisticated with all kinds of teaching
[2:12:44] now we're too big for that just to say
[2:12:46] yes sir lord
[2:12:48] but now we're we're you know we're we're
[2:12:51] beyond all that
[2:12:57] but that's all right god didn't want
[2:12:58] that god didn't want you to shake in
[2:13:01] your britches and say i know
[2:13:03] everything you do i know
[2:13:06] you say oh you know i'm bust
[2:13:09] i'm i'm guilty he knows i'm just guilty
[2:13:14] that's not what god that's not what's
[2:13:17] going to bring you close to god
[2:13:20] what's going to bring you close to god
[2:13:22] is to recognize
[2:13:24] the love of god that he came
[2:13:27] to live in the same tabernacle
[2:13:30] that you're living in and when you feel
[2:13:33] weary
[2:13:34] and when you feel ashamed he knows what
[2:13:37] it's to be ashamed
[2:13:38] they hung him naked on calvary he knows
[2:13:41] what shame is
[2:13:43] he didn't just bear your sins to calvary
[2:13:46] he bore your shame there
[2:13:49] i don't know if if i'm an odd bird but
[2:13:52] you know a lot of times i can kind of
[2:13:56] bring my sins to calvary and lay them
[2:13:58] before the cross
[2:13:59] and say you know i i lay these training
[2:14:02] it was wrong lord i
[2:14:03] knew better i don't want to live like
[2:14:05] that and i lay my sins here
[2:14:09] and your blood covers my sins
[2:14:12] but then i'm so ashamed that i did that
[2:14:16] i'm just ashamed and then you think well
[2:14:18] you know that i'll carry because
[2:14:20] i've got to carry that because you know
[2:14:22] i did it no
[2:14:23] you don't have to carry that he bore
[2:14:25] your shame
[2:14:27] he knows what it feels like
[2:14:32] and he tasted death for us
[2:14:35] that we don't have to taste that
[2:14:41] how could he be a real kinsman and just
[2:14:44] have a
[2:14:45] body he had to become
[2:14:49] our kinsmen
[2:14:55] he lived in it he knows
[2:15:00] jesus knows the pain you feel
[2:15:03] he can save and he can heal
[2:15:08] oh i'm not gonna be praying the same way
[2:15:11] saints
[2:15:12] lord you know you know what i did you
[2:15:14] know you're omnipotent
[2:15:17] oh but how different it is to say jesus
[2:15:22] you know
[2:15:26] then the love of god wells up in you and
[2:15:29] you start to recognize
[2:15:30] why and you had terms in your mind that
[2:15:34] didn't mean anything to you and then you
[2:15:36] understand why he called himself the son
[2:15:38] of man
[2:15:39] so that you would know
[2:15:43] that yeah i lived right where you're at
[2:15:46] when you pray that's how
[2:15:50] he's our high priest if god help us to
[2:15:52] go a little farther into the high priest
[2:15:54] tonight
[2:15:55] god bless you this morning saints of god
[2:15:58] let's stand together
[2:16:07] he didn't take the form of angels
[2:16:12] he took the form of sinful
[2:16:16] man
[2:16:21] jesus knows the pain you feel
[2:16:27] he can save and he can heal
[2:16:32] as we just wait on the lord a moment
[2:16:40] isn't healing a beautiful thing
[2:16:46] healing that comes from god
[2:16:49] [Music]
[2:16:52] reconciliation that
[2:16:57] could you imagine someone saying the
[2:16:59] only way
[2:17:02] god could understand
[2:17:05] is to become man
[2:17:11] that's what god wanted us to know that's
[2:17:13] why he sent
[2:17:15] the prophet to to put it to where we can
[2:17:18] understand it
[2:17:20] god had to become man to really
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:26] understand
[2:17:33] and when we
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:17:37] want to turn our shoulder and turn away
[2:17:39] from the lord in shame
[2:17:42] he's trying to get us to turn back
[2:17:44] around and say
[2:17:46] don't turn your head don't turn from me
[2:17:49] i i know
[2:17:52] i lived that i lived what you're feeling
[2:17:55] i
[2:17:56] felt it let's bow our hands
[2:18:01] dear lord jesus
[2:18:03] [Music]
[2:18:06] you were the
[2:18:10] fountain of holiness purity
[2:18:14] pure love everything clean and
[2:18:19] right and true and unspotted and
[2:18:22] uncompromised
[2:18:28] and yet lord you weren't ashamed to come
[2:18:31] and
[2:18:32] [Music]
[2:18:33] be a brother to us
[2:18:38] not in some diplomatic sense
[2:18:42] not in some theology lord but
[2:18:46] you came in flesh to experience the
[2:18:50] things that we
[2:18:51] do like
[2:18:53] [Music]
[2:18:55] we want to accept that today we want to
[2:18:57] believe it
[2:18:59] would you make that real in our hearts
[2:19:01] lord
[2:19:03] next time we fall down and try to get up
[2:19:07] we could think
[2:19:10] you had to get up
[2:19:13] [Music]
[2:19:15] on that road to calvary under that cross
[2:19:18] you had to get up you know what it is
[2:19:21] to feel pain in your body
[2:19:29] you know how it felt to be despised
[2:19:34] you know how it felt to be
[2:19:38] rejected unappreciated misunderstood
[2:19:42] [Music]
[2:19:45] you felt it lord
[2:19:49] why do we despise ourselves lord and
[2:19:52] think we're so
[2:19:53] out of the way when we're just being
[2:19:55] partakers
[2:19:57] of your divine nature
[2:20:04] and if we saw that you could tabernacle
[2:20:06] in flesh
[2:20:08] once and you could come and live in a
[2:20:11] body like this
[2:20:12] once how excited we get lord to know
[2:20:15] that that's exactly what you promised to
[2:20:18] do again

[2:20:22] spirit
[2:20:23] coming and living in us lord just
[2:20:26] exactly
[2:20:28] again
