[16:47] the people
[16:49] and I know because they they really have

[17:00] it come out on the WhatsApp or you you
[17:03] um I say it on on my WhatsApp broadcast
[17:06] make sure that you take some time
[17:10] to bring those requests before the Lord
[17:12] because the person who gave those
[17:15] requests has a lot of faith and a lot of
[17:18] confidence in our prayers
[17:20] so make sure that we're doing that

[17:47] it could be any time that she goes to be
[17:48] with the Lord

[17:53] it'll be a glorious time in heaven when
[17:56] our dear sister goes across across that
[17:59] Veil comes into the presence of the Lord
[18:02] where all the other Saints are it's a
[18:04] place where we all desire to get to

[18:12] family
[18:13] and Friends pray for our church

[18:18] time and in the history of the Tucson
[18:20] Tabernacle
[18:22] makes sure that each one of us are doing
[18:24] our part
[18:26] bringing
[18:28] these decisions that we have to make
[18:30] before the Lord Jesus in prayer none of
[18:34] us want to make the wrong decision
[18:37] so please pray for the church

[18:47] enough to
[18:49] to

[19:01] take a moment
[19:03] think about
[19:04] your friends think about your family
[19:07] [Music]

[19:11] [Music]
[19:12] think about yourself
[19:16] and if there is a need that
[19:18] that you feel that would be for someone
[19:22] or for yourself
[19:24] [Music]
[19:26] where the Lord might look down upon an
[19:30] uplifted hand and know what's underneath
[19:32] that hand would you raise your hand
[19:35] holding that request that you have
[19:38] in your heart
[19:40] and knowing that the great heavenly
[19:43] father is looking over the banister of
[19:44] heaven and he's looking at these hands

[25:57] and anoint our ears Lord help me to not
[25:59] misspeak and help no one to mishear but
[26:02] help us all to draw closer to you we
[26:06] thank you for this opportunity to be
[26:08] here tonight in Jesus precious name
[26:15] our study of Acts showed the
[26:18] Evangelistic efforts of the early church
[26:21] exploded in Acts 13. a deliberate effort
[26:26] was now being made to travel not to
[26:27] escape persecution from Jerusalem but to
[26:30] spread the gospel the good news of Jesus
[26:33] Christ far beyond the borders of Judea
[26:37] and Samaria
[26:40] it's what we call evangelism
[26:42] I'd like to read two brief portions of
[26:45] scripture before we get into Acts 14.
[26:49] the first
[26:51] if you want to turn to it in your Bibles
[26:53] is the concluding verses of Matthew's
[26:56] gospel
[26:57] Matthew 28 we'll begin at the 18th verse
[27:02] now Jesus to the angel and so forth had
[27:05] told his disciples to go to Galilee and
[27:07] he would meet them there so this is
[27:09] shortly after his resurrection they've
[27:11] gone to Galilee and Jesus now comes to
[27:14] the eleven surviving disciples shortly
[27:16] after his resurrection and he says Jesus
[27:20] came and spake unto them saying all
[27:22] power
[27:24] how much
[27:26] all all power is given unto me in heaven
[27:33] and in Earth
[27:35] for what purpose
[27:38] how do we keep our association with this
[27:40] all-powerful one
[27:42] what are we to do
[27:45] go ye therefore go
[27:48] it's a command it's an imperative it's
[27:50] not a suggestion
[27:52] because I've been given all power here's
[27:55] what you must do go and teach
[27:58] by example as well as words all nations
[28:02] everyone
[28:04] regardless of ethnicity Heritage
[28:07] background
[28:09] circumstances social class
[28:12] All Nations baptizing them in the name
[28:15] singular the name not the titles but the
[28:19] name of the father of the son of the
[28:23] Holy Ghost
[28:24] which we know is Jesus
[28:27] he said to go teach well what are you
[28:29] supposed to teach them teaching them
[28:31] I just told you to teach them here's
[28:34] what you're to teach here's the lesson
[28:36] plan observe all things
[28:38] whatsoever I have commanded you
[28:42] and I just commanded you to go
[28:45] and blow
[28:46] behold if you do this you may rest
[28:49] assured that I
[28:51] the all-powerful one
[28:54] m
[28:55] not will be
[28:57] not was
[28:59] I am with you always
[29:02] even to the end of the world regardless
[29:04] of the passage of time I transcend time
[29:06] get your eyes off of time
[29:09] amen
[29:11] and if we then turn to Acts chapter 1
[29:15] verses six through eight now this is in
[29:18] Jerusalem just prior to his Ascension
[29:21] that what I just read was shortly after
[29:23] his resurrection there's been this
[29:25] 40-day period he's getting ready to
[29:27] ascend
[29:29] so when they the remaining 11 disciples
[29:32] the same ones that he has just told us
[29:34] in Matthew that he has been given all
[29:36] power
[29:36] were therefore come together they asked
[29:39] of the resurrected Jesus saying Lord
[29:42] will thou at this time restored again
[29:45] the kingdom to Israel
[29:47] always wanting to know
[29:49] or think they do know
[29:52] or think that they want to know the
[29:55] future just like us always trying to
[29:57] unravel the Rapture or the tribulation
[30:00] or the bride or the or the church when
[30:03] this future event will happen What form
[30:05] will it take
[30:07] too often being distracted from what we
[30:11] should be expending our time and energy
[30:13] to accomplish so Jesus admonishes them
[30:16] he Jesus said unto them the disciples
[30:20] it's not for you to know the times or
[30:22] the seasons
[30:24] which the father hath put in his own
[30:26] power
[30:29] stop asking me
[30:31] I've been given all power so if the
[30:33] father's put it in his power I have that
[30:35] power so I could tell you
[30:38] but I
[30:40] won't you're completely missing the
[30:42] point
[30:46] but pay attention now here's what this
[30:48] is all about it's not some secret
[30:50] knowledge or some obscure revelation
[30:53] it's not about escaping from this world
[30:56] but ye shall
[30:58] shall this is a certainty you you shall
[31:01] receive power where is that going to
[31:03] come from from me all power has been
[31:06] given unto me so for meat for whom all
[31:09] power is given the only source the
[31:11] repository I'll share it with you in the
[31:14] following way after that the Holy Ghost
[31:16] has come upon you
[31:18] the channel of grace through which I
[31:22] send my power to you
[31:24] and what's the purpose of you receiving
[31:27] this power
[31:29] ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[31:32] Jerusalem and all Judea Samaria to the
[31:36] uttermost part of the Earth
[31:38] oh you're getting
[31:44] our purpose as Christians
[31:47] is simple
[31:48] spread the gospel
[31:51] you want to see Miracles a church like
[31:54] the book of Acts
[31:55] spread the gospel
[31:57] you want the power
[31:59] of God in your life
[32:03] spread the gospel
[32:04] you want to see the Holy Spirit move in
[32:06] our midst
[32:08] spread the gospel
[32:10] it's not rocket science
[32:12] it's bread the gospel
[32:14] and that's exactly what the book of Acts
[32:16] is all about telling the story of the
[32:19] earliest Christians and how they
[32:21] expended their lives their efforts their
[32:24] energies for one purpose
[32:27] spread the gospel
[32:30] let's take a quick recap of Acts that
[32:33] we've covered so far
[32:35] acts 1 gave the commission wait for the
[32:38] Holy Spirit we just read it and then
[32:41] spread the gospel to the entire world
[32:43] Acts 2 tells us that Spirit filling the
[32:46] Believers in the upper room and how they
[32:48] immediately
[32:50] wasn't the next day it wasn't after
[32:53] they'd studied some more it wasn't a few
[32:56] hours later but instantly
[32:58] they set about spreading the gospel even
[33:02] speaking words they themselves did not
[33:04] understand
[33:06] Acts 3 and 4 tells of a public miracle
[33:11] which led to many more converts to the
[33:14] way
[33:15] and the subsequent trouble with the
[33:17] religious authorities in Jerusalem
[33:19] acts 5 was about honesty with the
[33:23] fellowship and with God
[33:25] acts six and seven tell about Stephen
[33:29] the first martyr
[33:31] what was he guilty of
[33:33] spreading the gospel
[33:36] acts 8 tells of spreading the gospel to
[33:40] Samara and Judea to the Ethiopian eunuch
[33:43] coming to Faith
[33:45] acts 9 introduces solid it tells of
[33:48] Peter miraculous healing even raising
[33:50] one Dorcas from the dead
[33:52] getting him in position
[33:54] so that in Acts 10 when Cornelius has a
[33:57] vision Peter will be in the right place
[33:59] at the right time to do what
[34:02] spread the gospel to the first Gentile
[34:04] Believers the household of Cornelius
[34:07] acts 11
[34:09] is the all two predictable reaction of
[34:12] people who objected to Outsiders
[34:14] becoming believers they have to go
[34:16] through what we did
[34:18] Fair it's not right
[34:20] but in Acts 11 when Peter tells them
[34:23] what happened and they hear the truth
[34:25] those who objected not only relented but
[34:29] they embraced the change
[34:31] acts 12
[34:33] it tells us about Peter's escape from
[34:35] prison the death of Herod Antipas the
[34:38] one who had John the Baptist killed and
[34:39] mocked Jesus the morning of his
[34:41] execution
[34:43] and this brings us to the last two
[34:45] lessons we've had on Acts 13.
[34:47] which is all about what
[34:50] spreading the gospel
[34:53] here's a map it may be a little hard for
[34:55] you to see in the back that's a hint
[34:57] that you should sit closer to the front
[35:00] this is the Journey of Solomon Barnabas
[35:02] and John Mark so far from Acts 13. they
[35:06] left here from Antioch of Syria they
[35:08] sailed
[35:09] to the East End of the island of Cyprus
[35:13] salamis was the name of the city they
[35:15] worked away just since about 90 miles to
[35:18] the Western end to paphos
[35:20] had success in spreading the gospel
[35:23] message to the towns along the way
[35:26] just before leaving Cyprus they had an
[35:28] encounter with a sorcerer
[35:30] and the way the Lord dealt with them led
[35:33] to the conversion of the governor of
[35:35] Cyprus a man named paulus
[35:37] and at that time in verse 9
[35:39] Luke tells us that Saul that's how we
[35:42] say in an English in Hebrew which means
[35:45] prayed for
[35:46] became known as Paul from paulus a Latin
[35:50] Roman name meaning small or humble
[35:53] they then sailed from Cyprus to perga
[35:57] the southern coast of what we
[35:59] Now call Turkey it's not the same as
[36:01] pergamus which is several hundred miles
[36:03] away
[36:05] John Mark left him at this point and he
[36:08] sailed back here to Jerusalem
[36:12] it's all in Barnabas continued Inland to
[36:15] Antioch of basidia
[36:17] it's about 94 miles if you could go in a
[36:19] straight line but the airlines were down
[36:21] that day so they had to walk through the
[36:23] mountainous terrain it was a bit more
[36:25] than 94 miles for them Paul preached a
[36:27] sermon there which Luke excerpts and
[36:29] summarizes for us in Acts 13 verses 16
[36:33] to 41.
[36:35] well an antioccupacity they expanded
[36:37] their reach
[36:39] from those that worshiped in synagogues
[36:42] to the general Gentile population
[36:44] their vision for the mission and
[36:46] expanded
[36:48] persecution then arose we read about
[36:51] that in Acts 13 verses 50 to 52 where
[36:55] the Jewish people that did not accept
[36:57] Paul's teaching stirred up influential
[37:00] people in town and they were kicked out
[37:04] I think the Lord sort of nudged them to
[37:07] keep on walking
[37:09] well acts 13 ended with them journeying
[37:12] to Iconium which is this town right here
[37:19] it's about 76 miles in a straight line
[37:22] from Antioch of the city but again they
[37:24] couldn't travel in a straight line they
[37:26] had to go through the mountains
[37:29] footnote you see on the map that this
[37:31] region that includes Antioch and Iconium
[37:33] as part of this uh kind of peach colored
[37:36] thing
[37:38] it's called galatia glace is a region
[37:40] it's it's a province so later when Paul
[37:43] writes his letters to the Believers in
[37:45] galatia
[37:46] that the addresses include the churches
[37:50] that are established in this region that
[37:52] we're reading about in Acts 13 and 14.
[37:56] Galatians isn't written to a church in a
[37:58] city but to multiple churches in a
[38:00] region
[38:02] and finally while we don't know the
[38:04] dates and only the approximate years
[38:07] General consensus is that from the start
[38:09] of Acts 13
[38:12] sorry
[38:15] I'll get it right there we go wrong
[38:17] button when they sailed from here until
[38:20] they eventually get back at the end of
[38:21] Acts 14 back to Antioch covers a period
[38:24] of about two years
[38:26] so this wasn't uh
[38:28] you know a quick trip
[38:33] we'll start reading from acts 14 now the
[38:36] first verse
[38:40] it came to pass an Iconium
[38:44] that they saw in Barnabas
[38:46] went both together into the synagogue of
[38:49] the Jews so they started as is normal
[38:52] for them with the people that believed
[38:54] in Jehovah the the god of the Old
[38:57] Testament the god of Israel and so spake
[39:00] they were so convincing
[39:03] and with the power in which they
[39:05] presented the message of the Gospel the
[39:07] Risen Messiah
[39:09] that a great multitude both of the Jews
[39:11] and also of the Greeks now these are
[39:13] Hellenistic Jews Hellenistic Jews
[39:17] because remember they're speaking in a
[39:19] synagogue so and there may have been
[39:22] gentile people there as well but they
[39:24] were people that attended the synagogue
[39:26] they believed in in the god of what we
[39:28] call the Old Testament so they believed
[39:31] and they accepted the gospel message
[39:34] but the unbelieving Jews that is those
[39:37] who did not accept the gospel but
[39:39] spurned it
[39:41] stood up to Gentiles they joined forces
[39:43] with the non-jewish elements of the
[39:46] local area not just the proselytes that
[39:48] were worshiping in this synagogue and
[39:51] made their minds evil affected influence
[39:54] they influence them they poisoned their
[39:56] minds
[39:57] they turned them strongly against the
[39:59] Brethren that's primarily of course Saul
[40:01] and Barnabas but would necessarily
[40:03] include those that had been persuaded
[40:07] but they were not intimidated rather for
[40:10] a long time therefore not because of the
[40:13] opposition but due to the acceptance of
[40:16] the Gospel message that's what therefore
[40:18] is referring to they Abode Solomon
[40:21] Barnabas and Iconium
[40:24] speaking quietly in a barely audible
[40:27] whisper behind closed doors
[40:31] says they spoke boldly in the Lord
[40:34] and the lord gave testimony unto the
[40:36] word of his grace his Divine favor and
[40:39] the Lord granted signs and wonders
[40:41] miraculous healings and so forth to be
[40:44] done by their hands he backed up what
[40:48] they said
[40:50] but
[40:51] however
[40:52] in spite of this
[40:54] the multitude the general population of
[40:57] the city was divided
[40:58] divided in their opinion about what was
[41:01] being taught
[41:03] part held with the unbelieving Jews that
[41:06] the apostles were spreading some sort of
[41:08] heresy
[41:10] in part with the apostles
[41:13] that the gospel message in fact was true
[41:20] and when there was an assault made now
[41:22] uh I'm not sure if he's speaking in
[41:25] legal terms but but in our country if a
[41:28] person is charged with assault they
[41:29] don't have to touch you if they touch
[41:31] you that's battery assault is getting in
[41:33] your face
[41:35] when there was an assault made an
[41:37] attempt to violently attack the apostles
[41:40] both of the Gentiles and also of the
[41:42] Jews with their rulers religious and
[41:44] Civil Authorities to use them
[41:46] despitefully means to mistreat or abuse
[41:49] them and even to Stone them so they had
[41:52] this intent to really do harm but they
[41:57] Solomon Barnabas
[41:58] were aware that they became aware
[42:01] they found out they learned of it and
[42:04] fled
[42:06] they fled remember Joseph had a dream at
[42:09] night and the angel came to him and said
[42:11] flee because herod's going to kill that
[42:13] baby so they fled they got out of there
[42:17] they didn't walk slowly
[42:19] they escaped from Iconium until last
[42:22] written Derby cities of lycunia and then
[42:25] to the region that lieth round about the
[42:27] neighboring districts
[42:29] but were they intimidated
[42:31] there they continued to preach the
[42:34] gospel
[42:36] so here I realize that this big Arrow
[42:40] they're not in a boat out here it's just
[42:42] helping you see this little arrow up
[42:43] here going from myconium to lyster
[42:45] that's that's only about 20 miles
[42:51] everybody's absorbed that Geographic
[42:53] data from the map will continue on
[42:56] and there
[42:58] somewhere in town sat a certain man at
[43:01] lystra
[43:02] impotent in his feet
[43:07] being a nowadays we'd say having
[43:10] a Mobility handicap or perhaps just
[43:13] disabled or with a disability
[43:15] from his mother's womb in other words
[43:17] it's a birth defect
[43:19] he'd never walked
[43:21] never
[43:23] it reminds us of the man at Jerusalem at
[43:25] the gate called Beautiful
[43:27] who also had deformed feet
[43:29] from birth
[43:31] the same heard Paul speak
[43:35] we don't know what
[43:38] he's saying except we know it was the
[43:39] Gospel but it seems likely that he was
[43:42] testifying of some of the miraculous
[43:45] healings the way that the Lord had been
[43:47] backing up the gospel that they're
[43:49] sharing
[43:50] personally I think while he was talking
[43:53] he saw this man
[43:55] felt a nudge from the Holy Spirit and
[43:58] perhaps witnessed about that healing at
[43:59] the beautiful gate
[44:01] but we do read that Paul steadfastly
[44:04] beholding him just like I'm looking at
[44:06] Amos
[44:08] steadfastly beholding him
[44:10] perceiving
[44:12] that he had Faith to be healed
[44:15] response to what he was hearing Paul
[44:17] preach and testify Paul
[44:19] said with a loud voice to the man with
[44:21] deformed feet stand upright On My Feet
[44:26] and he
[44:27] he the lame man
[44:28] who had never
[44:30] never was leg muscles were undoubtedly
[44:32] atrophied I've shared you the testimony
[44:34] of what happened to me when I was just
[44:35] bedridden for a few weeks
[44:38] he didn't slow
[44:42] around him
[44:43] we're told that he leaped
[44:45] heaped up and he walked
[44:49] I want to shift gears here just for a
[44:51] moment and go back to this is 2023 let's
[44:54] go back 50 years to 1973. little
[44:58] personal testimonial I was in the Army
[45:01] at that time I'd been drafted in
[45:02] December of 72 and uh
[45:05] uh so I was off at Fort Ord California
[45:09] and in January late January of 1973 a
[45:13] sister Grace evenly came and visited
[45:15] Tucson she her testimony is in the back
[45:18] of this book the 11th commandment she
[45:20] was uh given up to die by
[45:23] um Mayo Clinic
[45:25] and she was just just at the end just at
[45:29] the end she felt that if she could get
[45:31] to one of brother Brown's meetings that
[45:33] she'd be healed her husband to challenge
[45:35] her about that and that's what she'd
[45:37] said they they made they found out about
[45:38] a meeting they lived up in Sault Ste
[45:40] Marie Michigan in that area came down to
[45:44] Chicago while they were checking into
[45:45] the hotel somebody robbed everything out
[45:48] of their car
[45:50] so she was in this meeting and and she
[45:53] she when she came to Tucson I was in the
[45:55] Army she stayed with my wife she stayed
[45:57] with Heather in the trailer that we were
[45:58] renting at that time and so sister Grace
[46:01] was there for a few weeks and uh and she
[46:04] shared this testimony
[46:07] you said you know when you're laying
[46:08] down and and you get up you know you
[46:10] push yourself up if you're getting out
[46:12] of bed or you roll or you do something
[46:13] you assist yourself
[46:16] you couldn't do that but one moment
[46:20] she was laying on this cot
[46:23] and
[46:24] the prayer was made for her and
[46:27] instantly she was on her feet instantly
[46:29] she was on her feet this didn't just
[46:31] happen in the book of Acts this didn't
[46:33] just happen in Acts 9 or acts 5 or in uh
[46:38] in in Acts 14. this happened in 1955 or
[46:43] 56 in brother branham's in meetings and
[46:45] and it happened in this room right over
[46:47] here I remember Sister Sammy Allen was
[46:49] in a similar situation and and she'd
[46:51] been brought to church into cot she was
[46:53] in the fellowship hall there while the
[46:55] service was going on and God touched her
[46:58] she was on her feet and that was just a
[47:01] few years ago in this very building
[47:02] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[47:07] forever he still responds to Faith
[47:12] when the people saw what Paul had done
[47:15] not just heard what he said
[47:19] let's I'd like to just pause another
[47:21] moment like Peter and John at their
[47:23] beautiful gate in Jerusalem this
[47:25] miraculous healing took place in public
[47:29] and the presence of Skeptics
[47:31] the benefit wasn't just or even
[47:34] primarily for the one that was healed
[47:36] but a public witness of the Gospel of
[47:39] the grace and power of God
[47:42] when the people saw what God had done
[47:44] through Paul they the the people the not
[47:47] yet believing multitude lifted up their
[47:49] voices
[47:51] they were excited
[47:54] loudly proclaiming saying in the speech
[47:56] of like cornea whatever that speech is
[47:59] their local dialect which could be why
[48:01] Paul and Barnabas didn't immediately
[48:02] respond
[48:04] had it been in Hebrew or Greek or some
[48:06] other language they were familiar with
[48:08] they might have said something sooner
[48:09] but they said and they proclaimed that
[48:11] gods are come down to us and the
[48:14] likeness of men
[48:16] these aren't men as they appear to be
[48:18] they must be divine beings part of the
[48:20] pantheon of Olympus
[48:23] a similar response to the crowd of
[48:26] caesarea that heard Eric gripper speak
[48:28] back in Acts 12. but in this case it it
[48:30] wasn't while wearing a silver robe
[48:32] Seated on the throne making
[48:33] self-againizing statements
[48:36] it was the miraculous healing
[48:39] you'll notice throughout acts that
[48:41] healings aren't done in prayer lines in
[48:43] churches they're far more public and
[48:46] draw attention to God's word and power
[48:49] and Truth testifying and backing the
[48:52] words that are being spoken and
[48:53] witnessed to the lost and dying
[48:56] amen spreading the gospel
[49:00] and they call Barnabas Jupiter that's
[49:02] the chief God Zeus to the Greeks and
[49:06] Paul mccurious Mercury Hermes in in
[49:09] Greek the messenger because he was the
[49:12] chief speaker
[49:15] well then
[49:17] the priest of Jupiter the Temple of
[49:20] which was before their City it hit the
[49:22] entrance by the gate brought oxen and
[49:24] garlands unto the gates and would have
[49:27] done sacrifice he intended to do
[49:29] sacrifice to Barnabas and Paul with the
[49:33] people
[49:35] they were excited Jupiter has come down
[49:38] Among Us
[49:39] which when the apostles Barnabas and
[49:42] Paul heard of it
[49:44] when they understood what was really
[49:46] going on and they saw this escalation of
[49:49] this misunderstanding of the people
[49:52] they tore their clothes
[49:55] it was an expression of grief of oh no
[50:00] it might have been their only clothes
[50:02] they weren't carrying a big suitcase
[50:04] right
[50:06] and they ran out among the people
[50:09] crying out and saying sirs why do ye
[50:13] these things we also are men of like
[50:16] passions with you
[50:18] preach unto you that you should turn
[50:20] from these vanities unto the Living God
[50:22] which made Heaven and Earth the sea and
[50:26] everything that's in them
[50:28] when times passed suffered All Nations
[50:31] to walk in their own ways but not
[50:34] anymore
[50:35] nevertheless he left not himself without
[50:38] witness and that he did good gave us
[50:41] rain from Heaven fruitful Seasons
[50:44] filling our hearts with food and
[50:47] gladness
[50:49] and with these sayings
[50:51] scarce restrained they the people that
[50:54] they had not done sacrifice unto them
[50:58] put yourself
[51:00] in that position
[51:02] you worship this Pantheon of gods your
[51:05] Pagan background you know nothing about
[51:07] Jesus Christ but what these two guys
[51:09] have been telling you about you've seen
[51:11] this miracle
[51:13] well you know very well that no man can
[51:16] heal a lame person just by telling him
[51:18] something and he pops up to his feet
[51:21] nobody can do that it's not possible so
[51:23] it has to be divine power
[51:25] has to be what else could it be
[51:28] and how could divine power live in a
[51:30] human
[51:32] unless a human were divine
[51:36] we saw the Same Spirit worshiping a man
[51:38] a vessel used by God and brother
[51:40] branham's Ministry
[51:41] sadly
[51:43] we still see people deceived by this
[51:45] very Spirit today
[51:52] well there came thither to lystra
[51:54] certain Jews from Antioch of facidia
[51:58] that had driven them out
[52:00] and Iconium
[52:02] 20 miles away who had tried to do them
[52:06] severe harm
[52:07] and with eloquent words they persuaded
[52:11] the people the people who had recently
[52:13] wanted to worship Paul and Barnabas as
[52:16] gods
[52:17] but we're now ready to kill them as
[52:19] imposters destroyers of the way of life
[52:21] demons or devils
[52:23] and
[52:24] having stoned
[52:28] Paul they didn't just threaten
[52:31] they acted
[52:33] and they acted so quickly
[52:35] and vehemently that there was no way to
[52:38] escape as he had done years earlier in
[52:40] Damascus let down over the wall in a
[52:43] basket or recently an Antioch of basidia
[52:47] it was these angry people from that
[52:49] Antioch who appear to have been
[52:51] instrumental in this action
[52:53] they were a little bit like Saul before
[52:56] the road to Damascus
[52:58] they stoned Paul inside the city unlike
[53:01] Stephen and they drew him they dragged
[53:04] his lifeless body
[53:06] out of the city
[53:08] supposing he'd been dead
[53:11] why did they suppose he was dead
[53:13] because he was
[53:15] they killed him
[53:17] well why do you say that Brenda Lyle
[53:21] stoning
[53:22] is not tossing pebbles at somebody it's
[53:25] not trying to chase them away
[53:28] it's grabbing big rocks and smashing
[53:31] skulls smashing bones breaking ribs
[53:35] mangling bodies blunt force trauma if
[53:38] this nowadays people might use an
[53:40] aluminum baseball bat
[53:43] Paul was dead you don't have to take my
[53:45] word for it brother Brandon said he was
[53:47] dead
[53:50] so
[53:52] this I this is one of the most amazing
[53:55] things to me
[53:56] how be it as the disciples stood around
[53:59] about him now who are these disciples
[54:04] what have they been here
[54:06] in here that Jesus rose from the dead
[54:07] that he's alive they'd seen miracles
[54:11] well if he's alive and raises people and
[54:14] this is his speaker his messenger this
[54:16] guy this well
[54:19] if he can raise himself from the dead a
[54:22] few years ago he can certainly raise
[54:24] this man from the dead
[54:25] they weren't going
[54:28] how sad though let's let's give them a
[54:30] decent burial let's get some nice
[54:31] flowers for his funeral
[54:33] they weren't just standing around him
[54:35] they were praying for his life to return
[54:39] and again
[54:41] brother Branham explains that they did
[54:43] this at huge personal risk they had
[54:45] faith and they had expectation
[54:49] and they stayed there
[54:51] until Paul rose up
[54:54] now
[54:57] this is uh
[55:00] well
[55:01] speculation on my part let me stand
[55:04] aside about 14 years from the time of
[55:06] this event Paul wrote to the in second
[55:09] Corinthians and he told about going to
[55:12] the third heaven and seeing things that
[55:13] he just couldn't describe brother random
[55:16] talked about going to what he called the
[55:17] first heaven when he had that Vision be
[55:19] or that experience beyond the curtain of
[55:21] time
[55:22] we know that when Stephen was stoned he
[55:24] had a vision of Heaven he saw Jesus
[55:26] standing around and and he he mentioned
[55:29] that Vision that he was having as his
[55:31] life was passing away Paul said I don't
[55:33] know if I was alive or dead
[55:35] I don't know if I was in the body or not
[55:36] but I had this experience he wrote about
[55:38] it 14 years after this and when he wrote
[55:40] about it he said it was 14 years ago was
[55:43] it this experience we don't know
[55:45] but it might have been
[55:47] it might have been
[55:49] and where did Paul go
[55:52] anywhere but lystra that's where they
[55:55] just killed him
[55:57] no he returned to lystra he was just
[56:00] outside of it he came to the city and
[56:02] the next day probably still bloodied and
[56:04] bruised in pain
[56:08] likely traveling on foot
[56:10] he departed with Barnabas
[56:13] to Derby
[56:14] Derby will be the end point of their
[56:16] journey I was thinking about this and
[56:19] realizing that Paul
[56:21] was martyred twice
[56:23] he died twice for the witness of the
[56:26] Gospel once right here and later in Rome
[56:30] when he was beheaded
[56:34] so here we see
[56:36] going from Iconium or from lystra
[56:40] to Derby that's their next stop and it's
[56:43] the last stop
[56:44] it's about 60 miles
[56:47] I've pointed out galatia before
[56:50] Leicester and Derby you're also in the
[56:52] in this region along with Antioch and
[56:55] Iconium
[56:59] we're going to come to these towns a
[57:01] little bit later this evening when we
[57:02] read a witness from from another New
[57:05] Testament Source Peter
[57:07] and and and we'll we'll find out a
[57:10] couple of the chapters down that there's
[57:12] a couple of ladies of faith that lived
[57:13] in this area we don't know which of
[57:15] those towns maybe it was in the region
[57:17] in between
[57:18] but there was a lady named Lois
[57:21] she had her daughter named Eunice
[57:24] Eunice and her Greek husband had a son
[57:26] timothius
[57:28] and acts 16 we'll see Paul revisit
[57:30] lystra and Derby and take on timotheus
[57:33] Timothy as a companion during that
[57:35] journey of evangelism eventually two of
[57:38] the letters that we have preserved in
[57:40] our new testament in the Bible are
[57:42] letters that Paul wrote to this young
[57:43] man first and second Timothy
[57:47] and what many believe are either his
[57:49] first or second epistle will be written
[57:50] to the churches
[57:52] in the book of Galatians
[57:56] there's another thing that just happened
[57:58] here in lystra
[58:01] until now Paul's managed to escape
[58:03] physical persecution we read in Acts 9
[58:07] 25 that he was Lord in a basket outside
[58:09] the wall of the city of Damascus to
[58:11] escape those lying in wait at the gates
[58:14] the governor of the of Damascus was in
[58:17] on that
[58:18] at the end of Acts 13 He and Barnabas
[58:21] were chased out of the city of Antioch
[58:23] of basidia
[58:25] we read in Acts 14 6 just a few minutes
[58:27] ago how Paul and Barnabas escaped the
[58:29] crowd that wanted to Stone them in
[58:30] Iconium
[58:31] but now Paul is seized he's stoned to
[58:34] death his bodies dragged out of the city
[58:36] of lystra
[58:38] I think he was expecting this sort of
[58:40] thing
[58:42] he wouldn't always be able to escape or
[58:44] Dodge
[58:45] we read about his Damascus Road
[58:47] experience in Acts 9.
[58:50] let's revisit that for a moment the Lord
[58:52] told a fellow named ananias to go to
[58:54] Saul and and at 9 13 ananias answered oh
[58:58] Lord
[58:59] I've heard by many of this man how much
[59:02] evil he has done to thy Saints at
[59:03] Jerusalem and here he has Authority from
[59:06] the chief priest to bind all that call
[59:08] on thy name
[59:10] you really want me to go see this guy
[59:13] but the Lord said unto him ananias go
[59:17] thy way
[59:18] he's a chosen vessel onto him
[59:20] unto me bear my name before the Gentiles
[59:23] and Kings and the children of Israel for
[59:27] I will show him how great things he must
[59:31] suffer
[59:32] for my name's sake
[59:34] I think Paul saw it coming
[59:37] lyster would just be the beginning
[59:39] as I said Paul will die twice for the
[59:42] gospel and in second Corinthians 11 and
[59:45] 12 he lists
[59:48] a lot of the difficulties that he faced
[59:51] well let's get back to Acts 14.
[59:55] and one day Paul and Barnabas had
[59:57] preached the gospel to that City Derby
[1:00:01] and they're taught many of apparently
[1:00:04] with success without being attacked and
[1:00:07] it's likely that buried in that simple
[1:00:09] sentence
[1:00:11] Eunice and Timothy heard the gospel for
[1:00:13] the first time
[1:00:14] along with Grandma Lois
[1:00:17] after preaching and teaching in Derby
[1:00:19] they Paul and Barnabas
[1:00:22] started the long journey home
[1:00:25] they returned again to lystra
[1:00:27] that's 60 miles they're backtracking it
[1:00:30] remember Paul was brutally attacked he
[1:00:33] was killed by stoning in lystra
[1:00:35] Dakota bypass it gone directly to
[1:00:37] Iconium they could have gone East from
[1:00:40] Derby and made the way Overland to
[1:00:41] Tarsus and back home that way taking the
[1:00:43] short path
[1:00:45] voided all the places where they'd had
[1:00:47] trouble but they didn't
[1:00:49] they didn't take the easy route
[1:00:52] they didn't take the less risky route
[1:00:55] they had recent converts in lystra and
[1:00:58] Iconium
[1:00:59] and they refused to be deterred from
[1:01:01] verifying that they were continuing in
[1:01:03] the faith they wanted to verify that the
[1:01:07] word had taken effect in their life that
[1:01:09] they were filled with the holy spirit
[1:01:10] that they were continuing on in faith
[1:01:14] I imagine
[1:01:16] put yourself in the place of one of
[1:01:18] those that had participating in the
[1:01:20] stoning of Paul and Iconium
[1:01:24] I imagine there were a lot of shocked
[1:01:26] people in lystra when this dead guy
[1:01:28] walked back into town some weeks or
[1:01:30] months later
[1:01:33] I thought it was just a rumor those guys
[1:01:36] had snatched his body and buried it and
[1:01:38] made up a story
[1:01:39] but look
[1:01:41] here he is
[1:01:43] maybe witty was telling us about Jesus
[1:01:45] rising from the dead was true
[1:01:48] what a witness
[1:01:51] that would have been
[1:01:52] in that town to those people
[1:01:56] from Leicester they continue to Iconium
[1:01:58] another 20 miles
[1:02:00] and to Antioch of basidia another
[1:02:02] approximately 80 miles
[1:02:05] their return journey is is in these
[1:02:08] little dotted lines that are hard to see
[1:02:10] up here the dotted red so I made big
[1:02:12] dotted red arrows to help you find the
[1:02:15] little dotted lines so that's the return
[1:02:17] Journey Derby to Antioch of pasidia of
[1:02:20] verse 21.
[1:02:24] and what did they do
[1:02:26] in each of these towns and cities along
[1:02:28] the way
[1:02:30] the places they'd preach the gospel of
[1:02:32] Salvation to Jew and Gentile alike at
[1:02:35] Great risk
[1:02:36] danger cost
[1:02:39] they were confirming
[1:02:41] re-establishing so strengthening The
[1:02:44] Souls of the disciples the Believers
[1:02:46] those who had accepted the message of
[1:02:48] grace through the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:02:49] these these new
[1:02:51] these new apprentices of the faith
[1:02:55] and exhorting encouraging that the root
[1:02:58] of the word exhorting is to draw near to
[1:03:00] invite to comfort
[1:03:02] exhorting them to continue in the faith
[1:03:06] and telling them we must go through much
[1:03:09] tribulation
[1:03:10] hardships persecution
[1:03:14] anguish
[1:03:15] trouble
[1:03:17] burdens
[1:03:19] to enter into the kingdom of God these
[1:03:21] people were Witnesses of the terrible
[1:03:23] persecution and suffering of Paul and
[1:03:25] Barnabas
[1:03:26] it's not Theory from a textbook
[1:03:29] this is witnessed experience among these
[1:03:32] very converts to Christ
[1:03:34] this isn't look what's happening in
[1:03:36] China look what's happening in Ukraine
[1:03:38] this isn't their time
[1:03:41] and when they Paul and Barnabas had
[1:03:44] ordained them elders and every Church in
[1:03:47] each church assembly
[1:03:49] and had prayed with fasting they
[1:03:51] commended they presented they committed
[1:03:54] them to the Lord on whom they believed
[1:03:56] and whom their faith was placed
[1:04:00] ordained them Elders in every Church
[1:04:03] what does this verse mean
[1:04:05] what does that mean
[1:04:07] it's easy to just read through it or
[1:04:09] pass it and make an assumption but our
[1:04:11] pastor has told us if you're reading and
[1:04:15] you run across something in a verse
[1:04:17] be sure you understand it before you
[1:04:19] read the next verse
[1:04:21] so
[1:04:22] let's dig into this a little bit
[1:04:25] grab your shovels let's dig
[1:04:29] what is this word ordained
[1:04:31] other translations say appointed
[1:04:34] that particular Greek word means to
[1:04:36] stretch the hand
[1:04:37] some take this to mean voting but in
[1:04:40] this passage today is Paul and Barnabas
[1:04:42] so if they're voting they're the only
[1:04:43] two guys with votes
[1:04:45] the specific Greek word
[1:04:47] only appears twice in the entire New
[1:04:49] Testament
[1:04:50] the other place is second Corinthians 8
[1:04:52] 19. Paul is commending Titus to the
[1:04:55] church at Corinth he says who was also
[1:04:57] chosen of the churches to travel with us
[1:05:00] with this Grace so the word translator
[1:05:02] ordained in Acts 14 is translated chosen
[1:05:06] in second Corinthians 8.
[1:05:10] in this case
[1:05:12] Paul and Barnabas are appointing
[1:05:15] elders and every Church in Derby lystra
[1:05:19] Iconium
[1:05:20] antiochrophicidia and so forth
[1:05:24] say okay so they appointed these peoples
[1:05:29] but then you have to ask what is an
[1:05:31] elder
[1:05:33] what is an elder
[1:05:35] the word translated Elder like most
[1:05:38] words has many meanings God told Rebecca
[1:05:40] that she would have twins the Elder
[1:05:42] would serve the younger and in this case
[1:05:43] it's simply a matter of birth order of
[1:05:45] age
[1:05:46] same meaning as older but but this term
[1:05:49] can also mean one who has respect
[1:05:52] or who has Authority
[1:05:55] not necessarily new to age
[1:05:58] let's turn to First Peter chapter 5 for
[1:06:01] some illumination on this from the Bible
[1:06:02] and I'll read a brief excerpt from a
[1:06:04] sermon of brother Branham on this topic
[1:06:07] but before we go to First Peter chapter
[1:06:08] five we need to understand who Peter is
[1:06:11] addressing
[1:06:13] in this Epistle of First Peter who is
[1:06:15] his audience
[1:06:16] First Peter 1 1 tells us
[1:06:20] Peter
[1:06:21] an apostle of Jesus Christ to The
[1:06:25] Strangers scattered strangers now these
[1:06:28] These are believers that he had not
[1:06:30] personally met
[1:06:32] he doesn't know them so they're strange
[1:06:35] scattered throughout pontus galatia
[1:06:37] Cappadocia Asia and bythinia
[1:06:41] we'll get to that in a moment
[1:06:44] that these strangers are elect according
[1:06:46] to the foreknowledge of God the Father
[1:06:48] through sanctification of the spirit
[1:06:50] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[1:06:53] blood of Jesus Christ he says
[1:06:55] to you those strangers to whom that
[1:06:58] applies Grace unto you and peace
[1:07:01] be multiplied
[1:07:04] so we're back to our map so this is
[1:07:06] where Peter sent the letter i underlined
[1:07:08] them to pontus galatia
[1:07:11] Asia
[1:07:15] galatia
[1:07:17] so he's writing to what we would call
[1:07:19] Turkey to all of these regions here and
[1:07:21] I've marked with little
[1:07:23] uh red ovals here these four cities that
[1:07:26] we've been reading about in galatia
[1:07:27] Derby and Iconium and lystra and Antioch
[1:07:31] of pasidia
[1:07:33] there's writing to these very elders
[1:07:36] he's addressing these very people that
[1:07:38] Paul and Barnabas have just appointed
[1:07:43] so knowing the location let's find out
[1:07:47] what Peter describes as an elder
[1:07:51] in chapter 5 first Peter 5 1 he says the
[1:07:54] elders which are among you so this is
[1:07:56] just the whole church but now he's
[1:07:57] getting specific
[1:07:58] so I exhort I encourage I entreat
[1:08:04] I beseech who also am an elder I Peter
[1:08:09] I'm an elder too I'm one of you in
[1:08:10] Michael
[1:08:11] and not only that I'm a personal witness
[1:08:15] of the servings of Christ
[1:08:17] and also will be along with you a
[1:08:21] partaker of the glory that shall be
[1:08:23] revealed
[1:08:25] so to you Elders I exhort you to do the
[1:08:28] following
[1:08:29] feed the flock of God
[1:08:31] which is among you
[1:08:33] taking the oversight thereof the
[1:08:37] responsibility you have positions of
[1:08:39] responsibility
[1:08:41] you have positions of leadership not by
[1:08:43] constraint not because you must or
[1:08:45] you're being forced to
[1:08:47] but willingly
[1:08:49] out of love compassion
[1:08:52] concern
[1:08:53] Desiring to fulfill your calling as unto
[1:08:56] Christ himself
[1:08:58] not for filthy Luke or not for money
[1:09:00] it's not a job or a job description not
[1:09:02] as a hireling
[1:09:04] it's a calling but instead of a ready
[1:09:07] mind that means with enthusiasm
[1:09:10] eager to serve
[1:09:12] neither is being Lords over God's
[1:09:15] Heritage this isn't the concept of of
[1:09:19] what Jesus told his disciples he's its
[1:09:22] greatest among you must be servant of
[1:09:23] all not toward and over everybody
[1:09:26] remember when brother Aaron was asking
[1:09:29] God when he was filling the role of
[1:09:31] Pastor Here For Those Years while we
[1:09:32] were searching and ask God what's Pastor
[1:09:35] what what is this all about and the Lord
[1:09:37] told him
[1:09:38] the Sheep are Gods they're not the
[1:09:41] pastors
[1:09:42] but being examples
[1:09:45] to the flock
[1:09:46] lead by example
[1:09:48] not by dictate
[1:09:50] and when the chief Shepherd Jesus shall
[1:09:53] appear you shall receive a Crown of
[1:09:54] Glory that fadeth not away
[1:09:59] likewise younger submit yourselves under
[1:10:01] the Elder I think it's a bit of a double
[1:10:03] entender here not exactly a pun but but
[1:10:06] he's telling the younger ones to listen
[1:10:09] to the older ones
[1:10:11] but also to the Elder of the church
[1:10:16] yea all of you be subject one to another
[1:10:19] and be clothed
[1:10:21] clothed enclosed wrapped surrounded
[1:10:25] never appear
[1:10:27] naked never appear without being clothed
[1:10:30] with humility
[1:10:32] for God resists the proud and gives
[1:10:34] grace to the humble
[1:10:36] not false humility
[1:10:38] but Junior wines up here we see Peter
[1:10:40] has described the role or the position
[1:10:42] of an elder
[1:10:44] now brother branham's comment I want to
[1:10:46] read to you is from Hebrews chapter 5
[1:10:48] and 6 number 1 1957.
[1:10:52] yeah I know the type's a little bit
[1:10:54] small again if you sit closer to the
[1:10:56] front seizure to read but I believe
[1:11:00] and the supreme authority
[1:11:02] of the local assembly yes
[1:11:05] Let each Church be its own
[1:11:07] choose its pastors
[1:11:09] it's deacons it's whatever it is and
[1:11:13] then that way
[1:11:14] the man in there has no Bishop over him
[1:11:17] the Holy Spirit wants to speak something
[1:11:20] to that church
[1:11:21] they don't have to ask anybody about
[1:11:23] whether they could do this or do that
[1:11:26] it's the individual in contact with the
[1:11:29] Holy Spirit
[1:11:32] and then Berta Brandon puts out a
[1:11:34] challenge show me by the Bible
[1:11:37] what's greater in the Bible
[1:11:40] than a local Elder
[1:11:42] to a local church
[1:11:44] that's right yes sir the sovereignty of
[1:11:47] the local church each Church in itself
[1:11:49] now Brotherhood that's wonderful
[1:11:52] all churches ought to be in a
[1:11:54] brotherhood like that together like the
[1:11:55] ministers meeting we were in Phoenix on
[1:11:57] Saturday
[1:11:59] but the sovereignty of the local church
[1:12:01] we don't answer
[1:12:03] to that group but we desire to be in
[1:12:06] Fellowship as as brothers and sisters
[1:12:09] and with our sister churches
[1:12:12] go back to the closing verses of Acts
[1:12:15] 14.
[1:12:17] and after they
[1:12:19] Paul and Barnabas had passed through the
[1:12:22] region of facilia they came to the next
[1:12:24] region pamphylia
[1:12:28] and when they Paul and Barnabas had
[1:12:30] preached the word in perga so this is
[1:12:32] another 96 miles 100 miles or so from
[1:12:35] from Antioch it's a town they first came
[1:12:39] to from Cyprus a year or two earlier
[1:12:41] a place from which John Mark had left
[1:12:43] them to go back to Jerusalem
[1:12:45] they went down to the port city of
[1:12:47] Italia another 10 miles don't confuse
[1:12:50] that with Italy it's not Italy it's a
[1:12:53] town
[1:12:54] so you can see this they've come from
[1:12:57] Antioch down to ferga and now right here
[1:13:01] to this little Port City of Italia
[1:13:07] and since from that Port of Italia they
[1:13:10] sailed to Antioch
[1:13:12] about 300 miles from once they had been
[1:13:15] recommended to the grace of God for the
[1:13:17] work
[1:13:18] which they fulfilled
[1:13:21] it's a
[1:13:22] I'm sorry I'm not sorry I'm going to
[1:13:25] share it with you anyway
[1:13:28] they've taken 72 verses
[1:13:30] to get from
[1:13:32] from Antioch of Syria to Derby they've
[1:13:36] taken five verses to get home
[1:13:38] you ever notice how when you're going
[1:13:40] home you just really want to get home
[1:13:42] like I remember one time we had a horse
[1:13:44] that we had purchased for our oldest son
[1:13:46] and we kept them over brother
[1:13:47] mcclintocks because we couldn't keep a
[1:13:49] horse at our place and we went over
[1:13:51] there and this was this was about 1982
[1:13:54] or three something like that
[1:13:56] and and this horse was a was a retired
[1:13:58] barrel racer and and uh and so we took
[1:14:01] her down to a to a place to for the kids
[1:14:04] to ride the horse because that's why you
[1:14:05] have a horse and feed her all that hay
[1:14:07] and knock out the Stalls so you can ride
[1:14:09] it right so our daughter Gloria was
[1:14:11] perched on this pretty good-sized horse
[1:14:13] I don't know how many hands the horse
[1:14:14] was I had four Hooves I don't know how
[1:14:16] many hands
[1:14:17] in it but but Gloria's perched on this
[1:14:19] horse and she's she's about five years
[1:14:21] old or maybe she's six but I think she's
[1:14:24] about five
[1:14:25] and the horse is going around and then
[1:14:28] realizing that wait
[1:14:30] Stables right back over there
[1:14:32] there might be hey there so as soon as
[1:14:35] the horse was pointed
[1:14:37] I've done 72 verses I'm going to do five
[1:14:40] verses now the horse took off through
[1:14:42] the desert
[1:14:44] oh no I mean Gloria's feet didn't reach
[1:14:47] the stirrups right she's just perched on
[1:14:49] the saddle holding the reins and Nikki
[1:14:52] is that's the name of the horse is
[1:14:54] charging back across the desert and
[1:14:56] we're looking and chasing and we see
[1:14:58] Gloria
[1:15:00] and we think boy
[1:15:03] she's going to land in a cactus what's
[1:15:04] happened to our precious daughter we go
[1:15:06] running up to her and Gloria was typical
[1:15:08] Gloria she was up
[1:15:11] Nikki ran away so I jumped
[1:15:18] well I that's not very spiritual but I
[1:15:20] had to share that with you
[1:15:23] so so here's a map of their of their
[1:15:26] whole journey
[1:15:27] from from where they started to where
[1:15:30] they came back
[1:15:32] and and all of this uh all of that
[1:15:34] you're seeing here is is this last part
[1:15:36] of the journey we've read about in Acts
[1:15:37] 14.
[1:15:39] they've been gone for about two years
[1:15:42] according to most estimates
[1:15:45] they didn't travel in airplanes trains
[1:15:48] or buses
[1:15:49] they didn't have air-conditioned hotels
[1:15:51] to sleep in
[1:15:52] nice restaurants to eat in
[1:15:55] churches along the way to support them
[1:15:57] they didn't have access to API ATMs to
[1:16:00] withdraw funds no credit cards
[1:16:03] no telephones no telegraphs no internet
[1:16:07] No cameras to take pictures or videos to
[1:16:09] share with the folks back home
[1:16:12] no big suitcases with wheels to take the
[1:16:15] Wardrobe that they need to be gone for
[1:16:16] two years
[1:16:18] through heat and cold through desert and
[1:16:21] Mountain through snow
[1:16:23] every kind of climate you can imagine
[1:16:25] there in southern turkey is pretty harsh
[1:16:27] pretty extreme
[1:16:30] dry and damp and wet All Seasons
[1:16:33] inclined no consulates from which they
[1:16:36] could seek help if the local authorities
[1:16:37] gave them a hard time
[1:16:39] no hot showers
[1:16:41] no shampoo
[1:16:43] no body wash
[1:16:44] no recordings of sermons to listen to
[1:16:46] and be inspired by
[1:16:49] no music players
[1:16:51] not even Bibles to carry around and mark
[1:16:54] up or read
[1:16:57] no skulls or code disease the New
[1:16:59] Testament didn't exist
[1:17:01] these are the people that wrote it they
[1:17:03] hadn't written it yet
[1:17:05] not even the four gospel accounts
[1:17:08] they were preaching the gospel winning
[1:17:10] converts in hostile places using
[1:17:13] scriptures from what we call the Old
[1:17:14] Testament and most of that was
[1:17:16] recitation for memory if they were in a
[1:17:19] synagogue and the synagogue happened to
[1:17:21] have this goal of the Prophet or the or
[1:17:24] whatever they were reading then they
[1:17:26] could read it but synagogues didn't have
[1:17:28] a complete set of Scrolls a very very
[1:17:30] very expensive
[1:17:34] so what they had
[1:17:36] was what they could remember
[1:17:39] from what we call the Old Testament
[1:17:42] and the moving of the spirit backing up
[1:17:46] what they were saying because they were
[1:17:47] saying something very new
[1:17:53] what are our excuses
[1:17:57] I have I don't have an excuse
[1:18:00] don't talk to me about America in 1957.
[1:18:04] I think nearly everybody in this
[1:18:06] audience came to Christ after 1957.
[1:18:10] that what brother Brandon said about
[1:18:12] 1957 it's true and it was true back then
[1:18:16] but this is 60 years later
[1:18:19] don't talk to me about 1963 or 1965.
[1:18:24] if you have breath in your body
[1:18:27] and if your body is still aging
[1:18:29] then we have one task
[1:18:32] and we've been commanded to do that by
[1:18:35] Jesus himself
[1:18:37] spread the gospel
[1:18:40] it's too hard it's too hard Jesus
[1:18:44] specific words to the lukewarm last age
[1:18:48] be zealous therefore
[1:18:51] and repent the musicians could please
[1:18:54] return
[1:18:56] but the last two verses acts 14 when
[1:18:59] they were come and had gathered the
[1:19:01] church together they rehearsed all that
[1:19:04] God had done with them how we had opened
[1:19:07] the door of faith
[1:19:09] unto the Gentiles
[1:19:11] first Peter with Cornelius group in
[1:19:14] caesarea now Paul and Barnabas in the
[1:19:16] various cities of pamphilia pasidia
[1:19:19] galatio what is now Southern turkey
[1:19:24] it's a partial fulfillment of ananias
[1:19:26] word from the Lord that we read in Acts
[1:19:28] 9 15.
[1:19:30] Saul's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear
[1:19:32] my name before the Gentiles and kings
[1:19:34] and children of Israel
[1:19:36] and there an Antioch of Syria they
[1:19:40] Poland barnabis Abode a long time months
[1:19:43] years
[1:19:44] with the disciples
[1:19:48] that's the complete
[1:19:50] acts 13 and 14.
[1:19:52] my brothers and sisters in Christ
[1:19:55] let's spread the gospel
[1:19:57] be like those early Christians if we
[1:20:00] could pray together one more time
[1:20:02] Lord Jesus
[1:20:04] it's encouraging and it's challenging
[1:20:07] and it's sobering to read about the
[1:20:11] sacrifices that were made by these early
[1:20:14] Christians going out just with your word
[1:20:18] that said go and you went with them
[1:20:21] Lord and and
[1:20:24] miraculous things happen wonderful
[1:20:26] things happen we're here today but
[1:20:29] because of what they did because of what
[1:20:32] you did through them help us Lord help
[1:20:34] me Lord to not just
[1:20:38] say things but to do things
[1:20:41] Lord help us all to be doers of the word
[1:20:45] to express your love to this generation
[1:20:49] we see around us that is dying and lost
[1:20:53] help us Lord we commit ourselves again
[1:20:57] to you in Jesus precious name
[1:21:00] I wonder as we turn this service over to
[1:21:03] our pastor
[1:21:05] I'd like to sing an old gospel song It
[1:21:07] Was Written there are various things say
[1:21:09] 1887 or 1890. it's called send the light
[1:21:13] I think you may be familiar with it

[1:21:21] there's a call comes ringing or the
[1:21:25] Restless waves and the light send the
[1:21:30] light

[1:24:58] forevermore saw the map that our brother
[1:25:02] Paul and brother Barnabas how much they
[1:25:04] went around and they they traveled all
[1:25:07] those miles
[1:25:09] and I think and as brotherly I was
[1:25:11] speaking I was I was thinking that that
[1:25:14] was a time past
[1:25:16] all of those dangers that they faced and
[1:25:19] all that they did that was for a Time
[1:25:21] past but preaching the gospel is more
[1:25:25] needed today than it was at that time
[1:25:28] back then
[1:25:30] but Lewis we don't have to go to Congo
[1:25:32] we can spread the gospel right here we
[1:25:35] can spread the gospel to our neighbors
[1:25:37] we can spread the gospel to our friends
[1:25:39] to the students at school we can spread
[1:25:43] this same gospel that they spread and as
[1:25:46] our brother said every miracle that
[1:25:48] happened whether it was raising up from
[1:25:51] the dead whether was healing a Layman
[1:25:54] whatever it was it was for one purpose
[1:25:56] and that was to preach the gospel
[1:25:59] because those people every single single
[1:26:02] one of them that rose up whether it be
[1:26:05] crippled or whether they be dead they
[1:26:06] all died again but if they got got that
[1:26:09] gospel they they have eternal life and
[1:26:12] they will never die god brother Lewis if
[1:26:15] you come up and enclose my brother I
[1:26:19] want to read a quote real quick brother
[1:26:21] Lyle I fact checked him
[1:26:26] this is this is what brother Branham
[1:26:28] said in 1956 December 30th
[1:26:32] he said speaking of what he said about
[1:26:35] Paul and how Paul was stoned
[1:26:39] he said this
[1:26:40] we believe by faith we receive it
[1:26:43] but if the brother not disputing with
[1:26:45] him I don't believe that but if the
[1:26:47] brother would have only read that how
[1:26:49] Paul was stoned to death
[1:26:53] and the Saints stood over him and prayed
[1:26:56] till they come back to till life come
[1:27:00] back into him amen
[1:27:03] our brother our brother Paul went
[1:27:06] through a hard time
[1:27:07] but I promise you brother Jeremy it was
[1:27:09] worth every single moment everything
[1:27:12] that he did it was it was worth every
[1:27:14] every step every mile every storm on the
[1:27:18] ship it was worth it all and Friends it
[1:27:22] is worth it to us to witness about this
[1:27:25] gospel that Jesus Christ saves that he
[1:27:28] heals and he will be for there for us
[1:27:31] when we crossed into the oversight other
[1:27:34] side if we will just believe on him
[1:27:38] brother can you just say a few words or
[1:27:40] just whatever you have on your heart
[1:27:42] brother Lewis good to see you
[1:27:51] praise the Lord
[1:27:53] surely we can say that the Lord has been
[1:27:55] so good to us
[1:27:57] and we go to the house of the Lord we we
[1:28:00] are coming under the expectation
[1:28:04] and that can just say thank you to from
[1:28:06] the bottom of my heart
[1:28:07] because the voice of God
[1:28:10] still a living voice
[1:28:14] we can surely say what a responsibility
[1:28:18] when we hear this gospel
[1:28:22] and our Prophet said
[1:28:25] we have more responsibility today
[1:28:28] than what they heard back then because
[1:28:32] we have received
[1:28:34] not only the world but the living world
[1:28:39] and we have seen so much
[1:28:42] we are living in the dying generation
[1:28:46] what responsibility
[1:28:48] what will you say to the Lord my
[1:28:50] brothers and sisters
[1:28:53] you have received Christ in you the hope
[1:28:56] of glory
[1:28:57] when people are dying everywhere every
[1:29:01] corner every street
[1:29:03] and we do have Jesus as a living God
[1:29:06] Amen may the Lord richly bless his
[1:29:09] servant
[1:29:11] and I can just say I've been praying and
[1:29:14] I say Lord speak unto me and the surely
[1:29:17] I said I don't know about you
[1:29:20] but if I have to say something today God
[1:29:23] has been so good and the Lord has speak
[1:29:25] in my heart
[1:29:27] yes I spoke to the Lord today in the top
[1:29:30] of the month and with my children I went
[1:29:32] up there I said father God I heard a
[1:29:35] request
[1:29:37] this voice was coming to me from the
[1:29:40] from India I just came from India Andhra
[1:29:44] Pradesh preaching the gospel we have
[1:29:46] seen a living God Amen and I told my
[1:29:49] children
[1:29:51] when I come back I'm going to Arizona
[1:29:55] I need God to speak to my heart amen
[1:29:58] to my church
[1:30:00] I said I have to go I feel like I have
[1:30:03] to go over there
[1:30:04] and on the top of the mountain I said
[1:30:06] Lord speak it to me I know you got a
[1:30:09] different way of letting your children
[1:30:11] know what is your will
[1:30:13] but I'm going to church under the
[1:30:15] expectation
[1:30:17] and I just want a God to speak to me
[1:30:19] surely I said the Lord spoke in my heart
[1:30:24] and I say thank you so much thank you
[1:30:28] richly
[1:30:30] being able to obey to the voice of God
[1:30:33] that God has used a precious brother as
[1:30:36] a vessel maybe it was not for you
[1:30:41] but I can say 100 percent
[1:30:43] it was mine
[1:30:45] when it was for all of us
[1:30:47] you know what the prophet said
[1:30:49] if you cannot go
[1:30:51] at least you can do something you can
[1:30:53] pray for those who will step up
[1:30:57] because we cannot be keeping on living
[1:30:59] when we see dying people all over the
[1:31:02] places
[1:31:02] [Music]

[1:31:14] pews
[1:31:15] like a dead people when we have received
[1:31:18] Living God
[1:31:20] it is time and I say it's good enough
[1:31:23] when I hear his voice
[1:31:25] I receive now I have to act upon it
[1:31:29] because the Holy Ghost
[1:31:32] has spoken amen may the Lord richly
[1:31:35] bless the servant the servant my
