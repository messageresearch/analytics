and sister heather johnson and not feeling well tonight and home so just remember them and whatever you have the lord is mindful of it and we say that a lot but he is mindful he's that high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities come on up brother dan he can move on your behalf today he's already paid the price but the brandon would often say if jesus christ was standing here in my suit he couldn't heal you because he's already done it so if we believe that that he's already healed us already saved us let's just go to him in faith [Music] let's pray lord we just thank you god for being with us today and for bringing us here together church might not be full but we are certainly full with people that want to praise the lord and we just ask you to come be with us

he's alive and well i appreciate that i appreciate the word of god i appreciate his presence you know but without you all being here it wouldn't it wouldn't be the same so i'm glad you're all here too so thank you i appreciate it brother peter singing that song lord i bless your name because i wanted to sing it it's already been sung so amen thank you god bless you while you're standing let's let's read that the first verse there with the jeremy from psalms 118 verse 6 the lord is on my side i will not fear what can man do unto me amen let's just bow our heads lord we we have the undefeated one the greatest champion ever the one that that that created this universe this earth put it all together laid it all out made all the plans and has brought them to pass lord standing with us today a champion lord like no other champion one who humbled himself one who took on the form of man so that he could understand us lord we appreciate that today we want to talk about you we want to exalt you we want to lift you up today lord may you be honored and please lord today we ask in jesus christ's name amen thank you you may be seated i have so much it's i'm i just all day today is lord i don't know how but i just asked him to have his way on monday night i couldn't sleep i think it was up till one it was just burning so much and so i just couldn't get away from it yesterday around 10 30 i said i need to go to sleep because and the lord let me have a good night's sleep but this afternoon after i got home the same just burning in my heart lord and i said would you let me just yield myself and surrender myself and let you speak so trust that he would do and and while i was doing some some studying on this and it's i would call it why fear part two but it's it's part of that the eternal side of god the as brother branham said his eternals and that's who he is an eternal one and we're talking about i was talking with my wife on the way in we were talking about the other on the other side when brother branham crossed over for that short period of time and he's trying to explain it in words and he can't find words in a way to explain what that other dimension is what it is to be in a in a glorified body and he still was in his body because of his reactions you can tell and he would say it's like this but but it's not like this human feeling but god allowed him to have a time and end and i i was asking the lord could we just have a time like that today just to enter into that presence a little bit to just to encourage our hearts and and some things and just i i would i read scripture of the day and it tied in and the daily strength had something that fit right in and quote of the day had something to fit right in and sometimes when you're looking at it certain way everything just fits right in and i just i i was listening to a song that somebody posted and and they they were singing and it was songs started out and i'm just going to paraphrase a little bit of it and it just says you know i may not have a whole lot and i may be poor and i'm evening but i have a soul that is worth ten thousand worlds and that that just began to to even more so and to think he could have called ten thousand angels to destroy the world and set him free but he said no for you i will go through this so it made me think about adam and eve they were created beings and and they were part of this earth and brother branham gets into it quite a bit god created this earth he'd say this earth where he took us and he formed us out of it and he created so we're part of that creation he says you were part of him and when you begin to look at the whole picture as much as as we can but to think they're being created not knowing sin not knowing anything wrong nothing nothing waking up in the morning and saying you know it's going to be a tough day or nothing like that at this time and myself brother arnie were talking a little bit before service started and do you think adam knew he said that she was going to fall i don't know but they must have known something about that serpent because he was there i don't think it caught him by surprise in that sense i i'm just just me thinking just me speaking here and then they were cast out but they had to have time stopped and looked back that way and said oh to be over there again you know and i was telling my wife i said here i am and she knows how i would i would get up and i'd sit on the edge of the bed and then i'd go sit at the desk for a while and and some more and just it was just burning but i said in the middle of that i would remember oh yeah but tomorrow don't forget you got to do this and and remember you got to go do that job that they just added on because we're still on this side you know so i was looking at something and it was interesting and it said indian proverbs so i said that's interesting let's see what that is and i may not pronounce these indian tribes correctly but the first one is acaiwa and it was there is no fear in faith and i said oh by by accident that got put there you know no there is no fear in faith and then the next one by the mingos mingles tribe if you see no reason for giving thanks the fault lies in yourself i mean there is reason to give thanks always to be a thankful people and again i may not pronounce it but i think it's the oglala tribe that there can never be peace between nations until first you know the true peace in the soul of man the god of peace has to live in here or there can be peace and i thought wow sometimes in our minds we think that we discovered all this we knew but no this was all god is eternal and and the i'm not even going to try to say this tribe i never even heard of and he said as it is less of a problem to be poor than to be dishonest and i thought about it's true sometimes we're dishonest with ourselves the lakota tribe if you continue to contaminate your home you will suffer kate in your own waste it was just i was reading i was reading to my wife and she was trying to go to sleep and i kept cheyenne it says i seek strength not to be better than my brother but to battle my most significant enemy myself and bro it reminded me when brother branham asked that chief who wins the battle between the two dogs the white and the black the chief says it depends on the one i feed the most and so it was just one thing after another so i'm like lord how how do i do this but let's just see what god will do for us today be still and know that i am god be at peace be at rest quit trying to fight it yourself quit getting in the way sometimes and let him be god he says psalms 118 6 that we read the lord is on my side i will not fear what can man do unto me jeremiah 29 11 we quote it quite a bit for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end you quote it every day every five minutes it is still the truth john 10 28-29 the book of john 10 28-29 and i'm i'm going to go through this part quickly because i want to get to to a part i want to spend more time on and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand so we go back to the verse psalms 118 what can man do unto me can't take him out take you out of god's hands they try to stone stephen to death and what did god say allow him to see i see jesus sitting on the right hand of god what can man do unto me my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand amen revelations 1 17 17-18 and i saw and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and death you know brother brandon say talks about it how satan had his feet up and he says i finally got him and suddenly there's a knock on the door and he said who could that be go see and he says ah you're here i've got you and he says oh no no i've just come to redeem claim back that which was lost amen he's the same yesterday today and forever ephesians 2 8-10 for by grace you are saved through faith by grace god giving it to you but you have to accept it by faith brother branham said faith is a revelation and you know when you come to a time in your life maybe in your work something you're doing when suddenly it's like oh wow that's all it is that's all it takes that's you struggled with it and then it suddenly went together and that's what faith does when it clicks into your heart and you realize god's in charge of this he has it in his hands all i have to do is trust him i don't have to work through it i don't have to try to make it happen i just give it to god and say lord it's in your hands therefore i can praise you i can worship you i can give you honor and glory because it's in your hands and you never fail it would be nice if we could say that about each other but it doesn't always work that way we have the best intentions but we fail but he never fails he says for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves and i'm glad it's not of myself it is a gift of god grace without any respect to human worthiness he never said if you get this much a level of worthiness i'll finish it with grace he just said grace amen not of works lest any man should boast but lord i prayed all last week i didn't miss i if you're doing it for works it's of no avail if you're doing it because you love him you want her closer then it'll do you much good but when you say you know really what you're doing is i prayed all day click check i prayed all day check you're making a checklist it's for you not for him you know work out your own salvation with fear and trembling you do it's for you not for him he knows you're his he's not unsure of it he knows your hiss he says not by works neither this faith nor this salvation is owing to any works you ever did will do or can do when is it enough works to save yourself it never comes for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them god already said this is what you're going to be this is what you're going to do lord let me yield to that let me say lord i'm in your hands we're the ones that struggle with it every part of this was by his planning and doing you say that i'm a puppet no he gave you free moral agency but he also knew that he would choose to say yes lord and that's what it's still all in his hands he philippians 2 13 for it is god that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure he wants this out of you but he lets you he works it in you and i appreciate that of god because if it was left up to me on some days it would be good and on sundays it would be bad because you know you have your ups and downs in this life psalms 86 5 for thou lord art good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all of them that call upon thee and i just typed in there you're more than enough how much is enough whatever it is he's more than that if it's one he's two if it's two he's three through eternity psalms 103 we'll go through verses one and four and then eight to twelve and like i said i'm gonna go through this quickly just as a background because i want to get into something here bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name let everything in me just give him praise everything let him praise be praised to him first you said well i i you know i want to do something nice for my wife but not because i'm a good person but because god has done it in me let it let him get glory out of it because then the motive is right the action is right it's not trying to be nice to her so i can get something back from her it's because the love of god is flowing through there he says bless the lord o my soul and forget not his benefits and i looked up the word benefits something that produces good or helpful results or affects or that promotes well-being so all his benefits promote well-being even when he says no you know sometimes when you say no to a child daddy and mama don't love me no more but you get a little bit older and you look back and say no it's because daddy and mama love me that they told me no who forgiveth all thine iniquities the things that you know better to do you do it anyways and the things that you should be doing but you don't he forgives you on that too now sometimes as parents we have a trouble forgiving that part i told you to do this and you didn't do it now you're going to get punished more for that but god doesn't do it that way hey that's a good louder man from brother hey we're parents okay you know how we do that sometimes well the girls will get in trouble in church when they were little and i would say now you know when you're in trouble in church you're going to get in trouble at home too and i i'm probably the only dad that did this maybe not but then we on the way home or so i would say well because you misbehaved when we get home you have your choice you can go straight to bed or you can get a spanking and then have a uh something to eat and go to bed and you know i don't know some of you are probably judging me right now but that's what i did and one day sarah had misbehaved in church and he got home and i told her that and i said now what do you choose and she said i choose for spanking so i spanked her and then i sent her to bed i didn't keep my word and she never let me forget she still doesn't let me forget because we're human but he forgiveth all fine iniquities and remember them no more who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies he takes your life from the pit he encompathy with loving-kindness and tender mercies even when you feel like you didn't deserve it and you know you didn't deserve it he does anyways the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy he will not always chide neither will keep his anger forever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us after our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy towards them that fear him respect him reverence know who he is and love him fear not being afraid of him but rather giving him the honor and respect that he deserves and as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us how else could he look at us how else could he stand it's because he's holy he's righteous if the angels have to cover their face with two of their wings who have never sinned and never and stand in his presence and they can't look at him how could we without him forgiving us he claims this it's it's more than sometimes you can even believe and understand psalms 46 1-5 god is our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble you know what that tells me i don't have to call him from way over there to bring him down here say lord and he tells me you know what i'm on the other side of town right now it's going to take me a while to get there but he's a very present help in the time of trouble he said i'll never leave you i'll never leave you i'll be by your side he says therefore we will we will not therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountain be carried into the midst of the sea and let me tell you what about this earth you're living in right now this portion of this earth and though that part be moved though the doctor says this about you though this he says therefore we will not fear we will not let uh something take a hold of us that that ties us down that holds us down that where we can't move we can't walk forward we we can't even praise god sometimes fear will do that to you you can't even you can't even voice out anything you're just frozen in place but i will not do that in the midst of all of this i will still praise him i will still worship him and i'll still give him honor and glory he says and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters therefore thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof and then he says there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacle of the most high god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early before you're up he's up there already lord i'm getting up at two o'clock in the morning to for this and that and he said well i've been up since one waiting for you i'm going over here don't worry he says i've been there it'll be okay psalms 27 1-5 and these are all well-known but i was just looking through some of these things the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear you know who i need to fear the least myself because i get afraid of myself i get scared of myself in the sense that oh you messed up again you did this again you're not even worthy god won't hear your prayers but you know if you're looking at yourself that's as far as you go but look at his promises that he made to you and say then i have no nothing to fear i just have to say lord i'm sorry it's pretty simple get on your knees wherever you're at say lord i'm sorry i didn't mean to do that the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies in my foes and that's not your neighbor that's mostly you came up upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and they fell have you ever applied that to yourself you give yourself most of your trouble sorry kids your parents didn't give you that much trouble you created a lot of it yourself but you know what when you would come to a mother and a father that loved you and said you know i did this and i was wrong and they said i love you anyways how much more him who could look past all of the outer and go down the inner and see your heart was not there to do that though and whole should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple david is looking here at a literal temple a place that was made that's what desire but you know we come we gather here we this is known as tucson tabernacle we come together here but you are the temple of the lord and this should be part of every day all the time to behold the beauty of the lord right in your own life and inquiring the temple because this is to his temple right here talk with him sometimes we put it in a little place over there but no it's you and god for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock in a solid place that's the word of god that's the promises of god and it's yea and amen never fails so now i want to go to where where where i really wanted to get to here if i may may the lord help me just to to share it this way isaiah chapter 1 verse 18. last wednesday night we talked about him being our kinsmen and redeemer kinsmen somebody related to you you say god related to me yes he took on human flesh to become your kinsmen redeemer because that's what the law required he says come now let us reason together saith the lord so what did you bring to this reasoning sins that were scarlet and then what did he bring to this reasoning together they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be wool pure white clean lord this is all i have to you and the best i can give you is nothing but nothing and he says well i can take that nothing and make it into something that's in isaiah the first chapter he's talking let's reason this and then he goes to in verse 7 verse 14 and these are very well known familiar verses therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign in this reasoning that he's talking about he'll give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel god with us now he's doing something about that reasoning time together isaiah 9 6-7 look now isaiah 9 verse 6 and 7 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace when i say jesus what do i get i get the head of the government that's on his shoulder i get him and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god everlasting father the prince of peace when you call my name you say brother aaron this is who you get whether you like it or not it's who you get but he said come let's reason together this is what you bring let me show you what i'm bringing of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this and he keeps his word he never fails so i want to get into this we'll read those quotes there out of i'm going to go ahead and and no we'll read all of them we'll start with that first one from israel and the church and then we're going to read a series out of the breach between the seven church ages in the seven seals look he says and jesus said if a house be divided against itself if satan cast out satan then his kingdom is divided don't you don't you underestimate the devil he says that's right he's too smart for that satan ain't going to cast himself out he just got you confused that's all no sir satan can't cast out satan me cast myself out why i know better than that notice and don't you underestimate jesus christ either because he's the power over all powers don't be afraid of satan as long as you're in him as long as you're in jesus he says but if you're not him you better tremble but if you're in him not even death itself can harm you you're free from all fear oh when i think of that i want to shout hallelujah amen when you realize i'm in him and he's in me so i had thought about playing this portion but i i broke it up just to shorten it up in some portions so we'll read through it the breach all this this series will be in the breach and this is the portion of the kinsman redeemer when john's there in revelations 5 and john is looking and he says who hears who is worthy to open the book and and brother branham describes it so let's just read it first and and then an angel came forth a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book to take the book who was able to open the seals who who was able to open the book see the angel asked it and john sought he said now who is worthy let him oh my maybe i'm just filling this this this away but led him said the angel let him here is the book of redemption here is the plan of redemption here is the only way you'll ever be redeemed for here is a title deed to redemption of the whole heavens of the earth that which was lost when adam and eve disobeyed they were the gods of this earth it listened to them it was subject to them there was no fear there was no hatred there was no animal against the lion could lay down by the lamb but it was lost he says let them come forth if he will oh my now speak or forever hold this peace let him come forward and claim this book who is worthy do it to do it and john said there was no man in heaven found worthy no man on earth found worthy no man beneath the earth that ever lived and died was found worthy no man was found worthy the angel's call was a call to the kinsmen redeemer to appear god said i have a law a kinsmen redeemer can be a substitute where is that kinsmen redeemer who is able to take it and it come from adam all the way down through all the apostles and prophets and everything else and nobody was found now what about that nobody in heaven nobody on earth nobody ever lived elijah was standing there moses was standing there all the apostles were standing there or all the ones that had died all the holy men job the sages everyone was standing there and nobody was worthy even to look at the book let alone take and break the seals could you imagine being there in front and you're asking for help and all you hear nobody can nobody will nobody is able to that's all you see well after a while you're just going to throw your hands up and say it's useless it's no hope he says and he wasn't found so john broke out oh everything was lost and he wept bitterly and and he was sad because everything the whole creation everything was gone if they couldn't find somebody hold glory to god if they couldn't find somebody that can meet the requirements there every human being and the whole world in creation was gone oh everything had fallen the rights of redemption the rights of eternal life the light all these rights had been forfeited and there was nobody who could pay the price and john starts crying because no one was worthy and no one could ever look at the book oh it took a human being john wept because no one could do it and everything was lost i don't know how john must have felt to be in the presence of all that and said but nobody here can do this nobody has a key to unlock it and the despair and the hopelessness that would come upon you john looked at that lamb now i i've jumped ahead here because he repeats himself over and over but the lamb has come to take the book and he says john looked at that lamb and the lamb looked like he had been slain and then he noticed he was wounded and cut and bruised and bleeding a bloody dam that's what took our plate place isn't it strange a simple lamb had to take our place and he saw the lamb he proceeded out john hadn't saw him because he had been way back into the eternities even making intercession and showing that those who who had come to god under the offering of the blood of bulls and goats a substitutionary offering he also caused them who believed it pointed to him god shall provide when isaac asked abraham father where is the sacrifice he said god will provide and the blood had not been yet been shed so he was there to clear them he was there to clear you and i and oh god i hope he is here tonight for every sinner the lamb been slain how can jehovah see anything but that bloody lamb standing there what he's been he's been an intercessor no other person tell me where mary could make the intercessions then what could mary offer who what could saint francis saint assisi or any saint cecilia rather or any other human being john never saw a thousand saints come out of the mediatorial he was the lamb he was a lamb that had been slain bloody i don't care how many saints had been slain they were all duet every one of them like the thief at the cross we have sinned and we are due this but this man has done nothing he was the only man that was worthy the lamb is the only mediator see he was the one that came forth what did he do now he's been back there inner city interceding until his blood has a tone for every person and the lamb now knows what's written in the book so he's known from the foundation of the world their names were in there so he stood back here and but done mediator work like this until meditorial work till everyone that's been put in the book has been redeemed come and i will not lose a single one of them he says he stayed there till he made sure every one of them notice he is not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon that on who was that the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand and no angel no angelic being nothing else could take that place and this bloody lamb walked out took the book out of his hand what was it brother it is the most sublime thing in the scripture an act that not an angel or nothing could do it so he said father not my will thy will be done the most sublime act he says and the lamb come and took it and they're in there i didn't and didn't include it in there but there's one where that lamb is telling the father he says you know i did i he was the only one that could stand and and say i did i was the one i took care of it i met the requirements and it's been met but i just that thought and the sublime the most sublime it's a blink work that has ever been done it should make our heart so happy it should make us rejoice to think that he said i'm going to restore them i'm going to bring them back why because he wants that fellowship that he had in the beginning when adam and eve were there nothing to interfere no fear no no no contrary spirit it was nothing but pure love it was god expressing that with that part of him that he created and you were in that earth there too that he created and he's desiring that fellowship with you and he says i want to do this i want to go back i want to bring them back to me because he desires it it made me think and as time of adam and eve standing there on the outside looking back and saying oh how much they must have missed it how much their heart desired to go back there but they couldn't there was a chairman's with a flaming sword to guard the way of life it could not be perverted in any way it could not be broken down and we had to remain pure but the desire was still there and and and i was talking with brother arne imagine what adam and eve must have felt when cain kills abel it tore their hearts apart to see that one son would destroy the other they had to know why they were still so close to god they had to know the reason why but it still broke their hearts the story got carried out each one is would tell it to their children and the children's children what it used to be like i didn't have to come out here and pull the weeds i didn't have to sweat i just spoke and those things happened brother and that sounds like a fantasy world call it what you want but it's what it was it was what god had made in the first place but they'd fallen away from it and god desiring that fellowship again to walk with his children to be with his children to come in the cool of the evening and say how was your day you know what happened and they would begin to talk with him and just have a wonderful fellowship no they didn't roast any steaks uh first thing we thought we're gonna have hamburgers and this we're gonna do no you know what it was a fellowship a pure honest truthful a place which you could lay down and sleep with no fear whatsoever you could rest with no fear whatsoever he could come in the cool of the evening and and they'd be waiting for him but one day he comes back in the cool of the evening and they're not at the usual place and he says adam where art thou he knew where they were adam and eve had hid they said we can't be in the presence of a holy god anymore we have sinned we have fallen from his grace he'll look at us and he'll say no i can't even be around you anymore. so how how are we going to meet god let's cover ourselves some way let's oh let's take these fake leaves are the big let's make something let's make a covering let's make a religion to get ourselves back to god and if we're not careful we still make a religion to get ourselves to god if i can do some of this if i get enough of this if i can read so many scriptures and pray so much i'll make a good covering to give myself into the presence of god no he said come let's read a reason together you bring your best works and they are filthy but i'll bring what i've done and your sins will be white again it'll be as never happened before and that's what he did when he took the book and said i have taken it have cleared it oh what a savior oh what a mighty god one that's worthy to be worshipped and praised and honored and exalted high above anything else to think that you see through there in the book of ruth a perfect type in the law of a kinsmen redeemer and all she had to do was rest and let him do the work but it doesn't take long when we want to help him we want to get in the middle of it i can help you daddy i can hold this end of it i can do this i can do that abby sent us a picture the other day a snap of amos working on the truck he's restoring and little asher sprawled out there in his pants and all under the truck with daddy like i can help you daddy you know that's a neat picture but you know what daddy daddy is really doesn't need him there because he can't help him right now you know and sometimes we get in the middle of the picture and say lord i can help you if i do this it'll help you and he says no i don't need your help i just need your rest your peace i just need you to take me out my word i just need you to just express that confidence in what i've done take it by faith for without faith it is impossible to please god because without faith fear comes in and fear brings works and fear brings things i've got to do this i haven't done enough i haven't met this and i've got to work harder harder and harder but jesus paid it all all to him i owe now what you do back to god is not for salvation but because you love him because you want to love him and show your love and respect back to him that's a true relationship right there we go through the scriptures and and each one uh the different the different books showing a portion of this work a part of it and and you look into indu i think it was my daughter elizabeth that she's reading through the book of jeremiah and it seems like god is angry through the whole book of jeremiah he's constantly telling him but then jeremiah 29 11 turn around says i know the plans that i have towards you i know what you look like and i know what i'm saying but i know what i'm going to accomplish in this he's not afraid of it he's not saying oh i've lost it look at him when he turns around and he tells moses get out of the way i'm going to destroy these people and i'm going to raise up a whole new nation that will serve me do you think he was surprised by moses answer no he knew what was coming when moses said oh no you're not you're going to have to go through me because what are they going to say about you they're going to say you're like any other god but you're the god of gods you're the only true god he knows exactly what he's doing and what's going on to know that to see as what he did through each each one and and you read the stories you get into the book of daniel and and what daniel goes through and and in the process of what he puts daniel through to be able to bring out to what is going to happen later on in life how it's all going to be fulfilled each one of the prophets laying out something that is a portion of god although sometimes it seemed like all it was god was angry at israel because it seemed like all they did was fail them i'm sorry but sometimes that seems like us isn't it it seems like all we do is fail you lord if i could just stay in this atmosphere a little longer lord i know i could please you and then like i said suddenly you remember you got to go do this the phone rings something happens and and that is broken but he knows what he's doing to bring that up oh what a savior what a kinsmen reading to think that isaiah there 7 and 14 behold a virgin shall conceive man is going to not have anything to do with us and his name shall be called emmanuel god with us wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace and he begins to explain as he's talking and he's laying this out in the book of isaiah but the day comes when the angel comes and says hail mary blessed art thou thou has found favor and you know brother branham if you read there and brother and was talking and and i know sometimes that you say well it was just brother brad i'm talking but he was a prophet and god sent his thoughts to the prophet am i saying that it happened exactly like brother no he just allowed it to be but it's giving us and letting us go she was just as human as you and i but she's saying how can this be but something in her heart said this is the promise of isaiah she said she said that something did something let her say be it unto me according to thy word something made her react to that that was god in her working because it was not going to be mary producing this it was god it was going to produce this because he was going back to isaiah and saying that's going to be fulfilled because there's going to come a day that this book of redemption is going to have to be opened and there's only going to be one worthy one to do it he grows up in life and me and brother arnie were talking about it he grew up and and and and he learned by his experiences he had to learn how to get along with his brothers he had to learn how to get along with mother and father he had to learn to get along all around him because he wore a human a body and made a flesh so he could understand that so he could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities it's hard to understand but yes that's what he did so when you say i'm having trouble i'm having these feelings i'm going through this he says i understand i've been there the scripture says he was tempted in tried in every manner that man is tried in i can't explain it but his word says so so amen it's true he comes to a place in his life look he goes into the temple and and and the priests there are selling they're buying they're they're making merchandise there it's their business and he takes a road and a rope and he cords it up or records and makes a rope out of it and he whips them and he beats them out of the out of the you've made my father's house a den of thieves he showed a sight of him that could have taken a rope and whipped this nation into obedience but watch him when he's there at calvary at the cross before he's there and they're spitting on him and they're slapping them they're plucking their beard and he's not answering he's meek he's humble he's lowly as a lamb because he's fulfilling that for you and for me he uttered not a word he said i could call angels in there but he had you in mind you were part of him that's why and he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing this is that kinsmen redeemer and he's looking he's there he's looking over he's checking he's could i say he's going through the scriptures and saying is this fulfilled is this fulfilled is that promise fulfilled is this covered is this done it is finished every bit of it is covered the way for redemption the road back has been made clear but he didn't stop there he didn't say that's enough his blood had been shed he said it is finished and gave up the ghost and he says now i'm going to go down to that place where they deserve to go and i'm going in their place down into the pits of hell and i'm going to take the keys of death in hell and i'm going to tear them out of that squatter's hands the one that took him and they're not his they're mine and i'm going back for those who died under the blood of bulls and goats those who died with that sacrifice laying on the altar saying it's what he said they struck and they put the the blood on the post and the death angel passed by them i'm going there for them so that job could say i know my redeemer liveth that's him there so so abraham could turn around and look at sarah and say that city that we were looking for there it is he says i'm going to fulfill that part oh the joy in him to be able to do that that part come on saints he said let's get out of here we're going back up to that place now it is finished the work has been done worthy is the lamb and then he comes back you know just going through this portion of the new testament just he's been crucified he's been put in a grave they saw it they saw it happen they knew where they went they went back to their avenue where he had been laid they didn't have to go ask peter and then ran back to it but he wasn't there anymore and they go hide they're afraid but mary and them come looking now mary and them came looking to anoint his body they expected him to be in the grave they brought oils tonight but had he not said in three days i will rise has he not said i will never forsake you and then sometimes you're saying where are you god we're still the same but he's still the same he never fails and he tells mary go tell my disciples that i am risen i've already done it all i've gone down their redemption plan i have risen but there's there's two two brothers walking back to emmaus two of the two of those that gathered at church and were part of it and they're what and they're broken heart they're going back home it's over and he draws himself nigh close to them not because he didn't know but because he did know what they were going through what they were thinking what they were feeling he drew nigh to them and he said what manner of conversation what are you guys talking about you know and and they turn around and look at him and say where have you been this has been in the news i mean it's made all i mean every station is carrying it haven't you heard this jesus of nathers whom we thought he's been crucified and it's been three days now and he begins to walk with him aren't you glad that he still walks with you he draws nigh he draws up close even when you've made a mess of your life he'll still drop nice draw up close and say i'll walk with you all the way until and they didn't surprise him when they said come come in and eat with us he knew where he was going to be he knew what he was going to do he said good now i'm going to get to show you who i am by many infallible proofs it showed what was written had been fulfilled and then they see him oh and don't let me forget this i love this part and peter 2. i think of that quite often peter who had just told him oh don't let this happen to you i will be with you in england you're going to deny me three times peter and after peter denies him three times peter is hiding and shame but he says go tell my disciples and peter too sometimes you have to put your name right there where peter's name is and aaron ii and rachel put your name in there you're included and then they see him ascend into heaven and he says as you have seen me ascend you'll see me come back but go into the city of jerusalem and wait until you're endued from the power from on high what a different peter on that side but you know peter passed away you know all then filled with the holy ghost passed away every one of them oh but there is coming today and lord willing it's very soon it won't be long now any day now count the years as months count the months as weeks count the weeks as days any day now we'll be going home but to imagine this redeemer this kinsman redeemer who did it for me for you to take us back to be with you one who said father forgive them they don't know what we're doing and their sins were discarded but now they are white as snow redemption he was able to take the book every name was included in there mine is in there is yours in there amen i know because there's a representation there's something that calls and says i'm part of that and to think to think i might not have a whole lot on this side but i have a soul that's worth ten thousand worlds and i thought about it as i was sitting this afternoon ten thousand worlds what is the value of ten thousand worlds i'm looking at see if anybody's mind is going full blast right now so i was sat there sitting at the desk this afternoon and i'm thinking oh brother mike yarbrough's not here can't ask him he probably would have some kind of an answer so i said i know i'll call brother lyle johnson i just i like how he thinks about things like this so i gave him a call he says i never thought about that but then he asked me he says brother aaron if if this is the only planet the only place that has this life in it then the whole creation is for this planet so how much is that worth wow i said you just you just made it a whole lot more brotherly and right about that i was telling someone just spoke to me and said call brother dale for the day all night so i gave him a call and he says yeah i think i did a study on that let me look it up so he goes yeah in 2008 brother green asked me that question and i still have the files right here and he began to tell me now to try to explain it i can't but he said this was in 2008. he said the value that we can actually account for that we can see based on monetary what's out there what they know is in the earth all the things that have value in 2008 they came up he came up with a number based on what everything he found for america alone 14 trillion dollars he goes and america is about 65 so there's 35 percent more and that was in 2008 he says but i can't tell you even began to look at the stuff we don't know about all the stuff that they don't even know is there he owns a cattle on a thousand hills every ounce of gold every ounce of silver every precious stone is his so he said he goes in my best guess he goes today just based on that he said i would say maybe 200 trillion dollars in what we know times ten thousand and you're worth that to him each one of you so he said father not my will but thy will be done so he could then redeem you back to himself oh what a savior how can you but love him and i thought brother branham said this how simple he says when you get to the other side he says and back on behind some hills back there he says in the shady trees you'll hear me singing or hearing somebody singing amazing grace how sweet the sound he said oh brother branham made it and i thought of all the things that you would say he would be singing amazing grace you would think he would be up front saying here i am no he realized it is the grace of god it is the mercy of the lord it's his love for us oh it's something and their hearts was crying out is there going to be a restoration is there going to be a time even though job cried out i know my redeemer liveth there was something crying out but a desire for it [Music] then
