the sands those are his carrying you he's never left you amen we have a couple of requests to bring to your attention here [Music] brother robert chacon is asking for prayer he's got a doctor's appointment to to have his eyes examined so just praying and believing that all will be well he hasn't he hasn't missed on one of these yet brother robert he's not going to miss on this one either sorry brother robert i was just too busy today i didn't have time for you no he's a ever present never fails amen sister shirley moore i requested prayer for sister green and brother robert figueroa and um brother shelley mentioned last weekend sister green had tested positive for covid and she had been struggling some but sister karen had been out of town for a couple of days and when she got back she led sister green to the piano and sister giron got on piano and started playing the piano and sister green revived you know the gift that lies within you when you stirred up some it begins to encourage you and that's sister green's heart was singing and playing the piano so brother robert i spoke to him i believe it was a friday evening a good friend of ours who had attended brother robert figaro's church originally from california part of the group that came with us we heard the message and she has moved to tucson and her sister lupe and she had called my parents my dad answered and she told him i fell but she became incoherent my dad couldn't understand what she was saying and couldn't get through to her so she asked me to call brother robert and brother robert was able to find out that her grandson was there with her sister lupe has been a friend of ours for many years and she had fallen down but brother robert told me she's been having some possibility of problems with dementia now so she's not understanding some of the things going on sister lupi and brother john know me since i was a baby just a little child they're good friends with my parents so they've been good friends of ours sister lupe alvarez if we would remember her in prayer and brother sam marriott continue to remember the brother sam marriott and do you have a need i would love to be remembered today he knows but but one another we can we can let's stand brotherhead would you come up and take these needs he's a faithful god there is no shadow of turning there's no variance in him he's the same yesterday today and forever for some of those they could just be words sometimes not anything more than words because we see our failures come on up brotherhead we see our shortcomings of promises that we make and we can't keep but there is no shadow of turning to him there is no variance in him he keeps his word he's the unfailing god so you said you know i've raised my hand i've asked him and there doesn't seem to be an answer doesn't seem to be a resolve but he's got it in mind he's guarded to take care of us so let's just believe that and give him thanks too say thank you lord for being mindful thank you brother [Music] let's pray father we're thankful that we can be in your house this morning to worship you and to praise your name we're thankful lord that we can come to a unchanging god a god that that's answered once will answer again not a maybe not a possibility but we know with an assurance that what we laid before your feet this morning that you will hear us and that you'll answer because lord we want you to receive honor and glory [Music] father we thank you for the travel mercies that you extend it to our brother and stuff and then you know lord and the family coming here but lord there are other needs also father that we want to lay before you sister alvarez sister green lord and lord speaking lord all the others that i may not remember at this time but lord we want to commit them into you into your hands lord because we know your hand is not too short and you've heard the cries of your children this morning lord you've seen the uplifted hands and we know lord that you'll answer our prayers and we commit them in faith believing lord that you will answer and we give you praise and honor and glory for the answer amen and lord we commit the remainder of the service to you in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen sister jessica adams has a song special if she'll make her way up you may be seated it's good to have brother joe and sister jessica with us today and she ministers in song and you see he ministers in word let's just let's just receive the blessing of him amen participate thank you [Music] times have questioned certain circumstances things i could not understand many times in trials weakness blurs my vision and my frustration gets so out of hand well it's in i am reminded i've never been forsaken i've never had to stand the test alone as i look at all the victories the spirit rises up in me it's through the fire my weakness is made strong he'd never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb he'd [Music] our never without fighting but he said help would always come in time so remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says giving just hold on our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again i know within myself that i would surely perish but if i trust the hand of god he'll shield the flames again again he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb he never offered our victories without fighting but he said help would always come in time so remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says giving just hold on our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again [Music] remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says given just hold on our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again [Music] when it gets bleak when it gets dark he's not afraid he's not worried he's not troubled but he can be touched by your feelings and says i'm going to go down and he personally comes down whether it's through your brother through your sister he still comes sometimes i say lord that's not how i wanted it but lord let me say lord however you want lord let me recognize and receive it amen it's good to know him it's good to be known of him amen so yesterday we we went in and helped sarah out some she had gotten covered and it really really made her weak and down and she got a sore throat she couldn't eat she couldn't hardly drink anything and she got discouraged and that's because we're human sometimes it gets hard she just encouraged her and i went and picked her up brought her home and she said i'm just tired and sleepy and she laid down and talked to mama and she said she was encouraged yesterday she was able to eat to drink and feel much better even when it seemed so hard and harsh god still meets when you when you're getting down when you're getting tired you're getting weary and you're looking at what you got in your hands and you say it's just not enough but god's more than enough amen more than enough for me amen as you as we we stand [Music] how many knows he's more than enough how much is more than enough sometimes you're looking like it needs to be billions but if you have one and he has two and that's all you need it's more than enough sometimes we just miss it jehovah got jiren my provider amen if you haven't met him that way and know him to be that way so lord i'd like to know you this way amen [Music] you are more than for me [Music] by your stripes i've been set free [Music] two [Music] you are more than he knows more than [Music] more than [Music] yes he's more than enough [Music] tell him one more time lord i believe you're more than enough yes you are [Music] more than [Music] as our brother joe comes this morning and how many believes that whatever god has laid on his heart something you need he'll minister to you draw boom lord today i just need a drink of water and a drink of water supply lord i need some encouragement then encouragement will come lord i need an answer to a question then that answer will come god can minister to everybody and individually how many times how many can testify that he's ministered to you maybe just one sentence out of the whole service and that's what you needed so drawn and call on him amen we had sung this song i believe it was have your way have your way brother peter i'd like to like to sing that one more time as brother joe comes to minister [Music] and brother joe will surrender himself and say yes lord here i am and you say yes lord i receive him have your way holy spirit fill our hearts as we wait as we speak your word into our hearts and have your way one more time have your way fill our hearts and is that what we want this morning lord i want you to have your way this morning we've already not sure if you are aware but i felt the presence of the lord already here you know a lot of times we say those things but it's saying it knowing that he's here it's not just a cliche it's not just something we say to take up space or time to fill a little void we have plenty to say this morning but i believe he's here this morning through the songs that had been sung through the words that brother aaron has spoken i believe god had us in the right channel for this weekend for what he's going to speak to us this morning but before we turn to him this morning let's just take our our knees to him in prayer father we bow faithfully before your throne of grace we thank you god that you're a high priest a great high priest that you said lord that we can touch you and lord that you can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities lord our difficulties the situations that we endure and face in life god those things begin to pull upon you and pulls you right to our need and we're asking lord as we have sung the songs of zion we know father you and you'll not leave us in the fire alone but you'll be there to pull us out lord you'll be there to fan the flames father you'll be there to shut the mouths of the lion whatever we face whatever we endure lord on this side of eternity we know that you're faithful you declared in your word you'll not leave us nor forsake us and god we come before you this morning and we're asking for the holy spirit just to give us wisdom and words to speak and lord not only give us the words to speak but anoint our ears to hear lord may we just be lured like the the bible would tell us lord give us ears that can hear what the spirit is saying to the church god we are that church we're your people and we're asking that you give us ears that can hear this morning lord you know each of us here independently one from another you know our needs and i'm asking this morning god you'll just begin to move to that heart to that life to that need and speak expressly now lord for we ask it this morning in jesus name amen well it's good to be in the house of the lord it's good to be back with you it's been a couple months and we're glad to be here always an honor and a privilege to be at the tabernacle to to be with god special people good to see sister mary lee i see you've got some family members with you today i heard a lot about you now hopefully get to meet you after the service uh if you don't like the preaching just don't find me just move on and it'll be okay but we're here and we're glad to be back brother tim and the ministry team back home since their greetings i was conversing a little bit this morning brother andrew glover he sends his greetings so we we are known around the world the tabernacle here and you're highly loved and you know most of all god loves you and that's why he keeps sending minister after minister to come and be able to feed you in your time of season but this morning i want to speak to you on god's purpose will not be defeated and i want to give it a subtitle if i could the experience of the juniper tree so god's purpose i want you to understand this this morning as god's elect his purpose for your life will never be defeated but there's an experience that we all must face many times it leads us to a juniper tree so let's just look here in first kings in verse 18 or chapter 18 and verse 36. it says and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and he said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god and israel and that i am thy servant and i have done all these things at thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and the thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed a burnt sacrifice in the wood and the stones and the dust and he licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is god the lord he is god see elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them to the brook kishon and he slew them there let's go here in first kings 19 and verse 1. so we find elijah's having this great great experience a supernatural experience but shortly after that experience we find them and they have told jezebel all that elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then jezebel sent a messenger until elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as a life or one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and he went for his life and he came to beersheba which belongs to judah and he left his servant there but he himself on a day's journey into the wilderness and he came and sat down under the juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and he said it is enough now lord take my life for i am not better than my father's and as he lay and he slept under the juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on coals and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drank and he laid down again and the angel of the lord came a second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee notice he came to a juniper tree but that was not the end of the journey it was only a stopping place and he arose and he did eat and he went in strength of the meat 40 days and 40 nights unto horeb the mount of god god bless you can have your seats this morning again we're going to be speaking to you on god's purpose will not be defeated the experience of the juniper tree it's an experience and we find that many of us like elijah we have our mount carmel experiences we have our juniper tree experiences we have our desert wandering experiences no pun intended all of you have had a desert wandering experience here in tucson but thankfully we find ourselves after we leave the juniper tree we find ourselves in another mountain tucked away in a cave where the voice of god can speak expressly to us and brother battle will make this statement he says in the message what doest thou hear he says now pastors here knows and other ministers watch after the mount carmels you're going to have a juniper tree how many have ever witnessed that they've experienced brother aaron you know as a minister after you have a great service on a sunday and all of a sudden on monday whoo the bible tell us whenever a man has a blessing and a power god pours down it does something for you look out satan's on the track just remember the next day that monday after good day on sunday it's going to be a hard thing because it's going to he he's going to do everything that he can to knock that confidence out of you that the holy spirit instilled in you the day before so you have a great service on a sunday and all of a sudden here comes the devil on monday morning he don't even give you time to get out of bed you're laying there thought starts running through your head and doubts start flowing and fear and anxiety starts setting in and we find that that's what the devil does but and he's trying to do this to knock the confidence out of you that god just instilled into you let me just say this for you this morning when you don't have confidence in yourself god still has confidence in you not only does god have confidence in you but god has confidence in what he's placed inside of you before you were born before the foundation of the world god planted a seed term of life on the inside and god has confidence in that deposit he's got confidence in that seed he knows it's going to produce exactly what it said it would produce it's going to make you a believer it's going to make you an overcomer it's going to make you a devil defeater god knows that it when you don't have confidence in yourself because all you see is the adversary i want you to know this morning a tucson tabernacle god's got confidence in you this morning he's got confidence because he knows what he's placed on the inside of you see job noticed god told the devil have you considered my servant job see god had confidence in job no matter what he did no matter if he took his children no matter if he took his wealth no matter if he took his career away from him no matter if he made him a pauper on the street no matter if he turned his wife against him god had confidence that job would not deny and that same god has confidence in you this morning he has the same confidence but notice job had a relationship job had a fellowship and the brother the prophet of god would tell us in the fellowship by redemption he said job had only one way and that's through the fellowship through the shedding of the blood that he talked to god see he knowed that he was and god had confidence in job because he had fellowship with job and he said now may the branham tabernacle see that today the only way god can have confidence in you is not because you do something or that you have faith to do something but it's when you have fellowship when you have fellowship you find yourself at the weakest moment the darkest hour and you got no fellowship with god you find a many a man put a gun to their head and take their own life because they lack a fellowship with the author but a believer gets to that moment gets to a breaking point and yet when you can't seem to take another step he's there to see you through because why because you have a fellowship a relationship with him and because of this relationship you can have confidence that god will bring you through it see god placed a deposit on the inside of each of us here this morning and that deposit that he made will outlast anything that you face sister rachel that deposit that he made will outlast anything you face oh i hope this is his home this morning that deposit that god placed on the inside of you look it wasn't brother aaron that put that deposit there it wasn't your favorite preacher to put that deposit there let me just say it wasn't even brother branham to put that deposit there but god almighty put a deposit inside of you before the foundation of the world and no matter what you're going through no matter what you're facing in this life that deposit will hold you in your weakest moment see it's stronger than any demon power that's coming against you to destroy you deposit there will conquer any situation that's trying to conquer you see god has confidence in a deposit and he has confidence in you who he's made that deposit in oh i just love this this morning you know when you had that relationship though with god it let you know brother aaron that you've been predestinated to the adoption of sons i love how it says in ephesians 1 verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ notice you god is telling us over and over and over and he uses the apostle paul to tell you exactly who you are you're not just some joe blow off the street you're not just somebody just wandered in this church building this morning but no you're the hand-picked anointed elected of god called predestinated for what for the adoption of sons and that word adoption there it means the placing of a son placing him in a position of authority placing him in a position of power so that that son's name on the checkbook is just as good as a father's name and notice he says here having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will it's a good pleasure that you've been adopted this morning he's placed you this morning to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved no there was a time when you wasn't accepted there was a time you may have been maybe in elementary school you felt like an outcast nobody wanted to be around you but the father has accepted you into the beloved oh i tell you no matter what you're facing have that realization that i've been accepted through all my past all my failures all my shame all my shortcomings yet he's accepted me the way that i am and it's going to change me verse 7 in whom we have redemption through his blood and forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure with his purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that he might gather together all are one and all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth and even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his will god's purpose for your life will never be defeated because you have been predestinated unto his purpose so no matter what you're facing it serves a purpose no matter what you're going through it has a purpose no matter the sickness it has a purpose no matter the trial it has a purpose no matter the weakest moment it has a purpose and you've been predestinated to the purpose of his will and notice now church we are now adopted sons not will be tomorrow do you know what it means to be a son of god i got sisters saying amen and the brothers are they're just not saying anything at all i'm just kidding but to be a son means that your name on the checkbook is just as good of the father's now i got a son he's a big strapping young man 16 years old i had to look up to him a little bit he's about 100 well not 100 he's probably 50 pounds heavier than i am it used to be he was like this and i could run him on my back here and there and play with him and get my bluff in now he's getting his bluff in but he's my son and you know if i'm in my study and i'm studying preparing for a service or whatever it may be you know your kids they don't knock on the door they just come right on in because why because of their position in the family so they can just barge on in interrupt whatever you're doing because why because they're sons and daughters of you and that's the same way it is with god we don't have to beg god to come down god already knows all you got to do is father i need you this morning i need the hand of god to come on my situation and because of your position as a son and daughter of god it brings god down to your need it brings god down to your sickness it brings god down into your trial into your furnace into your lion's den and he shuts the mouths of the lions and he stops the flames of the furnace why because your relationship your sonship with almighty god and we are right now sons of god recognize your position in the body i'm a son no matter how i'm how i feel no matter what i'm facing no matter what i'm going through no matter the sickness no matter the difficulty no matter my situation right now i'm an adopted son and daughter of god i've been placed in the family and notice right now we had the nature of god we possess the character of god our conduct matches out of the father we've been accepted in a beloved we have redemption through his blood we have forgiveness of sins he's made known to us the mystery of his will we have obtained an inheritance and we've been predestinated according to his purpose and there ain't one devil in hell there's not one devil one cancer one doubt one struggle one fear when anxiety can defeat the purpose of god notice brother brown will tell us it's your character your conduct that gives god confidence in you the way you act the way you respond to his word gives him confidence in you he says that's the reason that we haven't got great church or a great church marching on today is because god can't find people to put his confidence in the holy spirit keeps saying well they're tearing up here they're breaking up they're doing this they're up on the line he said stay with god's word that's god's truth that's the pattern that's the blueprint he said that's the reason the church today has got all kind of isms and everything in it and because they don't stay with god's word they won't listen to the holy spirit but i want you to know there's a bride in the land today there's a people in the land today that he does have confidence in that her conduct matches his her character pleases him she has the mind of god she has thus said the lord she knows what he wants done with the word or she keeps still and the prophet god will tell us she is flesh of his flesh she is born of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him and when you can recognize that you are him train a devil in hell can stop you then did you hear what i said when you recognize who you are she is him you can look at covet in the face and say you can't touch me you can look at cancer it may have brought you to your knees but you can look at cancers and you may destroy this life but you can't destroy the soul on the inside because one breath away from here i'm in a new body i'm in a well body i'm walking on streets made with gold let me tell you it don't matter what you try to do to me say you don't have enough this morning because i serve a great big god but see you got to be persistent you got to hold on and god's got confidence when he the healings may have lagged on a little bit he's got confidence you're going to hold on for the healing and after you make your confession stay with it don't back off you say god's healed you you stay with it until the manifestation comes you say god's given you the holy ghost and yet you're still doing things you stay with it until the manifestation comes take god at his word believe god when god remains solid be certain that he's god this morning when it seems like your prayers are hitting the top of the ceiling and it ain't penetrating into the heavens you keep holding on this morning because you got to be certain that god is who he says he is in the face of adversity you stand there believing in the face of sickness you stand there trusting you stand for righteousness you stand for holiness you stand for this message and the truth of this gospel you stand for god god will stand for you notice elijah had to stand he thought he was the only one what he didn't know there were seven thousand more but he stood in the face of a jezebel he stood in the face of a corrupt society jezebel then corrupted all society and got them going after her gods and many things of that nature and got all her priests around but yet the prophet of god will tell us because it was becoming to him in the midst of a trial in the midst of criticism in the midst of most indifference it was becoming to elijah a prophet to take a stand and stand there and i want you to know this morning it's the same situation with us in the midst of a a corrupt society when the world seems to be crashing down and politics are corrupt it's in time for the bride of christ to make her stand on the word of god make your stand don't be some wishy-washy this and wishy-washy that and changing your mind every so often matter no matter what the political winds blow here or blow there or let me just say the messages ideas blow here and blow there and doctrines blow here and blow there you stand on the resolute of this word you tie your experience into this message i'm telling you this message will carry you through this gospel will keep you in your weakest moment you know the in first peter we find that the bible would tell us beloved think it not strange concerning a fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you many times we face a difficulty we think well what did i do to deserve this how many have ever been there i got a few smiles on your face it's okay to respond this morning you're not gonna scare me i don't mind an amen i don't mind a smile i'm not out of the head if that's all you can do it's okay just let me know you're with me this morning what we find in first peter 4 and 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you see but rejoice in so much as you are partakers of christ's sufferings that when the glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy see there is nothing that happens to a believer or that a believer will endure but what god doesn't have an ultimate purpose behind it so that's why peter is saying don't think it's strange that you're going through this or you're facing this god has an ultimate purpose god has a plan in place and so god brought you to this moment so that he can display things that you didn't even know you had inside of you he's pulling character out of you you didn't know you had he's pulling fruits out of your life that you wondered is it there he's reaping rewards out of that deposit that he placed but only it's when his you face those fiery trials of affliction and james he would tell us my brethren counted all joy oh here we go again we can't even be down in the dump for one minute we gotta count it all joy sometimes how many of you felt that way sometimes preacher get up there and he tells you count it all joy count it all joy you're like will you just shut up i'm in the trial you're not i'm in the valley you're not you're not where i am you don't know how i feel but james tells us count it all joy why because it's working to the purpose and plan of god god brought you to account it all joy that god has confidence that not only did he bring you to it he's going to take you through it you can have confidence in the word of god this morning i know sometimes we don't like this type of preaching i want to be down in the dump i want to pet my little depression for a minute we've all been there we're human it's part of this life it's called a cycle but cycles are meant to be broken you know there's a cycle in my family and it just keeps going around and round and round but somebody had to make their mind up i'm to break that cycle i'm going to break that family curse because i'm going to become a part of a new family and that righteous blood that royal blood is going to begin to flow out through my life and begin to manifest himself and no matter what the trials that i face those trials have a purpose and god has allowed those trials that you endure the things that you're facing to mold you and to shape you you know god allows a satan to trouble you first to prove that you're not going to fall like the first pride fell and the second thing is to bring you into the image of himself think about michelangelo he had this picture in his mind a masterpiece but yet it wasn't a masterpiece yet but he sat there and he began to take this big piece of stone and chip away at it rub on it here and chip away here that's like it is in our life god comes and he rubs on you a little bit here or he brings another member in the church rub on you a little bit here oh getting quiet that's okay yeah got an amen out of some of you you know chip away a little bit here man chunks fall off and chunks fall off and you're doing good first but when you've been on that pew for a long time and michelangelo keeps coming back i can just see it that picture man i got to do a little bit more here and it begins to take maybe not so abrasive of a sandpaper and begin to polish see god has that same picture in mind we're looking more to that maybe a little bit this evening as we speak on what we're going to speak on this evening but we find that god allows these things to bring us into the picture that he has of himself see that's what god wants to do in this hour is to reproduce himself in a multi-memory body and how does he do that trials and tribulations buckle up because it's not a joyride sometimes you're going to question why me what did i do to deserve this come on we human this morning maybe some of you got your wings back there but you know i don't have wings yet i'm working on mine in the message the blushing prophet brother brown tells he said israel had its ups and downs it was the very type of the church of day how many have ever had your ups and downs all right i want every hand that goes up man it's a class participation brother arne's got both hands up in the back that's right we have ups and downs he says sometimes on the housetops next times are in the valley see that's what it takes to make us appreciate good things he says that's why they call it the law of contrast the black men of africa never know that he was black his skin until he seen david livingston see then he realized his skin was black because livingston was white it's a contrast you never know how to appreciate day if you didn't have a night you never know how to appreciate the sunshine if you didn't have a cloudy day you never know how to appreciate righteousness unless you had some unrighteousness you never know how to appreciate good health unless you've had foul health or bad health seed and that's the reason i think we all appreciate heaven so much it's because we lived here on earth see you know we don't enjoy and this is brother madam in his life story he says we don't enjoy the ups unless we have the downs see is that right did you realize we wouldn't have any mountains if we didn't have any valleys now we're here in tucson i would say we would consider this a valley you look all around there's mountains and for every mountaintop there's two valleys double the pleasure right for every mountaintop there's two valleys and the storms of life brother brown will tell us is what makes us have joy oh bless god here we go i can't wait till monday here comes the storms here comes my joy no but we find how many want victory in your life you really want victory you really want victory say it again amen all right well here you go before you can have a victory there has to be a battle oh brother joe that's a trick question he says before you can have victory there has to be a battle if there's no battles then there's no victories so we ought to be thankful watch how he phrases us we ought to be thankful for the battles and the tryings and it's god giving us the opportunity to have victories oh you just raised your hand i want a victory lord but get ready because he's going to send you through a battle he says don't that make you a little bit better now that battle come along somebody's saying something bad about you you got sickness come upon you maybe god give you those light afflictions that he might heal you and show you his favor to you let you see what it means what he means by that he loves you so god allows you to have battles those little light afflictions so that he can express himself to you in a greater way you're sitting back going why me what did i do look i've been done i've done this i've held true i've served god all my life i've not deviated from this message i'm not done and we got all these excuses but god is saying i got a victory for you i got a victory that's waiting on you but in order to reach that victory you got to go through the battle before our boys could win the battle of world war ii they had a storm the beaches of normandy and many lost their life but many prevailed what am i telling you many may lose their life but many are going to prevail we're going to storm the beaches and we're going to get the victory we're going to get the victory they were dead set determined brother aaron the allied forces were determined we can't lose this war we can't allow germany to conquer all of europe and anywhere else they want to go they had to stand against the tyrant and so do this bride body has to stand against this present-day tyrant we gotta storm the beaches god's brought you to the battle he's gonna bring you through it and the message we would see jesus notice how brother branham would say this he says why when we're brought in the presence of the lord jesus that is coming he said there'll be a million angels stand around the earth with bowed heads listening at the church sing songs of redemption not knowing what they're talking about when we're on the other side and the battle's been won and we get through there and we entered into the portals of heaven there's going to be millions of angels with their heads bound as you and i begin to sing songs of redemption and they don't have a clue what we're singing about because they never were lost but you and i had been lost and because we've been lost and god came down and redeemed us through the shed blood of his son we can sing about redemption we can sing about healing we can sing about deliverance we can sing about a miracle worker we can sing about a waymaker we can sing about an old time god who's never left you alone they don't know what we're singing about because they've never been lost they've never been sick they don't know how to rejoice over healing they don't know how to rejoice over deliverance oh but we do because it's a law of contrast see but everybody wants a hilltop experience can i get amen we love the mountaintops what's this mountain we've got over here mount lemmon how many lights going on top of mount leonard some of y'all some of y'all like me like i don't care no but we enjoy brother batman says everybody wants a hilltop experience let me go ahead and say you'd be lying right now in church if you said you didn't they never want to take to the valley because you know what's in the valley cactus sequoia is that the name of this cactus that grows here and every 50 years it puts out a new branch so or whatever sequoia saguaro i'm not from arizona obviously you know that by now this cactus grows an arm here and grows an arm here and sticks up here and it prickly prickly prickly don't go sit underneath that i think that's your juniper tree you'll be in for a rude awakening but we find everybody wants that hilltop experience you never never want to go to the valleys with everybody the pentecostal church every night every night you're not if you're not shouting dancing jumping up and down speaking in tongues and running all over the floor or something of another you didn't have any kind of meeting now let me just pause for a minute and say this don't use this quote to say you can't have an experience in church i'm not saying that at all i'm not saying we can't shout in church i'm not saying we shouldn't dance in church i'm saying the pentecostal people all they wanted was to shout all they wanted was to jump all they wanted was to dance they didn't want that word that was produced down in the valley that life coming out of them all they focused on was the emotionalism that his presence brought but i want more than the emotionalism i want the giver of the emotion i want the giver of life and how do you get that down in the valley where you learn to trust god for your need you learn to believe he says oh he goes well you know it's all right to be on a mountaintop that's good so there you go there's your met your prophet telling me it's okay to be on the mountaintop you get some people today that i got so intellectual brother aaron they don't want no kind of motion in the church they don't want no kind of jump in the church no kind of shout in the church the church sits dead dead is midnight and he says now but let me tell you your fruits will freeze up there when the cold spell comes you lose all your fruit he says that's what's happened now we put too much on mountain top experiences of dancing and shaking and jumping around instead of an all-night prayer meeting down in the valley a decision well you've come down there and you meet god and you really pour out your life until something takes place you know what we've all had been in the valley but it's okay to have that mountaintop experience but don't expect to live up there that's what the prophet of god was saying because of pentecostals and when you find the charismatics now and you find others all they want is that great emotional high that euphoria of of church or being in the presence of god but it's down in the valley because when you've been through the valley it makes you appreciate that mountaintop so much more my family and i took a trip to colorado a couple years ago and we visited pikes peak pike's peak is a little bit taller than mount lemon pike's peak is 14 115 feet in the air and as we started we was in the valley and we started switch back in and my boy you start going up the mountain and you switch back this side and it's beautiful oh man nice scenery green not all dead and dry you're getting out of the valley where it's all dead and dry you know that desert place wilderness that you've been wandering in and you start switch backing back and forth in my you look through this ravine here and it's beautiful maybe you see some natural wildlife and you come back to this side and that's but the higher you go the less vegetation you find the higher you go the more rock that you find the higher you go oh yeah you're seeing miles and it's beautiful it's majestic god knew what he was doing god knew what he was doing when he put these things in his word about the valley and the mountaintops and about struggles because he knew there was going to be people who needed to switch back their way to the top of a mountain get a different perspective for a little while and got up on top of that mouth and we were up there and you know we were fine we're in a van we're driving up i'm not driving thankfully because the cliffs were right there you got people that know how to drive on these mountains and we'll get up to the top of it and you know beautiful scenery i mean you could just see for miles and miles and miles that you could see but for most of the tourists up there myself included especially my wife there's something that happened it's called altitude sickness you begin to get swimmy headed you can't hardly focus well why bro joe i thought the mountain time would be great grand and glorious it is but you're not meant to live up there you get altitude sickness she can't focus just right jessica had to sit down and she couldn't move from i couldn't really walk around and really enjoy the top of the mountain because of the effect of the oxygen the lack of oxygen and altitude and everything see but it's beautiful when you're on your way up you know something about a church service every church service has somebody who's on the mountain who's on the mountain this morning i don't expect to see every hand who's on their way down the mountain who's on our way up the mountain who's in the valley every service there's those type of believers there's those that are still in the valley there's those that are climbing the mountain there are those that at the top of the mountain then there's those that are descending from the mountain so what that tells me when we come to the house of god maybe i'm on my valley or in my valley i know there's somebody at the top of that mountain that's going to encourage me keep on climbing keep on climbing keep on climbing the view is amazing it's wonderful up here then you get through that mountain top and you start on your way down hold the brakes enjoy it while you can don't come off so quick see that's our spiritual mountaintops are much the same we're not meant to live up there we're not meant to exp we're just meant to experience for a short duration so that we can appreciate what we've been through the valley brown said now the real spirit-filled leaders real spirit-filled christians of the pentecostal move they recognize that something has happened they cooled off because everybody's trying to live on top of the mountain and they've gone off without god i want to enjoy my mountain want to enjoy my mountain but in order to enjoy my mountain i have to go through the valley but he's never left you alone no never left you alone brother brown says we got to have these pros and cons he says that's the way it goes you got to have good days to make you enjoy bad days to make you enjoy the good or bad days to make enjoy the good you have to have a little sickness to make you enjoy good health you have to have your valleys to make you enjoy the mountaintops and so then some of these days it will be all mountaintop it'll be all good health it'll be all god it'll be all joy but it'll be all unending joys but until that time we have to have pros and cons and for most of us here this morning there's a lot more cons in our life than there are pros we continually face hardships seems like we're always in a trial either we just came out of one we're going back into another one the bible would tell us that many are the afflictions of the righteous we get down we get depressed we get nervous we fret we face anxieties we face fears we have sicknesses we lose a loved one we deal with the loneliness that that brings we have disappointments this life is so full of the cons and it's refreshing church to have a mountaintop it's so refreshing when you've been through the ruggery or drudgery of the valley to get out of it take a size thank you lord you brought me through it thank you lord you brought me through it but you know it's a sad thing today that there's people and there's people even around this message they want to rob you from your mountaintop they want to steal the victory that god has just instilled in you they don't want you to they don't want you to have that outburst of emotion well you just need some church order you know we don't act like that in church well i don't know what tapes you're listening to that i'm not i just got to listen to be certain of god on the plane here you're staying at the very end of brother brown said the message is over now let's shout amen real loud amen well that's just uncalled for no he was an example but there's men around this message because why because they lack the gift of the holy ghost in their life they want to criticize you for why because of that outburst of emotion god just brought you through a valley let me tell you you don't know what god has just done for me you don't know when god's done something supernatural for you it'll make you shout it'll make you jump it'll make you dance we had a young sister in our church a couple of years ago she had stage four cancer and she jumped up out of her seat ran around the church two times why because god just spoke to her i'm your healer i take this cancer from you and you let somebody criticize that's uncalled for that's not like church order let me tell you you don't know what god just did for her and they want to steal your joy they want to steal your mountain's top they want to stop that shout they want to quench that hunger they want to shut down your dance because they want to say it's out of church order but said they need to get out of order so they can get saved and i'm not here to criticize that but we find people today they're so scared they're scared of the emotion they're scared of the realization it's okay to have a mountaintop it's okay to shout hallelujah it's okay to say glory to god it's okay to say amen it's okay to shout the house it's okay to dance in the spirit it's okay church because what are you doing you're reflecting himself back you're responding to his word you're responding to his healing you're responding to his deliverance you're responding to the mountaintop you're responding to your v-day when those boys got through there and they said the war was over there was shotgun fires and they were firing this and popping champagne and all this stuff they enjoyed that the war was over the battle is over that's the same way that we are enjoy your mountaintop enjoy that moment because it don't last long and when you find yourself in the valley you know what you need to do when you're in the valley when you're in the valley 2nd kings 3 and 16 says make it full of ditches when you're in the vote oh brother joe we're in the valley what a strange thing brother bam said it looked ridiculous to the carnal mind go out there in a driest place and i want you to start digging ditches well that's the most stupidest thing i've ever heard brother joe we're in tucson go dig yeah dig the valley full of ditches notice what he says here he says now for thus saith the lord verse 17 second kings 3 and 17 for thus saith the lord you shall not see when neither shall you see rain yet the valley shall be filled with water that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beast and this is but a light thing in the sight of god and he will deliver the moabites also into your hand god says you get down there and you start digging you got a prodigal son you got a prodigal daughter out in the world you start digging a ditch for that prodigal you need healing in your body you start digging a dish for healing you need delivery you dig a ditch for deliverance you need the holy ghost in your life you dig a ditch for the holy ghost you just get out there and dig your valley full of ditches and not only that church a god will not only water your valley god is going to defeat your enemy it's but a light thing in a in the presence of god god's got you god's got you oh yeah it looks silly oh but wherever you are whatever you have need of dig a ditch god will fill your ditch with water god will respond to your prayer god will meet your need but you've got to get out there and dig i'm believing no matter how i feel i'm digging this ditch no matter if i'm at my weakest moment i'm digging this ditch i can't see god move on my son he seems like the more i pray the further he gets i'm digging that ditch anyway it doesn't matter they're going to return home because why because god gave the promise and god is obligated to his promise see elijah had some mountaintops we find in first kings 17 he called for it not to rain it didn't rain for three years go on down in second and first kings 17 we find that he went to a little widow's house and make me a cake first your cruise of all and the the mill barrel will not run dry it never ran dry until the rains came we finally went to another widow and he stretched himself over a dead child and the child came back to life and then we finally first kings 18 he defeated 400 province of bell and after the battle he went up to a mountain he says i hear the sound of abundance of rain and he saw the size of a man's hand and what was it he said ahab prepare the cherries and he outran the cherries home he was on a mountaintop and it seems like god was with him everything he said god backed up but shortly shortly shortly he was off his mountain and we finally first kings 19 and they have my he had to report this to jezebel oh jesse honey let me tell you what the prophet elijah had just done your prophets were out there screaming cutting acting ridiculous and they never never bail never whispered a word never showed up elijah restored the altar dug a trench poured water on it not once not twice but three times i mean there was honey there was water everywhere there was a water enough for us to swim in and then he called on yahweh he called on jehovah god and jehovah god came down and he licked up the sacrifice he dried up the water and not only that honey he chased your 400 prophets and slew every one of them you would think she had a conversion no not old jezebel she sent elijah a note elijah boy you done picked on the wrong woman you feel like that sometimes don't you man you know i'm picked on the wrong you just trying to do god of service you're just doing what he took god told a lot to do all that well stored off to do this do this i'm with you elijah god backed off and said ha huh see what happens now oh jezebel got hot under the collar threatened to kill him i'm gonna make you like one of these prophets by this time tomorrow and what happens elijah this man had called for it not the rain brought a dead baby back to life prayed for a middle uh widow's mill barrel and and cruise of war not to drop and it never did and he defeated 400 prophets outran a chariot i can i mean 80 years old out running a chariot that's pretty phenomenal in itself and here he is running for his life at the threat of a woman you would think he would have just caught fire now see you later god got this but he was coming off his mount carmel and i got about 30 more minutes can i can you give me about 30 more minutes i'm not closing yet i'm getting 30 more minutes i'm just kind of prep y'all see brother brown said elijah had a hard day he'd been on mount carmel he's seen the glory of the lord come down he prayed fire out of heavens and then he prayed the rain to come on the earth and under all his strain his nerves were about broken oh how i can feel for him he says and here we find him first preaching to a backslidden nation of people and to jezebel that wanted her way and the people had come to a place that they had forsaken god forsaken his promises his commandments no longer kept his statutes and they carried nothing for him and elijah in the midst of all this he could not compromise he had to stand true on his convictions and that reflects in this day so he stood there at the threat of a woman elijah's nerves had been on a strain he had performed great miracles he's done signs up on the hill to prove that god was still god and god could answer any way by any miracle he says what did he bring the results a threat for his own life you would have thought she would have converted you would have thought it would have brought a universal revival you would have thought it would have brought a nation back to god but instead of bringing a nation back to god it brought a death warrant on his life and elijah soon came off his mountain like many of us he was trying with all his heart in them and everything that he had to show the people that god was still god he was a living god he was a present tense god and the prophet of god would say it backfired on him and he ran out into the wilderness when he heard of it and there he laid under a juniper tree trying to find consolation see he was criticized he was threatened and here he was you and i will look back at the backdrop of this and we've seen supernatural after supernatural after supernatural after supernatural and now we find oh my i taught this elijah i thought this elijah was a prophet look at him he's running he's running i mean all my confidence is in what he'd done look you know we looked at the signs we looked at the wonders but we don't look at the strain that he was under we don't look at the anointing that he was under during his time see he was criticized his values were threatened his his beliefs were threatened and your values and beliefs will be threatened you're going to be talked about you're going to be made fun of you're going to be ridiculed they'll make fun of how you dress they're going to make fun of your long hair they're going to make fun of your holiness standard but you can't compromise you got to stay with the word and elijah did not compromise he didn't bend on doctrine he didn't preach a tickle-to-the-ear message he didn't preach to feel the offering plate he wasn't preaching to the greater thai players or con conceding to them and their their desires he stayed with god said no matter who his audience was he didn't preach an intellectual gospel he demonstrated the dynamics of the holy spirit he demonstrated the dynamics of god and this made jezebel furious it made her furious notice brother brown says in god in his word he goes i want her sometimes i get so discouraged it's a wonder my wife can put up with me i go around and after a meeting i feel so moody i cry while i walk around the wow i'm a total figure i don't see why the lord ever had anything to do with me it's coming out from under the anointing see he's coming out from under the anointing and he begins to cry and begin to wander and if you how many ministers here don't raise your hand but you know after you deliver your heart and you preach it and it seems like it just it doesn't go that way or you hear a snod comment and all of a sudden you're just thrown into topsy-turvy and you're all moody and you s inside you're crying and weeping because why you delivered your heart and you're coming out of that anointing he says when you're up there you feel like you can pack the world away but when you're down here he says it's all right see when you're in the mountaintop it's okay you can pack the word away when you're in the valley he said it's okay he says it's becoming between the two when you're coming out of that anointing coming off of that mountaintop and i hope this will encourage you here's a prophet of god your example of this hour just describing displaying to you that he faced these troubled times as well in his own spirit in his own flesh and his own body in his own mind he didn't know how god will use him thought he was a total of failure see we're not alone we all face these mountaintops and these juniper tree experiences notice jonah jonah was swallowed by a well spent three days in a well's belly that's a sheer miracle he made it out alive the fish came to nineveh spit them out said i had enough of you jonah your message makes me sick spewed him out on the bank and he went and preached the gospel saved the whole nation and jonah instead of rejoicing in what god had done he climbs up on a mountain sits under a tree and wants to commit suicide because he's coming out of the anointing william copper the one who who wrote the hymn there's a fountain filled with blood after the inspiration left him the prophet of god would tell us he tried to file a river to commit suicide stephen and foster when the inspiration left him he called a servant took a razor and he did commit suicide see people don't know what those people that live in the spiritual realm go through it's coming out you're okay as long as you're on the mountain you're okay as long as you're in the valley but it's when you're hanging between the two he goes oh what a powerful anointing elijah had and when that anointing left him he was 40 days wandering out there in the wilderness and god found him pulled back in a cave that's right no need to try to explain it you can't so let me just give y'all some some good gospel teaching for just a minute one word or one phrase it's never never a good thing though it be in jest though it being joke when a brother just delivers his heart or that special singer delivers that song or that musician plays with all their heart to go up there and make a backhanded comment well you wouldn't preach so long or you wouldn't shout so much you wouldn't miss if you i heard your voice crack and well duh they heard it too i heard you mess up on the panel you didn't have to be all this that and the there on a piano we got a young man in our church plays piano wonderful phenomenal he gets criticized because he's free that's his form of worship and people criticize because he's free never a good opportunity never a good time when that brother that sister delivers their heart to go make a backhanded comment there's time for instructive criticism later not immediately after service give them some time to come out of that anointing give them some time to get back into the valley so they can decipher they can have their bearings they can get their grass on life once again i've been there i've had a brother tell me he says my all you do is shout oh well you should be used to it you know when i first started preaching many years ago and that's the only thing i knew how to do shout shout shout shout shout but it's real to me but yet instead of being constructive about it later it wants to hit you right when you deliver it i mean yeah when you're just starting preaching you're not an expert you're a novice you're gonna fumble around you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna sound stupid to yourself and to others let me just say this if you don't like the message don't lie about it just don't be negative if you didn't like the song you ain't got to lie about it just don't be negative if you didn't like the play and you don't have to lie about it just don't be negative you ain't got to go in there well i sure enjoyed you're playing no you didn't your eyes just said you hated it i sure enjoyed that preaching today brother joe no you didn't he sat there and slept the entire service so that's when a brother or sister is coming out of that anointing be cognizant be cognizant that they're coming out of it it's a difficult spot it's a difficult spot but see instead of jezebel said of jezebel turning her heart toward god she puts a death threat on elijah's life and we find here we start trying to wind this down in first kings 19 and verse 3 and when he saw that he arose and he went for his life and he came to bresheba which belonged to judah and he left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and he came and he sat under a juniper tree and he requested now here's a great prophet of god mighty signs nobody can deny that my i mean he just had supernatural supernatural he requested for himself that he might die but i thought he was a prophet he is a prophet but he's also human he's also human just as human as you and i just a different office and we find now he leaves his servant first thing somebody does when depression comes is they leave the pack and they get all by their self so you know when somebody's dealing with depression now the first one's up when the service says dismiss they're in their car and they're gone when they're battling depression if they don't want to have a little sob story where everybody crowd around and they just rehash and rehash and rehash they're all by themselves and now elijah finds himself he leaves his servant at beersheba and he goes and he wanders through the desert now he's wondering with his own thoughts he's wandering with depression he's wondering what the anxieties he's free for all of his life he's got all this stuff and where does he find himself under a broom plant he finds himself wandering through tucson a desert dry prickly i know y'all think it's pretty ugly i mean there's no greenery nowhere and of all places there's only one tree and it happens to be a broom plant a juniper tree and he's weary brother aaron he's tired from the journey his nerves are shook up and he leans against that broom plant that juniper tree and he takes a nap oh the sun's beating down you know how it is in the arizona tucson sun it's hot and we find brother branham says elijah his nerves our own edge anyhow he always always felt sorry for him his nerves was about ready to break anyhow and that great pound from jezebel just finished a stroke then he run and he went into the wilderness and he laid under the juniper tree he says oh that experience of the juniper tree you know many times we think about the juniper tree experience and we have a negative connotation with it it seems to have a negative vibe but it's not the juniper tree has just as much purpose in the plan of god as your mountaintop your juniper tree has just it's my if not more purpose than your mountaintop he says now there's many of us and i'm just going to raise my hands there's many of us that find ourselves under the juniper tree i get myself under there many times to a place that you just don't know what to do you're frustrated frankly i'm right under it now and wondering oh god what would you have me to do see the juniper tree is a part of the christian experience brother brown says oh the experience of the juniper tree the experience you have to experience what took place at the juniper tree we're going to get into that see when you're at the juniper tree you find yourself how many are at the juniper tree today i've got a couple real christians here this morning the rest of you are faking it you find yourself under juniper street don't question why you're there don't say why am i here god what did i do to deserve this why me lord don't question it don't fight against it don't struggle with it when you find yourself at your juniper tree rest rest rest well brother joe that sounds so simple elijah took a nap he had a death warrant on his head and yet he got to this place in a vast wilderness all alone with his thoughts weary depressed anxious and he went to sleep he rested he rested in what brother aaron he rested in knowing that god had called him to do what he did and if he had to rest in that god called him to do that then he has to have rest in his weakest moment god was going to be there for him and the bible would tell us in matthew 11 verse 28 says come unto me all ye that are labor and heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you learn of me i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light see when you find yourself under your juniper tree rest in god's peace rest in god's promise rest in god's provision for you resting knowing that god has a solution to all your problems resting knowing that god said he will never leave you nor will he forsake you rest in knowing that he's a high priest that he says you can be touched or i can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities resting knowing that the trial that you're in hasn't caught him by surprise rest and knowing that what you're going through is working to your good see god has a purpose god has a purpose for your juniper tree brother bam says and i think that's about the way the church needs tonight is a repair a place under the juniper tree so we can be alone be alone just you and god just you and god you left everybody back at beersheba everybody back at the mountaintop now it's just you and god it may look miserable it may look barren it may look destitute but god planted a tree for you in your desert god planted a juniper tree you know think about this i was thinking about this on the way to church this morning how many years before elijah ever walked down in that valley through that vast desert that god dropped a seed and all of a sudden it's dry they don't get much moisture a little rain come by once a year and maybe it grew a little bit and grew a little bit maybe 150 years and it finally got to where it could provide shade because god knew he was going to have a prophet that needed a place of refuge and god predestinated according to his purpose dropped a seed in tucson he says i got you a juniper tree i got you somewhere provided i got you some shade i got you some relief from all the storms of life from all the threats from all your worries from all your fears years went by and the tree grew a little bit and grew a little bit and grew a little bit but god knowing the future he knew that elijah was coming and that elijah was gonna face his moment and elijah was gonna need special care and some special attention so god dropped the seed god dropped the seed god knew that tucson tabernacle would be without a pastor but god dropped the seed so when's that seed coming when's that pastor coming he's dropped that seed be faithful be faithful in your desert be faithful let him bring the winds let him bring the reins it's his obligation to water that seed to provide in the time of a desert place notice now as we'll keep going because i think about the way the church needs tonight is a place under the juniper tree so we can be alone he said there he lays speaking about elijah he laid under the juniper tree he didn't know what to do his nerves were all broke up he was shaking he was crying no doubt he was in a terrible condition and many of us hit those places especially after a mount carmel experience he goes it was asked to me the other day by someone about it says what can be done for us at that time he said there's only one thing to do and that's commit yourself to god he said god has to do something for every man that comes under the juniper tree or he'll go to pieces god has to do it he goes i've had those feelings after i come out of a meeting i looked like i tried i preached and i begged and persuaded i've seen the angel god sweep through a meeting and do signs and wonders and i sat in the car on the outside and i hear them say well it was nothing but psychology there's nothing to it nothing to it at all all nonsense he says then i crawled under the juniper tree and i said lord why did you what did you let me do that for what can be done but we all hit those places he says god knows your trials he knows all about it you that raised your hand at the beginning of the service saying oh brother joe remember me i'm i'm going through this and i got this and maybe you didn't raise your hand but your hearts felt pulled and you know you know we sing the songs never left you alone and see god knows all about it he says but there is more work to be done the juniper tree wasn't elijah's final resting place it was only a pit stop for the journey ahead yes it was only a place notice he says poor skinny fella laying there gray hair hanging all around and he goes i can imagine there was ten thousands of angels watching him sleep could you just imagine hearing that you're underneath your juniper tree and you're just at home sleeping praying god get me out of it ten thousand angels just watching look at him he snores so good oh my i mean there's a rhythm to his snore just smooth he's relaxed program said here he is ten thousand angels watching him sleep he goes i can see on every branch swarms of angels just watching and he'd call the angel that has the softest hands to come and stroke his brow he's called the best cook of all his angels i want you to go get the best vitamins you could find supernatural eternal vitamins and you pack it into that cake and you cook him a cake notice at the juniper tree you thought it was wasteland you thought it was a forbidden place and yet this was a place where elijah was going to get special care the angel with the softest hands oh elijah you did exactly what god wanted you to do we watched you call fire down from heaven we watched you call for it not to rain we saw you heal that little boy we saw you when you spoke over that meal and that crucible my elijah you did exactly what god wanted you to do rest yes it's okay elijah take a nap and the one that's got the greatest vitamins cooked them up they touched them and all right elijah it's time to wake up it's time to eat see god allows us to get to that place you think you're all alone there's angels all around you but they're special angels has been dispatched to your need softest hands know how to touch you and heal you comfort you know how to provide the right meal you know god has sent us an angel in this hour elijah was eating bread that was baked on coals of fire but we're feeding on the body word of the son of man god has sent us an angel soft as hands the best cook there's never been a message like this message that we got so when you find your place in your desert under your juniper tree know this you can put on a tape or you can come to the house of god and god has an angel there with just the right words to speak to your need softest of hands to caress you and stroke your brow it's okay to relax come unto me all that are weary and heavy lady and i'm going to give you rest notice elijah's office mountain in his desert finds himself on her juniper tree all he could think about was his failures all right excuse me brother brown said i'm so glad that there's a juniper tree when we get all war and tore up we can go under the juniper tree and find spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of trip now before i close i want to share this a little insight to brother branham's life just so you know that you're not alone he says sometimes you feel like i did one time i put a pistol against my head to commit suicide your prophet my prophet well i thought he was a prophet i thought he he had these great supernatural signs he raised the dead he healed the sick he did but he's still a human he still faced the struggles of humanity just like you and i he goes i put a pistol to my head to commit suicide but i couldn't do it i took my glove off to lay it on a high voltage line where i was working but i couldn't do it something still held the same god that was with elijah the same god that's today he seen me under my juniper tree my wife my baby laying yonder in the grave my daddy my brother and all and i was just about to i was about going myself and i've laid under the juniper tree it's hard he goes i got to the place where i was beside myself i tried to make a gun shoot my brains out and it wouldn't do it see there's work yet to be done something has to be done god wasn't finished then we look in the life story and i want to share this he says oh god but in heaven somewhere you got my little girl there i'm almost a fanatic almost a mental collapse i took my rubber glove off 2 300 votes running through the right side of the a million exam i hate to be a coward but sherry honey daddy's coming to see you this morning and i laid my hand on that wire how i didn't break every bone in my body how i don't know unless god had ordained that this gift should go on for he goes the next thing you know i was sitting on the ground perspiration running off my face i took the spurs i put them in the truck i went down i went home i went around the house picked up the mail went around the house a few months has passed it turned cool cold weather frost was coming up through the floor there i wouldn't go nowhere notice he was in a valley i we didn't see we didn't have very much but what we had we lived with it together and i was at home it was a sweet home to me and i didn't care how it was it was her furniture and i wanted to stay at home and i went inside the house and the first letter i looked at miss sharon rose branham 80 cents christmas savings oh my it was all over again i knelt down on the floor there i started crying i said god please have mercy upon me i'll take my own life i've been a warden in the room i had a gun i went in there to get the gun i put some shells in and i pulled the hammer back on the gun i said lord god i've gone wild i don't know i was out of my mind i put it up beside my head and i said oh father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name i squeezed a hammer it wouldn't fall i said oh lord i can't even take my life and i threw the gun down and it shot off through the house and i went on like that i thought god why have i gone crazy i've lost my mind a prophet of god another elijah under a juniper tree but that wasn't the end of his life it was only a place that he can receive special attention and when you find yourself church under your juniper tree know this it's not the end of the story it's not over until god says it's over the juniper tree was only a pit stop between what was coming just ahead brother said he was poor tired weary servant saw him he know where he was he knows where you are tonight you may be under a juniper tree everything gone but remember he knows where you are and he says and i believe god placed that juniper tree for a purpose the purpose of god will not be defeated whether you find yourself on the mountain whether you find yourself in the valley whether you find yourself on the juniper tree no matter where you find yourself it works in the purpose and plan of god i believe this is in what here is thou elijah i believe that juniper tree was put in the ground there for that purpose god knew he was going to have an elijah and god knew that elijah was going to need special attention and god knows the same about you oh how we need in this journey that we're in now to find a place of rest and feast on the word of god so that it'll give us strength so when you find yourself as we bring this to a close you find yourself this morning maybe in the future maybe you're all alone you feel down in the dumps just be assured that god has allowed you to come to that point for a purpose see just as god has purposed a mountaintop he has a purpose for the experience of the juniper tree notice elijah didn't get that special care on the mountaintop when he was calling fire down he didn't get that special stroke from the angel's hand he wasn't eating on the special meal that was provided but it was down in the valley under his juniper tree when he was weary worn out tired that god said i've seen what you've done i care about you i love you therefore i'm gonna allow the angel with the softest hands to put you to sleep i got that we got some good cooks in louisiana i mean some mean cooks but we don't have one like this angel spiritual food in due season exactly what you have need of when you have need of it the right word the right scripture the right quote the right message at the right time for your juniper tree i spoke this message last week at home first time i spoke it we had a young girl just on the friday night before sunday had a bottle of pills threatening to take her life she found herself under a juniper tree and god begins to come back on sunday morning speaking about how a prophet of god was wanting to take his life because he found himself on a juniper tree and remember god has to do something for every man that's underneath the juniper tree god has to do it so here we find forsaken but not forgotten god hasn't left you to wander in your wilderness alone he hasn't left you to face your trial your sickness alone but god's provided for you the experience of the juniper tree embrace your juniper tree experience thank you god instead of turning into why me fiery trial thank you lord you have confidence that i'm going to make it through this see god provided and god continues to provide for his elect elijah wanted to die musicians if you could come back like all of us we hit those moments you want to throw your hands up give up it seems like life is impossible nothing seems to be going your way seems like everything just seems to fall apart you know some people everything they touch turns to gold everything i touch everything you tu turns to mold we have those days we have those months weeks and we have those years but no matter where you find yourself maybe you've had that cross your mind i just want to die i'm just so weary life has been unfair it's been miserable brother joe you just don't understand what i've gone through see like all of us we hit we all profit not profit great men of god great women i got all down through the ages all through humanity we all have hit this place therefore god dropped a seed and he provided you a refuge in laodicea he provided you a message that you can come and rest under and then this message has everything you have need of you got the best ministry in this message you've got the greatest word who's ever that has ever come across this world is in this man we got the restoration of the gifts we got the restoration of the word we got all the loose sins tied up the seals have been removed off the back of the book we understand who we are we see clearly who we are what greater message what greater refuge but all elijah could see was what was behind brother aaron man he saw this trouble that trouble all he could think about was jezebel her threat i wonder how close she is i wonder she's found me i wonder she's here you know what elijah couldn't see just a couple of scriptures just a couple of chapters later [Music] you know sometimes we fail to see what's just ahead you want to know what's just ahead okay some of y'all do y'all that are listening let's go in the second kings 2 and verse 11. see elijah can only see about his past all the hardships all the threat all the anxiety all the fear all the depression all the sickness no doubt it took an effect on his body but what elijah couldn't see was just a few chapters later his life was about to change and we found here in second kings 11 and it came to pass as they stood still or they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire in horses of fire and it parted them asunder and elijah went up by a world went into heaven well elijah couldn't see that there was a rapture for himself just a few chapters later all this hardship all the animosity everything that he's gone through that's all he could focus on but god had provided a juniper tree as a stepping stone as a stopping place and he fed him and he stroked his brow and he gave him some eternal attention because god knew there was more to the journey but just ahead there's a rapture for the church there's a changing of the body for the bride just a little more a little more scripture a little few more chapters ahead there's a body change waiting little church all you can see is your past all you can see is a worry all you can feel is afraid in the difficulties of life all you can see is that cancer that's threatening to take your life but i want you to know just a few chapters we're about to take a body change in just a few short chapters it's all going to be over and we're going to be walking on streets made with gold we're going to be pulling up our chair to the wedding supper of the lamb and the bible says he's going to wipe haul the tears away this life you'll remember no more all the things that stressed you all the job situation and the sickness situation and the diabetes and the heart trouble and the high blood pressure and this love went out in the world and this difficulty and this shame and this environment he's gonna wipe it all away and you won't remember it anymore but until that time he's provided you a juniper tree [Music] rest oh it's not over it's not over church until god says it's over satan says you're not going to make it god said you've already made it satan says you can't be healed god says by my stripes you're already healed take me at my word satan says you can have no peace god says my peace i'll give you not like the world giveth i'm going to give you peace no matter what you're facing you can relax you can rest though a host be around me he's going to make a table in the presence of my enemies look this ain't just some little snack show and no he's giving you a full course meal your enemies are threatening you all around you're just pulling up eating on the word feed on thus saith the lord satan looks at you and says look at your mistakes look at your failures god says i started this work i'm going to finish this work see it's not over until god says it's over satan says you're worthless god says i got a purpose i got a purpose for you i got a purpose for you i got a purpose for you i got a purpose for you i got a purpose and you're fitting in to my purpose and there ain't a devil in hell can stop or defeat or break or challenge or change or destroy the purpose that god has for you tucson tabernacle take courage this morning this absence of a pastor this that and other things that you're going through it has a purpose he just dropped a seed does that seed going to grow you got to water that seed being faithful no matter what you're facing be faithful to god be faithful to his word when you feel like giving up when you feel like you ain't got another breath you just rise up in faith take one more step that step will take you to another step and you'll find yourself from there and you'll find yourself pulling away from that juniper tree looking back say thank you god she knew what i had need of when i had need of it now i'm going on the strength of what i just had under my juniper tree experience i got exactly what i had need of now i got strength to carry the journey the next place we find elijah he's tucked away in a cave [Music] tucked away oh my imagine the experience of the cave he heard that still small voice i'm not done with you yet [Music] he's not done with you yet brother aaron won't you come and lead us in some worship it's not over church until god says it's over satan does not have the final say because you know the bible tells us in revelations 10 and verse 8 that there's got to be a people in the land today that's got to prophesy again they've taken the book they've taken the word they ate on it they fed on it they feasted on it and now through their life they begin to prophesy exactly what the word says elijah began to prophesy exactly his experience as a juniper tree god met me he never worried about jezebel again never jezebel was taken care of because god had already seen what he would do with his prophet and god has seen your enemy and i want you to know this morning your enemy is taken care of dig your valley full of ditches and while you're digging he's destroying your enemies while you're digging he's destroying your enemies you need prayer this morning we're here to pray with you the service is not quite like it's been in the past but that's okay i believe this is how the lord orchestrated and led i wanted to share my heart with you this morning because we all face those very low moments we all face those very weak times as a christian you even wonder am i even saved can i really have the holy ghost of what i'm going through i'm struggling i'm struggling it's a part of the purpose of god the juniper tree is just just as much in the plan of god as any mountaintop experience that you'll ever have frankly it's greater that's where you really receive a special touch a special touch anybody can praise god on a mountaintop but when you feel like giving up you feel like giving in you drag yourself to church on a wednesday night [Music] life hasn't been fair job situation is awful sickness through your body you don't know how you can take another step but you steep you keep coming [Music] you find you must have strength to raise your hands and praise god anyway [Music] see that's what god is looking for somebody's gonna praise him in the valley somebody that are worshiping when it doesn't seem to be all cookies and cream [Music] something that'll serve god no matter what they're going through because they know god is faithful god is faithful he's faithful this morning to you tucson tabernacle he's faithful to your need god understands but i want you to go away from this weekend this services today and know that nothing will defeat the plan of god nothing will stop the purpose of god and nothing will stop you we're going to speak this evening on god's purpose will not be defeated and i want to speak to you unbroken because you may be at that bending point you may be at that breaking point but you're not going to be broken god bless you this morning we love you and we appreciate you this morning [Music] when you're upon [Music] and you've got peace of mind like you've never known but then things change and you're down in the valley oh don't lose faith for you're never alone for the god on the mountain he's still gone in the valley when things go wrong he'll make is [Music] let me just stop here for a moment tell you some brother joe you didn't know this but he did we had conversation and worked with somebody yesterday and the day before who had come down to the lowest part of their life and said it's not worth living anymore i can't do this anymore why would god even have me like this [Music] but god is still god sometimes maybe you don't even have the words to encourage somebody but god is still god and he's got word coming to reach out i don't know who might be in that same stage but i know someone yesterday and the day before we were working with god is answered he's still god in the valley he's still god in the mountain and he's gone in between two the up and the down part next verse [Music] brother peter the next verse we talk of faith [Music] when life's at his [Music] what a faithful god is if you believe that stand up and tell if you're still gone on the mountain [Music] he's faithful and failing [Music] he's still god in the bed said right brother bobby amen he's the unfailing god who answers amen i could look over and i know all of us have gone through some hard times all of us have some great battles and we've all questioned why a juniper tree and today god answered why juniper tree is when he tends to you personally when he strokes your brow when he feeds you when he said child you're still mine nothing has changed the enemy is already defeated and you have victory lord we thank you for that how mindful you are of us how how you know down the very very secrets of the heart maybe even words that were uttered or said thinking of the time that brother greene took the gun out of his room and walked out of the house after the family had left was going to go out back in the back part of the property and take his life but you stopped him before he got to that place and you put him all back together because there was still a work to be done and until you're finished with us lord there's still a work to be done sometimes we get tired sometimes we get weary sometimes we don't even know what to say or what to think but hey lord you we just remember that in that juniper tree experience that's when you tend and you meet and you talk with each individual person and say child you're mine i've never left you i'll never leave you as your mind your purpose will never be defeated lord may the one lord today that is discouraged i maybe came today thinking i'm gonna just try it one more time and if it doesn't work today i'm not coming back may they know that you're mindful of them today lord in their toughest battle in the hardest time lord you're still god thank you lord jesus we love you for it for you're more than enough more than enough lord jesus thank you i know what this did for me today [Music] because i needed it god is mindful god is mindful amen so let the storms pass by the storm clouds ride they don't worry me for i'm sheltered safe in the arms of god [Music] safe within the arms of god he walks with me and not [Music] the arms of god that first verse [Music] i have no fear when jesus walks beside shall turn dwell in the arms [Music] me for i'm sheltered safe within the arms of god he was with me [Music] within the arms [Music] elijah didn't know that chariot was on its way your chariots is on its way now i'll fall asleep [Music] the arms [Music] me foreign [Music] he walks with me [Music] shall turn within the arms of god amen lord willing mo gather again this afternoon at 5 and believe that god will be with us here he will you bring him with you he says where two or three are gathered i'll be in your minds come and let us rejoice in the presence of the lord and shall go amen god is so good god is good as you go god is so good god is god is so good he's so good and i love him so yes i love him [Music] him so he's so good to me for his save my soul yes he say my soul he saved my soul [Music] where are you lord the answer's prayer do you still love me lord he still answers prayers [Music] heavenly father i am heavenly father i am [Music] heavenly father [Music] heavenly father
