[19:03] o'clock in the morning we won't spend
[19:05] over probably
[19:07] between two and four hours each time
[19:11] um
[19:12] also our September camp
[19:14] we had a meeting the other night and we
[19:16] were kind of waffled between 50 and 100
[19:18] as far as per person so we haven't quite
[19:22] decided between how much it's going to
[19:26] cost for each person we're trying to get
[19:28] a idea about the total cost of the camp
[19:31] but
[19:32] please if you want to go
[19:36] and you're interested in going please
[19:38] sign up on one of the sheets that we put
[19:41] out there if you can't afford it don't
[19:43] worry about it we want you there it's a
[19:45] lot more important that you're there
[19:47] than if if you can contribute as far as
[19:51] financially so please we'll we'll have
[19:54] that up for two weeks and then we'll
[19:55] decide if we have enough interest and
[19:57] we'll decide if we're going to move
[19:58] ahead with our family Camp up in the
[20:01] White Mountains
[20:03] [Music]
[20:04] um we've also had some requests for to

[20:19] thank you

[20:23] that our congregation is showing our
[20:27] visitors when they come
[20:29] it seems like people are greeting them
[20:31] and reaching out to them and I think if
[20:34] there's as I've said before if there's
[20:36] somebody that you don't recognize or if
[20:38] there's a new person that comes in the
[20:40] church there should be a line waiting to
[20:42] greet these people but thank you I think
[20:45] it's been a blessing to whoever's come
[20:47] through and I wanted to continue on even
[20:49] more that way
[20:51] for that
[20:53] amen

[38:16] they were passing up onto Idaho of
[38:18] northern Idaho
[38:19] but today 51 years ago
[38:23] July 2nd 1972 Tucson Tabernacle in this

[38:29] dedicated
[38:31] 51 years ago today
[38:36] so I don't know brother Ed you were here

[38:41] I don't know if anybody else was here
[38:43] and brother Ronnie brother Dave
[38:46] hey amen from from day one
[38:49] brother Merle I think my wife or you
[38:52] guys were you here no okay I know some
[38:55] of them but 51 years this place has been
[38:58] and God has never failed
[39:01] appreciate that
[39:05] I'd like to share something with you I
[39:08] mentioned to brother Daniel that I would
[39:11] as he spoke this morning
[39:14] about something that didn't go the way
[39:17] somebody thought it should so they
[39:19] criticized it
[39:21] and put a stop to it
[39:23] but God is sovereign
[39:27] he can do something the way he wants to
[39:29] do it
[39:30] we just have to say Lord I Surrender I
[39:33] yield
[39:34] I was just a young boy
[39:37] maybe 16 17 years old
[39:39] we attended another church in town at
[39:42] the time
[39:43] the pastor had left they had just lost
[39:46] their daughter a seven-year-old daughter
[39:48] to leukemia I believe she was seven
[39:49] somewhere around there
[39:52] and the associate pastor was ministering
[39:55] that morning
[39:56] in about halfway through the ministering
[40:00] the presence of the Lord came down into
[40:02] the church and a brother jumped up and
[40:05] ran up to the Altar and said I've got to
[40:07] make things right
[40:09] when he did that
[40:11] others did that I know I was there my
[40:13] wife was there I don't know if anybody
[40:15] else this would have been around 1976 77
[40:19] 78 somewhere Mountain there
[40:22] and people began to cry and come up to
[40:24] the altar
[40:26] and begin to to make things right before
[40:28] God
[40:30] to the point that people stood up and
[40:32] went to each other and made things right
[40:34] with each other right there this went on
[40:38] for 45 minutes to an hour
[40:41] I know I came up because there was
[40:44] things that I needed to make right with
[40:45] God
[40:47] when I stood up and turned to walk back
[40:49] to my seat I looked up and there were
[40:50] some folks still sitting in the
[40:52] congregation with their arms crossed
[40:55] very unimpressed very upset
[41:01] so the pastor was out of town and they
[41:05] called the pastor and they told him what
[41:07] happened
[41:09] the next Sunday they had a visiting
[41:11] Minister and he preached a sermon
[41:13] entitled warming yourself with a painted
[41:17] fire
[41:19] because you see most of us had come from
[41:21] a Pentecostal background
[41:25] and when we came into this message all
[41:27] sudden we wanted nothing to do with that
[41:32] but God had moved in that place
[41:36] but because it reminded some of the
[41:40] Pentecostal the church they refused it
[41:44] and I remember for the next couple of
[41:46] months there was so much confusion and
[41:49] so much hurt
[41:52] even in my own life
[41:56] I spoke with the pastor later and he
[41:58] said the Lord showed me this was going
[42:01] to happen but an evangelist could not
[42:03] handle it
[42:06] and I thought to myself if you knew that
[42:09] was going to happen to your congregation
[42:11] why didn't you stop it
[42:17] there were many who did not serve God
[42:19] anymore after that
[42:21] if and I'm saying this because I know
[42:24] this for me just because it doesn't come
[42:27] my way doesn't mean it wasn't God
[42:30] we have to say Lord have your own way
[42:33] and when it was spoke with brother
[42:36] Daniel we had he had mentioned to a
[42:38] ministering
[42:40] I asked him how do you want to do this
[42:42] and he says when you feel that you have
[42:45] something of the Lord just tell me and
[42:46] we'll do that
[42:48] and and so we we contacted him and said
[42:50] I have something on my heart
[42:53] kind of explained it to him then he said
[42:55] well I'm ministering something similar
[42:57] to that on Sunday morning
[43:00] and you don't say really you say God is
[43:03] in charge
[43:04] you know
[43:05] and and how many times will have a
[43:08] brother Minister and then somebody will
[43:10] come through and it's on their heart too
[43:13] so
[43:14] I began to just just talked to the Lord
[43:16] and
[43:17] he asked me what the title would be
[43:20] and it's kind of a play on words
[43:23] except
[43:25] you accept
[43:28] and I told him it'll be the law and the
[43:31] grace of the word except
[43:35] because you can go into the scripture
[43:36] and it says accept you do this except
[43:39] you do this except you do that
[43:41] and it's the truth
[43:45] but if you go and I'll get to there
[43:47] where he says except I go through this
[43:50] father there will be no salvation for
[43:53] them
[43:55] he put himself in that very place so
[43:59] let's just look at see the grace of God
[44:03] to us
[44:04] that first quote there
[44:06] who do you say this is
[44:10] in 64.
[44:13] I believe the brothers have it there
[44:17] see there's many of the things that has
[44:19] as we're approaching the new year that I
[44:21] wish I could I could forget about
[44:24] but I know that I've confessed them as
[44:26] wrong to him and he put them in the sea
[44:29] of forgetfulness and he won't never
[44:32] remember them no more
[44:36] even if you remember them he doesn't
[44:39] now see we're not made that way we'll
[44:42] always remember
[44:44] we can forgive one another but we can't
[44:47] forget about it because we are made
[44:49] different
[44:51] but God can forgive it and forget it he
[44:56] can just wipe it out as though it never
[44:58] was see because he has access to that
[45:02] sea of forgetfulness but we don't
[45:06] just think of it that God cannot even
[45:10] remember that we ever sinned think of
[45:13] that choir you young folks what if what
[45:17] about that God don't even even remember
[45:19] that we ever sin see he can forget the
[45:22] whole thing and never will be brought
[45:25] into memory anymore
[45:27] wouldn't that be something and if I
[45:29] could end this that I could do that too
[45:32] wouldn't it be wonderful to just be able
[45:35] to put it out and
[45:37] but I know a God who can
[45:40] then our sister just sing I know one who
[45:44] can
[45:45] and he says forgiven cleanse washed not
[45:48] there anymore
[45:51] now brother Daniel had asked us he put
[45:54] it out on WhatsApp to listen to the
[45:56] message of Grace
[45:58] and I trust you did
[46:00] it was a wonderful blessing but from
[46:03] that message
[46:06] the message of Grace
[46:08] God's grace cannot be bargained for
[46:11] neither can it be talented into its
[46:15] Sovereign Grace
[46:17] nothing in my arms I bring simply to the
[46:20] cross I cling
[46:22] naked wounded I just come as I am just
[46:27] as I Am Without One Plea but that thy
[46:31] blood was shed for me and that thou bids
[46:34] me come to thee o Lamb of God I come
[46:39] you don't make yourself ready to come to
[46:41] God you don't clean yourself make
[46:44] yourself holy to be acceptable to God
[46:47] you come and you yield yourself to God
[46:54] oh
[46:55] Philippians chapter 1 verse 6.
[47:01] being confident of this very thing that
[47:04] he which hath begun a good work in you
[47:07] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[47:11] Christ there's a peace there's a rest
[47:14] there is is more than just physical rest
[47:18] it gets down into the soul into the
[47:20] heart of man and you can say is he's got
[47:23] it all under control he said it
[47:25] therefore he's got it under control
[47:28] Isaiah 61 1.
[47:33] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[47:35] because the Lord hath anointed me to
[47:37] preach Good Tidings under the meek he
[47:40] has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted
[47:42] to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and
[47:46] the opening of the prison to them that
[47:49] are bound
[47:50] that was Isaiah speaking but I can take
[47:52] God his word and apply it right here to
[47:55] myself
[47:58] so taking the word except to accept
[48:01] something
[48:02] now we know David in Psalms
[48:07] a man after God's Own Heart that's God's
[48:09] testimony of David
[48:12] a man after God's Own Heart
[48:17] and that's because he could say I'm
[48:18] sorry I was wrong forgive me
[48:22] when the prophet Nathan came up to David
[48:24] and he began to tell him there was a man
[48:27] who had a hundred sheep and there was a
[48:29] man who had one
[48:31] and when the man who had the hundred
[48:32] sheep his friend came over and and he
[48:35] wanted to make a feast for him he took
[48:38] the lamb of the man that had one
[48:42] and he in in the prophet's telling David
[48:45] said then go back to that man and take
[48:47] his life what for what he did and the
[48:50] prophets of David you're that man
[48:54] you had 500 wives yet you took another
[48:57] man's wife not only did you take another
[49:00] man's wife you had him put to death
[49:04] now nowhere in there does it say David
[49:06] began to make excuses it was because of
[49:09] this it would no he said
[49:12] father forgive me I'm guilty of this
[49:16] and you know here it is he's saying
[49:20] he's he's now speaking later in Psalms
[49:22] David says in Psalms 119 108. accept I
[49:28] beseech Thee the Free Will offering of
[49:31] my mouth O Lord and teach me thy
[49:34] judgments
[49:37] here's David crying out accept it
[49:39] receive it I'm doing it back to you
[49:44] and then in Genesis 3 20 we know Jacob
[49:49] has run from his brother after he
[49:51] deceived his own father and his brother
[49:53] and stole the birthright took the
[49:55] birthrights the birthrights that gave
[49:58] you everything
[50:00] we know that his brother despised it
[50:03] but still Jacob was a thief
[50:07] but
[50:09] he's coming back and he knows Esau is
[50:12] going to be looking for him
[50:13] and he says this
[50:15] and say ye moreover
[50:18] Behold thy servant Jacob is behind us
[50:21] for he said no he's telling them to tell
[50:23] he saw this I will appease him with a
[50:26] present that goes before me and
[50:28] afterward I will see his face
[50:32] pre-adventure hopefully I pray that oh
[50:36] God let it be
[50:37] that he will accept it of me
[50:43] have you ever prayed to God that way
[50:45] sometimes as him Lord would you accept
[50:47] this would this we do it
[50:51] we're asking God to accept it
[50:53] why because we want to please him
[50:57] we don't want a disappointment Lord
[50:59] accept these prayers Lord accept the Cry
[51:01] of my heart
[51:03] and he does
[51:05] you know
[51:07] now that's that's that inner nature of a
[51:11] man
[51:11] a a human person crying out for help
[51:16] because we know without him we've got no
[51:19] chance
[51:22] one more in that Genesis 32 26 and
[51:27] and and going into the from accept to
[51:31] accept
[51:32] and Jacob says and same are over no I'm
[51:36] sorry it's Genesis 32 25.
[51:41] 26 I believe I gave that
[51:44] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[51:46] against him he touched the hull of his
[51:48] thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh
[51:50] was out of his joint and he wrestled
[51:52] with him
[51:54] and then he says and he said let me go
[51:57] for the day breakth and he said I will
[52:00] not let thee go accept thou bless me
[52:04] Jacob put that demand before the angel
[52:07] of the Lord
[52:09] have you ever gotten to before the Lord
[52:11] where it means so much to you Lord I'm
[52:15] going to stay here until
[52:18] I hear from you
[52:21] and sometimes it's one day sometimes
[52:23] it's a half an hour but it could be
[52:25] months down the road
[52:28] I've shared this with you a good friend
[52:30] of ours a young man
[52:32] he had high respects for the family a
[52:34] Pentecostal and we were part of that
[52:37] his father was well known he was the way
[52:40] they did it he would write the Sunday
[52:42] school lessons that all the churches use
[52:43] but this this he was older than me but
[52:46] he's a good young man and we we were on
[52:48] our way on a camping trip he was in the
[52:50] military stationed in this little place
[52:52] good friend of my parents
[52:54] and we stopped to visit
[52:57] I spent a little time with him and his
[52:59] wife
[53:00] I was my early teens at the oldest
[53:03] and we were sat down and at the table he
[53:05] they were talking and he was talking
[53:07] with my father and they were talking
[53:08] about the blessings of God
[53:11] and he began to tell my father an
[53:13] experience he had
[53:14] and he said I fasted for 40 days brother
[53:19] Larry I fasted before God and he spoke
[53:22] to me brother Larry you know what he
[53:24] said
[53:25] he said Richard I am not subject to your
[53:28] fastings
[53:33] that's a lesson to learn
[53:35] we don't make God do what we want
[53:38] because we've done this we do this just
[53:41] to Humble ourselves before him
[53:44] not to say Lord I did this therefore you
[53:48] owe me
[53:49] but God I am dedicating myself to you I
[53:53] as a Young Man heard that I was probably
[53:55] no more than 12 years old maybe younger
[53:58] and it caught my attention
[54:02] that God would speak to someone like
[54:04] that
[54:06] and he still does
[54:07] he still does
[54:10] so
[54:12] we'll go into Matthew and we'll take
[54:14] that word except
[54:17] and in the word except
[54:19] if you look into the definitions and
[54:22] some of the descriptions there is no
[54:24] other way except this way
[54:27] not giving you three or four options not
[54:30] give me a saint accept
[54:33] and this is Jesus speaking in Matthew 5
[54:36] 20.
[54:38] for I say unto you that accept your
[54:41] righteousness shall exceed the
[54:44] righteousness of the scribes and
[54:45] Pharisees you shall in no case enter
[54:49] into the kingdom of heaven
[54:55] oh man that just put a damper on
[54:57] everything didn't it
[54:58] because who could perform the law
[55:03] nobody
[55:05] nobody could
[55:06] but he did say that except it it's it's
[55:09] greater than that except it's better
[55:10] than that
[55:13] in Matthew 8 18 3.
[55:21] there the next the next verse there
[55:24] and and said verily I say unto you
[55:28] except you be converted and become as
[55:32] Little Children You shall not enter into
[55:34] the kingdom of heaven
[55:38] is getting tighter is getting harder
[55:40] it's getting stricter
[55:42] except
[55:46] John 3 3.
[55:54] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[55:57] verily I say unto you except a man be
[56:00] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[56:03] God
[56:05] the word except is used quite a bit in
[56:08] the New Testament
[56:10] except except except
[56:13] John chapter 6
[56:15] we'll read verses 44 and 65.
[56:23] no man can come to me except the father
[56:27] which has sent me draw him and I will
[56:30] raise him up at the last day
[56:32] I'm not saying that this is a scripture
[56:34] this isn't right
[56:36] I'm just telling you it's what the
[56:38] scripture says
[56:39] except
[56:41] there are no exceptions
[56:43] 65.
[56:45] and he said therefore I say unto you
[56:47] that no man can come unto me except it
[56:50] were given unto him of my father
[56:55] now let's go to acts 15 1.
[57:02] you know that scripture
[57:06] and certain men which came down from
[57:08] Judea taught the Brethren it said except
[57:11] ye be circumcised after the manner of
[57:14] Moses ye cannot be saved
[57:20] except except
[57:23] if we're not careful it becomes except
[57:25] you don't see it my way
[57:27] except you don't follow it this way
[57:30] except you don't do it this way
[57:33] there's only one that could say except
[57:36] and that's God himself
[57:38] and even in the Book of Revelations
[57:42] two and five
[57:44] remember therefore from whence Thou Art
[57:46] Fallen
[57:47] and repent and do the first works or
[57:49] else I will come unto thee quickly
[57:52] and will remove thy Candlestick out of
[57:55] his place except thou repent
[58:00] now it also tells you there is a way
[58:05] how many just just being honest how many
[58:07] have have done something and then spent
[58:10] a long time being miserable because of
[58:12] what you've done
[58:14] well a few of you to admit it but all of
[58:16] us have
[58:18] you know
[58:19] but after it's been made right what a
[58:22] peace and a joy comes over that
[58:25] what a lifting of a burden
[58:28] I've shared with you what happened at
[58:29] Old Tucson
[58:31] once it was taken care of it never
[58:33] condemned me again
[58:35] did the memory go away no but the
[58:37] condemnation did
[58:39] it's been made right
[58:41] he says you know
[58:44] so this except
[58:47] except you do this if we're not careful
[58:52] and we'll be honest about it
[58:55] maybe God dealt with brother Jonathan
[58:57] about something in his life
[59:00] and brother Jonathan made it right took
[59:03] care of it I know you've never ever had
[59:05] to do that brother Jonathan I'm just
[59:06] using you as an example all right
[59:10] and like that and and after you've taken
[59:13] care of it all
[59:15] there's a piece that comes with him
[59:18] but brother Jonathan you cannot preach
[59:20] that as a Doctrine
[59:22] you cannot stand up and say you have to
[59:25] do it like me
[59:26] I just had to do what God told me to do
[59:32] when we try to form and make everything
[59:35] conform to how we see it
[59:38] okay
[59:40] and and that's where the problem comes
[59:43] when we start to say if it's not done
[59:45] like this it's no good if it's not done
[59:48] like that it's not right
[59:51] there was a brother and he gave a
[59:52] testimony
[59:54] and he stood up before a group of
[59:56] ministers and this was quite a few years
[59:58] ago we were there
[1:00:01] and God told him to leave the church he
[1:00:04] was at which is a good wonderful group
[1:00:06] of Believers and to go join himself
[1:00:09] to an organization
[1:00:13] and we all had the same reaction I'm
[1:00:15] sure as we heard it we said huh no way
[1:00:20] but he said I listened to God and I went
[1:00:23] to that church and I began to attend
[1:00:26] that church
[1:00:28] and I was able to reach
[1:00:31] some there
[1:00:34] in that church
[1:00:36] for salvation
[1:00:39] now you would say
[1:00:41] oh I don't know about that but to those
[1:00:44] who found Christ through that praise God
[1:00:48] that that man listened to what God said
[1:00:50] to him
[1:00:53] I understand what I'm saying
[1:00:56] you know if you were lost
[1:00:59] in sin
[1:01:01] maybe you were in a bar maybe you were
[1:01:03] in a bad place but God sends someone
[1:01:06] down to where you were at
[1:01:09] and reached down his hand her hand
[1:01:12] and Drew you out
[1:01:15] thank God for sending that person to
[1:01:17] that place
[1:01:18] wherever it was
[1:01:22] and and I know this because I've stood
[1:01:25] there in my own personal life and judged
[1:01:28] others
[1:01:29] by my standards
[1:01:33] and I'm not saying all my standards are
[1:01:36] bad but none of my standards are going
[1:01:38] to give me to heaven
[1:01:39] it's going to be the grace of God
[1:01:43] for all have sinned and come short of
[1:01:47] the glory of God
[1:01:50] brother Branham is is is there and he
[1:01:52] goes to that little restaurant
[1:01:54] and he walks in and he sees that woman
[1:01:57] with the two men and all that's going
[1:01:59] and he tells the God how can you stand
[1:02:02] this destroy them just get rid of it all
[1:02:06] and God says come outside step outside
[1:02:09] over here let me show you something
[1:02:12] and he begins to show him that vision of
[1:02:15] those sins coming up
[1:02:17] towards God
[1:02:19] and those are brother branham's sins
[1:02:22] and the blood is keeping him from being
[1:02:25] destroyed
[1:02:27] when brother Branham sees that Watch
[1:02:29] what it does it turns his whole heart
[1:02:32] and he goes back in with a whole
[1:02:35] different attitude
[1:02:38] he comes up to the lady and he begins to
[1:02:40] talk to her and leads her to Jesus
[1:02:44] Christ
[1:02:46] in a place where they're drinking and
[1:02:49] smoking and partying
[1:02:54] where did God meet you
[1:02:58] he met me in my self-righteous place
[1:03:01] that I was at when I thought I was okay
[1:03:03] and everything was all right
[1:03:06] I think sometimes that's the hardest one
[1:03:09] to get to
[1:03:11] I don't need any help Lord I'm doing
[1:03:13] well
[1:03:14] I'm okay
[1:03:15] I go to church Sunday both Services I go
[1:03:19] to church Wednesday I listen to a
[1:03:21] message I
[1:03:22] wonderful praise God for that but that's
[1:03:25] not going to save you
[1:03:27] it's his grace that it's already done
[1:03:29] the work
[1:03:32] it won't be too long tonight
[1:03:38] so if we go to Matthew chapter 26.
[1:03:45] verses 35 through 42.
[1:03:51] watch this Peter
[1:03:55] Peter
[1:04:00] there's something about Peter though
[1:04:01] that Peter was not afraid
[1:04:05] and talk to talk to Jesus and go right
[1:04:07] up to him
[1:04:09] and sometimes that person gets sent by
[1:04:12] everybody else
[1:04:14] you go talk to him you go tell him you
[1:04:17] go
[1:04:18] yeah
[1:04:20] I I
[1:04:22] working in in the work that I've done um
[1:04:27] I
[1:04:28] on several of the different positions I
[1:04:30] I was never a manager of a whole
[1:04:31] department but I managed a portion
[1:04:34] and we had a monthly meeting
[1:04:37] when our our regional boss would come
[1:04:39] down from Phoenix
[1:04:42] and I always attended the meetings we
[1:04:45] were supposed to
[1:04:47] and and I took notes because I was a
[1:04:50] manager and then I would have to you
[1:04:52] know inform those that we were working
[1:04:54] with
[1:04:55] and there was a group about four or five
[1:04:57] that were always poking at me because I
[1:05:00] was the only Hispanic in there
[1:05:03] and in in the Management Group
[1:05:05] and and they were Hispanics
[1:05:07] and they would accuse me of wanting to
[1:05:10] get in and I'm going to just say it this
[1:05:11] way with the white people
[1:05:13] okay
[1:05:14] I was raised in elementary and Junior
[1:05:16] High School where our street was the
[1:05:18] only Hispanics all my best friends and
[1:05:21] I'm gonna I'm gonna say it this way
[1:05:22] we're white I don't have any problems
[1:05:24] with that
[1:05:26] uh honestly they were my best friends it
[1:05:29] was never an issue to me until I come to
[1:05:31] Tucson and I started having people tell
[1:05:33] me you're not white you're Hispanic
[1:05:36] okay I never had a problem with that
[1:05:38] every time I look in the mirror I
[1:05:39] realize that too
[1:05:41] but they're friends I have no problem
[1:05:43] with whoever they are our neighbors were
[1:05:45] were Oriental we got along fine there's
[1:05:48] no problem in that but they would poke
[1:05:50] at me poke at me and poke at me and then
[1:05:53] after the meeting was over and they were
[1:05:55] going to have to answer for it what did
[1:05:56] he say what did he say what did he say
[1:05:59] so one day I said you're going to the
[1:06:00] meeting I'm not telling you anything
[1:06:03] you're going to sit in the meeting and
[1:06:05] learn for yourself
[1:06:07] I can share what God has done for me but
[1:06:10] until you meet him for yourself
[1:06:13] then your testimony becomes real
[1:06:17] you're not sharing somebody else's
[1:06:20] so here's Peter
[1:06:22] Peter said unto him
[1:06:24] though I should die with thee yet I will
[1:06:27] not deny thee
[1:06:30] now if you were here there
[1:06:33] not where you are today and know what
[1:06:35] the scripture says you probably would
[1:06:37] have because you would have been like
[1:06:38] the other likewise also said all the
[1:06:41] disciples amen I'm with Peter
[1:06:44] Peter spoke for all of us amen
[1:06:47] then cometh Jesus
[1:06:50] with them unto a place called Gethsemane
[1:06:52] and said unto his disciples
[1:06:54] sit ye here while I go and pray Yonder
[1:06:58] and he took with him Peter and two and
[1:07:00] the two sons of Zebedee and began to be
[1:07:02] sorrowful and very heavy
[1:07:05] and then he said unto them my soul is
[1:07:08] exceeding sorrowful even unto death
[1:07:11] tarry ye here and watch with me
[1:07:15] be a support
[1:07:17] you are the ones that I've shared my
[1:07:19] life with you you were the ones that
[1:07:20] I've sat down when nobody else the
[1:07:22] things that I begin to open my heart
[1:07:24] before you now would you just help me
[1:07:28] would you be my friends here
[1:07:30] and isn't that nice when somebody said
[1:07:32] I'll pray with you
[1:07:33] I'll stay up all night and remember
[1:07:35] something
[1:07:36] when we were just a young family with me
[1:07:38] and my wife and the kids and and we've
[1:07:41] been me and my wife both we we just
[1:07:43] opened the door to a few things and it
[1:07:45] didn't take too long where we were
[1:07:48] not going out and smoking and drinking
[1:07:49] but things in our lives had changed
[1:07:53] and we both sat down one day and said
[1:07:55] we've got to do something about this
[1:07:57] lest we be find ourselves outside all of
[1:07:59] a sudden
[1:08:00] I called I think was six or seven
[1:08:03] families in the church then
[1:08:06] and I said tonight at seven o'clock me
[1:08:09] and my wife are going to go before the
[1:08:10] Lord in prayer
[1:08:12] because there's things going on in our
[1:08:14] lives we opened the door a little bit
[1:08:16] now there's things in our house in in
[1:08:19] our physical home and in ourselves that
[1:08:21] should have never been there
[1:08:23] okay and I said would you pray with us
[1:08:27] so at seven o'clock we went into prayer
[1:08:30] both me and my wife
[1:08:33] and to whatever time it was
[1:08:37] in the next service every one of those
[1:08:40] families came and said thank you for
[1:08:42] calling us for prayer because we met God
[1:08:44] for ourselves also
[1:08:47] and God dealt with us and God became it
[1:08:50] became work with us we had to say hey we
[1:08:52] need some help
[1:08:54] you know so here Jesus is knowing what
[1:08:58] he's going through knowing what about
[1:09:00] he's he's about to face
[1:09:02] and he's asking for his closest friends
[1:09:04] would you Terry with me would you pray
[1:09:07] with me
[1:09:10] and then in verse
[1:09:13] I'll read verse 39 I believe that is and
[1:09:17] he went a little further and he fell on
[1:09:18] his face and prayed saying O my father
[1:09:21] if it be possible let this cup pass from
[1:09:25] me
[1:09:26] nevertheless not as I will but is thou
[1:09:30] wilt
[1:09:32] I'm looking at this father is there
[1:09:34] another way we can do this
[1:09:37] without the shedding of My Blood The
[1:09:41] Taking of my life
[1:09:44] yeah
[1:09:45] and he cometh unto his disciples and
[1:09:48] findeth them asleep and saith unto Peter
[1:09:51] what
[1:09:52] could you not watch with me one hour
[1:09:56] what if on that next Wednesday
[1:09:59] some of those families would have come
[1:10:01] to me and my wife I'm sorry brother
[1:10:03] Aaron
[1:10:04] but we forgot and we weren't praying
[1:10:08] what if that what if that had happened
[1:10:10] but there was a group of people we
[1:10:13] didn't tell him our story we just said
[1:10:14] we need prayer they got to praying
[1:10:16] seeking God and God heard
[1:10:19] but here Jesus the son of God is saying
[1:10:22] looking at his disciples who has just
[1:10:24] spent time with and here they couldn't
[1:10:26] stay awake
[1:10:27] they were tired
[1:10:30] they were all so human
[1:10:33] okay they weren't angels
[1:10:36] you know they had this they had to set
[1:10:39] themselves aside for this too
[1:10:41] and then he tells them watch and pray
[1:10:43] that ye enter not into temptation the
[1:10:46] spirit indeed is willing but the flesh
[1:10:49] is weak I'm sure they told him
[1:10:51] Lord we're going with you we're going to
[1:10:53] follow you we'll go all the way up there
[1:10:55] with every intention to do so
[1:10:59] he went away again the second time and
[1:11:01] prayed
[1:11:03] saying O my father if this cup may not
[1:11:07] pass away from me
[1:11:09] except I drink it thy will be done
[1:11:17] that's the one except in the Bible
[1:11:21] that speaks of the grace of God
[1:11:25] except I do this there is no salvation
[1:11:32] so he said I will
[1:11:38] and this is there this is what you must
[1:11:41] accept as the accept
[1:11:47] because without there without him ex
[1:11:50] they accept I do it there would be no
[1:11:54] selfish
[1:11:58] I don't know if you've ever looked at it
[1:12:00] this way but as I was looking except I
[1:12:02] drink it
[1:12:04] there is no forgiveness
[1:12:09] he had to come to that place himself
[1:12:14] I am willing to give it up
[1:12:17] for them
[1:12:18] for all those
[1:12:19] everyone that
[1:12:22] John 15.
[1:12:26] one through five
[1:12:29] I am the True Vine
[1:12:31] and my father is a husbandman
[1:12:34] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:12:36] fruit he taketh away
[1:12:38] and every branch that beareth root he
[1:12:41] purgeth it that it may bring forth more
[1:12:44] fruit
[1:12:45] you might be saying Lord that hurt a
[1:12:48] little bit
[1:12:50] Lord you cut me off a little bit here
[1:12:52] Lord you trimmed it here Lord you did
[1:12:56] that when your hearts are saying Thank
[1:12:58] You Lord you're doing what is best for
[1:13:01] me to magnify you
[1:13:07] now I I never I've never really done
[1:13:10] this my dad was when they were young and
[1:13:12] they'd moved from Texas to California
[1:13:16] there where we lived was the the
[1:13:19] Italians owned a lot of the land there
[1:13:21] and the grapes were for wine
[1:13:24] that's where California's oldest Winery
[1:13:26] was in that neighborhood right there
[1:13:29] nothing to be proud of but it was there
[1:13:32] and my dad and them they went to to
[1:13:36] working in there because that's what
[1:13:37] they were in that was pruning the
[1:13:38] grapevines
[1:13:42] um I think Dad said it paid like 35
[1:13:44] cents an hour
[1:13:47] but when gas was five cents a gallon
[1:13:49] that's not that bad
[1:13:53] but it cost pruning clipping cleaning
[1:13:57] now the man the men that were pruning
[1:14:00] the men that made like Dad said the 75
[1:14:02] cents an hour they knew what they were
[1:14:05] doing
[1:14:07] it wasn't just cutting anywhere just
[1:14:09] clipping anywhere there was a way to
[1:14:12] prune the vine so it could produce to
[1:14:15] its maximum
[1:14:18] so when he comes down where you're at
[1:14:20] and he begins to prune he knows what
[1:14:24] he's doing
[1:14:26] and except he does it you won't give
[1:14:29] fruit
[1:14:31] or your fruit will be minimal
[1:14:34] but he wants you to bring forth
[1:14:36] my fruit
[1:14:39] he says that it may bring forth more
[1:14:42] fruit now you are clean through the word
[1:14:44] which I have spoken unto you
[1:14:47] then he says abide in me and I in you
[1:14:51] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:14:53] itself except it abide in the vine no
[1:14:57] more can ye accept ye abide in me
[1:15:02] okay now
[1:15:04] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:15:07] except it abide in the Vine
[1:15:10] so when they go to pruning they prune
[1:15:13] off that portion that will never bear
[1:15:15] fruit again
[1:15:16] in fact it's gathered and bundled and
[1:15:18] put into the fire
[1:15:21] but you don't need that portion that
[1:15:23] he's pruning off of you
[1:15:27] that's where you understand because you
[1:15:30] realize in order to be in part of that
[1:15:31] except you're in that vine he's going to
[1:15:33] prune it to produce Jesus Christ
[1:15:37] and that which is in my life that is not
[1:15:40] Jesus Christ like needs to be pruned off
[1:15:43] because they accept you abide
[1:15:46] he says you cannot bring forth the fruit
[1:15:50] he says I am the vine ye are the
[1:15:53] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:15:56] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:15:59] for without me you can do nothing
[1:16:05] though I give myself to be burned Paul
[1:16:08] said
[1:16:09] in Corinthians though I give all away
[1:16:12] and I have not love or charity it
[1:16:15] profiteth me nothing
[1:16:21] might make you look good
[1:16:23] might have you in good standing amongst
[1:16:26] the people
[1:16:28] but if you're not producing Jesus Christ
[1:16:31] the life of God
[1:16:33] then he said it profiteth me nothing
[1:16:38] so
[1:16:39] I I just want to go back guys today will
[1:16:42] be nice and short
[1:16:45] if
[1:16:48] if he comes in
[1:16:51] and he says
[1:16:52] I want you like this except this
[1:16:57] let him prune It Off
[1:17:00] I want you like this and and he does
[1:17:03] different ways of pruning
[1:17:06] um just like a a mother and a father
[1:17:08] have different ways of raising their
[1:17:10] children
[1:17:13] um
[1:17:14] and the children learn the difference
[1:17:15] between Mom and Dad real quick
[1:17:20] and and as as husband and wife raising
[1:17:23] the children you have to do this
[1:17:24] together you can't
[1:17:27] you can't get it twice a guy run to
[1:17:28] Daddy because Daddy's has a lot more
[1:17:30] grace for me
[1:17:32] I don't know if that works that way
[1:17:33] Daniel because I don't I never had a son
[1:17:36] what Daniel is saying no
[1:17:38] you're it's easier to run to Mama
[1:17:41] okay
[1:17:42] did she just pinch you for that
[1:17:47] children learn that
[1:17:49] you know
[1:17:50] and and Sarah's here today
[1:17:54] I asked her one day we were driving home
[1:17:56] together and I said tell me something
[1:17:58] about Dad and Mom
[1:18:00] that that you
[1:18:02] I don't remember the exact wording that
[1:18:04] meant something to you
[1:18:06] she said that you and Mom were
[1:18:08] consistent
[1:18:10] if you said no then Mom said no
[1:18:14] if Mom said no then you said no
[1:18:18] I couldn't go to Mom after you told me
[1:18:21] no to get something from her
[1:18:24] now
[1:18:27] me and Mom didn't sit down and and talk
[1:18:29] about this it's it's how we raised the
[1:18:32] family
[1:18:33] to say we did everything perfect no
[1:18:36] but there's something about that when
[1:18:39] when we can look to our father
[1:18:42] and say Lord and know that he's going to
[1:18:45] be consistent
[1:18:48] he's not swayed by my feelings
[1:18:54] he knows what's best for me
[1:18:58] um I really can't use this that example
[1:19:01] but
[1:19:02] brother Silas is sitting right behind
[1:19:04] Daniel there
[1:19:07] and that's where my dad would be and I'd
[1:19:09] be sitting where Daniel is
[1:19:10] and if my dad didn't like how my action
[1:19:13] worth I felt it right about here
[1:19:16] either like this or like this
[1:19:19] now dad didn't mean it to be mean he's
[1:19:22] trying to teach us
[1:19:24] trying to teach us to be respectful in
[1:19:26] service be respectful in church
[1:19:29] to grow up to be to to be good people
[1:19:31] you know what I'm saying that's what he
[1:19:33] meant by it
[1:19:34] but
[1:19:36] Daddy's this and Mama's this usually
[1:19:39] we're in two different levels
[1:19:40] daddies you felt it for a week mom you
[1:19:43] felt it for a couple a couple of minutes
[1:19:45] it's just just how it kind of worked
[1:19:48] but
[1:19:50] but their intentions were to raise
[1:19:52] children who would be respectful who
[1:19:55] could be good citizens but most of all
[1:19:58] to love the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:02] when God comes and he does the trimming
[1:20:07] and he does the work he does it for your
[1:20:10] very best
[1:20:12] and he's the husbandman he knows what he
[1:20:16] wants from his Vineyard
[1:20:19] and he can get the mass production
[1:20:23] everything that he has seen
[1:20:26] so when it gets hard
[1:20:28] and it gets tough
[1:20:30] and you begin to think and you begin to
[1:20:32] feel I can't do this no more
[1:20:35] remember that he said except I do this
[1:20:41] to his own father
[1:20:42] you and I would not be here today
[1:20:47] because he took our place
[1:20:50] he stood where I should have paid for my
[1:20:53] own sin
[1:20:54] and he took it upon himself
[1:21:00] there was a law
[1:21:02] acts 15 1.
[1:21:04] don't you realize what Moses said don't
[1:21:06] you realize what Moses did except you do
[1:21:09] this
[1:21:10] and there was a Grace that except I do
[1:21:14] this
[1:21:16] that's the grace of God for us
[1:21:19] musicians can come
[1:21:21] up
[1:21:27] oh God rich in Mercy
[1:21:29] God rich and Grace
[1:21:31] nothing
[1:21:33] nothing
[1:21:35] that you've ever done
[1:21:36] is too big
[1:21:39] for God to take care of
[1:21:44] now I wish he would take some of the
[1:21:45] things out of our memory
[1:21:47] but that's not part of it
[1:21:49] you just have to say Lord I've confessed
[1:21:52] it
[1:21:53] help me
[1:21:54] that's just bow our hands
[1:21:59] except you said I go
[1:22:02] and give myself
[1:22:04] for them
[1:22:09] and you said not my will
[1:22:11] but thy will be done father
[1:22:15] oh the grace and the love of God
[1:22:19] the mercy that we wrote my life
[1:22:25] Lord where would we be today
[1:22:29] help us Lord
[1:22:32] think of that that Pharisee in that
[1:22:34] public and as they were there praying
[1:22:38] and the Pharisee looked up to God and he
[1:22:41] said I'm glad that I'm not like this man
[1:22:44] here I do this this and this I tithe I
[1:22:47] do this I go to church and Lord
[1:22:50] foreign
[1:22:52] there on his knees was crying out
[1:22:54] forgive me have mercy on me Lord for I
[1:22:58] am nothing but a sinner
[1:23:00] and you said I would hear the prayer of
[1:23:03] that one
[1:23:04] over the other one
[1:23:07] oh the mercy of God in our lives Lord
[1:23:11] we thank you for that today we love you
[1:23:13] for it
[1:23:14] amen
[1:23:16] Mercy rewrote my life
