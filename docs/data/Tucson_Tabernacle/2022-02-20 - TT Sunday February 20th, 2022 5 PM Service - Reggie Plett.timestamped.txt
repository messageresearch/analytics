[40:37] [Music]
[40:56] i want to
[40:59] live each day as if the last one
[41:04] i want the truest values in my life
[41:11] for one day it will truly be my last one
[41:17] and i will have to leave this world
[41:20] behind
[41:24] i want to make the most of every moment
[41:30] redeeming to the fullest passing time
[41:36] by putting on his love and bowels of
[41:40] mercy
[41:42] and my grace put on his humbleness of
[41:46] mine
[41:49] each day i come before the god of
[41:52] judgment
[41:55] where i appear for deeds that i have
[42:00] done to give account for idle words i've
[42:05] spoken
[42:06] [Music]
[42:07] and be judged on how i have received his
[42:11] son
[42:14] the days i've wasted are not few but
[42:18] many
[42:20] but i'm praying for a difference in my
[42:23] life
[42:26] till all my friends and loved ones see
[42:29] me changing
[42:32] till they see no longer me but only
[42:36] christ

[42:47] me with eternal life

[43:05] me with the holy spirit

[44:13] brother grady's
[44:14] song for us tonight brother grady thank
[44:17] you really appreciated that song and
[44:19] putting those different songs together
[44:25] when i was young
[44:30] i asked my mother why do they always
[44:33] sing about me and dad in church

[44:40] they were singing about i think all of
[44:42] us i said no there's that one song we
[44:44] always sing it's about me and dad why do
[44:46] we sing that song
[44:48] she said well i don't son i don't know
[44:50] what song you're talking about what what
[44:52] song are you talking about i said
[44:53] amazing grace
[44:54] how sweet the sound that saved a reg
[44:57] like me
[44:58] and i really thought the word was reg as
[45:01] in reginald which is was our name and
[45:04] and uh
[45:06] you know my mom got a kick out of that
[45:07] but that was truth i didn't know what a
[45:08] wretch was you know as a young boy so i
[45:10] thought it was reg
[45:12] and uh and then i married a grace
[45:16] and uh so i
[45:18] sometimes i feel like calling up her her
[45:21] mom and dad once in a while and and
[45:23] saying you know your grace still amazes
[45:30] me and uh i'm sure i amaze her too
[45:34] sometimes with
[45:35] embarrassing her in church
[45:38] um
[45:40] sure have enjoyed our time down here
[45:43] you know today at lunch
[45:45] uh
[45:46] brother and sister
[45:48] senior dougal
[45:50] were sitting at a booth and after they
[45:54] were finished with their meal together
[45:56] they came over and greeted us and
[45:58] uh
[46:00] sister dougal was just sharing some of
[46:02] her testimony and and just
[46:04] how nice it was at their marriage and
[46:07] their children
[46:08] and i i just it just touched my heart
[46:12] you know it just really touched my heart
[46:14] to see a happy family
[46:17] and um so i just want to say to each and
[46:19] every one of you
[46:21] uh thank you for
[46:23] the invitation and allowing us to
[46:25] feel so at home
[46:27] here uh with you all and if the lord and
[46:31] terry and we'd have more time we'd love
[46:32] to
[46:33] spend just so much more time with each
[46:35] of you but i just want to say thank you
[46:38] um
[46:40] i'm hoping that i can keep this evening
[46:42] as short as well
[46:45] um and i was wondering if you have your
[46:47] bibles if you'd like to just stand with
[46:48] me to honor
[46:50] the reading of the word of god like to
[46:52] turn in the book of deuteronomy
[46:54] chapter 32.
[47:14] and we'll read
[47:16] just two verses
[47:18] uh verses nine and and ten
[47:27] for the lord's portion is his people
[47:31] jacob is the lot of his inheritance
[47:34] he found him in a desert land
[47:37] and in the waste howling wilderness
[47:41] he led him about
[47:42] he instructed him
[47:44] he kept him as the apple of his eye
[47:49] i wonder if you just bow your heads for
[47:51] a word of prayer
[47:52] with me precious heavenly father lord
[47:56] we're so grateful to be able to look
[47:58] into these pages and read this word of
[48:01] yours
[48:03] lord we're blessed and
[48:06] god we have probably no excuses in the
[48:09] day and age we live
[48:11] lord for we've been given so much
[48:14] lord abundance of word abundance of
[48:17] the ability to read and lord an
[48:20] abundance of revelation has been
[48:22] delivered
[48:24] god to us in this hour
[48:26] and lord we don't want to take it for
[48:27] granted i
[48:29] was thinking of sister strokhorp's song
[48:31] and god i
[48:32] know that i will have to answer for
[48:34] every idle word and
[48:36] god each of us
[48:38] when we think of that lord it brings a
[48:40] real soberness to us
[48:42] but god we pray that your grace would be
[48:44] sufficient for us as well
[48:47] that lord you would help us instruct us
[48:49] lord
[48:50] every day
[48:52] lord to be a
[48:54] a proper child
[48:56] lord that we would be pleasing to you
[48:59] we thank you god for your love to us and
[49:01] lord this time we have together we want
[49:04] to commit this service to you
[49:06] god we invite you to walk every aisle
[49:09] lord send again that pillar of fire lord
[49:13] to begin to discern every thought and
[49:16] intent of our heart and lord minister to
[49:18] the need that each of us has we ask
[49:21] these things in jesus christ's name amen
[49:25] and god bless you can be seated
[49:29] i
[49:32] would like to speak about in in desert
[49:35] places
[49:36] tonight and
[49:39] i am certainly
[49:43] not going to probably teach you all much
[49:46] of anything about the desert
[49:48] um
[49:51] and i'm not an eloquent enough speaker i
[49:55] know that we have some ministers here
[49:57] that could far better um are probably
[50:00] have studied into this far in far
[50:02] greater detail so i'm not even going to
[50:04] come close to
[50:06] to uh
[50:08] scratching the surface
[50:10] as to um
[50:12] these desert places and and why
[50:16] why
[50:18] does the bible so many times and so
[50:21] frequently
[50:25] use the pattern of the desert
[50:28] um because we find it in multiple places
[50:30] in the bible
[50:32] and i know that there are ministers who
[50:33] have who could far do a far better job
[50:36] and and there's so much to it
[50:39] so i'm only going to just scratch a
[50:41] little bit and i'll tell you
[50:42] what
[50:46] what inspired this thought was i was at
[50:48] home
[50:49] and
[50:51] we have our devotions in the morning as
[50:52] a family and more times than not it's
[50:56] just my wife and my children
[50:58] and
[51:00] we've um
[51:02] we've started
[51:03] uh
[51:05] listening to a portion of
[51:07] of some of the messages
[51:09] along with our bible reading and prayer
[51:11] and so forth and
[51:14] sister grace will take about 15 minutes
[51:17] and play a portion of a message for the
[51:20] children
[51:21] well for all of us
[51:22] and uh
[51:24] she started i think with the church age
[51:26] book and then she went through the seven
[51:28] seals with the children and now they're
[51:30] going through the hebrew series which
[51:34] i i i've preached so much about that
[51:37] here um between brother dennis and i
[51:40] um
[51:41] but it's such a blessing
[51:43] you you just to hear those tapes playing
[51:46] and then you hear something brother
[51:47] branham says and the way he says it even
[51:50] just really strikes your heart and you
[51:52] say my
[51:53] that was so perfectly put
[51:56] that the the way he even said it is so
[51:59] perfectly said
[52:00] and
[52:01] so of course
[52:02] the the inspiration for what i'm about
[52:05] to say um came from this hebrew series
[52:08] and i'm going to read it for you but of
[52:10] course at the end
[52:13] because i want to i want the
[52:16] anticipation to build here in your
[52:18] hearts and say when's he gonna get to it
[52:20] please
[52:21] um
[52:22] but this the bible does speak a lot
[52:25] about the desert and the wilderness
[52:28] and sometimes i wonder why why why this
[52:31] pattern
[52:33] over and over and what is the
[52:34] significance
[52:36] of the desert
[52:38] and we look at what is a desert what
[52:40] what what
[52:42] what characteristics of the desert do we
[52:45] notice and do we see when we when we
[52:47] look into them not only into the bible
[52:50] but into the message of the hour
[52:52] uh
[52:54] you know brother branham uses a lot of
[52:57] types and shadows throughout his
[52:59] ministry and he said that's just how he
[53:01] preached he didn't have the theological
[53:04] ability according to brother branham to
[53:06] be able to um
[53:10] i don't know what he couldn't do but
[53:12] according to him he you know he just
[53:14] wasn't a theologian he said so i type
[53:16] from i use types and shadows and i'm so
[53:19] thankful for that
[53:20] it makes me to be able to understand
[53:23] what he's what he you know makes the
[53:25] picture very clear
[53:26] to us
[53:28] when we're reading our bible
[53:30] but when we look at the desert we notice
[53:33] certain
[53:34] characteristics of the desert there's a
[53:36] lack of water therefore
[53:39] a lack of life
[53:41] it's very scarce
[53:44] we notice that
[53:45] it's very vast
[53:47] especially
[53:48] uh well you know phoenix
[53:51] the phoenix area between here in phoenix
[53:54] you know
[53:54] that's quite a large span of desert and
[53:58] quite frankly
[53:59] i was shocked to find out that even
[54:01] flagstaff is considered a high high
[54:04] plateau desert
[54:06] and so
[54:07] i suppose the whole southwest when you
[54:10] look at
[54:10] new mexico arizona colorado nevada
[54:14] even into california they're a portion
[54:16] of the way so much desert it's very vast
[54:19] it's a very large area
[54:22] but it's very lonely
[54:26] again because of the lack of water there
[54:28] there's just you don't see
[54:30] a lot of wildlife running through the
[54:34] desert like you would
[54:35] a heavily wooded and watered
[54:40] environment
[54:43] and i
[54:44] have several quotes and
[54:50] and if i'm hoping the brothers can pull
[54:51] this up i'd like to read you uh
[54:53] something brother branham says from
[54:54] ashamed and there's so many uh times
[54:58] brother branham
[54:59] says this very same things he's going to
[55:02] say here but in a different way and he
[55:04] says it multiple times and so you can
[55:06] find this
[55:07] said many different ways from brother
[55:10] branham
[55:11] but he says here
[55:13] well i said
[55:15] i had to come out here
[55:17] and separate myself come to this desert
[55:24] and i thought wonder why god would bring
[55:27] me to a desert
[55:29] out here where there's nothing but
[55:31] scorpions and gila monsters
[55:35] it's not only a desert is it hot
[55:38] but it's spiritually a desert oh my
[55:42] there's no spiritual life at all in the
[55:45] churches
[55:46] they're against why you never seen such
[55:49] in your life
[55:50] we don't even have a church to go to or
[55:52] nothing
[55:54] and then when the people almost perish
[55:57] spiritually
[55:58] i notice it in the people that come out
[56:00] there see the differences in them
[56:03] watching it
[56:05] and so
[56:06] you stay under the spirit of god and
[56:09] your life becomes sweet
[56:11] tender
[56:12] like water brings this grass and soft
[56:15] buds if this grass and arizona wouldn't
[56:18] grow
[56:19] these trees would be cactus
[56:21] them
[56:22] them leaves just wind up and make
[56:25] stickery
[56:26] that's the way it is when you get dry
[56:29] around the church
[56:30] everybody's sticking one another you
[56:32] know and see you got to have soft waters
[56:35] of rain soften you up and make leaves
[56:39] and shade for the pilgrim that passes by
[56:43] find many many places brother branham
[56:46] said out in the desert uh the
[56:49] what it is is there's these stickers and
[56:51] if they would just be
[56:53] uh get receiving the water that that we
[56:56] receive on the east coast why those
[56:58] stickers would open up and they'd be
[57:00] soft leaves and so forth and i'm sure
[57:02] you all know what i'm talking about
[57:04] this is said many a time
[57:07] through the message of the hour
[57:12] and so just looking at this brother
[57:14] branham said i had to come out here and
[57:16] separate myself and that is something
[57:19] that is a pattern we see over and over
[57:22] and over in the scripture is that there
[57:25] is a desire that god desires men and
[57:28] women to get alone with god
[57:31] to separate themselves
[57:34] from the abundance of other people the
[57:37] abundance of other influence the voices
[57:40] that can be here and there and here and
[57:42] there god wants to get you alone so that
[57:44] he can talk to you one on one
[57:48] and he uses a desert
[57:50] as a type there
[57:52] now i don't know about i don't know how
[57:53] you feel
[57:55] but
[57:56] i always as a an as a arizona native
[57:59] when i read
[58:01] something like this and he says it's not
[58:03] only a desert is it hot but it's
[58:04] spiritually a desert it's like ooh
[58:08] well i happen to live
[58:10] in a desert state
[58:15] and
[58:16] i think if we're
[58:18] overly sensitive it'd be easy for us
[58:21] to kind of hang our heads a little bit
[58:24] and say well you know
[58:26] i'm kind of one of those you'll find
[58:28] places where brother branham
[58:30] says that uh the people uh the climate
[58:33] that they live in you'll find that that
[58:35] the characteristics of the people are a
[58:37] lot like the climate they live in
[58:41] if it's real dry the people are real dry
[58:43] and stickery if the p if the place is
[58:45] real cold the people are cold and
[58:47] starchy
[58:48] well i got the worst of all of that
[58:51] not only do i live in the desert
[58:53] southwest but i live up in northern
[58:54] arizona where it gets real cold
[58:58] so i guess i should be hanging my head
[59:00] lower than anybody in this room
[59:03] saying if if the people are like the
[59:06] climate they live in then woe is me
[59:09] but you and i as children of god have
[59:12] got to be able to understand what
[59:16] who brother branham is talking about and
[59:18] what he's talking about when he says
[59:19] this
[59:20] and you've got to be able to when you
[59:22] read the bible
[59:23] no is that speaking of me now or is that
[59:27] speaking of me
[59:28] back then or is that speaking of me in
[59:32] future reference
[59:34] and that's called rightly dividing the
[59:36] word of god
[59:38] and so if you read this and you say well
[59:41] man we live in the desert and it's a
[59:43] spiritually a desert
[59:45] you know there's no spiritual life at
[59:47] all in the churches
[59:49] what churches is brother branham
[59:51] speaking about
[59:52] the churches he's speaking about is a
[59:55] church that is called to the moving of
[59:57] the spirit of god a church who is not
[1:00:01] living in the full word of god
[1:00:05] that would be a cold dry dead church now
[1:00:09] if you say that's not our church well
[1:00:12] praise god the waters of god are falling
[1:00:16] upon the church and it's soft keeps you
[1:00:19] soft and it and it makes you flowery and
[1:00:23] lovely like the lord jesus would want
[1:00:26] and and if that's you you can say
[1:00:29] praise god that's that's us by the grace
[1:00:32] of god i fit that
[1:00:35] and and then you're not in you're not
[1:00:37] wondering oh god is it me am i sticking
[1:00:40] everybody am i punching at everybody
[1:00:45] it's rightly dividing
[1:00:47] the word of god now
[1:00:49] we want to see that this is
[1:00:53] these examples these
[1:00:55] uh these patterns in the bible
[1:00:58] are patterns for
[1:01:01] not necessarily physical
[1:01:04] location but for a spiritual speaking
[1:01:08] spiritually
[1:01:11] and we see that god is a god of variety
[1:01:14] and in
[1:01:15] 1957 the india trip report
[1:01:19] brother branham
[1:01:23] says and god
[1:01:24] made us all different
[1:01:27] because he's a god of variety
[1:01:29] do you believe that
[1:01:30] he makes big mountains and little
[1:01:33] mountains and he makes deserts and he
[1:01:35] makes oceans
[1:01:37] and he makes white flowers and he makes
[1:01:39] blue flowers
[1:01:40] and he makes red flowers and he makes
[1:01:42] little men big men red-headed
[1:01:45] black-headed blue-headed
[1:01:47] he makes yellow brown black men
[1:01:50] he's a god of variety
[1:01:52] he's not a sears and robot harmony house
[1:01:55] he's he's a god of variety see
[1:01:58] now he makes a variety
[1:02:01] because that's what he likes
[1:02:04] i like
[1:02:05] the way he likes
[1:02:07] i like it because he likes it
[1:02:10] and when he's in here
[1:02:12] you like the things that he likes
[1:02:15] that's the reason i love nature in its
[1:02:18] primitive condition
[1:02:27] so you see brother branham said that he
[1:02:29] makes mountains he makes deserts
[1:02:32] he makes oceans
[1:02:36] and
[1:02:38] if we were looking at the physical and
[1:02:40] we were saying well i don't want to be
[1:02:42] in a place that's desert-like i don't
[1:02:45] want to live in a spiritually dead
[1:02:47] condition
[1:02:48] and we said well is that speaking about
[1:02:51] tucson is that speaking about arizona
[1:02:53] well then we'd all need to get up
[1:02:56] and we'd need to move
[1:02:57] to some location where there's lots of
[1:02:59] water
[1:03:00] there's lots of trees and lots of
[1:03:02] flowers
[1:03:04] and lots of mosquitoes and ticks and
[1:03:06] chiggers
[1:03:07] and cockroaches
[1:03:12] and and then we could then maybe we
[1:03:14] could spiritually type the cockroaches
[1:03:16] and the mosquitoes as blood suckers and
[1:03:19] vampires and so on and so forth
[1:03:23] and and and i don't mean to make light
[1:03:25] but
[1:03:26] listen to this next quote from questions
[1:03:28] and answers number three brother branham
[1:03:30] says
[1:03:31] i'm something like abraham was
[1:03:33] i'm looking for a city see i can't find
[1:03:36] it but i know it's there but i certainly
[1:03:39] can't get adjusted to any certain place
[1:03:43] on this earth
[1:03:45] it just don't look like find people find
[1:03:48] places and you go here it's too wet go
[1:03:52] there it's too dry go up here it's too
[1:03:56] cold go down there it's too hot see and
[1:04:00] you there's no place it just ain't home
[1:04:05] don't want to take up my time crying on
[1:04:08] your shoulder
[1:04:11] but see brother branham calls himself uh
[1:04:14] restless winds and shifting sands you
[1:04:17] hear him talk about that and he says you
[1:04:19] know i go here for a little while i go
[1:04:21] home and you know and and and i feel
[1:04:24] itchy i gotta go i gotta go preach the
[1:04:26] gospel somewhere so he says i go
[1:04:28] overseas and i'm preaching the gospel
[1:04:30] and i start missing home and i wanna go
[1:04:32] back home and i see an airplane fly over
[1:04:34] and i just think i need to get on that i
[1:04:37] gotta go again
[1:04:39] that's that restless feeling that every
[1:04:42] believers got knowing this is not our
[1:04:45] final destination
[1:04:47] this is not home for us in this too hot
[1:04:51] too dry too cold too wet to this
[1:04:54] condition
[1:04:56] we're not satisfied with this place
[1:04:59] we're waiting for this sin condition to
[1:05:02] be removed from this earth let this
[1:05:04] earth receive its baptism and then it
[1:05:07] would be a fit place for a believer
[1:05:13] but no wonder we feel so restless is
[1:05:16] this home is this home is this home
[1:05:19] we don't belong here
[1:05:30] and i just wanted to
[1:05:34] i just wanted to get that
[1:05:36] out there and get that clear because
[1:05:41] we go through some desert times in our
[1:05:45] life
[1:05:46] and the devil would like to get you
[1:05:48] restless
[1:05:50] he'd like to get you thinking
[1:05:53] uh why are you in this dry condition
[1:05:55] feels like the water's been shut off it
[1:05:58] feels like things are drying up and
[1:06:00] is something wrong with your walk with
[1:06:03] the lord
[1:06:04] and you begin searching your life
[1:06:06] and it might be
[1:06:09] that the lord is desiring a personal
[1:06:12] audience with you or me
[1:06:15] he's wanting to get you alone
[1:06:17] you know brother dennis preaches a
[1:06:19] beautiful message on grapes
[1:06:22] and wine
[1:06:23] and he speaks about the vineyard
[1:06:26] he says you know
[1:06:27] when growing grapes they grow them in a
[1:06:29] real rocky place and
[1:06:32] they'll let the the vines kind of grow
[1:06:34] up
[1:06:35] and they'll really pour the water on
[1:06:37] them and it'll push all that water to
[1:06:40] the fruit
[1:06:41] and it'll get that fruit to where it's
[1:06:43] real big and plump and juicy and then
[1:06:46] what they what the vineyard
[1:06:48] men do the husband they'll cut the water
[1:06:50] off
[1:06:52] and what it does is it causes that the
[1:06:55] fruit to pull all the sugars from the
[1:06:58] rest of the plant and pull it into the
[1:07:00] grape and the grape becomes real sweet
[1:07:05] and sometimes when you when when you see
[1:07:08] that type how that there's times when
[1:07:10] god will seemly
[1:07:12] cut the water off
[1:07:14] and you think
[1:07:16] god what is going on i feel so alone i
[1:07:18] feel so dry and god is desiring to
[1:07:21] sweeten your life with prayer
[1:07:24] he's wanting to get you to look to him
[1:07:26] to get alone with him in prayer so that
[1:07:29] he can sweeten your life
[1:07:32] not to just be be grapes but to have
[1:07:36] that stimulation of revelation to have
[1:07:38] that wine ability that that ability to
[1:07:41] create uh like a like wine dozen bottles
[1:07:43] that expansion that life that
[1:07:46] fermentation of god in your life
[1:07:51] it's not me
[1:07:56] now when we read in the bible and again
[1:07:59] i realize i'm going through this quickly
[1:08:01] but i think that everybody will be
[1:08:02] happier with that in the end when we go
[1:08:05] home early
[1:08:07] but we see these characters throughout
[1:08:09] the bible
[1:08:11] and the more i began to go through and
[1:08:13] say how many of these characters
[1:08:16] do we find god calling
[1:08:19] into the desert
[1:08:21] the more i realized there's a lot more
[1:08:25] than i can i think i could mention
[1:08:29] but i looked at these characters that
[1:08:30] god called into the desert and i be i
[1:08:33] started now i only started with abraham
[1:08:36] i think we could go back further in fact
[1:08:38] i think we could look at adam and eve
[1:08:40] leaving the garden
[1:08:41] and going into the wilderness but i
[1:08:44] started with abraham
[1:08:46] and i thought well certainly abraham was
[1:08:48] called out into the desert and we can
[1:08:50] you can read all about that and how that
[1:08:52] he was there with lot and he said lot
[1:08:54] take your pick where you would go and
[1:08:56] what lot saw the well-watered plains of
[1:08:59] of sodom and gomorrah and that's the
[1:09:01] direction he went well well
[1:09:03] abraham stayed up in the high plains and
[1:09:05] into the desert area and we see god
[1:09:08] uh speaking to abraham in these desert
[1:09:12] places
[1:09:13] while lot living down in the
[1:09:15] well-watered places seemingly he just
[1:09:19] rejects the word of god to live
[1:09:23] in pleasure for a season
[1:09:26] we know his his soul was vexed and so
[1:09:28] forth but
[1:09:29] you see the type then i looked and i
[1:09:31] thought well if if abraham was i i know
[1:09:34] of jacob was because i i i
[1:09:37] had done enough study
[1:09:39] on jacob
[1:09:41] but i thought what about isaac and sure
[1:09:42] enough he also would call isaac out into
[1:09:46] the desert as well and you can see that
[1:09:48] when he goes especially to go
[1:09:51] um
[1:09:52] he's digging wells because of of
[1:09:54] droughts so you see isaac out in the
[1:09:56] desert as well but we look at jacob and
[1:10:00] jacob
[1:10:01] being the jacob that he was
[1:10:06] as soon as he gets in trouble with his
[1:10:08] brother he flees and he flees to the
[1:10:10] desert and that's where we find jacob is
[1:10:12] in a desert place
[1:10:14] when he's laying down his head upon the
[1:10:16] stone and god gives him the dream
[1:10:20] jacob's ladder
[1:10:21] and and it's in that moment that that
[1:10:24] and it's such a beautiful thing when you
[1:10:27] when you listen to brother branham
[1:10:28] express to us that that ladder that that
[1:10:32] that jacob was seeing was was christ and
[1:10:36] how that that ladder was access for men
[1:10:39] and women to have access to god and it
[1:10:41] was anchored in jesus christ on earth it
[1:10:45] was anchored on earth in jesus christ so
[1:10:47] that we could have access into heaven
[1:10:50] and and when you read that it's so
[1:10:52] beautiful it's so marvelous and even
[1:10:55] when you look into your scripture when
[1:10:57] he wakes from the dream he builds this
[1:10:59] altar and god tells jacob look north
[1:11:03] look south look east and look west and
[1:11:06] he perfectly draws out the cross and he
[1:11:10] says remember this place for this is the
[1:11:12] land that i've given you but it's only
[1:11:14] through the cross it was only through
[1:11:16] christ
[1:11:17] that we had that access
[1:11:20] it's just it's beautiful and you can
[1:11:22] read into in into these scriptures and
[1:11:24] see that that's beautiful but you see
[1:11:26] him in a desert place we see joseph
[1:11:30] joseph when his brothers cast him into a
[1:11:32] pit it was out in the wilderness out in
[1:11:35] the desert and you can if you go back
[1:11:37] and you you read these scriptures you
[1:11:39] see that joseph was in a desert place
[1:11:42] when he's down in that pit representing
[1:11:45] christ
[1:11:46] having to die
[1:11:48] and and go go into hell for our sins but
[1:11:52] joseph when he comes out he goes into we
[1:11:56] we know the story of joseph uh going
[1:11:59] into egypt and then sitting at the right
[1:12:01] hand of pharaoh
[1:12:02] but we see that that desert place was
[1:12:05] necessary for joseph
[1:12:08] it was another step into the visions
[1:12:12] that he had had
[1:12:13] that had to be fulfilled it was a
[1:12:16] process that god needed to get
[1:12:18] joseph through
[1:12:22] we look at moses
[1:12:24] and that one's pretty
[1:12:26] self-explanatory
[1:12:28] when we see moses
[1:12:31] who kills an egyptian and goes into the
[1:12:34] backside of the desert we look at elijah
[1:12:38] we look at elisha
[1:12:40] we look at john the baptist
[1:12:42] we look at jesus
[1:12:44] jesus after being baptized goes up into
[1:12:47] the wilderness and is tempted of the
[1:12:49] devil we see him in this desert place
[1:12:52] and afterwards after
[1:12:55] using the word to overcome satan the
[1:12:58] angels minister to him
[1:13:00] but we see this time of desert
[1:13:03] temptation
[1:13:04] this desert trial in his life and also
[1:13:06] you can read in many a place where jesus
[1:13:09] would bring the people out and his
[1:13:11] disciples out into a desert place
[1:13:14] he brought the people out in a desert
[1:13:16] place when he multiplied the fishes in
[1:13:20] the loaves
[1:13:22] and the disciples said what are we going
[1:13:24] to do with these people we've pulled
[1:13:25] them into a desert place how are we
[1:13:28] going to feed them send them home and he
[1:13:29] says go feed them
[1:13:32] they said we don't have any he says what
[1:13:33] do you have and that's when he begins to
[1:13:36] break the fishes in the loaves
[1:13:39] it's in the desert that you find
[1:13:42] that god will sustain life
[1:13:46] in a desert condition
[1:13:48] you think that's impossible it's so dry
[1:13:50] there's how are you going to find water
[1:13:51] how
[1:13:53] what seems impossible
[1:13:55] is just an opportunity for god to
[1:13:58] exercise who he is
[1:14:04] in 1958
[1:14:06] the message time
[1:14:08] tested faith
[1:14:11] brother branham says no man
[1:14:13] has the right to take the pulpit to
[1:14:16] preach the gospel
[1:14:17] unless he's had a backside of the desert
[1:14:19] experience
[1:14:22] no man no person
[1:14:24] has the right to call themselves a
[1:14:27] christian
[1:14:28] until they've had a backside of the
[1:14:30] desert experience
[1:14:34] it's still the backside of the desert we
[1:14:36] call it upper room
[1:14:39] but it's still
[1:14:40] the back side of the desert too
[1:14:43] it's where you meet god
[1:14:48] it's so much more pleasant to think
[1:14:50] upper room because we've got air
[1:14:51] conditioning we've got electricity today
[1:14:54] so we think sure upper room sure i'll
[1:14:56] stay in the upper room for 10 days
[1:14:57] that'd be a great vacation for a while
[1:14:59] but what brother branham is showing us
[1:15:01] here is call it up a room all you want
[1:15:03] to it's still a backside of the desert
[1:15:06] experience
[1:15:08] it's where you and god
[1:15:11] meet alone
[1:15:14] it's where all the noise of everything
[1:15:16] else can be shut out and you
[1:15:19] are relying upon god to give you an
[1:15:22] answer
[1:15:24] because if you stay there too long
[1:15:28] what could happen
[1:15:29] oh
[1:15:31] lions and tigers and bears oh my
[1:15:34] just let your mind go to work there
[1:15:37] what could happen if you stayed out
[1:15:39] there too long
[1:15:42] this was the upper room experience
[1:15:45] just go up there and tarry until
[1:15:48] well until what's that mean one two days
[1:15:51] three days
[1:15:52] we don't know
[1:15:54] well it just so happens we know now it
[1:15:56] was 10 days
[1:15:57] but they didn't know 10 days
[1:16:02] how long does it take
[1:16:04] for you to get quiet enough
[1:16:07] how long does it take for you to get to
[1:16:09] shed the things of the world to shed the
[1:16:12] noise of work to shed the noise of
[1:16:14] church to shed the noise
[1:16:17] of family and and everybody will shed
[1:16:20] the noise
[1:16:22] and get alone with god
[1:16:27] he knows how to do it
[1:16:32] you think of those children of israel
[1:16:34] out on the backside of that desert
[1:16:37] he knows how to shed all those things
[1:16:40] he knows how to get rid of it but the
[1:16:42] good news is
[1:16:43] their feet
[1:16:44] never swell
[1:16:46] their clothes never rotted god has a
[1:16:49] sustaining ability
[1:16:51] you don't worry god will take care of
[1:16:53] his end
[1:16:54] you just get rid of the things you need
[1:16:57] to get rid of and get alone to talk to
[1:16:59] god
[1:17:02] see god provides and he sustains life in
[1:17:04] the desert i don't know if you've ever
[1:17:06] seen any of these uh national geographic
[1:17:08] uh documentaries of the different places
[1:17:11] of the earth uh they've got all these
[1:17:13] ones and the arctic and the tropical
[1:17:15] forests and the oceans and well they
[1:17:18] also do the desert and it's just amazing
[1:17:22] to see the different
[1:17:24] creatures that are in our desert and the
[1:17:26] way that they sustain life you look at
[1:17:28] these spiders who are able to create
[1:17:31] spider webs to collect the dew so that
[1:17:33] the dew will run down the strings and
[1:17:35] sustain them with enough water that they
[1:17:37] could live you look at the toads that
[1:17:40] live in the desert that dig themselves
[1:17:42] down deep enough they wait for the rains
[1:17:44] then they form themselves a bubble and
[1:17:46] they dig way down in the ground and it
[1:17:48] maybe not won't rain for years
[1:17:51] and then as soon as rain shows up again
[1:17:53] those toads are there
[1:17:55] and you think where did these toads come
[1:17:57] from
[1:17:59] where's moses speaking these things into
[1:18:01] existence out of
[1:18:03] but it's because they've sustained life
[1:18:05] down into the mud they know how to do
[1:18:08] that god put it within them to do that
[1:18:11] and it's just amazing how god provides
[1:18:15] in desert conditions
[1:18:17] when when you're in a desert place god
[1:18:20] has got a way that he can give you life
[1:18:25] hey i
[1:18:26] i
[1:18:27] look at abraham
[1:18:29] who goes out into the wilderness and he
[1:18:31] and and god just tells him you've got to
[1:18:33] go you you got to you've got to go and
[1:18:36] you've got to take your son and you've
[1:18:37] got to sacrifice him and he goes and
[1:18:39] he's way out in the wilderness and and
[1:18:41] then after three days he sees the
[1:18:43] mountain a long way off and he goes way
[1:18:46] out there brother brandon said he goes
[1:18:47] so far out there there's no life out
[1:18:49] there
[1:18:50] and he goes up on this hill and his son
[1:18:52] says father where's the sacrifice he
[1:18:54] says where's the lamb a son god will
[1:18:57] provide himself a lamb and brother
[1:18:59] brahma said there how could there be a
[1:19:00] ram out there that lions would have eat
[1:19:03] them up they would have been hunted and
[1:19:05] killed at that rampant been there in
[1:19:08] that thicket the whole time but god was
[1:19:10] jehovah jireh god was able to put a ram
[1:19:14] there for a sacrifice when he needed a
[1:19:16] ram there
[1:19:18] the the story is not for us to see that
[1:19:22] god can create rams we could just read
[1:19:24] genesis 1 and see that god's able to
[1:19:27] create rams but for us to see the faith
[1:19:30] that abraham had in god
[1:19:33] that's the point we want to get from the
[1:19:35] story is that god abraham finally got to
[1:19:39] a place that he knew god can provide
[1:19:47] when moses took the children of israel
[1:19:49] out into the wilderness
[1:19:51] and the children of israel finally
[1:19:54] said
[1:19:55] hey we're free from egypt oh praise god
[1:19:59] we're free from egypt we're out of that
[1:20:01] place no more bondage and whips on our
[1:20:03] backs
[1:20:04] this is great
[1:20:08] i'm kind of hungry
[1:20:14] i'm kind of thirsty
[1:20:16] hot out here
[1:20:18] you know i used to be able to go down to
[1:20:21] the supermarket in goshen
[1:20:24] and grab myself some food but
[1:20:28] maybe we didn't think this one through
[1:20:29] all the way
[1:20:32] but god
[1:20:34] was able to sustain them
[1:20:37] god gave them quail
[1:20:39] god sent them manna
[1:20:42] and god gave them a rock of all things
[1:20:46] he gave them a rock
[1:20:48] that put out enough water
[1:20:52] to sustain all those people and all
[1:20:54] their animals
[1:20:56] any guests that would like to come visit
[1:20:58] the camp
[1:20:59] to hear a good sermon
[1:21:02] he provided enough water for that
[1:21:07] he's able to sustain life
[1:21:11] when elijah brother ed
[1:21:14] when elijah
[1:21:16] was called out into the desert that god
[1:21:19] called him to separate him out into the
[1:21:21] desert
[1:21:22] and he found himself underneath a
[1:21:24] juniper tree god was able to provide
[1:21:28] sandwiches for elijah
[1:21:31] and have them
[1:21:33] delivered from ubereats
[1:21:36] the crows
[1:21:39] he sent the crows to feed elijah
[1:21:42] and then he sent him angels
[1:21:44] to sustain him as well
[1:21:47] and then he sent him to a widow woman to
[1:21:49] sustain him
[1:21:51] god is able
[1:21:54] to sustain life in desert places
[1:21:58] we look at elisha
[1:22:01] who's sitting in the city and the people
[1:22:05] are in this desert city and it's so bad
[1:22:07] they're eating children
[1:22:10] but elisha gets a word from the lord and
[1:22:12] says tomorrow
[1:22:14] we'll be eating the finest flower and
[1:22:16] we'll be eating these finest cakes and
[1:22:19] it'll be cheaper than you've ever seen
[1:22:21] it before and they think that's
[1:22:23] impossible
[1:22:24] and then god sends four lepers
[1:22:28] to go to the enemy's camp to sustain not
[1:22:31] just the lepers but the city
[1:22:37] god was able to let the enemies hear the
[1:22:40] the feet of soldiers coming and let them
[1:22:44] run in fear
[1:22:45] so that these four lepers could bring
[1:22:47] back the good news that god
[1:22:51] keeps his word and he sustains life in
[1:22:54] the desert
[1:22:56] we look at john the baptist who from the
[1:22:58] time he was a child was called out into
[1:23:00] the desert called out into the
[1:23:02] wilderness and here we find john
[1:23:05] feasting on locust and honey
[1:23:09] the desert delight
[1:23:14] but it was molding
[1:23:16] that elijah character in john
[1:23:20] it was making him a certain way
[1:23:22] so that when he could bring the word of
[1:23:24] god he could use types and shadows of
[1:23:27] wilderness talk to get the message
[1:23:29] across to those people in that day and
[1:23:32] it shook the known world
[1:23:36] we look at jesus
[1:23:38] when he calls like i said he calls us
[1:23:40] multitude out into the desert
[1:23:43] and he's multiplying fishes and loaves
[1:23:46] so much so that they're taking up
[1:23:47] baskets
[1:23:49] afterwards for the leftovers
[1:23:56] now i'm getting to this
[1:24:01] i'm getting to the highlight how about
[1:24:02] that
[1:24:04] i'm gonna get
[1:24:05] i'm gonna read for you
[1:24:08] what we heard in our devotions that
[1:24:10] excited me so much
[1:24:14] and in the end when i ask the question
[1:24:17] why the desert
[1:24:19] why does god speak of these desert
[1:24:21] places and why
[1:24:27] why can we as children of god relate so
[1:24:31] well
[1:24:35] you know god loves to take you into
[1:24:38] these desert places
[1:24:46] there's something about it i felt so bad
[1:24:48] when i married my wife she was from
[1:24:50] south carolina
[1:24:51] everything's green
[1:24:52] vines
[1:24:54] you know if you spit out the window you
[1:24:55] grow a
[1:24:56] tree you know it's just
[1:24:59] you can't kill grass i don't think you
[1:25:02] know it's
[1:25:04] and she came out to arizona
[1:25:06] and she said yuck
[1:25:10] it's so brown
[1:25:12] it's so dry my beautiful south
[1:25:15] carolinian moistened skin all the time
[1:25:18] is cracking and i feel like i'm becoming
[1:25:20] a lizard
[1:25:22] in arizona and i thought
[1:25:24] uh
[1:25:26] uh it is seems a little selfish
[1:25:29] um
[1:25:33] but i feel like
[1:25:35] i don't know how you men feel
[1:25:37] but to me arizona's ma is man's land
[1:25:43] it's it's just man's land i don't know
[1:25:45] what it is every
[1:25:47] every giant boulder i see i want to go
[1:25:49] climb it
[1:25:51] except with brother john and brother
[1:25:52] peter with ropes
[1:25:56] but you know there's just something
[1:25:57] about it's real rugged when you see the
[1:25:59] mountains even this evening when we
[1:26:00] pulled up into the church and i looked
[1:26:02] out and saw the shadows on the mountains
[1:26:04] i just thought oh man that looks so good
[1:26:07] i want to be there i want to climb that
[1:26:10] so bad but it's it's me it's real rugged
[1:26:12] it's very man-like
[1:26:14] uh you know it's just what men would
[1:26:16] like real ruggedness
[1:26:18] and i think with time i'm
[1:26:22] you know i have talked to my wife
[1:26:24] uh from time to time and and she has
[1:26:27] admitted when we've taken a trip maybe
[1:26:29] from uh phoenix up to
[1:26:32] northern arizona we go up by payson and
[1:26:34] you go up in that area and you see that
[1:26:36] change from saguaro cactus up into
[1:26:39] granite boulders and
[1:26:41] so forth so
[1:26:43] she's admitted
[1:26:45] that's it's very beautiful
[1:26:48] and that's a miracle
[1:26:50] you know that god could
[1:26:52] you know either pull the scales off her
[1:26:54] eyes or maybe just put a lens of man on
[1:26:57] her eyes i don't know
[1:26:59] but
[1:27:00] uh
[1:27:02] it seems so selfish to me you know as a
[1:27:05] man i love it
[1:27:07] i love that that that desert
[1:27:10] ruggedness and rocks and mountains and
[1:27:13] so forth
[1:27:16] and there's something about the desert
[1:27:19] and and i
[1:27:20] again
[1:27:21] i think it would be wrong for me to over
[1:27:24] spiritualize
[1:27:26] and say well the prophet came here
[1:27:28] uh because the prophet went everywhere
[1:27:31] around the world seven times and like we
[1:27:33] just read he couldn't find home no
[1:27:35] matter where he went
[1:27:45] but to get out alone
[1:27:47] into the desert
[1:27:49] i find so many times when i have gone
[1:27:52] out
[1:27:53] i think
[1:27:55] you all remember i think it was the last
[1:27:56] time i was here i was hunting and i
[1:28:00] and i went on a desert walk
[1:28:02] to go hunting i took a long way longer
[1:28:05] than i thought it was and i brought two
[1:28:07] bottles of water and that was it
[1:28:09] and i thought i was gonna die
[1:28:12] uh
[1:28:12] i was like marking my spot on my gps so
[1:28:15] i could send it to my wife the last
[1:28:17] button i pushed when i died so she could
[1:28:19] find my body
[1:28:22] um
[1:28:24] but i tell you what
[1:28:26] if you've ever been so thirsty
[1:28:29] that you say i would drink anything
[1:28:32] right now
[1:28:34] i mean you see the filthiest stagnated
[1:28:37] water and you think i might drink that
[1:28:41] knowing
[1:28:42] full well you're going to be sick if you
[1:28:44] do
[1:28:45] but you're just when that dryness hits
[1:28:48] your mouth
[1:28:50] but what's amazing to me is
[1:28:52] the amount of times i called on god
[1:28:57] went on that walk
[1:28:59] lord
[1:29:01] i know
[1:29:02] this is a vast place
[1:29:05] but you fill all time in space
[1:29:08] god i need you to get me out of here
[1:29:11] i need you to get me to water
[1:29:15] and the idea is that
[1:29:18] why can't i do that when i'm in
[1:29:21] the green
[1:29:22] times the
[1:29:24] water times
[1:29:26] why does it take as brother branham say
[1:29:29] desperation
[1:29:35] and you hear him say you know i wished
[1:29:39] it was that way all the time
[1:29:45] i suppose it's human nature
[1:29:49] and what a shameful thing for us as
[1:29:52] human nature in our fallen state
[1:29:55] that it takes desperation for us
[1:29:58] sometimes
[1:29:59] to call on god like we ought to all the
[1:30:02] time
[1:30:03] but god knows
[1:30:05] he knows how
[1:30:07] to get you to call upon him and to have
[1:30:11] a discussion with him
[1:30:13] and i want to read this for you
[1:30:16] it's from hebrews
[1:30:18] chapter 3
[1:30:21] says god loves to bring you in trouble
[1:30:26] he loves to put trouble down and see
[1:30:28] what you'll do about it
[1:30:31] so he just stopped up the red sea and
[1:30:33] the first thing you know marched them
[1:30:35] right out into this place then sent
[1:30:37] pharaoh after them see how god likes to
[1:30:40] do it
[1:30:42] he loves to display his power and love
[1:30:45] he's god
[1:30:47] and he just loves to show you who he is
[1:30:49] amen
[1:30:52] and the trouble of it is today people
[1:30:54] say oh them days has passed
[1:30:57] no
[1:30:59] how can god display himself
[1:31:01] when you're taught such stuff as that
[1:31:04] but god loves to manifest himself
[1:31:09] here come the children of israel walking
[1:31:12] in the light moses going on before them
[1:31:15] there they was come on this is the way
[1:31:18] god is calling we're going out we're
[1:31:20] going to the promised land oh hallelujah
[1:31:24] here they all was shouting and jumping
[1:31:27] and having a good time you know and the
[1:31:29] first thing you know they looked back
[1:31:31] and said oh
[1:31:33] what's that dust
[1:31:35] one of them climbed up on a hill said
[1:31:38] oh oh
[1:31:40] alas alas it's pharaoh's army
[1:31:44] god said
[1:31:45] what you're scared about
[1:31:48] didn't you believe what i did down there
[1:31:52] what you worried about why
[1:31:55] you make me angry
[1:31:57] when they got down there moses went out
[1:32:00] and interceded to god god just opened up
[1:32:03] the red sea and they walked across
[1:32:06] closed the enemy in
[1:32:08] that's the way god does it
[1:32:11] don't get scared
[1:32:12] don't get all excited don't be
[1:32:15] frustrated you provoke god
[1:32:20] then what did he do
[1:32:22] look like well
[1:32:24] we had one big trial bless god we god
[1:32:27] over it we won't have no more we're on
[1:32:30] our road to the promised land
[1:32:32] and he led them right out into the
[1:32:34] desert
[1:32:35] where there's no water
[1:32:38] could you imagine god
[1:32:41] with it with this sanctified holy people
[1:32:44] led them right out in this trap then got
[1:32:47] them out of that trap and led them right
[1:32:50] out here where there's no water
[1:32:53] when he could have took them some way
[1:32:55] where there was water why he could just
[1:32:58] made a river all the way along
[1:33:02] if he wanted to
[1:33:03] he could have broke every mountain into
[1:33:06] joy spurting water 50 feet in the air if
[1:33:09] you wanted to sure he could
[1:33:12] but if he'd done that it had been too
[1:33:14] easy
[1:33:16] oh i like that
[1:33:18] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:33:21] why did god let this happen brother
[1:33:23] branham
[1:33:26] so now maybe they're asking him brother
[1:33:28] branham
[1:33:29] why did god let this happen
[1:33:33] why did god
[1:33:35] god is doing that
[1:33:37] let him alone
[1:33:39] just walk on
[1:33:41] that's god's business
[1:33:43] the footprints of the righteous are
[1:33:46] ordered by the lord
[1:33:48] yes sir what difference does it make
[1:33:52] lost all my money brother branham
[1:33:55] well bless god anyhow
[1:33:57] oh i did this and this happened storm
[1:34:00] blowed away my house
[1:34:02] bless god anyhow the lord give the lord
[1:34:05] taken away blessed be the name of the
[1:34:08] lord
[1:34:09] just keep walking on it's all the glory
[1:34:13] of god god knows what he's doing
[1:34:16] some through the water
[1:34:19] some through the flood
[1:34:21] some through deep trial but all through
[1:34:24] the blood
[1:34:26] some through the deserts
[1:34:30] some through
[1:34:31] the rain forest
[1:34:34] some through the mountains
[1:34:36] but really all through the blood
[1:34:42] that's the way he leads them that's
[1:34:44] right oh my i feel like i could just
[1:34:48] stop and scream
[1:34:50] that's the way he leads his dear
[1:34:52] children
[1:34:54] oh can you just feel now i'm not a
[1:34:56] psychologist
[1:34:58] but can you just feel that lovely spirit
[1:35:00] now bathing over the building
[1:35:03] what if our eyes would come open just
[1:35:06] now
[1:35:07] and look what is standing
[1:35:09] around the sides of these walls
[1:35:12] up and down these aisles
[1:35:25] i believe that as a child of god
[1:35:29] you will go through desert experiences
[1:35:32] you will go through desert places in
[1:35:34] your life
[1:35:39] there is going to be times
[1:35:43] that it seems the water's been cut off
[1:35:45] it feels real dry
[1:35:47] feels real lonely
[1:35:51] it's very vast
[1:35:53] feels
[1:35:54] like where's the end
[1:35:59] but that's god doing that
[1:36:02] that's god taking you into that place
[1:36:06] like he's brought so many others
[1:36:12] he's got a purpose for it
[1:36:16] maybe it's to make you sweeter maybe
[1:36:18] it's to display who he is to you
[1:36:23] maybe it's to show you
[1:36:26] that
[1:36:27] you
[1:36:28] you think that you're
[1:36:30] you're capable
[1:36:32] of providing for your family that you're
[1:36:35] you've got things under control and he
[1:36:38] just wants you to know
[1:36:41] i've got things under control
[1:36:44] it's me
[1:36:54] no child of god can call themselves a
[1:36:56] child of god without a backside of the
[1:36:59] desert experience
[1:37:03] how can we call ourselves a christian
[1:37:08] if we're not like christ
[1:37:11] and if christ himself
[1:37:14] went through desert experiences
[1:37:19] then so us must we
[1:37:22] and god help us that when we're in a
[1:37:25] desert time in our life and perhaps
[1:37:27] you're not perhaps you say oh no
[1:37:30] um i was in one but i'm out of that now
[1:37:33] thank god i i'm up on a mountain i can
[1:37:36] see around
[1:37:37] well
[1:37:38] but if you've ever been in one
[1:37:41] then you know when
[1:37:42] how to pray how to enter in when
[1:37:44] somebody else is in one
[1:37:46] and if you've not been in one get ready
[1:37:49] you will be
[1:37:51] you will go through that as a child of
[1:37:53] god god there are times that god needs
[1:37:57] to get alone with you
[1:38:01] as an individual as a husband as a wife
[1:38:05] as a child
[1:38:06] as a young person as an old person
[1:38:09] though you may have been with him time
[1:38:11] after time he may need an even closer
[1:38:15] more intimate walk with you than he's
[1:38:17] ever had before
[1:38:20] and he may introduce the desert into
[1:38:22] your life again
[1:38:28] and when i read this
[1:38:30] in hebrews
[1:38:32] chapter
[1:38:33] 3 brother branham saying this and how
[1:38:35] that he said god loves to do it
[1:38:38] i thought well
[1:38:40] we read earlier if he likes it then i
[1:38:43] like it the things that he likes i want
[1:38:46] to like because it's if he's in here and
[1:38:49] he likes it then i want to like it too
[1:38:52] and i want to be able to when i'm in a
[1:38:55] desert moment in my life i want to not
[1:38:58] be able to say why lord but oh god what
[1:39:01] have you got for me here
[1:39:05] lord i want to love this time with you
[1:39:07] alone
[1:39:09] and and maybe that means that i've got
[1:39:12] to say no to some dinner parties maybe
[1:39:15] that means that i've got to say uh you
[1:39:18] know i need to go home i need to go get
[1:39:21] a loan maybe we need to actually go
[1:39:23] physically get out into the desert and
[1:39:26] find a rock and find the shady spot and
[1:39:28] go get alone with god and talk to him
[1:39:32] but during those times when it seems so
[1:39:35] dry when it seems so vast and so lonely
[1:39:38] god help me to say lord i i like it
[1:39:42] right here
[1:39:43] to be alone with you
[1:39:45] god bless you tonight i wonder if we
[1:39:47] could stand together
[1:39:51] the musicians would come play something
[1:39:54] softly
[1:39:56] i'd like to pray with you
[1:39:59] and i'd just ask with every
[1:40:02] head bowed in every eye closed
[1:40:05] if you're in a desert condition in your
[1:40:07] life right now you feel very dry like
[1:40:09] the water's been shut off
[1:40:15] and you've wondered
[1:40:18] why or
[1:40:19] how long
[1:40:21] is this gonna last
[1:40:23] and you'd like to just
[1:40:27] lift your hand to god and say god i'm
[1:40:29] i'm in a dry time in my life
[1:40:32] but while i'm in this dry time
[1:40:38] god would you speak to me personally
[1:40:41] you'd just like to slip your hand up to
[1:40:42] him
[1:40:43] god bless you
[1:40:45] he chained god bless each of you god
[1:40:48] sees your hand
[1:40:55] precious lord
[1:40:56] [Music]
[1:40:59] forgive the lord your servant
[1:41:02] for lord if it wasn't brought out
[1:41:06] properly or lord as
[1:41:08] thoroughly as it could have been
[1:41:12] but lord we all can look into this word
[1:41:15] and
[1:41:16] we all hear these words from your
[1:41:19] servant prophet
[1:41:23] god our everything within our heart says
[1:41:25] that's so true
[1:41:27] that is so true
[1:41:32] god we can begin to relate to all these
[1:41:34] different ones that were called into
[1:41:36] these desert places
[1:41:42] god we've seen so many times that you've
[1:41:45] kept your word you have been jehovah
[1:41:48] jireh
[1:41:50] lord you've provided so many times for
[1:41:53] us even in the dry times of our life god
[1:41:56] there came a time where
[1:42:01] lord you would open the waters again and
[1:42:03] you would then
[1:42:04] begin to refresh us
[1:42:09] lord we would feel that presence of the
[1:42:11] lord and be so cool and refreshing
[1:42:14] [Music]
[1:42:17] and lord we thank you for that we thank
[1:42:20] you for being faithful

[1:42:32] those hearts

[1:42:36] hands didn't go up but their heart was
[1:42:38] crying out god i'm in a dry time of life

[1:42:46] individually
[1:42:48] that one-on-one god you would meet them
[1:42:52] lord perhaps that place would be in
[1:42:54] their closet lord maybe it'd be in their

[1:43:29] wings
[1:43:32] lord jesus

[1:48:21] you know sometimes it's not god
[1:48:24] it's us
[1:48:25] not letting him do what he wants to do
[1:48:30] i remember a time his brother
[1:48:33] reggie talked about being out there with
[1:48:36] two bottles of water that was a group of
[1:48:38] us young brothers
[1:48:39] went out on a hunting trip
[1:48:42] about 45 minutes out of town not too far
[1:48:46] on the last day we went friday i think
[1:48:48] just friday saturday saturday afternoon
[1:48:50] we out went out one more last time
[1:48:52] everybody went their own direction
[1:48:55] and each one of us either had a canteen
[1:48:57] or a bottle of water and we drank it all
[1:49:01] we all get back to the campsite
[1:49:03] and each one of us to ask the other one
[1:49:05] do you have any water left
[1:49:07] there was not a drop of water
[1:49:09] in any one of our canteens or any of our
[1:49:12] bottles
[1:49:14] we are 45 minutes from tucson but we
[1:49:16] felt like we were lost
[1:49:21] the next time we went hunting we had
[1:49:23] enough water to put out a forest fire
[1:49:26] [Music]
[1:49:28] but i still remember that moment of
[1:49:30] realizing nobody in the camp had water
[1:49:34] and we felt so what are we going to do
[1:49:38] but if we put out our cup and say here's
[1:49:40] my cup lord
[1:49:43] there's a song i was looking
[1:49:45] i remembered and it said springs of
[1:49:47] living water
[1:49:48] but right next to it
[1:49:50] the next song was how long has it been
[1:49:54] since you talked to the lord
[1:49:57] i don't know if you have the words to
[1:49:58] that there brother peter in there
[1:50:02] how long has it been since you talked to
[1:50:04] the lord
[1:50:06] and you told him
[1:50:08] [Music]
[1:50:11] how long
[1:50:14] has it been
[1:50:17] since you
[1:50:19] talked with
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:33] how long
[1:50:36] since you prayed
[1:50:38] how long

[1:51:25] since you knew
[1:51:28] that he
[1:51:29] cared for
[1:51:35] how long
[1:51:38] has it been
[1:51:40] since you now

[1:58:32] when god is called and his broader
[1:58:34] brother out
