[12:33] Praise the Lord.
[12:38] He had a lot of forgiveness to forgive
[12:41] me.
[12:43] I'm just so glad that he paid that price
[12:46] at Calvary. That we could be together,
[12:49] united as a family in Christ, [music]
[12:51] united as a as a church body in this
[12:54] corner of Tucson in the 21st century,
[12:58] the closing days of the year 2025.

[13:04] He still pulls us in. He still draws us
[13:07] together.

[13:09] &gt;&gt; Got a couple of prayer requests this
[13:11] morning. Uh this one from Sister Amelia.
[13:14] Please keep my grandson in your prayers.
[13:17] He has an appointment for an interview
[13:19] for a job tomorrow.
[13:21] Ask that the Lord's perfect will be
[13:23] done. God bless you all.
[13:26] Another prayer. You may have noticed our
[13:27] sister Hope Buckles, who's always here,
[13:29] isn't here this morning. She's playing
[13:31] piano uh for another church this morning
[13:33] whose musicians are absent. and [music]
[13:35] she asked for our prayers and help from
[13:38] the Lord.
[13:40] There's a number of our young people
[13:41] that are going to a youth meeting in
[13:43] Michigan this week. They must really
[13:46] want to go to leave here at this time of
[13:48] year to go to Michigan. Maybe they want
[13:50] to see if there's anybody left in
[13:51] Michigan that's not causing a traffic
[13:53] jam here in Tucson. I'm not sure. But we
[13:56] want to pray for them and uphold them
[13:58] that the Lord will really bless them at
[13:59] that youth camp. And finally, when we
[14:01] take up the offering this morning, the
[14:04] offering is going to Durban, South
[14:05] Africa to a mission work that we're
[14:07] helping sponsor there. Uh, Brother
[14:09] Daniel will be talking a little bit more
[14:11] about that. So, so keep that in mind
[14:13] this morning. And let's just join our
[14:15] hearts together in prayer before the
[14:17] Lord. Lord Jesus, we're so grateful we
[14:20] have an opportunity to gather together,
[14:23] Lord, on this last Sunday morning of
[14:25] December of 2025,
[14:28] Lord, to join our hearts together, Lord,
[14:30] to to just worship you, to let you know
[14:32] that we love you and how much we
[14:34] appreciate what you've done for each one
[14:36] of us, Lord Jesus. Again, we thank you
[14:39] for being here this morning. We pray
[14:41] your presence continue here. anoint our
[14:43] pastor as he speaks, Lord, and just draw
[14:46] us all closer together in unity and in
[14:48] love. Bless the offering as it's taken
[14:51] this morning that it could help in that
[14:52] work in South Africa, draw souls to you,
[14:55] Lord. We thank you in Jesus [music]
[14:57] precious, almighty, and wonderful name.

[26:49] souls as he can. We have a deadline,
[26:52] friends. We don't know when the deadline
[26:54] is, but you know, when you're studying
[26:55] in school, you have a deadline to get
[26:57] all your all of your homework in, your
[26:59] exams in, and that type of thing. When
[27:01] you're at work, you have a deadline to
[27:03] get to accomplish the task that you're
[27:06] given. We have a deadline. It's called
[27:09] the second coming of Christ. We don't
[27:11] know when it is, but we got to get
[27:13] everything done before that happens.
[27:15] Brother Lyle, you prayed the other day.
[27:17] I really appreciated it. He said, "Thank
[27:19] the Lord that we that we have another
[27:22] day to win souls to Christ before that
[27:26] coming. We don't know when he's coming,
[27:28] but we know that the time is short and
[27:31] we want to get as many people to him as
[27:34] humanly as not even humanly. I tell you
[27:37] what, when you receive the Holy Spirit,
[27:39] human has nothing to do with it.
[27:41] as many as the Lord has ordained to come
[27:43] in is what we want to get. Brother
[27:45] Steven is working on that. So, what they
[27:47] did is they had a an outreach meeting. I
[27:51] asked the church to pray for it. Um they
[27:54] rented a tent. And one thing that's
[27:56] important and it's it's always been
[27:59] important. It was important to Jesus
[28:01] when Jesus had the multitudes out before
[28:05] him and he was preaching them to them
[28:08] food.
[28:10] they needed to feed the people and
[28:12] that's important. So what one of part of
[28:15] the this outreach was feeding those that
[28:18] came and and people in South Africa
[28:21] probably have a little bit more
[28:22] appreciate they're more appreciative of
[28:24] receiving a meal maybe than we here in
[28:26] the United States are. And when Jesus
[28:29] was there a little boy with his lunch he
[28:32] brought that in and the Lord took it and
[28:34] we know the story. He multiplied it. It
[28:36] was important. It was important to him.
[28:38] So if we could So that was part of you
[28:40] put up the first picture and having this
[28:43] outreach. So they're just they're
[28:45] handing out food to to those the the
[28:48] passers by and well not the pastors by
[28:50] but those that would would come in. And
[28:52] we have a couple pictures of that. Go
[28:54] ahead. And some of the volunteers there.
[28:59] Very good. Very good. And then this one
[29:03] just bless my heart. There's a lot of
[29:04] poor people in Durban as there are
[29:07] really all over the world. And that
[29:10] lady,
[29:12] we can give her a meal today, but she's
[29:15] going to get hungry again later on. But
[29:18] if we can truly introduce her to a
[29:21] living Jesus Christ, then that food that
[29:25] she eats, she'll never hunger again.
[29:27] Remember the woman at the well and how
[29:29] she was there with Jesus and and they
[29:32] were talking back and forth. And Jesus
[29:35] says that I will give you water that you
[29:37] will never thirst again. And then what
[29:40] did she say? She said, "Lord, give me
[29:43] that water."
[29:45] And then she went, she dropped her water
[29:46] pot. The water wasn't important. The
[29:48] natural water wasn't important anymore.
[29:50] And then she went and started testifying
[29:52] about this man, Jesus Christ, a man that
[29:54] had told her what she had done. And
[29:56] really, a man that could take away her
[29:59] sins. So here we have that. And I just
[30:02] pray that this lady right here would
[30:04] have received something that would
[30:07] change her life and set her on the right
[30:09] path. Then I wanted to show a couple
[30:13] videos. Here's here's the congregation
[30:16] that I believe that was Sunday. Um it
[30:19] was a Friday, Saturday, Sunday meeting.
[30:22] Here's um those that showed up for the
[30:24] ministering. And I wanted to show a we
[30:27] need to know this guy. were were giving
[30:29] him money to continue on with this
[30:32] ministry. I wanted to show a short clip
[30:34] of him preaching. If you could go to the
[30:36] next video, this is brother Steven Young
[30:39] &gt;&gt; for their insurance. Why? Because the
[30:42] wages of SIN IS DEATH. THERE'S A WAY
[30:44] THAT SEEMTH RIGHT
[30:47] THERE IS DEATH.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; THE PAYMENT THAT YOU GET for sin is you
[30:51] leaving you from the wrong tree. That
[30:54] choice THAT WAS BEFORE ADAM, LIFE AND
[30:56] DEATH, blessing and cursing is the
[30:58] choice standing before every person HERE
[31:00] TODAY.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; GOD, WHAT DID GOD DO TO HIS FAMILY THERE
[31:04] IN THE GARDEN? You know, just like every
[31:06] responsible father wants to, every
[31:08] responsible parent, you want your you
[31:10] want to make your home a safe haven for
[31:12] your children.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; I I I teach my children. I correct them.
[31:16] And I shall show them. I give them THE
[31:18] WORD OF GOD.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, that was brother Stephen. And
[31:23] then another brother that uh has
[31:28] befriended our f our brother here and as
[31:31] a pastor of a church, he has also
[31:34] saying, "Hey, I want to get in on this.
[31:35] I want to help you out with this. And if
[31:37] we could go to the next video and that's
[31:39] this Indian brother in South Africa
[31:41] preaching
[31:45] to come and he loved us so much that
[31:49] through the Bible tells us that
[31:52] While we were yet sinners, Christ
[31:54] commended his love toward us. WHILE WE
[31:57] WERE YET SINNERS, CHRIST DIED FOR US. IN
[31:59] OUR SIN,
[32:01] Christ loved us so much.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; That he came and he provided a way of
[32:06] escape.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; He provided those living waters that we
[32:10] can drink and we can thirst no more.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God for the work that they're
[32:17] doing. [applause]
[32:22] As I've said before, we'll continue to
[32:24] support it as low long as the Lord is
[32:26] blessing it and as long as the they're
[32:28] on the straight path, I want to continue
[32:30] with this work. U we've been going
[32:33] through the sermon on the mount and it's
[32:35] been just to me, I say it every time
[32:39] that we get into this, it's the greatest
[32:41] sermon ever preached.
[32:43] It's starts with the biatitudes and how
[32:46] those who believe Christ
[32:49] and how how to give your heart to the
[32:51] Lord and then it goes to now once you
[32:53] believe then you are the the light of
[32:56] the world. You all the are the salt of
[32:58] the earth and don't hide your testimony.
[33:01] Let your let your light shine to all
[33:04] men. And then Jesus says he says don't
[33:08] get me wrong. He says, "I didn't come
[33:09] away come to do away with Moses and his
[33:12] teaching." He says, "I came to fulfill
[33:15] it."
[33:16] And then he says, "Now, now you people
[33:20] that were listening to him, not the
[33:21] ministers,
[33:23] he says, except your righteousness
[33:27] exceeds
[33:29] the righteousness of the scribes and
[33:31] Pharisees, you will in no wise enter
[33:32] into the kingdom." What a what a hard
[33:35] saying. Except you,
[33:39] your righteousness exceeds these ones
[33:41] that have been groomed for their whole
[33:43] life to minister,
[33:46] you have to exceed their righteousness.
[33:49] And then he he he says that you have
[33:51] heard it said that you shall not murder.
[33:53] Now, here's what Jesus is doing. He
[33:54] starts working on the heart of man. He
[33:56] says he says, "You've heard it said that
[33:58] you're not you you shall not murder."
[33:59] One of the ten commandments. He says,
[34:02] "But if you are angry at someone that
[34:06] you're in danger of judgment for
[34:08] murder."
[34:10] He says that you have heard it said that
[34:11] you shall not commit adultery, but if
[34:13] you just look at a woman with lust, then
[34:18] you are guilty of adultery. He said,
[34:21] "Don't swear." He said, "But let every
[34:24] word you say be truthful." So there's no
[34:27] need to put your hand on the Bible and
[34:30] swear. Let everything that you say be
[34:34] right and truthful. Live a clean and
[34:38] holy and peaceable life.
[34:42] He said to love your enemies and pray
[34:44] for those who persecute you. Be
[34:46] different than the world. Everybody who
[34:49] who everybody loves those all of us. We
[34:52] we all love those who love us, right?
[34:54] That's easy. Jesus is like, "Well, even
[34:56] the sinners do that." He said, "But you
[35:00] love those who hate you.
[35:03] Love those who despitefully use you."
[35:06] You see, Jesus is raising the bar. He
[35:09] said to watch out. He said, he said,
[35:11] "Don't do your good deeds publicly
[35:16] to be admired by other people."
[35:19] He says, "Because if you do that,
[35:22] you have your reward because that's what
[35:24] you wanted. You wanted everybody to see
[35:26] you, but you lose your reward in heaven
[35:29] because you do that. He said to pray in
[35:31] secret and then your father father will
[35:33] reward you openly. But if you pray and
[35:36] you fast and you try to draw attention
[35:38] to yourself, you have your reward.
[35:41] You want people to know. So you have it.
[35:43] And then this sermon
[35:45] really on the it's it is the deepest
[35:50] really sermon that had ever been
[35:52] preached to that point. He tells us how
[35:54] to pray.
[35:56] And he says, he says, 'Pray pray like
[35:58] this. He says,"Our Father, who art in
[36:01] heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[36:04] kingdom come, thy will be done in earth
[36:07] as it is in heaven." Listen to those
[36:08] words. You want God's will to be done
[36:11] over yours. Give us this day our daily
[36:14] bread. We're going to be talking about
[36:15] that today.
[36:16] And forgive us of our debts as we
[36:20] forgive those
[36:22] our debtors. and lead us not into
[36:24] temptation,
[36:26] but deliver us from evil. For thine is
[36:28] the kingdom and the power and the glory
[36:30] forever. Tells us how to pray. And then
[36:35] he continues on.
[36:38] And the difference really
[36:41] between Jesus's ministry and all the
[36:44] ministry that had come to that point is
[36:47] Jesus was working on the inner man, the
[36:51] inner woman. He was working on the heart
[36:55] and not working on the outside, which
[36:58] was the Bible up until that point.
[37:00] Follow these rules, do these things. But
[37:01] Jesus was saying, "No, it's a deeper
[37:03] it's deeper than that. Here's what it is
[37:05] that this spirit that's that needs that
[37:09] of God, it needs to live inside of you.
[37:13] Then it's perfect. Then every decision
[37:16] you make, you're not going back to a
[37:17] rule book. You're making this decision
[37:19] based on how the Holy Spirit leads you
[37:21] in every way. He was working on the
[37:24] heart. Brother Random said one time, he
[37:26] said that there was a meeting
[37:31] and a choice was given to Jesus and a
[37:36] choice was given to Satan.
[37:38] What part of mankind do you want?
[37:44] What aspect of human nature do you want?
[37:48] Satan
[37:50] chose the mind.
[37:53] Jesus chose the heart in this sermon on
[37:57] the mount. It is working on the heart of
[37:59] a man because that heart is where your
[38:02] soul resides. That heart is what's
[38:04] important. The mind things get in our
[38:07] minds and and cause all kinds of
[38:08] problems and we're going to be talking
[38:10] about anxiety today. Causes us anxiety
[38:12] and causes us doubt, causes us worry.
[38:15] But when we truly get down into the
[38:17] heart, then that's how we can truly
[38:20] trust God.
[38:25] Satan really chose understanding.
[38:28] Jesus chose love.
[38:31] You don't love in your mind, friends.
[38:33] There's just something in your heart.
[38:34] Think about your love for your children,
[38:37] your love for your parents, love for
[38:39] those ones that are really close to you.
[38:42] It doesn't come up here. There's just
[38:44] something inside of you that loves that
[38:46] person. And that's what Jesus, he chose
[38:48] that love because that's where the power
[38:50] is. John said, "God is love." But in the
[38:54] mind, Solomon said, "Don't lean to your
[38:56] own understanding." That can be false.
[38:58] That can be that can that can be um it
[39:02] can be impersonated from Satan. It And
[39:06] don't put it past him to do it. Satan's
[39:10] very powerful. But there's something
[39:12] about a man's heart, a woman's heart,
[39:15] that that love comes up. You just you
[39:17] can't fake it. It's just it's there.
[39:20] Then in the second half of chapter 6,
[39:23] Jesus talks about something that every
[39:26] one of us
[39:28] really in this building we deal with on
[39:31] a daily basis. He talks about money and
[39:33] he talks about wealth.
[39:35] He uh he tells us that our mind should
[39:38] be prioritizing
[39:40] investing in eternal things and not
[39:43] earthly things.
[39:45] Before I get into the scriptures, um I
[39:49] want to tell the congregation that I uh
[39:52] I really do I understand anxiety and I
[39:56] understand worry.
[39:58] A lot of times when we're talking with
[40:02] with people, we're talking about things
[40:03] of the Lord. We'll maybe talk about
[40:04] things that that we have that that are
[40:07] weaknesses in our lives. But it seems
[40:09] like we never really tell that one thing
[40:12] that really is the biggest weakness that
[40:15] we have because that's the thing that we
[40:18] kind of hide and maybe that we're
[40:20] ashamed of.
[40:22] And with me,
[40:25] I worry.
[40:27] And it's a it's a lack really that Jesus
[40:31] tells us you're going to hear. He's
[40:32] like, "Hey, you shouldn't be worrying
[40:34] because it's a lack of faith." Something
[40:36] that I I do. I mean, I will Daniel's
[40:40] out. I know the kid's like 20. He's 23
[40:43] years old. I will not go to sleep until
[40:45] he's home.
[40:47] I just I worry and and I worry about you
[40:51] all. Many of you will tell me to to pray
[40:55] for you with some of the problems that
[40:56] you have and then I start worrying.
[40:59] Still tell me I want to I want to pray
[41:02] about it. But I start worrying about you
[41:05] and it's it's it's in my mind. Lord, I
[41:07] hope I hope they're okay. I hope that
[41:09] they're getting through this. I hope
[41:10] that that that
[41:13] everything will will work out. And and
[41:16] there's many times and I have to say in
[41:18] my life and also in when I've been
[41:20] praying for others, I have no idea,
[41:22] Lord, how are you going to get this
[41:24] person out of this predicament that
[41:26] they're in?
[41:28] &gt;&gt; How are you going to fix this? And it's
[41:30] it's a weakness that I have because I I
[41:33] just I I struggle and and I see like,
[41:36] Lord, there's no way. But God's a way
[41:39] maker. We we hear that song. We we hear
[41:42] listen to that song and he is he can
[41:44] make a way. You imagine the Israelites
[41:47] coming to the Red Sea. There's an ocean
[41:48] here. They don't have anything to fight
[41:50] with. And then there's an army coming
[41:52] down here with chariots and and bows and
[41:54] arrows and swords and all that. And
[41:56] they're like, "How
[41:58] can we get out of this? They're coming
[42:00] here to kill us."
[42:02] And God parts the Red Sea. If he can
[42:04] part the Red Sea, he can get out of us
[42:05] out of the problems, out of the troubles
[42:07] that we have.
[42:09] Just put it into his hands.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Have faith in God.
[42:15] I'll give you some advice. All right.
[42:17] Pastor speaking. Don't worry about it.
[42:24] Brother Daniel, you are the smartest
[42:26] person in the world. Wow. I never
[42:29] thought of that. Oh, you know, is your
[42:31] pastor? He said, don't worry about it.
[42:35] You see my point?
[42:37] We worry
[42:39] and it's like, "Oh, well, somebody tells
[42:40] you not to worry about it, but you don't
[42:42] have my problems.
[42:44] You're not trying to make your bill this
[42:46] week and there's no way to do it. You're
[42:49] not suffering with cancer or whatever
[42:50] the sickness might be. You're not in my
[42:53] position, brother or sister. Tell me not
[42:56] to worry.
[42:57] You're not suffering with what I'm
[42:59] suffering."
[43:01] But we're going to hear pretty soon,
[43:02] Jesus said not to worry. And there's a
[43:05] reason he said it.
[43:08] Brother Stephen, you saw him there.
[43:12] And uh, Brother Steven's in a tough
[43:14] spot.
[43:16] He is called to the ministry. You can
[43:19] see he's a good preacher. He's very
[43:20] good. He's a gift of ministering.
[43:23] And he knows that's his calling. And he
[43:26] knows what he has to do. But he doesn't
[43:28] know how the Lord is going to provide
[43:31] him monetarily for his his living. He
[43:35] he's he's really dependent every week on
[43:39] the Lord. How is the Lord going to
[43:40] provide? He only has he had a few weeks
[43:43] ago. He's got he's got a few more now,
[43:44] but he had 12 people in his
[43:46] congregation.
[43:48] Can't can't do it like that. And he's
[43:52] he's trusting in the Lord. Brother
[43:54] Steven had to uh he had to get his
[43:57] children registered for school and uh
[44:01] the tuition for the semester is a
[44:03] thousand rand which is about 60 bucks.
[44:07] And he was, you know, he he was able to
[44:09] to get the money together for his his
[44:11] children.
[44:13] And as he was there, he was at the
[44:15] school and he saw a woman
[44:19] that kept going up to to the the school
[44:23] board or whatever it was the the people
[44:24] there and he could tell that he was that
[44:29] she was trying to get her child in to
[44:31] the school, but you needed the the 60
[44:36] bucks to really grease the skids to get
[44:38] them in. and she would go up and and she
[44:41] was upset and she would come back down
[44:43] and and as brother Steven's a Christian
[44:46] man and he was watching this going on
[44:50] and
[44:51] he walked up to the people there that
[44:55] were in authority and he said, "Listen,
[44:58] I'm a pastor." He said, "Um, this woman,
[45:01] she she can't she can't pay the the
[45:04] money to get her child in school." And I
[45:07] said, "No." He said, "I want to pay it."
[45:10] And he he didn't have the money. He had
[45:13] enough to do it. And and he says, "I
[45:15] want to I want to do it for her." So
[45:18] they said, "Okay." And he he um he gets
[45:21] her in. He he gets the child in and she
[45:24] comes to him and she says, "I've never
[45:28] had anyone do anything like that for me.
[45:30] Her name's Cynthia."
[45:33] And uh she said, you know, there's not
[45:37] the the father's not in the picture. She
[45:39] said, "We've been pretty much
[45:40] abandoned." And and she makes
[45:44] a,000 rand
[45:47] a month.
[45:49] And no, I'm sorry. She makes uh she
[45:51] makes Yeah, she makes a thousand rand a
[45:54] month, which is 60 bucks. Now, South
[45:58] Africa isn't like you might think. It's
[46:01] still things are expensive there. So
[46:04] this [snorts] this tuition is a whole
[46:06] month's salary for her. And Stephen, he
[46:09] didn't have the money either, but he he
[46:11] had enough and he he says, "Well, I'll
[46:13] help with this." So he gives gives that
[46:15] to her and she was just taken back.
[46:16] There was no chance that she would ever
[46:18] be able to have her child in school. And
[46:22] she just like said, "Brother," she said,
[46:25] "Sir, I have no idea no idea why you
[46:28] would do something like this." He showed
[46:30] her love. He reached out. So what did
[46:32] she do? She says, "You're a pastor." She
[46:34] says, "I want to come to your church."
[46:36] You can imagine if you have people like
[46:38] that in your church.
[46:41] I want to be part of that. I want to
[46:44] have that same spirit that you have. So
[46:48] she um she starts coming to church and
[46:51] and she was it was so so sweet the first
[46:54] time she comes. She says, "Well,
[46:56] pastor," she says, "forgive us by the
[46:58] way that we're dressed."
[47:00] She said, "I I'm I'm sorry. I didn't I
[47:04] don't mean any disrespect." And and he
[47:06] said, "No." He says, "You come He said,
[47:08] "Come to the come to our church." He
[47:11] says, "I don't care how you look." He
[47:12] says, "You come in here and you hear the
[47:16] word of God." And she starts coming and
[47:18] she says she says, "We are members of
[47:22] your church."
[47:24] And she she just was taken back that how
[47:27] a Christian could be so giving.
[47:30] And
[47:33] I wanted to read a scripture that says
[47:35] this. Second Corinthians
[47:38] says this. But this I say, he who sows
[47:41] sparingly will also reap sparingly. And
[47:43] he who sws bountifully will also reap
[47:46] bountifully. So let each one give as he
[47:49] purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or
[47:52] of necessity. You don't give because
[47:55] you're supposed to give.
[47:57] For God loves a cheerful giver.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; And God is able to make all grace abound
[48:03] toward you that you always having all
[48:05] sufficiency in all things may have an
[48:08] abundance for every good work. You have
[48:11] an abundance for what? Not for yourself,
[48:13] but for every good work. It is written,
[48:17] "He has dispersed abroad. He has given
[48:20] to the poor. His righteousness endures
[48:22] forever."
[48:24] It's a little family
[48:26] got their tuition paid. But more
[48:28] importantly, by the generation of the
[48:30] pastor,
[48:32] they saw the love of Christ. They saw a
[48:35] true Christian. And then there's a
[48:38] really cool twist of the story. So
[48:41] Stephen tells me this on Friday.
[48:44] Um what he didn't know is
[48:48] as soon as I hung up with my brother
[48:50] Adam
[48:51] um he called. So I had just talked to my
[48:54] brother and my brother said he said hey
[48:57] Dan he says uh I want to I just feel in
[49:00] my heart I want to contribute to Stephen
[49:04] and the work that he's doing in South
[49:05] Africa and what which what you all are
[49:06] doing and sponsor him. He says he says I
[49:08] want to give
[49:10] and I said okay. I said, "How much? How
[49:13] much, you know, do you want to give?"
[49:14] And and Adam said, he said, "Uh, I'm
[49:20] sorry. I'm going to tell you how much he
[49:21] said." Um, he said, "I want to give a
[49:22] thousand bucks."
[49:25] And I said, "Okay, good. Um, I'll put it
[49:27] towards the work in South Africa."
[49:30] And then Stephen calls
[49:32] and he tells me this about the sister.
[49:34] And I said, "You know what, Stephen?"
[49:35] And I said, I said, uh, my brother just
[49:41] called me and he wants to give. And I
[49:42] said,
[49:44] I'm going to speak for him. And I know
[49:46] my brother Adam, he loves kids. He would
[49:49] do anything for any young person. I
[49:52] mean, he's just got a calling there. And
[49:53] Adam said, and I told him, I said, I'm
[49:56] going to speak for Adam, and he's going
[49:58] to pay your children's tuition and this
[50:01] lady's tuition for her daughter for the
[50:03] year.
[50:05] and he said, "Okay." So, I did the math
[50:08] and it's uh um 240
[50:13] times four, what's that? 960
[50:17] 960 bucks. And the tuition for all four
[50:22] of these children was
[50:25] um 900
[50:27] and $60. And then Adam gives a thousand.
[50:30] But I looked when he um when he made the
[50:33] deposit, when he made the offering,
[50:35] there's a fee for the $1,000, it was
[50:38] $970.
[50:40] So Adam was $10 more than than what they
[50:44] needed for their children, all of them.
[50:47] And it it goes to show that you may not
[50:50] think that you can do it. And whatever
[50:53] it is, whether it be financially or
[50:54] whether it be um anything, a job,
[50:57] whatever it is, you may not think that
[50:59] you can do it, but God has something in
[51:01] store.
[51:02] Can you imagine this lady? She had no
[51:05] way. That was a month's salary for just
[51:08] one semester. She had no way of getting
[51:11] her daughter into school, but she was
[51:14] there. And God had a servant that came
[51:16] down and provided it for her. and then
[51:19] had a God had a servant overseas in
[51:21] another place and he had a burden and
[51:24] provided it for the whole year.
[51:27] We should never worry. He's always there
[51:31] for us. And then when they're having
[51:33] these meetings,
[51:35] there was a there was a man that would
[51:38] work for Steven's former church. His
[51:41] name's Banda. And he was a very poor man
[51:46] from Malawi. and he had he had come
[51:48] there. He was trying to work in South
[51:50] Africa to send money to his family back
[51:52] home and extremely poor and he uh
[51:58] Stephen was always, you know, trying to
[52:00] give him a little bit of work. So he
[52:01] said, "Hey, we're we're getting this
[52:03] meeting together. You can come and you
[52:05] can help us set up and and we'll pay you
[52:07] for it." He says, "Okay." So he he comes
[52:10] and uh he uh around 70 years old and he
[52:16] he came and he worked and when they were
[52:21] serving lunch band sat over by himself
[52:23] because he was a servant. He was in the
[52:25] lower class. He's one of very poor
[52:27] people. He sits over by himself and
[52:30] Stephen
[52:32] sees him over there. Now now it's more
[52:35] segregated society there. Stephen goes
[52:37] over and sits down with him, which was,
[52:41] you know, not what you usually do. And
[52:44] he starts talking with him and and Banda
[52:47] is so touched in everything that's going
[52:49] on that when Stephen tried to pay him,
[52:53] he says, "No." He says, "I don't want
[52:55] anything. This is a man who needs it."
[52:57] And he says, "No, I don't want
[52:59] anything." He says, "I came here to go
[53:01] to church." And he says, "That's what
[53:04] I'm going to do." And then Banda after
[53:06] the services he says he says Stephen he
[53:09] says um
[53:11] I uh I'm going to start he says I'll get
[53:14] a I'll I'll get a taxi I'll take public
[53:17] transport to your house and I want to be
[53:21] with you every Sunday morning. He says I
[53:22] want to be with you every service. He
[53:24] says you just give me a ride to wherever
[53:26] you're meeting and he says I uh I'm part
[53:28] of your congregation. He's a seventh day
[53:30] Adventist
[53:32] that they would the church would help
[53:33] and and give him work. But now he's part
[53:37] he's part of the work because of
[53:39] Steven's kindness and also because of
[53:42] Bandit's kindness. You know, he gave his
[53:45] time. He gave his efforts to to make
[53:48] this a success. Wouldn't take anything
[53:50] for it. Martin of Tours. You probably
[53:53] heard this man's name, a famous man um
[53:57] in the mid 300s.
[54:00] He um brother Brandham called him the
[54:02] the third
[54:04] messenger
[54:06] to the Gentile dispensation.
[54:10] He he was a soldier. He had heard of the
[54:15] Lord Jesus and he was out on his b on
[54:17] his um horse and he was he it was a cold
[54:22] day. I believe they were in France and
[54:24] this homeless man, this beggar, he could
[54:28] see he was he was shivering in the cold.
[54:30] Martin takes off his soldier's coat and
[54:34] he cuts off
[54:36] half of the coat
[54:39] and he gives it. He had he had
[54:41] compassion on this man. He lays it
[54:45] around his shoulders and he says, "Now
[54:48] both of us can live through the night."
[54:50] And then the other soldiers made fun of
[54:51] him. He they said, "You look funny in
[54:53] half a coat."
[54:55] Then that night, Martin had a dream
[55:00] and he was this man, this beggar
[55:04] came to him. And this beggar was wrapped
[55:07] in the half of his coat that Martin gave
[55:09] him. And this be beggar in the dream was
[55:14] Jesus.
[55:16] And he he looked at him and this the
[55:20] Lord Jesus wrapped in the coat.
[55:23] He said, "Martin
[55:25] still a catechum."
[55:29] Which means Martin still not baptized.
[55:33] He still hasn't completed this this
[55:37] movement into Christianity. He said,
[55:39] "Martin, still not baptized,
[55:42] covered me
[55:44] in this cloak. And then he woke up and
[55:48] Martin was transformed that night. He
[55:51] decided
[55:53] to go to baptism, be baptized and
[55:56] consecrate his life to the Lord. And he
[55:58] did as much or more as anyone really who
[56:01] has ever lived to the gentile people.
[56:03] It's a it's a simple this simple gesture
[56:08] that Martin he did. It changed his life
[56:13] and Martin received the blessings.
[56:14] That's when he got his commission really
[56:16] to preach and and
[56:19] lead people to the Lord.
[56:21] Let's get into the scriptures. Let's get
[56:23] on to this sermon on the mount. Matthew
[56:26] chapter 6 verse 19.
[56:31] The Lord Jesus speaking
[56:34] to the multitudes of people
[56:37] on the side of the hill
[56:40] in Galilee by the Sea of the Sea of
[56:43] Galilee.
[56:46] He says this, Matthew 6:19, "Lay not up
[56:50] your t yourselves, lay not up for
[56:52] yourselves treasures upon earth, where
[56:53] moth and rust doth corrupt, and where
[56:56] thieves break through and steal, but lay
[56:58] up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
[57:00] where neither moth nor rust doth
[57:02] corrupt, and where thieves do not break
[57:04] in and steal.
[57:07] Lay up your treasures in heaven, not not
[57:09] store yourself." Treasures like Banda
[57:11] stored up when he helped with the
[57:13] crusade in in Durban. Treasures like
[57:16] Steven stored up when he helped the lady
[57:20] in the uh before the school board. Like
[57:22] Adam stored up when he helped the
[57:24] children in Durban. Treasures like we
[57:26] all we all stored up when we helped the
[57:29] family last week in the in the offering
[57:31] that way that we gave. The O'Hada family
[57:34] was able to have Christmas because of
[57:36] us, because of what we did, because of
[57:39] our generosity last week. They were
[57:41] behind in their vehicle payment, but
[57:43] they were able to to make that. And all
[57:46] because that they had done the right
[57:49] thing in taking on these extra children
[57:52] into the home and the Lord provided for
[57:55] them. Treasures like Martin of Tours
[57:58] when he stored up that he stored up when
[58:00] he gave his coat to this beggar so that
[58:03] that beggar could live.
[58:09] For where your treasure is, there will
[58:12] your heart be also. The light of the
[58:14] body is the eye. If therefore thine eye
[58:17] be single, thy whole body shall be full
[58:19] of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy
[58:21] whole body shall be full of darkness. If
[58:23] therefore the light that is in thee be
[58:25] darkness, how great is the darkness. New
[58:28] living translation of that says the eye
[58:30] is the lamp of the body. So if your eye
[58:33] is healthy, your whole body will be full
[58:36] of light. But if your eye is bad, your
[58:39] whole body will be full of darkness. If
[58:41] then the light in you is darkness, how
[58:44] great is that darkness?
[58:47] It's your focus is what Jesus is talking
[58:49] about. If your focus is wrong, then your
[58:52] whole life is going to be wrong. If your
[58:55] focus is on material things, then your
[58:58] whole life from finances to marriage to
[59:00] health to your walk with the Lord is
[59:02] going to suffer. No man can serve two
[59:05] masters, for either he will hate one and
[59:08] love the other, or else he will hold to
[59:10] the one and despise the other. You
[59:12] cannot serve God and mammon. That word
[59:15] mammon means material things.
[59:18] Jesus is saying that you have to focus
[59:22] on one or the other,
[59:25] God
[59:27] or material things. He's not saying that
[59:30] you shouldn't want to be successful, but
[59:32] he is saying he is trying to get us to
[59:37] question our motives in everything. Why
[59:39] am I doing this? Why am I going into
[59:42] this endeavor? What's the purpose? And
[59:45] the same question throughout the sermon
[59:47] on the mount really is what's in your
[59:49] heart.
[59:51] Is it to store up for yourself
[59:55] or is it to store up for God?
[1:00:00] Therefore I say unto you, take no
[1:00:03] thought for your life what you shall eat
[1:00:06] or what you shall drink, nor yet for
[1:00:08] your body what you shall put on. Is not
[1:00:11] the is not the life more than meat and
[1:00:15] the and the body than reignment? New
[1:00:17] King James Version says this, therefore
[1:00:19] I say to you, do not worry about your
[1:00:22] life.
[1:00:23] Remember I said don't worry. Now Jesus
[1:00:25] is saying don't worry. Means more coming
[1:00:28] from him than it does me. Don't worry
[1:00:30] about your life, what you will eat or
[1:00:32] what you will drink, nor about your
[1:00:34] body, what you will put put on. Is not
[1:00:36] life more than food and the body more
[1:00:39] than clothing? He says therefore. So he
[1:00:42] was just talking about money and about
[1:00:44] those things. Therefore means that he
[1:00:47] was talking about that and now he's
[1:00:49] referring back to that which is about
[1:00:52] storing up worldly things rather than
[1:00:54] heavenly things.
[1:00:57] Then after he says not to worry and he's
[1:01:00] making the statement is not life more
[1:01:03] than food and more than body and more
[1:01:05] than the clothes that you wear.
[1:01:08] Life is more. Our life, our our
[1:01:11] breathing is more than material things.
[1:01:14] Think about how much our lives revolve
[1:01:17] around what we eat,
[1:01:20] what we wear, what's in our bank
[1:01:21] account.
[1:01:24] I have this in my notes.
[1:01:27] Search yourself.
[1:01:29] Do you think more about what your about
[1:01:32] what your lunch is going to be or what
[1:01:35] you are wearing or how you are going to
[1:01:37] make the make the bills than the things
[1:01:40] of God?
[1:01:42] And that's the key here in our minds.
[1:01:45] Are we thinking more about how we're
[1:01:48] going to pay this bill? Are we thinking
[1:01:49] more about what we're going to eat
[1:01:51] later? Are we thinking more about the
[1:01:53] clothes that are wearing? Are we
[1:01:55] thinking more about the scriptures and
[1:01:57] more about prayer and more about those
[1:01:58] things? If you're thinking about what
[1:02:00] you're going to wear, if you're thinking
[1:02:02] about your bank account, if you're
[1:02:03] thinking about those things, then you
[1:02:05] are going to worry about those things.
[1:02:08] If you're thinking more about the things
[1:02:10] of God,
[1:02:12] more about the scriptures, more about
[1:02:14] giving, more about about doing the
[1:02:16] Lord's will, then your thoughts are
[1:02:18] going to be consumed with that. That's
[1:02:20] how you take worry out of the picture is
[1:02:23] you focus on the things of God. And then
[1:02:26] you have trust in the Lord. Lord, you
[1:02:28] know my heart. You know my heart's
[1:02:29] right. I know you're going to provide. I
[1:02:32] am your I am your your soldier like
[1:02:34] Martin was. The Lord will provide for
[1:02:37] you if you are in his will. And then you
[1:02:39] can have faith that he is going to
[1:02:41] provide. Are we giving more attention to
[1:02:45] food and drink and all of those things
[1:02:48] than we are to prayer and to searching
[1:02:50] the scripture?
[1:02:52] Now, the Lord Jesus gives us three
[1:02:54] examples
[1:02:55] of how we shouldn't worry. Behold the
[1:02:58] fowls of the air, for they sow not,
[1:02:59] neither do they reap, nor gathered in
[1:03:02] into into barns, yet your heavenly
[1:03:05] Father feedth them. Are you not much Are
[1:03:09] you not much better than they?
[1:03:13] I never saw a bird starving to death.
[1:03:17] You know, I haven't seen I haven't seen
[1:03:20] that. They have enough.
[1:03:22] They have They have what God provides
[1:03:26] and they're not worried about it now.
[1:03:29] They're not sitting there with their
[1:03:30] mouth open waiting for somebody to feed
[1:03:33] them when they when they get mature. we
[1:03:36] should work.
[1:03:38] Bible's not telling us not to work. The
[1:03:39] Bible's telling us to work. They work.
[1:03:41] They they try and and they do their
[1:03:43] their job, but God provides everything
[1:03:46] that they need. Which of you by taking
[1:03:49] thought can add one cubit to his
[1:03:50] stature. So, he's saying that really
[1:03:54] worry isn't doing any good. It's
[1:03:57] interesting. As I was looking through
[1:03:58] this, the English Standard Version has a
[1:04:01] bit of a different translation, which
[1:04:04] means the Greek is not really clear in
[1:04:08] this. English Standard Version in verse
[1:04:10] 27 says this, "And which of you by being
[1:04:14] anxious can add a single hour to a span
[1:04:17] of life?"
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; You're worried about being sick, you're
[1:04:22] not going to prolong your life. you're
[1:04:25] worried about your job, you're not it's
[1:04:26] not going to make your job better. Worry
[1:04:28] does nothing.
[1:04:31] Worry really and anxiety is a lack of
[1:04:33] faith. And Jesus is telling us that it
[1:04:35] does no good. And the truth of the
[1:04:38] matter is if we are worrying or we have
[1:04:40] anxiety, then we are placing more
[1:04:43] emphasis on the worldly things than we
[1:04:45] are on the things of God for the very
[1:04:48] fact that we're worrying about them.
[1:04:49] Bottom line is that
[1:04:53] if we're praying and in the scriptures
[1:04:56] and having faith in God, then we can
[1:04:58] walk forth by faith saying, "Lord, I
[1:04:59] know you're with me. I I know I know
[1:05:02] that that you're going to provide a
[1:05:04] way." And it's not just money. It's it's
[1:05:06] like young people and who you're going
[1:05:09] to marry.
[1:05:10] Lord, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[1:05:12] worrying and and sometimes the girls was
[1:05:14] like, "Oh, I'm 21 years old and I or 24
[1:05:17] years 25 years old or whatever." It's
[1:05:19] like, "Just chill out. The Lord has it
[1:05:22] in store. The Lord has a perfect one
[1:05:25] there for you. If if you have a of a
[1:05:28] desire to have the right one, God's
[1:05:30] going to send the right girl to you.
[1:05:32] He's going to send the right boy to you.
[1:05:34] Just have faith in him." The same thing
[1:05:37] with a job or you're working and you're
[1:05:38] trying, Lord, I don't know what my
[1:05:40] career is going to be. I I don't know
[1:05:42] how I'm going to support my family. Just
[1:05:44] keep trying. Keep moving and know that
[1:05:47] you are in the will of God. You are
[1:05:49] walking in a direction God is going to
[1:05:51] provide. He promised here. If he
[1:05:52] provides for the birds, then he can
[1:05:55] provide for us.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And why take ye thought for reignment?
[1:06:00] Consider the liies of the field. This is
[1:06:01] the second
[1:06:03] example. He says, "Consider the liies of
[1:06:06] the field. How they grow and they toil
[1:06:07] not, neither do they spend. But I say
[1:06:09] unto you that even Solomon in all of his
[1:06:11] glory was not arrayed like one of these.
[1:06:16] Saying that they're out there and it's
[1:06:18] probably the time of year they had grass
[1:06:19] on the on the hill and there was
[1:06:21] probably liies popping up there and he's
[1:06:23] Jesus probably looked down. He said,
[1:06:24] "Look at how beautiful this flower is.
[1:06:26] Do you think it's worried about if it's
[1:06:28] going to get enough water? You think
[1:06:29] it's worried about if it's going to get
[1:06:30] fertilizer?" No. It's a lily. God loves
[1:06:34] it. God placed it there. Wherefore if
[1:06:37] God so clothe the grass of the field,
[1:06:39] the third example,
[1:06:41] which today is and tomorrow is cast into
[1:06:44] the oven, shall he not much more clothe
[1:06:46] you, oh you of little faith?
[1:06:50] Saying, listen, there's grass
[1:06:51] everywhere. God provides this. Aren't
[1:06:54] you more important than the grass?
[1:06:57] I was
[1:06:59] um going up
[1:07:01] hunting uh years ago and I had my horse
[1:07:05] and what I was going to do is I was
[1:07:07] going to pack in a bunch of uh feed for
[1:07:09] the horse, a bunch of alpha alpha
[1:07:11] pellets. So, I uh I packed my horse into
[1:07:15] my camping place and the the week before
[1:07:19] and I had all the purs and stuff all
[1:07:21] full of these horse pellets and I got to
[1:07:24] my camp where it was going to be the
[1:07:25] following week and I dug a big hole and
[1:07:28] I put all probably I don't know 150
[1:07:32] pounds or so of pellets into this big
[1:07:34] hole and then I covered it up and that
[1:07:37] was going to be for my horse because I
[1:07:38] was going to be packing my tent and all
[1:07:40] of that. the next week when I was when I
[1:07:42] was going to be hunting. So, I I left
[1:07:45] and then I came back the next week and I
[1:07:47] come back to that hole
[1:07:50] where my alalfa pellets were
[1:07:53] and I looked at it and I got on my tent
[1:07:56] out and set up and everything and I was
[1:07:58] going to go get the horse and pellets
[1:07:59] and I I I pulled off the the wood that I
[1:08:01] had over it
[1:08:03] and they were all gone.
[1:08:06] Like two 150 pounds of pellets were
[1:08:08] gone. I was like, "Oh no, what am I
[1:08:11] going to feed my horse?"
[1:08:14] And it's like I kind of sat down. I was
[1:08:16] kind of I was worried. It's like, "What
[1:08:17] am I going to do? I'm like 10 miles in
[1:08:21] and I don't have feed for my horse. You
[1:08:23] know, she can eat grass, but she's going
[1:08:24] to get really skinny really quick on
[1:08:26] this stuff." So then I looked and there
[1:08:30] was a pellet
[1:08:32] outside the hole. I was like, "Hansel
[1:08:34] and Gretle."
[1:08:36] And there was another one. So, I start
[1:08:39] following this trail of pellets and I
[1:08:41] get to this tree
[1:08:44] and this dead tree and there's a hole in
[1:08:48] the tree and I shine my light in that
[1:08:51] hole and there's all of my pellets.
[1:08:53] Every one of them in that dead tree.
[1:08:56] This crazy little squirrel
[1:08:59] over the week's time he had stole all of
[1:09:02] my pellets and put them into his tree.
[1:09:06] I was like, "Wow, man." And I thought,
[1:09:08] well, you know what? The tree is a
[1:09:09] better place anyways. I'll just dip in
[1:09:11] there when my horse needs pellets. And
[1:09:14] and and this squirrel, he was just doing
[1:09:16] his job. Yeah, he didn't get to store up
[1:09:19] all of my alphalfpha pellets, but that
[1:09:21] wasn't for him anyways. He still had all
[1:09:23] of his acorns and everything. He still
[1:09:25] made it through the winter. My horse got
[1:09:28] its pellets. And I got a story to tell
[1:09:30] the church just saying that just do your
[1:09:32] work and the Lord will provide and work
[1:09:36] hard and he will.
[1:09:40] It was
[1:09:42] it was it was the coolest thing. It's
[1:09:45] like the little guy was working but when
[1:09:46] I stole his pellet he stole them first
[1:09:49] but when I took him back
[1:09:52] you know the little guy didn't miss a
[1:09:54] meal.
[1:09:55] You know he was all right. I'm sure
[1:09:57] there were some alpha alpha pellets down
[1:09:59] there that he got to eat, some left, but
[1:10:02] he made it through the winter just fine
[1:10:04] on his acorns and stuff that he was
[1:10:06] supposed to eat. He wasn't worried. The
[1:10:10] little squirrel didn't worry.
[1:10:12] God thinks more about us. He thought
[1:10:14] more about my horse and me, especially
[1:10:17] me, than he did the squirrel. Therefore,
[1:10:19] take no thought, saying, "What shall we
[1:10:21] eat or what shall we drink or or with
[1:10:23] wherewith all shall we be clothed? For
[1:10:25] after these things do the Gentiles seek,
[1:10:28] for your father, for your heavenly
[1:10:30] Father knoweth that you have need of all
[1:10:32] these things. The Gentiles were
[1:10:34] unbelievers. They were heathens. So he's
[1:10:36] saying that if you worry, then you
[1:10:38] really don't even know God.
[1:10:41] Correction from Jesus Christ on the
[1:10:45] sermon on the mount.
[1:10:47] Correction to me. If you're worried,
[1:10:50] then you don't even know God.
[1:10:53] The people that don't know God worry.
[1:10:56] You shouldn't.
[1:10:58] The birds,
[1:11:01] they're not worried. And they and the
[1:11:02] Lord feeds them. The little squirrel,
[1:11:04] he's not worried. He feeds them. You
[1:11:07] know, the the we see the wild flowers
[1:11:09] out here. They they come up out of
[1:11:10] nowhere. It's like, wow, here here they
[1:11:12] are again. And you wonder sometimes
[1:11:14] there's less, sometimes there's more.
[1:11:16] But God provides all the time.
[1:11:22] Do we not have enough faith to believe
[1:11:25] that he cares for us more than he does
[1:11:27] the flowers or that he cares for us more
[1:11:31] than he does the birds of the squirrels?
[1:11:33] He does care for us more. We just don't
[1:11:36] believe him.
[1:11:38] We really need to.
[1:11:41] But seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[1:11:43] his righteousness and all these things
[1:11:45] shall be added unto you.
[1:11:48] really concentrate on winning souls like
[1:11:50] our church is doing.
[1:11:53] Work hard like the birds are working
[1:11:55] hard and just grow in the sunlight, the
[1:11:58] sunlight of God. Just just take in what
[1:12:01] he's doing and then you everybody all of
[1:12:03] us do our part. Let our minds be on the
[1:12:05] things of God and give glory to God and
[1:12:08] testify as testify of his goodness. Read
[1:12:10] his word. Stay in prayer. Stay in study
[1:12:14] and then trust him.
[1:12:16] Take therefore no thought of the
[1:12:18] tomorrow, for the tomorrow shall take
[1:12:20] thought for the things of itself.
[1:12:22] Sufficient unto the day is the evil
[1:12:24] thereof.
[1:12:26] This last verse, Jesus is saying, don't
[1:12:29] live in the regrets of yesterday.
[1:12:33] And don't live in the worry of the
[1:12:37] future.
[1:12:38] You don't have any control over those
[1:12:40] things.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Concentrate on today and concentrate on
[1:12:43] the kingdom of God today.
[1:12:46] Really, the gospel, it's good news,
[1:12:49] friends. It's not bad news. You feel
[1:12:51] good when you hear the gospel. You
[1:12:53] shouldn't feel bad when you hear it. The
[1:12:55] word of God, it gives us hope. It
[1:12:57] doesn't give us anxiety. It doesn't give
[1:12:58] us worry. It takes away worry. It takes
[1:13:01] away those things.
[1:13:04] Brother Jerry Amalong, I wanted to
[1:13:06] mention him. Does any who knows or has
[1:13:10] known Brother Jerry Amalong?
[1:13:12] Missionary to Mexico. He and I were way
[1:13:15] down in the south of Mexico and we're
[1:13:17] eating
[1:13:18] um breakfast, I think. And uh I asked
[1:13:22] him, I said, I said, "Brother Amalong,
[1:13:24] so what what did you do? What have what
[1:13:27] have you done outside of missionary
[1:13:28] work?" And he told me, he says, "Brother
[1:13:30] Daniel, I've never done anything outside
[1:13:32] of this." He's lived his whole life.
[1:13:35] Brother Amalong has
[1:13:38] going to Mexico, feeding the people,
[1:13:41] bringing clothes down there, preaching
[1:13:42] the gospel to him. He's lived his whole
[1:13:45] life by faith that God's going to
[1:13:47] provide for him. And he always had. He
[1:13:49] always was able to pay his bills. He was
[1:13:51] always able to to take in enough to feed
[1:13:54] his family and and to provide for his
[1:13:57] family and yet never any other source of
[1:14:02] income. You talk about faith.
[1:14:05] living like that. Musicians can come and
[1:14:08] we'll close.
[1:14:10] Do you want to read
[1:14:13] an encouraging
[1:14:15] testimony or an encouraging um scripture
[1:14:21] that should help us to put away anxiety,
[1:14:25] put away a lack of faith?
[1:14:28] Psalm 23
[1:14:30] says, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[1:14:33] I shall not want. New Living Translation
[1:14:36] of that says, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[1:14:38] I have all I need." If he is our
[1:14:40] shepherd, of course we have all all we
[1:14:42] need. He maketh me to lie down in green
[1:14:44] pastures. He leadeth me beside the still
[1:14:46] waters. He restoreth my soul.
[1:14:50] He leadth me in the path of
[1:14:51] righteousness for his name's sake. Yay,
[1:14:53] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:14:55] shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[1:14:58] Why do we fear no evil?
[1:15:02] The shadow of death for us
[1:15:05] isn't necessarily with Philistines
[1:15:07] around us. The shadow of death is
[1:15:11] walking through life every day and
[1:15:13] wondering, "Lord, I don't know what to
[1:15:14] do about these things. I need help.
[1:15:18] Yay. Though I walk through the valley of
[1:15:20] the shadow of death, I will fear no
[1:15:21] evil. Why? Why do we fear no evil?
[1:15:23] Because thou art with me.
[1:15:27] Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."
[1:15:30] God's with us. And why should we fear?
[1:15:33] We shouldn't.
[1:15:35] Thou preparest a table for me before me
[1:15:38] in the presence of mine enemies. Thou
[1:15:41] anointest my head with o o with with
[1:15:42] oil. My cup runth over.
[1:15:47] No matter what situation we we are in.
[1:15:50] No matter if it's financial, no matter
[1:15:54] if it's spiritual problems, you can
[1:15:57] still say my cup runth o runth over.
[1:16:00] Why? Because Lord, you're with me.
[1:16:02] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:16:05] me all the days of my life
[1:16:08] and I will dwell in the house of the
[1:16:09] Lord forever.
[1:16:13] There's this man named Charles Tenley.
[1:16:17] He was his dad was a slave and his
[1:16:21] mother was free. So when he was born, he
[1:16:23] was free.
[1:16:25] And as he grew up, he wasn't allowed to
[1:16:29] go to school.
[1:16:30] So he got the alphabet and how each
[1:16:34] letter in the alphabet sounded. And
[1:16:36] every time he could find something that
[1:16:38] had words on it, he would sound it out.
[1:16:40] And he taught himself to read. And he
[1:16:43] taught himself to read the Bible.
[1:16:48] And as he is studying the Bible, he he
[1:16:50] loved he he had a call to the ministry.
[1:16:53] And they gave him a church to pastor. No
[1:16:57] education, no seminary background. They
[1:17:00] gave him a Methodist, a black Methodist
[1:17:02] church to pastor with 130 people in it.
[1:17:05] As he was preaching, the church started
[1:17:07] to grow and grow and it moved to another
[1:17:09] location. And pretty soon that one that
[1:17:12] 130 became 900. And then by the time of
[1:17:15] his death, that 130 became 10,000
[1:17:18] people in the Methodist church that he
[1:17:21] had led to the Lord.
[1:17:23] And here he is,
[1:17:26] a great songwriter.
[1:17:28] And there was a man that came to him in
[1:17:31] his congregation had a real problem.
[1:17:34] And one of those problems that I don't
[1:17:37] know exactly what it was, but one of
[1:17:39] those problems that you just think,
[1:17:40] Lord, how can you make a way here?
[1:17:45] And Charles
[1:17:47] gives advice to this man. He said, "Take
[1:17:51] your burdens."
[1:17:53] And he said, "Put them in a sack."
[1:17:57] And he said, "Take them to the Lord."
[1:17:59] And he said, "Leave them there."
[1:18:02] And he wrote this song. If the world
[1:18:05] from you withhold of its silver and its
[1:18:08] gold and you have to get along with
[1:18:11] meager fair, just remember in his word
[1:18:15] how he feeds the little bird, take your
[1:18:18] burden to the Lord and leave it there.
[1:18:23] If your body suffers pain and your
[1:18:26] health you can't regrain
[1:18:29] and your soul is almost sinking in
[1:18:31] despair. Jesus knows the pain you feel
[1:18:34] he can save and he can heal. Take your
[1:18:37] burden to the Lord and leave it there.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; When your enemies sail and your heart
[1:18:43] begins to fail. Don't forget that God in
[1:18:46] heaven answers prayer.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will make a way for you and he
[1:18:50] will lead you safely through. Take your
[1:18:53] burden to the Lord and leave it there.
[1:18:58] When your youthful days are gone
[1:19:00] and old age is stealing on
[1:19:04] and your body bends beneath the weight
[1:19:06] of care,
[1:19:09] he will never leave you then. He will go
[1:19:12] with you to the end. Take your burden to
[1:19:15] the Lord and leave it there. Inspired by
[1:19:19] a pastor who had a burden for someone in
[1:19:21] his congregation. A burden maybe he
[1:19:23] couldn't handle, but a burden that he
[1:19:26] knew someone who could. And that's our
[1:19:29] Lord Jesus the Messiah.
[1:19:33] Verse one. If the world from [singing]
[1:19:37] you withholds
[1:19:39] of its silver and its gold and you have
[1:19:45] to get [singing] along with me fair,
[1:19:52] just remember [music]
[1:19:54] [singing] in his word how he feeds the
[1:19:59] little.
[1:20:01] Take [music] your burden [singing]
[1:20:03] to the Lord and leave it there.

[1:20:44] If your body suffers pain and your

[1:22:43] he will surely bring you out. Take your
[1:22:48] burden to [singing] the Lord and leave
[1:22:52] [music] it there. Last verse.
[1:22:55] When your youthful days are gone and old
[1:23:00] age is stealing on and your body bends
[1:23:06] beneath [singing] the weight of care,
[1:23:11] he will [music] never [singing] leave
[1:23:14] you. Then he'll go with you [music] to
[1:23:18] the end. Take your burden to the Lord.
[1:23:25] Amen.
[1:23:26] [music]
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Leave it there.
[1:23:31] Leave [music] it there.
[1:23:35] Take your burdens to the Lord.
[1:23:43] If [music] you trust and never doubt, he
[1:23:48] will surely bring you out.
[1:23:52] Take your burden to [singing] the Lord.
[1:23:56] Leave it there.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand,
[1:23:59] friends,
[1:24:02] because I suffer with anxiety.
[1:24:07] I uh
[1:24:09] I don't know if many of you, if some of
[1:24:12] you do,
[1:24:14] it's
[1:24:16] it's not something that we should suffer
[1:24:18] with and worry. We shouldn't worry.
[1:24:21] We should put these things in the hands
[1:24:23] of the Lord. Serve God.
[1:24:26] Read his word. [music]
[1:24:28] Put these words into action in your
[1:24:31] life. Pray.
[1:24:33] And then trust in God.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; And he'll make a way.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; I promise you will. Let's bow our heads,
[1:24:48] friends. If you have a worry
[1:24:51] that's on your heart and that you
[1:24:52] haven't been able to shake it,
[1:24:59] take
[1:25:01] like this brother Charles said and put
[1:25:03] it in a bag and take it to the Lord and
[1:25:06] leave it there. Let's do that this
[1:25:09] morning.
[1:25:10] Our
[1:25:12] father,
[1:25:14] we thank you for the encouraging words
[1:25:16] of our Lord Jesus.
[1:25:19] And Lord, we're thankful that we can
[1:25:20] give testimony of of how these words are
[1:25:24] operating in the world today and even
[1:25:26] just in our little church.
[1:25:29] We thank you, Lord.
[1:25:31] And Lord, we pray that you would help us
[1:25:34] with our faith that we might place all
[1:25:38] of these burdens that we have and just
[1:25:40] place them into your hands. For Lord,
[1:25:42] it's much better in your hands than it
[1:25:44] is in our hands. Lord, these burdens as
[1:25:47] you said
[1:25:49] that that we are to bring our burdens to
[1:25:52] you
[1:25:54] and place them upon you.
[1:25:57] And Lord, we do that because you are
[1:25:59] much more able to carry them than we
[1:26:01] are.
[1:26:04] Lord, we place
[1:26:07] these requests upon you. The requests
[1:26:10] that are on the hearts of the people
[1:26:12] this this morning. And now, Lord, we
[1:26:16] give them to you and we walk away. And
[1:26:19] we say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you for
[1:26:22] answering me. Thank you for taking my my
[1:26:25] burdens, Lord. Thank you for all that
[1:26:28] you do for me. And now, Lord, they're
[1:26:31] yours. They're in the hands of the
[1:26:33] almighty God.
[1:26:35] And we have faith. We know that you are
[1:26:38] able. We do this, Lord, in the name of
[1:26:42] Jesus Christ.
[1:26:44] Amen.

[1:30:38] Great is thy faithfulness,
[1:30:43] poured unto
[1:30:45] me.
[1:30:49] I'm excited,
[1:30:51] friends. I'm excited about what the
[1:30:53] Lord's doing in this little congregation
[1:30:55] here in this church.
[1:30:58] I'm I'm taken back. Really, I was taken
[1:31:02] back. Last week, Daniel told me, he
[1:31:04] said, "Dad," he said, "When Brother Lyle
[1:31:08] gave you that note
[1:31:10] about our Christmas offering," he said,
[1:31:13] "I could tell that that you were
[1:31:16] surprised and you didn't know what to
[1:31:18] say."
[1:31:19] And I and I was just about how this
[1:31:22] little congregation
[1:31:24] the generosity
[1:31:26] that all of us have shown
[1:31:28] in helping to take care of our fellow
[1:31:32] Christians.
[1:31:34] Our offering today
[1:31:36] for our work in Durban
[1:31:39] was very very good one is $869
[1:31:43] and then add a th000 to that. So,
[1:31:45] brother John, $1,869
[1:31:48] that we'd be sending to Durban for the
[1:31:50] work there.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Good job. [applause]
[1:31:59] We only have just a little bit of time,
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; that God that God has allotted to us.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; And while we have that time, that is our
[1:32:08] mortal life. While we have these few
[1:32:11] years that we have in all of eternity,
[1:32:14] we have this section to do a work for
[1:32:16] God and we are doing it.
[1:32:19] Everything that we should do, we should
[1:32:21] be seeking the Lord, Lord, how can I
[1:32:23] serve you today? How can I testify of
[1:32:25] you? How can I encourage someone just
[1:32:28] like Stephen going to that that uh
[1:32:30] school board and helping that lady? Now,
[1:32:32] you know what? That lady not only I mean
[1:32:34] the kids, it's like, okay, you got your
[1:32:35] tuition paid, big deal. Now she has
[1:32:37] people that will support her, people
[1:32:39] that will love her and people that will
[1:32:41] help her get through this life. That is
[1:32:43] the most important thing. And that's
[1:32:45] what we are doing here as a church. It's
[1:32:47] not the monetary things. It's the love
[1:32:50] that we have for one another, standing
[1:32:52] for one another. Number one, in prayer,
[1:32:54] going to our knees, praying for each
[1:32:56] other, and and in supporting each other
[1:32:58] and giving to one another. That's the
[1:33:00] important thing. And we get to DO IT
[1:33:03] WHILE WE are here on earth. And we have
[1:33:05] a deadline.
[1:33:06] We don't know when that deadline is, but
[1:33:09] I want to get as many people at least
[1:33:12] introduced to Jesus Christ while we have
[1:33:15] time. Will you stand with me on that?
[1:33:18] Will you do it?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; And start. Yeah. [applause]
[1:33:28] And start with those that you know.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Start with your children. Start with
[1:33:34] your brothers and your sisters. Start
[1:33:36] with your parents. Start with your
[1:33:38] neighbors. Start with your friends.
[1:33:40] That's who you need to witness to
[1:33:42] because those are the ones that trust
[1:33:44] you.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; They see Christianity in your life.
[1:33:48] Those are the ones. Go to those people
[1:33:50] and win their soul to Jesus Christ. And
[1:33:54] then when we're over on the other side,
[1:33:58] you'll see those people that you witness
[1:34:00] to. Oh, praise God. You'll see them
[1:34:03] there and they'll be they'll be praising
[1:34:06] the same Lord Jesus that you're
[1:34:07] praising. They'll be singing these songs
[1:34:10] probably. Who knows what songs we're
[1:34:12] going to be singing over there, but
[1:34:13] they're going to be good. I'm going to
[1:34:15] be able to sing over there. I can't
[1:34:16] wait. The Lord will give me some talent.
[1:34:19] It'll be it'll be a it'll be a miracle.
[1:34:23] God bless you, friends. Remember,
[1:34:27] don't
[1:34:28] concentrate on the things of the world.
[1:34:32] because then you'll worry about the
[1:34:34] things of the world. Concentrate on the
[1:34:36] things of God and have faith in the
[1:34:38] things of God. Then the things of the
[1:34:40] world, the Lord will provide. He does
[1:34:42] for the birds.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; He does for the squirrels. He does for
[1:34:46] the grass. He does for the liies. And
[1:34:49] how much more does he think of us
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; than those things, his sons and his
[1:34:54] daughters? He will always provide. God
[1:34:56] bless you.
