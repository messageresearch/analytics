[29:49] and
[29:50] purchased
[29:53] [Music]
[30:00] um
[30:05] [Music]
[30:12] you may be seated
[30:14] tonight we're going to be listening to
[30:17] a prisoner
[30:19] from 1963
[30:21] july 17th i won't be starting it
[30:25] brother and i had to start paragraph 38
[30:29] it'll be about an hour
[30:42] now
[30:44] let us turn over to a little book that i
[30:46] never spoke out of before in my life
[30:49] and it's a very just one chapter
[30:52] it's a book a film
[30:55] and
[30:57] i'm just a little bit irish
[31:01] and i do have a wall around the bottom
[31:03] teeth
[31:04] to hold a couple of them back in place
[31:07] uh
[31:08] i sometimes i don't pronounce these
[31:10] names right when i do know what they are
[31:12] and sometimes i can't pronounce them
[31:13] right for the lack of education
[31:16] so bulimia someone said back there which
[31:19] i think is really the correct
[31:21] pronunciation of it
[31:22] now the first verse i want to take just
[31:25] a word or two for it
[31:27] paul a prisoner of jesus christ
[31:32] and that's what i want to use tonight as
[31:35] a text the lord willing
[31:37] is a prisoner
[31:40] [Music]
[31:41] now you can hardly imagine
[31:45] paul
[31:46] regarding himself a prisoner
[31:49] a born free man filled with the holy
[31:52] spirit
[31:53] but yet he calls himself a prisoner
[31:57] and now we find out when he's addressing
[31:59] the corinthians
[32:00] paul an apostle of jesus christ
[32:03] another time paul a servant of jesus
[32:06] christ
[32:08] by the will of god
[32:10] when he's speaking to timothy different
[32:12] one now when he's writing here to
[32:14] slingman he says
[32:15] paul a prisoner
[38:58] here
[38:59] now this little kid has never exactly
[39:01] seen himself like that so he comes to
[39:04] the city to visit his grandma
[39:07] and at the
[39:08] on the
[39:09] room the grandma had a house that had a
[39:12] complete mare on the door
[39:15] and so it was all like running through
[39:16] the
[39:17] room
[39:19] seen another little boy in front of him
[39:21] and the little boy was running also so
[39:23] he thought he should stop a few minutes
[39:25] to see what the little lad was going to
[39:27] dude and when he stopped the little boy
[39:29] stop
[39:31] returning he said the little boy turned
[39:32] his head
[39:34] he scratched his head the little guy
[39:35] scratched his
[39:37] body walked closer to investigate and he
[39:40] turned around and his mother watched him
[39:42] and his grandmother was amazement said
[39:44] well my mother that's me
[39:48] so i said
[39:50] that we too are
[39:52] reflecting something
[39:55] see our life is reflected
[39:58] and now if we lived in the days of north
[40:01] whose side would we take
[40:03] what sides are we talking about great uh
[40:06] or today that noah
[40:08] what size would we talk in the days of
[40:10] moses
[40:11] what side in the days of elijah the
[40:14] prophet
[40:15] when all the world was golfed up in a a
[40:18] great a mess of uh of modernism like the
[40:22] modern
[40:23] jezebel and and let all the servants of
[40:26] the lord out into a whirly way in the
[40:28] church the priest is all bound to her
[40:30] would you tuck the side of popularity or
[40:33] we're just stupid elijah
[40:35] now
[40:36] in the days of the lord jesus when we
[40:38] think of this unpopular person
[40:40] uneducated by the world those schools
[40:43] they could ever find that he went to
[40:46] and no no seminary experience and and
[40:49] then raised up with the name of
[40:51] illegitimate birth
[40:53] and that cut out preaching a gospel that
[40:55] was contrary to anything that they had
[40:57] been taught
[40:59] in condemning the ministers in their
[41:00] organizations and so forth and the
[41:04] organizations that made uh a statement
[41:07] if anybody even went to hear the
[41:09] so-called prophets would be put out of
[41:11] the synagogue which was a a mortal sin
[41:14] there had to be a account only the
[41:17] worshipers earned the blood of the lamb
[41:19] they had to come to this sacrifice and
[41:21] and then they were outcasting what a
[41:24] great thing it was and this man ignored
[41:26] such as that
[41:27] and yet he was perfectly with the
[41:29] scripture
[41:30] but not in the way they knew it what
[41:32] side would you touch
[41:34] see neither your life that you live now
[41:38] reflects now just what you would have
[41:40] done then because you still are
[41:42] possessed with the same spirit
[41:45] if you take that side down with them
[41:47] you'd have done it dang it
[41:49] because the same spirit that's in you
[41:51] now within people then
[41:53] see the devil never takes his spirit he
[41:55] just goes off one man on to another god
[41:58] never takes his spirit peter it goes
[42:00] from one to the other see so the very
[42:02] spirit is up on elijah come upon elisha
[42:05] same one on john the baptist and so
[42:07] forth the holy spirit was up on christ
[42:09] come upon the disciples all down and
[42:11] still upon the people you see god never
[42:13] takes his spirit so there we are left to
[42:16] make a choice and i i can't see here
[42:19] where paul
[42:21] was regretting uh anything
[42:24] and saying he was sorry he was a
[42:26] prisoner but he's addressing himself i
[42:29] believe that paul as he wrote this
[42:31] letter
[42:32] with that pen that it was the holy
[42:35] spirit
[42:36] causing him to write that that maybe
[42:40] even to this night that we might pull
[42:42] out the context
[42:44] of our text to show why paul says it's
[42:47] because his scripture and scripture is
[42:50] eternal
[42:51] i believe it's sitting in this dingy old
[42:54] jail
[42:56] that paul wrote the uh to his
[42:59] party here that his brother that he was
[43:03] a prisoner of jesus christ so he could
[43:06] express it by seeing what was around
[43:10] while he was in jail but that wasn't
[43:12] what he was speaking to this uh this uh
[43:17] servant of christ minister with him he
[43:20] was speaking that he was a prisoner to
[43:23] the word of jesus christ because christ
[43:27] is the word
[43:28] yes and paul had been a great scholar in
[43:31] his days he had great ambitions
[43:34] he was uh he was a
[43:38] a man that had been trained
[43:41] with uh by uh people
[43:43] uh fellows by the name of gamalia which
[43:45] was a great teacher obviously one of the
[43:47] greatest schools that he could have went
[43:49] to
[43:50] for instance like we say wheatner bob
[43:53] jones or some great fundamental school
[43:55] had been taught
[43:57] as as a minister of the word
[44:00] and he was well educated and smart
[44:03] and an intelligent boy with a great
[44:06] ambition maybe someday becoming a priest
[44:08] or a high priest to his people
[44:11] he had an ambition
[44:13] and then
[44:15] to find that these great ambitions he'd
[44:17] been trained for
[44:19] he spent all his life for maybe a age of
[44:22] about uh eight or ten years old up to
[44:24] about 30 or 35 when he finished college
[44:28] and graduated and had all these diplomas
[44:31] and everything and stood in good with
[44:33] all the clergy
[44:35] even to the high priest at jerusalem he
[44:38] had had orders from him personal orders
[44:41] written and trusted with this great soul
[44:44] to go down to damascus and to find all
[44:48] those down there that worship god
[44:50] contrary to what he said
[44:52] and to find him and put him in jail
[44:55] the necessary letters to put him to
[44:57] death if he wanted to
[44:59] he was at great ambitions and now all
[45:07] [Music]
[45:15] his father has spent his money for and
[45:18] the ambitions of his father and mother
[45:20] was all
[45:21] had been taken away from him
[45:25] because
[45:26] god had something else
[45:29] therefore he was a prisoner
[45:33] from his objective that he had in life
[45:36] and he become a prisoner to jesus christ
[45:39] who was the word amen that road to
[45:42] damascus
[45:43] changed
[45:44] paul
[45:46] going down about 11 o'clock the rest of
[45:49] the day
[45:51] he was stricken down
[45:53] and he heard a voice
[45:54] saying sorrow while persecuted and he
[45:58] looked up
[45:59] and looking up being a jew and know that
[46:01] pillar of fire was the lord that led to
[46:04] children of israel because he knew
[46:05] that's what it was
[46:07] remember this hebrew would have never
[46:10] called any language capital l rd elohim
[46:15] unless you've been satisfied that's what
[46:17] it was because he was trained scholar
[46:21] and when he looked up and he seen this
[46:23] alive a purifier that had let his people
[46:27] through the wilderness and uh he said
[46:30] lord elohim not the lord lord who are
[46:35] you
[46:36] i'm not a surprise it must have been to
[46:39] this theologian to say i'm jesus
[46:43] the very bond that he was so against
[46:47] wire all turned around
[46:52] oh
[46:54] it must have been something terrific for
[46:56] this man
[46:58] but all his ambitions that he had
[47:01] to find out all at once he'd been
[47:04] persecuting
[47:06] his ambitions that drove into us
[47:10] away from the main thing that he meant
[47:12] to do
[47:14] and what a great shock it must have been
[47:17] to this apostle when he said i was jesus
[47:21] the very one that he was persecuting why
[47:24] persecutors found me amen another little
[47:27] uh quotation we're not dropping here you
[47:30] see as they make fun of the church
[47:35] they're not really making fun of the
[47:37] church they are making fun of jesus amen
[47:40] hallelujah why persecuted stop me
[47:46] how could paul alone with all these
[47:48] interests believe that this was this
[47:52] group that he was
[47:53] persecuting was the very god
[47:56] that he
[47:57] claimed to be serving
[48:00] i think that's
[48:02] without going into details i think we're
[48:04] all well trained enough to know what i
[48:06] mean here and the same thing is
[48:09] happening today
[48:14] ignorance
[48:16] yet intelligent and
[48:19] than smart
[48:19] uneducated galileans that he was
[48:22] persecuting that had already ended
[48:24] humility accepted this man as lord
[48:27] but paul in his great teaching and his
[48:30] intellectuals cannot accept that
[48:33] and what a turnaround it must be
[48:36] to him on this road
[48:38] and he was stricken blind so he would
[48:40] not carry out his commission
[48:43] but was led down
[48:44] to a place in a street called straight
[48:48] in the house of one
[48:50] and then come the prophet down there in
[48:52] the name of ananias who saw a vision him
[48:55] coming down
[48:56] so old as that went down to where he was
[48:59] and went in and said brother saul
[49:01] the lord appeared to you on the low down
[49:04] sent me that i might lay my hands up on
[49:06] you and you received your sight and be
[49:08] filled with the holy ghost
[49:10] [Music]
[49:13] father what a thing it must have been
[49:15] for paul
[49:16] see all that he had been trained to do
[49:20] was vice versa
[49:24] with
[49:25] all the education he had it it was just
[49:28] become naught to him now he knew
[49:31] that he had an experience
[49:34] so here's another good lesson for
[49:37] that experience alone
[49:40] isn't enough
[49:41] ever it's got to be experienced
[49:45] according to the word
[49:47] of the lord
[49:49] so him seen this and know that it was a
[49:52] great something that if somebody else
[49:54] had received it before him
[49:56] he took three years and six months down
[49:59] in the
[50:00] desert
[50:01] in arabia
[50:03] taking the the bible as it was in the
[50:06] old testament and going down there to uh
[50:09] to compare this experience that he had
[50:12] had
[50:14] and see if it was scripture
[50:17] and now it was he said well i guess that
[50:19] was just a little blow over and went on
[50:22] i hope i was interested
[50:24] he had to become a prisoner to something
[50:27] a prisoner
[50:28] so after comparing it and seeing no one
[50:31] that he could write the book of hebrews
[50:35] see three years and a half hour laying
[50:38] in the word and finding out that the
[50:40] very
[50:41] god
[50:42] that called him
[50:44] was taking him back and changing all of
[50:47] his interests
[50:48] changing all of the illegal
[50:51] already trained to be always ambitious
[50:53] just washed it away from him
[50:56] and he became a prisoner
[50:59] the love of god
[51:02] had been so tremendous
[51:04] and such a revelation that he could not
[51:08] get away from it amen
[51:10] that's the true experience of every real
[51:13] believer who meets god hallelujah
[51:16] you you come in contact with something
[51:18] that's so great that you that you become
[51:22] a prisoner to everything else
[51:25] you you get away from everything to
[51:26] imprison yourself to this it's expressed
[51:30] one time when jesus said the kingdom of
[51:32] heaven is something like a man buying
[51:34] pearls now when he finds that great
[51:36] pearl he sells everything he's got to
[51:38] get that one
[51:39] and that's why here you you have an
[51:41] intellectual conception you have a
[51:43] a a theological experience
[51:46] but when it comes to a time that when
[51:48] you
[51:49] [Music]
[51:58] paul knew what it was he was he found
[52:01] out
[52:02] that he was hardest
[52:04] to something
[52:07] a horse and a harness
[52:10] it's the it's the pull of something
[52:12] and paul knew
[52:14] after this experience
[52:16] and three years and a half of typing the
[52:22] experience he had with the bible
[52:24] he realized that god had chosen him
[52:28] as harvesting by the holy spirit the
[52:32] experience that he had to pull the
[52:34] gospel in the presence of the gentiles
[52:38] the spirit itself harnessing
[52:41] and today
[52:43] as servants of christ we become harvest
[52:47] hooked up
[52:50] we can't go over the last thing with us
[52:53] amen
[52:54] honest
[52:56] to the world
[52:58] no matter what anyone else says your
[52:59] heart is touched
[53:01] there's something about it
[53:03] that you just can't get away from
[53:06] you've been yourself with it by the holy
[53:09] ghost
[53:10] has got you to the world no matter what
[53:12] anyone else says it's the lord that's
[53:14] always
[53:16] harnessed upper lip put in the opening
[53:19] to the word by the spirit even horns
[53:23] he had lying on the back side of the
[53:26] arabian bridge right there
[53:27] when all these former things and
[53:30] experiences and ambitions have been
[53:32] stripped of those things
[53:34] now that's what we find today that we
[53:37] must be strict first and people don't
[53:40] want to be stripped
[53:42] [Music]
[53:51] but you've got to absolutely be sick of
[53:54] everything amen
[53:56] and just blonde again afresh and take up
[53:59] from there that the holy spirit leaves
[54:00] you
[54:03] my daddy said when he
[54:05] got him went to the church he shook
[54:06] hands with the pastor he's a good lawyer
[54:13] now we must come back to the bible times
[54:15] for this day
[54:17] the priest was harnessed too but you see
[54:19] they'll come over into another
[54:22] dispensation and
[54:24] they failed to strip off their own
[54:27] harness and put on a new harness and the
[54:29] same thing we find today we did come
[54:31] through a denominational age
[54:33] as we prove through the church ages
[54:35] survival and so forth but we've come now
[54:38] to a free age where the holy spirit
[54:41] himself comes down and vindicates
[54:44] himself and makes himself known
[54:46] makes every promise that he promised
[54:49] come to pay
[54:50] oh my what a good time
[54:53] and he knew
[54:56] that another thing he knew he could not
[55:00] go to places
[55:02] that being harnessed to this that he
[55:05] will not if he didn't he wanted to go
[55:09] he knew that his ambition draw him
[55:12] amongst brethren
[55:14] amen he was invited to come and yet he
[55:17] was pressed in the spirit to
[55:21] [Music]
[55:29] we've got the biggest church we've got
[55:31] the biggest congregation your offense
[55:33] will be great and so forth but being
[55:35] pressed in the spirit
[55:38] he thought i got a brother over there
[55:40] i'd like to go over and save this
[55:42] brother
[55:43] to the lord but yes the spirit pushed
[55:45] him to go somewhere else he was a
[55:47] prisoner
[55:48] amen
[55:50] correctly
[55:51] oh
[55:52] god make us prisoners like that
[55:55] hallelujah
[55:56] from our own selfish ambitions and from
[55:59] our own
[56:01] thinking could be a prisoner of jesus
[56:03] christ
[56:04] i think that was a great statement for
[56:06] you
[56:07] i'm a prisoner to jesus christ
[56:10] and remember he is the word
[56:12] see
[56:13] i don't know what anyone else thinks
[56:15] it's the word see if you're pleaser to
[56:16] the word no denomination can sway you
[56:19] from it it's just a word you're just
[56:20] you're a prisoner to it that's all you
[56:22] can act the way it acts now
[56:24] he cannot go certain places that he
[56:26] wanted but called why the spirit for
[56:29] obeying him
[56:31] amen you remember many times that paul
[56:34] would try to grow something
[56:36] thinking that's why i could have a great
[56:38] need
[56:39] but the spirit would forbid him
[56:42] now does that clearly state and prove
[56:44] that paul was a prisoner yes amen a
[56:48] prisoner to jesus christ harmless to his
[56:51] word by the spirit oh i like that
[56:55] he was
[56:56] down he was bound
[57:00] by a chain
[57:01] the feathers
[57:03] of love
[57:05] to do your will of god and that only
[57:08] amen
[57:11] he he was a
[57:11] force of love
[57:13] he was in the yoke with christ amen
[57:17] he said your trust was nothing else
[57:20] he was ghosted with him
[57:23] and one of the league that's
[57:28] [Music]
[57:40] [Music]
[57:47] that we can completely surrender
[57:49] ourselves into
[57:50] your coming
[57:53] [Music]
[58:02] [Music]
[58:07] [Music]
[58:18] my heart is
[58:21] [Music]
[58:35] was correctly a prisoner he wasn't
[58:37] making any wrong statement
[58:40] he was trained by the holy ghost again
[58:43] to wait on the word
[58:47] now he can train one way but but god had
[58:49] trained him another way now he was
[58:51] trained by the holy spirit to wait upon
[58:54] the law
[58:55] no matter what his ambitions were now
[58:58] i'm going to
[58:59] uh
[59:00] hope for the holy spirit show you
[59:02] something
[59:04] now let's just take an instant
[59:06] one day paul and silas coming down the
[59:09] street in a certain city we're just
[59:11] holding a revival
[59:12] and a little demon-possessed girl
[59:16] kept falling
[59:18] crying out entry
[59:20] no doubt what paul
[59:23] knows that he has the authority as an
[59:26] apostle
[59:27] to rebuke that evil spirit out of that
[59:29] woman
[59:31] but did you notice he waited day after
[59:34] day
[59:36] until all of a sudden
[59:38] the holy spirit spoke to me
[59:41] amen
[59:42] this is the hour and he says
[59:46] come out of her
[59:47] see
[59:48] he know to wait
[59:51] on the lord
[59:53] and that is where so many people they
[59:56] reproach
[59:57] upon the word
[59:59] they go out with an ambition
[1:00:02] how many revivals have been left back
[1:00:04] because of a thing like that
[1:00:06] because the advantages don't work to see
[1:00:09] what the lord's got to say
[1:00:12] someone said come over here and they
[1:00:14] they call right now because
[1:00:16] the association says go
[1:00:19] and the holy spirit would say something
[1:00:20] different
[1:00:21] yet the ambition of the man to become
[1:00:25] the state president
[1:00:26] or something other or some uh
[1:00:29] editor or some bishop or something
[1:00:32] with points you must go
[1:00:35] and what he knows better the holy spirit
[1:00:37] saying go here see he got to his
[1:00:40] organization
[1:00:55] it's a it's a sounding blast and a
[1:00:57] healing symbol
[1:00:59] he hears only the voice of god and he
[1:01:01] speaks only when he comes out
[1:01:03] he says nothing
[1:01:05] somebody say oh oh brother jones
[1:01:09] uh brother roberts or some these great
[1:01:12] man in our lands today
[1:01:14] like uh connie hicks or or uh oral
[1:01:18] roberts or or
[1:01:19] a little connie audrey some of those
[1:01:22] great
[1:01:23] it's time to say
[1:01:25] hey
[1:01:26] come over here tommy you're a great man
[1:01:29] of god a world
[1:01:30] and i i got a uh uncle that's right over
[1:01:33] here it's all bound
[1:01:35] and he's uh he's sick i want you to come
[1:01:38] over i believe you have the strength to
[1:01:41] heal you see
[1:01:43] i know the holy spirit would say dream
[1:01:45] not now
[1:01:47] but yet to the friendship of that
[1:01:50] man he's duty back
[1:01:53] to go with him
[1:01:54] if he don't he becomes an enemy to that
[1:01:56] name
[1:01:58] that man said well he wants the throwing
[1:01:59] source he or that child out of that boy
[1:02:01] i know he did and i get his friend free
[1:02:04] here
[1:02:06] and he wouldn't come to my place
[1:02:08] but if he's constrained by the holy
[1:02:10] spirit not to go he better not go
[1:02:13] if he speaks to god his friend he loves
[1:02:17] the holy
[1:02:18] spirit courts it won't do any good
[1:02:20] anymore
[1:02:22] i experienced that so many times
[1:02:24] but paul
[1:02:25] just waited for the spirit
[1:02:27] to tell him what to do
[1:02:32] and watched out ever foreign a crippled
[1:02:34] man and all once the spirit spoke in
[1:02:37] yeah and he said i perceive
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:02:41] the same way he perceives is going to be
[1:02:43] arrested on an island
[1:02:45] i perceive that you have
[1:02:49] [Music]
[1:03:00] to say see you would yoke to that appeal
[1:03:04] now you say brother then you're
[1:03:06] condemning what you said sonny about
[1:03:08] you've been waiting all this time but
[1:03:10] you remember it was the holy spirit that
[1:03:11] spoke to me yesterday on their own
[1:03:13] instead of sending you back amongst the
[1:03:14] sickening
[1:03:16] it's obedience to the holy spirit
[1:03:18] i didn't go until he told me to do it i
[1:03:21] was waiting for thus saith the lord
[1:03:22] until i got the saith the lord now
[1:03:27] it makes a difference yes he waited for
[1:03:30] an award along
[1:03:32] he was pressed in the spirit
[1:03:34] to do only god's bidding
[1:03:37] that he become a pleasure
[1:03:41] of jesus christ
[1:03:43] friends if we could only become
[1:03:44] prisoners
[1:03:46] that was hot
[1:03:47] but i like to name a couple more
[1:03:49] characters
[1:03:52] but i like the name just another
[1:03:54] character too
[1:03:56] let's take the character mode
[1:03:59] he was uh born a deliverer
[1:04:03] and he he knew that that he was born a
[1:04:07] deliverer
[1:04:09] but before i say about moses i'd like to
[1:04:11] make this statement that god always has
[1:04:14] to pick any man that was serving truly
[1:04:17] to be his prisoner
[1:04:19] a man has to surrender
[1:04:21] every ambition he's got
[1:04:24] everything that he is
[1:04:26] every everything is life soul bodies
[1:04:30] will ambitions and everything else and
[1:04:31] become a complete a prisoner
[1:04:34] to christ who is the word
[1:04:38] to serve god you might have to walk
[1:04:41] contrary to a bitter judgment maybe to a
[1:04:43] certain organization you might think
[1:04:45] that they could lift you up and give you
[1:04:47] something good that you might play but
[1:04:49] what do you find yourself
[1:04:51] you find yourself defeated after a while
[1:04:54] until god can get a man that's willing
[1:04:57] to become a prisoner to him
[1:05:00] god is looking for prisoners
[1:05:04] he's always done you might search into
[1:05:07] the scripture a man has to be a prisoner
[1:05:10] to christ
[1:05:13] against anything therefore you cannot be
[1:05:15] connected with anything but christ amen
[1:05:18] even your father your mother
[1:05:21] your brother your sister your husband
[1:05:22] your wife anybody
[1:05:24] you're only connected with christ and
[1:05:26] him only
[1:05:28] then god can use you until then you
[1:05:31] can't
[1:05:34] oh yeah
[1:05:35] it speaks up
[1:05:37] what the people
[1:05:39] see i'm trying to get you to cut loose
[1:05:42] you got to have a starting place like uh
[1:05:44] sometimes called out the wind and
[1:05:46] bobbing their hair and wearing these
[1:05:48] clothes and
[1:05:49] and maintain their christian profession
[1:05:51] hey that's the little thing but you've
[1:05:53] got to start somewhere
[1:05:55] somebody get it out there on your abc's
[1:05:58] and cut this down he looks anyhow
[1:06:01] and become a prison to cry and then just
[1:06:04] keep on cut loose everything to find the
[1:06:06] last lines cut loose then you're you are
[1:06:09] a prisoner and you become in his grip
[1:06:12] he's got you in his crib
[1:06:14] now
[1:06:15] moses knows that he was born to deliver
[1:06:17] he knew that
[1:06:19] and
[1:06:20] did you notice
[1:06:21] with the ambition that moses had
[1:06:24] knowing his mother had told him over
[1:06:26] there she was his first baby
[1:06:28] no doubt when moses the little baby was
[1:06:30] born that his mother said you know
[1:06:34] moses
[1:06:35] then
[1:06:36] your dad
[1:06:38] a man and i
[1:06:39] pray
[1:06:40] constantly we know what is seen in the
[1:06:42] word it was time for the coming of the
[1:06:45] liver and we pray lord god
[1:06:48] we want to see that deliver
[1:06:51] one night your life told us to division
[1:06:53] that you would be born
[1:06:55] and you'd be delivered
[1:06:57] we mustn't pray to the king's
[1:06:58] commandment we didn't care what the king
[1:07:00] said then we know that you were born a
[1:07:02] deliverer
[1:07:04] now moses we know that we couldn't bring
[1:07:06] you up right i remember they've been
[1:07:08] down there 400 years in egypt
[1:07:10] see
[1:07:11] and we wanted to get you the the right
[1:07:14] thing the right education around right
[1:07:17] training
[1:07:18] so
[1:07:19] i'll talk to you and put you in the real
[1:07:20] art
[1:07:21] it sets you up into the nod
[1:07:23] and how strange is the curse taking that
[1:07:26] little art down through the reeds and
[1:07:28] rushes and brought it right down miles
[1:07:30] away and turned it right into pharaoh's
[1:07:32] palace where uh his
[1:07:35] favorite daughter was uh where the
[1:07:37] dating pool was
[1:07:38] and how
[1:07:40] at our moment need a woman to asian
[1:07:43] and in that days of course they didn't
[1:07:45] have these
[1:07:46] bottles to raise the babies on so did
[1:07:48] that have a wet nurse so and mariam i
[1:07:52] sent her down she stood there and she
[1:07:54] said well i don't know where i can find
[1:07:56] a wet nurse and come and got me and
[1:07:58] moses the doors are all shut
[1:08:00] honey you're 16 years old now and you're
[1:08:03] going to be filling your son
[1:08:05] and someday
[1:08:06] you're going to be the deliverer
[1:08:09] that's going to take the people out of
[1:08:10] here moses ambitious beginners
[1:08:12] i'll study mother i'll study everything
[1:08:15] i can you know what i'll do i'll study
[1:08:17] how to be a military man
[1:08:20] and i don't know how to take these
[1:08:21] people out here i'll be a great general
[1:08:24] bishop you know i know how it's done
[1:08:28] i'll i'll take it out i'll get my phd
[1:08:30] here
[1:08:31] i'll do it
[1:08:33] my father's genetic chimney
[1:08:35] if you ever read these books all right
[1:08:37] he's going to deliver all the
[1:08:38] protestants you know when he become one
[1:08:40] himself so
[1:08:42] this great priest years ago
[1:08:45] father kennedy you know what you get his
[1:08:46] book really if you call him father and
[1:08:48] just his brother trinity what it was we
[1:08:49] don't call homie father like that so we
[1:08:52] find him
[1:08:54] let me uh he's going to read the bible
[1:08:56] so we could get out there and disprove
[1:08:58] the process of religion the big law
[1:09:00] accounting why would read the bible the
[1:09:02] holy spirit come before him he got the
[1:09:04] legal
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:07] so then
[1:09:09] notice this
[1:09:12] that moses got all the training because
[1:09:15] he he knew he was so smart
[1:09:21] [Music]
[1:09:27] psychologist he could teach her the
[1:09:29] general what military might love
[1:09:33] was a great man
[1:09:34] and people feared moses because of his
[1:09:37] greatest soul was such a scholarship man
[1:09:40] he was an archbishop but maybe like a
[1:09:42] pope he was a great fellow
[1:09:44] and he was a a mighty man and he know
[1:09:49] that he was born to do this
[1:09:51] and had trained with great ambitions to
[1:09:54] do it just like today
[1:09:56] i don't say that man training in these
[1:09:59] schools i don't say that like you're out
[1:10:02] here in the west now they're going to
[1:10:03] build a
[1:10:04] 150 million dollar
[1:10:07] uh school of theology
[1:10:10] see pentecostal
[1:10:12] uh
[1:10:14] 150 million dollar
[1:10:17] school
[1:10:19] to me that should be missionaries in the
[1:10:22] field
[1:10:24] but what is it what did he do when he
[1:10:26] come out of there
[1:10:27] bunch of ricky
[1:10:29] just did that and then that's how they
[1:10:31] come out with always have the rest of
[1:10:32] them and that's the same line see
[1:10:35] now we find out
[1:10:37] that when uh
[1:10:38] moses in all this training
[1:10:41] and today with all the training
[1:10:44] making big bishops and so forth with
[1:10:46] great high ambitions what do we do
[1:10:49] our ambitions become just about like
[1:10:51] what moses was see
[1:10:54] god before he could get the man in his
[1:10:57] hand
[1:10:58] he has a stripping
[1:11:00] of his ambition
[1:11:02] he had a stripping of all his training
[1:11:05] he did go out and he delivered
[1:11:08] he killed one egyptian
[1:11:10] and he uh and when he did he found out
[1:11:13] that he was in the wrong he couldn't do
[1:11:15] that it wasn't that way and god had to
[1:11:18] take him out into the wilderness
[1:11:21] into the desert
[1:11:23] a desert place
[1:11:25] you notice
[1:11:26] kind of strange how these fellows
[1:11:29] that god got a message for him
[1:11:32] he takes them into a desert
[1:11:35] he took paul to the desert yeah
[1:11:40] to train
[1:11:41] to tell him what all this great vision
[1:11:44] was
[1:11:45] out into the desert
[1:11:47] we actually sit in desert and he stayed
[1:11:49] there
[1:11:50] until god fully made no one what to do
[1:11:54] and he knows his time
[1:11:56] he took him out in the desert
[1:11:59] kept him out there for 40 years
[1:12:02] and stripped him of all his theology and
[1:12:04] all his ambition
[1:12:07] oh a lot of time
[1:12:09] that he could look back
[1:12:10] and see his failure
[1:12:13] and how we tonight ought to do the same
[1:12:16] thing
[1:12:17] when we see
[1:12:18] our ambition
[1:12:20] look at the healing campaign
[1:12:23] as soon as the law did something a few
[1:12:24] years ago to start restoring healing to
[1:12:27] the sick and so forth everybody every
[1:12:31] organization
[1:12:32] because they didn't come into their
[1:12:34] organization they had to get them a
[1:12:35] healer
[1:12:37] and what have we done let's look at it
[1:12:39] just a moment
[1:12:41] we have done the same thing that moses
[1:12:43] did
[1:12:44] we went out and tried so hard to
[1:12:47] manufacture some kind of america i smelt
[1:12:50] a disease i
[1:12:52] i got blood in my hand
[1:12:54] a manufacturer of merit
[1:12:56] lord help see and what have we got
[1:12:59] a man in such hard street just broke up
[1:13:03] and become regular drunkards
[1:13:05] now right
[1:13:07] and got their minds and switched all the
[1:13:09] way back to the art from the pentecostal
[1:13:12] objective
[1:13:13] back to making organizations and things
[1:13:15] again
[1:13:21] that's right
[1:13:23] and we tried we streamed we paid we
[1:13:26] labored all night long and proud
[1:13:29] meetings too we had no
[1:13:31] and trying to manufacture some and shoot
[1:13:33] up something and all these kinds of
[1:13:35] things and find us to be a total failure
[1:13:38] we're here going back to the desert amen
[1:13:41] right
[1:13:42] yes sir
[1:13:51] that's what you ought to do hey man go
[1:13:53] back and give up why we've done the same
[1:13:55] thing they did same thing moses did
[1:13:58] that doesn't do any good
[1:14:00] after 40 years he found himself a
[1:14:03] prisoner to the word of god
[1:14:05] what are we trying to do when the great
[1:14:08] blessing come out and the manifestation
[1:14:11] of all these great things that god has
[1:14:13] told us
[1:14:14] about how that we must be born again
[1:14:17] how we have received the holy ghost the
[1:14:19] baptism in the name of jesus christ and
[1:14:21] all these things here you see people
[1:14:24] instead of staying to that word
[1:14:25] harnessed to it what did they do
[1:14:28] they started with their own
[1:14:29] denominational theory which had already
[1:14:32] failed
[1:14:33] and try to manufacture something to look
[1:14:35] like the truth
[1:14:37] oh hell
[1:14:39] i better cut off right there
[1:14:41] i'm sure you're wise enough to know what
[1:14:43] i mean see
[1:14:44] but why look what it's done thank god
[1:14:47] what have we got tonight but uh
[1:14:50] a nation full of organized people
[1:14:54] who
[1:14:55] the scriptures of god amen
[1:14:57] who would call the
[1:15:00] light of the holy spirit that it was a
[1:15:02] mental empathy
[1:15:04] who would refuse such to come into their
[1:15:07] church
[1:15:09] and there wasn't permission to mention
[1:15:11] one word a separate seed eternal
[1:15:13] security and the things that the holy
[1:15:15] spirit has repeatedly proved to be the
[1:15:18] challenge that your challenge to coming
[1:15:20] from
[1:15:22] what have they got the same thing that
[1:15:24] lose their hand
[1:15:25] the rest of them see
[1:15:27] flew an egyptian what not what was it
[1:15:30] maybe he made some man start stop
[1:15:33] stealing
[1:15:34] or maybe live true to his wife
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:42] see
[1:15:43] that stinking dead man
[1:15:46] was always under your face fingers too
[1:15:49] of his success of 40 years of training
[1:15:52] a stinking egyptian
[1:15:54] laying out rotten and dead
[1:15:56] that's about the way it is tonight the
[1:15:58] only thing we can talk to this rebound
[1:16:00] has crossed over so close is the stake
[1:16:02] in front of church members that knows
[1:16:04] more about
[1:16:10] [Music]
[1:16:16] that's an awful thing that's a point
[1:16:17] back to you for all the streams and
[1:16:19] struggles and everything we got maybe we
[1:16:21] could point to a big school but it's
[1:16:23] dead
[1:16:24] amen we just wanted an organization but
[1:16:26] it's dead it's stinking it's just like
[1:16:28] the first thing that we've pulled out of
[1:16:30] like oh going to this while in adulthood
[1:16:34] [Music]
[1:16:47] called for that i don't know if you lost
[1:16:48] the feeling of the people's messenger
[1:16:50] well why aren't you out on doing this
[1:16:52] why are trying this why don't you go on
[1:16:54] with the rest of them moses is out there
[1:16:56] getting stripped
[1:16:58] although he had an experience of the
[1:16:59] burning bush that declared the word i am
[1:17:02] the god of abraham isaac and jacob and i
[1:17:04] remember my father and i'll come down to
[1:17:07] the liver and i'm sending you to do it
[1:17:12] uh he's seen the word
[1:17:14] not the ambition of the people or the
[1:17:15] desires of the people then what did he
[1:17:17] become
[1:17:18] he did not want to face the egyptians
[1:17:20] anymore he didn't want to face this
[1:17:22] thing anymore they become a priest
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:27] 40
[1:17:28] years and stripping down but then he
[1:17:30] become a prisoner
[1:17:32] at the burning bush
[1:17:34] the mighty moses was all of his
[1:17:37] intellect
[1:17:38] the bible saying that moses was a mighty
[1:17:41] man and were
[1:17:43] in egypt but watch what the mighty
[1:17:45] theologian did in the presence of the
[1:17:47] burning bush
[1:17:49] he always confessed his inability amen
[1:17:53] when he seen the genuine purpose of god
[1:18:08] what can you do
[1:18:10] [Music]

[1:18:37] are
[1:18:38] elected prisoner

[1:18:51] and then finally
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:25] [Music]
[1:19:34] that's how you gonna take it over that
[1:19:36] was his training
[1:19:39] so what you got in your hand
[1:19:42] a stick
[1:19:44] god does seem so ridiculous sometimes to
[1:19:47] the human mind
[1:19:48] got a stick in his hand
[1:19:50] whiskers hanging down
[1:19:52] 80 years old
[1:19:54] wife on mule
[1:19:55] deep sitting on the hood
[1:19:58] little flabby arms hanging down the
[1:20:00] stick just his head up boy he has dusted
[1:20:02] us
[1:20:13] [Music]
[1:20:16] conditions
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:30] to do the first step tonight surrender
[1:20:32] amen become a prisoner
[1:20:36] don't think of yourself or something
[1:20:37] else become a prisoner
[1:20:39] moses become a prisoner confess he
[1:20:42] couldn't even talk finally when god got
[1:20:44] him in his hand where he could only lose
[1:20:48] where
[1:20:49] god moved him
[1:20:50] he told him the word
[1:20:52] he know what was the word then he
[1:20:54] submitted himself to the lord and the
[1:20:56] holy spirit that god promised moses to
[1:21:00] the will of god
[1:21:02] that's the same thing he's done to paul
[1:21:05] that's right man
[1:21:07] he harnessed paul
[1:21:08] little crooked dose that tastic juice
[1:21:12] oh was phd in lld's all over me
[1:21:15] but he said i'm going to show him why
[1:21:17] he's going to suffer for the worst thing
[1:21:21] and that's paul's sitting there and
[1:21:23] seeing the word
[1:21:25] and seeing that love jesus
[1:21:37] there he went
[1:21:39] moses
[1:21:40] i am the god of your fathers
[1:21:43] i'm the god of abraham isaac and of
[1:21:46] jacob
[1:21:47] i remember
[1:21:49] in the time of the promises here and i
[1:21:52] see the afflictions of my people i
[1:21:54] remember my promise and ohio come down
[1:21:57] the horn of shoes
[1:21:59] you know what the word says
[1:22:01] now force you to go down there
[1:22:04] or is she with power
[1:22:07] to go down there and deliver
[1:22:10] [Music]
[1:22:12] because you've seen a miracle done by
[1:22:14] just like david was a slingshot
[1:22:16] harnessed himself and he went down
[1:22:19] finally
[1:22:20] god had a man
[1:22:22] that was subject
[1:22:24] to him harnessed to him and could not
[1:22:27] move until the word of god moved
[1:22:30] if people just do that today then he was
[1:22:33] his prisoner
[1:22:34] a prisoner of love
[1:22:36] yoked up in the bond of love with with
[1:22:38] god is paul was yourself in the bond of
[1:22:41] love to god
[1:22:43] just like paul both of them trained the
[1:22:45] same way
[1:22:47] moses trained you know to deliver the
[1:22:49] children of israel by
[1:22:50] military pilot
[1:22:52] to take it out of the hands of romans
[1:22:54] and brought him clean
[1:22:56] by great ecclesiastical force in the
[1:22:58] world that day
[1:22:59] great schools of training come up under
[1:23:01] the media and both of them went to the
[1:23:03] desert
[1:23:04] come back different man
[1:23:06] both of them
[1:23:10] [Music]
[1:23:19] [Music]
[1:23:27] left their homes and went to the desert
[1:23:29] to find out left their peoples and
[1:23:31] everything to find the will of god see
[1:23:34] they were trained in one way god changed
[1:23:38] them to another and they had to become a
[1:23:39] complete prisoner to not act in the way
[1:23:42] that they wanted to act but act in a way
[1:23:44] that god wanted them to act
[1:23:46] he's ashamed yesterday today and forever
[1:23:49] have we got another 10 minutes
[1:23:51] i really get to another character
[1:23:54] i see one before me now
[1:23:56] his name is joseph
[1:23:59] he was an elected
[1:24:00] son he was a perfect type of jesus
[1:24:03] christ
[1:24:05] he was born a prophet he's a prophet
[1:24:08] also
[1:24:10] and now he could see vision and when his
[1:24:13] young boy he saw a vision of himself
[1:24:16] sitting on the throne
[1:24:18] in his brother's bathroom
[1:24:22] of what
[1:24:23] he was kind of felt like he was a great
[1:24:25] guy see
[1:24:26] all of us what did god have to do
[1:24:29] he done the same thing that he did to
[1:24:31] the rest of him because moses was a
[1:24:34] deliverer
[1:24:35] paul was a deliverer and now joseph was
[1:24:38] a deliverer he saved his people
[1:24:40] from the family
[1:24:42] what did god have to do to him put him
[1:24:44] in prison
[1:24:48] yes sir
[1:24:50] remember he was stolen by his brother to
[1:24:52] an egyptian
[1:24:53] and they sold him to prompter and
[1:24:56] apostle uh give him a little bit of
[1:24:58] liberty
[1:24:59] and uh first thing you know that was
[1:25:01] taken from me and they is set in the
[1:25:03] prison
[1:25:04] cry
[1:25:06] crying god had to strip it now notice
[1:25:10] but all the time i believe in that
[1:25:13] prison he could remember that the
[1:25:15] vengeance said
[1:25:16] that he's going to sit on the throne
[1:25:18] and his brothers was going to bounce him
[1:25:20] because he knew that his gift come from
[1:25:22] god
[1:25:23] and he knew that it had to come to pass
[1:25:26] if we could only keep that in our mind
[1:25:29] but according to the world of god in
[1:25:31] this last days he's going to have a
[1:25:33] church
[1:25:34] he's going to have a people and these
[1:25:36] things that he promised he's going to do
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:52] yeah i want to be shutting with god
[1:25:57] that's where i thought about this
[1:25:59] being shut in with god
[1:26:02] nothing else
[1:26:03] you only move when god says move you
[1:26:05] only do as god said
[1:26:07] then you're shut in with god
[1:26:09] i remember he was thinking he also
[1:26:13] became a total failure to himself
[1:26:17] all that he knew all that he understood
[1:26:20] and everything he'd become a total
[1:26:22] failure it didn't work
[1:26:24] he was put under a situation
[1:26:28] that nobody would listen to him he was a
[1:26:30] prisoner
[1:26:33] see he was put into a situation
[1:26:36] that unbelievers
[1:26:38] would not believe
[1:26:42] that
[1:26:43] his ministry
[1:26:45] was a matter of fact
[1:26:55] what's good what is this you do
[1:26:58] he might stand to the prison bars and
[1:27:00] please foreign
[1:27:03] [Music]
[1:27:10] amen
[1:27:13] hallelujah
[1:27:18] god came
[1:27:19] in his prison
[1:27:21] like paul
[1:27:22] like all the wisdom he came to him
[1:27:26] and he used the gift that he had given
[1:27:28] to get him out of there
[1:27:35] what did he do
[1:27:36] as soon as he rose from his prison
[1:27:40] he was given power
[1:27:47] that he was under
[1:27:49] he was brought from the prison house and
[1:27:51] gave us powers for whatever he said had
[1:27:55] to happen
[1:27:58] amen
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:12] is
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:26] is and become a president of the word of
[1:28:31] god that he can only say what god said
[1:28:33] it is not to say
[1:28:35] then god moves through
[1:28:39] that lord
[1:28:43] [Music]
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:29:18] oh
[1:29:19] i just got about three more minutes
[1:29:25] we find out
[1:29:27] that he become a prisoner to god
[1:29:31] from the prison to the world from all
[1:29:33] the same way and moses is the same way
[1:29:36] from a pleasure to his own thinking to a
[1:29:38] prisoner to god and when he come out he
[1:29:42] had the power of god and when he become
[1:29:44] paul when the old thinking of moses he
[1:29:47] was surrendered and stripped of it he
[1:29:49] become
[1:29:50] a prisoner to christ's word could only
[1:29:53] move wherever you say christ he has
[1:29:55] stained the repulsive christ greater
[1:29:57] treasures than that of egypt so he was a
[1:29:59] prisoner of crisis like paul
[1:30:02] remember
[1:30:03] all three of them were prophets
[1:30:06] see
[1:30:07] and they had the best of their own
[1:30:09] thinking in order to become a prisoner
[1:30:12] to the will and the ways of god
[1:30:15] and we remember it
[1:30:16] now
[1:30:17] that he has power to divine that his own
[1:30:20] word he has power to loose at his own
[1:30:22] word
[1:30:23] he can say i lose you
[1:30:27] in the name of my king
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:39] christ
[1:30:41] makes his prisoners
[1:30:43] of love his sons amen amen
[1:30:49] the same thing he has things on forcing
[1:30:51] paul he that's believers on me the the
[1:30:55] worst that i do shall he do also even
[1:30:58] more than this shall he do
[1:31:02] the prisoner of the love of christ
[1:31:04] becomes empowered by his king who is
[1:31:06] christ
[1:31:08] amen and very i say unto you if you save
[1:31:11] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:31:13] in your heart but believe that what you
[1:31:14] said will come to ask you about what you
[1:31:16] said
[1:31:17] amen if you about me in my word in you
[1:31:20] if you're a yoke to me because him and
[1:31:21] his words of faith in the beginning my
[1:31:22] poor words with god the words may bless
[1:31:24] the lord and mother saying yesterday
[1:31:26] forever
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:40] before he come out he had to be taken
[1:31:42] out and shaved
[1:31:45] a few things had to be shaved off before
[1:31:47] he meet his king
[1:31:49] oh
[1:31:50] god sometimes pitches people out like
[1:31:52] that
[1:31:53] and shaves a few of their own wheels off
[1:31:56] chosen that they can't do this what they
[1:31:58] wanted to do
[1:31:59] you know what i mean
[1:32:01] they're not they're not liberty to do
[1:32:02] what they want to do before they can
[1:32:04] come into full power and be a lost slave
[1:32:08] to class they have to be shaved off and
[1:32:10] then presented sometimes he takes them
[1:32:12] to the deserts to do that
[1:32:14] to shave them all
[1:32:16] and then bring them out the anointed one
[1:32:19] to fulfill the purpose that he's already
[1:32:21] gained them to be a little
[1:32:25] brothers we're at the end time
[1:32:28] remember all other times
[1:32:30] what he's done he's always had to take a
[1:32:32] man and make him a prisoner to him
[1:32:34] for say he's on
[1:32:37] he had to forsake everything that he
[1:32:38] knows forget all these trainings and
[1:32:40] everything in order to know
[1:32:43] the will of god and to follow god he
[1:32:45] can't follow anything that man's got to
[1:32:47] do and god's at the same time it's too
[1:32:49] contrary one to another you can't be
[1:32:50] going east and west at the same time you
[1:32:52] can't be going uh right left at the same
[1:32:54] time you can't be doing right and wrong
[1:32:56] at the same time you can't be following
[1:32:57] man and god at the same time
[1:32:59] no sir you're either following god a
[1:33:01] fallen man
[1:33:03] now then if you are following god and
[1:33:06] have submitted yourself to god
[1:33:09] then you become a prisoner to that god
[1:33:12] to that word to that will no matter what
[1:33:14] anything else is you become a prisoner
[1:33:16] to it listen
[1:33:19] we're at the end times
[1:33:22] and i would say this with reverence and
[1:33:24] respect as the
[1:33:26] last couple of minutes is floating by
[1:33:28] look very much
[1:33:31] what god to my opinion
[1:33:34] will do and must do and will do
[1:33:37] and this last day is to find the tool
[1:33:39] for the heart
[1:33:42] you've got to find the tools
[1:33:45] to thrash the floor
[1:33:47] any farmer when he goes to his harvest
[1:33:49] he has to have a tool to do it with
[1:33:52] so
[1:33:53] you've got to have a sharp sickle or
[1:33:55] something
[1:33:56] some instrument to flash out the grain
[1:33:59] and the harvest is right
[1:34:02] god take us in your hands
[1:34:06] make a spawn servant of your love
[1:34:09] and use it for truth
[1:34:11] to bring the realization to this sinful
[1:34:13] cursed earth that we're living in today
[1:34:15] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:34:17] today and forever
[1:34:19] for myself god let me be a prisoner
[1:34:22] if all my brethren turned me down if all
[1:34:25] my friends turned me down i want to be a
[1:34:27] prisoner
[1:34:28] of jesus christ and his word that i
[1:34:30] might be harnessed to his word by the
[1:34:33] holy spirit to see
[1:34:35] the holy spirit make the word of god be
[1:34:37] confirmed by the same things that he
[1:34:39] said would be
[1:34:40] i want to be a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:34:43] let us pray
[1:34:47] i wonder tonight with our heads down
[1:34:50] if that ambition
[1:34:53] that we have of being something else
[1:34:56] or maybe a
[1:34:57] of something that we might think be a
[1:35:00] selfish thing
[1:35:01] wonder if we couldn't just kind of have
[1:35:02] laid out a sign
[1:35:04] i wonder if
[1:35:06] if some young boy here tonight
[1:35:08] look around and say i'm going to be
[1:35:11] when i get big i'm going to be a certain
[1:35:13] certain thing
[1:35:14] i wonder if you could feel
[1:35:16] the will of god move in your life and
[1:35:18] say no
[1:35:20] no
[1:35:22] my ambitions are lost now
[1:35:24] the last few days the holy spirit has
[1:35:26] been speaking to me
[1:35:28] i i want to heal myself to god
[1:35:31] to be a thrashing instrument of this
[1:35:33] last thing
[1:35:34] some young girl that might have
[1:35:36] ambitions of her fine lady character
[1:35:40] or maybe uh be a pretty little misses or
[1:35:43] maybe someday make hollywood your career
[1:35:47] i wonder if you're not willing now to
[1:35:49] submit your ambitions in the presence of
[1:35:52] god in his word
[1:35:54] here's a call of god in your own life
[1:35:59] god knows who you are
[1:36:01] i want us to be a minister
[1:36:03] close or a servant a worker somewhere in
[1:36:06] church
[1:36:06] i just sit in here once
[1:36:08] i don't know one-third of the people
[1:36:10] sitting here tonight
[1:36:12] but i just don't handle that's here
[1:36:15] but i wonder if there'd be such a person
[1:36:17] that you'd be willing to say
[1:36:19] i don't care what anyone says i'm god's
[1:36:22] slave now i'm going to preach his work
[1:36:26] regardless
[1:36:27] i don't care what my my organization
[1:36:30] turns me out i'm still going to say that
[1:36:31] word i'm going to do it
[1:36:33] my will is god's will god's will is my
[1:36:36] will i'm going to be a prisoner of jesus
[1:36:39] christ by his grace and help him i'll do
[1:36:41] it
[1:36:41] think of it while we have our heads down
[1:36:45] how many's got that ambition tonight
[1:36:46] would you raise your hand that's my
[1:36:48] issue
[1:36:49] i
[1:36:50] surrender oh with our heads out now
[1:36:53] slowly now as you think it over now as
[1:36:55] you prayed

[1:43:22] want to be a prisoner it's
[1:43:25] the lord we've seen through the
[1:43:28] testimony of your word
[1:43:31] that a person that has surrendered and
[1:43:32] yield to god

[1:46:14] reminded us of things that maybe lord i
[1:46:17] need to yield that i need to give up
[1:46:19] that i need
[1:46:20] and then find out later you say why did
[1:46:22] i hold on to that for so long
[1:46:25] it's been better to be a prisoner of
[1:46:27] christ
[1:46:28] than a prisoner of my own ideas
[1:46:30] ambitions and wants
[1:46:32] and can never never fulfill what we
[1:46:34] really wanted to sow
