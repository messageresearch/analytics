purr just my salvation [Applause] on amen god bless you tonight glad to be in the house of god amen good to be in the house of god to us this evening i don't normally preach on sunday nights we have a sunday morning service and then we're we're done but uh brother aaron was persistent and here i am he called me a few times and i was sick or my wife was sick i couldn't come and i lost my own brother i do want to come brother i just you just get me at the wrong time but i i enjoy preaching the tucson tabernacle and and you have a wonderful spirit and it's always been a a pleasure to stand behind this pulpit if you have your bible tell me all sisters thank you just one little scripture in psalms chapter 22 verse 3. i don't know how far i'm going to get in this in this uh sermon because it's pretty long but there's some things in here that are very important i think we should hear um let's read this psalms 22 3 says but thou art holy oh thou that inhabitest the praises of israel father bless your word this evening lord and lord our efforts of everyone is here that made an effort to be here tonight lord and that you would just bless that lord and have your way amongst us god and that won't be just another service lord but maybe something special that that we can remember lord that something that will help us in our walk with you lord i ask your anointing father that you'll anoint me and anoint the hearts to receive your word lord that nothing will be said father that that you would not have a say lord it will be you speaking through this vessel lord as the prophet god would say your unworthy servant just get out of the way and let you have your way amongst his father and we just ask this in jesus christ's name amen and amen you may be seated the the title of what i want to speak tonight is a little strange but i'd have to get to the end of the sermon before you realize why i named it this but i am music and i write the songs you know music has a a power to influence us mentally physically spiritually the right kind of music has a mystical power that can bring the presence of god where you are or even better said can lift you up into his presence and this scripture i just read it says that he loves for us to praise him the bible says he inhabits our praises what does that mean i believe he likes to be around when he's being praised and and i believe that it does something to our hearts as well the bible tells us that the lord finds pleasure in the praises of his people and you know the hebrew word for psalms is book of praise here's a man after god's own heart david a man after god's own heart a man that god looked at him and loved him he was special to god why was it he wrote most of the songs and it was a book of praise it was about praising him there is something about our praise i mean that's why the order of the church is is first you know have a brother come up here and lead the song service and i believe many times we miss the boat there because that is to prepare us and get us ready for what god is going to speak we are we're trying to prepare our hearts and that's what the song leader that's his job is to get us to begin to open up our hearts as we praise his name as we worship him as brother man would say we are we are priests and and we bring our sacrifice of praise unto the lord amen the psalms range from classical presentations written for temple musicians to the simple but expressive ballads which david composed while he was tending his sheep can you imagine where a lot of the songs that we as brother larry and i can say this coming from a hispanic and the apostolic church was a spanish denomination many of the ones that came out of that that that started that that church or that movement came out of a sousa street and and they were filled with the holy ghost and there was a power over these people and they began to write songs that to this day they bless me i get on youtube and there's a youtube area where i get and i just hear those songs and over and over and over they continue to bless me and yet other songs have been written in and you know sometimes you know the the gospel industry is a billion dollar industry and not everything out there that is called christian music unfortunately is cr is not isn't christian music and too much too much of it is getting it finding his way into the church and we have to put our be on guard all the time be careful you know in the book of psalms you will find rally songs and marching songs victory songs teaching songs there are songs of repentance we we we can read where when david after he had sinned and and and and and uh his sin had been uh shouted for them from the house top if you will he began to pray and as god purged me with his sup and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness at the bones you have you have broken me rejoice he said hide my my sins from your face blot out all of my iniquities creating me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit within me we need that right spirit i believe songs as we praise him as we worship him it brings the right spirit you can be down and i'm sure maybe you've done this in in your in your testimony you could say there's been times i was depressed i was down and i just started to worship him i just started to sing and the whole thing just changed you know how brother brahm told us that we can we are amateur creators and we can create the atmosphere around us amen we can change the atmosphere you can be so down and everything going wrong and but you if you just focus on him and begin to worship him get lost in the worship of christ you can change the atmosphere in a home you can change the way people feel amen lamentation also is found in the psalms petitions are found there praise and renewal and thanksgiving god loves to be praised he devoted a whole book in the bible to it just praise amen there in psalms 100 one of the shortest chapters in psalms it says make a joyful noise unto the lord it's not about finding the right key i know you musicians you got to have that right key and i understand that god puts this perfectionist in you that just got to be just right but you know god doesn't care i i i i dare say brother brown couldn't hold the tune in the bucket but he knew how to worship god he knew how to worship that i've heard other brothers too that that can't hold the two but yet when they begin to worship amen to worship god with all our heart brother green says every time he saw brother branham in the car going past him or coming to him he was always singing and by him by himself and and and and there was always seem to see that song one of them one of them i'm so glad that i could say i'm one of them aren't you glad tonight amen i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them the blood bot the redeemed of the earth hallelujah the ones whose garments have been washed by the blood of jesus hallelujah no ye he says that the lord he is god he it is he that has made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with thanksgiving enter into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good and his mercy is everlasting amen and his truth endureth to all generations brother earth i'm so glad it endured all the way to this generation amen his truth endureth to all generations the bible also shows us that man has a long and has long been aware of the effect of music about our daily existence and his power to influence people both physically and emotionally and and because of that many times there's there there can be songs that are made that could that could help us to to get into the right mood in the right atmosphere but there's also songs that that cause shame as well you know brother brown says in in the message make a valley full of dishes he says you know someone told me not long ago said brother bran music in the church is wrong i said it is i said do you think god changes his nature no i said then when the prophet got all stewed up and they said bring a minstrel and when the mystery began to play the hand of the lord come down on the prophet and if music i'm quoting the prophet if and if music brought the power of god then it'll bring the power of god now amen the right kind of music if we come and if we can get learn to enter in to that worship amen there's a saying that says too many that are that are singing standing on the promises are just standing on the premises and we need to enter in not to be not to be a a a a one is watching but be a participator to be a partaker of those blessings amen we find that the king saul there in in uh first samuel 16 23 when he would uh this evil spirit would get a hold of him and they would bring little little david with his harp and david would play the harp and sing to him and that evil spirit would leave see it brings a presence the right kind of song the right kind of singing from the right kind of heart i said so we've got to be the right kind of heart too many times we're singing and we're just voicing the words we're just moving our lips but as jesus said their heart is far from me when we enter into worship we need to be focusing in on the words that we're singing and let it come from our heart amen in second chronicles chapter 20 and 21 verse 21 you know israel put a choir of musical instruments as they were going into the battle they're in second chronicles let me read it to you and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth forever and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set ambushments against the children of amman moab and mounsier which were come against judah and they were smitten it brought victory if we can have the right kind of heart and get in the right kind of spirit and sing the songs that please god it'll bring victory into our lives you know the english back in the days of the colonial times and the french and all the european armies they all always marched into the battle with music because they got this from they got that from here they had the drummers and the musicians and they were playing they're trying to pick up the valor of the soldiers because they were going to go into the battle amen and we're in a battle i said we're in a battle amen we need that the right kind of music in the church especially and when the song leader gets up here help him you know we need to help each other out it's like the preacher gets up here to preach you need to you need to say sick them to the devil you say amen brother robert amen brother aaron amen praise the lord amen music with all its effect that it has on us think just think where did music begin where did it come from way back in genesis we find that there in chapter 4 verse 20 and 21 it says and ada bear jabel and he was a father such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle and his brother's name was jubal he was the father of such that has handled the harp and organ so we find that from kane's line they began to make the instruments and they began to use music to whatever effect they want the dance we find in the bible when god had overthrown the egyptian army and we find that the women and mariam taking the tambourine and dancing on the red seashore the holy ghost will set your feet to dancing the holy ghost will thrill you through and through get in the right spirit amen get into god's program what's taking place many times like i said we miss the boat because we let the worship just go right over our heads we don't prepare ourselves then when the preacher preaching comes we don't get anything no benefit because our hearts were prepared amen later when david brought the ark of the lord into jerusalem he danced before the lord i don't think he was just dancing like a crazy man out there with no music i think there was music if he danced it must have been music he did and it pleased god he danced before the lord and it pleased the lord sometimes we message people we've gotten too stiff we need to get our out of our comfort zones a little bit amen don't be afraid to do a little dance for the lord but also do it in your prayer closet as well as brother brandon would do a little dance around the tree and tell the squirrel did you like that well watch this and he do it again there was nobody to watch him but there was a joy in his heart it set his feet to dancing amen and it'll do the same for you if you just open your heart and let that joy begin to move in your heart that's a that's one of the uh the the the fruits of the holy spirit is joy the joy of the lord is my strength we've gotten too stiff we've gotten too too orthodox i don't know what it is what the word for that is but you know we need to let loose a little bit and begin to praise god amen glory to god also in revelations we find that that they're singing we find revelations 5 8 and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the 420 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and and golden vials full of orders which are the prayers of the saints they got slain of the spirit in the presence of the lord can you imagine this morning that i was i spoke for a little bit to the church we had no a visiting speaker but and i began to tell him you know that can you imagine when we stand that day before god when when after all this is over and we stand before the throne and all the angels are there as we stand on that glass you see before the throne of god and we get we begin to sing worthy islam that was slain worthy is the lamb that was slain hallelujah and we began to praise this is a song that says there's a song holy angels cannot sing amazing grace i once was lost but now i'm fouled they're not going to be able to join in they've never been lost they've never had anguish never had they never had a pain in their heart they never felt a separation of death they don't know what it is but we know what it is we know what it is to suffer shame we lived a life of shame before we came to the lord but he has taken our shame away and he took all the shame upon himself blessed be the name he is worthy to be praised he is worthy the lamb is worthy this evening hallelujah glory to god and he sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us hallelujah all the angels aren't going to be able to sing that as we sing that new song thou has redeemed us hallelujah thou has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people a nation and has made us unto our god-kings and priests glory be to god and we shall reign on the earth they sang a new song hallelujah we're going to sing a new song when we stand before him they'll be singing and they'll be praising in heaven if you can't sing in praise here you're going to feel out of place over there because it's going to be a lot of worship there's going to be a lot with 10 000 years one song says and we'll just get started 10 000 years we've just begun the battle's over the victory is won 10 000 years and we've just begun glory to god revelations chapter 14 verses 1 to 3. i want to establish something this evening first is that there is good worship there are good songs there are songs that brother green would say that are that are pleasing unto god brother green didn't like one song if you remember uh that song that says uh uh you can talk about me any way that you please you can talk a bit about me anyway and i'll talk to you about you down on my knees that sounds kind of holier than thou and it's true it's got a it's got a ring to it if you really examine it it's got a ring to it of holier than thou see i'm holier than you you can talk about me but i'm gonna talk to you about you on my knees to god and there's some some things the rest of the song is okay just that one verse but you know there are songs that are very pleasing to god i believe this song we sang i love him i love him for he first loved me amen he paid he paid the price for us he wants to hear us and i believe he does we were right after my daughter passed away uh we we got sick my wife and i and we were i would say we were at death's door and they just brought us back from the hospital my son bobby and my daughter elizabeth and they were they were taking care of us and we couldn't i could hardly walk up a step i was so weak i went down i lost i went down for 195 to 150 pounds in weight and and so we were you know it was very very rough and uh and now if you were here at the memorial there was a song that jude my son-in-law saying levanto vismanos i lift up my hands lord i lift up my hands even though i have many problems i lifted my hands lord and and there was a there was a service we'd had in our church and the same brother who was here this morning brother hawu who preached to our church this morning had preached that morning and and he was going around with the i had i was leading the song service after that and we began to sing that song and the spirit of god just came down moved amongst us beautifully and my daughter had her hands up in the air and he got her own video and she's just praising god and we were there at the house fast forward when we're coming back from the hospital my wife and i are very sick and my son put put some music on and i don't know where he got it it was on youtube or whatever but the first song was levanto mismanus and he turned around and here we are my wife and i and and he was moved because my wife and i we as we were we were lifting up our hands right in the middle of that and you know i think god will look down at us sometimes and as he sees us going through all the hard times and all the the tremendous trials we have to go through and yet we can still praise him i think god will say angels will you just be quiet look at my son look at my daughter look at them look what they're going through yet they're praising me yet they're worshiping me yet they love me hey man that's what it's about to get into that spirit that doesn't matter what we go through in life doesn't matter what happens we can still worship him and praise him i remember when they brought me the news that night we had we were there at the we were there at bill elizabeth's house where they would they would put the camera on her though she was unconscious and believing that she could hear us we would pray to her sing to her and and and i forget what they call it face time or whatever something like that and uh that night it was a saturday night my wife and i were real tired we went home we saved for that and so we we expected we're going to just go home and go to bed that's it but late that night i was in my study and i was i think i was studying something for first sunday morning when the doorbell rang it was about nine ten o'clock at night and i said what would that be and so i went to the door and i opened it my son and my daughters were there and all the family and all the a lot of the grandchildren when i saw them i knew right there that she was gone and my son said the words to me he said she ain't suffering no more dead and remember i just cried out and in my anguish i remember saying the lord giveth the lord taketh blessed be the name of the lord what would cause a man who say something like that it's something that's deep in our hearts god places a word in our heart and his spirit and that's what responds when we can't respond he responds amen glory to god exceed me for being emotional but when i talk about my daughter it just is so real blessed be the name of the lord and i heard verse 2 i heard the voice from heaven as the voice of many waters as a voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harper's harping them with their harps and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders no man could learn that song but the 144 thousand which were redeemed from the earth you know i believe there was a no pentecostal meeting taking place there right there before there's gonna be before the throne of god there will be pentecostal meetings amen amen if you don't know what pentecostal is you'll find out amen if you're talking about these these uh out these these living creatures slaying there in in the presence of god amen and everybody's just singing and praising the lord in job 38-1 the lord asked job he said where were you remember out of that he spoke out of that whirlwind he said where were you when the morning stars sang together hallelujah and all the sons of god shouted for joy there was a pentecostal meeting taking place there glory to god and you know pentecost is brother brown said it's not a denomination it's an experience hearing church is an experience it that's what it is you experience it you don't join it you don't go write your name on the book but you experience it it's the holy ghost and power and it's keeping me alive it's all over me and it's keeping me alive but as we said music has taken many forms some and many functions both sacred and profane in the message without money or without price 59 brother brown says some of you young people yeah that has wasted your living the hours that mother spent in prayer for you and dad all the teaching that has been done to you and you've turned it aside to listen to the whisper of the devil now you're desiring the music of the world the things of the world you young people listen to me at the request of of the seattle times there was a dr bernard sable a child guidance expert for the washington state division of community services attended a concert back in the 60s of the beatles after the performance he wrote the experience of being with 14 000 teenagers to see the beatles is unbelievable and frightening the hysteria and loss of control so far beyond the impact of the music many of those present became frantic hostile uncontrolled screaming unrecognizable beings and this happens today in the concerts of the world this is not simply a release as i first thought it would be but a very destructive process and i've seen them on youtube i've seen where these concerts and all there would be thousands and all of them had their hands up like this what are they worshiping who are they worshiping and we come to church and we can't so much as lift up one hand to worship our god but if we were out there in the world with them we'd have both hands up going into frenzies as they do in the world normally unrecognizable girls behaved as possessed by some demonic urge define an emotional ecstasy the restraints which authorities and common sense would place on them a supernatural power is at work here his satanic majesty the devil is using these strange sounds the electric guitar the drum beat amen and then all the drugs is being used in the audience as they're listening to all this to captivate the senses and lead them into sin this use of continuous beating sounds as a medium is a as a medium for communication with evil spirits has has a long history i don't know if you've ever heard of any of these i'm gonna mention some people that are in the music industry there's one nicki minaj her performance although criticized created an intrigue and it kept her fans wanting to know what's next the pop star continues to feed into the buzz machine and has even gone so far as to explain that she believes a demon named roman lives inside of her those cultures that choose to access the domains of the spirit world have often used a form of rhythmically controlled noise to facilitate communion the shamans say they ride their drum to the world tree the classic possession cultures say that the orisha the ancestor spirits ride the rhythm of the drum down into the dancing bodies it is called the trance drum the path led from the east of africa to the shores of america it began with ragtime led to blues and then jazz later rock and roll and finally various forms of rock but it was the intensity of the drums which hurled it into the greatest shock attack on the souls of men men and women some scholars connect the west african possession cultures with the ancient neolothic neolithic mother goddess culture which over 3 000 years ago stretched from eastern europe into what is now sahara desert sees nothing new about it it's been around for a long time when they came to america in those places where africans were allowed to keep their drums it mutated into can dumbly santeria voden in america where the drums were prohibited for many generations did you know that in many churches they wouldn't allow a drone this legacy of possession trans-danced rhythm became jazz rock and roll rock and then hard rock the importance of jazz as a contribution to modern music is a greatly debated question jazz is of course a stimulus coming from the primitive art according to carl neff an outline of the history of music the incessant monotonous drum beat was a key to reviving the possession cults of the east and africa in america from america through rock it has been carried around the world they used to use the drums in the jungles of africa to conjure up demons in the worship of satan having established that spirit possession does take place the possibility of the role of music and possession may be examined satan has always been highly involved with music beginning in heaven satan had led the heavenly choir think of it he was a song leader in heaven this suggested satan is the most intelligent being regarding music in our world he knows music he knows how to use it he knows how to make the best use of it to achieve his ends he does things with music that seems strange and even impossible the search of the use of music and devil possession resulted in finding two main avenues one is the use of beats in music to call the spirits or gods the other is the altered state of consciousness that comes through the drug that they use whatever it might be humanism the belief that man rather than god is a sum and measure of all things is one of the founding tenets of a faith called new age men a new age in the age of aquarius is anything but new the movement itself is older than hinduism and buddhism it is older than the oracles of ancient greece and egypt it is as old as a serpent in the garden of eden who beguiled eve with the words ye shall be as gods rock music is a product of a disoriented despairing drug related sex mad generation there's no question about that the first big rock singer was elvis presley who killed himself with drugs and he gave rise to the whole rock generation he was the first and his whole act was sexual and sensual when he played the first time i think of one of the national way back in the 50s they actually put the camera from his waist up because they considered what he was doing with the waist down was immoral and it would not show to the public in the message god keeps his word in 57 brother branham says now i do not like to call people nate people's names but i'm going to have to call somebody's name now but i pray for the young man and i pray all the time for him but he is an instrument in the hands of the devil and that man is elvis presley the people are are gone boogie woogie and or rock and roll wild the american people is gone and they're trying by that same spirit to get the thing into the church i like church music played like church music but we had tonight that's church music amen and not rock and roll in the church but when they get these spirits there is something behind this listen to that now it's not something just innocent it's not just something that just happens but there's something behind it he says and the devil puts himself out a challenger and it happens to be that this poor backslidden pentecostal boy said the way he learned his maneuvers of jerking and shaking he caught it and learned it in the church he is a member of the first assemblies of god of memphis tennessee or he was his pastor is a friend of mine and he is the devil's instrument of deluding and polluting the minds of teenagers of getting them into a place until they just left just left a place in canada i think they sent 14 young people into the insane asylum a few days after he was there and all over the country but the people has gone wild frantically a man named robert plant and jimmy page of led zeppelin both claim that they don't know who wrote their occultic song stairway to heaven plant testified pagie had written the chords and played them for me i was holding the paper and pencil and for some reason i was in a very bad mood then all of a sudden my hand was writing out words i just sat there and looked at the words and then i almost leaped out of my seat where did that anointing come from where did it come from bill ward of black sabbath he says i've always considered that there was some way where we were able to channel energy and that energy was able to be from another source if you like like a higher power or something that was actually doing the work i've often thought of was just being actually just the earthly beings that played the music because it was uncanny some of this music came out extremely uncanny stevie nicks of fleetwood mac it's amazing because sometimes when we're on stage i feel like somebody's just moving the pieces i'm just going god we don't have any control over this and that's magic angus young lead guitarist for ac dc is called a guitar demon and he admitted that something takes control of the band during their concerts it's like i'm an automatic pilot by the time we're halfway through the first number someone else is steering me i'm just along for the ride i become possessed when i get on stage what is anointing these people little richard cited by charles white the life and times of little richard i was directed and commanded by another power the power of darkness see they can even recognize it like menage can say that that's a demon and he's got a name roman this man here is called it's a power of darkness that a lot of people don't believe exists and that's true they don't believe it exists but it's there the power of the devil satan jimi hendrix's girlfriend her name is payne or fayne pridgeon said he used to always talk about some devil or something was in him you know he he didn't know what made him act the way he acted and what made him say the things he said and the songs and different things like that just came out of him it seems to me he was so tormented and just torn apart and like he was really obsessed you know with something really evil my my my this is what the young people listen to every day now these are some of the older generation of rock and roll we're going to get into a few of the of the now ones and what they say mark stores vocalist for heavy metal band crocus you can't describe it playing rock music except to say it's like a mysterious energy that comes from the metaphysical plane and into my body it's almost like being a medium and you wonder what is transferred when they're on the platform and they're playing that music and those young people are there and they're taking drugs and they're and their minds are completely opened up what kind of demonic forces are coming off that platform into those people no wonder the world brother bran said to be a time when the whole world will be start raiding mad we see the madness all around us but it all starts back there with one man it starts back there in 1950s elvis presley and from there he just begins satan begins to use this tool because he was able to captivate the hearts and the souls of the young people and with you young people that are hearing rock and roll music and country music that is not the music you should be listening to because it opens up your spirit and when you open up your spirit you receive what that music has be very careful with music you listen to even some of this so-called christian music that's out there be very careful what you're allowing into your spirit amen we should stand guard your spirit is a womb the womb of your mind your mind is the womb of the spirit it's the gateway into your spirit and brother brown says at least right down into your soul and that's what satan wants he wants to destroy your soul john lennon i felt like a hollow temple filled with many spirits each one passing through me each inhabiting me for a little time and then leaving to be replaced by another michael jackson it happens subliminally it's the music that compels me to do it you don't think about it it just happens i'm a slave to the rhythm he was a slave to much more than that he killed himself with drugs as well david bowie of the rolling stones rock has always been listen to this what he says rock has always been the devil's music you can't convince me that it isn't i honestly believe everything i've said i believe rock and roll is dangerous let me tell you this this evening it's all that music we were talking about rock and hard rock and these things but there's i'm talking about a wide range of music that causes you to open up your spirit he says it's dangerous i feel that we're only heralding something even darker than ourselves in the end you have to look at the song and not know exactly where it came from that's brook bruce springsteed john mclaughlin leader of mayhem may have ishnu orchestra testified one night we were playing and suddenly the spirit entered into me and i was playing but it was no longer me playing judas glenn tipton of judas priest says i just go crazy when i go on stage it's like someone else takes over my body that's friends is called demon possession that is what's being conveyed to all the young people out there in the world beyonce this is her testimony right before i be performed for the bet awards i raised my hands up and it was the first time i felt something else come into me you know my daughter i gave this testimony sister faye goodspeed was leading the choir many years ago and the choir was just it filled up the whole platform here i was back there on the larry and i would interpret for the hispanic people and my daughter was standing somewhere over here when the holy spirit just moved in this congregation and all those young people began to raise up their hands my daughter told me later that day she said daddy something came unto me when i was up there and i knew it was the holy spirit that's what we want to come into us jesus said when we come to the lord and we hear the word of god for the first time we you know maybe you came to an altar or something and you you just gave your heart to god and the word came and and the atmosphere causes just like king saul those spirits have to leave when you walk out of here you feel like you're just walking on air anybody ever felt that brother brandon said you know that you know that's a danger to me it's the most dangerous time in the believer's life because brother brown says you know gee equals jesus that spirit leaves and goes out wandering into high places and dry places looking for a house to live in because you're a house you're a dwelling place uh beyonce is a dwelling place my daughter was a dwelling police and then and and jesus said when he doesn't find a place he remembers his old house i'm gonna go check it out see what's going on well you know what brother brown said he comes back he finds that house cleaned and cleaned out and coming to church praising the lord just on it on fire for god he says but empty that is the most dangerous time when you empty out because you need to be filled and if you're not filled with the holy spirit you'll be filled with something else and when that spirit goes and gets seven spirits worse it comes to make to abide in that person and his latter state is worse than he was before because then so maybe a religious spirit gets a hold that's one of the worst spirits we could ever get a hold of because you look you can't identify it in yourself if you have a spirit of lust or a spirit of stealing or lying or whatever it might be you can identify it you know it but when you get a religious spirit you can't identify it you think you're all right when you're not and that time when that person empties out and walks around praising god just having a good time in the lord but brother brown says empty empty don't stay empty don't stay empty many times we go through the processes and then the time comes an evangelist comes you run to the altar again and you empty out again and then you just go through the same motions again you don't get filled with the holy ghost and then your condition becomes worse than ever it can happen again and again and again you need to have the baptism of the holy ghost there's nothing more important you've got to get filled you need to have this house dwelled know you not that you are a temple if paul said what don't you know you're a temple of the holy ghost you don't belong to yourself you belong to god oh god help us you young people you ever come to the altar and empty out you stay there do you get filled with the holy ghost make sure you're a dwelling place of the most high make sure your god is living in you amen that'll keep you through all the things that will come in later on in life amen blessed be his name i felt something come in to me she says i knew it was going to be my coming out night at the awards show beyonce is one of the most powerful influencers of adults and children alike however many people don't know that she has admitted countless times that she is possessed by a spirit guide she named sasha fierce beyonce is just one of many celebrities who is working on behalf of satan and encouraging us to follow and practice luciferianism it's that serious katy perry britney spears fergie nicki minaj lady gaga justin timberlake kanye west jay-z are some of the other more well-known professing satanists for example fergie states the devil comes and soon my conscious and unconscious might start to brawl as this cunning demon takes me as is voodoo doll katy perry explains i swear i wanted to be the amy grant of music but it didn't work out so i sold my soul to the devil nicki minaj said in the past that there's a crazy boy named roman justin timberlake boastfully announced you people out there satan is my master he always has been these are the people these young people are worshiping and adoring they're listening to them their lives is a is is is what they want to mimic and it doesn't go just for music as well it's entertainment all entertainment here's a quote from robin williams who by the way hung himself if you ever seen robin williams when he when he's doing an act he he sounds like about 15 different people just real quick and i've always seen i said this guy he's got a he's got a he's got a legion in him and look what he says yeah literally it's like possession all of a sudden you're in and you just get this energy that gets going but there's also that thing it is possession is dr jekyll and mr hyde where you can really become this other force he hung himself one day that's where it led him that's where he led michael jackson that's where he led albus presley many of those artists have died by by addictions and overdoses and everything else and suicides because that's where it would lead you first corinthians 3 16 says know ye not that you are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you they've got something else dwelling in them and all those young people that are there raising their hands and getting into the spirit and we come to church and we can't get into the spirit we miss the boat if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are hear me young people be careful what you're listening to be careful what you're opening up your spirit to first corinthians 6 19 what knowing not that your body is a temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own we know that satan was the anointed cherub ezekiel 28 14. he was adorned with every precious jewel imaginable ezekiel 28 13. he was a model of perfection full of wisdom and perfect in beauty ezekiel 28 12. and likely he was the highest and we know he was brother brown said that he was almost like co-worker with god he stood right next to god in isaiah 14 and 12 give me just a few more minutes and i'll be done it says speaking of satan how are thou fallen from heaven or lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou has said in thine heart listen to his his words i want you to listen to that one time i my son bobby he was about six or seven years old he'd come out of sunday school one morning and he says to me daddy i said yes son he said you know satan had an eye problem he had an eye i didn't catch it an eye problem he had that he had an eye problem if you listen to these scriptures you'll know why thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend from the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit just in closing this evening there was a man and i saw him he's still around i didn't know this guy was still alive barry manilow anybody ever heard of barry manilow songwriter singer of the world he wrote a song many years ago and this is where i titled my message i am music i write the songs listen to the words of the music of the song he wrote and ask yourself where did that anointing come from who is speaking through him i've been alive forever i wrote the very first song i put the words and the melodies together i am music and i write the songs i write the songs that make the whole world sing i write the songs of love and those special things i write the songs that make young girls cry i write the songs i write the songs my hold lies deep within you and i've got my own place in your soul when i look out through your eyes i'm young again even though i'm very old who's speaking who's talking to the first person that this where did this man get this anointing where did he get this inspiration who is speaking through him right now oh my music makes you dance and gets your spirit to take a chance and i wrote this some rock and roll so you can move music fills your heart well that's a real fine place to start makes my skin crawl this is satan talking to the people satan's speaking to the world he's pulled the veil back and he's not hiding anyways look it's me i'm the one that's saying this oh it says it's for me it's for you it's from you it's for me it's a world wide symphony i am music and i write the songs a song written by kiss from the album destroyer kiss i believe stands for kings in satan's service at the beginning of the song there is a sound of little children shouting i don't want to go to that place then the singer begins to howl his deadly message i'm the lord of the wasteland i gather darkness to please me and i command you to kneel before me god of thunder and of rock and roll the spell you're under will slowly rob you of your virgin soul the lyrics of a song sung by the rock group black sabbath now i have you with me under my power our love grows stronger with every hour look at my eyes and you'll see who i am my name is lucifer please take my hand in time as men developed their artistic abilities music began to take on many forms as i said before the sacred that we covered this evening and also the profane this is what is being used in the world today and too many christians are allowing themselves to be drawn by that music there was a time i could remember in my in my day that elevator music was just a violin or a little organ or something but it came to a place back in the 80s you'd walk into an elevator and it'd be rock and roll it'd be beatles music you walk into a restaurant now it's all hard rock and rock and roll anywhere you go you go into a grocery store listen to the music we're being bombarded by that everywhere we go because there's a spirit behind it brother brown said there's there's something behind that we have to guard ourselves guard our minds be careful what we're digesting through our our mind into our heart because this is the womb of our spirit and that's where satan this is where the battle takes place it's a battlefield of the mind and satan wants that once he gets that he'll find his way into your soul amen and i close tonight ephesians chapter 5 verse 15 see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because of days are evil if we're liv if we if there's ever been an evil day this is that day we sing the song there's never been a day like this day but if we see the holy spirit coming to to to fill us with his goodness and his word the revealed word of the hour we see the world being taken over by satan wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and be not drunk with wine where in his excess but be filled with a spirit speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord giving thanks always for all the things for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ one more scripture colossians 3 16-17 let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him the musicians will come tonight this sing the song the only real peace that i have you'll send with me tonight the only real peace that i have dear lord is in you with all life's frustrations i need you lord i know i do [Music] the only real peace dear lord is in you [Music] with all lies frustration i need you i know i do [Music] the only real peace [Music] i was preaching something similar to this probably 25 years ago in nogales it happened that morning i i was scheduled to preach that morning and brother gustavo reese is a pastor and our van drove up the house of brother lived there sort of the church and his brother jerry amelong was driving the van and his wife and then they opened the side door and brother billy paul and his wife a brother from canada his wife and two teenage daughters stepped out and i was struggling during that time it was about back in the mid 90s i was struggling with with whether i should be preaching or not because the lord called me late in life i was 42 years old and i was struggling with that and i had pretty much made up my mind i was like tell brother green don't don't call me no more brother i just don't want to do this i had an experience before that and that's why i was feeling that way and and i was pretty much making up my mind that i was gonna quit but i made this brother a promise that i was gonna and back in thanksgiving that i would preach for him in january and he called me every weekend are you preaching this you coming this weekend no brother next weekend next week and next weekend the last weekend came and i knew i had to keep my promise i believe in keeping my promises as much as i can you know the bible says you know that that your your your testimony ba and amen and brother bryan says that man's only good is his word so i said i'll it's the last week and it's all gold so i went not because i wanted to be there when i see that that van pulled up and brought billy paul i turned to the pastor as a brother if you want to preach this morning brother that's fine with me you got some some you know some really special guests here and you know no no brother you're gonna preach you know and i don't know brother brandon said the ones that are unwieldy the ones he calls then there's all the ones that say they salivate for the for the pulpit you got to be careful about that but i didn't want i didn't want to do this and and so i asked them well what did they well ask brother jerry he preaches i went i asked brother jerry brother you got a message you want to preach this morning no no i'm just going to give a testimony i went to the that other brother i think he was a minister no i don't know i'm just gonna greet the people i went back to the pastor and said no they don't want to i guess you're gonna preach he said well that that that morning i don't know if you've ever been in a mexican church but they're made out of concrete it was february it was january the last weekend of january and it's cold in the galas and and those churches made out of concrete with concrete ceilings and concrete was like a it's like a ice box my feet were so cold that i sat back there in the office when they finally all they prayed and they went out into the platform to start the service and because they saw brother billy paul everybody wanted to sing a song and i sat there lord forgive me lord i don't want to ever go behind that pulpit unless you're with me that for an hour and a half i sat back there i looked at the doorway going out to the outside and i thought well my car is blocked in my wife is sitting among how am i going to get her out of the congress i all this went through my mind i did not want to be there and i said lord help me and i began to ask god forgive me for thinking that i was something i'd been to a service about a month before that or no it was back in before thanksgiving and i never preached outside of here and he invited me and i went to preach over there and i preached sunday morning the token and then that night i preached the little sermon the brother shelley preacher many years ago one more night with the frogs and that that i of course i preached in my own way but i used that as as as my my scripture where you know pharaoh came to moses he said take these frogs away get him out and moses asked him what shall i ask lord when to remove him he said tomorrow and the question is why did he say tomorrow [Music] you know a frog is a type of an evil spirit many times god will call you in your heart and you'll say no i'm okay and you're gonna spend another night with that frog that evil spirit that's that's bothering you just trying to destroy your life when you could have come to the altar you could have come for prayer to be delivered of it that's what church is all about friends it's not just a place to come and just show off that you're a christian but it's a place to to be delivered it's a place to receive the baptism of the holy ghost it's a place to be saved for your children to be saved for the for the for the for the the atmosphere of the holy ghost to charge the air all around us that'll change the lives of people and that's what that's what that preaching was that night and that night the power of god i never had never as a minister had experienced that there were probably about 150 people in that church that night and the power of god came down and people ran to the altar the whole church ran to the altar remember i stood there people were just screaming and crying out to god and that was the first time i went to that church i remember i turned around and brother the pastor was on his knees and his arms up in the air just crying out to god and a thought came to my heart i didn't say it but it was there my heart and god knows god knows your heart you can hide it all you want but he knows your heart and i thought that's pretty good robert did pretty good you're good that was in my heart well god gave me a time to repent and i sat back there in that icebox back there that office while every brother went up there to give their testimony and everybody wanted to sing for an hour and a half i cried out unto god when i stepped out into that pulpit i was anointed and i remember i stood behind the pulpit and just to kind of give a little bit of myself i i told brother buddy paul and many of you know that my parents were in the healing line 57 with brother branham and i was healed and 55 myself as a little child my uncle was healed my grandmother was healed by brother bran's prayers through different manners for the handkerchief through the healing line through a personal interview with brother branham healings took place in my family and and i kind of just gave a little bit about phoenix and so brother billy paul would know about that and i tried to go spanish to english for their benefit but the anointing got a hold of me and at the end of the service the reason i'm bringing this is because at the end of the service i touched on a little bit on this [Music] and not knowing when i finished the power of god came down in that service the young people ran to the altar they've been fighting that spirit and they were delivered our gods just swept through the whole congregation i was getting ready i was i wanted to quit we went to have lunch after that billy paul he told us some wonderful testimonies when it was all said and done i had gone to the bathroom and there was about 15 people at that table and i came back everybody had already gotten up there walking out and i just found myself just i was the last one walking out and brother billy paul was in front of me and he was we're the last ones i don't know he just worked out that way brother billy paul stopped he turned around says brother robert he says you want to tell you something he says that was the holy spirit this morning i know the holy spirit and that was the holy spirit and he said there was a young man standing in front of me and he was sobbing and crying and you said something and he literally fell over his chair on the floor he said that was a holy ghost and i've often thought about that why did brother billy paul do that why did he tell me that he didn't know why but i was struggling he couldn't god could have sent anybody else in the entire planet that would have made a bigger difference because i seen brother billy paul stand back there when his father is under the anointing of god barely can stand he's getting the bible and he's holding his father in the very presence of that angel how many times did brother billy paul experience that brother man would say that don't don't fear that now that's that's that's his presence people would come up to him they felt that presence there was nobody in the whole planet that would have had more impact on my life than brother billy paul to tell me that god sent him how i put that weekend the next week and next weekend it was all planned by god like brother green would say if if you could write the script you know every one of us has got a script you can look at in your life and say yeah i know it was god i know it was god you know we could say well satan will get you all bothered and all tore up and that you're nobody you failed god and he's right he's the accuser see if you were a child of god you wouldn't have done that you wanted that you wouldn't have said what you said he's right there is he not and we could sit down and just have a little pity party and say oh poor me i thought i was a child of god i thought i belonged to god or we could begin to remember what god says for as many years are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god amen and you begin to remember how god led you all that time he came on the scene for me that time that this happened and that happened and he began to realize how god is leading you brother green said that brother man stood up in that church today one day and he said i'm so glad that brother perry and sister janice green followed the leadership of the holy spirit to come start this church and brother green you remember what he said is that what i did yes is god leading you who guided you for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god the only real peace that i have dear lord is [Music] hallelujah only real peace that i have dear lord isn't with all lives frustrations i need you and i know i do do you know
