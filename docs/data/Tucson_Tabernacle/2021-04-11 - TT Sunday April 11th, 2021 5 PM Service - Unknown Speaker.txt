you for coming and thank you for creating such an atmosphere and all of you for entering into it i hope i'm confident that each of us is here to hear from the lord i'm here to hear from the lord i want this guy to be someplace else so that he can speak if we yield ourself help me lord jesus i'd wonder uh if we could just uh if we could just pray together for a moment or two here lord jesus lord we're here lord we we confess that we trust you with all of our heart lord and all our ways lord we strive to acknowledge you lord we lean not to our own understanding tonight lord but we trust you to direct our paths our words lord that nothing be said that would cause anyone to stumble or to stray but lord that could be you speaking to us lord we believe that you're still on the mercy seat not the judgment seat we believe that there is still grace lord to the to the unworthy to the unqualified and that certainly includes me lord jesus we just pray now that you'd be present you'd continue to be present as we share lord the thoughts that uh better hear that we believe are from you when we thank you in jesus precious name amen i'd like us to read together our opening verse and this seems to be on and that's a good thing uh and i'd like you to instead of just looking at the screen i'd like you to open your bible if you've got it with you that's great if you don't there's probably one in the seat pocket in front of you and if there's not then someone near you might have one that you can sort of look and see we're going to read from paul's letter to the philippians the fourth chapter the eighth verse yeah so i hope you've all found it that you're not cheating and looking up here there now you can't cheat okay so let's read together philippians chapter 4 verse 8. finally brethren paul's summarizing something that he's been talking about whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest or just or pure or lovely or of good report if there's any virtue or any praise think on these things those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you that sounds like a promise if we do our part he does his i think we heard something about that this morning brother aaron please be seated now this letter was written in greek not hebrew or aramaic and the word for peace here is not the word shalom as as we would think but it's a hebrew word that's irane strong's tells us that it's probably from a primary verb iran which means to join it it's about peace and and by implication brother peter it means prosperity and it it strong further goes on to say at one peace quietness rest said it one again so i hope everyone catches that when paul's talking about peace here he's not just talking about quietness he's talking about unity that's how one of the ways that we get peace how do we achieve this this unity this peace how do we get there well we just read it by purifying our minds purging our thoughts focusing on christ his word good things honest lovely pure good reports not gossip not tearing down forgiving offenses not harboring ill will well the title i've chosen for this evening's message is some other disciples we're going to touch on several disciples tonight but i want to focus on one in particular what made this disciple different than all the others but perhaps what we just read in philippians is part of it who brother who you talking about well i'm not going to tell you yet we'll we'll get there but first let's set the context last week was easter we had a wonderful series of meetings here the lord really moved in our midst and i'm so grateful we reviewed the events of the last few days of the life of christ from good friday and climaxing on easter i'd like us to go back to that eventful week not last week here in tucson tabernacle but all the way back to the first century let's try and imagine what it was like to be among his disciples at that time let's enter the room or the rooms that they were gathered in let's sit with them let's let's be a fly on the wall let's let's listen while they talk about the events while they think on these things as paul would later admonish try to imagine the uncertainty they felt what is this what happened what's going on to comprehend the incredulity of the events look on as they share the moments they cherished as well as those that brought shame come with me back to the first century into the environs of jerusalem let's join this small group of amazed and terrified people who follow jesus for some three years many of them had walked with jesus they'd heard him teach they'd witnessed miracle after miracle healings raising the dead opening of blind eyes they'd seen his humanity they'd seen him get tired they'd seen him groan with a headache they'd experienced his divinity a number of them at least 84 had been sent out two by two to proclaim the gospel the good news of salvation given power to heal to cast out demons the first evangelists and that included judas iscariot we all know judas had issues but but remember the gospel of luke tells us it was after palm sunday and before monday thursday the last supper that that then entered satan into judas carry it being of the number of the twelve prior to that he wasn't possessed to the devil he was a thief he had weaknesses i have weaknesses paul said i must die daily it's a struggle it's a struggle to take up your cross and follow him some days more successful than others but judas isn't the guy we're going to talk about tonight and we call jesus followers his disciples all of the english translations from the king james all the way to the most modern new living translation when they come to these folks that says disciples disciple uh look here luke his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be what makes a person a disciple okay and another greek word we're not going to memorize greek words there's no test i just want to help set the context what are they talking about the mechanics if you will of the narrative we'll get to the dynamics the spirit and the life as as we go on the the word here is mathites it simply means a learner a pupil a disciple a student it doesn't mean it can mean other things we can ascribe other meanings to it but the basic meaning is a people a student one who's learning so so when we say disciple we're not talking about the 12 we're not limiting it to that or to the other 70 in the upper room at pentecost there were 120. if i could borrow and paraphrase a lie from brother john andes i would say it's sunday but pentecost is coming hang on the dynamics the power of the spirit will soon arrive will you be ready will lyle be ready i tend to get a bit technical at times that's part of my passion in the bible it's part of my nature it's how i'm wired the events of easter are often confused and mixed up the four gospels tell different parts of what happened that day some are explicit some are implied not stated clearly or or directly but maybe they're hinted at or or referred to now they're all accurate you can't say well well the bible is true but mark is more true than matthew or or john is less true than luke it's all true it all fits together it does not contradict so for example here's an example peter had a private meeting with the risen savior john tells us this so does paul but the recording of the event itself is is vague and and and indirect let's look at what paul relates paul tells us an order of events it's not a complete list but the items that it mentions are in order even if there are a number of gaps first corinthians 15 paul says i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received i passed it along how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of cephas that's peter then of the 12. after that he was seen of more than 500 people at once and after that he was seen of james this is the only record we have of that private meeting with james and then of all the apostles last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time so paul is saying that before christ appeared to the 12 and it's interesting he uses the 12 because there weren't 12 right there were 11. and in fact the first time there were only 10. so he's not talking about 12 as a number a body count if you will he's talking about the group that we think of usually when we think of the disciples but before he appeared to them he appeared to peter paul's very clear about that so so there's one witness that we have of peter having had a private meeting with the risen lord luke tells us that columbus clay cleopas and his companion had an encounter with the risen jesus at emmaus and rush back to jerusalem to tell of their experience we read about that in luke 24 and they the travelers clampus and his companion rose up the same hour returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the lord has risen indeed and hath appeared to simon so they walk into this room in jerusalem maybe they have to knock on the door maybe it's locked we don't know how we don't know the steps are involved we know these guys are basically hiding they're they're scared they're uncertain what's really going on and and and they hear this group talking about that jesus has risen and that peter has seen him in and then it's it's their turn to chime in and and so they told what things were done in the way as they were walking to emmaus and how jesus was known to them and breaking of bread so we know of course that thomas must have left about this time because uh jesus is going to appear right after this or during this and thomas won't be there but we'll get to that later so there's no gospel account that describes peter's meeting with jesus but we do have these two witnesses that said in fact it happened it happened sometime after he went to the tomb and before the folks from emmaus arrived well let's look let's look when did peter go to the tomb how might this have happened john 20 starting at verse one the first day of the week easter morning right cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark it's not the rising of the sun it's not the pre-dawn light it's dark now we we know that there's a full moon because that's how it works that's how the jewish month is set up passover's a 14th day the month begins when the moon is a new moon right you can't see it so 14 days later you've got a full moon so there's moonlight but that's that's the light that there is so she goes to the sepulcher that's a dangerous thing for a woman to be doing by herself going out the gates of the city a very crowded city crowded with pilgrims one of the three festivals are ordered to go to jerusalem every year it's a pagan place by now run by the romans there's all sorts of opportunistic crime that can happen people hiding in some very dark shadows but she makes it there to the sepulcher and she sees the stone taken away from the sepulchre it doesn't say rolled away it says taken away well back to a little bit of greek here the the word here is ahiro and only john uses this word only john uses it and it means to loose or to remove and in other words the stone was displaced it was out of place the seal was broken it wasn't rolled away but it was shifted a bit the other gospels when we get to them will find all three other gospels it's rolled away the tomb entrance is totally open people can go in and out and that word they use there is apocalyo i'm sure that's what you really wanted to know is apocalyo right but it's a word that the other three gospels use and john doesn't it's a different time it's a different circumstance it's a different case and that word means rolled away so then it says and then she sauntereth no then she's strolleth no no she runneth she runs and comes to simon peter and the other disciples so she's left she's left that tomb the stone's moved she doesn't know what's going on she's alone it's outside it's dark it's outside the city walls what's going on she runs back she gets peter and john right says cometh to simon peter and the other disciple whom jesus loved john's gospel whenever he refers to himself he always talks about him being the one that jesus loved or the other guy or something he he never just comes out and says me that that's just john's nature we catch that as as we read his gospel so and so she runs and she says and i'm sure it's not she says oh guys by the way i think she's a little more excited than that they've taken away the lord out of the sepulcher we don't know where he's laid him what's going on guys help come come see oh peter therefore went forth went we see the next verse he ran but it says here he went forth and that other disciple john okay and came to the sepulcher they both ran together they ran what and and john outran peter and came first to the sepulcher and they both outran poor mary guys guys i came for some help they both outran mary oh oh she's struggling back there got her skirts hiked up and as you know a reasonable modest amount and is charging along the best she can right and so she sees these guys as they get there ahead of her yeah and and and uh what happens here so he this is john again john stoops down and he looks in and he sees the linen clothesline it's from the moonlight the sun hasn't come up yet they don't have street lights right then cometh simon peter following them he's an older guy kind not as old as me but but he's still huffing and puffing and so he he just went in get out of the way john and he just kind of wedges his way in there to see what's what's going on here and and what does he see he sees the linen clothes lying there and and the napkin the head cloth that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself and then went in also john and he saw and believed not quite sure what he believed but he saw what he saw and and and he had faith in what he saw and then john admits he says for his yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead right psalms 16 10 for thou will not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou serve for thy holy one to see corruption then the disciples and hear that term means peter and john went away again unto their own home they they didn't have an encounter with jesus they didn't see any angels what did they see linden wrappings and otherwise empty tomb maybe they only saw that because that's really all they were looking for now luke's gospel account of easter morning begins after the stone is rolled away not merely displaced like in john's gospel it's been rolled away by an angel accompanied by an earthquake as matthew relates to us luke tells us that some of jesus female followers met with quote two men in shining garments who told them jesus was risen and then returned from the sepulcher and told all these things unto the 11 and to all the rest it wasn't just the 11 or 12 disciples that were there there were there was a crowd we don't know how big it was but there were a lot of people there certainly more than 11. and luke tells us it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the the mother of james and other women that were with him which told these things unto the apostles so we've got these these groups of of ladies that have come back and their words luke tells us seem to them as idle tales and they believed them not so clearly this is later in the day and it's a different event than that of a lone mary magdalene fetching peter and john watch watch now watch what happens then arose peter not peter and john it's not just a solo mission from mary magdalene that arose peter by himself ran unto the sepulcher again and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering himself at that which had come to pass so here we have peter by himself going to the tomb whose stone has now been rolled away not just displaced he goes inside he stoops down and again sees the lid and clothes i i think i don't know but i think it's likely this is when he met jesus it's the only account we have for peter being alone and his meeting with jesus was private as paul and those gathered when the travelers returned from emmaus are told that jesus had been seen by peter maybe it was later maybe it was after that we don't really know but perhaps his wondering it would have come to pass wasn't only about the resurrection but what had transpired in that meeting that he had peter is guilt-laden he is guilt-laden he publicly and vehemently denied that he even knew jesus and jesus caught his eye while he was being beaten as the rooster crowed and peter ran away he was miserable peter was just wracked with guilt peter needed healing peter needed to come to terms with this he needed to make this right he needed to confess his sin well as we sit remember we're back to being flies on the wall again as we sit and listen to these discussion and remembrance of the days we might hear others that are ashamed after all none of the twelve stuck around after gethsemane right they scattered john and peter were told ventured into the near the area where jesus was being abused peter left it dawn john stayed a bit longer we're told now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mother's sister mary the wife of cleopas and mary magdalene when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciples standing by whom he loved in other words john he said to his mother woman behold thy son and said he to john behold my mother and from that hour that disciple took her into his own home jesus asks john to take care of his mom john leads her away from that awful scene i can you imagine her heart must have just been crushed she sees her firstborn her son this miracle child crucified she can't tear herself away but she can't stand to be there either so jesus compassionate and caring even in his hour of extremity asks john to take care of her well when jesus died when he gave up the ghost when he yielded his spirit when the work was finished who came and took his body did the soldiers take his body what what what happened who removed it from the cross that must have been a grisly task who wrapped it and carried it put it in a nearby tune now this is the first century we're talking about a few weeks ago heather and i were in alexandria egypt and we went through the catacombs the area where christians had been buried in the you know i don't know if it was the first century might have been the second or third century by then very different variable practices from our day very different but but let's get back to the first century in that first easter who did this who took care of his body some of the 11 disciples the ones he taught his closest friends those he empowered to preach and teach and heal and deliver no no it was two members of the sanhedrin the very council that had condemned him to death they weren't in agreement it wasn't a unanimous vote but they were members of the sanhedrin the very council one of them is a fellow named joseph from a town called aramatia we're told by luke he was an honorable counselor and did not agree with the rest of the council but he was a disciple of jesus we read in john after this joseph of arimathea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that other accounts say begged or craved went right into the lion's den the very guy that had said see you to it condemn this guy crucify him he went to pilate i don't think this was secret and he begged him that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came therefore and took the body of jesus now the gospel of john here says that he's a disciple but secretly for fear of the jews what is he in fear of really i think he's in fear of his position he's going to be kicked off the council lose his influence that sort of thing i don't think that he was in fear of his life he'd been a disciple for a while while jesus wasn't under threat of death but still secret joseph of pharmacy is mentioned in all four gospel accounts mark and luke and their account they tell us that he took the body down meaning i think that he removed it from the cross what a task who's the other person who's the other person that helped in all this nicodemus yeah the guy that came by night nicodemus brought spices and linen together we're told they transported anointed wrapped his body together they carried it to joseph's tomb joseph we're told rolled a great stone over the entrance to the tomb the next day the guards came and secured the tomb which i think means they looked inside to be sure the body hadn't been stolen or removed yet and then they sealed it well who knew where the tomb was mary magdalene and we're told another mary there are five other mary's in the new testament at least four of them appear in the gospels it gets a little bit confusing and say hello mary and half the people raise their hand it's it's a little difficult but but these two marys watched joseph and nicodemus and noted where jesus body was entombed the 12 or the 11 now nowhere to be seen isn't it interesting and so very sad that those who stood by him in the good times were nowhere to be seen in the bad times to be identified with him during his ministry were unafraid to be seen caring for his body after the awful crucifixion even to confronting the very man who ordered the crucifixion how willing are we to be identified with him today amid scoffing politicization nowadays you say you're christian oh you you're one of those guys that stormed the capitol you're one of those anti-vaxxers or or you're just a gullible believer in myths and fairy tales joseph and nicodemus stood up in the face of opposition and rendered care and dignity to the body of jesus god often has people who seem invisible remember when elijah was in the cave and he was whining and god said i've got seven thousand that happened bowed the knee they were invisible to elijah to the prophet they were invisible but they were there but at the right moment it seems that these people come out of the woodwork they perform some crucial task in his plan and then maybe they fade back into the shadows again even today but the disciple i want to focus on for the next few minutes the mystery disciple this evening is mary magdalene all four gospels tell the various aspects of her role at the crucifixion and the resurrection excuse me mark tells us that jesus had previously cast seven devils out of her luke's gospel is the only one that mentions her prior to the events of that passion week let's read that luke uh chapter eight verse one it says and it came to pass afterward what is the afterword referring to the event just prior to this was jesus was at the house of a pharisee named simon he'd been invited there but he'd been ignored nobody washed his feet nobody did anything and an unnamed lady came washed his feet with her tears wiped his feet with her hair jesus scolded simon talked about to whom much is forgiven there's much love and forgave that woman over sin some people assert that that was mary magdalene we don't know it doesn't say it doesn't say but after that after that event he went throughout every city and village preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the 12 were with him who else was with him certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities more than one mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils that's the first mention of this and joanna the wife of husa herod's steward had susanna and many others which ministered unto him of their substance the guys were out spreading the word the ladies were providing the support well you say okay okay brother but does that make her a disciple well come with me come with me let's let's listen in let's get in that room and and let's hear mary relating her experiences that morning to the others that are gathered there that afternoon and and now the this is mary speaking and i'm dramatizing this of course but but it it was early it's well before sunrise and in the evening i had gone with mary and siloam to buy spices to anoint his body but but i remembered he told us many times that he would be given over to sinners and killed and it would rise on the third day i didn't know what to think what does that even mean here in jerusalem it's really crowded passover is one of the three times that observant jews like us are required to come to the city there are lots of pagans here all sorts of people taking advantage of the pilgrims harassing robbing beating what does this place come to anyway there's a full moon and i just couldn't shake the idea that today something momentous was going to happen something inside of me was just drawing me pulling me tugging at my heart to go to the tomb where mary and i had seen joseph and nicodemus place his body i we knew the tomb was sealed i just couldn't sleep so i got up dressed slipped out of the place where i'm staying i carefully made my way to the damascus road which passes by that awful golgotha to get to the tomb it's a full moon of course it's passover right so so i i can see where i was going but but i hurried along there's no telling who or what might be lurking in the shadows and i was going by myself out of the city into the countryside nervous of course nervous i came to the tomb with without any problem i i didn't see the guards i approached the tomb i had no idea what to expect but i never expected to see that stone displaced i was i was afraid i hitched up my skirt and ran for all i was worth back to the city gate i went to the place i knew where peter and john were sleeping i awakened them guys wake up wake up i was nervous i was scared i didn't know what to think i just bored it out to those who jesus bodies been removed from the tomb where mighty be i was i was so upset and so scared these two guys they woke up [Music] they woke up and then they looked at each other they looked at me and then they ran to the tomb hey wait for me i ran after them it would have been nice if they'd waited for me so we could go together but you know them well as i approached the tomb i could see them stooping over and peering in john was there but peter shoved them aside and crawled into the tomb that's peter bull in a china closet but but a moment later john followed him inside by the time i got there they had just exited the tomb and they were talking to each other and hurrying back to the city i heard them say there's just a grave close inside what what happened they seem perplexed and who wouldn't be they brushed past me as if i weren't there continued on their way i was exhausted i've run both ways already i'm not a marathon person i don't participate in the olympics here i was anxious they left me alone in that place i was hurt i was being ignored by the people that i came to for help so i did what any self-respecting woman would do when she's at her wit's end i bawled i cried and though still in tears weeping uncontrollably i leaned over and looked inside to see what are they talking about there was still enough light from the setting of the full moon to see inside if i really concentrated i was squinting through my tears i expected to see the linen grave clothes peter and john have been talking about as they left only a moment before but but but jesus told us about more than that and i saw something more well let's leave mary we'll we'll come right back we'll let's see what john writes about this moment mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulcher and saw two angels in white sitting one at the head the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain had lain it was gone and they say unto her mary speechless right they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they've taken away my lord i know not where they have laid him let's get back to mary i saw two angels they asked me why are you crying can you imagine i told them what should have been obvious someone took the body of jesus i don't know where he is is he is he somehow really alive and someone has taken him somewhere to get refreshed a more comfortable place in a tomb maybe to lay down and rest or maybe they went to breakfast somewhere i don't know what's going on and why did they ask me anyway they're angels why did they ask me i i didn't know that's why i was there how could i know hello well we'll leave mary again for a moment but we'll come back to hear her story i'd like us to go to the book of exodus chapter 25. now jesus confirmed to us in the gospels that moses in fact wrote the first five books there's a very interesting investigation at least i find it interesting maybe we can delve into that someday about how it was possible that moses could have actually written those books but at this point jesus has vouched for the authenticity and that's good enough for me exodus 25 we'll read a few verses here i want you to get a picture i want you to remember what mary saw in the tomb and then i want you to superimpose that with this they shall make an arc of em wood two cubits and a half she'll be the length of the cube and a half the brethren a cubit and a half the height thereof so this thing is three and a half feet by a little under two feet or something it's made out of wood it's a wooden box right and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold within and without thou shall overlay it shall make a pondered a crown of gold round about that a little ridge and edging right sticking up so that when you put the lid on it doesn't just slide over it's going to bump into that that crown so so we've got a wooden box it's covered with gold foil and there's a rimmer crown around the top to keep the lid from falling off verse 16 and thou shalt put into the ark into this box the testimony which i shall give thee so this box is going to carry a copy of the revealed word of moses day that's what's going to be in it and thou shalt make a mercy seat not a judgment seat a mercy seat of pure gold two cubits and a half should be the length of and a cube and a half the breath around in other words this is a lid that fits perfectly on this box and thou shalt make two cherubs of gold oh angels of beaten workshop thou make them in the two ends of the mercy seat two angels one at the head the other at the feet perched on the mercy seat not the judgment seat verse 21 thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark and in the ark thou shall put the testimony i shall give thee the words hidden in the ark by word lord have i hid in my heart it's covered by mercy the same mercy that we depend on what well then what what after you do this what's going to happen and there will i meet with thee and i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two angels which are upon the ark of the testimony of all things which i shall give thee in commandment unto the children of israel wow we have this in exodus we have this picture of things and in the tomb we have the same thing yeah certainly very similar so peter and john they were looking for a physical dead body they saw evidence a body had been there but remember they didn't even know where the tomb was at least we don't know that they knew peter was hiding john was taking care of jesus mom only mary and mary saw jesus body being put in the tomb and of course nicodemus and and uh joseph of arimathea knew of it and the guards knew of it perhaps some of the other sisters had also seen the body being put in but mary magdalene's vision wasn't limited to searching for a physical body something was burning in her heart something was burning in her soul she wasn't lugging jars of ointment or boxes of spices she wasn't coming to do what jewish women did in those days as part of the beginning of a morning period to anoint a corpse she wasn't looking for a corpse she didn't know what she would find but she was looking for jesus his word was hidden in her heart she was a disciple she was a student she paid attention to her teacher a single vulnerable woman in a scary place abandoned by the two disciples she'd recruited to help her a bit like jesus abandoned by the disciples the morning of his triumph no one welcomes him no one's there to celebrate his hard-won victory no one's looking for him they're hiding oh wait there was one there was one let's read again from john's account i love this story not a story like fiction this is the most important story that's ever been told it's been brought to us over the centuries by faithful witnesses who risked all that we could have the opportunity to learn of it and become part of it ourselves john 20 starting at verse 14. and when she that's mary magdalene had thus said about these angels right she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus she didn't recognize him and jesus spoke to her woman why are you weeping who are you looking for she supposing him to be the gardener said unto him sir if i have borne him hence tell me where you've laid him and i'll take him away i'll take care of him i love this i'm sorry jesus was the second adam right there was adam number one back in the garden of eden here's adam number two who'd been in gethsemane now he's in a garden tomb right and and and and she thinks he's the gardener adam was a gardener you say well wait a minute adam was the garden of eden that was just a perfect place wait wait and in genesis 2 15 we're told that god put adam in the garden to work to work peter put him there to work well wait a minute brother while the garden was perfect it didn't need anybody to work in there there weren't weeds nothing needed to be trimmed is that really what the bible says genesis 2 15 the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden why to dress it and to keep it if what does a fine dresser do kick back drink lemonade and wait for the grapes no he's trimming it he's doing stuff he's pruning it he's taking care of it he's making sure that everything is just right that it's got the right environment there's this whole garden of eden to take care of there's two people in there there's adam and eve they've got a job to do we're told that god came down and communed with adam in the cool of the evening maybe it's after the work day is done he's punched out right now he can relax and commune with god hey hey adam i like how you trim that bush over there that's good oh yeah you've had this inspiration and the two of us worked together we got that done good job adam you're taking care of the garden just like i told you that's that's just me maybe i'm wrong but he said he was put there to address it and to keep it so god worked right days of creation after it said god rested if he rested he must have worked or why would he need to rest adam rested the cool of the evening okay get back to we're we're way way behind here let's get going while you got to get moving here okay back to back to the garden here so jesus said to her after he said why are you weeping and she says i'm looking for jesus right jesus said unto her mary she turned herself up till now she's seen the gardener there but her eyes have been averted we're not really sure why but it appears that her eyes were averted a little bit as she was talking kind of maybe out of the side of her mouth or something we don't really know but now she turns to face him full on she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master now this isn't mass like master slave kind of thing rabbi just the word rabbi means a teacher or a master in that sense but this is a personal possessive form robonai means my teacher my master and he didn't deny it he didn't say i'm not your master he didn't deny it so by implication he acknowledges her as my student right by definition disciple jesus said unto her touch me not she's turned to him my master don't don't touch me don't touch me i'm not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them that i ascend to my father and your father to my god and your god mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and she had spo and that he had spoken these things under her she's a faithful witness whoa it was true what he said now i know what it means because god has interpreted his word by bringing it to pass and i've seen it so she knew that jesus said he'd return from the grave this is the third day why no one else was there was not her concern she just had to come and see not to scoff or doubt but to see what's going on here well why did mary see the angels and peter and john at virtually the same moment didn't they took their heads out they got out of the tomb they headed out she put her head in and there was angels there did they wait for john and peter to leave and then they suddenly appeared i don't think so i of course this is just me this is speculation right but but peter and john and the others they'd witnessed jesus ministry at as had mary peter and john and the other disciples they had participated in it preaching and teaching and healing and delivering having power over evil spirits they were the ushers sitting the crowds oh there's five thousand sit them down here in groups of fifty and then we'll feed these five thousand people right they were the deacons right serving the meal they were the cleanup crew right they issued the prayer cards and jesus said let the children come right we have no record of any of those men being delivered or demons or devils or evil spirits coming out of them but mary magdalene had seven devils cast out of her she wasn't just managing the prayer line she was in the prayer line she had that spiritual experience and like elisha praying that the eyes of his servant might be open to see the host the chariots of fire that were around them to protect them from the syrians so mary was privileged to see the angels seated in the tomb not peter not john they were looking for a corpse but mary was looking for a living lord she didn't understand she'd heard and believed even though she didn't understand she still believed that she didn't claim some special revelation she didn't claim some interpretation i'm going to go to the tomb and i'm going to see two angels and no no nothing dramatic about it she was just open to receive whatever the lord had for her whatever he meant when he told her that he would rise again on the third day and she didn't just sit back and say well if he rises again on the third day he knows my address he'll come here no she put action to her face she went looking for him she put herself in danger she put herself at risk and she of all the followers of jesus of all the disciples was the first to see him john tells the story mark attests to it let's let's look here in mark now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils he doesn't record that but it happened but he tells us that it had happened right and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not it wasn't just the 11 or the 12 and it wasn't just the men that scoffed at her testimony well that doesn't match my revelation of what jesus meant well that's not how i heard the prophet proclaim it no the other women it says then that had been with him also doubted her story she was alone oh mary you get so emotional you've had a terrible shock look peter and john were there at the same time and they didn't see any angels they didn't encounter jesus you're hallucinating or the strains just too much you've always had such an imagination mary and look at you you've run back and forth you're exhausted all this running about and in the dark besides you're lucky you weren't accosted have a cup of tea dear it'll soothe you well let's pick up the story again maybe the the other mary might have turned to mary magdalene and says something like let's go to the tomb dear together so we'll be safe enough it'll soon be light you'll see it's just your nervous disposition come on now i'll go with you let's go so what does matthew tell us about this in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn it's no longer dark it's we're getting right there we're getting the light for the day the first day they became mary magdalene and the other mary to see this evil car and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door the stone had not been rolled back it was displaced now it's rolled back and this angel his countenance was like lightning his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became his dead men that takes care of the guards easy to get past them they're just knocked out the angel answered and said to the women fiernachi for i know that you seek jesus who was crucified now that's an interesting way that that angel expresses that to these two ladies because one believes that he's risen and is seen and the other believes that that hasn't happened but to say that you're looking for jesus who was crucified is an accurate statement to both of them so what goes on he's not here now he's talking to both of these ladies he has risen well now the other mary understands that he has risen he has risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay so he's inviting them ladies come right on into the tomb here you can just come and see for yourself come on in and go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and behold he goes before you to galilee and you'll see him there i i've told you okay now now come on go inside it's okay go go on now go on now we'll pick up the story in mark's account and entering into the sepulcher undoubtedly with some trepidation having cautiously accepted the invitation of the angel perched on the stone they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted affrighted trembling shaking i'd say they were scared spitless and he said unto them be not a frighted you seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he's risen he's not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you went to galilee there you shall see him as he said unto you so we have two angel witnesses there's one message right in the mouth of two or three witnesses god abides by his own word he's given them two witnesses and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulcher they were running as fast as they could for they trembled and were amazed neither said anything to any man for they were afraid god's got a sense of humor duh they were afraid yeah yeah well let's get back now we're synchronized here with matthew's gospel and they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word oh dear you were right mary there are two angels here now don't say i told you so and as they went through the country slowing down as the adrenaline wears off maybe stopping to catch their breath slowed down to a walk mary magdalene has run almost i don't know a marathon or something right now this lady is tired okay so what's going on as they went through the countryside and they were scared and it's one thing for somebody to tell you don't be afraid they're holding a knife to your throat maybe and saying don't be afraid yeah right right it's one thing to be told not to be afraid it's another to actually set your fear aside so they slowed to a walk hearts pounding palms sweating panting gulping air and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them saying all hail hi you too right and they came and held them by the feet and worshiped him now this is the second time that mary magdalene has seen jesus the first time to me now it's okay for her to grab him by the ankles then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there they shall see me but the same message that the two angels had given them to do now now mark we'll get back to mark now he tells of this encounter with tale but he includes the reaction of the disciples to these two ladies story mark 16 says after that he formed two of them as they walked and went into the country another form they grabbed him by the feet the first encounter mary magdalene was instructed not to touch them another form went into the country that's a space between the tomb in the city the country the countryside some people the two people on the road to emmaus is what this is referring to no no because and they went and told it to the residue the people that were still gathered neither believed they them so the pair of the road to emmaus they already knew that jesus was risen peter had seen him they accepted the report they were rejoicing this reported these two they're not accepting it this is mary magdalene and the other mary a group of women the group that are prepared spices before the sabbath mary and mary and solomon purchase spices after the sabbath we've got two groups here and that other group the ones that had prepared the the spices ahead of time they went to the tomb they met two angels they didn't see jesus they arrived to share their news they arrived about the same time that mary and mary arrived luke records that mary and mary were reporting we just read earlier where peter left after this report and went down to the tomb by himself okay while you're taking up a look recall the two on the road to emmaus we know one is collapse luke tells us it was reasonable that the unidentified companion of columbus was his wife would he have just left her in jerusalem after all this turmoil and stuff and he's heading back home and she's back there and he's chatting with one of his buddies possible but why would he why would he leave her behind i don't know regardless regardless of who his companion was they both rushed to jerusalem and we read they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together then that were with them saying the lord has risen indeed it appeared to simon so again they got to the group and the group was already discussing that jesus had been risen that he had appeared to simon and then they got their turn to share and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known to them in breaking of bread now we know that thomas left somewhere because they came testimony jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you that's when he comes right we read that in philippians think on these things whatsoever things are of a good report true honest that's what they were doing and he showed up just like he shows up here just like tonight but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed they had seen a spirit and he said unto them maybe he did an eye roll why are you troubled why do thoughts arise in your hearts you've heard these testimonies you know that i'm alive hello what's up with you people don't you believe anything that i told you he says behold my hands my feet it's me touch me handle me spirit doesn't have flesh and bones you see that i do and when did this spoke and he showed them his hands and his feet well up to now just prior to jesus entering this room with these folks he's appeared four times four we're told is the number associated with man to five people five right the number of grace first he appeared to mary magdalene then again to mary magdalene and the other mary then we're told he appeared to peter at some point and then there's the two on the road to emmaus now his fifth appearing even more grace to the gathered group the 11 plus others except thomas left he's not there we're told thomas one of the twelve called didymus we think of doubting thomas did he miss doesn't mean doubting didymus means twin either he had a a twin brother or sister or he was a doppelganger a dead ringer for one of the disciples or maybe even for jesus himself but thomas was not with them when jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord there's a lot of witnesses now people that thomas had spent years with people that he should know how to trust how to believe but he said unto them except i see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand to his side i will not believe you guys i don't know what's happened i don't know what's going on i don't know it's got a hold of you but you're nuts okay so after eight days again they're gathered together and thomas was with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then he said to thomas reach hither thy finger behold my hands reach into the hand thrust in my side be not faithless but believe that was enough thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god there's no record of him actually poking jesus he saw it that was enough and jesus said thomas because you have seen me you've believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed this is jesus calling us who have not seen his physical resurrected body but have accepted the testimony of other witnesses thomas wouldn't accept those testimonies but those of us that have accepted those testimonies jesus says we're blessed why do we believe those testimonies because the holy spirit leads us into all truth and those testimonies are true of him who is the truth if the musicians would uh please come at this time and today i've got a challenge for you and a challenge for me we're in this together right today is the anniversary of thomas's encounter it's the eighth day right it was easter a week ago now it's the eighth day this is this is diddy miss sunday right thomas sunday but my question do we still harbor doubt do we still discount the testimony of others as thomas did do we only trust our own experiences just like thomas because again to paraphrase brother john andes from last week it's sunday and pentecost is coming it's only 42 more days are you ready am i for what brother lyle are you making some prediction no no but the dynamics came an outpouring of his spirit like they'd never experienced can't we look forward to the same thing don't we have the right to expect if that expectation is in our heart perhaps god will honor it let's return to our roots let's enter the book of acts acts 2 chapter 1 when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place they were gathered in one place and one accord both conditions one accord brother green has told us that the greatest miracle the new testament is you get 120 jews in one room and agreeing on something but but but but one accord look one of the disciples was called simon the zealot what was a zealot this is a political term the zealots were a violent group dedicated to armed rebellion to overthrow the yeoman yoke and bring about a new jewish kingdom think of them as a jewish equivalent of isis they were out there to wreak havoc to tear apart the structure so that the messiah could come so that the kingdom could be restored sitting next to him sitting next to simon the zealot is matthew collaborator a guy who collected taxes for the romans from his own people he collected money and handed it over to the enemy these two guys had enough of the spirit of god about them that they could sit next to each other to the point that they were on one accord they didn't have to stand toe-to-toe and violently disagree and still love each other they could finally agree matthew and simon who couldn't be more different seated together verse 15 peter's now addressing the crowd he says these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it's about the third hour of the day what third hour of the day about 9 a.m here we're talking about the third hour of daylight and this is another anniversary because what happened at the third hour on good friday that's when jesus was crucified that's when the morning sacrifice was made these are not drunk these are not intoxicated what what what happens when a person is mildly intoxicated it removes their inhibitions the veneer is stripped away instead of projecting the persona that they want you to see you begin to see what's really in the person maybe you see them maybe you see the spirit of god in them maybe you see some other spirit in them right pentecost 42 days six weeks what is that may the may the 13th or something i challenge us to be ready not to get ready but to be ready be like mary magdalene believe don't doubt be looking for jesus not the legend not the memory not the story not your interpretation in spite of your uncertainties in spite of any hesitations in spite of personal risk the living christ here in our midst be somewhere listening for your name like mary when she heard her name she knew it was him robonai my master my teacher as brother aaron comes to close the service maybe we could sing i was gonna sing i'll be somewhere listening but i'm thinking maybe i'd rather sing he is here he is here is here hallelujah he is here [Music] he is here listen closely hear him calling out your name mary he is here you can touch him you will never be the same he [Music] is to his name he is here he is his name again [Music] you can [Music] we have the advantage the privilege to read the scriptures but put yourself back in that time how would you have reacted what would you have thought what would be written about you how you reacted how your reaction today would have been how you are he's alive yes as peter cry out he's alive and i'm forgiven can you imagine beating peter but i denied him i turned my back on him i cursed about him i said i never been around him they're looking at him and say you talk like him you look like him if you say nev you've never been around why are you acting that way why are you talking that way and he tried to be like them but that wasn't peter let go and let god let him be could it have really happened that way they were like you and me i was thinking of that song how beautiful the feet of those who bring good news could you imagine mary the other mary all of them the news they gave he's

might get the light i appreciate the grace and the mercy of god that he would take people and record the story people like me and you who had questions who at times had doubts full of fear at times other times running down the road full blast not sure why but just go find out god's mercy i always remember and tell peter too i'm glad i was included in that are you i thank the lord for his word
