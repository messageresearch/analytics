[33:19] who took on flesh
[33:22] fullness of god in
[33:24] helpless pain
[33:26] this gift of love
[33:28] and righteousness
[33:31] scorned by the ones he came
[33:34] to say
[33:36] till on that cross
[33:38] says jesus died
[33:41] the wrath of god was satisfied
[33:45] for every sin

[33:50] here in the death of
[33:52] christ i live
[33:56] there in the ground

[39:06] or this robe that we wear now
[39:09] has been reckoned to god as
[39:11] righteousness through christ jesus
[39:15] and we're not taking the moth eaten robe
[39:18] of some man's theology who's been eaten
[39:21] up with malls and crickets and so forth
[39:24] saying that the days of miracles has
[39:26] passed and there's no such a thing as
[39:29] the ominous presence of the holy spirit
[39:32] now
[39:33] but we are wearing a robe of his
[39:37] righteousness
[39:38] not in our own abilities but in the uh
[39:42] the ability of our lord jesus
[39:45] and when i come down to the jordan i
[39:47] want to have on his robe
[39:51] trusting in his
[39:53] and the great shadow of the gate that's
[39:55] set before us all
[39:57] called
[39:58] death each time our heart beats we go
[40:00] one feet closer to that great gas
[40:03] that every man and woman must go through
[40:06] and when i come to that gap
[40:08] along with you believers i'm so happy to
[40:11] know that i'm not going there with this
[40:15] in my heart and mind that i have done
[40:17] something great
[40:18] i'm going there confessing and knowing
[40:21] that i'm a sinner and knowing this that
[40:23] i want to wrap myself in the robes of
[40:25] his righteousnesses
[40:27] with this testimony that i know him in
[40:29] the power of his resurrection
[40:31] that when he calls from the dead i want
[40:34] to come out
[40:35] now
[40:36] our scene and drama is set tonight for
[40:39] our text
[40:40] of uh another day in israel which was
[40:43] about
[40:44] several hundred years
[40:46] past uh the time of elijah
[40:49] many ups and downs had come
[40:51] and the reign of israel
[40:54] and now we're at the scene tonight
[40:57] this morning we were at the scene
[40:59] of where there was a lot of carnal
[41:01] impersonation
[41:03] out of the school of prophecy were up
[41:05] there training to be prophets
[41:08] and how simple they were they even they
[41:10] couldn't understand the power of god
[41:12] they thought the power had lifted elijah
[41:14] up and thrown him out on the mountain
[41:15] somewhere and they sent a search party
[41:17] to hunt for him when elisha knew good
[41:20] and well that god had taken him to glory
[41:24] or he was not
[41:26] god had taken him and he escaped death
[41:29] by going home to god on a chariot of
[41:32] fire and horse's defined
[41:34] and then we seen that their
[41:36] seminaries and their
[41:37] uh works of their own theology this work
[41:41] has taken the election and calling of
[41:44] god
[41:45] to make a prophet of god
[41:47] and now tonight we find israel in a
[41:50] backslidden condition
[41:53] israel had its ups and downs it was the
[41:56] very type of the church today
[41:59] sometime they were on the house off the
[42:01] next time they were down in the valley
[42:03] that's what takes to make us appreciate
[42:06] the good things
[42:07] there's what they call the law contract
[42:10] the black man of africa never knows
[42:13] that he was black his skin until he seen
[42:15] david livingston
[42:17] and he said then he realized he skinned
[42:20] us back because living since it's white
[42:22] it's a contrast you would never know how
[42:25] to appreciate a day if you didn't have a
[42:28] night
[42:29] you'll never know how to appreciate the
[42:30] sunshine if you didn't have a cloudy day
[42:33] you would never know how to appreciate
[42:35] righteousness unless uh you had had some
[42:38] unrighteousness
[42:40] you would never know how to appreciate
[42:42] good health unless you've had some foul
[42:44] health some bad health
[42:46] it's only those and that's the reason i
[42:48] think that we'll appreciate heaven so
[42:50] much because we've lived on earth once
[42:52] since and i
[42:54] think the law of contrast
[42:57] the reason that we appreciate the holy
[42:59] spirit so much tonight is because we
[43:01] live salon
[43:02] in a church that told us there wasn't
[43:04] such a thing
[43:05] the reason we appreciate it tonight
[43:07] because we have had the other side
[43:09] and that's the way god has intended it
[43:11] to be because his people has had their
[43:14] ups and downs you never know how to
[43:16] appreciate a mountaintop unless you've
[43:18] been in the valley
[43:19] and so
[43:20] you never know how to appreciate good
[43:22] water unless you drink some bad
[43:24] sometimes
[43:25] and then yeah
[43:27] yeah all the way through it's the law of
[43:29] contract
[43:30] now
[43:31] israel was in one of its backslidden
[43:34] states
[43:35] and what a thing they had done now
[43:38] israel was a chosen
[43:41] elected selected people
[43:44] that god had chose israel for one
[43:47] specific purpose
[43:48] that the blood of israel should be the
[43:50] cleanest bloodstream
[43:52] for out of that leanish was going to
[43:55] come the messiah himself
[43:58] all down through the old testament god
[44:01] appeared in man
[44:03] god appeared in abraham
[44:05] as a faith believer
[44:08] god appeared in david as a king
[44:12] he appeared in joseph as righteousness
[44:15] he appeared in moses as prophet priest
[44:19] law giver
[44:20] he appeared down to the ages and the
[44:22] prophets
[44:24] he always made himself known in man and
[44:27] potion through prophet king priest law
[44:30] giver so forth but in christ he
[44:34] dwelt in him the fullness
[44:36] of the godhead bodily
[44:39] and knowing that this spirit must
[44:41] finally
[44:42] find a resting place
[44:45] on elijah
[44:46] he was a man of god justice he
[44:50] uh plated out the justice of god
[44:53] and moses he was a lawgiver that you
[44:56] told the mark or get out
[44:58] and all these things god represented but
[45:01] when he came to christ he was perfect
[45:03] the entire
[45:05] fullness of the godhead bodyweight
[45:08] rested in christ
[45:10] and god represented himself once in the
[45:12] fullest beforehand
[45:14] in the book of genesis in the order of
[45:16] melchizedek who had no father no mother
[45:20] no beginning of days or ending of years
[45:22] or ending of life
[45:24] and he was a priest the king of salem
[45:28] a priest of god of the most high god
[45:31] who was without beginning or without
[45:34] ending he was none other than the
[45:36] pre-figure of the lord jesus christ
[45:39] because he was the king of salem which
[45:41] is the king of peace which is the king
[45:43] of jerusalem
[45:44] and he was in free figure
[45:47] even if patriarch abraham paid tithe to
[45:50] him
[45:51] he was a pre-figure of the coming of the
[45:53] lord jesus
[45:55] the same melchizedek met abraham out of
[45:57] the planes before this destroying of
[45:59] sodom and gomorrah
[46:00] and and he met him after sodom and
[46:03] gomorrah when abraham paid him the
[46:04] timings of all the spoils that he taken
[46:06] from the king
[46:08] all these things this shadow
[46:11] typed up to christ and now all the
[46:15] shadows of the old testament saints
[46:17] their ups and downs was a shadow and
[46:20] type and examples for us today
[46:22] now we find that israel was not the
[46:25] mismarriage
[46:27] their marriage was to be among one
[46:30] another
[46:31] not no israelite to ever marry a gentile
[46:35] but was to keep their bloodstream clean
[46:38] and even until this day
[46:40] i believe the jewish bloodstream is the
[46:42] cleanest blood bloodstream on the face
[46:45] the earth today
[46:46] is the jews
[46:47] they're still looking for that messiah
[46:50] but he's we know that he has already
[46:52] come and their eyes were blinded that we
[46:54] could have a chance of repentance
[46:57] through christ
[46:58] now
[46:59] during the time of the reign of ezra
[47:02] the children of israel
[47:04] had become
[47:05] vaccines
[47:07] they had went out and got to mobinite
[47:09] women and they had got the women of the
[47:12] amorites
[47:14] the persianites and many of the other
[47:16] nations and had not only had married
[47:20] them but was committing fornications
[47:23] among them
[47:24] uncleansing it
[47:26] and polluting the very bloodstream which
[47:28] is the live stream
[47:32] and what a picture that is today
[47:35] of our churches the way they're falling
[47:38] away
[47:39] from the
[47:41] old-fashioned
[47:43] viewing line
[47:44] that god laid down for the church the
[47:47] precepts that we were to live by the
[47:50] church is committing fornication with
[47:52] the world
[47:54] got out into the world and began to die
[47:57] in the world
[47:59] now
[48:01] this had embarrassed the prophet so much
[48:04] so when he come before god he blushed in
[48:07] his face
[48:09] the first one he heard about
[48:11] and he seen the
[48:12] moral decay
[48:14] of his people it hurt him so bad
[48:18] until he sat down and anointed himself
[48:21] plucked his hair out and his beard out
[48:24] and was
[48:25] heavy-hearted before the lord in prayer
[48:28] then when the evening sacrifices offered
[48:31] he went into the temple and fell on his
[48:34] knees and blushed before god for the
[48:37] sins of the people
[48:39] night in blush for the scarlet street of
[48:43] the red light district
[48:45] he didn't blush for the booze drinkers
[48:48] and the hellholes although as bad as it
[48:51] may be
[48:52] but he blushed because the sin of the
[48:55] elect
[48:57] and what we need to take is some more
[49:01] prophets with enough god in their heart
[49:04] to blush in the presence of god for the
[49:07] sins of the people who call themselves
[49:10] the people of god and doing the way
[49:12] they're doing
[49:14] what a disgrace we brought to this place
[49:17] the morals of our people this is not an
[49:20] easy subject to speak on
[49:22] i could think of many things that were
[49:24] easier to speak on
[49:26] but brother if somebody
[49:28] don't stand out in this
[49:31] simple adulterous day that we live in
[49:34] and
[49:35] call the course
[49:38] what's going to happen
[49:40] somebody has got to speak to things
[49:43] somebody's got to place it before the
[49:45] people
[49:46] perhaps ezra didn't want to do it but it
[49:49] was in his heart
[49:51] and when you see a servant of god get so
[49:54] sincere so he's on his face with his
[49:58] hands in the air
[50:00] of
[50:01] praying to god and blessing because the
[50:04] iniquity of the people then you're going
[50:07] to see a revival start
[50:09] a man cannot lay in the presence of god
[50:12] a church cannot stay in the presence of
[50:15] god under repentance unless the holy
[50:18] spirit comes down and gives function and
[50:21] power the sorrow move of god in that
[50:23] among those people
[50:25] just got to thee
[50:27] show me a man
[50:28] show me another calvin not any stinky or
[50:32] any of those who feels the burden of the
[50:35] people that'll lay on their face and cry
[50:38] and pray before god send us to john
[50:40] smith of the baptist church again who
[50:42] prayed all night for the iniquity of the
[50:45] people until his eyes would be swelled
[50:48] shut the next morning from weeping until
[50:50] his wife for leading to the table and
[50:51] feeding his breakfast out of his food
[50:55] show me of john wesley again our power
[50:58] brand that's from the five i'll show you
[51:00] a revival what we're doing today we're
[51:04] patting it on the back we're calling it
[51:06] this and that in the revival when
[51:08] there's no revival to it
[51:10] right
[51:12] there's a stirring of emotion
[51:15] of religion among the people but no
[51:17] revival
[51:19] they had a religious group in that day
[51:22] they had a stirs in that day but they
[51:25] needed a revival
[51:27] why my dear brother and sister the
[51:29] morals of this nation has become so long
[51:31] till it would make a dog ashamed
[51:34] it would make a helm blush
[51:38] if it could do so
[51:39] the immorals of our people the people
[51:42] even
[51:43] years ago
[51:44] the things that we have that the nation
[51:46] has done
[51:48] the things that the people have done
[51:51] it's all the lack of prayers
[51:54] the church that used to
[51:56] didn't believe and picture shows
[51:59] they wouldn't let their children go to
[52:00] picture show they would shun picture
[52:03] shows and today
[52:05] while they even have they had the
[52:08] picture show their own house
[52:11] every house has a television
[52:14] in the place where they used to think it
[52:16] was wrong to drink beer
[52:19] in a place where they used to take john
[52:21] farley home what a great honoree fellow
[52:24] he was today
[52:26] 60
[52:27] of so-called christians take a social
[52:29] rank at least once a year
[52:32] then they get on a big spree around
[52:34] christmas when they have their
[52:35] celebrations
[52:37] because they have adopted
[52:40] education to take the place of salvation
[52:43] it'll never do it
[52:46] what we need is a revival
[52:48] we put corn plasters on
[52:50] take them off and another corn plaster
[52:52] and take it off and still find the pain
[52:55] is there
[52:56] what we need today is not
[52:58] social regeneration
[53:00] it's not intellectual talks
[53:02] what we need today is an old-fashioned
[53:05] god textbook transfusion from heaven
[53:09] the corn plasters won't do no good
[53:11] we are anemia amen we need a blood
[53:15] transfusion
[53:16] we need to come back to the
[53:17] old-fashioned gospel that calls out for
[53:20] repentance before god
[53:23] and not a dry eyed
[53:25] handshake protection
[53:28] but a god-sent holy ghost revival with
[53:31] the possession of the cleansing of the
[53:33] blood of the lord jesus christ in every
[53:35] human heart
[53:36] we need a revival to target the church
[53:39] and sweep the nation across
[53:41] we'll die we'll perish we are gone
[53:44] without that type of revival
[53:47] i'm so sick and tired of seeing little
[53:50] petty hollywood revival so-called
[53:53] where people come in and get emotionally
[53:56] stirred up for a couple hours and or a
[53:58] day or two or a week or two and go out
[54:01] and that's all of it
[54:02] brother
[54:03] you can be uh worked up
[54:06] by revival
[54:08] you can have emotion you can have good
[54:10] intentions
[54:11] all those things are fine but we don't
[54:14] need that today
[54:15] we need a baptism of the holy spirit to
[54:20] change the oceans and the intellect and
[54:22] the abuse the habits the life of the
[54:25] people and put them back on the right
[54:27] road again
[54:29] outside of the blood transfusions and
[54:31] calories all of our reformations won't
[54:34] do any good at all
[54:35] we don't need a union we have a you in
[54:38] there what they do god's name is never
[54:40] called
[54:41] they're afraid to call us he was once
[54:44] asked by the perjury group why didn't
[54:46] they have prayer they said it might have
[54:48] been somebody else or the others who
[54:50] didn't believe in god
[54:51] oh what we need is a revival
[54:54] don't make a difference
[54:56] we've got to preach the gospel
[55:00] i wouldn't give you a time for any
[55:02] program at least
[55:05] whether it's a you enter a big four or
[55:06] whatever it might be
[55:08] until this nation wakes up to the place
[55:11] that we're dying without the blood of
[55:13] the lord jesus christ until individuals
[55:16] wake up to this to their calls
[55:18] that we're dying the reason we are dying
[55:21] is without the original the way the
[55:25] remedy the cure
[55:27] that god gave us the calvary
[55:29] oh wonder it makes a man blush don't
[55:32] wonder a real true preacher look upon
[55:34] his congregation
[55:36] and try to lead them before the throne
[55:38] of god
[55:39] and visit their homes and find them
[55:42] smoking cigarettes
[55:45] telling dirty jokes to each other
[55:47] entertaining in the backyard with your
[55:50] party
[55:52] walking around on the streets for young
[55:54] women in middle age and so forth and
[55:56] even grandmother with a little shorts on
[55:59] mother out on the street with a baby on
[56:01] one arm just sexy enough to attract the
[56:04] attention of any food flavors off the
[56:06] street
[56:07] and calling themselves christians it'll
[56:10] make any true man of god blessed to
[56:12] bring such a person in the presence of
[56:14] god
[56:15] right
[56:16] and all of our joining church and
[56:18] getting a better class has come to
[56:21] nonsense and it did in that day and it
[56:23] will just bring us back to clubs not
[56:27] with the injection of education that was
[56:30] an injection of religious revelation
[56:33] not in the uh injection of some kind of
[56:36] man-made theology but an old-fashioned
[56:39] baptism of the holy ghost anger god out
[56:42] of heaven in a pentecostal experience
[56:45] of burning out the clarity and replacing
[56:48] in there the jew is caught into being
[56:51] there of the son and daughter of god
[56:55] till we do that brothers and sisters we
[56:58] will still have bob's hair makeup on
[57:01] sexy looking women and men drinking
[57:04] smoke and they call themselves
[57:05] christians because they don't know no
[57:08] better and their heart but very rude of
[57:10] carnality laser and we need a church
[57:13] cleaning up from the basement to the
[57:15] full field
[57:16] [Applause]
[57:19] and that's right
[57:21] what we needed is some blush in progress
[57:24] god sometimes people come to prayer
[57:28] to be prayed for looks like they're
[57:30] going to a house of real fame
[57:33] right
[57:34] coming to ask god for something looking
[57:36] like a jezebel
[57:38] probably need a day
[57:45] [Applause]
[57:47] and tell what's right what's wrong and
[57:49] preach the gospel without compromising
[57:52] until sinners paul is foreign
[57:56] oh god sends the holy spirit to being
[57:58] obedient
[58:00] amen
[58:01] that's right amen
[58:05] i preached here not long ago and said
[58:07] that every woman in this city was guilty
[58:09] in one way or the other but adultery
[58:12] they are
[58:13] but women go downtown here and they can
[58:15] hardly buy a dress
[58:17] unless it's so like they're important
[58:19] i'm not here to this is my own church i
[58:22] would like to preach what the holy
[58:24] spirit tells me to do
[58:26] let me tell you i'm not criticizing you
[58:28] my sister
[58:30] but don't the holy spirit teach you
[58:32] different
[58:34] if it doesn't i'm praying you didn't get
[58:36] the holy spirit
[58:38] right the holy spirit's not shouting the
[58:41] holy spirit start tasting in the spirit
[58:43] the holy spirit's not speaking in
[58:45] tongues
[58:46] the holy spirit is righteousness
[58:49] [Music]
[58:58] that when you dress yourself like that
[59:00] and walk down the street and man looked
[59:01] at you in the wrong way that at the
[59:03] judgment you may be as pure as the lady
[59:06] before your husband but as a judgment
[59:08] you'll be guilty of committing a doctor
[59:10] with the god that you've presented
[59:11] yourself to
[59:14] wonder it will make a person
[59:16] so wonderful
[59:18] when the bible said in the beginning
[59:20] that it grieved him that he made man
[59:23] he grieved the heart of god when he
[59:25] looked upon him in the days before the
[59:26] anti-losing destruction that he ever
[59:28] made a man
[59:30] what happened
[59:31] the sons of god saw the daughters of man
[59:34] would stand
[59:35] it was a perversion
[59:38] it was a sex mix-up
[59:40] it was that thing that drove the
[59:42] children of god from the garden of eden
[59:45] it was that thing that drove god's
[59:47] judgment to bring uh peace upon the
[59:50] earth
[59:51] it was that thing that caused and
[59:52] destroyed it was that same mixing up
[59:55] between women and man that caused sodom
[59:58] the lord is sinking the bottom of the
[1:00:00] dead sea
[1:00:01] he was told by the prophet he was told
[1:00:03] by the lord jesus that as it was in
[1:00:06] those days so will it be before the
[1:00:08] coming of the son of god
[1:00:11] we look today and see that the church is
[1:00:14] taking this pattern not out of the bible
[1:00:16] out of ruth and out of neoma and out of
[1:00:19] sarah and the ones in the bible but
[1:00:22] their pattern even the women of the
[1:00:23] church after hollywood and the very
[1:00:26] dragons of the devil
[1:00:29] how there are people who call themselves
[1:00:31] christians go out there and get this
[1:00:33] evil man's ways these records of evilest
[1:00:36] presley hear what his name is one of the
[1:00:38] most deluded
[1:00:39] stable possessed
[1:00:42] arthur godfrey and such as that and
[1:00:45] listen to them kind of nonsense on your
[1:00:47] radios and refuse to hear the gospel
[1:00:50] sermons preached in the bible
[1:00:53] god had mercy on you what kind of a
[1:00:56] spirit have we got among them
[1:00:58] that is right
[1:01:00] no wonder the prophet of god flesh
[1:01:02] before the lord he knew that was
[1:01:05] unrighteous and he stood and pleaded
[1:01:07] with him and say to god we're
[1:01:10] unrighteous
[1:01:11] and we are friends and until we can come
[1:01:14] back to that spot
[1:01:16] of a blood transfusion quit trying to
[1:01:18] put on plaster
[1:01:19] quit trying to put on some sag
[1:01:22] the healing can't come unless the
[1:01:24] bloodstream's right
[1:01:28] that's the reason if people got diabetes
[1:01:31] if one would ever cut itself
[1:01:33] it probably will never eat
[1:01:36] why because the real red blood cells is
[1:01:39] eat up
[1:01:41] and the whole church has become diabetic
[1:01:45] and every little cup that comes instead
[1:01:47] of walking on your pickaxe
[1:01:49] it can heal
[1:01:51] selfishness greed
[1:01:53] immorality everything else is in the
[1:01:56] calendar of god's wrong duty
[1:01:58] the church is picking up those habits
[1:02:01] man drinking smoking telling dirty jokes
[1:02:05] women cutting their hair wearing makeup
[1:02:07] doing all kinds of things dressing
[1:02:09] themselves immorally the face of people
[1:02:12] all those things are because it's the
[1:02:14] last of the blood of the lord jesus
[1:02:16] christ
[1:02:22] that may seem hard sure it's hard but
[1:02:24] it's the truth
[1:02:26] if we don't bash force the judgments of
[1:02:28] almighty cup you're going to be caught
[1:02:31] one of these days in an atomic explosion
[1:02:33] here that will send every soul out into
[1:02:36] eternity to be the god who only
[1:02:38] recognize the blood of his son christ
[1:02:40] jesus
[1:02:41] my advice to see you have come under the
[1:02:43] land
[1:02:44] my advice is to get back inside
[1:02:48] can't we have faith
[1:02:49] why can't we have greater healing than
[1:02:51] we do
[1:02:52] why can't we get ourselves poundability
[1:02:55] it's because we're putting on corn
[1:02:57] plasters
[1:02:58] because we're putting on stickers
[1:03:00] putting all pieces of tape
[1:03:03] we are trying to cover this thing up
[1:03:05] instead of saying we need a transfusion
[1:03:07] amen
[1:03:10] we're without love
[1:03:12] we're without crime
[1:03:14] don't let yourself be fooled don't let
[1:03:15] the devil pass you on the shoulders say
[1:03:17] well i go to church the devil does too
[1:03:20] brian be sure to come up to god went to
[1:03:23] church up in heaven
[1:03:24] come before the son of god with the sons
[1:03:26] of god set out with him
[1:03:28] had an audience with god he said where
[1:03:30] you've been to walk if you're in florida
[1:03:32] on the earth
[1:03:33] that's where you've been so the devil
[1:03:35] goes to church
[1:03:37] the devil belongs to church
[1:03:40] the devil acts like a christian
[1:03:43] he's a deceiver
[1:03:45] if he doesn't act like a christian and
[1:03:47] act like a church he would be a deceiver
[1:03:50] nobody could be deceiving his
[1:03:52] differences back and why is contrary to
[1:03:55] one another
[1:03:56] but the bible said that it'd be supposed
[1:03:58] to be to see the very elected party man
[1:04:02] that spirit in the last days friends are
[1:04:04] there
[1:04:05] it's time for the prophets of god
[1:04:08] oh brother for the preachers if you
[1:04:11] would say
[1:04:12] across the nation to follow their faith
[1:04:15] well i know there's 19 million baptist
[1:04:18] churches
[1:04:19] 19 million baptist brothers in america
[1:04:22] 13 million methods

[1:04:31] and constantly the ball game
[1:04:34] the amusement
[1:04:36] and on wednesday night and sometimes on
[1:04:39] sunday night stay home to listen to the
[1:04:42] television and the radios of old drugs
[1:04:45] gags and jokes they pull from hollywood

[1:04:50] when your horse has your bible out
[1:04:52] somewhere laying out before god on your
[1:04:54] knees of praying for the sins of the
[1:04:56] country and i'm guilty with you

[1:06:53] and god has made us an example
[1:06:56] to the people and to thank the nature
[1:06:58] god's
[1:06:59] [Music]
[1:07:03] of the world and become a very spiritual
[1:07:05] anemia
[1:07:06] are we ought to be in a lack
[1:07:09] that sit on the hill
[1:07:11] our candle that cannot be heard
[1:07:17] [Music]

[1:07:24] that when men and women walk in that
[1:07:26] door on crutches

[1:07:36] [Music]
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:50] and it blushes us in the presence of god
[1:07:52] the pain that the things that he's done
[1:07:54] for us how he's lifting us up from the
[1:07:57] shoot corner
[1:07:58] how he's made us known all over the
[1:08:00] world how he's done the great pain part
[1:08:03] and yet we really got him
[1:08:06] manual around and go out and we're not
[1:08:09] seem to be sincere we don't have prayer
[1:08:11] anymore
[1:08:12] things just don't like going live
[1:08:15] and we're trying to put on those
[1:08:16] programs corn plasters to ease the pain
[1:08:20] you can't ease the pain until you get
[1:08:21] good rich blood in there
[1:08:24] heal the things
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:27] you cut a little corn out you'll get
[1:08:29] yourself a diabetes and take your foot
[1:08:31] off
[1:08:32] don't try to dismiss this and bypass
[1:08:35] this and cut a corn plaster on this but
[1:08:37] the thing to do is come straight out
[1:08:39] before god and say god i am anemia and i
[1:08:42] need your blood to cleanse me from oh my
[1:08:44] god
[1:08:44] that's my prayer trust that it's yours
[1:08:47] think of these things friends
[1:08:49] one of these days it just is apt to
[1:08:53] happen before daylight in the morning as
[1:08:55] it is that happened 50 years and today
[1:08:58] one rocket bomb
[1:09:01] one of those coba are hydrogen bombs
[1:09:04] because the whole nation is on the
[1:09:07] learning
[1:09:08] you see in the paper the other day where
[1:09:09] they were requiring something the
[1:09:12] pentagon to answer the flying saucers
[1:09:16] it was a myth
[1:09:18] it wasn't something it imagined
[1:09:20] it was real
[1:09:22] it was an intelligence
[1:09:24] they flew in battle formation
[1:09:27] they could stop they could start
[1:09:29] they could spot they could tell
[1:09:31] it was an intelligence
[1:09:33] they knew it the people laughed they
[1:09:36] said flying soldiers made a fun out of
[1:09:38] it
[1:09:39] but you know what i'm thinking
[1:09:41] jesus said before he comes there will be
[1:09:44] signs in the heaven of us
[1:09:48] did you notice before he started or
[1:09:50] destroyed psalm anymore because of their
[1:09:52] sex affairs
[1:09:53] he sent angels down to investigators
[1:09:58] angels has come to the earth in the last
[1:10:00] few years
[1:10:01] they've been seen among people
[1:10:04] i mean honest bloodborish people
[1:10:07] who knows it they've even stood and had
[1:10:10] their pictures taken
[1:10:14] angelic bees has visited taking words
[1:10:18] back to the power that stand us heap
[1:10:20] towards pirates can hardly shine
[1:10:23] boom the whole worlds are really like a
[1:10:26] drunk man coming in at night
[1:10:28] right then among the christians among
[1:10:31] the elect they stole their birthright
[1:10:34] out for popularity
[1:10:36] the minister has swapped the gospel for
[1:10:39] a social calling
[1:10:40] he sparked the old-fashioned blood voice
[1:10:43] gospel for intellectual uh
[1:10:47] uh
[1:10:48] with the people
[1:10:49] that preach intellect talk of society
[1:10:53] and misuse the gospel
[1:10:56] many of them have went out into the
[1:10:58] field of preaching and used the gospel
[1:11:01] for personal gains
[1:11:03] to make money
[1:11:04] many of them have got big farms and cars
[1:11:08] things that they never would have had
[1:11:10] personal gains not all i'm thankful is
[1:11:13] there's still a remnant
[1:11:15] in the days of ezra when israel began to
[1:11:17] weep and to call out and rebuke the sin
[1:11:20] you know what happened all that he let
[1:11:23] the trusted god cut around him
[1:11:26] what we need today is men and women
[1:11:28] your preachers is preaching your
[1:11:30] churches and call sin sin and rebuke it
[1:11:33] the real people of god will get around
[1:11:35] up around you and stay with you that's
[1:11:38] right it's time to call out and save
[1:11:41] witches which separates right from wrong
[1:11:44] god granted to us that we'll have the
[1:11:46] courage to do it
[1:11:48] just think what could happen
[1:11:50] as i was telling you i believe this
[1:11:52] morning or heard someone said that upon
[1:11:55] one of these watchers that's watching us
[1:11:56] forget what you call it now for the bomb
[1:11:58] over the planes to come it's not long
[1:12:01] ago there was a program come through
[1:12:03] somewhere that they'd call out the big
[1:12:05] fleets with
[1:12:07] 300
[1:12:08] jet bombers with atomic bombs and
[1:12:11] hydrogen bombs hanging on them
[1:12:13] not long ago at the big airport street
[1:12:15] board one of the bars was converted
[1:12:17] immediately
[1:12:19] he said freak out atomic bombs hanging
[1:12:21] right in the hangars
[1:12:22] i said aren't you and i mean in the in
[1:12:24] the planes and we go out and practice
[1:12:26] with them daily
[1:12:28] i said aren't you afraid that they
[1:12:29] haven't got the triggers in it
[1:12:30] but we're sold the alert
[1:12:34] that within the space of a minute 60
[1:12:36] seconds we could have the triggers in
[1:12:38] there and gone
[1:12:39] and fueled up and ready to get flat
[1:12:42] england with them immediately
[1:12:44] the great hangers are sitting out in the
[1:12:46] oceans everywhere
[1:12:48] and they're saying to russia dare you
[1:12:51] drop one bomb
[1:12:54] just drop for an atomic bomb on the u.n
[1:12:56] or somewhere there and look what happens
[1:12:58] what will it be it will be an onslaught
[1:13:01] go to russia
[1:13:02] and if they would do that and start
[1:13:04] stopping those atomic and hydrogen bombs
[1:13:07] it would cause a chain reaction that
[1:13:09] would burn the earth to a wind just and
[1:13:12] smell it
[1:13:13] you know it wouldn't just be the
[1:13:15] scripture a bit or the earth shall burn
[1:13:17] to heaven soon
[1:13:19] the atoms of the earth shall burn
[1:13:21] we are living in a dangerous day we're
[1:13:24] living in the day when men of the world
[1:13:26] are scared today
[1:13:28] the great man
[1:13:30] they're
[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:33] [Applause]
[1:13:40] it ought to be the happiest time in the
[1:13:42] world for the christians
[1:13:45] time to go to chains the old will become
[1:13:48] young
[1:13:49] oh my
[1:13:50] death sort of freed away since the no
[1:13:52] more no more prayer meaning to receive
[1:13:55] no more prayer means for the lord but
[1:13:57] god shall come and take the elect from
[1:13:59] the four with the earth and shall get
[1:14:01] them under his own wings and we will
[1:14:03] live and reign with him forever in his
[1:14:05] heaven

[1:15:48] the pentecostal people are looking for
[1:15:51] fantastic
[1:15:52] the world the educated so-called world
[1:15:56] the denominational world is looking for
[1:15:59] some great solution
[1:16:01] that they can uh embedded their
[1:16:03] denomination and get more members into
[1:16:06] it a million more people
[1:16:08] and the the nations are looking for some
[1:16:11] kind of a police force that can bring
[1:16:14] all the world to the knees and bring
[1:16:17] righteousness brother it doesn't come by
[1:16:19] pentecostal fantastic neither does it
[1:16:22] come by protestant organizations are by
[1:16:26] catholic hierarchy neither does it come
[1:16:28] by pentagons or turn new pages it comes
[1:16:31] by surrendered back to jesus christ
[1:16:34] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:37] anything short of that it's wrong let us
[1:16:40] pray
[1:16:42] i'll ask your sister to come to the
[1:16:43] organ or the piano this time
[1:16:46] while we're in prayer while every person
[1:16:48] has her head bowed and every person in
[1:16:50] prayer i wonder at this moment if you
[1:16:54] would test your spirit
[1:16:56] against the word of god
[1:16:59] are you right
[1:17:00] after this service i was i told you
[1:17:03] i got a mother-in-law laying on her at
[1:17:05] the very part of death i got to do
[1:17:08] she's dying
[1:17:12] other friends i don't know here that a
[1:17:14] visit it's laying at the point of death
[1:17:18] people who set this church
[1:17:21] oh brother sister you're coming down
[1:17:23] there too
[1:17:26] you've got to come down there
[1:17:28] now you say well i i know that brother
[1:17:30] graham i mean to get that thing fixed up
[1:17:32] some of these days but it
[1:17:34] may not be some of these days for this
[1:17:37] may be the only day
[1:17:41] how little does that man know
[1:17:43] coming from california going to michigan
[1:17:44] the other day with his little wife up
[1:17:46] here driving the car him in the pickup
[1:17:49] going to their new home and just retired
[1:17:51] from the navy how well did he know when
[1:17:53] he started off that morning maybe from a
[1:17:54] tourist court that his wife and baby
[1:17:56] would be a corpse in a few minutes
[1:17:59] but just above henryville there their
[1:18:01] car collided with the bus the driver
[1:18:04] made the
[1:18:05] the his vehicle do a jackknife almost
[1:18:08] but
[1:18:09] it's killed the woman and the little
[1:18:11] girl i trust that their soul was rightly
[1:18:14] gone
[1:18:15] a few weeks ago when brother woods and i
[1:18:17] went up here to an airplane that fell
[1:18:19] back behind that glacier
[1:18:22] and watched them pull pieces of eight
[1:18:24] man's body when heads and legs and arms
[1:18:26] was all over the place
[1:18:28] picking up the body in the intro falling
[1:18:30] out of the man's body
[1:18:32] a good man perhaps a famous man from
[1:18:35] chicago
[1:18:36] when that man got in the plane that
[1:18:38] morning i wonder the night that he went
[1:18:40] to church if he had good intentions did
[1:18:42] the pastor give an altar call did he
[1:18:44] rebuke sin
[1:18:46] and the man had a chance
[1:18:48] or did he go out like an animal
[1:18:51] was the man in the heart of god a son of
[1:18:53] god
[1:18:54] think of those things friends
[1:18:56] they are important
[1:18:58] they are not only important they are the
[1:19:00] most important thing to you this hour
[1:19:03] this is the time when you'll make up
[1:19:04] your mind this is the time when you may
[1:19:07] make your decision of this life or the
[1:19:10] life you're after may you do it while we
[1:19:12] pray
[1:19:14] heavenly father
[1:19:16] as we read in the bible of what you said
[1:19:19] about sin
[1:19:20] and those who do it and not confess
[1:19:23] we realize what it means
[1:19:26] to die without
[1:19:28] knowing god we know that by experience
[1:19:30] of others that we have seen goals those
[1:19:33] who intended those who cut it off too
[1:19:35] long god those who had professed and not
[1:19:38] possessed what they said they had
[1:19:41] those who had acted like christians and
[1:19:43] yet never was a christian
[1:19:46] their life proved it and their death
[1:19:48] made it manifest
[1:19:50] now father i pray that you'll speak to
[1:19:53] every heart here tonight
[1:19:54] and myself lord for being military for
[1:19:58] many things that i could have done and
[1:20:00] did not do i can pass my own

[1:20:06] can test the wrongs of this nation
[1:20:08] i ask you to have mercy lord i've got

[1:20:32] something has got to take us
[1:20:35] but we're so happy to know that there is
[1:20:37] a way of escaping
[1:20:39] the name of the lord is a
[1:20:41] is a tower and the righteous running
[1:20:44] their head on our state god

[1:20:50] girl man or woman
[1:20:52] see the open door the opportunity and
[1:20:54] run to christ this hour
[1:20:56] now while we have our heads out

[1:21:41] along with the tide
[1:21:44] looking at the kind of programs you
[1:21:46] should not look at
[1:21:47] look at the kind of magazines and
[1:21:49] reading the literature that you should
[1:21:50] not read that's not becoming to
[1:21:52] christians
[1:21:54] listening to the jokes of the file and
[1:21:57] dirt and smut that you know you
[1:21:59] shouldn't do both men and women
[1:22:02] you know places where you could have
[1:22:04] spoken did not do it and you're guilty
[1:22:06] maybe this cynical mission

[1:35:54] nearer
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:36:08] i was thinking of the scripture where
[1:36:10] the disciples said
[1:36:12] this is a hard saying
[1:36:14] who can hear it
[1:36:17] and it's difficult to hear some of these
[1:36:18] things
[1:36:19] i was reading the answer that jesus gave
[1:36:24] and part of that answer
[1:36:26] he says it is the spirit that quickeneth
[1:36:30] the flesh profiteth nothing
[1:36:32] the words that i speak unto you they are
[1:36:34] spirit and they are life
[1:36:37] and i believe we've heard the words of
[1:36:38] god
[1:36:39] tonight not just to
[1:36:42] direct our flesh but to know that in his
[1:36:45] spirit
[1:36:46] as we receive that word
[1:36:48] that that's life to us
[1:36:51] so i believe that
[1:36:52] there is a people that can hear those
[1:36:54] hard sayings
[1:36:56] and can
[1:36:59] take it to heart and be changed by them
[1:37:01] and i just pray
[1:37:02] that you and i are part of that number
[1:37:07] let's sing make me more like thee
[1:37:11] [Music]
[1:37:16] make thee
[1:37:20] jesus
[1:37:22] may
[1:37:25] be more
[1:37:27] like thee
[1:37:32] forgive me
[1:37:35] a heart
[1:37:37] that's
[1:37:38] filled with love
[1:37:42] and
[1:37:44] make me more
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:51] live your work
[1:37:54] live your
[1:37:56] life through me

[1:38:28] through me
[1:38:33] and
[1:38:34] speak your
[1:38:37] word through me
[1:38:42] jesus
[1:38:44] speak your word
[1:38:48] through me
[1:38:53] oh give me
[1:38:58] that's
[1:38:59] filled with love
[1:39:03] and
[1:39:04] speak your work
[1:39:13] and lord

[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:57] you are the place where god's chosen to
[1:40:59] dwell
[1:41:01] i was listening to an indian man
[1:41:02] speaking on the radio
[1:41:04] they were going to put a copper mine on
[1:41:05] his holy place oak ridge or something
[1:41:08] like that
[1:41:10] and he was trying to express the pain
[1:41:12] that he would have that somebody would
[1:41:13] try to put
[1:41:14] a copper mine on his holy place
[1:41:17] he said it would be
[1:41:18] just like putting a copper mine in your
[1:41:20] holiest of your
[1:41:22] temple or your synagogue or your mosque
[1:41:26] and i thought of
[1:41:28] how many times we let
[1:41:30] our hearts which are supposed to be a
[1:41:32] sanctuary it's just supposed to be a
[1:41:34] holy place
[1:41:35] we just let the dirt and the filth of
[1:41:37] this world
[1:41:39] come and contaminate it
[1:41:42] but lord open our eyes lord help us and
[1:41:46] believe that he will
[1:41:49] there's a little song we sang once it's
[1:41:51] not entrying but entrusting
[1:41:54] it's an f i think we have the words to
[1:41:55] that
[1:41:59] it's not
[1:42:00] in trying
[1:42:02] but entrusting
[1:42:07] it's not
[1:42:09] in running
[1:42:10] but in resting
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:14] it's not in one dream but in praise
[1:42:22] that we
[1:42:23] find the strength of the lord
[1:42:30] it's
[1:42:31] not in trying
[1:42:34] but entrusting
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:38] it's
[1:42:39] not in running
[1:42:42] but in resting
[1:42:46] it's not in one
[1:42:49] drink but in praying
[1:42:53] that we find
[1:42:55] the strength of the lord one more time
[1:43:01] it's not in trying
[1:43:04] but entrusting
[1:43:08] it's not
[1:43:10] in running
[1:43:12] but in resting
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:15] it's not in wandering
[1:43:19] but in praying
[1:43:23] that we find
[1:43:25] the strength of the lord
[1:43:30] and we have a testimony
[1:43:33] praise came in of the strength of the
[1:43:34] lord
[1:43:36] while we were listening to the tape from
[1:43:38] brother dan roberts
