[13:49] not feeling good so we'll take the
[13:51] request right now how many knows when we
[13:54] when we approach the Lord he knows
[13:56] already how many knows that provision
[13:59] has already been made for that so we're
[14:02] just asking him to to help us to believe
[14:05] by faith take his promise and receive it
[14:08] so and I'm going
[14:10] to I'm going to read the request that
[14:14] brother Tim Cruz had put in last
[14:19] week and then we'll get the second part
[14:22] today also so if you remember brother
[14:26] Tim Cruz says my friend Daniel Walker's
[14:29] mom had a
[14:30] stroke in church this
[14:32] morning and uh she's in the
[14:35] hospital and she wasn't responsive
[14:39] praying for a touch from the Lord she's
[14:42] a Christian and she loves the
[14:45] Lord
[14:47] and it's
[14:49] it's it's good to be a Christian it's
[14:53] good to love the Lord but you know if
[14:56] you can believe all things are possible
[15:00] and our sister Amelia says I had uh some
[15:03] lab work done yesterday please pray that
[15:06] everything comes out okay
[15:10] so sister Martha Peterson says please
[15:13] continue to remember my dad in prayer
[15:16] last week he was taken to the Y because
[15:19] of internal bleeding he ended up getting
[15:22] a colonoscopy a showed a mass in his
[15:24] colon as well as assist on his pancreas
[15:28] that one has grown they took a biopsy of
[15:31] the mass on the colon but he does not
[15:34] have the results back dad is fairly
[15:36] positive and is doing well but is still
[15:39] experienced bleeding though they think
[15:42] that's coming from somewhere besides his
[15:44] colon pray that the Lord work his
[15:47] healing touch that we can get answers
[15:49] quickly and that we can have patience in
[15:52] the mean
[15:54] time yeah sometimes we really Lord I
[15:57] want to answer and I want I want it now
[16:00] and he understands
[16:01] [Music]
[16:02] that so as you know my daughter Sarah
[16:07] went in for surgery because of the
[16:10] broken
[16:11] catheter and all the problems they were
[16:13] going
[16:14] and
[16:16] so you heard brother Daniel if you
[16:19] listen to that and I made to told them I
[16:22] said I I was sitting there at the at my
[16:25] desk and I'm thinking if I could just
[16:28] take her place and then later I thought
[16:31] Lord maybe I couldn't even bear it and
[16:33] she
[16:35] could and it just I was talking to my
[16:38] wife and she was by Sarah and Sarah was
[16:41] coming out of the anesthesia and all and
[16:43] she was moaning and groing and just
[16:45] didn't sound good at
[16:47] all and today I talked to her and didn't
[16:49] sound like the same Sarah of yesterday
[16:51] she was happy and bubbling and Dad I'm
[16:53] doing
[16:54] good and so I said well if I could take
[16:58] her place there can I have her place
[17:00] over here too and rejoice in that and um
[17:04] and then you also heard our brother
[17:06] silus is out of the hospital so but now
[17:09] after we read that request and here's
[17:11] the praise from brother Tim want to
[17:14] thank the Lord for healing my friend's
[17:16] mom she had a stroke Sunday morning she
[17:20] would only say okay and thank you by
[17:22] Monday she was speaking almost
[17:24] completely normal and by Tuesday she was
[17:27] discharged and back to normal the MRI
[17:30] says there is no clot or permanent
[17:33] damage he says I would also like to
[17:35] thank the Lord because I put in a prayer
[17:37] request a few years ago back for the
[17:39] same thing and he was heal he healed her
[17:43] perfectly then too this is two times he
[17:46] has healed her praise the Lord there's
[17:49] just so much to praise him about he's so
[17:52] good to

[37:16] that I can always confide in so I would
[37:19] like to show him how much we love him
[37:20] from here in
[37:22] Tucson I really appreciated the uh the
[37:26] prayer request
[37:27] quests um Sister Sarah brother Aaron's
[37:31] daughter she's anyone that knows Sister
[37:35] Sarah she's a she's a
[37:37] miracle she should have been gone a long
[37:40] time ago but the Lord had something for
[37:42] her here and I'll tell you what she's a
[37:46] lot of fun and always has a big smile on
[37:48] her face and and uh she's just she's a
[37:51] joy to be around she's become a very
[37:53] very close friend with my wife um so
[37:57] really happy to hear that sister Sarah's
[37:59] doing better and then
[38:01] um brother Tim mentioned a lady that had
[38:05] a stroke and brother Tim if I'm right if
[38:08] I remember right she had a stroke in
[38:10] church am I am I right yeah last week
[38:14] and uh she or two weeks ago and uh
[38:19] that's probably where I'd want to have a
[38:20] stroke is in church and uh she went home
[38:24] and the Lord's taken care of her and and
[38:26] I just asked brother Tim um I went back
[38:29] there and I I said uh where does this
[38:32] sister go to
[38:34] church and um he said she's in sista she
[38:38] doesn't go to a message
[38:40] church
[38:42] and I thought you know she's still a
[38:47] child of God and I've I've heard so many
[38:50] people I've made this mistake my wife
[38:54] has made this mistake with with people
[38:56] that we've talked to that we've
[38:57] witnessed to that we've fellowshipped
[38:59] with to to call someone that maybe
[39:03] believes like us
[39:05] Believers and then someone like this
[39:08] sister that brother Tim knows not to
[39:12] call her a
[39:14] Believer brothers and sisters that's
[39:16] wrong you cannot pull that out of
[39:20] brother bram's message now we can we can
[39:24] teach that Doctrine in our churches and
[39:26] we can we can promote it and say oh well
[39:28] we're Believers we believe the end time
[39:30] message and all of this but you are
[39:32] speaking something that brother brandom
[39:34] didn't
[39:35] speak you can't you can't find it in his
[39:38] message he said that there are three
[39:41] kinds of Believers in every church and
[39:44] he mentions Baptists and Catholics and
[39:46] all the different churches so we either
[39:48] need to change his
[39:51] message or we need to just make
[39:54] something up that isn't right right so
[39:57] there are believers brothers and sisters
[40:01] everywhere if they believe on Jesus
[40:05] Christ then they are
[40:08] believers they may not have be as
[40:11] blessed as we are in certain things but
[40:14] then we might not be as blessed as they
[40:16] are in certain things I've heard tell
[40:19] you what I've I've received a lot of
[40:21] criticism there's an old saying brother
[40:24] ly it says that that's not a hill I'm
[40:27] willing to die on you know it's
[40:29] basically if I'm going to get into an
[40:30] argument I may be right but I don't want
[40:32] to argue about that one because that's
[40:36] it's just not that important that is a
[40:38] hill I'm willing to die on Jesus died on
[40:41] that same Hill it was called gotha he
[40:45] died for the
[40:47] Sinners and I just appreciate so much
[40:51] the church coming together and praying
[40:56] for people outside and sincerely praying
[41:01] and also praying for people within our
[41:04] church and then and seeing the results
[41:08] I'm going to talk about a man today
[41:10] named Gideon that made a statement he
[41:12] says if God is with me he says then
[41:17] where are all the
[41:18] Miracles and we can make up Miracles and
[41:21] we can we can say that that certain
[41:24] things because the Lord healed healed me
[41:26] of of a sickness or something we can
[41:30] make something up God is good God heals
[41:34] he heals The Atheist he heals the
[41:36] Christian he heals because he's a good
[41:39] God but sometimes we have to just say
[41:41] Lord if you're with us then where is
[41:44] your Holy Spirit where is the outpouring
[41:47] where are the gifts where are these
[41:50] great Miracles one time I was praying
[41:52] that I was in my
[41:55] closet and I was I was asking the Lord I
[41:59] said
[41:59] 'lord if you're with
[42:02] us
[42:04] then where is the god that parted the
[42:08] Red
[42:08] Sea where are these great Miracles Lord
[42:12] if you're actually here if you're with
[42:14] us then how come I don't see
[42:16] that and I got up out of the my
[42:21] closet and I walked out and I thought ah
[42:26] feel bad for saying that when I was
[42:29] praying I thought Lord maybe I got
[42:30] enthused I I
[42:32] just I didn't Lord forgive me if I
[42:36] grieved your spirit I loved you I love
[42:39] your word I love everything about you I
[42:42] said Lord I'm really sorry and I just
[42:44] had this horrible feeling of guilt and I
[42:47] I said Lord this book just I love it so
[42:50] much would you just give me a little bit
[42:53] just of encouragement and I open my
[42:55] bible and I didn't expect to say this to
[42:58] the Book of Jeremiah I don't know
[43:00] exactly where it is but it
[43:04] said God speaking to his prophet he said
[43:07] why have they not said where is the god
[43:11] that has done all these things my right
[43:14] when I opened my Bible it went my eyes
[43:16] went right there so I thought
[43:19] Lord thank you we should be asking that
[43:24] we should be asking Lord if you're with
[43:27] our
[43:29] church why are there there not more
[43:32] converts do people really sister Shirley
[43:36] do they want to be like me when I'm out
[43:39] and and working as I was ministering on
[43:41] on Sunday when I'm out in my job or when
[43:44] I'm out at the store wherever I am when
[43:46] somebody meets me do they want to be
[43:48] like
[43:49] me do they admire me my
[43:53] Christianity or do I not represent the
[43:55] Lord Jesus in that type of way and
[43:58] that's what many times is lacking I
[44:01] think in our in our fellowships and our
[44:04] churches and it shows that I believe
[44:07] that we have a long way to go and if we
[44:09] have lost the burden for the
[44:12] Lost then our Christianity is very much
[44:16] flawed we have become so much part so
[44:19] much lifting up ourselves and how great
[44:21] we are and how special we are and in
[44:25] lifting up ourselves I think we've done
[44:26] exactly what brother brandom came to
[44:29] tear down which is no you're not special
[44:32] no you're not better than anyone else
[44:34] the only reason that you are special is
[44:37] if you know Jesus Christ that's the only
[44:40] reason the disciples were
[44:42] special and I I do love I really
[44:45] enjoy seeing the the messages go back
[44:49] and forth and seeing the love that
[44:53] really is in our church and it's really
[44:56] starting to form and you'll notice when
[44:59] the people when they come in and then
[45:02] when they're
[45:03] leaving especially did you notice on
[45:05] Sunday just that sweet Spirit of love it
[45:09] was it was the nicest thing people just
[45:12] greeting each other and staying and and
[45:15] worshiping and and just just loving each
[45:19] other that is how we know that God's
[45:24] with us as if we have that love
[45:27] know you could have I know you don't but
[45:30] you could have a great preacher but if
[45:33] he doesn't have love then it it's not
[45:36] going to do any good he can come in and
[45:37] open up the Bible and and explain all of
[45:39] these things but if that love if that
[45:42] Spirit isn't there then it's not going
[45:44] to do any good it's just going to
[45:46] educate you but when we genuine love
[45:49] each other we can lay our hands on one
[45:52] another and we can enter into that
[45:54] suffering like for your daughter like
[45:56] you said brother Aaron I wish it was me
[45:58] that could take that that's love and
[46:01] that's what produces something is if we
[46:04] can love someone as much as Jesus did
[46:06] when he looked on the Rich Young Ruler
[46:08] and he loved him he loved him so much
[46:11] that he told them this is your problem
[46:15] get rid of
[46:16] it and if we can do that if we can
[46:19] really love one another it's greater
[46:21] than all the doctrines it's greater than
[46:23] everything that we could ever have and I
[46:26] look in this This Book of Judges that
[46:28] we've been going
[46:29] through and I see
[46:31] that they did exactly what God told them
[46:35] not to do they just kept going back and
[46:38] failing it was this vicious cycle of
[46:42] they would fall into the world and into
[46:44] idolatry and into sin and then their
[46:48] lives would get hard and oppressing
[46:51] Nation would invade and start taking all
[46:54] of their food and and they they would
[46:56] they would they would get their crops
[46:58] together and they would hide them and
[47:00] here would come the invading armies and
[47:02] take their food and then how do you feed
[47:04] your family for the rest of the year
[47:07] because they take the storehouses and
[47:09] they would they would Rob
[47:11] everything and then of they would cry
[47:14] out to the Lord because the hardship
[47:16] came and then the Lord in his sweetness
[47:19] and kindness and love he would look back
[47:23] down on them and he would send them a
[47:25] deliver deliver her he'd send them help
[47:28] and then they'd serve the Lord as long
[47:30] as that person was there they would
[47:32] continue to serve the Lord and then when
[47:34] that person would
[47:36] leave they would go right back into
[47:39] their
[47:42] denominations right back into their way
[47:45] their sectarian way of thinking right
[47:47] back into in the Book of Judges into
[47:50] their
[47:51] idolatry into their lying and cheating
[47:55] and fornication sleeping around and not
[47:58] not respecting the sanctity of marriage
[48:00] going right back into sin and then here
[48:04] comes the problems again in the same
[48:07] cycle for hundreds of years just over
[48:09] and over and over and that is the Book
[48:11] of
[48:12] Judges it started bad
[48:15] when God told them through Joshua when
[48:19] you go into this land drive out the
[48:22] inhabitants that are there and they
[48:24] didn't do it it goes through every
[48:26] single tribe and says and this tribe
[48:29] didn't drive them out and that tribe
[48:31] didn't drive them out they didn't go all
[48:34] the
[48:35] way even before I get S started I feel
[48:39] like that's many times what we do we
[48:41] don't go all the way we might get into
[48:43] church we might change our lives around
[48:46] we might stop sinning or drinking or
[48:49] smoking or or um running around and
[48:53] living a promiscuous life we might stop
[48:55] sto doing all of that but then God wants
[48:58] to bring us a little further but we
[49:01] still hold a little bit of the world in
[49:05] and we won't get rid of it and then let
[49:08] God fill us with the Holy Spirit and
[49:11] that is continually what happens we
[49:13] don't go all the way and that's what
[49:15] happened in the Book of Judges when they
[49:18] went across into this promised land they
[49:21] went over Jordan Joshua said drive them
[49:23] all out they didn't do it because it was
[49:26] too hard so then after Joshua passed
[49:31] away after the elders passed
[49:35] away then that next Generation started
[49:38] sinning and started Living like the
[49:42] Canaanites that they were living amongst
[49:44] that they didn't drive out the
[49:46] Canaanites Gods became their gods the
[49:50] Canaanites way of
[49:52] living and with without the sanctity of
[49:56] marriage living like that that's the way
[49:59] the Israelites started to live violence
[50:03] from the Canaanites that's the way the
[50:05] Israelites started to live so after they
[50:08] they're going and then God sends down an
[50:13] oppressor and takes over the country and
[50:17] as I said starts oppressing the people
[50:18] taking their food and then God sent this
[50:21] man named Anno the first judge and he
[50:25] conquered Ed the
[50:27] Invaders and then there was peace in
[50:30] Israel the Jews enjoyed peace for 40
[50:32] years then annil
[50:35] died and the people again fell into
[50:39] sin and then this King named Egan the
[50:43] king of Moab oppressed the people for 18
[50:47] years then God heard the Cry of his
[50:50] people and raised up a man
[50:53] left-handed named ahud
[50:57] ahood builds this two-edged
[51:01] knife puts it on his right thigh hides
[51:05] it then he goes to this egund King pulls
[51:10] the knife
[51:12] out
[51:14] stabs the king remember he was a very
[51:16] fat man that's a
[51:18] quote loses his knife inside inside the
[51:22] king he
[51:24] escapes the King dies and with the King
[51:28] dead is the Israelites launch a surprise
[51:30] attack and killed 10,000 soldiers they
[51:33] conquered Moab Moab became subject to
[51:36] Israel and there was peace for 80
[51:39] years and it lasted until AUD
[51:43] died then
[51:46] shamgar not too much is written about
[51:48] him but he was one of brother bram's
[51:51] favorite people as I said when we
[51:54] started on part one of of the judges
[51:57] brother Brandon mentioned him in 16
[52:00] different sermons how much he loved this
[52:04] man named shamgar shamgar took this
[52:08] cattle prod and he saw that these all of
[52:12] these Invaders were coming in and and
[52:14] taking his food and taking the food of
[52:16] his countrymen so his children were
[52:18] starving and and all of the the
[52:19] Israelites were starving he takes this
[52:22] cattle prod and he kills 600 of the
[52:27] Invaders great man of God that the
[52:31] spirit Came Upon and then then shamgar
[52:35] leaves and then they fall into sin again
[52:38] and then we have raised up this sister
[52:42] this woman named
[52:44] Deborah and this Warrior named
[52:47] baric now after the the death of ahud
[52:51] the judge they rise on the scene the
[52:54] same thing happens there
[52:55] there they they were oppressed for 20
[53:01] years before God raised up D Deborah and
[53:04] baric baric commanded the Army and took
[53:07] 10,000 soldiers to battle with this King
[53:12] and his General named
[53:14] cicar Barrett commanded an overwhelming
[53:17] victory over cic's Army but CIS escaped
[53:21] and
[53:22] went on the run and went to this woman
[53:26] who he
[53:27] knew named Jil and Jil as I said before
[53:31] Jael says yeah come on in come into my
[53:35] tent lay down here's a blanket here's
[53:38] some milk
[53:39] relax go to
[53:41] sleep so CIS goes to sleep jail takes a
[53:45] tent Peg stick it sticks it in his
[53:48] Temple slams it down and nails cicora to
[53:53] the ground and then
[53:56] they they go forward and and they
[53:59] continue in peace for another 40
[54:02] years and then God
[54:06] again they forsake God again and they
[54:08] start worshiping the idols of the
[54:11] Canaanites again the Vicious Cycle
[54:13] continues and now we get to Gideon
[54:17] Gideon is in Judges chapter 6 let's
[54:21] let's read
[54:24] it
[54:30] and the children of Israel did evil in
[54:32] the sight of the Lord and the Lord
[54:34] delivered them into the hand of Midian
[54:36] seven
[54:37] years and the Hand of Midian prevailed
[54:40] against Israel and because of the
[54:41] midianites the children of Israel made
[54:44] them dens which are in the mountains and
[54:46] caves and strongholds what I was saying
[54:48] before these these oppressors come in
[54:51] and then drive out the people of Israel
[54:54] and they have to go hide
[54:55] died and it was so when Israel had sown
[54:59] they planted their crops that the
[55:01] midianites came up and the
[55:03] amalekites and the children of the East
[55:06] even they came up against them and they
[55:08] encamped against them and destroyed the
[55:10] increase of the earth till Thou come
[55:13] unto Gaza and left no sustenance for
[55:16] Israel neither sheep nor Ox nor ass and
[55:20] they for they came up with their cattle
[55:23] and their tents and they came up as
[55:25] grasshoppers for multitude for both they
[55:28] and their camels were without number and
[55:30] they entered into the land to destroy it
[55:34] and Israel was greatly impoverished
[55:37] because of the
[55:38] midianites and the children of Israel
[55:41] Cried Out unto the
[55:44] Lord the Bible says that man was made in
[55:49] the image of
[55:50] God we see that these children no matter
[55:55] how much they had sinned no matter how
[55:57] much problems they had caused for
[55:59] themselves and everything that they had
[56:01] done they see that this loving God this
[56:04] loving
[56:05] father was willing to take them back
[56:09] just as any loving mother just as any
[56:12] loving father no matter what our
[56:13] children would ever do we would always
[56:16] be willing to take them
[56:20] back we can live in a we can live in the
[56:22] world we can act like the world worship
[56:25] worldly Idols but when hardships come
[56:28] that's when we cry out to the Lord isn't
[56:29] it
[56:31] strange and then this Book of Judges
[56:34] it's really it is it's the story of
[56:37] mankind God blesses us we disobey God
[56:39] trials and tribulations come because of
[56:41] our sins then God bails us out if you
[56:45] read the Bible from Genesis to
[56:47] Revelation this story repeats itself
[56:50] over and over and over again and we
[56:54] think that there's coming a
[56:55] tribulation for this world and we look
[56:58] at this tribulation and we think this is
[57:00] God's Wrath that's going to come upon
[57:03] the Earth how the six seal is going to
[57:05] break and there's going to be
[57:06] earthquakes and we're going to see a
[57:07] false prophets arise and we're going to
[57:09] see all of these problems because of it
[57:12] of of God's Wrath but maybe it's God's
[57:17] love that he spreads across the Earth
[57:20] because we won't serve him or many won't
[57:25] serve him in the good times so he sends
[57:29] these hard
[57:31] times as a as an act of love he knows
[57:36] just as Jesus had talked to the Rich
[57:38] Young Ruler he knew that hey you might
[57:41] be poor on Earth for the rest of your
[57:43] life but you're going to inherit riches
[57:45] in heaven and it's the same with with
[57:48] this if if we could just
[57:52] accept God and make the sacrifices then
[57:58] the Lord will give us what's on the
[58:00] other side and bless us but here these
[58:04] people they sinned and sinned and sinned
[58:07] and then they got in trouble and they
[58:08] cried out to God and it came to pass
[58:12] when the children of Israel Cried unto
[58:14] the Lord because of the midianites that
[58:16] the Lord sent a prophet unto the
[58:19] children of Israel something probably
[58:22] most people don't know that this is the
[58:24] one time that a prophet is mentioned in
[58:26] the Book of
[58:27] Judges the Lord sent a prophet unto the
[58:29] children of Israel which said unto them
[58:31] thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel I
[58:34] brought you up from Egypt and brought
[58:37] you forth out of the house of
[58:40] bondage notice the prophet
[58:42] reminds the people of God's goodness and
[58:45] of his power and he reminds them of what
[58:48] God has done in the
[58:50] past and I delivered you out of the hand
[58:52] of the Egyptians and out of the hand of
[58:55] all that oppressed you and drave them
[58:57] out from before you and gave you their
[59:00] land and I said unto you I am the Lord
[59:03] your God fear not the gods of the
[59:06] amorites in whose land you dwell but ye
[59:09] have not obeyed my voice the prophet as
[59:13] all prophets
[59:14] do brings correction to the people and
[59:18] he said you have not obeyed God's voice
[59:20] you have not driven out the Canaanites
[59:21] you have not done exactly what I told
[59:24] you have done
[59:25] exactly what I told you not to do which
[59:27] is marrying among them taking on their
[59:30] way of living worshiping Idols instead
[59:32] of
[59:34] Jehovah and here's what happens so now
[59:38] there's a little pause
[59:41] here in verse 11 says and there came an
[59:44] angel of the Lord and sat under an oak
[59:47] which was in orpa that pertained unto
[59:50] joash the
[59:52] abizer and his son Gideon
[59:55] threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide
[59:57] it from the midianites now the place
[59:59] that you thresh
[1:00:00] wheat you you're you're getting the
[1:00:02] chaff off of the wheat and you do this
[1:00:05] on top of a hill where the wind is
[1:00:07] blowing to get rid of all of the stuff
[1:00:10] and what he was doing is he was
[1:00:13] threshing this wheat down in the valley
[1:00:16] down in a hiding place so the enemy
[1:00:19] wouldn't see
[1:00:20] him and the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:00:22] unto him appeared unto Gideon and said
[1:00:26] unto him the Lord is with thee thou
[1:00:28] Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto
[1:00:31] him oh my Lord if the Lord be with
[1:00:34] us why then is all this befallen us and
[1:00:38] where be all his miracles which our
[1:00:40] fathers told us of saying did not the
[1:00:43] Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the
[1:00:46] Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us
[1:00:48] under the hands of the
[1:00:51] midianites I want to point out right
[1:00:53] here if you're reading reading in your
[1:00:55] Bible in your King James Bible that
[1:00:58] you'll see two different words in that
[1:01:01] sentence it says here oh my Lord he's
[1:01:05] talking to the man he doesn't know as an
[1:01:07] angel yet he says oh my Lord if the Lord
[1:01:10] be with us do you see how they're
[1:01:13] spelled differently do you see the small
[1:01:16] case capital L small case o r d and then
[1:01:19] you see all
[1:01:21] caps for l r d the all caps lrd is
[1:01:27] Yahweh Jehovah it is the self-existing
[1:01:32] one it is God himself this other Lord is
[1:01:37] a ruler or a um
[1:01:40] someone that would have
[1:01:47] importance so then Gideon the famous
[1:01:50] saying is Gideon is saying say he says
[1:01:53] he says sir are you saying that God is
[1:01:55] with me and it's the question as I said
[1:01:58] earlier that this is the question that
[1:01:59] all of us should ask and if you are with
[1:02:03] us then where are all these Miracles he
[1:02:05] wasn't just talking Little Miracles he's
[1:02:07] talking about parting the Red Sea and
[1:02:10] these great things that had happened and
[1:02:13] Gideon he was talking with his man he
[1:02:15] obviously didn't know who he was and
[1:02:17] then the Lord looked upon
[1:02:19] him and said go in this thy might and
[1:02:24] Thou shalt save Israel from the hand of
[1:02:26] the midianites have not I sent thee and
[1:02:29] he said unto him oh my Lord where was
[1:02:32] shall I save Israel so you see God's
[1:02:35] talking through this man you see this is
[1:02:38] this is important you see how you have
[1:02:42] the all caps there and the Lord God
[1:02:46] Yahweh Jehovah said unto him through
[1:02:50] this Angel and then he says oh my Lord
[1:02:53] and he's using the small case so he
[1:02:54] doesn't know who this is oh my Lord
[1:02:56] wherewith shall I save Israel behold my
[1:02:58] family is poor in manasse and I am the
[1:03:00] least in my father's house so he's
[1:03:03] saying Gideon saying hey I'm just this
[1:03:05] common everyday guy and he's even
[1:03:07] probably the youngest or the least
[1:03:09] successful in his family and the Lord
[1:03:11] said unto him surely I will be with thee
[1:03:14] and thou shalt Smite the midianites as
[1:03:16] one
[1:03:19] man and he said unto him if now I have
[1:03:22] found Grace in thy sight then show me a
[1:03:24] sign that thou talkest to me so he's
[1:03:27] saying if you're a man of God that I
[1:03:29] think you are then Show Me A Sign Here
[1:03:32] depart not hence I pray thee until I
[1:03:34] come unto thee and bring forth my
[1:03:37] present and set it before thee and he
[1:03:39] said I will tar until there come so
[1:03:42] Gideon's being hospitable here and he's
[1:03:44] going he's going to go make this man a
[1:03:46] meal and Gideon went in and made ready a
[1:03:49] kid and unleavened cakes of an epha of
[1:03:52] flour and flesh he put in the basket and
[1:03:54] he put the broth on a pot and brought it
[1:03:58] brought it out unto him under the Oak
[1:04:00] and presented it and the angel of God
[1:04:02] said unto him take the Flesh and the
[1:04:04] unleavened cakes and lay them Upon This
[1:04:07] Rock and pour out the
[1:04:09] broth put yourself in Gideon's
[1:04:12] Place what's going on here and he did
[1:04:17] so then the angel of the Lord put forth
[1:04:21] the end of his staff that was in his
[1:04:23] hand and touched the Flesh of the
[1:04:25] unleavened cakes and there arose up a
[1:04:28] fire out of the Rock and consumed the
[1:04:30] Flesh and the unleavened cakes then the
[1:04:33] angel of the Lord departed out of his
[1:04:35] sight
[1:04:37] whoa Gideon did not expect
[1:04:40] that and when Gideon perceived that he
[1:04:43] was an angel of the Lord Gideon said
[1:04:45] alas oh Lord God for because I have seen
[1:04:49] an angel of the Lord face to face now
[1:04:52] the in the Old Testament there's
[1:04:53] something about about seeing an angel
[1:04:55] that put fear into the people and most
[1:04:58] that saw this type of thing thought they
[1:05:00] were going to
[1:05:02] die and the Lord said unto him peace be
[1:05:05] unto thee fear
[1:05:07] not Thou shalt not die and Gideon built
[1:05:11] an altar there unto the Lord and called
[1:05:13] it Jehovah Shalom unto this day it is
[1:05:18] yet an orpa of the
[1:05:21] aites and it came to pass the same night
[1:05:24] that the Lord said unto him take thy
[1:05:26] father's young bulock even the second
[1:05:28] bulock of seven years old and throw down
[1:05:30] the altar of Baal that thy father hath
[1:05:33] and cut down the Grove that is by it and
[1:05:35] build an altar unto the Lord thy God
[1:05:37] upon the top of this rock in the ordered
[1:05:40] place and take the second bulock and
[1:05:42] offer a burnt sacrifice with wood of the
[1:05:45] Grove which Thou shalt cut down and then
[1:05:48] Gideon took 10 men of his servants and
[1:05:50] did as the Lord had said unto him and so
[1:05:52] it was because he feared his father's
[1:05:55] household and the men of the city that
[1:05:57] he could not do it by day so he did it
[1:06:00] by night even after all those Miracles
[1:06:03] he still was a little bit scared of what
[1:06:06] was going to happen taking his dad's two
[1:06:08] cows and cutting down his Grove and
[1:06:11] destroying his
[1:06:13] idols so he even with 10 men with him
[1:06:17] this had to be a long
[1:06:19] night and when the men of the city arose
[1:06:22] early in the morning Behold The Altar of
[1:06:24] baale was cast down and the Grove was
[1:06:26] cut down that was by it and the second
[1:06:29] bulock was offered upon the altar that
[1:06:31] was built and they said one to another
[1:06:34] who hath done this thing and when they
[1:06:35] inquired and asked they said Gideon the
[1:06:37] son of joash hath done this thing so
[1:06:40] some of probably one of those 10 had
[1:06:41] ratted him
[1:06:42] out then the men of the city said unto
[1:06:45] joash bring out thy son that he may die
[1:06:48] because he hath cast down the altar of
[1:06:50] Baal and because he hath cut down the
[1:06:52] Grove that was by
[1:06:56] it and then joash said unto all that
[1:07:00] stood against him will you plead for
[1:07:02] Baal joash was Gideon's
[1:07:06] dad Gideon didn't ask his dad took two
[1:07:11] cows his dad's cows that were probably
[1:07:13] very
[1:07:14] expensive sacrifices them cuts down his
[1:07:19] dad's Grove tear down tears down his
[1:07:21] dad's idols and I I think not enough is
[1:07:25] said about this man that's Gideon's
[1:07:29] dad watch what he
[1:07:32] says he
[1:07:36] says and joash said unto all that stood
[1:07:39] against him will ye plead for Baal Baal
[1:07:42] is their God that they're worshiping
[1:07:44] will you save him he that will plead for
[1:07:47] him let him be put to death whilst it is
[1:07:50] still yet mour if he be a God let him
[1:07:53] plead for him
[1:07:54] himself because one hath cast down his
[1:07:57] altar so if this God is real that we're
[1:08:00] all worshiping let me see him do
[1:08:05] something therefore on that
[1:08:07] day he called him jerub Bal saying let
[1:08:13] ball
[1:08:14] baale let baale plead against him
[1:08:17] because he had thrown down his altar
[1:08:19] then all the midianites and the
[1:08:21] amalekites and the children of the East
[1:08:22] were gathered together and went over and
[1:08:24] pitched in the valley of jezrael but the
[1:08:27] spirit of the Lord Came Upon Gideon and
[1:08:29] he blew a trumpet and and Abazar was
[1:08:33] gathered after
[1:08:34] him and he sent Messengers throughout
[1:08:37] all manasse who also was gathered after
[1:08:40] him and sent Messengers unto Asher and
[1:08:42] zebulun and unto Neftali and they came
[1:08:45] up to meet them and Gideon said unto God
[1:08:48] if thou wil save Israel by mine hand as
[1:08:50] thou has said behold I will put a fleece
[1:08:53] famous story here and we'll read it
[1:08:55] right out of the Bible behold I will put
[1:08:57] a fleece of wool in the flower in the
[1:08:59] floor and if the Dew be on the fleece
[1:09:02] only and it be dry upon the Earth beside
[1:09:06] then shall I know that thou Wilt save
[1:09:08] Israel by mine hand as thou Hast said
[1:09:11] and it was so for he rose up early in
[1:09:13] the tomorrow and thrust the fleece
[1:09:16] together and ring the Dew out of the
[1:09:18] fleece a bowl full of water and Gideon
[1:09:21] said unto God let not thy anger be hot
[1:09:24] against me and I will speak but this
[1:09:26] once let me prove I pray thee but this
[1:09:29] once with the fleece and let it now be
[1:09:31] dry upon the fleece and upon all the
[1:09:34] ground let there be due and God did so
[1:09:37] that night for it was dry upon the
[1:09:39] fleece only and there was due on the
[1:09:42] ground so Gideon here he's asking for a
[1:09:45] sign many signs from the Lord he's
[1:09:47] saying well let let the fleece be wet
[1:09:49] like the um Lamb's wool or the sheep's
[1:09:51] wool let it be wet and let the ground be
[1:09:54] dry and then says okay Lord just so I'm
[1:09:56] sure let's make it the opposite tomorrow
[1:10:00] he wanted to be sure I don't think
[1:10:02] Gideon was necessarily a man of little
[1:10:04] faith or God wouldn't have chosen him to
[1:10:08] lead Israel I think that this was
[1:10:11] something for us to even say now how
[1:10:14] many of us have said have you I put a
[1:10:16] fleece before the Lord so just as Gideon
[1:10:19] had done here so while Gideon lived the
[1:10:22] Israelites enjoyed 40 more years of
[1:10:24] peace and when he died they abandoned
[1:10:28] his
[1:10:29] family and they returned to worshiping
[1:10:32] Baal now what happened after Gideon is
[1:10:36] um it just it went South
[1:10:40] again and violence started to rise up so
[1:10:43] Gideon's
[1:10:44] son he gets all of his brothers together
[1:10:47] and then kills and Gideon had all kinds
[1:10:50] of wives and children and
[1:10:54] his son gets together and gets them all
[1:10:56] in one place and kills 70 of his
[1:10:59] brothers so that he could be
[1:11:03] king over this area that God had given
[1:11:07] him this Promised Land kills them one
[1:11:11] brother
[1:11:13] escapes this man
[1:11:16] um Gideon son he forms a league around
[1:11:21] with these with these different
[1:11:22] countries these different
[1:11:24] um cities and his brother comes that
[1:11:28] escapes and he
[1:11:31] curses Gideon he actually prophesies not
[1:11:35] Gideon but Gideon's son and he says
[1:11:37] listen if he cries out and says may the
[1:11:42] ones that you have made a league with
[1:11:44] may they hate you and may you hate them
[1:11:46] and may they destroy each other and they
[1:11:48] end up doing
[1:11:49] it and then this man Gideon's son
[1:11:54] dies so then the
[1:11:57] next judge
[1:12:00] toah he was a minor judge which just
[1:12:03] means the Bible doesn't say much about
[1:12:04] him he led Israel for 23 years after the
[1:12:07] death of ailec that's the one that I was
[1:12:09] just talking about Gideon's son who did
[1:12:11] all the bad stuff and killed 70 of his
[1:12:16] Brethren and then after toah was this
[1:12:19] man named
[1:12:20] jeepa now jeepa was was the son
[1:12:24] of an
[1:12:26] affair between a prostitute and his
[1:12:31] dad and the rest of his family they were
[1:12:34] more on a legitimate nature and being
[1:12:37] born from Jeff Jeff's father Gilead and
[1:12:41] Gilead's wife so jeffa was born from an
[1:12:44] affair with her prostitute so he was
[1:12:47] kind of the outcast and then all of his
[1:12:49] brothers were they they were just normal
[1:12:52] so Je to Drew up he grew up with his
[1:12:54] stigma and really he he was he was a bit
[1:12:56] of a thug he he was a tough guy but he
[1:13:00] was a mighty man and then God chooses
[1:13:03] this man jeepa to again deliver Israel
[1:13:07] from their enemies he became what we
[1:13:09] call a judge now a judge
[1:13:11] isn't sitting on a bench judging the law
[1:13:15] a judge is a military leader usually or
[1:13:18] a political
[1:13:19] leader now it's important to note that
[1:13:22] before Jeep
[1:13:24] it was again a period of sinful idolatry
[1:13:27] in Israel and the Israelites like the
[1:13:29] Canaanites worshiped Baal ASO and the
[1:13:31] gods of the Philistines gods of the
[1:13:33] moabites and Bas basically they
[1:13:35] worshiped anything but
[1:13:37] Jehovah this was ingrained in
[1:13:41] jeepa and you're going to see how we see
[1:13:45] this a little bit later one of the
[1:13:46] practices of the Canaanites was Human
[1:13:49] Sacrifice they'd sacrifice their
[1:13:51] children they would sacrifice others
[1:13:53] this was never the
[1:13:56] case with God except for
[1:14:00] Christ now Abraham was tested but he
[1:14:04] didn't kill his
[1:14:06] son so with that in mind listen to this
[1:14:10] story judges let's read it from the
[1:14:12] Bible Judges 11 verse
[1:14:18] 29 then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon
[1:14:22] jeepa and he passed over Gilead and
[1:14:25] Manasseh and passed over mispah of
[1:14:27] Gilead and from mispah of Gilead he
[1:14:29] passed over until the children unto the
[1:14:32] children of Ammon you see that then the
[1:14:36] spirit of the Lord Came Upon
[1:14:39] jeepa that's what happened with each of
[1:14:41] these each of these judges now we look
[1:14:46] and we think that that Spirit that's
[1:14:47] obviously the Holy Spirit but this is
[1:14:50] not the same thing that happened at the
[1:14:51] day of Pentecost what happened at the
[1:14:53] day of Pentecost is that same Spirit
[1:14:55] That Came Upon jeepa that same Spirit
[1:14:58] Came Upon 120 in the upper room but it
[1:15:02] dwelled there that same Spirit That Came
[1:15:06] Upon Samson and all these judges that
[1:15:09] would come upon them and then
[1:15:11] leave when it came to the day of
[1:15:14] Pentecost it came in there and then it
[1:15:16] took up residence in these people which
[1:15:18] had never happened this is an anointing
[1:15:21] that would come upon these
[1:15:23] and he passed over Gilead and manasse
[1:15:25] and passed over mispah of Gilead and
[1:15:27] from mispah of Gilead he passed over
[1:15:29] until the children of Ammon and Jeep the
[1:15:32] vowed a vow unto the Lord now watch the
[1:15:36] influence and said if Thou
[1:15:39] shalt without fail deliver the children
[1:15:42] of Ammon into mine hands then it shall
[1:15:45] be that whatsoever cometh forth of the
[1:15:47] doors of my house to meet me when I
[1:15:51] return in peace from the children of
[1:15:52] Ammon shall surely be the Lord's and I
[1:15:55] will offer it up for a burnt
[1:15:58] offering now I can't say for
[1:16:02] sure obviously I know that he didn't
[1:16:05] think what was going to happen would
[1:16:09] happen but I also can't think that he
[1:16:13] thought he may have thought that what
[1:16:15] was going to come out my front door
[1:16:16] would have been a goat or would have
[1:16:19] been my my little dog that I love so
[1:16:21] much and I would sacrifice that jepa may
[1:16:24] have thought that but something happened
[1:16:27] that he never would have thought so jepa
[1:16:31] passed over unto the children of Ammon
[1:16:33] to fight against them and the Lord
[1:16:34] delivered them into his hands and he
[1:16:36] smote them from aora even till Thou come
[1:16:42] to menth even 20 cities and under the pl
[1:16:45] of The Vineyards and with a very great
[1:16:47] SL Slaughter thus the children of Ammon
[1:16:50] were subdued before the children of
[1:16:51] Israel and jeepa came came to mispah
[1:16:54] unto his house and behold his daughter
[1:16:58] came out to meet him with timl and
[1:17:01] dances and she was his only child beside
[1:17:05] her he had neither son nor daughter and
[1:17:09] it came to pass when he saw her that he
[1:17:12] rent his clothes and said alas my
[1:17:14] daughter thou Hast brought me very low
[1:17:17] and thou art one of them that trouble me
[1:17:20] for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord
[1:17:22] in k cannot go back so here jeepa he
[1:17:27] says Lord whatever if if you will give
[1:17:30] me the victory whatever walks out my
[1:17:32] door I'm going to
[1:17:35] sacrifice and it was his
[1:17:38] daughter so she comes out and I know
[1:17:41] that there's a debate with theologians
[1:17:43] and Scholars whether he sacrificed her
[1:17:45] or not or or if it was a if he was
[1:17:50] metaphorically speaking or whatever it
[1:17:52] was but it says right here that he was
[1:17:55] very very sad so it looks like he
[1:17:58] actually did do this terrible
[1:18:02] thing um one okay that's a sad story
[1:18:06] let's tell a nicer
[1:18:08] Story one of the one of the things
[1:18:11] though we have we have this these
[1:18:12] fighting factions here with with jeepta
[1:18:15] and the different ones so there was
[1:18:17] these ones the
[1:18:19] gileadites and uh there was the the
[1:18:22] ephraimites
[1:18:23] and they're they're battling and and
[1:18:25] everybody looked the same back then they
[1:18:27] were they were all kind of from the same
[1:18:28] lineage and the two armies were fighting
[1:18:32] and the gileadites won and captured this
[1:18:37] River Crossing that led back to Ephraim
[1:18:41] so the ephraimites they they would go
[1:18:43] out and battle or do whatever and they
[1:18:44] would come back and they had to cross
[1:18:46] the river here at this Ferry or whatever
[1:18:48] it was and whenever an ephraimite wanted
[1:18:52] to cross
[1:18:53] cross the gileadites would ask if they
[1:18:57] were an ephraimite now the gileadites
[1:18:59] controlled the
[1:19:00] crossing if they said no the gileadites
[1:19:05] tested them and they said say
[1:19:10] shth and the ephraimites didn't
[1:19:12] pronounce it right so it'd be like it'd
[1:19:16] be like somebody from
[1:19:18] Georgia where my family's from telling
[1:19:22] somebody from two on all right if you
[1:19:24] want to come and you want to cross the
[1:19:25] swany river or whatever it
[1:19:28] is say you
[1:19:33] all and the the the arizonans would say
[1:19:37] you all no it's
[1:19:40] y'all so it was like that it was a way
[1:19:43] of saying
[1:19:45] things so jeepa LED Israel for six years
[1:19:49] when he died and he was buried in Gil
[1:19:52] Gilead now Judges chapter 12 let's go
[1:19:56] through the rest of the judges quick the
[1:19:58] these next three judges they're minor
[1:19:59] judges the Bible says very little about
[1:20:02] them so let's go ahead and read it
[1:20:03] judges 12 verse
[1:20:06] 7 and it says this and jeepa judged
[1:20:10] Israel six years and then died jeepa the
[1:20:13] gileadite and was buried in one of the
[1:20:15] cities of Gilead and after him is iban
[1:20:20] of Bethlehem judged Israel and he had 30
[1:20:24] sons and 30 daughters whom he sent
[1:20:25] abroad and took in 30 daughters from
[1:20:28] abroad for his sons and he judged Israel
[1:20:31] seven years then died iban and was
[1:20:34] buried at Bethlehem and after him Elon a
[1:20:38] Zebulon judged Israel and he judged
[1:20:40] Israel 10 years and Elon the zebul died
[1:20:44] and was buried in
[1:20:45] aelon in the country of zebulun and then
[1:20:50] after him
[1:20:51] abdon
[1:20:53] the son of hel the parite panite judged
[1:20:57] Israel and he had 40 sons and 30 nephews
[1:21:00] and rode on three score and 10 asts and
[1:21:04] he judged Israel eight years and abon
[1:21:07] abdan the son of H the panite died and
[1:21:10] he was buried in Pon in the land of
[1:21:13] Ephraim in the Mount of the amalekites
[1:21:16] so we don't know much about those
[1:21:18] judges the next judge everybody knows
[1:21:21] about is the most famous
[1:21:24] judge which is Samson so let's read a
[1:21:27] little bit about Samson and then we'll
[1:21:30] finish up so Samson is the 12th and
[1:21:33] final judge of Israel Judges 13 and the
[1:21:38] children of Israel did Evil again in the
[1:21:41] sight of the Lord couldn't have guessed
[1:21:43] that over and over again and the Lord
[1:21:46] delivered them into the hand of the
[1:21:48] Philistines 40 years and there was a
[1:21:50] certain man of Zora of the family of the
[1:21:52] D ites whose name was monoa and his wife
[1:21:55] was Baron and bar not and the angel of
[1:21:57] the Lord appeared unto the woman and
[1:21:59] said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren
[1:22:02] and bearest not but Thou shalt conceive
[1:22:04] and bear a son now therefore beware I
[1:22:07] pray thee and drink not wine nor strong
[1:22:10] drink and eat not any unclean thing for
[1:22:13] Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son
[1:22:16] and no razor shall come on his head for
[1:22:18] the child shall be a Nazarite unto God
[1:22:20] from the womb and he shall begin to
[1:22:22] deliver Israel out of the hands of the
[1:22:28] Philistines and deliver Israel out of
[1:22:31] the Phil out of the hands of the
[1:22:32] Philistines he certainly did the Bible
[1:22:35] says that Samson sought an
[1:22:38] occasion against the Philistines he
[1:22:41] married a Philistine girl had problems
[1:22:44] with her family he ends up burning down
[1:22:48] all of their
[1:22:49] crops he gets angry
[1:22:53] tears down everything that he sees
[1:22:57] that's that's with that's within these
[1:22:59] these Philistine people they they come
[1:23:02] and they hate him and they're trying to
[1:23:03] kill him he goes out in the field he s
[1:23:06] he they they attack him he sees the
[1:23:08] jabone of a mule there a donkey he picks
[1:23:11] it up kills a thousand Philistines just
[1:23:15] is raised up to kill
[1:23:18] Philistines that was his job and he did
[1:23:21] a very very good job of
[1:23:24] it he continues
[1:23:28] on and ends up killing and his death
[1:23:33] kills 3,000 Philistines you know the
[1:23:36] story about when Delila his girlfriend
[1:23:40] worldly girl don't date worldly girls
[1:23:44] because they'll mess you up but he dated
[1:23:46] this worldly girl and she ends up
[1:23:50] finding the secret of his strength
[1:23:53] and
[1:23:55] um has his hair cut they gouge out his
[1:23:59] eyes they bring him to the
[1:24:01] stadium and he says let me just put my
[1:24:05] hands on the pillars that hold up the
[1:24:08] stadium they put his hands there they're
[1:24:10] all making fun of him and then Samson
[1:24:15] pushes and the pillars come down the
[1:24:18] whole stadium comes down upon Samson
[1:24:21] that and 3,000 Philistines with him we
[1:24:23] all know the story very famous story
[1:24:25] about Samson he is the last judge the
[1:24:29] rest of the
[1:24:30] judges that that was the last one
[1:24:32] there's a couple more chapters in the
[1:24:34] book and it can be summed up with this
[1:24:36] in Judges chapter 17 verse 6 says in
[1:24:41] those days there was no king in Israel
[1:24:45] but every man did that which was right
[1:24:47] in his own eyes there's two stories to
[1:24:49] close the book the first one really just
[1:24:51] shows how deeply Israel had fallen into
[1:24:55] idolatry this man there's this man named
[1:24:58] Micah he's a fairly rich man he hires
[1:25:00] this levite priest and uh the musicians
[1:25:04] can come and we'll close he hires this
[1:25:05] levite priest priest this levite priest
[1:25:10] serves Micah and he has this these like
[1:25:13] this temple with this Idols in it and
[1:25:15] these these clothes that the priests
[1:25:18] wear when they when they're worshiping
[1:25:20] these Idols so then this invading Army
[1:25:23] of 600 men from the tribe of Dan
[1:25:26] basically Rob this man
[1:25:28] Micah and they take his metal God and
[1:25:32] his religious garments and the the
[1:25:33] religious tools that he has and then he
[1:25:35] made they made the levite an
[1:25:39] offer and the priest basically he saw
[1:25:42] that there's 600 men or he could stay
[1:25:44] with this this Micah guy and he says
[1:25:46] well this is better for me I'll just go
[1:25:49] I'll go for where the money is and and
[1:25:52] I'll go with these 600 men they ended up
[1:25:55] killing a bunch of people burning down a
[1:25:57] town and it was just it was just sin
[1:26:01] just full of sin I mean you see this
[1:26:04] Minister and he's saying that yeah I'll
[1:26:07] go I'll go with you and we'll take these
[1:26:10] Idols he was a levite should have known
[1:26:13] the word of Moses we'll take these idols
[1:26:15] and I'll I'll bring them and I'll go
[1:26:17] with you and I'll serve you because it's
[1:26:19] a bigger church or there's more money or
[1:26:21] whatever it is
[1:26:22] just and then just violence and sin and
[1:26:26] then it goes into the last
[1:26:28] story that is really the absolute most
[1:26:33] awful story in the whole book where it
[1:26:37] it's just a it's a story that's filled
[1:26:39] with just sexual deviant homosexuality
[1:26:42] and violence and and death and it just
[1:26:48] it's a it's sin just pure unadulterated
[1:26:53] sin and it ends up with Israel having
[1:26:56] their first Civil War and as before they
[1:27:00] were even a country even had a
[1:27:02] functioning government so that's the end
[1:27:05] of the our Book of Judges on our Bible
[1:27:08] study our Wednesday night bible study
[1:27:12] um a tragic
[1:27:15] book that just shows the nature of
[1:27:18] humanity and how we always do it
[1:27:23] and God will send us a
[1:27:26] prophet in this case send a military
[1:27:29] leader out of his own kindness his own
[1:27:33] love bring the people
[1:27:36] out show Mighty works and then he'll
[1:27:40] take that servant of the Lord away and
[1:27:43] the people go right back into where they
[1:27:48] started it's the story of humanity but
[1:27:51] one day that cycle is going to
[1:27:53] stop brothers and sisters Tucson
[1:27:56] Tabernacle we need to be right when that
[1:27:59] cycle stops because when it stops
[1:28:03] there'll be no Redemption anymore
[1:28:05] there'll be no salvation anymore there
[1:28:08] will be a time that God will take his
[1:28:10] his people out it will come a
[1:28:13] tribulation as I
[1:28:16] said and then there'll be no more flesh
[1:28:19] sa and that's the time that we're coming
[1:28:21] we see the we see the signs we see that
[1:28:24] God did in fact send a
[1:28:27] messenger send a prophet to call the
[1:28:30] people out like Gideon like Samson like
[1:28:34] all of these ones like this Prophet that
[1:28:36] came this mysterious man that came to
[1:28:39] Gideon and preached to him and and told
[1:28:42] him why have they why have they done
[1:28:45] this and here we
[1:28:48] are I don't know what 3,500 years years
[1:28:53] after this Book of Judges was written
[1:28:55] 3,000 years whatever it is after this
[1:28:57] Book of Judges was
[1:28:58] written and we see the same nature of
[1:29:02] human
[1:29:04] beings being a
[1:29:06] disobedient group of people let's all
