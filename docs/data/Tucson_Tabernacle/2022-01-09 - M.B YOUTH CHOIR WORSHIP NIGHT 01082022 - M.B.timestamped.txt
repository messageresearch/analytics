[22:13] seasons here and i said yes we do but
[22:15] you're not here one weekend you might
[22:17] miss one of them
[22:19] they're just fleeting but if you're here

[22:38] amen amen
[22:42] praise the lord
[22:44] uh i want to thank brother aaron
[22:47] and uh all the um
[22:50] uh the the saints here at tucson
[22:53] tabernacle we just really appreciate
[22:56] you hosting this event tonight
[22:59] some of you all that don't know me i am
[23:01] brother jack duff
[23:03] from sunny south florida
[23:05] and we have weather just like this in
[23:07] florida this time of year so
[23:10] uh but we we thank god to be here
[23:12] tonight and um i just wanted to uh open
[23:15] with a couple things first of all a
[23:17] scripture
[23:18] uh that i want to read to you tonight
[23:28] this is from ii chronicles
[23:31] chapter 20
[23:33] and verse 20.
[23:39] amen
[23:41] it says
[23:43] and they rose early
[23:46] in the morning and went forth into the
[23:47] wilderness of toccoa and as they went
[23:50] forth
[23:51] jehoshaphat stood in
[23:54] and said hear me o judah and ye
[23:56] inhabitants of jerusalem
[23:59] but we believe in the lord your god
[24:02] so shall ye be established
[24:05] believe his prophets
[24:07] so shall you prosper
[24:10] and when he had consulted with the
[24:12] people
[24:14] he appointed singers
[24:16] unto the lord that should praise the
[24:18] beauty of holiness
[24:20] as they went out before the army
[24:23] and to say praise the lord for his mercy
[24:26] endureth forever
[24:28] when they began to sing
[24:31] and to praise the lord praise
[24:34] uh the lord set ambushments against the
[24:38] children
[24:39] of amman moab and mount seiyer which
[24:42] were come out against judah and they
[24:45] were smitten and i was just thinking on
[24:47] that
[24:48] as the worship is going forth tonight we
[24:50] don't know the condition of every heart
[24:52] that might come into this building
[24:55] tonight
[24:56] some may come free some may come bound
[25:00] and need to be delivered and god is able
[25:02] to use the songs to bring deliverance to
[25:05] somebody
[25:06] right and as as as their worship in the
[25:09] lord i believe uh god sets ambushments
[25:12] on the enemy right and and maybe
[25:15] somebody has not been in church for a
[25:16] long time they just began to feel the
[25:18] presence of the lord and ambushments are
[25:21] being set
[25:22] right and freedom is about to be
[25:24] pronounced on somebody so we're trusting
[25:26] that god will just do great things here
[25:28] tonight let's just keep reading here uh
[25:30] in the scripture
[25:32] um
[25:33] see what verse did i stop at
[25:36] 23 okay thank you
[25:38] verse 24 says
[25:41] i start at 23. okay for the children of
[25:43] oman and moab stood up against the
[25:45] inhabitants
[25:46] uh of mount seir utterly to slay and
[25:49] destroy them and when they had made an
[25:51] end
[25:52] of the inhabitants of seer everyone
[25:55] helped to destroy another and when judah
[25:58] came toward the watchtower in the
[25:59] wilderness they looked unto the
[26:01] multitude and behold they were dead
[26:03] bodies falling to the earth and
[26:05] non-escape
[26:06] and when jehoshaphat and his people came
[26:08] to take away the spoil of them they
[26:10] found among them in abundance both
[26:12] riches with the dead bodies and precious
[26:15] jewels which they stripped off for
[26:17] themselves
[26:18] more than they could carry away and they
[26:19] were three days in gathering of the
[26:21] spoil it was so much
[26:24] and on the fourth day
[26:26] uh uh actually you know that's good
[26:29] right there i can stop right there um
[26:32] but you know when you just look at that
[26:34] you notice they didn't even have to
[26:37] use a weapon
[26:40] it was anointed from the singing
[26:43] that changed the whole condition
[26:46] and we pray that tonight that the
[26:48] singing will be anointed
[26:50] it's not just about gifts that god has
[26:53] given but it needs to be anointed
[26:54] because it's the anointing
[26:57] that destroys
[26:59] the yoke
[27:00] and now tonight um
[27:03] as i mentioned i'm from i'm from south
[27:05] florida but this choir that you're here
[27:07] tonight
[27:08] is a uh
[27:10] not only a national but international
[27:13] choir
[27:14] and this is one of the products of covet
[27:21] you know they didn't want us to get
[27:22] together and have church and things of
[27:24] this nature but but uh what what some of
[27:27] these young people did brother lisa paul
[27:29] right here stand up for the least stand
[27:30] up for the lease
[27:31] uh let's give him a round of applauses
[27:34] [Applause]
[27:40] brother lee's had an inspiration to kind
[27:42] of put this together and you know how
[27:43] some people use zoom for meetings they
[27:45] were using zoom for rehearsal and uh you
[27:48] know and they were just practicing and
[27:50] we got saints from all over i don't know
[27:53] all the states the ones that i i can
[27:55] think of off the top of my head
[27:56] iowa
[27:58] um
[28:00] kentucky
[28:01] texas
[28:03] maine
[28:04] new york
[28:06] florida
[28:09] virginia
[28:11] colorado north carolina
[28:14] michigan new jersey
[28:18] tucson
[28:20] arizona
[28:22] praise the lord
[28:26] so only god could orchestrate a choir
[28:28] like this
[28:30] and uh and i believe tonight that you
[28:32] are going to be absolutely blessed amen
[28:34] by
[28:35] uh the singing and i will also tell you
[28:38] um
[28:40] you know
[28:41] uh i believe everybody gonna have at
[28:44] least one song
[28:46] that they'll be blessed by
[28:48] at least one
[28:50] so find one that you can enjoy
[28:52] it might be another thing i don't know
[28:54] about that but but just
[28:57] you know what it's young people trying
[28:58] to serve the lord somebody told me i
[29:00] want the choir to start making your way
[29:01] up here um uh get ready for your first
[29:04] song
[29:04] uh but someone just told me this today
[29:08] they said um
[29:10] there was you know we're going through a
[29:11] time where a lot of people are leaving
[29:13] the message
[29:14] but believe it's prophets and you'll
[29:16] prosper
[29:17] that's what we just read in scripture
[29:19] and and uh there was a a statement made
[29:22] by
[29:22] um someone that left a message that said
[29:24] it was their job they felt it was their
[29:26] job to try to get every young person
[29:30] to leave this message
[29:32] and actually i think they got a job that
[29:33] they're going to be put out of work
[29:36] they won't be able to do that and and
[29:38] what you have here tonight are some
[29:40] young people that are determined to
[29:41] serve the lord and in the midst of
[29:42] everything that's that's going on they
[29:44] are still holding on and and we thank
[29:47] god for them can we give them a round of
[29:48] applause as they come
[29:53] [Applause]
[29:57] now uh they are i i have to say this uh
[30:00] i mean they've done an excellent job
[30:02] just you know putting all this together
[30:04] but uh please don't just sit and look at
[30:07] them tonight
[30:09] but end to end
[30:11] and uh you know if you don't mind if you
[30:13] find a song that you're familiar with
[30:15] why don't you stand and be part of the
[30:17] choir out there in the audience
[30:19] amen i want to let you know that tonight
[30:23] there is only

[1:05:55] product of covid
[1:05:57] well i
[1:05:58] guess i could say i am also a product of
[1:06:01] covid that's when the lord got a hold of
[1:06:03] my life
[1:06:05] is when is when i wasn't in church
[1:06:09] that's when he got a hold of me when i
[1:06:10] was away from all that he had to
[1:06:12] i guess pull me to the back side of a
[1:06:14] desert and here i am in tucson in the
[1:06:16] desert now
[1:06:17] after all this i'm very thankful for the
[1:06:19] choir
[1:06:20] i haven't been asked to speak many times
[1:06:22] and i certainly
[1:06:23] haven't been asked to speak after talent
[1:06:25] like that
[1:06:27] that and the lord really
[1:06:29] using every gift up here
[1:06:31] i'm so thankful for all of you and the
[1:06:33] love i've felt this weekend from this
[1:06:35] group
[1:06:36] has been so real such christian love
[1:06:39] it's it's so contagious these it's so
[1:06:41] wonderful to meet all of you and get to
[1:06:44] share in worshiping the lord together
[1:06:47] so
[1:06:48] you know first john
[1:06:50] 4 8 says that
[1:06:52] if you don't love you don't know god it
[1:06:54] says he that loveth not
[1:06:56] knoweth not god
[1:06:58] for god is love
[1:07:01] and that's something we need
[1:07:03] today i can tell you when god got a hold
[1:07:06] of my life
[1:07:07] it wasn't
[1:07:08] powerful preaching it wasn't the seven
[1:07:10] seals it wasn't all those things are
[1:07:12] great it was people showing christian
[1:07:14] love to me
[1:07:15] that brought me back from the life i was
[1:07:17] living
[1:07:19] back to this this glorious this glorious
[1:07:22] faith i want to read you
[1:07:24] a verse of scripture
[1:07:26] that the lord laid on my heart if you'd
[1:07:27] like to stand with me
[1:07:29] comes out of revelation 3.
[1:07:34] and um
[1:07:36] before we read that let's bow our heads
[1:07:40] dear heavenly father
[1:07:42] i thank you lord jesus that we are all
[1:07:44] gathered here
[1:07:45] to worship you
[1:07:47] lord jesus that's what we want to do
[1:07:49] with our lives may we live
[1:07:52] worshiping you and glorifying you may we
[1:07:55] live a testimony lord jesus
[1:07:57] i pray that lives will be touched i pray
[1:07:59] that you would calm my nerves lord jesus
[1:08:02] and lord may your word come forth
[1:08:06] i pray lord jesus you'd anoint this this
[1:08:08] scripture as it goes forth
[1:08:10] and may
[1:08:11] may people understand
[1:08:14] and may your word come in power in jesus
[1:08:16] name amen
[1:08:19] revelation 3 20 says behold
[1:08:22] i stand at the door and knock
[1:08:25] if any man hear my voice and open the
[1:08:28] door
[1:08:28] i will come into him and will sup with
[1:08:31] him
[1:08:32] and he with me
[1:08:34] you may have your seats
[1:08:40] now
[1:08:41] like many of you here i grew up
[1:08:44] in a message church we call them message
[1:08:47] churches they preach the message of
[1:08:50] william branham as you all know i grew
[1:08:52] up in that church
[1:08:54] and i tried under my own ability for
[1:08:56] years and years and years and years to
[1:08:59] live the right kind of life
[1:09:01] and i just failed and failed and failed
[1:09:06] i tried
[1:09:07] i was there at the camps i was there at
[1:09:10] the services
[1:09:11] i worshiped i sang
[1:09:14] and i did everything i thought i had to
[1:09:16] do
[1:09:16] and i still just felt like i was coming
[1:09:18] up short
[1:09:20] time after time and i was wondering lord
[1:09:23] what what do i have to do you know
[1:09:26] i'm trying to find it for myself all
[1:09:28] these years and
[1:09:31] there's one thing wrong about that
[1:09:33] though all those things i did were good
[1:09:36] they all started with i
[1:09:39] and me
[1:09:42] when the focus needs to be on him
[1:09:44] you need to let him take control and
[1:09:47] that's what i didn't do up until
[1:09:50] cove it happened when i had to give
[1:09:52] everything to the lord now
[1:09:54] tonight i can tell you what he did for
[1:09:56] me and i can't tell you what he's done
[1:09:59] for you but i can tell you what he can
[1:10:02] do for you
[1:10:04] by what he's done for me
[1:10:06] so if i were to take a title tonight it
[1:10:08] would be the love of god and we read the
[1:10:09] scripture god is love the love of god
[1:10:14] so i was raised in a church and i was
[1:10:17] raised in a christian school going to
[1:10:19] devotions every morning and
[1:10:22] i left that school and i went to public
[1:10:24] school and began to
[1:10:26] go the way of the world
[1:10:28] and go the wrong way
[1:10:31] be amongst the wrong crowds participate
[1:10:34] in the wrong things
[1:10:36] and i have scars today because of it
[1:10:40] and brother branham says in thirst
[1:10:42] that if that if that wolf gets a hold of
[1:10:45] the deer
[1:10:46] and gets him
[1:10:48] if he doesn't get to water he's going to
[1:10:50] die
[1:10:52] now
[1:10:53] i can tell you when i was going the
[1:10:54] wrong way
[1:10:56] and doing things i shouldn't do i was
[1:10:57] smoking i was drinking i was doing
[1:11:00] things to my body that i knew were wrong
[1:11:03] but i never disbelieved the message and
[1:11:06] i never disbelieved the bible i couldn't
[1:11:08] do that in my heart i still believed but
[1:11:11] what i was doing is i was going the
[1:11:13] wrong way down the freeway
[1:11:15] because i was supposed to be in this
[1:11:16] lane going that way but instead i was in
[1:11:19] this lane going that way
[1:11:21] and what happens if you go the wrong way
[1:11:23] on the freeway you're to get hit
[1:11:26] and you're going to die
[1:11:28] because you're doing it your own way
[1:11:33] and i can tell you
[1:11:34] i reached a point in my life in in my
[1:11:37] i'm trying to go fast i've got 15
[1:11:39] minutes but i reached a point
[1:11:41] where
[1:11:42] i was out one night and i was doing
[1:11:45] things i shouldn't do
[1:11:47] and
[1:11:48] it was almost like an audible voice
[1:11:51] was in my head saying
[1:11:53] sinner
[1:11:54] why would you sin away your day of grace
[1:11:58] sinner why would you sin away your day
[1:11:59] of grace over and over and over again
[1:12:02] and i couldn't
[1:12:03] it was just like
[1:12:05] all around me just this voice sinner why
[1:12:07] would you sin away your day of grace
[1:12:09] sinner why would you sin away your day
[1:12:10] of grace
[1:12:13] i thought it was too late
[1:12:15] i thought why else would i hear this
[1:12:16] voice
[1:12:17] why else would i hear this voice
[1:12:20] and
[1:12:20] i can tell you
[1:12:23] if your life isn't right with the lord
[1:12:24] and you know the truth if you've been
[1:12:25] raised in a church like i have
[1:12:28] what the world will give you if you are
[1:12:30] lucky and i shared this with brother
[1:12:32] brooks earlier
[1:12:33] if you are lucky
[1:12:35] 10
[1:12:36] pleasure
[1:12:37] and 90
[1:12:39] pain
[1:12:40] and defeat
[1:12:41] and failure if
[1:12:43] if you are lucky
[1:12:46] that's if you are lucky and it ends in
[1:12:49] suffering and death
[1:12:51] as the scripture tells us that's the
[1:12:52] wages of sin
[1:12:56] and this road that we walk as christians
[1:12:58] is much harder
[1:13:00] it is much harder
[1:13:02] and it may seem every day like you can't
[1:13:05] do it
[1:13:06] and you're just a failure and you're so
[1:13:08] low
[1:13:09] but the payments are a lot different
[1:13:11] than the wages of sin
[1:13:14] amen
[1:13:19] all of my brothers myself and two other
[1:13:21] brothers are serving the lord today
[1:13:24] that's a result of parents who prayed
[1:13:27] and who believed on god
[1:13:30] that's the payment of this faith
[1:13:33] now i'm not a father
[1:13:35] i may never be a father
[1:13:37] but
[1:13:39] or if it's your brother or sister
[1:13:41] they're not gone
[1:13:42] there's not there's still hope for them
[1:13:45] we ought to have faith to believe for
[1:13:47] our lost loved ones
[1:13:50] don't give them up
[1:13:53] because i thought i was i was hopeless
[1:13:56] and the lord could still do something
[1:13:58] for me
[1:14:03] now with this faith and with this
[1:14:05] blessing that we have
[1:14:07] you'll forgive me i'm
[1:14:10] still a little bit nervous but i'm just
[1:14:12] trying to get this made clear to you
[1:14:14] with this faith there's victory joy love
[1:14:17] any the end result of eternal eternal
[1:14:20] life
[1:14:21] but we have a much greater
[1:14:22] responsibility
[1:14:25] right
[1:14:26] we have a greater responsibility because
[1:14:29] we know things that most people do not
[1:14:31] know
[1:14:33] and it is not our job to be
[1:14:35] condescending and to judge others
[1:14:38] for their state
[1:14:40] now i told you at the beginning that
[1:14:43] when the lord got a hold of my life it
[1:14:44] wasn't because
[1:14:46] i was in a powerful service i believe in
[1:14:49] powerful services and powerful preaching
[1:14:51] people get saved that wasn't my
[1:14:52] testimony but i still believe in it was
[1:14:56] people reaching out to me and saying
[1:14:58] brother
[1:14:59] how are you doing
[1:15:02] we should go out to coffee
[1:15:05] and bringing me back into that
[1:15:07] atmosphere
[1:15:08] and i tell you if you know the truth and
[1:15:09] you're in that atmosphere you can't last
[1:15:11] long in the world
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:19] people reaching out to me and i had
[1:15:20] friends who were christians friends who
[1:15:23] were raised in the message like myself
[1:15:25] friends who were not christians all the
[1:15:26] different
[1:15:28] i guess types of different people i met
[1:15:30] uh at school and in the world that had
[1:15:33] all the same struggles who were doing
[1:15:34] all the same things as me
[1:15:36] and
[1:15:37] when the lord got a hold of my life
[1:15:41] i never went the way of the world again
[1:15:45] and a lot of those friends are still
[1:15:46] going that way
[1:15:48] but i still believe that god can do for
[1:15:50] them what he can do for me now you might
[1:15:52] have made a decision in your life
[1:15:54] to come to this message come to this
[1:15:56] faith and god will reward you for that
[1:16:00] by giving you your heart's desire
[1:16:03] so if you have someone wayward
[1:16:05] god got a hold of you
[1:16:07] that righteous seed is in you
[1:16:10] he can still get a hold of your family
[1:16:12] he can still get a hold of your friends
[1:16:15] love god is love
[1:16:18] we need to have that on display because
[1:16:20] that's how god got a hold of me
[1:16:22] is by his love through the believers
[1:16:33] i want to read another verse of
[1:16:35] scripture
[1:16:37] and it's in matthew 5
[1:16:40] and it is
[1:16:42] blessed are they
[1:16:44] which do hunger and thirst after
[1:16:46] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:16:50] now we all have a little place in our
[1:16:51] heart that's thirsting for something
[1:16:55] and i tried to fill it with something
[1:16:57] else
[1:16:59] and i was robbing god of that place in
[1:17:01] my heart
[1:17:02] that place belongs to god
[1:17:05] and the devil would love to come in and
[1:17:07] take control of that and fill it up so
[1:17:09] there's no room for god
[1:17:12] and as jesus said to peter he would love
[1:17:14] to sift you as wheat
[1:17:19] and if i would have stayed out there too
[1:17:20] much longer i believe i wouldn't be here
[1:17:23] today
[1:17:24] i might not be on this earth
[1:17:28] anymore but that thirst
[1:17:32] you cannot
[1:17:33] give it to the devil
[1:17:37] like i said before
[1:17:38] ten percent pleasure if you're lucky
[1:17:42] and ninety 90
[1:17:43] defeat
[1:17:45] pain
[1:17:46] suffering and death
[1:17:49] so i pray tonight that
[1:17:53] you would see
[1:17:55] and you would feel where that place in
[1:17:57] your heart
[1:17:59] you'd know to give it to god the talents
[1:18:01] that he's given you the gifts that he's
[1:18:02] given you just give them back to god
[1:18:05] and watch him take over as brother
[1:18:07] lincoln said last night
[1:18:08] you it may look like you are sacrificing
[1:18:10] a lot a lot of friendships
[1:18:14] a lot of opportunities but he will give
[1:18:16] back in ways you never imagined
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:23] i sang last night and i always want to
[1:18:25] sing for god's glory
[1:18:28] and
[1:18:30] people from new york
[1:18:31] and los angeles wanted me to
[1:18:34] come there and sing and sing in secular
[1:18:36] songs and
[1:18:38] in uh
[1:18:40] i wouldn't do it
[1:18:42] and it seemed at the moment like it was
[1:18:44] a big sacrifice and i went around in a
[1:18:47] time of my life
[1:18:49] discouraged you know i had this great
[1:18:50] opportunity but being here this weekend
[1:18:55] no one out there is talented like you
[1:18:58] no one out there sings like you because
[1:19:00] you're anointed for the right purpose
[1:19:03] and when we worship we're anointed to
[1:19:05] worship him
[1:19:07] and that's the greatest thing we could
[1:19:08] do

[2:47:17] what i
[2:47:18] i come to to a place in my life
[2:47:22] as brother brandon would say
[2:47:24] doctrine doesn't mean a thing
[2:47:28] when that squeeze come on

[2:47:34] about what doctrine somebody else is
[2:47:35] believing
[2:47:38] and you and i know it's coming
[2:47:41] we see this thing mounting up
[2:47:43] we might not get another year to have
[2:47:45] such a thing
[2:47:47] whether it be here or somewhere else
[2:47:50] and i am so glad to know how
[2:47:53] or to see how many are still standing
