redeemed amen it's amazing when you think where you could have been but what he's done for you it you're still your heart enough to say I just want to thank him I just want to love him I Just Want To Praise Him amen our sister Rebecca Z Brun in his ass and said many prayer unspoken prayer requests there's probably not one of us that would say the same thing oh Lord every moment and every day I need your help our brother Glenn tambling son is as you heard him brother Jordan and the family are are with him and uh they took him up to the hospital I believe it was in Phoenix and U he had some internal bleeding and he let brother Daniel uh Lo know last night that he's doing much better they uh did a procedure on him and they were able to remove some of the obstructions but he did ask to remember in prayer as they done the biopsy to what the results would be so and then yesterday my daughter Sarah had gone in for dialysis and she had skipped one day CU she wasn't feeling well and she was carrying about 5 kilos of water that that's a lot of extra water to have in your body and and that what that water fills all the voids in your body it gets in between your lungs and all and gets hard to sleep and all so she went in and the port had a leak in it an air bubble and they couldn't find and it's dangerous because if you get the air bubble into your blood system it could be very serious so she came to the house early afternoon around 3:00 and she said I've got to go to the hospital over to St Mary's they've got got to find the problem so my wife and her went and um they weren't able to see her for about 5 hours because it was so busy and they only had one doctor thank you and um it's a cold time of the the year and the homeless people they come they walk into the hospital CU they get some attention so was quite busy so around 11 11:00 she was able to be seen and they couldn't find where the leak was from what was causing that and just one of the text one of the guys there he was there and he goes wait a minute I think I see something and she had called and they had called in and said can you pray that that they would find this and we were in prayer for it and on the outer section of the of the port they found a small crack and he just happened to notice it but I know who was watching over it's is just a minute little crack so they were able to work on her and this is going on between 1 and 4:00 in the morning and so she was texting us and as they're prepared to give her treatment and and work it and put the temporary port in they have to give her medicines and she began to vomit she couldn't stop and so she's texting us and we're praying and I was listening to a message and brother random says God likes to do things at the last moment now you and I don't like it sometimes where are you Lord but he knows what he's doing and I was just listening to that so I sent him that portion of the quote I said just trust in God he will be there so they were able to get that resolved she should be in the hospital for about an a a week taking care of her but this morning she not a month a a week so I appreciate God being merciful and if you have a request you raise your hand and say Lord remember me sometimes you can't put it into words but you know you have a need of some let's just bow our heads father this morning we thank you that we can gather you've given us the privilege Lord to live in a place where it's cold for us but Lord in other parts of the country they are suffering today across the world there's so many things happening Lord but we have a privilege to gather with our brothers and sisters of of like Precious faith today and gather in a place where you said where two or three are gathered you'd be in our midst Lord so we're believing that Lord we're trusting in that Lord we ask you to forgive us of anything where we've done wrong or failed you lord lord and you've heard the requests our sister Rebecca Z BR and many unspoken prayer requests and many hands were raised Lord for brother Glenn tambling son and and all the family is affected Lord for my daughter Sarah in the hospital and and each one Lord father in a day where it's so cold and outside and all and and Lord we see many people just wrapped up walking on the side of the road trying to stay warm Lord but you've been good to us to give us a place to

gave us this morning as your spirit came down and singing that blessed old song May maybe 3,500 years old it was originally sang and we sang it again this morning this Psalm 34 Lord how great it is and how great you are father we thank you and we ask Lord that you would bless this service this morning be with us father May our everything that we do from the elections to the worship to the word may it all be pleasing to you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can be seated yes sir I feel like I could just yell it out today how how precious is the Lord Jesus don't you just love to worship him there's a story do you know the king you know who the king Jehoshaphat is you know the story about Ahab and Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat was a Godly King Jehoshaphat Was preparing to go to battle he was the king of Judah he was preparing to go to battle against an insurmountable Force Jehosaphat got his people together and the Bible says in first second 1st Chronicles chapter 20 I believe it is that he got his people together and he consulted the people yes sir and then he took his Warriors and all of his men of battle but he didn't send them to battle you know what he did he sent out the worshippers first and these worshippers went out and they went out praising the Lord like we're doing and and praising and singing praises to the Lord and and worshiping and praying and they went out and then this great insurmountable Force as they came down to attack Judah there were people laying in weit that no one knew were there ambushed all of these these this great Army and they fought and destroyed this Army that was coming against Judah and there the worshippers are worshiping praising the Lord and then after that these these ambushers they were still not God's people they after they came out and conquered the the the Army then they turned on themselves and they started fighting and they killed themselves so Jehoshaphat goes out with his Warriors and they look out and it was all dead people all from the worshippers yes sir that went forth so how important is our worship to the Lord amen you know in the Book of Revelation we talk about the different ages in Revelation 2 and 3 there is one thing in common that each age has and that is to them that overcome and we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the strength of Our Testimony and the word of Our Testimony and that's what we are here today we are here to overcome the enemy and there is prophesied a group of people brother Paul that will overcome and I'm among those people you know what I'm among those people today in this room I guess I'd better turn my computer on get my notes Here I just thankful just so thankful we have we have a special honor today we're going to have our our church election I um I believe it's very very important and I believe it's important we can't really find many elections that are in the Bible but brother brandham set a precedence with an election in his church we are a sovereign church but we are following his leadership in doing this I read this quote on Wednesday night I wantan I want to read it again this this blessed me it's from it's 1958 and I think just after that is when my grandfather Carl wheeler was elected to the office of deacon and it says this it says now I want to say too I see brother Egan and many of the trustees sitting here after we had our trustee meeting the other night it is true I publicly before the church that each one of you are no longer appointed trustees you are elected trustees and your name is on the books all right and now if they're going to have some more elections now they're going to have some more elections of deacons and so forth and brother Neville is will be calling those immediately after service all right and for the treasurer and so forth as we get the church set up get all remember the church was set up in 1933 this is in 1958 brother brandom is saying this so they're setting up the church again they're rededicating this they're move forward they're moving forward again again as we set the church up get it all backgrounds ready then we can have a Revival as it comes on how important are the little things things that we might not think are very important but they are important to God just like brother Josiah just like sending out those worshippers before Judah God it was important to him to be wor woried and the whole they conquered the whole the whole armies against him and they didn't lift a sword these things are important and we need to make sure that we are lining everything up that we can doing our best Lord just to fall into um compliance or into obedience to your word and doing our best not only here in church but in our homes and in our jobs and everywhere that that we're we go to and every person that we see we want to make sure that we are representing Jesus Christ in everything that we do um I I do want to make a couple announcements um we are going on a trip to Los cruus the last weekend of this month brother Dan numer sister Jessica um will be chaperoning also brother Jordan s sister Martha will be chaperoning I may also be going um and I want to invite we're going to we're going to get two Vans for the Youth and uh then I also want to invite everybody everyone who wants to go too I'd like to brother Caleb and the group there have done a lot for us they they really helped us with our youth meeting we had like four or 500 people they brought like a hundred of those people I would like to um show our support for them and in and as we go we are going to bring bring uh quite a bit of message brother brandom's message material books sermon books that will go to the country of Uganda brother Kim dingwall if you were here on Wednesday night he mentioned about the hundreds of thousands of new Believers and converts in in that country of Uganda and this material brother Caleb Perez in Las cruus has been a very very big part part of that and this material will be going to Los cruus and then ultimately it will be to the people in Uganda and let me tell you they will greatly greatly appreciate it it'll be more worth more than gold to them so we'll be doing that at uh at the end of this month um and uh also I believe that there is a banquet up in um in Phoenix evening night fellow we be having a banquet and uh if brother Dan if you want we can also get a van and U if if we have a group of people going up there and I'd like to also um provide transportation for that I'll I'll talk with you maybe later a little bit later on um these things are important we might not think that they matter that much much but as I said they matter to God our music and the worship it matters to him it's important renovating the church as we're about to start doing it matters it's important when people come into this church they need to be be made made to feel welcome and as they look around this church represents not us but it represents Jesus Christ and the feeling that they come that they walk in and they're they're greeted with it's important you may not think it's important it might not come into your mind but these things are important to God everything in this election that we have that we have today these brothers that I have nominated for these positions I believe that they they hold a very very important part of this of this service of this church brother Lyall and I was talking with the brothers out here just before we started and brother Lyle of course all the brothers are like brother I don't I don't feel worthy as we've talked a lot about this and how important these positions are and they say brother I don't really feel worthy to do it and and it's like I agree you're you're really not but it's an obligation brother Lyall was telling me he says well he says having this position he says in other words that now he's obligated and before he did it in his heart and he told me he says brother Daniel I'd do it no matter what but now there is an obligation there is an official position that they hold that is subject to to the people in serving all of us as a congregation when we see a church that the pastor is just for lack of a better word a dictator and I don't mean that necessarily always in a wrong term but someone that just has ultimate control over everything when you see that and the pastor's making all the decisions and all the financial decisions and and all of the spirit spiritual decisions and everything goes through the pastor and he takes all of that on himself often it results in a lazy congregation because they're relying on the pastor's walk with the Lord to make all of the decisions and that's not that's not the way the Lord set it up it's not the way it was set up in the book of Acts in the book of Acts you don't see one leader you see churches forming and you see people like Timothy it wasn't just Paul it was wasn't just Peter fact James was the pastor of the church in Jerusalem and you have all of these different Brothers doing different works and everyone had their own responsibility and that's how a body is all of us have a responsibility I heard a sister a couple sisters have come to me before with concerns and they have made the statement that they say brother Daniel I know I'm just a woman but don't ever say something like that a sister has a just as much of an important role in all of this it's just different it's just in not a position of authority sisters our children would not be good kids if it wasn't for Mama and that's how almost always there are exceptions of course but a good mother is the most important thing to a child and the sisters have roles in churches in this church also very very important roles I was talking with sister Elizabeth back there in the back and talking about how much she does just for people that you don't see giving rides to people helping people helping feed the people that need it these things are very very important and they they go unseen but vitally vitally important as I said if you have a pastor who takes too much on himself it does it results in a congregation that doesn't have a close enough walk with the Lord all of us are in this together remember the church is not a building where you gather on Sunday the church is a group of individ individual people excuse me who have dedicated their entire lives from the moment they wake up in the morning to the moment they fall asleep at night to serving God by making making disciples of the Lord Jesus don't think that church is Sunday morning Sunday morning is just a nice time that we can come together and fellowship together sing and praise the Lord together and hear a sermon but church is all the time every day this building right here is not the church this building should just help build a road for the for the believer to get to Christ but it's not this is not the church we the individuals of the church so we went over the qualifications on Wednesday of pastors and deacons and trustees and that and one thing that really struck me and it was a qualification in the pastor and I think it's something that all of us should have and in 1 Timothy it says that a pastor should have a good reputation with those that are outside the church I think how important is that that person that is in the church now is the same person that goes to work every day it's the same person that's driving on the highway it's the same person that comes home at night and makes makes dinner and all of this everything about being a Christian should be taken seriously to our lives and not not just while we're here I want to say I just noticed Sister Sarah God bless you it's good to have you back I'm glad that the Lord took care of you go God bless you and welcome back home sister Sarah's gone through some sicknesses it's um it's good to see you and continue to pray for your family your [Applause] sister how important is this word that we live it every day Isaiah 66 verse one it says this thus sayeth the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those things hath my mine hand made my my hand made all these things and all those things have been sayeth the Lord but to this man will I look this is the one that will get my attention even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word what words how many people in this room this is who I'm speaking to how many people in here open this book and tremble at what it says how many of us have that respect where we look at this and it fear comes into our our lives and into our hearts saying Lord am I living up to that these Stakes are very very high we don't take we should take communion we should take these Church elections we should take coming every day into the service of the lord we should take everything more seriously I don't want to do anything halfway if the word teaches us to take the bread and the wine worthily then I want to be on my knees praying and repenting for my sins if I'm going to be a member of this church I am going to be as important to this church as the pastor is don't do anything halfway do it the whole way if I have a gift of Music in my life I am going to take that gift and I am going to make disciples with that gift I am going to Worship the Lord like that story that I told about Jehoshaphat sending his worshippers out before how important you may not think a piano player is important until she's not there yeah give the our piano our musicians a [Applause] hand we got two of them right here these young ladies and then another sister Ho back there sister Martha's not here and brother Aaron and and and all of them that that contribut so much it's a Ministry and it brought down an entire Army how important is worship every Single part of what we do is vitally important you may not think it but God will use it Isaiah chapter 8 says this verse 13 it says sanctify the Lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and let him be your dread so often we fear about what people are going to say we fear about what they're going to think in coming to an election or making a Church decision We Fear maybe what the church is going to going to say or the directions or how they're going to complain or how they're going to worry we should never fear about anything if there's honesty in our heart and we're doing everything the best that we can right there is no fear ever in should be anywhere in us there's been some reporters going around I don't know if you've heard of them they came to our church and we recognized them they stood up and we clapped for them they've been going to different message churches and I'll tell you what you got these these pastors are scared to death right now I've had the brothers calling me saying oh well they showed up at this place and and they showed up at my church and and and they're worried Pastor what are you worried about if you're being honest and your life is lining up what are you worried about that somebody's going to dig into your life and find something it shouldn't be there in the first place and are you going to worry about they're GNA they're going to hear something brother brandom said and they're gonna they're going to attack us for it I'm proud of what he said I'm proud of all that he said for heaven's sakes I mean don't worry there should never be any fear in us if we are being honest no fear brother Lyall none I was but if we're doing things wrong then that fear will be present I was we had um we had a Christmas party it seems like a couple years ago it was probably 10 12 years ago in Jeffersonville and uh really nice party and and um the uh we all got gifts um and it was like a it wasn't like a gift exchange but it wasn't a personal gift but it was they were nice gifts and we all ended up with a gift when we left we played like a game that you play at Christmas time and the gift that I got it was from Dick Sporting Goods and I already had one I forgot what it was but I already had it so I felt like well I'll just take it back and I'll get a store credit and I need a new stationary bike I'll get I'll get that instead so I go there and I was kind of worried that somebody was going to see me taking my gift back so we get there I I'm sure it was was probably with Stephanie so we get there and I I I exchange the thing and they give me the little store credit and I'm looking around for something to replace my gift with something that I want and I get a phone call and it's the pastor's son one that gave me the gift and I was like oh so I answer the phone and he says hey Z bro he says uh he said where are you right now and you know what I said Bass Pro Shops which is right next to dicks I lied and I thought as right as I said that something said you did wrong like and you know how your brain can work really fast in a short amount of time I mean it was going and going and going and going and it was probably it seemed like like a minute but it was probably a fraction of a second and I was thinking oh you know going to know that I'm exchanging my gift and I just lied and I said I said actually I said I'm in Dick's Sporting Goods and he said I know he says I'm looking at you right [Applause] now I li and it was right it was right there and and it's it's so easy just to say something's wrong but that would have been a mark on me that would have been something to be ashamed of and I was ashamed of it that it came out of my mouth but thankfully I fessed up before I act I mean I was caught but I fessed up before um you know there's a king we all know there's I mention Jehoshaphat at the beginning there was another king about jehoshaphat's time was King Ahab Ahab was the king of the 10 tribes of Israel Jehoshaphat was the king of Judah and Benjamin so Israel was split into two basically two different uh countries for lack of a better word Jehoshaphat um was a good righteous man Ahab wasn't so much but Ahab was a man that was familiar with war and it got towards he was prophesied that a that he was going to die in battle yet he didn't believe what the prophet said and he went ahead and he went into battle to go against this enemy Army and josphat I mean and Ahab put on his armor and as he was out in his Chariot fighting an enemy Archer pulled back his bow now Ahab wasn't in his King garments he was disguised as somebody else the Archer pulled back his bow and shoots and randomly this Arrow comes down and ahab's in the back of his Chariot and he's going this Arrow comes down and there was a small Gap in ahab's armor and the arrow went right into that Gap and buried itself into Ahab Ahab tells the driver of his Chariot he says pull me from the battle he says I'm wounded so they go out and Ahab leans up against his Chariot and he's bleeding out and he's watching the battle and Ahab dies and as that as I was reading that I was thinking why was there a Gap in ahab's armor Ahab of course he was a man of war but he probably wasn't used to cinching up the armor of an inry entry um infantry man so he goes out and he must have not put it on correctly and it left a gap in there as I said he was a man familiar with war but that Gap caused him to lose his life and I think as as all of us as we are cinching up our armor is there something in our life that we leave unhinged and then that is the place where the enemy can come in right there as he did with Ahab I was speaking of Ahab um Donald Trump is a un I'm just kidding I hope he I don't care I I hope the country prospers that's that's what I hope but have you seen Donald Trump is on trial right now he's on trial you know what he's on trial for he's on trial because he he inflated his net worth on a loan application that was a in his armor so now as the enemy is coming against him to get him out of this election and destroy this man who they hate he did something wrong earlier and it left a gap as Ahab left a gap in his armor and it has allowed the enemy to come in and hit it him and hurt him and the way that it's going right now who knows what's going to happen he'll probably be he'll probably be on the ballot but how much do these people hate Donald Trump and let me tell you the enemy hates you far worse than anybody hates Donald Trump he wants us and he is going to study you he's going to watch you and and he's going to see where has this person left something undone you think it's just church you think it's just coming in here but there are things in our lives like me and Dick Sporting Goods where I just told this real simple little lie and it could open up a gap in our armor and cause us to be destroyed thinking of these these reporters coming in P Pastor people you better have a good life you better be honest you better be preaching things that are right because if you're not it opens up a gap in that armor and it will take us down remember Ain he goes in and and he and Joshua forbids them to take anything no one saw what aen was doing achen goes in he takes a wedge of gold and he takes a garment sneaks it doesn't hurt anybody nobody knows takes it and hides it and it causes men to to die in battle and then to lose the battle because of that one thing inside the congregation that no one knew oh my when they were asking about achen they're like who's this guy they said well he's from his dad is this his Grandpa's this he's from this tribe but it caused the whole congregation to suffer because of one little in the armor one little sin how many of us have those sins in our lives so we need to cinch up that armor for battle if you're going to school study like a Christian would study it's not just you think everything is spiritual don't just think it's when you come to church everything in our lives has to do with God if you're working on the construction site be a be the best employee like a Christian would if you're in church prepare before you get here be ready for God to do something if you're driving drive like a Christian somebody's watching you if you're walking walk like a Christian if you're talking talk like a Christian act like a Christian in every way and you say well he just won't speak to me if you're seeking the Holy Spirit are you praying don't just talk about it oh brother Daniel I'd really just pray for me that the Lord will give me the Holy Spirit are you praying are you fasting are you doing everything you can to hear God's voice we've talked about a Revival do you want a Revival do you want a Revival in this church yes sir are you looking at pornography come on are you lying on are you a good employee at work are you speaking evil against someone else even if it's true and you want a Revival wow those things need to be set aside also are we putting God in a box and telling them that telling him that a Revival needs to be people crying at the altar and the Lord and and falling down and speaking in tongues and and even then it has to be under this roof don't put God in a box sir I believe that we will have that but don't put put him in a box he could have a Revival anywhere he wants like when josaphat sent out the worshippers there are these great warriors and how many people have they killed and they're ready for battle it's like them these little skinny guys these girls and the Army was destroyed wherever you are whatever we are doing be there be there 100 100% if you're at work if you're studying for school if you're talking to somebody at the grocery store whatever you are doing be the best that you can be how many times have I heard people saying well I got to lose some weight stop eating so much well I'll do the keto diet I'll do the grapefruit diet I'll do whatever those don't none of them work you know that right they don't work God made a law he made a rule that if you take in more calories than you burn it will be stored as fat that's God's rule wow there's no way out of it and it's the same with everything in life if you study more in school you are going to be more successful I've always considered my biggest regret in life is that I didn't work hard enough I've always been someone that that was respected at work as a hard worker one that would stay longer one that would accomplish more and it was because of a work ethic that I had but I looked back on my life and I thought Lord think I I could have done so much more if I would have studied harder in school I would have been more successful if I would have worked harder spent more hours at work I would have have moved up faster if I would have studied more in my life I'd be a better Minister now maybe Daniel my son for years and years he would wake up with me at 4:30 in the morning 4:15 in the morning and I get up I'd study this blessed word buddy how much do you appreciate those times that we had together every day waking up for at least an hour and a half studying reading listening taking notes and trying to understand but even at that I wish I would have done more I'd be a better person today if I would have and all of us and I don't care now I'm 52 years old I want to start now in the things that I've I've left undone I want to work harder and I want to I want to be more successful I want to serve this church I want I want to see everyone here full of the Holy Spirit out preaching the gospel in some way yes whether it be praying for the sick or whether it be preaching in a park or whether it be singing and worshiping whatever it is I want to see everyone here ser serving God and winning souls to Christ it's my job is lifting it up and and watching these disciples go out and winning more disciples it may be your children may be your brothers your sisters your moms or your dads start close and then move out but spend the time you young people study work hard don't waste time you'll regret it when you're 30 when you're 40 when you're 50 I've told Daniel before that buddy if you study and you you work hard and you say I want to be Daniel has had it on his life his hard to be a nurse you can talk about it and talk about it and talk about it pretty soon you're going to be 30 40 50 years old and you're going to say well I always wanted to do this do it but it takes work it takes an effort I was talking with brother Kim dingwall out outside on Wednesday night we were talking about this generation and I was I was talking about Daniel and how Daniel he cares for um he's got a a part-time job where he cares for elderly and people that can't care for themselves that are in in in tough health health situ situations and Daniel's told me many times he's like Dad they don't have anybody that comes to see them they don't have a family their children don't care my first thought is what kind of a bad generation is this but then he talking to brother Kim out there he's like well maybe it's not that way he says he says that this is a generational problem and what was wrong was the parents didn't spend enough time with their children so now their kids and their grandkids don't want to spend time with them and they leave them alone so whose fault is it is it the kids or is it the parents I spent time with [Laughter] you as you can tell I'm I'm proud of my family we all have we all have problems I love my my son's my he's my best friend Galatians chapter 6 says this verse 7 says be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that sth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that Seth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting all of of that time that you put in all of those seeds that you're planting in your study and your prayer you are going to reap from those seeds they're going to grow and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we therefore as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them that are of the household of faith if you put the time into your job you are going to reap the benefits later on if you put the time as I said into school you are going to reap those benefits later on if you put the time into prayer you will reap those benefits later on I just preached the the message on Zachariah the father of John the Baptist and how he spent time the Bible says the angel came to him and said Zachariah God has heard your prayer that was a prayer it had to be from a long long time ago he was old and couldn't have children he wasn't praying then for a son or if the angel would have came to him he would have been like praise the Lord thank you it must have been years or decades earlier that he prayed that he reaped what Zachariah sold and God gave him the best son the son introduced Jesus Christ to the world as Jesus said a man's never been born of a woman greater than him he reaped what he sowed and that's for us make sure that that armor is tightened down because we'll reap for every lie that we say we will reap for every time we lie on a application for credit as Donald Trump did we are going to reap for every moment that we've spent studying our Bibles we are going to reap for every time that we came to church we are going to reap for every moment of prayer that we've had it says right here that let us not be weary and well-doing for a due season we shall reap if we faint not continue on keep trying keep keep trying don't faint don't get discouraged keep going one of those weaknesses in the armor may be that we're not willing to give I think it's very very common today it's it's common all around us give to your family give to your co-workers give to your church be willing to serve Ephesians chapter 6 a famous scripture but I want to read it in a way that you may not have seen it from a perspective that that you may not have seen and we'll close with this Ephesians chapter 6 vers1 it says this it says children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and thy mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest live long on the earth he's starting with things that are small here like me lying and Dix Sporting Goods don't do those things is what Paul's saying cinch up that armor and you fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord he's talking about the family and the little things in life how we should raise our children nurture them and love them and teach them about the Lord later we'll reap what we so servants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling and singleness of your heart as unto Christ that word servant is probably when it was written was probably a slave but today treat your boss well treat your supervisor well respect them that have rule over you whether it's here at work or here at church with a pure heart seek to please them as you would want to please Christ let me tell you if you do that you'll also be very successful in business you'll be successful in your job not with eye Service as men Pleasers but as the Servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart be sincere with your servitude don't just work when someone's watching and slack when they're not watching don't just serve somebody so you you'll get kudos from the church wow do it and don't let anybody know about it serve each other you don't have to get a thanks if you get a thanks then you have your reward but do it in private and let God take care of it I promise you God will give you a better reward than anyone from this Pulpit would give you with Good Will doing Service as to the Lord and not to men so we serve with all of our heart as you would serve the Lord Jesus Jesus is not here he's here in spirit and his PE and in his people and we serve each other as we would serve Christ knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the Lord whether he be Bond or free you reap what you sow and ye Masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect with persons for him if you're the boss be good to those people that are working for you treat them with respect don't use harsh words because you don't want Christ to use harsh words with you and you don't want your boss to use harsh words with you so you as you would want somebody to do to you remember that no no matter how important you think you are or how important of a position you have God has no partiality no matter what position you hold in Earth that includes the pastor of a church and includes the president of the United States you are no more important than anyone else that is in the church and God will not hear someone's prayers over someone else just because that person thinks he's important and by doing these things what are we ultimately accomplishing Paul's not talking about murder here these are little things he's not talking about adultery he's not talking about lying and all this and and and all this cheating and all this immorality he's talking about the little things that are in our lives every day so what is he trying to say remember Ahab in his armor it wasn't cinched up all the way there was a hole there finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may able to with be may be able to withstand the evil in in the evil day having done all to stand having done everything stand on the Gospel of Jesus Christ cinch up that armor when you are honest you're buckling up that armor lies loosen it up when you're studying your Bible you're sharpening that sword of the spirit faith comes by hearing the word when you're reading your Bible when you're coming to church when you're spending time learning the word you're buckling up that helmet strap I saw a guy one time in football he uh big lineman he um his helmet on and his chin strap was loose and you know they they're always banging on each other on the line and he hit and his helmet came because of his chin strap was loose it wasn't buckled up tight his helmet came down and hit him on the bridge of the nose right here and cut it open broke his nose he looked terrible brother tighten up the chin strap tighten up everything within our lives whatever it is stand therefore having your loins G about with the truth with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked Shield Buckle that stuff up Satan's shooting at us every one of us and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supp applications for all the saints so Tucson Tabernacle been talking about weakness in our armor and some of that weakness may be that we're not willing to give enough enough of our time enough of our prayers whatever we have to give we should give more the men that I've nominated for these positions they may not be the best qualified they may not be the most capable but they have shown that they are willing to give and they they're willing to try I really appreciated brother Aaron I think the Lord blessed blessed your sacrifice this morning in learning that song Psalms 34 brother Aaron was so nervous about about singing that and it just he number one he knows that I love it and Matthew mcfaden he used to singing and and Matthew had a had a certain type of a voice and he was young and and brother Aaron saw that it blessed the people so he he wanted to try and learn it and he did and it blessed us all and these brothers that I have nominated they have shown that they are willing to do their best they're willing to follow leadership both from me and from the holy spirit in their lives and as a church I don't want to do anything halfway I am not I'll tell you this I am not satisfied with this building I'm not satisfied with all of your walks with the Lord and I am not satisfied with my walk with the Lord there is so so much more to do we have got so much more we are on this Earth for just a short amount of time and I feel like now I'm 52 it's like Lord I'm I'm on the the last half here more than that there's so much to do Lord give me more time give me more life give me give me more strength to do it for when we're finished it's over there's no more serving God there's no more winning Souls there's just we'll go to our reward and we'll be in the presence of God and and with and with his Saints and and we'll have made it but I want to be able to look back and say that I was able to pull some of these out of the fire every one of us should have that same desire I don't care if you're a kid I don't care if you're 90 years old if you have breath in your lungs you should be trying to make a disciple to Jesus Christ not necessarily bring them to just this church but get them a relationship with God that is why we are here on Earth don't neglect that never be satisfied with your church never be satisfied with the minister and especially never be satisfied with yourself because there's more to do always be striving and pushing and working to get more of Jesus Christ musicians if you come I read this quote on Wednesday brother um Ed if you could pass out the ballots please I read this quote on Wednesday it meant meant something to me all the word means means something to me but this one especially touched my heart it says here and it touched my heart because my ancestors gave a lot to come to meetings like this just my the people that went before me that I'm I am benefiting today from what they've done as most of you are also says this and I have some real Royal friends there that are very fine people and so they're very loyal to go to church no matter how cold it is they'll wrap up in a blanket and sit on a bob sled and drive the horse for 30 miles to get to go to church those times are in the past they might come back but look at what our ancestors have done [Music] they'll walk through the snow drifts and everything else young and old they'll all group together and one family gets the other and they'll start walking and they go it's the sacrifice that they make is what causes them to get so much out of service when there's no sacrifice there's not very much to the service you have to really get down down and do something that hurts real bad have to lay aside some things and stop the work or do this or that to get to go to church and show God that you love him and you make a sacrifice to go it's then when you get something out of it amen that's something that all of us can learn from we should all put more effort into everything that we do is especially serving the lord in fact everything that we do should be serving the lord whether it's going to work whether it's helping somebody on the street doing a service to anyone always serve [Music] God for the vote you all know this but we're voting on the officers of the church and we're voting on the um bylaws of this church very very important brothers and sisters don't take this lightly and I hope you haven't to this point those who are eligible to vote or those who whose home church is this Tucson Tabernacle those who support the church financially and those who support the church also with their attendance and their prayers I know that there's many people that are maybe bedridden that can't get out of the house but they're also part of us those who are 18 years old and older with the exception of those that are at least 16 and they have a regular job and they're also contributing financially to the work here at the Tabernacle before I forget this evening service we'll have a prayer service tonight at 5 [Music] o' what we'll do right now is once you have voted and the brothers have picked up the ballots I've asked brother Dan Roberts and brother Ron glidewell brother Ron where are you there you are brother Ron glidewell to be witnesses as we count the votes so the three of us will go back here in the office we'll count the votes and we'll come out with the results acts 6 verse 1 says this and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied wouldn't you love to see those days sir more and more and more and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration then the 12 called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables wherefore Brethren look out ye among you seven of them of seven men of honest report full of Holy Ghost and wisdom who we may appoint over this business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the Ministry of the word and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose Steven A Man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost and Phillip and procus and niker and teemon and parmenas and Nicholas a prite of Antioch whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them so brothers and sisters I present this vote to you that it's not being taken lightly and once we have this done I believe that we have made another step in falling into line with the Lord and with his will and brother Paul I'm looking forward to that Revival that's coming as I said that it may not be under this roof it may be all of us going out full of the Holy Spirit winning Souls praying for the sick and having the sick healed casting out Devils the Devils of of drug abuse and the Devils of schizophrenia and the Devils of cancer and the Devils of sickness going out and doing that ask for big things and the Lord will deliver big things also but remember tighten up that armor don't let any don't let any holes be in there Amen brother [Music] thereon be glorified be glorified in my [Music] life be glorified come brother [Music] Ron in

overwhelmingly passed two with only five no votes and well over 150 yes votes very very important to our church moving forward and I am so happy I'm just so grateful I would like for brother Ed brother Arie brother Lyle brother Aaron if you could come stand down here brother Jordan is not with as we all know because he's up helping his family and if our new officials in the church could stand down here let me read one more time Acts chapter 6 says this this is the ordination of deacons it says wherefore Brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose Stephen right there is our vote and they chose Stephen I'm going to assume that that's a congregation may have been the disciples but I'm going to assume that that's the congregation and they chose Steven A Man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost and Phillip and procus and naner and Tean and parmenas and Nicholas a proelite of Antioch whom they set before the apostles and when they had laid when they had prayed they laid their hands on them and the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly and a great company of priests were obedient to the faith I claim the same thing for our church Brethren if if the elders in the church if the brothers would come forward please I want the brothers to come forward and I want to lay hands on these brothers so um Brothers if you could come also come on yes brother Tim I'm going to turn on my mobile microphone okay brother Jeremy also am I on okay good so brother Jeremy and brother Tim I also want you all to come up here so brothers and sisters this is the first time that this has happened in our church that we are now ordaining deacons and trustees so if everyone if all of you Brothers bow your heads and pray for these these Brethren that are going forth oh [Music] Lord [Music] father As I Lay My Hands on these brothers as your disciples did Father may they go forward and may the church increase and may they lead many souls to the Lord Jesus May the power that was upon Steven and upon philli rest upon these brothers and father in their positions of as trustee or deacons Lord may they accomplish those positions as true Christians filled with the Holy Spirit father may you guide every word everything that they do may they be anointed by your Holy Spirit and may the church benefit from it I pray father we pray over these bylaws Lord God that as time would move on Lord that they would stand strong and father lift up Jesus Christ before the people for this church and father may they be an example to other churches I pray we thank you Lord for everything that you've done for us now Lord we place these brothers into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ that they may do your work amen
