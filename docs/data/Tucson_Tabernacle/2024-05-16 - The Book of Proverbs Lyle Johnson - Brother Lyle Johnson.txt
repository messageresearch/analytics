amen I was listening to a brother speak here the other day and he was talking about about the coming of the Lord and he had talked about what had happened in the Garden of Eden and the separation and he said could you imagine Adam and Eve the very next day after they were cast out waiting in the cool of the evening for him to come by and he didn't come by that day and it really got me to thinking sometimes I say Lord just get me out of here I'm tired of this world I don't want the pain I don't want the trouble when it should be Lord I just want to go be with you oh I want to see him one more time oh I want to see him look there to sing forever of his Saving Grace all the streets of Glory let me LIF my there's all past home at last ever to rejoice and come and go with me to my father's

praise God you're here too w't to be w't to be worth it all amen just um thinking about that what other brother spoke and I said Lord let let my desire be to desire you and everything else will be taken care of but if we get that turned around we just want out to hear because we don't deal with this but it should be something where I was talking to brother Daniel about it and it's it's kind of like the young man and the young lady that were dating and he was telling her how much he would climb over the mountains to go see her and and and take cross the meanest River and they gave her all these thing that she said well come on over and he goes I can't it's raining you know and the Lord says come on come on up closer with me and we say Lord I've got this to do still and Lord I've got that to do but no I I just want to want to go home and be with him amen when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will [Music] be sing the wonderous love of Jesus Jesus sing his mercy and his gra in the Manion bright and blessing he'll prepare for us a place and when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus Will Sing and Shout the victory while we walk the paway clouds will over spread the but when traveling days are are over not a shadow not a SK and when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will when we all see Jes will sing and shout the victory let us then be true and faithful trting every day just one glimpse of him will the tongs of life prare and when we all get to heav what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus will sing and go onward to the prist before soon [Applause] will be home soon those Eary Gates will we shall Tre the streets of gold and when we all to have what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus we will sing the victory amen amen it's not going to it's not going to be how I overcame but it's just thanking him for being the Overcomer in US amen so didn't have any prayer requests but remember dad um it's been uh quite a struggle and I I know he's listening and he he knows but the doctors told my brother 6 months the longest but maybe two two or three months he's rapidly he just he has no energy no strength no not hungry and and so forth and a lot of pain but he told me yesterday he said I just want to go and I said it's okay you can go amen we'll take care of Mom everything will be all right amen but we'll have another one up there cross one his day to shake your hand say I made it but spent the night with him on Sunday and he was just just not feeling well and every 15 20 minutes calling out you know and I said you know I think we do that to our Heavenly Father quite often father but he'd not just sleep he' never Slumbers so I was I was just asking the Lord I said you know our days are numbered maybe it's it's his time just remind him and I would say to all of us of your goodness Lord of your grace of your blessings what you've done rather than the focus of what you're going through by saying Lord you've been good to me you've been my strength you've been my help and I have something to thank you for so it's it's a it's a hard time but time goes on we all go through it but there's something inside of us that knows that on the other side it will be worth it all amen so brother Daniel if you take the go too appreciate brother Aaron these our brother G's gone he's an old man and there'll be a day if the Lord carries that he will cross over to the other side and his brother Aaron was just talking this scripture came to mind it's 1 Thessalonians chap 4:1 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with with the Lord and then the next verse says wherefore Comfort one another with these words those are comforting words we have a great promise to look forward to brother Michael's good to see you my friend good friend Michael walters's here um believe a man that loves the Lord with all of his heart I do too my brother and I just I want I want to serve him I want to do what's right and the whole world can go away but Lord let me just be in your will for um this week okay uh for the Youth we'll have an upper room um Upper Room will be open on Friday night and I will post that on the website next weekend brother Jeremy sister Angela or um organizing volleyball at cortero Park and I will also post that on the website I'm sorry and behind it should have already been up there um and then this Sunday a Sunday night I want to have a special service with some of our elders in our church and I want to pass the microphone around like I do sometimes I want to give it to them and say tell us something that stands out in your life that was either a success and you would want to pass that wisdom on to someone else or a failure that you could say don't do this this is where I failed in my life don't do that I think we have tremendous wisdom in our church and it's in our elders not only should our elders be respected and I believe that we do respect respect them but they should also be listened to they should be revered with this great wisdom that they have I was telling somebody today that to get 20 years of experience brother Dan it takes 20 years you don't just come into this world with all the wisdom that you do have when you leave this world so I I want to take advantage of our elders that we have and I want to hear what they have to say so especially I want everybody to come on Sunday night and enjoy that service um one thing I don't know if they told anybody they told me the day before they were leaving but brother Tim Cruz and Brother David Fritz went to the Philippines and um I texted them and uh they haven't got back with me I don't know if they're back home or if they're um they're still there but let's keep those two brothers in time you travel overseas you always have to be careful let's all stand brothers and sisters we have an honor tonight the Bible teaches us our lord Jesus said he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in their midst so it's very important for us to whatever we do in word or deed to do all in the name of the Lord Jesus We Gather here tonight in the name of Jesus Christ and we know that if we are gathered in his name and he is here then he knows the very secrets and thoughts of our hearts he can read right down the Bible says all the way way to the marrow of the bone so before we bow our heads does anyone have a request that you have on your heart that you would like to make known to the Lord with an uplifted hand that hand being lifted don't just do it because that's what we do sometimes there is a request below that hand so have that request on your heart as we bow our heads [Music] our heavenly father almighty [Music] God you are the one Lord that was here when you created the heavens and the Earth Lord you were the one that did M many mighty works all the way up into this time and Lord you are the one that's here with us tonight as you promised and Lord you saw the hands of that were raised I pray that you would look into that heart and see the request that was behind that hand see the request Lord that is upon every heart that's here tonight pray for our friends Brothers brother Tim and Brother David as they travel father I pray that your Mighty hand would be upon them keep them safe Lord and may they be a witness that God is alive Christ is risen from the dead that he is the same yesterday today and forever Lord we place these requests before you in the name of Jesus Christ we also invite your presence to be here with us tonight as our brother ministers father as he opens the word Lord would you teach us out of this word and let us be able to apply this word to our lives that we might be better Christians when we leave this building tonight Grant it Lord and let us tell you that we love you with all of our hearts in Jesus name we pray amen that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the one who save me by his when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the Promised Land what a

the time you leave here tonight you'll be in anticipation amen of that day see if I can remember how to do do this okay Ah that's what I was looking for the Book of Proverbs it may come as no surprise to you but this is May 15th on May 14th 1948 exactly 76 years ago the Modern Nation of Israel came into being as a British mandate expired and the rule of Israel was turned over to the provisional government headed by David benion that's a picture of them announcing their Declaration of Independence only 11 minutes after that Declaration of Independence that evening in Tel Aviv President Harry EST Truman formally recognized the new state of Israel a Palestinian state was also declared by the United Nations effec of that same date but the Palestinian people and the surrounding Arab governments rejected that statehood Civil War had been raging in mandatory Palestine since November 29th of 1947 following the UN vote to partition Palestine into two states on the morning of May 15th 1948 76 years years ago today a pan Arab Army invaded comprised of the armies of Lebanon Syria Iraq trans Jordan and Egypt with contingents from Saudi Arabia and Yemen their stated purpose to drive the Jews into the sea the War lasted 10 months officially ending not with a treaty but with a series of armistice agreements signed from February 24th through July 20 of 1949 the area now called the West Bank was annexed by trans Jordan which then changed its name to Jordan the territory now called the Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt there was no thought of an independent Palestinian state it was a grab for territory there was no push for a two-state solution there was only a cry for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of Arab of mlim rule over the entire area the invading armies encouraged the Arab residents of the territory that was to be Israel to flee they could return and enjoy The Spoils of Victory once the Jewish people were destroyed pushed into the sea thus the youngest Palestinian refugee today would be 76 years old any younger ones up to age 57 were born in territories controlled by Jordan and Egypt until 1967 for nearly 20 years this proposed two-state solution was thwarted by Israel's Arab neighbors it wasn't until Jordan lost the West Bank and Egypt lost the Sinai including the Gaza Strip in The Six Day War of June 1967 that the Arab Nations started calling for a Palestinian State as part of a two-state solution to the refugee problem that they had helped create after the 1967 war Israel inherited the so-called refugee camps the Arab Nations declared war and encouraged people to become refugees have never taken responsibility for their actions and seem to have the World At Large convinced it's all Israel's problem and certainly Israel's fault now more than ever we need to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem the Bible tells us they shall prosper that love thee well enough modern history that's not what you were expecting tonight our Bible study our overview is the book of Proverbs let's begin tonight's study of this book with prayer Lord Jesus we're gathered here together in your name amongst your people Lord our hearts are are burdened our hearts are heavy with what we see going on the suffering Lord the pain Lord the misunderstanding Lord the hatred Lord the the weaponization of all of these things Lord that we see coming to a head Lord is it another sign of the times is it just man's inhumanity to man Lord above all we need you in this hour and we pray Lord for the leadership lord of the nation of Israel Lord that you would give them wisdom Insight courage strength Lord that they not follow their own heart but that they follow you Lord and that you would reveal yourself to them in this hour Lord we commit this study tonight lord it's been such a struggle but Lord we believe you're here we trust you to be here and Lord we have confidence that you're here because you have said so forgive me Lord where I have fallen short and Lord prevent me from saying anything that would cause anyone to stumble but Lord we just want to be drawn closer to yourself and to one another we thank you for this honor and this privilege to be here tonight in Jesus precious name amen well in a complete departure from my Norm let's read our opening scriptures from Proverbs Chapter 1 the opening verses are an introduction and describe the reason for the collection of these sayings or Proverbs Proverbs 1:1 the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David king of Israel their purpose is to know to gain wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding insight to receive the instruction of wisdom Justice judgment Equity that means Integrity to give subtlety Prudence caution to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion a w a wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels that means acquire the ability to provide wise counsel to others to understand a proverb in the interpretation the the words of the wise and their dark sayings seeming riddles and the next verse concludes the introduction and reason for the book the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction please be seated we see that the focus of this book is wisdom as well as knowledge you might think of wisdom as knowing when and how to apply knowledge to a given situation guiding principles on how to live one's life practical downto Earth advice such as soft answer turns away anger not esoteric Concepts like how many angels can fit on the head of a pin you may recall from last week that the books of job Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes and song of songs are grouped together in our Bibles and classified as wisdom or poetry before we dig into this Book of Proverbs let's step back a bit and take a look look at the Bible itself and in particular the collection of books that we refer to as the Old Testament while we were taking our study of the Bible in the form of an overview of each book in Order there's also the topic of the Bible itself the collection of books in this small Library which we call the Bible contains how and why are the various books arranged as they are in this collection in our Christian Bible the order of the books is quite different than in the Hebrew Bible known as the tanak if we think of each book as a tree the Bible represents the forest let's take a look at the forest for a few minutes we saw that the books from Genesis through job were narratives stories of people and events some were short like Ruth or Esther with a clear central figure whose life conveyed an important lesson others are much longer like genesis with a number of vignettes of people whose stories form a basis for our faith others like Exodus telling a much longer story of events not around not just a central figure like Moses but also of the people he was leading all the while God revealing himself through their lives their experiences their prophecies we caught glimpses of the character of God the character which God sought and in those glimpses we saw part of the character of God himself Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes song of songs are very different than the previous books they're not narratives of a history or focus on a central named figure brother Daniel did a masterful job last week giving us an overview of Psalm its breakdown and its theme worship I mentioned that in our Christian Bible the books of job Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes song of Psalms are grouped and classified as wisdom or typically called poetry well there are there are 39 books in our Old Testament the first five sometimes called the law are the Books of Moses also called The pentat Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy Genesis tells from creation through the life of Joseph and sets the stage for everything that follows both Old and New Testaments the other four are centered around Moses and the events during his life with remarkable and unique displays of the supernatural power of God working on behalf of his people the next 12 are classified as history telling the story of the descendants of Israel from the death of Moses around 1406 BC through the return from captivity around 450 BC a period of nearly 1,000 years Joshua Judges Ruth 1 and 2 Samuel 1 and 2 Kings first and second chronicles Ezra Nehemiah Esther the next group are the books of poetry job Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes Song of Songs or sometimes called Song of Solomon there's five books there that's followed by the prophets it's broken down into two sections the Major Prophets which are considered Major Prophets because they left a significant number of written prophecies Isaiah Jeremiah the Lamentations of Jeremiah Ezekiel and Daniel these are approximately in chronological order and lastly the Minor Prophets the last 12 books these are short focused again arranged in approximate chronological order Hosea Joel Amos Obadiah Jonah Mah nakum habak zani hegi Zakaria Malachi we're generally familiar with this arrangement in Sunday school that children are usually taught the names and Orders of these books our current series of Wednesday night bible studies is for the purpose of seeing what each book is about one of our goals is that you then take the time to read through each book and get not only a better grasp of its contents but allow the Lord to have the opportunity to speak to you through the text he texted us this is a love letter yes amen this is a love letter read it amen and and if you feel down go back to a part that really cheered you up and read it again it's a love letter it's from a living God to living people and we're living people because he gave us his life it's not about teaching it's about relationship in the Hebrew Bible the structure is quite different it has all the content of the Old Testament but it's comprised of only 24 books organized in three sections the Hebrew Bible is commonly called the Tanakh it's taken from the first letters of the Hebrew words for those three sections the T for Torah the five books of Moses the the laws we sometimes think of it the neim which means prophets which is the middle section and the final section the Kim which means writings Torah neim Kim the law the prophets and the writings those are the names of the three sections but let's let's take a closer look at this the first section is known as the Torah we often State this as the law but it's more generally means instruction or teaching these are the same five books attributed to Moses and in the same order as in our Old Testament though with radically different names for example what we call the Book of Numbers in Hebrew is called the midal which literally means in the desert put another way while we put titles on the books these Scrolls didn't have titles so they're referred to by something from the very first uh sentence are the very first words what we call Genesis they call bashit which means means in the beginning uh Exodus is called shamot because it starts out with a list of names shamot is Hebrew plural for names talked about Deuteronomy is called theim which means things things okay let's move on let let's go to the let's go to nevim the prophets it's divided typically into two parts what they call the earlier prophets uh Joshua Judges Samuel Kings recall that a prophet is one to whom the word of the Lord comes in these books we read of various prophets such as Nathan Elijah Deborah Samuel these are prophets who left us no written record of their prophecies we usually think of these books as history but they're considered and classified as prophets in the Hebrew Bible notice that Samuel and kings are one book not split into two parts they had pretty good siiz Scrolls I think then we get to the later or the latter prophets the second part these are also thought of as the writing prophets there are three major prophets those who wrote a lot Isaiah Jeremiah and Ezekiel and then the 12 that we think of of his Minor Prophets from Obadiah Amos Hosea through Malachi they didn't write so much and all 12 of them were contained in a single scroll and simply referred to often as the 12 which helps condense the number of books right notice that this while they're in the same order that we have they're not in the same place we end our Old Testament with the 12 Minor Prophets and the Hebrew Bible they're in the middle they're grouped with the prophets they don't end in Malachi the third and final part of the Tanakh contains the Kim the writings this collection of Scrolls is informally divided into three parts the first part is sometimes referred to as poetry but more often called wisdom now there's a there's a little bit of a play on words on letters here the things that uh rabbis really enjoy playing with and I thought maybe we'd play with it a little bit tonight ourself we have job here who really is shattering stereotypes if you're a good guy and do the right stuff nothing bad's ever going to happen to you wrong Psalms is about worship Proverbs is about wisdom well let's take just a little look at something here what my grandkids would call fun facts the first letters of the book of what we call job and Hebrew is EOB and it's represented by that funny thing that looks like an X that's a Hebrew letter Ola that's the very first letter in the alphabet if if you think in terms of Greek I'm sure you all think in terms of Greek right then that would be Alpha right okay the very first letter proverbs in Hebrew is mish and the letter meem is in the middle of the alphabet it's 22 letters so it can't be the you know the 10 and a half letter or something or the 11 and a half it's about the 13th but it's in the middle and Psalms to helim the letter Tav is the very last letter of the Hebrew alphabet think Alpha and Omega does that remind you of someone well these letters together spell the Hebrew word AMT so what brother L okay well let's take a look at that AMT is a Hebrew word for truth or wisdom and this word covers the whole Hebrew alphabet beginning to end alpha and omega as I said who did Jesus say he was Alpha and Omega he also said that he was the truth the Amit amen well one of my co-workers when I lived in Israel a half a century ago and worked at L which is the airline and Excuse me while I unpack my bag and baggage that I probably should have done earlier but but I didn't because I'm an old guy and sometimes I forget I I had a friend there and he told me something that that the rabbis said the word for truth or a Met if if you cut out these letters and and stand them up you'd find if I can do this the right way that they're stable they stand up they're strong they have a foundation okay for those of you that insist on sitting in the back if you can't see these very clearly remember binoculars opera glasses or sit closer okay but my my friend told me something else about this he said you know L he said the Hebrew word for lie or falsehood is shaker like many or most Hebrew words it's root consists of three letters in this case Shin K from these letters are all grouped at the very end of the Hebrew alphabet letters 19 through 21 of 22 unlike truth these letters have a narrow base if you cut them out and try to stand them up I I I can't do it they they don't stand up they're unstable they have to be supported you got to keep propping them up a li is unstable but then there's the truth Jesus is the truth the way and the life okay that little bit of stuff fun facts that was all free let's get back to the Tanakh the the next group of scrolls are called the megalot and that simply means Scrolls it's Hebrew word and these are the song of songs or Song of Solomon Ruth you notice is not placed historically but is placed here Lamentations Ecclesiastes and Esther these five scrolls are read each year During certain festivals or or observances Song of Songs is read on the Sabbath that occurs during the week of Passover it's interpreted as an allegorical expression of God's love for his people demonstrated by the Passover and by The Exodus this year it happened to be April 27 Ruth which we just covered recently is read on Shavuot anybody remember what Shavuot is those of you that speak Hebrew don't raise your hand oh then nobody's raising their hand okay well shev wot is the Feast of Weeks what do we call it Pentecost yes Harvest Time and that's a setting for the book for us the Redemption of a gentile bride maybe we should read it on Pentecost too it occurs on June 13 this year in Judaism but on the Christian calendar Pentecost is May 19th this Sunday lamentation very sad book wailing over the destruction of Jerusalem this is read on a on a day that's observed it's not a holiday it's not a day of Celebration it is a day of observance tesab AV means the ninth day of the month of a on the Hebrew calendar this is the date that in Jewish tradition and I believe historically as well that the first temple was destroyed in 586 BC it's also the the date the ninth day of the Hebrew month of a that the second temple was destroyed in 70 AD there's other disasters that have happened to the Jewish people over the years that seem to occur on this very same date in the Jewish calendar Lamentations is Jeremiah's lament over the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple under the Babylonians it falls on August 13 this year Ecclesiastes has read on the Sabbath of the week of sucot Tabernacles a reminder of the transitory and permanent nature of life just as the Tabernacles or booths or temporary structures and reminders of the years of wandering following The Exodus this year October 19th Esther is read on purm this book established the holidays we read two weeks ago it was on March 24th of this year the final three books are Daniel Ezra Ezra Nehemiah which is one book or scroll and Chronicles also one book these books are are called post exilic they mean after the Exile after the destruction uh after the people were scattered there their views are histories Daniel while certainly containing prophecies was written entirely in Exile in the section of the prophets the nebim were all written in the land of of promise even if they were post Exile Jewish tradition because I know most of you going to say wait a minute Ezekiel kind of starts out and says that he was by this Brook in Babylon Jewish tradition asserts that Ezekiel started his life as a prophet in Judah before the Exile while Daniel did not so we end while we end the Old Testament with Malachi a promise of a returning Elijah lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse the Hebrew chanak ends with 2 Chronicles for us second Chronicles 36:23 thus saith Cyrus King of Persia think he might be a type of Christ in this verse all the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God Of Heaven given me all power is given unto me in heaven and earth is what Jesus said and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you of all his people the Lord is God be with him let him go up I just mentioned Pentecost is this Sunday what happened at Pentecost um hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem isn't that what we're supposed to be the temple of God the Holy Spirit came down the infilling it's just such a beautiful type and parallel so it ends on a note of Hope and restoration for the Jewish people and for us symbolic of the life of a Christian is a living Temple or house of the Lord well I'll end this rather lengthy sidebar about the structure of the Old Testament and to knock with two verses from the New Testament Gospel of Luke Jesus was familiar with the three-part structure and Order of the Tanakh in fact he referred to it when speaking with his followers gathered just before his Ascension let's read Luke 24:44 Jesus said unto them recall he's he's he's with uh his disciples this group of people and and he's asked for fish and a honeycomb and and he's eating and he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses tah and in the prophets Nim and in the Psalms Kim writings concerning me he wasn't just referring to a couple of things well Psalms he was referring to that part of the structure that's the lead book in that part of the structure then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures when you read Luke 24 in the past I suspect you thought Jesus was referring to just a few books of the Old Testament but he was speaking of the entire Corpus of the Hebrew Bible the Old Testament and we know that to be true we see see Jesus Christ in every verse and kind of another little fun fact here Jesus was ever the teacher he was eating with him at this time Luke tells us he was eating fish and honeycomb now do you think he was kind of that's greasy oops honey from that honey you think he was standing up or do you think that he was probably seated at a table probably with the dish that to catch all the drippings while he was speaking whenever Jesus sits he's usually teaching not always and not only but The Sermon on the Mount sitting in a boat on the shore of the lake in the synagogue at Nazareth when he spoke about this day the scriptures fulfilled in your ears it says he read the scripture then he sat down all eyes were on him and he taught okay enough about structure let's get back to our topic ate you may be asking yourself self self Book of Proverbs what is a proverb glad you asked the American Heritage dictionary defines a proverb as a short piy saying and frequent and widespread use it expresses the basic truth or practical precept an old and common saying a phrase which is often repeated especially a sentence which briefly and forcibly expresses some practical truth or the result of experience and observation a maxim a saw an adage a striking or paradoxical assertion an obscure saying an enigma a parable as we'll see the Book of Proverbs is largely a collection of such short pithy sayings the Proverbs are presented using Hebrew parallelism to communicate its principles of wisdom it's very similar to the Psalms part of the reason it's called poetry as brother Daniel explained last week turns out there three basic kinds of parallelism employed repetition contrast completion we'll use examples of these in repetition or synonymous parallelism the second line of the proverb repeats the principle of the first line with different words a couple of examples Proverbs 1:2 to know wisdom and instruction to perceive to know the words of understanding wisdom and instruction it's saying the same thing using different words it's synonyms wisdom of course is not the same as knowledge wisdom is applying knowledge by means of understanding not just the facts but also the context in which you apply them Proverbs 16:18 Pride goeth Before Destruction a hoty spirit before a fall again it's the same thing pride and a hotty Spirit are synonyms destruction and fall are synonyms making the same statement different words and this is advice and a warning Jesus talked about this humility that's that's what's going on here in contrasting or antithetical parallelism the second line States a principle by using a contrasting statement for example Proverbs 101 the Proverbs of Sol a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother wise and foolish are contrasted glad heaviness are contrasted father mother are contrasted lastly in completing or synthetic parallelism the second line completes the broad thought of the First with this specific Truth For example Proverbs 16:4 the Lord hath made all things for himself then we come to down to focus and example yay even the wicked for the day of evil like Psalms The Book of Proverbs is broken into four sections the introduction is Proverbs 1: 1 through 7 it was our opening set of verses the emphasis is the beginning of wisdom a key verse of that is 17 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge fools despise with wisdom and instruction the next section is us to refer to is the invitation inviting the people of wisdom it's Proverbs 1 18-918 a key verse here is usually stated as Proverbs 35 through6 for me personally this is the heart of the entire book trust in the Lord with all thine heart how much how much of your heart should be dedicated to trusting the Lord and lean not unto thine own understanding contrast trust him or trust yourself in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct make straight thy paths you do the first three he'll do the fourth sounds easy but it's often not so easy the third section is often called the principles of wisdom Proverbs chapters 10- 29 a key verse here is perhaps uh 1412 there's a way that seems right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death the last section chapters 30 and 31 emphasizing the practice of wisdom Chapter 30 is attributed to a person named agur and 31 to a King named Lemuel a key verse here is often considered to be Chapter 30 verse 4 who hath ascended up into heaven or descended who hath bound the waters in a garment who hath established all the ends of the Earth wow sounds like Paul sounds like job what is his name what is his son's name if you can tell Christian theologians will often point to this as for telling the Messiah as the son Jewish theologians will tell you that it refers to Israel Exodus 4:22 says Thou shalt say unto Pharaoh thus saith the Lord Israel is my son even my firstborn Proverbs isn't about prophecy it's about how to live it's practical we read verses from chapter 31 about the attributes of a virtuous woman in our opening for the Book of Esther the first 29 chapters of Proverbs are attributed to Solomon they represent but a small fraction of the Proverbs he is reported to have collected spoken or written and first First Kings we read this about his Proverbs First Kings 4:29 God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largess of heart even as the sand that is on the seashore and Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East Country all the wisdom of Egypt he was wiser than all men than Ethan the ezrahite and hman and and chalal and Darda the sons of Mah who are those guys their names we don't recognize but they were apparently known for their wisdom in those days some 3,000 years ago and Solomon's Fame was in all nations roundabout and he spake 3,000 Proverbs 3,000 these 29 chapters only have 851 verses and not every one of them is a Proverbs so we have less than a quarter maybe only just a few percent of the proverbs that Solomon spoke and not only that somehow I deleted the next part of the line his songs were a th5 and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon unto the hsip that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and a fowl and creeping things and Fishes the lessons of nature of the world around us that the Lord created not just to express his variety but to teach us lessons about life not only the Majestic but the tiny a couple of years ago we spoke here one evening about the ant and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon from all Kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom Solomon we just learned spoke many Proverbs he didn't necessarily originate all of them he didn't necessarily write them down or even had them placed in a written collection for example more than 200 years after Solomon's death we read in Proverbs 251 these are also Proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out transcribed compiled collected that was more than 200 years after Solomon passed away and that comprises the last five chapters that are attributed to Solomon Solomon is also credited with composing two of the Psalms two the books of the Bible Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs these will be the subjects of upcoming overviews of the books comprising the Bible we could spend the rest of the evening looking at some of the various Proverbs and you probably expect me to do just that Proverbs that tell how to deescalate tense situations or how to live a fruitful life what things to value in life how to conduct business how to control temper what happens if there's no vision and so on sorry to disappoint but I really want you to read this book at home during devotions meditation family discussion and conversation set time aside unlike much of the Bible these are mostly short mini lessons they contain succinct practical advice on life and how to live use the ESV or the NIV or some other translation if the King James English trips you up a little bit make time I'm busy brother Lyall I've got this and I've got that going on yeah i' I I know about busy Sunday night probably something about busy might come up David wrote in the Psalms 11 19 wherewith all shall a young man cleanse his way how how can a young person stay pure by taking heed thereto by guarding his way according to what Thy Word with my whole heart have I sought thee let me not Wander from thy Commandments and now a key how do I keep from wandering how do I guard my way Thy word have I hid in my heart why that I might not sin against thee wisdom application of knowledge of his word blessed art thou oh Lord teach me thy statute it's with my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimony as much as in all riches I will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways set aside time read listen meditate pray I will Delight myself in thy statutes I will not forget Thy word we must not just learn and recite and quote we need to apply to live I presented an overview of the Old Testament the Tanakh The Book of Proverbs please read it let the Lord speak to you you don't need to hear my thoughts on it what lessons can we take home from Proverbs brother L you only read a few Proverbs read them at home amen read them at home did I say that read them at home we still have a little time this evening I want to emphasize the role of wisdom of applying our knowledge of the Lord in and to our lives brother Daniel I might be slipping into preacher of meddling here stop me at any time there's a couple of flashing red lights that I that I see first a personal note in 1968 I graduated from Flowing Wells High School here in Tucson there was a competition that year to see who would speak at commencement it wasn't going to be the person with the highest grade point average the valid Victorian I I prayed about this I submitted a speech for evaluation I came in second in a field of about 20 submissions but somehow the people that printed the program oops and I was the lead speaker that evening I don't have a copy of the speech but I remember a couple of lines from it that I think apply to this evening's Bible study I said knowledge without wisdom is like religion without god wow today we are asked to to live with the curse of both tonight nearly 60 years later I think it's still true we need wisdom we must apply the knowledge that we have of God and his word in our lives not just quote it or debate it or explain it as brother Daniel said recently we need to have rivers of living water coming from us to help others if it's just for our own edification it's of little value it's not the example that we have from Joseph or Moses or Jesus or the apostles or brother bradam another flashing red light if you will is a sometimes preoccupation with what we often call The Rapture brother Daniel we didn't collude on this this evening but he read that scripture Paul wrote to the Corinthians to fight a doctrine that was being spread about the soon return of Jesus people were being taught that they had to be alive when Jesus came or they'd go to hell if you died you were doomed Paul says we're not as those without hope that's why they were as those without hope because they were told oh your dad died gosh I'm sorry he's going to hell he's not alive when Jesus comes so he was fighting that Doctrine so we rod and assured them that if they were alive at that moment as he himself expected to be he said then we which are alive they'd be transformed and so were we if we're alive at that time but if they died not to worry because the dead in Christ will rise first if you're his you won't miss it you can't miss it if you're his period so don't fret about it don't worry about it don't try to figure out when it will be or how it will take place it's yours if you're his a third final flashing real light that I think we can so often get sidetracked about when he is coming that we may forget why we are here faith in Christ isn't a fire insurance policy or a quick escape from our problems we should our life isn't only about studying the Bible or listening to recordings of sermons from years past we should do these things but never forget we're to live each day for him consider what Jesus had to say Luke 6 why call ye me Lord Lord and you don't do the things that I say Amen whosoever Number One Cometh to me and two heareth my sayings and three do doth them I will show you whom he is like he's like a man which built a house he dig deep he laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the scam beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the Earth against which when the stream did beat vehemently immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great in Sunday school we used to sing the wise man built his house upon a rock the rains came down and the floods came up right James summed this up in a proverb likee statement he said but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only why because if you don't do he says you are deceiving your own selves we used to sing a song about ready to leave I think maybe we need to change that to ready to live these Proverbs are words to apply to help us live in a way that's God pleasing we just read that Jesus said you can't say he is Lord if you don't do not just know or hear or claim to have a revelation but do what he says my daughter-in-law Siobhan shared a short video clip with me some years ago from a minister named Francis Chan some of you may have seen this I wasn't confident that I could embed it in my slide so I'll retell it now that I've acknowledged the source so I'm not plagiarizing this came from Francis Chan okay imagine imagine I'm 30 years younger I have hair a smaller belly yeah a real stretch of your imagination and I have children and they're teens I peek into my son's bedroom it's a real mess I tell him go clean your room he comes to me a few hours later big smile on his face and he says and great expectation dad I memorized what you said to me you said Lyle one one go clean your room I'm not going to respond wow son good job that's what I wanted it's not going to cut it he can't come to me and say Dad I learned to say go clean your room in Greek and Hebrew and in Spanish or dad my friends and I are going to gather every week and study and imagine what it would look like if I were to clean my room or listen I've set this to music I've added some verses in the chorus and the title is go clean your room would I accept these would you of course not there's no mystery here it's plain and simple black and white just go clean the room so why should we expect God to accept it from us to talk and sing and recite but not do the musicians would please come we've just read where Jesus said how can you call me Lord and not do what I say in Matthew's gospel we read not every one that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but the one who will enter in is he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven so we need to learn and to apply to turn knowledge into wisdom put it into practice and we know it it doesn't stop there that that's part one Jesus continues many will say to me in that day Lord Lord we prophesied in your name in your name we've cast out devils in your name we've done many wonderful Works Lord look we are doers I will profess to them here comes part two I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity in addition to doing what he says we must have that relation a ship with him such that he knows us otherwise this book we call the Bible is just philosophy and its practices simply religion know listen apply from the heart brother Aaron Brother Daniel bless brother I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more love I could never never how love the Lord I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more love I could never never love the Lord amen as always I appreciate brother ly and his wisdom and how he puts these together I appreciate the variety too brother ly and I approach things in different ways but we both love to study the word and I think it gives us a good variety as far as a congregation brother ly said this and this is a proverb I believe was that your commencement ceremony that you erroneously got to give the first one but this is wisdom I believe is the Lord's will knowledge without wisdom is like religion without God very profound statement as with all of these Proverbs brother Lyall also said tonight he said that instead of reading these Proverbs he said get together with your family and you read them and you discuss them the way that the Proverbs are written you don't have to read a whole chapter to know what's going on many times you just have to read one or two verses and that's the way that they're written that we can go in and pull the wisdom out of these Proverbs the Psalms is the same way that that it's written that you can just go into Psalms you can jump anywhere into the book and then you can pull that wisdom and worship out of the Psalms and it's the same with the Proverbs you can go and you can pull it right out of this book and then you can have an hourlong discussion with your family I just opened it up I had it underlined in in the Proverbs it says this it says a fool utth all his mind but a wise man keepeth keepeth it until afterwards I was thinking that's a a good discussion to have as a family it's good for Dad or Mom to get the kids around and say now look at this read this always be careful what you say and always be careful how you act still say what you're going to say but you can wait until the end you we could have a great discussion about about these this wisdom that's in the Proverbs and as brother Lyall said I encourage you to do it sit down with your husband with your wife with your kids with your friend with whoever it is if you if you know somebody that's that's in another part of the country and you want to fellowship with them open this book and anywhere it says right here where there is no vision the people perish but he he that keepeth the law is happy and I'm just looking everywhere in here iron sharpens iron so a man so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend that's this book so take brother ly's advice study this talk about it pick one out talk about it with your family enjoy it it's what it's for and then apply it to your life will you do it I think it would be good for us to do it I think it'd be good for families to do it let's all stand there it would be like driving down the the road and there's a speed limit and you obey it and everybody's zipping around you and angry at you until the police pulls them over but you youve kept your place where you should be amen [Music] amen till we see chist it will be worth it all when we see Jesus life trials will seem so small when we see chist one glimpse of his dear face all Sorrows will R so bravely run the race till

CHR brother Michael can I pull on you to close my friend God bless [Music] you as brother ly said this book it was printed to be read and enjoyed and placed first in your life so please go into this book I like the way that brother Lyall did that he said no I'm not going to read all through this he says you do it I think you said it three times you do it you do it you do it and I got I got the hint I I believe it was really good but I thank you let's pray dear heavenly father we come to you tonight Lord and we just want to thank you for this time we've had tonight and Lord just pray that you'll help us to put the time aside and not be so busy and Lord just just give you the time that you deserve and Lord dig into the word and Lord look at these Proverbs and apply them in our life Lord
