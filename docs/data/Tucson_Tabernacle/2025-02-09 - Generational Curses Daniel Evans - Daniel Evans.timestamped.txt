[33:17] again do you believe that he is able do
[33:21] you believe he is amen
[33:31] he
[33:32] is I've seen
[33:34] it let's turn to Romans chapter
[33:38] 5 start with verse
[33:42] 12 a very very deep
[33:52] scripture Romans chapter
[33:54] 5 verse 12
[33:57] starts like
[34:00] this
[34:03] wherefore as by one man CED sin entered
[34:07] into the world and death by sin and so
[34:12] death passed upon all men for that all
[34:16] have
[34:16] sinned For unto the law for until the
[34:19] law sin was in the world but sin is not
[34:23] imputed when there is no law
[34:25] nevertheless death reigned from Adam to
[34:29] Moses even over them that had not sinned
[34:32] after the similitude of Adam's
[34:34] transgression who is the figure of him
[34:36] that was to
[34:38] come but not as the offense so also is
[34:43] the free
[34:44] gift for if through the offense one of
[34:48] many be
[34:49] dead much more the grace of God and the
[34:53] gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus
[34:57] Christ hath abounded unto many and not
[35:01] as it was by one that
[35:04] sinned so is the gift for the Judgment
[35:08] was by one to
[35:10] condemnation but the free gift is of
[35:13] many off offenses unto
[35:17] justification for If by one man's
[35:19] offense death reigned by
[35:22] one much more they which receive
[35:25] abundance of Grace and of the gift of
[35:28] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[35:32] Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense
[35:35] of one judgment Came Upon all men to
[35:39] condemnation even so by the
[35:41] righteousness of one the free gift came
[35:44] upon all men unto justification of
[35:49] life keep this next verse in your heart
[35:52] and in your mind as we continue on for
[35:54] as by one man's disobedience
[35:58] many were made
[36:00] Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall
[36:04] many be made
[36:07] righteous Heavenly
[36:09] Father those words father give us the
[36:12] understanding of those

[39:16] my sermons I just kind of I I Minister
[39:20] and then I'll name it after the service
[39:23] and um but this morning I I really felt
[39:27] LED on a subject earlier this week and
[39:31] it's on the subject of generational
[39:33] curses um it's something that is kind of
[39:38] going around lately and and as I was
[39:42] what gave me what kind of laid it on my
[39:45] heart is brother Paul
[39:48] Murray um with with our men's group he
[39:51] sent out a question believe it was
[39:54] earlier this week and he asked a
[39:57] question
[39:58] he said I I have a question I believe
[40:00] that everyone can answer and I'm gen
[40:03] genuinely curious about your feedback
[40:05] where's brother Paul there you are I'm
[40:07] genuinely curious about your feedback
[40:10] I'm asking each and every one of you to
[40:12] share what the top three most valuable
[40:14] lessons were that you learned from your
[40:19] dad and
[40:21] uh I read that and I said huh that's a
[40:26] really good question
[40:28] and people started
[40:31] responding and uh I was I was just
[40:35] pondering on that all week I was
[40:36] traveling this past week and and most of
[40:39] the comments about dads most of them
[40:41] were
[40:42] positive and um but a couple of the
[40:45] others alluded to bad examples that
[40:50] fathers have set before them and and it
[40:54] brought me back to a memory of a Time
[40:58] about maybe 10 years ago and I was
[40:59] telling Stephanie about it
[41:03] yesterday
[41:05] um and we were talking about how uh
[41:10] how the the
[41:12] word is so important in our lives and I
[41:17] was telling Stephanie the story that I'm
[41:20] I'm about to tell you all and she told
[41:23] me she said she said Dan she said the
[41:26] ABS absolute in in in our lives we
[41:30] should have this Bible as our
[41:33] absolute and you know I look at my Bible
[41:35] and it's even has the absolute written
[41:38] on the front of it and I said honey I
[41:40] said that's true to a certain
[41:45] extent and I said I have seen
[41:49] people influence on me that I have been
[41:53] close to I've seen people justify
[41:55] lying because it's in with this Bible
[41:58] I've seen people justify stealing from
[42:01] this Bible I've seen people justify
[42:04] polygamy in the Bible I've seen people
[42:07] justify
[42:08] adultery in the Bible wow so you have to
[42:12] when you read this Bible you can't just
[42:15] read it
[42:16] with ears with eyes that you want to
[42:21] further your own um agenda but you have
[42:24] to read this Bible in the Holy
[42:27] Spirit it was
[42:30] written as the Bible says by men of old
[42:32] how how they were led by the spirit to
[42:35] write these things and it says that all
[42:37] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[42:39] and good for Doctrine It Was Written in
[42:41] that way so when we read the Bible we
[42:45] must read it in the same spirit that it
[42:48] was given or else we can we will just
[42:51] use it to further our own
[42:53] sins so no the the Bible yes it is the
[42:58] absolute but just going and finding a
[43:01] scripture that agrees with the way that
[43:03] you think that is not the absolute you
[43:06] have to read this in the Holy Spirit and
[43:11] surrender yourself and then that
[43:14] absolute comes out I was praying about a
[43:17] scripture that I I really didn't quite
[43:21] get and I asked a pastor friend of mine
[43:24] even yesterday and I said hey have you
[43:26] ever considered this scripture with this
[43:29] Doctrine in
[43:31] mind talking with the brother last night
[43:33] for a long time he says you know I never
[43:35] I never thought about that and we went
[43:38] back and forth and he actually gave me
[43:40] another scripture that I had never
[43:42] thought about and we didn't get it
[43:44] resolved but I could see that both of us
[43:46] we genuinely wanted the
[43:48] answer and that's how we should read the
[43:51] Bible and it even Jeremy brother
[43:55] Jeremy's testimony
[43:57] um I don't know I don't know where
[43:58] brother Jeremy is but even brother
[44:00] Jeremy's testimony this morning that
[44:01] Daniel read he says with with regarding
[44:05] these scriptures he says I Ponder things
[44:07] on my heart may not understand them but
[44:10] I Ponder them on my heart and then he
[44:13] said and L let patience have her perfect
[44:16] work so when you're reading a scripture
[44:19] and you don't understand that scripture
[44:23] stop because it's important it's the
[44:25] word of God and if you don't understand
[44:28] what you're reading pause meditate on
[44:32] the word study other translations study
[44:35] other other stories in the Bible that
[44:37] you know about but don't just miss that
[44:39] blessing that God has for you or miss
[44:41] that correction that God has for you it
[44:44] is all important this book contains the
[44:47] very words of God
[44:50] himself so why would we want to read
[44:52] over something we don't understand
[44:54] that's what I'm here for that's what
[44:55] your family your dad your mom mom are
[44:57] here for those the deacons are here for
[45:00] that that's what we are here for is to
[45:02] try to help you understand not give our
[45:04] own interpretation of it but it help you
[45:07] to understand these things and most of
[45:10] all the Holy
[45:12] Spirit to help you understand with that
[45:15] in
[45:17] mind some time ago and thinking about
[45:20] Brother Paul's um note on WhatsApp and
[45:23] if you're not signed up for the men's
[45:24] WhatsApp group I I'd encourage you to to
[45:27] get signed up and talk to brother Paul
[45:31] um it brought back a memory that I have
[45:34] from I don't know maybe 10 years
[45:36] ago maybe maybe 10 to 15 years ago I'd
[45:40] say and I
[45:41] was praying about a scripture I didn't
[45:44] understand I was on my knees in the
[45:47] closet and I was really
[45:49] troubled by it and I'll read it to you
[45:53] it's the second commandment of the ten
[45:56] commands
[45:57] commments um Exodus 20 verse 4 Listen to
[46:04] this Thou shalt not make unto thee any
[46:08] Graven image or any likeness of anything
[46:11] that is in heaven above or is in the
[46:13] earth beneath or that is in the water
[46:15] under the Earth Thou shalt not bow down
[46:17] thyself to them nor serve them for I the
[46:20] Lord thy God am a jealous God we
[46:24] understand that part that part's not
[46:27] hard listen to this visiting the
[46:31] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[46:34] children unto the third and fourth
[46:36] generation of them that hate
[46:40] me all
[46:43] translations except for the more
[46:45] paraphrased versions all translations
[46:47] use that word
[46:49] hate the New Living Translation says the
[46:53] fourth generation of them that reject
[46:58] me so we all have and what it is is
[47:01] people all have their own way of
[47:03] thinking I don't think anyone knowingly
[47:05] hates God or rejects God I think that we
[47:09] do it on our own and we want our own way
[47:12] of thinking and when it's obviously
[47:14] against God's word then we can hate what
[47:17] the truth is and then we can just go to
[47:19] the Bible to try to justify what we're
[47:21] doing and he says visiting the iniquity
[47:24] of the fathers upon the children NIV
[47:27] says punishing the children for the sins
[47:29] of the
[47:30] parents NLT says I lay the sins of the
[47:34] parents upon their
[47:36] children I was praying about that in my
[47:40] closet I was sincere I said
[47:42] Lord I don't feel that that's
[47:45] fair I said look at look at the sins of
[47:49] of my
[47:50] family why do I am I punished for
[47:53] something that my dad
[47:55] did I was was on my knees and I was
[47:57] asking the Lord and then I quoted to the
[47:59] Lord and I knew this scripture because
[48:02] when I was going to prayer I was trying
[48:03] to compare this Exodus chapter 20 with e
[48:06] Ezekiel chapter
[48:08] 18 Ezekiel chapter 18 says this verse
[48:12] 20 the soul that sinth it shall die that
[48:18] soul that sins it shall die the son
[48:22] shall not bear the iniquity of the
[48:24] father neither shall the father bear the
[48:27] iniquity of the son the righteous the
[48:30] righteousness of the righteous shall be
[48:32] upon
[48:33] him and the wickedness of the wicked
[48:35] shall be upon him so Ezekiel here is
[48:38] saying if you sin you will answer but
[48:41] your children are not responsible for
[48:43] your sin so as I on my knees and asking
[48:47] the Lord like Lord I don't understand
[48:50] over here in Exodus chapter 20 the
[48:52] second commandment it says that I will
[48:55] visit the iniquities of the fathers upon
[48:57] the children and then over here in
[48:59] Ezekiel it says that you're not going to
[49:00] Lord I don't
[49:03] understand and I went I was in prayer
[49:05] and I was genuinely seeking an answer
[49:07] this was important to
[49:09] me and then in the quietness of that
[49:13] room in deep prayer in the sincerity of
[49:17] my heart I wasn't trying to to get God
[49:20] to line up with my doctrines I was like
[49:22] Lord I don't I don't understand and in
[49:25] the quietness of the room
[49:27] there came the answer and it's a very
[49:31] simple sentence they are taught that
[49:35] way
[49:37] oh that makes
[49:40] sense so the if I sin Daniel's not
[49:45] responsible Daniel's not going to be
[49:46] punished for my sin but Daniel is going
[49:49] to see my sin as a dad and then if he
[49:52] repeats my sin then he is guilty because
[49:56] he did did it so I am guilty because I
[49:59] teach my child that Daniel doesn't have
[50:01] to answer for my sin but if he repeats
[50:03] what I do then he is guilty because
[50:06] according to Ezekiel he is the one that
[50:08] committed the the
[50:11] sin the the scripture is
[50:15] perfect and
[50:17] then seeing Brother Paul's
[50:21] email and on my mind were these
[50:25] generational curses that come down
[50:28] through the generations we teach our
[50:30] children our children teach their
[50:32] children all the way down and to see
[50:34] that that Generations
[50:37] suffer because the sins just keep going
[50:40] down and it's the same sin
[50:44] wow and it came to mind as I was praying
[50:47] and and thinking and meditating on on
[50:50] that question about about the
[50:52] dads mistakes that I'm
[50:55] seeing people making our church right
[50:58] now and they're making those mistakes
[51:02] because it is what their family has done
[51:03] for
[51:05] Generations their financial mistakes
[51:08] marital
[51:10] mistakes religious
[51:13] mistakes all because these mistakes run
[51:17] in their family in one form or
[51:21] another friend of
[51:23] mine who has troubles he's an old friend
[51:26] I'm talked to him a while but he's had
[51:27] troubles his whole life he's he's older
[51:29] than I am he's has troubles being a dad
[51:32] he's had trouble um being a husband
[51:35] there there's just he's at trouble in
[51:37] business there's been all these problems
[51:38] and then I just found out that his
[51:40] brother in the
[51:42] flesh was sawing was was running a a
[51:46] power
[51:47] saw and cut off his
[51:51] finger and his dad tells him after he
[51:55] cuts off his finger a young man his dad
[51:58] tells him my son despised not the
[52:00] chastening of the
[52:03] Lord thought
[52:06] wow with that harsh attitude and he had
[52:11] problems the dad had problems you see
[52:13] how those problems come right down
[52:15] through the family and then they repeat
[52:18] the the mistakes that their dad
[52:21] made when I when I when I talk about
[52:23] these things I I know
[52:25] that that uh it means it means a lot to
[52:29] me I don't want to see these I want to
[52:31] see these things
[52:33] stop these generational curses they need
[52:36] to stop and they can stop and I will get
[52:38] to how they
[52:39] stop as I as I go forward but I've also
[52:43] I've seen families I know of another
[52:46] family that there's such little love in
[52:48] that family and and i' I've seen it just
[52:51] through their generations and they were
[52:53] growing up and it was a very cold hard
[52:56] home to live in and the the grandfather
[52:59] was a
[53:01] pastor and he treated his his children
[53:04] very harshly and then their children
[53:07] then his children treated their children
[53:11] harshly and it just one thing after the
[53:13] other there then the grandchildren of
[53:16] this man completely left everything that
[53:19] that was important to the grandpa and
[53:20] became harsh critics of that and it's
[53:23] all because there was no love in that
[53:25] family wow and then they repeated the
[53:28] same thing to their children and then to
[53:30] their children to their children W I can
[53:34] look at my kids right now and I can see
[53:35] that I've made many mistakes but if
[53:37] there's anything that has held our
[53:38] family together it's because we had
[53:41] love we had dinner Stephanie would make
[53:44] dinner for us all together in the in the
[53:46] evenings and we would we would laugh and
[53:49] and we'd pray together and we'd have
[53:51] Bible study together and it was an every
[53:53] night thing and I remember when they
[53:54] were tiny babies they would come come up
[53:56] and sit on my lap because bedtime was
[53:58] the best time of the day because Dad was
[54:00] going to read stories it wasn't sticking
[54:03] a DVD in the television it was Dad
[54:07] reading those Bible
[54:09] stories and I to open that and we'd have
[54:11] the little Bible
[54:13] book reading to the kids and I'm sitting
[54:15] on my lap and and I was just loving it
[54:18] and and and they knew that when it was
[54:20] time starting time to get to to go to
[54:23] bed they knew it's like okay Daddy's
[54:25] going to quit here pretty soon soon and
[54:27] that little girl she was so
[54:29] quick I'd be reading and i' I'd get to
[54:32] the next story and that the story would
[54:34] coming to an end it would be Elijah or
[54:35] something and I'd always take the book
[54:38] and I'd do
[54:41] this and they knew that was in well
[54:45] Madeline and I tried to do it
[54:48] quick and she'd stick her fingerin in
[54:52] there and she'd say one more daddy one
[54:55] more and it was building this
[54:57] generational blessing of having these
[55:00] these kids together but the curses come
[55:04] down too I've seen churches people will
[55:07] have a real controlling real domineering
[55:09] Pastor real domineering Church families
[55:12] come out of this cultist church and then
[55:14] they go to another church and then they
[55:16] want that church to be like the one that
[55:18] they
[55:19] left and they start putting pressure on
[55:22] the pastor they start putting pressure
[55:23] on the people they're looking around do
[55:24] you see how these people are dressed do
[55:26] you see all the what these people are
[55:27] doing did you see this you just came out
[55:29] of that and you want to bring it here
[55:33] you want to bring that generational
[55:35] curse that has come down through there
[55:37] and now you want to bring it to this
[55:39] church
[55:41] no and then the other way
[55:44] too there's people that come in and they
[55:47] want to just they want no control at all
[55:50] they want no correction at all they want
[55:52] to come to church and then have a
[55:54] feel-good sermon and just live any way
[55:57] that they want to want to
[55:59] live that doesn't do any good
[56:02] either that's come down no we need to
[56:06] come here for correction Godly
[56:07] correction Lord I want to change I want
[56:10] to be
[56:12] different and there's no discipline they
[56:15] want to say there's they're Christians
[56:17] as long as Christ doesn't change their
[56:19] way of
[56:22] living and it's you get the same result
[56:27] you get a group that wants to be
[56:29] controlled and a group that wants no
[56:31] control at all and you end up with the
[56:33] same
[56:37] thing they go to
[56:39] church that allows both sides they want
[56:43] to go to a church that allows them to
[56:46] bypass their the Bible for their own
[56:51] desires both
[56:53] sides you want no correction no um Godly
[56:58] instruction at all over here or you want
[57:01] Total Control and you want a a a firm
[57:06] hand
[57:08] really neither is seeking the Holy
[57:11] Spirit neither is seeking God they're
[57:13] both seeking their own desires wow let
[57:17] me go back to Exodus 20 again I want to
[57:18] read
[57:20] that thou shalt not make unto thee any
[57:22] graven images or any likeness of
[57:25] anything that is in Heaven above or that
[57:27] is in the earth beneath or that is in
[57:28] the water under the Earth Thou shalt not
[57:30] bow down thyself to them nor serve them
[57:34] for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God
[57:37] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[57:39] upon the
[57:40] children unto the third and the fourth
[57:44] generation I said no one hates
[57:47] God but they hate the correction when
[57:49] the word comes and then they interpret
[57:52] the word to match their own doctrines
[57:55] and these are I'm talking about
[57:58] generational curses but if the Lord's
[58:01] willing and we can get there I will end
[58:03] with generational blessings that also
[58:05] come down so Brother Paul's question
[58:07] about our
[58:09] fathers I was meditating on this as uh
[58:14] during the week it really struck me you
[58:17] know brother
[58:18] Paul he had his own reason for writing
[58:22] it and he told me the other day he said
[58:23] dad he said he said brother Daniel he
[58:25] says it didn't have a
[58:27] dad and he says I just wanted to
[58:30] know what these other brothers what the
[58:33] these other brother said but then he
[58:34] told me he says but then the Lord has
[58:37] told me over and over again through the
[58:39] years I have been your
[58:41] father I have sent you these I have sent
[58:45] you father figures into your life and it
[58:49] bless me and that that's really how it
[58:51] is and then on
[58:54] Thursday I was
[58:57] um I
[58:58] called
[59:00] Zyra on a totally unrelated
[59:03] topic and I could tell her voice was a
[59:05] little shaky and and she sent the prayer
[59:09] request out last night and she um she
[59:13] told me she says I was um you know her
[59:17] and Brother Joseph just got married and
[59:20] they want to have a um a ceremony when
[59:24] they're a little bit more on their feet
[59:26] later on and she says I called my
[59:30] friend because I wanted to to be my maid
[59:33] of honor my best friend for ever long
[59:35] and she wouldn't answer the
[59:38] phone and she was texting her and and
[59:41] she wouldn't answer then finally she
[59:42] says hey I'm going to do a well welfare
[59:44] check on you I can't get in touch with
[59:46] you and her friend
[59:50] responds and she responds sorry I forgot
[59:54] the exact wording but she
[59:57] said that she said I'm just trying to
[1:00:03] break generational
[1:00:05] curses right sister Zara
[1:00:35] she said she talked about generational
[1:00:37] curses and then when I when I talked to
[1:00:39] Sister Zyra said what did you say it was
[1:00:42] the same thing that was on my mind for
[1:00:44] the for the whole week and these
[1:00:47] generational curses they come down they
[1:00:50] come down through the families and you
[1:00:52] can see many families are successful
[1:00:54] their parents were successful their
[1:00:56] grandparents were successful as far as
[1:00:57] monetary things and then other families
[1:00:59] you see they just struggle struggle
[1:01:01] struggle struggle because these things
[1:01:03] come down and they're taught that way
[1:01:04] but those those curses can stop I was
[1:01:08] driving here this morning and when we
[1:01:11] got on
[1:01:12] Stone I looked and there was a man
[1:01:15] walking down um opposite of traffic
[1:01:19] walking down on the sidewalk and I and I
[1:01:20] saw him and and I saw that he was
[1:01:23] probably a homeless man and I I looked
[1:01:24] at him and and I I saw he's been taught
[1:01:28] that way his whole life his dad was a
[1:01:32] drug addict his mom was a drug addict he
[1:01:35] comes from a
[1:01:37] generation of people that have done that
[1:01:40] type of thing what would of course you
[1:01:42] would expect him to be the same
[1:01:44] person and I looked at that I I said
[1:01:47] Lord I said do you want me to change my
[1:01:50] subject this morning I just I felt so
[1:01:52] bad and I said I would never want to
[1:01:53] hurt that man because I I know that been
[1:01:56] through so
[1:01:58] much that he's suffered because of his
[1:02:02] parents and now he is what he is because
[1:02:05] of a generational curse that came
[1:02:09] down I was I was ready to change and you
[1:02:12] know I got got in there and I prayed and
[1:02:15] felt like no just go
[1:02:17] forward those generational curses they
[1:02:20] come down but they can be
[1:02:22] broken in Psychology some of the
[1:02:26] the college students here and those that
[1:02:28] have been to college if you take
[1:02:30] psychology either 101 or or 2011 um they
[1:02:35] explain a
[1:02:36] phenomenon of nature versus
[1:02:39] nurture and nature is the way that
[1:02:42] you're
[1:02:43] born you have these two strands of DNA
[1:02:46] going down and it's got all of these
[1:02:48] different amino acids in it and
[1:02:49] everybody's are different and each each
[1:02:52] little piece of that DNA makes you who
[1:02:55] you are
[1:02:56] and each little piece of that DNA there
[1:03:00] there in that whole strand there are
[1:03:01] pieces in there that that give you a
[1:03:04] weakness for sin every one of
[1:03:07] us and it comes from as I read earlier
[1:03:10] it comes from
[1:03:12] Adam it comes from our father it comes
[1:03:15] from the first man and it goes down all
[1:03:18] the way and there are all these these
[1:03:20] different places where sin is and it
[1:03:25] makes us have weaknesses all of us have
[1:03:27] weaknesses and all of us have different
[1:03:29] weaknesses but we have the same weakness
[1:03:31] for sin there's um there's a
[1:03:36] gene I read this
[1:03:39] mc1r meline you should know this one
[1:03:42] it's the redheaded
[1:03:44] Jean
[1:03:46] and the two parents have to carry the
[1:03:50] genan Stephanie carries the Jean she has
[1:03:53] red hair in her family I carry the I
[1:03:56] have red hair in my family so Stephanie
[1:03:58] and I get together and we make a
[1:03:59] redheaded baby but if ju if just one
[1:04:03] person has that Gene then a redheaded
[1:04:06] baby can't can't be
[1:04:08] produced so you see that redheads are
[1:04:11] starting to get less and less and less
[1:04:14] because they used to be isolated in one
[1:04:17] part of Europe and everybody is
[1:04:18] redheaded so your your the wife that you
[1:04:20] married or the husband that you married
[1:04:22] was probably going to be redheaded so
[1:04:23] you're probably going to have redheaded
[1:04:24] CH children but when when the world
[1:04:26] started to
[1:04:27] spread it started to dilute
[1:04:30] that so you have to have two so if you
[1:04:33] marry somebody without that Gene you're
[1:04:35] not going to have a redheaded baby and
[1:04:38] that's how it is with us we all have
[1:04:42] genes you can't get out of it and those
[1:04:46] genes are simple I mean some
[1:04:51] sinful every one of us and it and we
[1:04:54] have to overcome that is the nature part
[1:04:58] the nurture part is what I just talked
[1:05:01] about it's how you are raised you're
[1:05:03] raised with strengths and you're raised
[1:05:05] with weaknesses your parents have
[1:05:06] strengths your parents have weaknesses
[1:05:08] grandparents all the way down you see
[1:05:11] many alcoholic children their parents
[1:05:14] were
[1:05:15] alcoholics not always but many times
[1:05:19] many
[1:05:21] divorced children their parents or
[1:05:25] grandparents parents went through that
[1:05:28] it comes down through not always but it
[1:05:30] comes down
[1:05:32] through back to Romans chapter
[1:05:37] 5 start with verse number 14
[1:05:41] nevertheless death reigned from Adam to
[1:05:43] Moses even over them that had not sinned
[1:05:45] after the similitude of Adam's
[1:05:46] transgression who is the figure of him
[1:05:49] that was to come so Adam was created
[1:05:52] Adam sin with his wife Eve in the Garden
[1:05:54] of Eden before before that they had
[1:05:56] eternal life that DNA strand was perfect
[1:06:00] there was no aging there was there was
[1:06:03] no problems they were perfect but
[1:06:07] somehow Satan injected that
[1:06:11] sin into that nature of a human
[1:06:16] being and the human genome just passed
[1:06:18] down those traits to Generations after
[1:06:20] them it was a generational curse that
[1:06:23] was manifested in many ways and is still
[1:06:26] manifesting itself in my life and in
[1:06:29] your
[1:06:30] life right here in Romans Paul is saying
[1:06:32] that the first Adam failed but there was
[1:06:35] coming a second Adam who was able to
[1:06:39] correct that generational
[1:06:43] curse but not as the offense so also is
[1:06:46] the free gift for though the for for if
[1:06:49] through the offense of one man many be
[1:06:52] dead much more the grace of God and the
[1:06:54] gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus
[1:06:56] Christ hath abounded unto many and not
[1:07:00] as it was by by one that sinned so is
[1:07:02] the gift for the Judgment was by one to
[1:07:06] condemnation but the free gift is of
[1:07:09] many is of many offenses un
[1:07:12] justification now here's what's going to
[1:07:14] make that clear remember Peter said I
[1:07:18] love the way that the brothers talked
[1:07:19] back then Peter in his epistle says he
[1:07:22] says hey he says
[1:07:26] listen I know Paul's hard to understand
[1:07:30] in some of the things that he
[1:07:32] writes but he said and those that are
[1:07:34] unstable wrestle with those things that
[1:07:36] Paul said as they do the other
[1:07:40] scriptures and there Peter is saying
[1:07:43] that Paul's writings are scripture even
[1:07:46] back 2,000 years
[1:07:52] ago where are we at verse number 17
[1:07:56] for If by one man's offense death Reign
[1:07:58] by one much more they which receive
[1:08:02] abundance of Grace and of the gift of
[1:08:05] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:08:07] Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense
[1:08:09] of one judgment Came Upon all men to
[1:08:12] condemnation even so by the
[1:08:14] righteousness of one the free gift came
[1:08:17] upon all men un justification of life so
[1:08:20] the sin of Adam in the Garden of Eden
[1:08:21] brought death because of the promise of
[1:08:23] God God promised if you do this you're
[1:08:26] going to die and there the human race
[1:08:29] was
[1:08:31] cursed if you eat this fruit
[1:08:33] metaphorically speaking if you eat this
[1:08:35] fruit in the garden you are rebelling
[1:08:37] against the Commandments of God and then
[1:08:39] you will die for as by one man's
[1:08:41] Disobedience many were made
[1:08:43] Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall
[1:08:47] many be made
[1:08:50] righteous the sin that was in that
[1:08:52] double
[1:08:53] helix can be removed
[1:08:56] D and it's when it will be removed when
[1:08:59] we receive our glorious bodies it'll be
[1:09:02] perfect the DNA will be perfect there'll
[1:09:04] be no aging it'll be just like it was in
[1:09:07] the Garden of Eden it'll be just
[1:09:10] wonderful and we'll have fellowship with
[1:09:13] God and these sins these generational
[1:09:16] curses curses that come down they're not
[1:09:18] our
[1:09:19] fault they're not your fault that you
[1:09:21] have a weakness that was passed along to
[1:09:24] you by your environment where you grew
[1:09:26] up and your bloodline it's not your
[1:09:29] fault meline was a a pediatric nurse for
[1:09:32] a while and one of the things with the
[1:09:35] babies that are abandoned or given up
[1:09:36] for adoption they got to hold the
[1:09:39] baby they got to give it
[1:09:42] love because if they don't give it Love
[1:09:45] at a very very young age that baby needs
[1:09:47] to be held against the bosom it needs to
[1:09:50] be it needs to be close and loved
[1:09:54] otherwise
[1:09:55] and this is a proven fact it will cause
[1:09:58] behavioral emotional emotional and
[1:10:00] social problems later in life a
[1:10:04] newborn they've got to be
[1:10:06] loved if they don't receive that they're
[1:10:10] going to have problems later on and they
[1:10:12] may pass on those problems look at the
[1:10:15] look at the changes in our own little
[1:10:19] church here with brother Jeremy sister
[1:10:21] Angela and those kids those kids
[1:10:26] foster kids wherever they end up they
[1:10:28] are forever
[1:10:29] changed because of the love that they've
[1:10:31] received from their parents and that the
[1:10:33] love that they've received from this
[1:10:35] church don't underestimate love it's the
[1:10:39] greatest Force love well the Bible says
[1:10:42] if you don't believe that I'll quote the
[1:10:44] Apostle John three three words God is
[1:10:53] love these generational curse are real
[1:10:56] let me give you a couple examples
[1:10:57] Abraham Isaac and Jacob we all know who
[1:11:00] they
[1:11:00] are Genesis
[1:11:03] 12 Abraham had a
[1:11:07] problem he did I know he was the father
[1:11:10] of Nations and he was he was a man that
[1:11:12] was a friend of gods he was a great man
[1:11:15] but he had a
[1:11:17] weakness listen to this Abraham chapter
[1:11:19] or um I'm sorry Genesis
[1:11:23] 12:9 and Abram journeyed
[1:11:25] going on still toward the South and
[1:11:28] there was a famine in the land and Abram
[1:11:30] went down into Egypt to sojourn there
[1:11:32] for the famine was Grievous in the land
[1:11:34] and it came to pass when he was come
[1:11:36] near uh to enter into Egypt that he said
[1:11:40] to Sarah his wife behold now I know that
[1:11:44] thou art a fair woman to look
[1:11:47] upon she was
[1:11:50] good-looking
[1:11:52] therefore it shall come to pass when the
[1:11:55] Egyptians shall see thee that they shall
[1:11:58] say this is his wife and they will kill
[1:12:01] me but they will save you
[1:12:05] alive so I pray thee Thou Art my sister
[1:12:08] that was his half sister which was okay
[1:12:10] back then that was his half
[1:12:13] sister I pray thee that thou art my
[1:12:16] sister that it will be well with me I
[1:12:18] pray so I pray thee Thou Art my sister
[1:12:22] so tell them that you're my sister that
[1:12:25] it may be well with me for thy sake and
[1:12:28] my soul shall live because of thee so
[1:12:31] he's saying Sarah
[1:12:33] lie and Abraham lied and it came to pass
[1:12:36] that when Abram was come into Egypt the
[1:12:38] Egyptians beheld the woman and she was
[1:12:41] very
[1:12:42] fair the princes of pharaoh also saw and
[1:12:45] commended her before pharaoh and the
[1:12:47] woman was taken into Pharaoh's house and
[1:12:49] he entreated Abraham well for her
[1:12:52] sake and she had and he had sheep and
[1:12:55] oxen and he asses and men's servants and
[1:12:57] Maid servants and she asses and camels
[1:13:00] and the Lord plagued Pharaoh in his
[1:13:01] house with great plagues because of
[1:13:03] Sarah Abram's wife he didn't even
[1:13:08] know and he brought this woman because
[1:13:10] she's a she's a beautiful woman he
[1:13:12] brings her in and he's like okay I'm
[1:13:14] gonna I'm gonna marry this lady and
[1:13:16] Pharaoh called
[1:13:18] Abram and saidwhat is this that thou
[1:13:21] Hast done unto me why did you why didn't
[1:13:23] you tell me that she was your wife'
[1:13:26] why sayest thou that she is my sister so
[1:13:29] I might have taken her to to me to wife
[1:13:32] now therefore Behold thy wife take her
[1:13:34] and go away and Pharaoh commended his
[1:13:37] men concerning him and they sent him
[1:13:40] away and his wife and all that he had
[1:13:43] this is
[1:13:45] before Isaac his promised son was born
[1:13:48] Abraham was Barren his wife was
[1:13:51] Barren this is before Isaac was born
[1:13:55] now Isaac is born later on after this
[1:13:57] God gives him the promise Sarah gives
[1:14:01] birth to Isaac Isaac is born and then
[1:14:04] after and then after that Isaac grows up
[1:14:07] and he like his dad married a beautiful
[1:14:12] girl and he also married a girl that was
[1:14:16] Barren Abraham married a barren woman
[1:14:20] she couldn't have children Isaac married
[1:14:23] a Barren girl she couldn't have children
[1:14:26] Now watch how Isaac handles the same
[1:14:29] situation those generational weaknesses
[1:14:32] come down watch how Isaac handles the
[1:14:33] same situation Genesis 26 another famine
[1:14:37] in the
[1:14:38] land Isaac's dad's dead Abraham he's
[1:14:41] gone Isaac's wife's Barren she's getting
[1:14:44] old like Sarah was she's
[1:14:47] beautiful like Sarah was Isaac was
[1:14:50] desperate during the famine like Abraham
[1:14:52] was now look look what his son does look
[1:14:54] what Abraham's son does and Isaac went
[1:14:56] to G to
[1:14:58] gerar and the men of the place asked him
[1:15:01] of his
[1:15:04] wife and he said she is my
[1:15:08] sister for he feared to say she is my
[1:15:11] wife lest said he the men of that place
[1:15:14] should kill me for Rebecca because she
[1:15:16] was fair to look upon Abraham lied his
[1:15:21] son Isaac I mean Abraham was long gone
[1:15:24] his son Isaac did the exact same thing
[1:15:27] how many times do we see our parents and
[1:15:31] we do the same
[1:15:32] thing I was just talking the other day
[1:15:36] with a couple young people here and
[1:15:39] talking about a
[1:15:40] friend and I knew this friend's parents
[1:15:43] and this and the the parents are the the
[1:15:47] the
[1:15:49] dad couldn't stand the way his dad
[1:15:52] was a major problem and then as time
[1:15:55] goes on this man has become his
[1:15:59] dad and has the same weaknesses the same
[1:16:02] outspoken the same dominating
[1:16:03] personality as his dad did that change
[1:16:06] that just went all the way through and
[1:16:08] you become your
[1:16:09] parents you don't have to you can take
[1:16:13] you know people say you have to take the
[1:16:14] good with the bad with the good I don't
[1:16:16] believe that I don't believe that at all
[1:16:19] you can take the good and get rid of the
[1:16:22] bad and that's with our parents
[1:16:25] I want you Daniel and meline to get rid
[1:16:27] of all the bad that you ever learned
[1:16:29] from Dad and just keep the
[1:16:33] good same thing happened with Judah so
[1:16:37] you have Abraham he lied Isaac he lied
[1:16:39] then Jacob he lied a
[1:16:43] lot it just came down and down and down
[1:16:45] he followed all the way through and then
[1:16:47] Jacob's son Judah he had another problem
[1:16:50] he had another weakness he had a
[1:16:52] weakness with women
[1:16:56] so his daughter-in his son died he was
[1:17:00] married to this
[1:17:02] girl
[1:17:04] and there there were some problems in
[1:17:07] the family so his daughter didn't really
[1:17:09] she didn't receive any inheritance his
[1:17:11] daughter-in-law she didn't receive any
[1:17:13] inh inheritance and she was having
[1:17:14] problems so she knew that her
[1:17:18] father-in-law had a weakness for
[1:17:22] women so she dresses up covers her face
[1:17:25] she dresses up as a prostitute why she
[1:17:28] knew that he was going to solicit her is
[1:17:31] because she knew that Judah had an
[1:17:33] issue she goes and she sits at the Gate
[1:17:36] of the city where the prostitute would
[1:17:37] sit Judah comes
[1:17:40] by she propositions him he she knows
[1:17:43] what he's going to do they they ended up
[1:17:45] having a relation there and then she
[1:17:49] leaves
[1:17:51] and he tries to cover it up he doesn't
[1:17:55] want anybody to know he was with a
[1:17:56] prostitute but obviously he'd done it
[1:17:59] before and then she comes back and she
[1:18:03] says Hey I was that prostitute you owe
[1:18:07] me and I've conceived a child and he was
[1:18:11] like watch how Judah reacted you're
[1:18:15] right you're a better person than I
[1:18:18] am the tribe of Judah on down we see
[1:18:23] somebody who is the most famous person
[1:18:25] other than the Lord Jesus from the tribe
[1:18:27] of Judah give me an answer David King
[1:18:32] David David with those same genetics
[1:18:35] with that same genome Pro genome problem
[1:18:38] there David was outside of his Palace
[1:18:41] the king he looks down and he sees a
[1:18:42] woman
[1:18:43] bathing that same Spirit manifested
[1:18:47] itself in
[1:18:48] David David goes up her names baath
[1:18:51] Sheba you know the story he goes He
[1:18:53] propositions her brings her in she
[1:18:55] conceived just like I know 700 years
[1:18:58] earlier Judah did shows that
[1:19:01] weakness then ends up having her husband
[1:19:05] killed then Nathan the prophet comes to
[1:19:08] David and he says hey this I'm want to
[1:19:11] tell you the story about this man
[1:19:12] stealing this this poor man this this
[1:19:15] rich man stealing this poor man's only
[1:19:17] lamb and this rich man had all kinds of
[1:19:19] lambs David said I'll kill that man
[1:19:22] Nathan the prophet said David you are
[1:19:24] that man man you
[1:19:26] sto this man uah's wife you know what
[1:19:30] David did exactly what Judah
[1:19:33] did he said I have sinned against the
[1:19:36] Lord he admitted
[1:19:38] it then David's son Solomon and all the
[1:19:40] women in involved in that Solomon had
[1:19:44] the same problem it came down through
[1:19:46] the
[1:19:47] line but it broke with the lion of the
[1:19:51] tribe of
[1:19:52] Judah Jesus Christ came and he took that
[1:19:56] sinful nature and Jesus made it to where
[1:19:59] that sinful nature can go away and be be
[1:20:02] gone and we have that ability as long as
[1:20:06] we accept that that nature of God if
[1:20:08] that nature will come in us then that
[1:20:11] sinful nature will go away you might
[1:20:13] always have a weakness there but you'll
[1:20:15] be able to overcome it then the lion of
[1:20:18] the tribe of Judah just go back to that
[1:20:20] Roman scripture Jesus made it to where
[1:20:24] that you don't have to
[1:20:26] sin he made it to where that you can be
[1:20:29] saved Adam made it to where that we all
[1:20:31] are lost Jesus came the second Adam and
[1:20:34] made it to where anyone that accepts him
[1:20:36] can be
[1:20:37] saved and those generational curses are
[1:20:43] destroyed where it says in Romans Again
[1:20:46] by one man's Disobedience many were made
[1:20:49] Sinners but by one man's obedience many
[1:20:53] shall be made righteous not just they're
[1:20:57] forgiven the Gene's taken
[1:20:59] out the nature and the nurture are both
[1:21:02] removed and many shall be made righteous
[1:21:05] Paul is the one that wrote this Paul
[1:21:07] came years after Jesus did he didn't say
[1:21:10] that they were made
[1:21:12] righteous he said they shall be made
[1:21:16] righteous future tense talking about
[1:21:20] me talking about you and you may not be
[1:21:23] there yet
[1:21:25] but you have that opportunity to where
[1:21:28] you shall be made righteous if you
[1:21:30] accept Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:21:32] your sins that's right you can be made
[1:21:37] righteous whatever your nature is
[1:21:39] whatever your DNA is it's not your fault
[1:21:41] it came from
[1:21:42] Adam came from the first one and it came
[1:21:45] all the way
[1:21:46] down but Jesus Christ the second Adam
[1:21:51] can make that right I'll close
[1:21:55] with a
[1:21:56] parable but you have that double helix
[1:21:59] you have that strand of DNA I'm not a
[1:22:02] doctor I have no idea but I mean I I I
[1:22:04] read an article last night um so I know
[1:22:08] more than a lot of you
[1:22:10] do but anyways um I'm a
[1:22:14] scientist I study water so I know about
[1:22:19] DNA I'm
[1:22:21] kidding that
[1:22:23] strand comes comes down everything about
[1:22:25] you is in that strand every weakness you
[1:22:28] have every strength that you have is in
[1:22:30] that DNA God is able to go in and pull
[1:22:36] that
[1:22:36] out so you teach your children you don't
[1:22:39] have to pass pass what your parents if
[1:22:42] they failed you don't have to pass on
[1:22:44] the bad you just pass on the good
[1:22:46] Matthew chapter 12 verse 43 when you
[1:22:49] pull something
[1:22:51] out there's a hole there
[1:22:55] and that hole needs to be
[1:22:57] filled Matthew 12:43 when the unclean
[1:23:00] Spirit has gone out of a man he walketh
[1:23:03] through Dry places seeking rest and
[1:23:05] findeth
[1:23:07] none then he saith I will return into my
[1:23:10] house from which I came out and when he
[1:23:12] is come he findeth it empty and swept
[1:23:15] and
[1:23:17] garnished then he
[1:23:18] goeth so what this is this is talking
[1:23:22] about an evil spirit it is talking about
[1:23:25] a generational
[1:23:27] curse and it's in you and then when you
[1:23:32] overcome that and Jesus Christ gives you
[1:23:36] strength to cast it out now there's a
[1:23:40] hole and you got to fill up that
[1:23:44] hole he saith I will return to my house
[1:23:47] the the demon talking I will return into
[1:23:50] my house living in one of these people I
[1:23:52] will return into my house from whence I
[1:23:56] came out and when he is come he findeth
[1:23:58] it empty and swept and garnished wow
[1:24:00] this is nice this is better than when I
[1:24:02] left this person gave his heart to the
[1:24:06] Lord and he swept out all the problems
[1:24:09] and everything this is great I'm going
[1:24:11] to go right back in because there's a
[1:24:13] hole there and now it's better than when
[1:24:16] I left the demon speaking and he goeth
[1:24:19] and he taketh himself and he's like ah
[1:24:21] there's room for all my friends to come
[1:24:23] in now it's not just one problem that
[1:24:25] you have maybe it's drinking maybe it's
[1:24:28] a temper maybe it was gossip it wasn't
[1:24:31] just one problem that it has now now I'm
[1:24:34] going to come back in with my original
[1:24:36] problems and I'm G to fill you I'm going
[1:24:37] to fill it up with all my
[1:24:39] friends then he goeth and he taketh with
[1:24:42] himself seven other Spirits more wicked
[1:24:44] than himself and they enter and dwell in
[1:24:46] there and the last state of the man is
[1:24:47] worse than the first even so shall it be
[1:24:52] also unto this wicked generation
[1:24:55] when the house is cleaned out that void
[1:24:57] needs to be filled you may be delivered
[1:25:01] you may come to the Altar and say Lord
[1:25:02] you delivered me you delivered me from
[1:25:04] my lying you delivered me from my temper
[1:25:07] you delivered me from whatever it is but
[1:25:11] now you have to fill that hole what
[1:25:14] fills the
[1:25:15] hole yes say it
[1:25:18] louder Jesus Christ fills that hole in
[1:25:21] the form of the Holy Spirit and then
[1:25:24] nothing can get in
[1:25:26] there by one man's Disobedience many
[1:25:29] were made Sinners but by one man's
[1:25:31] obedience many shall be made righteous
[1:25:35] you can't change the
[1:25:37] Bible you can try to explain
[1:25:40] it but the doctrines won't
[1:25:44] work take it the way it
[1:25:46] says take it take this scripture don't
[1:25:51] throw it out because it doesn't match
[1:25:52] your Doctrine
[1:25:55] look at this generational blessing and
[1:25:57] I'll close with
[1:25:59] this we had all the generational curses
[1:26:01] in all of us listen if you don't see a
[1:26:05] generational curse in your life maybe
[1:26:08] you're living in that generational
[1:26:11] curse maybe you're acting out in that
[1:26:14] generational curse because you can't see
[1:26:16] it you can see everybody else's problems
[1:26:19] but maybe you can't see your own I don't
[1:26:21] feel necessarily that's the way it is
[1:26:24] with people in here but all of us have
[1:26:27] them but listen to this generational
[1:26:31] blessing second Timothy chapter 1 verse
[1:26:37] three the Apostle Paul again Paul and
[1:26:40] Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[1:26:42] God according to the promise of life
[1:26:44] which is in Christ Jesus to Timothy my
[1:26:47] dearly beloved Son grace mercy and peace
[1:26:51] from God the father in Christ Jesus our
[1:26:53] lord I thank God whom I serve from my
[1:26:57] forefathers which pure with a with pure
[1:26:59] conscience that without ceasing I have
[1:27:01] made remembrance of thee in my prayers
[1:27:03] night and day greatly Desiring to see
[1:27:06] thee being mindful of thy tears that I
[1:27:09] that I may be filled with joy Paul
[1:27:13] dearly loves this young man Timothy he
[1:27:16] says it's his son so I assume Tim Paul
[1:27:18] is the one that led him to the
[1:27:20] Lord verse number five
[1:27:24] when I call to remembrance the unfeigned
[1:27:28] faith that is in thee which dwelt first
[1:27:31] in thy grandmother
[1:27:34] Lois and in thy mother
[1:27:38] Unice and I am persuaded that is in thee
[1:27:43] also a generational blessing that came
[1:27:46] down right here wherefore I put thee in
[1:27:48] remembrance that thou stir up the gift
[1:27:50] of God which is in thee by the putting
[1:27:54] out of my hands you have this gift from
[1:27:56] God it's in your genetics it's it's the
[1:27:58] way you were raised you have this
[1:28:00] because of your grandmother and you have
[1:28:02] it because of your mom now you have it
[1:28:06] Timothy what are you going to do with it
[1:28:09] take the good and throw out the bad move
[1:28:13] forward
[1:28:14] Timothy the generational curse that was
[1:28:16] brought through the Garden of Eden can
[1:28:18] be overcome with generational blessings
[1:28:20] through Jesus Christ and you see it
[1:28:25] listen think about it we see
[1:28:29] it I don't want to go to
[1:28:32] church I don't have to go to church I
[1:28:34] bet your dad said the same
[1:28:37] thing I bet you his dad his dad's dad
[1:28:40] said the same
[1:28:42] thing
[1:28:43] well the fighting that you have with
[1:28:46] your wife or with your husband you fight
[1:28:48] you you you battle and you your your
[1:28:50] children watch that I'll bet you your
[1:28:52] parents fought too and
[1:28:58] argued the generational
[1:29:01] curse can
[1:29:03] end according to Romans it was promised
[1:29:06] that it can end I think about that that
[1:29:10] Lois and Eunice and
[1:29:14] Timothy I think about my grandmother
[1:29:16] wave a Wheeler she's watching right now
[1:29:19] I
[1:29:20] assume
[1:29:22] Grandma you
[1:29:24] down to my mother
[1:29:27] meline and then down to Daniel Evans
[1:29:32] me that that Grace that gift that you
[1:29:35] showed just as Paul here is saying to
[1:29:37] Timothy the grandmother waa the mother
[1:29:40] meline on down to the Sun and I'm I am
[1:29:43] passing that on to both of my children
[1:29:46] the generational blessings just as it
[1:29:48] says here in the
[1:29:50] Bible and the generational curses
[1:29:52] brothers and sisters the generation
[1:29:54] ational curses did not start with you
[1:29:57] but they can end with
[1:30:00] you think about
[1:30:02] that the generational curses that I have
[1:30:05] that came through my my family that that
[1:30:07] went all the way up it ends with
[1:30:11] me I saw many times I saw the the gossip
[1:30:14] and the fighting and the family and all
[1:30:16] that you know what it ends with
[1:30:18] me that curse I'm done with it and I
[1:30:22] have been for a long time I remember a
[1:30:24] young man seeing the problems and saying
[1:30:26] I will not do
[1:30:27] that that curse ends with this guy I'm
[1:30:31] done with it same thing with the
[1:30:33] churches the churches want they they
[1:30:35] want to have they want to have control
[1:30:37] and they want to be they want to be
[1:30:41] dominating they want there's certain
[1:30:43] ones and then there's other ones that as
[1:30:44] I said earlier they don't want any
[1:30:46] control that ends that can
[1:30:48] end because it divides people and
[1:30:51] nothing ever comes of
[1:30:52] it Make It
[1:30:55] Stop end it and it can end with you
[1:30:58] musicians
[1:31:00] come it will
[1:31:02] end this generational curses these
[1:31:05] curses that were on me they end right
[1:31:09] here and may the ones that are in each
[1:31:13] one of you end with
[1:31:17] you they didn't start with
[1:31:19] you but they can end with
[1:31:22] you no none of these as I said none of
[1:31:25] these are your fault Romans Chapter 5
[1:31:28] Verse
[1:31:29] 18 therefore as by the offense of one
[1:31:32] judgment Came Upon all men to
[1:31:35] condemnation even so by the
[1:31:37] righteousness of one the free gift came
[1:31:40] upon all men unto justification of life
[1:31:44] for as by one man's
[1:31:46] Disobedience many were made Sinners so
[1:31:49] by The Obedience of one shall many be be
[1:31:53] made
[1:31:55] righteous self-righteousness it ends
[1:31:58] here Pride it ends here judgmental
[1:32:03] attitude it ends here lack of humility
[1:32:06] it ends here a religious
[1:32:08] spirit dominating religious spirit it
[1:32:10] ends here weakness for money ends here
[1:32:15] weakness for gossip it ends here a lack
[1:32:18] of wisdom it
[1:32:21] ends if you lack Wisdom ask
[1:32:24] and it shall be given to you chronic
[1:32:26] money problems it ends a slothful spirit
[1:32:31] a lack of
[1:32:32] zeal it can
[1:32:35] end you understand fear
[1:32:39] fear it can end
[1:32:42] am it is fear can end if you're
[1:32:47] afraid you're afraid of somebody saying
[1:32:49] something about you you're afraid of
[1:32:50] being judged you're afraid of saying the
[1:32:52] wrong things you're afraid of taking the
[1:32:54] wrong job you're afraid of this you're
[1:32:55] afraid of that you're afraid of what the
[1:32:57] church is going to think if you do
[1:32:58] something fear can
[1:33:00] end and let it end let it end with
[1:33:05] you don't let it keep going it can end
[1:33:09] and it ends when that problem is cast
[1:33:13] out and then the Holy
[1:33:15] Spirit replaces it

[1:41:22] David like 700 years those things don't
[1:41:24] go away but when the lion of the tribe
[1:41:27] of Judah came they were they
[1:41:31] were they were
[1:41:34] stricken to death mortally
[1:41:37] wounded they may still be alive but they
[1:41:41] are mortally wounded and one day all of
