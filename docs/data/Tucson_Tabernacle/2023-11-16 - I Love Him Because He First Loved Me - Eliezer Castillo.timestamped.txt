[30:25] prayer requests and
[30:28] I'm going read them to
[30:33] you from Erica Morales please pray that
[30:37] my
[30:37] employer give me Sunday off
[30:42] amen you know it's
[30:45] sometimes we wonder about our employers
[30:48] and but I had an
[30:51] employer as a good man me and my
[30:54] brother-in-law used to work there
[30:56] together and they had all these radios
[30:58] going on and this playing their music
[31:01] and them playing their music and they'd
[31:02] put it louder because they couldn't hear
[31:04] and they'd put it
[31:05] louder and it got to be just bad in the
[31:09] in the air and one day he walks up to me
[31:12] and my brother-in-law Mike and he says
[31:15] I'm going to do something I think's
[31:17] going to disappoint you all but I'm
[31:19] going to make them turn off all the
[31:22] radios he said they're competing one
[31:24] another he says I know that's going to
[31:26] disappoint you all
[31:27] he said' but I respect both of you he
[31:30] says I couldn't be a Christian like you
[31:32] but I respect it so he turned all the
[31:35] radios off and I just said Thank You
[31:37] Lord God is able so I believe the Lord
[31:41] can do this and a prayer request for
[31:45] Sister Sarah Conner says please pray for
[31:48] my sister anlam she says last week we
[31:50] found out she has terminal cancer she
[31:53] believes in God and she has been healed
[31:55] before but this has been a rough for her
[31:58] just pray God's Will and pray she gets a
[32:00] peace about it all so God bless you and
[32:03] let's pray for Sister Sarah too as she's
[32:06] helping take care of her and I believe
[32:08] her brother-in-law had to be put in to
[32:11] be cared for as they we're taking care
[32:13] of her so she's part of the family of
[32:15] God so let's remember if you'll stand
[32:17] with
[32:18] me you have a
[32:21] need something Lord you know you know I
[32:24] I need
[32:25] you sometimes I don't have the words for
[32:27] it sometimes are just something inside
[32:29] so if we'll believe that if we can do
[32:33] that brother Ronnie would you make your
[32:35] way up here and take
[32:38] this and then brother Ed after that if
[32:40] you would come and prepare for the
[32:44] offering how many know God's A Healer
[32:47] how many would an uplift arm say I know
[32:49] because I've I've I've been I I've I've
[32:53] had that experience he's touched me he's
[32:55] spoken to me he's helped me he's taken
[32:57] care of a situation he hasn't changed
[33:00] he's not any less in fact I believe he's
[33:02] greater now as we as we allow him to be
[33:05] more in US
[33:06] [Music]
[33:12] amen as we get ready to pray let's think
[33:14] about Sister Sarah many of you don't
[33:17] know it but she behind the scenes has
[33:19] helped so many
[33:21] people I know she's helped our family
[33:23] and I'm sure she's helped
[33:25] many and she's turned into this request
[33:28] if we could just take it to heart you
[33:30] know and and just she as we all we love
[33:33] our family and our sister we pray that
[33:36] as her request has been
[33:38] made that the Lord would meet it and
[33:41] give Comfort if it's time for her to be
[33:43] healed and she'll be healed if not
[33:45] prepare her soul for the other side but
[33:49] give the Sister Sarah the
[33:52] Comfort let's close our eyes and think
[33:55] about him

[48:46] so good to be here in the house of the
[48:47] Lord once more to just give God all the
[48:50] honor and the
[48:51] glory um walking out here and hearing
[48:55] brother Aaron sing these songs to God be
[48:58] the glory and bless the Lord I realize
[49:01] that our love is very
[49:04] uh something has to be caused for us to
[49:07] love the Lord and he said for God be the
[49:10] glory for the things that he has done
[49:13] and that's why we glorify him and then
[49:16] we begin to sing bless the Lord bless
[49:19] the Lord for the great things that he
[49:21] has done again and that's why we're here
[49:25] because I think something has happened
[49:27] in our lives and that's why we want to
[49:29] worship him that's why we thank him even
[49:32] though maybe we don't see a completion
[49:35] of of the work of God yet we know
[49:37] something has happened and that's why we
[49:39] worship him that's why we give him the
[49:42] glory because we know he has done great
[49:44] things in our life and because of all
[49:47] the good things he has done we can bless
[49:49] the Lord and um I appreciate that and
[49:52] and I love the Lord for that because if
[49:54] it wasn't for him I don't know where I
[49:56] would be he had to initiate his love to
[49:59] me in order for me to love him and I I I
[50:02] believe that's why we're all here today
[50:05] um I just want to greet you all in the
[50:07] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:10] it's just a blessing always to be here
[50:12] and just to fellowship with each and
[50:13] every one of you and fellowship within
[50:16] the worship and within the word and um I
[50:19] I just feel a sweet sweet Spirit here
[50:22] and knowing that there's people here
[50:25] grasp Asing and thirsting for eternal
[50:27] life and you know it makes um even
[50:30] though we're humans and we're nervous it
[50:32] makes things a whole lot easier because
[50:35] we know that it's not the person coming
[50:38] up here it's not the song leader it's
[50:40] not the um the beautiful songs that we
[50:43] hear but it's people that are pulling
[50:46] for God and God has to come and he comes
[50:49] through the music and he comes through
[50:50] the song leader comes through the the
[50:53] message and can speak to us and give us
[50:55] what we need so um I I'm just truly
[50:58] blessed to be here today and um I just
[51:02] want to um greet you all um brother
[51:05] Octavio made sure to tell me to greet
[51:08] the whole church greet our brother
[51:10] Daniel of course he's he's over there
[51:12] having a good time such a um needed time
[51:16] 25 years and it's just such a blessing
[51:19] that they're there and um let's just
[51:21] continue to pray for him and um he made
[51:24] sure to tell me me to make sure to greet
[51:27] each and every one of you brother Evans
[51:29] he said tell them I miss them I miss
[51:31] them dearly and tell and just greet them
[51:33] for me and um it it just shows the heart
[51:37] of of Love through him the heart of of
[51:40] God through him that that he's thinking
[51:42] about you guys even though he's in
[51:44] Paradise right now so um it's just such
[51:47] a blessing and I I'm I always appreciate
[51:49] our brother Daniel and um just for
[51:52] allowing me to be here and allow giving
[51:54] me a reason just to be around you guys
[51:56] so um let's just go straight to the
[51:59] scriptures if you like if you would like
[52:02] to turn with me to um
[52:05] Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14-
[52:11] 21 and um we're going to be reading that
[52:14] and we're also going to be reading first
[52:17] John chapter
[52:19] 4 but I I'll be a little quick on that
[52:22] one but whenever you have uh Ephesians
[52:25] 3:14 you can go ahead and say Amen just
[52:28] so that we can follow along
[52:31] this this uh whole scripture from 14 to
[52:34] 21 is is Paul's prayer to the Ephesians
[52:39] he just went and told them all of these
[52:42] things how Christ should dwell in them
[52:45] and and um the life they should live and
[52:47] how much the lord loves them and then he
[52:50] said this is my prayer to
[52:52] you and um such a beautiful prayer he
[52:57] says for this cause I bow my knees unto
[53:00] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of
[53:02] whom the whole family in Heaven and
[53:05] Earth is
[53:07] named that he would Grant to you grant
[53:10] you according to the riches of his glory
[53:12] to be strengthened with might by his
[53:15] spirit in the inner
[53:17] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[53:20] by faith I I like the way brother Paul
[53:23] speaks because we can have outward
[53:25] blessings we could have everything that
[53:27] we need but he says no you need your
[53:29] inner man strengthened and and that
[53:32] Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith
[53:35] that ye may be rooted and grounded in
[53:39] love may be able to comprehend now this
[53:43] this is a very strange text right here
[53:46] Paul is going into to science here and
[53:49] he he started to go down the three
[53:52] dimensions here he says that ye may be
[53:54] able to comprehend with all the saints
[53:57] the breadth the length the depth and the
[54:01] height and to know the love of Christ
[54:06] which passes knowledge that ye may be
[54:09] filled with the all the fullness of
[54:12] God now unto him who is able and this is
[54:17] a new word that I learned but I like it
[54:20] because you know with my bad grammar I
[54:22] use when I I have I had to write s or
[54:25] had to I would always if it was a very
[54:28] like a cold cold day I would say it was
[54:31] very cold and I was so happy and this
[54:35] was so cool and and in grammar you don't
[54:38] want to use those so much but it's I'm
[54:41] trying to regard something at its
[54:42] highest and I believe it's called if I
[54:45] don't I might butcher it but it's a
[54:47] super superlative to where it it's
[54:50] regarding something at its
[54:53] highest and I and I like it because Paul
[54:56] he uses those words he uses very and so
[55:01] even Jesus when God when he says for God
[55:03] so loved the
[55:05] world he he wanted to regard it to the
[55:09] highest and he
[55:10] says he says that you may know the love
[55:13] of Christ which passeth knowledge that
[55:15] you may F be filled with all the
[55:18] fullness of God now unto him that is
[55:21] able now he's going to use a lot of
[55:23] superlatives here that is able to do
[55:27] exceedingly abundantly above all things
[55:31] that we ask or think according to the
[55:34] power that worketh not around us not
[55:38] wherever else but in US unto him be the
[55:42] glory in the church by by J Christ Jesus
[55:45] throughout all ages World Without End
[55:51] Amen and in John well let us bow our
[55:54] heads and then we can can go to John
[55:56] Heavenly
[55:58] Father Lord your your love is just so
[56:01] great for us father something that I
[56:04] think is is
[56:07] very misinterpreted not not to just by
[56:12] us personally sometimes Lord we we don't
[56:15] truly understand your love but father
[56:18] here in these these scriptures and these
[56:20] words you are saying that ye may know
[56:24] the Love Of Christ which passees all of
[56:28] our knowledge passes all of our thinking
[56:30] but Lord you want us to know you father
[56:33] and I ask Lord that this little service
[56:35] father that this talk today Father may
[56:40] allow them to see you a little bit more
[56:42] in your love father that they may fall
[56:44] in love with you just a little bit more
[56:46] that they may go on and knowing that
[56:49] they are solid in your word and solid in
[56:52] you father I ask that you bless your
[56:54] your people father and
[56:57] Lord bless each and every person that is
[57:00] expecting father and I ask that you just
[57:01] take control of this service without you
[57:03] we are nothing Lord we ask all this in
[57:06] the precious name of Jesus Christ amen
[57:09] and amen you may be seated 1 John 4:10
[57:14] and I'm going to go all the way to 19 he
[57:16] says here in is Love Now John if you
[57:21] ever really want to know what love is
[57:24] John he knows how to explain it he he
[57:27] was called the the Apostle of love and
[57:30] and he was the one that Christ loved and
[57:33] he loved him and he laid in jesus' bosom
[57:36] but but for some reason he was bestowed
[57:38] with these words and he said This is
[57:41] Love here in is love not that we loved
[57:47] God but that he loved us and sent his
[57:50] son to be a propitiation for our sins
[57:54] and then in in verse 19 of John
[57:58] 4 1 John 4 he says we love him because
[58:03] he first loved
[58:05] us and that's my title today I love him
[58:08] because he first loved me am you know
[58:12] God's love is is not merely just um an
[58:16] emotion because you know what everybody
[58:18] needs love everybody needs love whether
[58:21] it's it's um from a husband to a wife or
[58:25] a wife to a husband or friends everybody
[58:28] needs love and everybody is seeking for
[58:30] validation and love and and something
[58:33] when they're they're in school or
[58:35] they're at work they they want to be
[58:37] loved but but God's love is not just in
[58:41] emotional love that we seek every single
[58:44] day God's love of course brother Brandon
[58:47] broke it down for us and and he went
[58:49] into the Greek and he said that love
[58:51] that we seek every single day that
[58:54] validation
[58:55] that's an ailio love that's a love a
[58:59] brotherly love that we have amongst one
[59:01] another that's a love that I have for my
[59:04] wife and my wife has for me and I have
[59:06] for my kids and my kids for me that's a
[59:09] love that us humans have for one
[59:12] another that that's something that we
[59:14] seek but but here God's love is a love
[59:19] that is a Divine
[59:21] love that passes all
[59:25] understanding the Bible says that passes
[59:27] all of our knowledge and all of our
[59:30] understanding of what we think love
[59:33] is because love AAL love brother
[59:36] brandham said that that love can be
[59:38] perverted real quick yeah and we've seen
[59:41] it many times we've seen it to where
[59:44] where somebody can love somebody so much
[59:47] that they'll they'll um kill people for
[59:51] that person they they'll love somebody
[59:54] so so much and and and it's such a
[59:57] passion within them that they'll do
[59:59] strange things and and it becomes
[1:00:02] perverted and and we all have that love
[1:00:05] and we can get angry we can fall out of
[1:00:07] love we can go back into love that is a
[1:00:10] filal love but God's love is an eternal
[1:00:14] love that is something that that passes
[1:00:17] all knowledge and it's not merely an
[1:00:19] attribute of
[1:00:21] himself so love isn't just oh he's a
[1:00:24] love in God see brother brandham said
[1:00:27] that God had attributes to be a father a
[1:00:30] savior a son a Healer a king he had
[1:00:34] attributes within himself and he wanted
[1:00:36] to express those
[1:00:38] attributes but love isn't an attribute
[1:00:41] for
[1:00:42] him John said it the best if you ever
[1:00:45] want to know the definition of who God
[1:00:49] is what God
[1:00:51] is listen to what John says he gave the
[1:00:55] best definition in verse 14 or verse I
[1:00:58] believe yeah
[1:01:00] verse um
[1:01:03] 48 he says he that loveth not knoweth
[1:01:08] not
[1:01:09] God for God is love amen so it's not
[1:01:14] merely an attribute of him it's not
[1:01:17] merely just something that he has that
[1:01:20] can be taken away or something that
[1:01:21] started but that's who he is
[1:01:25] is and that's why he had all those
[1:01:27] attributes to be a father a son a king a
[1:01:30] Healer a savior because within him was
[1:01:34] love and in love and he wanted to
[1:01:37] express his love to his people he wanted
[1:01:40] to express how much he
[1:01:43] loved we typically um love somebody when
[1:01:47] when when something is uh we find
[1:01:52] something lovable
[1:01:55] sometimes our love or we we know that
[1:01:58] our love it has a
[1:02:00] beginning our love was
[1:02:02] initiated our love can be provoked and
[1:02:05] it could be
[1:02:07] manipulated see see I didn't I wasn't
[1:02:10] born loving my
[1:02:12] wife I wasn't born loving my children I
[1:02:15] I I went and I began to initiate a
[1:02:19] conversation and we begin to be friends
[1:02:21] and we begin to talk and we we begin to
[1:02:24] like each other and she she kind of
[1:02:26] liked me but maybe I loved her before
[1:02:28] she loved me I don't know but I know
[1:02:31] that there was an initiation there to
[1:02:35] where I said well you know what I like
[1:02:37] this person even to the point that you
[1:02:39] begin to love them that's what our love
[1:02:42] is our love is
[1:02:45] initiated our love can be can Veer us
[1:02:49] off of the path sometimes be when
[1:02:51] somebody is In Love sometimes they do
[1:02:53] crazy things for
[1:02:55] love and it can be
[1:02:58] manipulated God's love never
[1:03:02] started God's love it it it originates
[1:03:06] within
[1:03:08] itself God's love is as Eternal as God
[1:03:13] is the Paul says if you can comprehend
[1:03:17] the wi the de or the width the height
[1:03:20] and the length of God's love and he said
[1:03:23] the depth also
[1:03:25] so that passes all understanding if you
[1:03:29] could understand that it goes beyond our
[1:03:31] three dimensions of length width and
[1:03:34] height but it goes into the
[1:03:37] deepness past every
[1:03:39] Dimension that's God's
[1:03:42] love God's love is not
[1:03:45] influenced God's love is as true as his
[1:03:49] own word yes prise God first John 5:3 he
[1:03:53] says for this is the love of God now
[1:03:55] he's explaining what love of God is
[1:03:58] again he says this is the love of God
[1:04:00] that we keep his
[1:04:02] Commandments and his Commandments are
[1:04:05] not
[1:04:07] Grievious so that there's a correlation
[1:04:09] with God's love and his pure
[1:04:12] unadulterated
[1:04:13] word that when this is the love of God
[1:04:16] if we can stand on the
[1:04:19] word you know a lot of times we we see
[1:04:23] many times that people people stand on
[1:04:25] the word without the love of
[1:04:28] God he says this is the love of God that
[1:04:32] we keep his Commandments and then he
[1:04:36] says and his Commandments are not
[1:04:39] Grievious we stand on the word yet we're
[1:04:43] not totally in love with the Lord what
[1:04:45] is it going to do it's going to allow us
[1:04:49] it's going to make us
[1:04:51] break nobody can what I've realized in
[1:04:54] my life is nobody can live the
[1:04:57] word nobody can live up to the word true
[1:05:01] I remember I had a buddy that just came
[1:05:03] from
[1:05:04] prison or it was I think it was jail
[1:05:07] only but he was there for quite a long
[1:05:09] time for months and and he came to me
[1:05:13] and and I took him to my house and I was
[1:05:15] telling him because I just gave my heart
[1:05:17] to the
[1:05:17] Lord and I was telling him how much God
[1:05:21] God is good and this is real and and God
[1:05:23] is he said you know what I've
[1:05:25] realized he said I read this book and
[1:05:28] usually whenever you're in jail or
[1:05:30] you're in prison you begin to read all
[1:05:32] kinds of things he said I read this book
[1:05:35] and I read that book oh yeah and I read
[1:05:37] the Bible all of it and that put me to
[1:05:40] shame because I didn't read the whole
[1:05:43] Bible but he said I read the whole thing
[1:05:46] and my realization is that nobody can
[1:05:51] live up to the
[1:05:53] Bible
[1:05:54] and for me in my ignorance I said no no
[1:05:56] no no yes you can yes you can and now
[1:05:59] that I I get older and I get older I
[1:06:01] realize nobody
[1:06:05] can us me myself I can never live up to
[1:06:09] the word of
[1:06:11] God it takes
[1:06:13] something it takes a
[1:06:16] spirit he said this is the love of God
[1:06:20] and only the way we can have the love of
[1:06:23] God Is by his only Holy
[1:06:26] Spirit and that's the only way we can
[1:06:29] stand on God's word that's the only way
[1:06:31] we can be true and faithful to
[1:06:34] God is by his holy spirit without it
[1:06:38] we're going to crack every time just
[1:06:40] like that coow hide brother bam talked
[1:06:42] about and that's in the
[1:06:44] Bible he said you put new wine every
[1:06:47] time that old coow hiide is going to
[1:06:48] break because we cannot be uh malleable
[1:06:52] to that wine to that Revelation to that
[1:06:55] word we'll never be able to we'll never
[1:06:58] be able to live up to that word but once
[1:07:00] have Christ in your
[1:07:02] life and then his word his
[1:07:06] Commandments they're not
[1:07:09] Grievous they almost become a a love
[1:07:14] chore it it becomes something that you
[1:07:16] want to do you wake up and you want to
[1:07:18] do it not that you have to do it right
[1:07:21] ah it's so hard to be a Christian
[1:07:24] oh it's so hard whenever they call me
[1:07:26] old fashion it's so hard you haven't
[1:07:30] entered into that part yet keep going
[1:07:34] you haven't entered into that place to
[1:07:37] where you could say praise God that I am
[1:07:40] reproached for my Jesus Christ praise
[1:07:43] God that I can stand on his word though
[1:07:45] the whole world uh hates me criticizes
[1:07:48] me the whole the whole world is going
[1:07:51] one way I can go against the current yes
[1:07:54] yes why because of the love of
[1:07:58] God love the God's love isn't a response
[1:08:01] to our love for
[1:08:03] him our love arises from his love for
[1:08:08] us his love doesn't rely on
[1:08:11] ours and it remains constant
[1:08:14] demonstrating The Sovereign free
[1:08:16] surprising unmatched nature of God's
[1:08:19] love God's love it doesn't need anything
[1:08:23] you know what's amazing is what you do
[1:08:26] when you
[1:08:27] backslide when you fall it doesn't move
[1:08:31] God's
[1:08:33] love God's love cannot be
[1:08:36] manipulated it cannot be
[1:08:40] provoked so no matter what the the Bible
[1:08:43] says God is love you know what that
[1:08:45] means it's been there in the
[1:08:48] beginning before the beginning it was
[1:08:52] eternal all the way way from
[1:08:54] predestination all the way to
[1:08:56] glorification God God's love has been
[1:08:58] there cuz it is it is God when you say
[1:09:03] oh the love of God you're talking about
[1:09:05] God
[1:09:07] himself so God's love he he didn't see
[1:09:10] you and see you live a good life and
[1:09:12] think oh
[1:09:13] man this brother he's going to give his
[1:09:15] heart to me and you know what I love him
[1:09:18] for
[1:09:19] that oh man he fell right here you know
[1:09:22] what I don't know I take that back
[1:09:25] no his love is a constant
[1:09:29] love his love is something that cannot
[1:09:32] be
[1:09:33] changed now the greatest one of the
[1:09:36] greatest scriptures that of the Bible
[1:09:41] that everybody knows is John
[1:09:43] 3:16 and where Jesus uses that
[1:09:46] superlative for God so loved the world
[1:09:50] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:09:52] whosoever believeth than him should not
[1:09:54] perish but have everlasting
[1:09:58] life God so loved and and um I was
[1:10:02] reading where Charles spian he he
[1:10:05] explained that word
[1:10:08] so he said God has such love in his
[1:10:11] nature that he must needs to let it flow
[1:10:14] forth to a world that is perishing by
[1:10:17] its own willful sin and when it flowed
[1:10:20] forth it was so deep so wide so strong
[1:10:25] that even inspiration could not compute
[1:10:27] its measure and therefore the spirit
[1:10:30] gave us that great little word
[1:10:34] soul and left us to attempt the
[1:10:37] measurement according as we perceive
[1:10:40] more and more the love
[1:10:43] divine he said I can't measure it it's
[1:10:48] unmeasurable Paul says that can you
[1:10:51] understand the length the width the
[1:10:53] depth the height of God's
[1:10:56] love he says can you know the love that
[1:11:00] passes knowledge now that's a
[1:11:03] contradiction there because he's saying
[1:11:06] do you know something that cannot be
[1:11:10] knowable can you know something that has
[1:11:12] passed your
[1:11:14] knowledge it's only by The Experience
[1:11:17] God gives you it's only by knowing what
[1:11:21] he did for you when he so loved the
[1:11:23] world that he got Jesus Christ and gave
[1:11:27] him to
[1:11:29] us Jesus is the expression of God's love
[1:11:32] that's why brother bandam says Christ is
[1:11:34] the mystery of God
[1:11:36] revealed everything that God was all of
[1:11:39] his attributes everything that he
[1:11:42] thought in the beginning was Jesus
[1:11:46] Christ and he was the expression when he
[1:11:49] said God so loved the world he could
[1:11:51] have said he he went and sent Angels
[1:11:54] down for God so loved the world that he
[1:11:56] made a new one or he did this no he said
[1:11:59] he sent his only begotten
[1:12:01] son he gave everything for you and I
[1:12:05] it's easy to give when we have a lot
[1:12:09] it's easy to give a penny when we have a
[1:12:12] hundred but whenever you give
[1:12:15] everything that God's expression to
[1:12:19] us one of the greatest things that I've
[1:12:21] heard brother Bram say is is always
[1:12:23] thought God was mad at me but Jesus
[1:12:26] loved
[1:12:28] me and you know what I've thought that
[1:12:30] way too reading that Old Testament
[1:12:32] you're like oof that's hard and then you
[1:12:36] start going to the New Testament you
[1:12:37] just want to be in the New Testament
[1:12:38] because it's love love
[1:12:40] love but not knowing brother Bram says
[1:12:43] that love is the very Heart Of
[1:12:48] God that that the the whole Old
[1:12:50] Testament was God bringing back his his
[1:12:53] children back to him and finally he
[1:12:56] manifested it in the name of Jesus
[1:13:00] Christ and now the very Heart Of God
[1:13:03] went and was spit on and laughed at and
[1:13:08] beaten his
[1:13:10] heart how how does it feel whenever we
[1:13:13] put our heart in the line for
[1:13:16] somebody when we break down all of our
[1:13:18] barriers for this
[1:13:20] person knowing that that now my heart my
[1:13:26] love is in their
[1:13:28] hands I I've built all of these walls
[1:13:31] over the years so nobody hurts me I
[1:13:34] built everything so that nobody can
[1:13:36] attack my heart my love my affection but
[1:13:40] then you break everything down for
[1:13:42] somebody and you say here you go it's
[1:13:46] yours and then for that person to to
[1:13:49] disregard
[1:13:50] it for that person to laugh at it and
[1:13:54] and to to think of it as nothing what a
[1:13:58] what a
[1:13:59] heartbreak what a hurtful thing it
[1:14:02] is that's what Jesus did for
[1:14:06] us Jesus was the very heart of God and
[1:14:10] people laughed at him people didn't
[1:14:13] believe him and to the point to where he
[1:14:16] died on the cross for you and I but he
[1:14:21] didn't go there ignorantly
[1:14:24] he went there knowing there was going to
[1:14:26] be people here
[1:14:27] today people here today that was going
[1:14:30] to regard God's love and say Lord I'm
[1:14:34] lost Lord I have no other place to
[1:14:38] go Lord I I'm dying in
[1:14:41] sickness Lord my family is is in
[1:14:46] shambles you can come to the feet of
[1:14:49] Jesus and
[1:14:50] Jesus the very heart of God can take
[1:14:54] that sin can take your family can take
[1:14:56] that sickness and make it
[1:14:59] whole for God so loved the world
[1:15:02] Christ's Mission about God's love it
[1:15:05] recognizes and overcomes our sin that's
[1:15:09] what Christ's mission
[1:15:12] was it was so that so that he could
[1:15:16] recognize our
[1:15:18] sin to think of
[1:15:20] God's God that to think that God is
[1:15:23] indifferent to someone's life whether
[1:15:26] it's evil or it's virtuous that's a
[1:15:28] misunderstanding of God's love many
[1:15:31] people say well God loves me either way
[1:15:34] well God is love and and they're living
[1:15:36] in
[1:15:37] sin well God loves God
[1:15:40] loves yeah he does because the Bible
[1:15:42] says for God so Lov he didn't say the
[1:15:44] elect
[1:15:45] only he said the whole
[1:15:49] world so yes he does love he does Love
[1:15:53] The Sinner out there he does love the
[1:15:56] hypocrite he does love the backslider he
[1:15:59] does love the perfect one he loves
[1:16:02] everybody even the Young Rich ruler that
[1:16:05] turned him down Jesus looked at him and
[1:16:07] loved him the Bible
[1:16:09] says so yes God
[1:16:12] loves but the reason why he sent Christ
[1:16:16] because there was a problem between us
[1:16:18] and
[1:16:19] sin that it took us took us out of the
[1:16:23] of God and put us into a path that is
[1:16:26] nothing but judgment and
[1:16:29] wrath and now every single person that
[1:16:32] is born of this world is going to that
[1:16:36] judgment that is going to that wrath
[1:16:39] because somebody chose not to obey
[1:16:42] him so what Jesus did because God so
[1:16:46] loved the world he brought Jesus Christ
[1:16:49] and he says you know what I'll pay it
[1:16:52] I'll pay the the price I'll do anything
[1:16:54] that I can so that they don't have to
[1:16:56] die that's what God's love is it's not
[1:17:00] so that we can continue in our sin it's
[1:17:03] not so that we can say oh God loves me
[1:17:05] and continue on it's so that he could
[1:17:07] take us out of our sin take us out of
[1:17:11] our
[1:17:12] unbelief because for God so loved the
[1:17:14] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:17:16] that whosoever that's
[1:17:19] me that's
[1:17:21] you whosoever ever that's the
[1:17:24] elect whosoever believeth shall not
[1:17:28] perish but have everlasting
[1:17:30] life Paul says that you may be able to
[1:17:34] comprehend his love how can we
[1:17:36] comprehend it he says that the
[1:17:40] comprehended with the the length the
[1:17:42] width the depth the
[1:17:44] height that that God he even he he his
[1:17:48] whole motive of love he created those
[1:17:50] three dimensions so that he could enter
[1:17:52] into that
[1:17:54] length width depth and
[1:17:58] height so that we can know his
[1:18:01] love and I ask myself well how do we
[1:18:04] know the fullness of God how do we know
[1:18:06] his love and it's in Romans 55 it says
[1:18:10] and hope does not put us to
[1:18:13] shame because God's love has been poured
[1:18:16] into our hearts through the Holy Spirit
[1:18:20] who has been given to us that's how you
[1:18:23] begin to know God's love any other way
[1:18:28] brothers and sisters we we can never
[1:18:30] comprehend
[1:18:31] God what I've realized in my life I can
[1:18:34] never love God the way I really want to
[1:18:37] just like I said I can never follow his
[1:18:40] word I can never love the Lord with my
[1:18:43] ailio
[1:18:44] love that's what brother brandham says
[1:18:46] there's people in the mountaintops then
[1:18:48] the valley then the mountain tops
[1:18:50] they're happy then they're sad they love
[1:18:51] the Lord then they hate him
[1:18:54] why because we're we're trying to love
[1:18:56] him with our human
[1:18:57] love the thing is God understands
[1:19:01] that God understands that we are
[1:19:05] incapable that we are
[1:19:08] insufficient that there is no way we can
[1:19:11] love God the way he needs to be
[1:19:15] loved I I um was thinking about all of
[1:19:19] this and and I came across the story of
[1:19:22] Hosea and
[1:19:24] goer and I realized that that Goomer is
[1:19:29] me I does anybody know that
[1:19:32] story where
[1:19:34] God was having a terrible time with
[1:19:38] Israel and God brought this righteous
[1:19:41] man named
[1:19:43] Hosea and he said Hosea you your life is
[1:19:47] going to be a
[1:19:49] prophecy everything that you go through
[1:19:52] is what I'm going through with Israel
[1:19:54] with my
[1:19:56] people so Hosea a young man he says okay
[1:20:00] God whatever you want me to do he says
[1:20:01] yes I want you to go and marry a woman
[1:20:05] praise
[1:20:06] God praise God I've been in the ministry
[1:20:09] and I've been I've been um serving the
[1:20:11] lord as much as I can and and now God
[1:20:14] wants me to marry a woman yes I can go
[1:20:18] to the church oh I already know her name
[1:20:21] I've been talking to her and God say
[1:20:22] says
[1:20:23] no you're going to have to go to the bad
[1:20:26] side of
[1:20:28] town you're going to have to go to the
[1:20:30] bad
[1:20:31] places and find yourself a
[1:20:35] harlot he says
[1:20:37] what he say no no no no no no Lord I
[1:20:40] don't want to do that I don't want to do
[1:20:43] that he says no you are going to be a
[1:20:45] picture of what I go through with the
[1:20:48] unconverted
[1:20:50] heart with what I go through with my the
[1:20:53] children of
[1:20:55] Israel and what he goes through with us
[1:20:58] when we don't have the Holy
[1:21:01] Spirit he says I'm going to you're going
[1:21:03] to be the perfect picture of my undying
[1:21:07] love my Redemption
[1:21:10] story so he finds this woman her name
[1:21:13] was
[1:21:15] Goomer and this woman she she she was in
[1:21:18] the bad side of town she was raised uh
[1:21:21] in horri
[1:21:25] she didn't know anything about a good
[1:21:28] home she didn't know anything about
[1:21:30] God's love she didn't know anything
[1:21:33] about a prayer life she didn't know
[1:21:37] anything about goodness and
[1:21:39] love that was us when we were born we
[1:21:44] didn't know anything the Bible says we
[1:21:47] were in enmity towards God we were
[1:21:51] enemies we didn't know anything about
[1:21:54] God that's who she
[1:21:57] was and this man been saving himself for
[1:22:00] a good wife and God says no you are
[1:22:02] going to be my
[1:22:05] prophecy and and he went and he took her
[1:22:08] not to use her like every other man does
[1:22:11] like the world
[1:22:13] does but he had to go and make her a
[1:22:16] wife to
[1:22:18] him make her and not just make her a
[1:22:22] wife but he had to love her because he
[1:22:24] says you're going to be just like me and
[1:22:26] I love Israel even though they they deal
[1:22:30] treacherously with me you're going to
[1:22:33] have to love
[1:22:38] her she she was not what he
[1:22:43] thought his wife was going to
[1:22:46] be she she didn't know how to
[1:22:51] be
[1:22:53] loved or how to
[1:22:55] love she couldn't comprehend it that's
[1:22:58] not what she was raised
[1:23:01] by she didn't know how to to love him
[1:23:04] and and to be all of that that she
[1:23:06] needed to be but for something for some
[1:23:10] reason in her she said
[1:23:13] yes I I need to I I don't want to
[1:23:16] continue to live the way I
[1:23:18] live I can't continue to to live in
[1:23:23] sin that's why we made our
[1:23:26] step that's why we've
[1:23:29] accepted because we can't continue even
[1:23:32] though our life may seem
[1:23:35] righteous yet we're born in sin and our
[1:23:39] own self-righteousness can become our
[1:23:43] sin our own uh I've never done this and
[1:23:46] I've never done can be our own
[1:23:49] sin so we're all Goomer
[1:23:53] we're all unworthy but yet by God's
[1:23:56] grace God told him to marry
[1:24:00] her not just to just to marry her but to
[1:24:03] love her this was something that she
[1:24:06] wasn't used to this is something that
[1:24:09] she wasn't
[1:24:10] accustomed other men would use her
[1:24:13] that's what she was comfortable
[1:24:15] with but
[1:24:17] love see we're used to all of these
[1:24:20] things of the world we're used to
[1:24:21] everything like this but when it comes
[1:24:24] down to love undying
[1:24:27] love I don't know and even though she
[1:24:30] said yes in her lips her heart her mind
[1:24:35] she was still
[1:24:38] Harlot she still had that in us and and
[1:24:42] brother Bram says this statement in the
[1:24:45] message of
[1:24:47] Pride it's very hard statement but he's
[1:24:49] talking about this woman that that
[1:24:51] washed Jesus his feet we know what she
[1:24:55] was she was a harlot she was a
[1:24:57] prostitute and and and and then brother
[1:25:00] brandham says he says you say brother
[1:25:02] brandham I'm no
[1:25:04] prostitute he says I don't altogether
[1:25:07] mean sexually but prostitution on a
[1:25:09] higher
[1:25:10] level you can prostitute your
[1:25:13] time how much time do you give him
[1:25:17] prostitute your own selfish motives
[1:25:20] going and saying going around and saying
[1:25:22] well I belong to this church I'm better
[1:25:24] you're not you can prostitute otherwise
[1:25:27] and sexually the holy spirit will speak
[1:25:29] to your heart and you'll say I don't
[1:25:31] want nothing to do with
[1:25:34] that and there there's a another
[1:25:38] definition we already know all the
[1:25:40] definitions of that word but there's one
[1:25:42] that says to devote yourself to corrupt
[1:25:45] or unworthy
[1:25:48] purposes and and sometimes God he will
[1:25:51] pull us out
[1:25:52] of the myy clay and we could sing that
[1:25:54] song he brought me out of the myy clay
[1:25:59] but it's still in
[1:26:01] us he says when justification he pulls
[1:26:05] the cup out of the
[1:26:07] farmyard but it's still
[1:26:11] dirty he Hosea took her from a life of
[1:26:15] worthlessness and brought her into
[1:26:18] worthiness he saved her from filth and
[1:26:21] moved her into to a house of
[1:26:24] blessings and there she
[1:26:27] was praise God I'm
[1:26:30] saved there she is in church praise God
[1:26:34] he he justified me praise God he he did
[1:26:37] something he pulled me out she was
[1:26:40] there she didn't have to live a life the
[1:26:43] way she used to
[1:26:45] live she made it she's under the care of
[1:26:48] the Prophet her
[1:26:51] husband
[1:26:53] but her mind was somewhere
[1:26:55] else we can come to church we can praise
[1:26:57] the
[1:26:58] Lord participate in church related
[1:27:01] things but where are
[1:27:05] you where are
[1:27:07] we we can be here physically but where
[1:27:10] are
[1:27:12] we is it possible that two people can
[1:27:15] live in us at one
[1:27:18] time is it possible the Bible says that
[1:27:20] a double-minded man is unstable in his
[1:27:24] all of his
[1:27:25] ways if you look into that scripture in
[1:27:29] in the Greek it's a two-spirited man it
[1:27:34] says you're you're here and you're
[1:27:37] there and you love God but but you can't
[1:27:40] get just let loose of the things of the
[1:27:44] world brother brand says that's the most
[1:27:47] miserable place to be in it
[1:27:50] is you're we're only hurting ourselves
[1:27:53] we're only hurting ourselves when we're
[1:27:55] in that
[1:27:57] position when when we can't allow God's
[1:28:00] love to just overflow us but yet yet we
[1:28:04] don't allow the S Satan to take us all
[1:28:07] the way we say no no no I'm a
[1:28:11] Christian but we could be in here but
[1:28:15] that's not where we really
[1:28:17] are Hebrews 12:1 it says to lay aside
[1:28:20] every weight
[1:28:23] and the sin which do so easily beset us
[1:28:27] and let us run with patience the race
[1:28:29] that is set before us we have to break
[1:28:32] all of those
[1:28:34] things and and and sometimes we're stuck
[1:28:37] on what we were before Jesus took us
[1:28:41] out like I said we we sing that song he
[1:28:44] took me out of the my clay but then we
[1:28:47] romanticize of the of our
[1:28:50] past we still think of the good old
[1:28:53] days we still we're still back in those
[1:28:56] times and we're still linked to those
[1:29:00] things Hosea took her out of that
[1:29:04] situation but that situation wasn't out
[1:29:06] of
[1:29:07] her and he took her and let's say that
[1:29:11] they became happy
[1:29:13] together she was happy with
[1:29:16] him she began to do what she was
[1:29:19] supposed to
[1:29:20] do and she began to be comfortable in
[1:29:23] that
[1:29:25] area and maybe the early days of their
[1:29:28] marriage were beautiful as as his love
[1:29:31] began to
[1:29:33] Blossom and and and and her love
[1:29:36] somewhat she she had an idea of it
[1:29:40] somewhat she she knew how to love him
[1:29:44] with a pure
[1:29:47] heart God blessed them God gave them a
[1:29:51] son
[1:29:53] she was a mother she was living the
[1:29:57] life we were praising the Lord we're
[1:30:00] coming to church we're doing what we're
[1:30:01] supposed to
[1:30:04] do Goomer it means completed that's her
[1:30:10] name brother she was the most incomplete
[1:30:12] person
[1:30:13] there but her name was
[1:30:17] completed and I know that she thought
[1:30:19] about herself when she would think about
[1:30:22] herself even though she had the nice
[1:30:25] dress she she looked like a a housewife
[1:30:28] she looked like like
[1:30:31] hosea's wife now now Hosea wasn't just
[1:30:34] any normal
[1:30:36] man he was the man of the
[1:30:40] hour he was the man probably the most
[1:30:44] famous man in
[1:30:46] Israel preaching the
[1:30:49] word preaching repent repent God is
[1:30:55] coming she was there following she was
[1:30:59] there doing what she was supposed to
[1:31:02] do but yet in within herself she knew
[1:31:06] she wasn't
[1:31:07] complete she knew she she wasn't where
[1:31:11] she supposed to be she was supposed to
[1:31:14] be but when God sees you I I want you to
[1:31:18] understand and I I spoke this last time
[1:31:21] of of God put everything within you
[1:31:26] already he predestinated you meaning
[1:31:29] that he put your beginning and your end
[1:31:32] within
[1:31:33] you and when God sees you he sees you as
[1:31:37] a finished
[1:31:38] work no matter if we feel
[1:31:42] incomplete Hosea didn't see her as a
[1:31:44] harlot
[1:31:45] anymore maybe people would try to remind
[1:31:48] her of who she was but her own husband
[1:31:51] his eyes was fixed on his
[1:31:54] wife that was his wife the mother of his
[1:32:01] child then they had another child his
[1:32:04] name was jezel and and it seems like
[1:32:07] like Hosea begins to notice a change in
[1:32:13] Gomer she begin to be restless and
[1:32:17] unhappy this Christian Life is is you
[1:32:21] know know you you need to be careful
[1:32:23] before you say yes to the Lord make sure
[1:32:26] you know what what you're going into but
[1:32:29] I want you to understand that this is
[1:32:31] the greatest
[1:32:33] decision for those that that are are
[1:32:36] Teeter tottering on on making that
[1:32:38] decision this is the greatest decision
[1:32:41] you can ever
[1:32:43] make it's the only Eternal
[1:32:46] decision brothers sisters we we make so
[1:32:49] many decisions of life I always joke
[1:32:52] around of what kind of Starbucks do we
[1:32:55] want
[1:32:56] today what where do we want to go
[1:33:00] today what what sucks the white or the
[1:33:03] black
[1:33:04] ones what tie this one or that one we
[1:33:07] have so many decisions but the greatest
[1:33:09] decision you can ever make in your life
[1:33:12] is
[1:33:15] Christ she made that
[1:33:19] decision but she began to see her
[1:33:22] surroundings and and and within her she
[1:33:25] began to be
[1:33:29] restless kind of like a bird in a cage
[1:33:31] she she she didn't know what to
[1:33:34] do and he continued on he went preaching
[1:33:38] he encouraged the Wayward Nation turn
[1:33:41] from their sin and trust God for
[1:33:43] deliverance from the threat of
[1:33:45] surrounding
[1:33:46] Nations return to the Lord was the theme
[1:33:49] of his
[1:33:50] message he preached it repeatedly and
[1:33:53] repeatedly with
[1:33:56] power but Goomer seemed less and less
[1:34:00] interested in his
[1:34:03] ministry in fact that she may have grown
[1:34:06] to resent
[1:34:08] it she probably even accused Hosea of
[1:34:12] thinking more about preaching than he
[1:34:15] did of
[1:34:17] her she began to find other interests to
[1:34:20] occupy herself and spent more time away
[1:34:24] from
[1:34:28] home she only had a shallow
[1:34:31] understanding of what true love
[1:34:34] was she was not capable of truly loving
[1:34:38] him she didn't know how
[1:34:41] to she maybe lived in in she didn't have
[1:34:44] no parents she who knows what her life
[1:34:47] was brother bam says if you always see a
[1:34:50] wayward woman it's because something
[1:34:52] happened to
[1:34:54] her maybe a man led her
[1:34:57] astray maybe it was her own father who
[1:35:00] knows what it was but but something
[1:35:03] changed her to do those things to give
[1:35:07] up on love and to give up on all all the
[1:35:10] things that are
[1:35:12] good that's why a lot of times we'd
[1:35:15] rather be in the
[1:35:17] world we'd rather because that's our
[1:35:20] comfort zone
[1:35:22] we'd rather smoke we'd rather drink we'd
[1:35:24] rather cuss and and be just like
[1:35:26] everybody because it's
[1:35:28] easier than this narrow way this narrow
[1:35:32] way is not easy but it has an eternal
[1:35:35] reward behind
[1:35:37] it it has somebody that truly loves us
[1:35:41] not emotionally not something that's
[1:35:43] going to to fade away
[1:35:45] tomorrow not an abusive love not not
[1:35:48] just to
[1:35:50] to mess us up in the end but a love
[1:35:53] that's going to take us from our
[1:35:55] condition all the way to
[1:35:57] Eternity that's our Hosea that's Jesus
[1:36:03] Christ she didn't understand and and I
[1:36:06] begin to remember the story about
[1:36:10] Peter when when Peter he already denied
[1:36:14] Jesus
[1:36:16] Christ he messed up after three times
[1:36:21] he he he denied him and Jesus he was
[1:36:25] there crucified and and and he raised up
[1:36:29] the third day and Peter was there found
[1:36:33] fishing and finally Jesus goes back to
[1:36:38] him to a defeated Peter to a defeated
[1:36:43] man he was the one that says Lord I'll
[1:36:46] die for
[1:36:47] you he was the one that says even though
[1:36:50] they they reject you I
[1:36:52] won't he was the one that was telling
[1:36:55] him Lord I I'll go to you and get off of
[1:36:59] the boat that was Peter that was nobody
[1:37:03] else he told them he affirmed his love
[1:37:05] to Jesus but in the end of the day he
[1:37:08] could not do
[1:37:10] it he could not love God the way he
[1:37:13] wanted to even though Peter's love was
[1:37:17] sincere even though it was with all of
[1:37:19] his heart in the end of the day
[1:37:21] we cannot love God the way we want to
[1:37:24] with this
[1:37:25] flesh with my own mind it's past my
[1:37:29] knowledge past my
[1:37:33] understanding and so he goes and and
[1:37:36] they finish eating I I love that every
[1:37:39] time Jesus he's in his glorified body
[1:37:42] he's eating I love it and then he was it
[1:37:45] was after fishing they were eating fish
[1:37:48] I'm like praise God this is this is my
[1:37:50] heaven right here
[1:37:51] they just barely finished eating they
[1:37:54] got the glorified Jesus right next to
[1:37:56] them and they oh man
[1:37:58] beautiful but they just finished eating
[1:38:00] and and he began to ask Peter this
[1:38:02] question and I'm sure you all know
[1:38:05] this but he asked him do you love me
[1:38:08] Peter
[1:38:09] yes he he actually reverted back to his
[1:38:13] old
[1:38:14] name he said
[1:38:17] Simon see Peter Peter was the man with
[1:38:20] revelation
[1:38:22] Peter was the man that who knew Jesus
[1:38:25] Christ but he reverted back to
[1:38:29] Simon he says Simon do you love me more
[1:38:32] than all of
[1:38:33] these maybe he saw his beautiful fishing
[1:38:38] boat all of the fish around all of his
[1:38:41] buddies and said do you love me more
[1:38:42] than
[1:38:43] these Peter says yes I love
[1:38:47] you maybe when Jesus said that he said
[1:38:50] do you love me more more than these
[1:38:52] disciples love
[1:38:54] me he says yes I love
[1:38:58] you but when Jesus asked him
[1:39:01] that he used
[1:39:05] Agape he says Agape do you love me Peter
[1:39:09] do you love me
[1:39:10] Simon and when when Peter he turned to
[1:39:14] him he says yes ailio I love
[1:39:19] you I said he he he says I love you as
[1:39:23] much as I can
[1:39:26] Lord he okay feed my sheep feed my
[1:39:30] Lambs he says do you love me Peter
[1:39:33] Peter's like he just asked me
[1:39:36] this Simon do you love me
[1:39:39] yes do you love me agapit yes ailio yes
[1:39:44] I love
[1:39:46] you he couldn't comprehend God's
[1:39:50] love he couldn't go up to Jesus's
[1:39:54] level when Jesus was asking him about a
[1:39:57] greater
[1:39:59] love a love that's not going to deny
[1:40:02] him of love that's not going to cow away
[1:40:05] when when push comes to
[1:40:08] shove it's a love that will die and
[1:40:11] suffer and sacrifice their life for
[1:40:14] him do you love me
[1:40:16] Peter I love you as much as I can
[1:40:19] Lord
[1:40:22] and Jesus
[1:40:26] knowing knowing that he was incapable of
[1:40:30] God's
[1:40:31] love he went to his level and the third
[1:40:34] time he says ailio he says do you love
[1:40:37] me
[1:40:39] aelio and Peter's like Lord you know all
[1:40:43] things you know my heart you know
[1:40:45] everything about me I love you
[1:40:48] ailio yes he says okay then feed my
[1:40:51] sheep amen Jesus had to go to the level
[1:40:55] of
[1:40:57] Peter even regarding him as Simon
[1:41:00] knowing that his nature wasn't changed
[1:41:03] yet and he and that's when he began to
[1:41:05] tell him you're going to suffer many
[1:41:06] things for
[1:41:08] me you're not going to live the way you
[1:41:10] want to live
[1:41:13] anymore and Peter as much as he could in
[1:41:17] his human love did everything he could
[1:41:19] to show him because he said Lord you
[1:41:22] know my heart so Peter wasn't a
[1:41:24] hypocrite Peter Peter wasn't trying to
[1:41:27] put on he knew who he was standing in
[1:41:31] front of and a lot of times when when
[1:41:33] our nature isn't changed we could tell
[1:41:36] the Lord face to face Lord I love
[1:41:40] you people might say Well then why do
[1:41:42] you keep
[1:41:43] sinning why do you keep cing away when
[1:41:46] it's time to step up why do you keep
[1:41:50] reverting back to your old
[1:41:52] ways and maybe people might see a
[1:41:55] hypocrite or a backslider but God sees
[1:41:58] somebody that truly loves him but just
[1:42:02] is not capable of loving him the way he
[1:42:04] needs to be
[1:42:07] loved Peter showed everything he showed
[1:42:10] all of his colors and says Lord I love
[1:42:12] you but it took the day of
[1:42:17] Pentecost he says when you're converted
[1:42:20] Peter
[1:42:21] he says there's going to be a day you're
[1:42:23] going to sacrifice he he was telling him
[1:42:25] of another Peter he was talking to him
[1:42:28] of another man that was going to stand
[1:42:30] for
[1:42:31] him and finally when they were in the
[1:42:34] upper room scared scared of reproach
[1:42:37] scared because their savior just died
[1:42:40] and he resurrected and now people are
[1:42:42] are looking because the tomb is empty
[1:42:45] people are looking for the disciples
[1:42:46] looking for
[1:42:48] Jesus they were scared
[1:42:51] but when the Holy
[1:42:53] Spirit God's Own love entered into their
[1:42:56] heart Peter stepped down there Peter
[1:43:00] wasn't afraid anymore he wasn't afraid
[1:43:03] of this little girl that says oh you're
[1:43:06] you're the that man of Galilee even to
[1:43:08] the point to where he cussed at
[1:43:11] her he wasn't scared of it no more maybe
[1:43:14] there was hundreds of people but the
[1:43:16] Bible says when he stomped out of that
[1:43:18] Upper Room there was thousands
[1:43:21] yes and he got up on Top of the
[1:43:24] Rock saying this is this that Joel
[1:43:27] preached
[1:43:29] about this is what he was talking about
[1:43:32] that in the last days I shall pour my
[1:43:34] spirit amongst his
[1:43:36] people man what a
[1:43:40] difference then he could then whenever
[1:43:42] they were crucifying him they were going
[1:43:44] to kill him for the cause of Jesus he
[1:43:46] says I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to
[1:43:50] die like my Lord turn me upside
[1:43:53] down what a
[1:43:56] love what a
[1:44:01] love so
[1:44:06] scripture uh
[1:44:08] doesn't give us the details of the
[1:44:11] situation in home so I'm dramatizing
[1:44:14] goomer's
[1:44:15] story just have a few more
[1:44:19] minutes
[1:44:21] but we don't know what was going on but
[1:44:24] we it shows that her unfaithfulness
[1:44:27] begin to
[1:44:30] unravel that when she had her other
[1:44:33] child his name was L luru hamama which
[1:44:37] means unpitied and
[1:44:41] unloved her third child was loami which
[1:44:45] means not my
[1:44:49] people if it was it wasn't his children
[1:44:54] anymore she went out and as she was
[1:44:56] occupying
[1:44:58] herself somewhere else she might have
[1:45:01] found somebody else and reverted back to
[1:45:03] her old
[1:45:06] ways and committed adultery and her own
[1:45:10] children wasn't his
[1:45:14] anymore and you could see in Chapter 2
[1:45:17] how how God through Hosea begin to blead
[1:45:21] with
[1:45:23] Goomer and and and and cry out to them
[1:45:27] see it's not easy this is a harsh
[1:45:30] statement but it's not easy to go to
[1:45:32] hell brother Brown says he says we fight
[1:45:36] our way to
[1:45:38] hell we break through every barricade
[1:45:41] that God
[1:45:43] has we break through everything God even
[1:45:46] even we break through the barricade of
[1:45:48] our our parents' prayers of the pastor's
[1:45:52] preachings of of the spirit that you
[1:45:54] feel and and the convictions you feel we
[1:45:57] break through everything we break and we
[1:45:59] break and that's what Goomer was
[1:46:02] doing we see we we see that that um that
[1:46:07] he begins to prophesy and and he needed
[1:46:10] her but then he threatened to disher her
[1:46:14] in verse three but still she ran off
[1:46:17] with lovers because they promised to
[1:46:19] Lavish her with material that was verse
[1:46:23] four verse 5 he he tries to stop her on
[1:46:27] one of occasions one
[1:46:29] occasion six Hosea says I'll take her
[1:46:33] back I'll take you back
[1:46:36] again and she would come back but her
[1:46:39] repentance would be
[1:46:41] shortlived and soon she would run off
[1:46:44] with somebody
[1:46:46] again and
[1:46:47] finally she got to a point where she
[1:46:51] left for
[1:46:54] good she left for good and I wonder if
[1:46:57] if hoseah here with now these
[1:47:00] children children that weren't even
[1:47:04] his children that he had to take care of
[1:47:08] now he has to take care of them and
[1:47:11] maybe I don't know if it was a sigh of
[1:47:13] relief I don't know if he cried every
[1:47:16] night for her I don't know what it
[1:47:19] was but but God told him he says go
[1:47:25] back go back and find the woman that is
[1:47:29] loved of
[1:47:30] another go back and marry her
[1:47:34] again all everything that he went
[1:47:36] through everything that she did all of
[1:47:39] her
[1:47:40] unfaithfulness but God was showing his
[1:47:43] grace and his love for his
[1:47:47] people sometimes we think that our
[1:47:49] little action are going to disrupt God's
[1:47:52] love for us it's
[1:47:54] impossible brother you don't know how
[1:47:56] aggressive God's love is it's this it's
[1:47:59] not this beautiful little heart that we
[1:48:01] see in Valentine's Day it's not this
[1:48:04] lovey-dovey thing God's love is
[1:48:07] aggressive the Bible says that love
[1:48:10] casts out
[1:48:11] fear that doesn't mean he come on get
[1:48:14] out of here please no casting out is
[1:48:18] just like the same word that Michael did
[1:48:22] to Satan in the
[1:48:23] beginning it casts out things in our
[1:48:27] lives love is
[1:48:30] aggressive and and and and he said go
[1:48:34] and find her and he began to look
[1:48:37] Brothers we are incapable of loving God
[1:48:40] seeking him believing his word keeping
[1:48:42] his word we're incapable of it all so
[1:48:45] God comes down and looks for us just
[1:48:48] like he did with Adam when Adam sinned
[1:48:51] he should have been this one that says
[1:48:53] Lord where are you I messed up no he
[1:48:55] started to hide that's our nature when
[1:48:58] we fall we sin we we begin to hide and
[1:49:02] it's God saying Adam Adam where are
[1:49:05] you it's God's grace it's the Bible says
[1:49:09] no man can come to me except the father
[1:49:11] draws
[1:49:13] him and I will raise him up in the last
[1:49:16] day no man can come to me no man can can
[1:49:19] cry out to the Lord I'm the one that is
[1:49:21] seeking for you I'm the one that loves
[1:49:24] you more than you can ever love me and
[1:49:27] and and he began to go and as she left
[1:49:30] for
[1:49:31] good he he went and began to go into the
[1:49:35] bad places again Jesus went all the way
[1:49:38] to hell for us he went all the way to
[1:49:42] the bad places how
[1:49:45] embarrassing the man of the
[1:49:48] hour the man that is has been preaching
[1:49:51] this message the man that that has been
[1:49:56] showing God through his messages having
[1:49:59] to go into that
[1:50:02] place
[1:50:04] Hosea have you seen my wife have you
[1:50:07] seen her where is
[1:50:10] she where's she
[1:50:13] at I know I know she wants to be out
[1:50:17] here but but she's my wife
[1:50:20] amen and finally when when he goes he
[1:50:24] looked at the grocery store he looked at
[1:50:26] at this place he looked over here
[1:50:29] but he went and he went to the slave
[1:50:33] markets and there she was being
[1:50:35] auctioned to the highest
[1:50:37] bidder back to the same
[1:50:42] condition and when he looked at her he
[1:50:44] said that's that's my wife that's my
[1:50:49] bride
[1:50:50] that's that's them I love
[1:50:54] them and he went probably to that person
[1:50:56] he said sir sir that's my wife right
[1:50:59] there I don't care who she is to
[1:51:03] you I don't care if whatever she is to
[1:51:06] you you have to pay this
[1:51:09] much you have to pay the
[1:51:12] price and maybe when she saw him she was
[1:51:15] full of Shame saying like how why did he
[1:51:18] come back
[1:51:21] I'm comfortable in my situation I'm
[1:51:23] comfortable in my
[1:51:24] sin I know where I'm going to go but I
[1:51:27] don't know anything else I don't know H
[1:51:30] H how to be a Christian I don't know how
[1:51:32] to do these things but he'll come back
[1:51:35] for
[1:51:36] you he'll come
[1:51:38] back and and was she was there wondering
[1:51:42] why he was there he he says I'll pay
[1:51:45] whatever it is he says it's 15
[1:51:48] shekels it's it's everything that you
[1:51:51] have and he says take it
[1:51:54] all take
[1:51:56] everything that's my
[1:51:59] wife that's my
[1:52:01] child that's my
[1:52:04] people and and he paid everything he
[1:52:07] could so he can buy her back and
[1:52:10] whenever he bought her back he renewed
[1:52:13] his vows back to her the Bible says he
[1:52:15] says you're going to stay with me many
[1:52:18] days you're never going to play the
[1:52:20] Harlot
[1:52:21] anymore you're going to be my wife I'm
[1:52:24] going to be your
[1:52:26] husband no matter what that's God's love
[1:52:29] to
[1:52:30] us when we were in sin when we tried to
[1:52:33] play religious when we tried to do all
[1:52:35] of these things God's love it's it's
[1:52:38] aggressive love to where he'll bring us
[1:52:41] back and he'll say you'll no more do
[1:52:43] those
[1:52:44] things you'll no more sin I'm going to
[1:52:47] put my spirit in you so that you can be
[1:52:49] in Overcomer amen so that you can love
[1:52:53] me
[1:52:55] properly let us stand to our
[1:52:59] feet that's what I want I want more of
[1:53:03] God's
[1:53:05] love I want God's love to be shed not
[1:53:08] only around me not all of the blessings
[1:53:12] see she knew all the
[1:53:14] blessings she knew she she tasted the
[1:53:17] feeling of being a housewife tasted the
[1:53:19] feeling of good food and always always
[1:53:22] having a warm place to stay we know
[1:53:24] those outward
[1:53:26] blessings but the Bible says that his
[1:53:28] love will be shed abroad in our
[1:53:32] hearts I don't want just outward
[1:53:35] blessings

[1:53:47] to love him but not knowing how because
[1:53:49] I S sin because of my habit because of
[1:53:51] the little secret sins that that only he
[1:53:56] knows

[1:54:35] healings by by by seeing your nature
