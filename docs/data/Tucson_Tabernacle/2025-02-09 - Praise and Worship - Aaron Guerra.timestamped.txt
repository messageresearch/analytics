[30:46] hope you sent me a copy and I think a
[30:47] few others sent me a copy of this it's
[30:49] it's really neat so this is a
[30:51] advertisement of brother brandom at The
[30:53] Friendly Church look at the address
[31:00] that's a Tucson Tabernacle he preached
[31:03] from this very pulpit in this very
[31:06] building and uh this this was just a few
[31:08] days ago I think brother Lyle did you
[31:10] mention uh it was the anniversary of him
[31:13] preaching that I'm not I'm not sure
[31:15] brother Jordan did okay yeah put that
[31:17] back up there there there was two adver
[31:19] advertisements there this was originally
[31:21] Assemblies of God and uh it um I was
[31:25] just proud of it when uh when it came up
[31:29] and and the Breen and sister started
[31:31] sending it to me really
[31:34] nice yes behind this very this very
[31:37] Pulpit right
[31:38] here so anyways I thought uh I thought
[31:41] you'd enjoy seeing that and when I
[31:43] looked at the address I said
[31:46] yeah that's great I believe it was in
[31:49] was it in
[31:51] 1961 I believe and it was two sermons it
[31:54] was a Sunday morning and Sunday
[31:56] evening and uh brother brandom if if you
[31:59] know brother brandom and if you listen
[32:01] to a lot of his
[32:03] sermons you just you get to know his
[32:06] tone of voice and you get to know just
[32:09] his
[32:11] personality and you could see you could
[32:13] hear in his tone that brother Brandon
[32:15] was frustrated as he was
[32:17] ministering and he couldn't he couldn't
[32:20] get the people to respond and um he uh
[32:23] brother
[32:24] Aaron I'm sorry to put you on the spot
[32:27] can you give the test testimony better
[32:28] than I of what happened and just come on
[32:31] up here so it's on the
[32:33] microphone um so brother brandom as I
[32:36] said if you listen to the sermons
[32:39] it he uh couldn't get the people to
[32:43] respond and if you know him you know his
[32:46] tone of voice you can hear there's
[32:48] there's something a little bit off and
[32:50] then brother Aaron has the testimony of
[32:52] what happened after that service and
[32:54] then I will follow up with brother Aaron
[32:57] with something that brings it right to
[33:01] today I've shared this before but this
[33:05] little corner here of the church was an
[33:08] empty
[33:09] space and some of the Believers and
[33:12] sister Jessica's father brother Robert
[33:15] was just a young child here then but it
[33:19] was the figa family uh the gastellum
[33:21] family the Stell family they all had
[33:25] heard brother Brandon was going to be in
[33:27] in service they got here a little late
[33:30] and that was the only available spot so
[33:34] they were all there and brother brand
[33:36] was preaching here off behind this this
[33:39] physical
[33:40] pulpit and uh who was the brother that
[33:44] had the I forget his name brother had
[33:47] the um hardware store brother here in
[33:51] town brother
[33:53] stroy he and his wife shared with my
[33:56] father one day
[33:58] then brother Bram told him that the
[33:59] angel of the Lord was standing right
[34:01] behind him the congregation was not
[34:04] receiving what brother brandham was
[34:05] saying and the angel said it is for them
[34:10] they are receiving it and those families
[34:14] are still
[34:15] represented and then brother brandham
[34:17] when he preaches in Los Angeles he makes
[34:19] a comment along that line of what he had
[34:22] said God's saving power God will reach
[34:25] wherever he has to to get one of his own
[34:29] is that right
[34:31] yeah he just said where he was but God
[34:33] will get to
[34:35] you
[34:38] brother now let me let me bring it down
[34:41] home brother Ricardo you're gonna like
[34:42] this testimony so brother Aon mentioned
[34:46] the gastellum family the um and the
[34:50] different ones was the fryo family
[34:52] also yeah and it was it was a group of
[34:55] of Hispanic people and brother made the
[34:58] made the statement that it was for the
[35:00] Hispanic people that came in
[35:02] late which is now
[35:05] [Laughter]
[35:08] common and sat over here in this
[35:12] wing and I would like to
[35:15] say that we've baptized in this church
[35:19] well over 60 people in the past year or
[35:24] so and you've seen a lot of people start
[35:27] to fill up these these chairs in this
[35:29] church I almost said pews this these
[35:32] chairs in this in this church and most
[35:37] I'd say not I'd say a large majority of
[35:41] those people that have come come from
[35:45] those families that were there that came
[35:48] in late that sat up here in in the front
[35:51] over here and we see that something they
[35:56] they many of them left and have been
[35:58] gone for decades but there is something
[36:01] drawing those people back and we have
[36:05] seen it here at the Tucson Tabernacle we
[36:07] have seen it with our own eyes many of
[36:09] these people coming back Amen brother

[45:57] with this song
[45:59] uh two years ago February
[46:03] 8th I was on my way to the dunes to meet
[46:06] up with some people um Jason Christine
[46:09] Wallace some of the Dalton family for a
[46:13] weekend of uh fellowship and
[46:17] uh some fun
[46:20] um on this song I'll Praise You In The
[46:23] Storm
[46:28] [Music]
[46:33] sometimes I get a song on my heart and I
[46:35] just know I need to sing it for somebody
[46:38] I don't know who it's
[46:39] for but it comes on so strong that you
[46:43] know that's the next song You're
[46:44] supposed to
[46:48] sing when I was driving I was going down
[46:50] I 10 and brother Dan probably knows this
[46:53] area headed towards Yuma right about
[46:56] where inter 8 comes off of I
[46:59] 10 I was singing this
[47:02] song I'm Lord I'm not in a storm right
[47:06] now so who is this
[47:08] [Music]
[47:10] for it's like I just came out of a storm
[47:13] but Lord I'm not in a storm right now
[47:15] but I know you want me to sing this so
[47:20] Lord I'll keep practicing it and we'll
[47:22] uh it'll be the next song I sing We
[47:27] the next
[47:29] day February 9th
[47:32] today we spent the day running around in
[47:34] the dunes having fun on our way back to
[47:37] the camp and about this time of the
[47:40] evening I tipped my machine
[47:43] over stuck my arm out as it went over
[47:47] and it landed on my arm and uh sister
[47:51] can put up the
[47:53] [Music]
[47:55] picture that was the
[48:00] result and then the next day there's one
[48:02] more picture the next
[48:04] day I ended up with surgery and that
[48:09] was what we ended up with
[48:13] um one of the bones didn't heal and 6
[48:16] months later I had to have another
[48:17] surgery bone graft and redo one of the
[48:21] plates
[48:24] but right after it happened the uh
[48:27] the pain was intense but got my arm out
[48:30] from under the machine
[48:33] and I was like
[48:37] Lord right away it was just like thank
[48:39] you
[48:41] Lord here we go this is going to be a
[48:43] journey but Lord I know you're with
[48:46] me and thank you I don't understand but
[48:49] thank
[48:51] you the next day the 10th I had surgery
[48:55] and in the hospital after I came out of
[48:56] surgery this song was still going
[48:58] through my
[49:01] [Music]
[49:05] head and the lines
[49:10] are as your mercy
[49:12] falls I raise my hands and praise the
[49:15] God who gives and takes away and I'll
[49:18] praise you in the
[49:22] storm so I found out who the you know
[49:27] who the song was
[49:28] for but through it all it was a
[49:30] year-long ordeal I was on light duty um
[49:33] my work was very gracious to work with
[49:35] me and uh help me where they
[49:43] could but he's
[49:46] faithful and no matter what you go
[49:49] through Just Praise You always praise
[49:52] him in the storm
[49:57] and uh I kept looking at the date and
[50:00] like I think I should sing that song
[50:03] again and just testify of the goodness
[50:04] of
[50:07] God and praise him in every storm that I
[50:10] go through
[50:12] [Music]
[50:27] I was sure by now God you wouldn't have
[50:31] reached down and wi tears
[50:36] away stepped in and save the
[50:39] day but once
[50:42] again I say
[50:45] amen and it's still

[1:01:20] Amen in light of baptism
[1:01:23] tonight B brother the Kurt
[1:01:26] good to see you welcome in light of
[1:01:28] baptism tonight I want to say a few
[1:01:30] words and then I'd like to have brother
[1:01:32] brandham also say a few words on this
[1:01:34] subject of
[1:01:36] baptism it was a time that the Lord
[1:01:39] Jesus had
[1:01:41] promised that he was going to fill his
[1:01:45] disciples they didn't know what was
[1:01:46] going to happen they they just know that
[1:01:48] that he said to wait in this place until
[1:01:51] you are endued with power from on high
[1:01:54] they didn't know what power from on high
[1:01:55] I was they probably had a lot of
[1:01:58] ideas but when it finally happened in
[1:02:01] the upper
[1:02:02] room and they came out from that room
[1:02:05] and they were stumbling like drunk
[1:02:07] people and they were speaking in in
[1:02:10] unknown tongues and the people saw them
[1:02:11] and they they said what is what is this
[1:02:14] going on these men are full of new
[1:02:16] wine and Peter now filled with the holy
[1:02:21] spirit says
[1:02:24] this for these men for these are not
[1:02:26] drunken as you suppose seeing it is but
[1:02:31] the third hour of the day but this is
[1:02:34] that which was spoken by the prophet
[1:02:36] Joel and it shall come to pass in the
[1:02:38] last days saith God I will pour out my
[1:02:40] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[1:02:42] your daughters shall prophesy and your
[1:02:45] young men shall see visions and your old
[1:02:47] men shall dream
[1:02:49] dreams I'm in Acts chapter 2 and
[1:02:52] then Peter goes on to preach this
[1:02:55] beautiful sermon sermon bringing Jesus
[1:02:58] Christ out of the scriptures and showing
[1:03:02] his presence and showing his calling and
[1:03:05] showing his deity to the
[1:03:08] people and the people were so
[1:03:12] touched as they heard Peter's
[1:03:15] words Acts chapter
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:19] 2 verse
[1:03:23] 32 Peter says this this
[1:03:27] Jesus hath God raised up whereof we are
[1:03:30] all Witnesses therefore being by the
[1:03:33] right hand of
[1:03:34] God exalted in having received of the
[1:03:37] Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he
[1:03:40] has shed forth this which ye now know
[1:03:43] and hear for David is not ascended into
[1:03:45] the heavens but he saith himself the
[1:03:47] Lord saith unto my
[1:03:50] Lord sit thou on my right
[1:03:53] hand until I make thy foes thy foot
[1:03:56] stools therefore let all the house of
[1:03:58] Israel know assuredly that God hath made
[1:04:02] that same Jesus whom you have crucified
[1:04:06] both Lord and
[1:04:09] Christ now when they heard
[1:04:12] this they were pricked in their heart
[1:04:15] they were cut in their
[1:04:18] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[1:04:21] rest of the Apostles men and
[1:04:23] Brethren what shall we we do
[1:04:28] imagine that the same spirit that was
[1:04:31] working on those people way back 2,000
[1:04:34] years ago and they went to Peter is the
[1:04:36] Same Spirit working on these
[1:04:39] children this
[1:04:41] evening the same feeling that they had
[1:04:44] is the same feeling that these kids are
[1:04:46] having Lord what do I need to do thank
[1:04:50] God that there is an
[1:04:52] answer then Peter said unto them
[1:04:56] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:04:59] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:05:00] remission of your sins and ye shall
[1:05:03] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:05:06] This Promise is unto you and to your
[1:05:09] children and to all that are far off
[1:05:12] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:05:16] call and with many other
[1:05:18] words did he testify and exhort saying
[1:05:21] save yourselves from this UNT
[1:05:24] generation then they that gladly
[1:05:26] received his word were
[1:05:29] baptized and the same day there were
[1:05:33] added under them about 3,000
[1:05:35] Souls I love it thinking the same spirit
[1:05:38] that was working on those people there
[1:05:41] at the day of Pentecost is the Same
[1:05:42] Spirit that's working on our
[1:05:45] children and I picked out just a
[1:05:48] beautiful
[1:05:49] quote to um to play
[1:05:53] [Music]
[1:05:54] tonight it's
[1:05:56] from future home of heavenly bridegroom
[1:05:59] and Earthly bride but but before I I get
[1:06:01] there while I was looking I came across
[1:06:04] this
[1:06:05] one and it blessed me so much really
[1:06:09] explains very well water baptism in just
[1:06:12] a few words brother Bram says this now
[1:06:14] we believe in water
[1:06:16] baptism in the brandham Tabernacle by
[1:06:18] immersing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:20] Christ we believe that in the Tucson
[1:06:22] Tabernacle
[1:06:23] too which is the apostolic teaching of
[1:06:25] the Bible and may all may all members of
[1:06:29] us or comers to the brandom Tabernacle
[1:06:31] who desire such may it any time
[1:06:34] requesting to be immersed in the name of
[1:06:36] the Lord Jesus may he consult the pastor
[1:06:39] if they have repented and Believe on the
[1:06:41] Lord Jesus Christ the pastor will as
[1:06:43] soon as
[1:06:44] possible even that it then if he can
[1:06:47] baptize them immediately this does bring
[1:06:51] them into the Fellowship of the
[1:06:54] Believers
[1:06:56] we believe that by water baptism we are
[1:06:59] brought into a
[1:07:02] fellowship but by the baptism of the
[1:07:04] Holy Spirit we are brought into the into
[1:07:08] the
[1:07:09] members being members of the body of
[1:07:12] Jesus Christ which is all over the world
[1:07:16] oh that's beautiful
[1:07:20] beautiful I'll have you be
[1:07:23] seated the following
[1:07:26] quote the
[1:07:29] following portion of the sermon we're
[1:07:31] going to hear comes from the sermon
[1:07:33] titled the future home of the Heavenly
[1:07:35] bridegroom and the Earthly bride it
[1:07:37] starts with paragraph 81 if you'd like
[1:07:39] to follow brother Jordan thank
[1:07:45] you now first stage that he brings us to
[1:07:50] see his Plan of
[1:07:53] Redemption is exact the Same by
[1:07:58] everything he uses the same
[1:08:00] method he never changes he said in
[1:08:04] Malachi 3 I am God and I change
[1:08:08] not the way he does it therefore if he
[1:08:11] saved the first man he ever saved by the
[1:08:14] shed blood of an innocent one he'll have
[1:08:15] to save the next one and every one he
[1:08:17] saves will have to be the same
[1:08:19] way if he healed a man at any time
[1:08:22] through the Journey of life let it be in
[1:08:24] the days of Jesus the apostles the
[1:08:26] prophets whatever it was when the same
[1:08:29] conditions is met he's got to do it
[1:08:32] again that's right he doesn't change man
[1:08:37] changes time changes age changes
[1:08:39] dispensation changes but God Remains the
[1:08:42] Same it's perfect what I hope that hard
[1:08:46] give the sick
[1:08:47] people if he ever healed a person he has
[1:08:51] to do it again when the same conditions
[1:08:53] is
[1:08:54] met he ever ever saved a man he's got to
[1:08:59] do it on the same ground as he did it
[1:09:00] the first time if he ever filled a man
[1:09:03] with the Holy Ghost he's got to do it on
[1:09:05] the same grounds he did the first
[1:09:07] time if he ever raised a man up from the
[1:09:10] grave he's got to do it the second time
[1:09:12] and every other time on the same
[1:09:15] principle doesn't
[1:09:17] change oh what a hope that gives me what
[1:09:20] is it not in some man-made Theory
[1:09:24] something that groups a man have come
[1:09:25] together but his unchangeable word you
[1:09:29] say is it the truth he said let every
[1:09:32] man's word be a lie and mine be true for
[1:09:35] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:09:38] word shall never fail all scriptures
[1:09:41] given by inspiration therefore it's good
[1:09:44] and profitable for Doctrine and remember
[1:09:46] that all scripture will be
[1:09:50] fulfilled every a bit of it notice how
[1:09:55] God God makes it plain to us and if that
[1:09:58] wasn't a a great confirmation a good a
[1:10:02] great loving blessing from God when I
[1:10:06] see this and see that since a
[1:10:09] boy first time ever Christ dealt with me
[1:10:13] I've still always taught those three
[1:10:16] stages of
[1:10:17] Grace notice it isn't true now now the
[1:10:21] first step is
[1:10:23] repentance towards God
[1:10:26] and then follows after that is water
[1:10:29] baptism water baptism repent and be
[1:10:33] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see
[1:10:36] water baptism follows showing that
[1:10:39] repentance was
[1:10:41] genuine or to remit our past sins now it
[1:10:47] has nothing to do with future
[1:10:50] sin it only
[1:10:53] remits repent and be baptized in the
[1:10:56] name of Jesus Christ what far
[1:11:00] remission taken away of past sin has
[1:11:06] nothing to do with the future just your
[1:11:09] uh sin has been chopped
[1:11:12] off what you did you can't repent from
[1:11:15] what Adam
[1:11:16] done you never done it Adam did you just
[1:11:20] get forgiveness for what You'
[1:11:23] done the old nature still
[1:11:27] there let me take this board just a
[1:11:39] minute now here is a human
[1:11:43] heart I'm not I'm a long way since been
[1:11:45] an
[1:11:47] artist here is a human heart and here is
[1:11:51] a human heart now this one over here has
[1:11:55] a snake in it that's sin here he has his
[1:11:58] life this over here has a dove in it
[1:12:01] which is the holy spirit here he has a
[1:12:03] life well this here has malice hatred
[1:12:08] Envy that's what's causing this all here
[1:12:10] amen well this over here has love and uh
[1:12:14] joy and longsuffering and that's what
[1:12:18] does it down here now when you are asked
[1:12:21] or you are forgiven of your sins you've
[1:12:24] only done
[1:12:26] this taking that away but the thing that
[1:12:29] made you do it is still
[1:12:32] there that's the old root of evil it's
[1:12:36] still there notice then you repent and
[1:12:40] are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:12:43] that he forgave you of your sins notice
[1:12:50] then secondly comes
[1:12:52] sanctification which sets our mind in
[1:12:55] order for Holiness to think right amen
[1:13:00] taken away sanctification is a compound
[1:13:03] Greek word which means cleaned and set
[1:13:05] aside for
[1:13:07] service then the next comes the baptism
[1:13:11] of the fire and holy ghost that God
[1:13:13] might dwell in us and the fire of
[1:13:16] God cleanses our hearts from sin and
[1:13:20] puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring
[1:13:22] forth the same life that this did
[1:13:24] because that's
[1:13:26] us notice in the natural birth when a
[1:13:29] woman gives birth to a baby the Natural
[1:13:31] Life types the spiritual life when a
[1:13:34] woman gives birth to a baby the natural
[1:13:36] the first thing happens is breaking of
[1:13:39] water then blood and then the Spirit
[1:13:43] Alive grab the little fell and spank him
[1:13:45] and away he go screaming water blood
[1:13:50] spirit and now when a baby is born into
[1:13:53] the kingdom of God he comes the same
[1:13:56] water blood spirit I notice
[1:14:00] sanctification the third stage second
[1:14:03] stage of it cleanses the Mind sets the
[1:14:07] heart the mind of the heart in order of
[1:14:10] Holiness a man can repent of sins and
[1:14:12] he's still thinking of well maybe he's a
[1:14:16] immoral man every immoral looking woman
[1:14:19] he finds is still there maybe he's a
[1:14:22] drunker every time he smells the drink
[1:14:24] it's still there see but then when he
[1:14:28] gets
[1:14:29] Sanctified that cleanses that desire out
[1:14:33] of him see it takes the want of it away
[1:14:36] he can still be tempted but he takes the
[1:14:38] want of it away still he's not right yet
[1:14:41] then he is baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:44] in
[1:14:45] fire cleansed burned out cleaned up and
[1:14:49] then put into the service of God
[1:14:52] sanctification only sets him aside for
[1:14:54] service
[1:14:55] and notice this exactly how that come
[1:14:57] the message is coming Martin Luther
[1:15:00] justification John Wesley sanctification
[1:15:03] the Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:06] Ghost the messages that's where there
[1:15:08] can't be any more ages of it see we're
[1:15:10] at the end time three stages baptism
[1:15:14] cleanses the heart with the Holy Ghost
[1:15:16] how striking
[1:15:18] now he takes the place
[1:15:22] where we are to dwell in through the
[1:15:25] same process now he's called The Church
[1:15:28] through justification called it through
[1:15:30] sanctification then filled it with the
[1:15:32] Holy Ghost and Fire and he took it
[1:15:34] through a process that he himself the
[1:15:37] Holy Spirit himself the Son of God could
[1:15:40] dwell in the human heart now it has to
[1:15:43] go through that before he can come into
[1:15:46] it amen I say that's a good explanation
[1:15:50] of what baptism is what do you think
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:55] so important brother brandom said there
[1:15:57] must be a repentance first that's why we
[1:15:59] don't baptize
[1:16:01] babies because there's no repentance in
[1:16:03] a baby a baby's never done anything
[1:16:05] wrong I assume Asher and Khloe have done
[1:16:08] a few things
[1:16:11] wrong God bless you it's uh it's an
[1:16:14] honor but that those things right there
[1:16:17] their first is a repentance and then
[1:16:20] there's a there's as the Bible says that
[1:16:23] they're pricked in their heart
[1:16:25] and um uh sister Abby was telling me the
[1:16:29] testimony of how that that it it came
[1:16:32] along and how they've stuck with this
[1:16:34] and they really want to do it and if
[1:16:36] brother Aaron if you could make ready
[1:16:37] and and bring bring them
[1:16:42] upstairs it shows
[1:16:44] that God is still god brother Bram said
[1:16:47] God changes
[1:16:48] not he still works on the heart of the
[1:16:51] people he works on the heart of the
[1:16:53] children he works on the heart of a
[1:16:54] adults he works on the heart of new
[1:16:56] converts and he's still working and it's
[1:17:00] it's beautiful because when that either
[1:17:04] the the young child like this when he or
[1:17:07] she gives their heart to the Lord the
[1:17:09] first thing they want to do is they want
[1:17:12] to be baptized and it shows that the
[1:17:14] parents have in been instilling these in
[1:17:17] these things into the kids and teaching
[1:17:18] them right and then they have that
[1:17:21] desire and then they go into the Waters
[1:17:24] of baptism and then that's just the
[1:17:26] beginning brother brandom just said he
[1:17:29] said for it's it's the remission of your
[1:17:31] past sins and now those sins have been
[1:17:33] remitted now you move forward as a new
[1:17:36] creature as As Romans I believe it's
[1:17:38] chapter 6 says you go forward as a new
[1:17:41] person those old sins washed away and
[1:17:44] now moving forward and I look forward to
[1:17:46] seeing these these kids and how that
[1:17:49] they will grow up in the Lord and I
[1:17:51] believe that they will be Servants of
[1:17:53] God and it'll just get better and better
[1:17:55] it get hard is it's just life he didn't
[1:17:59] say that our that we won't ever sin
[1:18:01] again but we do we we have a journey and
[1:18:06] they're taking this Step In the Journey
[1:18:09] and moving forward and being baptized
[1:18:12] and it's it's a beautiful thing Amen
[1:18:15] brother Josiah I'm going to turn the
[1:18:16] service over to you as brother Aon and
[1:18:20] and the kids prepare for
[1:18:21] baptism and I'll uh
[1:18:25] I'll sit in the front and I'll keep an
[1:18:27] eye out for

[1:20:55] but not from

[1:23:18] life away
[1:23:21] [Music]
[1:23:25] sure is a privilege to be up here
[1:23:28] something I thought I may never see but
[1:23:31] here we are I remember the first
[1:23:34] baptismal service that I witnessed here
[1:23:37] at the
[1:23:38] Tabernacle was in 1977 that year and
[1:23:43] everybody had said that Jesus was coming
[1:23:46] then so about 135 of us got baptized
[1:23:49] that
[1:23:50] night rebaptism to everybody making sure
[1:23:54] it was
[1:23:55] ready and here it is just a few years
[1:23:58] down the road wouldn't thought we've
[1:24:00] gotten this far but here we are today
[1:24:03] now to baptize my my
[1:24:06] grandson and I know he loves the Lord
[1:24:10] Jesus mommy asked him he said about
[1:24:13] getting baptized and he
[1:24:15] said what is it when you get baptized
[1:24:17] she goes it means you're going to
[1:24:19] worship
[1:24:20] Jesus and worship gets to give praise
[1:24:23] and honor and who more deserves it so
[1:24:27] this is Asher and he'll be seven on
[1:24:30] Tuesday and so we're going to baptize
[1:24:33] him in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:53] Christ e

[1:25:27] than
[1:26:05] so when Abby was talking to the kids
[1:26:08] because they had mentioned about being
[1:26:09] baptized Asher had wanted to take
[1:26:11] communion so that's when Abby began to
[1:26:14] tell
[1:26:15] them the you know the process if I could
[1:26:17] say it that way and so she was talking
[1:26:21] to them and Abby asked Chloe have you

[1:26:27] said no she says you want to do that and
[1:26:30] she says yes so she goes you want to
[1:26:34] pray and she goes yeah so Abby said I
[1:26:35] was going to go with her but she says
[1:26:38] Mama I'll go by myself I'll go to my
[1:26:40] room so she was in her room for a little
[1:26:43] while and when she came out she had a
[1:26:45] smile on her face and she said I gave my
[1:26:48] heart to the
[1:26:50] Lord and she says now I want to be
[1:26:52] baptized so it it's such an
[1:27:05] honor I was going toti you in the name
[1:27:08] of the Lord Jesus
[1:27:10] Christ and God said he would you his

[1:28:00] me I've seen the
[1:28:03] passion of his
[1:28:07] death and the
[1:28:10] Forgiveness of his final
[1:28:14] breath and now I can
[1:28:17] never be the
[1:28:21] same for my heart has been and
[1:28:26] forever
[1:28:28] changed I've got to live and love and

[1:37:59] girl I believe the angels of heaven were
[1:38:02] in that room and rejoicing and I believe
[1:38:06] that none other than the almighty God
[1:38:08] had his here his year down hearing that
[1:38:11] young lady give her heart to the Lord
[1:38:15] Jesus and it's going to stay with her
