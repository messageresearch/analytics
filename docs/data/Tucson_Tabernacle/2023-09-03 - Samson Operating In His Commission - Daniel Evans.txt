remind us all what he's done for us had it not been just supposed oh God through heaven and couldn't find one willing to be together the Supreme sacrifice [Music] that was needed [Music] that would buy eternal life for you and me had it not been for a place called Calvary and had it not been for The Old Rugged Cross had it not been for a man called Jesus [Music] then forever my soul I'm so mad he was willing to drink this bitter cup although he prayed father let him pass from me he never called Heaven's angels [Music] had it not been in for a place called Mount Calvary had it not been for The Old Rugged Cross had it not been foreign [Music] then forever my soul [Music] go ahead and play that chorus in the Book of John chapter 11. verses 23 to 26. when Martha's talking to the Lord Darren Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live looking at someone that was in the Tomb and though he were dead he shall live and he said whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die then he asked believeth thou this and I raised my hand and I said yes Lord I believe amen I appreciate that his good had it not been for a place called Mount Calvary then Forever My Soul we do have one prayer requester sister Amelia I don't see her here this morning but please play pray for my son Fabian and his family they will be coming from Oklahoma on Wednesday okay so remember Fabian and his family as they travel from Oklahoma this way and also [Music] she also just sent a second request a security guard in her building was in a serious motorcycle accident so remember him in prayer sometimes God puts you in a place so that you can reach out for someone else maybe maybe that's what itself will stand by their head if you'll make your way up here for a place called Mount Calvary [Music] then forever my soul [Music] had it not been for a place called Mount Calvary had it not been for The Old Rugged wrong had it not been for a man called Jesus them forever my soul these words have a lot of meaning if you stop and really think about it as we take the request would you have something you'd like to make known to the Lord with an uplifted hand let's go before him this

know if I if I missed anyone um welcome we appreciate you all as brother Aaron mentioned tonight we'll have the communion service um it's great time for a Christian to be able to take the communion and make sure our lives are set up or our lives are going like the Lord would want us to it's um it's a time of reflection the Bible says let a man examine himself pray that we've done that this week and that uh this eve this this afternoon will be the same this time of of reflection um for plans for next week we are almost finished just this close to the the kids room the new kids room here um and I want to I want to open it up next Sunday after service and I've asked sister Rachel to plan a potluck for after service next Sunday so we can stay and the kids can enjoy themselves in the new room here I think it'll be a real blessing to everyone to the parents to the to the kids we'll have the upper room open and then we also have a musicians practice scheduled also for after Sunday so we'll cancel service next Sunday night and we will have a potluck after service on Sunday morning I'll send out an announcement I'm looking forward to that I think it's going to be a blessing to the to the kids I want them to enjoy coming to church I want them to enjoy the word I want them to enjoy Sunday school I want them to enjoy the worship and I want them to enjoy the fellowship we draw strength from each other and if we can start as as young children developing these friendships and these bonds instead of kids tearing each other down then they can get together and they can build each other up that's my that's my harsh desire for the young people I've been wanting to minister on the Book of Judges it's been on my heart for some time and and over the past week or so I was praying and asking the Lord what he wanted me to preach on on Sunday and my mind just kept going back to this book of judges and the most famous judge that we know of in the Bible is this man named Samson so I want to talk about him this morning and the judges when we talk about Judges we're not talking about a man that sits in a robe and and sits presiding over a courtroom that's not what these judges were these judges were deliverers for Israel they were they were men and in one case a woman that that came and they provided the leadership that the country needed to get out of some very difficult times which I'll talk about here in a moment Moses when they were came to the Jordan River and they were about to go over to the promised land Moses tells the people he says listen he says if you serve God will bless you but if you don't serve God and you fall into sin and you fall into this idolatry then the curses of God will rest upon you and it's the same as as we go through life when we are serving God we're going to be happier no when you give your heart to the Lord you're not going to get a check in the mail for a million dollars it's it's not like that but when you really give your heart to the Lord and you're really serving God there's the happiness that's there and that's the comfort knowing that Jesus Christ is on the throne and he's going to take care of whatever need that we have and when we get away from God as you will see today we see that we may be wanting to have fun we may be wanting to Rebel we may be wanting to sin but those sins are just make our lives more difficult and they cause us to suffer God doesn't want his children to suffer just like I wouldn't want my children to suffer you and want your children to suffer he wants us to prosper he wants us to to be happy and happiness will never be found in sin as you will see from this man Samson's life so Moses tells he warns the people Joshua comes on the scene and and they divide the land they go over Jordan they divide the land and God continues to deliver Israel out of the hands of their enemy and then towards the end of Joshua the Israelites pledge they say that we want to serve God and we will continue to serve God he's done so much for us so we want to continue to serve him well time goes on after that gen and that generation that knew Joshua that saw the Miracles that saw everything that happened under Joshua's Ministry time goes on all of those Warriors died out and then we see sin come in and start to enter this the Israel Israelites through idolatry and through all kinds of bad things and God had his eyes on this country of Israel for a very special reason and I can't think of a more important reason was because eventually he was going to bring Christ through this lineage of Israel and he had to protect that lineage All Through the Ages because he would one day bring the Messiah or the Redeemer through this bunch of people called the Jews the lion of the tribe of Judah shows you how important that Jesus is God protected that line because his son would come through that line and today any Minister any church anything that's worth anything if you promote Jesus Christ and if you introduce people to Christ then you will be doing well but if you're introducing people to a church or to a Doctrine or to themselves that is when it doesn't do any good in fact it just brings harm into into the church so and judges 2 7 . again these judges weren't Kings they weren't appointed by men they weren't elected they didn't come through a lineage they didn't move up through the military ranks they were simply chosen by God to lead Israel out of imminent destruction they were gifts that God placed there judges 2 7 says this and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel as I said they remembered all the great things then in judges 2 18 it says this and when the Lord raised them up judges the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reasons of them that oppressed them and vexed them then so so they would sin and God would bring a judge to help them out and later on in the Book of Judges it makes this statement a couple times it says that every man did that which was right in his own eyes you think well that's that sounds pretty good that sounds pretty good that that someone would do right in their own eyes they didn't have a prophet then they didn't have a king they didn't have a leader like Samson or Gideon or Barrick or Samuel there was no leadership in Israel so everybody did kind of what they thought was right in their own eyes and almost every time it was for their own benefit and we see that friends we are in that time today we see that people they they don't want to they don't want to Worship the Lord they don't want to a fellowship they don't want to come to church they want to just the church will be there it's good for their own for maybe say Allah I'm a Christian I go to church once a week or I go to church once a month or whatever it is but I don't want it to cramp my style I don't want to put Church any higher I don't want to put God any higher than what I believe than what I do because I am first I want my way and then I want to be able to say I'm a Christian because when I die if there is a God I want to make sure that I go to heaven and I don't go to hell and that's what happens when there is no leadership and this was happening this in the judges where there was no leadership so everybody just kind of did whatever they wanted there was no Unity there were there was no and there's power in unity so when and it set it up to where a kingdom like the Philistines could just come in and take over and just rule because they weren't a united front against them and I think and I see today God sends into the church he sends gifts into the church and those gifts we hear we hear it so often Ephesians 4 he sends Apostles and Prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers those things are gifts that God places into the church to help the church to be servants to the church to to provide that leadership and that correction to say hey you're you need to be here more often because I can see you're starting to slip away I can see the world start to creep into your lives this church will help come in what better thing do you have to do then go to church think about it what's what's more important in your life than than coming here fellowshipping worshiping and hearing the word of the Lord now there's a lot that abused that and I've seen I've seen people hurt very badly because of church and I've seen a sister I won't I won't say her name but she gave me this book the other day and this book is dedicated using quotes from a man of God named William Branham and bible verses to justify taking someone out from underneath the blood and turning them over to Satan just because they didn't line up with the way that the church teaches there is a place for that First Corinthians chapter 5 Paul there was a there was a man that was sinning greatly he was having an affair with his stepmother it was an awful thing so Paul says I will turn him over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh so that his soul would be saved it was an act of kindness it was an act of love that Paul did to this person and we see them taking that scripture and taking other scriptures and taking other quotes and putting them together and saying that if you don't do the way that we teach you we'll cast you out and you'll be under Satan then it puts a fear into the people and it is a lie let me tell you something that is wrong I it's it's something that I will stand against and it has hurt so many people telling them that if you don't do it the way we say you should do it then you are condemned let me tell you something in the book of First Corinthians Paul does that and you know what happens in second Corinthians that man comes back he comes back he repents of his sins and he comes back and he has entered back into the fellowship so let me tell you Paul was a true Apostle of God if that if you do that and that person is not reconciled and that person does not come back to the Lord then you friends are a false prophet in doing it because you have done it you have spoken presumptuously you have done it out of the will of God and I will I've seen so many people hurt by Churches by by attacking these people and and putting fear into them there should be fear of God and God only not fear of a church not fear of a pastor not fear of a priest but fear of God that you would disappoint him that's the truth and so many people in this church are here they're they've been hurt in the past that is wrong picking and choosing things that men of God have said and putting them together and changing the word of God in hatred and in and attacking God's children I didn't I really want to go into that but this place I stand against that there is a place for correction of course if you're walking out in the world and you're sinning you are walking the line of Heaven and Hell don't get anywhere close to that line but let me tell you just because you may not interpret the word like I do that doesn't that's no reason to cast someone out the reason you cast someone out is number one if they're doing harm to the church if they're a danger to the church then that person is not welcome here or like this brother it's an act of compassion and it's an act of love and then he comes back that's the way you do it but here in the Book of Judges these these people they were doing what was right in their own eyes Proverbs Chapter 12 says this the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that hearketh unto counsel is wise so yes we do come into the congregation for correction we do come here to learn more about the Lord and to be corrected to keep us away from hell to keep us away from the enemy and to send us to Christ Proverbs 21 said every way of a man is right in his own eyes so we all think we're right and the way we're doing things but it takes a humble heart to be able to take correction correction is very important a humble heart is very important we should come here and say Lord I want to be better I want to be a better servant of you but Satan the nature of Satan is one that no no no you just do what feels right in your own eyes you just do as you feel to do and then you'll be fine see you have your own relationship with God you have your own understanding that's true you do but that doesn't mean that this word is not our absolute in all things Our Lives must live up to this word Isaiah Chapter 14 verse 12. Prophet is addressing Satan he says how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also on the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high wow how many times have we heard that Spirit come from the pulpit you're great you will Ascend you will be this great thing that's exactly what Satan said let me tell you we are nothing Jesus is everything and if we can just put our trust in him he'll love us he'll take care of us and and he will exalt us he will bring us to heaven but it's not us everything is about our Lord I think that you know we think there's going to be a lot of disappointment for message Believers on the day of judgment let me tell you that just because you think that because you have been chosen to hear a great message which we have it doesn't matter unless we have a relationship with Jesus Christ that is everything that's what it was for as I said about Israel God protected Israel because he had a messiah coming it was all about Jesus All Through the Ages Even Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and and slaying the the lamb and taking the skin and covering up their nakedness it was about Jesus from the start to the Finish it's about one man the man Christ Jesus and everything this whole book points to that man judges they have lost their perspective Judges chapter 13 verse 1. and the children of Israel did evil in this again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hands of the Philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of Zora of the family of the danites whose name was Manoa and his wife was Barren and bear not and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art Barren and bearth not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines now the situation here Israel was under the rulership of this Philistine Nation they were the occupying group and as I think about it as I was reading that scripture he tells the angel of the Lord tells this this lady he says don't drink wine or strong drink or eat anything unclean while this baby is in your womb so it goes to show that when we see it everywhere that a mother that's conceived and has a child be careful with smoking and drinking and drugs and all of that and all that I hear so often well it doesn't affect the baby it does and in fact science says it does but also the Bible says right here be careful be careful of that unborn child in the womb this word Nazarite that that the angel tells this lady it's a a separation this man is a Nazarite he separates himself he doesn't cut his hair doesn't drink alcohol he doesn't touch a dead body there's other things that give him an outward commitment to holiness and Samson is the most famous person that I know of in the Bible that had that Nazarite Vow where he didn't he didn't cut his hair it was an outward you could look at him and say okay well he's got this vowel but you know there's other people you know what another famous one was Samuel the prophet he also was under that Nazarite vow even Paul we've been going through the book of Acts there's times when Paul would go a stretch of time and not cut his hair because he had a vow then you see in the Bible that he will go and cut his hair and then it will say that he cut his hair because he had that vow and he was finished with that Nazarite time and it wasn't just her hair they lived a strict legalistic life to the Lord while they had that vow so this Angel as I just read comes to this lady and she goes and tells her husband her husband's name Manoa Manoa goes in and he said he gets on his knees and he prays he says Lord I would really like it if this man they didn't know it was an angel if this man that came to my wife if he would come also and tell me these things that he told my wife they couldn't have children and this was a big deal I want to know all this so he prayed this man comes back he comes to manoa's wife she's like wait a minute I gotta introduce my husband so she goes introduces this man to her husband and he says hey will you tell me what you told my wife so he tells her most of what he had told his wife and then Manoa he's just taken by back by this man of God he says he says hey how about staying for supper he says I'm good I'm gonna go get a goat and we'll kill it and we'll make some food and and the guy says the man says no I'm not going to do that but if you're going to take that goat make a burnt offering to the Lord with it I'm not going to eat but take that goat and let's make a burnt offering so Manoa takes the goat takes it to the altar he kills it lights the fire they put the the offering to the Lord on the altar the Flames are coming up and as those Flames are coming up this man goes up into these flames and goes up into heaven and I was like whoa didn't expect that he looks up and he says he says honey I'm dead we're dead everything's over we're gonna die that was God that we didn't know it we're everything's and he freaks out his wife like honey calm down listen I don't think that he would want us he would come and have told us this that this was going to happen and to make an offering if God was going to kill us don't you love when our wives settle us down sometime I don't mind us and I'll get all worked up and it's like honey and that's what happened here so what the angel told them came to pass they they raised the child in the admonition of the Lord in the in the way that this Angel told them and God doesn't do things just just to do them he wanted to make an impression on these parents to tell them to raise this child right so they did they raised him and even though he was a man of God Samson had a lot of weaknesses and the most prevalent of those weaknesses was he was attracted to girls that he shouldn't have been attracted to he liked the the girls that were not the kind of girls that you'd want to bring home to mom as it as it said as the saying goes and we see that throughout his life we see that as a major weakness he has and and he tells his parents so he's out and about and he meets this girl that's not of his own faith she's a girl that we would call today she wouldn't be a Christian girl she's somebody that didn't have the same values that wasn't raised in the same way and this man Samson he looks at her and he likes her and the Bible says that she was pleasing in his eyes he liked the way she looked so he meets her he's talking he comes back home he tells his parents and he's like hey Mom and Dad I uh I met this girl and I think I want to marry her and they're like whoa whoa whoa and in parents we see our kids and the worst thing in my opinion that I've seen the biggest problems in the lives of people growing up Through the Ages and we've all seen it is yoking yourself up with the wrong man or the wrong woman it is just it opens the door for problems and for a miserable life and his parents see Samson they're they're the young man and and they're like they're like honey aren't there enough girls at church aren't there aren't there girls aren't there some Christian girls that you wanna that you would want to to marry or to date but you're dating this girl she doesn't have the same value she doesn't live right her parents doesn't live right they don't live under the same values that that we have that she's not as we would say she's not even a Christian but Samson there was something going on going on behind the scenes it worried Samson I mean it worried Samson's parents and for the young people as I said at the beginning God wants you to be happy he wants you to enjoy your life if you marry someone who is not a believer someone who doesn't respect this book someone who doesn't respect the Lord Jesus it's problems down the road you will suffer you you won't have the same Foundation there's going to be trouble down the road so if I could give a warning to young people today if you don't get anything out of this sermon this morning other than this be careful have patience God will send the right one along don't settle for someone that is not filled with the Holy Spirit and doesn't put God first in his or her life there'll be trouble down the way not just for the Young Folks but for all of us when we're choosing our friends or if you're later in life and and there may be an opportunity to to have have a mate be careful always be careful with that but in this case there was something going on behind the scenes with Samson's desire to have this Philistine moment Judges chapter 14 verse 4. but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord that he sought an occasion against the Philistines for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel let me say this before we get into the testimony of Samson even Samson even though he was perfectly in God's will in seeking out this Philistine girls that scripture just said he still suffered horribly for marrying a girl that was outside his faith even though it was God's will he still suffered for it but how good does it feel feel when we are in God's will how good does it feel when when as as I was talking about this let me tell you something I can stand here and and I can Minister and it's like Lord am I trying am I doing right and I'm constantly there's there's turmoil there but when I stand there and say this and what that what some of you have been told and trying to control you and dominate your life I can stand here and say bring it on that's false that is wrong and have that confidence knowing that I stand Here In The Name Of The Lord doing my best but standing against the bullying of the enemy you know you're right and you're prepared for battle you can pull that sword and say Bring It On Satan let me let me pause here for a minute there's a man that we've all heard his name it was a boxer named Evander Holyfield and Vander when he was when he was a young man he was born he was the ninth child in this big family no dad he he just they were as poor as a church mouse they had nothing to to as far as a life there they were destined for failure all of these kids irvander went young Evander went to this boys club and there was this Evander called him he said there was this white man that came to me and he said he looked down at him his little kid and he says you could be the heavyweight champion of the world and you know what vander's response was he said but I'm only eight years old and he says the wisdom of this man he says you're not going to be eight forever and he says you know my birthday was next week so I knew that that was going to happen so no I'm not going to be eight so he goes home and asks his mother about this he says hey Mom I says I want to be heavyweight champion of the world eight years old his everybody laughed at him his friends put him down but his mom says listen she says if you listen if you follow directions and you don't quit then you'll succeed so the poor little kid he started he started boxing and and he was really good he was gifted he came up through the ranks he was winning all these fights and through all the hard work and the love of certain people everybody told him even his teachers told him his family told him you are not going to be anything you're going to fail you're gonna you can't do it constantly telling him this he constantly worked and worked and worked and he worked all the way up till he became the heavyweight champion of the world Evander Holyfield going on he loses a fight gets the heavyweight championship back loses another fight and there was something off in his body there was something wrong in evander's in his health so he went to the doctor and went to a few doctors remember this is a rich man he's got the best doctors his doctor says you are never to fight again you are never to have this kind of physical activity you have heart disease you cannot you will die Evander step down from boxing told everybody I remember this I was a big fan when I was a kid of this guy I was like oh you know it's it was it was my favorite boxer and and so he's steps away from boxing and as he steps away the most feared boxer that has ever been starts raising up in the ranks this man named Mike Tyson this guy and everybody knows who he is he would just knock people's heads off he was Unstoppable Evander Holyfield he he he doesn't understand he he wants he he wants to box so you know what he does he goes to a Revival meeting like we had last week here in the church he goes and he gets prayed for the man that prayed for him said okay go back to the doctor and do what the doctors tell you Evander goes back to the doctor doctors do all his tests and other doctors do tests and they said we don't understand you have no heart disease you are 100 healthy you can go and fight you can do whatever you want so Evander gets a title shot and this is what I'm getting to with this story I remember when he did this he's going to fight the greatest most feared fighter that had ever been and he says this he says I remember seeing it on the news he said I guarantee victory what a statement I remember thinking wow how could he say that that's pretty bold and I thought well if I just say some dumb things but he meant it not the brightest right buddy my son's a boxer he's bright though so he said I guarantee Victory got the title shot there they come in the in in the ring they fight it out he knocks them out he knocks out Mike Tyson with a TKO in the fight wins the battle he was commissioned he knew he had word from the Lord he was healed he had word from the Lord that he was going to win and there he is beating this greatest fighter this most intimidating fighter ever saying I guarantee Victory then he comes and afterwards um the the uh announcer guy they're their ringside and he says um yes I just want to know how you how you could in Holyfield says I just want to give the Lord Jesus Christ credit for all things and start talking about the Lord and frustrated you can see the video on YouTube frustrated the guy and he says yeah but but that's good and that's good but how could you guarantee Victory and he said through Jesus the guy says yeah but but really and he was frustrated Holyfield just kept talking about the Lord and kept talking about the Lord he was commissioned like this man Samson so Samson he goes and he marries this girl first of all when Holyfield came out to fight Tyson he had in his on his belt Philippians 4 13. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me went out there and he did knocked him out I think the same thing for us you know if we are commissioned Holyfield a worldly boxing match if we are commissioned this book says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I'm commissioned and you're healed right sister Cheryl sister Connie we are commissioned just like this man Samson it says that he sought an occasion against the Philistines so Samson makes this trip to to to Timnath he's going up there and he's going up there to get this to marry this girl and on his way he goes to this Vineyard and walking through in this lion comes out of the bushes and attacks him and Samson under the anointing grabs a line and rips him in two throws him down beside the beside the trail and keeps walking in doesn't tell anybody about it if that was me you're not going to believe what happened this life came out of grab and ripped him apart and oh it was great he doesn't tell anybody he was commissioned to go so he goes and and he goes in and they have this like seven day this long feast and they have this bachelor party and remember back on the marriage thing when you marry a man or a woman or a girl when you get married you're also marrying that person's family and everything every problem that that family has now becomes your problem it's the truth maybe people laugh you young people because they the people are laughing probably been there you do you marry this person you marry that person's problems and Samson goes in he wants to marry this young lady that's not a Christian as we would call it that doesn't know the Lord and her family doesn't so they and her family invites these 30 Philistine men and it's like uh I guess you'd call it like a bachelor party they all get together and when Samson let me go back when Samson so he he he met this girl he went back home he killed the lion met this girl he goes back home he comes back for the marriage and that lion as he's coming back he sees that Lion now it's a couple months later he sees that lion dead and that lion inside of the carcass was a beehive and that beehive was full of honey so Samson gets down there I don't know how he gets away from the bees but he gets in there and he dips some of that honey out and he eats it and he goes in to town and he gives it to his family and they eat it and he doesn't tell him the story about the lion doesn't tell him where he got it he just shares the honey so they go to he goes to this party for his marriage and Samson remember now he's commissioned and he's seeking an occasion against the Philistines so now they have these 30 young men that come and it's Samson so you have 30 Philistines and one Hebrew there was probably a lot of testosterone going on in the room there's a lot of tension so Samson's there and he says hey he says I have a riddle for you and they're like all right and he says let me tell you if you can answer the riddle he says there's 30 of you I will give you each a a change of garment and a and a linen and a linen suit and he says there's 30 of you and if and if you can't then you each give me a linen garment in a change of clothes like all right Judges 13 12. and Samson said unto them I will now put forth a riddle unto you if you can certainly declare it with me within seven days of the feast and find out then I will give you 30 sheets of garment and I will give you 30 sheets of garment and change it at 30 sheets which is a linen garment and 30 changes of garments but if you cannot declare it unto me then ye shall give me 30 sheets and 30 changes of garment and they shall and they said unto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear and he said unto them out of the eater came forth meat in other translations out of the eater came forth something to eat and out of the strong came forth sweetness and they couldn't Solve the Riddle and it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto Samson's wife enticed thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire have ye called have you called us to take that we have is it not so basically have you invited us to to come to this party we come all this way where your friends we're high up in the Philistine Society now you creep in now we have to all give this guy a bunch of changes of clothes now listen and if you don't do it we're going to burn your family and Samson's wife wept before him and said thou Dost but hate me and loves me not and thou put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and Hast not told it to me and he said unto her behold I have not told it to my father my mother and shall I tell it to thee you see the pressure that this young lady she didn't understand and she wept before him seven days and while their feast lasted and it came to pass on the seventh day he told her because she lay sore upon him and she told them the riddle she and he and she told the riddle to the children of her people and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down they answered the riddle what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion Samson knew exactly how they heard the answer because he only told one person and he was mad he was upset he was so upset he said forget it I'm leaving and he walked away not only did he walk to walk away he walked 20 miles fuming I can't believe what has happened and he's walking mile by mile and fuming and going along the road talk about road rage you would not have wanted to get in the way of Samson right now he was upset so you know what he does he walks to this 20 miles to this other Philistine City sees 30 Philistines and he kills them takes off their clothes takes off their linen garment comes back here 's my payment still upset goes back home then he starts they start fighting they start killing people he takes the Israelites they um they're upset Sampson I believe this is where the the yeah that's what happened they um so so the Philistines they they come and they kill Samson's wife he'd the father-in-law had given his daughter to another man Samson's even more upset they they kill the father they kill the girl they're upset that Samson's been killing all these people he catches foxes catches like 150 foxes ties their tail together puts a torch in the middle sets them loose through the crops they burn all the crops and so it starts this big battle between Samson and the Philistines he keeps getting angrier and angrier and finally his own people he goes back home to Israel his own people sell him out they bind him with ropes and they put him in a place where the Philistines can come get him and he's out in this field and the Philistines a thousand Philistines come walking up Samson rips open the by the bounds takes finds this Jawbone of a donkey there and kills a thousand Philistines a thousand and he throws he's sitting there and he throws the Jawbone on the ground and he's tired and he's thirsty the spirit of the Lord was upon Samson and then the spirit of the Lord leaves Samson and he's sitting he's sitting there he throws his Jawbone down and he's thirsty imagine this man that had just killed a thousand Philistines with the Jawbone of a donkey and he's dying of thirst it shows you when the spirit of the Lord comes off of you you can do anything when the spirit of the Lord is on you but when the spirit of the Lord comes off of you just a few cups of water you're lacking and you'll die and we we get excited and like last weekend we had such a powerful service the Lord was with us we hear all of these testimonies and then the spirit of the Lord maybe leaves us but God doesn't leave us no matter how much and Samson was all worried about it he said Lord you you gave me this great Victory now I'm dying of thirst God the anointing was off of him God opens up the ground and the spring comes forward and Samson drinks from the spring he just goes to show us the anointing may be on you or it may not be on you but God's still there with you in both places God did a miracle for Samson so then Samson goes and he judges Israel for 20 years and then later on 20 years later we see this weakness from Samson come back where he falls in love with another Philistine girl he falls in love with another girl that was just going to do him harm this girl's name was Delilah you see the dangers again yoking ourselves up with people that that aren't believers and um you get married there has to be that Foundation friends there has to be there has to be a foundation of the word there has to be that love between you and you have to have Jesus Christ in in your marriage or it's going to end like what you're going to what you're going to hear about right now over and over this woman these these Philistines go to this woman they offer 5500 shekels of silver to find how Samson is so strong it just goes to show you that Samson wasn't a big strong man with these huge biceps and this ripped bodybuilder because it was OB it would be obvious where his strength came from then but he must have been just a small man Normal Man because she asks him where does your strength come from so she manipulates him three times she goes through they had offered her 5500 shekels of silver which is probably in the millions of dollars and she finally finds that Samson's strength was in that vow that he had made before the Lord in his hair you know the story they cut off Samson's hair and he is defeated by this Philistine Army these Philistine Warriors brother Branham said Samson gave his strength to God but he gave his heart to Delilah it was the son of a woman that made him weak like any other man and he forsook the one thing that God told him never to do until the day he had he died he cut his hair which was an outward expression that he was no longer a separated vessel for the Lord now he was just like any other Hebrew man so they captured him they gouged out his eyes he's humiliated he gave credit they gave credit to their God Dagon for the conquest over Jehovah's servant Samson they paraded him around showing their victory over the enemy and the Philistines they wanted everyone to see the fall of this man so they set him up they paraded him around and you see that same Spirit today in social media and YouTube and in Facebook and and they love to see someone fail especially someone in the ministry especially a Christian be careful for us when one of us fails and we all fail be careful about talking about it like these Philistines did and they they want to raise this up and say look at the failure so here's Samson he's going and he three thousand he goes to the stadium so there's 3 000 people around and they're gathered to see this Fallen Hero Samson was blind he was weak and he was led by a child and he had plenty of time to think about that hair that was cut off and it was starting to grow back but more importantly than the hair growing back he had repented of his sins he knew he was wrong and even the greatest of God's servants fall but the truly great ones Adam Abraham and Moses and David and Peter and Paul those those are the ones who fall but they're able to get back up after they're falling Hebrews chapter 11. says this verse 32. what and what shall I more say of the time would fail me to tell if Gideon and a Barrack and of Samson and of jephthah and of David also in Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms right righteousness obtain promise stop the mouth of lions quench the violence of the fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant infight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and the others were and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection and others had trial of cruel markings and scourgings Yea moreover a bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sought asunder were tempted we're slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute Afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy that includes this man Samson they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves in the earth and all these things having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us you and me that they without us should not be made perfect on his weakness Sampson asked the Lord for strength I'll close with this the musicians would make their way judges 16 28 and Samson called out unto the Lord and said oh Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be at once Avenged of the Philistines from my two eyes there were two pillars in the center of the structure that supported the framework Sampson Place one hand on one pillar and the other hand on the other and he said Lord let me die with these Philistines he bowed and pushed himself pushed those pillars aside one hand on each column the whole structure came down and killed three thousand Philistines remember his commission at the beginning was to protect Israel from the Philistines and here is Samson even in his death especially in his death he killed more Philistines than he did in his entire life I know I went through the story quickly but what I wanted to say what I wanted to to get to was he died a penitent broken humble and strong person his greatest accomplish accomplishment was not the Jawbone of the donkey it wasn't the killing the lion it wasn't embarrassing the Philistines in the name of the Lord it was his death that Samson accomplished more than he did in his entire life he was commissioned of the Lord to fight these Philistines we are in this day commissioned by the Lord to fight Satan and we have to the way that we do that is we put God first as Samson did we fail as Samson did but we put God first and when we are commissioned when we know that we are in the will of the lord we can stand there and say Bring It On Samson took that Jawbone killed a thousand of them and there he was called the Jawbone Hill there's a name that he called it in the Bible got thirsty the anointing had left in me threw down the Jawbone he said Lord I'm dying you just had this great Victory but Lord I'm dying I need help and then God was there also after the Revival after after this great move of God he was still there even when we felt that he wasn't there and he's there with us even if we feel he's not he opened up the ground water came forth then he made a he made another error but in his death was the greatest moment of his whole life when we talk about giving our lives to the Lord we talk about how Lord I want to die out to myself that's a Christian way Lord I want to die to the things that I want I want to die to my desires of the world Lord I want to be that servant to you Lord I want to be able to stand against the enemy I want to have that relation to you with you well we have to die not in the flesh anymore but die in the spirit die that this old man is put away and now Lord I'm a New Creation in you that's why we're baptized sister that's why you were baptized last week is to die out to that old person and now enter in to this new person that wants to serve God that is commissioned by God to do his will that's why I look at Samson and as I read that story over and over and over I thought the greatest thing for Samson was not all of these things that he did it was that he died and with his death came down all of these Philistines and I love I just love it when it says that he sought an occasion against the Philistines he wanted an opportunity to go to battle I think that's where a Christian should be today we want that opportunity Lord I prayed Lord I believe your word yeah Mike Sampson I have other things wrong with me but I'm trying I'm anointed I want to be in your word and then you can come before Satan and say Bring It On Satan no no because this is not me fighting the battle as Samson said he said Lord you won this battle not me and that's where we are we place our lives before the Lord and say you won the battle and here I am I'm dying out to myself like Samson did and the Beautiful story of a warning be careful who you marry be careful the boy or the girl young man young lady who you date because it could end up very very badly use this as a warning as Samson did Lord I want to be in your will you have time I want to be in your will and we look at Samson's greatest failure was the weakness he had through his whole life was this woman delightly like the way she looked he liked the worldly way that she had she was not a Christian and he ended up dying for it she didn't have the same values that Samson had foreign to develop those battles those values just because you give your heart to the Lord there is a time of testing take your time be careful who you yoke yourself up with because the consequences are great as they were with this man Samson I think about Paul as I close I think about the Apostle Paul and this morning I I just wept it was early in the morning I was sitting in my chair and I was thinking about Samson and he was blind his eyes gouged out this great man and how bad that he looked going going up to those pillars being led by the child everybody laughing at him whether it be like today it'd be a Facebook or or whatever the social media would be laughing at this man and here he is a disgraced sinner going up there and being ridiculed putting his hands on those pillars I thought oh Lord you never forsake us no matter how bad we've done no matter what mistakes we've made you will never forsake us we forsake you we leave you like Samson did he kept leaving but God was always there even to where he's like here here's some water if you need it whatever you need I will provide I look at Paul the Apostle Paul was just as bad as Samson there he is going to Damascus he's killing these Christians he's fighting these Christians and he gets struck down he becomes blind and there he is blind in this room and not knowing like Lord what what did I do there's the blind man and the Lord comes to this man named ananias and he says these beautiful words he says ananias he says go to Paul for he prayeth for he's praying I thought how important was Paul's prayer that blind man and here comes ananias he prays for him the Lord restores his sight and he becomes the one of the greatest men that have ever lived because he gave his heart to the Lord and Paul was willing to die to himself and put God first in all things I have communion tonight [Music] think about [Music] the one that that came that everything points to this man Jesus Christ his body was torn that bread represents that torn body the wine represents his blood that was shed think about that as we go tonight put him first in everything in your life I promise you you will be happy if you do the Lord will take care of you will you do it will you put God first will you die to yourself [Music]

they're not they're not in this book just for just for entertainment they're here for us they're here for us to relate to Samson and I ask you do you want to be a Samson or do you want to be a Delilah do you want to be a Paul or do you want to be an anus the high priest I want to be one of these servants I look at Samson what a man he was what faith that he had ripping that line that Lion in shreds and and it is it is kind of funny how they won the they won the riddle and he just goes and kills a bunch of them and takes their clothes off and of the dead people and gives them to these other people I love the way God does things he's he's God he's Sovereign he loves us and he'll provide for us if we trust him let's bow our heads [Music] Heavenly Father first Lord let me ask if you're dealing with somebody in service today if if your spirit is on someone if father if there's a repentant soul that's here Lord I pray for that person [Music] the father that you would touch them [Music] Lord I don't know I am I don't know what to pray I just feel that there may be [Music] someone in this congregation Lord maybe many maybe maybe two maybe three maybe one that are reaching out to you I pray that the hand of God would come down the spirit of God the same one Lord the same one that anointed Sampson on on that day when he picked up the Jawbone [Music] that same spirit There's Been Through the Ages Lord I say I pray that that same Spirit would be here and would anoint Lord your child that's seeking you you would have a relationship knowing that it may be a great battle or

a champion Jesus was the champion he did it all he was the one that was there with Samson he was the one there was there with Samuel he was the one that was there with with Moses and all of them and

if you want to change I suggest that you do it right now that you make that commitment that Samson did when he put his hands on those walls and he said Lord let me die I suggest you do the same thing Lord let me die to myself and let these walls of this world come down around me and let God Heath raise it up because he is able let's just let's sing for a couple more minutes and as I said friends
