[32:53] this morning.
[32:56] Brother Jordan's on the road. Brother
[32:58] Aaron's sick as as you heard. And then
[33:00] brother Lyall is also on the road. So
[33:02] it's uh but thank the Lord that we have
[33:05] other brothers that can step in. I uh I
[33:09] got to admit this morning I as I always
[33:11] do I work
[33:14] all week pretty much on a uh on a sermon
[33:19] and which I did this week and uh I was
[33:23] finishing up last night and uh got it.
[33:27] It felt felt pretty good. And uh then I
[33:30] was up all night
[33:32] as often I am on Saturday night worrying
[33:38] and and I woke up this morning and uh
[33:43] went back and started going over it and
[33:47] uh I just felt like no
[33:51] it's uh it's it's not the direction I
[33:54] don't think the Lord wanted to go. And
[33:56] what I did is I I had during the week I
[34:00] I wanted to start in this book uh these
[34:04] two letters from the Apostle Paul to
[34:06] Timothy
[34:08] and I
[34:11] just enjoy them so much. I think they
[34:13] are very very they're very pointed and
[34:16] they're very applicable to today. And I
[34:20] I wanted to get started. I wanted to
[34:22] preach on some of the things that Paul
[34:23] said to Timothy. And in August, I'm
[34:26] hoping that we can go through like we do
[34:28] sometime line by line in the book of
[34:31] Timothy, first and second Timothy, and
[34:33] go through some of the things Paul said.
[34:36] And I'm hoping to do that in the ne in
[34:39] in next month if the Lord's willing. The
[34:43] key is the Lord's willing. And the Bible
[34:45] says, Paul says at least once, he says
[34:47] God willing. And that's one thing we
[34:49] want to make sure if God is willing. And
[34:51] what I had planned this morning is I uh
[34:55] kind of went down a rabbit hole this
[34:56] week. Um I uh somebody sent me a a video
[35:01] so of a of a preacher preaching and and
[35:06] boy, I didn't like it. It really
[35:09] bothered me.
[35:11] And then you know YouTube is so good at
[35:15] what it does that algorithm. And then so
[35:18] I I wrote down a few things that that
[35:20] preacher said and then another one comes
[35:22] up. I was like, I'll scrub into that
[35:23] one. I I get down in that one. And I
[35:26] didn't like what what that preacher
[35:28] said. So I started writing down all
[35:30] these things that that these ministers
[35:33] had said. Of course, I wasn't going to
[35:34] mention their names. And and I mean,
[35:36] they're
[35:38] brothers that some of you probably know.
[35:41] And I uh so I I started jotting those
[35:44] down and I and I started comparing them
[35:46] to what Timothy said in his in his book
[35:49] or uh to what Paul said in his letter to
[35:51] Timothy. And it was like this is this is
[35:53] exactly what Paul was saying to stay
[35:56] away from and and I I was I was writing
[36:00] those down and then I woke up this
[36:02] morning and and I was worried all night,
[36:04] Lord, do I say it? I'm not going to
[36:05] mention any names, but but then I I got
[36:08] to the point where I felt like Lord just
[36:11] said just just read them the Bible
[36:15] and then I will deal with them. And I
[36:19] thought, you know what, that's right.
[36:20] And and and since I've been thinking
[36:22] about it, what good is that going to do
[36:25] for this group of people?
[36:28] It would it wouldn't have been for you
[36:29] all. It would have been for the ones
[36:31] that are watching the video.
[36:33] And
[36:35] my job is here.
[36:37] My job is is to encourage you all.
[36:48] Why do we do things? You know, we we we
[36:52] do things
[36:54] because we have to look at our motives.
[36:57] And when we read the scripture, I I
[37:00] think the biggest mistake, by the way,
[37:02] if you see me scrolling on my notes,
[37:06] it's because I'm skipping a bunch of the
[37:08] stuff that I plan to say. So, yeah, it's
[37:12] doesn't need to be said. But why do we
[37:15] read the scriptures? We read the
[37:17] scriptures so that we can get closer to
[37:22] God. But so often we read the scriptures
[37:24] and and Timothy warns us. So many people
[37:28] read the scriptures and they read into
[37:31] it what they want. So they they'll take
[37:34] a scripture and then they'll apply it to
[37:37] something that they already think and it
[37:39] sways the scriptures in the wrong way
[37:42] and it's not the original meaning. So
[37:45] when we read the scriptures, it is not
[37:48] we should never ask oursel or somebody
[37:50] else what does this scripture mean to
[37:52] you. What we should ask is what does
[37:56] this scripture mean? Period.
[37:59] Because the original author had a reason
[38:03] for writing the scriptures and it was a
[38:05] specific reason. It wasn't something
[38:08] that could be interpreted and changed
[38:11] over time. It's something that that is
[38:14] pointed and directed and it has a
[38:17] meaning. I appreciated our our Bible
[38:20] study
[38:22] with the kids yesterday and and I want
[38:24] to do it more often. I appreciate some
[38:26] of the candacy that that some of them
[38:28] had in sharing their testimonies and
[38:31] some some great discussions.
[38:34] And I think what what I always try to
[38:38] get across
[38:40] and I'm if I'm ministering here, if I'm
[38:43] teaching a Bible study or if I'm just
[38:45] talking one on-one is God wants he has a
[38:49] desire to speak directly to you without
[38:54] a mediator in between.
[38:58] And and Paul in his letter to in both of
[39:00] his letters to Timothy, he's hitting
[39:02] that hard. He wants to God wants to
[39:05] speak to us. The question came up last
[39:07] night. Well, does God send Old Testament
[39:10] prophets today?
[39:14] And it's a it's a good question. And I
[39:16] think many of us believe, yeah, that
[39:18] that he sends great prophets. And I and
[39:20] I even said afterwards, someone asked me
[39:23] and I said, "Yeah, no, there's great
[39:25] prophets that are even prophesied to
[39:27] come now in Revelation
[39:29] 11 that there are men that that are
[39:33] going to come that have the power of
[39:35] Moses and Elijah, the power to shut up
[39:37] the heavens, the power to turn the water
[39:39] into blood. They h they come and they
[39:42] are prophesied to come." So, no, God
[39:44] didn't cut that out. But I quoted
[39:46] Hebrews chapter um Hebrews chapter 1 I
[39:51] believe it is and I quoted to the youth.
[39:53] I said it says God who had sundre times
[39:58] and in diverse manners. God who in old
[40:00] times in diverse manners spake in times
[40:04] past
[40:06] by the prophets
[40:08] hath in this last day spoken by his son
[40:13] by whom he created the worlds.
[40:16] So what does that mean? Not what does it
[40:18] mean to you?
[40:20] What does that mean? And I asked the
[40:23] youth, I said, "So if you look at this,
[40:26] do you want God to speak to me? Do you
[40:31] want to ask God something and do you
[40:33] want the answer to come from God through
[40:35] me to you or through another person? Or
[40:39] do you want the answer to come directly
[40:41] from God to you?
[40:45] What do you want?
[40:47] Do you want it to come through me? Do
[40:50] you want it to come through another man?
[40:52] Or do you want an answer directly from
[40:54] God?
[40:56] People have made the mistake throughout
[40:57] history. No, we want someone between us
[41:00] and God.
[41:02] Great mistake with Moses.
[41:05] They said, "Let not God speak lest we
[41:08] die, but let Moses speak." They did the
[41:11] same thing with Samuel.
[41:13] When God tells Samuel, he said, "Samuel,
[41:16] they have not forsaken you." Remember
[41:19] when Sam when the people wanted a king
[41:22] and Samuel got offended
[41:24] and he and and he was he was upset and
[41:26] he's like, "Well, you know, have I stole
[41:28] your money? Have I done any of this?"
[41:29] And God goes to Samuel. He said,
[41:31] "Samuel, listen. They haven't forsaken
[41:33] you. They have forsaken me.
[41:37] They have not forsaken you, Samuel.
[41:42] They're all about you.
[41:44] They've forsaken me.
[41:47] I'm the one that they forgot about in
[41:49] putting a man
[41:51] between me and the people, between God
[41:55] and the people. They always want
[41:57] somebody in there. And that's just the
[42:00] nature of people. I was
[42:04] And it doesn't mean that God doesn't
[42:06] send prophets. It doesn't mean that God
[42:08] doesn't send gifts into the church. Of
[42:09] course, he does. These gifts are are
[42:12] prophesied to come. God sends a gift.
[42:14] He'll send a gift of a prophet for a
[42:17] warning for a a a widescale warning that
[42:20] judgment is coming. That's what that's
[42:22] what he does with prophets from the
[42:24] beginning until now. He sends that. But
[42:26] every day God wants to deal with his
[42:30] people oneonone.
[42:33] That's like me reading the scriptures
[42:35] this morning. Just read it, friends. And
[42:38] you take it in.
[42:41] I'll talk about it. But ultimately, it
[42:44] is you that has to have that
[42:47] relationship. It is you that God has to
[42:49] give that interpretation. It can't come
[42:51] through anyone else.
[42:54] Your relationship with God cannot come
[42:56] through a pastor, a priest. It can't
[42:58] come through a prophet. It can't come
[43:00] through mom, and it can't come through
[43:02] dad.
[43:03] It has to come directly between you and
[43:07] God himself. And there is one mediator
[43:09] between God and manesus.
[43:15] Jesus.
[43:18] I gave a tour of the church yesterday.
[43:21] Some It's really neat testimony of um
[43:25] Zyra had been witnessing to uh um some
[43:30] folks and they said, "Yeah, our church
[43:33] is at Stone and Hento."
[43:36] And Zara's like, "So's our church."
[43:40] They're going back and forth. I don't
[43:42] know, however they communicate. She's
[43:44] like, "Do you go to our church?"
[43:48] And and as they were talking to each
[43:50] other, "No, they're they're the the
[43:53] church right across the street that uh
[43:55] we've been a couple times at the
[43:56] brothers over there." And they uh they
[44:01] they came in. Some of the youth came in.
[44:03] It was really really neat. Oh, there's
[44:04] Zyra. Sorry. Jar and Joseph. Yeah, I
[44:06] wasn't didn't see you there. Um, but uh
[44:10] it it was really cool testimony about
[44:12] how all that worked out. And so we gave
[44:16] him a tour yesterday
[44:19] and uh we walked around the building and
[44:22] this was just a a very sweet young lady
[44:25] and a young man. They were the the son
[44:27] and the daughter of the pastor that's
[44:30] just right over here across the street.
[44:33] and uh very fine fine kids. I mean,
[44:36] first class. You can tell they've been
[44:37] raised, right? And uh we came in, we we
[44:40] showed them the stuff that we're doing
[44:41] and uh and the different projects that
[44:43] we have going on. And we brought them
[44:44] into the sanctuary
[44:47] and uh they were like, "Oh, wow. You
[44:49] know, this is this is really beautiful."
[44:51] And and I said, "Yeah." I said, "It
[44:54] seats about 400 people uh just here in
[44:58] the sanctuary. Then we can add more
[45:00] people up there." I said, 'But we're
[45:03] when we're full on Sunday morning, we're
[45:06] usually less than 200 people. And uh the
[45:10] young lady said,
[45:12] she said, well, she says, you know, she
[45:14] said, someone gave a prophecy in our
[45:16] church that as many chairs that you have
[45:18] that that the Lord will fill those fill
[45:21] those up. She says, so so I'm sure that
[45:23] the Lord's just going to fill this
[45:24] church up and there's going to be more
[45:26] way more than 400 people. And Zia was
[45:29] there. She can witness. I said, you
[45:30] know, I said, that's not really what I
[45:32] want. I said, really, if I just had 20
[45:36] people
[45:38] that really would give their hearts to
[45:40] Jesus Christ, that would really love
[45:44] him, that would really surrender to him.
[45:48] I said, I'd be happy. I said, and not
[45:51] that that we're not, but I said, it's
[45:53] not about numbers. And it really isn't.
[45:57] We we think the world today
[46:01] makes us think about numbers and and and
[46:03] bigger is better. And the bigger your
[46:05] bank account is, the the the better you
[46:07] are. And and uh if you're a supervisor,
[46:10] the more people you supervise, the
[46:11] better you are. If if you're a pastor in
[46:13] a church, the more people that you have
[46:15] in the church, the better the you that
[46:17] you are. It's all about numbers. And
[46:18] that's what the world teaches us today.
[46:20] But that's not God's way of doing
[46:22] things. There was a pastor that uh in
[46:26] again in this local community that I
[46:28] gave a tour to him and he looked and he
[46:30] just got a little church of uh like 15
[46:33] people. And he came in and he says,
[46:35] "Oh," he says, he says, "I look at your
[46:37] church." And he says, "I see all these
[46:39] people parked out there and parking on
[46:41] the streets." And he said, "All all
[46:43] these people coming in." And he says, "I
[46:45] just think, oh Lord, this is this is
[46:47] just my dream. This is what I want."
[46:51] That's not the way to think about it,
[46:53] friends. That's the world.
[46:57] That's the the the idea of the world is
[47:00] the more, the better, the bigger, the
[47:02] better. But that's not the way God is.
[47:04] He He has his way of doing things. And
[47:09] it doesn't teach us that. We We read the
[47:12] Bible. And when we read, we should
[47:16] really
[47:17] seek out Lord, what is this scripture
[47:21] saying?
[47:23] And then if you don't if it doesn't
[47:25] come, then get down on your knees and
[47:28] pray and don't just read over it. Don't
[47:30] just move on to the next one. If you
[47:32] don't understand a scripture or
[47:34] something really strikes your heart and
[47:36] it says and and something in your heart
[47:37] says, "I'm not living up to this." Don't
[47:40] do like so many people like is so common
[47:43] and just you just ignore that part and
[47:46] you only read the ones that support the
[47:49] your way of thinking. That's not what
[47:51] the scriptures are for. They are here
[47:53] for correction. They are here for
[47:55] doctrine. They are here to to help us.
[47:59] That's what the Bible is. It is the
[48:01] absolute. It is the greatest thing in
[48:03] the world. And it is just life is in
[48:06] there. But life also is comes from
[48:09] correction.
[48:11] And I I was thinking about I I had this
[48:15] way back. I had this when I was at UVA
[48:19] studying. I had this class
[48:22] that it wasn't a core class. Any of you
[48:26] students
[48:27] just do what I say, don't do as I do.
[48:30] Don't follow my example on this. But I
[48:33] had this class and it was one of those
[48:36] classes that you have to take. It wasn't
[48:38] an engineering class. It was just one of
[48:39] those things that I had to check a box.
[48:42] three three I think it's three or four
[48:44] credit class but it was a literature
[48:47] class and we had to read uh these
[48:50] certain books and then we would take a
[48:52] test
[48:54] on those on those books and we had essay
[48:58] essay questions and then we would have
[49:01] to answer the questions and it was like
[49:03] when this certain thing happened what
[49:05] was the author trying to get across to
[49:07] the reader and I remember I think it was
[49:11] Lord of the Flies
[49:13] that uh that one of the books that we
[49:15] had to read. I didn't read any of the
[49:18] books. I didn't even buy the books. I
[49:21] didn't even go to the class. I went to
[49:24] the first class and then I showed up at
[49:26] each test. I could care less about it.
[49:30] And what I did the first time I go in
[49:31] there and it's like, okay, we have a
[49:33] test on this date. We have the syllabus.
[49:34] It's like, okay, I got to show up on
[49:36] this date to take the test. And I would
[49:38] read the footnotes. And then I would
[49:40] take the take the test and the the
[49:43] instructor the the the test would say
[49:46] what did the author mean about this or
[49:48] or I remember one question on Lord of
[49:51] the Flies. It was what does this say
[49:53] about human nature?
[49:56] And I was like okay. And I was a pretty
[49:59] good writer. I could put my stuff
[50:01] together. So I said, "Well, it says that
[50:05] at the end, you know, that they get
[50:07] rescued and it shows that human nature
[50:09] is inherently good because of this." And
[50:11] I I laid all of these things out. And if
[50:14] you've ever read that book, I I never
[50:16] read the book, but later on I saw the
[50:18] movie. I was like, "My
[50:20] answer wasn't so good."
[50:23] But when I answered, I put everything
[50:25] together and I remember the the
[50:29] professor said, "Interesting
[50:30] perspective.
[50:33] and I got like a B
[50:37] and it was completely wrong.
[50:40] It was like the opposite of what the the
[50:42] author wanted to say that the human
[50:44] nature is inherently bad
[50:47] and that when when everybody gets
[50:49] together the strongest spirit wins and
[50:53] in this case the strongest spirit in
[50:55] Lord of the Flies was evil. So evil was
[50:57] triumphing over good. That was the me
[51:00] meaning of the book. I know that because
[51:01] I saw the movie.
[51:05] But I wrote in there, here's what it
[51:08] means. And I had no idea. That author
[51:11] did not want what I said to come across.
[51:14] But the fact is, I didn't put the time
[51:16] in. I didn't really care. It didn't
[51:18] matter to me. And I think so often we
[51:20] can apply that to the word. So often we
[51:23] look at the word and we're just looking
[51:24] at the word for what we want. We're just
[51:27] looking at the word for what we want,
[51:29] what we need to justify ourselves
[51:31] instead of what it really means. And
[51:34] it's a shame. And I would say that many,
[51:39] maybe most
[51:41] people that are listening to a sermon or
[51:45] reading the Bible are looking for
[51:47] something that justifies themselves
[51:50] rather than looking for something that
[51:52] brings correction.
[51:54] I this this book of Timothy,
[51:58] it's a warning to this young minister,
[52:02] the first the first and the second books
[52:04] of Timothy. And and it's Paul is telling
[52:06] them that there's coming a time when
[52:08] people are going to be in all of this
[52:10] for themselves
[52:12] rather really than what Jesus taught.
[52:16] And Jesus really he taught us to put
[52:19] away the old man. He taught us to let go
[52:22] of what the world teaches us, which is
[52:25] to serve ourselves.
[52:28] That's the world today that we live in
[52:30] is serve yourself. Make yourself happy.
[52:34] You got to love yourself before you can
[52:36] love someone else. How many times you
[52:38] hear that? It's false.
[52:41] It's not what the Bible teaches.
[52:44] That's what the world teaches us today.
[52:47] And it teaches us also just to get as
[52:50] much as you can out of this life. Go and
[52:53] just grab as much as you're going
[52:54] through life. Get as much as you can and
[52:57] don't give away. And Paul,
[53:01] the Lord Jesus teaches, he said, "Put
[53:04] away the old man.
[53:07] Let go of what the world teaches us to
[53:10] serve ourselves. Let put away that old
[53:13] man and put on the new man and give your
[53:15] life for others."
[53:17] is what Christ taught. But the world
[53:20] teaches us something different. And it
[53:22] teaches us a frame of mind to where
[53:26] everything including going to church,
[53:29] including reading the Bible, including
[53:31] work or whatever it is, every single
[53:34] thing that we do is to serve ourselves.
[53:39] Everything is for our own benefit.
[53:44] So really Paul lays the foundational
[53:47] warnings for these things. And
[53:52] really our way of thinking,
[53:56] Proverbs 3 says, "Let not mercy and
[53:58] truth forsake thee. Bind them about thy
[54:01] neck. Write them upon the table of thine
[54:03] heart. So shalt thou find favor and good
[54:07] understanding in the sight of God. Trust
[54:09] in the Lord with all thy heart, and lead
[54:11] not unto thine own understanding. In all
[54:14] thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall
[54:16] direct thy path.
[54:18] Be wise, be not wise in your own eyes.
[54:23] Fear the Lord and depart from evil. But
[54:26] instead of trusting God and give every
[54:29] everything we had have to God, we really
[54:32] we trust in ourselves and we trust in
[54:35] our own understanding of the scriptures
[54:37] rather than seeking him and seeking his
[54:39] understanding.
[54:41] Jesus said, "Greater love has no man
[54:46] than he laid down his life for his
[54:49] friends." And that is a Christian. That
[54:52] is Christianity. It's not what the world
[54:55] teaches us in getting all that you can.
[54:59] There's a I had a funny experience
[55:03] uh I don't know less than a year ago. My
[55:05] Stephanie and uh the kids and I went to
[55:08] Hawaii and there's some Hawaiians here
[55:11] and the Hawaiian culture is really
[55:14] really neat. So we uh we get there and
[55:18] and we're driving along and it's rush
[55:20] hour. We're on the island of Kauaii.
[55:23] It's rush hour and there's two lanes.
[55:26] There's four lanes
[55:28] and there's there's two lanes obviously
[55:30] going this way and two lanes coming this
[55:32] way. So I pull out and I turn left
[55:37] and traffic is just backed up for what
[55:41] seemed like miles, but they were all in
[55:43] one lane. And then there's this other
[55:46] lane over here that didn't have anybody
[55:48] in it. So I pulled in immediately. It's
[55:50] like, okay, well, I'm just going to go
[55:52] down this lane. So, I'm cruising along
[55:54] this lane and I'm like, why isn't
[55:56] anybody in this lane? Why are they all
[55:58] stopped in that lane? And then I look
[56:01] down the road and I see that there's a
[56:04] sign in my lane merged into traffic.
[56:09] And I was like, "Oh no,
[56:13] I look like a major jerk."
[56:17] Here I am zooming by everybody like
[56:20] yahoo. I'm going I'm in my lane. I'm
[56:22] making time. And they're sitting in
[56:24] traffic and they are respecting one
[56:26] another
[56:28] and putting one another in treating each
[56:31] other like they would want to be
[56:33] treated. And here's the white boy
[56:34] cruising along in the in the lane that
[56:38] they knew was going to was going to
[56:40] merge. And when I finally figured it
[56:43] out, I looked and all these Hawaiians
[56:46] were looking at me like,
[56:48] "Yeah, there's one of the tourists.
[56:51] That's the That's the way they act." Am
[56:53] I right, bro? We got a bunch of
[56:56] Hawaiians over here.
[56:58] Am I right?
[57:04] But it I didn't know.
[57:08] But that is how we act in this world. We
[57:12] want to get ahead of the next guy
[57:14] instead of just waiting in line, waiting
[57:17] in our lane. I felt terrible. I wanted
[57:19] to go back. I wanted to put it in
[57:21] reverse and go back a half a mile and
[57:23] remember the car that I pulled out uh
[57:27] behind and get behind that guy. But
[57:30] that's the way that we live our lives.
[57:32] That's the way the world teaches us is
[57:34] get ahead. Take as much as you can. Get
[57:37] ahead of that. get ahead of the next
[57:38] guy. And we really we read our Bible
[57:40] with the same attitude. What can I get
[57:43] out of this book that serves me? And
[57:45] what what what can I get out of this
[57:47] book that makes my life better? Rather
[57:49] than reading it for what the author
[57:52] meant, which is how can I give more of
[57:55] myself? How can I give more of my
[57:57] resources, Lord? How can I give how can
[58:01] I give you or give your people? Josiah
[58:04] sings that song. I give myself away.
[58:07] What does that mean? We just sing it
[58:09] because it's nice. It's a nice worship
[58:11] song. That's Christianity. Give yourself
[58:14] away. Lord, how can I give more? Not
[58:17] take more. Lord, how can I give more?
[58:21] So, listen how Paul's letter
[58:25] to Timothy. It starts 1 Timothy chapter
[58:28] 1 says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
[58:32] by the com by the commandment of God our
[58:34] savior and the Lord Jesus Christ which
[58:36] is our hope unto Timothy my own son in
[58:39] the faith grace mercy and peace from God
[58:42] our father and Jesus Christ our Lord as
[58:45] I besought thee to abide still at
[58:47] Ephesus when I went to Macedonia that
[58:50] thou mightest charge some as they teach
[58:54] no other doctrine
[58:57] Right? Paul's jumping right into it.
[58:59] Don't teach any other doctrine. Don't
[59:02] teach all this stuff that just separates
[59:05] the people that lift something else
[59:07] above Christ. Don't teach any of that.
[59:09] Neither give heed to fables and endless
[59:11] genealogies which minister questions
[59:14] rather than godly edifying which is in
[59:18] faith. So do
[59:21] now. The end of the commandment is
[59:23] charity.
[59:25] out of a pure heart and of good
[59:27] conscience and of faith unfeign. So I
[59:31] say in the end of all this the end of
[59:32] the commandment the goal of all this is
[59:35] love. English standards version says the
[59:38] aim of our charge is love that issues
[59:42] from a pure heart that comes from a pure
[59:45] heart and a good conscience and sincere
[59:47] faith.
[59:50] Now listen to this. From which some
[59:53] having swerved have turned aside under
[59:56] vain jangling.
[59:58] Certain persons by swerving from these
[1:00:00] have wandered away into vain
[1:00:03] discussions.
[1:00:04] A vain discussion is this discussion
[1:00:06] about themselves.
[1:00:08] It's a discussion that lifts theirelves
[1:00:10] up. It it lifts their own revelation up.
[1:00:13] It lifts up themselves which is the
[1:00:15] opposite of Christ who lowered himself
[1:00:17] as a servant. Instead of saying what can
[1:00:21] this do for me or what does this script
[1:00:24] scripture have to do with me? Instead it
[1:00:26] should say we should say but what is
[1:00:28] this scripture telling me to do? Instead
[1:00:32] we have t teachers that have turned to
[1:00:36] things that are vanity.
[1:00:39] I'm going to skip a lot of these quotes
[1:00:41] here.
[1:00:45] Verse number seven.
[1:00:47] They're desiring to be teachers of the
[1:00:49] law,
[1:00:52] understanding neither what they say nor
[1:00:53] where have they affirm.
[1:00:55] They're desiring to be teachers without
[1:00:58] understanding either of what they are
[1:01:00] saying or what or the things that they
[1:01:02] are talking about. And they're making
[1:01:04] these confident assertions. They're
[1:01:06] they're they're acting like they know
[1:01:08] what they're talking about and they're
[1:01:10] bringing in these weird these strange
[1:01:12] doctrines. And really, it's all about
[1:01:14] lifting up a group or lifting up
[1:01:16] themselves or the apostle or the prophet
[1:01:19] or or the priest or the pastor lifting
[1:01:21] up himself.
[1:01:23] And they're so confident in what they're
[1:01:25] saying, but they really have no idea
[1:01:27] what they're talking about.
[1:01:30] It's some new revelation or it's
[1:01:32] something that raises us above someone
[1:01:35] else so that we can drive in the turning
[1:01:38] lane and get ahead of everyone else
[1:01:42] so we can get on board first. We have a
[1:01:44] one-way ticket to heaven. We have we
[1:01:46] have all of these these things because
[1:01:47] we are special instead of the true
[1:01:50] meaning which is to fall in line with
[1:01:52] the scriptures and don't make it about
[1:01:55] yourself.
[1:01:57] 1 Timothy chapter 2
[1:02:00] verse 5 says this.
[1:02:04] For there is one God and one mediator
[1:02:06] between God and men, the man Christ
[1:02:09] Jesus, who gave himself
[1:02:12] a ransom for all to be testified in due
[1:02:15] time, where unto I am ordained a
[1:02:18] preacher and an apostle. I speak the
[1:02:19] truth in Christ and I lie not, a teacher
[1:02:23] of the Gentiles in faith and varity. I
[1:02:25] will therefore that men pray everywhere
[1:02:27] lifting up holy hands without wrath and
[1:02:30] without doubting. That's the gospel.
[1:02:32] That's the truth. But from that they
[1:02:35] have turned aside under this vain
[1:02:38] jangling under these words that really
[1:02:39] they don't mean anything. They're just
[1:02:42] they're they're confusing and they're
[1:02:43] these never- ending discussions.
[1:02:46] And Paul lays it out here very simply
[1:02:49] that just pray everywhere lifting up
[1:02:52] your hands and praying to God without
[1:02:55] wrath and without doubting trust in the
[1:02:58] word of God. 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse
[1:03:02] 16 he says this and without controversy
[1:03:05] great is the mystery of godliness.
[1:03:08] The new living translation says this is
[1:03:11] the great mystery of our faith.
[1:03:15] God was manifested back to the King
[1:03:17] James. God was manifested in the flesh,
[1:03:19] justified in the spirit, seen of angels,
[1:03:22] preached unto Gentiles, believed on in
[1:03:25] the world, and received up into glory.
[1:03:29] That's it. That's that's it. It doesn't
[1:03:33] put you in front of the line. It puts
[1:03:36] you It puts you with other believers.
[1:03:40] 1 Timothy chapter 4 verse one Paul again
[1:03:45] he's continuing on in this letter
[1:03:47] instructing this young minister in the
[1:03:49] Lord he says now the spirit speaks
[1:03:52] expressly
[1:03:54] NIV says the spirit clearly says
[1:03:59] that in the letter in the latter day
[1:04:01] latter times some shall depart from the
[1:04:04] faith giving heed to seducing spirits
[1:04:07] and doctrines of devils.
[1:04:12] He's friends, listen, he's not talking,
[1:04:15] this is a key to the book of first and
[1:04:17] second Timothy. He's not talking about
[1:04:18] the world. He's talking about the
[1:04:21] church.
[1:04:22] He's not, this isn't some weird French
[1:04:26] thing. He's talking about the believers.
[1:04:30] He's talking about the Christians
[1:04:33] speaking lies
[1:04:35] and hypocrisy, having their conscience
[1:04:38] seared with a hot iron. How do you have
[1:04:40] your conscience seared with with a hot
[1:04:42] iron?
[1:04:43] It's because they see that the word
[1:04:45] teaches something different. But because
[1:04:48] they have departed from the faith of
[1:04:50] Christ
[1:04:52] to something else, they get excited
[1:04:53] about the other stuff that's outside of
[1:04:55] Jesus. And then it just gets easier. You
[1:04:57] know how sometimes when you sin or you
[1:04:59] do something wrong, it's really hard
[1:05:00] when you first do it
[1:05:03] and then you do it again. It's a little
[1:05:05] easier and then a little easier and then
[1:05:08] a little easier. It's searing that
[1:05:10] conscious conscience.
[1:05:14] He says, "Forbidding to marry
[1:05:16] and com commanding to abstain from meats
[1:05:18] which God hath created to be received
[1:05:21] with thanksgiving of which
[1:05:24] of them which believe and know the
[1:05:27] truth." How easy it is. We think, well,
[1:05:30] what is what is this? How easy it is to
[1:05:32] depart from the faith. The biggest
[1:05:36] church in the world, the biggest
[1:05:38] denomination in the world
[1:05:41] forbids priests to marry.
[1:05:48] And then they say that their first pope
[1:05:51] was Peter
[1:05:52] and Peter had a mother-in-law.
[1:05:55] Therefore, Peter was married.
[1:05:59] It's not that hard to figure out. One
[1:06:00] plus one equals two on this. Peter was
[1:06:03] married and yet they say that that the
[1:06:06] the ministry of the priest that they
[1:06:08] can't marry.
[1:06:10] I I I read a article. This is years ago,
[1:06:14] maybe maybe 20 20 years ago or so. It
[1:06:16] was a long time ago. I read this article
[1:06:18] about the Catholic Church and they said
[1:06:19] that that a third
[1:06:23] of all
[1:06:25] priests that had that had been ordained
[1:06:29] that year and I don't remember when it
[1:06:31] was a long time ago were homosexual
[1:06:35] one-third.
[1:06:37] And you you think about that, it's like,
[1:06:41] well, why
[1:06:44] to me it gives me some respect for some
[1:06:47] of these these men because they see a
[1:06:50] weakness maybe in their lives. They see
[1:06:53] that they have a weakness towards
[1:06:56] homosexuality.
[1:06:57] They want to live right. They want to
[1:07:00] live like a Christian. So they say,
[1:07:01] "Well, I know I can just go in the
[1:07:03] priesthood and that'll prevent me from
[1:07:06] from having all of these bad feelings
[1:07:08] that'll prevent me from sinning. It'll
[1:07:09] prevent me from doing it. I'll just go
[1:07:11] into the priesthood and it'll be easier
[1:07:13] for me to live a a celibate life." You
[1:07:16] you look at and and it's an admirable
[1:07:19] thing for many of them.
[1:07:22] But the church in itself, it opens the
[1:07:25] door for sin and inviting more that
[1:07:29] might have that weakness. And that's why
[1:07:31] that we see so many problems with the
[1:07:33] Catholic Church with the priesthood and
[1:07:35] the with the molestation of kids and and
[1:07:38] the homosexuality is because they forbid
[1:07:40] to marry which is not scriptural. But do
[1:07:43] you see how easy it is to just get
[1:07:44] outside of what the what the word
[1:07:46] teaches and that's the biggest church in
[1:07:48] the world. We need to be careful in
[1:07:52] everything that we do and even
[1:07:54] abstaining from meats. That's talking
[1:07:56] about it's probably talking about mainly
[1:07:58] the kosher way that the Jews were. But
[1:08:00] you look at the Catholic Church and they
[1:08:02] do the same thing.
[1:08:04] It's like don't eat meat on Friday. You
[1:08:06] give this up for Lent or you do that.
[1:08:08] That's right here. It says
[1:08:12] don't teach that.
[1:08:14] But it's so easy to stray from the
[1:08:16] truth.
[1:08:18] Verse number four, for every creature of
[1:08:20] God is good and nothing to be refused if
[1:08:23] it be received with thanksgiving. talk
[1:08:24] about eating certain types of food.
[1:08:27] For it is sanctified by the word of God
[1:08:30] in prayer.
[1:08:32] If thou put on if thou put the brethren
[1:08:36] in remembrance of these things, thou
[1:08:38] shalt be a good minister of Jesus
[1:08:40] Christ, nourished up in the words of
[1:08:42] faith and of good doctrine, where until
[1:08:45] thou where unto thou hast attained. But
[1:08:48] refuse profane and old wives fables, and
[1:08:51] exercise thyself rather to godliness.
[1:08:54] For bodily exercise profitth little,
[1:08:58] but godliness is profitable unto all
[1:09:00] things, having promised, having promise
[1:09:04] of the life that is that now is, and of
[1:09:07] that which is to come. This is a
[1:09:10] faithful saying, and worthy of all
[1:09:12] exception. Now listen to this. For
[1:09:15] therefore we both labor and suffer
[1:09:17] reproach because we trust in the living
[1:09:19] God who is the savior of all men,
[1:09:22] especially of those that believe. These
[1:09:24] things commanded teach. Teach these
[1:09:26] things. Don't teach something else.
[1:09:29] Don't teach things that just cause
[1:09:31] problems and just cause fight. Just
[1:09:34] teach the word of God. Just teach the
[1:09:36] Bible. Don't worry about all of your
[1:09:38] strange
[1:09:40] doctrines and interpretations. Verse
[1:09:42] number 16. Take heed unto thyself and
[1:09:46] unto the doctrine.
[1:09:48] Continue in them. For in doing so, thou
[1:09:51] shalt save both thyself and them that
[1:09:55] hear thee.
[1:09:57] That's how important it is that we speak
[1:10:00] the right things in the word. The
[1:10:03] amplified
[1:10:04] version says, "Practice and work hard on
[1:10:07] these things and be absorbed in them."
[1:10:11] Absorb yourself in the scriptures. Get
[1:10:14] into the scriptures. Stay in them all
[1:10:16] the time. Let them David said, "Write
[1:10:18] them upon the bed post.
[1:10:22] Word. Just be with be with the
[1:10:24] scriptures all the time." Then he closes
[1:10:26] his letter in 1 Timothy the first the
[1:10:29] first letter. He closes his letter in
[1:10:32] chapter 6 verse 20. He says, "Oh
[1:10:34] Timothy, keep that which is committed to
[1:10:36] thy trust. Avoid profane and vain
[1:10:39] babblings
[1:10:40] and oppositions of science false falsely
[1:10:44] so-called which some professing have
[1:10:47] aired concerning the faith. Grace be
[1:10:49] with thee. Amen. He's saying Timothy
[1:10:53] stay with this guard that which is
[1:10:55] entrusted to you and avoid this
[1:10:58] irreverent babble and and contradictions
[1:11:02] of what is falsely called knowledge.
[1:11:05] King James says science. Modern word for
[1:11:08] that is knowledge.
[1:11:11] Then in second Timothy
[1:11:13] verse 15 he says study to show thyself
[1:11:16] approved unto God a workman
[1:11:18] that needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[1:11:21] dividing the word of truth. What word is
[1:11:23] he talking about? He's talking about the
[1:11:25] scriptures. He's talking about the
[1:11:27] Bible. He's not talking about anything
[1:11:28] else but shun and prof shun profane and
[1:11:31] vain babblings. Again he's saying the
[1:11:33] same thing. for they will increase unto
[1:11:35] more ungodliness.
[1:11:37] Again, he's talking about strange
[1:11:39] doctrines that rise up and they're so
[1:11:42] easy. They're they just they go
[1:11:43] everywhere
[1:11:46] and their word will eat as doth a canker
[1:11:49] of whom Himus
[1:11:52] and and Phileitus who concerning the
[1:11:55] truth have aired. Listen to this. So
[1:11:58] there's these two brothers
[1:12:00] and they're preaching to the churches.
[1:12:03] They're Christians, all right? And
[1:12:06] they're preaching in the churches. And
[1:12:10] he says that they're saying that the
[1:12:12] resurrection is passed already and it
[1:12:15] overthrows the faith of some
[1:12:18] bringing in these doctrines. Then you
[1:12:20] can go into the Bible and pull this
[1:12:21] scripture over here and pull this
[1:12:22] scripture over here and then line it up
[1:12:24] and then all of a sudden,
[1:12:27] oh, the Lord's come, you're lost
[1:12:31] now, these things are over. How would it
[1:12:34] feel
[1:12:36] if you were told
[1:12:39] that Christ had already come and you're
[1:12:40] lost to the tribulation?
[1:12:43] Would that encourage you? Of course not.
[1:12:47] And he's saying that these brothers are
[1:12:48] preaching that and it's discouraging to
[1:12:51] other people. It's hurting them. It's
[1:12:53] hurting their walk with the Lord.
[1:12:56] How would you like it if if your pastor
[1:13:00] or or whatever church that you you go
[1:13:02] to, how would you like it if the pastor
[1:13:04] says, "Here is what this scripture
[1:13:06] means." And you're reading that
[1:13:08] scripture and you're studying and it's
[1:13:09] like, "No, I don't think that scripture
[1:13:11] means this. I think it means something
[1:13:13] else." and you go to the pastor and you
[1:13:15] say, "Pastor, I don't believe that
[1:13:16] you're right in what you're saying. I
[1:13:18] believe here's what it here's what it
[1:13:20] means." And your pastor says, "No,
[1:13:22] you're an apostate. No, get out of here.
[1:13:25] You have no revelation. You're
[1:13:26] deceived." How would that make you feel
[1:13:28] if it was something very very important
[1:13:30] to you, it would be discouraging.
[1:13:32] And that's how these brothers here, they
[1:13:34] were teaching these doctrines that just
[1:13:36] hurt the people and they discouraged
[1:13:39] them and they caused them to leave the
[1:13:41] faith. Nevertheless, the foundation of
[1:13:43] God stand assure, having this seal, the
[1:13:46] Lord knoweth them that are his,
[1:13:50] and let everyone that nameth the name of
[1:13:52] Christ depart from iniquity.
[1:13:57] Verse number 23,
[1:13:59] but foolish and unlearned questions
[1:14:02] avoid, knowing that they do gender
[1:14:05] stripes.
[1:14:07] And the servant of the Lord must not
[1:14:09] strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt
[1:14:12] to teach, patient in meekness,
[1:14:14] instructing those that oppose
[1:14:16] themselves, if God, per adventure,
[1:14:19] will give them repentance to the
[1:14:21] acknowledging of the truth, and that
[1:14:24] they may recover themselves out of the
[1:14:26] snares of the devil, who are taken
[1:14:28] captive by him at his will. Now listen
[1:14:31] to this. Now remember when we read our
[1:14:34] our Bible
[1:14:36] the letters were written they didn't
[1:14:37] have chapters in there and references
[1:14:39] the letters were written just one long
[1:14:41] scroll. So the very next word listen to
[1:14:45] this this know also that in the last
[1:14:49] days perilous times will come.
[1:14:53] In the last days perilous times NIV says
[1:14:56] but mark this. There will be terrible
[1:14:59] times in the last days. Stop right
[1:15:01] there. What do you think these terrible
[1:15:03] times are going to be?
[1:15:06] Think they're not they're not going to
[1:15:07] be able to that we're not going to be
[1:15:08] able to go to church, maybe? Oh, that
[1:15:11] the government's going to come in and
[1:15:12] won't let us come together. Well, that
[1:15:14] happened in co.
[1:15:16] Most Christians don't even go to church.
[1:15:19] Oh, well, you know, you know, they're
[1:15:21] they're going to let they're not going
[1:15:22] to let us go to church. Well, do you do
[1:15:24] you appreciate going to church?
[1:15:26] Do you do you appreciate the fact that
[1:15:28] you have the right to go? Do you
[1:15:30] appreciate the fact that you can go?
[1:15:32] There's many people in the world that
[1:15:33] are not allowed to go to church. Oh,
[1:15:36] maybe the government's going to come in
[1:15:37] and take that away from us. That would
[1:15:39] be a horrible time, right? Or do you
[1:15:42] think it's going to be a famine that
[1:15:44] comes in and and kills a bunch of people
[1:15:46] and causes a bunch of suffering? That
[1:15:48] would be a terrible thing.
[1:15:51] Maybe a holocaust. Maybe torturing and
[1:15:54] dying. Maybe Russia or China is going to
[1:15:56] drop a nuclear bomb on the United
[1:15:58] States.
[1:15:59] and have all this suffering. Those are
[1:16:02] going to be horrible times. And Paul
[1:16:03] says here, he says, "In the last day,
[1:16:05] horrible times are going to come." What
[1:16:08] are those horrible times? What is the
[1:16:09] worst that you can think of?
[1:16:12] Now, listen to what he says. For men
[1:16:15] should be lovers of their own selves.
[1:16:20] It's going to be horrible times, but men
[1:16:22] are going to be lovers of their own
[1:16:24] selves. That's what's so horrible.
[1:16:27] covetous,
[1:16:29] boasters,
[1:16:30] proud, blasphemers,
[1:16:33] disobedient, disobedient to parents,
[1:16:35] unthankful, unholy. This is the worst is
[1:16:38] what Paul's saying.
[1:16:40] This is beyond famine. This is beyond
[1:16:42] the worst of the worst. People will love
[1:16:45] themselves.
[1:16:47] They'll boast and they'll be proud and
[1:16:48] they'll put other people down and
[1:16:50] they'll destroy other people's
[1:16:52] reputations. Wow, that sounds really
[1:16:55] bad, doesn't it?
[1:16:59] They set up they'll set up shrines to
[1:17:01] themselves
[1:17:04] and they'll call it their profile.
[1:17:07] You know, they'll spend all their time
[1:17:09] editing their pictures and putting
[1:17:11] filters on them so they can look as good
[1:17:13] as they can. They should be lovers of
[1:17:15] their own selves. Like, well, brother,
[1:17:16] we all do that.
[1:17:19] Paul said,
[1:17:21] "Horrible times will come for people
[1:17:23] will love theirelves
[1:17:26] oppose in different ways." You know,
[1:17:29] they'll post videos of how happy they
[1:17:31] are and how great they are. They'll post
[1:17:33] their opinions and they'll promote
[1:17:34] themselves and they'll put other people
[1:17:35] down.
[1:17:38] He's like, Timothy, this is going to be
[1:17:40] really bad.
[1:17:42] Really, really bad. And I think that we
[1:17:44] have arrived.
[1:17:47] We are living in this time that Paul
[1:17:49] said in the end, in the last days,
[1:17:52] horrible times are going to come. We're
[1:17:54] here.
[1:17:55] Look around. We are here.
[1:17:57] We're here now. But it's just normal to
[1:18:00] us. Oh, well, everybody does that.
[1:18:03] Don't try to make But we can't try to
[1:18:04] make the word say something that it
[1:18:07] doesn't mean.
[1:18:09] Remember, as I said from the beginning,
[1:18:10] it doesn't mean what it doesn't. It's
[1:18:12] not right to say this is what it means
[1:18:15] to me. This is what it means. It's
[1:18:18] pretty plain.
[1:18:20] They will be lovers of their own selves.
[1:18:25] Tell my wife about this. The other night
[1:18:28] we're walking and and Stephanie says,
[1:18:30] "Dan, it's Proverbs." She says, "I read
[1:18:32] a proverb the other day. I'll read it to
[1:18:34] you." Says this, Proverbs 27:2. It says,
[1:18:38] "Let someone else praise you, not your
[1:18:41] own mouth.
[1:18:43] Let a stranger and not your own lips.
[1:18:48] And friends, I'm not talking about the
[1:18:50] world. Paul's not talking about the
[1:18:52] world. He's talking about the church.
[1:18:56] Without natural affection, truce
[1:18:57] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[1:18:59] fierce, despisers of those that are
[1:19:01] good. NIV says without love,
[1:19:04] unforgiving and slanderous, without sea
[1:19:06] self-control,
[1:19:09] and they will be cruel and they'll hate
[1:19:12] what is good.
[1:19:15] Message to the Leo Leodyian church in
[1:19:17] Revelation 3 says that they won't know
[1:19:21] that they are like this.
[1:19:26] They know not
[1:19:28] that they're miserable, naked, and
[1:19:30] blind. They don't know it. And it's the
[1:19:33] church.
[1:19:36] Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of
[1:19:37] pleasure more than lovers of God, having
[1:19:39] a form of godliness, but denying the
[1:19:40] power thereof. From such, turn away.
[1:19:45] Having the appearance of godliness, but
[1:19:47] denying its power. It says another um
[1:19:49] the English Standard Version says,
[1:19:50] "Avoid these people."
[1:19:53] He's warning the church how the people
[1:19:55] are going to act in the last day. And
[1:19:57] it's going to be horrible.
[1:19:59] For this is the sort
[1:20:02] are they which creep into houses and
[1:20:04] lead captive silly women laden with
[1:20:05] sins, led away with divers lust, ever
[1:20:08] learning. Listen to this. Ever learning
[1:20:11] and never able to come to the knowledge
[1:20:14] of the truth. Why?
[1:20:17] It's because when they read the Bible or
[1:20:20] they listen to a sermon, they are
[1:20:23] looking for the things that match their
[1:20:24] doctrine
[1:20:28] rather
[1:20:30] than looking for the truth. They are
[1:20:32] looking for something that justifies the
[1:20:36] way that they are living their life or
[1:20:38] the way that they are acting rather than
[1:20:40] really seeking God. Ever learning. It's
[1:20:44] because they have a focus on what they
[1:20:47] want and never able to come to the
[1:20:49] knowledge of the truth. I'm short on
[1:20:52] time. So, let's skip to second Timothy
[1:20:57] chapter 4.
[1:21:01] We'll close with this. Now, this is the
[1:21:04] end. So, Paul writes two letters to
[1:21:07] Timothy. Timothy is this young man and
[1:21:10] he's instructing Timothy. He's like,
[1:21:12] "You got to live your life this way. You
[1:21:13] got to teach this way and be careful.
[1:21:15] Watch watch all the fighting and watch
[1:21:17] all the strange doctrines that are come.
[1:21:19] All of this coming and in the end the
[1:21:21] people are going to love themselves and
[1:21:24] they're going to be promoting themselves
[1:21:25] and all of this horrible stuff is going
[1:21:27] to happen. Timothy, watch this. And this
[1:21:30] second letter to Timothy is the last
[1:21:32] thing Paul ever wrote. He was in prison
[1:21:37] and he says, "I'm ready to be offered
[1:21:40] now." He was probably about to walk out
[1:21:43] the door and lay his head down and have
[1:21:45] the axe come down and his head cut off.
[1:21:47] That's how he died.
[1:21:49] This is these are the very last words of
[1:21:52] one of the greatest men that has ever
[1:21:53] lived. And he warns us of the things
[1:21:56] that are coming. And he says this, I
[1:21:58] charge thee
[1:22:01] therefore before God
[1:22:03] and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[1:22:06] judge the quick and the dead at his
[1:22:08] appearing in his kingdom. Preach the
[1:22:10] word. 2 Timothy 4:2. Preach the word. Be
[1:22:15] instant in season and out of season.
[1:22:16] Reprove, rebuke, exhort with all
[1:22:19] longsuffering and doctrine. He's telling
[1:22:21] Timothy to be prepared. Be instant. Be
[1:22:23] ready. Be knowledgeable about the
[1:22:25] scriptures. And Paul said that in the
[1:22:28] end times, the church is going to be
[1:22:30] lovers of their own selves. Right? He
[1:22:31] just said it. They're going to have the
[1:22:34] appearance of godliness. They're going
[1:22:36] to have the appearance
[1:22:38] of godliness,
[1:22:40] but they're really not going to believe.
[1:22:44] They won't have true love. They won't be
[1:22:46] forgiving. They'll lose their temper. He
[1:22:49] says, "Watch these things, Timothy.
[1:22:52] Study your Bible." He says all
[1:22:54] scriptures in inspired and you can
[1:22:56] preach about all of it. Correct them
[1:22:58] when they are in error. Stay with the
[1:23:01] scriptures for the time will come
[1:23:05] when they will not endure sound
[1:23:07] doctrine.
[1:23:08] But after their own lusts shall they
[1:23:11] heap to themselves teachers having
[1:23:12] itching ears. What does that mean? The
[1:23:15] time will come when they won't want
[1:23:17] Bible teaching.
[1:23:19] The time will come when they will want
[1:23:21] something beyond the Bible or beyond
[1:23:25] Jesus and the people will seek out
[1:23:27] preachers who give them what they want.
[1:23:33] New Living Translation said for a says
[1:23:36] for a time is coming when people will no
[1:23:38] longer listen to sound and wholesome
[1:23:40] teaching.
[1:23:42] They will follow their own desires and
[1:23:44] will look for teachers who will tell
[1:23:47] them whatever their itching ears want to
[1:23:50] hear.
[1:23:51] Wow.
[1:23:55] And they shall turn away their ears from
[1:23:57] the truth
[1:23:59] and they shall be turned to fables. This
[1:24:02] is the church he's talking about,
[1:24:03] friends. This is the Christian church
[1:24:07] and they're going to want something more
[1:24:09] than the Bible. These are going to be
[1:24:11] horrible times and people will turn from
[1:24:13] the truth to things outside. They're
[1:24:16] going to be turned to these fables. But
[1:24:18] watch thou in all things. Timothy,
[1:24:21] endure afflictions. Do the work of an
[1:24:24] evangelist. Make full proof of thy
[1:24:26] ministry. Now listen to this. He's about
[1:24:29] to walk out the door.
[1:24:32] For I am now ready to be offered.
[1:24:35] And the time of my departure is at hand.
[1:24:38] I have fought a good fight. I have
[1:24:41] finished my course. I have kept the
[1:24:43] faith. The closing
[1:24:46] the closing arguments, the closing words
[1:24:50] of the great apostle Paul who really
[1:24:53] formed
[1:24:54] the doctrine of Christianity.
[1:24:57] He was the foundational person
[1:25:00] in preaching the deity of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:04] And here is this man and he's closing
[1:25:06] this letters and he says, "Timothy,
[1:25:08] watch it.
[1:25:10] The time is coming when they won't
[1:25:12] endure endure sound doctrine, but they
[1:25:15] will heap for themselves teachers having
[1:25:18] it in itching ears. They're going to
[1:25:20] they're going to put the pressure. They
[1:25:22] want to have a certain doctrine. They
[1:25:24] want to have all these fables. They want
[1:25:26] to have all this arguing. They want to
[1:25:27] have all of this. and they will neglect
[1:25:30] the one that we all should be preaching
[1:25:33] about, which is Christ Jesus. You say,
[1:25:34] "Oh, well, brother Dan, that's you say
[1:25:36] that all the time.
[1:25:39] Find me
[1:25:41] a chapter in the New Testament that's
[1:25:44] not about Christ."
[1:25:48] And then you say, "Maybe I I talked too
[1:25:50] much about him."
[1:25:53] The apostles talked about him. We were
[1:25:54] talking about last night. We were
[1:25:56] talking about um for the next Bible
[1:25:58] study, we want to maybe talk about what
[1:25:59] is a disciple?
[1:26:02] What is a disciple?
[1:26:04] A disciple is someone that has accepted
[1:26:08] Jesus Christ, that is following Jesus
[1:26:10] Christ, and that is lifting up Jesus
[1:26:12] Christ. I am a disciple.
[1:26:14] Amen.
[1:26:14] And I want to make more disciples.
[1:26:18] I am ready now to be offered.
[1:26:21] And the time of my departure is at hand.
[1:26:22] I have fought a good fight. I have
[1:26:24] finished my course. have kept the faith.
[1:26:27] Now listen to this. Paul always ends
[1:26:29] good. He's hard.
[1:26:32] And now listen to this. Henceforth there
[1:26:36] is laid up for me a crown of
[1:26:37] righteousness,
[1:26:39] which the Lord, the righteous judge,
[1:26:41] shall shall give me at that day, and not
[1:26:44] to me only,
[1:26:46] but to the Tucson tabernacle,
[1:26:51] but unto all them that love his
[1:26:54] appearing.
[1:26:55] That's what we're to look for. That is
[1:26:58] good, sound doctrine. Brother Josiah and
[1:27:01] the worship team can can come to close.
[1:27:03] That is good sound doctrine. But
[1:27:06] friends, let me read. Let me go back
[1:27:07] when as the team's coming, let me go
[1:27:10] back and read again and let just the
[1:27:13] Lord interpret to you what this means.
[1:27:17] You with me?
[1:27:19] Second Timothy
[1:27:26] chapter 3.
[1:27:29] This know also that in the last days
[1:27:31] perilous time shall come.
[1:27:34] For men shall be lovers of their own
[1:27:36] selves,
[1:27:38] covetous,
[1:27:40] boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[1:27:43] disobedient, disobedient to parents,
[1:27:45] unthankful, unholy, without natural
[1:27:48] affection, truce breakers, false
[1:27:50] accusers, incontinent,
[1:27:54] fierce, despisers of those that are
[1:27:57] good, traitors, heavy high-minded,
[1:28:00] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:28:01] God, having a form of godliness but
[1:28:03] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:28:05] away.
[1:28:08] For of this sort are they which creep
[1:28:10] into houses and lead captive silly women
[1:28:12] laden with sins, ever learning
[1:28:15] and never able to come to the knowledge
[1:28:17] of the truth.
[1:28:19] Why again?
[1:28:21] Because they're reading and they're
[1:28:23] listening with their own thoughts in
[1:28:25] mind, with their own doctrines in mind.
[1:28:30] And then
[1:28:34] 2 Timothy chapter chapter 4.
[1:28:38] I charge thee therefore before God and
[1:28:41] the Lord Jesus Christ who shall shut who
[1:28:43] shall judge the quick and the dead
[1:28:46] at his appearing in and his kingdom.
[1:28:49] Preach the word. Be instant in season
[1:28:51] out of season. Reprove, rebuke, exhort
[1:28:53] with all longsuffering and doctrine. For
[1:28:55] the time will come.
[1:28:57] He just said, "Here's what it's going to
[1:28:59] look like at the end.
[1:29:02] People are going to love themselves.
[1:29:05] People are going to promote themselves.
[1:29:07] People are going to put down other
[1:29:08] people.
[1:29:10] We are there."
[1:29:13] But the time will come now what's going
[1:29:15] to happen when they will not endure
[1:29:17] sound doctrine.
[1:29:19] But after their own lusts, after their
[1:29:22] own desires,
[1:29:24] they shall heap for themselves teachers
[1:29:26] having itching ears.
[1:29:29] Again, for the time is coming when
[1:29:31] people will no longer listen to sound,
[1:29:33] wholesome teaching. They will follow
[1:29:35] their own desires and will look for
[1:29:37] teachers who will tell them whatever
[1:29:39] their itching ears want to hear.
[1:29:42] And they shall turn away their ears from
[1:29:44] the truth
[1:29:46] and shall be turned to favor fables.
[1:29:49] We are there brothers and sisters.
[1:29:53] That spirit is there. That spirit is
[1:29:56] working among
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:29:59] all the people
[1:30:01] and it's trying to get us to lose our
[1:30:04] focus to go into some strange this or
[1:30:07] some fantastic that. And it's pulling
[1:30:10] people away from their savior, Jesus
[1:30:14] Christ. They still mention Jesus. They
[1:30:16] still talk about Jesus all the time.
[1:30:18] They they they mention that that that
[1:30:21] Jesus is their savior, but then they put
[1:30:24] something else. They put something else
[1:30:26] before him.
[1:30:29] Watch thou in all things and endure
[1:30:31] affliction. Do the work of an
[1:30:32] evangelist. Make full proof of thy
[1:30:33] ministry. For I, Paul, am now ready to
[1:30:36] be offered, and the time of my departure
[1:30:38] is at hand. I have fought a good fight.
[1:30:41] I finished my course. I have kept the
[1:30:43] faith. Henceforth, there is laid up for
[1:30:46] me a crown of righteousness, which the
[1:30:48] Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me
[1:30:50] at that day, and not o not to me only,
[1:30:54] but unto all them also that love his
[1:30:57] appearing. Friends,
[1:31:00] do you want to see the second coming of
[1:31:04] Jesus Christ?
[1:31:05] Do you just long to see that?
[1:31:09] The Bible ends within the spirit and the
[1:31:11] bride are calling out for the Lord to
[1:31:14] come. Do you want that? Do you want to
[1:31:18] see it?
[1:31:19] That is our greatest desire. And this is
[1:31:23] what Paul teached and that's what I'm
[1:31:25] trying to get across. That is the most
[1:31:28] important thing. And to all them, as
[1:31:31] Paul said, that love is appearing. There
[1:31:33] is laid up a crown of righteousness.
[1:31:37] We're going to go to heaven. We're going
[1:31:38] to be with God. We're going to be with
[1:31:40] our savior, Jesus Christ. We're going to
[1:31:42] be with each other.
[1:31:45] And that is the greatest desire.
[1:31:48] But we should heed, friends, to the
[1:31:52] warnings that are written in the Bible.
[1:31:56] Let me tell you, Satan is a master
[1:31:58] deceiver. He is very, very good at what
[1:32:01] he does.
[1:32:03] But if we would just follow the word,
[1:32:07] follow the teachings of the Bible, I
[1:32:10] believe God will honor our sincerity,
[1:32:13] and he will correct us where we need
[1:32:16] correction. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:18] Brother Josiah,
[1:32:23] would you all stand with us?
[1:32:25] [Applause]
[1:32:32] [Music]
[1:32:34] I pledge
[1:32:37] alance
[1:32:39] to
[1:32:41] the lamb.
[1:32:44] With all my strength,
[1:32:48] with all I am, I will seek
[1:32:55] to honor
[1:32:58] his
[1:32:59] command.
[1:33:02] I pledge
[1:33:04] alence
[1:33:07] to
[1:33:11] the lamb again.
[1:33:14] Yes. I pledge
[1:33:17] alance
[1:33:20] to
[1:33:22] the Lord.
[1:33:24] With all my strength,
[1:33:28] with all I am, I will seek
[1:33:35] to honor
[1:33:37] his
[1:33:39] coming.
[1:33:41] I pledge
[1:33:43] alce
[1:33:46] to
[1:33:50] the lamb. Verse one.
[1:33:53] We have heard
[1:33:56] how Christians
[1:33:59] long
[1:34:00] ago
[1:34:03] were brought before.
[1:34:07] A ty
[1:34:09] throne. They were told
[1:34:13] that he would spare
[1:34:17] their lives.
[1:34:20] If they would renounce
[1:34:24] the name
[1:34:26] of Christ.
[1:34:28] So one by one
[1:34:32] they chose to die.
[1:34:37] The son of God
[1:34:40] they would not deny.
[1:34:45] Like a great
[1:34:47] angelic
[1:34:49] choir
[1:34:51] sings.
[1:34:53] I can almost hear
[1:34:58] their voicees.
[1:35:01] I pray
[1:35:05] [Applause]
[1:35:06] to
[1:35:08] the Lord.
[1:35:10] With all my strength,
[1:35:14] with all I am, I will seek
[1:35:20] to honor
[1:35:23] his command.
[1:35:27] I pledge
[1:35:29] alce
[1:35:31] to
[1:35:35] the lamb. Verse two.
[1:35:39] Now the years have come
[1:35:43] and the years have gone,
[1:35:47] but the cause of Jesus
[1:35:52] still goes on.
[1:35:55] Now our time has come
[1:35:59] to count the cost
[1:36:03] to check this world
[1:36:08] and face the cross.
[1:36:12] So one by one,
[1:36:15] let us live our lives
[1:36:19] for the one who died
[1:36:23] to give us life.
[1:36:27] Till the trumpet
[1:36:29] sounds on that final day.
[1:36:35] as proud
[1:36:39] and holy
[1:36:41] say I
[1:36:44] [Applause]
[1:36:48] to the land.
[1:36:52] All my strength
[1:36:55] with all I am I will seek
[1:37:01] to honor
[1:37:05] him.
[1:37:07] I pledge
[1:37:09] aliance
[1:37:11] to
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:15] the lamb.
[1:37:18] To the lamb of God
[1:37:23] who bore my pain,
[1:37:26] who took my place,
[1:37:30] who wore my shame.
[1:37:34] I will seek
[1:37:36] to honor
[1:37:39] his
[1:37:40] command.
[1:37:42] I pledge
[1:37:45] alce
[1:37:47] to
[1:37:51] the lamb.
[1:37:55] Do you pledge allegiance to the lamb?
[1:37:57] Yes.
[1:37:57] Your allegiance is your life that you
[1:38:01] pledge to him.
[1:38:03] I'm talking about social media today and
[1:38:06] our our profiles and that friends. I'm
[1:38:08] not saying that you have to give up your
[1:38:10] social media, but don't make it about
[1:38:12] yourself.
[1:38:13] I know that's that's the way it was
[1:38:15] created, but you can use it to make it
[1:38:18] about Jesus.
[1:38:19] Amen.
[1:38:20] You can use it to do to serve him. And
[1:38:23] that's what I encourage you to do. If if
[1:38:25] you're if you have a social media, I
[1:38:27] don't have it. I don't I don't know how
[1:38:29] it's worked. I I never had it.
[1:38:32] But use it.
[1:38:34] If you want to use it, use it for Christ
[1:38:38] and not to be a lover of your own self.
[1:38:42] You with me? And friends, when you start
[1:38:44] hearing these strange doctrines,
[1:38:47] when you start hearing these things that
[1:38:49] do nothing but but divide and and do
[1:38:52] nothing but but really confuse, when you
[1:38:55] start hearing those things, let me tell
[1:38:57] you, run away as fast as you can. Get
[1:39:03] away from it.
[1:39:04] If it's lifting up ourselves and vanity,
[1:39:09] get away from it because it's going to
[1:39:11] do nothing but hurt you. It's going to
[1:39:14] do nothing but deceive you. Those things
[1:39:17] do nothing but build strife. So stay
[1:39:20] away from those. God bless you, brothers
[1:39:22] and sisters. The plan tonight, we're
[1:39:24] very short staffed, so we're we're not
[1:39:26] going to have service tonight. We're
[1:39:28] canceling service. And please, I ask the
[1:39:30] church to pray for me. I'm going to
[1:39:33] Canada this next week and I'll be
[1:39:36] ministering um at a couple different
[1:39:39] churches and I'll be be uh ministering
[1:39:42] quite a few services
[1:39:46] and I'm going there.
[1:39:48] This is the first time I've done this.
[1:39:50] I'm going there to represent
[1:39:53] the Tucson Tabernacle. I'm going there
[1:39:56] to represent you all because there are
[1:39:58] people that have expressed
[1:40:01] that
[1:40:03] they just want to hear that there's
[1:40:05] other people there's other people out
[1:40:08] there that really truly love the Lord.
[1:40:10] There's other people out there that are
[1:40:11] like them. And it's I just feel like the
[1:40:14] Apostle Paul and and
[1:40:17] Silas and Timothy. I feel like him them
[1:40:21] going out and just encouraging the
[1:40:25] believers and that's why I'm going. So
[1:40:28] please, I'm representing you all,
[1:40:29] everyone here, and I'm going to greet
[1:40:32] them on your behalf and I ask that
[1:40:34] please let your prayers be with me.
[1:40:37] I leave on Wednesday and I'll be gone uh
[1:40:41] for about eight days. Brother Ryan will
[1:40:43] minister
[1:40:45] next weekend and uh I'm not sure uh
[1:40:49] Wednesday night what we're going to do
[1:40:51] yet, but Aaron's still under the
[1:40:52] weather. So, we'll we'll see how he's
[1:40:54] doing. And um friends,
[1:41:00] don't make this life about you.
[1:41:03] If I could give you any advice,
[1:41:07] it's don't live your life for yourself.
[1:41:10] live your life for someone else. And
[1:41:13] then when you get to the end of the road
[1:41:16] and you come before the Lord,
[1:41:20] don't let it be said that this man or
[1:41:23] this woman served themselves
[1:41:27] when those witnesses
[1:41:30] are brought. And there might be
[1:41:31] witnesses. I I don't know how it's going
[1:41:32] to be,
[1:41:34] but just make sure you lift up Jesus
[1:41:37] Christ and make sure that you are
[1:41:39] serving others because that's what he
[1:41:40] taught. Live your life for others,
[1:41:43] friends. That's what Paul was telling
[1:41:45] Timothy. That's what it's all through
[1:41:48] the Bible. Be strong. God bless you
[1:41:50] again. No service tonight. Let's bow our
[1:41:53] heads.
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:58] Lord God,
[1:42:01] Lord, sometimes
[1:42:04] these
[1:42:06] letters, these epistles are are hard to
[1:42:09] take because we see that that Lord,
[1:42:12] we're guilty and we see that we live in
[1:42:14] these days now. They're not just written
[1:42:16] for 2,000 years ago, but they are here.
[1:42:20] And father, I believe that we are in
[1:42:22] this day that Paul said
[1:42:25] when he said the time will come when
[1:42:27] they will not endure sound doctrine.
[1:42:30] Lord, help us to be not
[1:42:34] one that that wouldn't be able to accept
[1:42:36] sound doctrine. But Lord, let us be able
[1:42:38] to accept your word, your Bible,
[1:42:42] and take it into our hearts, Father, and
[1:42:44] not just listen to it, not just read it,
[1:42:46] not just believe it, but live it,
[1:42:48] Father.
[1:42:50] Let that be in our lives. We pray. Lord,
[1:42:53] we love you with all of our hearts. We
[1:42:56] thank you that you preserve these
[1:42:58] letters that we could read them. Thank
[1:43:00] you for service this morning. Father, we
[1:43:03] pray that as we leave that you would go
[1:43:05] with us, that you'd have your hand upon
[1:43:08] us and that your blessings would rest
[1:43:10] upon us, Father, in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:43:14] [Music]

[1:43:18] the glory
[1:43:21] to Jesus

[1:43:31] is wonderful.
[1:43:36] will give

[1:44:09] And tell
[1:44:11] of his love.

[1:45:07] God bless you, brothers and sisters.
[1:45:09] Have a good Sunday afternoon. Juan, back
[1:45:12] there, I didn't greet you, young man.
[1:45:14] God bless you. It's good to have you in
[1:45:16] service. If I missed any other visitors,
[1:45:20] God bless you all. I
[1:45:23] appreciate brother Juan making a stand.
[1:45:26] Young man, loves the Lord, just lives in
[1:45:29] the neighborhood here and really is
[1:45:33] seeking the truth and wants to live a
[1:45:36] life that's worthy of this gospel. God
[1:45:38] bless you, brothers and sisters. You're
[1:45:39] dismissed.
[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:44] Do you all appreciate Brother Daniel?

[1:45:46] [Applause]
[1:45:49] [Music]

[1:46:23] You know, I think I can speak for all of
[1:46:26] us. Doesn't it feel good to be loved?
[1:46:29] I want I want everybody to come into
[1:46:31] this church and say, "You know what?
[1:46:34] When I come in, those people love me."
[1:46:37] That's the That's the spirit that should
[1:46:39] be in this Tucson tabernacle because
[1:46:41] love can hide a multitude of multitude
[1:46:45] of sins. God bless you, brothers and
[1:46:46] sisters.
[1:46:47] Let's go back to give the glory to
[1:46:48] Jesus.
