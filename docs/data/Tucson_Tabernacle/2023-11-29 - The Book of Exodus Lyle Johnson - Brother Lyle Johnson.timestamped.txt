[39:05] of Galilee where Jesus is concluding The
[39:08] Sermon on the Mount chap Matthew 7 he
[39:11] says therefore whosoever heareth these
[39:15] sayings of mine and doeth them I will
[39:18] liken him unto a a wise man who who
[39:21] built his house upon a rock the rain
[39:23] descended the floods came the winds blew
[39:27] it beat upon that house it fell not for
[39:31] it was found on a
[39:34] rock everyone that heareth these sayings
[39:36] of mine and doeth them not shall be
[39:39] likened unto a foolish man which built
[39:42] his his house upon the sand the rain
[39:46] descended the floods came the winds blew
[39:48] beat upon that house and it fell great
[39:53] was the fall of
[39:55] it here here Jesus is talking about
[39:58] foundations both houses were probably
[40:01] well constructed one had a
[40:03] foundation anchored to the Rock the
[40:07] other forgot the
[40:10] foundation Exodus is a part of the
[40:13] foundation of the entire
[40:16] Bible as a result it's controversial and
[40:19] always under attack but it's anchored to
[40:22] The Rock in fact it's part of that rock
[40:25] one of the cornerstones
[40:27] as a result it will withstand those
[40:30] storms of controversy and
[40:33] rejection like these two men building a
[40:36] house our faith must have a solid
[40:40] foundation it must be built on
[40:43] Rock are are these stories in the
[40:46] opening books of the Bible are they
[40:50] truth are they rock or are they myths
[40:53] are they false are they sand as is
[40:56] Exodus
[40:57] history or is it
[41:00] myth please be
[41:03] seated I'm sure most of you are aware
[41:05] that Exodus tells the story of the
[41:07] oppression of Israel in Egypt the
[41:11] arrival of a deliverer a miraculous
[41:15] escape from bondage judgment on Egypt
[41:19] and the receiving of the
[41:21] law there are of course many other
[41:24] things that happen in this amazing book
[41:26] but
[41:27] before Israel can leave Egyptian bondage
[41:31] they have to get there and be enslaved
[41:34] so let's quickly review from Genesis
[41:36] telling how they got to Egypt in the
[41:37] first place and at least part of the
[41:40] reason why God sent them
[41:43] there around 291
[41:46] BC Abram leaves haran and comes to sheim
[41:52] the Lord appears to
[41:53] Abram and the Lord said to AB AB know of
[41:57] assurity that thy seed thy descendants
[42:00] shall be a stranger in a land that is
[42:03] not theirs and Shall Serve them and they
[42:06] shall afflict them 400 years and also
[42:11] that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I
[42:14] judge and afterward shall they come out
[42:18] with great
[42:20] substance so Abram's descendants will be
[42:23] oppressed four centuries how long were
[42:27] they to be
[42:28] oppressed 400 years the nation that
[42:32] oppresses them will be judged after that
[42:36] judgment The Descendants will leave with
[42:38] significant wealth this is a prophecy
[42:42] the word of the Lord directly to Abram
[42:44] an order or sequence of
[42:46] events over a definite specified time
[42:50] frame
[42:51] 400
[42:53] years well let's fast forward 215 years
[42:57] to 1876
[43:00] BC Joseph is sent for his father's Clan
[43:03] to come to Egypt due to a Great Famine
[43:05] Genesis 46 and Israel also called Jacob
[43:09] took his journey with all that he had
[43:11] not just his stuff but his children
[43:13] their spouses his grandchildren all
[43:15] their descendants and came to berseba
[43:19] and offered sacrifices unto the god of
[43:21] his father
[43:22] Isaac and God spake unto Israel in the
[43:26] visions of the night and said Jacob
[43:29] Jacob and he said here am I and he
[43:34] said I am God L the god Elohim of thy
[43:41] father fear not to go down to Egypt it's
[43:45] okay to leave this land that I promis
[43:47] would be your inheritance here's why you
[43:49] should go for I will there in Egypt not
[43:53] in Canaan make of thee a a great
[43:57] nation in Egypt your descendants will be
[44:00] forged into a nation I will go down with
[44:04] thee into Egypt I will also surely bring
[44:08] thee up again and Joseph shall put his
[44:11] hand upon thine eyes that's a very
[44:15] personal promise that he's
[44:18] making stepping up to 1446 BC 430 years
[44:24] after Jacob arrived in Egypt read in
[44:27] Exodus
[44:28] 12:40 now the sojourning of the children
[44:31] the descendants of Israel who dwelt in
[44:34] Egypt was 430
[44:38] years wasn't it supposed to be
[44:42] 400
[44:44] oops and it came to pass at the end of
[44:47] 430 years it's emphasized even the
[44:51] self-same day it came to pass that all
[44:53] the hosts the people of the Lord went
[44:56] out from the land of
[44:58] Egypt when you read Exodus or perhaps
[45:01] you read it before you came to service
[45:03] these are not just descendants of Israel
[45:05] we're told a couple of verses early in
[45:07] verse 38 that a mixed
[45:09] multitude went out with
[45:11] them well let's address this 400 versus
[45:15] 430 years of apparent discrepancy I I
[45:19] drew a picture Heather says that she
[45:21] relates to pictures I tend to relate to
[45:23] words and Abstract weird weird kind of
[45:26] stuff I'm kind of weird but anyway in
[45:30] 1859 BC 17 years after he
[45:34] arrived Jacob dies Pharaoh you recall
[45:39] allows Joseph and the clan to bury Jacob
[45:41] in Canaan and and then return but 13
[45:45] years later about 1846 BC there's a
[45:49] change in the regime another Pharaoh
[45:51] arises the Israelites are no longer free
[45:54] to travel out of Egypt Egypt the
[45:57] beginning of the oppression this loss of
[46:00] Freedom so 430 total years in Egypt the
[46:04] first 30 under comparative freedom and
[46:06] prosperity under Joseph and then the
[46:09] oppression begins it could be that
[46:12] Joseph is replaced with an Egyptian
[46:13] visier rather than have a Hebrew
[46:16] wielding such power and influence
[46:18] remember when he revealed himself to his
[46:20] Brethren that even though he was the
[46:21] number two guy in Egypt the Egyptians
[46:23] wouldn't even eat with him said it's an
[46:26] mination to the Egyptians to even eat
[46:28] with a
[46:28] Hebrew about 1806 BC Joseph dies
[46:32] requests that his remains be transported
[46:34] back to Canaan when the descendants of
[46:36] Israel will leave some 360 years later
[46:40] the Hebrews are not free to bury him in
[46:42] Canaan as they were when Jacob died just
[46:44] 53 years earlier so during this period
[46:48] is when the oppression began so there is
[46:51] no contradiction they were oppressed for
[46:53] 400 years they were there for for 430
[46:57] Exodus opens towards the end of this 430
[47:00] so year
[47:03] sojourn well like our overview of
[47:06] Genesis this look into Exodus will be
[47:08] very abstract touching on
[47:10] major events or themes in the book but
[47:14] rather than a quick summary of each
[47:16] chapter there's 40 chapters let's look
[47:19] at Exodus in an even more General
[47:22] overview then zero went on some of the
[47:25] events and foundational scripture for
[47:27] Jewish faith and
[47:28] consequently our faith belief and
[47:31] Christianity so fasten your seat belts
[47:36] we're going to go a little quick
[47:38] here Exodus 1-4 tells of the buildup of
[47:42] Oppression the birth and miraculous
[47:44] preservation of Moses his fleeing for
[47:47] his life to Midian where he remains for
[47:50] 40 years God then attracts Moses by a
[47:52] burning bush and commissions him to
[47:54] deliver Israel from Egypt Moses returns
[47:58] to Egypt chapters 5-10 describe the
[48:02] signs he has given the contempt of
[48:04] pharaoh for Moses and the Hebrews and
[48:07] the contest between Moses and Pharaoh in
[48:10] the form of nine devastating plagues a
[48:14] genealogy of Moses is also presented
[48:17] chapters 11 through 13 tell of the 10th
[48:20] and final plague the death of the
[48:23] firstborn in Egypt God's protection via
[48:26] the Passover The Exodus with great
[48:30] wealth the institution of the Passover
[48:33] remembrance and God leading by a pillar
[48:36] of cloud and
[48:38] fire chapter 14 tells of the crossing of
[48:42] the Red Sea and the
[48:44] destruction of Pharaoh's Army that was
[48:46] pursuing them chapter 15 is a song of
[48:50] Moses of
[48:52] Celebration a test through bitter water
[48:55] follows that chapters 16- 18 tell of
[48:59] bread from Heaven called
[49:02] Mana Domino's wasn't the first to
[49:05] deliver food to your
[49:08] house they travel to a dry place and God
[49:11] provides water from a rock they are
[49:14] attacked by and they defeat the people
[49:16] of
[49:17] amalec Moses father-in-law tells him
[49:20] he's too busy with minutia and should
[49:22] assign trusted people to judge small
[49:23] matters and leave the big stuff to to
[49:25] Moses a bit like the deacons of Acts
[49:28] taking some of the load off of the
[49:31] Apostles chapters 19 through 31 include
[49:34] the arrival at Mount Si 45 to 60 days
[49:39] after setting out from Egypt the tablets
[49:41] of the Ten Commandments god- giving
[49:43] Moses a lot of detailed instructions
[49:46] about the Tabernacle and its Associated
[49:49] ritual items altars lamps the ark tables
[49:54] divisions of the space curtain and so
[49:56] forth details of the priest's garments
[49:59] consecration of the
[50:02] priests when he comes down from the
[50:04] mountain chapters 32 and 33 are the
[50:07] worship of the golden calf and the
[50:10] aftermath the command to leave SI the
[50:13] tent of meeting and Moses
[50:16] intercession for the people chapters
[50:20] 34-39 include Moses making new tablets
[50:24] of stone that were renewal of the
[50:26] Covenant Moses shining face reminds you
[50:30] a bit of the mount Transfiguration he
[50:32] comes down from this mountain with a
[50:34] shining face Sabbath regulations
[50:37] contributions for the Tabernacle H and
[50:41] the manufacturer of the various pieces
[50:44] of the Tabernacle the ark the table the
[50:47] lampstand the altars the bronze Basin
[50:50] the court the Priestly
[50:53] garments you might ask yourself a
[50:55] question question here they're taking up
[50:57] this this
[50:58] collection for the Tabernacle but why
[51:00] did they need to do that they're in
[51:02] Midian at the edge of
[51:04] Midian they didn't haul big long poles
[51:07] they didn't haul bolts of linen and all
[51:09] that stuff they needed to make all this
[51:11] stuff from Egypt they had to go to the
[51:14] equivalent of the Home Depot buy that
[51:16] stuff but they had the wealth through
[51:18] that collection that they made so they
[51:19] could get those materials in Midian to
[51:22] do that
[51:24] construction it's it's all it's all very
[51:27] practical chapter 40 concludes Exodus
[51:30] with the assembling of the Tabernacle 11
[51:33] and a half months after arriving at
[51:36] Mount Si from Egypt and the glory of the
[51:39] Lord filling it when the cloud and fire
[51:43] of the Lord lifted they journeyed when
[51:46] it abided they remained
[51:50] encamped well you can't go home just yet
[51:52] but there's your overview we're going to
[51:54] dig down a bit now Exodus is a second
[51:57] book of the pentat or or the TOA it's
[52:00] known as the TOA in in Hebrew and we
[52:03] thinking that it means law but to
[52:05] actually means teaching God told Moses
[52:08] teach the people these
[52:11] things so the first five books were told
[52:14] they were written by Moses now once in
[52:18] Exodus 17 twice in Exodus 34 we read the
[52:21] Lord commanded Moses to write not to
[52:24] recite to be written some generations
[52:27] later Moses was specifically told to
[52:31] write there's controversy about this of
[52:34] course Moses was raised and educated in
[52:37] Egypt the writing of that language used
[52:41] hieroglyphs there was no alphabet used
[52:45] in Egypt as we think of an alphabet
[52:48] Hebrew the language of most of the Old
[52:50] Testament is not Egyptian and it's
[52:52] written with an alphabet of 22 two
[52:55] characters based on
[52:57] consonants most Scholars most people
[53:00] that look at this will say well the
[53:01] earliest Hebrew writing is about 1,000
[53:04] BC around the time of of David and
[53:07] Solomon and and Saul some 450 years
[53:11] after the Exodus thus it was impossible
[53:15] for Moses to write the Books ascribed to
[53:17] him instead it was later scribes who
[53:19] wrote from an oral tradition he
[53:22] spoke well which is it
[53:27] in John's gospel John
[53:30] 5:46 Jesus says or if he believed Moses
[53:34] you would have believed me for he spoke
[53:37] no he wrote Of Me amen he wrote well a
[53:42] fellow named Douglas petrovich 2016
[53:45] published this
[53:47] work and I believe that he was the first
[53:50] person to
[53:51] demonstrate that the uh the Proto
[53:55] consonantal script found in the
[53:58] sin that dates back to this period And
[54:01] even slightly before was actually Hebrew
[54:06] that that prototype alphabet was not
[54:08] Phoenician and Hebrew derived from the
[54:10] Phoenicians it was Hebrew and Phoenician
[54:13] was derived from it and he
[54:17] translates those Works those those uh
[54:20] things that are supposedly
[54:22] Phoenician so he demonstrated
[54:25] that the protoe alphabet was likely
[54:28] begun or developed in the time of
[54:33] Joseph in fact in this book he presents
[54:38] evidence that Joseph's son Manasseh
[54:41] played a role in developing the world's
[54:45] first alphabet which was a Hebrew
[54:48] alphabet
[54:50] therefore Moses wrote
[54:53] it now
[54:57] in Deuteronomy I mean in Exodus excuse
[54:59] me I I'm old it's okay there are no
[55:03] direct prophecies in Exodus of a coming
[55:05] Messiah as there is in Deuteronomy but
[55:08] Moses is a model or sometimes we use the
[55:11] word type of Christ and that speaks
[55:15] volumes the Journey of the nation of
[55:17] Israel from
[55:19] bondage through the waters of the Red
[55:21] Sea to Mount Si ultimately to the land
[55:24] of promise is also a poignant parallel
[55:27] of our Christian Life walk from Egypt
[55:31] from a life of sin through baptism
[55:34] through the Red Sea then a character
[55:37] building Journey for as long as our life
[55:41] lasts and at the end entry to Heaven
[55:45] itself the promised
[55:47] land we often look for types of Christ
[55:50] in Old Testament individuals and by type
[55:53] we mean an analogy ology a similarity a
[55:56] model a simile a metaphor an
[55:59] allegory the the the dictionary
[56:01] definition or at least one of the
[56:03] dictionaries says that a specific
[56:05] definition of type as a noun is quote a
[56:09] person or thing as in the Old Testament
[56:12] believe to foreshadow another as in the
[56:14] New Testament type as a verb can mean to
[56:18] represent in terms of typical
[56:20] characteristics or typify or to
[56:23] represent beforehand as a type A A
[56:28] prefigure Exodus is full of things that
[56:31] are considered types the number and
[56:34] kinds of thread in the Priestly garments
[56:35] the construction of the Tabernacle its
[56:37] fixtures what they represent but as
[56:40] important as these are their inanimate
[56:43] objects tonight I want to focus on lives
[56:48] and interactions with the Lord
[56:51] God again Exodus has no specific
[56:54] prophecy of a messiah but Moses
[56:56] definitely types or prefigures
[57:02] Christ let's look at some of those ways
[57:05] as we Sprint through Exodus there are
[57:08] many more than the ones we'll share
[57:10] tonight but I want to wet your appetite
[57:13] so you'll go home you'll read Exodus
[57:15] you'll look for these things you'll be
[57:17] thinking of the gospels as you read
[57:20] Exodus at moses' Birth Pharaoh tried to
[57:24] kill kill him shortly after Jesus birth
[57:28] Herod tried to kill him e Exodus 1 and
[57:31] he Pharaoh said when you do the office
[57:34] of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see
[57:37] them upon the stools if it be a son then
[57:41] you shall kill him but if it be your
[57:43] daughter then she shall live this is a
[57:46] carving in a temple in Egypt of of of a
[57:50] birthing
[57:52] stool but the midwives feared God God
[57:55] and did not as the king of Egypt
[57:57] commanded them but saved the men
[57:58] children alive skipping to verse 22
[58:02] Pharaoh charged all his people saying
[58:04] every son that is born he shall cast
[58:06] into the river every daughter he shall
[58:10] save a
[58:12] life in Matthew 2 we read then Herod
[58:17] when he saw that he was mocked of the
[58:19] wise men was exceeding wroth and sent
[58:23] forth and slew all the the children that
[58:25] were in Bethlehem and and and that word
[58:27] actually has a male connotation to it so
[58:30] he killed the the male children and in
[58:33] all the coasts thereof from two years
[58:36] old and under according to the time
[58:38] which he had diligently inquired of the
[58:40] wise
[58:42] men both Moses and Jesus were hidden
[58:47] from Death as babies in Exodus 2 there
[58:51] went a man amram of the house of Levi
[58:55] and took to wife a daughter of Levi and
[58:57] the woman joed conceived and bear a son
[59:02] Moses and when she saw him that he was a
[59:04] goodly child she hid him three
[59:08] months Matthew 2 13 and when they the
[59:12] Magi bearing gifts for the young child
[59:14] Jesus were departed behold the angel of
[59:17] the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream
[59:19] saying arise take the young child and
[59:21] his mother and flee into Egypt be thou
[59:24] there until I bring thee word for Herod
[59:26] will seek the young child to destroy
[59:29] him parallel accounts but let's get back
[59:32] to Moses for just a
[59:35] moment he was a descendant
[59:39] of
[59:41] Levi but Jacob despised Levi on his
[59:47] deathbed Jacob cursed him Genesis
[59:50] 49 Simeon and Levi are brethren
[59:55] instruments of Cruelty are in their
[59:58] habitations oh my soul come not thou
[1:00:01] into their secret unto their assembly
[1:00:04] mine honor be not thou United for in
[1:00:07] their anger they slew a man and in their
[1:00:10] self will they dig down a wall that's
[1:00:13] referring to the slaughter in sheim and
[1:00:15] revenge for Dina dig down a wall is a
[1:00:18] strange expression but if you look it up
[1:00:21] and research what it's talking about it
[1:00:23] means they hamstrung the cattle
[1:00:25] they were just cruel brutal vicious
[1:00:29] cursed be their anger for it was fierce
[1:00:32] and their wrath for it was cruel I will
[1:00:36] divide them in Jacob and scatter them in
[1:00:41] Israel is there a parallel with Jesus we
[1:00:46] read in John chapter one now Philip with
[1:00:50] of BEDA the city of Andrew and Peter
[1:00:53] Philip finded Nathaniel and said unto
[1:00:55] him we have found him of whom Moses in
[1:00:58] the law and the prophets did right Jesus
[1:01:00] of Nazareth the son of
[1:01:03] Joseph and Nathaniel said unto
[1:01:06] him can there any good thing come out of
[1:01:11] Nazareth Philip said unto him come and
[1:01:15] see can anything good come out of
[1:01:20] Nazareth can anything good come out of
[1:01:23] Levi
[1:01:26] when each was saved from the King's
[1:01:28] death decree he was watched over by a
[1:01:31] young woman named
[1:01:33] Miriam Exodus 2 when she jocked moses'
[1:01:37] mother could no longer hide him could
[1:01:39] hide Moses she took for him an ark of
[1:01:41] bull rushes and dobbed it with slime and
[1:01:43] with pitch put the child therein and
[1:01:46] laid it in the flags by the river's
[1:01:47] Brink and and his sister Miriam stood
[1:01:51] AAR off to wit what would be done to him
[1:01:55] and she arranges for her mother to nurse
[1:01:57] Moses for Pharaoh's daughter and Matthew
[1:02:00] 2 after getting this warning in a dream
[1:02:03] when he Joseph arose he took the young
[1:02:05] child Jesus and his mother it says Mary
[1:02:08] the Hebrew version of that is Miriam
[1:02:10] same name by night and departed un Egypt
[1:02:14] and was there until the death of Herod
[1:02:16] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:02:17] spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying
[1:02:19] out of Egypt have I called my
[1:02:23] son
[1:02:25] both were adopted as babies Exodus 2 the
[1:02:29] child Moses grew and jocked brought him
[1:02:32] unto Pharaoh's daughter which I believe
[1:02:34] is a very famous person in Egypt known
[1:02:38] as hat shepit and he Moses became her
[1:02:42] son and she called his name Moses and
[1:02:44] she said because I drew him out of the
[1:02:47] water she adopted him Matthew 1 then
[1:02:52] Joseph being raised from sleep did as
[1:02:54] the angel of the Lord had bid him and
[1:02:55] took unto him his wife Mary and knew
[1:02:58] were not till she had brought forth her
[1:03:00] firstborn son and Joseph called his name
[1:03:03] Jesus
[1:03:06] adopted both growing up had a secret
[1:03:10] identity Moses as a Hebrew Jesus as the
[1:03:15] Son of God Exodus 2 it came to pass in
[1:03:18] those days when Moses was
[1:03:20] grown that he went out unto his Brethren
[1:03:23] and looked on their bird
[1:03:25] they thought he was an Egyptian high
[1:03:27] ranking guy he was you know a prince in
[1:03:31] Egypt he looked upon their
[1:03:34] burdens and spied an Egyptian smiting a
[1:03:37] Hebrew one of his
[1:03:40] Brethren and Moses looked this way and
[1:03:44] that
[1:03:45] way and when he didn't see anyone he
[1:03:49] killed he slew the Egyptian and hit him
[1:03:50] in the
[1:03:53] sand Mark
[1:03:55] 6 people are saying to one another is
[1:03:58] not this the carpenter the son of Mary
[1:04:01] the brother of James and Joseph and
[1:04:03] Judah and Simon are not his sisters here
[1:04:05] with us and they were offended at him
[1:04:09] because they didn't know who he really
[1:04:12] was both sat on
[1:04:16] Wells and saved a woman in a foreign
[1:04:20] land Exodus 2 now when Pharaoh heard
[1:04:23] this thing about Moses killing an
[1:04:25] Egyptian he sought to slay Moses but
[1:04:28] Moses fled from the face of pharaoh and
[1:04:30] dwelt in the land of
[1:04:33] Midian huh interesting place and he sat
[1:04:37] down by a well now the priest of Midian
[1:04:40] had seven daughters and they came and
[1:04:42] Drew water and filled the troughs to
[1:04:44] water their father's flock and the
[1:04:46] Shepherds came and drove them away but
[1:04:48] Moses stood up and helped them and
[1:04:50] watered their
[1:04:51] flock and when they came to R Ru their
[1:04:54] father he said how is it that you're
[1:04:57] come so soon
[1:05:00] today and they said an Egyptian
[1:05:03] delivered us out of the hand of the
[1:05:04] Shepherds and also Drew water enough for
[1:05:07] us and watered the
[1:05:09] flock in John
[1:05:13] 4 Jesus is in
[1:05:16] Samaria Jacob's Well was there Jesus
[1:05:19] therefore being wearied with his journey
[1:05:21] sat thus on the well it was about the
[1:05:23] sixth hour it was
[1:05:24] noon there cometh a woman of Samaria to
[1:05:28] draw water Jesus said unto her give me
[1:05:32] to
[1:05:33] drink
[1:05:35] parallels Moses married a gentile bride
[1:05:39] Exodus to Moses was content to dwell
[1:05:42] with the man of Midian Jethro and he
[1:05:44] gave Moses
[1:05:46] Zapora his daughter he married a
[1:05:50] midianite are there any Gentiles in here
[1:05:54] here who believe that you're part of the
[1:05:56] bride of
[1:05:57] Christ oh we have another parallel
[1:06:01] memory
[1:06:03] jog we talked about Genesis
[1:06:06] recently who was Joseph sold to to take
[1:06:10] him into slavery in
[1:06:14] Egypt correct midianite
[1:06:18] Israelites Genesis
[1:06:20] 37:28 now Moses is marrying a woman from
[1:06:25] Midian remember the theme of Genesis
[1:06:29] Grace both returned to the land from
[1:06:32] whence they had fled after the death of
[1:06:33] the king who tried to kill them Exodus 4
[1:06:36] the Lord said unto Moses in Midian go
[1:06:39] return into Egypt for all the men are
[1:06:41] dead which sought thy life Matthew 2 but
[1:06:46] when Herod was dead behold an angel of
[1:06:48] the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph
[1:06:50] in Egypt saying arise and take the Young
[1:06:54] child and his mother and go into the
[1:06:56] land of Israel for they are dead which
[1:06:59] sought the young child's
[1:07:02] life parallels types both Moses and
[1:07:06] Jesus were shepherds Exodus 3 now Moses
[1:07:09] kept the flock of Jethro his
[1:07:11] father-in-law the priest of
[1:07:15] Midian John
[1:07:17] 10 Jesus said unto them again verily
[1:07:21] verily I say unto you I am the door of
[1:07:23] the Sheep all that ever came before me
[1:07:25] are thieves robbers but the Sheep did
[1:07:28] not hear them I am the door by me if any
[1:07:31] man enter in he shall be saved and shall
[1:07:33] go in and out and find pasture thief
[1:07:36] cometh not but for to steal to kill to
[1:07:39] destroy I am come that they might have
[1:07:41] life that they might have it more
[1:07:44] abundantly I am the Good Shepherd the
[1:07:48] Good Shepherd gives his life for the
[1:07:52] Sheep
[1:07:54] each began his ministry in the
[1:07:56] wilderness let's start with Jesus's
[1:07:58] time it came to pass in those days that
[1:08:01] Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and
[1:08:04] was baptized of John in Jordan and
[1:08:08] straightway coming up out of the water
[1:08:09] he saw the heavens opened and his Spirit
[1:08:11] like a dove descending upon him and
[1:08:13] there came a voice from Heaven saying
[1:08:14] Thou Art my beloved Son in whom I am
[1:08:18] well pleased and immediately the spirit
[1:08:22] driveth him into the wilderness
[1:08:24] and after 40
[1:08:26] days we read in this time Luke Jesus
[1:08:30] returned in the power of the spirit
[1:08:32] Power Miracles into Galilee and there
[1:08:36] went out a Fame of him throughout all
[1:08:38] the region
[1:08:41] roundabout
[1:08:42] Exodus now Moses kept the flock of
[1:08:45] jeffro his father-in-law the priest of
[1:08:46] Midian and he led the flock to the
[1:08:48] backside of the desert in other words
[1:08:51] the
[1:08:52] wilderness and came to the Mountain of
[1:08:55] God even to Horeb and the angel of the
[1:08:59] Lord appeared unto him in a flame of
[1:09:00] fire out of the midst of a bush and he
[1:09:02] looked and behold the bush burned with
[1:09:06] fire and the Bush was not
[1:09:10] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[1:09:13] aside see this great sight why the bush
[1:09:17] is not
[1:09:18] burnt and when the Lord saw that he
[1:09:20] turned aside to see God called unto him
[1:09:22] out of the midst of the Bush and said
[1:09:24] Moses
[1:09:26] Moses he knows our name he knows your
[1:09:30] name he knows my name when he spoke to
[1:09:32] Jacob he said Jacob Jacob here am I
[1:09:35] Moses
[1:09:37] Moses god knew his name and called him
[1:09:39] by it and Moses
[1:09:42] said here am
[1:09:44] I skipping down to verse
[1:09:46] n now therefore Behold The Cry of the
[1:09:49] children of Israel has come unto me and
[1:09:52] I have also seen the oppression
[1:09:54] wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them
[1:09:56] come now therefore and I will send thee
[1:09:59] unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[1:10:01] forth my people the children of Israel
[1:10:04] out of
[1:10:05] Egypt a couple of verses later I just
[1:10:08] will tell you about it Moses we know he
[1:10:11] was raised in Pharaoh's house he he
[1:10:13] understood diplomacy he
[1:10:16] understood respect so he's being spoken
[1:10:20] to by this voice out of this bush
[1:10:24] and God says go on down to Egypt and he
[1:10:27] says
[1:10:28] well yeah he says well when I get there
[1:10:32] they're going to ask what's the name of
[1:10:34] the god that sent you what should I
[1:10:38] say think of the
[1:10:41] context they've been in Egypt for 400
[1:10:44] years
[1:10:46] 430 they don't have an established
[1:10:48] religion they don't have any established
[1:10:51] worship they none of this all they have
[1:10:54] is is this story that that
[1:10:57] God El Elohim uh appeared to Abraham and
[1:11:02] made a promise and and and and told him
[1:11:04] to go down to Egypt and they turned us
[1:11:07] into slaves down here this wasn't such a
[1:11:09] wonderful thing and so what are they
[1:11:12] doing there they are involved in
[1:11:14] Egyptian culture Moses is raised in
[1:11:17] Pharaoh's house he's involved in
[1:11:19] Egyptian culture so what Moses is really
[1:11:22] saying is
[1:11:24] what what's your name which God are you
[1:11:26] how do I identify you are you Aman are
[1:11:28] you Osiris are you Horus are you P are
[1:11:31] you anabas Toth
[1:11:34] Reay which name because if I know the
[1:11:36] name then I know and and they'll know
[1:11:38] who you are and God
[1:11:40] says I am that I
[1:11:43] am no I'm not one of those guys you're a
[1:11:45] little
[1:11:47] confused uh a little a little bonus
[1:11:50] question since we're at the burning bush
[1:11:52] right now and God's talking to Moses
[1:11:54] we don't have any record of God speaking
[1:11:56] to anybody after he spoke to Jacob at uh
[1:12:00] at Beva that I'm aware of until we get
[1:12:02] to the burning bush there's no other
[1:12:05] accounts in Exodus or in Genesis or in
[1:12:07] this point Exodus so who did God speak
[1:12:11] to first in the book of
[1:12:17] Exodus I'm not getting a lot of
[1:12:20] response
[1:12:22] Aaron you say wait what are you talking
[1:12:25] about this is chapter three and and God
[1:12:27] doesn't tell Aaron to go there until
[1:12:29] like chapter
[1:12:32] five Moses is complaining and he says
[1:12:35] God I I can't talk very well and says
[1:12:38] the Lord got angry with him and said
[1:12:42] well I created your mouth I create and
[1:12:45] Moses still says oh no no no no no so
[1:12:47] okay well how about Aaron how about your
[1:12:49] brother Aaron he he can speak pretty
[1:12:51] good Moses says yeah yeah yeah Aaron
[1:12:54] and what does God
[1:12:55] say he's already on his way he's going
[1:12:58] to meet you here at this mountain wow
[1:13:01] and now that other chapter where God
[1:13:02] appeared to Aaron and said go to your
[1:13:05] brother Moses and Aaron goes into the
[1:13:08] Wilderness it's not sequential with
[1:13:09] chapter 3 that actually happened ahead
[1:13:11] of time because Aaron's already on his
[1:13:14] way so God already spoke to Aaron before
[1:13:17] he revealed himself to Moses I'm sure
[1:13:20] you already knew that but I was excited
[1:13:22] about that because because I was talking
[1:13:23] to Heather day and saying you know it
[1:13:25] seems like there's a contradiction here
[1:13:26] about about how could what what's going
[1:13:28] but then yeah Lyall go back read oh yeah
[1:13:34] okay
[1:13:35] simple okay moving on both commanded the
[1:13:39] Wind and
[1:13:40] Sea which obeyed in Exodus
[1:13:43] 14 Moses stretched out his hand over the
[1:13:46] sea and the Lord caused the sea to go
[1:13:49] back by a strong East Wind all that
[1:13:50] night and made the sea dried land and
[1:13:52] the waters were divided
[1:13:55] invited H Matthew 8 when Jesus was
[1:13:59] entered into a ship his disciples
[1:14:01] followed him and behold there Rose a
[1:14:02] great Tempest in the sea in so much that
[1:14:04] the ship was covered with the
[1:14:06] waves but he was asleep he must have
[1:14:09] been really tired and his disciples came
[1:14:12] to him and awoke him saying Lord save us
[1:14:15] we perish a bit like the Israelites
[1:14:18] asking Moses why did you bring us here
[1:14:21] to
[1:14:22] die
[1:14:24] and Jesus said to them why are ye
[1:14:28] fearful oh ye of little faith then he
[1:14:32] arose rebuked the winds in the
[1:14:35] seas and there was a great
[1:14:37] calm but the men marveled saying what
[1:14:41] manner of man is this that even the
[1:14:44] winds and the Sea obey him what manner
[1:14:48] of man is
[1:14:49] Moses that even the winds in the sea
[1:14:52] what manner of man will Joshua be when
[1:14:55] even the river obeys him both were
[1:14:59] almost
[1:15:00] Stoned by those that they were sent to
[1:15:04] save Exodus 17 we read Moses Cried unto
[1:15:08] the Lord saying what shall I do unto
[1:15:10] this people they be almost ready to
[1:15:13] Stone
[1:15:14] me John chapter 8 Jesus said unto them
[1:15:18] verily verily I say unto you before
[1:15:22] Abraham was
[1:15:24] I
[1:15:25] am then took they up stones to cast at
[1:15:29] him but Jesus hid himself and went out
[1:15:31] of the temple going through the midst of
[1:15:33] them and so passed
[1:15:39] by you'll notice I skipped the Passover
[1:15:42] communion the Miracles that happened in
[1:15:45] Egypt were constrained by time
[1:15:49] please please read Exodus see what other
[1:15:54] types and parallels you find if if you
[1:15:56] find it a little awkward to understand
[1:15:58] some of the wording so read a modern
[1:16:00] translation we're not digging for
[1:16:02] Doctrine we're looking for parallels
[1:16:04] we're looking for types we're looking
[1:16:06] for Jesus Christ in the book of
[1:16:12] Exodus one of the big controversies in
[1:16:15] Exodus has to do with the Exodus itself
[1:16:19] specifically what route did Moses take
[1:16:21] them where Mount
[1:16:24] Si where did they cross the Red Sea and
[1:16:27] so forth since it was a Wandering
[1:16:30] nomadic group there are no
[1:16:32] archaeological artifacts to dig up they
[1:16:34] didn't build any walled cities there no
[1:16:37] Wells that are identified that they dug
[1:16:40] no settlements they got watera from Iraq
[1:16:41] they didn't need Wells no records from
[1:16:44] the period of The Exodus and the history
[1:16:46] of Egypt or the conquered Canaanites
[1:16:49] although there are definite hints and
[1:16:52] the the surviving Egyptian records along
[1:16:55] the line of pauses and military activity
[1:16:59] at just the right
[1:17:04] time the map we have here you in the
[1:17:06] back have to trust me there's a map up
[1:17:09] here I want to show you a map of the
[1:17:11] last portion of the Journey of Abram
[1:17:13] from Mesopotamia to Canaan the important
[1:17:16] thing to notice on this map is the
[1:17:18] territory of Egypt it's in lavender
[1:17:22] you'll notice that the Sinai Peninsula
[1:17:24] was controlled by or part of Egypt there
[1:17:27] wasn't much population there but Egypt
[1:17:30] ran the place I've added three red
[1:17:33] arrows that roughly correspond to the
[1:17:35] suggested routes Moses took at the
[1:17:37] miraculous crossing of the Red Sea the
[1:17:40] top one is in a marshy area sometimes
[1:17:42] thought of as a sea of reeds the middle
[1:17:45] one is near a set of lakes also bit
[1:17:48] marshy the lowest one is at the Red Sea
[1:17:51] the section We Now call call the Gulf of
[1:17:55] Suez the problem with all of these is
[1:17:58] after they crossed the Red Sea they'd
[1:18:00] still be in Egypt the portion of the
[1:18:03] Egyptian Army that didn't pursue them
[1:18:06] would be
[1:18:07] waiting the Egyptian Army knowing the
[1:18:10] area why would they risk themselves
[1:18:13] going through the marsh they go around
[1:18:15] to the other side and wait for him to
[1:18:17] come out Moses glad you split the sea
[1:18:19] but guess what we got you now they
[1:18:21] wouldn't have time to sing and dance and
[1:18:23] rejoice and be happy they'd be running
[1:18:25] for their
[1:18:27] lives
[1:18:29] so another thing that I added uh I
[1:18:33] didn't mark it here so much but in the
[1:18:36] by that lowest Arrow a bit further down
[1:18:38] actually there's a mine a turquoise and
[1:18:42] copper mine that the Egyptians ran and
[1:18:45] Hebrew slaves were in there um we'll
[1:18:49] we'll get to that in just a moment
[1:18:51] because we we find out now that after
[1:18:54] they crossed the Red Sea what
[1:18:56] happened Exodus 15 then sang Moses and
[1:19:01] the children of Israel this song unto
[1:19:03] the Lord and spake saying I will sing
[1:19:05] unto the Lord for he hath triumphed
[1:19:08] gloriously the horse and his rider hath
[1:19:11] he thrown into the
[1:19:13] sea the Lord is my strength and song he
[1:19:17] has become my salvation he is my God I
[1:19:21] will prepare him at habit my father's
[1:19:24] God I will exalt him well this is
[1:19:27] prophetic as well in a foundational key
[1:19:30] of Exodus which will cover at the end of
[1:19:32] tonight's lesson Miriam and the women
[1:19:35] took timberl and danced verse 20 Miriam
[1:19:38] the propheus the sister of Aaron and and
[1:19:41] of Moses took a timberl in her hand and
[1:19:44] all the women went out after her with
[1:19:46] timberl and with dances and Miriam
[1:19:48] answered them sing ye to the Lord for he
[1:19:51] hath triumphed gloriously the the horse
[1:19:53] in his rer hath he thrown into the
[1:19:56] sea if they' crossed and walked into the
[1:19:59] rest of the army they would have been
[1:20:01] running for their lives not singing and
[1:20:03] dancing after all they still would have
[1:20:06] been in Egypt or Egyptian
[1:20:09] territory but they had such a miraculous
[1:20:13] and complete deliverance that the song
[1:20:16] Moses sang that we just saw a tiny
[1:20:18] portion of it's yet another
[1:20:21] parallel with Jesus and the redeemed he
[1:20:25] rescued those go from Exodus 15 to
[1:20:28] Revelation
[1:20:30] 15 and I John saw as it were a sea of
[1:20:33] glass mingled with
[1:20:35] fire and them that had gotten the
[1:20:37] victory over the Beast and over his
[1:20:39] image and over his Mark and over the
[1:20:41] number of his name stand on the sea of
[1:20:42] glass having the harps of God bit like
[1:20:46] Miriam's
[1:20:47] timberl and they sing the song of
[1:20:51] Moses the servant of God the same song
[1:20:56] is
[1:20:57] sung as well as the song of the lamb
[1:21:00] saying great and marvelous are thy Works
[1:21:03] Lord God Almighty just and true are thy
[1:21:06] ways Thou King of
[1:21:10] saints I'm going to show you another
[1:21:14] map this is a possible Exodus route I
[1:21:18] suspect it's a bit different than most
[1:21:21] that you may have seen
[1:21:25] it shows the Red Sea
[1:21:27] Crossing not near Goan it doesn't show
[1:21:31] Mount Si in the traditional location or
[1:21:33] or in the carum location near be cheva
[1:21:37] carcum is in the territory of Israel
[1:21:40] today and in the promised land borders
[1:21:42] as well Moses never entered into the
[1:21:45] promised land he was forbidden to go
[1:21:46] there so that can't be the right spot
[1:21:50] well I think it's this is very likely
[1:21:52] close to the the actual route the
[1:21:53] important points cuz we can't prove what
[1:21:55] the route was is that one there was an
[1:21:58] exodus there was a red SE Crossing that
[1:22:01] was miraculous the Israelite nation was
[1:22:04] beyond the reach of the angry humiliated
[1:22:08] Egyptians and there is a Mount Si where
[1:22:11] Moses received the Ten Commandments and
[1:22:14] the law you may be surprised to see
[1:22:17] Mount siai and Arabia modern day Saudi
[1:22:21] Arabia the Sinai was essentially under
[1:22:24] Egypt in Moses day in the Egyptian Army
[1:22:27] again they knew the way around it Paul
[1:22:30] wrote in Galatians 4 that Mount Si is in
[1:22:35] Arabia Arabia in the time of Paul was
[1:22:38] not in the siai it was in
[1:22:41] Arabia I've shown copper colored
[1:22:43] encirclements at sucot and
[1:22:46] timna these are near important copper
[1:22:48] and turquoise mines operated by the
[1:22:50] Egyptians during the 18th Dynasty again
[1:22:52] showing that in moses' time Egypt was
[1:22:55] the political entity that ruled SI and
[1:22:58] the mines near what is being shown as
[1:23:01] suod and nobody knows if that's really
[1:23:02] where suod is that's it's based on
[1:23:05] certain speculations I
[1:23:08] suppose but there are graffiti in those
[1:23:12] mines attesting to Hebrew slave miners
[1:23:16] it makes sense the Israelites would have
[1:23:18] come by there to fetch the
[1:23:20] miners Maybe maybe that's where Aaron
[1:23:23] was when he escaped went through the
[1:23:26] Wilderness to meet Moses at Mount Si the
[1:23:30] burning bush at the traditional
[1:23:33] locations of the crossing of the Red Sea
[1:23:34] the Israelite Nation would not have been
[1:23:36] trapped and unable to move here they've
[1:23:40] come down this broad broad path all the
[1:23:42] way around here and boom they can't go
[1:23:45] any further they're up against it they
[1:23:47] can't penetrate through those mountains
[1:23:49] God tells them turn back and Camp by the
[1:23:51] sea so they turn back and Camp by the
[1:23:54] Sea gives Pharaoh time to send his army
[1:23:57] down there and now Pharaoh says
[1:24:02] gotcha okay um I don't want to get into
[1:24:06] too much detail here uh let's read the
[1:24:10] account of the crossing of the sea in
[1:24:13] Exodus
[1:24:15] 14 and by the
[1:24:17] way virtually everyone agrees that
[1:24:20] Midian was here
[1:24:23] uh just to keep it interesting we hope
[1:24:27] okay Exodus 14 the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:24:29] saying Speak unto the children of Israel
[1:24:32] that they turn turn back Retreat it's
[1:24:35] just like the same word as repent and
[1:24:37] encamp before philar between migdall and
[1:24:40] migdall is not a location it just means
[1:24:42] a tower a fort a an observation
[1:24:45] post between migdall and the Sea over
[1:24:49] against bapon before it you shall encamp
[1:24:52] by by the
[1:24:53] Sea for Pharaoh will say of the children
[1:24:56] of Israel they're entangled in the land
[1:25:00] the Wilderness has shut them
[1:25:03] in so they're stopped by geography
[1:25:06] virtually impossible mountains they have
[1:25:08] to turn back and the word from migdall
[1:25:11] reaches pharaoh and I will harden
[1:25:13] Pharaoh's heart and he shall follow
[1:25:16] after them and I will be honored upon
[1:25:18] Pharaoh upon all his host that the
[1:25:21] Egyptians May know that I am the Lord
[1:25:25] and they did
[1:25:27] so the Egyptian religion declared that
[1:25:29] Pharaoh was a God if you study Egyptian
[1:25:32] history you'll recognize that not long
[1:25:35] after the events of Exodus a fellow
[1:25:38] named Annan became the Pharaoh declared
[1:25:40] there was only one God the
[1:25:42] son Moses didn't get the concept of
[1:25:45] monotheism from the
[1:25:47] Egyptians they got it from The
[1:25:50] Exodus skipping to verse
[1:25:53] 15 the Lord said unto Moses wherefore
[1:25:57] criest thou unto me speak unto the
[1:26:00] children of Israel that they go forward
[1:26:02] but lift thou up thy
[1:26:05] stick stretch out thine hand over the
[1:26:07] sea and divide it and the children of
[1:26:11] Israel shall go on dry ground through
[1:26:13] the midst of the sea so what cause the
[1:26:16] waters to be
[1:26:17] divided The Obedience of the Prophet
[1:26:20] holding a stick stretching out his
[1:26:25] hand and Moses stretched out his hand
[1:26:28] over the sea and the Lord caused the sea
[1:26:30] to go back or or by or before a strong
[1:26:33] East Wind all that night made the sea
[1:26:35] dry land the waters were divided the
[1:26:39] East Wind when Heather lived in Israel
[1:26:41] an East Wind would come it was called
[1:26:44] hamim it's a hot dry wind how did they
[1:26:47] go over dry ground the waters parted
[1:26:50] it's pretty soggy you got this hot hot
[1:26:52] dry East Wind somebody turned on the big
[1:26:55] hair dryer dried out that ocean
[1:26:58] floor they can go across they had to
[1:27:00] turn off that big hair dryer before they
[1:27:02] went across right if it was pushed back
[1:27:05] by the wind it would have been past a
[1:27:07] category
[1:27:08] five so anyway you can just Ponder on
[1:27:12] that a little bit if you want the
[1:27:13] children of Israel went into the midst
[1:27:16] of the sea upon the dry ground the
[1:27:19] waters were a wall unto them on their
[1:27:21] right hand and on their left and the
[1:27:24] Egyptians pursued and went in after them
[1:27:26] to the midst of the sea even all
[1:27:27] Pharaoh's horses his chariots his
[1:27:30] Horsemen came to pass that in the
[1:27:33] morning watch the Lord looked under the
[1:27:35] host of the Egyptians through the pillar
[1:27:36] of fire and of the cloud and troubled
[1:27:39] the host of the
[1:27:41] Egyptians he made their chariot wheels
[1:27:44] fall off a little tough to drive your
[1:27:46] chariot when the wheels fell off that
[1:27:49] they drave them heavily so that the
[1:27:51] Egyptian Ian said let us flee from the
[1:27:54] face of Israel for the Lord fights for
[1:27:56] them against the
[1:27:58] Egyptians the Lord said unto Moses
[1:28:00] stretch out thy hand over the sea that
[1:28:03] the waters May Come Again upon the
[1:28:05] Egyptians upon their chariots and upon
[1:28:08] their
[1:28:09] Horsemen again a supernatural act to The
[1:28:12] Obedience of the Prophet Moses stretched
[1:28:15] forth his hand over the sea and the Sea
[1:28:17] returned to to his strength when the
[1:28:20] morning appeared the Egyptians fled
[1:28:21] again against it the Lord overthrew the
[1:28:23] Egyptians in the midst of the Sea The
[1:28:26] Waters returned and covered the Chariots
[1:28:28] and the horsemen and all the host of
[1:28:29] pharaoh that came into the sea after
[1:28:32] them there remained not so much as one
[1:28:36] of
[1:28:38] them now they were safe from the
[1:28:41] Egyptians and in the region of Midian
[1:28:43] where Moses had spent 40 years still
[1:28:46] they didn't depend on moses' knowledge
[1:28:48] of the geography of Midian for him to
[1:28:51] return to Mount Si I in the sight of the
[1:28:52] burning bush that had sent him to Egypt
[1:28:55] instead they followed the cloud and fire
[1:28:58] of the Lord to lead
[1:29:00] them let's skip ahead to being at Mount
[1:29:03] Si in Exodus 19 and 20 we read of the
[1:29:06] Lord descending on the mountain and
[1:29:08] Moses declaring to the people The Ten
[1:29:10] Commandments and a number of other laws
[1:29:12] and regulations Jewish tradition says
[1:29:16] that Moses delivered this to the
[1:29:18] children of Israel on the day of
[1:29:21] Pentecost
[1:29:23] shot another parallel comes down from a
[1:29:27] Mountain of Fire an acts we read about
[1:29:30] tongues of
[1:29:31] fire the
[1:29:33] law the law of Christ filling of the
[1:29:36] holy spirit all these
[1:29:39] parallels Exodus
[1:29:41] 2412 the Lord said unto Moses come up to
[1:29:45] me into the mount and be there and I
[1:29:49] will give thee tables of
[1:29:50] stone and a law and Commandments which I
[1:29:55] have written that thou mayest teach
[1:29:59] them Moses rose up and his Minister
[1:30:02] Joshua Moses went up into the Mount of
[1:30:05] God and he said to the
[1:30:06] elders Terry ye here for us until we
[1:30:09] come again unto you behold Aaron and her
[1:30:13] are with you if any man have any matters
[1:30:15] to do let him come to
[1:30:19] them Moses went up into the mount
[1:30:22] and a cloud covered the
[1:30:25] mount and Moses went into the midst of
[1:30:27] the cloud and got him up into the mount
[1:30:30] and Moses was in the mount 40
[1:30:34] days and 40
[1:30:36] nights like Jesus was absent from the
[1:30:39] people for 40 days after his baptism
[1:30:42] Moses went up to the mountain was gone
[1:30:44] for 40 days when he came down he had the
[1:30:47] stone tablets upon which God had written
[1:30:50] the Ten Commandments
[1:30:53] but Exodus
[1:30:54] 32 when the people saw that Moses
[1:30:57] delayed to come down out of the mount
[1:30:58] the people gathered themselves together
[1:31:00] unto Aaron and said unto him up make us
[1:31:03] Gods which shall go before us as for
[1:31:06] this
[1:31:07] Moses the man that brought us out of the
[1:31:10] land of Egypt we what not we don't have
[1:31:13] a clue what become of
[1:31:16] him and
[1:31:18] Aaron who God spoke to who Moses had
[1:31:22] left in charge in his absence said unto
[1:31:25] them break off the Golden Earrings which
[1:31:27] are in the years of your wives your sons
[1:31:29] your daughters and bring them unto me I
[1:31:31] I wonder if those earrings required
[1:31:34] pierced ears that became a symbol of
[1:31:37] becoming a slave forever of not
[1:31:39] accepting
[1:31:40] Freedom anyway it was earrings all the
[1:31:43] people broke off the Golden Earrings
[1:31:45] which were in their ears and brought
[1:31:47] them unto Aaron and he received them at
[1:31:50] their hand and F fashioned it with a
[1:31:52] graving tool after he had made a molten
[1:31:54] calf and they said these be thy Gods oh
[1:31:58] Israel which brought thee out of the
[1:32:00] land of
[1:32:02] Egypt Aaron left in charge led the
[1:32:06] people astray gave into the
[1:32:08] pressure reminds me of Jesus taking to
[1:32:11] task the priests of his day because they
[1:32:14] replaced the Commandments with
[1:32:17] traditions and these folks are falling
[1:32:19] back under their old ways the people
[1:32:22] gave up on Moses returning like many who
[1:32:25] scoff at the idea of the return of the
[1:32:27] Lord Jesus so they turned to their
[1:32:30] wealth and prosperity which they had
[1:32:32] taken from the Egyptians and worshiped
[1:32:35] it have you ever asked
[1:32:38] yourself
[1:32:40] self why did Aaron make a
[1:32:43] calf why not a crocodile or a or or a
[1:32:47] serpent or any number of other things
[1:32:51] why a
[1:32:53] calf remember the descendants of Jacob
[1:32:55] had lived in Egypt for 430 years they
[1:32:58] had no religious laws no commandment
[1:33:01] other than circumcision that's recorded
[1:33:02] and Egyptians not everywhere but it it
[1:33:07] was it was not uncommon for circumcision
[1:33:10] to occur amongst the Egyptians as well
[1:33:13] they were surrounded by the religion of
[1:33:14] Egypt atheistic Idol based worship they
[1:33:17] were eventually enslaved with no clear
[1:33:20] religion only an oral tradition that
[1:33:22] there was a god of their ancestors that
[1:33:25] told them to go to Egypt and get
[1:33:27] enslaved it's only reasonable to assume
[1:33:29] that they worshiped Egyptian gods
[1:33:31] perhaps in addition to some sort of
[1:33:33] worship or acknowledgement of Elohim no
[1:33:36] wonder the first commandment was you
[1:33:37] shall have no other gods before
[1:33:41] me the Miracles Moses wrought in his
[1:33:44] contest with Pharaoh were known to the
[1:33:46] Hebrews and served in part to establish
[1:33:49] God's power and Moses relationship to to
[1:33:52] the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob as
[1:33:55] they made their way to Mount Si they
[1:33:57] constantly
[1:33:58] complained even after the miracle
[1:34:00] crossing the Red Sea they were still
[1:34:03] unconvinced or they would not have asked
[1:34:05] Aaron to make an idol surely the god
[1:34:07] that can open the Red Sea bring us
[1:34:09] through destroy bring us Mana bring us
[1:34:11] Quail do all this stuff can keep Moses
[1:34:13] alive up there for 40 days we just have
[1:34:16] to wait a little
[1:34:17] while and frankly Aaron probably would
[1:34:20] have agreed
[1:34:22] would not have agreed if he didn't
[1:34:23] Harbor some
[1:34:25] doubts so why a
[1:34:28] calf recall the dreams of pharaoh that
[1:34:31] were interpreted by Joseph were of
[1:34:33] cattle seven fat ones consumed by seven
[1:34:38] starving
[1:34:40] ones it turns out that among the
[1:34:43] pantheon of Egyptian gods and goddesses
[1:34:46] there was one called hatur she was an
[1:34:49] Egyptian goddess which was considered to
[1:34:51] be the symbolic mother of the Pharaohs
[1:34:53] she's also the goddess of music dance
[1:34:56] Joy love sexuality and maternal care she
[1:34:59] was represented as a
[1:35:02] cow when Heather and I were in Egypt in
[1:35:04] 2021 we saw many pillars capped with
[1:35:07] carvings of a human head with cow ears
[1:35:09] yet another symbol of
[1:35:13] hatur when Moses came down from the
[1:35:15] mountain he was very angry with the
[1:35:17] people for falling into their old ways
[1:35:19] smash the stone tablets like Jesus
[1:35:21] turning over the tables in the temple
[1:35:23] scolding them for having turned a House
[1:35:25] of Prayer into a den of
[1:35:27] Thieves parallels but notice God was
[1:35:32] about to destroy them and Moses
[1:35:35] interceded for them before he came down
[1:35:38] and even after the destruction of the
[1:35:40] calf Idol Moses was still the deliverer
[1:35:43] God was still
[1:35:46] Furious Exodus 32:30 it came to pass on
[1:35:49] the tomorrow the day after destroying
[1:35:52] the idol there were 3,000 worshippers at
[1:35:54] that Idol that were killed that what is
[1:35:58] 3,000 in one day make you think about
[1:36:00] the book of
[1:36:03] Acts on the tomorrow after destroying
[1:36:06] the idol Moses said unto the people you
[1:36:09] have sinned a great sin now I will go up
[1:36:12] unto the Lord per Adventure I can make
[1:36:15] an atonement for your
[1:36:19] sin Moses returned unto the Lord
[1:36:22] Lord and said oh this people have sinned
[1:36:26] a great sin and have made them gods of
[1:36:31] gold yet now if thou will forgive their
[1:36:34] sin and if not blot me I pray thee out
[1:36:40] of thy book which thou Hast
[1:36:43] written in the New Testament what did
[1:36:45] Jesus
[1:36:46] do interceded on our behalf gave his
[1:36:50] life to redeem us brother uh uh Paul
[1:36:54] Murray in the Sunday school class for
[1:36:56] the teenagers has written on the board
[1:36:58] there that U uh he had no sin but ours
[1:37:04] wow we have no
[1:37:07] righteousness but
[1:37:10] his there are so many lessons in this
[1:37:13] book all I could do is ask the Lord to
[1:37:16] help me know which to bring out forgive
[1:37:19] me if if I've overlooked miss something
[1:37:22] that should have been mentioned this
[1:37:24] evening I'd like to
[1:37:26] close with a flashback to the burning
[1:37:29] bush if the musicians would please come
[1:37:32] at this
[1:37:33] time it's foundational to the Book of
[1:37:36] Exodus and
[1:37:38] explains why God did all of this as a
[1:37:41] result it's foundational to the Jewish
[1:37:43] faith and to our faith which branched
[1:37:46] out from Judaism so long ago read with
[1:37:49] me please from Exodus chapter 6
[1:37:53] God spake unto Moses and said unto him I
[1:37:56] am the Lord I appeared unto Abraham unto
[1:38:00] Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God
[1:38:03] Almighty Elohim but by my name Jehovah
[1:38:08] Yahweh was I not known even to
[1:38:11] them I have also established my Covenant
[1:38:15] with them to give them the land of
[1:38:17] Canaan the land of their pilgrimage
[1:38:19] wherein they were strangers
[1:38:21] I've also heard the groaning of the
[1:38:24] children of Israel whom the Egyptians
[1:38:26] keep in bondage and I have remembered my
[1:38:30] Covenant wherefore say unto the children
[1:38:34] of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring
[1:38:38] you out from under the burdens of the
[1:38:42] Egyptians I will rid you out of their
[1:38:45] bondage I will redeem you with a
[1:38:48] stretched out arm and with with great
[1:38:52] judgments he hears our prayers he breaks
[1:38:56] the shackles of
[1:38:59] sin and I will take you to me for a
[1:39:04] people and I will be to you a god other
[1:39:08] translations say I will be your
[1:39:11] God this isn't you'll have a lot of
[1:39:14] descendants this is
[1:39:16] relationship this is
[1:39:19] adoption ye shall know that I am the
[1:39:23] Lord your God which bringeth you out
[1:39:26] from under the burdens of the
[1:39:29] Egyptians the weight of sin and its
[1:39:33] consequences by Grace his
[1:39:36] provision not our efforts apart from
[1:39:40] him and I will bring you into the land
[1:39:43] concerning the which I did swear to give
[1:39:45] it to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob I
[1:39:48] will give it to you for heritage
[1:39:52] I am the
[1:39:54] Lord and the New Testament
[1:39:57] parallel we started this evening reading
[1:40:00] from the First Gospel
[1:40:02] Matthew we'll end with a reading from
[1:40:04] the last gospel John John 14 Jesus
[1:40:08] speaking let not your heart be troubled
[1:40:12] you believe in God believe also in
[1:40:16] me in my father's house are many
[1:40:19] mansions if it were not so I would have
[1:40:21] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[1:40:26] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:40:30] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:40:35] myself that where I am there ye may be
[1:40:44] also I I'd like to sing a
[1:40:47] song and I'd like you that know it to
[1:40:51] sing it with me and you that don't know
[1:40:52] it to learn it really fast so you can
[1:40:55] sing it with me the the tune comes from
[1:40:58] a song called one more exodus by a group
[1:41:00] called the rambos back in
[1:41:03] 1969 but the
[1:41:06] words this is the same first two verses
[1:41:09] but the third verse has been replaced
[1:41:10] with two more verses that were written
[1:41:12] by uh sister Rebecca Smith when Heather
[1:41:16] when I was in the Army in in at Fort
[1:41:18] Campbell the 101st Airborne
[1:41:21] 49 years ago um and 1974 we went to the
[1:41:26] meetings in Jeffersonville at brandom
[1:41:28] Tabernacle it was either the Easter
[1:41:30] meetings or the or or the uh Labor Day
[1:41:33] meetings but I'm pretty certain it was
[1:41:34] the Easter meetings and sister Bea
[1:41:37] played the song and
[1:41:38] I wrote the words down because I was
[1:41:42] impressed with it anyway it's I i' I've
[1:41:45] entitled it the Third Exodus so please
[1:41:49] bear with me but please sing with
[1:41:54] me in the days of Old King Pharaoh God's

[1:42:07] grave they cried to God in heaven our

[1:45:40] read a scripture but before I
[1:45:45] um people people make mistakes sometimes
[1:45:49] and I uh if I could just stay between
[1:45:52] Genesis and Revelation I think I'd do
[1:45:55] really
[1:45:55] well but but instead sometimes I st
[1:45:59] things I was uh before
[1:46:02] service as I was I was greeting the
[1:46:04] people I talked about the boys back
[1:46:06] there those boys have been in church
[1:46:07] more than I have over the past few weeks

[1:46:32] to my heart as all your family is um I
[1:46:36] want to read a scripture brother
[1:46:40] Lyall was as he was
[1:46:43] talking as he was bringing
[1:46:46] out the
[1:46:48] parallels between Moses and Jesus and he
[1:46:52] was placing Jesus here in this Old
[1:46:55] Testament and I got just so excited we
[1:47:02] know most of us know the story of Exodus
[1:47:06] we know Moses and the bull rushes and
[1:47:09] and Pharaoh's sister taking taking the
[1:47:11] baby out and we know him growing up and
[1:47:13] then him going into the Wilderness and
[1:47:15] and the the um the burning bush sending
[1:47:19] him back and then and then him coming
[1:47:21] and getting the people and God bringing
[1:47:23] 10 plagues upon Egypt and bringing them
[1:47:25] out and bringing them into the
[1:47:27] Wilderness those are wonderful
[1:47:30] stories but I want to I want to place
[1:47:34] emphasis on what our brother did tonight
[1:47:38] and I would encourage you to come back
[1:47:40] and to listen to this sermon tonight I
[1:47:43] want to read to you something out of the
[1:47:45] New Testament of Acts the last chapter
[1:47:49] in the book of Acts
[1:47:51] this is the Apostle Paul this is the
[1:47:54] greatest teacher that I think that has
[1:47:56] ever struck the Earth this Apostle
[1:47:59] Paul acts chap 28 verse 23 this is when
[1:48:04] Paul goes back to
[1:48:06] Rome and he's imprisoned in
[1:48:09] Rome and watch what the Apostle B Paul
[1:48:14] does he does the same thing that our
[1:48:16] brother Lyall did right here listen to
[1:48:19] this
[1:48:21] and when they had appointed him a day
[1:48:24] this is Paul remember he's he's under
[1:48:26] house
[1:48:27] arrest there came many to him into his
[1:48:31] lodging to whom he
[1:48:34] expounded and testified the kingdom of
[1:48:38] God persuading them concerning
[1:48:42] Jesus both out of the law of
[1:48:46] Moses and out of the prophets from
[1:48:49] Mourning
[1:48:50] until
[1:48:52] evening exactly what our brother did we
[1:48:55] can learn the stories and the stories
[1:48:57] are encouraging but what brother Lyall
[1:48:59] did is brother Lyall took Moses the man
[1:49:03] of God he took Exodus and he said look
[1:49:06] here is the Old Testament God and here
[1:49:09] is the New Testament God and they're the
[1:49:12] same one it is Jesus Christ in the Old
[1:49:15] Testament and it's Jesus Christ in the

[1:56:34] brother Bobby wz today and brother Tom

[1:56:48] it over to me and with things that are

[1:56:53] in front of us and the brothers are
[1:56:54] going to be and the sisters are going to
[1:56:56] be very very busy in what's coming up so
[1:57:01] I just felt that it wasn't the Lord's
[1:57:02] will for us to do Harmony this year but
[1:57:06] I do think Harmony in the desert is very
[1:57:09] very important and I want to continue on
[1:57:11] with the tradition that brother Bobby
[1:57:13] had on his heart years ago and um so we
[1:57:17] will be har having Harmony in the desert
[1:57:20] next year but this year I just felt it
[1:57:22] wasn't the Lord's will for us to do it
