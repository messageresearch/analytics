[26:21] of thy
[26:22] Wings they shall be abundantly satisfied
[26:26] with the fatness of thy house and thou
[26:27] shalt make them drink of the river of

[26:31] Pleasures for with thee is the Fountain
[26:34] of Life in thy light shall we see
[26:37] light oh continue thy loving kindness
[26:40] unto them that Know Thee and thy
[26:42] righteousness to the upright in
[26:44] heart
[26:45] amen I read that today and I said I just
[26:48] want to share
[26:49] that we and ourselves have no good to
[26:53] offer but in thy light I receive my
[26:56] light and I appreciate that from the
[26:57] Lord so we have some prayer requests and
[27:01] then tonight we'll be listening to the
[27:02] second half of why people are so tossed
[27:06] about so and those you've you've heard
[27:09] and youve followed through I'm brother
[27:10] Billy Paul I check for an update today I
[27:13] didn't see any updates but continue to
[27:16] remember brother Billy Paul and the
[27:18] whole family and the whole family of God
[27:20] because of of who brother Billy Paul is
[27:24] so and then some of you have may may
[27:26] have heard but Brother Don Reagan's
[27:28] daughter um Erica Parker passed away and
[27:32] she left four
[27:34] daughters my daughter Elizabeth um I
[27:37] believe knew her with friends and she
[27:39] said uh she's probably in her early
[27:42] 40s so let's remember the the brother
[27:46] Donnie Reagan and the family and the
[27:48] church and all those affected that by
[27:50] that brother Bobby figurella Jr was
[27:53] supposed to be going in for some MRIs
[27:55] they found some more spots let's
[27:57] remember remember
[27:58] him my brother-in-law Nathan he had been
[28:02] with us here a few months back we prayed
[28:04] for
[28:05] him but he has gotten quite sick they
[28:08] had to do a lot of surgeries they told
[28:10] him they were going to probably have
[28:11] have to amputate his leg but they were
[28:14] able to say that he's right about 60
[28:17] years old pray that God turns his heart
[28:19] back to to him
[28:22] so um my daughter
[28:25] Sarah she says the is has been helping
[28:28] her a lot she's been able to eat
[28:30] better but now it's giving her some
[28:33] severe headaches and and the nerves and
[28:36] has been in a lot of
[28:37] pain but our God Is A
[28:40] Healer she saw the you heard her
[28:42] testimony the other day even her new
[28:44] doctor say you're nothing but a
[28:46] miracle and about 5 years ago the
[28:48] another doctor told her you're nothing
[28:50] but a miracle and hey we serve a miracle
[28:52] working God
[28:54] so my older brother Fred we saw saw him
[28:57] on Sunday they were having the lunch
[29:00] same place we did and he had had that
[29:03] esophagus C cancer and they removed his
[29:06] esophagus Al together take the stomach
[29:10] and tie it up here it's how they do that
[29:14] so when you start eating you start
[29:15] digesting so sometimes it gives them and
[29:17] he told my dad he had been in some pain
[29:20] so again we pray for them but we ask God
[29:23] to get a hold of them and to turn them
[29:25] back to him so
[29:28] and then also let's remember our pastor
[29:30] brother Daniel as he's down in Mexico
[29:33] till through this weekend and I know
[29:36] that while he's there in talking with
[29:38] him it's he's not out by the beach
[29:40] having a good time that's not brother
[29:41] Daniel he studies he he he seeks the
[29:44] Lord and and he prays for us all so if
[29:47] you'll stand with
[29:50] me we know that all things are
[29:53] possible I'll testify that I know that
[29:56] all things are possible we work has
[29:59] slowed down quite a bit and today
[30:00] there's only 4 hours of work and so you
[30:03] know but I know a God who could take a
[30:06] penny and do a whole more a lot more
[30:09] than it can do I can do with a
[30:11] million he's able to multiply he's able
[30:14] to do so our confidence is in him let's
[30:18] just pray Lord we we commit these prayer
[30:21] requests these these folks these
[30:23] families our brother Billy Paul brother
[30:26] Donnie Reagan's the family that is left
[30:28] Lord in the passing of a daughter and a
[30:30] mother
[30:31] Lord and to each one Lord that has a
[30:33] need and every hand that is raised
[30:35] saying Lord I need I need more of you so
[30:38] Lord we commit every one of these
[30:40] requests to you every
[30:42] desire Lord but mostly a desire to just
[30:45] draw closer to you Lord as we see what's
[30:47] happening today in this
[30:49] world and how much there's so much fear
[30:52] and so much anger and there's so much
[30:55] frustration but Lord you said you wouldd
[30:57] watch over us you would keep us Lord as
[31:01] you've protected Israel through all
[31:02] these years
[31:04] Lord because Lord you watch over your
[31:06] children Lord so we commit the rest of
[31:09] this service as we listen to the the
[31:11] second half of this message why people
[31:14] are so tossed about Lord but our anchor
[31:17] is in you Lord we commit it to you now
[31:19] in Jesus Christ's name amen As we sing
[31:21] only believe the the second
[31:24] hand

[32:56] seated
[33:25] for

[33:55] God was B into Christ was poured into
[33:58] the
[33:59] church that day you that I your father
[34:04] father all the privilege that the
[34:06] believer
[34:07] has they only could accept it said
[34:11] brother R you've got a picture here
[34:13] under
[34:14] consideration but how do you get to it
[34:18] that's the next thing how do we get into
[34:20] there brother brand here's the way they
[34:22] come and the
[34:24] pattern oh I'm a Christian brother brand
[34:27] I've been saved I've been baptized I
[34:29] enjoy the blessings of God you're in now
[34:32] outer of course but say day I I am my
[34:34] ups and downs my worries my toss my
[34:37] tumbles I wish I could live a Victorious
[34:39] Life well you've got to get out of the
[34:41] Court you got to come in now what was
[34:46] the first thing the courts represented
[34:49] justification outside there was where
[34:51] the people come in all Israel no other
[34:54] but a circumcised Israelite and come
[34:56] into those courts the defil you remember
[34:58] when they Paul brought Timothy to the
[35:00] temple and said they polluted this holy
[35:02] place by bringing the Gentile in in the
[35:05] courts they must be absolutely Justified
[35:08] people regenerated men and women who
[35:11] accepted God and God eternal life
[35:13] dwelling in them they must be that to be
[35:15] in the courts then they come to the
[35:18] first Altar and the first altars where
[35:21] they burnt the sacrifice and where the
[35:23] Lord met them there in forgiveness of
[35:25] sins and cleansed them from all their
[35:29] unrighteousness and the burning alar the
[35:31] brazing altar burnt the Beast and the
[35:33] blood from the Beast that was the second
[35:35] court and now as they left that second
[35:39] Court sanctification they entered into
[35:41] this consecrated
[35:44] life entered into the presence of God
[35:48] and while they were in there there were
[35:51] they had all these glorious
[35:53] things it was very beautiful type that
[35:56] in there and anything dead come in lived
[35:59] again did you ever think of that they
[36:02] took Aaron's rod and laid Aaron's rod in
[36:06] the presence of this holy place and when
[36:09] they did in one night's
[36:12] time amen it bued Blossom and yielded
[36:18] Alm in one night's time think of it in
[36:22] the presence of God this old dead Rod
[36:25] laying there in the presence of
[36:27] God bed Blossom and yielded arms in one
[36:32] night what was it then what kind of Rod
[36:35] was it it was an Alm tree
[36:38] rod that's where You' taken it from the
[36:40] stick was off of an Alm tree and you are
[36:44] a stick Sun kind and you're you was
[36:47] taken over the branch of humanity which
[36:50] was God's created son in the beginning
[36:53] you may be fallen dead alienated from
[36:56] God but by that in creation you were
[36:59] created to be a Son of God Amen you may
[37:02] bounce around and be respected and
[37:04] honored out here in the courts but if
[37:06] you ever get into that glorious place
[37:08] and hid away with God you yield what
[37:11] you're supposed to
[37:13] do take a dead sinner alienated from God
[37:17] without hope without Christ and put him
[37:19] in the presence of God in this great
[37:21] glorious Tabernacle in there he will
[37:24] yield forth fruit of the the Holy Spirit
[37:28] love joy peace long
[37:30] suffering the dead Rod buted him for but
[37:35] it had to have
[37:37] Refreshments had to be refreshed the
[37:40] nature was refreshed it the for it had
[37:43] to have a it brought forth an odor a
[37:46] perfume the blossom then the next thing
[37:49] it brought forth was fruit and every
[37:52] Christian comes the same way when he
[37:54] comes into the presence of God
[37:57] first he has to be
[38:00] refreshed the Holy Spirit has to take a
[38:03] hold of the man and renew him and make
[38:06] him another person thank you Lord the
[38:10] Holy Ghost comes in just the Freshman
[38:13] the Holy Ghost comes in the quiet of the
[38:16] hour you know you go out of the morning
[38:18] real early when the de is on the ground
[38:21] the D Falls just before daylight usually

[1:00:31] rest of it he called me up about two or
[1:00:33] three weeks later he said my home's
[1:00:36] revolutionized he said my wife is a
[1:00:39] different
[1:00:40] person I said which is the most powerful
[1:00:43] screaming and kicking and stalking or
[1:00:45] putting your arms around in love God is
[1:00:50] love the
[1:00:53] world
[1:00:55] ever since by faith I saw the stream thy

[1:01:36] that struggling so hard to try to get to
[1:01:38] the kingdom of God and they flocked by

[1:01:44] you know why they've never been inside
[1:01:46] the veil that's one Sure Thing If ever
[1:01:50] been in there there no different than
[1:01:52] that my sheep know my my voice a

[1:02:01] emotions and carry on everywh and call
[1:02:03] in the name of religion the heathens do
[1:02:05] the same thing but give me a consecrated
[1:02:08] life that's dead and rose again in
[1:02:10] Christ Jesus who lives in the Shak Glory
[1:02:13] with the love of God around him that's
[1:02:15] the person I believe is going to be

[1:02:23] gifts that you have in the scripture the
[1:02:25] devil can impersonate every one of them

[1:02:29] love is
[1:02:31] genuine the devil can't love that's one
[1:02:33] thing he can't do and when you get to a
[1:02:36] place that you love one another and all

[1:14:26] living a close consecrated life see
[1:14:28] listen closely now before close on
[1:14:31] that it isn't a blessing that you
[1:14:34] receive and shout and glorify God those
[1:14:37] things are good you're eating Mana that
[1:14:39] isn't it that's what I'm talking about
[1:14:41] this morning it isn't whether you raised
[1:14:43] up and spoke with tongues or whether you
[1:14:44] shouted run up and down the building
[1:14:46] that isn't it that's what I'm talking
[1:14:47] about I'm talking about that Hiway life
[1:14:51] in Christ where all the time day and
[1:14:55] night you just live in him that's what
[1:14:58] I'm talking about
[1:15:00] now he's
[1:15:02] here I wished I was a Healer this
[1:15:05] morning if I was I'd heal the sick
[1:15:08] people I can't heal sick people I'm just
[1:15:11] a man but the Healer himself is here the
[1:15:15] Lord Jesus now if I the Bible said the
[1:15:20] affectional fervent prayer of a
[1:15:21] righteous man aileth much
[1:15:23] the in affectional fervent prayer of a
[1:15:27] righteous man a bail much the Elijah was
[1:15:30] a man subject to like patience as we are
[1:15:32] he prayed earnestly that it wouldn't
[1:15:34] rain and it didn't rain for three years
[1:15:36] and six months then he went and prayed
[1:15:38] earnestly again in the heavens give rine
[1:15:40] Prayer Changes
[1:15:42] Things I can't change it you can't
[1:15:45] change it it's prayer that changes him
[1:15:48] God told a man one time he's going to
[1:15:50] die set his house in order sent the
[1:15:52] prophet up to tell
[1:15:53] and the man turned his face to the wall
[1:15:55] and began to cry and asked God for 15
[1:15:57] years longer to live and God changed the
[1:16:00] course give you 15 years now what is it
[1:16:05] prayer now we're changing the subject
[1:16:07] just for a few minutes I don't get to be
[1:16:09] with you I'm hoping to be here next
[1:16:10] Sunday again the Lord but I uh I want to
[1:16:15] this morning when I come down wife said
[1:16:17] are you going your horse and everything
[1:16:18] I said I promise I'm going anyhow see
[1:16:22] look I want to tell you
[1:16:24] something I I know that prayer this is
[1:16:28] to be my first time praying since
[1:16:30] something was ministered to me that you
[1:16:32] understand God knows it's true see to
[1:16:36] ever pray for sick
[1:16:38] people it won't be in the public as it
[1:16:41] used to be well of course in these
[1:16:43] Church meetings it will be like this but
[1:16:45] I mean in another category that we go in
[1:16:48] now but this I do know I have confidence
[1:16:51] I've watched all along now if I would
[1:16:54] like to trade places today with some man
[1:16:56] who preached the gospel if it would be
[1:16:58] the will of God for me to be a preacher
[1:17:01] I'm not much of a Preacher because I'm
[1:17:04] not educated and I I don't know too much
[1:17:06] of the word and things so I can't preach
[1:17:09] but my work is to pray for sick people
[1:17:14] and I noticed in the in the services and
[1:17:17] different places just what prayer does
[1:17:19] what an effect it has how many takes
[1:17:22] Christian life the magazine Christian
[1:17:24] Life did you notice that astounding
[1:17:26] article in there by that medical doctor
[1:17:29] in Chicago or I believe it's wheat n
[1:17:31] noise they asked him they said Do You
[1:17:34] Believe In Divine Healing is there such
[1:17:36] a thing he said now you've asked me a
[1:17:37] question Divine Healing what do you mean
[1:17:40] Miracles or or healing he said healing
[1:17:43] certainly you pray for the sick and said
[1:17:45] the sick gets well then there's a
[1:17:47] miracle and it vanishes right before you
[1:17:49] said either of those said I certainly
[1:17:51] believe in that but said now these
[1:17:53] bloodless Cults such as unitarians and
[1:17:55] Science and things like that said I
[1:17:56] don't go for that but the blood of Jesus
[1:17:58] Christ will heal
[1:18:00] anytime that was a medical doctor see
[1:18:02] and they know that and then God set some
[1:18:06] in the church to pray for the sick God
[1:18:08] set some in the church to teach some to
[1:18:10] be different things is that right he
[1:18:13] does that and through this he gives
[1:18:15] different gifts sometimes to people that
[1:18:17] don't have nothing to do with it not a
[1:18:19] thing with your soul salvation but in
[1:18:21] this knowing that he call me to pray for
[1:18:24] the sick people I just want to to for
[1:18:26] your confidence and God knows in my

[1:31:19] across the building and immediately
[1:31:21] after she was great part she rolls the

[1:31:24] walking around the Lord Jesus is Shar my
[1:31:27] dear brother and sisters I can't heal
[1:31:30] you but you're fixing the sea I believe
[1:31:33] one of the greatest revivals that we've
[1:31:35] ever had that's right in the nation I
[1:31:38] just know that something is in there
[1:31:41] making just now now as you pass by right
[1:31:44] now to be prayed for let everyone in the
[1:31:46] building be in prayer as their sister
[1:31:48] pray place and brother NE and I will be
[1:31:50] ministering and laying hands on the sick
[1:31:51] as they pass by this side going to their
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:59] seat some people gets the wrong
[1:32:02] impression of what the anointing is did
[1:32:05] you ever think of
[1:32:06] that when was the greatest anointing
[1:32:10] ever given to anyone and what did they
[1:32:13] do when they had the
[1:32:15] anointing the greatest anointing that
[1:32:17] was ever given to anyone was Jesus
[1:32:20] Christ we have the Spirit by measure he
[1:32:23] had it without measure and one day he
[1:32:26] entered into the temple and picked up
[1:32:28] the scroll and read said the spirit of
[1:32:30] God is upon me for he has anointed me to
[1:32:34] preach the acceptable years to bind up
[1:32:36] the broken hearts to heal the sick give
[1:32:39] sight to the Blind and now we would
[1:32:42] think if such anointing was only been
[1:32:44] prophesied 800 years before that it
[1:32:46] would come and here he was with that
[1:32:48] type of anointing the full blessing and
[1:32:51] anointing ing of the Lord upon him we
[1:32:54] would want to run all over the building
[1:32:56] screaming holler but the Bible said he
[1:32:59] laid down the scroll and sat down and
[1:33:03] precious words proceeded from his
[1:33:06] mouth that's what he done under the
[1:33:09] anointing anointing is not emotion
[1:33:12] anointing is supreme
[1:33:15] power in
[1:33:17] control knowing exactly what H
[1:33:22] Hallelujah that's what's here now you
[1:33:26] might not be able to understand it as
[1:33:28] you walk here you might not be able to
[1:33:31] get but I challenge your faith to this
[1:33:34] you come and believe what I told you and
[1:33:36] watch what happened amen just dis
[1:33:39] believe what's been told and see what
