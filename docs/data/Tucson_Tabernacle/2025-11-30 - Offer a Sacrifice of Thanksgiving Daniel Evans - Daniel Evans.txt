========================================

when peace like a river. Let's sing this this morning. It's a good atmosphere this morning. It's good to be in the house of God worshiping. We just want a nice godly atmosphere. Want the Holy Spirit to be here as brother Daniel gets ready to come out and bring the word to us this morning. When peace like a river [singing] attendeth my way. When sorrows [singing] like sea billows, whatever [music and singing] my heart, thou hast taught me [music] to say. It [singing] is well. [music] It is well with my [music and singing] soul. Verse two. Though Satan, Though Satan [singing] should [music] buff it, though trial [music and singing] should come, let [music] this [singing] blessed assurance control [music] [singing] that Christ [singing] [music] hath regarded my helpless [music] estate [singing] and hath shed [music] his own [singing] blood for my soul. [singing] Oh, it is well with my [singing] soul. It [music and singing] is well. It is well with my [singing] soul. My sin, my sin. [singing] Oh, the bliss [music] of this [singing] glorious thought. [music] My sin not [singing] in part but the whole. [music] Think of it now. All of it is nailed [music] [singing] to the cross. and I [singing] bear him [music] no more. Praise [singing] the Lord. [music] Praise the Lord. Oh, my soul. [singing] Would you stand with me this morning? Oh, it is well [music] with my [singing] soul. It is [singing and music] well. It is well with [singing] my [music] soul. Sing that again. It is well. Oh, it is well [singing] with my soul. It is well. [music] It is well [singing] with my soul. Let's sing the last verse, brother Tim. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; But Lord, haste [singing] the [music] day when my face [singing] shall be sight. The clouds [singing] be rolled back [music] as the [singing] scroll. The trump [music and singing] shall resound and the Lord shall [music] desend. Even [music and singing] so it is well with [music] my [singing] soul. Oh, it [singing] is well. with my [singing] soul. [music] It [singing] is well. [music] It is well with my soul. [singing] [music] Can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning? [applause] Amen. Whatever the situation is, it is well in Jesus Christ. Amen. I didn't know that Josiah was going to sing that song, but it goes really it goes perfectly with the subject today. Let me [music] read as we're standing. Let me read the background on that song. The hymn, it is well with my soul was written by Horatio Spafford in 1873 after a series of devastating personal [music] tragedies. Spafford, a Chicago lawyer, first lost his fortune in the great Chicago fire of 1871 and his son to scarlet fever around the same time. The most significant tragedy was when his wife and four daughters drowned after their ship sank in the Atlantic Ocean. Spafford wrote the lyrics while crossing the ocean to join his grieving wife. Inspired by his deep faith amidst his profound [music] loss, he lost everything. And then he writes a song like that. Let's turn in our Bibles where we're standing to Psalm 116 verse 16. I think a fitting scripture and a fitting psalm. Psalm 116 verse 16 says this, "Oh Lord, truly I am thy servant. I am thy servant [music] and the son of thine handmmaid. Thou hast loosed my bonds. I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and I will call upon the name of the Lord." Can we sing that that last verse again? You put up but but Lord is for thee. For thy coming we wait. But Lord is for thee. For thy coming we wait. [singing and music] The sky of the grave [music] is our gold. [music] The trump [singing] of [music] the angel, [singing] the voice of the Lord. [music] Blessed [singing] hope, blessed Rest of [singing and music] my soul. [singing] Oh [music] well [singing] with [singing] my soul. [music] [singing] It is well. [music] It is well [singing] with my soul. [music] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, the reason that things can be well with our souls is because we know that you are on the throne. There is always hope in our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ. Lord, we pray that your presence would be here with us this morning. And father that as we would leave this building today that we would be more grateful people and more mindful of all that you do for us. We thank you father in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. God bless you. I didn't get a list of visitors, but welcome to all all the visitors that I haven't seen. God bless you. It's good to have you. Hope and Craig back there. God bless you. Um and all I I'm we're blessed people, friends, that we can open up this Bible. We can read from it. I've been really digesting that scripture over the past few days. Psalm 116:16. Oh Lord, truly I am thy servant. And I like the way he says this. Oh Lord, truly I am thy servant. I am thy servant and the son of thine handmade. Thou hast loosed my bonds. I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord. The sacrifice of thanksgiving. Sometimes thanksgiving being grateful isn't necessarily the thing that comes to our mind first, especially when hard times. Usually we're asking God and we're not necessarily thanking God for what he's done. the Thanksgiving story, the original Thanksgiving that happened in New England in 1621. It's something that I think should be mentioned at this time of the year. There's a group of people about a hundred people that made a made the uh journey from Europe over to the America to United to what was America back then. And they were truly seeking freedom of religion. They made this trip and it was very very difficult. They the one ship um immediately failed and then they all had to pile on this ship called the Mayflower. They had two ships going at first. They went across the Atlantic Ocean and they averaged only two miles an hour going over a couple thousand miles. there was no wind and then when there was wind it was great storms. People died and uh they suffered from malnutrition. They they got to they landed in a place that they didn't expect to land at in New England and things didn't get easier once they hit land. They got it got much more difficult. By the grace of God, he sent some friendly Indians to help them, help them learn how to grow corn, help them learn how to fish and survive. But whatever the case was, even with these blessings, they lost half of their people during that first winter. And it was a very very hard time for these what we call pilgrims. Then in 1621, the fall, they came together after they had their first harvest, and they had a feast. And it wasn't a feast of mourning. It wasn't a feast of remembering necessarily the lives of their husbands and their wives and their children that they had lost over the past year. It was a feast of thanksgiving. It truly was that psalm. It was an offering. It was a they offered a sacrifice of thanksgiving in the name of the Lord. And they were blessed. Yet just around 50 of them made it. And they were able to because of their journey and because of their sacrifices, God has blessed this country above any other country I believe in history and given us a place that we can prosper. We can as hard as hard as we want to work, the more successful we can be in the monetary ways. And then we also can worship in a way that we want to worship that we feel led to worship which is why they came here in the first place is they wanted that freedom and it wasn't something that it was must have been a hard thing. They probably were a lot thinner than when they started. They were probably many of them were sick, but they had this first harvest and they gave God the glory and they were thankful. They weren't complaining. They were thankful for what they have. And if we're not careful, gratitude can slip out of our lives. And as soon as we are ungrateful, as soon as that gratitude leaves, then the grace of God will also lift off of our lives. Not because it was God's choice for him to pull back his grace, but because we've created an environment of being unthankful and of complaining. And it's the world today is a very entitled society. We think that if we have to suffer just a little bit that the world's going to come to an end and and everybody owes us and and we should never have a problem. But sometimes, I think all the time, we need to make sure that we thank God for the trials and the suffering &gt;&gt; just as we thank God for the good times just as these pilgrims did. And I think I hope that I can encourage the congregation to pray to be more thankful. Pray to be more grateful. And then thank the Lord for your gratefulness. Thank the Lord that you are thankful because you do. you understand really what what has been given to you and the grace that we have and how much how easy we have it and especially compared to those that we celebrate this week, those pilgrims that really suffered. They did and I think that they were a very very good example to us and how we should be grateful for what we have. They they went through it and they lost everything. Sister Shirley, I think it was you that we were talking about prayer one night on a Wednesday night talk and and I think it was you that said when you pray many times that you'll just start thanking the Lord for his goodness. And I do the same thing is if I don't know like Lord, how do I approach you? A lot of times I'll just get on my knees or I'll even sit back in my chair at home and I'll just start thanking him for all the things that he's given me. and thanking him for my family and and a church and and the word of God and and my health and my family's health and my friends and and then you'll start doing that. And then God appreciates that. He welcomes as as you're going to see in a story that I'll close with later on. He loves [snorts] thanksgiving. He loves a grateful heart. And these things that we suffer, we should always remember that nothing good comes without a sacrifice. Let that sink in for a minute. That nothing good comes without something sacrificing first. A mother when a baby is born, she suffers. she the there's there's great pain and even the the mother's life is in danger and it's it's a hard time that that labor and that that leadup to the birth. But when that child is born, the suffering, the mother doesn't really think of what she just went through. She's tired and she's beaten down, but you lay that little baby on her on her chest and all she can think of is this just precious little gift that God has given her and she's just grateful for that and all that suffering goes away and it's but it did come through suffering. It came through sacrifice. And most of the time we also we want to thank God for the suffering. And I was asking myself last night, what do we do more? Do we ask God or do we thank God? Which one do we do more? Do we ask him or do we thank him? Do we have do we offer him a sacrifice of thanksgiving during hard times that that we might be struggling? We might be in need for a family member or for ourselves financially, for our health, whatever it might be. Are we constantly asking or are we thanking him? Thanking him for the trial that we're going through. I was last week I was with uh brother Steve who preached on Saturday night and u we were up in Sabino Canyon and we met a uh there there was one of the workers that were were there. She was dressed in like a a Forest Service uniform and she came walking by. She was from the uh she's from Holland and she came walking by. We were sitting at the the picnic table waiting for Daniel and your friends were up hiking and she uh she waved at us and I like I always do I greeted her and uh and struck up a conversation and uh I I asked her I said we were talking about the beauty of Sabino Canyon especially it had just rained and if you ever been up in Spino Canyon after a rain and the clouds are kind of low wow it is I don't know if there's an equal to it in the whole the world. We were we were um just kind of we were talking with her and about how pretty things were and I asked her I said, "Are you a Christian?" Because I saw that she had a lot of respect for the environment. And usually people will say something on the order of, "Well, I I know God uh but but you know, I know that there's a creator there or I just don't go to church." And what they're really saying is that I I know God, but I know him on my terms. That he's he's God and he's there when I need him, but uh just as far as serving him, no. But but she answered in a different way. This lady was very firm and to the point. And she said, "No, I'm an atheist." And I thought I thought, "Okay." Um, and I said, you know, I said, I can't help but look at these mountains and look at these cactus and look at just the beauty. I can't help but think of God when I look at these things. It just it just inspires me. And she gave me a a a very strange response. And she said that nature is what convinces her that there is no God. And I thought wow we are on opposite ends of the spectrum here [laughter] very nice very nice person and uh so I said really I said I don't understand that and she said let me give you an example and she gave me an example of a tarantula hawk wasp. Does anybody know what a tarantula hawk wasp is? Let me give you a little background on what that wasp is. Don't ever get stung by it because it's probably the most deadly wasp in the world. And it it's very very painful, but it's one of those big black wasps. I think they have red wings. And they just flying around, man. They look intimidating. You're like, whoa, I think I'll stay clear. What they do is they're actually they they eat pollen, but they the way that they reproduce. And then this is the reason they call them a tarantula hawk. They would come down and they will they will attack a tarantula, big spider, and they'll get on top and they'll sting this spider. And it doesn't kill it, but it it paralyzes it. They'll grab the spider and they'll pull it down into a hole and then they will lay their eggs on that tarantula and those eggs will hatch. Now, the tarantula is alive. He's preserved because he's still breathing and doing what spiders do before they're dead. And the the the hatchlings of this wasp will feed on this big giant spider. And she she gives this example of a tarantula hawk and she says, "How could God do something like that?" And she has this image of God in her mind that actually most people have that God is this this big happy as brother Bram called him a dotie grandpa that just is all good and all like like maybe Santa Claus at Christmas time. And that was that's her understanding of God. and and she says, "Well, there can't be a God in all of this suffering and dying and all of this hardship in the world." And unfortunately, that is how many people, if not most people think. They don't understand how God can allow suffering and dying and and problems even with this wasp and this spider. And I told her, I said, "You chose the exact example of Christ in with mankind." I said, "You I said, look, this whole the whole story of the tarantula hawk is a story of sacrifice so something else can live." I said, 'Here comes this wasp and it lays its eggs on this spider. This spider is now a sacrifice. This spider's life is given so these other um these other insects can live. And I said, that's what Jesus did. Jesus died, was sacrificed on the cross so that we can live. I said just your story explain the very meaning of Christianity and it's it's suffering God the way be after the fall of of of it wasn't God's fault but after the fall of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden something had to die so something else could live &gt;&gt; Adam Abel Adam and Eve's son. He offered a lamb because he knew that God the Father had killed a a lamb or a sheep to make skins for Adam and Eve when they when they die, when they fell, when they sinned. So Abel knew this. So he knew to stay the wrath of God to cover their nakedness. He knew that you have to kill something as a sacrifice to take the place of the sinner. Exactly what happened with this tarantula and this wasp. It had to die so something else could live. It's the way nature and it's so beautiful how nature is. Everything that we look at just preaches Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; from the mountains to the valleys to the cactus to the trees to the insects. It's all about him. It's all about Jesus. But it's about sacrifice. It's about living and dying. What is the the lion king? The circle of life. It is &gt;&gt; it's a great circle of life. And there's coming a time when there will be no death. The Bible promises it. But until that time, we are living in this world. And this world is a cruel world. God is a loving God. He is not a cruel God. God makes a way for us. That's what people don't understand is no. If you just lived in this cruel world, you would be lost to sin and death and hell. But Jesus made a way. And that's why we're here. That's why we want to bring others in to show that that sacrifice, it's suffering, that we should be thankful for it. There's many people, there's people here in this building right now that were hurt by their former churches. People insulted them, offended them, ex exccommunicated them maybe, and they were hurt. So they left a church and many many found themselves alone and some are finding now finding soloulless and finding comfort here at the Tucson Tabernacle. But instead of having resentment in our hearts for some for another church or someone else, what about offering a sacrifice of thanksgiving &gt;&gt; to the Lord and say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you that you allowed me to be hurt &gt;&gt; because now I'm a better person. Thank you that you allowed me to go through these things because if if life was just a a flowery bed of ease, I don't think any of us would be saved. I don't think we would have the character that God wants us to have. I don't think we would appreciate the blood of Jesus Christ if we had not fallen into sin. How could we appreciate a savior? &gt;&gt; I don't think that we can. So when we fail, thank God. Offer him that sacrifice of thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Offer him and say, "Lord, thank you. I failed, but thank you that there is the blood there." And my experience of being heard, it made me dig into the word myself and I can look back and I can say, "Thank you. It made me really find my own personal walk with the Lord Jesus. And not be reliant on on a church or someone else. &gt;&gt; Stephanie asked me this morning. She said that if people see the error in their churches and leave, does it open the door for sin to come into their lives? That's a very good question. No. I don't think so. And this is this is my answer to Stephanie that no, I think that sin was already in their heart and it was just waiting to manifest itself outwardly. And if they left, that sin was just sitting there. And friends, we can die and have sin in our heart. That's why we're going to get back into the sermon on the mount. Jesus is going after the heart of a person and not the outside because the heart is what condemns us. And with people, if if they have a bad experience, give thanks that the Lord will help us and the Lord will will he'll he'll undertake for us. If we could just search him and and allow our trials and our tribulations as they did in New England 400 years ago, allow those things to make you a better person and make a more rugged Christian and a more rugged servant of God. When a a a soldier goes into battle, that soldier has training. That soldier is ready to go fight. But if you send somebody out that has no training, that doesn't know what they're doing, they're just gonna get smoked right away. But we these things that we go through, they're actually training for us and they help us. There's a amazing story in the Bible about giving God thanks that I would like to read and I'd like to spend the remainder of the service on this. And it has a pretty amazing ending. that I never really understood until this week, until I've been praying about this and studying about this scripture. It's about the 10 lepers. And you know, I hope probably most of you know the story that 10 were healed, then one came back to give thanks. Let's read it and then we'll dig into it. Luke 17 11. Luke 17:11 says this, "And it came to pass," speaking of the Lord Jesus, "As he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee, and as he entered into a certain village, there met him 10 men that were lepers, which stood a far off, and they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us." And when he saw them, he said unto them, "Go show yourselves unto the priests." And it came to pass that as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks. And he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, "Were not there 10 cleansed? But where are the nine? There are not found that returned. There are not found that return to give glory to God, save this stranger. And he said unto him, "Arise, go thy way. Thy faith has made thee whole." And like many stories in the in the middle of the book of Luke, this is this isn't in any other gospel. It isn't in Matthew, it isn't in Mark, and it is in in John. It's just in Luke. So this story um this is the only place that this story is mentioned. We know from our Wednesday night Bible studies that Luke probably never met Jesus in person. He uh he probably well we know that he was tasked by this man Theopoulos to write a narrative of Jesus Christ and his life and then write another narrative of what happened when the life of Jesus went into the apostles. The first one was the book of Luke and he probably interviewed many many people that were there that were present at the time when Jesus was here. And the second paper that he wrote, the second document he wrote was the book of Acts. Both were meant to report on the works of the Lord Jesus. One before his resurrection, one after his resurrection. this story. Um, while he was this thought just came to my mind and I don't know and none of us will ever know until we get over to the other side, but when Luke was compiling this book of Luke and when he was writing this story, I wonder if he interviewed or talked to this one leper that came back. We don't know. But it's a not it's a it's a blessing to even think that that maybe this man gave personal testimony. They're talking about leprosy. And for most of the history of mankind, leprosy has probably been the most feared disease known to man. There's never been a cure for it really until recently. And it can be cured now with modern antibiotics. But it couldn't be cured in history unless the Lord did a miracle. Starts with red patches on the skin. Then it progresses to nerve damage, loss of sensation in the affected areas which that causes injury. So you don't feel. So you could pick up a burning pan and not have any feeling in your hand and it would it would cause an injury there. And this would happen often. You might pick up um you might step on a nail if if you have leprosy and and you wouldn't notice and your foot would you wouldn't be able to attend to it. Your foot would get infected and causing more problems. Goes from the nerve damage to ulcers and and deformities that start on the body especially in the hands and the feet and the face and eventually the tissue death results in infection and death to the patient. Once you had leprosy, this is what was going to happen. You had a death sentence. I actually saw someone when I was a little kid that had leprosy. I was in Ngalas with my parents. I was probably, I don't know, six or five, six, seven years old. And it was back when a lot of people used to go down there and go shopping and they would get certain things that they could get in Ogalas and and not get here. It was much safer back then. So, we were down there and I was just following my mom and dad and uh there was this man that was begging on the sidewalk and he he didn't have a nose and it was it was white on his face. His hands were deformed and he just he just looked really bad. and he uh he put his hand out when my parents walked by and I I had some money in my pocket that I was going to spend. I wanted to buy something in Mexico. I wanted to get, you know, something whatever, you know, one of those those rattles that they have, you know, with that look um just something. And uh I dug into my pocket and I pulled out my change and I I put it in his hand and it just struck me. I mean, I still see the image today. And I just kept walking and I remember just the how bad the man looked. And afterwards, my mom, she said, Daniel, she said, I saw you gave that money to that man. And I just got up. I was like, mom, I said, it wasn't very much. All I had was just my change. And she said, no, honey. She said, that probably bought him a loaf of bread. And it made me feel so much better because I just felt so inadequate. Even as a little kid, I I just had such a burden because the man was suffering so bad. This uh this disease, the priests in the Bible were trained to diagnose leprosy. So they could see the symptoms and they were able to say, "Okay, this person is a leper. He or she has the disease." And when you have that disease, when you are diagnosed, then you are no longer to be in the general population. You weren't allowed to even be in a walled city. You had to live outside of that city with other lepers. And you even had to if you were in a a common area, you even had to either have a sign or you had to announce yourself unclean unclean so that people would stay away from you and for the protection of the population so you wouldn't spread the disease. They didn't understand it like we understand it. And they would uh they would wrap themselves in linen or or whatever it is to hide their condition and to maybe to cover their soores. And they had to live their lives in these leper colonies, as I said, outside of the city. And when you're in that colony, you were probably with people with with various stages of leprosy. And you saw it must have just been a horrible horrible thing that you were living with these people that the ultimate was going to be the same for everyone. And let me stop there for a moment. And I want to encourage everyone. These lepers, they were around people with leprosy, not by their choice. But you see walking around, especially in this part of town, you see a lot of homeless people and you see them gathering around the street corners and you see how they're acting and they're they're doing the fentanyl. They they get stuck and they just they sit there for a long time and or they they get start to get sores all over their face from the the methamphetamines that they're taking. And everyone in that group, they look the same and they're struggling with the same thing. Be careful for all of us. Be careful who you're around because the people that you are around, they define you. You show me your friends and I'll show you who you are. If you're around people that are constantly negative and constantly putting everybody down and constantly complaining, that's who you are. Those are the people that you surround yourself with. Those are the people that you gravitate to, just as the people on the street. They gravitate towards fellow drug users. And that's us. We gravitate to people that are like us. [snorts] And you can gravitate towards genuine Christian brothers and sisters that have positive attitudes that are always thankful and and giving thanks or you can gravitate to the others. Look at your friends. Judge yourself. You can see that is who you are. So Jesus and these 10 lepers um Jesus wasn't the first one to walk by these people. He was they were on a welltraveled path to Jerusalem as the Bible says. So there were probably crowds on the same on the on the same road. People would walk by these men and they would pro they were probably begging and generally you know how it is. You see somebody maybe if you're on the street out here and you see somebody with the sores and and you see that they're they're an obvious addict you sometimes you might go over this way to avoid this person. And that's probably what was happening with these 10 lepers. But Jesus is different. &gt;&gt; He's different than than the whole world. When these people that had need, these people that are suffering, it's strange how Jesus gravitates to those people. He gravitates to really the people that need him. Think about Mary Magdalene. Think about Legion. Think about the Sarapheneician woman with with her possessed daughter. blind Barnameus, the man at the pool of Bethesda. All of these had a need and Jesus found himself with those people. So he went to those people. Those were really those were his people. And that's really the people with the spirit of Jesus. That's who we should be going to. Also those people that need us might be family members. It might be somebody on the streets, especially people, you know, those people that need us. If you have the spirit of Christ, don't you think you should do what Jesus did and go to those people? Jesus was an excellent example. And if we have a spirit, it's called the Holy Spirit. It's just Jesus living in here. It's that simple. So, let's let's go back to this. Luke chapter 17 verse 11. And it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered into a certain village, there met him 10 men that were lepers which stood a far off. Notice they had to keep their distance. Remember, unclean, unclean. But somehow, I don't know how they knew that this was Jesus. They called him out by name. Maybe it was his reputation. But whatever the case was, when they saw Jesus, and the same with us, all of a sudden, there was hope in their lives. It gave them hope. There where there was nothing but pain and nothing but being an outcast and being embarrassed wherever they went. when they saw Jesus, when Jesus came into their lives, all of a sudden they had hope. It wasn't, it doesn't even say hope of hope of deliverance. It doesn't say hope of being healed, but just him being there made everything better. We don't understand the power in that name of Jesus. No matter what is going on, no matter how bad things may be, these 10 lepers, they just cried out to him saying, "Have mercy on us." And we can do the same. We don't have it as bad as they had it. And they lifted up their voices and they said, "Jesus, master, have mercy on us." They acknowledge him. Jesus being a man of authority, a ruler when they called him master, a man who can heal the sick, a man who can change the situation. And they cried out for mercy. And I read this a couple times. And they didn't ask for healing. &gt;&gt; They didn't ask for for deliverance from leprosy. They asked for mercy. They wanted God's will. They just wanted they wanted Jesus in their lives. They needed something. Whatever Jesus was willing to give them is what they wanted. What does Jesus do next? It's a bit out of character for what Jesus does next. It's very strange. And when he saw them, he didn't say, "You're healed." When he saw them, he didn't say, "Receive your healing." And when he saw them, he said unto them, "Go show yourselves unto the priest." They weren't healed. Go show yourselves unto the priests. All right? So remember the priests, they had the authority and they had the training to diagnose leprosy. So if if you were sick, somebody turned you in or whatever, you came, you have leprosy, you have to live outside of the camp. Or they also had the the ability, they had the training to say, "You're healed of leprosy." It happened with Miriam, Moses's sister. She got leprosy and the Lord healed her. And the priests, they did what was I believe it was Leviticus 13 and 14, somewhere around there. they um diagnosed her, said, "Okay, now she's healed and there was a a purification that had to take place and she was able to come back into the congregation of the Lord." So he says, "Go show yourselves to the priests." All right? So this was going to have two a two-way effect. Number one, the priests were going to say, "Okay, now you can come back into the congregation. You can go back to your families because they had the authority to do so." And number two, it was going to show the priests that this was a genuine miracle. And I guarantee you, they hadn't seen anything like this. They just knew from Moses's writings, here what we do, here's what happens. But wow, it this is this just happened in our day is is what they would have said. So Jesus tells them, "Go show yourselves to the priest." And it came to pass that as they went, they were cleansed. So they followed the directions of Jesus. They had to have faith number one to do what he said. They didn't say, "Wait, wait, just just lay your hands on me." Or they didn't say, "Well, let me just come down and would you pray for me?" They did what he said. And he didn't pray for them. He didn't lay hands on them. He didn't pronounce them healed. He told them to go. And they went read that scripture again. And he saw them. And when he saw them, he said unto them, "Go show yourselves unto the priests." And it came to pass that as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified God. And he fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks. And he was a Samaritan. Again, we know from our Wednesday night Bible studies that Samaritans are a mix between Jews and the Assyrians. way back, I don't know, it was like seven or 8 hundred years before Jesus, the Assyrians came in, they invaded um northern Israel, they took people captive and they settled that and then they um they mixed the races and that's where the Samaritan race comes from. The Samaritans thought that they were the rightful heirs of Abraham's promise, the promised land. The Jews thought that they were half reads, they were less. So there was always fighting between the Samaritans and the Jews. It's an important here because it's because this is a Samaritan. This isn't even one of the people that that Jesus came to first. This guy is he's an outcast of the outcast. So, he was not only was he a leper, he was also a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, so he comes back to Jesus and he falls down on his feet giving him thanks. And Jesus answering said, "Were not were there not 10 cleansed? But where are the are the nine? There are not found that return to give him glory to God, save the stranger, except this one man, and he's a stranger. He's a foreigner." And he said unto him, "Arise, go thy way. Thy faith hath made thee whole. I didn't, as I was thinking on this and meditating on this and praying on this over the past few days, I didn't understand, Lord, he was already made whole. He was already healed. All 10 of them were healed. So why does Jesus re repeat himself to this man? But he says something different. And this is one of those nuggets that is just beautiful that is they're all throughout the Bible, but this one is something that is just precious. There's a difference in these in these words. In verse 17, he says that were not the 10 cleansed. So some translations say were not the 10 healed. That's a different Greek word. Remember the New Testament is written in Greek. That's a different Greek word than verse number 19 that says made whole. The verse number 19 is the Greek word soo. Say well brother Daniel that doesn't mean much to me but it will. It's a Jesus said that these were healed and then this one he says that you are made whole. What does this Greek word mean? Soo, here's the definition. It says soo means it means it means made whole. It means delivered. It means saved. That Greek word, it it it means healed, too. But it has a much more important meaning. So this man that came back to Jesus, the other nine, they got their healing. He got his healing too. But this man that came back to Jesus just to say just to say thank you, he was saved. Why? Because he said thank you. &gt;&gt; Very, very powerful scripture. God appreciates our gratitude. this word soo. Let me let me read it in uh in a couple different different verses here. Matthew chapter 1 verse 19. Then Joseph her husband speaking of when Jesus was born being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded minded to put her away privy. But when he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. and she shall bring forth a son, speaking of the birth of Jesus. And she shall bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save so his people from their sins. Matthew chapter 10 verse 20 22 says, "And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake, but he that endureth to the end shall be saved." Soo saved is much greater than healed. Matthew chapter 8 181 says, "For the son of man is come to save that which was lost." Soo acts 2 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Same word that Jesus said to this man. Now listen to this. Romans chapter 10 and the um the worship team can come. Romans chapter 10 verse 8. I'll read the New King James version. It says this. But what does it say? The word is near you in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Same word that he said. Soo to this leper. For with the heart of one believes under righteousness, and with the mouth confesseth confession is made under salvation. For the scripture says, "Whoever believes on him will not be put to shame. For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek. For the same Lord over all is rich to is rich to all who call upon him. For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved." Soo. And that leper received the same salvation in these scriptures as I just read. Why? Because he just came back to say thank you. Can you imagine? Nine. We don't know if they were saved or not, but one we know that he is saved and he received eternal life. Same as the as the thief on the cross that acknowledged Jesus. It was just one little word. Lord, remember me. And Jesus says, you're gonna you're going to be with me. A little word like that. This guy comes back. He was healed. Can you imagine? I I would want to go get my certificate as you would. Certificate from the priest. Go to my family AND SAY, "I'M BACK. THE Jesus healed me and and and live my life with my family. Go get a job and start supporting and and living my life and not suffering." But this man before he did that, he just came back and he said, "Thank you." &gt;&gt; And was given eternal life just for that little bit of gratitude. Do you see how important gratitude is? Do you see how important it is to just say those little words, "Thank you, and get on your knees and say, Lord, you've done so much for me. I appreciate you." Again, he says, "And Jesus answered, Were not 10 cleansed, but where are the nine? Where are the ones that I healed? There are not found that return to give glory to God except this one man, and he's a Samaritan." And then he said un unto him, the guy was laying there at his feet thanking Jesus for what he had done, thanking him for saving him, thanking him for healing him of this dreaded disease. [music] And how many of us have changed our lives, given up drugs, reconciled with our wives, our children have come back. How many of us have had the experiences that are similar to this man [music] and they can rejoice and give God glory for what he did and we can tell each everybody the testimonies and all that. But how many of us have just approached Jesus just me and him just you and him and fell down and said, "Lord, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate what you did for me. I appreciate all the suffering that you went through for me. And then Jesus says, arise and go thy way. Thy faith has made thee whole. So now, my son, not only have you been healed of your leprosy, but now enter [music] into the kingdom of heaven. Amen. Why? Thanksgiving. He said thank you. See how powerful it is. So say thank you. Say thank you to each other. Someone does something for you, give thanks. Give your appreciation. But especially what the Lord's done for you. Don't forget to thank him. And when you suffer, thank him. Lord, I don't know what's going on. I'm sick or Lord, I've lost my job or or I'm having all these problems. Here I am on my knees. Lord, thank you because I know that I'm in I'm in your mind. I know that you think that you're thinking of me. Remember when Jesus, he just saw that leper out there. He saw them. And if he just sees you, if you can just understand, if I can just understand that he sees me and he cares and he loves me, then I can just thank him because now it's it's up to him. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for the trials. Thank you for everything that you've done for me. Nine out of 10 don't say thank you. I want to be that one. Amen. Just say I have been blessed. Brother Tim, would you all stand with us? And he moves among us. All that he does. All of his mercy, all [singing] of his love. If the pen [music] of a rider would write every [singing] day, even [music] this world could never contain how I bless. Verse two. Warmth in the [music and singing] winter, flowers in spring, laughter of summer, [music] the changing of leaves. Food on my [music and singing] table, good place to sleep, clothes on [singing] my back, and [music] shoes on my feet. I have been [singing] blessed. [music] I have been blessed. [singing] God so good to me. [music] Precious are [singing] his thoughts of you and me. No way I could count them. [music and singing] There's not enough time. So I'll just thank [singing] him for being [music] so kind. God has [singing] been good. So good. [music] I have been [singing] blessed. Arms [music] that will raise. Arms that will raise.

[music and singing] I have been blessed. Last verse. He's my shoulder to lean on. My shoulder to lean [singing] on when I am down. The rock where he leads me when I'm overwhelmed.

So good. I have been blessed. Can you imagine if that leper if that man had never contracted leprosy? He would have just no one would have ever known who he was. No one would have ever remembered him. He may have just lived his life, had a family, and died. And the grandchildren would be the last one to even know his name, and he would be completely gone. But because he contracted the worst disease really known to man and because he suffered maybe all of those years that he was able to fall down at the feet of Jesus to look up in his eyes and to hear those words that you are made whole. It was the suffering that brought him to that. And when we suffer our little sufferings and when we go through something, thank God because he's got an end, there is hope in Jesus Christ. They said, they said, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us." And we should be calling out the same to him. Lord Jesus, have mercy on me. Lord, I'm going through this, but I am thankful. Lord, I'm thankful that that I get to go through it. I want to give you an offering, a sacrifice of thanksgiving. I want to offer you a sacrifice of thanksgiving. That's the psalm said. Let's do that. All right. Let's thank him. Thank him every day. Now think about what you're thankful for. Think about suffering that you've gone through. Now give him a hand thinking of those things. [applause] [applause] Mary, are you thankful? God bless you, sweetheart. Praise God. Let's bow our heads. Lord, today and Father, I pray that it's every day I want to give you an offering of thanksgiving, a sacrifice. I want to offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Lord, tell you I love you for all that you've Lord permitted me to go through. Lord, you you permitted that leper to suffer. permitted all 10 of them to suffer, but especially that one, Lord. You permitted him to go through that. He would have maybe never ever laid eyes on Jesus Christ in his life if it was not for that disease. But he did. And you spoke those words. And Lord, you promised us as I read that that same Greek word soo that if we would just believe on you that we would receive the same. Now Lord with all of our hearts we believe on you master savior Jesus Christ. And we thank you Lord. We thank you for your kindness. I just love that song that Josiah sang. But Lord, two wonderful songs to start and to end. Songs of gratitude, thankfulness. Lord, we thank you with all of our hearts. We thank you, Lord. Now as we go Lord accept our worship as we go into the world and Lord as we witness to others Lord may it be a a witness of of happiness and joy. Lord, may it be a witness of testimony that goes out saying, "I am in this place because God put me here and I am a believer and there is all friends, there is always hope in Jesus Christ." Lord, let that be our testimony. May we be an encouragement to others. We thank you for this service. We thank you for every person here. And Lord, I'd like to name each one that is here present and maybe on the stream. And Lord, I can't do it, but I want to say thank you for each one has made the effort to be here this morning. Thank you, Lord. It's an encouragement. Thank you for your greatness and your mercy in Jesus name. Amen. I'm going through. Yes, I'm going through. Let's sing it with just our voices. This song says, "I'll pay the price whatever others do." Maybe that price is just giving the Lord thanks. Regardless of what the situation is, let's sing with just our voices. I'm going through, Jesus. I'm going through. I'll pay the [singing] price. Whatever others do, I'll take the way with the Lord's despise you. I've started with [singing] Jesus and I'm going through. I'm going through. I'm going through. [music] I'll pay the price. Whatever [singing] others do, I'll take the way with the Lord despise few. I'm going with Jesus [music] and I'm going through. Praise the Lord. Let's be let's keep clapping our hands and let's sing. [applause] What a mighty God we serve. What a mighty God we serve. Hallelujah. Angels bow before him. Heaven and [music] earth adore him. What a mighty God we serve. Sing it again. What a mighty God. Hallelujah. What a mighty God we serve. What a [music and singing] mighty God we serve. Angels bow before him. Heaven and earth adore him. What a mighty [music and singing] God we serve. Praise him a little bit this morning. Come on. What a mighty. What a mighty God we serve.

Jesus, that mighty God. What a mighty God we serve. That man, the mighty God in flesh, that leper came back and fell down at his feet and he looked down and he says, "You are made whole." Praise God. I want that same one. And we have the opportunity. We can bow down before that same one, that mighty God, that great Jehovah that came down from heaven and dwelt in a man. That man gave his life for me and he resurrected and then he gave gifts unto men. Then he said that you can have that same spirit that was on me. that same spirit can enter into you in the form of the Holy Spirit. What a promise. What a mighty God we serve. God bless you brothers and sisters. No service tonight. We will have service on Wednesday night. Brother Lyle will be ministering for us on Wednesday. God bless you. Remember, be grateful. Be thankful. God is good. He's wonderful. God bless you. You're dismissed.
