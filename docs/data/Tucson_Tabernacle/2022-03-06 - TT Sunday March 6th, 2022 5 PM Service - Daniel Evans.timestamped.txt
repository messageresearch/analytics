[36:43] the people to understand
[36:46] what was just read and it could be read
[36:48] in the bible maybe
[36:50] on a tape
[36:51] you know we listened to brother branham
[36:52] i didn't quite understand that and it's
[36:54] our role maybe not to bring a new
[36:56] message
[36:58] but to to help explain the message
[37:00] that's already been brought i know
[37:02] brother greene i heard brother bran i'm
[37:04] talking about brother green the other
[37:05] day and he said brother greene said that
[37:07] brother greene said that it's not my
[37:09] role to bring a new message but but just
[37:12] to concentrate on what's already been
[37:14] brought brother brown thought that was a
[37:16] noble thing and i feel the same way
[37:19] that we have a message it's been brought
[37:22] and now let's just really dig into it
[37:25] and understand it
[37:27] first
[37:28] then i spoke on the serpent seed and now
[37:31] the serpent seeds misunderstood
[37:33] it's you have two young people and
[37:36] they're in the garden of eden and god
[37:37] wanted them to prosper
[37:39] he loved them they were his children
[37:41] and they they were youth you know they
[37:43] were they were young people
[37:46] and
[37:46] he said just don't do this one thing
[37:50] and as young people are
[37:52] first thing that they do
[37:54] well why not you know
[37:56] you know and then they start wondering
[37:57] well why can't i do that even like a
[37:59] little kid don't go outside well then he
[38:02] wants to go outside you know
[38:04] what whatever it might be and then and
[38:06] then they made this mistake
[38:09] and then god
[38:11] makes a way for them
[38:13] as a father
[38:15] and he loved his children and he made
[38:18] away from them and he slowly killed this
[38:20] lamb
[38:22] and he wrapped up their nakedness their
[38:25] shame
[38:26] and then that was the first place that
[38:28] we see
[38:30] a sacrifice
[38:31] and then we see a sacrifice all of these
[38:33] years
[38:35] until our lord jesus came and then god
[38:37] gave that sacrifice as the perfect
[38:41] sacrifice
[38:43] and then
[38:44] we then on the next one we had uh some
[38:47] baptisms here
[38:49] which
[38:50] uh spurred some questions and it should
[38:52] talking about baptism okay well what
[38:54] about this one about that so i had some
[38:56] questions about that so i ministered on
[38:57] baptism
[38:59] and
[39:00] i
[39:01] what had happened
[39:03] as a prelude to that is our brother
[39:04] peter mcfadden
[39:06] um back there i don't see him but
[39:08] brother peter was witnessing to a young
[39:11] jewish man
[39:14] and
[39:15] this young jewish man accepted the lord
[39:18] jesus christ as his savior
[39:22] and peter was counseling him
[39:25] on these things
[39:27] and i felt on my heart
[39:29] not knowing
[39:30] that peter was dealing with this young
[39:33] man named david
[39:35] and i felt on my heart to preach on
[39:38] baptism because of the questions that we
[39:41] had received because of the baptism that
[39:42] was here
[39:44] and the lord has a way of tying in again
[39:47] all he
[39:48] places the puzzle pieces just perfectly
[39:51] so
[39:52] i texted brother peter and i said hey
[39:54] i'm going to be ministering on baptism
[39:56] because i know he had been worth
[39:59] witnessing to this young man well the
[40:00] young man came
[40:02] his name is david i recognize him in the
[40:04] service
[40:05] and
[40:07] i preached about
[40:08] how
[40:09] baptism
[40:11] comes
[40:13] with a name
[40:14] and that that's part of it
[40:16] and baptism what is one requirement for
[40:19] baptism
[40:20] is a confession of the lord jesus christ
[40:23] that is paramount to baptism i accept
[40:27] the lord jesus christ as my savior i
[40:30] believe he is the son of god
[40:32] and then there is a promise that goes
[40:34] along with that baptism which is the
[40:37] filling
[40:38] of the holy spirit am i right
[40:40] acts 2 38 of course
[40:43] and then talking about that i gave two
[40:46] examples do you remember i gave a a seek
[40:50] that some of the brothers in
[40:51] jeffersonville had witnessed to
[40:53] he uh a sikh from india like a hindu
[40:56] they're different but uh in in that part
[40:58] of the world
[40:59] and uh
[41:01] i gave kind of kind of the failure there
[41:04] where these brothers had pushed him to
[41:06] be baptized and they asked me to baptize
[41:08] him and when i talked to him i asked him
[41:10] if he had accepted the lord jesus as a
[41:12] savior and he said no he hadn't then i
[41:15] said i'm not going to baptize him
[41:18] so then they baptized them anyways and
[41:19] it turned out it was a train wreck
[41:20] because the the man moved in with one of
[41:23] the brothers and started stealing from
[41:24] it and then finally they kicked him out
[41:27] but then i gave another example of the
[41:28] good way and that was a brother joseph
[41:31] ayers a friend of mine
[41:32] brother rome you know where's brother
[41:34] rome there you are you know brother
[41:36] brother ayers right you remember brother
[41:37] harris of course brother ayers
[41:40] had uh had it on his heart he gave his
[41:42] heart to the lord jesus and he had it on
[41:44] his heart to be baptized
[41:46] and so
[41:47] brother ayres had asked a few different
[41:49] brothers to baptize him they said no
[41:50] because he smoked cigarettes well
[41:52] brother collins who was living here in
[41:54] tucson at the time he brings brother
[41:56] heirs up to sabino canyon and baptizes
[42:00] him and then to make a long story short
[42:02] that was the last cigarette brothers
[42:04] heir smoked
[42:05] so it was it was just it was a nice
[42:07] little testimony and not knowing what
[42:08] you're saying well this brother was
[42:10] sitting up here he tells brother peter
[42:13] okay
[42:14] i want to be baptized and i want to be
[42:16] baptized in sabino canyon
[42:18] so two days later
[42:21] brother peter
[42:22] brother lyle
[42:23] brother john
[42:25] borland back there and me
[42:28] go up to baptize this young man in the
[42:31] name of the lord jesus christ in sabino
[42:33] canyon freezing cold
[42:35] but they didn't shiver a bit brother
[42:37] peter brought him into the water and
[42:39] brother peter baptized him and it was
[42:41] just
[42:41] a wonderful day wasn't it so then
[42:44] afterwards sister heather makes us
[42:46] breakfast at her house
[42:49] so we all the gang comes and and we are
[42:51] eating breakfast at sister heather's
[42:53] house
[42:55] and giving testimonies and
[42:57] and uh this young man david he's was
[43:00] born i believe in jerusalem
[43:03] a translator into hebrew spanish and
[43:05] english
[43:06] very much a jew
[43:08] so he and brother lyles kind of spoke
[43:10] the same language they were singing
[43:12] hebrew songs and you know we were doing
[43:14] like a lot of people doing church and
[43:15] just kind of
[43:16] you know moving your mouth like you know
[43:18] no words are coming out
[43:20] so then so then
[43:22] brother-in-law and then we switched a
[43:24] couple that we knew
[43:25] but we're fellowshipping around the
[43:27] table
[43:29] and
[43:31] the
[43:34] the name of god came up
[43:36] and brother david said
[43:39] and i believe it was brother peter that
[43:40] witnessed him he's about bad baptism he
[43:43] said as soon as i saw
[43:46] that there was a name
[43:48] associated with baptism
[43:51] i knew it was
[43:52] right so we started talking and it
[43:55] spurred the conversation of talking
[43:57] about the name of god in the old
[43:59] testament
[44:00] and if
[44:01] real quick uh have you turned in your
[44:02] bibles to job chapter one
[44:06] this isn't my subject but it will lead
[44:08] into my subject
[44:15] if you look
[44:17] let's say uh
[44:18] let's go to verse six
[44:20] it says now there was a day when the
[44:22] sons of god came to present themselves
[44:25] before the lord now notice that lord
[44:27] notice it's all caps
[44:29] now i'm going to give you a little bible
[44:31] lesson
[44:32] that
[44:33] all caps
[44:35] is the name of god
[44:37] and it is
[44:39] spelled and brother lyle can give the
[44:41] explanation it's spelled y-h-w-h
[44:45] you are not permitted to pronounce that
[44:48] name out loud
[44:49] if you are a jew
[44:51] so and you find now all throughout your
[44:54] bible you will find in certain things
[44:56] that are all capped sometimes it's god
[44:57] usually it's lord
[44:59] and
[45:00] when you see that
[45:02] it's that y
[45:04] h w h it's called the tetragrammaton or
[45:08] something like that um and it's the name
[45:10] of god
[45:12] so as our brother david was talking
[45:15] he was saying that that
[45:17] he was breaking down that name
[45:20] and he was saying that it is
[45:23] past tense
[45:25] the first part of it
[45:27] present tense the middle of it
[45:30] and future tense
[45:32] the end of it
[45:34] so then brother john immediately says
[45:36] when he says that brother john says the
[45:38] same yesterday today and forever
[45:41] oh man it was beautiful even
[45:43] jesus christ
[45:44] even way back in the old testament he's
[45:47] testified even with the name of god and
[45:49] you see when the new testament comes
[45:51] along
[45:53] that name
[45:54] all caps lord
[45:56] it disappears
[45:57] it's mysteriously gone you know brother
[46:00] branham's revelation jehovah of the old
[46:03] testament this yahweh this yh vh this
[46:08] this
[46:09] mysterious god
[46:12] there he is made flesh
[46:15] and out in front of us all right
[46:18] so what a what a blessing
[46:20] that that was to um
[46:23] be there bro it was just i was i was on
[46:26] fire i was so excited that uh when we
[46:28] were talking about about those things
[46:31] and um
[46:32] so then i got another question
[46:34] and it's from someone i know to be a
[46:36] prayer warrior
[46:38] and um
[46:39] but first before i get into the question
[46:42] second timothy 3 16 says all scripture
[46:46] is given by inspiration of god
[46:48] and profitable for doctrine
[46:50] so
[46:51] if it's written in this bible
[46:55] then it's good for doctrine we can
[46:56] preach about it now we have to know what
[46:58] it means first we can't go into this
[47:00] haphazardly
[47:02] but
[47:04] we uh
[47:05] we're okay to minister on these things
[47:09] and this
[47:10] this um
[47:12] question came up
[47:14] and i knew the answer when the sister
[47:16] gave me the question
[47:19] but as i was praying for it i saw that
[47:21] it got a lot deeper and if you go
[47:25] to job 1 6
[47:28] it says this
[47:32] now there was a day when the sons of god
[47:34] came to the to present themselves before
[47:36] the lord
[47:37] and satan came also among them
[47:40] and the lord said unto satan whence
[47:42] cometh thou
[47:43] then satan answered
[47:45] the lord and said from going to and fro
[47:47] in the earth and from walking up and
[47:49] down in it now flip over to job 2
[47:53] verse 1.
[47:55] and again
[47:57] there was a day when the sons of god
[47:58] came to present themselves before the
[48:00] lord and satan came also among them to
[48:02] present himself before the lord and the
[48:04] lord said unto satan from whence cometh
[48:07] thou
[48:08] and satan answered the lord and said
[48:10] from going to and fro in the earth and
[48:12] from walking up and down in it now that
[48:15] word satan
[48:16] is a hebrew word and it means accuser
[48:20] and
[48:21] as i was
[48:22] researching this and praying about this
[48:24] i thought about saint john 14 and 15
[48:28] and christ the holy spirit is the
[48:31] comforter
[48:32] so we have the opposites here we have
[48:34] the accuser that comes here before the
[48:36] lord and then later on we have the
[48:38] comforter that comes
[48:40] the question
[48:42] that my sister asked was who were these
[48:44] sons of god
[48:47] that came to offer themselves
[48:49] very very deep
[48:51] question somebody that has
[48:53] a lot of understand i don't think that
[48:54] she would want me maybe to to say who
[48:57] she is sister sheila you don't mind if i
[48:58] say
[49:00] no
[49:01] i can't
[49:02] no
[49:03] okay i won't i won't tell anybody
[49:08] but what a question
[49:09] what what what a tremendous question and
[49:12] um first of all they come here and satan
[49:14] among is among them it doesn't say satan
[49:16] is one of them
[49:18] let me let me read this quote from
[49:20] from um sirs we would see jesus
[49:23] now there's always three classes of
[49:24] people every meeting has them every city
[49:27] has them every church has them that is
[49:29] unbelievers make believers and believers
[49:33] that's exactly right it's the it's
[49:36] always been that way it is yet today
[49:38] every congregation every assembling
[49:41] together even when the sons of god came
[49:45] up before god
[49:47] there he was
[49:49] so when we're when we're studying these
[49:51] things
[49:53] if i don't immediately know if i can't
[49:55] just
[49:56] really know it by the scriptures of
[49:58] course god sent us a gift
[50:01] in this day
[50:02] a great gift a gift that should not be
[50:05] neglected
[50:06] and that is god sent a prophet according
[50:09] to scriptures
[50:11] and friends sometimes we we look at
[50:12] brother branham and we say we say oh
[50:14] well you have to be careful about
[50:16] looking at a man brother wasn't that a
[50:19] great story that that brother told about
[50:21] the elk hunting
[50:22] and it's just a man well god uses men
[50:26] and
[50:28] with brother branham it's not just a man
[50:30] it's god speaking through a man so when
[50:33] we don't understand these scriptures
[50:37] we have a gift
[50:38] in the tapes and and going to the voice
[50:41] of god product the table and look for
[50:44] these things it's it's the first thing
[50:46] that we should do when we think that we
[50:48] have a revelation is look and see let's
[50:50] see what the prophet said about it
[50:53] so towards the end of the book of job
[50:56] chapter 38
[50:58] let me read another
[51:00] scripture here sister shirley and you
[51:01] might like this one too
[51:05] 38 verse 4
[51:07] where wast thou when i
[51:09] laid the foundations of the earth
[51:11] declare if thou has understanding who
[51:14] hath laid the measures thereof if thou
[51:16] knowest or who hath stretched the line
[51:18] upon it whereupon are the foundations
[51:21] have fastened or who laid the
[51:23] cornerstone thereof
[51:24] when the morning stars sang together and
[51:27] all the sons of god shouted for joy
[51:30] now i'm going to make an assumption
[51:33] i'm going to make the assumption that
[51:35] these sons of god
[51:38] are the same sons of god as in verse
[51:41] chapter 1 and chapter 2.
[51:44] i looked back at all the different
[51:45] translations it looks like the very same
[51:48] ones and there's some
[51:52] as i look to other comments on this
[51:54] there's some of the theologians that say
[51:56] oh well well these are angels
[51:59] um
[52:00] if uh if you go to hebrews chapter one
[52:02] it says this and you don't have to turn
[52:03] no i'll read it real quick it says for
[52:05] under which of the angels said he had
[52:07] any time thou art my son this day have i
[52:09] begotten thee and again i will beat him
[52:11] a father and he shall be my son right
[52:13] here paul is saying or the author of
[52:15] hebrews is saying that angels are not
[52:18] sons of god
[52:19] we
[52:20] are sons of god
[52:22] and there was one virgin born begotten
[52:25] son of god
[52:27] so let's go to our first quote here
[52:29] spiritual amnesia
[52:33] so we see that
[52:35] many scholars think that these are
[52:37] angels
[52:38] i would differ
[52:40] notice
[52:41] and he is in me and i in him notice then
[52:44] every christian that's a real genuine
[52:46] christian
[52:47] christian was with him
[52:49] when the morning stars sang together and
[52:51] the sons of god shouted for joy before
[52:54] there was a foundation of the world
[52:56] we
[52:57] are identified in the immortal realms
[53:00] with god 10 million years before the
[53:03] world ever was formed
[53:05] i was back there with him
[53:09] if i got eternal life i was there with
[53:12] him i was identified with them when the
[53:15] morning stars sang together and the sons
[53:17] of god shouted for joy
[53:19] so was i
[53:22] sister shirley i believe i was there
[53:25] i believe we were there we can't
[53:28] understand it
[53:29] we i'm not i'm not saying that there's
[53:31] some sort of pre-existence doctrine or
[53:33] anything like that
[53:35] but i do believe
[53:37] that i was in jesus christ and i believe
[53:41] that i was there with those sons of god
[53:44] let me go on
[53:45] adoption number two
[53:49] uh
[53:50] brother let's start at the let's start
[53:51] at the scripture
[53:53] adoption number two having predestinated
[53:56] us having predestinated them unto the
[53:58] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[54:01] himself according to his own pleasure to
[54:03] the praises of his glory
[54:06] you got it right there yeah keep on
[54:08] going down there right before 149 go to
[54:10] 149.
[54:13] oh do you get it
[54:14] to the praises of his glory that he
[54:17] could set there in the eternal ages
[54:20] that is to roll on and his children
[54:22] would scream abba father abba father and
[54:24] the angels say
[54:26] what
[54:27] they talking about what are they talking
[54:29] about so beautifully displayed in the
[54:31] prodigal son i was lost this is my son
[54:34] he was lost and now he's found he was
[54:36] dead and he's alive again bring forth
[54:39] the fatted calf the best robe
[54:41] a ring and put it on his finger
[54:44] and let's no wonder when the morning
[54:46] stars sang together and the sons of god
[54:49] shouted for joy when they seen the plan
[54:52] of salvation god putting your name on
[54:55] the book before the foundation of the
[54:57] world yeah that's something to shout
[55:00] about
[55:01] praise the lord and i believe again i
[55:04] was there
[55:05] the serpent's seed brother branham's
[55:07] praying he says this
[55:09] he says dear god the great and mighty
[55:11] god who formed all things by the power
[55:13] of his spirit and has brought jesus
[55:15] christ his only begotten son who freely
[55:18] died for we sinners the just for the
[55:20] unjust to reconcile us back into this
[55:24] marvelous fellowship that we have again
[55:27] with god as we are taught in the blessed
[55:30] word that we had fellowship with him
[55:33] before the foundation of the world when
[55:35] the morning stars sang together and the
[55:37] sons of god shouted for joy way back
[55:39] before the foundation of the world how
[55:42] do we know
[55:43] that that wasn't at the same time that
[55:45] the lamb was slain
[55:46] that when god in his great thinking seen
[55:49] us shouting and rejoicing in our
[55:51] salvation through jesus
[55:53] thank the lord
[55:55] again serpent seed brother branham says
[55:58] this i want to ask you
[56:00] who is this job 27 38
[56:03] he said
[56:05] where was you when i laid the
[56:06] foundations of the earth
[56:08] when the morning stars sang together and
[56:09] the sons of god shouted for joy who were
[56:12] those sons of god that was shouting for
[56:15] joy jesus told them that
[56:18] i had joy with you before the foundation
[56:21] of the world
[56:23] we're not creatures of time we're
[56:26] creatures of
[56:28] eternity
[56:30] i believe
[56:32] we
[56:33] were
[56:34] there
[56:35] and another thing you know i was i was
[56:36] talking to him
[56:38] earlier about how much that i don't want
[56:40] to leave you you know i i i don't want
[56:43] to leave this little group
[56:45] and i feel like
[56:46] if we were with christ
[56:51] and
[56:51] we are in christ together then we were
[56:54] with each other
[56:56] we don't remember that of course and and
[56:59] i don't know that brother bernard i i
[57:01] can't say this for sure
[57:04] but i do believe that we were together i
[57:07] believe that we had fellowship in christ
[57:09] you know eternity doesn't start right
[57:11] here
[57:13] eternity
[57:14] it goes as far this way
[57:17] as it goes that way
[57:18] so it's as far behind us
[57:21] as it is in front of us we are not as
[57:23] brother braham said we are not creatures
[57:25] of time we don't understand these things
[57:28] our minds can't understand eternity
[57:31] now i think it was
[57:33] well paul said he said eye has not seen
[57:35] an ear is not heard the joy for those
[57:39] that love god and
[57:41] i think it's the same way we don't
[57:43] understand many of these things of god
[57:45] isaiah said
[57:47] my ways are not your ways
[57:50] my thoughts are not your thoughts our
[57:52] thoughts are not god's thoughts
[57:54] he's greater than us
[57:56] but we were with him
[57:58] and i believe very very
[58:01] strongly that we were together
[58:04] in christ
[58:06] eternity that way and
[58:09] eternity this way
[58:11] i was as i was praying about this
[58:17] sister shirley i loved the question
[58:20] and it meant a lot to me and i was as i
[58:23] was praying about it
[58:25] i said
[58:26] lord how will this help the congregation
[58:30] this isn't a trivia
[58:32] you know this isn't me getting up here
[58:34] and saying oh this is i bet you didn't
[58:36] know this oh that's nice no that's
[58:38] that's not the way church is
[58:40] it we have to apply it to our lives
[58:43] brother aaron i i think i used one time
[58:45] i used um
[58:46] the analogy of google maps you know you
[58:48] get on your computer and you get on
[58:50] there and and you grab the little guy
[58:52] and you have the map down in front of
[58:55] you and you're looking at the map like
[58:56] this and you grab the little guy and you
[58:59] drop him on the street view and he
[59:01] wiggles his arm and he lands and then he
[59:04] looks around
[59:06] and you can see the street
[59:08] and all of a sudden you are on that
[59:11] street and that's how this bible is
[59:14] we can take ourselves and we place
[59:17] ourselves
[59:18] in this word
[59:20] and then
[59:22] then we are men then we
[59:25] can do the will of god and then we can
[59:27] not only
[59:28] receive what we have need of but we can
[59:30] also be servants to others and we can do
[59:32] it right not make mistakes
[59:34] so i was praying about it
[59:36] and
[59:37] i didn't uh
[59:38] i didn't really know
[59:40] how is this
[59:43] how is this going to bless the people
[59:45] how will this encourage the people in
[59:47] the position that we're in now
[59:50] and
[59:51] i believe the lord laid something on my
[59:53] heart and i i could be wrong
[59:55] i don't uh i don't like to say lord told
[59:57] me something there's many times that i
[59:59] get a revelation
[1:00:01] and i believe it comes from god but then
[1:00:02] i always have to check that revelation i
[1:00:04] always have to pray
[1:00:06] about that revelation because it can
[1:00:07] seem so real
[1:00:09] and yet be wrong
[1:00:12] so i was
[1:00:14] studying and meditating on this and
[1:00:17] praying on this
[1:00:18] and i believe the lord did give me the
[1:00:20] scripture if you turn to matthew chapter
[1:00:23] 8 with me
[1:00:25] now remember
[1:00:26] we have a representation
[1:00:29] i believe that i just proved from what
[1:00:31] brother branham said what job said that
[1:00:33] there is a representation
[1:00:36] over on the other side somewhere
[1:00:39] we call it heaven
[1:00:41] somewhere over there
[1:00:42] daniel evans
[1:00:44] is represented
[1:00:47] and then i saw
[1:00:49] jesus in this sermon
[1:00:52] he makes reference to the same thing
[1:00:54] we'll start with verse 1.
[1:00:57] at that time came the disciples unto
[1:01:00] jesus saying who is greatest in the
[1:01:02] kingdom of heaven look at we already
[1:01:03] have a dispute here we you know i want a
[1:01:05] position i want to be the pastor no i
[1:01:07] want to be the deacon i want to be this
[1:01:09] you know
[1:01:11] everybody wants
[1:01:12] it for themselves
[1:01:15] and even like when our children or many
[1:01:17] of us are dads when our kids are
[1:01:18] fighting
[1:01:19] it doesn't matter to us who's right with
[1:01:22] our kids
[1:01:23] you know they're hollering and they're
[1:01:24] fighting it's like peace
[1:01:26] stop well he did this i don't care
[1:01:29] it doesn't matter just just peace and
[1:01:31] here's what jesus says
[1:01:34] and jesus called a little child unto him
[1:01:37] and he set him in the midst of them
[1:01:40] and he said verily i say unto you except
[1:01:43] ye be converted and become as this as
[1:01:45] little children
[1:01:46] you shall not
[1:01:47] enter into the kingdom of heaven brother
[1:01:50] aaron i believe ministered this morning
[1:01:51] he talked about that we are nothing
[1:01:54] but god is everything and then we we
[1:01:56] should become humble and as innocent as
[1:01:58] a child and then and then we'll enter in
[1:02:02] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[1:02:04] as this little child the same is
[1:02:06] greatest in the kingdom of heaven and
[1:02:07] whoso shall receive one such as a such
[1:02:11] little child in my name receiveth me
[1:02:13] but whoso shall offend one of these
[1:02:15] little ones which believe in me
[1:02:18] it were better for him that a millstone
[1:02:20] were hanged about his neck
[1:02:22] and that he would drown in the depths of
[1:02:24] the sea
[1:02:25] friends we should be careful what we say
[1:02:29] we may very well be talking about
[1:02:31] someone that has a representative
[1:02:34] representative in heaven
[1:02:36] and i'm going to get to that and i'm
[1:02:37] going to prove what i just said
[1:02:40] watch our tongues do everything in love
[1:02:43] woe unto the world because of offenses
[1:02:46] for it must needs that offenses come but
[1:02:48] woe unto that man by whom
[1:02:52] the offense cometh wherefore if thy hand
[1:02:55] or thy foot offend thee cut them off
[1:02:58] and cast them from me it is better for
[1:03:00] thee to enter into life halt or maimed
[1:03:02] rather than having two hands or two feet
[1:03:05] and be cast into everlasting fire let me
[1:03:08] tell you jesus christ preached holiness
[1:03:11] he preached living a holy life he didn't
[1:03:15] preach legalism
[1:03:17] if he would have preached legalism he
[1:03:18] would have a set of rules
[1:03:20] you know your hair needs to be this long
[1:03:22] his skirt needs to be this long you have
[1:03:23] to do your face has to look like this
[1:03:26] your brothers you have to wear your
[1:03:27] pants like this and your tie like this
[1:03:29] he would have given us a set of rules he
[1:03:30] didn't do that
[1:03:34] but he said
[1:03:35] if your hand causes you to sin which is
[1:03:38] what he was talking about an offense cut
[1:03:39] it off that's how important it is
[1:03:42] and if television causes us to sin get
[1:03:45] rid of it
[1:03:46] if the internet causes us to sin
[1:03:49] get rid of it jesus wasn't preaching a
[1:03:52] rule a set of rules but if those things
[1:03:54] are causing us to sin
[1:03:56] get rid of it and who did he put the
[1:03:58] decision on
[1:04:00] not not the pulpit
[1:04:02] he put the decision on the individual
[1:04:08] if thine eye if any pluck it out
[1:04:10] and cast it from me for it is better for
[1:04:13] thee to enter into life with one eye
[1:04:16] rather than having two eyes and be cast
[1:04:18] into hell fire
[1:04:20] take heed
[1:04:21] now listen to this
[1:04:24] take heed that ye despise not one of
[1:04:26] these little ones for i say unto you
[1:04:29] that in heaven their angels do always
[1:04:30] behold the face of my father which is in
[1:04:32] heaven
[1:04:33] notice that these children had a
[1:04:35] representation at that time
[1:04:38] in heaven so he says don't offend one of
[1:04:41] these these little ones because right
[1:04:43] now somehow someway
[1:04:46] some people call it theophany body some
[1:04:47] people call it a celestial body it's
[1:04:50] it's a little bit above my pay grade to
[1:04:52] understand all these things i believe
[1:04:54] them
[1:04:55] and i love them and so many people tell
[1:04:58] me oh it's this and this
[1:05:00] thank you
[1:05:02] i don't i still don't understand it
[1:05:04] but i do believe it i do believe that
[1:05:06] there is some sort of a representative
[1:05:09] up there for daniel evans
[1:05:11] in the presence of god
[1:05:13] now just like there was for these kids
[1:05:24] for the son of man is come to save that
[1:05:27] which was lost
[1:05:29] how think he if a man have a hundred
[1:05:31] sheep and one of them
[1:05:33] be gone astray that he not leave the 90
[1:05:36] and 9 and goeth into the mountains and
[1:05:39] seek
[1:05:40] that which one that which has gone
[1:05:42] astray
[1:05:45] one thing we have lost
[1:05:47] friends in the so-called message of the
[1:05:50] hour one thing that i think has faded
[1:05:53] brother wilson is our love
[1:05:56] for lost souls
[1:05:58] and our burden for lost souls jesus
[1:06:01] right here says that there's 99 sheep
[1:06:05] be like oh fine i'll just keep my 99 let
[1:06:07] the one go and get eaten by wolves
[1:06:10] no
[1:06:10] that one
[1:06:12] is the one that that shepherd is focused
[1:06:13] on go and get that sheep what if that
[1:06:16] sheep is your son or your daughter
[1:06:19] what if that sheep is your grandson or
[1:06:21] your granddaughter what if that sheep is
[1:06:23] your husband or your wife
[1:06:25] that sheep
[1:06:27] is the focus of jesus
[1:06:30] of this sermon right here we cannot
[1:06:33] neglect those
[1:06:39] oh amen
[1:06:42] where was i where am i verse 12.
[1:06:45] i was just
[1:06:47] rejoicing over that that verse that
[1:06:49] scripture
[1:06:51] the 99 are in they're in the pen they're
[1:06:54] okay but when that one gets out friends
[1:06:57] this whole church should mobilize and go
[1:06:59] get them
[1:07:02] and if so be that he find it verily i
[1:07:05] say unto you he rejoiceth more of that
[1:07:07] sheep than of the 90-9 which went not
[1:07:10] astray
[1:07:11] even so it is not the will of your
[1:07:13] father which is in heaven that one of
[1:07:14] these little ones should perish
[1:07:17] moreover
[1:07:18] if thy brother
[1:07:20] shall trespass against thee and go
[1:07:23] go and tell him his fault between thee
[1:07:26] and him alone
[1:07:30] if he shall hear thee thou has gained
[1:07:32] thy brother
[1:07:34] now here
[1:07:36] we get into the lesson that i want to
[1:07:39] give
[1:07:40] friends what's the first thing we do
[1:07:42] when somebody wrongs us
[1:07:44] do we tell the brother or the sister no
[1:07:46] we go tell everybody else
[1:07:48] jesus said go to you and him alone
[1:07:52] am i right that's a hard thing to do
[1:07:57] and if you do
[1:07:58] you've gained your brother
[1:08:05] but if he will not hear thee then take
[1:08:07] with thee one or two
[1:08:08] more that in the mouth of two or three
[1:08:11] witnesses every word may be established
[1:08:13] and if you still neglect to hear them
[1:08:14] tell it to unto the church but if you
[1:08:16] neglect to hear
[1:08:18] the church
[1:08:20] let him be unto thee as a heathen and a
[1:08:22] heathen man and a publican
[1:08:24] verily i say unto you
[1:08:27] whosoever
[1:08:28] whatsoever ye shall bind on earth
[1:08:30] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:08:32] you shall loose on earth shall be loosed
[1:08:35] in heaven once again we see a connection
[1:08:38] between earth and heaven
[1:08:40] there is there is something going on
[1:08:43] between here and there
[1:08:49] oh
[1:08:50] again i say unto you that if two of you
[1:08:53] shall agree on earth as touching
[1:08:55] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[1:08:58] done for them of my father which is in
[1:08:59] heaven for where two or three are
[1:09:02] gathered together in my name there i am
[1:09:05] in the midst of them jesus is saying
[1:09:08] that we should have unity
[1:09:11] unity is important
[1:09:15] and peter it wasn't computing
[1:09:18] he didn't get it maybe peter's was stuck
[1:09:20] in the old testament for a little while
[1:09:23] and and he didn't understand this and he
[1:09:25] says he says wait wait a minute wait a
[1:09:27] minute teacher
[1:09:29] hold on a second
[1:09:30] and he says this
[1:09:33] then came peter to him and said lord how
[1:09:35] oft shall my brother sin against me and
[1:09:37] i forgive him till seven times look at
[1:09:39] all what this guy has done to me
[1:09:42] and you want me to forgive him
[1:09:44] seven times
[1:09:46] jesus answered
[1:09:49] jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee
[1:09:51] until seven times but until 70 times
[1:09:54] seven
[1:09:57] i was uh
[1:09:58] when i worked at voice of god we were
[1:10:02] we were in the mail room the power went
[1:10:03] out in the building
[1:10:05] so we were uh all of our computers are
[1:10:08] off
[1:10:09] so we all kind of congregated in the
[1:10:11] biggest room in the voice of god

[1:10:15] the mail room and there's tables out
[1:10:16] there and we were all sitting on the
[1:10:18] tables

[1:10:20] the lights to come on and brother

[1:14:39] james was a pastor james was the pastor
[1:14:43] of the church in jerusalem he's probably
[1:14:44] the first real
[1:14:46] message pastor that we see in the world
[1:14:49] he was probably the first christian
[1:14:51] pastor he was the he was the head of the
[1:14:53] church in jerusalem and then the
[1:14:55] apostles peter and john and them they
[1:14:58] had other roles but james here
[1:15:01] and if you read his book he's looking
[1:15:03] after his people
[1:15:05] and he's trying to keep his people
[1:15:07] on target here
[1:15:08] james chapter 3 verse 1 my brethren be
[1:15:11] not many masters
[1:15:13] knowing that we shall receive the
[1:15:14] greater condemnation for in many things
[1:15:17] we offend all
[1:15:18] if any man offend not in the word
[1:15:21] the same is a perfect man able also to
[1:15:25] bridle the whole body
[1:15:27] now the pastor is introducing correction
[1:15:30] to his congregation
[1:15:32] behold we put bits in the horse's mouths
[1:15:35] and that they may obey us and we turn
[1:15:37] about their whole body
[1:15:39] behold also the ships
[1:15:41] which
[1:15:42] though they may be so great are driven
[1:15:44] of fierce winds
[1:15:46] yet they are turned about with a very
[1:15:49] small helm
[1:15:50] whether so ever the governor listed you
[1:15:52] know what he's talking about a big ship
[1:15:54] just that little rudder
[1:15:55] steers that whole ship
[1:15:59] even so
[1:16:01] the tongue is a little member and
[1:16:03] boasted great things
[1:16:05] behold how great a matter a little fire
[1:16:08] kindleth
[1:16:09] and the tongue is a fire
[1:16:12] a world of iniquity
[1:16:13] so is the tongue among our members that
[1:16:15] it defileth the whole body and setteth
[1:16:18] on fire the course of nature and is set
[1:16:21] on fire of hell
[1:16:24] comparing our very words to hell
[1:16:28] we need to use caution
[1:16:30] because those people we are speaking
[1:16:32] about may have a representation
[1:16:35] up in heaven
[1:16:39] for every kind of beast and of birds and
[1:16:41] of serpents and of things in the sea is
[1:16:43] tamed
[1:16:44] and hath been tamed of mankind but the
[1:16:46] tongue can no man tame it is an unruly
[1:16:49] evil full of deadly poison
[1:16:52] therewith bless we god even the father
[1:16:55] and
[1:16:56] and therewith we curse we curse we men
[1:16:59] which
[1:17:00] which are made after the similitude of
[1:17:02] god
[1:17:05] we can speak evil friends
[1:17:07] and uh
[1:17:13] we could be speaking the truth
[1:17:15] and still be speaking evil
[1:17:18] out of the same mouth perceived blessing
[1:17:20] and cursing
[1:17:21] my brother and these things ought not to
[1:17:23] be so
[1:17:24] not not not so to be that the fountains
[1:17:27] send forth the same place sweet water
[1:17:29] and bitter
[1:17:30] can a fig tree my brethren bear olive
[1:17:33] berries either a vine figs
[1:17:35] so can no fountain both yield salt water
[1:17:38] and fresh
[1:17:42] if you think i'm talking about somebody
[1:17:43] else i'm not
[1:17:45] i'm talking about the person wearing
[1:17:47] your shoes and my shoes and i'm speaking
[1:17:50] to myself here
[1:17:53] who is a wise man
[1:17:55] and endued with knowledge among you let
[1:17:57] him show out of a good conversation his
[1:17:59] works with meekness and wisdom
[1:18:03] as you saw as you just witnessed my
[1:18:05] testimony from brother billy paul about
[1:18:06] brother branham
[1:18:08] but if you have bitter envying and
[1:18:09] strife in your hearts glory not and lie
[1:18:12] not against the truth
[1:18:14] this wisdom descendeth not from above
[1:18:16] but is earthly sensual devilish
[1:18:20] for where envying and strife is there is
[1:18:22] confusion and every evil work
[1:18:26] but the wisdom that is from above is
[1:18:28] first pure
[1:18:29] then peaceable
[1:18:31] gentle and easy to be entreated full of
[1:18:34] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[1:18:37] and without
[1:18:38] hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness
[1:18:41] is sown in peace of them that make peace
[1:18:45] what words
[1:18:47] for my brother the pastor
[1:18:50] let's go to the book of jude
[1:18:54] i'll start with eight
[1:18:57] jude is just
[1:18:58] one chapter
[1:19:00] likewise also these filthy dreamers
[1:19:02] defile the flesh despise dominion and
[1:19:04] speak evil of dignities
[1:19:06] yet michael the archangel when
[1:19:08] contending with the devil
[1:19:11] he disputed about the body of moses does
[1:19:14] not bring
[1:19:15] against him a railing accusation but
[1:19:18] said the lord rebuked thee the angel
[1:19:22] michael
[1:19:24] archangel
[1:19:26] coming against this the very root of all
[1:19:30] evil
[1:19:31] this satan
[1:19:32] the accuser
[1:19:35] and here is michael and yet michael's
[1:19:37] not
[1:19:38] running him down
[1:19:40] behind his back
[1:19:42] michael's not bringing accusations
[1:19:44] against him when we bring accusations
[1:19:46] against each other against the pastor
[1:19:48] against the congregation
[1:19:51] even michael himself didn't bring an
[1:19:52] accusation against satan
[1:19:55] he was careful
[1:19:58] and how much less should we do it
[1:20:00] against each other
[1:20:04] but these speak evil of those which they
[1:20:06] do not know
[1:20:08] which they know not
[1:20:09] but what they know naturally as brute
[1:20:12] beasts in those things they corrupt
[1:20:14] themselves
[1:20:18] they don't understand the whole story
[1:20:21] you know they may they may see just on
[1:20:23] the surface and it looks bad so then
[1:20:25] they go and run it down
[1:20:27] they say things as as our brother daniel
[1:20:29] here that squirts the other two but you
[1:20:31] can't get that back
[1:20:32] even when you realize you're wrong you
[1:20:34] can't get those words back
[1:20:39] these are spots
[1:20:44] there we go
[1:20:45] these are spots in your feasts of
[1:20:47] charity when they feast with you feeding
[1:20:49] themselves without fear
[1:20:51] clouds they are without water carried
[1:20:54] about with winds
[1:20:56] trees whose fruit wherewith
[1:20:59] without fruit twice dead and plucked up
[1:21:01] by the roots
[1:21:02] raging waves of the sea foaming out
[1:21:05] their own shame wandering stars to whom
[1:21:07] has reserved the blackness of darkness
[1:21:10] forever
[1:21:11] and enoch also the seventh from adam
[1:21:13] prophesied of these
[1:21:15] saying behold the lord cometh with ten
[1:21:17] thousand of his saints to execute
[1:21:19] judgment upon all and convince all that
[1:21:21] are ungodly among
[1:21:23] all among
[1:21:25] among them of all their ungodly deeds
[1:21:28] which they have ungodly committed and
[1:21:30] their hard speeches which ungodly
[1:21:32] sinners have spoken against them
[1:21:35] jude again is telling us to watch our
[1:21:38] tongue ephesians chapter 4
[1:21:40] verse 29
[1:21:43] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:21:45] of your mouth
[1:21:47] but that
[1:21:48] which is good to the use of edifying
[1:21:51] that it may minister grace unto the
[1:21:53] hearers again we cannot put the
[1:21:55] toothpaste back in the tube
[1:21:58] and grieve not the holy spirit
[1:22:01] whereby you're sealed until the day
[1:22:04] of redemption let all bitterness and
[1:22:06] wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:22:08] speaking be put away from you with all
[1:22:10] malice and be kind
[1:22:12] one another to one another tenderhearted
[1:22:14] forgiving one another even as god
[1:22:18] for christ's sake has forgiven you
[1:22:22] what's sweetness that we should have
[1:22:24] i um
[1:22:26] i know that that we're going through a
[1:22:28] time in the church
[1:22:30] and going through it for some time and
[1:22:31] it's kind of building up
[1:22:34] to to to ahead
[1:22:36] and i wanted to give
[1:22:38] a testimony of some of the experiences
[1:22:40] that i've had one experience in
[1:22:42] particular
[1:22:43] is
[1:22:44] um
[1:22:45] i don't know 20 2015 or whatever it was
[1:22:48] there was an incredible turmoil in
[1:22:51] jeffersonville
[1:22:53] at the branham tabernacle
[1:22:55] and
[1:22:57] we would be in church
[1:23:00] and the church started filling up there
[1:23:02] were things going on there was there was
[1:23:04] fighting among the people there was
[1:23:06] there was fighting with the pastor with
[1:23:08] with the brand of tabernacle with voice
[1:23:09] of god recordings there was there was
[1:23:11] strife so where we were all sitting in
[1:23:13] the in the church listening to a tape
[1:23:15] we're all tape people were part of that
[1:23:17] denomination and we were listening and
[1:23:19] as brother branham would say something
[1:23:22] if it agreed with what you thought about
[1:23:24] the church
[1:23:25] amen
[1:23:27] and then over here
[1:23:29] brother branham would say something we
[1:23:30] agreed with this side amen it became an
[1:23:32] amen battle between the two with brother
[1:23:35] branham's words i know it's ridiculous
[1:23:36] but it happened
[1:23:40] and it can happen here
[1:23:41] we need to be careful
[1:23:44] so then the fighting continued
[1:23:48] and i saw and friends
[1:23:51] my wife can testify that i was sick
[1:23:54] this was a miserable time this was a
[1:23:57] miserable time for all of us
[1:24:00] with the fighting and the lack of love
[1:24:02] and the lack of understanding and saying
[1:24:05] things as i said saying things against
[1:24:07] people that have a representative up
[1:24:08] there
[1:24:09] one of god's children
[1:24:11] on both sides
[1:24:13] doing that
[1:24:15] it got to the point where the um
[1:24:19] the pastor
[1:24:23] saw that things were going to change so
[1:24:25] what do you do is took the vote out of
[1:24:26] the hands of the people
[1:24:28] we're not going to vote anymore because
[1:24:30] there's going to be some changes
[1:24:31] and he didn't say that but he said well
[1:24:33] you know i found in this quote over here
[1:24:35] that that maybe we shouldn't vote oh man
[1:24:38] this half oh you know it was really bad
[1:24:41] you know in this half just kind of okay
[1:24:43] you know it's that's good it's it's it's
[1:24:45] from brother branham
[1:24:47] and
[1:24:49] it just got to be really confusing
[1:24:52] it was it was a really hard time
[1:24:55] for all of us and the fighting that went
[1:24:57] on
[1:24:59] and eventually it
[1:25:01] kind of got resolved but not really
[1:25:04] there was too many words there was too
[1:25:05] much toothpaste that squirted out that
[1:25:07] tube
[1:25:09] and
[1:25:09] it hurt people
[1:25:11] and there was no love let me tell you
[1:25:13] this there was no love associated with
[1:25:14] those problems
[1:25:16] it was a miserable miserable time i was
[1:25:19] i was absolutely disgusted i saw how
[1:25:21] people would use somebody that maybe had
[1:25:23] a bigger mouth
[1:25:25] than than some of the other people
[1:25:27] yeah and you know that's what happens
[1:25:29] and you tell oh you tell this person
[1:25:31] well here's what we're going to do we're
[1:25:32] all going to write a letter you know and
[1:25:33] everybody send their letters in
[1:25:36] so then you have this half and they all
[1:25:38] send their letters in okay and you have
[1:25:40] all these letters and then you have all
[1:25:42] the letters and they take the letters
[1:25:43] they didn't even open they threw it
[1:25:44] right in the garbage didn't care what
[1:25:46] the people said
[1:25:48] and it was just it was a fight
[1:25:50] it was a fight everybody
[1:25:53] had one side or the other and you were
[1:25:55] forced to choose
[1:25:58] and it was i was sick
[1:26:00] i was absolutely sick seeing this
[1:26:04] politics and using different people
[1:26:08] and
[1:26:10] it eventually
[1:26:12] died down
[1:26:15] but uh
[1:26:17] i don't ever want to see something like
[1:26:19] that
[1:26:20] even on a small scale here
[1:26:22] we can't
[1:26:23] friends we are in this together
[1:26:26] and we love each other now we can't we
[1:26:29] can't stop if uh if we do nothing then
[1:26:33] nothing's going to happen
[1:26:35] all right we have to do something we
[1:26:36] have to move forward but we have to move
[1:26:38] forward in the spirit and in love
[1:26:41] i really appreciated our brother bernard
[1:26:44] frank
[1:26:45] the last morning
[1:26:47] i felt like brother bernard had the
[1:26:49] wisdom
[1:26:50] and he came here and as i was listening
[1:26:53] to him
[1:26:55] my mind was on the ministry
[1:26:57] and my mind was on the different offices
[1:27:00] in the ministry
[1:27:01] the pastor and evangelist and the
[1:27:03] teacher
[1:27:04] and i saw brother bernard but bernard's
[1:27:07] a pastor but he was acting
[1:27:09] the other morning as an apostle
[1:27:12] an apostle comes in and he says here's
[1:27:15] what you're doing
[1:27:17] here's what you need to do and here's
[1:27:19] what the word says
[1:27:21] and then
[1:27:23] he leaves it
[1:27:25] and then he goes on his way
[1:27:27] and i saw i was i was so blessed brother
[1:27:30] bernard by the things that you said i
[1:27:32] thought they were done in love and i
[1:27:34] thought they were done in wisdom
[1:27:36] and now we take what he said
[1:27:39] we
[1:27:40] are the sovereign authority here
[1:27:43] whether bernard's not brother bernard
[1:27:45] came in as an apostle and he made his
[1:27:47] suggestions now it's up to us
[1:27:51] what are we going to do
[1:27:52] and the only way that we can accomplish
[1:27:55] things is if we are together in unity
[1:27:59] and love with one another and we're not
[1:28:01] spraying the toothpaste everywhere
[1:28:04] because you can't stick it back in the
[1:28:06] tube
[1:28:07] it's out and it hurts you can repent
[1:28:10] and you can be forgiven but you still
[1:28:11] did it
[1:28:13] and we do not have the ability that god
[1:28:15] has
[1:28:16] and be able to forget it
[1:28:18] it sticks right here
[1:28:21] let's go to galatians
[1:28:28] galatians chapter 2
[1:28:29] verse 11.
[1:28:33] paul speaking
[1:28:35] he had a disagreement with peter
[1:28:38] no they didn't agree on everything
[1:28:40] and you know what it's okay
[1:28:42] am i right brother and we may not agree
[1:28:44] on stuff but that's okay
[1:28:46] if we handle it right
[1:28:48] and we do it in love
[1:28:50] galatians 2 11.
[1:28:53] but when peter was come to antioch i was
[1:28:56] stood under the face because he was to
[1:28:58] be blamed
[1:29:00] for before that certain came from james
[1:29:03] james remember i said he was the pastor
[1:29:05] in jerusalem
[1:29:06] so these brothers are coming from
[1:29:07] jerusalem
[1:29:08] here a certain came from james he did
[1:29:11] eat with the gentiles but when they were
[1:29:13] come he withdrew and separated himself
[1:29:16] fearing them which were of the
[1:29:17] circumcision fearing the jews now he was
[1:29:20] eating with the gentiles he was doing
[1:29:22] something that jews didn't do
[1:29:25] and the other jews disassembled likewise
[1:29:27] with him
[1:29:28] in so much that barnabas also was
[1:29:30] carried away with their dissimilation
[1:29:33] but when i saw that they walked not
[1:29:36] uprightly according to the truth of the
[1:29:37] gospel i said unto peter before them all
[1:29:41] if thou being a jew livest after the
[1:29:43] manner of the gentiles and not as the
[1:29:46] jews why compel us thou the gentiles to
[1:29:48] live as do the
[1:29:50] jews he's saying that these people are
[1:29:53] different
[1:29:54] you know remember what i said we're not
[1:29:55] legalists
[1:29:57] you know we are holiness but we're not
[1:30:00] legalists
[1:30:02] but see what paul paul is our example he
[1:30:04] didn't just roll over
[1:30:06] paul stood up for the word
[1:30:10] and if there's an error in the church
[1:30:12] all right whether it be
[1:30:14] in voting and doctrine or whatever that
[1:30:16] may if you really feel it on your heart
[1:30:19] then you need to address it
[1:30:21] but you need to address it in the right
[1:30:22] way don't squirt the tube of toothpaste
[1:30:24] out
[1:30:25] you go to where it needs to be addressed
[1:30:28] don't cause problems remember do
[1:30:30] everything in love
[1:30:34] no
[1:30:35] paul did that to peter
[1:30:38] now watch how much of a christian peter
[1:30:41] was
[1:30:42] let's turn to second peter
[1:30:44] ii peter
[1:30:51] i feel bad when i read second peter ii
[1:30:53] timothy
[1:30:55] because second peter
[1:30:57] is
[1:30:58] the last words
[1:31:00] of our brother peter
[1:31:02] before he was going to go to the cross
[1:31:04] before he went to the cross and he
[1:31:06] didn't even feel worthy of the lord so
[1:31:08] he said crucify me upside down
[1:31:12] and the words in this book of second
[1:31:14] peter this letter he was about to go to
[1:31:16] the cross
[1:31:18] second timothy paul is writing to
[1:31:20] timothy
[1:31:22] and he was about to go to the guillotine
[1:31:25] he was about to die so he had his
[1:31:26] closing statements in second timothy but
[1:31:28] here in ii peter peter
[1:31:30] peter says this
[1:31:35] and you can see
[1:31:36] he loves the people so much
[1:31:39] peter says this he said wherefore
[1:31:41] beloved
[1:31:43] seeing that you look for such things be
[1:31:46] diligent
[1:31:47] that you may be found of him in peace
[1:31:49] without spot and blameless
[1:31:54] an account
[1:31:57] that the long-suffering of our lord is
[1:31:59] salvation
[1:32:01] even as our beloved brother paul
[1:32:06] also according to the wisdom given unto
[1:32:09] him hath written unto you
[1:32:12] as also in all his epistles speaking in
[1:32:15] them of these things in which
[1:32:18] are some things hard to be understood
[1:32:24] paul's pretty deep he's saying yeah yeah
[1:32:26] paul's
[1:32:27] paul
[1:32:28] man he talks really deep he's sometimes
[1:32:30] he is hard to understand
[1:32:32] but he says this he says
[1:32:34] which they that are unlearned and
[1:32:36] unstable rest that word rest means
[1:32:38] wrestle those unlearned and unstable
[1:32:41] wrestle with what paul said
[1:32:44] as do also the others
[1:32:46] as they do also the other scriptures
[1:32:49] unto their own destruction
[1:32:53] brother wilson peter
[1:32:55] goes to far as far as right here to say
[1:32:59] that paul's words are scripture
[1:33:03] brother lyle the the sadducees or the
[1:33:05] pharisees probably
[1:33:07] swallowed those for lacqueries on there
[1:33:09] the phylacteries are those those things
[1:33:11] those boxes they put on their their
[1:33:13] heads you know
[1:33:15] i guarantee they're like what
[1:33:17] you're calling this brother paul's word
[1:33:18] scripture and this is the brother that
[1:33:20] just rebuked peter
[1:33:22] but look at the christianity in peter
[1:33:25] he's right
[1:33:26] all right
[1:33:28] and then we go on ye therefore beloved
[1:33:32] seeing ye know these things before
[1:33:35] beware lest ye also being led away with
[1:33:38] the heir of the wicked fall from your
[1:33:39] own steadfastness
[1:33:41] but grow in grace and in the knowledge
[1:33:43] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[1:33:46] to him
[1:33:47] be glory both now and forever
[1:33:51] amen peter didn't hold any grudges
[1:33:53] against paul he loved paul
[1:33:55] for that correction
[1:33:58] i'll close with first peter
[1:34:00] chapter 4.
[1:34:05] sister
[1:34:06] sister if you want to come to the piano
[1:34:16] again peter's writing
[1:34:19] he's writing for the people he's not
[1:34:20] writing to promote himself
[1:34:22] he's writing this for the people he says
[1:34:24] this
[1:34:25] but the end of all things is at hand
[1:34:28] be therefore sober and watch under
[1:34:31] prayer
[1:34:32] and above all things have fervent
[1:34:34] charity among yourselves for charity
[1:34:36] shall cover the multitude of sins
[1:34:39] use hospitality one to another without
[1:34:41] grudging
[1:34:43] as every man hath received the gift even
[1:34:46] so minister the same to another
[1:34:48] as good stewards of the manifold grace
[1:34:50] of god
[1:34:51] if any man speak let him speak as the
[1:34:54] oracles of god if any man minister let
[1:34:56] him do it
[1:34:58] as of the ability which god giveth
[1:35:00] that god in all things may be glorified
[1:35:03] through jesus christ
[1:35:05] to him
[1:35:06] to whom be praised in dominion forever
[1:35:08] and ever amen
[1:35:10] beloved
[1:35:11] thinking not strange concerning the
[1:35:13] fiery trial which is to try you as them
[1:35:16] as though some strange thing happened to
[1:35:18] you we can say the same friends here
[1:35:21] don't think it's strange
[1:35:23] because we're in this situation right
[1:35:24] now whatever the situation may be it may
[1:35:26] be
[1:35:27] maybe in this church
[1:35:29] it may be a situation sister amelia that
[1:35:31] you're dealing with your family
[1:35:33] whatever that situation may be don't
[1:35:36] think it's strange that we're there
[1:35:37] brother peter if you want to come up
[1:35:40] don't think it don't think it's strange
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:43] but rejoice
[1:35:45] in as much as you are partakers of
[1:35:47] christ's suffering that when his glory
[1:35:50] shall be
[1:35:51] revealed you may be glad with also with
[1:35:54] exceeding joy
[1:35:55] if
[1:35:56] ye be reproached for the name of christ
[1:35:58] happy are ye
[1:36:00] for the spirit
[1:36:02] of glory and of god resteth upon you
[1:36:05] on their part
[1:36:06] he is evil spoken of but on your part he
[1:36:09] is glorified
[1:36:11] but let none of you
[1:36:13] suffer as a murderer
[1:36:15] or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a
[1:36:18] bitty busybody in other man's matters
[1:36:21] yet if any man suffer as as a christian
[1:36:24] let him not be ashamed but let him
[1:36:26] glorify god on
[1:36:28] on this behalf
[1:36:30] for the time has come that judgment must
[1:36:32] begin at the house of god
