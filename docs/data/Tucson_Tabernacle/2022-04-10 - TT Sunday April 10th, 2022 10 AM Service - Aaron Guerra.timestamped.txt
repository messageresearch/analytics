[39:07] so let us then be
[39:10] true and faithful
[39:12] trusting
[39:14] serving every day
[39:18] just one
[39:20] glimpse of
[39:21] him in glory will the toils of life
[39:26] repay
[39:34] what a day of rejoicing that will be
[39:40] when we all
[39:43] get to please us
[39:46] we'll sing and shout love
[39:49] start with that first verse again
[39:52] then
[39:54] very first verse
[39:57] sing the
[39:58] wondrous love of jesus
[40:05] [Music]
[40:19] [Applause]
[40:21] [Music]
[40:30] when
[40:33] [Music]
[40:43] amen amen
[40:46] i appreciate that and
[40:48] asked brother peter to
[40:50] sing that song
[40:52] and he goes someone sent that to me
[40:54] already today i said yeah it was
[40:56] probably elizabeth
[40:57] because as we got on the car coming
[41:00] that was a song that came on and said we
[41:02] haven't sung that song in a long time
[41:04] and i said well that will go real good
[41:06] with a message today
[41:08] so i thank the lord for that and then
[41:10] brother peter says talk about those
[41:11] witnesses
[41:13] i said well thank you lord because
[41:14] you're confirming
[41:16] what's on our heart and i appreciate
[41:17] that with the lord
[41:19] thank you appreciate that
[41:22] and talking with brother ed and the
[41:24] memorial for our sister joyce and
[41:26] brother peter made that statement
[41:28] the rejoicing that's going on up there
[41:31] the happiness
[41:33] but there's a pull a draw to us
[41:36] come on keep coming don't give up now
[41:39] and that's that's
[41:40] that's god's love and his mercy that's
[41:42] drawing to us
[41:44] we would not respond or we wouldn't even
[41:46] know what to respond to
[41:48] we begin drawing in so many different
[41:50] ways so many different things
[41:52] but god has placed a seed
[41:56] as a part of him in you and that's
[41:57] what's responding back to that
[42:00] and learning to put everything else in
[42:02] subjection to that
[42:04] and that sometimes is our battle so
[42:06] let's pray lord we thank you this
[42:08] morning
[42:11] the week lord the weekend before
[42:15] resurrection sunday lord
[42:18] father you had had set your eyes towards
[42:21] jerusalem
[42:24] for the joy that was set before you
[42:28] lord it didn't look like a joyous
[42:30] occasion didn't look like anything that
[42:32] anybody would ever want to go through
[42:36] but lord you knew what that
[42:37] accomplishment what that would do
[42:40] lord to restore the fellowship that you
[42:42] had with your children at one time lord
[42:45] father we appreciate that this morning
[42:48] just want to talk about that lord and we
[42:50] want to
[42:51] let you have your own way lord let every
[42:54] heart rejoice in the fact
[42:56] that they're
[42:57] part of that body of christ today lord
[42:59] one of them i'm so glad that i can say
[43:02] i'm one of them lord
[43:04] we thank you for that in jesus christ's
[43:06] name
[43:07] amen
[43:09] while you're standing let's just read
[43:10] the first scripture there
[43:16] in hebrews
[43:19] chapter 11 we'll read verses 39 and 40
[43:22] and then hebrews 12
[43:24] 1 and two
[43:28] and these all having obtained a good
[43:30] report through faith receive not the
[43:33] promise
[43:34] god having provided some better thing
[43:37] for us
[43:38] that they without us should not be
[43:41] made perfect
[43:43] then hebrews 12 1-2
[43:45] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[43:48] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[43:51] let us lay aside every weight and the
[43:53] sin which doth easily beset us
[43:56] and let us run with patience the race
[43:59] that is set before us
[44:01] looking unto jesus the author and
[44:03] finisher of our faith
[44:05] for who the joy that was set before him
[44:08] endured the cross despising the shame
[44:11] and is set down at the right hand of god
[44:14] right hand of the throne of god
[44:16] amen you may be seated
[44:20] i don't know how many of us
[44:22] could say
[44:25] the suffering and the
[44:27] the pain and the humiliation and
[44:31] all the words that would describe that
[44:33] we would say we're looking forward to it
[44:37] i don't know that any of us get up in
[44:39] the morning and and say
[44:41] boy i hope this is a troublesome day
[44:43] i hope nothing goes right
[44:45] i hope everybody makes a face at me
[44:48] you know if you wear a beard i hope
[44:50] somebody plucks my beard
[44:51] no i don't think anybody's up there
[44:54] but him for the joy that was set before
[44:56] him
[44:57] he willingly went
[45:00] and because of that you're here today
[45:02] and i'm here today so
[45:05] in a message time tested memorials of
[45:07] god
[45:10] brother branham says
[45:12] something here how god tests his church
[45:14] how he
[45:16] he does this church he says
[45:19] that's the way god does his church he
[45:21] gives you trial after trial
[45:25] and we need to learn to say thank you
[45:27] lord because you know what's best for me
[45:31] where would we be if we could get our
[45:33] own way for everything
[45:35] it wouldn't be good i know that
[45:38] trial after trial
[45:40] test after test trial after trial test
[45:42] after test
[45:43] until the life of christ is reflected in
[45:46] your life
[45:48] until you become peaceful sober meek
[45:51] gentle humble
[45:53] ready submissive
[45:55] willing to turn your head on things of
[45:57] the world and looking straight to
[45:59] calvary
[46:00] to the one who is doing the beating
[46:05] now that's sometimes hard
[46:08] when we think about that we will say you
[46:10] know
[46:11] sometimes with the girls we talk about
[46:12] it sometimes with my brothers we talk
[46:14] about it
[46:15] when dad or mom you know
[46:18] had to do something to straighten us out
[46:21] and
[46:22] i was reading part of a message last
[46:24] night
[46:26] and brother branham talked about that
[46:27] child playing in the street
[46:30] little johnny says playing in the street
[46:32] there and cars are going back and forth
[46:33] and you would say now johnny get out of
[46:35] the street you shouldn't be there
[46:37] he said you really don't love that child
[46:41] he said if you really love that child
[46:42] you'd go over there and you'd get that
[46:44] child out of there and you'd take them
[46:45] back and you'd teach them a lesson about
[46:47] it
[46:48] that's what he's doing here
[46:50] because he loves us
[46:52] and sometimes the love
[46:54] that we might take love and we'll put it
[46:57] real soft and easy and love has its soft
[46:59] easy place
[47:00] the forgiving part
[47:02] the one that you've done it once twice
[47:04] three times and they still say i forgive
[47:06] you
[47:07] let's go at it again but sometimes
[47:09] there's this side of it he says
[47:11] willing to turn your head on things of
[47:12] the world looking straight to calvary to
[47:14] the one who is doing the beating
[47:16] many times you think it's strange
[47:19] because fiery trials sickness and
[47:21] persecutions
[47:22] it's only done to test you
[47:25] to get the dirt out of you to get the
[47:27] sludge out of you
[47:28] to get the slowness out of you to wake
[47:31] you up to the place where you can look
[47:33] and see the reflection or a man can see
[47:36] the reflection of christ in you
[47:39] christ in you
[47:41] the hope of glory
[47:43] and that's god's purpose
[47:46] so others can see christ in you
[47:50] but not only though others can see
[47:51] christ and you can recognize it's christ
[47:53] in you also
[47:55] coming to that recognition in your own
[47:58] life
[47:59] that is christ in me
[48:02] and and to think about those heavenly
[48:04] witnesses
[48:06] those that have gone on before us
[48:09] from the very beginning
[48:11] all the way through today who have
[48:12] already gone on before us
[48:14] they come the same way you and i are
[48:16] coming
[48:18] there's no special treatment for sums
[48:20] and well this one needs more testing no
[48:22] everyone had the test that god put them
[48:25] through now there's one that that we we
[48:27] read about in the scriptures we hear
[48:29] about and it says enoch walked with god
[48:32] and was seen not
[48:35] the the bible talks about 365 years
[48:38] approximately his lifetime on earth
[48:41] if i remember correctly
[48:42] but all it says is he walked with god
[48:46] but if you and i would have been around
[48:48] part of enoch's life we would have seen
[48:49] his testing
[48:50] his trials the times that he would go
[48:53] through
[48:54] but he walked with god
[48:56] brother dan evans spoke that on
[48:58] wednesday night over with brother osorio
[49:00] i watched the the service it was
[49:02] excellent just a great thought walking
[49:05] with god
[49:08] you're going to walk
[49:10] you're going to walk with someone
[49:11] somewhere
[49:13] you're going to follow somebody's
[49:14] leading why not walk with god
[49:18] the end result of walking with god is
[49:20] the best result that there is
[49:23] it's pretty simple that when you look at
[49:24] it that way and don't make it any more
[49:26] complicated than that
[49:28] but walking with god and he tests you he
[49:30] tries you
[49:32] because he has a purpose for you
[49:35] now i want to read one more quote this
[49:37] one's a little lengthy
[49:40] but
[49:41] from beyond the curtain of time
[49:45] and brother branham had been laying
[49:47] there he says
[49:49] and thinking about the other side
[49:52] and how many of us have done that before
[49:54] what a day that will be when we all get
[49:57] to heaven you know and you begin to
[49:59] think what is it like in in
[50:02] in our best imagination and our best
[50:04] thought process going back to the
[50:05] scriptures what other people have have
[50:07] testified
[50:08] we we try to draw an image to ourselves
[50:12] and and and i know sometimes i'll get
[50:14] real happy doing that just to think
[50:16] about the joy
[50:18] to think about the peace that's there to
[50:20] think of of the comfort that's there and
[50:22] then sometimes and you start thinking
[50:24] about things that won't be there
[50:27] and boy sometimes that gets even better
[50:29] i won't have to deal with that more i
[50:31] won't have that problem with myself
[50:32] anymore we won't have you know it's all
[50:34] part of that
[50:36] but to see jesus
[50:38] that's a great brother brandon on this
[50:40] quote you he asked where is he i want to
[50:42] see him
[50:44] then the voice spoke to me
[50:46] this is what
[50:48] is that where i started it at yeah
[50:51] then the voice spoke to me brother brahm
[50:53] had been asking and he gets to go over
[50:55] to the other side this is what you
[50:56] preach that the holy ghost is
[50:59] this is perfect love
[51:01] nothing can enter here without it
[51:05] can you imagine being in a place where
[51:07] that's all there is perfect love
[51:10] it's it's hard to imagine because your
[51:13] thoughts go back to the situation and
[51:15] things going on around you issues you
[51:17] have and it gets in the way of that
[51:19] but he said that's the only thing that
[51:22] can in here is perfectly
[51:24] next i was taken up and seated on a high
[51:26] place all around me were great numbers
[51:29] of men and women in the bloom of youth
[51:34] brother tony sent me a text late
[51:36] yesterday evening
[51:38] i actually was probably last night and
[51:40] he said brother aaron i'm still hurting
[51:43] i may have broke my ribs or something
[51:44] i'm still hurting would you pray for me
[51:47] so myself and my wife we prayed for him
[51:50] then
[51:52] and and just asked god to relieve the
[51:53] pain god it would cause the healing to
[51:55] take place
[51:58] but tomorrow
[51:59] something else might happen
[52:01] you're healed of this but tomorrow you
[52:03] face something else
[52:05] but he says they're on here they're
[52:07] in in the bloom of youth and they were
[52:09] crying with joy oh our precious brother
[52:12] we are so happy to see you here
[52:18] if you think you're going to be happy
[52:19] going over there they're anticipating
[52:22] awaiting the whole family of god
[52:25] there's something that's drawing there's
[52:26] something that's pulling there's
[52:28] something that says hey that's there's
[52:29] still a part of us missing
[52:32] you know and and so he says
[52:35] i i thought i'm not thought i'm dreaming
[52:38] for i can see these people and i can see
[52:40] my body lying back there on the bed
[52:44] it's between those two atmospheres
[52:45] there's two spheres right there the
[52:47] voice spoke to me you know it is written
[52:50] in the bible
[52:51] that the prophets were gathered with
[52:53] their people
[52:54] and i said yes i remember that in the
[52:56] scriptures
[52:57] but there are not this many branhams
[53:01] he said my family millions of branhams
[53:03] up here
[53:04] that was it he says the voice says these
[53:07] are not branhams they are your converts
[53:09] the ones that you have led to the lord
[53:12] some of these women that you think are
[53:14] so young and beautiful were more than 90
[53:16] years old when you led them to the lord
[53:18] and i liked the thought from there
[53:21] they were over 90 years old and god
[53:23] still called them in
[53:26] sometimes we think well if they don't
[53:27] come to god now they'll never have a
[53:29] chance
[53:31] how do you know that
[53:33] thief on the cross
[53:35] we would have condemned right with
[53:37] everybody else was condemning him but at
[53:38] the last moment he turns and looks over
[53:40] jesus and says remember me and he just
[53:43] turn around say this day
[53:45] you'll be with me in paradise
[53:47] so think of that somebody said they're
[53:50] we're over 90 years old when you led
[53:52] them to the lord no wonder they are
[53:53] crying out my precious brother
[53:56] then the multitude cried together if you
[53:58] had not gone forth with the gospel
[54:01] we wouldn't be here
[54:04] blessed is the feet of those that carry
[54:06] the good news
[54:08] to every part
[54:10] of this world of every language nation
[54:13] tribe tongue people whoever they are
[54:16] they get to hear the voice of god
[54:18] through the word of god speak to them
[54:20] and their heart responds
[54:23] oh what a day that is isn't it
[54:26] it says
[54:29] and then he says
[54:31] oh
[54:31] where is jesus i want to see him
[54:36] the people replied he's just a little
[54:38] higher someday he will come to you you
[54:40] are sent as a leader and when god comes
[54:42] he will judge you according to your
[54:44] teaching and this is where where i want
[54:46] to base this off i ask does paul and
[54:48] peter have to stand this judgment also
[54:52] the answer was yes
[54:54] i said i have preached what they preach
[54:56] i did not divert from it from one side
[54:59] or the other
[55:02] were they baptized in the name of jesus
[55:04] i did too where they taught the baptism
[55:06] in the holy ghost holy spirit i did too
[55:09] whatever they taught i taught also
[55:13] and then the people said we know that
[55:16] the people cried and we know that we are
[55:18] going back to earth with you sometime
[55:21] jesus will come and judge you according
[55:23] to the word you preached us then you
[55:25] will present us to him and all together
[55:28] we will go back to earth to live forever
[55:33] we are confident we're confining we're
[55:35] placed all of that that you preached to
[55:37] us the very gospel that paul preached
[55:40] it didn't change
[55:44] and today we're confident the exact same
[55:46] thing jesus christ the same yesterday
[55:49] today and forever
[55:53] and then they said then i said do i have
[55:54] to go back to earth now they answered
[55:57] yes but keep pressing on
[55:59] as i began to move from the beautiful
[56:01] joyful place as far as my eye could see
[56:03] people were coming towards me to embrace
[56:05] me crying my precious brother
[56:08] suddenly i was back on the bed again i
[56:10] said oh god help me
[56:12] never let me compromise with the word
[56:15] let me stay straight on the word i don't
[56:18] care what anyone else does lord let me
[56:20] press onto that beautiful joyful place
[56:24] i am more convinced than ever in my life
[56:27] that it will take perfect love to enter
[56:29] that place
[56:30] there was no jealousy no tiredness no
[56:33] sickness no old age no death only
[56:37] supreme beauty and joy
[56:39] then he tells us whatever you do
[56:42] lay aside everything else until you get
[56:44] perfect love
[56:45] get to where you can love everybody
[56:48] even every enemy no matter if the plane
[56:50] is rocking the lightning is flashing or
[56:53] the guns of the enemy are upon you
[56:55] these things do not matter get perfect
[56:58] love
[57:01] that's what it takes to get in there
[57:04] but what or could i say who is perfect
[57:06] love
[57:09] it's the lord jesus christ it's him
[57:12] so what he's telling you is make sure
[57:14] you have him in you
[57:17] it's not something you carry in a bag
[57:19] it's not something on this side it's
[57:21] christ in you the hope of glory
[57:24] and that's perfect love but to hear him
[57:26] say
[57:27] ah
[57:29] say
[57:30] if paul is going to be and peter and all
[57:31] of them are going to be judged by the
[57:33] word of god and that's how they then i'm
[57:35] doing the exact same thing
[57:37] and the people said we're
[57:39] we're believing on that
[57:41] we've placed that we have heard the same
[57:43] word
[57:44] given to us therefore we get the same
[57:46] results
[57:51] so we'll look at some scriptures here
[57:58] we just read there in hebrews and that's
[58:01] seen that great cloud of witnesses
[58:05] a great cloud
[58:07] not just a handful
[58:09] a great cloud
[58:10] and i don't know when you think great i
[58:12] don't limit to it just to a small number
[58:14] a thousand used to be a lot
[58:17] a million used to be a lot
[58:20] thinking way back when we were kids boy
[58:22] if we could if we ever get to a million
[58:23] we'll be rich
[58:26] and you look today for houses that are
[58:28] selling for over a million dollars
[58:31] and probably only worth a third of that
[58:33] in reality
[58:34] but the value has been raised so high
[58:38] and you say wow
[58:39] a million dollars would take all that i
[58:41] have to buy that one house
[58:44] and here it is it's it's a great
[58:47] multitude
[58:48] of people
[58:50] saying it's worth every bit of it
[58:54] and they're looking over the banister
[58:56] right because they say come on brother
[58:57] come on sister
[58:59] keep pressing on don't give up now
[59:02] over the last couple years
[59:05] now it's been a few years that we've
[59:07] lost some of our
[59:08] members of this church that have gone
[59:10] out no they've crossed over to the other
[59:12] side
[59:13] added more to that witness on that side
[59:17] part of us would say yes we'd love to
[59:18] have him back here in fellowship with
[59:20] but a part of me says no
[59:22] no let me go over there instead
[59:25] you know leaving this life behind and
[59:28] you might say but i have unsafe children
[59:30] i have unsaved loved ones
[59:33] yes but commit them to god
[59:36] don't give up on them now
[59:38] i remind myself over and over when i
[59:40] think it's just it seems impossible
[59:42] they seem so far away from god they seem
[59:44] to turn the other way
[59:46] but i remind myself of that thief on the
[59:48] cross
[59:49] who was hanging there who was crucified
[59:51] next to my lord and savior and he asked
[59:53] for mercy at the last second and he got
[59:55] it
[59:57] and i'm not going to stand there before
[59:59] him
[1:00:00] and say lord i deserve heaven a whole
[1:00:02] lot more than he does because i served
[1:00:05] you a whole lot longer than i did better
[1:00:08] no
[1:00:09] it's the same grace
[1:00:11] the 11th hour
[1:00:13] worker gets the same pay as that first
[1:00:15] hour worker
[1:00:17] and there'll be no jealousy on that side
[1:00:19] none at all
[1:00:21] a great cloud of witnesses
[1:00:24] therefore let us lay aside every weight
[1:00:27] and the sin the unbelief the things that
[1:00:29] trouble us which it does so easily beset
[1:00:32] us
[1:00:33] paul said seems like it paul speaking by
[1:00:35] experience if you go back and read his
[1:00:36] scriptures where he said paul says when
[1:00:38] i find myself wanting to do this i find
[1:00:41] myself doing this instead
[1:00:43] we all went through it
[1:00:45] and this is where the thought came in
[1:00:47] prayer when we had the three nights of
[1:00:49] prayer here
[1:00:50] saturday night to begin to think about
[1:00:52] those heavenly witnesses what would they
[1:00:54] say to us come on come on
[1:00:57] and i felt the lord just spoke to me and
[1:00:59] said but every one of them came the same
[1:01:01] way you're coming
[1:01:04] they got no special favors
[1:01:07] they didn't say well if you do this
[1:01:08] you'll get a head no
[1:01:10] they came through the shed blood of a
[1:01:12] sacrifice
[1:01:14] now i rise the old testament saints came
[1:01:17] under a sacrifice that was type of the
[1:01:19] perfect sacrifice
[1:01:21] but they were allowed in they were
[1:01:23] brought in
[1:01:24] when jesus comes on and that early that
[1:01:26] morning that he goes and he opens the
[1:01:28] gate there of paradise the door says
[1:01:30] come on
[1:01:32] brother branham describes it he goes
[1:01:34] sarah abraham sarah sir remember we were
[1:01:36] looking for that city that's him
[1:01:38] and began to be identified the very
[1:01:40] things that we're looking for they're
[1:01:41] identifying the same things
[1:01:44] and they come in the exact same way they
[1:01:47] were not better than us
[1:01:49] they were not worse than us they were
[1:01:51] humans like you and i
[1:01:53] they were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:01:56] came to this world speaking lies
[1:01:59] and if you don't believe that go read
[1:02:02] adam and eve when they fell
[1:02:04] it's her fault it's his fault she said
[1:02:06] it so i did it and that started right
[1:02:08] there
[1:02:10] and god says i'll have to take the life
[1:02:12] of an innocent one
[1:02:15] and i'll take the life of it and take
[1:02:16] the blood from that one and i and the
[1:02:19] covering from that and i will cover you
[1:02:22] speaking of a perfect lamb of god that
[1:02:24] would come
[1:02:27] he says
[1:02:29] looking unto jesus
[1:02:31] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:02:36] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:02:38] endured the cross
[1:02:41] despising the shame
[1:02:43] and has set down at the right hand
[1:02:45] of the throne of god
[1:02:48] for the joy that was set before him
[1:02:52] i could name that joy right now
[1:02:55] eddie
[1:02:56] you were that joy sister angela you were
[1:02:58] that joy sister all the way down to the
[1:03:00] very back all the way up that side you
[1:03:03] were the joy that was set before him so
[1:03:05] he said i will go
[1:03:09] but i'm not worthy neither am i
[1:03:12] none of us were worthy of it
[1:03:14] but he chose to do it
[1:03:17] and i'm not going to stand up and argue
[1:03:18] with him and say why i want to say thank
[1:03:20] you lord
[1:03:22] i'm going to appreciate it
[1:03:24] you know that's the hard part of
[1:03:25] receiving a gift
[1:03:27] receiving
[1:03:28] grace because as soon as you receive a
[1:03:31] gift you feel i owe one back now
[1:03:35] a gift is a gift it's hard to receive a
[1:03:38] gift without filling now i owe
[1:03:43] are you with me is that true
[1:03:45] you feel obligated
[1:03:47] but he chose to do it for you
[1:03:49] all he asks for you to do is receive it
[1:03:52] and that's hard for us sometimes but for
[1:03:54] the joy that was set before him
[1:03:58] he's the author and the finisher of our
[1:04:01] faith
[1:04:02] i like that the one that gave you the
[1:04:04] faith will also finish the faith
[1:04:06] he didn't say here's the bag full of
[1:04:08] faith and i'll go see what you do with
[1:04:09] it
[1:04:10] he said no i'm the author i placed it in
[1:04:13] you and i will finish it i will bring it
[1:04:15] to its perfection
[1:04:17] amen
[1:04:19] now we'll go to the old testament and
[1:04:21] read a little bit about
[1:04:23] jehovah god here
[1:04:25] isaiah 43
[1:04:30] i was looking for something i remember
[1:04:32] and this scripture came up i began to
[1:04:34] read it
[1:04:36] verses 9 to 13.
[1:04:40] let all the nations be gathered together
[1:04:42] and let the people be assembled
[1:04:45] who among them can declare this
[1:04:48] and show us the former things
[1:04:50] let them bring forth their witnesses
[1:04:52] that they may be justified or let them
[1:04:55] hear and say
[1:04:56] it is truth god puts a challenge out
[1:05:00] he said things i'm i'm showing you
[1:05:02] things that i mean he's doing this
[1:05:04] through the in the book of isaiah
[1:05:05] he goes let all the other nations gather
[1:05:09] and show that they can do the same thing
[1:05:12] he says
[1:05:14] but then he says to them ye are my
[1:05:16] witnesses
[1:05:18] saith the lord and my servant whom i
[1:05:20] have chosen that ye may know and believe
[1:05:22] me and understand that i am he and i
[1:05:26] like this before me there was no god
[1:05:29] formed neither shall there be after me
[1:05:33] he is the only one that can stay say
[1:05:36] that and not be conceited and be
[1:05:38] self-puffed up because he is who he is
[1:05:41] he is the great i am the eternal one
[1:05:44] and he can say that
[1:05:47] but you know
[1:05:48] because of jesus christ
[1:05:50] and what we've got to know him through
[1:05:52] the scriptures and because he dwells in
[1:05:55] you know and you know that personally
[1:05:57] he's alive
[1:05:59] he was the most humble that there was
[1:06:01] yet he could say there shall be no other
[1:06:04] god before me
[1:06:06] that can do this
[1:06:08] and be honest about and be true about it
[1:06:11] let's go on verse 11
[1:06:14] i even i am the lord and beside me there
[1:06:18] is no savior
[1:06:20] this was the old testament
[1:06:23] before he was slain
[1:06:25] before he shed his blood but he said
[1:06:27] there is no other savior but me he says
[1:06:30] i have declared and have saved i have
[1:06:33] showed when there was when there was no
[1:06:36] strange god among you
[1:06:39] now he's referring to something some of
[1:06:41] you have gone in a different direction
[1:06:43] are looking for something different
[1:06:45] but he said i declared this i said when
[1:06:47] there was no strange god among you
[1:06:49] therefore ye are my witnesses saith the
[1:06:52] lord that i am god
[1:06:56] who
[1:06:58] broke the uh dried up the sea and made a
[1:07:00] way for them to cross
[1:07:03] who said pharaoh let my people go
[1:07:06] and he did
[1:07:09] who said these things when he talks to
[1:07:10] job go read from jobs job chapter 38
[1:07:14] job tell me
[1:07:17] he says this is who i am
[1:07:19] i caused this to happen
[1:07:22] this is a god we're speaking of
[1:07:25] he says yea before the day was i am he
[1:07:29] the self-existing the eternal one
[1:07:33] and there is none that can deliver out
[1:07:35] of my hand
[1:07:37] i will work and who shall let it
[1:07:40] be
[1:07:42] who shall let it be
[1:07:46] she a since a day was i am he and there
[1:07:49] is none that can deliver out of my hand
[1:07:51] i will work
[1:07:53] and who can reverse it
[1:07:57] who can take what god has done and say
[1:07:59] no that's not good enough i want i'm
[1:08:01] going to do it differently god said what
[1:08:03] i have purpose it will be
[1:08:06] and because he's seen you already on the
[1:08:08] other side
[1:08:10] you will be there
[1:08:12] either even though sometimes it seems
[1:08:14] like boy i'm having to battle this i'm
[1:08:16] having to go through such a hard time
[1:08:18] i'm going through trial after trial and
[1:08:20] test after test
[1:08:23] listen to this part here rejoice in that
[1:08:28] because if you weren't being tested and
[1:08:29] if you weren't being tried and
[1:08:31] everything was going easy you better
[1:08:33] find out why
[1:08:38] now
[1:08:39] be careful don't bring the test on
[1:08:40] yourself
[1:08:42] let god
[1:08:44] bring the testing
[1:08:46] sometimes we're tried or we get into
[1:08:48] trouble for ourselves
[1:08:50] you know and and it's just kind of funny
[1:08:52] sometimes how
[1:08:54] we can do the same thing over a few
[1:08:55] times before we learn
[1:08:59] you know i i went out and bought a
[1:09:01] ladder with a much wider step
[1:09:03] because it's a lot more solid than a
[1:09:05] ladder with an arrow step
[1:09:07] with 20 years ago wasn't a problem but
[1:09:09] today it's a lot more be a whole lot
[1:09:11] more careful
[1:09:13] as you go up you hold on to more you pay
[1:09:15] more attention you look down and see
[1:09:16] worse and why because you've fallen down
[1:09:18] a few times
[1:09:19] you've hurt yourself before
[1:09:22] and you begin to learn from those things
[1:09:24] and
[1:09:25] some of you learn faster than i do
[1:09:27] probably but we all learn
[1:09:29] and i thank the lord for that
[1:09:32] he says and who can reverse it
[1:09:37] let me tell you this brother sister you
[1:09:38] can't reverse it
[1:09:42] you're a child of god
[1:09:44] you've always been a child of god you
[1:09:47] always will be a child of god
[1:09:50] i can say that through the word of god
[1:09:52] not just what i think is good but god
[1:09:54] says those you're mine and none shall
[1:09:56] pluck you out of my hand
[1:09:58] your name is written on the palm of my
[1:10:00] hand and therefore nobody can take your
[1:10:02] name from there
[1:10:04] there's a reason to have peace
[1:10:07] and have joy today
[1:10:09] but i'm being tested it just shows you
[1:10:11] that god is mindful of you
[1:10:13] it just shows you that god is mindful of
[1:10:15] you
[1:10:17] colossians 1
[1:10:18] verses 26 and 27
[1:10:23] even the mystery which has been hid from
[1:10:25] the ages and from generations
[1:10:27] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:10:31] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:10:33] riches of the glory of of this mystery
[1:10:36] among the gentiles which is christ in
[1:10:39] you
[1:10:40] the hope of glory
[1:10:43] without him there is no hope
[1:10:45] oh you can have a hope but there's
[1:10:47] nothing
[1:10:48] to that hope there's no reality to the
[1:10:50] end of that hope
[1:10:52] you know in today's world and
[1:10:54] you you see the news and with all that's
[1:10:56] happening
[1:10:58] let me just say it this way god is still
[1:11:00] in control
[1:11:02] nothing is happening today that is
[1:11:04] surprising god
[1:11:05] that he's having to stop back and
[1:11:06] rewrite the book and go back i was
[1:11:08] talking with brother lyle the other day
[1:11:10] and i've mentioned it here before
[1:11:13] when they were just working on the
[1:11:14] atomic bomb
[1:11:16] and and and how to come that and and
[1:11:20] today
[1:11:22] the
[1:11:23] computer chip and this phone right here
[1:11:27] is how many times bigger than what they
[1:11:29] were using brother lyle
[1:11:32] a lot
[1:11:33] see the pictures of computers from the
[1:11:35] 50s they're bigger than
[1:11:37] than a
[1:11:38] refrigerator and they did they had so
[1:11:41] little that they could do in comparison
[1:11:45] well they had it on on blackboards as
[1:11:47] big as that space there
[1:11:49] between those two columns
[1:11:51] three of them with equations written
[1:11:53] from one end to the other
[1:11:56] and and i don't remember which scientist
[1:11:57] but he's sitting on a chair looking at
[1:11:59] it because the answer at the end wasn't
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:03] and he goes back from the beginning if i
[1:12:04] remember right in in the description
[1:12:06] there are three days
[1:12:08] he read that equation over and over and
[1:12:11] over because it wasn't coming out to
[1:12:13] what it was supposed to be
[1:12:16] and then ah
[1:12:18] he goes up he changes one
[1:12:20] figure one number whatever it was
[1:12:22] and then he goes there it is
[1:12:26] you and i get our phone today
[1:12:28] the answer is right there
[1:12:31] he did that for three days
[1:12:34] and it's an amazing what has happened
[1:12:36] what what happens today
[1:12:39] but there's nothing new under the sun
[1:12:41] solomon said
[1:12:42] see god had it all under control in the
[1:12:44] first place
[1:12:47] here's some of the things see some of
[1:12:48] the things i i like to sometimes get on
[1:12:50] youtube and look at the machinery that
[1:12:52] people use the things that they have
[1:12:54] today the
[1:12:55] the monstrous trucks and i'm talking to
[1:12:57] brother lyle i said what's the biggest
[1:12:58] truck you've ever been on because a
[1:13:00] company had worked for designed the
[1:13:02] control systems and stuff that they did
[1:13:04] and he mentioned the size of the truck
[1:13:06] it's a monster truck
[1:13:09] and the reason for that was to make it
[1:13:11] the most efficient possible
[1:13:14] if you're getting i don't know
[1:13:17] a mile a gallon if that good on a truck
[1:13:19] like that who knows what was it about
[1:13:22] a whole lot less than that
[1:13:24] you know in the mines and especially in
[1:13:26] south america and africa and the huge
[1:13:28] mines
[1:13:29] you want every movement controlled
[1:13:31] no wasted time no two trucks meeting on
[1:13:34] a hill and one has to back down
[1:13:37] this is man's thinking god already had
[1:13:40] it all figured out
[1:13:42] they tapped into the laws of god
[1:13:45] just like it said in the old testament
[1:13:46] who is like me
[1:13:48] there is no other god
[1:13:50] they've looked and searched but i
[1:13:52] already knew what i already had it
[1:13:53] accounted for
[1:13:56] and that hope is in you
[1:14:00] that hope of glory it's more than a hope
[1:14:03] it's a living being it's god himself
[1:14:06] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:14:11] so let me tell you my brother my sister
[1:14:13] you're going to be there
[1:14:16] he will not lose the want
[1:14:20] brother branham or let me let's go back
[1:14:22] to where paul said it
[1:14:24] when the jailer was going to take his
[1:14:26] life
[1:14:28] and paul says don't harm yourself
[1:14:31] god had a reason for this
[1:14:34] what a way
[1:14:36] to go save a jailer and his family
[1:14:40] wouldn't it have been easier to let paul
[1:14:43] go to church that morning
[1:14:45] and send the jailer and his family to
[1:14:47] church
[1:14:48] and paul could have preached to him at
[1:14:49] church
[1:14:51] but no
[1:14:52] he decides to have paul
[1:14:56] and
[1:14:58] just blanked onto his companion's name
[1:15:00] upon silas
[1:15:03] go to jail instead
[1:15:07] i may be willing to say lord if you'll
[1:15:08] send me to jail if that's what it takes
[1:15:10] i'm willing to go
[1:15:14] you raise your hand
[1:15:16] some of you didn't because he might do
[1:15:18] it huh
[1:15:19] but are you willing
[1:15:22] they could have just gone to the to the
[1:15:24] synagogue and paul could have preached
[1:15:26] to them
[1:15:27] but no he sends him to
[1:15:29] but you know there was there was
[1:15:30] something that the jailer heard
[1:15:33] and that was paul and silas worshipping
[1:15:35] the lord
[1:15:37] when their heads were in stocks and
[1:15:38] bonds their feet were in bonds
[1:15:40] and and i always say silas is looking at
[1:15:42] paul and says
[1:15:44] yeah
[1:15:46] did it have to be this way
[1:15:48] what are we doing here paul all the
[1:15:50] testimonies i've heard of your trips
[1:15:52] have been a little different than this
[1:15:56] hundreds were saved the power of god
[1:15:58] came the holy ghost fell but
[1:16:00] i got my head through a stalk of my feet
[1:16:02] there
[1:16:03] and we're down in a dungeon
[1:16:06] and paul says you know there there's a
[1:16:08] trick to this there's there's a way out
[1:16:10] of this
[1:16:11] side let's go what's that
[1:16:13] turn over on your only believe book and
[1:16:15] go to page 27 let's sing now
[1:16:17] psalm
[1:16:18] 35. praise him
[1:16:22] praise him praise him and
[1:16:25] silas is looking and he goes try it
[1:16:27] let's try it
[1:16:28] and silas begins to worship the lord
[1:16:30] with paul
[1:16:32] and after a little while paul and silas
[1:16:33] forgot they were in socks and bonds
[1:16:36] they were beginning to they got into an
[1:16:37] atmosphere that was different
[1:16:39] and an earthquake happens
[1:16:42] god says watch this
[1:16:45] for the salvation of a jailer and his
[1:16:48] family
[1:16:51] you and i would have done it differently
[1:16:54] but god said this is the way i've chosen
[1:16:56] to do it
[1:16:59] he says
[1:17:00] for it's christ in you
[1:17:02] the hope of glory
[1:17:06] now
[1:17:07] it's to you and your household
[1:17:12] again i said it's to you and your
[1:17:13] household
[1:17:15] amen
[1:17:17] not a single one shall be lost
[1:17:24] hebrews 1 verse
[1:17:26] 3.
[1:17:30] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:17:32] and the express image of his person and
[1:17:35] upholding all things by the word of his
[1:17:37] power
[1:17:38] when he had by himself
[1:17:40] purged our sins
[1:17:43] sat down on the right hand
[1:17:45] of the majesty on high
[1:17:50] stomp on that for a little bit when he
[1:17:52] himself
[1:17:54] the same god who in
[1:17:56] isaiah said i am he
[1:17:59] who shall reverse this
[1:18:03] who's going to say it won't work that
[1:18:04] way
[1:18:06] and i like this part when he had done
[1:18:08] these things he went back and he sat
[1:18:11] down if i could say he rested on his
[1:18:14] work
[1:18:16] he didn't go back to the laboratory and
[1:18:18] said now let's prepare a second plan
[1:18:21] another set of laws or another set of
[1:18:23] rules in case this one doesn't work
[1:18:26] no he rested
[1:18:29] and he sat on the right hand of god and
[1:18:31] said it is finished
[1:18:36] so why are you afraid
[1:18:38] why are you nervous why do you worry
[1:18:41] because we all do at times
[1:18:44] he rested on a finished work
[1:18:52] james
[1:18:56] 1 17-18
[1:18:59] every good gift and every perfect gift
[1:19:01] is from above
[1:19:03] and cometh down from the father of light
[1:19:06] with whom is no variableness
[1:19:09] neither shadow of turning
[1:19:12] you and i can figure to do something
[1:19:14] today and tomorrow we
[1:19:16] rearrange it
[1:19:18] we come up with a better plan we come up
[1:19:20] with a better idea or maybe we read and
[1:19:22] get a little more information and then
[1:19:24] we change it
[1:19:26] i know brother lyle is talking someone
[1:19:27] with brother lyle and brother mike
[1:19:29] yarbrough
[1:19:30] it was constant process wasn't it
[1:19:32] constant upgrading you know
[1:19:36] if you work with a job that has anything
[1:19:38] like that it's a constant work
[1:19:41] but there's no shadow of variable
[1:19:42] there's no shadow of turning of his own
[1:19:45] will begat us with the word of truth
[1:19:47] that we should be a kind of first fruits
[1:19:50] of his creatures
[1:19:54] he was the firstfruit and therefore we
[1:19:56] follow
[1:19:58] and that which he does is perfect from
[1:20:00] the beginning
[1:20:02] from the first time
[1:20:03] always
[1:20:06] now we'll get into the book of romans
[1:20:07] here
[1:20:11] just wanted to show something i'm sure
[1:20:13] you've never heard before huh
[1:20:15] now we've heard it time and time and
[1:20:16] time again
[1:20:18] romans 5
[1:20:19] will read verses 1 through 10.
[1:20:23] therefore being justified by faith
[1:20:26] we have peace with god through our lord
[1:20:29] jesus christ
[1:20:30] brother branham says i always thought
[1:20:32] jesus loved me and god hated me
[1:20:36] probably because of the testing and the
[1:20:38] trials and the hardships
[1:20:41] but i find out
[1:20:43] as i've gotten to this age and i look
[1:20:45] back and see the things that my father
[1:20:47] and mother did for me
[1:20:49] with the intent
[1:20:50] of being able for us to grow
[1:20:54] and to be good people if i could say in
[1:20:56] a natural way to have good character
[1:20:59] to be to hold a good job to raise a good
[1:21:02] family
[1:21:03] in the natural that was their purpose
[1:21:07] i don't think dr dobson was around back
[1:21:10] then when we were
[1:21:12] in all these help books and we didn't
[1:21:15] have a tv at home so we didn't see it
[1:21:16] anyways
[1:21:19] um
[1:21:21] but
[1:21:22] the one that is he and always been
[1:21:25] i am he was there too
[1:21:29] and the holy ghost had been given to his
[1:21:31] children
[1:21:33] and that's what guided your parents and
[1:21:35] my parents
[1:21:37] as christians to raise us the way we
[1:21:39] raise
[1:21:41] it was god rich in mercy
[1:21:44] we can look back at it now and say thank
[1:21:46] god for those things
[1:21:47] maybe we didn't understand him at that
[1:21:49] age when dad said no when mom said no
[1:21:52] don't i don't want you associating with
[1:21:54] that type of crowd and thank god that we
[1:21:56] listened
[1:21:59] i i was talking to some friends back
[1:22:01] from we came from california in our
[1:22:03] neighborhood
[1:22:05] and one of those boys died at 19 years
[1:22:07] old
[1:22:09] a couple of them went to prison
[1:22:11] another one was stabbed to death
[1:22:13] because their raising was different than
[1:22:15] mine
[1:22:17] by the grace of god in the mercy of god
[1:22:22] by whom also we have access by faith
[1:22:25] into this grace wherein we stand
[1:22:28] and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
[1:22:34] this is through faith
[1:22:37] and faith is a revelation
[1:22:40] faith is an unveiling to you a faith is
[1:22:42] something being made plain so that you
[1:22:44] can understand and receive it and when i
[1:22:46] say understand it it's not to be able to
[1:22:48] take it make two plus two and this
[1:22:49] blessing no something in your heart says
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:54] not necessarily a mental explanation
[1:22:57] because that can change
[1:22:59] but when it gets down into the heart and
[1:23:00] it says amen
[1:23:04] and not only so but we glory in
[1:23:06] tribulations also
[1:23:09] knowing that tribulation worketh
[1:23:11] patience
[1:23:15] every tribulation has an end
[1:23:18] and god knows when that end is
[1:23:21] and some of you younger ones can look
[1:23:23] back and maybe look to your parents or
[1:23:25] an older brother or sister here and
[1:23:26] they'll tell you it will end
[1:23:29] we thought it never would but it did
[1:23:32] but about that time we started in
[1:23:34] another one
[1:23:35] because god is going to bring forth a
[1:23:37] perfect bride a whole blind a complete
[1:23:40] bride
[1:23:42] and if you'll say lord give me another
[1:23:44] tribulation until
[1:23:46] i become that he will it's for your good
[1:23:54] and patience
[1:23:56] experience
[1:23:58] and experience hope
[1:24:00] they that wait upon the lord
[1:24:02] shall renew their strength
[1:24:06] those that run to and fro don't renew
[1:24:08] their strength
[1:24:09] there's more confusion there's more
[1:24:11] anxiety there's more nervousness there's
[1:24:13] more wondering
[1:24:14] there's more going back to the starting
[1:24:16] place and starting all over again
[1:24:19] you ever done that before you get in get
[1:24:21] started finally you just said i'm going
[1:24:22] back to day one and i'm going to start
[1:24:24] all over again because all i've done for
[1:24:26] the last two week has run in circles
[1:24:29] but he says we glory in tribulations
[1:24:32] also knowing that tribulation work of
[1:24:34] patience and patience experience
[1:24:38] and there's only one way to get
[1:24:39] experience you can't read about
[1:24:41] experience
[1:24:42] you can't sit next to a pilot for a
[1:24:44] hundred flights and then them just give
[1:24:46] you the plane
[1:24:48] no there's training to go at least
[1:24:50] most pilots wouldn't do that they value
[1:24:52] their life more than that
[1:24:55] just because you've sat in an airplane
[1:24:57] you've flown many times in the back seat
[1:24:59] doesn't make you a pilot
[1:25:01] there's a lot of training just because
[1:25:03] you've gone to the doctor a hundred
[1:25:04] times doesn't make you a doctor
[1:25:08] sometimes people we act that way though
[1:25:12] and hope maketh not ashamed
[1:25:16] because the love of god is shed abroad
[1:25:18] in our hearts by the holy ghost which is
[1:25:21] given unto us
[1:25:23] paul says it's a matter of fact it's
[1:25:26] given unto you
[1:25:29] looking to see if anywhere he
[1:25:31] paraphrases and not really you have to
[1:25:32] earn it you got to work for you got no
[1:25:34] it's given to you
[1:25:36] brother greene always reminded us this
[1:25:38] god wants to give it to you more than
[1:25:41] you want it
[1:25:42] and how many would say lord i want it
[1:25:46] and he wants to give it to you more than
[1:25:47] that
[1:25:50] he says for when we were yet without
[1:25:53] strength in due time christ died for the
[1:25:56] ungodly
[1:26:00] i was a hebrew of hebrews
[1:26:03] i learned from the best he said i was
[1:26:05] raised by this one but he called himself
[1:26:08] an ungodly man right there
[1:26:12] because without christ you're an ungodly
[1:26:14] person
[1:26:16] for scarcely for a righteous man will
[1:26:18] one die
[1:26:20] yet pre-adventure for a good man
[1:26:23] some would even dare to die
[1:26:27] right have you ever come to the place in
[1:26:28] your life maybe as a father as a mother
[1:26:32] a brother a sister a good friend he
[1:26:33] would say lord i'm willing to take their
[1:26:35] place
[1:26:37] save them
[1:26:39] not very many people would do that
[1:26:44] paul says scarcely
[1:26:47] but god commendeth his love for us that
[1:26:50] while we were yet sinners
[1:26:52] christ died for us
[1:26:58] o love of god
[1:27:00] how rich and pure
[1:27:02] how measureless how strong
[1:27:05] it shall forevermore endure
[1:27:08] the saints and angels songs
[1:27:10] o love of god
[1:27:17] verse 9 much more than being justified
[1:27:20] by his blood
[1:27:22] we shall be saved
[1:27:24] from wrath through him
[1:27:28] much more he says
[1:27:30] for if when we were enemies
[1:27:32] we were reconciled to god
[1:27:35] by the death of his son
[1:27:37] much more being reconciled we shall be
[1:27:40] saved by his life
[1:27:44] why would god go through all of this
[1:27:48] to lose it all at the end
[1:27:52] just for fun
[1:27:53] ah didn't work let's try something else
[1:27:55] that's not god
[1:27:57] you go back to the old testament where
[1:27:59] is jehovah god talking about himself i
[1:28:02] did this i caused this i hardened
[1:28:04] pharaoh's heart i said to this because
[1:28:07] that's what he did
[1:28:10] he said let there be light
[1:28:12] and there was light
[1:28:16] and on the seventh day he
[1:28:18] rested
[1:28:21] you know when you can rest
[1:28:25] when it's over
[1:28:28] now for some of those for some of us
[1:28:31] saturday is our day of rest sunday's our
[1:28:33] day of rest
[1:28:35] and let me say for most of us there's
[1:28:37] not a day of rest
[1:28:39] we go every day we go every day we go i
[1:28:41] pray
[1:28:43] but you know there is rest in god
[1:28:47] let go and let god have his wonderful
[1:28:50] way
[1:28:51] take your hands off the steering wheel
[1:28:53] and let him drive
[1:28:57] take your hands off the foot off the
[1:28:58] brake too
[1:29:01] i'd really
[1:29:03] and i never have been i don't want to be
[1:29:05] one of those
[1:29:06] cars you see going down that says
[1:29:07] student driver
[1:29:09] and you're the one sitting on the other
[1:29:11] seat
[1:29:13] and the student driver is learning to
[1:29:14] drive
[1:29:17] but he'll sit there patiently
[1:29:19] he'll go with you he'll walk with you
[1:29:22] he'll be with you as you go through life
[1:29:29] for
[1:29:30] when we were enemies we were reconciled
[1:29:32] to god
[1:29:36] by the death of his son much more being
[1:29:39] reconciled we shall be saved by his life
[1:29:43] reconciled
[1:29:45] to restore to friendship or
[1:29:50] harmony to restore what is restoration
[1:29:54] was referred to
[1:29:57] restoration means it was at one time
[1:30:04] if you're a part of god now you always
[1:30:06] were a part of god
[1:30:11] and i will not lose one of them he said
[1:30:17] it's to settle to resolve
[1:30:19] to reconcile differences
[1:30:25] that's what paul says
[1:30:26] being reconciled being restored to
[1:30:28] friendship
[1:30:30] oh what a friendship to be called a
[1:30:33] friend of god
[1:30:35] i i will i will tell all that i have to
[1:30:38] my friends he said i'll speak with them
[1:30:41] i'll share with them
[1:30:45] or it says to make consistent or
[1:30:48] congruous
[1:30:49] and congruence means in agreement or
[1:30:52] harmony
[1:30:54] i'll say yes lord
[1:30:56] i'll say yes lord to what your will is
[1:31:02] to cause to submit to accept
[1:31:05] something unpleasant
[1:31:10] he was reconciled to hardship
[1:31:14] i'll be tested i'll be tried and i'm
[1:31:16] reconciled to the fact that yes lord you
[1:31:18] know what's best for me
[1:31:23] the the uh
[1:31:25] another one is
[1:31:26] to reconcile something to check
[1:31:29] in reference to a financial account
[1:31:31] against another for accuracy
[1:31:36] so i laid my account before him
[1:31:40] and i laid it down and i said look this
[1:31:42] is what it equals to
[1:31:45] and it didn't equal to anything
[1:31:51] but he reconciled it
[1:31:54] to check
[1:31:55] and for acura he says no here is the
[1:31:58] accurate account
[1:32:01] the one that has blood across it
[1:32:04] and it's pure it's whole
[1:32:07] there is no measurable value to it you
[1:32:11] can't say it's worth this much
[1:32:14] you've been reconciled
[1:32:17] why would he lose
[1:32:19] why would he give up on it
[1:32:21] never
[1:32:24] atonement
[1:32:26] reparation a restoration to a good
[1:32:28] condition
[1:32:30] he said it is good
[1:32:32] my good and his good are two different
[1:32:34] things
[1:32:37] sometimes for us it's good enough
[1:32:41] and some of the work that i've done
[1:32:43] i've looked at it back later and you and
[1:32:44] i said that was good enough well i
[1:32:47] wouldn't take it now
[1:32:50] but he said it is good because it was as
[1:32:53] it was supposed to be
[1:32:58] expiation i believe is how you say that
[1:33:00] word the act of extinguishing the guilt
[1:33:03] incurred by something
[1:33:09] propitiation the act of atoning for sin
[1:33:12] or wrongdoing
[1:33:13] especially
[1:33:15] appeasing a deity
[1:33:19] you cannot atone for your own sins you
[1:33:21] cannot please god by yourself
[1:33:27] because then who becomes a measurement
[1:33:28] for that
[1:33:30] if you go to the catholic church they
[1:33:32] have saints
[1:33:35] they have these uh different people that
[1:33:37] they have have come to this place of
[1:33:39] saint and people pray to them and they
[1:33:41] and all they in most of it it's in
[1:33:43] ignorance they've been taught that way
[1:33:49] to appease in other religions to appease
[1:33:52] uh you know
[1:33:53] some religions have millions of gods
[1:33:55] hopefully you find the right one
[1:33:58] to appease this to bring good luck to
[1:34:00] whatever it might be
[1:34:02] but this one god that i'm speaking of
[1:34:04] took it upon himself
[1:34:08] he didn't say this here's the list of
[1:34:09] things you must do to please me
[1:34:12] he said i for the glory that is set
[1:34:15] before me will go and do it myself
[1:34:18] i will lay down my life and i will lift
[1:34:21] it up i will shed my blood and through
[1:34:23] my blood
[1:34:26] your sins are forgiven
[1:34:28] they're not held against you
[1:34:30] brother branham when he was there in
[1:34:32] that little restaurant
[1:34:34] and he walked in and he saw that was
[1:34:36] going on and he gets upset and angry and
[1:34:39] frustrated and he goes out and he tells
[1:34:40] god why don't you do something about it
[1:34:44] he goes how can you stand that
[1:34:47] and god says let me show you
[1:34:50] and if you're ready the brother brahm
[1:34:51] says are those my sins and he says yes
[1:34:57] white lies are just as much as lies as
[1:35:00] black lies
[1:35:01] little lies are just as much as lies as
[1:35:03] big lies
[1:35:05] still in five cents is still stealing
[1:35:09] but sometimes we justify some of our
[1:35:12] but god covered it all
[1:35:14] there was a perfect atonement there was
[1:35:17] perfect reconciliation
[1:35:21] ephesians
[1:35:22] chapter 2
[1:35:25] verses 3 through 8.
[1:35:29] he says among whom we all
[1:35:31] had our conversation in the times past
[1:35:34] and the lust of our flesh conversation
[1:35:36] there is our manner of living our way of
[1:35:39] living
[1:35:40] not just our speaking but what our life
[1:35:42] did
[1:35:43] he says
[1:35:44] we all had our conversation in times
[1:35:47] past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling
[1:35:50] the desires of the flesh and of the mind
[1:35:53] and where by nature the children of
[1:35:56] wrath even as others paul says we were
[1:35:58] no different
[1:36:00] we were born the same way we came in the
[1:36:03] same way
[1:36:08] and he says but god who is rich in mercy
[1:36:14] thank god for his mercy
[1:36:16] thank god for his love
[1:36:18] thank god for
[1:36:20] his care for us
[1:36:22] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[1:36:25] great love we're with he loved us
[1:36:28] not just love but it's his great love
[1:36:34] i don't know how you measure love
[1:36:39] as a as a human as a being how do we
[1:36:41] measure love
[1:36:43] well
[1:36:45] if i love somebody i do this for them
[1:36:48] if i love somebody i don't do that to
[1:36:50] them
[1:36:51] that's our measure
[1:36:53] but he went and said i'll tell you how
[1:36:55] much i love you
[1:36:57] i'm going to take your place
[1:37:01] i want to come in a body of flesh and
[1:37:03] i'm going to be tempted i'm going to be
[1:37:04] tried i'm going to have to turn my head
[1:37:08] if there's something out there i
[1:37:10] shouldn't be looking at i'm going to
[1:37:12] have to walk away from situations rather
[1:37:14] than get involved in them
[1:37:16] but i'm also going to sit there and
[1:37:18] watch somebody being condemned and be
[1:37:21] asked to be stoned because of the law
[1:37:23] and i'm going to say i forgive you
[1:37:28] can we do that
[1:37:32] takes christ in us
[1:37:34] to do that
[1:37:36] he says
[1:37:38] for even when we were dead
[1:37:41] in sins
[1:37:44] i'm sorry we missed verse 4 i think
[1:37:46] let's go back
[1:37:51] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[1:37:53] great love
[1:37:54] wherewith he loved us
[1:37:56] verse 5
[1:37:58] even when we were dead in sins
[1:38:01] hath quickened has given us life
[1:38:04] together with christ
[1:38:05] by grace ye are saved
[1:38:10] unmerited favor undeserved favor nothing
[1:38:13] you paid for nothing you bought for
[1:38:16] but god gave it to you anyways
[1:38:18] and let me tell you this it hurts him
[1:38:20] more when you won't receive it
[1:38:24] that's what troubles him more why
[1:38:28] why when i'm offering you an opportunity
[1:38:30] but you're telling me no
[1:38:32] how many times in brother brandman when
[1:38:34] you're hearing him preach
[1:38:35] and he's talking to the congregations
[1:38:37] and he's crying especially into those
[1:38:39] messages associated with jesus with
[1:38:41] dirty feet
[1:38:43] and he's weeping he's crying because
[1:38:45] you're getting an offering an offer here
[1:38:47] to get down before him and wash his feet
[1:38:50] but you refuse to do so
[1:38:53] and here he is he says well we were dead
[1:38:55] he quickened us together with christ
[1:38:58] by grace you are saved and have raised
[1:39:02] us up together and made us sit together
[1:39:04] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:39:10] he did it all he desired to do it he did
[1:39:13] it
[1:39:15] so what do i owe to him i owe him
[1:39:17] everything
[1:39:20] how much can i pay for it i can't pay
[1:39:22] for any of it
[1:39:24] but lord let me be willing to give
[1:39:27] surrender yield however you want to put
[1:39:29] use whatever word you want to use
[1:39:31] say not my will but thy will be done
[1:39:36] by grace are you saved
[1:39:40] by the mercy of god by god's own
[1:39:42] choosing by his decision
[1:39:44] by his wanting to do so
[1:39:48] you look even in the animal kingdom
[1:39:51] and
[1:39:53] and and there's no soul in them
[1:39:56] but i've watched some of those when uh
[1:39:58] they put it on the news when a a mother
[1:40:01] geese
[1:40:02] takes her little group and they she
[1:40:04] crosses the street with him and they all
[1:40:05] follow her
[1:40:07] all the traffic stops
[1:40:11] it's funny they'll stop for for geese
[1:40:13] like that but the person walking
[1:40:14] sometimes they hit them
[1:40:17] a mother bear i was watching this one
[1:40:20] she's wanting to cross the street she's
[1:40:21] had enough experience in knowing what
[1:40:23] can happen on a street and she runs over
[1:40:26] and she grabs one and she takes her
[1:40:27] across and she goes to get the other one
[1:40:29] the other one starts running back across
[1:40:30] and she's going back and forth to save
[1:40:32] their lives
[1:40:34] to get them away from the horn
[1:40:37] in in in africa and some of those places
[1:40:39] to see a mother that the
[1:40:41] and because it is what it is it's a
[1:40:43] fallen nature and the one animal is
[1:40:45] trying to kill the other animal for food
[1:40:46] and territory and all because of the
[1:40:48] fallen nature
[1:40:50] and this mother is doing her best to
[1:40:52] protect her
[1:40:54] offspring
[1:40:55] that in a couple years that offspring
[1:40:57] will be out on their own
[1:40:59] but there's something in that nature
[1:41:01] that god had placed there
[1:41:05] the same nature that he has for his own
[1:41:09] and he says i've been there i've crossed
[1:41:11] that street before i've been in that
[1:41:14] situation before
[1:41:16] and i'm here to help you i'm here to
[1:41:17] rescue you i'm here with you
[1:41:19] and sometimes we just say i can do it
[1:41:21] myself
[1:41:24] i can do it all by myself
[1:41:26] i've shared this with before this young
[1:41:28] man that came to work for
[1:41:30] us and uh he was from new jersey
[1:41:34] he used to call me boss man
[1:41:37] i thought that was funny
[1:41:39] just sounded so funny to me boss man
[1:41:41] boss man is what he called me
[1:41:43] and he loved mexican food because they
[1:41:45] didn't have it in new jersey where he
[1:41:47] was from so he wanted to go
[1:41:49] eat mexican food every day
[1:41:52] and
[1:41:53] but i told him look i've done this
[1:41:55] enough years now i got a pretty good
[1:41:57] idea what not to do
[1:41:59] or you'll get in trouble for it
[1:42:02] and and he he said but i'm one of those
[1:42:04] that has to learn
[1:42:06] on my own
[1:42:07] i got to find out if it works or it
[1:42:08] doesn't
[1:42:10] and i said well i could tell you it
[1:42:11] doesn't work
[1:42:13] if you do this and this
[1:42:15] but he he just wouldn't believe it
[1:42:18] he just kept trying it
[1:42:19] and one day we were
[1:42:21] working on a job and they had brought in
[1:42:23] some custom sinks
[1:42:24] and we had to cut out the solid surface
[1:42:26] top
[1:42:27] and these sinks were custom made in
[1:42:29] mexico hand decorated in all
[1:42:32] and then they ran about 300 each
[1:42:34] today they'd probably be in the 2500
[1:42:37] each range
[1:42:39] so i told them when you make this jig
[1:42:40] please protect the inside of the sink
[1:42:43] completely nothing will happen to it
[1:42:47] and he didn't
[1:42:48] and he got ready to cut it out and i
[1:42:50] asked him
[1:42:51] did you
[1:42:53] protect it
[1:42:54] he said no it's got a bearing down on
[1:42:56] the bottom of this cutter and it'll go
[1:42:57] around i said i've seen those bearings
[1:42:59] come off right in the middle of a cut
[1:43:02] and he kept arguing with me and i said
[1:43:03] okay fine
[1:43:05] go ahead and cut it
[1:43:06] but if you damage it it will come out of
[1:43:08] your paycheck
[1:43:10] and he'll spend about 45 minutes to an
[1:43:12] hour preparing all this thing to do the
[1:43:13] work
[1:43:14] about five minutes worth of cutting
[1:43:17] and he looked at me for a bit
[1:43:19] and he took the whole thing apart
[1:43:21] and he fixed the inside first
[1:43:27] sometimes god will say i told you
[1:43:30] i've told you
[1:43:31] let me
[1:43:32] do that preparation work
[1:43:34] no lord i can handle it
[1:43:37] and then you come back and say lord
[1:43:39] i'm glad he's a god-rich and mercy
[1:43:43] a god who cares for us
[1:43:45] god who has the best intention and the
[1:43:47] best purpose of him for you
[1:43:52] but to remember sometimes we get to
[1:43:53] thinking of our sisters would come up
[1:43:58] we get to fill in and like those people
[1:44:00] that are up there already
[1:44:03] they're saints yes they are
[1:44:05] but so are you
[1:44:07] have you been washed by the blood
[1:44:12] have you been washed by the blood
[1:44:14] you testified to it say amen i have been
[1:44:16] washed by my sins are forgiven i've been
[1:44:18] cleansed you have as much right to be up
[1:44:21] there because that's how they got there
[1:44:24] nobody got there with good deeds
[1:44:28] nobody got there on their own
[1:44:30] it all came through the grace of god
[1:44:34] and you're going to make it too
[1:44:37] there's a whole heavenly host of
[1:44:39] witnesses
[1:44:41] sister joyce being one of the last ones
[1:44:43] to go up there
[1:44:45] and she would say the exact exact same
[1:44:47] thing it will be worth it all
[1:44:51] god has seen you on that side already
[1:44:54] you will be part of that
[1:44:58] don't lower yourself below that don't
[1:44:59] make less of yourself before that you
[1:45:02] are washed by the blood the precious
[1:45:04] blood of that lamb of god
[1:45:08] the grace of god is just as efficient
[1:45:10] today as just as great today as it ever
[1:45:13] was
[1:45:14] there's no less of it you don't diminish
[1:45:17] god
[1:45:18] by drawing from him
[1:45:23] understand that you don't diminish you
[1:45:24] don't make less of god there's not less
[1:45:26] of him because you draw from him he's
[1:45:30] that everlasting faithful fountain
[1:45:35] springs of living water
[1:45:37] mercy rewrote my life
[1:45:39] and never fails
[1:45:41] he's still there on the right hand of
[1:45:42] god
[1:45:44] grace
[1:45:46] god's perfect grace that's praying
[1:45:51] father that a cloud of witnesses

[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:04] lord and they would they would just
[1:46:05] encourage us they would just tell us
[1:46:07] don't give up
[1:46:09] don't lose hope don't throw up your
[1:46:13] hands in despair
[1:46:15] it's worth it all
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:19] the grace of god the perfect sacrifice
[1:46:22] of god
[1:46:23] paid for it
[1:46:24] all there is no entrance fee
[1:46:27] there is no entrance examination you
[1:46:30] don't have to pass a test to get in
[1:46:32] there you're being tested now for that
[1:46:34] entry
[1:46:37] lord let there be peace in the heart of
[1:46:39] each one of your believers these
[1:46:40] believers or these christians these
[1:46:42] these blood bought saints that are yours
[1:46:46] lord that one of these days will be on
[1:46:48] that side

[1:46:56] thank you for your mercy and your grace
[1:46:58] lord
[1:47:02] [Music]

[1:48:07] god's grace
[1:48:11] grace that is
[1:48:14] greater than
[1:48:16] all our sins
[1:48:21] when you confess something to god
[1:48:24] and even when you go make it right with
[1:48:26] a brother and sister
[1:48:28] and you put it under the blood it no
[1:48:30] longer exists
[1:48:32] except here
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:36] and
[1:48:37] the greatest battle ever fought happens
[1:48:39] here
[1:48:40] in each individual
[1:48:44] but let it settle down into the heart
[1:48:47] be at peace
[1:48:49] be at rest
[1:48:50] even as the scripture says
[1:48:53] to be at rest and be at peace
[1:48:56] when you're at rest you're not
[1:48:57] struggling with yourself
[1:49:01] because that's our biggest struggle self
[1:49:03] the one that goes with us everywhere we
[1:49:05] go
[1:49:07] lays down with us when we lay down
[1:49:11] looks at us straight back in the face
[1:49:14] when we look in the mirror
[1:49:16] the one that gives us most of our
[1:49:17] trouble
[1:49:19] and sometimes i say well just get rid of
[1:49:21] the mirror

[1:49:43] they said
[1:49:44] an action that somebody did at them
[1:49:47] and it still has a hold in their life
[1:49:50] and it still causes hurts and griefs and
[1:49:53] pains
[1:49:55] but they've asked for forgiveness
[1:49:57] they've made it right lord let the peace
[1:49:59] of god
[1:50:00] settle in their lives in that situation

[1:50:17] situation right now for each one of them
[1:50:20] that all is well
