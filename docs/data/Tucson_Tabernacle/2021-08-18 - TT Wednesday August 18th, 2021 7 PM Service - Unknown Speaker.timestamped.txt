[35:55] it's good to be here i appreciate
[35:57] brother aaron and and the brothers
[36:00] asking me to come minister and uh giving
[36:04] me an opportunity to come before you
[36:06] it's good it's good to be here
[36:09] it's good to see my aunt jacqueline back
[36:12] there she's uh
[36:14] she's special to me but she's uh
[36:16] jacqueline has had some
[36:18] wonderful experiences in life if you
[36:21] don't know my aunt jacqueline she's
[36:24] been
[36:25] she was a piano player when she was a
[36:26] young lady for brother branham
[36:29] she um
[36:31] her dad my grandpa was a deacon
[36:33] in brother branham's church
[36:35] jacqueline was there when the church
[36:38] ages were spelled out on the side of the
[36:40] wall of the branham tabernacle
[36:42] so she witnessed that she witnessed
[36:44] brother way
[36:47] losing his life in a heart attack and
[36:49] then being raised up we've heard it on
[36:51] tape
[36:52] my aunt jaclyn was there so it's it's
[36:54] good to have you and
[36:56] i'd like to talk with some of
[36:58] maybe the experiences that some of these
[37:01] folks have had um
[37:04] and when i come when i minister friends
[37:05] i don't i don't want to just come here
[37:07] and
[37:08] and minister just to say something that
[37:11] maybe would encourage you or
[37:13] or to get up here and
[37:15] and try to expound maybe on the word for
[37:18] my own self
[37:20] but what i want to happen is when i when
[37:22] i leave i want you to be closer to the
[37:24] lord i believe that's that's the role
[37:27] for every minister for every pastor for
[37:30] every evangelist whatever it might be
[37:32] is not to introduce the congregation to
[37:35] ourselves
[37:37] to not point people to ourselves or to
[37:39] take the spotlight but to develop a
[37:42] closer relationship between the
[37:44] congregation
[37:46] and the lord jesus
[37:48] that was that was brother branham's role
[37:51] and and how what a wonderful person
[37:54] brother branham was and i want to talk
[37:56] about a few things that that he did
[37:59] but ultimately his goal
[38:01] was to introduce us to the lord jesus
[38:05] we know that god sent a prophet that
[38:07] doesn't do us any good because the devil
[38:09] knows that too
[38:11] but if we know jesus christ
[38:13] then then that is the main thing brother
[38:16] um
[38:16] i'll start i would like to read that
[38:18] quote brother peter if you could put
[38:19] that that quote up on it from the church
[38:21] age book
[38:23] right at the end brother branham
[38:24] preached brother branham wrote this
[38:26] masterpiece called the church ages
[38:28] an exposition of the seven church ages
[38:30] he went through all of his doctrine
[38:32] through the church ages he he talked
[38:34] about serpent seed he talked about
[38:37] marriage and divorce he talked about all
[38:39] of these great doctrines that he brought
[38:42] out as the seventh messenger and this is
[38:45] how he closed
[38:47] that book
[38:49] of the church ages he says here he says
[38:51] not for one moment
[38:52] do i bring a message to the people that
[38:54] they may follow me
[38:56] or join my church or start some
[38:58] fellowship and organization
[39:01] i have never done that and will do not
[39:03] do that now i have no interest in those
[39:06] things
[39:07] but i do have an interest in the things
[39:09] of god
[39:10] and people and if i can accomplish just
[39:13] one thing i will be satisfied now this
[39:16] is the seventh angel message you're
[39:17] talking and if he says if i can just
[39:19] accomplish one thing
[39:21] then i will be satisfied in my ministry
[39:23] everything that i've done
[39:25] if i can just accomplish one thing
[39:29] that one thing is to see established a
[39:32] true spiritual relationship between god
[39:35] and men
[39:36] wherein men become new creations in
[39:39] christ
[39:40] filled with his spirit and live
[39:42] according to his word
[39:46] that is the role of a true minister of
[39:49] the gospel
[39:50] is to introduce that person to the lord
[39:54] jesus christ and then you step back
[39:58] and then god deals with the individual
[40:02] and you're there to help where you can
[40:04] but you want that that relationship and
[40:07] if that minister takes that relationship
[40:11] if he gets in there
[40:13] between
[40:14] christ and man
[40:16] it becomes the nicolaitan spirit
[40:19] and friends that nicolette and spirit it
[40:20] might be a very loving and sweet we
[40:22] think of we think of it as the pope and
[40:24] hitting the people over the head with a
[40:25] hammer that's not that's not the
[40:26] nicolaitan spirit is as we know it it's
[40:28] a very sweet spirit
[40:32] but it's deceiving
[40:34] and it takes away our relationship
[40:37] with the lord jesus
[40:40] um
[40:41] as i said myan jacqueline there she was
[40:43] a piano player
[40:45] in uh in the bram tabernacle
[40:48] one time jacqueline and my mom
[40:51] they got to go up to mount limit with
[40:54] brother branham
[40:55] they they had moved out here these young
[40:57] ladies they had moved out here and
[40:59] brother branham took his time in sister
[41:01] branham and took my mom
[41:03] and aunt jacqueline up to mount lemmon
[41:05] and he spent his time with them
[41:08] and they just thought he was he was such
[41:10] a great person and i grew up
[41:14] hearing these stories about brother
[41:16] branham and and how special he was and
[41:20] and what a great man he was my my dad as
[41:24] you know if you've listened to many
[41:25] tapes you've heard brother brown talk
[41:26] about brother evans and the times that
[41:29] he had with with brother evans and in
[41:31] the closeness that they had
[41:33] both of my grandpas wheeler and evans
[41:35] were on the mountain with brother
[41:36] branham when he spoke the storm away
[41:39] my my grandpa evans was just a 100 yards
[41:42] or so away from him
[41:44] when that storm came in and brother
[41:46] branham spoke that stormroy
[41:48] and we we see these great miracles but
[41:51] with brother branham
[41:53] it wasn't the reason he was so special
[41:56] it wasn't because of the miracles
[41:59] you know and that jacqueline can attest
[42:01] to this it wasn't the miracles that they
[42:03] saw and they saw some
[42:05] and it wasn't his command of the
[42:07] scriptures and i'm sorry i'm doing
[42:09] something wrong with this
[42:11] mic is that better my friend
[42:14] um
[42:17] and it wasn't even his command of the
[42:19] scriptures brother branham understood
[42:22] the scriptures very very well
[42:24] and he had these great revelations but
[42:26] that isn't why the people thought so
[42:29] much of him
[42:30] there was something different about him
[42:33] so much so that some people would even
[42:36] they would see this this this man and
[42:38] how he would act
[42:41] and they would even say well this has to
[42:43] be jesus christ returned
[42:45] because of because of the way he acted
[42:48] because of the spirit that he had
[42:50] it was an easy mistake to make the
[42:52] apostle john made the same mistake in
[42:54] the book of revelation when he saw the
[42:55] angel he fell down in worship and the
[42:56] angel is like no no no get up
[42:59] he must have had a had a great spirit
[43:01] that angel must have
[43:02] brother branham had that spirit where
[43:04] people just loved him and what was it
[43:08] why was it so different than everybody
[43:11] else and friends that's what i want to
[43:13] talk about today is
[43:15] is
[43:16] christ's prayer
[43:18] for the church and how we should be
[43:22] how each of us
[43:24] should be
[43:25] brother branham had that spirit that
[43:27] he could he could meet you and you just
[43:29] fell in love with him and you would do
[43:31] anything that he said
[43:32] and just anything that he would say
[43:34] you'd believe it and and you'd put him
[43:36] in this place and we see that spirit in
[43:39] other places peter when peter
[43:41] when he had the holy spirit he would
[43:43] just walk by someone and just his shadow
[43:46] casting across someone they would be
[43:48] healed
[43:49] imagine how they thought about peter and
[43:51] how great this man was
[43:56] and then
[43:57] the spirit would come forth
[43:59] and friends
[44:00] that is the church
[44:02] that needs to be
[44:04] in this day
[44:05] and i'm going to close with the
[44:07] scripture tonight
[44:09] i want to lay a foundation for it and
[44:11] i'm going to close with the scripture
[44:12] tonight
[44:14] that i pray that you will be thinking
[44:16] about always for the rest of your life
[44:19] because jesus prays
[44:21] and he says lord i want this church
[44:25] and i want to lay a foundation for that
[44:28] there's a there's a
[44:31] lady
[44:34] in jeffersonville her name's shirley
[44:37] knoll jacqueline do you know shirley
[44:38] noll you you like her
[44:41] like she'd say no
[44:43] uh sister shirley
[44:45] um
[44:46] she knew a young man named garnet peak
[44:50] garnet peak have y'all heard um there
[44:52] there's a sermon it was once called
[44:54] garnet peaks funeral now it's called i
[44:55] am the resurrection and life and it's
[44:57] about a young man who had polio
[45:00] and and he passed away when not only 16
[45:02] or 17 years old and brother brandon
[45:04] priest's funeral but there's a story
[45:06] behind this garnet peak
[45:08] young man
[45:10] garnet got sick of polio
[45:12] and he lived down in a place called
[45:16] acton kentucky and i don't know it's
[45:19] maybe a couple hours from jeffersonville
[45:21] south
[45:23] and garnet was this poor young man
[45:27] that
[45:28] didn't have any money
[45:30] but he loved to hear brother branham
[45:33] his parents were divorced he would save
[45:36] up his his child support money and he
[45:38] would buy brother branham's tapes
[45:41] and and he would listen to these tapes
[45:43] and he just loved him as he got sicker
[45:44] with polio he was in this iron lung and
[45:47] and he couldn't even get out of bed
[45:49] but he would listen to brother brana
[45:52] well he had a brother
[45:54] a half brother and this brother
[45:57] married
[45:58] this lady named shirley
[46:01] shirley did not like brother branham's
[46:05] message
[46:07] she didn't like it at all these
[46:09] self-righteous people and their long
[46:10] hair their long skirts they think
[46:12] they're better than me
[46:14] i you know i don't want anything to do
[46:16] with them it's so sad to see these
[46:18] people
[46:20] garnet got sicker and sicker
[46:23] and he asks his
[46:26] brother
[46:28] and sh and sister shirley he said
[46:31] brother branham's going to be in
[46:32] jeffersonville
[46:33] he said
[46:34] would you go hear him and then come back
[46:37] and tell me how it was
[46:40] shirley's like no i don't want to go i
[46:42] don't want to go with that bunch of
[46:44] people i'm not going to do it.
[46:46] he says please and she loved garnet
[46:48] garnet was such a nice boy
[46:50] she says okay she agreed so they made
[46:52] the trip up to jeffersonville and i want
[46:55] you to listen to the tape
[46:57] it's called souls that are in prison now
[47:01] preached in 1963 i'm sure we've all
[47:03] heard the tape
[47:04] about 30 minutes into the tape
[47:08] all right
[47:11] shirley is standing along the wall is
[47:14] packed
[47:16] she's standing along the wall
[47:18] and her thoughts were look at these poor
[47:22] people there they just don't understand
[47:27] and now shirley had very short hair
[47:30] her clothes weren't acceptable as we
[47:33] would think brother branham would say
[47:35] acceptable as we might think were
[47:37] acceptable her clothes didn't look like
[47:39] that she had enough paint on her face
[47:41] probably to you know paint a barn door
[47:44] and there she is and she's looking out
[47:46] on the audience
[47:47] and she's saying these poor people
[47:50] about 30 minutes in
[47:52] shirley faints
[47:54] she's never fainted before and she's
[47:56] never fainted from that time and you can
[47:59] hear it on the tape
[48:01] somebody comes to brother branham
[48:02] brother brown says a sister fainted
[48:05] they have prayer for
[48:09] and brother branham goes on preaching
[48:12] and then he stops again
[48:15] and
[48:16] he says bring her up here to the
[48:18] platform i want to lay my hands on her
[48:21] and he lays his hands
[48:24] on this young lady
[48:26] the way she looked the way she dressed
[48:29] whatever brother branham laid his hands
[48:31] on her
[48:32] and he said lord the devil's trying to
[48:35] to cheat your daughter
[48:37] out of a blessing
[48:40] and he takes her brother um doc
[48:43] brother brown's brother gives her a
[48:45] handkerchief
[48:48] she's sweating
[48:50] but the dog gives her a handkerchief
[48:51] brother branham says bring her up here
[48:53] on the platform
[48:55] and set her right here
[48:58] in front of all the congregation
[49:00] now brother brown's office was right
[49:02] here
[49:03] there's a little bit of air coming out
[49:04] there he sets her right here
[49:07] in front of the whole congregation
[49:09] let me tell you something brother
[49:10] branham was proud of that young lady
[49:14] he loved her
[49:17] sister shirley is sitting there in that
[49:19] chair and she takes this handkerchief
[49:24] then she wipes her face
[49:27] and she looks
[49:29] and there was all that paint
[49:32] on the handkerchief
[49:33] and she got condemned
[49:36] from that moment on
[49:39] shirley could not wait to get back into
[49:42] that church
[49:45] and and she became a true believer she's
[49:47] she's alive today and and living in the
[49:50] same place in acton kentucky
[49:53] down there but my point in saying that
[49:56] is
[49:57] brother branham had that spirit
[49:59] and it wasn't the miracles that got
[50:01] shirley it wasn't it wasn't all these
[50:02] things it was that love that he showed
[50:04] towards her and he and he brought her in
[50:07] so much so he's like sitter right here
[50:10] i'm proud of her
[50:12] i love her
[50:14] and and she comes in
[50:16] and and from that moment it wasn't it
[50:19] wasn't
[50:20] all of the stuff that we hear about with
[50:21] brother branham that we think about that
[50:22] we talk about it was his love that he
[50:25] had for her
[50:26] now i want to tell you someone else that
[50:28] had that same love
[50:30] and that was
[50:32] our lord and savior jesus christ
[50:36] in john
[50:37] this isn't the scripture but
[50:39] again i'm trying to get everybody ready
[50:41] for the scriptures that i'm going to
[50:42] read in john chapter 8 verse 10 let's
[50:45] read it real quick
[50:47] now what happened was
[50:50] another young lady
[50:52] far worse than sister shirley
[50:56] she was caught in the very act of
[50:58] adultery
[51:00] the very act now we could think what a
[51:03] vile person this woman was
[51:06] sleeping with another man's husband
[51:09] caught in the act
[51:11] brought out and about to be stoned
[51:15] for adultery that was the law
[51:18] jesus shows up
[51:22] and the pharisees are like what do you
[51:24] think we should do
[51:27] it's famous what he says we all know it
[51:31] he says he that is without sin among you
[51:33] let him first cast a stone at her
[51:37] even those pharisees they even got
[51:38] condemned
[51:40] so they start walking away one by one
[51:45] and then
[51:46] there's just jesus
[51:48] and the woman and they're there i
[51:50] believe it's uh verse
[51:53] number 10 verse 10.
[51:56] there's jesus
[51:57] and there's the woman
[52:00] and it's beautiful and he asks her
[52:03] he says woman
[52:05] where are those thine accusers
[52:08] has no man condemned me
[52:11] and she said imagine how she felt she
[52:13] was about to die for a sin
[52:16] imagine how this young lady felt
[52:20] she says
[52:21] no man lord
[52:23] and jesus said this
[52:25] and friends we always need to remember
[52:27] this
[52:28] when somebody does us wrong when we see
[52:30] someone doing something wrong
[52:33] here's what jesus says
[52:35] he says neither do i condemn me
[52:38] he says go
[52:40] and sin no more
[52:42] what a beautiful statement and what a
[52:45] beautiful thing that happened so much so
[52:48] that god chose it to be recorded
[52:50] in his word
[52:52] for thousands of years for people to be
[52:55] able to read and go back to this story
[52:58] and and live our lives
[53:01] by by that story
[53:04] and friends i uh
[53:08] uh i'll
[53:09] level with you we're we're here on a
[53:11] wednesday night there's not many people
[53:13] and you know it's wednesday nights i
[53:15] think it's it's nice
[53:16] because wednesday nights
[53:19] are when you can really see
[53:22] the pillars of the church
[53:24] these people that are here tonight right
[53:27] now
[53:28] are the ones that are holding the church
[53:30] up
[53:31] sunday we have more people in but this
[53:34] is the group friends if we are going to
[53:37] move forward
[53:38] this is the group that's going to do it
[53:40] in this room right now
[53:42] amen
[53:44] but we have to do something
[53:47] now
[53:50] i'm at a bit of a crossroads in my life
[53:54] many of you know me i've talked to the
[53:56] few of you and i moved here from
[53:57] jeffersonville lord told me to move to
[54:00] tucson
[54:02] and i'm searching
[54:04] i'm and friends i'm searching i'm
[54:06] searching for a church
[54:11] and you might
[54:12] you might not understand me in saying
[54:14] that
[54:15] i want a place that i can go
[54:19] that's not a church
[54:21] that
[54:22] that it's a body of christ
[54:25] working together
[54:26] in love in all the gifts operating in
[54:30] the church and i'm not just talking
[54:31] about spiritual gifts
[54:33] i'm talking about gifts of each other
[54:36] that that we come in and so often i hear
[54:39] oh i want to come to church i want to
[54:40] get fed
[54:42] well friends come to church we don't
[54:44] have to eat all the time
[54:47] no it's not you don't have to come to
[54:49] church to eat all the time sometimes you
[54:50] can feed someone else
[54:52] you can help
[54:54] and imagine imagine if this this lady
[54:56] that we just heard about here
[54:59] in the book of john imagine if she came
[55:01] to church and she sat next to one of you
[55:06] it's not the pastor
[55:07] it's not the deacons it's not the
[55:09] trustees
[55:11] each person
[55:13] comes into the church and has a role to
[55:16] play
[55:18] and i wrote this down as i was i was
[55:20] praying this morning lord what do you
[55:22] want me to say
[55:24] and
[55:26] i uh
[55:29] i felt checked and i thought no i think
[55:32] it is
[55:34] that the church
[55:36] the body of jesus christ i'm not talking
[55:39] about tucson tabernacle i'm talking
[55:41] about the body of jesus christ
[55:44] is only as good
[55:47] as you
[55:48] and you and me
[55:51] now if you're not the body of christ you
[55:53] can say oh well you know you know i can
[55:55] i can i can live the way i want i can
[55:57] you know i just have a problem with that
[55:58] but if you are the body
[56:01] remember
[56:02] you represent the lord jesus and his
[56:04] body is only as good as you are
[56:07] you represent him so imagine if this
[56:09] lady came in and she sat on the pew
[56:12] right here
[56:13] would she feel the same spirit of jesus
[56:16] christ sitting right there
[56:19] not from the pastor necessarily but from
[56:21] you that's sitting next to her
[56:23] and then she might reach out to you i
[56:24] need help
[56:26] i'm a sinner i'm struggling that's the
[56:29] church that i want brother aaron i want
[56:31] to have a church that i can go to that
[56:33] the holy spirit is
[56:35] operating independently in each person
[56:38] and each of us has a ministry
[56:41] and i want to see that in operation
[56:43] that's why i came here and i'm praying
[56:45] lord do you want me in tucson do you
[56:46] want me in phoenix where do you want me
[56:48] to do i know you want me here somewhere
[56:50] but i want a church that does that
[56:53] and this church is making some decisions
[56:55] right now we're choosing our pastor
[56:57] we're we're doing these things and
[57:00] we've got to put the lord first
[57:02] put him first we each have a role to
[57:05] play
[57:06] merely your position is just as
[57:08] important as a pastor it is not a
[57:11] it is not a
[57:12] a total body
[57:14] without you
[57:16] without me without you
[57:18] we have to be one body moving together
[57:21] or it's not right
[57:24] and and that's friends that's what i'm
[57:26] seeking that's what i want
[57:28] and
[57:31] i want a place to send somebody
[57:34] to church
[57:35] if i meet somebody i met the pastor
[57:37] across the street

[57:40] car wash and there's these

[1:01:02] there was some turmoil in the branham
[1:01:04] tabernacle you had the voice of god
[1:01:06] people and you had the brahm tabernacle
[1:01:08] people and it was bad and and this is um

[1:01:43] well she was supposed to meet at church
[1:01:44] so
[1:01:45] uh my wife stephanie i said uh well
[1:01:47] honey we're gonna meet this this lady
[1:01:49] and why don't you sit next to her and
[1:01:52] help her you know so she knows where to
[1:01:54] go to the baptism and all that
[1:01:56] so we walk into the church early we
[1:01:59] always we always want the first ones
[1:02:00] there we walk into the church early and
[1:02:02] there's three deacons
[1:02:04] standing there and they're standing
[1:02:06] around this this
[1:02:07] big woman
[1:02:09] and and she's talking loud and they're
[1:02:12] like now what do you want now who are
[1:02:13] you here and i was like oh this is tammy
[1:02:16] you know it must be tammy
[1:02:19] i walk up and i said sister tammy as
[1:02:22] soon as she heard my voice
[1:02:24] she grabbed me
[1:02:26] i mean i was like
[1:02:28] you know
[1:02:29] don't do
[1:02:30] so i put my hands down and she's no
[1:02:33] brother dude i love you so much and i'm
[1:02:34] thinking the deacons are looking at me
[1:02:39] it's okay it's okay
[1:02:41] so
[1:02:43] baptizer
[1:02:46] and friends what breaks my heart
[1:02:49] is i didn't have a place to send her
[1:02:52] that she could have a church
[1:02:55] and so often people say well give them a
[1:02:57] tape
[1:02:59] they don't need a tape
[1:03:02] they need a body
[1:03:04] they need a body of believers to help
[1:03:06] them all of us do
[1:03:08] we can't operate independently
[1:03:10] we need that body and this group of
[1:03:14] pillars here
[1:03:17] you are that body
[1:03:20] don't neglect that
[1:03:22] you be the gift to others but you have
[1:03:25] to live the life
[1:03:27] you have to make the commitment you have
[1:03:29] to i have to
[1:03:31] and then we can be a blessing
[1:03:33] blessing to others
[1:03:36] i uh
[1:03:37] i want to read before i get to my
[1:03:39] scripture i want to read first
[1:03:41] corinthians chapter 12.
[1:03:44] um
[1:03:46] last
[1:03:48] last verse in chapter 12.
[1:03:55] i just turned 50 like a few weeks ago
[1:03:59] and some for some reason my the uh
[1:04:02] i read my bible so much that the uh the
[1:04:04] words on there have gotten kind of
[1:04:06] rubbed off and blurry
[1:04:13] right
[1:04:17] let me put these on
[1:04:21] first corinthians chapter 12.
[1:04:24] we're all familiar with this this
[1:04:26] chapter it's about the gifts in the
[1:04:28] church
[1:04:30] and it it talks about how each of us
[1:04:32] have has our own part to play and no
[1:04:34] member of the body is any greater than
[1:04:37] any other member and it all operates
[1:04:40] they operate independently but for the
[1:04:42] collective good
[1:04:44] of of the body of christ
[1:04:47] and you go to the to the last verse
[1:04:51] and and paul says he's he's instructing
[1:04:54] us on how to on how to have a church and
[1:04:56] he says this he says but covet earnestly
[1:04:58] the best gifts and yet i show unto you a
[1:05:01] more excellent way
[1:05:04] now the way that the bible's written it
[1:05:05] isn't written in chapters that came up
[1:05:08] long time later paul wrote this big long
[1:05:11] letter to the church at corinth
[1:05:14] so when we separate it into chapters it
[1:05:16] helps us keep track of where we are
[1:05:18] but that's not the way paul wrote it and
[1:05:20] he says here but covet earnestly the
[1:05:22] best gifts and yet i show unto you a
[1:05:25] more excellent way though i speak with
[1:05:27] tongues of men and angels and have not
[1:05:29] charity which is love
[1:05:31] and become as a sounding brass and a
[1:05:33] tinkling
[1:05:34] symbol and ann jacqueline
[1:05:37] that's why brother branham
[1:05:39] was such a great man
[1:05:42] is because that's what he had
[1:05:46] that's why people would worship him
[1:05:51] because he had love
[1:05:55] and that's the church that i want to be
[1:05:57] a part of
[1:05:59] that's where i want to be
[1:06:04] and now i'm gonna get to my
[1:06:06] my scripture
[1:06:09] let's uh
[1:06:11] let's go to uh saint john chapter 14.
[1:06:14] this isn't my scripture yet but i'm
[1:06:16] gonna get there we're getting closer
[1:06:21] st john chapter 14.
[1:06:25] now
[1:06:26] what's going on right here
[1:06:29] is
[1:06:30] we read chapter 13 for the communion
[1:06:33] service
[1:06:34] and we're all familiar with with that
[1:06:36] service but we get to saint john 14
[1:06:40] and jesus is talking to his disciples
[1:06:44] and this is the last supper it's a very
[1:06:46] very sad time it's just an absolutely
[1:06:49] awful time in history
[1:06:51] is is this moment here
[1:06:54] when judas he says judas go do what you
[1:06:57] got to do
[1:06:58] can you imagine the man the young man
[1:07:00] jesus 33 years old
[1:07:02] knowing what's going to happen
[1:07:06] and and i guarantee he was down
[1:07:09] and he's
[1:07:10] he's he's he's there and he's like lord
[1:07:12] i got these
[1:07:13] these disciples
[1:07:15] he had 11 men and then and then some
[1:07:18] women we don't know exactly how many but
[1:07:20] there was there was women there too
[1:07:22] and he's he's he's like he has these and
[1:07:26] he's got just this last
[1:07:28] few hours
[1:07:29] with them
[1:07:32] and
[1:07:33] he leaves he um he starts he starts
[1:07:36] talking to them
[1:07:39] and he talks about a lot of things in in
[1:07:41] chapter in verse
[1:07:43] 8
[1:07:44] chapter 14 verse 8.
[1:07:48] philip asks him i'm in first corinthians
[1:07:56] asks him he says he says
[1:07:58] lord show us the father
[1:08:02] and jesus is like philip
[1:08:05] he says have i been so long with you
[1:08:08] and you don't know me now it's very
[1:08:10] important for my scripture when i get a
[1:08:12] little bit later
[1:08:14] that jesus philip says show us the
[1:08:16] father
[1:08:17] and and jesus is like have i been so
[1:08:19] long with you and you don't know me
[1:08:21] look how close
[1:08:23] the father and the son are
[1:08:25] that jesus could say that he could say
[1:08:28] you want to see the father
[1:08:31] here i am
[1:08:33] come on phillip
[1:08:35] you know and
[1:08:36] and he starts talking about these things
[1:08:39] and and then he he mentions in saint
[1:08:42] john 14 12
[1:08:44] famous scripture that we all know he
[1:08:45] says he says verily verily i say unto
[1:08:47] you that he that believeth on me the
[1:08:48] works that i al the works that i do
[1:08:50] shall he do also and greater works
[1:08:56] than those shall he do because i go to
[1:08:57] the father greater we know brother
[1:08:59] branham explain what that is more
[1:09:02] because jesus was limited by his flesh
[1:09:05] he was he was one man standing there he
[1:09:07] had to be there
[1:09:09] for somebody to be healed
[1:09:11] he had to be in the place
[1:09:14] but he says but greater than than these
[1:09:17] are you gonna do
[1:09:19] and he starts telling us about a very
[1:09:22] very important thing and let's skip down
[1:09:25] to uh
[1:09:26] i don't know where the first time he
[1:09:28] mentions it
[1:09:30] um
[1:09:34] starts talking about
[1:09:36] a comforter
[1:09:39] and he starts talking about this person
[1:09:41] that's coming
[1:09:44] and they're not understanding
[1:09:47] but he says he says hey i'm going to go
[1:09:49] away
[1:09:50] i'm going to leave
[1:09:52] but don't be sad listen the disciples
[1:09:53] start to get sad and say oh you're going
[1:09:55] to go
[1:09:56] what's going to happen he says no no no
[1:09:57] don't be sad it's a good thing
[1:09:59] he says i'm going to leave you
[1:10:02] but i'm going to send the comforter
[1:10:04] proper translation
[1:10:06] while i was an advocate
[1:10:09] i'm going to send
[1:10:10] this person
[1:10:12] and he's going to be so close to you
[1:10:16] that he's going to be
[1:10:17] in you
[1:10:19] and he will never leave you i got to
[1:10:21] leave you i got to go but he's not going
[1:10:24] to leave you
[1:10:27] and they they move along and they don't
[1:10:29] understand what's going on
[1:10:31] and and jesus
[1:10:33] says this
[1:10:34] in uh
[1:10:39] verse 31 chapter chapter
[1:10:41] 14 verse 31 he says this they're sitting
[1:10:44] at the table and he says okay let's get
[1:10:46] up
[1:10:47] and let's go
[1:10:49] so what they do is they're in the old
[1:10:51] city of jerusalem they're in there in
[1:10:53] the city of jerusalem they get up and
[1:10:55] they start walking down the hill now
[1:10:58] brother lyle's been there
[1:11:00] that
[1:11:00] it's not very far
[1:11:03] that they had to go from the city and
[1:11:05] they start walking down this trail
[1:11:08] and as they're walking jesus is telling
[1:11:12] them all these things
[1:11:14] and he says listen i'm going to send
[1:11:15] this comforter he's going to be inside
[1:11:17] of you he's going to do these things
[1:11:19] don't worry you know things are going to
[1:11:21] get bad
[1:11:22] you're going to suffer you're going to
[1:11:23] suffer the same thing i'm suffering but
[1:11:26] it's okay
[1:11:27] it's gonna be better
[1:11:29] and they're walking
[1:11:31] down this hill
[1:11:34] and they they get down i don't know but
[1:11:36] a lot of what is it probably a 30 minute
[1:11:37] walk maybe from
[1:11:39] from the old city i've done it i've been
[1:11:41] there you you walk down it's sidewalk
[1:11:43] now you know it's pavement and roads and
[1:11:45] stuff but but
[1:11:47] they walk down the steep hill and they
[1:11:49] get they they cross
[1:11:53] this dry creek bed
[1:11:56] and just on the other side
[1:12:00] of the dry creek bed
[1:12:02] is the garden of gethsemane
[1:12:08] i would have loved
[1:12:09] to have gone that walk
[1:12:12] with him
[1:12:15] i can only imagine what it was like
[1:12:18] he was about to be crucified within
[1:12:22] a few hours within if within one day he
[1:12:24] was going to be in the grave
[1:12:27] he was going to be on the cross
[1:12:29] the next morning
[1:12:32] and the disciples didn't know this he
[1:12:34] knew it
[1:12:36] and he's he's telling the disciples
[1:12:39] about this holy spirit the same holy
[1:12:42] spirit friends that we need you know i
[1:12:45] want to read
[1:12:47] he he says many times
[1:12:52] he says to love one another
[1:12:55] it was almost like it was the most
[1:12:56] important thing to him
[1:12:58] i encourage you to go read saint john 14
[1:13:00] 15 16
[1:13:02] and 17.
[1:13:05] it was very very important to him that
[1:13:07] they love one another he didn't tell us
[1:13:09] about what kind of music we should have
[1:13:11] in church
[1:13:12] he didn't tell us about if we should
[1:13:14] have four deacons or six deacons or two
[1:13:17] deacons
[1:13:18] it wasn't important
[1:13:21] what was important
[1:13:22] to jesus
[1:13:24] was that we love one another
[1:13:26] and that we're together
[1:13:29] and he's walking down
[1:13:30] and he gets down
[1:13:32] to the bottom of the hill
[1:13:35] he gets to the garden
[1:13:40] and
[1:13:42] he's finished
[1:13:44] with his last time
[1:13:46] that he talks with his disciples
[1:13:50] and how many times he says love
[1:13:53] in there
[1:13:55] now
[1:13:56] i'll get to my scripture
[1:14:00] saint john chapter 17. we'll start with
[1:14:02] verse 20.
[1:14:04] and friends i pray that
[1:14:05] the holy spirit's with us
[1:14:08] and i pray that
[1:14:10] in in speaking tonight that
[1:14:13] that
[1:14:14] have prepared your heart
[1:14:17] for what jesus prayed
[1:14:20] because it's
[1:14:21] so important his prayer
[1:14:26] he says this
[1:14:30] let's start with verse 19. he says and
[1:14:32] for their sake for their sakes i
[1:14:34] sanctify myself
[1:14:36] that they also might be sanctified
[1:14:39] through the truth
[1:14:43] now this is the best part this is my
[1:14:45] favorite scripture
[1:14:48] one of them
[1:14:50] he says this
[1:14:51] he says
[1:14:54] this is this is uh friends we gotta
[1:14:56] you gotta listen to this this is very
[1:14:58] very important he says this he says
[1:15:01] neither pray i for these alone
[1:15:04] but for them also which shall believe on
[1:15:07] me
[1:15:08] through
[1:15:09] their word
[1:15:11] guess what
[1:15:13] that's us
[1:15:15] that's the people in this tabernacle
[1:15:17] tonight brother matt that's us
[1:15:20] jesus prayed for
[1:15:23] me
[1:15:24] he prayed for me right here here i am
[1:15:27] reading
[1:15:28] his words through the apostle john's
[1:15:31] testimony
[1:15:33] scripture fulfilled right here
[1:15:36] i'm here i believe it
[1:15:38] so let's go on now
[1:15:40] he says this
[1:15:43] he says that they all may be
[1:15:48] won
[1:15:51] now you probably never thought about
[1:15:52] this when you've read this scripture
[1:15:55] that they all may be one
[1:15:58] as thou father
[1:16:00] art in me
[1:16:01] and i in thee
[1:16:03] that they also may be one in us
[1:16:08] that the world may believe that thou
[1:16:10] hast sent me
[1:16:14] the oneness
[1:16:15] of us
[1:16:17] as a body
[1:16:18] in the tucson tabernacle
[1:16:21] our oneness our love for each other
[1:16:24] will prove to the world that jesus is
[1:16:26] the messiah
[1:16:28] did i read that right
[1:16:30] yes i did read it right
[1:16:32] it says here that they may they may they
[1:16:35] all may be one as thou father art and me
[1:16:37] and i in thee that they also may be one
[1:16:40] in us that the world may believe that
[1:16:43] thou has sent me
[1:16:45] that's our
[1:16:46] testimony you know we think oh i want to
[1:16:48] do great miracles oh i want to part to
[1:16:50] see the red sea like moses did you know
[1:16:53] i want to do this and maybe we could get
[1:16:55] maybe we could have a prayer line and
[1:16:56] then when all the people come through
[1:16:58] and we see all the people healed then
[1:16:59] they'll believe or we'll get a some
[1:17:01] intellectual up here and he'll be such a
[1:17:03] great preacher he'll be he'll he'll
[1:17:05] bring them in and he will make them
[1:17:07] believe no
[1:17:10] how the world sees that jesus is the
[1:17:14] christ is by our oneness
[1:17:17] by our unity
[1:17:19] how important is it oh man there's more
[1:17:23] and he says this
[1:17:25] and the glory which thou gaveth me i
[1:17:27] have given them
[1:17:29] that they may be one
[1:17:32] even as we are one
[1:17:35] right
[1:17:35] now remember i read the scripture with
[1:17:37] philip
[1:17:39] how close and we as message believers we
[1:17:42] understand it's very difficult for us
[1:17:45] to separate jesus and the father
[1:17:50] there's differences there because one
[1:17:52] was born
[1:17:54] one
[1:17:55] gave his life god can't die jesus died
[1:17:58] so but but as us as message believers in
[1:18:01] understanding
[1:18:02] it's so hard for me to separate
[1:18:06] the father from the son because you
[1:18:07] can't
[1:18:08] because they are one
[1:18:10] and he said we need to be
[1:18:14] one
[1:18:16] as jesus and the father are one you and
[1:18:19] me
[1:18:20] we need to be one
[1:18:21] as close as jesus and the father are one
[1:18:25] to me
[1:18:27] that would be impossible
[1:18:30] but i mean we're all about the
[1:18:32] impossible
[1:18:35] how close
[1:18:37] should we be
[1:18:38] as a church and keep going
[1:18:43] oh let me read it one more time
[1:18:48] and the glory which thou gavest me i
[1:18:50] have given them that they may be one
[1:18:52] even as we are one i in them and thou in
[1:18:55] me that they may be made perfect
[1:18:59] in
[1:18:59] one
[1:19:02] and that the world may know that thou
[1:19:04] has sent me
[1:19:06] and has loved
[1:19:07] them
[1:19:08] as thou has loved me
[1:19:10] he loves us as much as he loved
[1:19:13] jesus christ
[1:19:14] it's a big deal
[1:19:18] father
[1:19:20] oh can you imagine what he's saying here
[1:19:22] this is jesus praying
[1:19:24] right before he was betrayed and taken
[1:19:26] to the cross
[1:19:28] father
[1:19:30] father
[1:19:31] i will that they also
[1:19:33] whom now has given me be with me where i
[1:19:37] am
[1:19:39] that they may behold my glory which thou
[1:19:41] has given me for thou lovest me before
[1:19:43] the foundation of the world
[1:19:46] lord
[1:19:47] i love these and i want them with me
[1:19:50] remember he's talking about us
[1:19:57] o righteous father
[1:19:59] the world hath not known me
[1:20:02] but i have known thee and these have
[1:20:05] known that thou has sent me
[1:20:08] and i have declared unto them thy name
[1:20:10] and will declare it
[1:20:12] that the love
[1:20:14] wherewith thou hast love me
[1:20:16] may be in them
[1:20:18] and i
[1:20:20] in them
[1:20:21] our love for one another
[1:20:23] and the holy spirit
[1:20:25] operating in each of us
[1:20:29] friends i have
[1:20:31] i have a bunch of scriptures but i feel
[1:20:33] like the lord says stop right there
[1:20:36] i um
[1:20:39] it's
[1:20:40] so important my brother brother aaron if
[1:20:42] you could think about whatever song
[1:20:44] you're going to close with and maybe the
[1:20:47] the
[1:20:47] piano player whoever the musicians are
[1:20:51] and
[1:20:52] let me um
[1:20:56] this is something friends it's not easy
[1:20:59] we have been given and as i've read in
[1:21:01] the scriptures here we've been given a
[1:21:03] great responsibility
[1:21:05] and we're not just going to sit around
[1:21:07] we can't just sit around and let it
[1:21:09] happen
[1:21:10] my mother-in-law there
[1:21:12] merely she um as you know she lost rod
[1:21:15] a little while ago
[1:21:17] and she's not alone
[1:21:19] she has a body here
[1:21:21] that that were together
[1:21:24] and
[1:21:24] she was uh
[1:21:26] she was riding her bike the other day
[1:21:28] and she's going to say i'm never going
[1:21:29] to tell this guy another story again as
[1:21:31] long as i live
[1:21:35] she's riding her bike the other day
[1:21:38] and she fell
[1:21:40] it crashed
[1:21:41] seat was too tall and she
[1:21:43] fell over
[1:21:45] and she said something
[1:21:48] that
[1:21:50] really struck me
[1:21:53] and i felt the holy spirit when she said
[1:21:54] it and i didn't tell you
[1:21:57] but she said
[1:21:59] as she was sitting there on the ground
[1:22:02] and here's this little lady lost her
[1:22:03] husband she doesn't know what to do and
[1:22:06] here's what marilee said
[1:22:08] she said well she said
[1:22:11] i can just sit here and cry
[1:22:15] she said or i can get up
[1:22:19] and i thought hey man
[1:22:21] and i say as a church

[1:22:25] are we going to just sit here
[1:22:27] and do nothing

[1:22:32] something
[1:22:33] are we going to get up
[1:22:35] are we going to
[1:22:37] do our part remember i said that the
[1:22:39] body of christ is only as good as the
[1:22:41] person sitting in your seat right now
[1:22:43] it's a big responsibility but it's the
[1:22:45] truth if you're the body
[1:22:49] so we need to do something we need to
[1:22:51] pray
[1:22:53] so can we pray can we pray together will

[1:23:54] unto love one another
[1:23:57] in these gifts as our great brother
[1:24:02] the apostle paul said
[1:24:04] these gifts are nothing without love
[1:24:08] lord place that love in our hearts
[1:24:12] place that holy spirit in our bodies

[1:24:19] with each other i pray
[1:24:22] and bless our church here tonight father
[1:24:24] i pray and
[1:24:25] as i said earlier i believe as you the
[1:24:27] pillars that are in the church are now
[1:24:30] visible here on wednesday night
[1:24:32] they're exposed lord
[1:24:35] they're here and they're holding up the
[1:24:37] church i pray for each one
[1:24:40] i pray for the leadership i i pray for
[1:24:42] brother matt and the decisions that he's
[1:24:45] making right now
[1:24:46] i pray that your holy spirit would lead
[1:24:48] him lord

[1:25:03] thank you that we can read this bible
[1:25:06] and find our place in there
[1:25:08] we love you lord
[1:25:10] we pray to you in the name of the son of
[1:25:12] god jesus christ
[1:25:15] amen
[1:25:34] i
[1:25:36] love him
[1:25:38] [Music]
[1:25:40] i
[1:25:42] love
[1:25:43] him
[1:25:47] because he
[1:25:49] first
[1:25:51] loved me
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:25:56] and
[1:25:59] purchased my
[1:26:01] salvation
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:19] he said one
[1:26:21] thing to his disciples he said by this
[1:26:25] shall all men know
[1:26:26] you are my disciples
[1:26:29] when you've understood every mystery
[1:26:32] when you can repeat everything back
[1:26:35] no he said when you have love one for
[1:26:38] another
[1:26:40] see because when you have love you have
[1:26:41] god
[1:26:42] for god is love
[1:26:44] and when you have god you have
[1:26:46] everything
[1:26:47] because he is the creator of all
[1:26:50] he's the source of all
[1:26:52] he gives all
[1:26:54] when the honest truth is when we don't
[1:26:56] have god we have nothing
[1:26:59] i i
[1:27:00] was talking to brother dan
[1:27:02] before could sense his a little bit of
[1:27:05] apprehension and his
[1:27:07] his nervousness a bit
[1:27:10] and i said god saw this day already
[1:27:13] god had already said
[1:27:15] brother dan's going to be speaking that
[1:27:16] evening so i said
[1:27:19] speak what god put in your heart
[1:27:21] because it's for us
[1:27:24] and
[1:27:28] somebody can come from the other side of
[1:27:30] the world not knowing anything about us
[1:27:33] stand behind here
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:35] and god will speak to you
[1:27:38] current
[1:27:39] oh that's what we just heard that's what
[1:27:41] i'm going through because god is fully
[1:27:44] aware of that and
[1:27:47] got a chance to just talk with him a
[1:27:48] little bit before and
[1:27:50] share some things and
[1:27:54] when god gets a hold of a person
[1:27:56] and it's god
[1:27:58] doing the work
[1:28:01] that's when people love that person
[1:28:05] truly love because you're loving the god
[1:28:08] that's in that person
[1:28:10] i i remember
[1:28:14] talking with sister nadine
[1:28:16] words
[1:28:18] when does she when brother brandon would
[1:28:20] drop off
[1:28:21] brother joseph there
[1:28:23] to play with her son
[1:28:26] and he said as soon as brother branham
[1:28:27] she said oh me as soon as brother
[1:28:28] abraham got there
[1:28:30] he would make you feel important
[1:28:33] it would be he would leave something
[1:28:35] with you that would encourage you
[1:28:39] it never she said it was just something
[1:28:41] that was
[1:28:42] he did
[1:28:44] but that was not brother brown
[1:28:47] that was jesus christ the same one in
[1:28:49] you
[1:28:51] i
[1:28:53] just things as you look back in life and
[1:28:56] as you go further down the road there's
[1:28:58] a home a lot more now to look back and i
[1:29:00] i like the way brother dan said that the
[1:29:02] words have gotten a little blurrier and
[1:29:04] maybe it's because i've opened now
[1:29:06] as life goes on things change
[1:29:10] and and just i was sharing with him as
[1:29:13] we shared some things together and
[1:29:16] you don't know the effects that you've
[1:29:17] had on someone
[1:29:20] because you let god be manifest through
[1:29:22] your life you didn't wake up in the
[1:29:25] morning and say today i'm gonna go
[1:29:28] be god to somebody it's just your
[1:29:30] character nature of christ in you
[1:29:33] and that little thing you do that little
[1:29:35] thing you say
[1:29:36] how you help how you smile to somebody
[1:29:39] reaches somebody's life
[1:29:42] we did something for a young man we just
[1:29:44] tried to help him try to encourage him
[1:29:47] try to be
[1:29:48] as i said an older brother to him
[1:29:50] because
[1:29:51] mom and dad had separated and he didn't
[1:29:54] have
[1:29:55] somebody around him and i filled that
[1:29:58] for a time
[1:30:00] and later in life he told his mother and
[1:30:02] she told me he said brother aaron will
[1:30:04] never know what he did for me in my life
[1:30:08] and i said no i won't
[1:30:10] but if god did that then it'll have its
[1:30:13] effect
[1:30:16] and i i'll just say it this way tucson
[1:30:18] tabernacle it's christ in you
[1:30:21] the hope of glory
[1:30:24] but it's also somebody else's hope if
[1:30:25] you'll share it with them
[1:30:27] and not hold it to yourself
[1:30:30] when whatever place or part you are
[1:30:34] and uh
[1:30:35] putting that sister down there
[1:30:38] i was reading something the other day
[1:30:40] where brother branham was it was
[1:30:41] question answers and they told him he
[1:30:43] said how could you let that sister play
[1:30:45] the piano look at her hair look at how
[1:30:47] she is look at how she's dressed and
[1:30:48] brother brandon was letting her play the
[1:30:50] piano in his service
[1:30:52] and they're criticizing and he says you
[1:30:53] have no idea what that's going to do for
[1:30:55] her
[1:30:58] if we're not careful we'll throw them
[1:31:00] out
[1:31:01] but let god have us let the christ in
[1:31:03] you reach out and touch somebody
[1:31:07] i pray that that's that's that's each on
[1:31:09] all our desires if we'll stand together
[1:31:15] keep brother dan in prayer
[1:31:17] it has been a hard road
[1:31:19] it's been a tough time
[1:31:22] but god's children
[1:31:24] are used wherever they're needed
[1:31:27] the body has a lot of parts that you
[1:31:29] have no idea about them unless maybe
[1:31:31] you've studied it
[1:31:32] until they go wrong
[1:31:35] and then the doctor says this is this is
[1:31:38] what's happening in your body because
[1:31:40] this is failing you right now
[1:31:43] and i thank god if that great physician
[1:31:45] goes down and says this is what you have
[1:31:47] need of so
[1:31:48] how many appreciate the word of god
[1:31:50] today
[1:31:51] how many knows that it was just
[1:31:52] something they needed to hear
[1:31:55] amen let's just bow our heads lord we
[1:31:57] appreciate that
[1:32:00] i know brother dan was was
[1:32:03] as he talked to me before and said he
[1:32:05] was
[1:32:05] sure to do that but lord you knew this
[1:32:07] day was coming
[1:32:09] and you knew what we would hear today
[1:32:11] and how it would it would remind us
[1:32:14] that the christ in us
[1:32:16] is the same christ and our brother and
[1:32:18] our sister
[1:32:19] and the world is going to know you
[1:32:21] because we
[1:32:23] share you with others lord
[1:32:26] because there's truly only one god i
[1:32:28] spoke to a young man
[1:32:31] yesterday
[1:32:32] and he told me how he knows there's a
[1:32:34] god he just doesn't know which one it is
[1:32:36] but he also noticed that how all the
[1:32:38] religions fought that they had the right
[1:32:40] god
[1:32:42] but in his heart was to see a living god
[1:32:45] a true god lord
[1:32:48] and you've chosen to demonstrate
[1:32:49] yourself a living god
[1:32:51] through a people
[1:32:53] who lord would let you dwell in them
[1:32:55] lord
[1:32:56] we surrender to you we yield to you say
[1:32:58] lord let that be us
[1:33:01] may we love one another and may that
[1:33:03] love be
[1:33:04] not just words but a demonstration a
[1:33:06] part of our life lord jesus
[1:33:09] because
[1:33:11] lord with the way things are happening
[1:33:12] today on this earth
[1:33:14] it can't be too much longer
[1:33:16] let the love of god reach out
[1:33:19] to anyone that we could reach and that
[1:33:22] that hope would lie in them also lord is
[1:33:25] our desire
[1:33:26] in jesus christ's name
[1:33:28] amen
[1:33:31] a couple of things to bring to your
[1:33:33] attention
