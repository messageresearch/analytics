[55:06] brother Aon to ask the church to pray
[55:07] for me I've been I've been going through
[55:09] a hard time Daniel's got to be probably
[55:12] in late 40s somewhere about there now

[57:04] would you pray for me I just don't feel
[57:06] well and that was between 600 and 7 o'
[57:08] in the evening and my dad told me he
[57:10] says I was listening to a message
[57:12] brother Brandon was and and he got to
[57:14] part in the in the prayer request he
[57:16] said you that are listening maybe
[57:18] hearing this tape or listening in raise
[57:20] your hand and believe right now so Dad
[57:22] did that for my brother and the time my
[57:24] dad was doing that was the same time my
[57:26] brother was receiving his healing he
[57:28] said all the pain that I was just went
[57:30] away so so I got a chance to talk with
[57:33] him a little bit and could hear the
[57:35] nervousness in his voice and all but he
[57:38] said um I know God answers prayer so
[57:41] preci so keep him in prayer also so if
[57:44] you have a need say Lord I have a need
[57:48] whatever it might be God is let's just
[57:49] bow our heads Lord we we come to you not
[57:53] with a a thought well maybe if God will
[57:56] hear me but Lord with an
[57:58] assurance we come by faith you told us
[58:00] only believe all things are possible
[58:03] Lord so we come to the god that is able
[58:06] that has already made a way has already
[58:08] provided all that we have need of these
[58:11] families that are are hurting and
[58:13] suffering Lord and including the Lopez
[58:16] family who just lost their dad and had a
[58:19] conversation with them today Lord as
[58:20] they make plans and what to do as they
[58:23] go forward in life Lord we we know that
[58:25] without without you it's hopeless but in
[58:27] you we have peace and comfort and joy
[58:29] Lord so meet each one Lord each hand
[58:32] raised each need and request Lord and if
[58:36] anything may it draw them closer to you
[58:37] as our prayer Lord for we ask it in
[58:40] Jesus Christ's name amen thank you you
[58:43] may be
[58:45] seated so today there was a little bit
[58:49] of mix up the preacher sitting in the
[58:51] back row
[58:52] today because brother Matt gave him next
[58:55] Wednesday but told me brother Peter
[58:57] would be speaking tonight so brother
[58:59] Peter was prepared for next
[59:02] Wednesday so it does happen and then we
[59:06] were wondering where brother Matthew was
[59:07] and brother Matthew I forgot he was
[59:09] supposed to be song leading he was down
[59:11] here
[59:12] earlier so there are days like that so I
[59:15] took my Bible and I told brother Jeremy
[59:19] I said if you'll get this prepared we
[59:21] may go that way I told sister Martha she
[59:24] may be on the piano for a little while
[59:26] I told Sarah she might sing
[59:29] tonight sister Lily and
[59:32] Grace not yet she's giving me a strange
[59:36] look there so no and I just said Lord
[59:38] what what do you want us to do so my
[59:41] Bible opens to Romans
[59:42] 8:28 and says all things happen for a
[59:46] reason so I appreciate the good Lord and
[59:48] his grace and his mercy so now Lord
[59:52] willing and brother Jordan was trying to
[59:55] contact
[59:57] brother darl you were not able to get
[59:59] through to him okay brother darl Ward is
[1:00:02] supposed to be with us this coming
[1:00:04] weekend just haven't got a confirmation
[1:00:06] yet so but I'm going to announce that
[1:00:09] he's coming and we're going to believe
[1:00:10] that together all right Sunday morning
[1:00:12] Sunday evening brother Daryl Ward from
[1:00:13] brother Donnie Reagan's church it's been
[1:00:15] the plans it's somebody that personally
[1:00:17] I had been wanting to come over the last
[1:00:20] couple years and I talked to him a CLE
[1:00:23] times and and he was quite busy hard to
[1:00:26] hard to get you know set up and had them
[1:00:28] prepared to come and then the co
[1:00:30] situation come up and had to postpone it
[1:00:32] so Lord willing brother Daryl will be
[1:00:34] with us this coming Sunday both services
[1:00:37] and then next Wednesday night as I spoke
[1:00:39] with brother Matt we were cancelling the
[1:00:41] Wednesday night service before
[1:00:42] Thanksgiving knowing people traveling
[1:00:44] and all so brother Peter next Wednesday
[1:00:47] night if you want to come I don't know
[1:00:49] that anybody will be here so told
[1:00:51] Brother Peter to be ready tonight cuz he
[1:00:53] might get called on also brother green
[1:00:56] used to do something to us and and Sarah
[1:00:58] if you would prepare sing a song and
[1:01:01] she'll sing something that you can play
[1:01:03] she she said she would um brother green
[1:01:06] would would take us Minister sometimes
[1:01:08] and we'd meet in his office and he'd
[1:01:11] look at us and he'd hand us a scripture
[1:01:13] the four of us five of us that were
[1:01:14] there they say you got 10 minutes
[1:01:16] tonight to speak on this
[1:01:19] scripture or he would say here's a quote
[1:01:21] tell the
[1:01:23] congregation what it means to you so you
[1:01:26] had to be ready
[1:01:28] so sister Grace was coming in I said
[1:01:31] sister Grace you better pray somebody's
[1:01:32] coming in after you because the last one
[1:01:34] in today has to sing a song special and
[1:01:37] she said Eunice and your daughter are
[1:01:39] behind me and she smiled and walked
[1:01:41] on so I got away with that one but God
[1:01:45] is mindful of us is he not he's he said
[1:01:48] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:01:51] of the world so we'll we'll let sing a
[1:01:53] song and then brother Peter
[1:01:56] if you would come up after that and just
[1:01:58] share a testimony share a praise
[1:02:01] something and then sister Lydia if you
[1:02:03] would have a song all right cuz you're
[1:02:06] one that told me I could call on you so
[1:02:07] I'm taking advantage of it thank
[1:02:19] you I hope it's okay to say this um I
[1:02:22] was thinking that my dad was going to
[1:02:24] call on me I just had a feeling and I
[1:02:25] thought I'll better have something um to
[1:02:29] sing and uh I just wanted to mention um
[1:02:33] how much I appreciate the Lord for
[1:02:35] giving us songs in the night and that
[1:02:37] literally means in the night for me I'm
[1:02:39] often up at night because I suffer with
[1:02:41] insomnia um from some of the side
[1:02:43] effects of some drugs I have to take and
[1:02:46] um when I mean I'm awake in the night I
[1:02:48] usually am asleep during the day
[1:02:52] completely so 10:00 at night is good
[1:02:54] morning to me
[1:02:56] and um I always appreciate you know it's
[1:02:59] a very lonely time nobody else is awake
[1:03:01] I can't talk to anybody I can't do
[1:03:03] anything you know too loud I live in
[1:03:05] apartment complex and I do sing a lot
[1:03:08] through the night and I often think of
[1:03:10] the Psalms where David says Lord you
[1:03:12] give us songs in the night and you're
[1:03:14] aware of us in the night um so this song
[1:03:17] always has meant much to me because of
[1:03:20] that so I pray it blesses you and please
[1:03:22] sing along it's one we all know God
[1:03:23] leads us along

[1:10:01] brother Aaron if I could preach for a
[1:10:02] little bit so he he said I could so if
[1:10:06] the musicians want to sit down for a few
[1:10:07] minutes I came totally unprepared but I
[1:10:11] just feel like the lord gave me a little
[1:10:13] bit to speak so maybe it'll be uh really
[1:10:15] short but I just pray that the Lord has
[1:10:17] his
[1:10:18] way um let's just
[1:10:22] pray let let's stand and pray if you
[1:10:24] would
[1:10:28] Lord
[1:10:30] Jesus we're so totally inadequate in
[1:10:34] ourselves but Lord You're the well that
[1:10:35] never runs dry amen and every time we're
[1:10:38] in need of water the water of your word
[1:10:41] every time we're in need of
[1:10:43] Life father you've never failed us
[1:10:46] once and Lord even if we were just to
[1:10:49] get up and and testify of how good
[1:10:51] you've been to us Lord that your mercy
[1:10:54] has rewrote Our Lives
[1:10:56] not just once but every day Lord your
[1:10:58] mercy is what's keeping us from falling
[1:11:01] Lord from backsliding and just from
[1:11:04] utter destruction father it's your mercy
[1:11:07] that you chose us father not by any good
[1:11:10] of our own but just by by your great
[1:11:14] knowledge Lord your for knowledge and
[1:11:16] your election father that you chose us
[1:11:19] to be your
[1:11:21] people Lord help us just to surrender
[1:11:24] everything to tonight help me not to
[1:11:27] speak my own thoughts or words but Lord
[1:11:29] let your spirit come and move in our
[1:11:33] midst Lord open this Word of Life To Us
[1:11:35] father for a few minutes here just pray
[1:11:38] that you'd move supernaturally and speak
[1:11:40] to our hearts as only you can we know
[1:11:43] that you're the same yesterday today and
[1:11:44] forever and we commit everything into
[1:11:46] your hands father let it be for your
[1:11:47] glory and your honor in Jesus name amen
[1:11:52] let's just turn while you're standing to
[1:11:53] Hebrews chapter 11
[1:11:56] and we're going to pick up a little bit
[1:11:58] where our brother Diggs uh left
[1:12:03] off Hebrews chap
[1:12:06] 11 and we'll
[1:12:08] read starting from
[1:12:10] 23 and we'll read through
[1:12:19] 26 I heard it said one time that to
[1:12:22] prepare a sermon that's uh 15 minutes it
[1:12:24] can take 3 hours but then if you only
[1:12:27] prepare for 15 for a 15 minutes then it
[1:12:31] can be a three-hour sermon so this one
[1:12:34] could be pretty long but I'll I'll
[1:12:36] definitely try not to do
[1:12:38] that it says by faith
[1:12:41] Moses when he was born was hid three
[1:12:44] months of his parents because they saw
[1:12:47] he was a proper child and they were not
[1:12:50] afraid of the king's
[1:12:53] commandment so that's the part one we
[1:12:55] heard brother Diggs speak on that but
[1:12:58] then part two of Moses's story in in
[1:13:01] verse 24 says by faith Moses when he was
[1:13:04] come to
[1:13:05] years refused to be called the son of
[1:13:08] Pharaoh's
[1:13:09] daughter choosing rather to suffer
[1:13:12] afflictions Affliction with the people
[1:13:14] of God than to enjoy the pleasures of
[1:13:17] sin for a
[1:13:19] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:13:22] greater riches than the treasures of
[1:13:24] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[1:13:27] recompense of the
[1:13:30] reward amen may the Lord add his
[1:13:32] Blessing to the reading of his word and
[1:13:33] you may be
[1:13:35] seated I just wanted to speak for a few
[1:13:38] minutes on uh a question and the
[1:13:43] question is who are
[1:13:45] you and the the subtitle would be the
[1:13:48] Eternal
[1:13:49] choice you know so
[1:13:51] many um
[1:13:55] so many things in this world are for a
[1:13:58] season just like it says there that
[1:14:00] Moses could have chosen the pleasures of
[1:14:02] sin for a
[1:14:04] season and that's the way that most of
[1:14:07] the world works is seasonally getting
[1:14:09] ready for the seasons we look to see
[1:14:11] what's coming in the near future and we
[1:14:13] prepare for it if we're in the rainy
[1:14:14] season then we prepare for rain and if
[1:14:17] we're in the cold season uh we prepare
[1:14:20] for the cold and in the heat the the
[1:14:23] summer we get our swamp cool and air our
[1:14:26] air conditioning units all tuned up for
[1:14:29] that season we look at the election
[1:14:32] season and Everyone is always talking
[1:14:35] about what's going to happen with before
[1:14:38] the election it was all they could talk
[1:14:39] about for a year that election season
[1:14:41] coming up getting ready for this
[1:14:45] season and that's natural to look at at
[1:14:48] these seasonal things what's what's the
[1:14:51] near future and how can we get ready for
[1:14:53] them
[1:14:55] but what Moses
[1:14:58] chose was something Eternal he didn't
[1:15:02] just look at the season of his life the
[1:15:04] season of the next couple years of his
[1:15:06] life or even his whole life but by faith
[1:15:11] he had a revelation from
[1:15:13] God that that's not who he
[1:15:17] was and that's what it came down to at
[1:15:19] the end of Moses's story it wasn't that
[1:15:23] Moses could figure out you know the best
[1:15:25] thing for the season the best way to
[1:15:29] have an easy life or a good life or to
[1:15:32] try to make himself
[1:15:34] remembered but the most important
[1:15:37] realization that Moses had was that he
[1:15:41] wasn't the son of Pharaoh's daughter who
[1:15:45] the world thought he was and who he was
[1:15:47] presented
[1:15:49] as it
[1:15:51] wasn't who he was it was revealed to him
[1:15:54] that he should be
[1:15:56] see he knew that there was something
[1:15:58] different there and so he had this
[1:16:01] choice that he could make he could
[1:16:02] either continue
[1:16:04] on in this great life that he had it
[1:16:08] seemed like you know he the blessing of
[1:16:11] God was there through the the choices of
[1:16:13] his mother putting him into the Nile and
[1:16:16] he could have just lived the rest of his
[1:16:19] life on that and said well you know the
[1:16:21] Lord spared me and um he made me the son
[1:16:25] of pharaoh so who am I to say different
[1:16:27] let me just live this easy life that the
[1:16:30] Lord has blessed me with let me just
[1:16:32] live this Royal life let me be the son
[1:16:35] of Pharaoh let my name be great and I'll
[1:16:37] build some monuments and win some Wars
[1:16:40] and I'll try to do some
[1:16:43] good but that's not who he was it's not
[1:16:46] who he was made to be he was
[1:16:49] made to have he was
[1:16:53] made so that his choices could have an
[1:16:56] eternal
[1:16:57] impact and the choices that we make do
[1:17:02] have an eternal impact the choice of who
[1:17:06] we are and who we are determines what
[1:17:09] we're going to
[1:17:10] be who we are determines what we're
[1:17:12] going to
[1:17:13] do see Moses once he he surrendered to
[1:17:19] that that he wasn't going to be the son
[1:17:21] of
[1:17:22] pharaoh then the Lord
[1:17:25] didn't use his way Moses's way totally
[1:17:28] failed the Lord used a totally different
[1:17:30] way but the Lord was able to use his
[1:17:33] choice that he chose the Eternal thing
[1:17:39] amen and just think about what the world
[1:17:43] would look like if Moses hadn't made
[1:17:44] that choice not to be called the son of
[1:17:47] Pharaoh's daughter maybe he could have
[1:17:50] helped Egypt to grow greater maybe he
[1:17:53] could have helped things to be a little
[1:17:54] bit better for the
[1:17:57] Israelites but if he hadn't surrendered
[1:18:00] to the will of God and been used by God
[1:18:03] to deliver these
[1:18:05] people we wouldn't have Israel we
[1:18:08] wouldn't have the stories of David
[1:18:11] and and the stories of the prophets we
[1:18:14] wouldn't
[1:18:16] have you know this whole plan of
[1:18:21] History his his choice impacted all of
[1:18:26] history to choose the harder way to
[1:18:29] choose to to give aside the
[1:18:32] Royal the Royal lifestyle that he
[1:18:37] had and to choose to be that deliverer
[1:18:40] that God had had
[1:18:43] Chosen and uh a lot of times people
[1:18:46] think that to to come to the realization
[1:18:50] of who we are in Christ is going to make
[1:18:52] things greater and it's going to make us
[1:18:56] easier make the Our Lives
[1:18:59] easier but if if you choose to be who
[1:19:03] the Bible says you are a son or a
[1:19:05] daughter of
[1:19:06] God if that's your
[1:19:08] choice it's going to make your life
[1:19:11] harder Moses forsook all this the
[1:19:14] pleasures of Egypt the pleasures of
[1:19:18] sin his life got so much harder he had
[1:19:21] to go and work he had to flee for his
[1:19:26] life when we
[1:19:29] choose our identity in
[1:19:33] Christ it's the harder Choice it's the
[1:19:37] choice of the reproach of
[1:19:39] Christ there's a a
[1:19:42] scripture
[1:19:44] in James chapter
[1:19:47] 4 and verse 4
[1:19:55] and it
[1:19:58] says ye adulterers and
[1:20:01] adulteresses know you not that the
[1:20:03] Friendship of the world is emnity with
[1:20:06] God whosoever therefore will be a friend
[1:20:08] of the world is the enemy of
[1:20:12] God see a lot of people want to stay the
[1:20:16] son of Pharaoh's daughter and be the
[1:20:19] deliver they want to have it both ways
[1:20:21] you can't have it both ways either
[1:20:23] you're going to be be successful by the
[1:20:26] world's
[1:20:30] standards to accomplish the calling that
[1:20:33] God has put on your
[1:20:35] life or if you choose the things of
[1:20:40] God usually you'll end up a failure to
[1:20:42] the World by the world's standards you
[1:20:45] know if the world speak well of you
[1:20:48] that's not a good
[1:20:49] thing the world should hate us the world
[1:20:52] should ridicule the way that we live our
[1:20:54] Liv our lives but so many times we want
[1:20:56] to try
[1:20:58] to to be both want to try to still be
[1:21:02] the Prince of Egypt and the deliverer
[1:21:03] that's what Moses tried he tried to by
[1:21:06] his own might and strength set the the
[1:21:08] children of Israel free they totally
[1:21:10] failed the Lord had to take 40 years in
[1:21:13] the desert to get that out of
[1:21:16] him he had to just
[1:21:20] be surrendered to God had to choose that
[1:21:23] harder way
[1:21:25] yes and in our lives you know so many
[1:21:29] times we try to to have our identity
[1:21:33] just be the
[1:21:35] mix ex just good enough at church and
[1:21:39] good enough with the things of the
[1:21:42] world but who I am in the
[1:21:47] word is to be totally surrendered to
[1:21:52] Christ my eyes to totally on
[1:21:55] him to to turn aside all the the
[1:21:58] easiness of this lifestyle we have it so
[1:22:00] easy in in this life you know just to be
[1:22:03] Americans just to be living in the 21st
[1:22:07] century we have it so
[1:22:09] easy but will
[1:22:11] you give up that
[1:22:13] identity and let your identity be one of
[1:22:18] surrender
[1:22:20] because Moses's life as as a prince of
[1:22:23] Egypt it was only for a season but his
[1:22:27] choice had Eternal
[1:22:30] ramifications and when we when we choose
[1:22:33] the way of the
[1:22:36] Lord it the choices have eternal results
[1:22:39] because it impacts people right see
[1:22:43] Moses could have built the big uh
[1:22:45] monuments that everyone else was
[1:22:47] building in Egypt to be remembered by
[1:22:50] and those are all buried underneath the
[1:22:52] sand and decaying there's this this law
[1:22:55] of of decay in in the world brother
[1:22:58] Matthew was talking about this law of
[1:23:00] Decay where things will just go to
[1:23:04] nothing nothing in this world lasts it's
[1:23:06] all for a
[1:23:07] season but see because Moses's
[1:23:11] Choice was for
[1:23:14] people it was to deliver the people of
[1:23:17] God well those people are still around
[1:23:20] today they're like the Sands of the sea
[1:23:23] in number
[1:23:25] yes see and when you choose the way of
[1:23:27] the Lord when you choose to surrender to
[1:23:31] this the Lord will use that to bless his
[1:23:34] people think of your children and and
[1:23:36] the ones that are are going to be
[1:23:38] affected by your
[1:23:40] life the things of this world will pass
[1:23:42] away but one soul is worth 10,000 worlds
[1:23:47] and so whatever you can give of your
[1:23:49] life just to to bless One Soul just to
[1:23:52] help
[1:23:53] somebody a lot of times we think about
[1:23:55] coming to church and and we walk away
[1:23:58] and think well what blessing did I get
[1:24:00] from church what uh you know what did I
[1:24:03] Come Away
[1:24:04] with but we don't always think about was
[1:24:08] I able to help somebody was I able to
[1:24:11] lift somebody up was I able to be an
[1:24:12] encouragement to somebody at church were
[1:24:15] you able to to
[1:24:16] give see we don't come to church just to
[1:24:19] take but we come we come to give to give
[1:24:23] praise to God to lift his name up to
[1:24:26] give to one another find out is there a
[1:24:28] need does your brother or sister have a
[1:24:30] need do they just need somebody to talk
[1:24:32] to to fellowship with and that's not
[1:24:35] just in church but in our interactions
[1:24:38] one with another how can we be a
[1:24:40] servant because those choices are
[1:24:45] Eternal where you can focus on laying
[1:24:49] down your life for your
[1:24:51] friends and uh
[1:24:55] was thinking of the other examples in
[1:24:58] the Bible of where there is similar
[1:25:01] choices
[1:25:03] where people
[1:25:06] chose the harder
[1:25:08] way to to save their people and one
[1:25:11] that's similar to Moses is the story of
[1:25:14] Esther you know she was also in the
[1:25:16] Royal house and and they said that she
[1:25:19] was the queen they didn't know that she
[1:25:21] was a
[1:25:22] Jew but when it came down to it it she
[1:25:25] risked everything she risked her life
[1:25:27] her luxury everything to say no I'm a
[1:25:31] Jew these are my people she risked it
[1:25:35] all but look at the
[1:25:37] Eternal blessing because of that that
[1:25:41] she was able to save her people think of
[1:25:43] if she had just lived in her life of
[1:25:45] luxury and she hadn't
[1:25:48] chose to be who God had made her to
[1:25:52] be think of all the Jews that would have
[1:25:54] been killed because of
[1:25:57] hmon but she said I'm not I'm not just
[1:26:00] the queen I'm a
[1:26:03] Jew think of John the Baptist you know
[1:26:06] he was born the son of the high priest
[1:26:09] that's probably about the closest thing
[1:26:11] that they had to a royal family there in
[1:26:15] in Israel in that time he could have
[1:26:17] lived you know a blessed life maybe he
[1:26:20] could have been a high priest if he had
[1:26:22] stuck around and just been who everyone
[1:26:24] said he was to be but he found in the
[1:26:29] word that there was to be one a voice of
[1:26:31] one crying in the wilderness prepare you
[1:26:34] the way of the Lord and he said that's
[1:26:36] who I am I'm not supposed to be in their
[1:26:41] seminaries and their
[1:26:43] theologies but he chose to live such a
[1:26:47] poor life he basically chose to be
[1:26:49] homeless because he he identified
[1:26:52] himself with this word
[1:26:55] but look at
[1:26:57] the the Eternal role that he
[1:27:00] played in preparing the way for the
[1:27:03] Lord getting the the hearts of the
[1:27:06] people
[1:27:07] right
[1:27:09] and you know he he had by the world
[1:27:12] standards a horrible life he was
[1:27:16] imprisoned he was
[1:27:19] beheaded but what a blessing his eternal
[1:27:22] reward will be
[1:27:24] what a blessing it was just to to
[1:27:28] baptize the Lord
[1:27:30] Jesus see his eyes were on on that
[1:27:33] Eternal and not on this life of
[1:27:37] Seasons looking at just the the seasons
[1:27:40] of his
[1:27:41] life he had a
[1:27:44] revelation and he made that choice
[1:27:46] another one don't worry I'm almost
[1:27:49] done George
[1:27:51] Washington and the founding fathers
[1:27:55] know they were called British subjects
[1:27:58] they were called to be you know part of
[1:28:01] this great Empire in the world and a lot
[1:28:05] of these men like George
[1:28:07] Washington things were fine for them
[1:28:09] they were most of the the influential
[1:28:12] founding fathers they were wealthy
[1:28:14] enough to have a good life they weren't
[1:28:16] slaves or anything like
[1:28:20] that but they had to come to the place
[1:28:22] where they found their identity was
[1:28:23] different
[1:28:24] than the identity that they were they
[1:28:27] born
[1:28:28] with they said no we're not British
[1:28:31] subjects were to be Americans and
[1:28:34] because of that look how much harder
[1:28:36] their life came became when they signed
[1:28:39] the Declaration of Independence they
[1:28:41] were signing their own death
[1:28:44] warrant they were signing for their sons
[1:28:46] to be killed in battle many of them to
[1:28:50] they were going to lose everything but
[1:28:52] it was worth it to them
[1:28:55] because they were
[1:28:58] Americans it's like the eagle in the
[1:29:00] chicken
[1:29:02] yard you know life in a chicken yard's
[1:29:04] pretty
[1:29:05] easy they throw the food out to you they
[1:29:08] put the water out to you they clean up
[1:29:10] after
[1:29:11] you you're gonna end up eating they
[1:29:15] don't really tell you
[1:29:16] that but other than that you know a
[1:29:20] chicken yard chicken only has one bad
[1:29:22] day in their life it's the last one
[1:29:25] everything other than that's pretty
[1:29:27] good an eagle he's always got to go and
[1:29:31] find his
[1:29:32] food fly around for it he's got he's got
[1:29:36] no chicken Coupe to come back to he's
[1:29:38] got to Brave the
[1:29:40] weather but that eagle in the Barnard
[1:29:43] said no I'm not made for this chicken
[1:29:46] yard I'm made to be an
[1:29:52] eagle just like the the slave in the
[1:29:55] story we know the story where the the
[1:29:58] slave had such a good work ethic because
[1:30:01] he knew he was the father of a
[1:30:04] king well you know we think of that and
[1:30:07] oh that's that's great he he really
[1:30:10] showed them and he was unbroken but what
[1:30:13] that actually looked like for that slave
[1:30:15] was he was working way harder than
[1:30:17] anyone else it wasn't that they said oh
[1:30:19] you're the son of a king here's your
[1:30:21] special bunk and here's a little extra
[1:30:23] food and we're glad that you know you're
[1:30:25] the son of a king life is going to be
[1:30:26] easier for
[1:30:28] you but no it meant that when they were
[1:30:31] moving something he was grabbing the
[1:30:32] heavy
[1:30:33] end it meant when the person next to
[1:30:36] them couldn't finish their job he was
[1:30:38] there working
[1:30:40] double he was
[1:30:43] there making it harder on himself
[1:30:46] choosing the harder
[1:30:49] way but think of
[1:30:51] the Eternal
[1:30:54] ramifications of that
[1:30:56] choice think about maybe he had a
[1:31:00] son and think of how different it could
[1:31:02] have been if his son saw Dad
[1:31:05] defeated just trudging
[1:31:08] along think of how that can affect
[1:31:11] Generations just to to give
[1:31:14] up keep your head down be what the world
[1:31:17] says you're to
[1:31:20] be then the sun gives up a little bit
[1:31:24] and generations and generations can be
[1:31:27] affected just
[1:31:28] by the choices of one person can trickle
[1:31:31] down for a long time but think about
[1:31:35] because he chose to work hard he chose
[1:31:38] to to do the harder way to care for his
[1:31:43] people think of the generations that
[1:31:45] could could still follow in those
[1:31:48] footsteps think of his sons that could
[1:31:51] rise up and and uh say Well I'm the the
[1:31:54] grandson of a king and they could they
[1:31:58] could go and keep that Legacy
[1:32:00] going that his reward
[1:32:04] wasn't the work that he could do for the
[1:32:06] the
[1:32:08] master master was a bad slave owner he
[1:32:12] was a bad man an evil
[1:32:14] man but see the blessings from that
[1:32:17] choice was the people around him could
[1:32:20] look to him and they could be encouraged
[1:32:23] they could be blessed they could receive
[1:32:24] strength they could be helped maybe he
[1:32:27] could spare them some whipping because
[1:32:29] he he covered for them maybe because he
[1:32:32] worked so hard his sons never gave up
[1:32:36] maybe a couple Generations
[1:32:38] later his sons were were still doing you
[1:32:42] know working hard being proud instead of
[1:32:45] just being
[1:32:47] defeated not
[1:32:50] trying and then the Supreme example of
[1:32:54] one that chose his identity the harder
[1:32:58] way just like Moses and Esther left the
[1:33:01] riches of the palace would be
[1:33:04] Jesus he didn't choose the
[1:33:07] identity of
[1:33:10] God but he said no I'm going to come in
[1:33:12] the form of a man I'm going to lower
[1:33:15] myself going to come down as they
[1:33:18] are he didn't just from Heaven make a
[1:33:22] way for us but he said no I'll I'll go
[1:33:24] be the way I'm not going to send a
[1:33:27] sacrifice from there I'm going to go be
[1:33:28] the sacrifice that's our example that we
[1:33:32] can go and humble ourselves like he
[1:33:34] humbled himself leave all the riches all
[1:33:38] the the Easy Life
[1:33:41] Style say no going to go walk among
[1:33:47] them he he went down and was tempted in
[1:33:50] every way right every way whatever going
[1:33:54] through like nobody knows what I've I've
[1:33:56] gone
[1:33:58] through Jesus
[1:34:00] knows he's been
[1:34:02] there he knows what it's like to stub
[1:34:05] his toe he knows what it's like to be
[1:34:07] yelled at when he didn't do anything
[1:34:09] wrong knows what it's like to be hated
[1:34:11] for no reason to be talked badly
[1:34:16] against you know he he experienced all
[1:34:19] that so that when we need a helper when
[1:34:21] we need a savior when we need a friend
[1:34:24] say oh Lord you
[1:34:25] know you've been
[1:34:28] there you didn't just see all this from
[1:34:31] up above but you came
[1:34:33] and you got your feet dirty in the dust
[1:34:37] of everyday
[1:34:38] living he chose
[1:34:42] that he chose to be that Ram caught in
[1:34:47] the Thorns by his horns his strength his
[1:34:52] love to know I'm going to go down and
[1:34:54] humble
[1:34:56] myself so we have many examples of this
[1:35:00] in the
[1:35:01] Bible but who are we who are
[1:35:05] you you know there's
[1:35:08] uh
[1:35:09] in
[1:35:11] Revelation The Book of
[1:35:21] Revelation in 2
[1:35:27] 217 there's a verse that says and the
[1:35:31] spirit and the bride say
[1:35:36] come is that who you are are you that
[1:35:39] bride that's saying come Lord
[1:35:41] Jesus is that what your life is showing
[1:35:45] it convicts me to say that because a lot
[1:35:47] of times that's not what my life is
[1:35:50] saying the way that I live my life isn't
[1:35:52] saying come Lord Jesus
[1:35:54] come right this minute come right this
[1:35:56] hour you'll find me perfectly ready
[1:35:58] you'll find my heart right you'll find
[1:35:59] me about your
[1:36:03] kingdom I'll be honest a lot of times
[1:36:06] that's not what my life is saying maybe
[1:36:08] my words are saying
[1:36:11] that but to become that to become that
[1:36:16] bride that's echoing the spirit saying
[1:36:20] come it's the harder way it's the way
[1:36:23] way that looks so foolish to this world
[1:36:27] it's to leave the easy lifestyle that we
[1:36:29] have and to go down and get dirty help
[1:36:33] people to work all day and sometimes all
[1:36:37] night to take the stripes on your back
[1:36:41] for your
[1:36:43] friends who are
[1:36:45] you are you just another American that
[1:36:48] was born a life of
[1:36:51] luxury or are you that Queen
[1:36:55] that
[1:36:55] says I'm one of them and if it costs me
[1:36:58] my life it costs me my
[1:37:01] life are you that one that will sign
[1:37:04] online and say I'm an American even if
[1:37:08] it's total Destruction for
[1:37:12] me is your
[1:37:15] identity in this book or just the same
[1:37:19] as everyone
[1:37:22] else Let's uh let's just pray maybe as
[1:37:26] uh maybe Lydia can come up and sing a
[1:37:30] song Maybe if the musicians want to come
[1:37:35] back let's just pray
[1:37:38] Lord just an odd
[1:37:41] little sermon tonight
[1:37:45] but believe that you laid it on my heart
[1:37:47] for somebody maybe just for
[1:37:50] me but Lord we want to choose you to
[1:37:55] choose the Eternal not to live for this
[1:37:59] season of sin season of
[1:38:03] pleasure but Lord we want our lives to
[1:38:05] count for something we know that if we
[1:38:08] seek to save our lives we'll lose it but
[1:38:10] if we give them up you can make
[1:38:13] something beautiful of
[1:38:16] them Lord we're just so glad that
[1:38:19] you show us by your word that we're not
[1:38:22] meant to just live live like everyone
[1:38:25] else but we're meant to go the harder
[1:38:27] way to lay our lives down
[1:38:31] and to surrender to your
[1:38:34] will pray you'd help us each one father
[1:38:36] and just bless the remainder of this
[1:38:38] this service whatever your plan is for
[1:38:40] tonight Lord we just look to you and
[1:38:43] thank you Father for your name is great
[1:38:45] and greatly to be praised thank you for
[1:38:47] the work that you're doing in each one
[1:38:49] of our Lives you said that you that
[1:38:51] started the good work would finish it
[1:38:53] and we're trusting in that father thank
[1:38:56] you Lord Jesus name amen
[1:39:27] God bless you all um I had actually been
[1:39:31] playing a song earlier in the day and um
[1:39:34] I thought maybe someday I would sing it
[1:39:36] but I couldn't have guessed it would be
[1:39:38] tonight
[1:39:39] so um I just want to give a really quick
[1:39:42] testimony it's really close to my heart
[1:39:45] um but I really feel like the Lord wants
[1:39:47] me to share it and I knew I would
[1:39:49] someday so um a few weeks back I had
[1:39:55] been it's kind of hard to explain
[1:39:58] basically just getting down and um it
[1:40:01] started off with just maybe a small
[1:40:03] negative thought you get caught up with
[1:40:06] being a mother and your house is a mess
[1:40:09] and your children are screaming and you
[1:40:11] let a little negative thought come in
[1:40:12] your head and then the next day it's a
[1:40:17] little bit bigger of a thought and
[1:40:19] bigger and as the week went on I was
[1:40:22] just finding myself having terrible
[1:40:24] thoughts and I'm usually pretty upbeat
[1:40:27] that I was just irrational thoughts as I
[1:40:29] look back on it that you know it was
[1:40:32] just the devil that I was unfit to be a
[1:40:34] mother and you know if I did something
[1:40:37] wrong they take my kids away just
[1:40:39] bizarre things that weren't
[1:40:42] God and I had I had seen some stuff um
[1:40:47] social media some really heavy dark
[1:40:49] stuff
[1:40:50] that um just I didn't mean to see it but
[1:40:54] it wasn't edifying and it was just
[1:40:56] there's a lot of hard things happening
[1:40:59] in the world and I just stumbled across
[1:41:01] some articles about some really sad
[1:41:03] stuff that happened and it was really
[1:41:05] weighing me down and before I knew it it
[1:41:08] felt like there were just bricks on my
[1:41:10] shoulders and chest and it was just
[1:41:13] overwhelming
[1:41:15] um don't worry there's a really good end
[1:41:18] this
[1:41:19] story so um Peter had to go do something
[1:41:22] in the even
[1:41:24] and um I had a whole evening plan I'd
[1:41:27] put the kids to bed and I'd get these
[1:41:30] things done that I wanted to do
[1:41:33] and when he got back I hadn't I didn't
[1:41:36] do any of it I just I gotten so sad and
[1:41:40] um you know rather than reading my Bible
[1:41:43] and listening to sermons I just found
[1:41:45] myself wasting more time to distracted
[1:41:47] from my problems and when he got back I
[1:41:50] was really as you would say in a dark
[1:41:53] spot and um
[1:41:57] so I talked a little bit and then we
[1:41:59] just did our evening devotions like we
[1:42:02] always do and when we went to pray I um
[1:42:06] I asked them if I could pray and I mean
[1:42:09] I just felt the weight of the world on
[1:42:11] my shoulders it was just such a scary
[1:42:14] dark dark world to raise my family in
[1:42:17] and it was just overwhelming it's the
[1:42:19] only way you can put it because once you
[1:42:21] give heed to the devil's thoughts
[1:42:23] how can you see anything but darkness
[1:42:26] and all of a sudden while I'm
[1:42:31] praying the words weren't mine
[1:42:34] anymore um and to man to ear you
[1:42:38] wouldn't be able to understand them but
[1:42:41] the
[1:42:43] Lord he gave me these words to pray and
[1:42:46] it was just and I've never I've only
[1:42:50] ever really worshiped like that but to
[1:42:52] pray was such a heaviness it was kind of
[1:42:55] scary to me praying in tongues and but
[1:42:59] just such a heaviness and I didn't have
[1:43:01] the words to say it was just utter
[1:43:04] desperation and then I finished and I
[1:43:07] felt so much better that the Lord had
[1:43:09] given me the words to pray when I didn't
[1:43:12] have them on my
[1:43:13] own and then um Peter flipped open the
[1:43:17] Bible just completely
[1:43:19] randomly and I had to keep asking them
[1:43:21] the whole time he was reading the
[1:43:24] the chapter he read because I couldn't
[1:43:25] believe that he had just picked that so
[1:43:29] I'm going to read as fast as I can
[1:43:31] because um I really can't leave out any
[1:43:35] telling you the backstory it was just
[1:43:37] God directly speaking to me and I will
[1:43:39] never forget it and I've read it so many
[1:43:41] times since because when God handwrites
[1:43:44] a love letter to you so perfect in
[1:43:47] Tim I mean you can show it straight to
[1:43:50] the devil every
[1:43:52] time so it's um Psalms
[1:43:55] 116 I love the Lord because he ha heard
[1:43:57] my voice and my supplications because he
[1:44:00] hath inclined his ear unto me therefore
[1:44:02] I will call upon him as long as I live
[1:44:05] the Sorrows of death compassed me and
[1:44:07] the Pains of Hell got hold of me and I
[1:44:08] found trouble and sorrow then called I
[1:44:11] upon the name of the Lord oh Lord I
[1:44:13] beseech thee deliver my soul I mean this
[1:44:15] is like exactly when it just happened 5
[1:44:18] minutes before gracious is the Lord and
[1:44:21] righteous say our God is merciful Lord
[1:44:23] preserveth the simp while I was brought
[1:44:25] low and he helped me return return unto
[1:44:28] thy rest oh my soul for the Lord hath
[1:44:30] dealt bound to flee with thee for thou
[1:44:33] Hast delivered my soul from Death my
[1:44:35] eyes from tear and my feet from
[1:44:39] falling I
[1:44:44] will I will walk before the Lord in the
[1:44:47] land of the living I believe therefore
[1:44:50] have I spoken I was greatly Afflicted I
[1:44:52] said in my my heast sto men are
[1:44:56] liars what shall I Render unto thee for
[1:44:59] all these benefits toward me I will take
[1:45:01] the cup of Salvation and call upon the
[1:45:02] name of the Lord I will pay my vows unto
[1:45:04] the Lord now in the presence of all his
[1:45:06] people precious is the sight of the Lord
[1:45:08] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[1:45:10] death of his Saints and I had always
[1:45:12] taken that very literal but in that
[1:45:13] moment it was absolutely death to self
[1:45:16] and um oh Lord truly I am thy servant I
[1:45:19] am thy servant the son of thine handmade
[1:45:22] thou Hast loose my bonds I will offer to
[1:45:25] thee a sacrifice of Thanksgiving I will
[1:45:26] call upon the name of the Lord I will
[1:45:28] pay my vows unto the Lord now in the
[1:45:30] presence of all his people in the courts
[1:45:32] of the Lord's House in the midst of thee
[1:45:34] Oh Jerusalem praise ye the Lord and I
[1:45:37] cannot tell you Night and
[1:45:41] Day from the beginning of those
[1:45:44] devotions to the end I mean it was just
[1:45:47] talk about being brought from Darkness
[1:45:49] into light the weight of the world is
[1:45:52] lifted on my should shoulders and it was
[1:45:54] really a stake in the ground in my life
[1:45:57] and
[1:45:58] um and then this song kind of goes
[1:46:01] really hand in hand and I've only ever
[1:46:03] played through it once so I hope it's
[1:46:16] okay not because I've been so
[1:46:21] faithful nothing because I've been so
[1:46:25] good you've always been there for me to
[1:46:30] provide my every need you were there
[1:46:34] when I was
[1:46:36] lonely you were there in all my
[1:46:41] pain guiding my
[1:46:45] footsteps Shelter From the rain and it
[1:46:49] was you
[1:46:53] you made my life
[1:46:56] complete you are to me my
[1:47:00] everything and that is why I
[1:47:06] sing Jesus I love
[1:47:10] you because you

[1:47:17] imagine if you weren
[1:47:21] there Jesus I love

[1:47:32] imagine if you were in
[1:47:36] there you are the joy of my
[1:47:39] salvation you're the peace in my storm
[1:47:44] your loving arms Protect Me Shelter From
[1:47:50] the horn you are all and
[1:47:54] Omega the beginning and the
[1:47:58] end my strong
[1:48:01] tower my dearest and best friend and it
[1:48:06] was
[1:48:09] you you made my life
[1:48:13] complete you are to me my everything and
[1:48:18] that is why I sing
[1:48:23] Jesus I love
[1:48:25] you because you
[1:48:29] care I couldn't
[1:48:32] imagine if you were in
[1:48:36] there Jesus I love

[1:49:10] love you I love you Jesus I love
[1:49:15] you because you care
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:26] [Applause]
[1:49:35] the things we appreciate the most are
[1:49:38] the things that we've had to battle to
[1:49:40] get
[1:49:42] to when you've spent your money to
[1:49:45] buy what you
[1:49:47] wanted you share a a whole lot more
[1:49:49] you take care of it a lot more than once
[1:49:52] somebody else buys it for you maybe as a
[1:49:54] child your parents bought it and but
[1:49:57] when you've worked hard and you've
[1:49:58] earned it it means a little bit more to
[1:50:00] you at that
[1:50:02] point and what a friend we have in Jesus
[1:50:06] let's sing that first verse what a
[1:50:09] friend we have in
[1:50:10] Jesus how many knows him to be a
[1:50:14] friend a a friend that stick us closer
[1:50:17] than a brother
[1:50:20] amen you get that first verse up there
[1:50:23] brother
[1:50:26] Jeremy
[1:50:27] what a friend we have in
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:37] Jesus
[1:50:38] all our sins and grief to
[1:50:47] be
[1:50:48] what a privil
[1:50:52] to
[1:50:55] [Music]
[1:51:00] car to God
[1:51:06] pray
[1:51:08] oh what peace we off
[1:51:13] for
[1:51:16] fa
[1:51:18] oh what needless pains we bear
[1:51:27] oh because we do not
[1:51:32] [Music]
[1:51:38] care to God in
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:44] pray I know I found my myself at times
[1:51:48] doing everything but
[1:51:50] praying how I do this I'm going to do
[1:51:53] that I'm going to take care of this and
[1:51:55] then you turn your heart and say Lord
[1:51:57] I've ignored you in all of this and he
[1:52:00] still
[1:52:01] merciful as brother Peter was speaking
[1:52:04] that song and we won't sing it but the
[1:52:06] words to the chorus he could have called
[1:52:09] 10,000
[1:52:10] angels to destroy this world and set him
[1:52:13] free that would have been the easy
[1:52:16] way he could have called 10,000
[1:52:19] angels but he died alone for for you and
[1:52:23] me and Joshua said it this way choose ye
[1:52:27] this day whom you will
[1:52:29] serve the gods of the amorites the gods
[1:52:32] of your pleasure those things but as for
[1:52:35] me in my house we will serve the Lord so
[1:52:40] appreciate the goodness of the Lord and
[1:52:42] the grace I don't know if that was his
[1:52:45] sermon he was preparing for for his next
[1:52:48] time but that's a good start huh so I'd
[1:52:52] like to share something with
[1:52:54] you brother Jeremy if you'll put up
[1:52:57] Romans 8:28 and and you can stay here on
[1:53:01] the Romans 8:28 a verse we're all very
[1:53:05] familiar
[1:53:06] with and we
[1:53:09] know you know it comes to a point in
[1:53:12] your life that you
[1:53:14] know because you experience
[1:53:16] it not because somebody else told you
[1:53:19] about it but because you've experienced
[1:53:21] that all things work together for good
[1:53:24] to them that love God and who are the
[1:53:28] called according to his
[1:53:30] purpose and I I I find myself right
[1:53:33] there it's not a choice I made but he
[1:53:35] called but how do I respond to that now
[1:53:39] I had something sent to me and I want to
[1:53:41] I want to share this with
[1:53:44] you it it's uh a brother sent this to me
[1:53:48] and he was he said he was hearing
[1:53:51] something and they were talking about
[1:53:52] about
[1:53:53] David he talks about the tremendous
[1:53:56] Pressure David is under and the
[1:53:57] overwhelming odds David's
[1:54:00] faces at uh at the first the pressure is
[1:54:03] a direct attack to on his life it comes
[1:54:05] from in various forms from The Lion The
[1:54:07] Bear Goliath
[1:54:09] Saul then it it when it the situation
[1:54:13] changes when David becomes king so not
[1:54:16] only does David have to look after
[1:54:18] himself but he's responsible for Israel
[1:54:20] now you know
[1:54:22] uh one nation after another steps up to
[1:54:25] threaten and kill the people the last
[1:54:27] area of pressure comes from within in
[1:54:29] his own
[1:54:30] house he says now the people that were
[1:54:33] closest to him turn against him and
[1:54:35] threaten
[1:54:37] him some of of this was his own doing
[1:54:41] and some of it was not and and we
[1:54:43] sometimes get ourselves into problems
[1:54:46] you know it as as I got sick and I and
[1:54:50] began to battle the diabetes and begin
[1:54:52] to realize I caused
[1:54:54] it you know if you drink uh a Dr Pepper
[1:54:58] or two every day that's real
[1:55:00] healthy and it was just good for a
[1:55:03] moment but the consequences of it you
[1:55:06] know so some of it you cause
[1:55:09] yourself he
[1:55:11] says yet through it all David was able
[1:55:14] to praise the Lord and this is the part
[1:55:17] he said David was able to praise the
[1:55:20] Lord he knew who held him up it made me
[1:55:24] think of my own life and pressures can I
[1:55:27] worship the Lord the way David did and
[1:55:31] we hear sister Lydia saying that just
[1:55:33] came up Suddenly and you began to praise
[1:55:36] and and God you began to worship God you
[1:55:39] begin to acknowledge God you begin to
[1:55:41] give him praise and it changes the whole
[1:55:44] atmosphere but you have to choose the
[1:55:47] harder
[1:55:48] way and and
[1:55:51] so think about this and and this is just
[1:55:53] what the brother sent to me and he said
[1:55:55] it made him think about
[1:55:57] diamonds and diamonds are one of the
[1:55:59] most valuable gems that there are in
[1:56:02] this world uh you know you look at the
[1:56:04] diamonds uh somebody what is it in
[1:56:07] Kentucky or somewhere where they they
[1:56:09] can go out and dig for diamonds and they
[1:56:11] find and every once one somebody finds a
[1:56:14] valuable Diamond there it's worth
[1:56:17] thousands and thousands of dollars but
[1:56:20] here's a little bit of of the makeup of
[1:56:22] a
[1:56:24] Diamond they are formed by pressure
[1:56:27] night diamonds have a reputation that
[1:56:29] for being very valuable and they had
[1:56:31] captur one's admiration and
[1:56:35] desire however the diamonds are known
[1:56:37] also for their Incredible strength and
[1:56:40] durability said however the diamond
[1:56:43] forming process is incredible it starts
[1:56:46] in a layer of the Earth crust that is
[1:56:48] very deep holds very high pressure and
[1:56:52] very very high
[1:56:54] heat so if you're becoming a diamond you
[1:56:56] know where you're being
[1:56:58] created not in the pleasures of this
[1:57:00] life and the good things and as brother
[1:57:03] Peter was speaking these things were
[1:57:05] coming to me I was just just had been
[1:57:06] reading this as the brother sent it to
[1:57:08] me in the adversities in the hard times
[1:57:11] in the choice as the the Lord told
[1:57:14] Brother brandom through the through the
[1:57:16] the the the gift that was used because
[1:57:18] you have chosen the harder way he says
[1:57:23] very deep holds very high pressure and
[1:57:26] very high heat and this was taken from a
[1:57:29] Smith's article there described that the
[1:57:31] area where the diamonds are formed no
[1:57:34] man has been able to touch or observe
[1:57:37] due to the depth of the earth not only
[1:57:40] that all the components are needed to
[1:57:43] form the diamonds already exist at that
[1:57:47] level so no matter where you're going
[1:57:50] through whatever you got God has already
[1:57:52] already prepared and placed that to
[1:57:54] perform what he wants
[1:57:56] done it's not by accident God knows you
[1:57:59] would be
[1:58:01] there
[1:58:03] says the intense pressure and heat
[1:58:05] causes a crystals to start becoming
[1:58:08] carbon
[1:58:10] molecules and and they they're forced
[1:58:12] together causing them to lock into each
[1:58:15] other using one of the strong strongest
[1:58:17] chemical bonds known to man I think it's
[1:58:21] calent coent
[1:58:23] Bond he
[1:58:25] says it's a the the way the bond is
[1:58:28] shown depicts one carbon atom reaching
[1:58:31] out an arm and the other carbon atom
[1:58:35] reaching out an
[1:58:36] arm I reaching out to you dear Lord and
[1:58:41] he's already extended his arm to you he
[1:58:46] says but I like this part he says then
[1:58:49] they grab onto each other and he gives
[1:58:52] it C equals c this process happens over
[1:58:55] and over until the diamond is formed
[1:58:58] once the bond is established it's
[1:59:01] extremely difficult to break it's an
[1:59:04] eternal Bond on his end he
[1:59:08] says because each atom is At Its most
[1:59:11] stable point and even though there's
[1:59:13] tremendous pressure and heat externally
[1:59:16] the purity of the diamond is directly
[1:59:19] related to how far down into the Earth's
[1:59:22] crust it starts the further down the
[1:59:24] higher the temperature and pressure the
[1:59:26] longer it takes to get the diamond to
[1:59:28] the Earth's
[1:59:31] surface I'm glad that God chose to do it
[1:59:34] that way but in this com he makes a
[1:59:37] comment that the diamond or the process
[1:59:39] is peaceful for those going through the
[1:59:42] profess process because there's an
[1:59:44] assurance with
[1:59:45] it and when you realize it's God in you
[1:59:49] creating that and you've Tak taking his
[1:59:52] hand he's taking your hand then you can
[1:59:55] rest and that which is performed comes
[1:59:59] out pure and
[2:00:02] valuable so some of the things you're
[2:00:04] going through in life and you say why
[2:00:07] God is perfecting that in you it's a
[2:00:11] choice you've
[2:00:12] made because it's I can't make that
[2:00:14] choice for you you can't make that
[2:00:16] choice for me but I have to say Lord I'm
[2:00:19] willing I'm willing so appreciate that
[2:00:22] and it was something that he uh he
[2:00:24] shared with me and I thought that was
[2:00:26] really good as hearing what brother
[2:00:27] Peter was saying God bringing that and
[2:00:31] you making that choice now Romans 8:28
[2:00:34] tells us that all things happen for our
[2:00:36] good and you could say they're
[2:00:38] predestined you could say God charted
[2:00:40] them out because he knows what he's
[2:00:42] doing he's already I've always said to
[2:00:45] you the the fire you go through is not
[2:00:48] to see if there's gold in you but rather
[2:00:50] because there is gold in you you're
[2:00:52] going through that testing and God knows
[2:00:55] you will you know so part of that there
[2:00:58] and and um I appreciate the grace of God
[2:01:02] and and sometimes it's hard to say thank
[2:01:04] you Lord for the troubles I'm going
[2:01:06] through thank you Lord for the hard
[2:01:08] times I'm going through but you know
[2:01:11] what you're doing about it so I I'd like
[2:01:14] to ask brother Matthew to sing a
[2:01:16] song it's bu
[2:01:19] land if you would is is that your
[2:01:22] heart's desire I'm longing for you would
[2:01:25] you sing that brother Matthew and would
[2:01:28] you play that for him
[2:01:32] sister thank
[2:01:40] you bring
[2:01:45] words I'm kind of homesick
[2:01:53] oh for
[2:01:55] a
[2:01:58] [Music]
[2:01:59] country to which I have
[2:02:05] never
[2:02:07] been never been
