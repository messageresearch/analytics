your name I what [Music] just and by-and-by [Music] [Music] you know it's a choice that you make how you're gonna stand how you're gonna believe what you're going to confess and our confession shouldn't be based on how we're feeling at the moment our confession should be based on what God's Word says because sometimes you feel like you can run through a troop and jump over a wall and sometimes you feel like the wall fell on you but God's Word is still God's Word so that's our confession we have I want to start with a couple of praises maybe encourage you to believe that he's still the same God he's never failed just speaking with them a sister here just earlier as she was talking about how things get applied sometimes and it just reminded me when they brought that woman they had caught in in very act of adultery and he brought her before Jesus and Jesus the only perfect one who could judge that way shows chose to say were thine accusers neither do i condemn thee and i you know sometimes you're your own accuser sometimes you're the one that troubles yourself but take god's word for what he said because i am THE LORD thy God that healeth all thy diseases he goes and all confessed sin all that's laid before him he cleanses he washes he's still the same yesterday we got a praise hear from sister sister Barbara Yarborough about her son Jeffrey in assists I want to give the Lord all the credit for bringing Jeffrey home from the hospital after therefore over six weeks in February he fell and had a brain bleed to brain bleeds actually and had to have surgery after being after being in intensive care for two weeks or more he was sent to rehab order he developed pneumonia and was sent back to the hospital he has been in ICU for over two weeks but praise the Lord on his birthday which was April 1st he was released and Jill was able to take him home where he lives with her we give the Lord all the praise for the answer to prayer amen he's still the same yesterday today and then my daughter Nina sent this one this morning she attends a church there in Wichita Kansas with brother James Pinkston and brother James son-in-law was one of nine cardiologists at the hospital in Indianapolis they have had over 100 or so patients with a quarter coronavirus the nine cardiologists had to be tested for the virus eight of them came back positive and he was the only one that didn't because prayer was getting now for those other eight we asked God to be merciful to them too but we know he watches over his so my niece Felicia they put in a prayer request for her as she works in the hospital and was treating those with the corona virus and she came down with some symptoms also but after the time had passed they found out she didn't have the virus so we appreciate God watching over all of us I did not get any specific prayer requests but there where you are if you can and you will believe and just say Lord you know my name in Venice bow our heads and pray Lord me there's not a situation too great a particular something that could trouble us Lord that you wouldn't be aware don't have the answer in the solution for it Lord and maybe it's just sometimes that we're either struggling within ourselves and maybe we're filled with with regrets and it hurts and or we're feeling unworthy today Lord in the same Lord I'm such a failure I don't even I'm not even worthy to ask you to talk to you the order father it's things Lord that sometimes maybe we don't even have the words to say to you Lord what we have need of can't explain it but you know the very heart of every one you know the situation they're in you know the things that they face Lord Lord there have been many who have lost their income through the loss of work at this time maybe getting nervous and worried and wondering how the bills are gonna be paid Lord but you're still God ruled over all things Lord and we're gonna confess that for each one whatever the situation is Lord made their faith take hold of your word Lord so many instances through the scriptures that we could look and see Lord when it seemed impossible when there was a Red Sea before them and mountains on both sides and Pharaohs army behind them you just told Moses speak that which you have need of Lord let each one of us take that same faith Lord speak to the situation whatever it is Lord and then begin to thank you and praise you and give you tests give testimony lord help us to set our wings on the winds of faith today we ask it in Jesus Christ's name [Music] and in a higher [Music] when I

just for a word of Prayer Lord Jesus we thank you Father today Lord for we believe that you have everything in control Lord that your Lord everything in the world system everything in our life today Lord is happening for a purpose Lord we believe that we're living in a late hour Lord truly more than ever before we see the signs appearing all around us Lord and it doesn't bring doom and gloom to our hearts father but it Lord it gives us joy Lord deep down inside of us to say look up our Redemption draweth nigh we ask Lord God for you to bless the service Lord bless all those listened and then father Lord by the way a phone hook-up those that are live streaming this by video we pray God that it would be a blessing we just invite you now once again Lord to come into our homes Lord to come into our church to come into our midst father Lord may you speak to us God we ask may you bless us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Isaiah chapter 59 and verse we're just going to read one verse Isaiah 59 and verse 19 amen Isaiah chapter 59 and verse 19 one just one scripture reading here the Bible says so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him Lord we just pray one more time for your blessings Lord upon this service god I pray that you would anoint me father anoint those that listening at home Lord and I pray God that you would just receive the glory may you receive the praise Lord and all the honor we seek Lord just to be your servant this morning father - Lord to be pleasing to you we pray God that you would have the preeminence now we ask it in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you can be seated there at church I'd like to you just to look here just for a moment when we say this word standard and I believe that this word standard when it speaks of in verse 19 he says when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him just to say this I just got a note here reminder it looked like we're in Tucson and we're at church but we're really not this is just the power of technology amen so I'm here in a live studio just preaching to you today so I just wanted to clear up the confusion in case some of you are thinking that I'm there in person but I am there in spirit amen god bless you so when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall raise up a standard against him this word standard is such an important word in the age that were for are we living in an age where it's not the age of the seed it's not the age of infancy but we're living in the age of the maturing of all seeds there was a time even in this lady I see in church age where there was an infancy or a seed Foreman or an origination and where things were in seed form things both ecumenically in the demonic realm and the physical realm things were in the seed form or you could call them in the infant stage but let me just say this you're not living in the infant stage today but we're living in them in the age of the maturing of all seeds God's kingdom is maturing God's purposes maturing and we see Satan's purpose and Satan's Kingdom is at its zenith or at its climax Matthew chapter 13 you don't have to turn I'll just read it quickly Matthew chapter 13 and verse 24 it says another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blades sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also in verse 30 they Jesus this is the words when they said what about the tares and what about the wheats that are growing and coming to maturity and Jesus says let them both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gather you together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn and so we're living in that prophecy of this scripture of what we just read here we're living at the climax of all of the tares and all of the wheats that have been growing down through all of the ages even in our own specific Lady Essene church age that we're living in now there is a maturity of all seeds you're living in the culmination or the fruition as the song says it's manifesting time the fruits are on the vine and so it's it's clearly a manifesting age or a time of maturity of all things and let me say this all seeds are coming to maturity we're living in the zenith or the climax of both Satan's Eden and God's kingdom notice that God says I'm not going to disrupt what the reap what the what the sower who sowed the bad seed I'm not gonna disrupt it I'm gonna let him sew it I'm not going to stop him I'm not going to hinder him I'm going to just let him continue to build his kingdom and surely friends he has been building his kingdom in the world in the nation the Spirit that's on the nation the spirits on the world is a representation of the maturity of Satan's Eden and the maturity of his purposes and his plans there's nothing that's happening in the world today that you see that has just happenstance or just by chance but everything is being led or being controlled or influenced by spirits whether we realize that or not our life on a daily basis is controlled by spirits it's controlled by an influence there's something that is motivating you every day you wake up and every time you get out of bed and you go about your life there's a spirit that's motivating you and we're living at the maturing of those spirits we're living at the maturing of that purpose we're living in the climax of God's purpose from the beginning and the Serpent's purpose from the beginning we're living in an age where everyone in this age is claiming to have the truth everyone is claiming to be right you take the word just the word standard and but here here's what we know about the Word of God there's only one standard there's only God doesn't have many metrics he doesn't have many measuring lines he doesn't have multiple books he doesn't have multiple evolving thoughts but his original thought was a perfect and and a perfect purpose and God said I'm going to have a standard hey doesn't have many ways to be right there is only one right way there is only one right word jesus said I am the way Muslims claim they have the truth Buddha claims they have the truth but Jesus stands in the middle of all of them and says I'm the only truth I'm the only way I'm the only door so so what we understand says it's right is right many different religions in the world today have a different approach that they claim that they have the right way or a different people have different approaches to what they believe is right and what they believe is wrong and in the age that we live in it's an age of relativism where everybody truth is just relative its it depends on what country you're from it depends on what state you're in it depends on where you're from what nation you're born and it'll determine what's right in what's wrong but God said I'm gonna have a word that it's going to judge the entire world brother Branham said he can't be just unless he has a standard to judge the world by and so we're living in an age if I could say this we have a world that is filled with different denominations and different denominational ideas and and the opinions of men my brother my sister what we are ripe with in the in the in the world that we live in is today is the opinions of people we're living in an age where the knowledge the Bible says knowledge would increase you you see the information age that we live in it's no accident that that the internet was discovered in our age there's no accident that because it was a maturing of a seed it was a maturing of the fourth dimension and so it's no accident that you're living in the age where man has more access to information than he's ever had at a moment he can he can google something and have an answer to his questions questions that people have asked for years and now we can just go and we can have information and so we're living in the age the climax of the Age of information or the climax of the age of man's ideas opinions are endless in the age that we live in you might google a topic and you might you know you know and we'll but when you google that topic no matter what you're googling you're getting an aggregated consensus of information that stems from opinion do you realize that now I know we've almost deified in our world Google and you know just google it whatever Google says and we can become so it's no accident friend I'm not preaching against the internet today that the only reason we're able to preach to you right now is through the internet but it's the tree of knowledge of good and evil and so what you're what you're getting is an age to where people are becoming so information field they're so information field but they have no revelation let me say this today the bride of Jesus Christ does not have information she has revelation God's kingdom would not be built on information Satan's Kingdom would God Satan brother Madison Satan has a scientific economy but God has his mystic body the mystical body of Jesus Christ that doesn't depend on science they depend upon halation and so we were endless in the ages that we live in you can google a topic and you can become almost to where the Google just anything you you know anything you type in as well as whatever that says you know no chance Google could be wrong but what you realize is that is that our search result is just an aggregated consensus of information that is based its foundation is the opinion of man some professional and some not so much professional as we learn so the world today the age today is littered with the opinions of people it's it's littered with the with the ideas of man old but let me just break through with the word here today and say there is only one opinion that matters my opinion doesn't count your opinion doesn't count there's only one space there's only one truth and that's the word of God my brother my sister that's this prophetic book that is controlling your life it's controlling the white house it's controlling all the nations of the earth there's only one mind that matters and that's the mind of God let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus we live in a world that is so sympathetic to every opinion such such a climate of sympathy to where they're sympathetic to it except Christians but they're sympathetic to every idea every standard of moral but here's what we know by the Bible there's not more than one right answer there's not more than one standard there's only one right way and there's only one right choice there's not more than one right way everyone's looking for some kind of measuring line or metric that they can use of what's right and what's wrong you know another Jordan you should have that if if it works on the power point good if not those at home can just listen in but notice what the prophet of God says here you or he would be unjust to let us go now and live this life without a standard to be judged by who would be right where could you tell what was right there has to be a standard oh my friends the world has their own standard of love the way of looking at everything they have their own standard of what truth is they have their own approach okay so let me ask you a question can we use the world as the standard to judge can we use the world as our standard to live by I would say absolutely not no way that the world is ever changing the world is constantly changing you look at just over they they're constantly modifying what they believe there's there's that over just the last hundred years you know I was just watching a videotape here that was shared to me and you can its own YouTube of I think it's Kota a walk through New York in 1911 and someone has taken and put old black and white film of New York City in 1911 and and there's there's color to it and there's sound and and and and and the sound of horse and buggy and they've they've digitized it in a way to get 60 frames per second in 4k and it's it's amazing you should you should watch it it it was shocking to me to see just if you look at the standard of what a man dressed like and what a woman dressed like just to today it's there's this it's a stark contrast between the two just in that little bit of time little over a hundred years of time the world is constantly evolving and changing there wasn't a man on the street that didn't have a suit on I'm not talking about Christians I'm talking about man everyone wore a suit every woman weren't wore a dress all the way down flowing down passed all the way due to their ankles there were such a hey and now today everything is so casual and it doesn't really matter and you just go comfortable but the world is constantly evolving the world is constantly changing what they believe what they believe just 40 years ago as of today is completely different than what you what you what you sweat you see today so what they let me say this what they used to call wrong they now call right and what they used to call right they now call wrong I mean think about this my brother my sister it's completely backwards uh and if what they let me say this what they used to call right they now call wrong or old-fashioned or out of sync or out of touch or not relevant or the world's changed and you're just old-fashioned your own timey and you know you're not you're not relevant that's the word today let me say this I might not be relevant but I'm revel a 'td I'll take revelation of irrelevance any day because relevance is subjective the very word relevant it means that it's subjective so the standard of the world today is constantly changing they had no absolute they have no type post they have no absolute have no typos they have no sure footing you look at political the political world today politics are constantly changing uh would politician as of you today and you go back and he's running for an office well well we found a tape over here where just a few years ago you voted for this and now you're voting against it and over here you voted for that because it was calm everyone changes they just going down the drain I want to go against the flow I want to rise up out of this dimension into a heavenly world into a heavenly atmosphere okay so I want to go a little bit further here just getting some feedback here brother Jordan that when we go to the power point it's stutter and so maybe would us would have stay on me here just for a moment so the world is just constantly changing my brother my sister the world is not just changing that's almost shallow just to say that let me say it this way it's a changing it's it's corrupting it's declining so brother Matt then what should we use should we use the church hardly huh the church can't be the measuring line of what how God's going to judge the world the church is constantly evolving there could even what they believe just 100 years ago they have changed their standards they're an ever-changing measuring line they have watered down the truth of the word of God at the end of the day it's just whatever anyone thinks whatever the expert thinks whatever the doctorate person with a theology degree we hatch them out of seminary and all they're just the experts on everything they know Greek they do seven different languages and they can interpret the Hebrew they know textual variants so they can study the days of creation they can argue with the atheists the minds of the church world today are more educated than they've ever been and they're more lost and far away from what the truth the true standard of God's Word ever was to be it's just what every one thinks is right I want you to turn to judges chapter 21 and I want you to turn there I'll give you just a minute just to turn notice this is judges chapter 21 verse 25 and I'm just gonna interject here something just for a moment and I want to look at it here judges chapter 121 verse 25 this is this is I think per so prophetic of the age that were the cycle that we're in in the end the time where the clock is where the hour hand in the minute of the age that we're living in and so I want you to turn there just just if you could judges chapter 21 and look at verse 25 it says in those days there was no king in Israel and every man did that which was right in his own eyes you see without a king before a king was a prophet it was a seer he was that's why the Bible says with where there's no vision that word vision directly correlates to a prophet because the Prophet is the seven eyes of God he says there's seven eyes and they went through seeing throughout the entire world a prophet has a gift I'm not talking about just the gift of prophecy I'm talking about the messengers that's spoken of a revelation for every age they were the seers they were the eyes they brought illumination in the middle of darkness they were the light and so so this is what the Bible says where there's no vision where there's no prophetic understanding where there's no prophetic revelation the people perish you know the scripture where there's no vision the people perish they put off they cast off restraint he says every man in those days did that which was right in his own eyes my brother and my sister you're living in the age where man's opinion has became so exalted that it's just like the gospel it's the age of opinion everyone expressing their opinion everyone we have social media platforms and blogs that or man can just spew out the thoughts the fodder of his own mind and what he thinks but here's the problem with man's mind that there's nothing more unstable than the mind of man a fallen man who's whose whose mind is subject to it to to experiences his his opinions are subjected to experiences his opinions are subjected to emotions their subjecting to influences their subjective to the friends he's around they're subjected to the education he's received and then he he calls up his opinion but what's it based upon so man becomes his own interpreter man becomes his own and Turk the Bible says he becomes his own filter his own moral compass I'm sure you know we can say here today our standards everyone's standards would be it would be a little different than each others you know your standard would be different than mine cleanliness of homes could could vary in standard and what you think is nice may not be what I think is nice what you think is good may not be what I think is good everyone's going to have their own opinions but our standards are a little different I'm a different nation different state that you're born in every everybody's gonna is going to be raised with a little bit different standard but the reality is my brother my sister when it comes to the important things there's only one truth there's only one way there's only one Lord there's only one faith there's only one baptism it's not millions of opinions but Bob but you say why brother Matt why can't it be the way because God said I'll judge the world by one opinion one Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is not just the man of Galilee of Nazareth of 2000 years ago of a sunday-school Jesus but he's alive and well he's in you say where is Jesus today in his word Jesus the word well I just believe in Jesus well which one which version which version do you believe in but there's one version there's one truth this is what this is what Christians have stood for from the beginning this is why and Jude he says they says there's certain being crept out of the where's who were before of old ordained to this condemnation with cunningness and craftiness and jude says we must earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints there's one standard let me say this my brother God doesn't care what you think and he doesn't care what I think he doesn't care about our opinions I'll give a word God says I'll give a word and it'll be an unchanging standard it'll be an unchanging word it won't be dynamic it won't evolve it'll be a plumb line it'll be a standard it'll be a straight and narrow way one standard one way this is why it's so important that we keep the plumb line straight that we keep the Word of God based upon the Bible no matter what we believe we base it upon this I don't care what your opinion is if something brother Branham said it better be based upon the Word of God because this was brother branham's absolute and it's my absolute you say what is your absolute where the Matt the same things the Prophet was when he preached them with a message absolutely held bouquets black leather-bound Bible and said this is the only absolute God ever gave to man your some it better not be on anything else better not be on man better not be a melon of denominational an opinion on a doctrine it better be based upon the Word of God to keep our ideas and opinion out of it to keep the word pure it's the only way to bring forth life and liberty is to have the true standard the true pattern notice what brother Branham says in the pattern of the Word of God and you can try if you want the PowerPoint I suppose if you if you think it's stuttering then we'll just keep it I'm just gonna read them for you here just for a minute listen what brother Branham says out of the ephesian church age he says thus what the church was at Pentecost now notice not 1906 Azusa Street not not not not you know daddy seymour and in the Welsh revival and you know not not that that's not the Pentecost we're talking about we're talking about the book of Acts pinnacles what the church was listen to the Prophet thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did it Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close so that that what was that first Pentecost to church it was the seed it was the Alpha I'm the alpha I'm the Omega the Ephesian age would be the Alpha it would be the beginnings of everything that seed that would go into the ground and come through seven church ages until now we have the that we we go back to what we go back to the seed again it's went through the stalk it's went through the tussle it's went through all every generation and everything it was all a restoration it was all a framework but it was all to go to the original seed to be harvested again remember Jesus says leave the tares with the wheat but I'll come and harvest what is that harvest it's a rapture it's the latter rain what is the latter rain it's the rapture rain and we've received that rain already to get us ready for a rapture to be harvested he says not now this is the pergamene church age if a man is born of the word being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever first Peter 1:23 he will produce the word the fruit or works of his life will be a product of the kind of seed or life that is in him his works therefore will be scriptural oh what an indictment this truth is going to be against this Pergamon age that's one and his and he says and in his hand the sharp sword with two edges the word of God and that word would judge us until the last day in fact notice this he says in fact the word is judging even now for it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart it cuts asunder the carnal from the spiritual it makes us live in epistles read and known of all men otis further he says I know thy works if a man fears that he might not please God let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if he will hear those words well done my good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of God in his life and he assuredly and assuredly he will hear those words of praise notice the word of truth was the criterion then it is the criterion now there isn't another standard there isn't another plumb line as the world is going to be judged by one Christ Jesus even so it is going to be judged by the word if a man wants to know how he is making out let him do his James suggested look into the mirror of God's word glory so man it would be producing this is what brother Branham said what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost to produce the word to wear your word says a man to every word of God I thought brother Branham said a man was was he you know I thought the baptism the Holy Ghost the proof the evidence was saying a man to the Word of God my brother - not an intellectual man it's your life what does a man mean it means so be it when was Mary saying a man - the Word of God when she brought forth the child when she brought forth Christ when the word could take place and she could but she could produce the word when your life produces the word that's when you're saying amen to every word I say Lord let my life produce the word let me say a man to every word of God it's not just saying a man it's producing the Word of God in your life I say God let me produce the word let it go beyond my confession and let it manifest in a life in the fruits of my life for that's the only thing that's really important anyways the fruits are works of his life so what will you you say but the mat what will you produce you will produce your life will be a product of the seed that's in you as brother Branham said every seed is bringing for every seed will bring forth after its own kind a prophet of God said if I had the spirit of Beethoven he said I would I would play music I write music if I had the spirit of John Dillinger I'd be a gunslinger he says old but if I have the Spirit of Christ I'll be like Christ as the song says when they see me let them see Jesus oh I trust that's your prayer today when they see me let them see Jesus let it be the product of my life a written epistle read and known of all men I pray that your prayer here today your life line your life up with the plumb line the standard because when the enemy comes rushing in like a flood the Spirit of God raises a standard against him he raises up a standard the Bible says they're groping the world is groping in darkness it's getting smarter and more educated it thinks it's smarter than it ever was before but where the human rotten the human mind today has reached such a precipice it's so highly esteemed the thoughts and opinions of man it's the age of information it's the advent of blogs it's the advent of the of the internet a blog to give a man a platform to esteem his own thoughts his own thinking is the age of self validation and we're validated today when we have an opinion that lines up with the rest of the world oh what a perversion my brother and my sister let our validation only being where we stand in Christ not where though how the world looks at us today man is literally worshiping his own thinking you got to be careful I read a sign of impact me so well you've heard of the statement don't always believe what you hear don't always believe what you see someone had a bumper sticker and it said don't always believe what you believe art I said don't always believe what you think don't always believe what you think cuz you might be wrong Oh today the Internet has produced an age of DIY do-it-yourself everyone just doesn't I need a plumber well I can just google that I can YouTube that you know I can I can just go look at what you know I it I'm not preaching against that I'm just trying to get you to understand here there's a reason for that I don't I don't any electrician I can give you tube that and then you burn your house down then you realize you you're not as smart as you think you were I don't need a pastor I can fix my own problems I could fix my own just give me a preacher just give me a man oh preach to me just give me some where I could go and fulfill a religious duty it's an age of do-it-yourself it's an age I don't need a church I can use either I don't need I don't need a prophet at my own I'm own interpreter I'm my own interpretation but the world the Word says you're groping in darkness you may think you're in light that was the the judgement the rebuke to this age was that that you you say you're rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest thou not you're blind you're wretched your miserable your poor and you don't even know it you think you're smarter the world thinks they're smarter than ever before they think they're successful and fulfilled all but then suddenly here comes a virus and suddenly here comes a disease and it swipes through the nation and then what do you have you have all those intellectual people huh we really don't know there's really no towels or really no tests and everyone's looking to the experts everyone's looking to dr. Fowler everybody's looking at good man good educated man they're doing everything they can do god bless them I'm glad we have them I'm praying for those men who are in that in the I'm praying for men like dr. Falchi men like the the people who are studying the antidote for this disease I pray for him God uses them God uses vaccines God uses medicine it's way you but man doesn't heal the brother madam said man can't heal anything any doctor good doctor tell you that man can't heal even the medicine itself was an agent that God uses but God brings the healing so I brother branham said you take a dead man and he said if he had a cut in his arm and a big sore cut when he when he died he said if he's dead you go ahead and rub that on augment on there he says rub that medicine on there give him every drug you could think of give him every vitamin give him there he said that cut will never heal it'll stay just like it was because he's dead he said but what what we realize is is that it's the life inside of the man that heals him the drugs and that the medicine and the and the ointments are only an assistant to the life that's inside of him life is what brings healing so you think people think they're more successful more fulfilled but you have suddenly you have a disease that strikes the world and then everyone realizes how helpless we really are it's an age of insanity of total insanity total addiction broken on the inside on the outside you see a veneer of success on the outside you see a veneer of rich increase with goods but on the inside they're searching for answers on the inside brother madam said it's like a boy whistling through a graveyard and the world thinks they've been whistling through a graveyard they're thinking that they're all right that their that their scientific age will produce all the answers and just one little plague strike some and look at the panic and pandemonium that's in the world today what an age what is this age of information produced if we're smarter than we've ever been if we're more intellectual than we've ever been if we understand more than we've ever understood if it's a greater age than ever before let me ask you what has that this age produced its produced of people a world that is more addicted than they've ever been before people that are more depressed with filled with anxiety more suicide than ever before and more broken homes and more broke than they've ever been more divorced than there's ever been more insanity addicted to pills addicted to alcohol addicted to pornography addicted to drugs the world is groping in darkness but God has a standard to the Word of God God has a standard and God said in the evening time there shall be light so arise shine my light has come turn to numbers chapter one I just want to change change course here just for a moment and just loo just look at something here for a moment so turn to numbers chapter 1 and verse 50 I want you to look at this this here in numbers notice in numbers chapter 1 and verse 50 I'll give you just a moment to turn there look at just how long we've been going here he says but thou shall appoint this is numbers one verse 50 but thou shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle no notice Israel here as he would as he would as God would call him notice this in numbers chapter 1 and verse 50 but thou shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony and over all the vessels thereof and over all the things that belong to it they shall bear the tabernacle and all the vessels thereof and they shall minister unto it and shall notice this and shall in camp round it was it was the the the physical manifestation a physical representation of the tabernacle or the house of God in heaven remember Moses God says Moses builded exactly as I showed you to them according to the pattern in heaven so Israel's tabernacle would be a representative of truth it would be a way of salvation they're the only ones who were saved there were the only ones if you wanted to get to God you had to come through Israel you follow me they were the ambassadors of truth and so so they would they would camp Oregon says you would camp round about the tabernacle and notice it he says and when the tabernacle set it forward the Levites shall take it down and when the tabernacle is to be pitched the Levites shall set it up and and the stranger that cometh nice shallow depth and the Chittenden is or shall pitch their tents notice this in verse 52 every man by his own camp and every man by his own standard throughout their host numbers chapter 2 1 just turn straight over there and look at verse 2 every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard with the in sign of their father's house far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch so notice that series a says every man you're gonna camp according to your to your father's house by your own standard according to the in sign of your father's house far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch so there was a different assigned standard to each tribe of Israel you remember Ezekiel's vision that Ezekiel has the vision of the Beast and he has the vision of the ox and and the vision of the man I want you to look at this here and brother Jordan can you just give me a confirmation are we able to show the PowerPoint because if for not I'm just going to go past showing these images but I want to I want to get to this here just for a moment so notice it was a different assignees has this vision it was the next PowerPoint than brother Jordan the second one that I sent you uh and it's the same thing I think it's revelations chapter 4 where it speaks of the anointings the anointing of the man of the ox of the Eagle notice all of these standards these were the in signs these were the in signs these were the standards that God established notice this here in revelations chapter 4 you can pick it up the the beasts that surrounded the throne remember that the scripture there the Beast the the different face the face of the man the face of the eagle the face of the ox notice let me just pull it up here in my on the face of the lion and so these were different standards notice this here show the PowerPoint if you could you had the lion standard and we know that there was a lion age they were anointed under all those horse riders brother Branham said what God would do he sent us he would he said Satan would send out a spirit in that first age and he said that spirit of that black horse ride of that red horse rider and that white horse rider that pale horse rider that was a combination of all of them and he said it he said but every time Satan would go to send his spirit to attack the first age he said God would set his spirit of a lion and he said and it was it would meet the challenge of that day and he said then in the next stage there was the spirit that went forth all rider that went forth and he says God would send the spirit of man and he said that was the age of man the intellect the great minds of man that they would they would take the word that was taken out by the Catholic Church the Bible was taken out of their own language but God would use me and he Dre had raised men up like Wycliffe and and and and Finney and different men that would that would that would take the Word of God and put the word back using the intellect the anointing of man of the mind of man and they would give the word back to the believer you know the edge of the Ox where it was an ox of burden where he get literally gave his life we're going into this but then in the end time there would be a pale horse rider and that pale horse rider would be a conglomeration of all of the other beasts all of the other horse riders it was pal it was a mixture said I'm gonna send the anointing of a flying eagle it was a standard let me say this my brother my sister that standard that you're under today is not the age of an ox where you got to give your life as a martyr it's not the age of a man where you got to use your intellect to figure things out but you've been given the spirit the anointing of a flying eagle to rise above it by revelation you can see clearly you can see the past what happened in the church ages and what happened down through history you can see the future see the present because you're an eagle that's your anointing and notice here was the same same thing that they'd seen that Ezekiel sees is the same thing in the book of Revelation we don't have time to get to to all of this today so I just want to just to get to this as best as I can and then we're just gonna have to move on but I want you to notice this here let me just find my place here just for a moment in the fifth seal brother Branham says now the scripture says when the enemy comes rushing in like a flood the Spirit of God is listening close hold that power point here for a moment notice this now the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God raises a standard against that this is the fifth seal in 63 and so when the enemy went out as an antichrist God sent a certain type of power out to meet him and when they he went out again as a red horse rider another color another power another ministry God sent went after him to combat it to hold his church sent the third one again God sent his third beast common announced it we just looked at those in the PowerPoint there he sent the fourth one God say his fourth one when the Antichrist in and the church ages ended - at that time watch oh this is really good now we see the devil's changing four beasts meant what power they was revealed to or what power he revealed to the world and how they ended it on this place the death horse now look at God's powers of these beasts to combat them the first beast of God he went out to meet the Antichrist with the Antichrist spirit when it's with he says he says when it's in just his teaching now remember when the Antichrist first rode he was in a teaching ministry the Antichrist rode first in a teaching ministry now watch the one that went out to meet him the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word what did they have in the first page they had the word when his false teaching went forth the true word went out to meet him notice this now I want you to notice Israel here because and just here brother Jordan if you want to go to the PowerPoint if you want to go to the tabernacle picture the slide right after the Eagle notice this was this a good picture a good illustration of that Old Testament wilderness Tabernacle you have here you have the outer Court you have the you have the tabernacle and you have the holy a fire of God the pillar fire coming out and of that of that holiest of Holies and notice all of the tents that are all surrounding all of the tabernacle is each camp now notice this here in your Bible and I want you to follow alone closely here notice what what we read here that every man and numbers 2 he says every man shall camp according to his standard every man according to the in sign of his father's house so each tribe notice this Judah the tribe of Judah you know what their flag was the standard that flag bear the one that held the flag the big flat and the in sign that would go out it was it was it was the camp of the lion and you had you had Judah who was under the lion standard you had a sacar and you had Zebulon who would camp under that lion anointing they would camp under the the tribe of Judah Issachar Zebulun came in behind Judah they camped right behind him but they were under the same standard of a lion Reuben would have the standard of a man has inside his flag as camp would look like would have the face of a man and it was it was under under Reuben was the man standard Simeon and Levi I'm sorry Simeon and GAD would follow in behind Reuben and and they ordered themselves half under the same standard of a man under the same ensign Levi was them - Levi was that was the ministry he was the priesthood and you know where Levi dwelled in the tabernacle he was in the middle of all the other tribes he was the standard he was he was in the middle of the movement you had a for him and Ephraim had the standard of the in sign of the ox and and and and Manasseh and Benjamin followed encamped right under that anointing or that ensign of Ephraim which was an ox standard then you had Dan and the tribe of Dan had the Eagle anointing and the Eagle standard Asher nepto lie would follow a camp under that Eagle standard and notice brother Branham says this in the kid revelations chapter through Chapter three picks this up listen here Dan was an eagle Ruben was the man's face ephraim is an ox now you get the picture there's the way they camped in the Bible now if you'll notice Dan is the head of these tribes of three tribes Judah is the head of three tribes Ruben's the head of three tribes he frames a head of three tribes three fours is twelve 12 tribes of Israel see each one with their banner and the banner of Judah the banner of Reuben man the banner of Ephraim an ox the banner of Dan was an eagle now look back here what John said and one this is in Revelations brother banners pointing to one had the face now let's read it here now just see if it isn't the same thing like it was in heaven the first beast was like a lion Judah the second beast was like a calf that's a young ox the third beast was the face of a man the force fourth beast was a flying eagle just exactly the tribes of Israel camped guarding what were they guarding what was the purpose of this they were Guardians Oh hallelujah hope you catch it today the the tabernacle was the way it was the standard it was the way to life and Jesus said I am the way they were a pre figure of the way that Jesus spoke up and all of those anointings under the under Israel when they marched to battle when they marched through the wilderness when they marched they didn't just scatter everyone you were ever here and wherever you want to be over here they marched according to their standard and wherever they went they marched with the with Ruben and ganon and and Dan was the eagle and they stayed in order why they were Guardians they were in anointing they were under the anointing they were guarding the way to life why do you have trouble boy we could get really in the weeds here today just getting into so much but why do you why do you have a cherubims at the Garden of Eden when man was kicked out of the Garden of Eden and the Bible says cherubim with flaming swords were to protect the way back to Eden that's what the Bible says he says and he put cherubims with flaming swords to protect our guard the way men was put out on in a curse oh but my brother my sister we're going back to eat in one day or being restored - and this is Satan's Eden this is Satan's Kingdom this is Satan's world this is he can have it I don't want it he can have the world system today I'm going back to Eden I've received the word for my day and the message of the hour and it's anointed me with the flying eagle to fly above all of the chaos and pandemonium and panic that's in the world today I'm not part of this world system I'm part of another world can you hope you're saying Amen here today I'm part of another dimension I'm part of a hold of a system I'm not of this world system but Israel was guarding the way back you have cherubims and Eden then you go to the tabernacle and notice in the mercy seat in the holiest of holies the Bible says that God said put to cherubims guarding the mercy seat oh it was the entrance back it was speaking of Christ it was speaking of I am the way I am the truth there's there is a way that seemeth right in the middle there's a broad way but the end there of his destruction but then there's a narrow way and Jesus says in few there be that find it but I'm glad I found it today I'm glad I found that way back to Eden notice they were they were all guarding this is how they marched they marched under the standard listen to what prophet says he says the first speech dooda was a lion second meesa calf that's a young ox third beast was the face of a man the fourth beast was a flying eagle just exactly like Israel camped around guarding their earth they are earthly guards of the right to the ark they were guarding the access to life they were guarding the revelation of the Word of God that's why Matthew Mark Luke and John were under an ox a lion an ox a man in an eagle anointing and brother branham said what were those Gospels the four Gospels was the guardians of Revelation they were guarding the way that's why Matthew 28:19 is in there is in the book of Matthew what is Matthew 28:19 go ye therefore into all the world preach unto them baptizing them in the name of the Father and then of the Sun and the name of the holy ghost you know that why why that's in Matthew because Matthew was a guardian to the way of life so there would be an intentionally there would be a scripture in Matthew 28:19 that would confound the wise and the prudent the entire church world today is serving under a Trinitarian baptism under Trinitarian understanding of three persons and of God and it's it's a demonic spirit that's a uniting spirit that unites all the denominations you go to end in a nomination of church today and you go to their website click on the statement of faith every single one of them and you we believe in the father I think the eternal God eternally manifested himself in three persons the father the son the spirit oh that they're united hands with each other on anything else but this one doctrine unites film and they use Matthew 28:19 to prove it go ye therefore baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost but Jesus has behold I lay a stone and he says it'll be it'll be a stone of offense a stumbling stone it will stumble the wise and prudent but the simple shall find it glory to God it stumbles that scripture their labor of the access to the way of life and they they try to open the door and they can't get in and they come away with three gods three persons because they don't have revelation because Matthew was a guard who was under a lion anointing to guard the way to life all friends though the my brother my sister the word is so beautiful it's so perfect they were under those anointings John was that eagle notice this it's a it's an anointed it's a revelation Matthew Mark Luke and John guard the way to the book of Acts and unless you have the revelation to get past the key go will you safer than that what does that mean then baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost in the name of then what is the name of the Father the Lord what is the name of the son Jesus what is the name of the Spirit Christ baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ father son spirit not three persons one it what not not eternally manifested in three different presences as they as the Trinitarian doctrine States manifested in three essences you can have what you can't have a person a personality and not have a person whole but my brother my sister do you see this this was this was guards just like Israel they guarded according to their standard they marched according to their standard they were under that anointing oh it was it was an it was an anointing that came - and then you have the church ages and you have the lion you have the ox or the man you have the ox you have the Eagle anointing under each one of those ages and Israel was God was marching according to their standard all under their anointing they regarding the way of life I want you to look at this in the PowerPoint where the Jordan go to the next one I hope this comes through clear this is how Israel marched look at the tabernacle there the yellow block in the middle that was the tabernacle and then to the west you had ephraim then to the south you had a reuben then to the east you had the lion then to the north you had the eagle under Dan and notice here the Levites the ministry access to the word came through the Levites in the tabernacle and this is look at the picture of how they marched this is how they marched and notice as the artist drew it it's in the picture or the portrait of the shape of a cross you think that's an accident my brother my sister it's not an accident they were marching what was it whenever if you were to take an aerial view of the children of Israel as they marched through the wilderness they were marching and then the shape of a cross it was all speaking of something it was all speaking of Christ the word revelation of the word of God oh my brother and my sister today I hope you catch it today this is how God noticed the next slide this is an aerial view here this is an aerial view of the tabernacle of how they marched they marched they didn't know it but they were under an anointing they didn't even know what they were doing but they were under an anointing of the Word of God they were part of the purpose of God they were part of the plan of God they were March and according to the word they were they were they were the standard the ambassadors of Jehovah God oh how wonderful notice what brother Branham says here he says that's the reason in the fifth seal that's the reason we had a rainiest Polycarp and those fellows a Saint Martin when that Antichrist was riding with this false teaching God sent a teaching the word the Lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word made manifest by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit there to manifest himself which is the word that's the reason the early church had healings and miracles and visions and power it's because they were Living Word they were they was he says because it was the Living Word in the form of the lion the tribe of Judah riding out to combat that now you got it brother Branham says he sends his power Antichrist and God sends his the word Antichrist false teaching the true teaching went forth to combat it now that was the first one now that was the first Church apostolic that went to meet him another thing the Ox is also a beast of sacrifice see they give their lives just as freely as they could give them in the Dark Ages a thousand years their Catholicism controlled the world and they just went right in yes or no they didn't my me how why the very spirit of that age they didn't mind given their life they didn't mind sacrificing becoming a martyr he said by the mat I could not imagine again today I just I just think of I hear about those those Christians who stood there in the Roman Coliseum Zand they were fed to lions the Bible speaks and says oh they were sewn asunder of whom the world is not worthy they were torn apart by wild beasts wild animals do you think of those Christians through those dark ages save their life you know sealed their testimony by their own blood and you say here today in 2020 boy I just can't imagine I can't how could they do that brother and sister what you need to understand is they couldn't do that but there was an anointing that was released to them it was an anointing that came over them they couldn't have done it himself but they were being controlled by prophecy by a word that was released the ox they went and died brother venom said why they didn't mind he said that they didn't mind that they would just give their life he said oh he says Polycarp was faced with lions he was burned you know what it was too late for them to turn a lion a lion loose in the reader so they so they tore down a bathroom an old bathhouse there and put him in the arena and burned him down and on his road coming down this is Polycarp and on his road coming down when he was on his way to be killed he was walking with his head down the Roman centurion said you're an old man well respected why don't you just announce this whole thing he just kept looking towards heaven and a voice spoke from somewhere they couldn't understand where said Polycarp don't fear I'm with you oh why he was standing for the word of God and when they begin to power the boards on him to burning there was a heavenly music that came down and the anthems from some angelic somewhere sang the songs he never even one time batted an eye to the skull fur that's gallant men that's men who can stand the martyrs down through the ages there suffered terribly why they were under the inspiration the Spirit of God the power of God oh my mother brother Adam says don't you ever forget this my brethren you own tape I want you to examine this how could men do anything else besides the power of God that it had been released to them I could have never done that Polycarp could have never done that but he had an anointing upon his life he says oh he says he says he says how could he ever do that he says how could they ever have done that I'm gonna set this box up here to represent that if God sends a certain spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by how did they give their life I couldn't imagine doing that brother Matt that's because that's not your anointing that's not sure in 19 brother Branham said the bride doesn't go through persecution she doesn't go through martyrdom he says in the fifth seal he says my people that I seen beyond the curtain of time they weren't under the martyrs block he says they were brother Branham he's asking questions answers 1964 with the joy the bride goes through the tribulation will she be he says will the bride go through persecution brother Branham says no the next thing for her is the rapture why our anointing is that the anointing of an ox it's not the anointing of a man that's why we don't need intellect to figure this thing out that's not our anointing people are trying to become an election with the message and become a bunch of intellects and and and and see uh theologians of the message that's good thing to understand the message but my brother you better realize that's not sure anointing that's not an anointing to get you out of here but you've received an anointing of a flying Mighty Eagle that a rapture the church one day hallelujah he says that's the spirit that they were under that was the standard that they were under some Ernie you're gonna have to suffer to death Pergamon soul he says I have a few things against you because that was and then thou has led them there to hold the doctrine of Balaam and so Thyatira you notice all of these different ages brother Branham says in Revelation chapter four boy the South gates guarded by the ox the North gates guarded by the lion I mean the east gate the north gate is guarded by the flying eagle John the Evangelist then the physician on this side Luke the man he starts to show you John the Evangelist the physician Luke the man you had the ox the eagle the lion all of those anointings they were there too TEKT the way back to the Tree of Life they were there to protect that way it was an anointing my brother let me preach to you today you're under the anointing of oh you said I don't see how I'm ever gonna be perfect I don't see how I'm ever gonna be anything brother Matt I don't see how I'm gonna be in that bride I don't see how I'm gonna my body's gonna change I got so many faults and so many men fell so many mistakes I just can't imagine ever be imperfect oh but there's an anointing that's released unto you if you come under the anointing of this word of God it'll free you from fear it'll free you from panic from pandemonium that the world's your closed in the world shutout it's an eagle anointing the spirit of a flying eagle to rise above it when the Spirit of God comes in like a flood he says that when the when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of God raises up a standard against him it was a standard against him and then we're at 2:40 12 1 could be 1140 there just give me just a few more minutes but the Jordan if you could give me just a clock to let me know how long I've been he would he would give them a standard notice what the standard was it was a standard of uniformity it was uniformity said it would be an ensign it would be the standard of the Word of God and my brother when the world is losing their standard let's raise up our standard that we've received in this day it's not a time to let the standards go it's a time to raise up the standard in our lives even the Roman Empire one of the most successful armies that ever walked the earth was the Roman army they conquered the entire known world you go back in history and look at the success of the Romans but I read a history document it said what was the key to the Roman success how were they so successful and it said I named everything the reasons why they were successful when they said one of the most important reasons of their success what they could tie their success to was their uniformity the Centurions all wore the same uniform they all dress the same you could see them from a distance and know it was a Roman soldier because they look different than everybody else their breastplate there that they were that they had their swords they all looked the same they all spoke the same language they spoke the same language they all understood that they were part of something bigger than themselves they fought for Caesar they carried a flag they which was a standard it showed what slits Legion they belong to each Centurion IH each century had a detachment of a hundred men in each Legion are at each century and an every detachment had a different Cygnet to show which part of the army they were they were in what was the standard notice this what was the standard for why did they have it why was that bois was that signet raised to bring each man in to their position to position Aleppo what does the Eagle anointing do the Eagle standard was to bring us to our position to recognize our day in its message to recognize our place in our calling to make sure you're in the right army the right company they had communication there were no cell phones in those days you know they couldn't text each other but you know what they had they had trumpets and that trumpet would blow a certain sound and everyone would stand to attention this trumpet player had one job to do and he was to blow his trumpet to signify whether to march or defend or hold the line they had to hear a certain sound and was the penalty of death to the roman trumpet player if he was to blow an uncertain sound their life was blowing a certain sound they had loyalty they carried the image everywhere they went they carried the image of Caesar what was it to do to constantly remind the troops that constantly in the heat of battle when the battle got hot in the and it was really hard to fight they can't kept that image to me constantly remind the troops you're not fighting for yourself you're fighting for your king you're fighting for your country you're fighting for a cause oh my brother my sister why would brother branham constantly lift up the name of Jesus he was constantly he wasn't lifting up his own name his trumpet was not blowing the name of William Branham it was lifting the name of Jesus because Jesus said if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me he was constantly reminding the people he was constantly lifting the name of Jesus to call us to attention but history tells us the Roman Empire eventually faded off and failing and entire empire completely collapsed and came to nothing and and and and historians have written article after article and to say the reason why did that if they could pinpoint why the Romans aren't be completely fell apart you know what they said that that the reason why the Romans started to decline is because eventually the Roman Empire changed their qualifications for membership you see before to be Rowman in the army you had to be a born citizen it would be born as a Roman in order to be in the Army you had to be a born Roman I hope you catch the significance there even Paul you notice Paul in acts 25 when Paul standing before Festus Paul claims his rights as a Roman citizen because it was important to be a Roman citizen not just to be an alien a foreigner but a born citizenship of Paul cause he was born a Roman but they s'what happened to the Roman Empire's they started to allow mercenaries are paid mercenaries or bounty hunters to join the army they allowed anybody a alien they allowed a aliens to come in foreigners to come in and they change they started to allow membership to outsiders you know what happened when they allowed outsiders uniformity was lost was it so important anymore they didn't bleed the Roman blood they didn't but they they're they were they were fighting the Roman army but there was no loyalty there to the king uh they they come in and then what happens is discipline was dropped you know why they weren't because to favor larger armies they wanted larger armies so they open it up to everybody and then communication broke down because they didn't all speak the Roman tongue they didn't all speak the same language somewhere or some foreigners didn't speak their language so then commands were not understood those who didn't speak the language didn't understand they didn't have the history there and beyond that there was no loyalty these mercenaries had no loyalty to Caesar they were loyal to themselves as a mercenary you see why it's so important that we hold the standard of the baptism of the Holy Ghost why it's so important Jesus is central doctrine when he first comes on the scene the man must be born again it was the standard of the baptism of the Holy Ghost there is no other way to be part of this family you're not born because your daddy your mommy where was raised or whoever your relative was was a preacher believe the message are they knew brother Brandon that's not how you get a to the army you have to be born into this family it's not my paying ties or singing in church you have to be born in the army even that you notice the Union Army in the Civil War that carried a flag the flags were carried by by the Union Army and the Confederate Army to identify which which army you were from and one of the most important soldiers on the battlefield one of the most important jobs was the flag carrier he was shot quicker than anybody they'd shoot the standard what was it he was the standard bearer and they would shoot him down more than he'd be he'd fall quicker than anybody because the enemy knew that if you killed the standard bearer oh if you killed those that held the standard then there would be mass confusion you didn't know what company you were smoke was going and cannons were flying and shots were being fired he had to look up in the middle of that you had to see what flag you were under am I in the right company am i under the right order am i doing the right thing and they knew that if they would kill the standard-bearer mass confusion would flow and Satan knew if he could kill the standard math.sin would flow like tidal waves mass confusion mass immorality what was the purpose of that standard barrier so that in the heat of the battle the battle got hot when the soldiers became shell-shocked didn't know where they were at didn't know they were in the middle of battle here in gunshots they could look up and see the flag they could see the cross and position themselves oh it stabilized them there their panic it stabilized their emotions it stabilized their fears oh let me say this my brother my sister today we need to hold the flag high we need to hold don't lower your standard but raise up a standard in your homes don't let the yeah yeah yeah if all you have is just an intellectual understanding get into the Word of God say God I want to be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that I could hold the standard high so that I could blow my life can blow a trumpet that'll be a certain sound for my children a certain sound for my family a certain sound to the world let me get under this anointing of this flying eagle my brother my sister we've been long today and we don't have an evening service won't be gathering so just I just trust you give me grace this morning but I just want to say to you today now more than ever before the battles hotter than it's ever been oh people are falling left and right oh the enemy's rushing in like a flood it's a demonic war demonic battle that's taken spiritual wicked it's a spiritual battle it's Satan's Eden this is his world and it's in its at its climax it's at its it's at its maturity all seeds are coming to maturity and they're growing right alongside of us battles hotter than it's ever been shots are being fired and now is not the time to lose the standard now is the time to raise up the standard now is not the time for confusion and to be shelled clear mind spiritually to have clear thoughts spiritually oh if anything this thing has done it should you could see that maybe God said this thing to your life to shake you out of your stupor to shake you out of your sleep the states shake you out of your lukewarmness maybe that's why God sent it to you you need to ask yourself as we preached last Sunday and say God what is this causing to me what's your

a music and that God's trying to play don't be out of sync don't be out of harmony now is the time to synchronize our life there's a certain sound that's coming from the voice of God there's a certain sound oh that's coming from the Word of God it's not a sound of panic it's not a sound of pandemonium it's not a sound of of confusion it's the sound of liberty it's a sound of stability it's a sound of staff soundness and harmony and tranquility and Shalom and you could have it today in your life there I want you to by your heads with me musicians could you come just up just here to the platform

Lord and maybe you could say this today to say Lord and this age of mass confusion and this age of mass panic and pandemonium Oh Lord let me hear that clear trumpet let me hear that clear sound from the Word of God let me hear that certain sound in my life Lord oh Jesus I pray Lord we'd realize here today it's not the opinions that I have is not the opinions of the world or not looking to experts oh don't let us place our our confidence in the arm of flesh oh but we choose to fear the Lord we choose to fear the name of the Lord let us have the confidence that you gave us one standard in this world today you gave one certain sound it's not changed that's never gonna change you're gonna judge the world by that standard Lord let us make sure we're in the right army oh let us realize that we're we're ambassadors of truth let our life be a testimony to the rest of the world god of stability and uncertain times I pray God for each one of us today Lord may we hear this word of God may we say Lord when the enemy comes rushing and like a flood in my home let me raise up a standard against him oh let that standard be the token which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh Lord I can't emphasize that enough to the families here with children Lord those listening this token is not a it's not a Bible the token is not a doctrine it's not a good sermon the tokens not a tape the toga is not a prophet the tokens not a not any man the tokens not a church the token is what your prophet said it was it's the baptism the Holy Ghost lorded unless we have that unless we have that by a true Pentecostal experience not an emotion or not a sensation Lord but something that changes us from the inside of the inside that's the token that's the only thing that will keep us safe from the death angel that's going through the land Laura that's not physical death that we fear it's not physical death that we need to fear it's spiritual death that's striking the world or everyone's focused on so natural death of this Cova night team Lord but there's a much it's a much more lethal spirit that's flowing through the world that spiritual death there is no recovery from that that's why you said in Matthew fear body all the fear Hillman could kill both some body and soul and cast it into the lake of fire that's the spirit we need to fear today Lord let us make sure we have that token that's applied to our heart to our homes as we raise our hands today Lord heads bowed eyes closed say Lord let us have that token that'll keep us safe Lord from all harm let us have that that standard that's raised that Spirit of God may have defense to the rest of the world Lord I pray that you would do it Lord this Christ name Amen god bless you brother Peter could you sing here just for us god bless
