for this opportunity to once again gather in jesus christ's name amen god bless you my friends it's it's good to see each one of you my two brothers back there i don't recognize you welcome raise your hands up there welcome god bless you we're always happy to have visitors and and you're always welcome here sis it's good to see you back there friends from jeffersonville now in tucson bless you oh yeah um what a what a world that we live in now and and what is what's happening in the world and what we're seeing going on is without precedence and it's just it's been on my heart so much over the past few days and thinking about these families that have been have been just destroyed by this horrible thing that's happened in texas and and seeing the many other things that has happened to the to the world and it's it's truly these are perilous times and we know that before the coming of the lord that there are certain signs that we're going to see certain things will be brought before us and they'll be brought before us as signs and if we are in this word and and we're always thinking about this then we'll recognize these signs and when the lord jesus appears to take us away and this rapture happens we'll be ready for it we'll be prepared the bible in the book of revelation says the bride has made herself ready so often we were counting on someone else to make us ready we're counting even on the lord jesus lord jesus make me ready and the lord jesus said i told you to make yourself ready you do all that you can to prepare for the coming be ready and that's what we're seeing now we're seeing things come to light and it's it's uh it's an awful day to live in the bible teaches us that there would become a falling away before the end and i believe friends i believe we're seeing that we're we're seeing uh awful things happen i uh but there is a light at the end of a tunnel and there is a happy ending to the story no matter how bad it is at first a special thing happened to me i'll share it there was um many years ago i'd say it was around in 2012 2013. i was working on a weekend at voice of god and there was another brother that was working there and i was praying i had a place that i would go to underneath the staircase um and i would go in there and pray and i was praying and he really came heavy on my heart what just so happens he was at work and it was it was an off day there weren't people there and i went to his office and i said i said brother i said i feel like you're doubting i feel like that you don't believe this message anymore and he looked at me he said no he says everything's fine and i said well maybe i'm wrong and we talked we talked for a little while longer and he shared some things with me and it just tore my heart out of me some of the things that he was going through and turns out a couple weeks later he quit and he and his wife left brother branham's message they said we don't want anything to do with it anymore and they they can they continued on and they they took the path of of maybe the skeptics and and how that they um they took brother brahm's message and say well there's all these mistakes in it and there's all these things that he he lied about and he said these things that were wrong and they they they went in this direction and and his wife ended up leaving him another man and he just he just his life was it became really hard and i would reach out to him brother lie every once in a while he was always on my heart i would reach out to him every once in a while and and i just sent him a text or i'd call him and he usually wouldn't respond every once in a while he he'd talk to me but he just didn't really want anything to do with me but i didn't let over six months or so go by and i would just send them a text say thinking about you praying praying for you and time went on and he continued on his path i continued on my path and then i was out uh we had a visitor here by the scott winner from alaska a few weeks ago many of you met him he's a good friend of mine but we were up hiking in the catalina mountains and i got a text from that brother from jeffersonville and they said pray for me and uh it scared me i was i was really worried about him and uh i got the feeling that he was going to commit suicide that he was going to take his life that was that's that's how serious i thought it was so i was worried about him and and brother scott and i stopped along the trail and we prayed for him sincerely prayed for him and i i was worried about him all night the next day i was worried about him i got up the nerve to text him again i i said hey how you doing and he said great i said okay good and i left it there my brother adam called me a few days later and he said uh i'm gonna tell you something that's gonna make you feel really good he said uh gary the brother i'm talking about he said he showed showed up for church at brother brad burgess's church where we go to church in jeffersonville and he said he went to the altar came to the altar knelt down renewed his life gave his heart to the lord repented of all all the things that he had done and is now serving the lord as a strong christian so we should never ever cut someone out we should never say that that oh because i hear so often they went out from us because they were not office you have no way to judge that the bible says judge not that ye be not judged we have no reason we can judge the sin but we cannot judge that sinner and i'm so grateful for that for that story and you know i think i think that this world needs people this world needs people like us people that are sincere people that'll make the effort on a wednesday night for the for the robbers back there to drive as far as you drive to come just on a wednesday night and fellowship with us god bless your loyal hearts every one of you so proud of you it's so good to see you you know you're real servants of the lord standing strong i love that your encouragement to me you really are i'm just i'm grateful for that and i i think that lord what can we do and this world is so built around it's so built around ourselves you know we see iphones and ipods and ipads and ios and i i i everything's about me everything's about whoa i have to love myself and i have to put myself first that is a lie that's what the world tells you but that is not what jesus christ taught and that's why we have so much suicide in the world we have so much depression we have all that because we're putting ourselves first and it's rotten when we start putting other people first like our lord jesus taught us then we will find the joy sister surely it'll just well up within us that's where we will find the joy i remember when i was i was a couple days ago i found this book that um some of the all the employees when i left tucson in 2004 all of all the employees they put together and they bound this really nice book for me and had pictures of everybody in there and i was going through it i found it and i i brought it to work and i was going through it and there was a picture of a man a young man he's one of the one of the most talented scientists that we have i work for the government for the department of interior we do environmental research and and climate trends and and water resources and that and he was one of the most up-and-coming scientists that that we had in the government very very bright young man and he ended up committing suicide and i looked at that picture and i thought why did i not see i looked at that picture and i could see that there was pain in that young man's life and i thought why didn't i see that why couldn't his name was jeff why couldn't i see jeff why couldn't i see that he was having trouble at home not because he went to my church or anything else but because he was a soul in need and i look at it i said lord why couldn't i see that why didn't i see it i was too involved in myself in my career and then things going on in my life i was too much about me not to look at this man who was who was in pain he was in dire need i ended up taking his life and i i said lord no more no more i'm tired of serving myself i'm tired of of of the eyes that are in the world i'm tired of all the me that's here i wish i could go back and just put my arm around it take him to lunch spend some time with him but we all have that opportunity now never overlook someone friends it could be at work the vilest sinner but i've seen the vilest sinner come to the lord never overlook anyone always be there god has placed us here he's placed us here according to scripture we see the signs of the times we see this thing that happened in texas that i'm going to talk about in a little bit we see all of this abortion mayhem that's going on i'm going to talk about that in a little bit we see all of these things going on right now these are all signs that we have expected to happen and now they're happening and friends we have a role in all of this and we need to take that role we need to take up our cross and move forward as christ did we are his representatives these are his hands these are his feet this is his mouth that's the way that he does things ever since the day of pentecost that's the way he did it and he's doing it now and we need to take our place and we need to get serious about this if i keep talking about this i'm never going to get to my my scriptures i uh i was i'd go a little bit further i was i was walking i went for a walk the other day i work on campus at the university and it's just an awful place but there's no school going on right now so i decided i was going to go for a walk and and i'm walking i'm walking around and i hear this sound of screaming and hollering a big crowd and i was what is that so it was kind of right my path so i continue on and i'm walking and it gets louder and louder and i hear i hear all this swearing over the uh over the loudspeaker and i get there and there's this giant crowd probably 500 people and they're they're all they're all gathered around and they have all their signs up the most awful looking group of people that you can imagine men with men women with women they're evil signs signs with just things i wouldn't i would never want to repeat to my family saying the most awful things from the loudspeaker and and i go walking by like lord what is this i gotta get to the other side over there so you know i walk walk around and this young woman takes the stage she gets the microphone and she gets up there and she says i am gay non-binary freshman in college and she starts cussing like a sailor it was it was absolutely awful and and the people even the people there were covering their mouths like oh man and this girl's right out of high school and then she makes this statement she says and i'm a christian it's like whoa so i stopped it's like okay you know you just spoke a word of all the words you said you just spoke one that i actually understood so she starts talking this awful talk about abortion and how they have no right to tell us what to do and all of this all of this nonsense this modern nonsense about about uh men and men and women and women and and abortion and how how the white man has no right to tell anybody else and i'm thinking well about a third of these people are actually white men you know but they they were dressed the way they dressed and then a lot of men had makeup on and it was just it was absolutely sodom and gemara and i was standing there and i was afraid not not really afraid i mean i was kind of on guard am i going to take a swing or what but but that evil aggressive spirit was there and it was aggressive it was we are going to come after you violent spirits threatening violence so i listen to this this young woman for a while and and and then i i went my way and i thought you know i thought this is this is a sign of the times and i want to tell you what a prophet said about this subject of abortion just just to to clench it down a little bit sister shirley that he was a prophet because he prophesied you know when when when a prophet is speaking he's speaking in present tense you know and and it was like like isaiah when he said a virgin shall conceive you know the situation that he was in the city was besieged and and and they were in dire need of a savior to come in of a calvary to come in and save the city so the king goes to isaiah and he's like hey hey hey you know pray to god to help us because we've got to get out of here we're starving to death and isaiah says no you pray to god and he says and the king the king says no no ask ask the lord to give you a sign and isaiah said behold the lord will send you a sign a virgin shall conceive a bear and bear a son and they should call his name emmanuel and you know the scripture right in the middle of this this horrible situation and this prophet was speaking for something that was going to happen seven or 800 years later when jesus was born we know that the prophets they speak in present tense and these things may happen thousands of years later let me show you let me tell you what the prophet said just about this the subject of abortion he says this and straight as the gate 1959 my brother do you have it brother jordan he says this he said let let me give you some estimations that'll shake you according to medical science in the city of chicago according to doctor's statistics that there's 30 000 abortion cases in chicago alone and 30 days that the doctors had how many of these little pills and things they take of abortion cases they never had the abortion pill back then it's called prophecy they never had that too recently and here the prophet is just saying like it's going right along and it would be 50 50 years later that this would be fulfilled but i just want to throw that in there this man that we talk so much about that we like to listen to his tapes he was actually a prophet and he spoke things that way back when that are still coming to pass today and they will be for years to come let's turn again i could i could go on and on but let's turn turn to the word luke the 17th chapter and i'm not going to have you stand because i'm just going to keep going on and on brother branham said many times he talked about this luke 17 let's start with verse 26. he talked about this luke 17 and he related it to the ministry of malachi 4. luke 17 26 and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the so shall it also be so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all so they were going along along just like normal normal ways they were in the middle of this sin that was going on and then the flood came let's turn keep your finger in luke and then i'm going to be turning back and forth let's turn to genesis chapter 6. now our lord jesus says he's talking about this in luke he's referring back to the story of noah and we go in genesis chapter 6 now listen to this the lord jesus prophesied of his second coming here's what was going on in noah's day verse 10. and noah begat three sons shem ham and jabeth the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence today and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth and god said unto noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with with the earth and then he talks about the ark now we look at this mass killing that happened in texas i think it's i think that i hadn't checked the news today i think the number was 19 19 kids 19 children killed and then and then at least two adults were also killed and i i don't know anything about this this young man that that killed these children but i'd be willing to guess that he didn't have a godly mother or a godly father i'd be willing to guess that he didn't have a good home life you know when we look we look at the world today and we look at some of these things that happen with with these young people with this this murderer where are his parents where are the ones that raised him the parents so often we hear about divorce and we hear about we hear about splitting up and it's we we see that even the parents it's all about me it's about i well i just i couldn't get along with your dad you know i just couldn't get along with your mom and then there's there's the children there and who suffers because it's all about me i'll tell you a secret for those of you who who have never gotten married you're gonna argue with your spouse and and when you when you argue with your spouse am i right sister do you ever argue with brother aaron it'll be okay do you i'm just i know you do we all just happens it's okay but we put we don't put each other first when we get into these things it's it's not me we come together as a family and if if these differences become so irreconcilable what about all these babies that we have what about your daughters my sister they're the important and that's why you have such a lovely family excuse you and brother and put them first you put them first and you raise them right and that's where i see this young man he probably didn't have parents that raised him right and i feel bad for him i know he committed a horrible crime but i feel what was his destination he was doomed from the start because of probably he didn't have parents that would put the lord first let's uh let's continue on well let's go to in in talking about that and putting ourselves first let's let's go to philippians 2 3. we're going to remember keep keep your finger there on on luke but let's go to philippians chapter two verse three it says this it says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves well what an odd thing to say in this this world of 2022 put the other guy up first don't step in front of him in line let the other guy go i mean we're driving around and you you see you know we're cutting everybody off and going we're christians when we're behind the wheel too let's not forget that we are we're christians all the time and that's what this world is about you know it's it's you know when we're in the car when we're at work or when we're a husband and a wife and they're ready to split up and then there's these babies that are suffering let nothing be done through strife or vainglory verse 4 look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others don't just worry about yourself worry about that other guy let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god he was god he was there but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross that was our example we lower ourselves friends and we put others in front of us we were i was over at my mother-in-law's house last night and uh i wanted to watch the news i wanted to see what was going on with this with this thing so so we turned it on there and we had the talking heads and and depending on who you watched there was an angle there was always a political angle you know you go to fox news and here's the here's the guy saying oh the president he's politicizing this and then you see the president up there the democrat and he is politicizing it he said oh we need to take away all the guns and then we see this other guy over here saying that um that that there need to be stronger gun laws and you see the other ones over here no saying we need more guns we need we need guns in the schools with the teachers and all of this and watching this it's like this is ridiculous everybody just wants their own way and then there was a man there was a man that they interviewed nobody really respected him but uh i think i mean it was on fox i think but but they they brought this man up there and this man nailed it he said even on national tv this man gets up there and he says you know he says politicizing all this stuff won't work he said he said you know he says he says throwing money at the schools he said that's not the answer and that's what the republicans wanted to do they want to put money into the into fortifying the schools making them this big fortress and he said taking the guns away from the people that that's not going to work either and then the man said he said something all that something on order of this he says these people need to be in church and serve the lord jesus he said and only then will things change i thought god blessed that man's loyal heart the whole country just heard that and that is the only thing that will change these things it won't be going out brother lyle and voting for the republican it ain't going to matter it won't be voting for for this one or that one and oh boy i hope this one wins in georgia then then we can get the senate back and all this it's all lost it's all fodder it's all going to burn but if you can get that soul to christ if you can get that soul to the lord jesus if you can lift him up then things and only then will things change and they're going to change and then god is going to come down and he's going to grab that bride take her out satan is going to come down the bride's going to go up tribulation's on and we go to the wedding supper and i want more people at supper i want i want as many people around that table as we can get verse 28 luke verse 28. in chapter 17. likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built it they were going along like everyday life living their life with these sins all around them let's say just like lot did as the lord jesus said here they were surrounded by sodom as we are and it vexed lot's righteous soul i believe it was peter that said it vexed lot's righteous soul daily but he stayed there it bothered him he struggled with it but he he just couldn't break free of it it's it's a perfect parallel brother let's go to ezekiel chapter nine we're surrounded by by these sins and it bothers us but it doesn't bother us enough it doesn't bother us enough to drive us to our knees unless it's one of our children unless it's one of our loved ones then it drives us to our knees but it should drive us to our knees with the sins that are throughout the world ezekiel chapter 9 it says this verse 3. and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer's ink horn by his side and the lord said unto him grow go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof all the abominations not just the ones from our loved ones and friends those are the only ones that were sealed those are the only ones that made it and jesus is saying here as it was in the days of lot so will it be at the second coming of christ let's continue on with with ezekiel here we all know that scripture but we might not know the rest of it verse 5 and to the others he said in mine hearing this is ezekiel speaking go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary oh my then they began at the ancient men which were before the house what a sobering scripture those that had the seal of god that sighed and cried for these sins that are going on around us now they were sealed and those that weren't sighing and crying they were lost they were killed it scares me i think lord where am i where am i i try to put myself in the scripture where is daniel evans in this where are we for the life sister heather where are we place ourselves in the scripture verse 29 in chapter in luke you know i think about lot and lot wasn't even the right one even though it did vex his soul he was still not where he should have been i mean he he left sodom and then he went and and had two children with his two daughters and and and then the these they started this raid the race of the moabites and anime nights and there were problems throughout history that came from lot even lot wasn't right even though it bothered him now the sins of the world it bothers us but do we sigh and do we really cry for these things verse 29. but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed i always wondered as a young man i listened to brother braham's tapes and i always wondered why brother branham so often related this luke 17 30 17 28-30 why did he relate that to his ministry and and as a young man i couldn't make it fit i couldn't i could take the scriptures and i could read it and i was i was always like i don't understand that why why does that pertain to brother branham's ministry and remember what i said about a prophet speaking in present time it wasn't happening back then but now we see we see this situation that lot was in and now we all find ourselves right there i have a friend in jeffersonville his name's alex williams but alex was telling me he uh he opened up a chain of um asian food restaurants in um asheville i think it is asheville north carolina and he he was doing well and on his menu he had a lot of he had bible verses you know he had the jesus fish he wanted to make sure everybody knew that he was a christian and he made a stand well alex told me he said i got a call from the mayor and he said hey um i would suggest you take that stuff off of your menus and i'll say i'm not taking this off he says what are you talking about remember lot in the days of sodom he says we're getting we're getting complaints and he said the mayor said i would recommend that you take them take this stuff off alex you're going to be sorry alex said i'm not going to do it no then alex started getting reviews on yelp google and the different ones lies about his restaurant unsanitary conditions i found a roach in in my plate i found hair in my plate all of these things they were lies and you know who perpetrated it the homosexual lobby they got together and formed a boycott against brother alex and his in his restaurants put him out of business he had to leave it destroyed his business because he made a stand for christianity you make a stand for christianity there's a boycott the prophet prophesied about a boycott we see it right there in asheville north carolina and now and brother alex williams i was a daniel a couple years ago oh my this is my son by the way it's good to have him here proud of the boy daniel was um he was uh getting uh some some trying to get some classes together at pima community college honey i think it was daniel see daniel madeline trying to get some classes together at pima community college and um stephanie and daniel were were in the school and and i was waiting it was going to take like an hour for um for them to get finished so there was a pot a park by the west campus of pima i saw it there when we drove in so i i drove back out dropped them off and i drove and i started walking through this park and i'll tell you what it was a creepy feeling there was a bunch of men in the parking lot each one in their own vehicles probably 10 trucks 10 cars and i got out of my car and i thought this doesn't feel right and i said well i'm going to just go for a walk you know in the trail and i go walking and these men start following me and i'm like all right you know this is going to be fight or flight here pretty soon so so i'm walking along and i'm getting these these weird feelings and then they started coming out of the of the desert and i'm on the trail and i'm like i'm starting to freak out you know they're all by themselves you talk about a a horribly creepy feeling i know how lot felt and sodom so i'm walking along and and you know they're making they're they're making like gestures and and and i'm walking by and i gotta get out of here i got out got in the car took off get back to the parking lot and i started typing him okay what is going on here so i i searched this park and yes it was a pickup place for the those kind of people it was scary and you look at lot you look at lot in in this in this place and lot is he's he's uh intimidated by these people these men when they came to his door they had power that lot didn't have even though he was the mayor of the city he was afraid of them so they came in and lot they they threatened lot he was afraid of them and and you know the story so now we find ourselves in this day in that in this time as it was in the days of lot verse uh and friends i i look at i talk about this that's a sin and it's a sin that's not above any other sin you know it's a particularly kind of dirty sin but those those people can be children of god i'm not condemning those people that struggle with that believe me i promise you i'm not i pray for them it's a sin like any other sin but my point in saying this is it's a sign it's a sign of the last days it's not the unpardonable sin it's it shows us where we are at verse 31 in that day he would shall be upon the housetop he he would shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back verse 32 remember lot's wife and we know what what happened to lot's wife let me read you a quote what brother branham said jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever 6207 07 18 thank you my brother brother brown said this he said i believe that lot's wife as she was commanded by the angel not to look back and she turned and looked back and she stands today a pillar of salt because she just misbelieved god's word that much now she had better reason now she had a better reason than you and i have see her children and her grandchildren were burning up in the judgments of god and the screams of her own children and her grandchildren and the mother's heart crying out just disobeyed god's word enough to look over her shoulder and there she turned wow just that little bit she just looked back and put it put yourselves in that situation all of us i might have done i pray i wouldn't have but you can see how that that lady would do that i think of i think of nellie sanders and i know the story about nelly sanders how she she she gave her heart to the lord and she used to be a dancer and then and then she went by the dance hall and she just stopped for a moment and friends let me tell you there are pitfalls and there are traps everywhere for all of us you think because we have a little age on us that those traps aren't aren't there for us they're there for us right there for us brother every one of us satan wants each one of us not only does he want us he wants to hurt our influence also he's there for our children he's he's always after us and uh let's continue on where was i at verse verse 33 whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it remember what i said about preferring your brother seek the well-being being of the other person jesus continues on he says i'll tell i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinded together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left now we know from brother branham's ministry that he's talking about there'll be two in the field here there'll be two in the bed here he's talking about there on different parts of the world there'll be two sleeping when the rapture happens over here they'll be out working and the rapture will happen it'll be a it'll be a rapture at the same time and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is tither will the eagles be gathered together in other words where the carcass is where the slain lamb is where the word is that's where we will be gathered together and i say we because i'm part of it there's a movement friends there's a movement and it it started the the enemy is so good at what he does there's a movement to keep us out of church to keep us out of fellowship i thank god that we can tune in and and god bless you all that are streaming in but there's a movement to take the people out of church to prevent their fellowship and and we hear things like well you know i get fed i get fed at home you know or or well i i watch this brother on on youtube or that that brother and that's where i get fed or other ones say well we just stay home and we just listen to tapes we feed on the unadulterated word of god brother we just we love the prophet's message and we just stay home and listen to tapes i i i it's all about me it's all about how i can be fed but are we bringing our gift to church what about the other person what about what about coming to church and maybe a gift would operate in you sister your your your talent on the piano how could you share that talent with us if you're at home you can't but god bless you for being here so we can be blessed by it you know i see jeremy and angel i see you here every service god bless you for being here you come here and it's a it's a strength to us brother lyle isn't that wonderful to see these people as you're up here ministering it is such it's it's just as much of a blessing for me up here to feel that but you stay home you know maybe you're not hurting yourself but you're hurting me it hurts me it hurts sister surely it hurts my son it hurts it hurts the gear is here for everybody to stay home we need you how can the gifts operate if we want to see tongues and we want to see prophecies and we want to see healing how can it operate if we're at home it's impossible you see the devil's tactic he's sly he gets in there and he says what i'm going to do is i'm going to separate them and we're going to be thinking about it's just me i just i'm just going to you know i just i just feed on this and i just love this and and i like brother lyle but i don't like brother dan you know what just come you know i'll i'll wear you out i'll keep i'll keep pushing and i'll keep trying and finally i'll say something that'll be a blessing but but you come and you'll be a blessing to me because we want the gifts we want the gifts in church and they can't operate with a divided body let's continue on i um let's go to hebrews chapter 10 we'll move from luke and i still have a few minutes um i'm never going to finish by the way on this one so maybe i'll pick it up at another time but i'm just going to keep going until until they tell me to leave [Laughter] stay back there brother ed hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another oh i'm getting there let us consider one another now the apostle here is a very important topic let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works verse 25 no not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching and friends i i tried to lay a foundation for this tried to show the the hours that we're living in tried to show the violence that we're in according to luke 17 and according to the book of genesis with noah and and and to show the the um the immorality that's happening for this point right here and so much more as you see the day approaching we've got to stand strong together for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin why would the apostle put that right after that sentence don't forsake assembling together but if we sin willfully whoa why would he say that right after that right after that we know we should be here and it's the ministry's job we need to make it a blessing to be here we need to do our best study as well as we can pray that we might be refreshing to the people so that the people want to come and then also the people have to come so that the other people are blessed remember the body of christ it's fitly joined together i gave the analogy one time of a puzzle and this puzzle this body of christ is put together and when when they're all piled up they all look the same but you start putting them together and it starts forming the image of of the the painting or the masterpiece whatever it is and each piece is placed in there and it is not complete until sister surely sitting right there it is not complete until every piece is placed and each one of us are a police piece and there's a bunch of pieces missing and i'm not just talking to the people streaming i'm saying the church body as a whole throughout the world each of those pieces have to take their place and i'm responsible for this piece right here and i want to make sure that i am right let's uh have time let's go to second timothy chapter 3. ii timothy 3 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come brother branham himself said that's today for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters plow proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy friends this is a social media age what is social media about it's about promoting yourself it is i'm not against social media i i you know i don't partake in it but i'm not against social media but it is designed to glorify ourselves amen it is and it's you look at right here lovers of their own selves can you imagine putting a pic when we were kids putting a picture of myself up in my room or something and and now i mean it's we have these pages it's all pictures about us and it's like you know you see pictures like they don't look like that i know that person they know that's the best picture they ever took it's all photoshopped and you know and you know thin where it should be thinned and you know and everything it's like it's not even real and now and then we see these so-called influencers and these influencers they they make it to where everybody should look the same they all have the big eyelashes and the paint and the and they all look the same and and it's like what they look like you have these women we saw on that same news program i shouldn't watch i mean i watched the news like whoa it really messed me up i mean i think it scarred me watching that bit of news last night but both me and stephanie and merrily are watching and they had this this woman on there that um she was a normal fox newscaster and she had some kind of work done and her face was squeezed back and it's like oh you look like all the other ones and they look like a catfish their face is squeezed back their lips are all sticking out it's like you look like everybody else they want uniformity and we're different we're all different pieces all of us are different but the world wants us to conform to their way i'm not watching the news anymore without natural affections that's an intimate word without natural affections truth-bakers false accusers incontinent word incontinent they can't control themselves they fly off at every little thing any little bit of criticism they fight back they have bad tempers fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away they may go to church they may study their bibles they may listen to tapes they uh but there's always an excuse why the power of god isn't present there's always an excuse why we don't see the gifts in the church there's always an excuse why we don't see the healings that we should oh someone so got healed one time there's always an excuse why that that we don't see these things i remember i think it was gideon that said if god be with us then where are all the miracles amen and i say the same thing if god is with us i'm not talking about the tucson tabernacle i'm talking about christianity in general i'm talking about the message in general if god is with us then where are these miracles that we saw in the 1950s they should be with us god is a supernatural god for this for of this sort are they which creep into houses and leave captive silly women laden with sins and led away with diverse lusts that word lust doesn't necessarily mean like the lust that we think about is just different passions different desires ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth they're constantly studying the word looking at it but they're looking at it through denominational eyes they're looking at it with their own way of thinking i preached that message on images they're looking at it through their own glasses and all they are seeing is what agrees with their doctrines it has to agree with my doctrine or it's out and then they ignore the rest of it and that's that's what we're seeing here and uh let's let's go over to verse let's go over to chapter four in second timothy i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears now friends that scripture is very important for a church that scripture is very important we see these mega churches out there and it's like just love one another and friends if we just love one another and we just are good people and and you make your offering if you just make an offering for a thousand dollars then brother then then god would just pour out his blessings nonsense it is not about that so the people go it's like oh i just pay a little bit i can do that that's the kind of preacher i want to hear i don't want to hear any correction so then they go and they they get these preachers that are just going to say what's according to their doctrines not bring any correction not bring any changes not not preach that there's something wrong if we're not having miracles not say that not say where are the gifts where are the tongues not say not say where is the healing not say where is the prophecy but oh you're good because you have the word oh that's what i want to hear and it's the congregation it's the people that are drawing this out and then they that these teachers these these people are hearing what they want to hear and they're drawing that out of these men and that's what this scripture is talking about here for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their hearts from the truth and it shall be turned unto fables it runs many of the things that we hear just are simply not true everything should be checked with this word and not just reading this word but the holy spirit inside of you will quicken this word amen because you see that they twist this word will be twisted and this laodicean age this lukewarm age where people are into their own thing it's all about me don't want to make an effort that's when we have to look into this book and we're all pulled by it all of us there's many times we don't want to do it but we have to take a step and we have to do it and don't be part of this laodicean lazy spirit and they shall turn i'm going to read it again and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables ii timothy chapter 4 brother branham was led in 1933 when he built the branham tabernacle wrote that scripture on a piece of paper and dropped it in the cornerstone of the branham tabernacle that's how much that scripture pertains to today we need to always be watchful always be into the word like i said i'm never going to finish it's uh sister sisters if you come brother aaron i'm going to ask you to close here in a moment revelation chapter 19. you know when when you read your bible when you really study it there's these books called the prophets amos malachi and and and in all of these books they really hammer the people but then almost always god comes comes out at the end and he gives you some encouragement you know it's it's the book of jonah it's like boom boom boom and then oh here but it's going to be okay and that's usually god's theme he he brings a prophet that prophet brings correction but then there's hope there's hope associated with his message and he always gives us hope revelation chapter 19 verse 5. and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready we're doing it now and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he sayeth unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god and i fell down at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see that thou do it not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy amen and uh i'll close with one more scripture in mark chapter 13. and i'll start with verse 35 brother jordan now let's start with verse 33 mark chapter 13 verse 33 take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is for the son of man is a is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even at midnight at the crowing or in the morning unless coming suddenly he finds you sleeping and what i say unto you i say and all watch friends we have seen the signs the times i hope that i have a lot there's there's a lot more on there let's stand there's there's a lot more there that we could talk about that we could fellowship about knowing that these signs that have come before us but as the lord jesus instructed let's watch watch these things happen and when i talk about these sins i'm not talking about the sinner these sins are signs maybe at another time we could talk about the sins and and and how that we should stay away from those but but i'm talking about these sins or signs now we have to be careful and we have to pray don't miss church we need to be here not for ourselves but for the ones sitting next to us and then we'll see this puzzle come together and we'll see the gifts start to operate we'll see the love flowing and we'll see the coming of our lord jesus let's uh i'm going to come down let's let's pray let's bow our heads just think about him friends for a minute we have our prayer services sometimes on wednesday lord don't friends don't take those for granted either it's nice to come together and pray with each other just think about him think about the signs that's happened think about the grace of god that he would warn us and it's time you send a messenger a prophet to warn us he gave us his word and friends he gave us each other almighty god oh lord you're so good you're such a precious precious lord to us we thank you for this bible lord we thank you for your spirit lord please accept our repentance for not taking it seriously enough we pray lord that this little wednesday meeting with just a few people here lord that it would not return back void but it would accomplish what you have for it oh god we're so grateful thank you lord thank you for a church that we can get together we thank you lord for a roof over our heads we thank you we thank you for a nice comfortable place lord we thank you for each other most of all lord we thank you for your blood oh god may you be glorified in our lives if there be anything that's hindering us lord we pray that we can lay it at the altar today laid upon the slain lamb as the priest would lay his hands upon the bloody lamb and slay it lord we lay our hands upon you we lay our sins upon you lord you were not worthy of these sins we're worthy of these sins but lord we weren't able to take these on ourselves and neither is an animal jesus christ could and we lay these sins upon you [Music] and we ask o god forgiveness lord and help us to win other souls to christ father may your will be done in our lives and father as we pray and as we seek your will we pray that our our hearts would be pure motives would be right that you'd guide us lord should guide us to lost souls to bring to you we love you we thank you thank you lord that you could read your bible read your word to this congregation may your will be done almighty god in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you my friends thank you bless you my brother [Music] i'll change my heart oh god [Music] make it ever true change my heart oh god may i be like you change my heart oh god make it ever true my heart oh god may i be like you you are the partner [Music] [Applause] this is what i pray change my heart oh god make it ever true [Music] may i be like you [Music] you know i know the lord this afternoon as it was a little bit after work and sat down and that scripture says know ye not ye are the temple of the holy ghost i just began to think of that for a little while this afternoon being the temple of the holy ghost clean pure sanctified for the presence of god for himself to dwell in us and then we would take them to places where we would shouldn't be listen to things we shouldn't be hearing when you have to say lord let me let me respect you reverence you so that you could be manifested in us and then others would say there's something that i need that's what i desire let's just pray lord it's a serious time we're living in it's um on one side of it's a glorious day because we see how soon you're coming how close it is these things are as it's finishing up lord you said to look up our redemption draweth nigh when you see these things begin to happen but lord our heart also cries out for those lord who are still struggling still going maybe maybe have turned their back on and just doesn't seem to work for them lord our heart still reaches out to them when you see these things happening lord just as you looked over israel you looked at jerusalem and you said oh jerusalem and you listen how oft would i have drawn you under my knees but you would not lord it's the same spirit in us lord hearing brother daniel minister that this lord let it be let it be let our light so shine let us be a a cool drink of water to somebody lord an inspiration that would give them hope lord jesus more than a hope saying how can i have what you have lord this water this that you place on it's not for ourselves it's to give out like that that little brook that brother branham would talk about and he said it's just within me it comes out it's there for everybody to share of lord let it be it's our prayer lord this evening thank you for that tonight lord thank you for that lord in jesus christ amen there's a verse to that song covenant this world's vain riches that so rapidly decay he

won't get a different answer than i get from you you'll stand together and it pays off it pays off because your children will come back to you and say help i had a neighbor i've shared this at a neighbor when we were kids and they had a tv at home and i wanted to go to their house to watch cartoons but they always wanted to be at our house and one day we went to their house lived up the street and we were there watching cartoons and in about 10 15 minutes his little brother comes running out the room and says mom and dad are out again at it again let's start let's get out of here and then you heard the banging dad was hitting mom with a frying pan they were going at each other and we ran down we ran back to my house and my friend said that's why i'd rather be at your house that
