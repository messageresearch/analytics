Jesus Christ rest upon each one present here in Jesus name amen before I have you seated I'd like to read from Romans the 11th chapter may seem like a familiar verse but I believe it's going to this service is going to mean a lot to us Romans chapter 11 verse 25. it says this for I would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that the blindness in part has happened to Israel unto the fullness of the Gentiles become in the Apostle Paul right here is talking about the Gentile dispensation that started two thousand years ago and it is ending very soon and so all Israel shall be saved that is is written there shall come out of Zion out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes he's speaking of the Jewish people now listen to this for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance what that means is almost every other translation says for the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable keep that scripture in mind today as we go through service because it's going to keep coming up as we go through scripture scripture after scripture you can take your seats first let me welcome all the visitors God bless you all we got some assistant more of sister Amelia's family here brother God bless you and the family welcome we appreciate having you um and uh I see more visitors God bless you all we're always honored to have people come and join us um a little lady right here is a visitor sister Shirley good it's good to have you back sister Shirley back from your long trip brother Merle and sister Roberta God bless you welcome welcome home it's good to come back to 105 degrees isn't it it's good to have you back last Sunday I talked about this man Samson and I I gave a uh just a whirlwind overview of this man Samson's life and I'd like to go back to Samson and thinking about these this scripture that these gifts and callings are irrevocable and think about these gifts that Samson had in his life and I want to compare them to another man that's in the Bible and his name is Balaam so Samson I'll review a little bit from last week's Samson had this gift in his life he had made a vow in his his vow was never to cut his hair and he knew that from the prophecy of the angel that his strength was was in his long hair and if he was to cut this hair he would break that Covenant with God and he would lose his strength and we went through last week about how powerful this man Samson was and how he sought an occasion to fight against this evil empire that was controlling Israel at that time called the Philistines very evil people idolaters very heavy-handed as far as their treatment of Israel and Samson God raised up this man Samson to judge we the Bible says judge it or Israel but it's actually to be a leader to be a protector of Israel of this country and to fight off these Philistines and to keep them from hurting God's people Israel so Samson was successful in many of his battles he was never unsuccessful and then the Philistines are upset they make a deal with the people that they are ruling over with the with the people of Israel and they say Deliver Us Samson and we're going to come in and we're going to make your life very very difficult so the people of Israel were afraid so they came to Samson now remember Samson's gift wasn't against his own people it was against the Philistines so when they came to Samson Samson says listen he says but just make sure you don't kill me because his gift as I said he it wasn't powerful against his own people he's powerful against these other people they said no that's fine so they bound him his hands and they they took him and they delivered him to the Philistines out in this field and the they they leave him there and then Samson sees out in the distance he sees just hundreds and hundreds of philistine Warriors coming to get him Samson the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Samson salmon Sampson breaks his binds he looks down and there's the skeleton of a donkey out in the field he picks up the Jawbone from this donkey and he starts wailing on these Philistines and ends up killing a thousand of them every one anointed of the Lord a powerful anointed anointing that was on this man Samson so as all the Philistines they're all laying around he piles them all up up in a in a heap and and he ends up naming the mountain Jawbone Hill it's a great name I wonder if it's still named that so then he's tired the anointing leaves him and he gets thirsty and it shows you how fragile our lives are no matter how much anointing we have no matter how much of power we'll have when we operate outside of that anointing then we are completely just dependent on the Lord so Samson sits down he's dying of thirst and and he he says Lord you made this great Victory he said he says I'm dying of thirst and then God opens up spring and then Samson drinks from the spring the the a miracle another miracle of God so we see that this man Samson when he's operating in this anointing how powerful that Samson was so then Samson the Bible says that Samson judges Israel for the space of about 20 years so he's Israel's protector for this 20 years then in judges 16. and I'm just I'm just going to read it um this is the Bible judges 16 chapter 1 says this then went Samson to Gaza and saw there a harlot and went in unto her remember Samson's weakness was worldly what we would call not Christian girls and it was told the Gazette saying Samson has come hither and they compassed him in and laid weight for him all night in the gate of the city and require it all the nights saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him and Samson lay until midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and picked them up on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the hill that is before Hebron and it came to pass afterwards that he loved a woman in the valley of sork whose name was Delilah you know this the story there and what happened was Samson had the anointing again Came Upon Samson remember it was it was his gift was against the Philistines he came to this gate they were going to trap him in the city and he picked up this gate superhuman strength throws it on his shoulders walks up to the top of a hill near another city and sits down and as I was pondering on that scripture I was thinking Lord Samson what did he do the night before what I just read and yet you honored him in such a way that he would be able to pick up this gate and Escape these these assassins that were coming to kill him and he had just spent the whole night in sin I thought Lord Lord how how could how could that be and then that scripture that I ca that I just read came to mind that the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable so if you have a gift that God has given you that gift you can use it for the Lord as Samson did with his gift with his hair and destroying Philistines or you can use it for yourself or you can use it for Satan to serve the enemy so Samson here it didn't matter what he was doing he was sinning he was he was doing all had all these problems but yet he still had that gift by the promise of God he didn't take it away from him Samson was lived his whole life with that gift and you'll notice at the end of his life when he meets this this girl that's gonna eventually lead him to his death named Delilah when he meets this girl he didn't want to cut his hair he still wanted to keep that vow between him and the Lord he was tricked into doing it so then Samson's hairs cut he goes the the uh he's he's gets bound they take a prisoner they gouge out his eyes and he's blind and they're they're rejoicing over this great warrior that's killed so many of the Philistines and all these idolaters they're thinking oh great we have killed this man we've taken this man's Samson um captive and we we have triumphed over to him and then they want to bring Samson out and they want to show everybody how powerful we are and they bring Samson he's bound they take him to the stadium they put them between the two pillars and in Samson's death that gift he lost his hair his hair the gift began to come back he put his hands on the two pillars he bowed himself he pushed the pillars apart the whole stadium that they were in came down upon Samson killed him and 3 000 Philistines remember his commission his commission was to kill Philistines three thousand of them he killed in his death so in his death he killed more than in all of his life but you notice that gift never that Covenant never left Samson that gift never left Samson unless he did the one thing that prevented him from using that gift which was cut his hair and his weakness was with women and I and I see that oh a big part of the problem that is in our youth and in people today is they get yoked up with the wrong man or the wrong woman and it causes problems it causes it'll ruin your life and I talked about that last week and I want to just reiterate that to be careful of who you marry of who you date because when you open that door you may never be able to recover you may forsake that happiness that the Lord promised you because you made you made this choice in life so Samson went through and eventually his demise was caused from this girl that he met and uh that betrayed him and as I was reading that I thought that there was another man hundreds of years earlier that also had a gift probably a gift greater than Samson's and it ended up in the same way and that's this man Balaam now who Balaam was he was a very one of the most gifted people that I have read about in this book it was just an incredible man So what had happened is Moses now let's go back hundreds of years from Samson and now we're going to get into Moses Moses had come out of Egypt they were wandering around in the desert for about 40 years and they get to this place that's full of these people called the amorites they get to this country so Moses and and the people of Israel they send a message to the king of the amorites and they say Hey listen we want to just walk through your country we won't eat your food we won't take anything we just want to walk along the highway we won't even drink your water just let us go now there was between one and two million of these people so the the king of the amorites his name I believe was cyhon he looks down and he sees all of these people he's like you're not coming through my country no way you'll eat all my food and do all this and even though they said no no we're not going to do that we just want to walk through so what saihan does is he said okay he sends an army down to kill Israel so Israel is they defend themselves and they laid waste to this entire country these people came down to attack Israel God was with Israel it was Battle after battle win after win after win they started killing them taking cities burning the cities everything everything just went Moses's way conquered the whole country so then there's this other guy there's this other king and they're headed north or they're headed this way and that is Moab so this king of Moab he's looking down maybe he gets up on a mountain and he sees all the City's burning in his neighboring country and he's like oh and here the spies come into Moab and their Moab is going to be the next place that these people of Israel go through so this King his name is balak balak looks down and he sees and he sees wow he says God is with these people now he's got his own God he's like wow my God doesn't even do anything but they're God's real their God actually he actually does stuff he actually fights for them my God is uh well he's just a statue basically when I pray to him nothing really happens he's just it's a piece of wood there and that's what they were worshiping but he sees this God they call them Jehovah wow he actually does stuff and he must have seen he must have looked down and maybe saw that Pillar of Fire at night leading these Hebrews maybe that pillar of cloud in the day down there like I can't I can't compete with this God so what I need to do is I need to get this God that's leading those people I need to get them on my side and then he can curse them so how do you do that if you're a heathen what's the best way to do it huh you know pay him off because that's that's the way that's the way you think that's the way you get your way as a king so he starts looking and he says well there's this prophet of God that actually knows that Hebrew God this Jehovah and this man is a very Gifted Man I'll get a hold of him and then he can convince this God to curse these people of Israel because whatever this man blesses is blessed and whatever this man curses is cursed that man's name was Balaam great powerful prophet of God so he knew he had he had heard all this about this man Balaam so he gets he sends people over to Balaam and they have their money let's go to uh numbers chapter 22 we'll start with verse 7. sorry Brothers I've messed you up twice on my scriptures Numbers 22 7. so what he does is he sends these people over to this man named Balaam on behalf of balak so balak sends his people over there we're on the same page and it says this and the Elders of Moab and the Elders of Midian departed with the rewards of Divination in their hand some some translations call it sooth saying others call it uh um it was it was like witchcraft so basically this man Balaam also had the reputation of practicing idolatry type stuff so the elements of Moab and the Elders of Midian departed with the rewards of Divination in their hand and they came unto Balaam and spake unto him the words of balak and he said unto them Lodge here this night and I will bring you word again as the Lord shall speak unto me and the princes of Moab Abode with Balaam now Balaam had faith that Jehovah was going to speak back to him when he went before God remember he was A Gifted Man no matter how many problems that he had God had still given him that gift honest or not a lover of filthy money or not Balaam was still a very gifted prophet and God came unto Balaam and said what men are these with thee right there and God came unto Balaam imagine you got over here who knows how many 50 miles maybe or less you have this group of a couple million people and God would just come to Moses and a little bit to Aaron and it was such a rare thing that God would show himself this man Balaam was so gifted God just came down and spoke to him God came to Balaam and said what men are these with thee and Balaam said unto God balach the son of zippor King of Moab hath sent unto me saying behold there is a people come out of Egypt with which covereth the face of the earth now come curse me them pair adventure adventure I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out and God said unto Balaam Thou shalt not go with them remember that and God said unto Balaam Thou shalt not go with them Thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed and then Balaam goes back to the messengers and tells them what God told them and he refers refuses to curse Israel The Messengers go back to balak so the king sends more respected Messengers now to Balaam Balaam had a weakness so now the king he sends these princes with a lot more money and a lot more power and they come to Balaam and they made Balaam a much better offer basically they came to Balaam and said hey you can have whatever you want just curse this People Israel Balaam had already been told no by God remember what I said before God said don't do it so Balaam sees the money and you see right now you see his weakness and he's like wow I can have that uh I would like um maybe I'll ask God again because I I really want it I really and he's thinking in his mind he's making excuses he's justifying himself and how many times have we been in that position where we will maybe feel a leading of God but we are get we have over here the hope of something that we really want and you've all seen it I've seen it we've probably all done it we make an excuse to why we can have what we want skip to verse 18. and Bala answered and said well first of all Balaam goes back and he goes before the Lord and Balaam answered and said unto the Servants of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God to do less or more sounds pretty good doesn't he man this Balaam sounds like an all right type of guy he sounds like a real real prophet in the Old Testament way but let me tell you he was an absolutely evil man which we will get to in a little bit God had already told him no Balaam came back and asked again do you think God changed his mind well Balaam yeah I guess since they're going to double your money yeah that's a good idea maybe I was wrong about that no God is right every time he's Sovereign he was right he said don't go the first time so here's Balaam he says well are you sure I'll skip to verse 22. now Balaam God tells Balaam he says okay go but only do what I tell you so then Balaam says okay good so he he gets on his donkey and he goes and God's anger was kindled against Balaam because he went God had just told him go ahead and then God's God's anger is kindled against Balaam because he went but he should have known he God had already told him don't go so he's riding this donkey thank you and God's anger was kindled against him because he went and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him so he's writing on this donkey and this donkey you know I love the Bible the the Bible is just it's it's a tremendous book and there's some things in the Bible that when you read him you're like well I never thought that was going to happen so what's happening is balaam's riding this donkey and this donkey sees they're in a little tight Corridor maybe like between these two rows of pews here and they're riding along the donkey sees the angel of the Lord there standing with the sword and he the donkey's like oh and Balaam doesn't see it probably because he was thinking about the money maybe thinking about what he was getting so balaam's kicking the donkey and the poor little guy he's he's like no way if I go there I'm gonna die so he's he's trying to he's trying to protect himself and he's trying to protect the guy that's riding on him and he like leans up against the wall and smashes balon's foot and Balaam is upset so he starts beating the Donkey and then the donkey talks he did it's the oddest thing and the donkey is basically like hey haven't I been a good donkey to you I've served you I've I've I've I've I've been a I've been a good I've been a good servant I've taken you I've carried you and balaam's like if I had a sword I'd kill you right now you won't do what I say it makes me think more about my pets you know I remember my dog one time I was riding my mower and this is back in Jeffersonville it's where we mow grass and I was riding the mower and this little rabbit runs out of this hole and I see the rabbit take off and we had this dog that was 150 pounds which is what's called a greater Swiss mountain dog she looks like a Saint Bernard and we had a vinyl fence you know with the pickets and the the fence was was more of a deterrence to the dog and not a barrier so this rabbit comes running out and my dog plows through the fence runs and grabs the rabbit and I jumped off the mower and I started chasing her name is Lady um she didn't live up to her to her name so she's running with the rabbit in her mouth and I'm chasing her I'm yelling at her and if I could have caught her I'd have beat her to death and and she's got these two t these two legs sticking out her mouth and she's running and I'm chasing her and she got the thing down before I could catch her oh you stupid dog and upset and I was as I was reading this story even this morning I was like that donkey talked to Balaam I'd like to have a conversation with my dog later on when we get to heaven and and then we understand more but here this donkey is and finally God opens the eyes of this man and he sees the angel of the Lord there and the angel of the Lord says listen basically the only reason you're alive is because of that donkey so Balaam repents the angel of the Lord says keep going do what you're going to do but only do what I tell you to do so we go to chapter 23 verse 1 and Balaam said so Balaam gets to the king and Balaam said under balak build me here seven altars and prepare me hear seven oxen and seven Rams and Balaam did as Balaam had spoken and balak and Balaam offered on every altar of Bullock and a ram exactly the same as the Israelites would offer unto Jehovah you see the gift coming out in Bala verse number five and the Lord put a word in balaam's mouth and said return unto balach and thus shall thou thus Thou shalt speak and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he and all the princes of Moab and he took up his Parable and said balak the king of Moab hath brought me from amram out of the mountains of the East saying come curse me Jacob Jacob is Israel and come and defy Israel how shall I curse whom God has not cursed or how shall I defy whom whom the Lord hath not defied from the top of the Rocks I see him and from the hills I Behold Him and lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the Nations who can count the dust of Jacob and the number of the fourth part of Israel let me die the death of righteousness and let my last in be like his so here's Balaam saying his his prayer is is I want to be like Israel on and on balak ass Balaam to curse Israel two more times he goes and he offers a burnt offering the same thing he keeps blessing him even towards Balaam even prophesied of the coming Messiah amazing this man Balaam and he keeps asking God and God keeps giving him the answer and he keeps coming back to balak and he keeps saying no he keeps blessing Israel and Bale acts like I'm getting so sick and tired of this he says here one more time let's do this again just don't bless him and then He blesses them again so we go through these few chapters of balak the king of Moab and Balaam this prophet and every time he's offering him money and every time balaam's operating within his gift his prophetic gift and he goes and he sets up an altar he does exactly what God requires and he comes back God speaks to him and he comes back and he says no don't do it God will bless Israel and balak is he gets upset balen gets upset and they go their way separate now something happens between the end of chapter 24 and chapter 25 here in the Book of Numbers that's not recorded in numbers but it is recorded elsewhere in the New Testament it's amazing to me sometime how these these brothers that wrote the New Testament how they knew these details that aren't recorded in the Bible that we have I don't know if it's a holy spirit that told them if it was the the oral tradition that come that came down but they knew and so something happens in here between 24 and 25 Balaam would not curse Israel balac needed it and things go south and I have to admit the hardest thing as a minister the hardest thing for me that as as I've been in the ministry is to see that the people won't change that the people won't change their lives no matter how much you get up here and you preach and you do your best you see the people and they're raising their children to make the same mistakes that they made they go in and they continue to make the same mistakes people gossiping and losing their tempers not making sacrifices for anyone other than themselves always putting themselves above everyone else not being generous sleeping around before they're married getting offended at every little thing you should never be offended we should never be offended at anything we should walk in the spirit of God but it continues to happen we should never criticize other people yet we continue to criticize and it's the same thing with this man Balaam he was gonna do what he was going to do and I see that spirit so much in US I'm gonna do it it doesn't matter if I know that it's right I'm going to come up with an excuse I am going to get my way and that was this man Balaam so what did he do between chapter 24 and chapter 25. let's go to Second Peter let's go over the New Testament let's go to Second Peter chapter 2. it's a mystery what happens between these two chapters Peter speaking second Peter chapter 2 verse 12. Peter speaking he says this but these As Natural brute beasts but these As Natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they counted pleasure to Riot in the daytime spots they are in blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they Feast with you having eyes full of adultery and cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable Souls listen closely beguiling unstable Souls a heart they have exercised with Covetous practices cursed children which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of Balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with a man's voice forbade The Madness of the Prophet these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest To Whom The Mist Of Darkness is reserved forever Balaam did something really bad here Jude verse 10. says this but these Jude 10. these but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the era of Balaam for reward and perished in the gang saying gang sayings of Korra the Bible rarely speaks so strongly against an individual but it is speaking very strongly against this man Balaam what did he do was it because he did something that God told him not to do was it because he loved money the answer is in the Book of Revelation chapter 2. now listen to this here's what happened between these two chapters in numbers Revelation chapter 2 verse 14. but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught balak the king who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing I hate we see it over and over when the answer is no they keep trying to come back and get what they want they want money they want popularity they want respect they want a position when God's answer is no and it remains no but then God will allow it to happen people are going to get their way but as a Christian friends we need to surrender ourselves to God surrender our desires and say Lord I want to put you first and not make a excuse why I can have what I want if the word says don't do it then don't do it but we want our way so you know what Balaam did according to Revelation chapter 2 so Balaam goes his way as was as we saw in numbers and then he says well if God won't curse them I know a way to bring a curse upon them so he teaches them to start he teaches the young people to start sleeping around with these Moab people and start mixing and start and start having problems so they come in they start having these problems then they mess up their lives and then brings God's curses down upon them Balaam knew he was gonna get his way and he got it and he will go down in history as being one of the worst people that's written in the book because as gifted as he was because he wanted his way look at the difference between him and Samson Samson was given a gift and he used that gift for the Lord Balaam was given a gift and he used that for himself he used it for Satan Numbers chapter 25 verse 1. in Israel Abode and shoot him and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab there it is between the two chapters and they called the people into Sacrament under the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods and Israel joined himself to bail pior and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel so what does this have to do with us obviously the most obvious thing is be careful be careful who you yoke yourself up with but also be careful who you are following be careful who you are listening to because if you start if you if we followed Balaam Balaam would have brought us to destruction there was a prophet there Moses that said follow What God Says and then here's his Prophet Balaam that keeps coming back to God and saying as gifted as he was saying I want more I want this money I want to serve myself and yet he operated in that gift powerfully as powerfully as any Prophet almost in the Bible operating that because God those gifts and the callings they're irrevocable God didn't take them away he was born with those gifts listen to this listen to what brother Branham says here spiritual food in due season brother Branham says this he says we find that when a man comes sent from God ordained of God with the truth thus saith the Lord the messenger the message and the messenger are one and the same because he is sent to represent thus saith the Lord word by word so he and his message are the same a denominational man under denominational auspices he and the church is one a Theo Theologian under theology made by the same made some denomination he and his message are won Church of theology a theologian so what brother Branham is saying here is you can't separate a man from his message because that's always going to be influenced so if you if you look at me and you look at the way I preach if I'm living a filthy life behind this pulpit it's going to come out you can't separate me from my life you can't separate me from the message that I preach even as gifted as some people are and they may bring they may prophesy in God's name they may show discernment they may show Power like Balaam did they won't be as great as Balaam he was he was awesomely powerful but they may show that they may tell you what you're thinking they may they may uh give a prophecy over you and yet live a filthy life behind that you think that that's not going to come out in their Ministry it will we have to judge those things we have to be careful who we are listening to and who we are following no matter how gifted the man is there's a man that I used to listen to I was just a big fan of this guy on YouTube he was one of the best theologians that um I won't say his name because I don't want to I don't want to disrespect him um but uh he's dead now but one of the best theologians I've ever heard one of the most powerful men in answering questions he would have groups of thousands of people atheists or whatever and they would ask him questions and he would answer and right off the top of his head he had always had the scriptures and he was so kind and it just had such a gift one of the greatest gifts I have ever seen in a man in his command his handling of the scriptures was this man and I would I would watch him and I thought wow he is really really good gifted incredibly gifted and then find out not too long ago maybe a couple years ago maybe one year or two years ago that he was using his authority he was using his popularity to seduce young women and have relations with them behind the scenes as gifted as he was what an awful person but yet you watch him wow he was amazing in his ministry the reason I am saying that is to warn all of us be careful who you are listening to even though they may have a great gift in their lives watch their lives Watch What Happens and don't get caught up into that because that Ministry behind the scenes it will eventually come out right here you may never see it but it comes out you live a dirty life behind the scenes you're going to have a dirty message here in front of the pulpit no matter how gifted you are just like this man Balaam and how much problems he caused Israel Israel Israel hundreds of them died there's plagues that came down because they followed this man balaam's teaching as gifted as he was that's what I want to get across to the people today be careful always be careful who you are listening to judge all things I know everybody else says or you can't judge me well that's usually because you want to sin and and and you know you don't want anybody saying what that's that's that but let me tell you you judge this pulpit First Corinthians First Corinthians First Corinthians says a righteous man judges all things so judge you don't judge someone's salvation but but what is coming forth from the pulpit judge those things and the people that are bringing them be careful no matter how gifted a man or a woman might be careful because these examples are warnings that's why Balaam has mentioned so many times in the scriptures is a warning don't follow somebody like that and I hope that I the scriptures that I read show you how powerful and how gifted he was probably more gifted than anybody that you meet and yet still anointed by the enemy to lead Souls away if the musicians would come to close imagine this Gifted Man Balaam bringing these amazing messages that were that came from God and yet being anointed by the enemy yet wanting to serve himself gifts and callings are without repentance gifts and callings are irrevocable and for you each one of you if God gave you a gift maybe it's to sing maybe it's a musician maybe it's with business maybe whatever it is what are you using that gift for are you using it to serve God are you using to serve God's people are you using it to Serve Yourself that's a that's a bold question and I hope that everyone's thinking Lord Am I who am I like am I like this man Balaam that will take whatever gifts God has given me and I want to draw attention to myself I want to be something or I want to be a a rich or some successful person or some successful singer or whatever it is or Lord do I want to give my gift like Samson did do I want to give my gift to you I want to give my gift if I have any and all of us do I want to give it to God the best thing that I can do as a minister as a pastor the best thing that I can do is not to point you to what I say the best thing that I can do is to point you to Jesus Christ I can't lead anyone to Salvation neither can you but I can lead you to Christ and he can get you to Salvation that is everything that is the role of the ministry to get the people to the Lord Jesus Christ not to do to some gift not to some man not to some fleshly sinful person but to Christ who didn't sin it all the story of Jesus Jesus came to Earth as a man because God made flesh he came to Earth as a man so that God could save his people before it was a it was it was a sacrificing a lamb or whatever whatever kind of animal now he had to have something perfect that could take the sins of the world away so Jesus Christ comes down and he says I will take your sins upon myself I'll do it the one person that has never sinned he said I'll take the sins so he became sounds bad he became a thief for us because other people did it and their sins came on him he became someone that cheats on their husband or cheats on their wife Jesus lowered himself to that at the cross he never did it but he took on that sin for himself everything I have ever done brother Jeremy every sin I've ever committed I just dumped right on Jesus and he says I'll take it it's mine [Music] how dare me ever think that I'm worth anything or that I'm important or whatever whatever it might be the man that died on that cross is important not us everything goes back to him but there this world it wouldn't be in this book if it wasn't important and it wouldn't have made such a prominent part of the Bible the story of Balaam if we weren't to know it and we weren't to be aware and these apostles were Jesus speaking to John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos Peter recording the Deeds of Balaam telling us be careful watch these deceivers but if we can come to Christ God Made A Way for us to come to the Lord Jesus and I would I would encourage you if you there is something on your heart that wants to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Peter commanded he they said Lord they said how can we be saved they were touched in their heart by what the minister said Peter said repent go back from your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission the taking away of your sins that's it another place it says be baptized and wash your sins away not that going down in the water washes them away but the blood of Jesus Christ does and you make that commitment I serve you know we have one to be baptized am I right brother we have one is there anyone else that would like to be baptized if there are um brother if you can if you want to take take them back here brother Lyle if you could show show whoever needs to be baptized where to go I want to give a testimony as as the young Brothers

having trouble he couldn't get the people to enter in and to worship he was frustrated and there was a group of people that came in late and they were sitting where brother Aaron where you are right right here and I'll tell you what I was weeping on my way to church this morning telling my wife this story so he was here in this building there's a group of people over here brother Branham said he

here if there are no more souls to be one for Christ I want to pass on I don't care I don't want to be in this evil world but until that time comes I am going to witness I'm going to talk about the Lord Jesus I am going to try to get people as I said I can't I can't get someone to salvation but I can get them to Christ and he can get them there God bless you all I'm excited to baptize I'll see

end time I'm so glad that God is doing I see that a lot of people are coming to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm so glad of that thank God for that but my brothers and sisters um when we come to baptize we come to take a stand for Christ as Israel they were in Egypt they were not the Church of God until they come out of Egypt they were the people of God they are the promise of God but they were not the Church of God until they separated themselves from Egypt it's the same way we are by the grace of God justification the Lord Jesus Christ that died for all of us for all human beings every human beings who are living is a is a potential Sons and Daughters of God until they accept Jesus Christ that's the way of salvation they are in the world the lord died for them but when they come and accept him as a savior is the Lord calls us for his total separation from sin from all unbelief so it's great that we are baptized in his name but if we not take any sin we are not called his church so we are his church when we take a stand for Christ we separate ourselves from all our unbeliefs all the all the ungodly ways we have to that God called for a total separation from unbelief so it's great that we take a stand we accept the Lord what he done for us but what are we doing with our lives what kind of stand are we taking in this end time that's the question so this is my that's what the Lord has put on my heart and I was amazed that the body called me to pray because I said Lord if you put I will not be ashamed to testify of what you've put in my heart so brothers and sisters we need we need to stay up with ourselves from sin and we are not the Church of the Living God until we still take a step to step with ourselves from all unbelief we cannot be living the way we used to live that's why we come to the course we take the course before me the World Behind Me we have to take a total separation from unbelief that's my that is my exhortation to your church this morning let us stand to pray God we thank you for what you are doing in this end time you died for us oh Lord there's that you have given us Grace us human beings oh God especially Gentiles we're totally we're we are walking in darkness worshiping idols but by the cause dear God you have blinded Israel the Jews so that we can enter beware because before we were dogs we were not considered we didn't have any part of salvation but by the blood of Jesus Christ because they rejected you so that we can come in Heavenly Father help us not to take it lightly God help us not to to just take the blood and and say that we are named Christians but our lives is different or from being a Christian or God help us to take our course because you say take up your course and follow me oh it was to take our course the sacrifice oh as your Prophet I pray he says that we are among those who have oh stick come come out of the unbelieving world oh God help us to really come out Heavenly Father we thank you for Grace there's still there's there's three steps in Grace justification that is the remission of our sins would you have done it for all you don't have to do anything there's no works that can save us oh but what you have done for us on Calvary and also you have called for a Sanctified life dear God you cannot be using us you can we cannot be a a service to you until we are totally separated from sin oh God and we will be able to use us fill us with your Holy Ghost for service oh God that's why that's how desire Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for many who have come and baptized Heavenly Father help them to understand such a commitment such a stand they have taken is there so that they do not take it lightly oh god oh Lord Jesus when uh when uh when uh Moises went out to deliver your children in Israel by your commission oh God he did not put his house in order you were about to kill him dear God for that and you have revealed to the floor the wife that she was to take or circumcise the children which Moses didn't do oh God but this is what it is Heavenly Father we have to circumcise Our Lives circumcise our hearts oh separate ourselves from unbelief of God oh we thank you Heavenly Father for the church thank you for better than blessing Heavenly Father may you give him more we thank you that we are a part of this church dear God may you use us may you use
