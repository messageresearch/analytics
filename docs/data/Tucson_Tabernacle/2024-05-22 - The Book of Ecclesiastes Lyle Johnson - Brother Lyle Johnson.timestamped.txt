[27:41] we love
[27:44] him thank you so
[27:48] much first I must apologize for a
[27:51] misstatement from last week's lesson
[27:53] when talking about the topic of the
[27:55] Rapture I mentioned Paul writing to the
[27:57] Corinthians to correct a false teaching
[27:59] it was to the Thessalonians so often say
[28:03] don't take my word for anything trust
[28:06] but verify tonight our study or overview
[28:11] is of the Book of
[28:13] Ecclesiastes let's begin tonight's study
[28:16] with
[28:17] prayer Lord it's such a privilege to
[28:20] come to you once more Lord gathered with
[28:23] this blood-washed
[28:25] throng the people each of whom you paid
[28:28] so great a price and we're so grateful
[28:31] that we can count ourselves among that
[28:34] vast number Lord Jesus I pray that you
[28:38] would move by your spirit this evening I
[28:40] thank you for the spirit that's here I
[28:42] thank you for the worship and for the
[28:44] praise and for the heart and Lord I just
[28:47] pray now that you'd help us as your word
[28:50] comes forth Lord that that you'd Feed Us
[28:53] Lord that you'd give us what we need for
[28:55] each person that's here that you'd
[28:57] provide some special tidbit some special
[29:01] nugget some special thing Lord that they
[29:03] can say it was good to have been in the
[29:07] house of the Lord this evening Lord we
[29:09] thank you for your word we thank you for
[29:12] this
[29:14] responsibility and opportunity we commit
[29:16] now this evening to you in Jesus name
[29:22] amen well to to get a sense of the theme
[29:26] for Ecclesiastes let's open our Bibles
[29:29] and read our opening scriptures from
[29:32] uh second Peter chapter
[29:35] 3 you thought it was second
[29:40] Peter Peter writing says this Second
[29:43] Epistle beloved I now write unto you in
[29:46] both of the first letter and now also in
[29:49] the second one which I stir up your pure
[29:52] your unsullied your sincere Minds by way
[29:55] of remembrance I want to keep reminding
[29:59] you that you may be mindful of The Words
[30:02] which were spoken before by the holy
[30:05] Prophets The Old Testament and are the
[30:08] Commandment of us the Apostles of the
[30:10] Lord and Savior New Testament commands
[30:14] of Jesus Through the apostles knowing
[30:17] this first and let me give you heads up
[30:20] that there shall come in the last days
[30:22] Peter CED himself as being in that time
[30:26] scoffers those that will mocking us
[30:29] walking after their own lusts pursuing
[30:32] their own sinful desires and goals and
[30:36] saying where's the promise of his coming
[30:39] for since the fathers fell asleep things
[30:42] continue as they were from the beginning
[30:46] of the
[30:48] creation all things continue as they
[30:52] were from the beginning of the creation
[30:55] a verse from Luke where Jesus is
[30:57] speaking
[30:58] Luke
[30:59] 1726 he says and as it was in the days
[31:03] of Noah so shall it be also in the days
[31:08] of the son of
[31:09] man as it was the distant past so shall
[31:14] it be at some future
[31:18] time please be
[31:25] seated there is uncertainty
[31:29] if not controversy about when the Book
[31:31] of Ecclesiastes was accepted as part of
[31:34] the cannon of the Hebrew Bible uh there
[31:36] was apparently some debate about it as
[31:38] well as the Song of Solomon and couple
[31:40] of others about whether they should or
[31:42] should not be included there's lots of
[31:44] tradition about this I won't attempt to
[31:46] detail the arguments or the traditions
[31:48] because none of them can be proved what
[31:50] we do know is it by not later than the
[31:53] first century ad and likely much earlier
[31:57] it was part of the Hebrew scriptures the
[32:00] Tanakh Ecclesiastes is a short book it's
[32:03] only 12 chapters consists of 222 verses
[32:08] five or six pages in many bibles we
[32:11] could read it in its entirety tonight
[32:13] but we won't because the point is for
[32:16] you to read it read it at home meditate
[32:19] pray seek the Lord let him speak to you
[32:22] but we will summarize and read from it
[32:25] in
[32:26] Antiquity author ship of a book or
[32:29] scroll was sometimes presented as what
[32:31] is called a suit
[32:33] epigraph this means a book would claim
[32:35] to be author or written by some famous
[32:37] person often from the past in an effort
[32:40] to increase its acceptance books were
[32:42] very expensive reading skills were
[32:44] limited so it wasn't as if the publisher
[32:46] was trying to promote something to sell
[32:48] a million
[32:49] copies there are many examples of this
[32:52] there are plenty of works from very
[32:55] early Christianity that claim to be
[32:56] authored by famous people people like
[32:58] the Gospel of Thomas The Book of Enoch
[33:02] or even The Apocalypse of
[33:05] Adam others are what we call
[33:08] pseudonymous meaning that the author is
[33:11] not named not mentioned not claimed much
[33:13] of our new testament is this way as as
[33:15] much of the Old Testament for example
[33:17] who wrote judges or Ruth or Kings or
[33:23] Hebrews but regardless of who wrote them
[33:28] or who we think or or believe wrote them
[33:31] they
[33:32] are in the
[33:34] Bible so with that as a brief background
[33:37] let's see what the book says about its
[33:42] author Ecclesiastes 1:1 the words of the
[33:46] preacher the son of David King in
[33:50] Jerusalem and and in verse 12 he says I
[33:53] the preacher was King over Israel in
[33:56] Jerusalem
[33:59] well if these claims are true that the
[34:00] author is a descendant of David and he
[34:02] ruled over Israel from Jerusalem there's
[34:05] only one individual that fits that
[34:07] description and that is Solomon later
[34:09] descendants of David ruled over Judah
[34:12] from Jerusalem but never over Israel
[34:15] from
[34:17] Jerusalem what is the role associated
[34:20] with the title of
[34:22] preacher the Hebrew word is calet you
[34:26] knew that Josiah the Hebrew word is
[34:29] calet and it's the title of the book in
[34:31] the Hebrew Bible this word occurs only
[34:34] seven times in the Old Testament and and
[34:37] all seven all seven occurrences of this
[34:40] word calet or preacher are in this
[34:44] book the Hebrew word translated preacher
[34:47] means one who assembles or gathers a
[34:49] community or congregation a lecturer a
[34:53] preacher various modern dictionaries of
[34:56] English Define preacher to include one
[34:59] who gives a religious speech one who
[35:01] publicly proclaims the gospel perhaps
[35:04] for an occupation one who discourses
[35:07] publicly on religious
[35:09] subjects so Ecclesiastes is an address
[35:13] to gathering in this case the
[35:16] congregation or the community of
[35:19] Israel why was it
[35:22] written what is its theme or its topic
[35:29] vanity of vanities sayth the preacher
[35:33] vanity of
[35:35] vanities all is
[35:40] Vanity well what does vanity mean the
[35:44] word translated as vanity means
[35:47] Vapor
[35:49] futility
[35:51] meaningless
[35:53] pointless
[35:55] pointless futile says a preacher utterly
[35:59] meaningless nothing matters it's all
[36:04] Vapor everything is
[36:06] meaningless
[36:08] futile pointless what is everything all
[36:14] such a cheerful encouraging
[36:16] theme certainly a way to get our
[36:19] attention and you can wonder why people
[36:21] had a little bit of a struggle putting
[36:24] this in the collection of scriptures
[36:28] what profit hath a man of all his labor
[36:31] which he taketh Under the
[36:33] Sun what does Under the Sun mean
[36:36] basically means on Earth not
[36:39] geographically specific like Israel or
[36:41] Egypt or the Americas the imagery is
[36:44] toiling labor work under a hot summer
[36:48] sun most people in this era worked in
[36:52] agriculture subsistence farming very low
[36:55] yields you plant t and get 10 or 20 it
[37:00] just wasn't very productive God told
[37:04] Adam he'd live by the sweat of his brow
[37:07] in fact Ecclesiastes could be taken as a
[37:10] sermon expounding Genesis
[37:13] 3:19 and the sweat of thy face Thou
[37:16] shalt eat bread till thou return unto
[37:18] the ground for out of it was thou taken
[37:22] for dust Thou Art and unto dust shalt
[37:25] thou return
[37:29] back to Ecclesiastes continuing on one
[37:32] generation passes away and another
[37:34] generation comes but the Earth abides
[37:38] forever dust Thou Art andto dust shalt
[37:42] thou return The Sun Also Rises and The
[37:46] Sun Goes Down And hasten us to his place
[37:50] where he
[37:52] arose an endless
[37:55] cycle the wind goeth toward the South
[37:59] turneth about unto the north it whirle
[38:01] about continually and the wind returns
[38:04] again according to his
[38:07] circuits all the rivers run into the sea
[38:10] yet the sea is not full un the place
[38:13] once the rivers come thither they go
[38:15] again even nature is thwarted in its
[38:18] continual labors of trying to fill the
[38:20] ocean the sea is not satisfied at once
[38:23] ever more round and round it goes
[38:28] All Things Are full of Labor man cannot
[38:32] utter it that means everything is
[38:34] wearisome beyond description the eye is
[38:37] not satisfied with seeing it continues
[38:40] looking the ear nor the ear filled with
[38:44] hearing it it continues listening it's
[38:46] never
[38:47] satisfied the thing that hath been it is
[38:50] that which shall be and that which is
[38:53] done now is that which shall be done
[38:57] there's no new thing under the
[39:01] sun is there anything whereof it may be
[39:04] said see this is new it's been already
[39:07] of old time which was before us there is
[39:10] no remembrance of former things neither
[39:13] shall there be any remembrance of things
[39:15] that are to come with those that shall
[39:17] come
[39:20] after we forgotten the past we'll be
[39:24] forgotten after we die that these 11
[39:26] verses set the theme of the book A
[39:29] continual search for a change in the
[39:32] pattern of Life a weary unending round
[39:35] of work and
[39:37] toil only to end in the
[39:40] grave we really don't know our past and
[39:43] we'll become the Forgotten past to those
[39:45] who live in the future I remember a few
[39:47] years ago digging into some ancestry
[39:49] website records and taking a DNA test
[39:53] and so forth the result is I have the
[39:55] names of a few ancestors going back
[39:58] perhaps 250 to 300 years even at that
[40:02] level it's very incomplete and aart from
[40:05] their names I know nothing about them
[40:07] except when they were
[40:11] born maybe when they died perhaps where
[40:14] they may have lived what did they do
[40:17] were they happy or sad what was their
[40:21] life like in the place and times in
[40:22] which they lived did they fight in
[40:25] wars did they know know
[40:29] peace did they know the
[40:31] Lord I basically know nothing about my
[40:35] ancestors Beyond a generation or two and
[40:38] my descendants in a very few Generations
[40:41] will know nothing about me where I lived
[40:46] what I did who I loved how I behaved
[40:51] what I said who I helped who I hurt who
[40:55] I worshiped
[40:58] I recall when I was a vice president at
[41:00] modular mining systems here in Tucson a
[41:02] company I helped start occasionally
[41:05] going to my team of engineers in the
[41:07] early evening and telling them to go
[41:09] home many of them were working overtime
[41:12] and as salary people they didn't collect
[41:14] extra pay for that I was called on to
[41:17] the carpet about that by my partners and
[41:19] I explained to them that is important as
[41:21] the work was that we were doing and it
[41:24] was important we literally changed the
[41:26] face of the mining industry worldwide
[41:28] over a period of about 20 years that
[41:31] these people had families and they
[41:33] worked to support their families the
[41:36] families were more important than some
[41:38] arbitrary
[41:39] schedule none of my partners had
[41:41] children for them the company was their
[41:43] family and their
[41:46] life I would sometimes point out to my
[41:48] staff that they should keep in mind to
[41:51] not forget that The Cutting Edge
[41:53] Products that we were
[41:55] developing would be an amus Museum or a
[41:58] landfill in 20 or 30 years do a good job
[42:02] make a great product but don't make it
[42:05] the focus of your life keep a balanced
[42:08] approach to
[42:10] life we've covered the initial topic or
[42:12] heading of the book The assertion that
[42:15] all is
[42:16] futile like a vapor nothing is permanent
[42:20] nothing really changes or improves all
[42:24] our labor is in vain in the end we are
[42:28] where we started
[42:39] dust don't drop any
[42:48] hints like a rodent in a
[42:51] wheel running
[42:53] hard getting nowhere
[43:00] we really are getting nowhere aren't you
[43:02] little
[43:04] buddy there we go at least you think
[43:07] you're making
[43:09] progress the Apostle James
[43:12] wrote James 4:14 whereas you know not
[43:16] what shall be on the tomorrow for what
[43:20] is your
[43:21] life it is even a vapor it appear for a
[43:24] little time then vanishes
[43:28] away see you you you be still you be
[43:32] still you're disturbing things thank
[43:38] you it seems similar to what the
[43:40] preacher was saying other scriptures
[43:42] talk about the flower of grass that
[43:44] blooms and Withers but don't be
[43:46] discouraged stick around we'll see
[43:49] what's really being
[43:52] said I've collected a set of headings
[43:56] for the book of ecclesiast ases the
[43:58] first verses make the assertion that all
[44:02] is Vanity our efforts are pointless here
[44:06] today gone tomorrow that's what we just
[44:11] read the rest of chapter one and all of
[44:14] chapter 2 describe the futility of
[44:17] wisdom
[44:19] self-indulgence wise living and toil
[44:23] some examples the vanity of wisdom
[44:25] Ecclesiastes 1 16
[44:28] I communed with my own heart saying lo I
[44:32] am come to Great Estate have gotten more
[44:35] wisdom than all they that have been
[44:36] before me in Jerusalem y my heart had
[44:40] great experience of wisdom and knowledge
[44:43] I'm the smartest guy in the
[44:46] world the smartest guy that ever
[44:50] was I gave my heart to know wisdom and
[44:55] to know Madness and folly
[44:57] I perceived that this also is vexation
[45:00] of spirit it's just troubling unsettling
[45:05] for in much
[45:07] wisdom is much grief he that increases
[45:11] knowledge increases
[45:14] sorrow nothing made me happy the smarter
[45:18] I got the more depressed I
[45:21] became on the uselessness of
[45:24] self-indulgence Solomon brags on his
[45:27] riches his Vineyards his Landscaping the
[45:30] singers
[45:31] music Ecclesiastes do not so I was great
[45:36] and increased more than all that were
[45:38] before me in Jerusalem also my wisdom
[45:42] remained with me I was rich as well as
[45:45] smart and whatsoever mine eyes desired I
[45:49] kept not from them I withheld not my
[45:52] heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced
[45:54] in all my labor and this was my portion
[45:58] of all my labor in other words I did
[46:01] whatever I wanted to do nothing stopped
[46:06] me then I looked on all the works that
[46:09] my hands had wrought on the labor that I
[46:12] had labored to
[46:14] do and
[46:16] behold all was vanity vexation of spirit
[46:20] there was no profit Under the Sun it was
[46:23] all a temporary pleasure
[46:27] on living wisely Ecclesiastes 2:15 then
[46:32] said I in my heart as it happeneth to
[46:35] the fool so it happeneth even to
[46:39] me why was I then more wise then I said
[46:44] in my heart that this also is
[46:49] Vanity there's no remebrance of the wise
[46:52] more than of the fool forever seeing
[46:55] that that which now is in the days to
[46:58] come shall all be
[47:01] forgotten and how dieth the wise man as
[47:05] the
[47:05] fool dust to
[47:08] dust therefore I hated life because the
[47:12] work that is wrough under the sun here
[47:14] on Earth is Grievous unto
[47:17] me all is Vanity vexation of
[47:22] spirit regarding
[47:24] work y I hated all my labor which I had
[47:27] taken Under the Sun why because I should
[47:31] leave it unto the man that shall be
[47:34] after me who knoweth whether he shall be
[47:36] a wise man or a fool yet shall he have
[47:40] rule over all my labor wherein I have
[47:44] labored minus the part the IRS takes and
[47:48] wherein I have showed myself wise Under
[47:51] the
[47:52] Sun this is also
[47:55] vanity think Rayo po First Kings 12
[47:59] followed foolish advice greed
[48:01] self-indulgence and destroyed the
[48:06] kingdom therefore I went about to cause
[48:09] my heart to despair of all the labor
[48:11] which I took Under the Sun in other
[48:14] words I sank further into
[48:19] depression the next section the
[48:22] beginning of chapter 3 is sometimes
[48:24] called the weary round of life
[48:27] for me personally it is one of the most
[48:29] memorable portions of the
[48:32] book
[48:33] why sometimes there's a Confluence of
[48:36] events that cause me to shake my head in
[48:38] Wonder and realize the hand of God must
[48:41] have been at
[48:44] work for everyone I don't know for me
[48:48] definitely for many others highly
[48:52] likely in October
[48:55] 1965 of FK rock group released a song
[48:58] called turn turn turn by December
[49:02] 4
[49:04] 1965 it had reached number one of the
[49:08] top 100 hit songs that's the same date
[49:12] on which brother Brandon recorded the
[49:14] Rapture started the week of his final
[49:17] sermons things that are to be monored
[49:19] events made clear by prophecy leadership
[49:22] communion if you were a follower of his
[49:25] teachings I I wasn't at that time I'd
[49:27] never heard of William brandom and tuned
[49:29] into a radio station playing popular
[49:32] music during the week brother Brandon
[49:35] was hospitalized in Amarillo Texas until
[49:37] his death at Christmas Eve you would
[49:39] have heard this
[49:41] song the majority of the youth in
[49:44] America heard the song at that very time
[49:46] along with their parents and siblings I
[49:48] expect please turn in your Bibles to
[49:52] Ecclesiastes chapter
[49:54] 3 we'll read the lyrics of this number
[49:59] one
[50:04] song to everything there's a season a
[50:08] time to every purpose under the heaven a
[50:12] time to be born a time to die a time to
[50:16] plant a time to
[50:18] reap A Time to Kill a time to heal a
[50:22] time to break down and a time to build
[50:24] up a time to weep and a time to laugh
[50:28] time to
[50:29] mourn and a time to
[50:32] dance a time to Cast Away stones and a
[50:34] time to gather Stones together a time to
[50:39] embrace time to refrain from embracing a
[50:42] time to get a time to lose a time to
[50:46] keep and a time to Cast Away a time to
[50:50] Rend and a time to
[50:53] swow a time to keep silence
[50:56] time to
[50:57] speak a time to love a time of hate a
[51:01] time of
[51:02] War a time of
[51:05] Peace the lyrics of the most played song
[51:08] of December 1965 are the King James
[51:12] version words of Ecclesiastes 3 1-8 in
[51:17] 1965 there was no internet no cable TV
[51:20] no cell phones you got your news and
[51:22] discover new music through the radio
[51:25] driving in your car you turned on the
[51:28] radio how often are the airwaves or
[51:31] information sources blanketed with
[51:34] scripture and with words that are so
[51:36] time
[51:37] appropriate God signaling a time of
[51:40] change and announcing it to the entire
[51:43] English-speaking world and
[51:45] Beyond by the way I'm not suggesting you
[51:47] listen to the song my point in
[51:49] mentioning it is to emphasize the timing
[51:53] how God can use anything he wants
[51:57] to serve his
[51:58] purposes to everything there's a
[52:03] season a time to every purpose under the
[52:11] heaven in the next short section Solomon
[52:14] starts to broaden his Horizon from the
[52:16] endless and futile cycle of life to a
[52:21] recognition of God's Eternal nature
[52:27] what profit hath he that worketh and
[52:29] that wherein he labor Earth I've seen
[52:31] their travail the task the burden which
[52:34] God ha given to the sons of men to be
[52:36] exercised in it to keep us occupied keep
[52:39] us
[52:40] busy Heath made everything beautiful in
[52:43] his time also he hath set the world in
[52:46] their heart so that no man can find out
[52:49] the work that God maketh from the
[52:51] beginning to the
[52:53] end you got
[52:55] that verse might be a little clearer in
[52:57] another translation here it is from the
[52:59] complete Jewish Bible he has made
[53:01] everything suited to its time also he
[53:05] has given human beings an awareness of
[53:08] Eternity but in such a way that they
[53:11] can't fully comprehend from beginning to
[53:13] end the things God does I know there is
[53:17] no good in them there's nothing better
[53:20] for people but for a man to Rejoice be
[53:23] happy and to do good in his life also
[53:26] that every man should eat and drink and
[53:28] enjoy the good of all his labor it's the
[53:31] gift of
[53:32] God I I know that whatsoever God doeth
[53:36] it shall be forever in contrast with the
[53:40] transient nature of man's efforts
[53:42] nothing can be added to it nor anything
[53:44] taken from it and God doeth it why that
[53:49] men should fear before
[53:52] him that which hath been is now and that
[53:56] which is to be hath already been and God
[54:01] requireth that which is passed we sum
[54:03] that up and say history repeats
[54:08] itself more
[54:10] headings dust to dust man and beast
[54:14] alive the righteous and the wicked Evil
[54:18] Under the Sun chapter 4 includes a small
[54:22] set of proverbs
[54:28] better is a handful with quietness than
[54:33] both hands full accompanied with travail
[54:37] and vexation of
[54:40] spirit if one Prevail against him you
[54:42] shall withstand him and a three-fold
[54:44] chord is not quickly broken in unity we
[54:48] have
[54:49] strength Unity don't stand alone Unity
[54:54] Reach Out
[54:58] chapters five and six are again a short
[55:01] collection of short admonishments and
[55:03] observations and the form of
[55:07] Proverbs Ecclesiastes 51 keep thy foot
[55:11] guard your steps when thou goest to the
[55:13] house of God and be more ready to hear
[55:16] go to listen rather than to give the
[55:17] sacrifice of fools for they consider not
[55:20] that they do
[55:22] evil for and the multitude of dreams and
[55:25] many words are also also diverse
[55:27] vanities but
[55:28] instead fear the
[55:31] lord here we see the perspective of the
[55:33] preacher changing a bit he's included
[55:35] the fear of God not just the works and
[55:39] his observations in the context of our
[55:41] mortal
[55:43] life he goes on about other things and
[55:46] in verse 10 he says he that loveth
[55:49] silver shall not be satisfied with
[55:51] silver he that loveth abundance won't be
[55:54] satisfied with increase
[55:57] this is also vanity it's futile whatever
[56:01] your appetite it will never be
[56:04] satisfied it's never
[56:07] enough Ecclesiastes 612 for who knoweth
[56:12] what is good for a man in this life all
[56:14] the days of his vain pointless life
[56:18] which he
[56:26] after him under the
[56:29] sun the preacher again is frustrated by
[56:33] the fact of
[56:34] mortality and the uncertainty of the
[56:37] future of his
[56:42] efforts chapter 7 continues Solomon's
[56:46] proverb likee statements this time
[56:47] contrasting wisdom and
[56:50] Folly when you're reading
[56:52] these keep in mind the preacher is only
[56:56] only seeing futility in everything we do
[56:59] his measure of this is that when we die
[57:02] we take nothing with us and have no
[57:04] control over those who inherit what we
[57:07] leave
[57:08] behind this is a worldview that I
[57:10] suspect the Sadducees embraced they saw
[57:14] death as the end of our existence there
[57:16] was nothing Beyond like job's friends
[57:19] their perspective was that if you please
[57:21] God you'll be protected life will be
[57:23] good the gospel of prosperity
[57:27] if you don't do all of God's
[57:28] Commandments your short life will be
[57:31] full of misery and pain job surely
[57:35] you're a secret
[57:37] sinner the same line of reasoning if
[57:40] you're suffering it has to be punishment
[57:42] from
[57:46] God verse 14 of chapter 7 in the day of
[57:49] prosperity be joyful but in the day of
[57:53] adversity consider God also set one
[57:57] alongside the other to the end that man
[58:00] should find nothing after him in other
[58:02] words you can't discover what the future
[58:06] holds all things have I seen in the days
[58:09] of my vanity there's a just man that
[58:13] perishes in his righteousness and
[58:16] there's a wicked man that prolong us
[58:18] life in his
[58:22] righteousness it all seems so random and
[58:24] unfair but it's from the perspective
[58:26] persective of a short
[58:28] life might there be another Factor at
[58:32] play was God just being
[58:38] capricious more headings chapter 8
[58:41] begins with the description of the power
[58:43] of a dictator using the example as a
[58:46] king this guy was a king he was a
[58:49] dictator so if you happen to be in a
[58:52] place that's run by dictators pay
[58:55] attention to that chapter it might help
[58:57] you the preacher then begins to
[59:00] speak of the fear of
[59:03] God Ecclesiastes 811 because sentence
[59:07] against an evil work is not executed
[59:10] speedily therefore the heart of the sons
[59:13] of men is fully set in them to do evil
[59:18] keep getting away with stuff
[59:22] right though a sinner do evil a hundred
[59:25] times and his days be prolonged yet
[59:28] surely I know that it shall be well with
[59:31] them that fear God which fear before him
[59:34] openly reverence show respect to
[59:38] him but it shall not be well with the
[59:40] wicked neither shall he prolong his days
[59:43] which are as a shadow because he feareth
[59:46] not before
[59:48] God think of the Judgment parable of
[59:51] Jesus in Matthew chapter 25 Solomon is
[59:55] admitting
[59:56] that there's something Beyond this life
[1:00:00] maybe It Isn't So
[1:00:03] pointless goes on and talks about how
[1:00:05] God's ways are unknowable that I beheld
[1:00:08] all the work of God that a man cannot
[1:00:10] find out the work that is done under the
[1:00:12] sun because though a man labor to seek
[1:00:14] it out he won't find it though A wise
[1:00:19] man think to know it yet shall he not be
[1:00:22] able to find it even the preacher was
[1:00:25] unable
[1:00:26] to understand
[1:00:29] it chapters 9 and 10 deal with these
[1:00:33] topics the universality of death
[1:00:37] spending quality time with your
[1:00:41] mate and then a lengthy section on why
[1:00:44] wisdom is better than Folly even though
[1:00:48] it is all
[1:00:50] futile some of these Proverbs perhaps
[1:00:52] many have cultural context it's not
[1:00:55] always clear to us and our time and
[1:00:58] place a simple example Ecclesiastes
[1:01:02] 10:2 a wise man's heart is at his right
[1:01:05] hand but a Fool's heart is at his
[1:01:11] left
[1:01:12] huh in The Sermon on the Mount Jesus
[1:01:15] shocked his audience when he said I say
[1:01:17] unto you that you resist not evil but
[1:01:21] whosoever shall smite thee on the right
[1:01:23] cheek indicating he struck you with his
[1:01:26] left hand turn to him the other
[1:01:31] also there's this association with the
[1:01:34] right and the left equating evil with
[1:01:38] being hit on the right
[1:01:42] cheek I wondered about
[1:01:45] this in 2000 I traveled to Saudi Arabia
[1:01:48] to participate in a Space Project the
[1:01:51] culture they tracing back to ancient
[1:01:53] times in the Middle East is that you
[1:01:55] never ever eat or even touch food or
[1:02:00] almost anything else with your left hand
[1:02:02] putting it plainly you eat with your
[1:02:04] right hand you clean yourself with your
[1:02:07] left so the person hitting you on the
[1:02:09] right cheek with his left hand is
[1:02:12] insulting you in a very degrading way
[1:02:16] Jesus audience understood this symbology
[1:02:19] of the right and left the preacher
[1:02:21] audience and Ecclesiastes 10 to also
[1:02:25] understood
[1:02:26] my point is that some of these sayings
[1:02:28] are a bit pers per Excuse Me Maybe I
[1:02:31] need a
[1:02:36] drink yes eat drink and be satisfied yes
[1:02:40] some of these saying are a bit
[1:02:41] perplexing and we sometimes need to dig
[1:02:44] into the history and culture of the day
[1:02:47] the context to make sense of
[1:02:50] them moving on oh there was that I
[1:02:54] forgot to advance it
[1:02:56] chapter
[1:02:58] 11 starts with this rather strange
[1:03:02] thing cast thy bread upon the waters for
[1:03:06] Thou shalt find it after many days give
[1:03:11] a portion to seven and also to eight for
[1:03:13] thou knowest not what evil shall be upon
[1:03:16] the
[1:03:18] Earth
[1:03:20] huh as a kid I thought this was weird I
[1:03:24] I remembered when I was about four years
[1:03:26] old or so sitting in the backyard where
[1:03:27] we had a little waiting pool that was
[1:03:29] probably about as big as this Pulpit
[1:03:31] maybe that
[1:03:32] deep and I was sitting out there with a
[1:03:34] peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I
[1:03:35] dropped it into the waiting
[1:03:38] pool it just got soggy and it tasted
[1:03:42] really yucky
[1:03:45] afterward and then I thought well maybe
[1:03:48] bread in those days floated an axe had
[1:03:51] floated when the prophet threw some salt
[1:03:53] or something in the water so maybe
[1:03:56] maybe the tide would bring it
[1:03:58] back it's speaking of Investments if you
[1:04:02] ship your G your grain out for Commerce
[1:04:04] you may eventually get a return from it
[1:04:07] and giving a portion to seven or eight
[1:04:09] meant don't put all your eggs in one
[1:04:10] basket spread it out reduce the risk the
[1:04:14] evil that shall be upon the
[1:04:17] Earth brother brandom mentioned
[1:04:20] Ecclesiastes 111 many times sometimes in
[1:04:24] prayer sometimes s in the body of a
[1:04:26] sermon and it was often if not always in
[1:04:29] the context of the spiritual equivalent
[1:04:33] of
[1:04:34] investing in the context of you reap
[1:04:38] what you
[1:04:39] sow showing kindness to others I'll
[1:04:42] share one short paragraph part of a
[1:04:44] prayer from influence October
[1:04:50] 1962 may we mean this in our heart as we
[1:04:53] speak it Lord take a coal of fire of the
[1:04:57] Holy Ghost off the altar of Calvary
[1:05:00] touch each heart and lip tonight Lord
[1:05:02] that we speak no lies that we speak the
[1:05:06] truth take us tonight Lord just what we
[1:05:11] are all of us are not preachers all of
[1:05:14] us are not prophets all of us are not
[1:05:15] speakers with tongues all of us are not
[1:05:18] miracle workers but all of us have
[1:05:21] something to do show us where it is Lord
[1:05:25] Lord testify sing pray and like bread
[1:05:31] upon the Water it will return some
[1:05:35] Glorious
[1:05:36] Day Grant it Lord here we are send us to
[1:05:39] our neighbors to wherever we can to our
[1:05:42] fellow man tell them the coming of the
[1:05:44] Lord granted
[1:05:48] father the preacher starts to show us
[1:05:51] the reason that we should be wise and
[1:05:53] not foolish industrious
[1:05:56] not lazy Rejoice oh young man in thy
[1:06:00] Youth and let thy heart cheer thee in
[1:06:01] the days of thy Youth and walk in the
[1:06:04] ways of thine heart and and the sight of
[1:06:06] thine eyes but know thou that for all
[1:06:08] these things God will bring thee into
[1:06:13] judgment therefore remove sorrow from
[1:06:15] thy heart put away evil from thy flesh
[1:06:18] for childhood and youth or
[1:06:22] vanity Sadducees take note the preacher
[1:06:25] is speaking of judgment accountability
[1:06:27] for our actions is this during our life
[1:06:31] the days of our
[1:06:37] mortality the last headings the closing
[1:06:41] verses of the words of the
[1:06:43] preacher summarizes the
[1:06:46] book Ecclesiastes 12
[1:06:51] 7 then shall the dust return to the
[1:06:54] Earth as it was was he's speaking of
[1:06:57] death and the spirit shall return unto
[1:07:01] God who gave
[1:07:03] it ah
[1:07:05] Sadducees did you hear that after the
[1:07:08] body dies the spirit returns to
[1:07:13] God vanity of
[1:07:16] vanities all is
[1:07:18] Vanity we turn to
[1:07:20] dust pointless
[1:07:27] moreover because the preacher was wise
[1:07:30] he still taught the people knowledge yay
[1:07:33] he gave good heed and sought out and set
[1:07:35] in order many Proverbs as we read last
[1:07:38] week some
[1:07:41] 5,000 again telling us this is Solomon
[1:07:45] the preacher sought to find out
[1:07:47] acceptable words and that which was
[1:07:49] written was upright even words of truth
[1:07:53] skipping down to verse 13 the last two
[1:07:55] verses of this
[1:07:57] book let us hear the conclusion of the
[1:08:00] whole matter fear God keep his
[1:08:05] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[1:08:08] of man this applies to every
[1:08:12] person why for God shall bring every
[1:08:16] work into judgment with every secret
[1:08:19] thing whether it be
[1:08:22] good or whether it be evil
[1:08:30] there's so much in this book but a
[1:08:33] couple of things seem to underly all it
[1:08:36] says for one the preacher was at the
[1:08:41] center of his
[1:08:42] Universe I was the wisest person ever I
[1:08:46] was the richest person in Jerusalem I
[1:08:50] did whatever I wanted I built I planted
[1:08:54] I bought I I so I gave myself over to
[1:08:57] Hedonism seeking whatever fleshly
[1:08:58] pleasure I could
[1:09:01] imagine and the words of Frank Sinatra I
[1:09:05] did it my way I I I I I all is
[1:09:14] Vanity a world view centered on
[1:09:18] oneself if that's your perspective your
[1:09:21] foundation then no matter what you do
[1:09:23] what you obtain or attain it will never
[1:09:27] be enough your addictions will never be
[1:09:31] satisfied or ultimately
[1:09:35] satisfying what was the primary concern
[1:09:38] of the preacher why did he view
[1:09:40] everything as vanity Vapor meaningless
[1:09:43] futile it was in part because he
[1:09:46] couldn't control or even know his legacy
[1:09:50] he would die like everyone else and like
[1:09:54] everyone else he would be
[1:09:56] forgotten well he can say Solomon wasn't
[1:09:59] forgotten but but it's not really the
[1:10:00] point of the one or two names that come
[1:10:02] down through
[1:10:04] history what were the names of his
[1:10:07] wives his
[1:10:09] concubines can you name even
[1:10:12] one or his sons apart from
[1:10:15] rehoboam what happened to his Palace his
[1:10:19] Temple his
[1:10:21] kingdom his wealth his Pursuits became
[1:10:24] so disgusted and offensive that God
[1:10:26] called him on the carpet First Kings 11
[1:10:28] we read King Solomon loved many strange
[1:10:31] women together with the daughter of
[1:10:34] pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites
[1:10:37] zidonians and Hittites of the
[1:10:40] Nations concerning which the Lord said
[1:10:42] to the children of Israel you shall not
[1:10:45] go to them neither shall they come in
[1:10:47] unto you for surely they will turn your
[1:10:49] heart after other gods Solomon clave
[1:10:53] unto these in love he had 700 wives
[1:10:57] princesses and 300
[1:11:00] concubines and his wives turned away his
[1:11:05] heart for it came to pass when Solomon
[1:11:07] was old that his wives turned away his
[1:11:09] heart after other gods and his heart was
[1:11:11] not perfect with the Lord his God as was
[1:11:13] the heart of David his father for
[1:11:16] Solomon not just his wives Solomon
[1:11:21] himself went after asht Toth the goddess
[1:11:24] of the zidonians
[1:11:25] and after milcom the abomination of the
[1:11:28] ammonites Solomon did evil in the sight
[1:11:31] of the Lord went not fully after the
[1:11:33] Lord as is David his
[1:11:35] father Solomon is worried in
[1:11:37] Ecclesiastes if his son will be wise or
[1:11:39] a fool seeming to forget that he was the
[1:11:42] son of his
[1:11:44] father and look what
[1:11:48] happened verse n the Lord was angry with
[1:11:51] Solomon because his heart was turned
[1:11:53] from the Lord God of Israel which had
[1:11:55] appeared unto him twice and had
[1:11:58] commanded him concerning this thing that
[1:12:01] he should not go after other gods but he
[1:12:03] kept not that which the Lord
[1:12:06] commanded wherefore the Lord said unto
[1:12:09] Solomon for as much as this is done of
[1:12:12] thee and thou Hast not kept my Covenant
[1:12:14] and my statutes which I have commanded
[1:12:16] Thee I will surely run the Kingdom from
[1:12:18] thee and will give it to thy servant
[1:12:20] notwithstanding in thy days I will not
[1:12:22] do it for David thy father's sake but I
[1:12:25] will rent it out of the hand of thy
[1:12:29] son well it's it's easy to judge Solomon
[1:12:33] one of the beauties of the Bible is that
[1:12:35] it talks about our weaknesses as well as
[1:12:37] our strengths it's not a it's not a a
[1:12:39] Marvel comic book of
[1:12:41] superheroes it's people like you people
[1:12:45] like me I see some of these things in
[1:12:48] some of these people and I think what
[1:12:50] got into them and then I look in the
[1:12:53] mirror and then I say I know what God
[1:12:56] did to them yeah if the musicians would
[1:12:59] please come at this time we need to be
[1:13:02] careful seek the Lord serve him Solomon
[1:13:06] was an imperfect human same as
[1:13:10] me same as each of
[1:13:15] us what is another world viw not of
[1:13:18] self-centeredness and self-indulgence
[1:13:20] not depending on wisdom or knowledge or
[1:13:23] gain the one that the preacher concluded
[1:13:25] let us hear the conclusion of the whole
[1:13:27] matter fear God and keep his
[1:13:29] Commandments it's the whole duty of man
[1:13:32] God shall bring every work into judgment
[1:13:34] with every secret thing whether it be
[1:13:36] good or whether it be
[1:13:38] evil Paul expressed it this way it'll be
[1:13:42] our closing set of verses and conclude
[1:13:43] our thoughts tonight on Ecclesiastes we
[1:13:45] started in the New Testament we should
[1:13:48] end in the New Testament right
[1:13:49] Colossians
[1:13:51] 3 whatsoever you do do it hard
[1:13:56] as to the Lord not unto men knowing that
[1:14:00] of the Lord ye shall receive the reward
[1:14:02] of the inheritance for ye serve the Lord
[1:14:06] Christ but he that doeth wrong shall
[1:14:10] receive for the wrong which he hath done
[1:14:12] there's no respect of
[1:14:14] persons whatever you do do it heartily
[1:14:19] as to the Lord and not unto
[1:14:23] man let's sing a song from Solomon's dad
[1:14:27] David as we turn the service over to
[1:14:29] brother Aaron
[1:14:31] and brother Daniel create in me a clean
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:42] heart a clean
[1:14:49] heart
[1:14:53] God and renew a right
[1:14:57] Spirit
[1:14:58] Within
[1:15:04] Me cre
[1:15:07] me a clean
[1:15:13] heart
[1:15:14] oh
[1:15:18] God and renew a right
[1:15:22] Spirit Within
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:31] has me not
[1:15:35] away from thy
[1:15:39] presence oh
[1:15:42] Lord take not thy Holy Spirit for me
[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:15:56] restore onto
[1:16:00] me the joy of my
[1:16:08] salvation and
[1:16:10] we
[1:16:12] Spirit within
[1:16:16] me one more
[1:16:19] time create in me a
[1:16:29] oh
[1:16:33] God and renew a right
[1:16:37] Spirit Within
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:46] Me me a clean
[1:16:52] heart oh God
[1:16:54] [Applause]
[1:16:58] and renew right
[1:17:01] Spirit Within
[1:17:08] Me cast me not
[1:17:13] away from thy
[1:17:17] presence oh
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:21] Lord take God the Holy Spirit
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:28] [Applause]
[1:17:32] are
[1:17:35] restore to
[1:17:38] me
[1:17:40] the of thy
[1:17:45] salvation and reew a right
[1:17:49] Spirit Within
[1:17:53] Me amen
[1:17:56] I
[1:17:58] believe that when a minister truly
[1:18:01] captures the spirit behind the original
[1:18:06] message that's written in the
[1:18:09] Bible that the brother
[1:18:12] ministering will be
[1:18:16] ministering in the
[1:18:18] same mood and in same
[1:18:23] atmosphere as the author when he wrote
[1:18:27] it as I say I say it many times I ask
[1:18:30] the Lord to
[1:18:32] let the Holy Spirit come down and may we
[1:18:38] receive the word in the same spirit that
[1:18:41] it was written and if you
[1:18:44] notice how brother ly tonight was was a
[1:18:49] somber mood it wasn't a happy joyous
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:57] sermon study it was it's all it's all
[1:19:03] vanity what what means
[1:19:06] anything what's what's what is there in
[1:19:10] life it's all
[1:19:13] feudal as I believe the translation said
[1:19:16] doesn't
[1:19:18] matter and if you read the
[1:19:21] last the conclusion of the matter
[1:19:25] fear God and keep his
[1:19:27] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[1:19:29] of a
[1:19:30] man for God shall bring every work into
[1:19:34] judgment with every secret thing whether
[1:19:37] it be good or whether it be
[1:19:40] evil imagine for the line of imagine if
[1:19:44] that's all we
[1:19:46] had that's the
[1:19:48] spirit of the
[1:19:51] law where the prophets would bring the
[1:19:56] message of
[1:19:59] condemnation and say that just like the
[1:20:03] author said here it's all feudal serve
[1:20:06] God and you'll do well sin and you'll
[1:20:10] answer for your
[1:20:11] sin but thank God that all of this built
[1:20:18] up to one
[1:20:21] man and when that man came
[1:20:26] that last
[1:20:28] message that Solomon
[1:20:30] said let us hear the conclusion of the
[1:20:33] whole
[1:20:35] matter that conclusion of the whole
[1:20:37] matter
[1:20:39] changed and now you can be forgiven for
[1:20:41] your sins no matter how much you have
[1:20:44] ever done you bring it to that Lord and
[1:20:48] that Savior and he'll wipe it
[1:20:51] away oh
[1:20:54] I I just I felt the spirit as brother L
[1:20:57] was ministering I I felt that feudal
[1:21:00] spirit it's like why should I how many
[1:21:03] times have we heard people say that well
[1:21:06] what good is
[1:21:08] it what's what what good is it to to
[1:21:10] change my
[1:21:12] ways what good is it to serve the
[1:21:16] Lord what good is it I believe uh they
[1:21:19] were um can't
[1:21:22] remember which one they were
[1:21:26] telling believe it was Peter it was
[1:21:28] Peter they said they said what are you
[1:21:30] doing they said everything's going along
[1:21:32] the same way as it always
[1:21:35] has and it's not going to change and
[1:21:37] Peter was steadfast he said no it is
[1:21:39] going to
[1:21:41] change the Lord Jesus is going to return
[1:21:44] and he's going to restore all these
[1:21:46] things and I I just I think if what if
[1:21:50] we just thinking about our friends
[1:21:53] brother L from from
[1:21:55] Israel and I know one day soon there's a
[1:21:58] promise that the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:22:01] is going to go to the
[1:22:03] Jews but I don't even I don't feel like
[1:22:06] I could live like that that there's not
[1:22:09] a
[1:22:10] savior that the
[1:22:12] Messiah they don't understand
[1:22:15] him but by the grace of God he came and
[1:22:20] he forgave our sins and now it's no more
[1:22:23] vanity it's no more more meaningless
[1:22:25] it's it's no more just a feudal attempt
[1:22:28] there is there is salvation there there
[1:22:32] is a change in our
[1:22:35] lives I am so grateful I am so grateful
[1:22:39] for Jesus
[1:22:41] Christ I mean that's like the
[1:22:43] understatement of the century sister
[1:22:45] surely but I am let's let's all stand I
[1:22:48] would
[1:22:49] ask
[1:22:51] congregation to uh to help me to do me a
[1:22:55] favor I
[1:22:57] um as brother ly was going through this
[1:23:00] I've been visiting a young man that's in
[1:23:02] prison he in
[1:23:05] jail over the past month or
[1:23:07] so and
[1:23:09] um you know how right before they're
[1:23:12] sentenced they allow people to read a
[1:23:14] letter brother brandom talked about he
[1:23:16] went to
[1:23:17] Houston um to uh to speak on behalf of
[1:23:21] someone that was in jail um
[1:23:25] and it was
[1:23:26] successful that man was far worse than
[1:23:28] this young man but would you pray with
[1:23:33] me that I can say the right words on
[1:23:37] Friday that if it would be the Lord's
[1:23:40] will that um this young man would
[1:23:46] receive not deserved but receive his
[1:23:49] freedom and I'd like to see him in this
[1:23:52] church um he's just got in with the
[1:23:56] wrong crowd but
[1:23:59] I I wish we could just empty out these
[1:24:02] prisons I wish we could change all of
[1:24:06] these homeless people we see walking
[1:24:08] around I wish
[1:24:11] just but you talk with them and it's
[1:24:14] this right here everything's feudal why
[1:24:16] should I yeah I I know that I know that
[1:24:19] God's real yeah I know he loves me and I
[1:24:20] know this but why if if I if I don't do
[1:24:25] my drugs I'm still
[1:24:28] homeless
[1:24:30] so let's just let's just pray let's bow

[1:24:35] heads our heavenly father I thoroughly
[1:24:39] enjoyed this lesson
[1:24:42] tonight oh God I'm so grateful that this
[1:24:47] life isn't
[1:24:50] feudal as brother L quoted
[1:24:54] the Apostle James and
[1:24:57] he James said our our life is but a
[1:25:02] vapor
[1:25:03] but there's a work to do while we're
[1:25:06] here father that these lives won't just
[1:25:09] pass away but the things that we do to
[1:25:12] tonight than we do with our lives Lord

[1:25:17] it would carry on for generations to
[1:25:20] [Music]
[1:25:21] come Lord let us
[1:25:25] be strong
[1:25:27] Christians strong in the
[1:25:29] faith that these lives are not feudal
[1:25:32] that they're not vanity but Lord that
[1:25:35] they would make a
[1:25:37] difference help us father I thank you
[1:25:40] very much for the word
[1:25:44] tonight pray that it would stay in our
[1:25:46] hearts father that you
[1:25:48] would bless all that we here go before
[1:25:52] us Lord May we surrender to you and give
[1:25:57] our lives over to you and then father
[1:25:59] may your Holy Spirit come in and then
[1:26:00] guide us and use us and then may we be
[1:26:03] bold in preaching your
[1:26:06] gospel granded father we thank you for
[1:26:08] your love to us in Jesus name

[1:30:11] am it is as brother and brother L and I
[1:30:14] have been teaching it's one of the
[1:30:16] poetical books which usually means you
[1:30:19] can just open it up you can jump right
[1:30:22] in and where wherever you're at you're
[1:30:25] going to get some wisdom and you're
[1:30:26] going to get something that that'll be a

[1:30:32] thoroughly enjoyed it tonight I pray
[1:30:34] that the Lord will be with each and
[1:30:37] every one of you brothers and sisters
[1:30:39] never never stop thanking God for his
[1:30:44] son Jesus Christ and for what he did and
[1:30:48] Calvary because no matter what happens
[1:30:51] in our life no matter how bad things get
[1:30:56] no matter how your world might seem like
[1:30:58] it comes down upon you there is always
[1:31:02] hope in Christ and he has
[1:31:06] made I mean he has made a way for people

[1:31:34] Jesus even more because I see that no

[1:31:40] just a judgment there I have somebody
[1:31:43] that's going to go in front of me and
[1:31:45] he's going to be judged for me because
[1:31:48] if I have to be judged I don't think I'm
[1:31:50] going to make it because my life has I
[1:31:53] failed before but there was a sinless
[1:31:57] spotless Lamb of God that stands between
[1:32:00] us and a wrathful God and and
