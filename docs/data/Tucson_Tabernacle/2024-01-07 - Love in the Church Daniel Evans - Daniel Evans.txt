took the skin off your back even so it said that it exposed your bones we want to let you know that you did that because you care because you love us there was no written request but there are many requests on the heart hearts of people that you alone know how to discern and look into and to sort out and to answer and to take care of those things and all of us are probably just like that so we would like to invite you as a guest of honor tonight to come and search and try us and come break bread to our hearts take the scriptures that are read and the whatever type of thought would be on the

when I'm here making decisions about what to sing I think well do we sing that course seven times but you know there's times when these songs get stuck in your head during the week and I don't mean that in a bad sort of way I mean that in a good sort of way it's a it's a blessing to have something of the Lord in our heads and in our minds that just you might say we go through life and an evil thought might want to Prevail upon us but isn't it wonderful when a a good thought a good song a good scripture is prevailing in our mind and we we can't even kind of control it almost and we almost could get maybe annoyed and it's just wonderful when it's a good thing amen it's it's obviously awful when it's a bad thing but I think sometimes the repetition is what just helps us to appreciate it more and more amen amen let's sing I am redeemed bought with a price Jesus has changed my whole life I am redeemed I'm bought with the pr Christ Jesus has changed my whole life if anybody asks you just who I am oh tell this I am redeemed oh I am redeemed but with a price Jesus has changed my whole life if anybody asks you just who who I am tell them I am redeemed oh I am redeemed bought with a

humbly plead for more blessings Lord the greatest blessing that we could ask is to have more of you and to know you better father as we approach this service tonight we pray that you'd be with us and father these all important ordinances that we're going to take tonight Lord we pray that you would give us the understanding and the revelation of what they mean and father may we come before this table Worthy Christian people taking the bo body and the blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ father we humbly invite your presence to be with us in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you can take your seats thank you once again it's good to be house the good to be in the house of the Lord um tonight obviously we have a a very very important thing that we do as Christians and that is taking the body and the blood of our Lord Jesus and it's my hopes that I can give a explanation and help everyone here to decide is this something that you should be doing and hopefully I can help you to understand what in fact we are are doing tonight um a few announcements first I uh I mentioned that I want to have the our annual Church election um next Sunday we'll do it next Sunday morning and I will send out a WhatsApp giving some more of the details but one of the things that I would like to do is I I would also like to present the um bylaws the church bylaws to the church um and have you all number one review them pray over them and then if they would be acceptable to a majority of the people then ratify them also next Sunday morning so next Sunday morning at the Lord's willing we um have asked certain Brothers to pray about taking the offices that are in this church it's my understanding that this will probably be the first election that uh this church H has had as far as electing all of the offices in the church um it's much different now obviously I'm not the founding pastor of this church I am the pastor of this church but I'm not the founding Pastor so things are different and I'd like to handle things different than before and you can imagine if you start a church then this church grows up with your vision of this church but when someone else comes in and is elected it's a much different situation because we have a lot of lot of things that that we bring with us as far as our past and a lot of the ways that we have had Church before so it's it's a little bit I'm trying to navigate through those things and still trying to find the mind of the Lord on on these these things with the church um so I've asked um for deacons I don't want to fill all of the deacon roles I want to leave some of at least one of those positions of Deacon open um because there there are many qualified people I believe um but those deacons must be first tried and the Three Brothers that I've asked to come before the church and be voted on for deacons I believe have been tried and that is uh brother Lyall Johnson who has been with the Tucson Tabernacle for a long time everyone knows him brother Aaron Gara the same and I've asked brother Jordan Peterson to resign his position as a trustee and move into the position of Deacon um and then that also that leaves at least one position for the Deacon open uh as I said that there are I believe qualified brothers that could have that position I just in praying about it I felt to go the right now to go slow so with those Brothers next week and then for trustees there's a few positions that I want to leave open for the trustee but right now I would I've asked brother Ed dugall and brother Arie Peterson to continue on in those roles as trustee so those roles will also be coming before a vote next Sunday so please pray about these five brothers with um brother Jordan brother Lyall brother Aaron for deacons brother Ed and brother Arie as trustees as I said I would um I look forward to adding to those positions um in the future I also I know that the way that brother brandom set things forward that the pastor is the absolute in the church and and he's really if you look at brother brandom and what he said the Pastor is not necessarily to be voted on but I believe that we are a sovereign church I am the pastor of this church and it is my choice that I would also like to be voted Ved on Whenever there is an election for the offices in the church I also would like to come before the church and be voted on in the pastor position I think that's the right thing to do especially not being the founding Pastor I think it's respectful to especially those that have been in this church for so long so that's that's important to me that's the way we will move forward I will send out the details this week so please pray about that um and uh sometimes as I was going through the Book of Leviticus a few weeks ago there was something that really caught my eye and that was when the people and the priests were making an atonement for sin there were certain sins that required an atonement that the brother or the sister didn't know that they did now those when when they didn't know that they did it it doesn't make it not a sin it's still a sin but when that person became aware of their sin then they would offer an atonement for that and as I said just because we don't know it's a sin doesn't mean that we're not sinning so we need to be careful and always put things before the Lord in prayer and that's what I was talking talking about this morning about how important it is for us always to stay in prayer and stay in touch with the Lord and then when we receive that Holy Spirit into our lives there is a scripture that that says that we should pray always that we should always be in prayer and how can you do that we can't always be on our knees praying we can't always be standing at the altar praying but when you receive that Holy Spirit there is a communion between the the individual and God himself that is always going on it's all it's just constant back and forth communication so you can pray all the time and then when you go into a certain situation and that Holy Spirit might tell you you're wrong that's a sin and if you're in touch with that you can step back from that but many times and all of us do it we'll hear that still Small Voice and then we'll plow forward and that is a sin and that's that's why we make so many mistakes is because that human nature will overcome that Holy Spirit that's telling us so that's why it's important what I was talking about this morning always stay in prayer always put these things before the Lord and then the Lord will correct Us in Ezekiel I believe it is it talks about that God is I believe it's in Ezekiel he's addressing Ezekiel and he he says that you're a Watchman and he tells that prophet he says that if you tell the people that they are sinning and you point out this sin then you will not be responsible but if you see the sin going on and you don't point it out then Watchman you will be responsible along with the sinner so it shows how important this position in the Pulpit is and and I do take it very very seriously and I I'm trying and the same goes with this church election and moving forward I believe it's God's will that we have elected offices in the church brother brandom thought it important for his own church to have those elected offices and I look at the brandham Tabernacle or the way brother brandham set up and brother brandom's leadership many of these things are not in the Bible but I look at his leadership as the absolute on these things and say okay well that's that's the way that we will go about this now we are as I said we're a sovereign entity and brother Brandon would say that and he has said that each church is different and we are we are different than we have different problems and we different strengths than than the brandom Tabernacle Le would have had but I use that as an example in seeing that these elected offices I want to make sure that we do everything that we can in case God wants to bless us and God may be and I'm not saying he is but he may be holding back a blessing because there's little things that we haven't got done so this election is important and I I want to move forward with that so that that there's nothing that I can see Lord I'm doing everything that I can father and I'm I'm trying to move forward the way that you want us to move forward and I see that this is something we have to do I want to get this done the best that we know how and he knows he he he knows that we're children and he will guide us so and the same thing goes for this communion that we call communion that we're going to be taking tonight the Bible says to let a man examine himself doesn't say examine someone else it says let a man examine himself we have what's called an open communion here at the Tucson Tabernacle there will be different people that are at different stages in their walk with the Lord and we'll see them come up and we'll see that some people are at this Milestone other people are at this Milestone maybe some or over at this Milestone and we'll see that there are different Milestones being covered here but one thing that should be equal and that is all of our sincerity to serve the Lord whatever stage that we are at we should equally have a desire to serve God God and that's what I want to see in coming up to this communion table we should be sincere we should be deadly sincere because this is a very very important thing that that we are going to do because the Bible says and I'll read it tonight it says if you take the body and the blood of Jesus Christ unworthy you are guilty of his body same thing as being the murderer of Jesus Christ you are guilty of that so as you're thinking on these things today and as I'm reading these scriptures remember that if you are up here taking this unworthy that if your sins are unconfessed and not under the blood of Jesus Christ you are guilty of that body but then there is another side to this and that other side is if you don't take this communion Jesus said in in feet washing with Peter Peter said you're not gonna we're not going to do this Peter says Jesus says listen if you don't do this you have no part with me that's how important these ordinances are feet washing taking the bread and taking the wine so if you have sin unconfessed sin in your life that you haven't brought before the Lord Jesus you haven't repented and you haven't made that commitment Lord I'm going to make this right then you shouldn't be up here and then on the other side you should be up here taking this because that means you will have a part in Christ that means you're a Christian when I say open communion I don't believe I believe it's a Catholic practice to refuse someone Comm communion I believe that because a man whether it be a priest a pastor a CL clergy or whatever it is has no right to say that you cannot partake in the body and the blood of Jesus Christ like the Catholics do I don't believe that is right I don't believe that it's scriptural but I do believe it is up to the Watchmen here to warn the congregation if you come up here unworthily there is a problem in your life whether you have sin a secret sin that you should go before the Lord Lord I'm not going to do it anymore Lord I'm Gonna Change secret before the Lord or if you have a problem with somebody else you need to make sure that that problem is fixed or else you're coming again unworthy these things are part of the design I think from God is to make sure that we're always checking ourselves that that we're not sinning because he says basically if you do over here you're wrong if you do over here you're wrong the best thing is just to get sin out of our Lives best to get all that odd out of I the best is just to do our best to serve Jesus Christ the best that we know how move forward confess sin say Lord I'm sorry I was wrong if I did somebody else wrong you have to go to that person and make it right now if there's something that comes to your mind maybe tonight that I didn't do Lord I should have made this right you can make that commitment here and you can make that commitment before the Lord and then you're you're right the Lord knows he knows you're going to do it you can take that communion and then make sure you get to that person and then you make that right because if you don't then you just sinned when you came up here example Stephanie and I we um we're building a house in Jeffersonville years ago and we got ripped off by the um granite company that made the like granite countertops and what happened was they they told us that it's going to be this much and so we said okay good this is a little bit less than all the other bids that we got let's go ahead and let's do it and then they came back when we had to pay the bill and it was significantly thousands of dollars higher so what did I do I said said I'm not paying it I'm not doing it and they said well look you signed over here we had a meeting a few weeks ago which they just slipped in this paper they said you sign this so you're you're liable for this I said I'm not doing it and I wrote them a check for the original amount and that was it that was it for the Granite Company we got our granite and it always bothered me year after year that bothered me because I I was right I was right they tried to rip me off man that this was wrong so but it always bothered me I never told Stephanie about it but I always thought maybe I didn't do right so one morning Stephanie I are up early is like a Saturday or Friday and we're sitting in bed and I'm drinking my coffee coffee and this is years how many years later honey five six seven years significant right there many years later we're drinking our coffee i' never mentioned it to my wife we're drinking our coffee and Stephanie says she says you remember that Granite Company and I was thinking about it I was like yeah she said something on the order of you know I never felt right about that and I said I didn't either anyone so what I did we didn't have we didn't have any money we were just really struggling the Lord provided for us but but we really struggled to make ends meet what we did is we went into our home equity line of credit wrote a check brought it down to the Granite Company well what I did was is I contacted the granite company and I said here's the deal we never resolve this years and years and years ago same salesperson we didn't resolve this years and years and years ago um I think we owe you $5,000 or $3,000 or whatever it was um we didn't come to an agreement what will you settle for she said the full amount did not didn't give us a break at all it's like hey I'm being a CR I'm being nice you know you know they don't want to have a testimony say oh well they came back and said I have to pay anything and everybody was good and smile and handshake she said every single penny so we wrote a check for the thousands of dollars of difference that it was even though we didn't have a have the money and we made it right I don't want that to be something that keeps me from this communion table or keeps me out of heaven so if you have something like that I'm not telling you to go pay somebody that ripped you off but if there is something in your if there is something in your life we were we were by for some reason we were I was wrong in that and God didn't like the way I handled it so I had to make that right and if there's something in your life that you need to make right I would recommend that you do it or make the commitment to do it in this communion as I was talking about this morning God just like all of the parents here don't you just love it when you see your kids and and they're together and they're getting along and and they're having fun and they're playing don't you love it when that happens doesn't that feel good for a parent to have that I mean usually when our kids were growing up it was great when our kids were learning their instruments we're like oh this is great you have meline on the mandolin and Daniel's over there on the guitar and and things would go well and then after a while man they started fighting and mine would be like Daddy he's not playing it right and and Daniel would be like I'm going to play the way I want to play and they they're there and they're playing gospel music fighting and squabbling and it didn't make me feel good as a dad but when we see our children getting along working together loving each other that is what a true father and a true mother wants and that's what he wants our heavenly father wants with this communion he wants us together he wants us looking out for each other loving one another in the Book of John the Gospel of John things were starting to lead up to the crucifixion of Christ in John chapter 10 Jesus is talking about The Shepherd of the sheep and he says this John chap 10:14 he says says I am the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and have known and am known of mine he says as the father knoweth me even so I know the father and I lay down my life for the Sheep that's a true Shepherd laying down his life for these sheep and other sheep listen to this now Jesus is here and he's talking talking to his people and he says this and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring outside of what we might consider Believers or outside of what we would consider in our little box someone that we may never even think of them also I must bring and they shall hear hear my voice not the pastor's voice not necessarily your Church's voice but the voice of Jesus Christ himself and they shall hear my voice and there shall be onefold and one Shepherd as far as unity in the Bible I don't know a more powerful statement than Jesus said right there that there shall be one fold and one Shepherd do you think he likes looking down and seeing all of the Catholics and the methodists and all of us and all of the different ones thinking that they're better than one another and here is God loving them all and saying you know I told you not to fight and I told you when I return that I'm going to know you by your love one for another therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again this commandment I have received of my father who could say such words I have power to lay my life down any of us could lay our lives down any of us could take our own lives or give our lives for someone else but which one of us could say I can take my life and bring it back up that's only one that's God in flesh Jesus Christ so in preparing Jesus was talking he started really moving toward toward preaching unity and preaching love and as this day approached this day of of um this feast day this Passover feast as it approached more and more Jesus started to preach on these things and then the time had come that they needed to find a place to eat this last supper let's go to Matthew chapter 26:1 17 says this now the first day of the Feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for for thee to eat the Passover and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand I will keep the Passover at thy house with my disciples in other words Jesus is telling the messenger go and tell this certain man that the teacher says my time to suffer the atonement of sin is at hand I wonder what that messenger thought when Jesus sent him out who knows which disciple it was or who whoever um he sent out but when he went to this man and they reserved this upper room area that they could have dinner have supper I wonder what he was thinking that the master said that my time is at hand over and over and over Jesus started starts prophesying of his death and the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them and they made ready the Passover now when the even was come he sat down with the 12 so now they sit down at supper and Jesus they they have the the unleavened bread and they have the wine there and then let's let's move over to John Chapter 13 we'll start with verse 31 that Jesus was they were eating at the table and Jesus tells the disciples he says one of you is going to betray me and the disciples all started getting nervous like who's who's it gonna be and then finally Jesus sends Judas out to go do what he has to do and that was sending Judas out to betray Jesus and now he just just has his other disciples there John 13:31 says therefore when he was gone out speaking Judas left Jesus says now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him now they're sitting around the supper table and they're talking if God be glorified in him God shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him little children yet a little while I am with you you shall seek me and as I said unto the Jews whether I go you cannot come now I say it to you just my little group here a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another this is going to be a common theme in this last supper that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another look at he repeated it twice in the same sentence by this shall all oh men know that you are my my disciples if you have love one for another here's the master he's got his few Little Disciples around here and he keeps telling them the same thing repeating himself John 1412 says this verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments it's very important also that if we say we love Jesus then there is something that we have to do also and that is to do what he said to do to follow his teaching and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you now there is talking to them and end shall be in you what a what a promise that he says there he says that basically that I'm here with you that that this Spirit of Truth this holy spirit is in flesh right now it's with you and here's the good here's the thing this is going to get a lot better it's going to be in you I will not leave you comfortless he's giving them comfort for something that they don't even know that's going to happen yet I I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live ye shall live also and that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you it's very very close relationship our lord Jesus is prophesying that he is going to have with these disciples he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me again he's saying do what I say and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Judas Judas saith unto him not his carrot Lord how is it that thou Willl manifest manifest thyself to us and not unto the world and Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him again prophesying of this holy spirit that is going to come and take up dwelling in these vessels in this Temple room remember they used to worship in the temple and this Temple it was it wasn't brother Paul it it wasn't the ultimate thing the temple represented something that was going to happen remember Solomon built this Temple and the Holy Spirit came down Moses built the Tabernacle and the Holy Spirit came down the pillar of fire came down the same thing happened when they built that uh the the structure there in Jerusalem Solomon's Temple but that was just representative of what would one day happen which is that same Pillar of Fire that same Holy Spirit would come into a body these bodies not a building built with hands but the but the Temple of our bodies he that loveth me keepeth not he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the father which sent me again Jesus expects us to live by this Bible if you love me do what this word says he goes so far as to say if you don't follow my Commandments then you don't love me what happens what really is I'll put it in simple terms is you love the world more than you love God you'll love that sin more than you love God all of us whether it be gossiping whether it be lying whether it be dirt whether it be more filthy sin sleeping around or or partying or whatever it is when we do that we put that higher than we put God it's a strange thing but we do it these things have I spoken to you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance what whatsoever I have said unto you I quoted first Thessalonians I got a coffee cup that uh has first Thessalonians on there and it says this it says 1 Thessalonians 5:16 Rejoice Evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you as I said before how can we pray without ceasing well that Holy Spirit is inside of us and we're constantly communing with that Holy Spirit peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid uh they probably have no idea what's going on here they can probably see the concern upon the Lord Jesus there because Jesus knew what was about to happen and he's comforting them he's not saying Pat me on the back he's saying listen I'm leaving and he's about to suffer more than anyone has ever suffered in the history of the world but I want to leave you some instructions love one another receive me into your soul you have heard how I said unto you I go away and come again if you loved me you would Rejoice because I say I go to the I go unto the father for my father is greater than I and now I have told you before it come to pass that when it has come to pass ye might believe Hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world World cometh we know who that is right at this time that he was saying this Judas is Carrot is making a deal over here with the priests to take Jesus to his death for the prince of this world cometh and have nothing in me but that the world may know that I love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so do I arise and let us go hence now all of this there's a few chapters that are discussion around this supper table that we are going to take tonight this is this communion table the first time that this happened Jesus is there and he's giving all of these promises and they're doing the same thing that we're about to do Jesus said here this is my body this is my blood take this in remembrance of me remember me while you're doing this and he gives the promise over and over again of the holy spirit this comforter he gives this promise that this holy spirit that I have to go and you're going to be really sad and you're going to be really scared remember my words they comfort you but I am leaving and it's going to work out for your benefit and thank God that he he left because then he came back as a spirit inside of us in another Upper Room at the day of Pentecost what a beautiful story this story of Jesus Christ talking to his Bel beloved disciples making them promises and saying I'm going to be closer to you than you ever imagined and he says let you should be happy and they had no idea then a few hours later Jesus would be taken and they would be scared to death and they would all run away but these words I guarantee you that he spoke to them around this supper table rang in their mind and then he says at that last verse he says arise and let us go hence they're all sitting at the table and he says all right let's get up and I believe it was in Matthew maybe in John I think it was in Matthew that they sang A Hymn and then they left and then they started down the mountain on the way to to the Garden of Gethsemane we know what happened there but all of this that he talked about was all around the supper table all around where we are going to take these ordinances and the theme was love one another forgive one another go to battle for one another pray for one another and you look at and you look at all the disciples when they wrote their letters the ones that were sitting at the sitting at the table at the communion table what did they all teach taught it this morning James love one another pray for one another lay hands on one another when John the APO the the Beloved disciple he says God is love and he said little little children love one another Peter all of them that were there the most important thing to them was love and it was all around this table and that's when we take these ordinances tonight and we'll get started right now when we take these ordinances think about what Jesus what I was just reading that Jesus taught at the original Last Supper and what we're doing tonight is we are reenacting that brother Lyall you we have all of the um the feast days and all of that every single feast day and every single holiday that they had was in commemoration of something that God had done and what they do is they tell the story and they Rel live it we can apply the same to Christmas we talk about the birth of Christ and we talk about the Star of David and we talk about all all of the wisen and all that what we're doing is we're commemorating that just as they did on these feast days and here we have what is probably the most important of them and that is this communion where we are actually taking what represents the body and the blood of our Lord and savior just exactly as they did on that day 2,000 years ago it's a great honor I hope everyone is able to take this body but I would warn you and I believe God will God will honor it if you are not worthy if you feel that you have something in your life and you don't take it I believe that God will honor that also I believe that with all my heart this is in an individual Affair as I said we have an open communion there will be people coming here that are at different stages in their Christian walk but none should be any more sincere than anyone else as far as their their desire to serve the Lord is that clear if the brothers would come forward 1 Corinthians chapter 11 I'll read verse 23 through 32 this is the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul obviously wasn't there at that day but a minister of the Gospel what he was doing was he was saying here is what import is important for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks remember all the disciples around the table when he had given thanks he break it and he said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood do this do this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord very serious statement who was guilty of the body and blood of the Lord his name is Judas is Carrot but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world we need our our musicians to come forward also so the next step is Jesus prayed over the bread and he prayed over the wine and then it was broken and given to the people so Brothers if we could come forward this is the the wine pray over the bread first this bread we don't believe in transubstantiation we don't believe that this bread turns into the actual Body of Christ but this bread represents that body let's bow our heads our heavenly father Lord through the past 2,000 years many brothers and sisters in Christ have prayed over the unleavened bread Lord we stand with those many of them were killed for what they believed Lord we stand with those dear saints of God that have lived through the ages and doing the same thing that you commanded and we pray Lord that this bread that represents the broken body of our Lord and savior father may your blessings be upon it and Lord May every person that takes of this bread may they receive strength for the battle that is to come we pray may your blessings be upon it sanctify us Lord that we may be worthy to take it in Jesus Christ's name amen this wine [Music] it's not grape juice it's not water it's wine that has the seed The Germ in it that ferments and gets better with age and and this wine represents this blood that was shed upon the cross shed on the ground represents that blood and Jesus said said as he gave this wine he said this is my blood do this in remembrance of me father I Lay My Hand both of my hands on these dishes that contain these cups of wine father may your Holy Spirit abide Lord may this wine as it's taken by the Believers I pray that that it would enter into our bodies and father I pray that it would represent the Holy Spirit entering into our bodies the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ father we know that it it's not the blood but it represents the blood Lord we pray that that you would bless it Lord sanctify it sanctify us and we may be worthy to take this ordinance of the wine in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you Brothers if you could go ahead and [Music] u [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

dawn of a another [Music] day and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas's carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth up riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured porth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet and Peter answered and Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest now not know not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith un saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen what uh what a blessed time that we have in going through these things that Jesus went through and I can imagine sitting around this supper table with him as he gave these instructions and told us of these things that are to come and that one day that that Spirit would enter in to these disciples and if they love him if we love him we'll keep his Commandments brother Dan numer if you can come and close in prayer so friends the um next part of the service the men will go upstairs to the chapel and the sisters will be in the fellowship hall and uh we will stay up there the brothers until until you're finished with washing feet and again it's a great honor to do what we have done tonight thinking about our lord Jesus doing what he instructed us to do
