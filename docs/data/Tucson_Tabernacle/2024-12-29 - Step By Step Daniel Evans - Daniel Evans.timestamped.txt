[20:03] stubs at the bottom of his legs and
[20:06] brother green had his head bowed but he
[20:08] was looking like this and brother
[20:10] Brenham dropped the child in the middle
[20:12] of the prayer and God created two feet

[36:12] morning um it's a last our last service
[36:17] of the
[36:18] year and it's been uh It's Been a Good
[36:21] Year
[36:22] it's I know that change is difficult
[36:27] but change is necessary for Success
[36:32] brothers and sisters it is that's way
[36:35] whenever you see something that's
[36:37] successful whether it be in the ministry
[36:39] or whether it be in business it always
[36:42] has a component of drastic change that's
[36:46] when Jesus was here when Jesus showed up
[36:49] he was very successful and it was
[36:51] because he changed
[36:53] everything he kept the word the
[36:56] foundation but he made sweeping changes
[37:00] that's how every reformer that's how
[37:01] every church that makes a change that's
[37:04] how every successful
[37:07] businessman you have to be able to
[37:09] change and it's I know it's difficult
[37:13] but it's part of it and uh we've had a
[37:16] lot of changes this year we we um have a
[37:20] new flooring in the fellowship hall we
[37:23] have new flooring in the um in the low
[37:26] room for the kids we have a new
[37:28] Fellowship Hall uh we have a new
[37:30] Courtyard we have there there's been a
[37:33] lot that's been done this year and I'm
[37:35] thankful for it and really it's just
[37:38] kind of revv me up because I want to do
[37:41] more I think that once and we're we're
[37:44] pretty much finished in there we got to
[37:45] get our countertops in and then we're
[37:47] going to move into the sanctuary and
[37:51] these
[37:53] places they're for a purpose they're not
[37:56] just to look at
[37:58] when we when we make changes and we
[38:00] upgrade things and we bring new things
[38:02] in that is to help the congregation to
[38:05] to make it easier for us to make it
[38:08] easier for us to do God's
[38:11] Will and it's a blessing and one of the
[38:15] things I announced the other
[38:17] day I'm very very much looking forward
[38:21] to adding to to presenting to the church
[38:26] and adding to men of God to our uh board
[38:31] our our church board these are two
[38:34] brothers that have worked tirelessly on
[38:37] the fellowship hall worked tirelessly on
[38:39] the grounds and done just a whole lot of
[38:42] work over the past
[38:43] year and I think that they are going to
[38:48] make great additions to our trustee
[38:51] board that's brother John loer here and
[38:55] brother Dan numer we all all know them
[38:58] and know both of them and ask the church

[39:09] and we'll have it next month have it
[39:11] sometime in January it won't be the
[39:13] first week because I'm not ready quite
[39:15] yet with the bylaws there were some
[39:17] bylaws that the lawyer some bylaws

[42:42] I'm just so I'm so thankful in this past
[42:45] year I felt really led to Let's dig deep
[42:50] into the Bible and we have gone through
[42:54] every book in the Old Testament this
[42:58] past year from Genesis all the way
[43:01] through Malachi studying and learning
[43:05] and I really believe that that it's
[43:08] building a foundation for us as all of
[43:10] the things that we're doing are building
[43:12] a foundation the first year or half a
[43:15] year that I was here I really wanted to
[43:17] build Unity I wanted the church to get
[43:19] to know each other we had we had a we
[43:22] had camps we had um preached a lot on
[43:25] the book of Acts I really hit legalism
[43:28] hard I I I stood against it because I
[43:31] believe that it it causes harm I I I
[43:34] stood strong on that and plus I wanted
[43:36] you to know what kind of a pastor you
[43:37] were getting so when I first started the
[43:40] first six months I was here in a trial
[43:42] role I really hit it hard and then
[43:44] you'll notice I backed
[43:46] off and and just started just preaching
[43:50] the word the best the best that I knew
[43:52] how and then this past year I believe
[43:55] the Lord has really started to build a
[43:59] foundation in us that we are
[44:02] learning with Knowledge Learning what
[44:05] this book is about building a foundation
[44:09] for a work that is to come for a work
[44:12] that we can do and we have the the
[44:16] facility the the building is getting so
[44:18] much better we we we're more efficient
[44:20] over in the fellowship all I want to
[44:22] start using it I want it to be used for
[44:25] the ministry
[44:28] 2025
[44:29] 2024 I believe was a
[44:32] preparation for 2025 and 2025 I want it
[44:36] to be a Outreach Ministry I want us to
[44:41] hit this hard let's let's everyone do
[44:44] something and use this these things that
[44:47] we've built whether it be our knowledge
[44:48] in the word whether it be the church
[44:51] whether it be the upper rooms or the
[44:53] lower rooms or whatever it might be
[44:56] we're going to have Harmony in
[44:58] 2025 we're going to be doing doing more
[45:01] I want to have more dinners over in the
[45:03] fellowship hall now that we have it
[45:05] building Unity here and and bringing
[45:09] people in and we start brothers and
[45:12] sisters Outreach in the traditional
[45:15] sense is is a is a difficult thing it's
[45:18] usually not very successful but Outreach
[45:22] to our
[45:23] families Outreach to our friends
[45:26] Outreach to to our neighbors there is
[45:29] where we find success it's very hard to
[45:32] go to a stranger and witness to that
[45:34] stranger because that stranger is going
[45:36] to say who are
[45:37] you but when you build someone's trust
[45:40] or when you have someone's trust that is
[45:43] where success is built and we need to
[45:46] have a place that we can come together
[45:49] and serve the people and that is what
[45:52] this church is for I already started
[45:56] talking to my neph the other day of
[45:57] Christmas he wants to have a Bible study
[46:01] so I'm going to open up my house to some
[46:03] of the youth and these aren't youth from
[46:05] this church this is my nephew who who's
[46:08] not never been I don't think he's ever
[46:10] even been here but his friends have
[46:13] questions on their hearts these are kids
[46:16] that are 18 19 years old I'm going to
[46:18] open we're going to open our house for
[46:20] them and bring them in and let's let's
[46:22] start studying let's dig into this word
[46:24] what questions do you have
[46:27] and this past year all of us if you've
[46:32] been here if you've made the made the
[46:33] commitment to come on Wednesday night
[46:35] you have
[46:36] learned you may not think that you have
[46:38] but you have you've learned what this
[46:42] Bible is about you've learned that that
[46:45] these prophets have come and they've
[46:47] preached these messages and these
[46:49] messages many times they came at the
[46:51] same time they came when when God was
[46:54] fixing to move they came in the in the
[46:57] in the the Babylonian captivity much of
[47:00] the Old Testament was written around
[47:01] there they came when when Samuel was
[47:04] here and and the people were just having
[47:06] all kinds of problems in the Book of
[47:07] Judges and idolatry had entered in they
[47:10] came the um the the prophets came when
[47:14] Abraham who who laid the foundation when
[47:17] God was
[47:18] moving and that's I believe that God is
[47:21] going to move in
[47:23] 2025 and I want to do everything that I
[47:25] can that he might use this
[47:28] vessel to do his will to win souls to
[47:33] his kingdom and I want this church every
[47:36] single one of us has a role in this you
[47:39] may think you don't but you do and there
[47:42] is no role that is more important than
[47:45] any other role and I want to encourage
[47:47] the church to step to the plate in 2025
[47:53] we did well in
[47:54] 2024 now we have laid a foundation found
[47:57] now let's build on that foundation and
[47:59] let's start working let's get to work
[48:02] let's get these let's get this job done
[48:05] let's finish it we always think well I'm
[48:08] just waiting on the lord it's a nice
[48:10] thing to say maybe the Lord's waiting on
[48:15] us maybe he's been waiting for 2,000
[48:18] years on someone that would really
[48:21] believe his word and someone that will
[48:24] put it to
[48:25] work and we'll get it done it's coming I
[48:28] think the time is right so let's take
[48:31] our little group of 150 or 200 people
[48:34] that we have at the Tucson Tabernacle
[48:36] and let's let's accomplish what L the
[48:39] Lord has for us to
[48:41] do and how do we do it we follow this
[48:46] blueprint right here Psalm 119 it says
[48:50] that the word is a lamp to our feet it's
[48:56] what lights the
[48:58] path and and a a a lamp to our feet you
[49:02] only know the next step or the next
[49:05] couple
[49:06] steps and you just walk in this light
[49:10] and you stay on the
[49:11] path step by step we go through this
[49:16] life and step by step we need to be
[49:19] getting closer to God brothers and
[49:22] sisters listen to me every day should be
[49:26] be a step closer to God and if you
[49:30] haven't gotten any closer to the Lord in
[49:32] this past year or in the past five years
[49:36] or in the past 10 years then there is
[49:38] something
[49:39] wrong there's not something there's
[49:41] nothing something wrong with God there's
[49:44] something wrong with
[49:47] us step by
[49:50] step we go back to the Book of
[49:53] Joshua and the prophet Moses had died
[49:58] God made all of these promises to His
[50:02] prophets from Abraham all the way to
[50:04] Moses and he said that you are going to
[50:06] go over into this Promised
[50:08] Land And now when Joshua was there the
[50:12] prophet passed away and it was time to
[50:16] go over and realize the promises that
[50:20] were
[50:22] given this book of Joshua brothers and
[50:24] sisters I believe it is as applic able
[50:27] for today as any other book in the Bible
[50:30] it is time to go
[50:33] over and we all have a part to play and
[50:36] you'll see when we get into Joshua today
[50:39] every person had an equal
[50:41] part start with Joshua chter 1 verse one
[50:45] and I'll read some of the scriptures
[50:47] here says this now after the death of
[50:49] Moses the servant of the Lord it came to
[50:51] pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the
[50:54] son of nun Moses's min Minister saying
[50:58] Moses my servant is
[51:00] dead now therefore arise and go over
[51:03] this Jordan thou and all this people un
[51:06] the land which God which I do give them
[51:10] even to the children of Israel every
[51:13] place that the soul of your foot shall
[51:15] tread upon that I that I have given unto
[51:18] you as I said unto Moses Moses the Lord
[51:21] is quoting in Deuteronomy 11 that he
[51:24] told Moses the same thing
[51:27] that every step that you take that I
[51:31] have given this to
[51:34] you we we put it in today's terms maybe
[51:38] and we say it and and there's there's
[51:39] been a lot of a prayer request this
[51:41] morning Lord I got another day of pain
[51:43] I'm sick but by the grace of God I took
[51:48] ground from the enemy I took another
[51:51] step in my life I got through another
[51:53] day and other people say Lord I want an
[51:55] extra hour
[51:57] maybe without a
[51:59] cigarette I made I I took some
[52:02] ground or you could say maybe I skipped
[52:05] if you're trying to to lose some weight
[52:08] maybe I skipped that that snack before
[52:12] bed Lord I I I took a
[52:15] step maybe I didn't contribute to the
[52:17] gossip when I had a
[52:19] chance maybe I spent an hour or less on
[52:21] my phone today than I did
[52:24] yesterday maybe my husband and I and I
[52:26] didn't get on a fight today my wife and
[52:29] I didn't argue today we took some ground
[52:33] and that ground that we took it was
[52:35] given to me now don't go back keep going
[52:39] forward don't backslide and if you do
[52:42] backside get back up and start taking
[52:44] ground again because God gave it to you
[52:47] he gave it to me and he gave it to
[52:49] Joshua he said every place that the sole
[52:52] of your feet steps is
[52:55] yours and that's how we are I I I I'm
[52:59] not what I want to be as brother Bram
[53:01] talked about the the the sister in the
[53:04] South I'm not what I want to
[53:06] be and I'm not what I ought to be but
[53:10] I'm not what I used to be I've taken
[53:12] some
[53:13] ground let's take more ground this year
[53:18] and when you make
[53:21] progress
[53:23] don't go back stand strong whether it's
[53:26] sickness whether it's it's an addiction
[53:30] whatever it is even if it's one
[53:34] minute Less on the little square
[53:37] Idol even if it's one less cigarette in
[53:41] the
[53:43] day whatever it might be even if it's
[53:46] just one less that's still ground that
[53:48] you've taken from the enemy it's still
[53:50] ground that you that is is yours now
[53:53] take it and then take another step step
[53:56] by step we can get through this this
[53:59] battle verse number four from the
[54:01] Wilderness in this Lebanon even unto the
[54:04] Great River the river of Euphrates and
[54:06] all the land of the Hittites and under
[54:09] the great sea toward the Goring down of
[54:11] the sun shall be your
[54:13] Coast there shall not any man be able to
[54:16] stand before thee all the days of thy
[54:18] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[54:21] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[54:23] forsake Thee I know he was talking to
[54:25] Joshua but I'm claiming that scripture
[54:28] for
[54:32] myself be strong and of good courage For
[54:36] unto this people shalt thou divide for
[54:38] an inheritance the land which I swear
[54:40] unto the F unto their fathers to give
[54:42] them only be thou strong and very
[54:46] courageous not just
[54:48] courageous be very courageous that thou
[54:52] mayest observe to do according to all
[54:54] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[54:56] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[55:00] or to the left that thou mayest Prosper
[55:04] wherever thou goest don't turn from the
[55:07] word of
[55:08] God Moses wrote those first five books
[55:12] of the Bible and he's God is telling
[55:15] Joshua here don't turn from what you
[55:17] have
[55:18] heard stay with it and with those words
[55:22] you will
[55:24] prosper this book of of the law shall
[55:27] not depart out of thy mouth but Thou
[55:29] shalt meditate therein day and night
[55:31] that thou mayest observe to do according
[55:34] to all that is written therein for then
[55:38] Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[55:40] then Thou shalt have good
[55:43] success this was more important he's
[55:47] talking to Joshua who was about to go to
[55:49] battle and he's saying this is more he
[55:52] didn't say anything about you train your
[55:53] soldiers make sure that they have this
[55:55] sord or that sword make sure that their
[55:57] their Shields are strong enough he's
[55:59] saying don't forget the word he's saying
[56:03] and let it be in your mouth all the time
[56:05] let you be talking about it all the time
[56:07] it's more important than your education
[56:08] it's more important than your training
[56:10] let it be constantly constantly coming
[56:13] out of you meditating on it day and
[56:15] night all the
[56:17] time then
[56:19] you shall make your way prosperous let
[56:23] me read that again this book of the law
[56:26] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[56:27] Thou shalt meditate therein day and
[56:30] night that thou mayest observe to do
[56:32] according to all that is written therein
[56:35] for
[56:37] then
[56:38] thou
[56:40] you will make your way
[56:43] prosperous you have a choice here it's
[56:45] up to
[56:47] you you can put the Lord first you can
[56:49] put his word first you can do according
[56:51] to his word and you can
[56:54] prosper God's leaving it up to you he's
[56:57] leaving it up to
[56:59] me and then you will have good
[57:03] success have not I commanded thee be
[57:07] strong and of good courage Be not Afraid
[57:10] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[57:12] thy God is with thee whether soever thou
[57:16] goest so the Lord gives instructions to
[57:19] Joshua he sends spies we know the story
[57:23] over into
[57:25] Jericho the there they are they're on
[57:26] the other side of this River and this
[57:28] river is not a
[57:30] creek brother L is not like the Jordan
[57:33] River in the
[57:34] summer the river was rushing it it was
[57:37] over its banks it was a time of a flood
[57:40] and here comes all of these people
[57:42] hundreds of thousands if not millions of
[57:44] people come up to this
[57:47] water and Joshua sends out
[57:51] spies and they see out in the distance
[57:54] there is this great City that
[57:56] called Jericho that has these giant
[57:59] walls around it and God wanted them to
[58:02] go take that City why did he want them
[58:05] to take that City there was a
[58:07] predestinated seat in there there was a
[58:10] soul inside that City and Saul was a a
[58:16] prostitute and Saul was a what we would
[58:19] call a nasty
[58:20] woman but there was a soul there in her
[58:24] family
[58:26] he sends out the spies the spies go out
[58:29] they look
[58:30] around they come
[58:33] back they said we're more than able to
[58:36] do it he says they're afraid they they
[58:38] say they're afraid of us let's go Joshua
[58:41] we can do it this
[58:43] year let's improve let's do more he says
[58:47] we can do it remember in kades barnia
[58:50] years earlier they went out and they're
[58:53] like oh they're too big they're too
[58:55] strong
[58:57] God's like but I'm with
[59:01] you that generation died out they had to
[59:04] die out Joshua chapter
[59:09] 3:1 and Joshua Rose early in the
[59:14] morning and they removed from sham and
[59:16] they came to Jordan he and all the
[59:19] children of Israel and they lodged there
[59:22] before they passed over and it came to
[59:23] pass after three days that the officers
[59:26] went through the host and they commanded
[59:28] the people saying when you see the Ark
[59:30] of the Covenant of the Lord your God and
[59:32] the priests and the Levites bearing it
[59:35] then you shall remove from your place
[59:37] and go after it yet there shall be a
[59:41] space between you in it about 2,000
[59:43] cubits by measure come not near unto it
[59:46] that you may know the way by which you
[59:48] must go for you have not passed this
[59:51] way hither hither for you haven't come
[59:54] this way before and here we are
[59:57] again approaching this watch that Arc he
[1:00:02] said stand back so you can have a good
[1:00:04] look at it so you know where it's at all

[1:00:09] haven't come this way before keep your
[1:00:12] eye our Ark today is the word of God
[1:00:15] keep your eye on the word all the time
[1:00:18] don't let it ever depart from you always
[1:00:20] watch
[1:00:22] it and Joshua said unto the people
[1:00:25] sanctify your eles for
[1:00:27] tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among
[1:00:29] you saying get rid of your
[1:00:31] sin if you want to see God do something
[1:00:34] special get rid of your habits if you
[1:00:37] want to see God do something special
[1:00:40] Jesus said one time it
[1:00:43] was the most beautiful
[1:00:47] things he said everything that he said
[1:00:49] was beautiful but he said Lord he said
[1:00:52] father I sanctify myself
[1:00:56] for their
[1:00:59] sake what a
[1:01:01] statement Jesus Christ himself said Lord
[1:01:04] I am making myself pure because I care
[1:01:08] about them and if we have the same
[1:01:11] Spirit of Christ in US brothers and
[1:01:14] sisters should we not make ourselves
[1:01:16] pure should we not live a life above
[1:01:19] reproach not for oursel oh I'm afraid of
[1:01:21] going to hell
[1:01:23] no I want this person to be saved
[1:01:26] I want this person to be healed I want
[1:01:28] my son I want my daughter I want my
[1:01:30] friends I want my family I want them
[1:01:33] Lord I'm going to sanctify myself so
[1:01:35] you'll hear my prayers for
[1:01:41] them he tells the
[1:01:43] priests there was that great river of
[1:01:45] Jordan there swelled up he he tells the
[1:01:48] priests he says you take pick up the Ark
[1:01:51] of the Covenant he said walk up to the
[1:01:55] riv River listen to
[1:01:58] this and he says walk into the
[1:02:04] river they had to have faith walk out
[1:02:08] into it and watch what'll happen so the
[1:02:12] priests go
[1:02:13] out they're carrying the ark and he says
[1:02:17] once you do that then the wa the water
[1:02:19] will stop
[1:02:21] flowing skip to verse 15
[1:02:27] and as as they that bear the ark were
[1:02:30] come un Jordan and the feet of the
[1:02:32] priests that be the ark were dipped in
[1:02:34] the brim of the water for Jordan
[1:02:36] overfloweth all it Bank all its all his
[1:02:39] Banks all the time of the Harvest that
[1:02:42] the waters which came down from from
[1:02:44] above stood and Rose up a a heap very
[1:02:48] far from the city of Adam that is beside
[1:02:51] of
[1:02:53] zaratan and those that came down to
[1:02:55] toward the Sea of the plain even the
[1:02:57] salt sea failed and were cut off and the
[1:03:00] people passed over right against Jericho
[1:03:04] and the priests that bare the Ark of the
[1:03:05] Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry
[1:03:07] ground in the midst of Jordan and the
[1:03:10] Israelites passed over on dry
[1:03:12] ground until all the people were passed
[1:03:16] clean over
[1:03:18] Jordan They Carried this
[1:03:22] Ark and they it just struck me they got
[1:03:25] their feet wet
[1:03:27] they walked in there they had faith that
[1:03:29] God was going to do this and here they
[1:03:30] go they go right into there and then
[1:03:32] they get in the middle of it and the
[1:03:34] water dries up and they're holding the
[1:03:35] ark and here comes everybody walking by
[1:03:37] them
[1:03:40] yeah we're going and there's these
[1:03:44] priests and they're holding the ark and
[1:03:47] the people are walking by and then
[1:03:48] Joshua says oh go back there where that
[1:03:51] Ark is 12 strong men one from each tribe
[1:03:55] and go grab one of those big rocks that
[1:03:58] are in the middle of the Jordan in the
[1:04:00] middle of the flood go grab one and pick
[1:04:03] it up and put it on your shoulder and go
[1:04:05] lay it over here and then when this pile
[1:04:08] is here for generations to come you
[1:04:10] bring people back to this pile of rocks
[1:04:12] and when you're children say what about
[1:04:15] those pile what about these rocks you
[1:04:17] tell them this story of when Israel
[1:04:20] walked over walked through that Jordan
[1:04:22] on dry land beautiful
[1:04:24] story then they get over to this place
[1:04:26] called
[1:04:28] gilgal and one of the most amazing
[1:04:32] things they had lost their
[1:04:35] Heritage these people W wandering in the
[1:04:37] wilderness they had
[1:04:40] forgotten remember all the fighting
[1:04:42] going on and the wandering in the
[1:04:44] wilderness and the complaining with
[1:04:45] Moses and all of that they had forgotten
[1:04:48] who they
[1:04:49] were and Joshua God tells Joshua he says
[1:04:54] circumcise the people
[1:04:56] remember the Covenant with
[1:04:58] Abraham of
[1:05:00] circumcision these people that had come
[1:05:02] over Jordan were not
[1:05:04] circumcised they had
[1:05:07] forgotten they were sons of Abraham a
[1:05:10] friend of God they have forgotten their
[1:05:13] Heritage none of them were
[1:05:16] circumcised so Joshua tells them he says
[1:05:21] now be circumcised you are sons of
[1:05:24] Abraham you are the heritage of God
[1:05:28] you've forgotten who you
[1:05:30] are remember
[1:05:33] now so they were circumcised according
[1:05:37] to God's
[1:05:38] Will and it amazes
[1:05:41] me Jewish people had forgotten that
[1:05:45] commandment all of them but it was a
[1:05:48] took a new
[1:05:50] generation to come over and that old
[1:05:53] complaining generation the Bible calls
[1:05:55] him
[1:05:56] Fighters they were always arguing with
[1:05:58] each other and fighting and and and and
[1:06:01] and just messing everything up they all
[1:06:03] died
[1:06:05] out then they came over and Joshua said
[1:06:07] I'm going to remind you who you
[1:06:09] are I'm G to remind you who your father
[1:06:11] Abraham is and they were
[1:06:14] circumcised let's go to um Joshua 6
[1:06:19] verse
[1:06:20] 10 and Joshua had commanded the people
[1:06:23] saying you shall not shout
[1:06:26] so remember God he told the people he
[1:06:29] says here's what we're going to do we're
[1:06:30] going to God commanded Joshua Joshua
[1:06:33] told the people we are going to walk up
[1:06:35] to this city Jericho now now that we're
[1:06:36] across and God has done this great
[1:06:38] miracle we're going to go up to these
[1:06:40] walls or close to them and God commanded
[1:06:43] that you're going to walk around the
[1:06:46] wall once a day for six days and then on
[1:06:50] the seventh day you're gonna walk around
[1:06:52] it seven times then you're gonna blow
[1:06:54] the trumpet you're going to shout and
[1:06:56] the walls are going to come tumbling
[1:06:58] down now listen to these
[1:07:01] instructions verse number 10 and Joshua
[1:07:04] had commanded the
[1:07:06] people saying ye shall not
[1:07:08] shout nor make any noise with your voice
[1:07:13] neither shall any word proceed out of
[1:07:16] your mouth until the day I bid you shout
[1:07:20] then you shall you shout so the priest
[1:07:24] carried their horn the men carried their
[1:07:27] their their instruments of war and you
[1:07:30] got to think that old that little Rahab
[1:07:32] she's like well they'll told me they
[1:07:34] were coming and here they are walking
[1:07:36] around and nobody's making a peep
[1:07:39] they're all quiet and they're walking
[1:07:40] around walking around the walls what is
[1:07:43] going on
[1:07:45] here brothers and sisters if one
[1:07:49] person one woman one man would have said
[1:07:53] one word it would have all
[1:07:57] failed here they are going around Joshua
[1:08:01] says not one of you shall say one
[1:08:08] word the walls would have stood firm if
[1:08:11] somebody would just said something on
[1:08:14] the third day the second
[1:08:16] day Rahab would have continued her
[1:08:19] prostitution inside the
[1:08:21] walls it would have all been a failure
[1:08:24] if everyone one was not obedient there
[1:08:28] was a requirement that every single
[1:08:31] person followed these Commandments we
[1:08:32] know that that's the case of one person
[1:08:35] because after they they conquered the
[1:08:37] City Jericho one man disobeyed God his
[1:08:41] name was aen just one man and then it
[1:08:44] caused them to lose the next battle and
[1:08:47] it caused many to
[1:08:49] die they were obedient
[1:08:52] here he said he commanded don't say a
[1:08:57] word until I call for it he commanded
[1:09:01] March around
[1:09:03] this imagine today there's a greater
[1:09:06] than
[1:09:07] Joshua his name is Jesus Christ had the
[1:09:10] same
[1:09:12] name Yeshua it's the same word as same
[1:09:15] name as Joshua in the Old Testament
[1:09:17] imagine
[1:09:19] today Jesus Commandments repent of your
[1:09:23] sins imagine if one person person
[1:09:25] doesn't do it one person would have
[1:09:27] ruined the whole program of
[1:09:29] God with
[1:09:31] Joshua love one
[1:09:35] another pray for your
[1:09:38] enemies forgive those who sin against
[1:09:42] you make disciples of Jesus Christ tell
[1:09:47] the world about
[1:09:49] Christ let your light so shine before
[1:09:52] men
[1:09:55] one person if one person didn't do it in
[1:09:59] Joshua's time do you think that if one
[1:10:01] person doesn't now doesn't do it now
[1:10:04] that it'll be any
[1:10:06] different how great are our Stakes how
[1:10:10] important are our lives you think
[1:10:11] anybody's any more important than anyone
[1:10:13] else aen was no nobody even knew who aen
[1:10:16] was oh he's like oh he's the son of the
[1:10:18] son of the son of and then oh he's in
[1:10:21] this tribe oh yeah we we track down who
[1:10:24] aan is
[1:10:27] he was a
[1:10:28] nobody but he was very very
[1:10:32] important and all of us how important is
[1:10:35] is our ministry how's how important is
[1:10:37] our
[1:10:38] lives we can hinder the whole work any
[1:10:41] of us
[1:10:43] can Jesus commanded repent he commanded
[1:10:47] love one another he commanded pray for
[1:10:49] your enemies forgive those who sin
[1:10:51] against you make disciples of Jesus
[1:10:53] Christ he commanded those things and
[1:10:55] what if we're not doing it it messes up
[1:10:58] the whole
[1:11:00] program six days they walked around the
[1:11:02] city as the Lord has instructed and on
[1:11:05] the seventh day they marched around the
[1:11:07] city seven times not a word that is
[1:11:12] amazing to
[1:11:15] me people didn't talk the whole
[1:11:20] time but they
[1:11:23] didn't they shouted that they blew the
[1:11:25] horns the walls came down the battle was
[1:11:28] won Rahab and her family were
[1:11:32] saved I am taken back by that
[1:11:36] story and there is a greater than
[1:11:40] Joshua these gospels give us specific
[1:11:45] Commandments and how much will I hurt
[1:11:48] you if I don't follow them and how much
[1:11:51] will you hurt me and how much will we
[1:11:54] hurt each each other if we are not doing
[1:11:57] these
[1:11:58] things God's people should be operating
[1:12:02] in unity always keeping an eye on the
[1:12:06] word always always watching that Arc
[1:12:08] going before us and when the Battle of
[1:12:10] Jericho was
[1:12:12] won the Battle of between us and Satan
[1:12:17] is going to be won in the same manner
[1:12:19] it's going to be one through discipline
[1:12:21] it's going to be one through dedication
[1:12:24] to the world
[1:12:29] word 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:12:32] 12 we talk about how important it was
[1:12:35] that every person was on the same page
[1:12:37] with Joshua now let's look in this
[1:12:39] modern day let's start with verse four 1
[1:12:43] Corinthians uh 12:4 it says this now
[1:12:45] there are diversities of gifts but the
[1:12:48] Same
[1:12:49] Spirit I'm going to read the new King
[1:12:51] James it's really close but there's a
[1:12:53] couple words that mean a little a little
[1:12:55] different today than they did back then
[1:12:57] um verse number verse number four there
[1:13:00] are diversity of gifts but the Same
[1:13:01] Spirit verse number five there are
[1:13:03] differences of
[1:13:05] Ministries but the same
[1:13:08] lord and there are diversities of
[1:13:10] activities but the same God who works
[1:13:12] all in all but the manifestation of the
[1:13:15] spirit is given to each one for the
[1:13:18] profit of all so every person has a role
[1:13:22] and no role is more important than any
[1:13:24] other
[1:13:25] for to one is given by the spirit of of
[1:13:28] the word wisdom to another the word of
[1:13:30] knowledge by The Same Spirit to another
[1:13:33] Faith by The Same Spirit to another
[1:13:35] Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to
[1:13:37] another working of Miracles to another
[1:13:39] prophecy to another Discerning of
[1:13:41] expence to another diverse kinds of
[1:13:42] tongues and to another interpretation of
[1:13:45] tongues but all these worketh that one
[1:13:49] and self-same spirit dividing every man
[1:13:52] severly as as he will dividing every man
[1:13:55] individually as God
[1:13:57] will for the body is
[1:14:00] one and hath many members and all the
[1:14:03] members of that of that one body being
[1:14:06] many are one body so also is Christ he
[1:14:10] is one and his body is
[1:14:13] one for by one Spirit we're all baptized
[1:14:17] into one body whether it be Jews or
[1:14:19] Gentiles whether we Bond or free and
[1:14:21] have been all made to drink into one
[1:14:24] spirit for the the body is not one
[1:14:27] member but
[1:14:32] many you might admit that you're part of
[1:14:35] the
[1:14:36] body but you might not think that you're
[1:14:39] as important as other
[1:14:41] members the body of Christ is one whole
[1:14:45] unit and it is
[1:14:48] perfect it is perfect so you can't say
[1:14:53] that this member is more important than
[1:14:56] this
[1:14:56] member all of us have an equal role go
[1:15:00] back to Joshua what if they would have
[1:15:04] spoken like
[1:15:06] achen achen took a wedge of gold and a
[1:15:10] garment what if one member does that it
[1:15:13] ruins the whole thing it ruins the whole
[1:15:15] body every one of us has a gift to bring
[1:15:17] into the church and what the enemy does
[1:15:19] is the enemy tries to take that gift out
[1:15:21] of the
[1:15:22] church all of us have a gift and all of
[1:15:25] us are important and what the enemy does
[1:15:27] is he tries to tell you no you just sit
[1:15:29] back and do
[1:15:31] nothing just sit back and wait for the
[1:15:33] Lord to do something when in reality the
[1:15:36] Lord is waiting for you to do something
[1:15:39] and you know what's going to
[1:15:40] happen
[1:15:44] nothing we are those gifts that God
[1:15:50] places in the church look around you're
[1:15:53] surrounded by them
[1:15:56] and when they're doing nothing nothing
[1:15:59] is being
[1:16:01] done and as the Bible says here as the
[1:16:04] Apostle Paul is saying one's not
[1:16:05] important more important than the other
[1:16:09] one as we go into this
[1:16:14] 2025 we have to be acting in our role I
[1:16:17] don't care if you're hundred years
[1:16:20] old I don't care if you're 12 years old
[1:16:27] you have to be in your
[1:16:32] place verse number
[1:16:34] 18 but now hath God set in the members
[1:16:37] every one of them in the body as it have
[1:16:41] pleased
[1:16:44] him you're not placed in the body by the
[1:16:47] pastor you're not placed in the body by
[1:16:50] a deacon you're not placed in the body
[1:16:52] by a prophet you're not placed in the
[1:16:53] body by any of these things God has
[1:16:55] placed you here every one of
[1:16:59] us and he's given us a gift that is to
[1:17:02] be
[1:17:03] shared not to lift ourselves up brothers
[1:17:06] and sisters that's where many fail not
[1:17:10] to promote your own
[1:17:12] Ministry but to promote God and to be a
[1:17:16] help to the people that God has placed
[1:17:19] us here to serve verse number
[1:17:22] 27 now you are the body of Christ okay I
[1:17:25] think that's pretty
[1:17:27] plain who are you talking about Paul now
[1:17:30] ye are the body of
[1:17:32] Christ and individually members in
[1:17:35] particular new King James says now you
[1:17:37] are the body of Christ and members
[1:17:40] individually and God has set some in the
[1:17:42] church first apostles secondary prophets
[1:17:44] thirdly teachers after that Miracles
[1:17:47] then Gifts of healing helps governments
[1:17:49] diversities of tongues notice that
[1:17:53] Ephesians 4
[1:17:55] it says a five-fold Ministry Apostles
[1:17:58] and Prophets and evangelists and pastors
[1:18:01] and teachers here there's only three of
[1:18:04] them Apostles prophets and
[1:18:07] teachers it's showing that God is not
[1:18:10] trying to put us all in a
[1:18:13] box he's speaking on these are guiding
[1:18:17] principles brothers and sisters these
[1:18:19] are gifts that God places into the
[1:18:21] church and you don't have to fit into
[1:18:23] any role
[1:18:26] God has made you perfect for the work
[1:18:28] that you are to
[1:18:31] accomplish that is the point in all this
[1:18:34] we have to accomplish what God wants us
[1:18:36] to accomplish and he says here he's like
[1:18:38] he says okay you have you have these
[1:18:40] three preaches here but then you have
[1:18:43] after that
[1:18:45] Miracles Gifts of healing helps brother
[1:18:49] Jordan so eloquently says many times
[1:18:51] he's he he places himself right there
[1:18:54] and he says says I'm here to help he
[1:18:57] says I want to be that that one that
[1:18:58] helps people and he does I don't think
[1:19:02] there's many that can say that they do
[1:19:04] more for all of us than Jordan
[1:19:09] Peterson diversities of
[1:19:12] tongues diversity of tongues we always
[1:19:14] think of standing up and giving a
[1:19:15] prophecy in tongues that could mean
[1:19:17] helping with translation
[1:19:20] David it could
[1:19:22] mean using the gift that you have of
[1:19:25] being able to speak two languages and
[1:19:28] being able to apply that to the ministry
[1:19:30] it's whatever the Lord has placed you
[1:19:33] and he's not trying to fit us all in a
[1:19:34] single box are all
[1:19:36] Apostles are all prophets are all
[1:19:39] teachers are all workers of Miracles
[1:19:41] have all gifts of healing do all speak
[1:19:43] with tongues do all interpret but covet
[1:19:45] earnestly the best
[1:19:47] gifts and yet I will show unto you a
[1:19:49] more excellent
[1:19:51] way he's placing these gifts into the
[1:19:54] church and he's saying that these are
[1:19:55] for your your benefit these are gifts
[1:19:58] that I placed there they're to help you
[1:20:00] and here's how that they are distributed
[1:20:03] though I speak with tongues of men and
[1:20:05] angels and have not charity which is
[1:20:08] love and become a sounding brass and a
[1:20:11] tinkling symbol and though I have the
[1:20:12] gift of Prophecy and to understand all
[1:20:14] the Mysteries and all the knowledge this
[1:20:16] is this is just keep going this was
[1:20:18] right after chapter 12 this is chapter
[1:20:21] 13 and though I have the gift of
[1:20:23] Prophecy and understand all the
[1:20:25] Mysteries and all the knowledge and
[1:20:27] though I have all Faith so that I could
[1:20:29] remove mountains and have not charity I
[1:20:30] am
[1:20:32] nothing you could be the most gifted guy
[1:20:35] in the
[1:20:36] world and you are nothing without
[1:20:40] love and though I bestow all my goods to
[1:20:43] feed the poor and though I give my body
[1:20:45] to be burned and have not charity it
[1:20:47] profiteth me
[1:20:50] nothing all of brother Lono all of these
[1:20:53] things all of of these gifts that were
[1:20:57] given they are given in
[1:21:00] love if you come up to be prayed
[1:21:04] for we lay our hands on you and it's not
[1:21:08] done in love it's not
[1:21:10] right you enter into the S same
[1:21:13] suffering of that person if you're
[1:21:16] praying for your your son or your
[1:21:17] daughter or your brother or your sister
[1:21:19] and you're not doing it because you
[1:21:21] truly love that person you just want
[1:21:22] this person to be like you it doesn't
[1:21:25] it's of none
[1:21:26] effect but when that love of God really
[1:21:30] enters into the equation is when things
[1:21:34] really
[1:21:35] happen we can close the musicians can
[1:21:39] come let's go back to the Book of Joshua
[1:21:42] as we
[1:21:43] close the very end of the
[1:21:48] book they had gone through and they they
[1:21:50] they had had many successes they had had
[1:21:52] many failures they had conquered all the
[1:21:55] land and they were still fighting and
[1:21:57] Joshua was an old man and was ready for
[1:21:59] Joshua's time to
[1:22:02] leave
[1:22:03] Joshua brings the leaders together and
[1:22:07] he's giving his closing statements he's
[1:22:09] giving the end of his ministry and he
[1:22:12] wants the people to stand strong on what
[1:22:16] they've
[1:22:17] learned
[1:22:19] Joshua 24:14 says
[1:22:22] this now therefore
[1:22:25] fear the
[1:22:26] lord this is it this is the end of
[1:22:30] Joshua these are his closing
[1:22:32] statements now therefore fear the lord
[1:22:36] and serve him in sincerity and in
[1:22:39] truth and put away the gods which your
[1:22:41] fathers served on the other side of the
[1:22:43] flood remember when they walked across
[1:22:46] Jordan put away those gods that they
[1:22:49] served put away that nonsense that they
[1:22:51] had put away that fighting that that
[1:22:53] they con were were bickering and arguing
[1:22:56] and doing all those things put that
[1:22:58] stuff
[1:23:01] away and in Egypt and and and serve the
[1:23:06] Lord and if it seem evil to
[1:23:09] you to serve the Lord another
[1:23:12] translation says if it seems undesirable
[1:23:14] to you to serve the
[1:23:17] Lord choose this day whom you will
[1:23:22] serve whether the gods with your father
[1:23:25] served that were on the other side of
[1:23:27] the flood or the gods of the amorites in
[1:23:29] whose land you
[1:23:31] dwell but as for me in my house we will
[1:23:35] serve the
[1:23:36] Lord everybody quotes that that Ser that
[1:23:39] that scripture but do you know what it
[1:23:42] means choose this day whom you will
[1:23:45] serve you're going to serve
[1:23:48] somebody you're going to serve some
[1:23:51] God and he's saying now you choose you
[1:23:54] say you don't want to be a Christian you
[1:23:55] don't want to do this well choose who
[1:23:57] are you going to serve you going to
[1:23:59] serve the God of this world you going to
[1:24:02] serve your you're going to serve
[1:24:05] yourself you're going to serve
[1:24:08] sin he's saying you're going to serve
[1:24:12] something now you choose who you going
[1:24:14] to who you going to
[1:24:15] serve and then he says but as far as
[1:24:18] me and my
[1:24:20] house will serve God it's so easy to
[1:24:24] quote
[1:24:25] it but are we going to make that
[1:24:28] decision to truly serve God I go back to
[1:24:33] the commandments of Jesus are you truly
[1:24:36] going to pray for those that hate
[1:24:39] you are you truly going to surrender
[1:24:41] your
[1:24:42] desires Surrender Your lusts Surrender
[1:24:47] your
[1:24:49] life and make your body a Living
[1:24:52] Sacrifice to God are you truly going to
[1:24:55] do that are you truly going to go out
[1:24:57] and make disciples to Jesus Christ are
[1:25:01] we going to do that are you going to
[1:25:02] serve your career are you going to serve
[1:25:05] your school are you going to serve your
[1:25:07] friends are you going to serve your
[1:25:09] lusts what are you going to
[1:25:12] serve Joshua says choose this
[1:25:15] day you're going to serve somebody so
[1:25:19] now
[1:25:20] choose what are you going to
[1:25:22] do you going to make a change in 2025
[1:25:25] you're going to make a change right
[1:25:28] now I want a change in my
[1:25:32] life I want to be more more more
[1:25:35] dedicated to him I want to do more for
[1:25:37] him I want to pray more I want to read
[1:25:40] my Bible
[1:25:41] more I am not I am falling
[1:25:44] short Lord I'm not living up to this I
[1:25:48] want to be
[1:25:49] different I want to I want to go to
[1:25:52] battle
[1:25:54] I want to watch that Ark and I want to
[1:25:57] follow it everywhere it goes and not
[1:25:58] take my my eyes off of it when when the
[1:26:02] when the word says don't say a word I
[1:26:04] don't want to say a word when the word
[1:26:06] says speak I want to speak when the word
[1:26:09] says forgive I want to
[1:26:12] forgive I want to live for God I want to
[1:26:15] change in my life I want it different
[1:26:18] and then we can go along we can go over
[1:26:20] Jordan or anything else we can go out
[1:26:22] all the way into heaven
[1:26:25] but we need a
[1:26:27] change step by step and it doesn't all
[1:26:31] just happen at once you make a
[1:26:34] commitment if I'm going to lose 20
[1:26:36] pounds it ain't going to happen today
[1:26:39] but it can start
[1:26:41] today if I'm going to start reading my
[1:26:43] Bible if I'm going to dedicate an hour
[1:26:45] an hour a day to the Lord it starts
[1:26:49] today and then I'll make another step
[1:26:52] that'll be tomorrow and then I'll make
[1:26:54] another step and then step by step we
[1:26:57] will get through this life and every
[1:27:00] step that we take God has given to
[1:27:04] us and once you take some ground from
[1:27:07] the enemy hold it say
[1:27:11] no I took this Satan God has worked
[1:27:14] through me and given me the power to do
[1:27:17] it I'm holding on to it I'm not going
[1:27:19] back and if you go back get up pull that
[1:27:23] sword and and keep going forward stay
[1:27:26] with it for a set a goal just this
[1:27:31] week make steps just this week and then
[1:27:35] you'll see that next week will be easier
[1:27:38] and then the next week will be easier it
[1:27:39] might be studying it might be your
[1:27:43] grades might be prayer it should be
[1:27:46] prayer might be reading your Bible more
[1:27:49] might be doing something for someone
[1:27:50] else it might be helping out at the
[1:27:52] church it might be it could be anything
[1:27:55] but you have to do
[1:27:57] it I cannot stand when somebody is
[1:28:00] always just talking about it and nothing
[1:28:02] ever
[1:28:04] happens and that's the world
[1:28:06] today just talk about it talk about it
[1:28:09] talk about
[1:28:10] it but Joshua was like let's go come on
[1:28:15] let's go men women
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:22] children listen to
[1:28:26] this
[1:28:28] expectation
[1:28:30] 1954 and that thing is perhaps being
[1:28:33] done around the world tonight among
[1:28:34] Faithfully believing members of the body
[1:28:36] of Jesus Christ and Divine Healing
[1:28:38] doesn't lay within
[1:28:40] me and each of these Brethren sitting
[1:28:43] here your pastor you don't have to wait
[1:28:45] till they have a Divine Healing program
[1:28:47] to be
[1:28:49] healed every one of these men has got
[1:28:52] just the same Authority that I or any
[1:28:54] anyone else has got to pray for the sick
[1:28:57] is that message or is that not
[1:28:59] message and that's all we can do is pray
[1:29:02] for the
[1:29:03] sick and not only them but if they're
[1:29:06] off somewhere and can't get to you that
[1:29:09] good Holy Ghost filled
[1:29:12] sister or brother that lives next door
[1:29:16] to you has the same Authority that's
[1:29:18] right same thing if you can't get your
[1:29:20] pastor the Bible says if any sick among
[1:29:22] you call upon the Elders of the church
[1:29:24] and let them anoint with oil and pray
[1:29:26] over the sick the prayer of faith shall
[1:29:27] save the sick we just we're going
[1:29:29] through James right now he quoting
[1:29:33] James God shall raise them
[1:29:36] up not the
[1:29:39] minister God shall raise them up and if
[1:29:41] they did any sin it shall be forgiven
[1:29:43] them confess your faults one to another
[1:29:46] and pray one for another is that right
[1:29:49] one another be prayed for that you may
[1:29:51] be healed for the effectual fervent
[1:29:53] prayer of a righteous man aail of
[1:29:55] months again from James that's all you
[1:29:58] need be filled with God's spirit and
[1:30:01] you'd be surprised if you only knew the
[1:30:06] gifts that's setting right in this
[1:30:09] building
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:11] tonight I say the
[1:30:13] same if we just knew the gifts that were
[1:30:16] in just this
[1:30:19] building every person here is a gift and
[1:30:23] God has bestowed on every person a gift
[1:30:27] and if we just knew what was in this
[1:30:29] room what difference could we make what
[1:30:32] could we do for God if we would just
[1:30:35] realize that gift and be willing to
[1:30:38] follow the will of God willing to follow
[1:30:40] the word of
[1:30:43] God next quote says this and now we see
[1:30:46] in the Bible that Jesus
[1:30:49] Christ the son of God when he came to
[1:30:52] the Earth he came to rid sin and
[1:30:54] sickness divorce it put it away forever
[1:30:56] from from his
[1:30:58] people
[1:31:00] oh
[1:31:03] wow he came to rid sin and sickness and
[1:31:06] divorce it and put it away forever from
[1:31:07] his people and he claimed that he would
[1:31:10] return again but in his absence he gave
[1:31:15] his church the same Authority that he
[1:31:19] had think about this I'm going to ask
[1:31:21] you a question
[1:31:25] and I want you to raise your hand if you
[1:31:27] believe
[1:31:28] this he said this but in his absence he
[1:31:31] gave his church the same Authority that
[1:31:33] he had who here is part of that
[1:31:38] church then he gave you the same
[1:31:42] Authority that he had and that was
[1:31:44] proven at the day of Pentecost in the
[1:31:46] book of Acts it was
[1:31:48] proven and I believe it all the way down
[1:31:51] to this day
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:55] hear ye him Jesus
[1:31:59] said whatsoever whosoever sends you
[1:32:01] remit is
[1:32:03] remitted whatsoever you bind on Earth
[1:32:05] I'll bind in heaven whatsoever you loose
[1:32:07] on Earth I'll loose in heaven that's the
[1:32:09] power of God's Church Brethren we're
[1:32:12] short of
[1:32:13] that he was crying out this 19
[1:32:18] 1957 I believe we're more short now than
[1:32:21] back
[1:32:22] then Brethren we're short of that we say
[1:32:26] it was shame
[1:32:28] face we're short of that because the
[1:32:30] church has draw divisions and lines and
[1:32:34] so
[1:32:35] forth and accepted other
[1:32:38] things instead of staying with God's
[1:32:40] love and the Holy Spirit and the
[1:32:44] Bible God's love puts it
[1:32:47] first the holy spirit in the
[1:32:52] Bible I think those three things things
[1:32:54] pretty much round it all
[1:32:55] out think they pretty much cover
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:33:00] it 1 Corinthians 15:58 says
[1:33:04] this therefore my beloved Brethren I
[1:33:07] love this part of the Bible oh 1
[1:33:11] Corinthians 15:58 therefore my beloved
[1:33:13] Brethren be you steadfast and
[1:33:15] unmovable always abounding in the work
[1:33:19] of the
[1:33:20] Lord for as much as you know that your
[1:33:23] labor is not not in vain in the Lord how
[1:33:26] encouraging always abounding always
[1:33:29] doing the works of God and God placed a
[1:33:32] gift into your life you have no right to
[1:33:35] hide it you have no right to keep it you
[1:33:37] have to use it if you want to be in
[1:33:40] God's will every one of
[1:33:43] us and we are falling short as brother
[1:33:47] brandom said we are falling short if we
[1:33:50] are not using that
[1:33:52] gift Brothers and sisters this coming

[1:39:29] for another 40
[1:39:30] years walking around in circles where we
[1:39:33] can go step by step and take ground from
[1:39:39] the
