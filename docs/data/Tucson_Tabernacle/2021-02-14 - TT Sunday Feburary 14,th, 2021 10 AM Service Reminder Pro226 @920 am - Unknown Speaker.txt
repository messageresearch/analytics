word for your presence lord for god you're greater than all of our problems you're bigger than any situation you have the answer to any question lord i pray father that you would just come and meet us this morning lord and continue to move by your spirit we ask it in jesus christ's name and the church says and the church says amen god bless you amen certainly good to be here amen with you in the house of the lord god bless amen all of you that have gathered thank you for all the music brothers and sisters amen that was wonderful i really appreciated all of those specials my goodness who was that little bitty guy singing that song i heard it all the way back here and i had the the speakers down just a little bit low and i thought man my goodness i turned it up i'm so blessed by that amen i'm certainly glad to have my good friend friends brother travis sister deborah amen from buford there and and all of you uh how many were here when brother travis gave his testimony here amen quite a bit of you and uh it was just really really good if you don't if you don't if you didn't get a chance to hear that i think they got a recording of it it's just uh wonderful they've traveled here actually uh going to be with their family father-in-law sister deborah's father you know brother dale smith real well and they're going to be traveling from here to flagstaff to get to be with them for a few days amen so appreciated that special that they sing saying you love the lord this morning amen isn't god good amen i love the family of god we want to just say by way of announcement here tonight uh that for those of you that are gathered here i know there was maybe some an expectation on what we discussed two weeks ago for those of you that are part of the local body here i'm sure you were aware of that that there was concerning pastoring this church going forward and all the questions and things that surround that for where we're at at a year and it's hard to believe it's been a year but there was a lot of questions about that and so i wanted to say that the evening service tonight will be a special unique service uh to address that and to to speak about that and i have a lot of things upon my heart that i'd like to say and so i want to say that if if you are tonight's service will be different um and so if you are a regular tithe paying member of the tucson tabernacle then we want you to come this evening if you are not god bless you but we just ask you not to be in attendance tonight we won't be live streaming we will be recording that service for the local body and i know that there's some who aren't able to come and uh and be here physically for whatever need but they for ever reason but they are a normal church member here paying tithes and consider themselves a part of the the local body here i believe that's important i believe that a local body uh is sovereign that's what the prophet of god taught you believe that uh we're connected interconnected with uh you know this church is connected with nations all across the world and different ministries and and the body of christ is connected uh you know in different churches but there is a local governing body here a local group of believers here and my vision and my purpose of coming here is for this local body uh and so uh and so we just like to say that that if you are a uh a normal tithe paying member and you've been you you consider this to be your home church then you're welcome to be there we will make the phone hookup because it's uh password uh protected if you want to call it that um and so those that have that are considered to be members here we also will have a recording for those that are part of the body but not able to listen in on the phone hookup or be their present so we will make that available but tonight we'll be addressing that and and just how we want to go forward with that and so we look forward to that again not we may make another announcement on the whatsapp uh concerning the uh you know the format of that but that will be at regular service time tonight i'll just go ahead and say that if you're not a regular tithe payon member and you show up tonight you're going to be asked very nicely not to attend tonight um it'll just be just for the local body only is that okay you love the lord and uh and so we we may get visitors who didn't hear this announcement uh we had that two weeks ago and so we'll we'll take care of that as we see fit amen did you come to see the lord this morning amen if you have your bible turn to mark chapter 14 amen like to go to the word this morning just have something amen the lord has put upon my heart mark chapter 14 and i've only spoken this just once in another place one time and the lord just uh gave me this inspiration and i believe he has something amen for you this morning amen i just i want to say again that it's uh just a a great joy of mine just to serve the lord and i would just want to be his servant amen i want to be used of him so don't look to the who's here who's speaking who's around you and who's in the building here today i want you just to center in amen forget everything around you forget what happened last night this morning when you tried to get dressed and the devil interrupted your day forget about all of that forget about your lunch plans or whatever you got after amen the service and just say lord i just want to come into your tabernacle into your house you told me bring my needs to your altar so i'm bringing them lord and would you come and speak to me specifically i believe the lord jesus can do that mark chapter 14 and i'd like to just begin reading here we're just going to read a couple verses and then we'll parallel uh some of this and then uh move on uh through we'll come back to some of these scriptures i want you to begin i want to be begin reading here at verse 32 of mark chapter 14. i'd like to speak to you this morning on understanding your cup of pain understanding your cup of pain and they came to a place which was called gethsemane and he said unto his disciples sit ye here while i shall pray and he took with him peter james and john and begin to be sore amazed and to be very heavy and said unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death tara you hear and watch and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him and he said abba father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup for me nevertheless not what i will but what thou will and he cometh and findeth them sleeping said unto peter simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour imagine your last few friends when the whole world has rejected you and in your darkest moment when you've asked your closest confidants to pray with you only to find them asleep and he said unto them watch you verse 38 and pray lest you enter into temptation the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak and again he went away and prayed and spoke the same words and when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither was they what to answer them and he cometh the third time and said unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour has come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise up let us go he that betrayeth me is at hand lord jesus we just read these words lord and i can feel the nearness the closest lord of your presence how real it is lord to the redeemed that stand here today believing lord jesus that this moment that happened so many years ago lord as we read and reflect upon that hour lord when you were being served that cup of pain to where the bible says that you sweated blood lord and that you you came under such great pressure such great torment you said my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death lord how we reflect even in this late hour that we live in in this world lord it's uh this world is a world of pressure lord and we all as believers children lord our families live under this intense pressure of the lateness of this hour lord in your but your prophet preached a sermon how to let off the pressure so god i pray lord that this morning lord that your august presence your nearness your closeness would come lord and take your word for it's your word and break it unto your children lord so that they can find lord resource a resource lord to let off the pressure in life we pray father that you would be our helper be our speaker be the hearer lord of man all things you get the glory the honor and the praise in jesus name and the church said amen you can be seated this morning it's amazing the expectation as you read this and we don't have time just to cover the whole scene here but just for a moment we'd like to parallel the life of jesus the life of of elijah in the life of job and maybe a few others if the lord would allow us today it's amazing because this was such a dash to the expectation of the disciples who no doubt they believed and had created as we often do many times they had created their own they had created their own leader of what they thought jesus was and what jesus was coming to do and they had produced this in their mind that this great teacher this great leader this mighty redeemer and rescuer and he was that's exactly what jesus was but if we're not careful even in the world that we live in we can create our own gospel even the apostle paul warns at this and says that you would serve another jesus that jesus whom we've not preached and often times in our imagination we can create a christ of our imagination the world has created that a jesus who's just here to make us feel good uh one who's just here to bless us one who's just here to take care of us and watch over us and give us everything we ever want and it's amazing because really you could sum up modern american christianity just in that right there that jesus and the gospel of jesus is all just about how you feel and there's a lot of emphasis placed on fillings there's been new york times bestsellers written about it good books but another jesus and a false gospel uh one that one of our greatest uh churches even in our in our nation here joel osteen and has a pastor of the largest church and you know gatherings of 20 and 30 000 people filling stadiums and arenas i always think it's amazing because jesus didn't have those kind of crowds yet somehow joel osteen has those kind of crowds the gospel that jesus preached got him crucified and the gospel that joel osteen preached has given him the riches of the world what's must be a contradiction here happening wrote a book called your best life now your best life now you know there's only one way that this is my best life your best life and that is if you're going to hell i said there's only one way this is my best life and that is if i'm going to hell because surely this life is not my best life but my best life is the next life you believe that and it's amazing because they believe this is your best life that you get it now that you get everything here and this is almost in some way even the the way that the perception that they here was the the god's family after they had been after they had been persecuted yes after they had been uh hunted down and and the romans had had bullied them like a great bully would do and had oppressed them and and you imagine even for yourself if you put yourself there that here now you have this great leader and this great teacher and oh my you know it's almost like that big brother who's gonna come and beat up the bully who's been bullying you you know you feel this sense of retribution and and you know and you're you know i you got this great hero i i looked at my older brother that way and if you hear my older brother's story you would think he was a boxing legend and in my mind he is a boxing legend though he never uh went and professionally boxed because i had some some bullies in my life who uh let's just say that um he he uh he took care of those bullies and and it got him into a lot of trouble but i looked at i the way that i viewed him and looked at him as a big brother who would you know you get you get pushed on and picked on by boys that were older than me and uh and even older than him and and you know i just knew that all i had to do in that situation was just go to you know let my brother know because number one it wasn't i'm not so sure looking back that it was really about protecting me i think he just really liked to fight and uh and so any opportunity he could get you know to get in a good scrap jonathan was was up for it and he never lost a fight i think that the lord sort of uh directed his path in other ways intentionally because he was he's a real good fighter real good boxer had long reach and and i and i i look at this and i think it's amazing because it's very much how the disciples are viewing jesus that he's going to come there and he's going to deliver them from this oppressor and this great bullying now we got somebody and you want to mess with us you know and you you don't know who you're messing with and you don't know what's coming at you and even their questions you know what you're going to set up your kingdom and and you're going to set up your power and and and you know the the this who's going to be greatest in the kingdom and their vision and then vision and all these my all in their mind all of this mixed bag of emotion of oppression and you know oh we can't wait we're going to set up this kingdom and we're going to deal with these romans and we're going to be the leaders and we're going to be ruling with iron and they're going to be our servants and you know we're going to inflict the pain that they've inflicted on us that's amazing because they had created this this this jesus of their imagination this god who this christ who is just going to come in and destroy their enemy and what they didn't realize is that that's exactly what jesus was coming to do he was coming to inflict a fatal blow to their oppressor he was coming to inflict a fatal blow to their enemy the only problem is is that the enemy was not the romans the enemy was themselves because this age is very much like it was then it's all about self it's all about you it's it's expectations and false expectations thinking that he was coming to be this hero to destroy their bully and he was going to crush the higher class and that it suppressed them and he would set up their kingdom and they would no longer be poor what a letdown they had imagine this great superman and yes he was but they had mixed up who the real enemy was because the enemy was not the romans the enemy was their self that's why jesus says in mark 8 then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said if anyone would come after me if anyone would follow me he must deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it he says in another place you must count the cost before you want to come after me you've got to make sure you understand the cost make sure you understand what you're asking and i think that so often times that it becomes so i don't know and i'll have another word maybe it's going to sound wrong to say this but it becomes so cheap to say i want to be like jesus it becomes it's lost its value to say i want to be like the lord i want to be like jesus it almost can just become a cliche and i just want to live like jesus well just stop for a moment and and consider consider what it means when we say that consider what it means is jesus said can you can you go the way that i go can can you come the way that i came because you see the character of the lord and you see what the you see that you see the life and you say i want that but if you considered what it cost him to be him have you considered and that's what jesus is saying he's saying if you understood that in your life there's a love of of of your own humanity there's a love of what you want there's a love of of of of of your life and your desires but real christianity is about one thing and it's about a denial of self you know calvary that that's what the cross represented and we're post calvary and we see pictures of a cross and we imagine in our mind this great victory and it was but for us it represents when we look at calvary it's represented grace it represents redemption it represents salvation it represents all of these things that are good but do you understand what it meant for jesus do you understand that when jesus says if you want to come after me you must take up your cross and so cross in the days of the roman empire across was equivalent today of the execution chamber across was capital punishment lethal injection is equivalent to what we would call it today and when you have that graphic in your mind it suddenly dramatically changes how you view the cross because when jesus says if you come after me you must deny yourself pick up your electric chair and follow me because this is what it's going to cost it's going to cost your life you know the gospel is so less appealing when you preach it that way isn't it it's so less it's so less captivating and this just great thing that we just accept when jesus says in luke 9 23-24 he says then he said unto them if anyone would come after me he must deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will stay save it this is a picture of a man already condemned requires that he carry the beam of his own cross to his execution and jesus says in matthew 10 verse 38 anyone who does not take his cross and follow this is not what i'm preaching on today but the holy spirit just has me stopped and hovering over this just so just bear with me okay just for a moment anyone who doesn't take his own cross and follow me is not worthy of me and this is this is exactly what it means because many people interpret the cross as some burden that they must carry in their lives a strained relationship a thankless job a physical illness and i got to carry my cross i've got to bear this cross it's the cross that i that i have to bear and with self-pity and pride you know we can sometimes look at our own can we be honest here this morning we can with our own pride look at our own suffering human suffering and say well you know it's just the cross i have to carry but let me tell you when jesus said take up your cross and follow me it was a reference to capital punishment under roman law it was execution it was the denial of oneself and this is exactly why in gethsemane the prophet of god says something so amazing and he points to gethsemane in gethsemane as we've read as means the the the the pressing of olives the crushing of olives and and and brother branham says the real victory the real battle that's what he calls it he says the real battle and he preaches a message the greatest battle ever fought and he says the the great battle that was won wasn't on calvary the great battle the great victory wasn't when jesus was crucified and it's victory it was a great victory was the climax but he says the real battle took place in gethsemane and he says in the real victory that was won was won in gethsemane because the prophet of god said because it was in gethsemane when it wasn't his flesh or his body that was being questioned or crucified but it was his own humanity and his own human will and desire to live and he says the real battle took place we just read about it in mark 14 when jesus is saying if it's possible lord if it be possible let this cup pass for me and he says but nevertheless not my will but your will be done and the prophet says that's where the victory was won when he could conquer the battle of self so what was calvary when he was crucified the prophet of god said it was just the climax to that victory that had happened in gethsemane when jesus had won the battle over self it's no accident that he's crucified on a hill called golgotha which go read your bible and it says which in aramaic meaneth the place of the skull it's no accident because it spoke of the skull brother adam says where's the greatest battle being taken right now it's taking place in the skull the great gog the great calvary the great crucifixion you must deny yourself happens in an age of self-will and self-want and self-love and self-acceptance but real christianity is when you're able to say not me but you oh how many could identify and say lord i want to say that this morning not me but you lord not me but you lord in your purpose and your will not me but you lord not my will but your will lord and it's a cry that we all pray as we said we want to be like the lord i want to fulfill the purpose god has planned in my life but it's amazing because you look at jesus and you say what forces or pressure does god use to produce righteousness what forces or what pressures does he use as the prophet of god says your christian character christ-like character is not a gift that god gives you that you pray for and he just grants it to you and he said god can't even give you christian character that way he says because real christian character is not a gift that god gives you but it's a victory after a battle has taken place it's a success that you have coming through the torment and through the trial it produces godly christ-like character to build character but i asked what is the the desire we would say we desire to to to to live like jesus to be a man of god to be a woman uh to be a to be a family member a mother a father who intimates christ who reflects his character reflects his his godliness it reflects his love real christ-like love not worldly love and if you you you ask the question if you really want to no what is it brother matt what what is it to get that character how do i come to that place how do i possess that how do i obtain that and if you want to look at the process that god uses to produce godliness then look it no further than the garden of gethsemane look at jesus because he's our example he had spent his entire life and ministry everything in his ministry was about fulfilling the will of his father his entire life could be summed up by that it was a life that was sacrificed and laid out completely to fulfill the will of his father the purpose for three years for three years of his life and and mission everything had been headed straight towards calvary everything was climaxing and crescendoing his moment his pinnacle his his his final victory everything that was happening in his life his submission daily submission to the father and daily submission to the will of the one who had sent him was leading him on a path you see obedience has a path and obedience has a road and everything he was doing he was sowing the seeds of obedience he was sowing the seeds of submission and he said brother matt where was that road leading him it was leading him down the road to calvary how very different judas who his entire life and ministry had been sowing a seed of disobedience and it was leading him down a path of betrayal but jesus had spent his life who had lived for the purpose of his father yeah you can hear his words turn back their if you could in mark i'll just read it for you and if you have it you can put it on the screen you could hear his words when he comes to his disciples and he asks a question could you not watch with me one hour first forty could you not watch imagine the pressure that even they were under this renegade group they were under such immense pressure the bible says jesus says could you not pray could you not watch for one hour whatever torment whatever suffering whatever pain this humanity this human being this man was filling forced him the bible says to sweat drops of blood and to cry out and could cry from his own humanity and say oh god if it's at all possible deliver me i'd rather let this cup pass this is my human will i'd rather let it pass it's too great a burden for me to carry and and as job you're you you job was being in the same exact spot in his life when he's being served his cup of pain and job it cries out and he says in job 30 verse 19 he says he speaking of jehovah hath cast me into the mire mine eyes poureth out tears unto god in other words i'm in pain i'm in derision and i can't even see my way forward david said this when he was being served his cup of pain he said i made my couch a bed of tears and he says i water my couch daily with my tears and he says my eye is consumed because of grief because of pain because of suffering i believe that god is a healer i believe we can get a universal amen that i believe god is a healer and i believe in healing this is a powerful statement that a man wrote and pen he said i i believe in healing and i believe that we will have afflictions but i also believe in healing afflictions i also believe in affliction that produces healing david said before i was afflicted i went astray but now i have kept thy word physical pain can produce that in your life and if god has to do that as we've preached here many times before if god has to turn the screws in your life and it turns into physical suffering god will do that if it produces godly character you know how many times you've prayed in your own life and and the bible says in psalms i think it sums david speaks this in psalms 34 and says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord god delivereth them from them all that means that will we go through pain yes that's a guaranteed you will go through things that hurt things that as we preached here two weeks ago things that don't make sense things that you don't have answers to things that you can't rationalize humanly speaking and god promises to deliver us but it doesn't mean there's not pain i i feel just so tugged in my heart here just to pull over just for a moment and i i thought about this so vividly recently even talking me and brother brother nate uh dougal was just having a phone conversation and just speaking about this and it just so spoke to my heart as i was we were just fellowshipping and expressing and you know i thought it was so amazing when you look at the life of job and you you think you think to yourself you know why why i've understood the afflictions and i've looked at the life of job and we go through his entire story and even at the end of all of it and he asked the question what shall a man when a flower dies that comes back and the flower with the plant wither job says but if a man die shall he live again and the prophet of god says and you know you ask the question why you know lord why why why go through this what is the purpose for this what why did this happen why did why did why did it take place why did the things that were out of my control as many times in our own life take place and you know you ask that question even of job why did he why did he go through it you know and you look and you say i know what the answer is i know the human answers i know the answers that i can look to and say well you know job didn't see chapter one in chapter two he didn't see the conversation that the devil has with god and says that you know and basically there's a there's a challenge set forth and man just your children just serve you because of what you give them remove the hedge touch them and watch what happens and so job doesn't know his life is caught up in a mystery in another dimension and he's going through things i know that answer and and i know what the word says about that but i still after that ask the question humanly why why did why did a man like this who would shoot evil love god yet he goes through such torment in his life you as you say the same answer i know that it was it was it was uh for job it was so that us here in our life could go through pain and suffering and torment and we can look back at the life of job and see a man who god wrought righteousness in where he could say the lord god giveth and the lord god taketh away and you can answer that's why job went through suffering you could say you know the answer the prophet of god preaches the the the patience he speaks about the perseverance of job and says it was all so that man would ask a question what happens when a man dies you get all of those answers and you say they're they're satisfactory and they are answers that we believe but even in our own humanity we still ask the question and i'm not sure we know why i don't know that we have the answer all of the entirety of the answer as to why why did it happen why did it take place and i'm not sure on this side here's what i do know we will know what i do know is that we will know but i'm not going to pretend that i do know now and i think there's such a trap so many times in our mind because we have to know why why why why why i was reminded so much of a story and i don't think i've ever told this here before of a brother and it was fellowship with a brother here just a few weeks ago about this and he was just asking the same exact questions we look at suffering and say why did it happen why did he go through it why was what was the purpose and and we prayed and maybe you've had a need over a loved one i'll never forget you know the prayers that i prayed for you know one of my close friend of mine employee of mine who loved the lord with all of his heart loved his family loved life young didn't want to die gets cancer believe the lord is going to heal him of it believed with all of his heart shared with him as much as i possibly could yet he's gone yet he passes away and we search human humanly we search in lost and i know that's one of the hardest cases you could bring but i i know in our own life if if you was to map out your own personal life you have different spots that you can look back historically in your mind and go why but i don't understand why why did life take a left turn when i it should have kept straight why did it take a right turn there when it should have went left i don't understand that and i i was so encouraged hearing the testimony and i wish i could share it with you if it was uh if it was taped or recorded and it was but i wish i could play it for you don't have the time to do that now there's a lo a wonderful friend of mine brother steve burson pastor in quebec and kennedy came and preached a sermon called our origins and brother steve at a young age uh was his father had left him in his life and and and he was raised by his mother his whole life uh it was raised by his mother i forget the age i may get some of that detail wrong if this goes out and people hear it could stand correction on the age that he was when it happened but his father he began to relate how his father had left at an early age 12 or so years old and and and there was a lot of just a lot of a different thing that had took place in the family and the marriage and and they were from the the his father was from greece and they had migrated to quebec and uh just through different struggles in his life his father leaves and walks out on the family i mean completely walks out disappears goes back to greece and doesn't have any contact or communication with the son and now steve is raised by the for the rest of his life not ever knowing his father not ever not ever not ever uh be meeting you know getting to know him in any kind of uh quality way at all and now steve's life goes on he goes into come becau as a result of that goes and just lashes out into the world and and and just has a you know running from the lord gets in trouble with the law and and with the group of of other teenagers just as a rin it turns into a renegade completely runs the other direction from the lord and a lot of times some of the outbursts that we see in people's life is an outburst to the pain or the rejection or the suffering that they've went to and they lash out and they're lashing out at the world because of the suffering they went through in the end because of all the questions in his mind and he's raised without the influence of his father and he goes through his life and he and he's and he runs from the lord and his mother godly sister still to this day and is praying for him believing for him praying for him believing for him ministering to him still living with her with with his mother and his mother constantly ministering unto him and holding on to him and never letting go of him and always believing for him and always believing the best as i believe any godly mother will do and just holding on to faith and it was it's amazing because his life goes on and the lord finally at 18 19 20 i forget what age it was maybe later than that the lord gets a hold of him and just fills him with the holy spirit and does such a miraculous work in his life and answers the prayer to his mother and eventually becomes the pastor marries the the the pastor's daughter has a wonderful family becomes a pastor of a church and is a wonderful minister uh today with a beautiful family and you look at the carnage that could have been if the devil had his way but god makes all things beautiful in his own time in his own season and and you and he started to you know in his lifetime his children are older his son is 11 12 years old his older son william and his has four or five girls um and and he has a great family and and he starts to get the question in his mind you know whatever happened to my dad doesn't i don't know that he even knew if his dad was alive had no way to reach him if he had died dad just had walked out on him never had knew him and he starts to get that feeling of what you know where is he at what's he doing and so he searches him looks him finds him finds him you know modern technology today uh used for a good purpose and he's he's finds his father he's in greece and so he's somehow you know just to fast forward some of the story he somehow makes contact with him any any any and he begins to uh he he makes contact with him some you know and and finds out that he where he lives and so he he he he goes to a true on a trip by himself to greece and he meets his father and it's amazing because he he his his father is you know is opening arms and welcoming him and oh stephen and now there's this great restoration to their uh to their to their friendship and to their life and to their family and and and and out of all of this searching that steve had in his life he finally finds his father and and there's there's this great love and great joy and great acceptance and then he's he begins to share pictures of his children and his family and oh you have grandchildren and you have children who love you and and and you're a grandpa and his father's crying and and it's just a great you know weeping and rejoicing him and and then there's this bitterness that starts to set in steve's heart and he starts to say why lord i don't understand why why was i kept from this man there's a wonderful man could have been a grandfather to my children and why did you take him out of my life he was just ripped away and he starts to recount now he outwardly you know he's got a smile you would never know but anyway he's struggling with this and he's struggling saying why did it happen why did it take place i don't i don't understand and and and now his father his father tells him you have other brothers and in the pictures they look identical to him look just like him and he says you have other brothers but you're not going to meet them i don't want anyone to know my family here my wife here has no idea i've ever had another life and now there's that same acceptance and now that rejection the rejection is a hard thing he's rejected and says i don't you got to keep it a secret you're not allowed to reach out to them you can't say anything you've got to keep it airtight you don't i don't want this out but i love you and i accept you but they can't know and now the bitterness just intensifies just the carnage and the wreckage and oh lord how did this happen how's my life such a mess my family and don't know my father and he goes back to quebec and then he takes his family takes another trip takes his wife and all of his children and they meet their grandfather and i think they took one or two trips and steve's just testifying about just in his own heart that question that we've asked so many times why lord doesn't make any sense why this would happen in my life and then he he tells how that he goes back over to uh to come to to greece with his family and his father's there and his father's meeting his children and and he's you know and he's he's he's meeting his grandchildren for the first time and and he starts to tell his he starts to tell his grandson william who's the oldest who's about the same age that steve was when his dad had left and he starts to in this moment begins to say if i ever could tell you anything william you know if i could ever teach you anything in your life if i could ever give you anything from grandfather to you you know he says i want you to go home in him i want you to listen to frank sinatra as i did it my way and he says i want you to listen to that every day of your life now steve had remembered in his mind that i had preached a sermon at his church and spoke how that the author of the satanic bible when he was asked what is the most satanic song of our generation he said frank sinatra's i did it my way we've preached that here before all about self and all about i didn't let anybody tell me what to do i did it my way and he says he's you know here's his father now here's his father and he says and something just happens like he just had a out of body of experience and he says then something just happens and i'm watching in the living room everything's happening children over here wife of reason and everything just drops quiet and now everything was still happening but he said in my mind he said the holy spirit started dealing with me and i'm watching my dad tell my son you go home and you listen to this william and you make this your mantra and this is the code i've lived by and this is what i believe and you live this the rest of your life and you don't ever let anybody and he said and i was watching this man and he says and then i see myself there i am and i'm william and there's that man and here's his strong influence on my life and he said the holy spirit stopped me and spoke to me and says that's why i removed that man from your life because had i not that william your son would have been you and that would have been your tutor and your leader in life and you wouldn't have the family and the life that you have today because you would have been subjected to the leadership of this man so i had to make a hard decision and remove that man from your life to protect you from that influence and you know what happened all of that bitterness and all of that pain began to leave and you know what that was that was god by his grace and his mercy who steve who only had one half of the story god said i'm going to give you the other half of the story so many times i told that entire testimony to tell you that it doesn't the the the the for job we may not have the answer but here's what i know there's an answer for your life we may not have an answer but there's an answer that god knows let me just stop and say this to you today no matter where you've been or what you've been through of what you've lost god knows what you lost no matter who walked out of you in your life god knows who walked out of you in your life no matter what you didn't couldn't have because god wouldn't allow you he understands that and he's doing it working it all for his own purposes whether you ever get the other half of the story or not in this life david couldn't understand job couldn't understand that half of the story why naomi ruth orpah here's a man paralleled we know the great pattern of of the church and the israel and and and all of the types and the shadows but you imagine a woman like ruth or naomi who had lived with a man named elimelech who was her provider he was her her arm her her protector her shield he he was her husband the figure the man of her life and now there's a famine you go read the book of ruth the first few words say there was a famine in bethlehem judea and so now this great famine causes this man to leave to leave the promise of god to leave the land of god and the bible says that he leaves and he sojourns in the land of moab and he takes ruth and then you know and takes naomi and if you go and read this this entire story of the sadness of what happens now elimelech uh uh her her her daughters naomi's daughters mary uh boys here here was here's now she has son-in-law she has a husband and now they're all three every figure every man in her life that she loved dies one by one lemon-like then her son mayhellon chileon pass away and now she's left with two daughter-in-laws ruth the moabitis orpah and herself and everything in her life everything that she had ever known she had suddenly lost and you and and and no doubt naomi says it this way she says i left empty i left full and i've won and i'm empty i lost everything even in famine now she's lost i i was reading this today and and here in god's prophet he preaches the message kinsman redeemer and i thought what a what a loss that that she she goes through the the the the cup of pain that she served that god removes everything from her life and now she's saying i'm bitter and i'm filled with bitterness and so much pain i just stomp just for a moment to highlight her story because it ends so differently than how you start the book of ruth but it's amazing because i i i i looking through this i'd read a quote and it was just so powerful i just wanted to read it to you uh here today and i hope it's okay it's a it's a just a quotation from a book that a man had written was so powerful about these three women about ruth naomi and orpah and he's and he talks about how that these three women their commonality what what brought them together what they had in common was pain loss after they had lost their husbands and she had lost hers all three of them had lost all three of them had pain that did that made no sense whatsoever and they asked this question why well you know and and the the the it says pain is a strange company keeper it brings the oddest people together there is a secret fraternity listen close to this there is a secret fraternity that exists between people who have been in pain that is mind-boggling meaning the same exact type of loss it transcends the color of your skin when you have been through certain things that other people have been through you feel like you can relate you can take two people who have nothing in common but let them experience the same thing as a human being and there is an affinity and a bond that comes between those two people because they can relate to each other and enter in you remember brother branham says you could never enter in and pray for someone until you enter into their suffering he says when you want to pray for someone he says try to enter into how they feel and relate to how they feel enter into their suffering you can take two people have nothing in common but let them experience the same thing and there's affinity of bond between those two people you feel for other people who have been through those things because you can relate to them and he stops and he says i personally don't like to have a lot to do with people who have never been through pain it says i don't like i don't have a lot to do with people who have never been through pain or suffering it's nothing against them i hold nothing against them i just can't relate to them and i'm sure they will not be able to relate to me and he stops and he says because and this man had went through great suffering a great loss and he says because the parts of me the things that make up me the parts of me that i need to have fellowship in the parts of me that i need to be touched the parts of me that i need held in are tied up are bound up not in the successes of my life but they are tied up and bound up in the struggles of my life for god has done more through my struggles than in my successes and if you can look carefully at all of my success and all of my successes they are made out of the ingredients of my struggles and you could never know my successes until you understand my struggles because they are the pathway that led me to my successes god used that suffering god used that pain in her life to drive her out of that land so that there was a woman named ruth who could catch the eyes of a man named boaz and boaz could spread a skirt around a little moabite woman and could come through redemption because god knew that her line and her lineage would end up producing the lineage of jesus christ and so god orchestrated and manipulated her life all for one purpose and one divine reason whether they understood why they went through the pain that they went through i go back to this and it's amazing when you think about this struggle that you see when when when job says he says it's a uh or g g this is uh let me let me find this scripture in john 11. jesus said unto him and this is after jesus is going through this suffering in gethsemane and he says put away thy sword into thy sheaf this is john 18 11. he speaks to peter peter's trying to understand all this what's happening what's happening you know you're supposed to be the great hero you're going to set up your kingdom and now he's being arrested and now he's being taken and all of his expectation has been dashed and so the bible says peter pulls out his sword and he cuts the ear off to the roman soldier and jesus says put away put the put up thy sword into the sheaf the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it the cup which my father notice notice not the cup that the devil's serving me but the cup which my father you see when you can see whose hand it is that is serving you your trial it changes everything in your perspective when you can look at your problem or what you went through and you can change and realize the cup that my father is serving me then it changes your entire perspective and you can truly say by revelation as we saying my father knows what i need in everything i go through he knows what's best even when you don't see the purpose behind it you can drink that cup of pain because you can see your father serving it the loss and the confusion even that jesus feels in his own humanity let's pick it up in matthew 26 verse 38 not going to be much longer here this morning jesus says my soul is exceedingly sorrowful matthew 26 verse if you want to put it on the screen and those that are turning that's just fine he says my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death can you imagine the son of god saying this i'm exceedingly sorrowful but wait jesus didn't you know didn't you see all the plan didn't you see everything clearly then you understand that all of this was for redemption and salvation you're going to go to calvary it's going to be a great thing and there's going to be people who rejoice and celebrate in all of this but notice for a moment in his own humanity he says my soul is exceedingly sorrowful unto death it'd be prior to this he says a little while the world sees me but you he says a little while and you shall not see me because i go to my father yet even in this moment i love this so much because the prophet of god says he was one don't ever let anybody tell you that jesus was not a man and he says he was in every way a man and he says and don't ever let anybody tell you that he was not god because he was in every way god such a separation completely human a kinsmen redeemer could feel could be touched by the feelings of our infirmities because he knew what loneliness felt he knew what confusion was he knew what a what suffering that caused confusion and calls this this this feeling the sense of what's happened and what's taking place jesus knew what it was to go through that he knew his he knew also that there was he was under a he was under a a a a messiah mission he was under a prophetic anointing because prophets had prophesied this moment he knew all of that he knew it was all leading to this yet the hardest part of his life that he goes through is in the last half hour in gethsemane the last half hour i want to emphasize that to you this morning it's the last half hour of your pain that is the hardest to endure it is the last moment the last half hour of his life when he's the most confused the most pain before the light dawns before the victory it's that last moment in his life david says therefore is psalms 134 you don't need to you don't need to turn psalms 143 4 david says therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate peter faces the same exact confusion and he and so he gets so confused in the midst of all of the all of the the pressure that he's under that he curses and denies that he even knows the lord you say how did he get to that place because in his own humanity he gets so confused what's happening why is this happening here's the lord and now he's been rejected and now he's arrested this is not the script this is not how it was supposed to be this is not the ending of the story that i had planned this is not my expectation this is not the way it was supposed to go we were supposed to end it this way isn't that often time our struggle is when we try to match what our reality that we have in our own life and our own expectation and then we realize the lord says but oh but i've planned this am i preaching anybody here this morning job says in his dark hour of confusion he says lo he goes by me and i see him not he passeth on also but i perceive him not he goes i don't see him he passes by i can't perceive him i don't understand why is this happening why do i have to face this is it something i've done and and and so many times we could say lord i've not cheated anybody i've not done anything wrong i'm not i'm not living dishonestly why should i wh why why can't i get clear why can i get a clear word from my heavenly father why can't i get an answer let me say this that even the greatest the greatest sages the greatest men of god the greatest patriarchs the greatest anointed men the faith chapter of hebrews is made up of some of the greatest men who asked some of the greatest questions that they couldn't get answers to and they asked the same it had the same exact confusion in their life of why must it happen why some of the greatest men have not heard clearly even the most humble most profound even god's prophet asks the same exact question why and elijah brother branham says this in elijah under the juniper tree you can throw that slide up if you want brother on that on the screen there listen to what god's prophet says he says there he laid this is the prophet of god speaking about elijah just look this way just for a moment before you look there brother adam preaches this message what doest thou hear elijah and he's preaching about elijah under the juniper tree after he's had this great victory on mount carmel and and he's and this great victory of rain comes to the land and and all the prophecy and the words of the servant i see a cloud like a man's hand and all of this victory in celebration now elijah finds himself under the juniper tree ready to end his life ready to commit suicide rather just for god to take him off the earth and brother adam starts preaching he says there he laid under the juniper tree he didn't know what to do his nerves was broken he was shaking he was he says he was crying no doubt can you see that okay there in the back everybody can see that he says he was crying no doubt he was in a terrible condition and he says this many of us hit those places you know when i heard brother adam say that my heart immediately just tuned right in he says many of us hit those places especially after a mount carmel experience it was asked of me the other day by someone about that how what what would we do what can be done what can be done for us at that time prophet gives such a simple answer there's only one thing to do commit yourself to god commit yourself to god i've had those feelings after i come out of a meeting you could scroll to the next one it looked like i tried and preached and begged persuaded seen the angel of god sweep through a meeting do signs and wonders sit in a car on the outside and hear them cry brother brandon tells us another place he preached had a powerful outpouring of the spirit had seen god move and he says he leaves the meeting goes by a car and hears people snickering and laughing at the service brother man says go buy a car and on the outside and hear them say there's nothing but psychology there's nothing to that that's on nonsense oh and then i cried crawled under the juniper tree i think lord what'd you do why'd you let me do it what what what can be done but we all hit those experiences i raised my hands today i identify we all hit those experiences but the mercy of jehovah to his servant god knows your trials i want you to focus in here this morning there's someone here this morning you say this message is directly to my heart brother matt this morning and i want you just to zero in for a moment and listen to the words of our elijah god knows your trials just know this he knows all about it sometimes you feel like as i did one time put a pistol against my head to commit suicide but i couldn't do it you can scroll down he says sometimes you feel like as i did one time i put a pistol against my head to commit suicide but i couldn't do it i took my glove off to lay it on a high voltage line where i was working but i couldn't do it something something some thing something still held one of the in my life wanted to end in suicide put a pistol to my head in my humanity just like jesus lord if it's possible let it pass like job i don't understand like david i'm exceedingly sorrowful even my my my eyes is consumed because of grief and brother adam says i put a pistol to my head put my hand on a high voltage line and he says but i couldn't do it something still held the same god that was with elijah that same god today seen me under my juniper tree my wife baby laying yonder in the grave my daddy my brother and all i was just about going myself i'm laid under the juniper tree it's hard and i got to a place i was so beside myself i tried to make a gun shoot my brains out and it wouldn't do it see there's work yet to be done something has to be done god wasn't finished and then he just stops and he says he'll always take care of you i'm so glad that in the midst of all the bitterness and suffering and all the confusion the prophet just injects that for me and for you i say today hold on to that grab ahold of them he always takes care of you he sees you in your lowest moment he sees when no one else understands and you put on a shell and a smile on the outside but there's inward turmoil just know jehovah sees and he understands and he'll always take care of you always take care of you brother adam begins to relate so much to elijah and he says poor tired weary servant he saw him he knowed where he was he knows where you're at tonight you may be under a juniper tree and everything's gone but remember he knows where you're at can you let the holy spirit just minister that to you here this morning let the voice of the lord speak to you don't look to a man or what i've preached and brother matt why are you preaching this just let the holy spirit you know sometimes we gotta we gotta let the lord have his way just for a moment let the holy spirit drop that into your heart and let him speak to you he knows where you're at sister he knows where you're at brother he'll always take care of you he'll never let you go he always understands and here's where you can rest and here's where you can place your assurance he sees it he understands it he knows all about it brother sister i've been back in the cave long enough and you have two he says there's been a lot of earthquakes shaking around paul's that just for a moment brother adam begins to relate this story and he says that there i was and we've we've told this you've heard it so many times before and and he says there was my baby and little sharon rose and he says and lordy buried my wife and he's going through all the agony and all the torment and you know you ever stopped and watched brother branham as he begins to talk about that and even if you listen to it i believe it's so important it's good to read a book it's better to play a tape it's good to read a book it's better to play a tape and listen to what he said you you could hear so much more i read and listen and brother baron begins you can hear in his voices he even for himself past this moment has already gotten a victory he's already moved on yeah when he begins to talk about this his voice begins to tremble and his own humanity he's reminded and all of all of the all of the the the the lingering because pain lingers and all of the lingering sorrow starts to come up and and he starts to come out of his his heart he begins as he says he begins to speak about this and brother branham you could hear him on that tape what doest thou hear elijah and he's so relating even to this moment he says i was there i was he said lay in under my own juniper tree and he says just didn't know what to do and he says god had already taken my wife and now my baby and he says and the the the the devil begins to come to me and he begins to say look at you look at your life and you've given up everything for the lord and everybody who you used to be your friends have now turned away from you and rejected you and brother and begins to just relate everything the devil was trying to tell him and whisper and lie and speak you think you're the only one the devil talks to you think the devil you're the only one who who's feeling thoughts of you think you're the only one you think you're the only one who has thoughts sometimes of just just walking away and said i give up and i can't even go on and i don't know what to do with my life and i just want to end i just want to end it just to get out of here that's too hard it's too great a thing to bear you think you're the only one let me tell you something friends satan is busy and he's busy whispering he's busy speaking and he's always trying to discourage and rob you of your faith and brother madam says he begin to whisper and say oh look at you and look at your life and he says and then you've watched god he'll be he'll heal others and raise the dead in your meetings and he says but when it comes to your own baby prophet of god said i begin to come to that place and he says and i said lord and he's praying there in the room and he says oh god don't take her lord anything but my baby lord anything god he says but he says and there was a black sheet that just dropped and he said as if to say shut up now i know that's not a popular part of that life story but it's what the prophet of god said he says if the holy spirit just was saying shut up i don't even want to hear you and you imagine the rejection and the feeling in his heart and you say well you know that was god's prophet and he had been so deep in the woods with the lord so many times and just had such a experience you know surely you know god's prophet would have never walked away from the lord he would no matter what he ever went through surely you know maybe me maybe you brother but even you know but brother branham would have never well let me tell you what brother branham says before you make him more than a human being let me tell you what god's prophet says god's prophet says and i was going to say if you won't heal my baby i won't serve you i know we'd like to create this portrait in this image of you know at that moment you know brother branham just started to say it but then oh no i can't i won't go that far and i'm not going to step over that is no no no no no no hold on it'll do you better trust me it'll do you a lot more good understanding the humanity of a man like the prophet who god can use it'll do you a lot more good than trying to lift him up into fantasy and unreality let me give you the reality of here for a moment he was ready to throw in the towel and said if you won't heal my baby i won't serve you and brother branham tells us in three different places he said that's the way i would have gone that's what i had would have said if william branham would have been in control in that moment how would he have responded to that type of pain he said i would have told him if you won't heal my baby i won't even serve you and brother burnham says but when i went to go speak those words when the thought entered my mind and i put breath in my lungs and began to speak them if you won't heal my baby then i won't and he said but then something happened something happened you know he does that same exact thing with the bull you remember the bull that was going to kill him and the prophet of god says i i reached for my pistol and he says and it wasn't there he we we create these stories sometimes and we forget what the prophet of god said oh brother benjamin that bull he just spoke to that he created atmosphere but remember his first human reaction was to grab a pistol and shoot it and he says the same exact thing he says i went from a pistol he wasn't there and he said then something happened a love dropped in my heart it wasn't it wasn't the love of of the prophet it was the love of god and he says and i said oh mr bull i'm so sorry he says i'm so sorry i've invaded your space and here i've came up and and he says oh perfect love took over in that moment but i want you to understand here this morning that was something outside it was something not here on the outside it was something on the inside that created the right atmosphere that got brother branham into a state of perfect love and he says and when i was just about to speak that he said something deep something down something weighed down in my soul as if he didn't know it was even there he said something at that moment at the midst of my my greatest weakness something grabbed a hold of me and he says and i just stopped and he said you shipment you sailors you know about that and he says you remember he says when you were out there and he says and you were on the seas and he says and your boat got out of control he even starts to relate this story and brother vernon says you your boat got out of control and he says and you didn't know what to do he said you were going to be destroyed by the billows and the waves are going to going to knock you over and we're going to capsize your boat and he says but you sailors he says what do you do he says you take a hold of that anchor and he says and you drop that anchor and he says and when you drop that anchor there's the blackness of the ocean it says you can't see what's down there you don't know he says but you let that anchor go and he says and you don't know what's underneath there but you believe down there in your heart there's a faith in your heart that says though i can't see what's down there i believe there's a rock at the bottom of the ocean and i believe that that anchor is going to catch a hold of that rock and that anchor when i can't hold myself and when my boat's about to capsize he says i have faith that that anchor will hold me in the time of my greatest battle and my greatest storm oh and the prophet of god stops and he says and friend whether you realize this or not when you came to christ you dropped your anchor and he says and whether you realize now he's relating that story to himself and he says i was about to give up and he says but something whether you realized it or not when you came to christ you dropped your anchor and he says and your anchor is not held by your emotions your anchor what holds you in church after trial what holds you so that you can lift your hands and say lord though you slay me yet i'll serve you he says that's not you that's something outside of you that's because you dropped your anchor in christ and he says and that anchor will hold you when you can't hold yourself when you're ready to give up and turn it all loose and walk away he said just trust that anchor that in that moment when you don't even believe you have it within yourself he said something grab the hold of me and i said blessed the lord god give it and the lord taketh the way blessed be the name of the lord he didn't say that of himself that was because he had dropped his anchor and that anchor had been coiled like it's coiled in a boat and you got the chain that wraps all up and wraps and makes that round there on the bottom as it begins to drop to the bottom of the ocean it begins to uncoil itself and uncoil itself and no doubt when the devil was coming to the prophet of god look at you look at what you've done and brother branham says everything he said was true you know sometimes what the devil says to you has some validity to it and he says everything that you that he said was true and he says that that anchor that he held no doubt no doubt as the devil began to pour it on him ever had the devil just pour it on you in your mind come on somebody raise your hand you ever had the devil just torment you and it's like when it comes it's just blow after blow and man when it rains it pours and when he begins to just pour it on you and pour it on you and look at you you've you've given up everything you've turned away and everyone thinks you know that you're a you're a crack you know what's happening that anchor was letting itself go and everyone's rejected you and and everywhere ever no one thinks that everyone's thanks you've lost your mind brother man says yes that's right yes that's right yes yes you're right that's exactly the truth and he says but in that moment when i was about to walk away you know what happened that anchor reached its length hallelujah and that anchor reached its length and he said something grabbed a hold of me oh hallelujah i want to tell you this morning i want to preach this to you this morning whether you realize it or not my brother my sister put your faith in jesus christ put your faith in your anchor what you've committed unto god that faith will hold you in your darkest moment in your greatest hour of of of of affliction and your greatest suffering of pain there's an anchor that holds paul says we have an anchor and he says and it's anchored behind the veil you know what's behind the veil because you can't see it god doesn't let you you can't see it but here's what you know i dropped my anchor and i want to say this morning to the lord lord i dropped my anchor i put my faith in you oh can you say that by an uplifted hand say lord i'm trusting in you and you only i dropped my anchor i put my faith in jesus i'm sold out i've let go of everything lord i i'm trusting in you holy and completely to hold me to carry me through lord in that moment when i have my cup of pain and that hour of isolation in that moment when it doesn't when there's no relief jesus felt that as we close jesus felt that feeling of isolation he felt that feeling that he was alone here here he is his entire life his entire life and everything was being controlled by a someone that jesus says i do all that which the father has chose me and yet in this moment he's so isolated that he prays and he says my god my god why has thou forsaken me what words why is thou forsaken me job said the same thing you became cruel why have you let go david said i'm forgotten we've preached that here before how long will you forget me oh lord i'm forgotten as a dead man out of my mind even david prayed those same words in psalms 22 my god why has thou forsaken why are you so far from me he said brother matt is it possible that god really hides his face from those he loves is it possible that he lifts his hand for a short while just for a moment to teach us total dependence and total trust the bible says in second chronicles it says god left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart he says in isaiah 54 in a little wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment you know where job's confidence rested and laid he comes to a place in job 23. last scripture we'll have you put up brother brother jeremy in job 23 verse 10. and he comes to a place in his life when he says i can't see him i try to perceive him he goes by and i perceive him not and job just stops and job says but then what's your assurance job here's my assurance but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold you know why this brought consolation to job because job could say on one hand maybe i can't see the lord but here's where i have confidence he can see me and maybe i can't see the lord's hand and all of this and maybe i can't perceive him but here's where i'm going to draw strength whether i see him or not he sees me he knoweth the way that i take could you bow your heads here this morning every head bowed please every eye closed the more that you feel a desire just play something softly if you could i want to tell you this morning the more that you feel a desire to serve the lord and i know there's a burning desire i believe i've preached preaching to people who could say even by an uplifted hand to say lord i've got a burning desire that you use me i've got to be burned burning desire to be more like you i've got to burn and desire to to live for you to serve you to reflect your character and reflect your glory let me tell you something friend the stronger and the more you feel that desire the more the enemy will be will set himself against you the more he the more he comes at you the harder he comes in so much that jesus could say god i i take this cup of pain david says oh that i had wings like a dove for then i would fly away and be at rest and maybe you are here today this morning and you're in that flood right now and you say oh i feel the pressure of the enemy i feel his his his hiss as brother random calls and i feel him trying to whisper to me and trying to lie to me and i've been susceptible to that voice of reasoning maybe that's you here today maybe not this morning but maybe in times in your weakest moment when the devil begins to tell you and you begin to reason and you have that moment of weakness you know what jesus prayed for peter p jesus didn't say oh peter the devil's going to come after you and he's going to he's going gonna he wants the desire to sift you like wheat you know you'd think that jesus would would say but i'm gonna rebuke him and i'm gonna keep him off of you and i'm gonna pull him off of you i'm gonna take him out of your life i'm gonna i'm gonna remove him no jesus says no i'm gonna allow it to happen but i'm going to pray this for you peter i'm going to pray that through it all your faith won't fail and let me tell you what the holy spirit is saying today you're going to go through torment you're going to go through a cup of pain i'm using it to bring a character out of your life but don't fear i've prayed for you that your faith won't fail that your faith will stay strong let me tell you my brother my sister god does his best work in you when he is changing you and whatever way that comes let me just say learn to live and to rest in him to be sealed with him in heavenly places in christ jesus remember you are the object of his love and his affection and as a child of god as a as a daughter of the king as a son of god as a son and daughter of the king let me just say this to you he knows best your father knows what you need he's gently leading your hand through it all and as job you could say by an uplifted hand i know the way that he knows the way that i take and i know that when he hath tried me and when it's worked its perfect work in my life i shall come forth as pure gold whether you ever get the other side of that story in this life just know this he knows all about it oh hear the words of god's prophet today he knows where you're at he knows all about it he'll always take care of you he'll always carry you through it yeah it may be painful yet may hurt you but he'll always carry you through it his grace will be sufficient through it lord jesus this is what you turned me around and placed upon my heart i know lord your word is spoken in a deep way lord to hearts this morning may we be still enough that's a hard thing to do it's a hard thing for us to do we run to and fro it's a hard thing sometimes just to be still just for a moment may lord jesus we be still enough just for a moment to be able to hear that still small voice your prophet says oh i've been back in the cave long enough to know and you have two there's been a lot of earthquakes shaking around a lot of noise a lot of fusses and stews big meetings he says but that's the reason what i said this morning there's got to come something deeper than a healing service there's got to come something deeper than a gift to speak with tongues there's got to be something deeper than a rushing mighty wind the wind went forth but god wasn't in it but let's get that still small voice oh i raised my hands here this morning and i say lord give me to that place in my own life move me beyond the emotion external emotions let me get to that something that puts the cream in my life that's something that though you speak with tongues of men and angels and have not you're nothing though you can prophesy and speak with tongues and show signs and wonders and work miracles and do great signs but if that still little still small voice isn't there you're nothing says the scripture that's what we're listening for now we've had the thunder we've had the fire we've had the rushing winds and the earthquakes but god send us that still small voice that's what we need i raise hands with many people today and i say yes lord that's what we need in our life that's what we need more than ever before is that still small voice that voice of leadership that voice from our heavenly father that says you can make it child i got this i got you i got it all in control i'm holding you i've not forgotten you i've not forsaken you just keep walking just keep on moving don't stop don't slow down keep going forward don't let nothing hinder you don't be distracted by anything the devil's trying to say don't hear his voice in the middle of your storm but hear my voice hear my spirit feel my presence i'm i'm trying to work something out inside of you you just got to trust me could you stand to your feet with the hand raised and say lord i trust you lord i i submit to you oh god bless those hands up all over the building lord in whatever craft whatever work whatever change you're trying to bring forth in my life jesus whatever it is lord jesus i surrender i submit now with hands raised with my voice i praise you lord i surrender just now oh god fresh one more time in my own life maybe you've never done it before just raise hands and say lord i surrender i'm giving up this is a sign of surrender i'm giving it over to you lord lord jesus may your healing work only you lord that can bring that may you do it just now lord jesus we trust you we submit to you we surrender to you lord we surrender to your will to your purpose to your plan yes lord move lord in the deepest place of that heart today oh god hands up everywhere lord people with the desire down inside their heart but i just want to wait just for a moment lord for i know that you're moving through these aisles and through these seats you're reaching out and grabbing hands today lord you're reaching out and bringing a bomb in gilead to sooth over to bring healing lord you're trying to open blind eyes you're trying to unlock deaf ears you're trying lord may we surrender to that just in this moment right now lord jesus that healing that you've waited for and you've wanted that healing that you've asked for for the lord maybe if it is that pain maybe that pain inside for loss or for sorrow whatever it is the lord jesus is trying to trying to take it right now will you give it to him will you surrender that over to him say lord do your work right now in my heart i open it up to you lord jesus i open up my heart my spirit's open lord jesus let the veil drop behind me let me forget about what's everything around me let me just focus in on what you're trying to do in my life let me surrender to it let me stop just for a moment let you do your perfect work jesus granted lord as you move upon hearts i'm just your servant lord i'll wait and tarry just here for a moment someone here that needs to come to this altar we invite you to come right now if you need that at your seat and you just want to just want to stay right there but you want to surrender to the holy spirit do that right now that's the lord's here right now friend lord's here in a special way his presence is near right now he doesn't always he always visits us but sometimes he just wants to do something specific for one or two or maybe three or maybe four let him do that right now let him do that right now and whether you have the other side of your story and you've allowed bitterness in your heart and pain to come in and and change and determine how you view the lord in your relationship let the lord take that right now just let him let him heal you you gotta you gotta be willing you got to open yourself up you got to be willing to let go of bitterness you got to be lit willing to let go of complexes you got to be willing to let go of those things i can't do it for you your mother your father your husband your wife they can't do that for you you got to be god gave you free moral agency he allowed you that ability to say lord today i'm going to let go i'm releasing it jesus you said take your burdens to the lord and leave it there and i'm doing it right now lord i'm dropping it off i don't want that upon me and affecting me in my life anymore i'm letting that baggage go because i can because no one can can force me to do it but i'm freely giving it to you right now jesus granted lord to those that have come lord i pray father you'd heal in a way only that you can lord in the dimension that only you can my words can penetrate to the emotions and they could affect but lord now that that door's open now you've you've got to take a vessel who's willing and say lord i'm giving it to you right now jesus maybe years and years and years of abuse and years of misunderstanding mirrors have come years of complex years of of holding on to that but lord now i'm releasing it i'm releasing it now to you god the holy spirit's doing that right now friend let him wash over your soul let him wash over your your mind let him wash that memory let him wash that path you say how do i want to go forward you got to let go here i want to move on you got to let go here god's saying you're not going to make it you're not going to go any further until we stop right here till you let it go child let it go child yes lord yes jesus fill in your presence lord i raise my hands i worship you right now lord letting go lord it's not about human ability or what man can do it's about what you can do by your spirit because we create the right atmosphere lord and in that atmosphere now you can come down you can drop down lord in that seat here today you can do a supernatural work you can do what a psychiatrist can't do you could do what a doctor can't do you could do what prescription pills try to do but they can never get to the real root and the real source but you jesus can move beyond when doctors can't when pills can't when when temporary satisfaction when sin can't fulfill lord you can come and feel that heart and fulfill that that that that emptiness you could feel that void in the life of that young person the life of that old person that mother that father right now you could drop in oh friends if you just let him if you just let go just for a moment and surrender and let jesus come in he could do a work yes lord lord i
