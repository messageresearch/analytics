[16:54] on Wednesday what had happen with me
[16:58] driving down down the the
[16:59] highway and I know sometimes it I wanted
[17:03] to go as fast as them let's just be
[17:05] honest about it traffic was flying down
[17:07] the road something just said no you do
[17:10] your you do the speed
[17:11] limit and but there was also part of me
[17:14] and said haha kind of looking at them
[17:16] going boy you guys are disobeying the
[17:18] law but when that accident happened then
[17:21] I just understood why something
[17:24] cautioned me because I was right behind
[17:26] that truck and and I would have gone I
[17:29] would have he just ended up sideways
[17:31] right in front of me but God watches
[17:33] over so how many know that God is
[17:36] watches and and you commit yourself to
[17:39] him saying Lord you know in the morning
[17:41] when you wake up and you start your day
[17:42] Lord I commit this day to you I commit
[17:45] myself to you and you watch over me so
[17:48] we remember that and thank you
[17:54] godess good
[17:57] morning everybody's awake
[18:01] now it's such a privilege that we have
[18:04] sometimes we don't recognize the power
[18:06] of prayer the privilege that we have
[18:08] that we can approach the creator of the
[18:11] universe and he and that incredible
[18:15] force and power cares enough about each
[18:18] of us to listen to each of our needs no
[18:20] matter how great or how small because he
[18:23] loves us so much that he set he came in
[18:28] the form of a man he didn't send
[18:30] somebody else he came in the form of a
[18:33] man he experienced what we experience
[18:37] and then he sacrificed himself to pay
[18:41] the debt so that we could come into His
[18:44] presence as we are this morning to come
[18:46] into that holy of holies behind that
[18:48] inner Veil and approach him so let's

[35:52] is a Jesus Christ that we can call

[36:27] Christ's name
[36:30] amen while I while I have everyone
[36:33] standing let's U let's read in our
[36:37] scriptures
[36:40] Hebrews chapter
[36:44] 12 it's one of one of the scriptures I I
[36:47] just love so
[36:55] much I just love reading and it's it's
[36:58] always encouraging to me Hebrews
[37:01] 12:1 reads like this it
[37:03] says wherefore seeing we also are
[37:06] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[37:09] witness now Hebrews chapter 12 obviously
[37:12] is right after Hebrews chapter 11 but
[37:14] HEB Hebrews chapter 11 it talks about
[37:16] all these great hero Heroes of
[37:18] Faith so he's referring back to that
[37:21] saying that we are surrounded with such
[37:25] such a great cloud of witness let us lay
[37:29] aside every weight and the sin which do
[37:32] easily so easily beset us and let us run
[37:35] with patience the race that is set
[37:37] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[37:41] and the finisher of our faith who for
[37:44] the joy that was set before him endured
[37:47] the cross despising the
[37:50] shame and is set down at the right hand
[37:54] of the Throne of God again looking unto
[37:58] Jesus the author of these things you can
[38:00] take your
[38:06] seats I want to talk this
[38:09] morning about setting our eyes on Jesus
[38:15] and following the blueprint that he has
[38:17] he has laid before us in our
[38:19] lives
[38:22] um before I before I get into into my
[38:26] sermon this morning a question came in
[38:29] yesterday and uh I would like to address
[38:32] that
[38:34] question
[38:36] um and it's from The Book of
[38:40] Revelation
[38:42] and
[38:44] it's
[38:49] about these Messengers that were to come
[38:53] in Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter 3
[38:57] three I I don't want to mention who gave
[38:59] me the question um because the the video
[39:02] and and who's watching I don't want to
[39:05] um
[39:06] maybe put a friend or some something in
[39:09] in a bad spot so I won't mention mention
[39:12] your name but the um the question came
[39:15] in and it was a very very very good
[39:18] question and it was about these
[39:22] Messengers that were to come in
[39:24] Revelation Chapter 2 and chapter 3 three
[39:27] and I'd like to just read if we could
[39:31] Revelation chap
[39:33] 2 and let's start with verse one it says
[39:37] this now now watch who IT addresses it
[39:40] says unto the angel of the Church of
[39:43] Ephesus it's addressed to an angel it's
[39:48] addressed to a messenger that was to
[39:51] come to this church now we believe and
[39:55] most scholars believe believe that this
[39:57] Revelation 2 and Revelation 3 are
[40:00] periods of time it doesn't say Church
[40:03] ages but it's pretty obvious that these
[40:06] are ages that are to come from Jesus up
[40:10] until
[40:11] now and unto the angel of the Church of
[40:14] Ephesus these things saith he that
[40:17] holdeth the Seven Stars in his right
[40:20] hand who walketh in the midst of the
[40:23] seven candlesticks seven golden
[40:26] candlesticks now it's saying that who is
[40:29] talking here notice it's in red this
[40:31] person that's talking is the Lord Jesus
[40:35] and he is speaking to this angel or
[40:40] messenger that this man is going to come
[40:43] and deliver this message to this
[40:47] Ephesian age or to this Ephesian church
[40:50] are we together I know it might be um
[40:53] review for most of us but it's a very
[40:56] very important thing so we go through
[40:59] and if you go through Revelation Chapter
[41:01] 2 and chapter 3 it says and unto the
[41:06] angel of the Church of smia and to Angel
[41:10] of the Church of thyra and to pergamos
[41:12] and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to
[41:17] leoda and it's addressed to each of
[41:21] these angels and how many of these
[41:24] angels are there does anyone know
[41:27] seven
[41:28] angels seven Messengers to this this
[41:34] church these churches that this
[41:36] Revelation 2 and Revelation three are
[41:38] talking about we get to the last one in
[41:42] Revelation chapter 3 and I'll read it
[41:45] read it here three um verse four verse
[41:49] 14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[41:52] the leod Deans write these things saith
[41:55] the amen the amen the so be it Jesus
[42:00] Christ
[42:01] speaking sayith the amen the faithful
[42:04] and true witness the beginning of the
[42:06] creation of God speaking to this Jesus
[42:11] Christ is speaking to this messenger
[42:15] that he is going to give a message to an
[42:19] age and that man is going to be the most
[42:23] influential person in that entire age
[42:27] now we know that that uh that God had
[42:31] ordained men to start this work in that
[42:36] in that age and I'll tell you something
[42:38] you didn't know sometimes that man may
[42:42] not even be born in that age he may be
[42:45] born just before the age but it was his
[42:48] ministry that influenced that age
[42:54] now there are seven of these and then if
[42:59] you go to Revelation 4 verse1 it's
[43:03] talking about something different it it
[43:06] says it's it's we're be we're beginning
[43:09] the introduction to the Seven Seals here
[43:13] four five six and then the last seal is
[43:17] in chapter
[43:18] 8 so we see that there are not eight
[43:22] Messengers there are seven very very
[43:25] plain
[43:26] so what happens is people have ministers
[43:31] have they have
[43:34] taken different scriptures and different
[43:38] quotes and they have taken these and
[43:40] then they have made it to where they
[43:44] they get a revelation I don't question
[43:46] their
[43:47] Revelation but they get a revelation and
[43:50] that
[43:52] Revelation goes in a certain direction
[43:54] and it starts to lift lift up this
[43:58] Minister and that Minister becomes
[44:02] something more than than he really is in
[44:07] his mind and in the minds of other
[44:08] people so there are doctrines out there
[44:12] that say that there is an eighth
[44:15] messenger but this book right here it's
[44:20] very hard to pull out an eighth
[44:22] messenger out of this book you got to do
[44:24] a lot of twisting and term in and
[44:26] pulling and prodding and and putting
[44:29] things
[44:30] together that uh that would be a not
[44:34] according to to this word but people
[44:38] will get a revelation as I said and
[44:40] that's what my subject is going to be on
[44:42] today people will get a
[44:45] revelation and then they will take that
[44:48] Revelation a place that God didn't
[44:50] wanted to go a place that this it it
[44:55] becomes so
[44:56] self-serving it becomes my Revelation
[45:01] and I am important and now I
[45:05] fulfill these scriptures the Bible says
[45:08] a man not ought to think too highly of
[45:10] himself
[45:12] that's this these kind of things are the
[45:16] extreme saying that I am the eighth
[45:18] messenger or or something like that wow
[45:21] you have very very high aspirations
[45:23] brother but I would come back down down
[45:26] to earth and and I would encourage these
[45:29] Brethren that say something like that
[45:32] you need to come down to this
[45:35] Altar and
[45:37] repent and you've made too much of
[45:39] yourself so I wanted to answer that
[45:41] question I hope it answers it um because
[45:45] it is a very very important question and
[45:46] it's a doctrine that has gone around the
[45:48] world people take have
[45:51] taken certain quotes and and certain
[45:54] scriptures and they'll line up them up
[45:56] and who does it lift up it lifts up me
[45:59] it lifts up
[46:00] us so that's I wanted to wanted to
[46:03] answer that
[46:04] question and uh I also want I want to
[46:07] give a testimony of uh of our service on
[46:10] Wednesday night I was um there was a
[46:13] sister is Sister Priscilla did I see her
[46:15] walk in Sister Priscilla fryo uh she was
[46:18] she was talking with there they are I
[46:21] was just talking about
[46:24] you um
[46:26] sister
[46:27] Priscilla um felt in her heart to
[46:30] witness to a young man that was in the
[46:32] convenience
[46:34] store and it turns out that this young
[46:38] man was on a journey he drove a truck
[46:43] and he was here in Tucson for a certain
[46:45] amount of time I believe to pick up
[46:46] another load and bring it back to his
[46:48] home in Texas and sister pela in invited
[46:53] him to church and the young man I was
[46:56] she gave me his phone number I called
[46:58] him and uh we talked on the phone a
[47:00] little bit and he just seemed like wow
[47:03] this is a a real Christian young man a
[47:06] very fine young man
[47:08] so he ends up coming to
[47:11] church and I look look out the window or
[47:15] I walked out the door and I see him
[47:17] there so I walked out into the parking
[47:20] lot and I said are you George and he
[47:23] sayses I said hi I'm Daniel I'm the I'm
[47:26] the pastor of the church and and we
[47:28] started talking and and I said brother
[47:30] it's you just got a nice spirit it's
[47:32] nice that you came and and join us I
[47:34] said the Lord's really been doing
[47:36] something in our congregation lately I
[47:38] said that that um we've had quite a few
[47:41] baptisms in the church it just feels
[47:43] like the Lord's dealing with us and he
[47:45] looked at me and he said you said
[47:49] it he saysi want to be baptized
[47:52] tonight and I said uh I said whoa like
[47:57] like what and he says he says I made a
[47:59] commitment he says I'm on this journey
[48:01] and he says I feel like there was one
[48:03] thing that I left that that I needed to
[48:07] do and that was to be baptized and he
[48:10] said I made a commitment to the Lord if
[48:13] the pastor mentions baptism then I am
[48:16] going to be baptized
[48:18] tonight wonderful testimony for those of
[48:21] you that were here um he's probably I
[48:24] texted him the service this morning he's
[48:26] probably listening in on the stream
[48:29] right now but I just it it was it was
[48:32] really the Lord that was doing that so I
[48:35] took the
[48:37] pulpit and as I was ministering on
[48:42] Wednesday um things just weren't going
[48:47] right sister Shirley was there smiling
[48:50] like you usually are and I just what had
[48:52] happened is I just didn't feel the
[48:54] anointing
[48:56] when I was here and this has happened to
[48:57] me one time
[48:58] before and and I just know now to to
[49:01] don't just press through if I've done
[49:03] something wrong or if I've grieved the
[49:05] Holy Spirit I want to just stop and
[49:08] that's the best thing to do for all of
[49:10] us if you've done something wrong stop
[49:13] you know the old saying is if you find
[49:16] that you've dug yourself a hole the best
[49:18] thing to do the first thing to do is to
[49:21] stop
[49:22] digging and that's what that's so that's
[49:24] that's what I did is I just stopped and
[49:27] and uh we had prayer and then I went
[49:30] back to ministering and and I felt like
[49:32] things were okay we
[49:35] baptized um brother George up
[49:38] there and after that I just struggled
[49:43] during the week said Lord have I have I
[49:47] done done something really wrong I just
[49:51] felt like up there Lord I felt like I
[49:53] was out of your will I felt I felt like
[49:55] you weren't with me and and so I kept
[49:58] praying and and asking the Lord Lord
[50:01] what have I
[50:05] done that's not a good thing to
[50:08] ask because how many things have I done
[50:13] just in the past week how many things
[50:15] have I done how many times have I failed
[50:17] God in just just a few days so all these
[50:21] things were coming to my mind and I was
[50:23] just say Lord what what is going on and
[50:25] I I'm not a preacher Lord I'm just I
[50:27] don't know what am I doing and and
[50:31] praying and then I wanted to
[50:34] share on Saturday
[50:37] morning at about 3 o'clock in the
[50:41] morning something woke me
[50:44] up just and I just woke up and I felt
[50:49] there was a presence
[50:51] there and that presence was just so
[50:56] beautiful it was so strong and it was it
[51:00] was just a presence of just pure love
[51:05] and I was laying there in bed and I had
[51:07] all these questions on my heart but I
[51:09] didn't want to ask any
[51:11] question I didn't want I I didn't want
[51:14] to do anything all I wanted to do was
[51:16] say oh Lord Jesus I love you so much and
[51:20] there he was and and this presence in
[51:22] the room and I was just I started
[51:25] weeping I was like Lord I just love you
[51:27] I just thank you so much you're so kind
[51:30] and you're so loving and then I
[51:35] was and I just felt like he was
[51:40] saying I know I love
[51:43] you you're my son you're my boy and like
[51:47] he does to so many of us we are failures
[51:51] friends we we can't
[51:56] do really anything right without him and
[52:01] I was as I was praying about this sermon
[52:04] this morning and Lord what do you want
[52:06] me to bring I'm a failure I'm I'm
[52:11] everything and all I was seeing is is
[52:13] failure and then the love came in and
[52:16] and and praying about
[52:18] this thinking on what to present this
[52:22] morning and thinking about that eighth
[52:24] message messenger and what is being
[52:27] presented and what's being presented all
[52:29] over the world from the ministry some of
[52:32] these things are really they're false
[52:34] and they're destructive and they hurt
[52:37] the
[52:39] people
[52:41] and looking at the word and what it says
[52:47] and then we think because we have a
[52:50] revelation that we've got it all
[52:52] finished and it's all done and then it
[52:54] becomes no matter what what it is then
[52:56] it becomes my
[52:59] Revelation not God and then we get this
[53:04] Revelation and everything siners around
[53:07] this Revelation that we have and instead
[53:12] of asking the Lord for more
[53:14] Revelation asking the Lord for more of
[53:17] his word for more love for more faith
[53:21] instead we stop and we become a
[53:24] denomination or a cult right into
[53:28] ourselves and everything from then on
[53:32] has to line up with what God gave us in
[53:36] this Revelation and we take it to a
[53:38] place that God didn't intend
[53:40] it God gives us a little bit and we take
[53:44] a whole
[53:45] bunch like these brothers they may be
[53:48] Anointed with the Holy Ghost they may
[53:51] have received a revelation but they take
[53:53] it too far and and then it becomes
[53:56] destructive and it becomes about control
[53:59] and it becomes hatred and it becomes
[54:01] about themselves and protecting their
[54:04] own Ministry and lifting themselves up
[54:07] and we lose
[54:09] sight of Jesus
[54:11] Christ we lose sight of what he did for
[54:16] us and we want to go
[54:18] down this road and as he gives us
[54:23] revelation we don't want to stop there
[54:26] we want to say thank you Lord and
[54:28] continue praying about it and continue
[54:33] moving and realize friends that we know
[54:36] nothing we're nothing we're not special
[54:40] we're not anything we
[54:43] are we're as I used to say we're zeros
[54:47] Christ is everything and I don't want to
[54:50] know I don't want to know all of these
[54:53] all of these great Revelations and and
[54:55] all of these things Paul said no I have
[54:58] all of that he says I'm nothing without
[55:01] love and that's what is cast out first
[55:04] is love when we have these Revelations
[55:07] and we start lifting ourselves up that's
[55:09] the first thing that goes love leaves
[55:13] and control
[55:15] starts what a mess that we get into the
[55:18] Apostle
[55:19] Paul in his wisdom he addressed it one
[55:23] time and well many many times he
[55:25] addressed it but in 1 Corinthians chap 2
[55:29] verse1 listen to this he says this and I
[55:34] Brethren when I came to you came not
[55:36] with Excellency of speech or of wisdom
[55:40] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[55:42] I didn't come to you as some great
[55:44] something some eighth messenger or some
[55:46] big powerful speaker or some anointed
[55:50] prophet of God I didn't come to you in
[55:51] any of
[55:53] that for I am
[55:56] determined not to know anything among
[55:59] you save Jesus Christ and him
[56:03] crucified that is the man with probably
[56:06] the one of the greatest Revelations
[56:08] that's ever walked the Earth and yet he
[56:12] says
[56:13] himself I don't want
[56:16] anything except to keep my eyes fixed on
[56:22] Jesus Christ and him crucified let me
[56:24] read read that scripture in Hebrews once
[56:26] again it says this Hebrews 12 12:2
[56:30] looking unto Jesus the
[56:34] author and finisher of our
[56:37] faith who for the joy that was set
[56:40] before him endured the cross despising
[56:42] the sh shame and is sat down at the
[56:45] right hand of the Throne of
[56:48] God always keeping my eye on Jesus
[56:52] always watching
[56:53] him the very first sermon I think I ever
[56:57] preached here I was talking
[56:59] about signs I I told the testimony of
[57:02] Daniel and I driving the car out
[57:05] here and as we were going on the road I
[57:08] 10 as Tucson was getting closer we took
[57:12] we took a a road that was pre-ordained
[57:14] for us to go we took that road it was
[57:18] the most efficient way here and then we
[57:20] get close to Tucson and it said Tucson
[57:23] 50 miles or whatever the sign says and
[57:26] it showed number one it showed we are on
[57:28] the right path we're going there's the
[57:32] sign I can see the sign I am going to
[57:35] get Tucson to Tucson if we just stay on
[57:38] this road but what we don't do is
[57:41] stop and jump up and down and say we
[57:45] made it here's the
[57:47] sign you didn't make it we have nobody
[57:51] here has made it yet I'll tell you that
[57:53] right now none of us have made it it yet
[57:55] because we're still here in these
[57:56] fleshly bodies one day soon we will go
[58:00] up that may be the way of the Grave or
[58:04] it may be the way of the Rapture but we
[58:07] will go up with Christ but don't stop at
[58:10] the sign do what the S what the sign
[58:14] says continue
[58:17] on God has pre-ordained a path for us in
[58:22] this
[58:23] day
[58:25] he has set this path before us and then
[58:27] he has given us the opportunity that we
[58:31] can choose are we going to go on this
[58:34] path or are we going to stray and take
[58:38] side roads I suggest we follow the signs
[58:42] and do what the signs say and stay on
[58:46] those paths I gave a testimony last week
[58:50] gave my testimony I I really kind of let
[58:54] put my myself out there and saying
[58:55] here's here's really how I came to the
[58:59] place that I am right now and I told
[59:00] about a man that
[59:04] had never
[59:06] heard
[59:08] another minister in this message that we
[59:12] believe all he had was this volume of
[59:16] books and it was such a blessing to me
[59:19] to hear his perspective on
[59:21] things and what I forgot to tell last
[59:24] week
[59:25] was when I was driving home that
[59:29] night I made the decision I told this
[59:34] part that I need to decide do I believe
[59:37] this or not I was a kid I was born I was
[59:40] born into this do I really believe this
[59:44] and I said yes the thing that I left out
[59:46] was this I made a commitment I said
[59:51] Lord I am full of
[59:56] doctrines and I felt
[59:58] dirty I said I am full of of all these
[1:00:02] different these different ways of
[1:00:05] thinking and I said Lord I want to get
[1:00:07] rid of all of
[1:00:08] that and I want to set my eyes on Jesus
[1:00:13] Christ which is what all the prophets
[1:00:16] set their eyes on and I want to follow
[1:00:19] that path I want to follow that road and
[1:00:22] I want to be able to receive more
[1:00:24] revelation
[1:00:25] but I want to get rid of all of these
[1:00:28] ways of thinking that I had and just
[1:00:32] think like you want me to think just go
[1:00:35] along this road that God has set and
[1:00:39] ordained for me to
[1:00:42] travel but
[1:00:44] instead brothers and sisters we get
[1:00:49] Revelations that are right that are
[1:00:52] according to God's word god God gives
[1:00:54] them to us and then we we start living
[1:00:57] our life around this one Revelation and
[1:01:00] as I said we take it farther than it
[1:01:02] should have gone and we draw a circle we
[1:01:06] make a little cult around
[1:01:08] ourselves and now we've sealed not only
[1:01:11] we seal sealed ourselves in we've sealed
[1:01:13] God
[1:01:15] out we shouldn't be that way because we
[1:01:19] often say this is my Revelation and my
[1:01:22] Revelation is right and it fa fail and I
[1:01:25] set my salvation on my Revelation guess
[1:01:28] what brother or sister if it's your
[1:01:31] Revelation it's
[1:01:32] wrong if it's a revelation that God sent
[1:01:35] down and set before you now it's
[1:01:39] right receive that and continue on and
[1:01:44] don't stop right there continue on in
[1:01:48] the grace of God continue on learning
[1:01:53] more accepting more being more holy you
[1:01:57] can say okay well I got this little
[1:01:59] thing
[1:02:00] right and you look around and maybe some
[1:02:02] other people don't have that right and
[1:02:04] here you are looking around say oh look
[1:02:06] at how great I am I was telling
[1:02:11] Stephanie probably shouldn't say
[1:02:15] it I might very well offend half of the
[1:02:17] people
[1:02:19] here it wasn't her that said it was me
[1:02:22] um okay I'll say it
[1:02:30] you might not say you might not say
[1:02:35] that I don't have conviction one way or
[1:02:38] the other on this I'll tell you
[1:02:40] that but many people many people in this
[1:02:46] community that we Fellowship in
[1:02:48] throughout the world really they'll talk
[1:02:50] about Christmas and Christmas trees and
[1:02:54] and they'll talk about a certain thing
[1:02:57] and and they'll say well in their mind
[1:03:01] we don't have a Christmas tree and look
[1:03:03] at all these heathens that have
[1:03:04] Christmas
[1:03:05] trees as I said I don't have I don't
[1:03:08] care
[1:03:10] but what happens is is you start putting
[1:03:15] down the other people that may do that
[1:03:19] and by doing that you are exalting
[1:03:21] yourself over that person and and you
[1:03:24] are saying I am better than you because
[1:03:26] of
[1:03:28] this and and you're cutting them out and
[1:03:32] then that becomes your Doctrine and this
[1:03:35] circle is around it and you think you're
[1:03:39] better and it could be anything I just
[1:03:41] used Christmas tree because it's coming
[1:03:43] up on Christmas so what happens many
[1:03:46] times is that person we're on this path
[1:03:49] to Christ and if our eyes are set on
[1:03:52] Christ then we're we're going to go the
[1:03:54] right way so we're going along and then
[1:03:57] this person starts drawing a circle with
[1:04:00] a Doctrine saying that whatever it is
[1:04:03] and it might be
[1:04:06] right it probably is many of these
[1:04:08] doctrines are very very correct and
[1:04:11] according to God's word but you build
[1:04:13] this circle and that person you're
[1:04:16] pointing at they just change lanes and
[1:04:19] they go right around you and they
[1:04:22] continue on towards Jesus
[1:04:26] Christ be and I'm talking to myself here
[1:04:30] because I've I've made all the
[1:04:32] mistakes we need to make sure that we're
[1:04:36] not
[1:04:37] building a circle around
[1:04:41] ourselves build those circles around
[1:04:43] other people and draw those other
[1:04:46] people's in even though if they might
[1:04:48] not agree with our
[1:04:51] doctrines um
[1:04:54] we look at we look at
[1:04:57] science science is a good example we've
[1:05:01] I read a couple days ago we were talking
[1:05:02] with the kids about the human
[1:05:05] genome and how they mapped the the human
[1:05:08] genome it was one of the greatest Feats
[1:05:10] that science had ever done they M this
[1:05:13] this double helix the strand of DNA and
[1:05:16] they are able to with the combinations
[1:05:19] that are in there they are able to
[1:05:20] identify every form of life and not only
[1:05:23] every form of life but every individual
[1:05:26] form of life within those forms of life
[1:05:29] amazing amazing thing that they've done
[1:05:31] and I think they just have filled in all
[1:05:33] the gaps here recently and as they're
[1:05:36] going through they're saying okay we
[1:05:37] figured this out everything we
[1:05:40] understand now we understand this Human
[1:05:42] Genome we understand DNA and now they
[1:05:44] can like they caught the guy that killed
[1:05:46] those college students just because he
[1:05:48] touched a a button on the knife sheath
[1:05:53] that he he he killed the kids with just
[1:05:56] a little bit of DNA and they were able
[1:05:58] to nail it down to one
[1:06:01] person and so science has progressed
[1:06:04] more in the past 20 years than it has in
[1:06:06] the first 6,000 years and it's going
[1:06:09] faster and faster and faster but I'll
[1:06:10] tell you in 50 years they're going to
[1:06:12] look back and they're can say they're
[1:06:15] going to say okay well that was our
[1:06:18] understanding for that day but we're far
[1:06:19] beyond that
[1:06:21] now and same thing with us
[1:06:25] that's how we should be Paul said when I
[1:06:27] was a child I thought as a child and I
[1:06:29] spake as a child and we are
[1:06:32] children and the same thing with
[1:06:35] Christianity and with learning about the
[1:06:37] Lord we learn something Lord this is
[1:06:41] wonderful this is the greatest thing
[1:06:42] that's ever happened to me continue on
[1:06:45] with that and continue on on the path to
[1:06:48] Christ don't
[1:06:49] stop don't stop right
[1:06:52] there follow follow that path that God
[1:06:56] has set before
[1:06:58] us again Paul said I am determined not
[1:07:02] to know anything among you except Jesus
[1:07:06] Christ and him crucified Paul's eyes and
[1:07:09] the reason he was so successful the
[1:07:12] reason he was such a wonderful man and a
[1:07:13] wonderful Minister and the reason that
[1:07:15] we still read his writings
[1:07:18] today is because his path was set on
[1:07:21] Christ his eyes were set on on Christ he
[1:07:25] didn't deviate from that and as if God
[1:07:29] can have a man like that or a woman like
[1:07:31] that he will continue to bless us with
[1:07:32] more Revelation and more Revelation and
[1:07:35] the more revelation we have the closer
[1:07:37] we will get to God until one day we will
[1:07:42] be one with that word we will be one
[1:07:47] with Christ and that's the day that I
[1:07:50] look forward to so
[1:07:52] much and that's the day it's like okay
[1:07:54] Lord my failures are
[1:07:55] over right now they're with me every day
[1:07:59] but I look forward to that day that
[1:08:02] those those failures will be gone Jesus
[1:08:05] said he said if you abide in
[1:08:09] me right and my words abide in you he
[1:08:13] said ask what you will and it will be
[1:08:15] done how beautiful if we abide in Christ
[1:08:19] and we follow that that cross we follow
[1:08:22] that way keep our eyes on that continue
[1:08:25] on that path and even Peter himself
[1:08:29] Jesus's disciple he told us he's like
[1:08:31] hey keep
[1:08:33] progressing keep getting better don't
[1:08:37] just stop because you got something
[1:08:39] don't just stop because you saw a sign
[1:08:41] he said in in second Peter chapter 1
[1:08:43] verse4 he said whereby are given unto us
[1:08:47] exceeding great and precious
[1:08:50] promises that by these ye might be
[1:08:53] partake Akers of the divine nature very
[1:08:57] important divine nature having escaped
[1:09:00] the corruption that is in the world
[1:09:02] through
[1:09:05] lust and beside
[1:09:07] this giving all deligence
[1:09:11] add to your faith
[1:09:14] virtue add you're not there yet Peter's
[1:09:18] saying add get closer to God add to your
[1:09:21] faith virtue
[1:09:24] and to Virtue knowledge add knowledge
[1:09:28] keep studying the book keep listening
[1:09:31] keep praying keep going add knowledge to
[1:09:33] that you're not done
[1:09:35] yet and to knowledge
[1:09:38] Temperance chill out don't get mad Jesus
[1:09:42] didn't get mad if somebody did him wrong
[1:09:45] he loved him for it add to your virtue
[1:09:49] knowledge to knowledge Temperance and to
[1:09:51] Temperance then add patience keep going
[1:09:54] don't stop okay you you got temper you
[1:09:56] got the temper under control but now add
[1:09:59] patience patience with what patience
[1:10:02] with each other and patience with
[1:10:04] God lord your word says if if I abide in
[1:10:07] you and your word abides in me to ask
[1:10:11] what you will and it shall be given to
[1:10:13] you well where is it
[1:10:16] patience patience it'll come and to
[1:10:20] patience
[1:10:22] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[1:10:25] kindness and brotherly kindness what's
[1:10:27] the
[1:10:29] top charity
[1:10:31] love that's the top so we are constantly
[1:10:36] adding to our walk with the Lord don't
[1:10:40] stop keep moving for if these things be
[1:10:45] in
[1:10:47] you and
[1:10:49] abound not just I didn't lose my temper
[1:10:52] today
[1:10:54] they need to abound always just bubbling
[1:10:57] forth always coming out abounding not
[1:11:00] just you show it one time but these
[1:11:02] things are always in your life they
[1:11:03] abound and they make you that ye shall
[1:11:08] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[1:11:10] knowledge of our Lord Jesus the focus is
[1:11:14] on
[1:11:15] Christ the focus is on Jesus he gives
[1:11:18] you Revelation make sure that you
[1:11:20] continue on going to Jesus
[1:11:24] but he that lath these things is
[1:11:27] blind watch this and cannot
[1:11:30] see a far
[1:11:33] off it's very very important part of it
[1:11:38] if you don't have these things you're
[1:11:39] shortsighted here you're just looking at
[1:11:42] this little thing that you've created
[1:11:44] around yourself and you're not seeing
[1:11:46] the end of the road down there you're
[1:11:47] not seeing that that this is just a sign
[1:11:50] that God gave you continue on believe
[1:11:53] the sign listen to the sign don't ignore
[1:11:57] it but do what it says and continue on
[1:12:00] to that
[1:12:03] cross to Jesus
[1:12:08] Christ they've
[1:12:10] forgotten that
[1:12:12] he Jesus was
[1:12:15] purged and ha forgotten that he The
[1:12:18] Sinner by Jesus Christ was purged from
[1:12:22] his old sins
[1:12:27] right here again it tells us as Hebrews
[1:12:30] 121 said in
[1:12:32] 122 don't neglect
[1:12:35] Christ he you were purged by Jesus
[1:12:39] Christ you've been saved don't stop keep
[1:12:44] going in every aspect of your
[1:12:47] life now let's get to Romans chapter 8
[1:12:50] and this is this is what I wanted to be
[1:12:53] my subject
[1:12:55] here Romans chapter 8 ver
[1:12:59] 26 this is going to encourage you and
[1:13:03] it's just a a beautiful beautiful
[1:13:06] chapter
[1:13:08] likewise the spirit also the Holy Spirit
[1:13:11] also help helpeth our infirmities for we
[1:13:15] know not what we should pray for as we
[1:13:17] ought but the spirit itself make
[1:13:19] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:13:21] cannot be
[1:13:22] uttered so the Holy Spirit speaking the
[1:13:25] words to the father for
[1:13:28] us and he that searches the hearts
[1:13:30] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit
[1:13:34] because he maketh intercessions for the
[1:13:36] Saints according to the will of
[1:13:38] God and we know that all
[1:13:42] things work together for
[1:13:45] good to them that love God to them who
[1:13:49] are called according to his purpose it's
[1:13:51] a famous verse and all all of us I'm
[1:13:53] sure have found comfort in that that
[1:13:56] verse but the Apostle here we forget
[1:13:58] about the rest of it the Apostle here is
[1:14:02] going to dig deep into what he said
[1:14:04] about these things for working for the
[1:14:07] good and watch
[1:14:09] this for whom he did
[1:14:14] Forno he also did
[1:14:19] predestinate to
[1:14:21] what we say that we are predestinated we
[1:14:25] are the predestinated seat of God and
[1:14:26] everything's
[1:14:27] predestinated we're all listen everyone
[1:14:30] is
[1:14:31] predestinated everyone has a path set
[1:14:34] before them and God knew what every
[1:14:37] person what turns they were going to
[1:14:39] take what failures they were going to do
[1:14:41] and he knew the ultimate D destination
[1:14:43] of every person so it's beyond just
[1:14:47] being
[1:14:50] predestinated predestinated to what
[1:14:54] listen to this to be conformed to the
[1:14:58] image of his son that he might be the
[1:15:01] firstborn among many
[1:15:03] Brethren so we are conformed to the
[1:15:06] image of Jesus Christ that's what
[1:15:10] predestination is that's what we long
[1:15:13] for is to be like
[1:15:18] Jesus for whom he did
[1:15:22] Forno
[1:15:26] he did also
[1:15:28] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:15:31] image of his son that he might be the
[1:15:33] firstborn among many
[1:15:35] Brethren the Amplified version of that
[1:15:38] verse says this for those he fornew and
[1:15:42] loved and chose beforehand he also
[1:15:45] predestined to be conformed to the image
[1:15:49] of his son and ultimately share in his
[1:15:51] complete sanctification
[1:15:53] so that he Christ would be the firstborn
[1:15:57] the most beloved and honored among
[1:16:00] Believers now now the Amplified version
[1:16:03] remember that's it's Amplified it's
[1:16:06] added to um
[1:16:10] but what what the author there is saying
[1:16:13] he's helping us to understand the
[1:16:14] context in which this was written verse
[1:16:17] number
[1:16:19] 30 moreover whom he did pred destinate
[1:16:24] now he's talking about the True
[1:16:25] Believers here them he also called and
[1:16:29] whom he called them he also Justified
[1:16:33] and whom he justified them he also
[1:16:37] glorified I love that word
[1:16:41] Justified it doesn't mean that I was
[1:16:44] forgiven of my
[1:16:45] crime it doesn't mean I was forgiven of
[1:16:48] my
[1:16:49] sin as I was standing here on Wednesday
[1:16:51] night and I was like Lord what did I
[1:16:54] do and I was praying about it afterwards
[1:16:57] as I was praying there was all these
[1:16:59] mistakes that I had made coming into my
[1:17:01] mind it doesn't mean that I'm forgiven
[1:17:04] for those
[1:17:06] mistakes it means that I am
[1:17:09] justified it means I never did them in
[1:17:12] the first place I never committed a
[1:17:13] crime you can't pers prosecute me
[1:17:16] because I wasn't I didn't do it you know
[1:17:19] who did it it's a sad story Jesus Christ
[1:17:23] is the one that took the
[1:17:24] blame he stood for me he stood for all
[1:17:28] of us he is the one that was condemned
[1:17:30] him that was without sin was condemned
[1:17:32] from
[1:17:33] me but thank God he did and I love him
[1:17:36] for it I'm going to try to live my whole
[1:17:38] life for him because of what he did for
[1:17:41] me what shall we
[1:17:44] say then what shall we then say to all
[1:17:48] these things to these things if God be
[1:17:50] for us who can can be against us all
[1:17:55] things are working for the good as he
[1:17:57] said as he said earlier these things all
[1:18:00] things are working for the good to them
[1:18:01] that are called according to his purpose
[1:18:03] everything's good you may be
[1:18:06] sick but it's for his purpose you may
[1:18:09] have listen to this you may have
[1:18:13] sinned you may have made a
[1:18:16] mistake but if you are
[1:18:20] predestinated to the image of God
[1:18:24] it'll work out for the better it will
[1:18:28] work out for your own good and it will
[1:18:31] also work out for the good of
[1:18:33] others so
[1:18:36] if I made a mistake in my life if I
[1:18:41] sinned I'll answer for those sins in the
[1:18:43] flesh if I sin in the flesh I have to I
[1:18:45] have to live with my
[1:18:47] flesh but so I'm not saying that if
[1:18:50] you've sinned and you've done something
[1:18:52] wrong then oh it's okay because that was
[1:18:56] that
[1:18:57] was um you know what I'm talking about
[1:19:00] if if you've done something wrong in the
[1:19:03] flesh you will suffer in the flesh if I
[1:19:06] go out and get strung out on
[1:19:08] drugs and I'm shooting up with meth or
[1:19:12] whatever it is and I give my heart to
[1:19:15] the Lord and I change I will probably
[1:19:18] still have the effects of the drugs as
[1:19:20] long as I
[1:19:21] live but it's not accounted to me
[1:19:26] afterwards I am justified I didn't even
[1:19:30] sin in the spiritual realm
[1:19:34] so if God allows us to make a mistake
[1:19:40] many times it is to see what you are
[1:19:42] going to do about it he'll let you
[1:19:46] fall all God has to do is take his hand
[1:19:48] off of you for one moment we'll all fall
[1:19:51] all of us we are we are are sinners born
[1:19:53] in sin shaped in the iniquity of the
[1:19:57] world come to the world speaking lies
[1:20:01] all of us are it's only by the grace of
[1:20:04] God that there's any good in any of us
[1:20:06] and if he takes his hand off of
[1:20:08] us we'll fall but sometimes he
[1:20:13] does he'll take his hand off of us and
[1:20:17] allow us to
[1:20:18] fall and
[1:20:20] then we struggle and we get back up and
[1:20:24] that's why friends sometimes don't when
[1:20:28] somebody Falls be careful about just
[1:20:31] pushing them
[1:20:32] down it's easy
[1:20:34] when when someone like like my son there
[1:20:37] a big stocky guy if he's standing
[1:20:40] toe-to-toe with any of us um we probably
[1:20:44] none of us would probably do well but if
[1:20:47] he's on his
[1:20:49] knees and he's trying to get up
[1:20:53] it's real easy just to push him down
[1:20:55] doesn't matter how strong he is and he's
[1:20:57] trying to get up push him down it
[1:21:00] doesn't matter how big and strong or how
[1:21:02] much more powerful Daniel is than me if
[1:21:04] he's if he's on his knees and he's
[1:21:06] wobbling and I just push he'll go right
[1:21:08] over so be careful with that with
[1:21:10] somebody that is trying to get up that's
[1:21:12] somebody that's maybe fallen into sin
[1:21:14] don't push them down grab them and pick
[1:21:17] them up and then they they can get their
[1:21:18] feet on the ground and square up to the
[1:21:21] enemy all of us need that sometime we
[1:21:25] need that encouragement and that
[1:21:27] encouragement I read that uh testimony
[1:21:29] on Sunday night about that that young
[1:21:32] lady who was she was living in sin in a
[1:21:35] in a
[1:21:35] homosexual um lifestyle and and she was
[1:21:40] in drugs and all of these things and one
[1:21:43] man in a church she was coming to a
[1:21:46] funeral and that man there was there was
[1:21:48] a congestion there he moved over and he
[1:21:52] said these words excuse me
[1:21:55] sister and just him calling her a
[1:21:59] sister that was what changed her
[1:22:03] life that he respected her enough to
[1:22:06] call her a sister he didn't condemn her
[1:22:08] she looked terrible he didn't condemn
[1:22:11] her you know what he did he reached down
[1:22:13] he picked her up and she got both feet
[1:22:16] on the ground and she gave her life to
[1:22:19] Jesus Christ she set her sights
[1:22:23] on that cross right there running
[1:22:26] towards it and God kept filling her and
[1:22:29] filling her and giving her more and
[1:22:30] giving him more and she is on the
[1:22:32] journey today just like all of us are
[1:22:34] thank God for that man in his one little
[1:22:37] kind
[1:22:38] word call her a
[1:22:41] sister remember how
[1:22:44] job these these bad things that happened
[1:22:47] to
[1:22:48] us and how we can say Lord why did I do
[1:22:52] why why am I going through this why I
[1:22:54] didn't I didn't do anything to deserve
[1:22:56] this this wasn't my
[1:23:00] fault and God's like looks
[1:23:04] down but I wrote to you in the from the
[1:23:07] Apostle Paul all things work together
[1:23:10] for the good what part of that do you
[1:23:12] not
[1:23:14] understand here's job his family was
[1:23:17] gone his life his whole livelihood was
[1:23:20] gone even his wife hated him
[1:23:23] was disgusted by it what job said though
[1:23:26] he slay me yet will I serve
[1:23:29] him it doesn't matter I deserve it and
[1:23:33] all of us do but sometimes he will let
[1:23:35] us
[1:23:37] fall so we can get back up and we can
[1:23:40] have that experience and maybe do you
[1:23:41] think it's if I've fallen and I see
[1:23:44] somebody down there I'm G to grab them
[1:23:48] pick them back up brother I was there
[1:23:51] I've been there
[1:23:53] and sometimes if someone needs
[1:23:55] counseling or if someone's
[1:23:57] hurting I'll Point them to someone who's
[1:24:00] gone through it go talk to this brother
[1:24:03] go talk to this sister and those
[1:24:05] experiences that we've experienced that
[1:24:07] we're ashamed of now they can be used
[1:24:10] for the good to help other
[1:24:18] people where we at verse number
[1:24:21] 32
[1:24:22] let me read verse number 31 first so we
[1:24:24] can keep it in context
[1:24:26] here what shall we what shall we then
[1:24:29] say to these things if God be for us who
[1:24:32] can be against
[1:24:35] us he that spared not his own son but
[1:24:39] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:24:43] not with him also freely give us all
[1:24:47] things give us all
[1:24:49] things what does that mean
[1:24:53] well so we're going to maybe have to
[1:24:55] suffer and we're going through this but
[1:24:57] all things work together for the good
[1:24:59] and and brother it's it's easy for you
[1:25:01] to say but I'm the one suffering right
[1:25:03] now as as many times our
[1:25:06] attitude imagine the
[1:25:09] disciples probably the worst thing that
[1:25:12] had ever happened to them here they are
[1:25:14] with Jesus they're Healing The Sick and
[1:25:17] casting out devils and and people like
[1:25:20] Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany are
[1:25:23] coming and they're coming and falling
[1:25:25] down and and giving their hearts to the
[1:25:27] Lord and you have the woman at the well
[1:25:28] who was who was in sin and and doing her
[1:25:31] thing and Jesus converts her and then
[1:25:33] she goes and she's telling everybody
[1:25:35] about this man Jesus this prophet and
[1:25:37] all of this is happening and all of this
[1:25:39] is great and he comes in to the city and
[1:25:42] he's riding on this donkey and everybody
[1:25:45] is is singing hosan and waving the Palm
[1:25:48] leaves and here he comes and they're
[1:25:49] walking they're walking with the Lord
[1:25:52] Lord Jesus and they're happy and then
[1:25:54] all of a sudden a couple days later he's
[1:25:56] on the cross dying condemned as the
[1:26:00] worst vile
[1:26:02] criminal imagine the disciples that was
[1:26:04] the worst thing that ever happened to
[1:26:06] them they're like how could we have been
[1:26:09] so
[1:26:10] wrong of course he was a prophet but the
[1:26:14] Messiah couldn't be hanging on that
[1:26:16] cross that doesn't make
[1:26:19] sense the lowest that they could have
[1:26:23] been was right there at that time but
[1:26:27] God blessed them all they remembered
[1:26:29] what Jesus said and they kept their eyes
[1:26:32] on him even though they failed Peter
[1:26:36] failed John failed they all ran away
[1:26:38] from him but yet they still wanted to
[1:26:41] keep their eyes on
[1:26:45] Jesus and that friends keeping your eyes
[1:26:49] on Jesus and conforming to that image of
[1:26:52] of the Cross conforming to that image of
[1:26:54] Christ that's the qualification for
[1:26:57] predestination it's not that God gave
[1:26:59] you a revelation he gives all of us
[1:27:01] Revelations he gives everybody
[1:27:03] Revelations but will you
[1:27:06] conform to
[1:27:08] Christ he said if you love me keep my
[1:27:13] Commandments do what I
[1:27:15] say some people say oh well nobody can
[1:27:18] do it yes you can he wouldn't have said
[1:27:21] it
[1:27:22] and if you fail what you
[1:27:25] will keep trying get up keep
[1:27:30] going verse number
[1:27:35] 33 what
[1:27:37] happens if we fail if we sin we're going
[1:27:42] along our our eyes are on Christ and we
[1:27:45] totally mess everything
[1:27:48] up who can lay anything to the charge of
[1:27:51] God's elect
[1:27:53] it is God that justifi not the law not
[1:27:57] that you broke the law and you did your
[1:27:59] time not any of that it's God that
[1:28:01] justifieth these things God is working
[1:28:03] on those who love
[1:28:06] him we surrender ourselves and our sins
[1:28:11] to
[1:28:13] God that's it's it's everything to us as
[1:28:16] I said with with with me I had to lay
[1:28:19] down when I was in that car that night
[1:28:21] and I said I'm full of all these
[1:28:24] doctrines I'm just I'm I'm filthy I'm
[1:28:27] sorry I I have all of this way of
[1:28:29] thinking and I've cut out all of these
[1:28:31] other people and here I am in my
[1:28:33] legalistic ways legalistic in a bad term
[1:28:37] in this way not not legalistic in living
[1:28:39] a good life and following what God Said
[1:28:41] but legalistic in exalting myself over
[1:28:44] someone
[1:28:45] else and here I am feeling filthy
[1:28:49] Feeling Just condemned of being a sinner
[1:28:51] because I did that and what did I have
[1:28:54] to lay
[1:28:56] down what did I have to lay down to keep
[1:28:58] my eyes on Jesus Christ I had to lay
[1:29:01] down my religion it's a very strange
[1:29:04] thing I had to lay down my way of
[1:29:07] thinking I had to
[1:29:10] revisit these Revelations that I've had
[1:29:13] and say you know what God those things
[1:29:15] were true but I took it to a place that
[1:29:17] God didn't want it to
[1:29:19] go and what did it do it encircled me
[1:29:24] and in my mind made me better than
[1:29:26] someone else that's why I used the
[1:29:29] analogy of the Christmas tree you can go
[1:29:32] and have a tongue a mile
[1:29:33] long running people down and doing all
[1:29:37] these other things but I don't have a
[1:29:38] Christmas
[1:29:41] tree I don't have one either we do oh we
[1:29:44] have a
[1:29:48] bush but it's it's meaningless
[1:29:53] it's
[1:29:55] ridiculous I have a conviction in my
[1:29:57] heart about many many
[1:30:00] things but check it with this
[1:30:04] word that's the most important thing and
[1:30:08] sometimes like I did sometimes you have
[1:30:10] to lay down your religion I heard a song
[1:30:13] when when I was um going through this
[1:30:16] time about three years ago I heard this
[1:30:20] song on the radio and I thought Lord
[1:30:24] thank
[1:30:26] you says this it saysi want to know you
[1:30:29] Lord he says like a
[1:30:33] friend so I want to know you Lord so I'm
[1:30:36] laying down all my
[1:30:39] religion I want to know you Lord I used
[1:30:42] to think I could box you
[1:30:44] in but I'm laying down I want to know
[1:30:47] you
[1:30:48] lord lord I've been told to be ashamed
[1:30:52] Lord I've been told I don't measure up
[1:30:55] Lord I've been told I'm not good enough
[1:30:57] but you're here with
[1:30:59] me and I reach out and you find me in
[1:31:02] the dust you say no amount of untruths
[1:31:06] can separate us he doesn't say you're
[1:31:09] laying the word down we don't lay this
[1:31:12] word down this word we lift up but we
[1:31:16] lay down our understanding that we lean
[1:31:19] on so much we lay that down
[1:31:23] down and because I know that my
[1:31:27] understanding is flawed and so is
[1:31:28] everyone else
[1:31:30] here the Pharisees and Sadducees they
[1:31:33] all had their religion but friends
[1:31:35] listen to
[1:31:37] this they didn't have a
[1:31:40] relationship they had a
[1:31:43] religion but it didn't produce a
[1:31:46] relationship with God what a shame
[1:31:49] that's not what I want for my life it's
[1:31:51] not what I want for my family's life or
[1:31:53] for this Church's life if I could if we
[1:31:55] could just get to Jesus Christ on that
[1:31:59] road following that cross keep that in
[1:32:02] your mind keep that in your in your
[1:32:05] always in your
[1:32:07] sight then you'll get there like when
[1:32:10] you're driving around Tucson Tucson's so
[1:32:12] great because you're like okay well I
[1:32:16] need to go over there and it's at the
[1:32:17] foot of the Catalina is over there so
[1:32:20] you can just weave around whatever Road
[1:32:22] you want to go and you'll eventually get
[1:32:24] there because you can see the
[1:32:26] destination and that's how we are with
[1:32:28] the cross just keep your eyes on Christ
[1:32:32] and know nothing else as Paul said this
[1:32:35] isn't me Paul I want know anything else
[1:32:39] just Jesus
[1:32:46] Christ verse number 34 who is he that
[1:32:50] condemneth it is Christ Christ that
[1:32:53] died yay rather is risen
[1:32:57] again who is even at the right hand of
[1:32:59] God who also maketh intercessions for us
[1:33:01] it's not of works-based Salvation it's
[1:33:03] all about Jesus and he is now at the
[1:33:08] right hand of God making intercessions
[1:33:10] for you and
[1:33:11] me so if Jesus is at the right hand of
[1:33:14] God making
[1:33:16] intercessions then there's somebody also
[1:33:19] in that place condemning
[1:33:22] me we all think of Satan down in
[1:33:25] hell you know and he flies up and and
[1:33:28] does his thing and then flies back down
[1:33:31] the word says he's not the word says
[1:33:34] he's with God right now and you know
[1:33:36] what he's
[1:33:38] saying accusing the Brethren he's
[1:33:41] saying Daniel Evans
[1:33:44] lied Daniel
[1:33:46] Evans had a bad
[1:33:49] thought surely
[1:33:52] she did this or that constantly
[1:33:55] condemning us constantly accusing us you
[1:33:58] know what let's read
[1:34:00] it Revelation
[1:34:04] 12 verse
[1:34:12] 9 and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[1:34:15] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[1:34:17] now this is something that's about to
[1:34:19] come that's about to take place which
[1:34:21] deceived the whole world he was cast out
[1:34:23] into the Earth and his angels were cast
[1:34:26] out with him and I heard a loud voice
[1:34:28] saying in heaven now is come salvation
[1:34:31] and strength and the kingdom of our God
[1:34:34] and the power of Christ for the accuser
[1:34:37] of our Brethren is cast down so he
[1:34:41] wasn't down he was
[1:34:43] up which accused them before God day and
[1:34:48] night this is happening right now
[1:34:52] as I am speaking it's happening to all
[1:34:54] of us Satan himself is there accusing
[1:34:57] each one of us each one of you each in
[1:35:00] me
[1:35:02] also and they and they overcame him by
[1:35:05] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:35:07] their testimony and they love not their
[1:35:10] lives unto death Satan is now with us
[1:35:13] was now with God accusing us day and
[1:35:15] night so what
[1:35:18] Spirit what spirit
[1:35:21] is on
[1:35:24] me if I accuse
[1:35:28] you think about
[1:35:31] it if I lay an
[1:35:34] accusation to you brother Tony what's
[1:35:37] spirit is on me even though it might be
[1:35:41] true what spirit is on
[1:35:45] me it's the spirit of Satan because he's
[1:35:48] doing it right now now correction
[1:35:52] is
[1:35:53] different correction is done out of love
[1:35:56] because you love the congregation you
[1:35:58] say stay away from this because this
[1:36:01] will harm
[1:36:03] you and you say I might go to one of the
[1:36:06] brothers or one of the sisters and say
[1:36:08] don't do
[1:36:09] this because this will
[1:36:11] lead to hardships in your
[1:36:18] life
[1:36:20] those
[1:36:22] back to your question about the eighth
[1:36:26] messenger and what these ministers many
[1:36:30] of these ministers do they use
[1:36:33] accusation to rule constantly accusing
[1:36:37] the members of
[1:36:39] sin then they use those accusations to
[1:36:41] put fear in the people and then they
[1:36:43] hold the sin over their heads and by
[1:36:44] doing this they remove the blood of
[1:36:47] Jesus Christ from the congregation and
[1:36:49] replace it with the with the authority
[1:36:50] of the
[1:36:52] Ministry let me ask
[1:36:54] you do you want the blood of Jesus
[1:36:57] Christ or do you want the authority of
[1:36:58] the
[1:37:00] ministry yes sir me
[1:37:03] too I want the blood of Jesus Christ I
[1:37:05] don't want to be under the
[1:37:09] control of a
[1:37:11] priest as they've always been I want to
[1:37:14] be under the control of Jesus Christ and
[1:37:16] the blood for my
[1:37:18] sins the um musicians can come and I'll
[1:37:21] let's go back to Romans
[1:37:24] 8 I read this last Sunday and I think it
[1:37:28] Bears
[1:37:29] repeating so here we are Satan
[1:37:35] accusing Jesus standing in the Bree
[1:37:38] between us and Satan saying no Lord
[1:37:42] wasn't
[1:37:43] Manny it was me Jesus your son that did
[1:37:47] this I'm the one that did it I'm the one
[1:37:49] that took his I'm I'm the one that
[1:37:51] committed the sin or that sin it wasn't
[1:37:54] him the father looks down he looks down
[1:37:57] at the blood of his son Jesus Christ and
[1:37:59] he says you're Justified you didn't do
[1:38:01] it there's there's the blood of my son
[1:38:05] he's the one that suffered he's the one
[1:38:07] that took the guilt every single one of
[1:38:10] us Satan there accusing accusing
[1:38:14] accusing and then who shall separate us
[1:38:17] as we can say who shall separate us from
[1:38:20] the love of Christ
[1:38:22] shall tribulation or
[1:38:25] distress or
[1:38:27] persecution or
[1:38:29] famine or nakedness or Peril or sword
[1:38:34] Romans
[1:38:35] 8:35 as it is written for thy sake we
[1:38:39] are killed all the day long we are
[1:38:40] accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[1:38:43] in all these things we are more than
[1:38:45] conquerors through him that loved us I
[1:38:48] am a predestinated son of God conformed
[1:38:52] to the image of Jesus Christ everything
[1:38:55] that he said I want to
[1:38:59] be for I am
[1:39:03] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:39:07] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:39:09] nor things present nor things to come
[1:39:12] nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:39:18] creature no
[1:39:20] church
[1:39:21] no Pastor no
[1:39:24] priest no
[1:39:29] one shall be able to separate us from
[1:39:32] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[1:39:35] our
[1:39:37] lord
[1:39:39] wonderful are you
[1:39:41] happy are you thankful that we are
[1:39:45] predestinated to conform to the image of
[1:39:49] Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:39:52] and as we're walking
[1:39:55] down friends as we're walking down this
[1:40:00] road that is laid before
[1:40:03] us and we're going and we may take a
[1:40:05] wrong turn and we got to get back to the
[1:40:09] to the road that God has set before us
[1:40:11] and we we go
[1:40:14] through look
[1:40:17] up don't look at the
[1:40:19] road look up and you can see the
[1:40:23] sign the
[1:40:26] sign and
[1:40:29] say that these are the last days the
[1:40:32] sign can say
[1:40:36] that in before the coming of the son of
[1:40:40] man it'll be in the it'll be like it was
[1:40:43] in
[1:40:44] Sodom it'll be like it was in the days
[1:40:46] of Noah it's a
[1:40:49] sign wow Lord the days of
[1:40:52] Sodom wow we're here the days of Noah
[1:40:55] the violence and everything that's going
[1:40:57] on we're
[1:40:58] here wow I'm looking at two signs right
[1:41:01] now there's there's there's Sodom and
[1:41:04] then there's Noah right here in the
[1:41:05] middle of them keep
[1:41:08] going with your eye on the
[1:41:11] cross knowing that you're on the right
[1:41:14] Road
[1:41:15] amen friends we
[1:41:19] are
[1:41:23] and a
[1:41:25] step that we
[1:41:27] have to get
[1:41:30] there there's many there's many stops on
[1:41:33] the road but one of the stops on the
[1:41:38] road is to say Lord I'm
[1:41:42] wrong Lord I Repent of my
[1:41:45] sins I have done I I have messed up I've
[1:41:49] I've done this and this and this this
[1:41:51] and this and you take those sins we've
[1:41:54] been going through the Old Testament God
[1:41:56] bless you Sister Erica good to see you
[1:41:58] um you take those
[1:42:00] sins that you have
[1:42:04] done we've been going through this Old
[1:42:06] Testament The Book of
[1:42:07] Leviticus Deuteronomy numbers you take
[1:42:11] these sin here is that innocent
[1:42:14] sacrifice you lay your
[1:42:18] sins on that sacrifice
[1:42:22] and then that sacrifice is
[1:42:24] killed you repent of your sins you go
[1:42:28] back and you say Lord I laid my sin on
[1:42:31] you once again once again I don't want
[1:42:33] to do it anymore and you start walking
[1:42:35] that narrow line always with your face
[1:42:39] up and looking towards Christ and then
[1:42:42] one of those steps after you repent
[1:42:46] after you
[1:42:48] repent then you are baptized in the name
[1:42:51] of Jesus Christ
[1:42:54] for the remission of those sins you're
[1:42:57] placing those sins right on the
[1:43:00] sacrifice and that's friends you just
[1:43:03] place them on it you don't have to jump
[1:43:05] through any Hoops you don't have to yeah
[1:43:07] you don't have to do all this Penance
[1:43:08] and all all of that you just lay them on
[1:43:10] Jesus Christ and he takes
[1:43:13] them and you make that commitment to
[1:43:16] serve
[1:43:17] him and one way one of the stops on that
[1:43:22] road is to be
[1:43:25] baptized to say

[1:43:30] past now I am going to make this step in
[1:43:34] front of these people I am going to be
[1:43:36] baptized in the name of your son Jesus
[1:43:39] Christ to show these people I am a
[1:43:42] different
[1:43:44] person and I am not going to sin anymore
[1:43:47] I'm going to do my
[1:43:48] best not to lay any more sins on that
[1:43:51] blessed that blessed
[1:43:55] sacrifice that's the stop along the road
[1:44:00] that we must
[1:44:03] take you may have been baptized
[1:44:07] before you may have never been
[1:44:10] baptized
[1:44:12] but if there was no
[1:44:15] repentance with that baptism or if there
[1:44:18] needs to be another repentance saying I
[1:44:20] am going to stop right now I am going to
[1:44:22] go right back I'm going to be on that
[1:44:24] road my mind my eyes will be on that
[1:44:27] cross my whole
[1:44:29] life it's a good time right now to be
[1:44:33] baptized and to make that commitment to
[1:44:36] walk in that path friends my whole
