and thank you for this service today and ask you to be with us in jesus name we pray amen you may be seated this evening before we sing this next song i just want to share a little thought that i lord had placed maybe on my heart the last few days and yesterday morning i think even before yesterday morning though last week or two i'd been thinking about this thought about many times we've come to church and you know i'm just speaking maybe just from my heart you think every service you know minister maybe wants the service to be special wants the prayer line or wants the people to respond in a certain way and and they have that desire on their heart to make an impact and you know sometimes maybe it could be feel like oh every service we we're lingering or we're staying and i just started thinking about that thought of every service we come and then i started thinking every day we dedicate our lives to to the lord and just want to draw closer to him and being the most important and i was sharing with the family last night family devotions we we have a meal every several times a day we we you know drink water several times a day we have all these other things we take care of our physical needs and maybe talk to other people and get you know emotional love or support or whatever but we just want to every day go spiritually before the lord and yesterday morning i wasn't feeling led to read my normal direction in my personal devotions and so i just opened the bible and i came to across one of these accounts in the gospels and i started reading the scriptures and just the parallels the different gospels and this just really struck out to me in luke chapter 9 verse 23 where jesus says and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man advantaged if he gained the whole world and lose himself or be cast away and i thought back in verse 23 there where it says take up his cross daily even i was talking to sister shirley moore right before service and she made the comment every service coming expecting every service and then i'd been thinking about every day in this verse where he says take up my take up your cross daily and i know a couple sundays ago i think maybe a week and a half ago i was leading service song service on sunday morning and we sang the song near the cross a lot of times that's maybe a song we sing maybe on a communion night or it's an older song and we don't think maybe we just think it's just a song and maybe sitting through the motions of it and then brother matthew saying it sunday night and it's just the last week and a half it's just been i just keep singing this song and just start coming to me more and more and more real and more more alive that cross is so real and we sometimes maybe and singing this song we'll take it for granted but i just like this song tonight we're going to play a tape portion of a tape this evening brother aaron felt led to do a spoken word as the original seed probably about an hour starting right after right when brother branham prays so just the thought before we start the sermon we could sing this song and just really dedicate our lives and just be wanted in that cross amen so let's just sing that song jesus keep me near the cross jesus keep [Music] me near the cross there [Music] precious fountain free to all uh [Music] in the crossing the cross be my glory [Music] near the cross a trembling soul love [Music] shed its beams [Music] in the cross be my glory [Music] the river near the cross oh lamb [Music] it seems before me help [Music] is [Music] in the cross be my glory ever till my right shirt [Music] who near the cross i'll watch [Music] being trusted till i reach the golden strand just is the cross be my glory till my rapture soul shall find rest beyond the rich [Music] oh jesus has changed my whole life oh if anybody asks you just [Music] jesus has changed my whole life if anybody asks you just who i am until then i am redeemed let's stand this evening oh i jesus has changed my whole life if anybody asks you just who i am [Music] before we start the tape [Music] i mentioned the wrong sermon this evening christ is the mystery of god revealed as the sermon will be listening to this evening i think that's the one that was actually on my mind because i'd listened to it [Music] this morning for about an hour and a half before i knew he was going to play it and i just mentioned it incorrectly let's sing the song only believe all things are possible only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only believe now i believe one time now i believe now i believe [Music] all things are possible now i believe [Music] now believe now i believe all things are possible brother branham is going to start a prayer he's probably not going to dis seat the people after the prayer but if you want to remain standing for the prayer and then just be seated right after the prayer that would be just fine amen the church that they should hold together with god's unchanging hand their absolute the word warning them as paul warned his flock that there be wolves enter in you're the same god today as you were then and that enemy is the same may this fellowship and bonds of love always exist amongst these people in christ jesus help this morning lord as we read the word may the holy spirit reveal it to us that the church might be fully established in the faith that was once delivered to the saints to hold them and may as you gave the vision some two years ago to store up the food fine healthy looking vegetables that i saw in the vision being stored here in this tabernacle may we today receive a whole barrel full of that granite lord our tape load that it might reveal jesus christ to us in the hour that we live to give us sustaining strength spiritual strength for the task that lays ahead granted father bless these thy children they're in here this morning from many different parts of the nation a hot sticky morning but yet we feel the presence of the holy spirit and all this we think of john wesley and calvin and sinki and knox finney and many of those even without electric fan or people set in halls and perspiration running down their faces the women well covered and dressed set in the audiences and perspired till their clothing was soaking wet listening to the word of god feeding their souls now we feel are that they're at rest some hurry under waiting the coming of the lord keep us together father let the holy spirit guide us and direct us give us long life of service for you give us this great message this morning that we're expecting out of thy word that it might go to each heart make the lips that speak lord speak truth make the heart that years be fertile to receive truth amen i may it grow into great trees of eternal life to be shining lights and red epistles of all man they might know that jesus christ has raised from the dead and lives among us make us so full of love in the fruit of the spirit until other men and women boys and girls can see the results of the life of christ still living in us after two thousand years from the great event granted father to honor thee we asked in jesus christ's name amen now i want to read some of the scriptures and i trust now that you've got your pencils and papers and everything ready and brother neville you're sitting still i'm just going to take my coat off excuse me for taking off my coat but this this is a awfully warm up here now i want you to return to the book of colossians the first chapter of clothing and then while we read this beginning with i want you when you go home to read the entire chapter of these colossians but i want you to read this morning with me from the 15th verse uh 29th inclusive and i'll just be as patient as you can or i feel that in this year if god will help me we'll reveal and bring into your mind all these other things that i have talked on all through the days of the tabernacle why i have said what i've said and why i have done what i have done this is why now from the 15th verse who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth visible invisible where they be thrones dominions principalities powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the primitive for it please the father that in him should be all fullness dwell should all fullness dwell let me put a little emphasis on that again this 19th verse for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things and to himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven watch where that reconciliation went and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works you now has he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable approval in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and not be moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven world of i paul made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is bound behind all the affections of christ and flesh for his body sake which is the church whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hidden from age and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints i want to read that verse again even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man and all wisdom that we might present every man perfect in christ jesus or unto i also labor striving according to the working which worketh in me mightily now for a text i want to take out of there this for a text basically upon the entire bible but i want to title this christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god reveal now i talk it in order as a sunday school lesson so we could all read together and and uh have this fellowship together now god's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive and doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star atom molecule or anything he was god but he exactly wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him was to be father in him was to be son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels and then they worshipped him and that made him god and he started from there as in previous messages i have tried to explain it break it down and now then when angels begin to worship him that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there was no sun there's no moon no stars no nothing then he was god as he asked job where was you when i laid the foundations of the world i think when the morning stars sang together the sons of god shouted for joy now where were you see that's way back before the earth now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living praise the lord then you will understand clearly then you see on uh i believe what is being done god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh uh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence jesus when he was on earth they won't know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's gonna happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret that's reason there was silence in heaven for a space for a half hour and seven thunders earth their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the the believers in the bible has been entitled and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it and god's help you see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and then try to bring it to the people see and then you don't i haven't went into details to try to explain it as god has revealed it to me now if you want to mark this down i've got so many places i want to read from and now in in the book of saint luke the 24th chapter of saint luke we find out it's it is the two of the apostles on the road to emmaus and jesus stepped out after his resurrection and they were on the road to over to emmaus going along the road thinking and talking and weeping on account of israel his death and how they seen him suffer for what they thought was of no value at all they took their lord and crucified him and and they were going along that weeping and he stepped out from the roadside and begin to talk to them about christ he said oh fools and slow to understand don't you know that all the prophets and the psalms see what was he doing identifying himself to these apostles that all of the prophets and all of the psalms and everything was him expressed see and now the reason i never talked to preach this morning was because i thought in teaching we would understand it better than just to take a text and skip over it we just uh teach it he was saying that all the psalms and all the prophets spoke of him well therefore that shows that all of the old testament all of the new testament and all of the psalms the singing the songs that were sung were sung of him take the 22nd psalm and sing it and compare it with the morning of the crucifixion see my god my god why has thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me they pierce my feet and my hands yet all those things are them singing that psalm down there in the temple and crucifying the very onesie see those great religious leaders those great man those great teachers and yet so blinded that was reading the prophets and was singing the songs and doing the crime that they said they would do the same thing is taking place this morning now listen close because i ain't going to even pay attention to what that clock says i want you to get this so you can see here basically in the beginning the very thought that god had in his mind he hid it from all of those scholars and just a number a selected predestinated number a predestinated people was the only ones that heard it i now search back the scripture down through the age of the prophets and see if it wasn't the same thing now and jesus here referring them to the prophets and the psalms he said they all spoke of him see and here these jewish teachers rabbis doctors of the law professors have did exactly like they had done before now notice again he said search the scriptures for they are they that testify of me search the scriptures the scriptures the entire scriptures what am i trying to do to show you that this bible is the thing that's right the other day standing in a hospital room talking a sister had asked me to explain about the nominations why we was against denominations uh with some denominational people you see it's got to come back to the word because the word is god and jesus declaring the same here that the word is him you can't make the scripture contradict itself in the beginning was the word awards with god and the word was god and the word made flesh amen now here he says search the scriptures they testify me in them you think you have eternal life and that's true and they are the ones that bear record of me and i'm bearing record of them and if i do not the works has promised that i would do then don't hear me but if i do the works and you can't believe me believe the works because they testify that he is the word oh it looks like it couldn't be any plainer thing all right now search the scriptures he said moses and all the laws and so forth and the prophets and psalms spoke of him and again he said the scriptures testify of him he is the principal theme of the entire bible if you read the bible and don't see christ in every verse of it go back and read it again if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible then you read it again because you missed something the bible is christ he is the word when you read in the beginning god created there's christ see every from that to the amen in revelations is every word testifying of jesus christ that's why these added books that are called the second book of daniel in uh the book of the maccabees uh adds purgatory and stuff like that see it's not spoken of in the scripture see it doesn't theme up with the rest of it there's no place to place purgatory in there there's no place to place intersection of saints and things there's no place in there for that there's no place for denomination there's no place for for creeds outside of the bible so when you see those things they just don't come into the picture and that's why people has added those and got their their their jigsaw puzzle all mixed up man they can't make it right same yesterday and forever but if the things put together right there's the entire picture of the fall and regeneration the whole picture of creation god's whole plan revealed right in jesus christ amen that's the whole picture set together every little crooked corner it's just like no i don't mean to be sacrilegious for this but it's just like putting a jigsaw puzzle together that's why we got pictures today it looks horrible say we are believers the cow picking grass up on top of the tree don't work that's when they say he's ever way but just of a certain same yesterday and forever all but a certain thing see then you ruin your picture the bible said he is the same amen saint john 5 or saint john 14 12 he said he he anybody he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also well that was for another age there you got your picture wrong again you got a man fishing out in the desert for fish and a bunch of hot saying well there's no fish i had see see you've got to bring him back to where he's fishing at galilee where there's plenty of fish you see you you got to make the picture look right it's god's great picture and there's only one way you'll see it that when you see jesus christ there's the entire bible he's the principal theme of the bible now you realize that any of these places here you could take a text it's just hard for a preacher to hold his peace you look like you want to keep going with it but you've got to get back to what we're teaching on the bible is a prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find christ he was in the prophets he was in the psalms he was in the history and he also in the bible is the things that is to come so he was before and after what does that making then the same yesterday today and forever and you inject something in there that doesn't make him the same yesterday and forever brother lee where do you go to you got an awful picture there for he was the history see and he is the prophet he is the psalms he is everything and if you can't make him everything and the same what's your picture look like do you see it all right he is the thing he was the prophets he was in them he was in the psalms he was in the history and he is the things to come the same yesterday and forever hebrews 13 8 if you're writing it down he should be then he should be the principal if that's what he is and we believe it don't we yes amen then if he is that then he should be the principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of the bible and the bible is in us then he should be the principal theme of everything that we do say our thing amen should be christ amen is that right all right since we think this since he's been made the head of all things to us that colossians said so here he's the head of all things to us for he was made for us which we are considered all things he said what about the sinner he was made to be the judge of the sinner if he don't accept it he was made the glory for the believer who does accept it so their thing all things was made by him and for him and it takes a night to express the glory of the day it takes the vessel of dishonor to express the the love and care for the vessel of the honor it takes an evil woman that would wear immoral clothes and and cellar morals to express the virtue of a decent genuine lady it takes a crook and a thief in a man to express the genuineness of a real believer a real christian it takes the hypocrite to show up the believer what he is so all things was made by him and since he was made all thing made for all of us all things was made far by him then since that is true we should make our identification should be with him we should be identified ourselves with him because he has identified himself with us we should be identified with him how by living for him not just a confession so many people take a confession say i say it's got to this place now are you a christian i'm methodist oh that's a long ways from being making yourself known as a christian or look what the methodist does i'm baptist look what the baptist does i'm catholic look what they do see but the only way that you can actually be a christian is for christ to identify himself in you how we got some a stinger there i hope everybody on the tape gets that too see you say i'm pentecostal that don't mean a thing it's christ identified in you that's when he has recognized you so i spoke of tongues devils does too i shouted the mohammedans buddhas and everything shouts the indians scream at the snake danes there are they all do cults clans and everything else scream and holly holler and shallow the baseball game but when christ is identified in you identifying himself saying you are christ-like which the word christian means to be christ-like there's your identification all right now and since he is our identification then we should be identified with him by living for him notice god has had a threefold purpose in this great mystery secret god in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he's got a threefold purpose in it and now what we want to go up on this morning is what is that threefold purpose now i believe by the help of the of god who's present and he he'll show it to us um now if he had this threefold purpose we want to find out what is this threefold purpose the first thing was that god wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great jehovah god who covered all space time and eternity he could not is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did began that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of life space and on out into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is yes but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood or he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son a man that's reason jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he's talking about many of them but now you get it he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in christ secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people now he could do that in adam and eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again oh my oh no this this is rich to me just even think of it see see what god's purpose was now why didn't he just keep adam and eve like that then he would never been able to express his fullness his full attribute because he could be a father there that's true but also he's a savior you say how do you know he was he is because i've had the experience amen he is a savior and he had to express that and how could he do it only through christ how could he be a son only through christ how could he be a healer only through christ see all things were wound up in that one person jesus christ oh my goodness when i when i think of it i i just see denominations passed off the scene everything else is going to when i see god's great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of godhead bodily into a people that he could have the premises the oversight the leading another tonight if you didn't get the tape i preached there one night on a prisoner of jesus christ paul a prisoner see when god gets you to be his prisoner then you can't do nothing but what the spirit says do paul with all his great intellects he taught he was taught by gramalia to be a great a priest or rabbi someday and he had high invasions he was intellectually a great man great authority great man in the nation but he had to sacrifice every bit of it to become part of the word to express jesus christ he knowed what it was to say uh he had an ocean to go someplace some brethren he called him but he was forbidden by the spirit to do his own will oh if if people have spiritual can pick that up he was forbidden to do his own will he only could do the spirit forbid me he was a prisoner to christ then this little fortune teller one day who you know paul know he had power to cast that devil out but he could only do it as god willed it day after day she followed him crying out after him but one day the spirit gave him permission then he rebuked her the spirit that was in her see he knowed what it was to be a prisoner moses his intellectuals he had to lose them in order to find christ to be a prisoner that when god got all the world beat out of him and all these mighty man that he wasn't standing the presence of that pillar of fire that day he was found speechless he didn't even couldn't even talk he said god had a prisoner then see you won't try it to your own searching then god had to do this man endowing with power enough that he could go down there and he said lord i told pharaoh what you said he wouldn't do he said then take this thou rock god speaking that's god's word go out there and point it towards the east he called for flies and flies come into creation because he had a prisoner that pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing nobody else could turn him knowing he was a complete prisoner in the chains of god's word bound up only to thus saith the lord oh god can get prisoners like that now that's when he can express the preeminences you see he he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but christ you get what i mean all right that's secondly first to express himself completely god in christ second to have the premises by this in his church which is his body of the bride to he could have the premise to express himself through them all right and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool evening with his people talked with them fellowship with them and now sin and death had separated them from his presence and his entire expression do you read it before the foundational world to express all of his his his attributes what he was therefore if any trinitarian here well just let yourself loose a minute you can see that father son and holy ghost is not three gods it's three attributes of the same god it's expression father he was who wanted to be a father he was a father he was the son and he is the holy ghost and the father and the holy ghost is the same spirit don't you see you get it not three gods the devils told you them things to make an idolatry out of you it's one god expressed in three attributes to be father to be savior to be son to be healer see his expressions i want to coast just a little bit so that even people listening to the table get the idea that can see it would take me around around that clock just each one of those subjects but i hope i'm making it clear enough that you can see what i'm coming to god expressed in jesus christ who was both father son and holy god the fullness of the godhead volley now the complete fullness of the goddamn volley dwells in his church the preeminence amen all that god was he poured into christ all christ was poured into the church the believers not denomination we'll get to that in a few minutes and it'll take out your mind forever show you what causes that by the help of god if he'll just permit it to us what's his purpose now express himself as a son see and now that in here might draw the fullness of the godhead bodily i've got claushes laying here right before me that all through the scripture that's what god's purpose was then through this life of this son his cross of blood it says you're of his cross that he might reconcile to himself a body a bride which is eve second eve and god give it in a type like he did moses and all of the same thing he did in adam and eve given a type that they were christ and the bride he is the second adam the church is the second eve and as long as the second eve compromises against the word isn't she doing the same thing the first eve did trying to say it well it was for some other age and we'll get to that in a few minutes whether he said that it was for another age how can it be another age when he is the same yesterday today and forever but god has purposed that and hid it from the eyes of the prudent and wise and reveal it to the predestinated babes who are predestinated to receive it that's reason watch down through the age whenever that light hits them they turn it away and flashed it away and great intellectuals and i'm great priests standing there there's rabbis from great teachers and authority like different ones like nicodemus them the man polishing scholarship and he couldn't even understand it and there was those great priests stood out there and rabbis who were taught in that word my they knowed it intellectually and he said you are of your father the devil and it is works you'll do think of it holy man you couldn't but your finger nowhere on their life or their father's life or their grandfather's life or their great great great great great grandfather's life if they did they died and shame is stoned to death but he understands jesus calling that group a bunch of devils religious people now oh the great revelation now now to restore back his kinship to bring back now he had to let them get lost you understand it he had to let them sin put them all free more he he could not make them sin and remain god and then punish him for something he made him do but when he put man on partnership with him then let man act as a free moral agent see the same thing he's got you on today see you act any way you want to you're free mortal asian so therefore if he put the first like that he has to put the second like that he has put everyone like that or he acted wrong in the first place but everybody is on that same basis now notice him and bringing that back and letting that man do that and knowing that he would do it nobody would do it but what did it do it displayed his attribute as savior and the whole purpose that is left in jesus christ to become god himself to take the penalty of his own law death to die to redeem the wife that was lost by rejecting him when eve went away from the word she went away from her mate and when the church goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornications with the world of man's wisdom rejecting the authority of god's word that sound clear the bible said committing spiritual fornication any word in the bible that's rejected or has any self-interpretation put to it is absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the god that is your husband amen an adulteress never enters the kingdom of heaven we know that now see that's what eve done at the first place i notice again now what's his threefold purpose manifest himself in jesus christ to come into the body by jesus christ to have the premises so what restore back eden bring back that which lost that's the only thing out of order all the rest of these things was in order but he had to let put man on pre-moral agency to fall so that he might be a savior to display what's in him see his attribute of savior something had to be lost and the very thing that man fell and become lost he become the savior of that taking his own law and he could not do it he's that great jehovah that covered all space time see he couldn't do anything he had to become a man and he took kinship with the man that was lost amen and become a man god made flesh hallelujah i think i'm excited but i'm not something inside god it came from god to become me to take my sin upon him that he might make me him amen back to his great purpose of sons and daughters of god for he is a eternal father that attribute was in him see so that had to be displayed now see the whole threefold purpose see to express himself he wants to become i the the world is lost now he has to express himself in a man to become a savior through the reconciliation of the blood from his cross i had to become that to die in order to save and to bring himself back into the church to have the preeminences in his church now remember it can not and will not and never will be and never has been a denomination he has to have the perimeter system he is the word amen how can any creed be injected in there it's a it turns the church into a prostitute to take any man's words of any creator any denomination if it quickly is marked in revelation 17 as a in harlots the roman catholic church being the and the protestants being a harlot exactly as clear as any person could read it we've come through the church ages and you can see that in those those tapes if you desire exactly then anything that joins itself with a creed outside of the bible is the in the sight of god done the same thing eve did god away from the word which is christ oh my god all right now we see his mystery he had hid in his mind before the foundation of the world now would you just like to read a little of this let's just read it uh if you've got plenty time we'll we'll read it now let's just all turn just for one reading anyhow to um the book of ephesians and let's begin at the the first chapter of the ephesians to read and now as the sunday school lesson goes on now in this threefold manifestation of christ let's read paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god now watch it's not addressed to the world but to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus how do you get into christ jesus by joining church by birth by one spirit first corinthians 12 we are all baptized into one body right that's the ones he's talking to that he addressed the outside world we can't talk to the center on this because he knows nothing about it paul didn't address it to no sinners he said this is to that that group there that's in christ jesus grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings we're bound in heavenly places in christ heavenly places oh how which had time you've got it marked i hear my bible about heavenly places what is heavenly places heavenly places just for a moment is a believer's position in christ where the believer stands in christ in heavenly places according as he has chosen us listen close chosen us in him before the foundation of the world when did he choose us before the foundation of the world when his great hidden mystery his great secret he chose us in christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in what love having what predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will predestinated there's the mystery he before christ or anything else is ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand now you see a secret what too to restore fallen eve as she was a pre-figure of the church and now notice as god opened up the side of adam and took out e by his own flesh and blood and divided his spirit from masculine and feminists to finish and put it in eve took the rib from under his side and made eid out of it so god did the same thing amen taken out of the side of christ the blood and the water and christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church eve see back to himself again redeemed by the blood that was coming from his body you see it now amen great mystery that being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but prefigured it all the way down through now what we find that he that he did that here in ephesians and many other places but that'll give you enough to now down through the ages he has been slowly unfolding this mystery can you see now now down to the how did he what happened in the pre-figure now he opened adam's side and took part of his flesh which was adam to make eve the bride has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on creeds she cannot stand on denomination she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she's part of it she was taken from christ and to be sure that the whole rapture now luther was apart wesley was apart the prophets was apart if there aren't a part just in the revelation they was making up the body feet toes arms and so forth until the head which we get to that in a few minutes see that makes the entire rapture it's the body of the word which is christ hey man outside of that your loss i don't care how good you are what your relationship is or what your fellowship is or what your organization is you're lost outside of that word being in you if ye abide in me the word my word abide in you then you ask what you will because you in the world are the same he has the preeminences he's got the rulership you're you're a prisoner to him the world is dead you have nothing more you see the rest of people living the way they do but yet you do not do it you're a prisoner you're yoked with him my yoke is easy yoked with christ with his word i do that only which pleases the father and if you can't believe that i am he then believe the word so perfect notice notice now down through the ages he's been gradually letting us out slowly unfolding the mystery through the prophets and through the times now we can just go on to that expressing himself he expressed himself in moses look at moses born in a time of persecution of the children he was born to be a deliverer he was hidden in the bull rushes just like jesus was taken down into egypt he came out he went up on the mountain come back with the commandments jesus went up to the mountain his first sermon sermon on the mount come back down with the commandments you heard him say to him of old times i shall commit adultery i said you look upon a woman who lust after her has committed adultery lawgiver priest king leader just exactly expressed himself in joseph born amongst denomination his brethren they hated him without a cause because he was spiritual he saw visions god was with him he could interpret dreams and his brothers hated him he was sold for all by his brethren but almost 30 pieces of silver just exactly like he was sold by a judas's carrot one of his brethren about 30 pieces of silver he's sowed into a ditch and supposed to been dead that's right the father and them was told that he was dead and he stole him into this ditch taken up and went to the right hand of pharaoh in the dungeon how he suffered there and and there was two saved the butler and the baker one of them lost and one saved brother and uh the butler one of them was lost and the others say just as on the cross when he was in his prison house attacked to the cross for our sins we become a prisoner one thief was lost and one was saved and just exactly then he become at the right hand of pharaoh the king that he dreamed and had the vision he was set at the king's feet and all authority in egypt was given to him his vision had to come to pass he might have stuttered of it many times while he was in that prison down there his whiskers growing out and so forth but he studied that someday his vision had to come to pass so it lingers got to happen as i spoke last night or not wednesday night you're at the service see it has to happen when god says so it's got to happen it's a vindicated prophet and it has to come to pass because it's god's word and the word comes only to the prophet the word prophet means a revealer of the divine written word as same as it does the fourth teller there's seer notice and the seer how the one yours telling forth he's divinely vindicated by foreseeing and it comes to pass if there be one whose prophet will speak to you and tell you certain things is going to happen and if it don't happen don't listen to him but if it does happen then i'm with him you better fear him because i am with him you see that's there's the vindication there where you know where it's the truth or whether it is god is speaking back to his word to his people by people see god only speaks through man i am the buying year of the branches of vine doesn't bear fruit the branches talk bears the fruit of the vine notice it's always been that way now we find joseph then that when no man could touch or come to pharaoh without first seeing joseph no man can come to the father only by the son and when joseph left the throne the sound of trumpets every knee bow joseph is coming forth glory someday every knee will bow and every tongue will confess when he leaves the throne of his father see to come forth everybody will bear witness that he's the son of god you're either years too late then do it now yes amen now we notice that through the types we could take even david as he spoke up a while ago going off his throne rejected by his own people going up the same mountain mount of olives as is going over to his prison he was going to his prison house because he was rejected of his brethren and all his own people he went up weeping that was the spirit of christ in him to be rejected as you looked up over jerusalem and went and said jerusalem how often a rejected king 800 years later the son of david stood on jerusalem up there above jerusalem rejected and wept over jerusalem it said now your hour has come that's right all those saints typing just in type but yet the mystery was he that man didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation but expressing it express himself and moses and david and joseph and elijah and all down through you we could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and show and express jesus christ perfectly exactly yet never giving his secret in full waiting for to make it known in the last days waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it if he told the whole thing because the bible's written in mysteries jesus thanked the father fart see that it was ruled in mysteries now the coming of the lord is in mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming see and so is all the mysteries of god waiting for this last day after he's already been completed then he reveals and shows what he's done oh my never gave his mystery and four it's just like this comparing the seven seals now when god used martin luther for the coming out for that first church of that church age they want to use uh john wesley and he gradually uh brought them out and was revealing in them that church age when we went goes back through the bible now and find out but in the last days the reason that was such a tremendous thing that he spoke up here and showed those seven thunders and looked like my life magazine that packed that circle of a cloud and light there that they could not understand and don't know it yet but here telly go there and wait for these mysteries to be revealed in here months before it happened and then it happened it exactly the way he said it would do did you notice in that picture even that arranged on the right when he's being materialized coming down with his wings back his head sitting sideways there it is right there in the picture just exactly months before it happened told here that he's going to bring the body of believers together to reveal take up them lost in here come luther through he only preached justification just pound it away in that age he didn't know what the age was here come wesley through and he pounded his age through see a lot of our faults come from it the other church is raising up and here come pentecost pounding away they organized went right back into death again as we'll get to in a few minutes right back in depth and then comes a revelation of the mystery to reveal what it's all been about where are these little doctrines like luther brought out catechism and everything else and wesley brought this set and the other and these other things and pentecost brought organization just the same and father son holy ghost baptism and things not knowing any different cause then come back in the last days and pick up all these mysteries and clearly explain it reveal it why it's all the last days when this great mystery that god had in his heart is being revealed do you get it if you fail come back to this tape again i don't know how much longer i'll be with you remember this is the truth of thus saith the lord it's the truth it's a scripture amen amen he says come back to this tape and listen to it again and i was it's amazing how god does those things i began to hear it maybe a month ago and i'd hear a portion and i'd go back and hear it again i'd read a portion and then i'd hear it too it just became so real so living and i was speaking to brother dan evans the other day and he says that's a tape i just finished i said brother jordan we're going to play this tape today and he goes that's the one i was studying this morning it's christ in us the hope of glory you know and it's just as brother brown begins to speak the names moses and this one they go and in today's he's speaking your name you have your part to play you have your portion to do a live life today so many are looking back to those that were back there and what's coming up but what about you and me today oh what a savior and that he would love to do that for us he knew me yet he loved me how much he loved us he knew me [Music] [Applause] oh he whose glory makes [Music] oh so unworthy of such [Applause] when he was on the cross i was on his mind one more time he knew me and yet he loved me oh heals glory makes the heavens shine of such mercy when he was on the cross i was on his mind to think that he knew what eve was going to do and how adam was going to take his place next to her to redeem her back because it was something he was going to do and express that knowing that you and i would need a savior he said i'll be that one i'll give my life and you get there in gethsemane and he's he's kneeling there in the in that physical body and he's asking his father he said father is there another way to do this is there another way for this to be accomplished without me having to go through that and and brother branham and it just really went a place where he says it's up to you son god is being it's your choice you're going to have to make and he says not my will but your will be done on how much how much we thank god that he stood today let's stand amen what a savior nobody like him there's just nobody like him and you know but he was thinking of you you were on his mind he knew you were part of that brother branham says away in the back part of his mind you were part of that brother branham uses the word predestinated and he says i know that that stumbles somebody he said but it's his foreknowledge he knew he knows all things he wasn't going as we've heard well i like you but i don't like you no no no he knew the decision each one of us would make he knew that today he would say lord that's me i have a call back to that amen appreciate that of our lord lord we we just want to say thank you this message christ is a mystery of god reveal about four hours long but just listening to it and hearing your prophet he was just a man also a man called to to to minister to to take this and and open and and unveil the scriptures not him but you through him using that voice lord and the excitement and the joy in his life to see that he was included that and that's us today lord to see that we're included in that our name is written there also you said you would not lose a single one those whose names are written in the palms of your hand lord you
