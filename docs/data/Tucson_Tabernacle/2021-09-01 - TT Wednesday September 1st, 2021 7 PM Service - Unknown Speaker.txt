to learn how to use the alarm on your on your phone so that you don't burn the house down i left a pot of water going and forgot all about it until it burned the pot and smoked the house and so she set the alarm for me and i watched it for 15 minutes it was going to take 15 minutes whether i watched it or not but lord teach me to wait but wait patiently trusting believing so we have some requests to bring to your attention brother dan evans asked prayer for his cousin brother daniel his name is uh ronald evans he's back in jeffersonville he's in intensive care and on a ventilator with covet he's 48 years old and he has his children so i spoke with brother matt watkins or text and their family had been exposed to covid so they were going to have to be tested and possibly quarantine they don't know for sure so i also spoke with brother robert he did not have an update on brother richard wilson neither better or worse but his serious he was seriously ill so brother ray erickson i heard the other day when i was listening to one of their services brother ray had been quite sick so i called him up today and he said he was feeling much better it's something that affected his stomach and but he appreciated our prayers so we'll continue and just thinking of i've not heard an update on sister sarah roberts has anybody heard anything but we'll continue to remember them in prayer and i was thinking about brother jordan and sister martha as they travel especially with this storm working its way back back there and all those that are traveling our outlets so we'll remember that so and i'll ask you to remember me tomorrow morning at nine i go to a surgeon's office to [Music] i've had a growth on my back up high for quite some time but it never bothered me and recently it began to get quite painful and and infected and all and i was crawling inside a cabinet to do some work and i put it right into the top of the cabinet and it hurt and so it started doing that so yesterday they actually opened it and cleaned it out but the doctor recommended that i get it removed so we'll see a surgeon tomorrow and i know who the master surgeon is i i know that but brother random also tells us that god uses doctors so we just pray that all will be well and you have a need say lord i believe and sometimes we do have to say lord help down my unbelief too so if you'll stand with me just bow our heads lord we come to you and these bodies the physical body the natural body the man body are not eternal but there's an eternal life within us lord and we're believing that lord we're we're looking for a change to leave this old corruption behind and step into that new body even the creation today cries out oh they're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god lord and we believe that lord now each hand that was raised in each request that was asked lord and every heart that's represented those listening in maybe however they're attuned to the service today lord will you minister to each one of them lord as you know best lord and we'll be careful to say thank you and we love you lord jesus in jesus christ's name amen amen a couple of announcements and then we'll be turning the service over to brother dan evans but brother peter sister lydia had a little boy eight o'clock into this morning brother peter was hoping it would because it was his birthday yesterday so both doing well and um myself and the girls were at the dinner table and we were trying to guess his name because there was some hints along the line of it so when i was talking to brother peter and i said uh i know one of the names and he goes how did you guess it and i said mcfadden it's pretty not that hard that left but zion daniel mcfadden he was like nine pounds over nine pounds of a big boy but they're both doing well talking about peter so i appreciate that so and then again this sunday lord willing will have service here we'll be ministering and then next wednesday night i'd like to have a prayer service as we are preparing for the following sunday with brother matthew watkins so if you can't be here be in prayer at home just say lord you you lead us you guide us you direct us and then lord willing the week the september the 12th which would be oh my okay yeah i don't know how those things work some get the boys some get the girls but lord knows best so but um next sundays or the sun september the 12th again brother matthew mcfadden wants to express his heart to the church so lord willing that will take place i'm so good at getting them all wrong the girls tell me dad you have to make one brother matt the other one brother matthew and i said i try hard but it never works so but you knew who i meant right you don't want to be the pastor is that what you're saying i appreciate everyone that assists and comes and and puts their part in in in service it's a blessing i sometimes our group is small and but he had a brother visit us one time he says my i'd love to have this in our church because we don't have anywhere near this many so sometimes we get to thinking well there's hardly any of us but god is good to us so amen so only believe all things are possible how many knows that's true all things [Music] all things are possible all [Music] all things are possible oh and now let's testify lord i believe oh lord i believe [Music] lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i will leave [Music] god bless you all let's say a word prayer heavenly father we thank you for the opportunity to come together lord we never want to take it for granted that we are able to assemble ourselves and father be together and have you in our midst lord we thank you for your presence may you continue to be with us tonight father may all the words that i speak may they be pleasing to you and father may they be a blessing to your children here tonight in jesus name i pray amen amen you can take your seats i appreciate y'all praying for my cousin um ronald is uh he and i grew up together and went in high school together and uh he's just a couple years younger than me and it's such an it's such an odd time that i had coveted about a year ago and and i had a headache for a couple days and a stuffy nose and my cousin has it and and he's in intensive care and they they um he kept getting worse and worse and worse and they went to put the ventilator into him and his heart stopped and they were able to revive him and that happened yesterday and they were able to revive him and uh it's it's it's such a strange disease when have you ever seen a disease that can just give one person a stuffy nose and then put another person on a ventilator and another person just kill him i work with someone that a friend of hers was 33 years old and she got covered and had a heart attack and died healthy healthy girl so it's such an odd time but i think it's it's indicative of the the world that we live in today and and what's going on is such a strange time we see all these things happening overseas and we see this disease and we see the politics of the world friends i don't believe it's ever been like this it's such a strange thing and even in my own personal life what's happened to me over the past year with with the cut with the shutdown and how kovid came in and we all started working from home and then i got bitten by a spider and the thing i had i had 103 temperature for three days i spent three days in the hospital the um the surgeon came in and said we need to operate right now and took a a chunk the size of a baseball out of my leg and and then then i i got this crazy disease while i was in the hospital from all the all of the antibiotics they gave me and that was worse as an intestinal disease and that was worse than the spider bite and and then uh then i quit my job and then i got covered and then i moved to tucson kind of um in the process and and uh we'll we'll be here in the next couple months permanently and then my dad died and then my daughter got married and then i'm a preacher now and that's what's what's crazy is the last one is the strangest part about everything and my mother-in-law there she can she can attest that's the truth so it's it's an odd time and it but it's an exciting time we see god doing things and he's moving and i look at this little church here and like i said last time wednesday nights to me i love it because these are the pillars in the church these are the ones that hold up the church they're the ones with their attendance with with their efforts that they give with the deacons the trustees the the people that come this is the core and it's an honor to speak to you on this wednesday night to speak to the elders in the church to the pillars in the church and and i love wednesday nights it's it's an exciting time to me because of who i'm who i'm talking to we uh we're seeing in the world today we see all of the of these the different politics going on and we see the churches the churches are taking these sides and they're dividing themselves and sometimes you have you have these mega churches that they don't really believe anything you know and they're going and just oh everything's good and just come in and be happy and and all this and then you see you see these other churches and they divide and they separate and the denominations are pretty much a thing of the past now now it's just it's just churches and against other churches and we're looking even to the message and we see the division that's going on and everyone has their own ideas and if you don't follow that idea then you're out and and it's it's and they're willing to enforce those ideas and i am i ministered a couple weeks ago on the book of daniel and how in daniel chapter 2 excuse me in daniel chapter 2 that the king had this dream nebuchadnezzar had this dream and it really troubled him and he he goes and he calls all of all of the holy men in babylon and he says now listen i had this dream it's a big deal i want you to i want you to come and i want you to interpret this dream for me and of course the holy men are like great we can do that but he said but there's a catch he said i'm not going to tell you the dream you've got to tell me the dream and if you don't tell me the dream you're going to die i'm going to kill you and all of your friends with you so this decree went out and and everybody was upset well it finally got to daniel and daniel comes and to make a long story short daniel comes and he interprets the dream of nebuchadnezzar and nebuchadnezzar it really impressed him brother while it would be like the man in the pulpit saying your name is this you live at this address you're this you're this be healed in the name of jesus and then go into the next one the next one next one so the king saw this and it really impressed him so what he did is he had in his mind what this holy man was and he built this giant image with this holy man in mind he built this giant image and he says this is what this holy man is and he he put it up in a province in babylon and he said everyone look at this image and that is this holy man but the fact is that was not real that was just an idea that the king had of this holy man and there's daniel over here living his life praying three times a day making mistakes doing the best that he can trying as hard as he could and the king because he had in his mind what this was he erected this image and made people worship it we know we know the story so we see that and we see it so common in the world today we see the democrats and the republicans this is the image of the country and we see we see the message churches well we have you have you have to listen to tapes only you can't have a minister in the pulpit and then we have over here saying no you can't listen to tapes it's the five-fold ministry that perfects the bride we we have to have that then over here you say no no it's the seven thunders that are perfecting the bride we need to get that and all of these and friends so often they're images that we've created in our mind because the way we've been raised the way we've been taught in church and we raise these images in our mind and they're not real and then we cut other people out because it doesn't match our image i got a phone call one one time from a catholic priest and this priest got a hold of brother branham's message and uh he um it impressed him he started listening more more and uh he had a good sized parish i can't remember if it was in philadelphia or new york had a real eastern accent but he started integrating brother brown's message into his sermon because it's real he saw something that was real in this man so he started integrating this message into his sermons and then friends what happened one day is a lady he said she was in the back stood up and spoke in tongues now this is a catholic church you got peter over here and mary over here and you've got all this gold and all this weirdness and there is a lady speaking in tongues and what he did is in that sermon he said that is correct according to the bible and he continued on and these gifts started manifesting themselves in his church but they weren't the image that he had in his mind that the church had in their mind and many of the people and they were like this isn't right this isn't right this isn't one what i grew up with this isn't our church this is this is different and they told on him the powers to be kicked him out and he told me he said brother he said i love being a priest he said i loved the people he said but they kicked me out and what they did is that church and that denomination god gave them a gift the gift started to come and what they did is they put up their hand and said i don't want your gift i don't want it it doesn't match the way i think it should be and how often does that happen and it it's present in all of us friends when i'm up here ministering i'm not ministering about the catholic church we all know that i'm talking about me i'm talking about you and i'm trying to get us to think about ourselves to examine ourselves and it could be it could be anything it could be it just doesn't feel right you know the devil can impersonate our feelings and he does it's like well you know this this kind of music i don't like this kind of music in church you know it's too contemporary or or this kind of music you know it's too old-fashioned or what whatever i i don't like that it doesn't it doesn't feel right it's not according to the word but do you pray about it do you ask the lord lord is this what you want not what i grew up with not what i learned not music 60 70 years ago but is this what you want today and we go to prayer instead of instead of thinking of our of our wants and our desires but we we should go to prayer over these things and ask the lord what do you want and then you'll see a church with an open mind you know not not open to sin of course not but you'll see that church grow in holiness not open to sin but an open mind to the lord whatever you want to send whatever gift you want to send i'm willing to take it not stick our hands in his face and say i don't want your gift and we need to be careful of that because it's so easy to do i uh and even in the message we say well you can't preach on a scripture that brother branham didn't preach on because we don't know what that means that's not true my bible says that all scripture is given by inspiration of god and good for doctrine so we can't we we don't want to go that way that's just that's just that image in our mind that i talked about nebuchadnezzar these are gifts from god and we need to be willing to accept those if they're according to the word and if they're given by god we see in the message and in the and in the world itself brother john andy's he's spoken here a few times he's he's now he's on fire he's going around the country and he's just preaching everywhere man he's he told me his schedule and it's like every sunday twice and every wednesday and he's going and going and going and he's been a minister he's my age and he's been a minister since he was a teenager and he's told me he says brother he says i've never seen it like it is now the people are so willing to accept the lord and they're they're getting away from those doctrines and brother john has been excited i have i have a new friend um up in phoenix his name's aaron mcgarry and uh if you know brother aaron um and you know me you've never seen two more opposite sides of the so-called message than him and me the way we grew up and and where we were from i mean he's five-fold ministry i am tapes only man and we are not friends but brother aaron he's just won my love and he's won my respect and he's got and he's told me the same thing the lord is doing something and what it is is it's people willing to accept these gifts that god gives that that before it'd be more like i don't want it it doesn't doesn't match the way i think a minister should be it doesn't match the way i think a deacon should be a trustee it doesn't match the way i think the song leader should be but there's there's people there's there's a movement rising up and i can see it that god is he's he's stirring the pie and and he's he's getting us ready for a work that's coming and i think it's already coming i think it's already starting to be here and this work is is going to be done and it is being done by a body now a body this church is not the body of christ it's not each of us are the body of christ and each of us have a gift to bring to the church to bring to the body and we should never think that we don't and we should be praying friends and seeking that gift lord what do you want me to do i'm i'm in that position right now lord what do you want me to do i don't i don't know where you want me to be but i want to be where you want me to be do you want me out on the street witnessing i can do that do you want me to to help the church with a website i can do that what do you want me to do and each of us needs to seek that and what i wanted to minister on tonight is how paul was was laying the foundation for that and he says throughout his writings he says he says you know he says you can't he says the hand it can't be the foot and the eye can't be the ear everyone is different and and we look at what what paul wrote we look at each other and unity and i believe we should seek unity unity is not uniformity we don't all look the same we don't i like the same we don't all have the same ministry we're all different but we should be unified in one body operating for the for the perfecting of the body let's uh the apostle paul he wrote a letter to the church at ephesus and this letter brother branham said that this letter that paul wrote called the ephesian called ephesians that letter typed joshua now what what a it's a it's a very powerful statement that brother branham made that this letter of the ephesians typed joshua and then you start reading the ephesians like oh paul is preparing the church the book of joshua that's what joshua's job was is to prepare this body to go over jordan and you see and that's the same thing going on in this book of ephesians if you turn turn with me to ephesians chapter 2. brother brown preached the adoption series and he said that we are adopted or brother branham used the word placed into the body of christ each one of us like a puzzle the puzzle has to have each piece put together and man if you if you have this puzzle and you lose a couple pieces it is such a letdown you know you got those puzzles like man i wish i had those two pieces because it's not complete that's how each of us are no no piece is any greater than the other one but we need to all be there for that picture to be whole and and brother branham he preached that adoption series and he told us that we are positionally placed in christ and friends when when we approach the word and i start to get nervous before i read it is as brother branham said many times he said my words were fail he said but but this word this will never fail i was um a brother i knew in jeffersonville he left the message he he said uh it's all false brother branham lied and all this and this and this and i i called them up i felt it on my heart to call them up they said brother i said let's uh let's you know go get a cup of coffee or something and and he said all right you know let's go so so we go and we meet at the coffee place and man his he had his guns drawn and he was ready to rumble he was ready to fight he had his scriptures he had his quotes he had everything ready and he was ready to go to battle with this guy that works with voice of god and so he starts and i said brother i said let me read to you something brother branham said i said and i read a quote and it was this it said brother branham said in reading his bible he said my words will fail but these words will never fail and i asked him i said what do you not believe about that and all of his quotes and all of his everything he's it was shot down and even him his spirit changed and he said you know he says you're right he says brother branham didn't teach what we say he taught and that image that i just talked about that's this image that we have created that nebuchadnezzar created of daniel but it wasn't real daniel was a man wonderful man greatest man on earth and and brought and brought a wonderful message but he wasn't what nebuchadnezzar made him to be and this brother saw that and he said you know you're right and now today he has a different attitude um let's uh before we approach the word let's pray lord jesus i don't approach your word lightly i know it's it's a gift to us lord and and it's it's the full truth of jesus christ and lord as i read the words that you brought to us through your apostle paul i pray that the same anointing is here today that was there when paul wrote these words down granted lord in jesus name amen let's uh my brother if if you would put up let's start with ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10. what i was talking about before paul says for we are his workmanship created in christ created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them now paul was an educated author paul if you read his writings he is starting to lay a foundation here for what he's going to he's going to finish in his letter let's go to uh the next chapter let's go to ephesians chapter 3 and i'll read i'll start with verse 8 my brother and paul says this he says unto me whom less than the least of all the saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath not hid hath not been hid in god who created all things by half i'm sorry i said that wrong the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith in him wherefore i desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grouted in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and the height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with the fullness of god what an incredible statement our brother paul has just made now we see in revelation chapter 5 we see jesus on his throne and he's surrounded by a hundred million angels 100 million i did the math my brother a hundred million angels i don't know the difference between 100 million and 50 million but it's a lot and there it is and they're up there and these angels are all crying they're saying worthy is the lamb that was slain and and he's surrounded by these angels what would one angel do a hundred million angels surrounding him all worshiping him and then he wants to be known by me he wants a relationship with me he wants a relationship with you here is this great being in heaven surrounded by 100 million angels all all crying worthy art thou and yet he wants that relationship with me not only that is he wants to live as the bible says just now he wants to live in my heart friends we shouldn't as we're reading this bible we shouldn't just read over it we should just we should digest each scripture don't go to the next scripture without digesting the first one else you know i was just reading it's like oh that's nice you know that's good you know go to the next oh it's beautiful memorize that one no really digest it here is this this great being and paul says this he says he says that we may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of christ with pat which passes knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god the fullness of the one that's up there he's surrounded by these angels and he said that you that we might be filled with his fullness that's called the holy spirit it's a big deal we take it so lightly it is a big it is everything to be filled with the holy spirit look at what a powerful thing it is that we might be filled with that spirit friends don't we don't take it lightly it's it's very important let's go on he says this and to know the love of christ with pat which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all the ages without world amen now paul is leading into these gifts and this is the scripture i hope that i have time there's there's another scripture outside of the book ephesians of ephesians that places us all in the body of christ that we can look and we can see ourselves in that in that scripture and in that word but let's let's stay with ephesians 4 here paul says i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation where with ye are called in other words walk worthy of the calling wherewith you're called so we all lord we pray that we want these gifts but the lord requires something from us he doesn't require anything of us from us other than we accept him for salvation but if we want to be these pillars of the church if we want to bring those gifts he requires something from us that we walk worthy of these callings that we have now the bible in another place that says gifts and callings are without repentance what that means is god doesn't give them to you and take them back you can be a sinner and still have a gift you know you can be you can be a beautiful singer and and use it for the for the enemy you can be a preacher and use it for the enemy you can be a great speaker and deceive many those gifts are from god and god doesn't take them back but we use those gifts in the right way with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love oh i could go on and on and on we have to have patience with one another friends we have to look past it if somebody does something wrong or isn't quite right look past it we might sometimes find that we're the ones that are wrong endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace keep the unity in the spirit so often satan comes in remember the images i talked about and he divides us i think it should be this way and this this person said well i want a pastor that that does this and this one says well i want a pastor that does this and this one says well i want music like this and this one says well we should have this many deacons and not that many deacons and here's what paul says he's like hey just keep the unity of the spirit endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there's one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and the father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now paul is laying his foundation here now he's going to say something he said now he that ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things now the scripture i'm going to read next is a very controversial scripture in the message ranks it shouldn't be because i'm going to read a quote to you here in a minute that explains all this and it shows you where both sides are wrong and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers four very very important word here for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ now i hear over here it says well the tapes are going to perfect the bride oh and then i hear over here no the fivefold ministry perfects the bride it's not what the word says the word says that these gifts are for the perfecting of the bride am i right it says that now brother jeremy if you could put up my quote there brother branham addressed this very question i almost forbade him and and this is a quote that you don't hear quoted very much by either side because it doesn't fit their narrative it doesn't necessarily fit the image that they have of the message but it answers the question and the prophet in his wisdom the wisdom of the holy spirit the prophet lays it down and then we go off and we have divisions among us but the prophet already answered this question it'd be nice if we went back to what he said now let me read this this uh amazing answer this is in questions and answers preached on august 30th 1964. here's the question somebody wrote in questions and answers we all know how it was people would write in on a piece of paper and then brother branham would pick it out and he would he would read it and he would answer the question and he says this here's the question dearly beloved let's see about the scripture of ephesians 4 11 which i just read ephesians 4 11 through 13. do we all let's see do we all get the perfecting of the saints through the tapes or should we be here where the gifts of the spirit are operating in different offices of the churches to help us to help perfect us our hearts have believed all of the word of the lord and friends we've all heard this division that's in the church and we've all heard that that no you the the tapes are what perfects the bride brother brahma never said it and over here another five full ministry perfects the bride brother brandon never said that either and what's so strange to me is is like 50 60 years ago it was still on the people's minds so thank god that he preserved this for us now brother branham then he goes on in paragraph 219 there he tells who wrote the wrote the um the question and then he gives this answer go down my brother um you can see here he tells he tells keep going there we go he answers this he asks brother branham is it the tapes the perfected bride or is the five-fold ministry that perfects the bride i love his answer no no with an exclamation point no he says here they want to come here to the church for the perfecting sea that we get fellows that we get fellowship one another with one another here at the church but the perfecting comes between us and god the blood of christ is what perfects us in the holy spirit i say case closed on that argument neither of them are right the holy spirit is what perfects the bride friends it couldn't be anything else so let's keep let's uh keep going on ephesians 4. i'll start with verse 11 again and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ he's back saying that we can come into that measure to that perfection that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slate of men and cunning craftiness wherein whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part he's talking about every member a hand a foot an eye and ear all of the body of christ working together every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love there's a god sends gifts friends i um i thought of the story and i don't know if i i heard it or if i just made it up but uh it doesn't matter because you'll see at the end it couldn't really happen but there was a man in his family and and he was downstream of a flood and in the flood waters they started to rise and they had the warnings and stuff in the fire department they came to they came to the man's house and they said the flood waters are coming they said get out get your family out and get to high ground and the man responded he said he said no he said we are trusting in the lord we're christians we're trusting in the lord that he is going to stay the waters maybe like he did joshua we're not going to do it so then the flood water started to rise and he went up to the second floor of his house with his family and here comes a boat and the fire department or the emergency rescue people they said get in the boat let's go because the waters are going to continue to rise and he says we are trusting in god we're christians we're trusting in the lord we're not going anywhere we prayed and he's gonna he's gonna take care of us rescue people leave the waters continue to rise and then he gets out and they go up on top of the roof and here comes a helicopter a loudspeaker get in the basket let's go let's get you out of here and he says we have prayed we have asked the lord and he is going to deliver us the helicopter left the flood waters rose he and his family perished in the flood so he comes before the lord and he says lord we trusted you we believed everything that you said we put our trust in your son jesus christ we put our trust into you and we we died in the flood and the lord could respond and said no i sent you three gifts i sent you the person before the flood even came i sent you the boat i sent you the helicopter and you refused it because i my gifts didn't match your image of the way i should be was the man lost i don't know if he was lost it's that's not the point the point is we can refuse god's gifts and we should not do that so friends as a church we should always pray lord we want your will and i believe the lord's stirring i believe some things are happening i'm excited about what's happening to the tucson tabernacle right now and friends it's built around these pillars right here and you all have held strong and i believe the lord is going to honor that i i wish i could go to my next scripture but i don't want to keep you late it's wednesday night and it's late and maybe uh i'm not fishing for another invitation but maybe i could finish this text some other time um friends i want to be part of that body i want it so bad it's it's everything to me and and if whatever i can bring to the table i want to bring it and i pray that each of you has that same spirit whatever we can do i'm a piece of that puzzle it's not complete without me we have a pastor we have deacons we have we have song leaders we have piano players we have all these pieces in the puzzle but if i'm not there it's not complete if you're not there it's not complete but we need to walk worthy of that calling that we're called so god is able to use us so he's not he doesn't hinder us that we don't hinder him we have to friends we have to rise to that occasion i uh let's uh friends can can we pray as a church let's let's stand and pray a real prayer pray that lord i really mean this i'm seeking what whatever you want me to be whatever whatever place that you want wherever positionally you want to put me lord let me be in that place can we pray that that prayer tonight friends can we pray let's bow our heads and let's think just quietly lord where do you want me lord what can i do how can i help my family how can i help the the sinner that's out on the street how can i help this church lord what can i do where do you want me lord what do you want me tomorrow what do you want me to do can we pray that friends and if if we could just stay quiet for just a moment maybe if the holy spirit come down and and go from each person we can just ask the lord lord where do you want me what can i do for you father not what i want to do but lord what you want me to do and then lord let me bring my gift into this church let me bring my gift into this body lord god almighty it's our prayer father that we would be positionally placed in your body that that is those puzzle pieces as it were father that it would be made whole that we could be strong in your spirit that we would walk worthy of the vocation which we were called father we thank you for those wonderful words that you spoke through your your prophet paul and father we pray that they would anchor deep in our hearts and father may we be what you want us to be we humbly ask this lord and we love you and lord we pray that that your holy spirit would be anchored in each of us and that it would spread in jesus name amen god bless you my friends i am yesterday i i was i try to pray in the morning and i try to pray at night and try to pray at noonday too yesterday usually what i do at lunch is i'll take my lunch for 30 minutes and i was praying yesterday morning i said lord i just want to give you a little bit more so i skipped lunch and i took the 30 minutes and i just got on my knees and i prayed for 30 minutes and i would invite you friends maybe you could do the same thing maybe not pray for 30 minutes but take a little bit of your time and give it to god over the next few days he'll appreciate it and let me tell you you don't do it for the return but he'll return it back to you and he did to me made me feel so good i just got up and i was just feeling so full of the spirit and love so friends can we do that can we do that as the pillars of the church thank you god bless you my friends and brother aaron if you come to be [Music] just no more [Music] i want to love love till there's just know i could never never have loved the lord make that promise to yourself and to the [Music] going to live the way he wants me to live i'm going to give until there's just no more to give i'm going to love love till there's just no i could never never [Music] there's not a scripture in the bible that says you have to outlove him scripture says to love him that's all he asks but he also says you demonstrate your love for him by how you love others you know there's there's so many things that people do and sometimes you might look at different religions and and what they will do to sacrifice and honor to their god and you look at yourself and man i'm i'm nowhere close to that you know i would but god didn't ask for that he said love me love my word but demonstrate it on how you treat others how you love others let your life be something that would others would say i want what you have and a little bit that i do know of brother dan evans and some that he's gone through we've had some conversations and it's um it's got to be a battle for them it's got to be a real battle but god has a way to get to his children sometimes when i think there's no hope i think of the prodigal son and the father who waited for him and all the neighbors saw the prodigal son coming up to the father and boy were their tongues going look at him look at him look at him but the father was looking at his son and said here comes my son that's all they concerned so i appreciate god speaking to us and i didn't talk to brother dan and but the lord had given me some scriptures today possibly for sunday with a thought there's a people on this earth who is going to do that who is going to be that and mary said be it unto me according to thy word and it was shall how many would say that lord be it unto me according to your word amen whatever it takes so [Music] make me more likely jesus make me more like thee [Applause] [Music] me a heart that's filled with me and make me more likely one more time [Music] make me more like give me that's filled with love and make me more like lord we thank you for your word today taking a brother lord and he just surrendered his heart to you and let you use his vocal cords lordos as we heard and listen lord to remind us that the honest truth of it all it's god christ in us the hope of glory it's not a work we could do it's not a a performance we could could do if if there's a hundred million angels worshiping you in perfection lord what more would you need but you want a people who who out of their heart would love you but it just it touches your heart lord jesus want to be part of that group i believe the children of god are part of that group and some maybe haven't recognized it but lord may we come to that recognition lord that it's christ in us the hope of glory lord bless each one that is heard lord may their hearts be stirred and may we take more time to be conscious and aware and to talk to you and let you speak to us every day lord jesus we ask it in jesus christ's name amen some of the most wonderful times i've had is just in the quietness where you just ask god a question in prayer and then he comes down and he answers it in a way you you wouldn't think he would but he's done some marvelous things sitting in my work van one day and i was just talking to the lord at lunch and a little whirlwind came up and the palo verde trees had all been dropping their leaves and it picked them up coming down the street in the subdivision and made a little bouquet of them and came around my van and then went along nobody else would know but i had just asked the lord are you mindful of me and he does simple thing but sometimes we get a little too busy and we miss what god's going to do so keep my heart tender lord keep my head in tune right i pray amen god bless you lord willing we'll meet sunday morning see what the lord bring your lick of fire bring your here you know a true minister will say you know i know what the lord has placed in my heart but the drawing of the of the congregation the body parts that need some some some some of this and this vitamin and god begins to feed god begins to sense he's mindful of us so amen peace of god peace of god cover me cover me cover me oh peace [Music] only in you i am secure only in you i find it so cover me [Music] cover me when i'm not strong cover me when i [Music] let the peace that passes all i understand [Music] peace [Music] oh peace of god [Music] so covered cover [Music] let the peace that passes all i [Music] remember when god sends help and he sends it differently just try to be sensitive remember that that lady in the bottom of the ship was asking for some fruit and god used the unbeliever to deliver the fruit because god chose to do it that way and so she's praising god for and he said to bill it was me that gave me the fruit and she goes well god has to use the devil to do it he'll do it that way too so well let's just believe god lord i know you're mindful of me god bless you [Music] so [Music] so [Music]
