[5:11] the needs that have been brought into
[5:13] this church would be met this morning.
[5:15] Lord, that your spirit would rest upon
[5:17] us, Father, that you would be welcome in
[5:20] this place in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.

[5:36] I I was I was listening in on the um on
[5:40] the stream and came out and it's a good
[5:43] spirit.
[5:45] But it's quiet.
[5:47] Can we uh can we turn up the heat just a
[5:50] little bit? Let's let's let's sing
[5:52] Hosanna.
[5:54] [laughter]
[5:55] And remember, the Lord's good. He loves
[5:58] us. It's a joyous day to be a Christian.
[6:01] Let's sing Hosanna.

[6:17] Hosana.
[6:20] Oh, blessed be the rock. Oh, blessed

[7:33] rock. Oh, blessed be the rock of my
[7:37] salvation. [music]
[7:40] Yeah, that's better. But
[7:42] [applause and cheering]
[7:44] thank you. That's, you know, um,
[7:48] apologies to the folks in the back. I
[7:50] want to start with a different
[7:52] scripture. I was when I was coming out,
[7:55] we need to be encouraged.
[7:57] We live in the closing hours of time and
[8:01] we have been chosen to to carry this
[8:03] light of Jesus Christ to this world. Let
[8:05] me read something to you. Let's go to 1
[8:07] Corinthians chapter 2.
[8:10] I'll read verse one.
[8:14] The Apostle Paul speaking and he said,
[8:16] "I, brethren,
[8:18] when I came to you came not an
[8:20] excellency of speech of or of wisdom
[8:23] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[8:26] For I determined not to know anything
[8:29] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[8:31] crucified. What a statement.
[8:34] I don't want to know anything but Jesus.
[8:37] And he says this. And I was with you in
[8:40] weakness and in fear and in much
[8:42] trembling. And my speech and my
[8:45] preaching was not with enticing words of
[8:48] man man's wisdom but in demonstration of
[8:50] the spirit and of power that your faith
[8:54] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[8:57] but in the power of God.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; How be it we speak wisdom among them
[9:04] that are perfect. Yet not the wisdom of
[9:07] this world nor the princes of this world
[9:09] that comes to that come to not. But we
[9:12] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
[9:16] even the mystery, even the hidden wisdom
[9:21] which God ordained before the before the
[9:24] world unto our glory. What is that
[9:27] wisdom? What is that mystery? It's Jesus
[9:29] Christ, the son of God. He came and he
[9:32] died for our sins
[9:36] &gt;&gt; which none of the princes of this world
[9:37] knew. For they had they known it, they
[9:39] would not have crucified the Lord of
[9:41] glory.
[9:43] But listen to this. But as it is
[9:45] written, eye hath not seen, nor ear
[9:49] heard, neither hath entered into the
[9:51] heart of man the things which God hath
[9:53] prepared for them that love him.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But God hath revealed them unto us
[10:00] by his spirit.
[10:03] For the spirit searchth all things, yay,
[10:06] the deep things of God. Amen.
[10:10] Encouraging scripture to start with.
[10:12] It's not my subject, but uh I just
[10:15] wanted to encourage the congregation a
[10:17] little bit with some encouraging words
[10:19] from from the Apostle Paul. We have a
[10:22] promise, friends, and that promise is
[10:25] greater than anything that we could ever
[10:27] even imagine. And I feel like we don't
[10:31] take it we don't take it seriously
[10:33] enough. I feel like we brother Brandham
[10:36] said many times we live below our means
[10:39] and we need to really understand the
[10:42] gravity of the situation of where we are
[10:45] now and the importance of the decisions
[10:48] that we're making the importance of of
[10:51] our worship.
[10:53] It's vitally important. I'm going to
[10:55] tell a story, if the Lord's willing, at
[10:57] the end of service
[10:59] that shows that just one little thing
[11:04] about Jesus's sermon on the mount, a man
[11:08] and his wife didn't follow and they
[11:09] immediately died.
[11:12] Tremendous, tremendously important.
[11:16] I uh first let me let me say a few
[11:20] things about uh the coming the coming
[11:21] days. Brother Joel Galant from Quebec.
[11:25] He's going to be here next weekend.
[11:27] We're going to have him Sunday morning,
[11:28] Sunday night. And uh then the following
[11:32] Wednesday,
[11:34] I can't say enough about Brother Joel.
[11:36] He and I met each other at an outreach
[11:40] um uh outreach service in Quebec many
[11:44] years ago, and uh I think we immediately
[11:48] gained each other's respect. So, I'm
[11:50] really looking forward to hearing him.
[11:52] He uh he's a wonderful minister. And uh
[11:55] then
[11:57] we uh we have I want to announce it to
[12:00] the to the big group. We have on
[12:02] December 21st, we're going to have the
[12:05] evening of December 21st, we're going to
[12:07] have children's church. This is going to
[12:09] be devoted to the young ones, maybe 15
[12:12] years old and younger. So, the kids, if
[12:15] if you have a scripture that you want to
[12:16] read, we'll have we'll have some stuff
[12:18] for um for uh the the the
[12:23] um schedule, but if you have a song that
[12:26] you want to sing, if you have a
[12:28] scripture that you want to read, this is
[12:30] going to be about the kids. Uh and
[12:31] that's going to be the Sunday, Sunday
[12:33] night, the 21st. It's a good time to for
[12:35] the kids to invite their friends. And uh
[12:38] Katie, maybe even you'll have a new one
[12:39] [laughter] by then.
[12:42] Today's Katie's due date and she's
[12:44] playing the she's she's being uh taking
[12:48] care of us.
[12:50] Uh so yeah, so that's December 21st, the
[12:53] the evening, Sunday evening, that's
[12:56] going to be devoted to the K the kids.
[12:58] Uh then the the Wednesday before that is
[13:01] going to be um December 17th, Joel
[13:03] Joelle will be preaching that also, but
[13:07] we're going to have a different service
[13:09] on Wednesday. We are going to uh about a
[13:12] fire pit. We're going to have we'll
[13:15] probably we'll see how cold it is
[13:16] outside. We might have a short Bible
[13:18] lesson in here. And then we might go
[13:21] outside under the patio and just sing
[13:24] and fellowship with each other with
[13:25] guitars and we'll have some blankets if
[13:28] it's a little cold. We have heaters. Um
[13:31] I'm just looking forward to the
[13:32] fellowship just sitting around a fire.
[13:33] There's something about a campfire
[13:35] that's just it just produces fellowship
[13:37] and it it produces joy.
[13:40] So, we'll be doing that on uh Wednesday
[13:42] the 17th. Joel will be uh handling the
[13:45] Bible study
[13:47] and everything that we're doing.
[13:49] Friends, if you'll notice, I sent out
[13:51] the schedule, the calendar
[13:54] for our our service schedule. If you
[13:55] notice, I've tried to take my name off
[13:58] of some of the services. And you can,
[14:02] Brother Brandham said, you can do pretty
[14:04] much anything too much except for pray
[14:06] too much. I've been spending a lot of
[14:09] time in study
[14:11] and maybe my prayer life has suffered a
[14:14] little bit. So, with all the um new
[14:17] things that we're doing at church, I
[14:18] wanted to um take my name off of the
[14:22] schedule a little bit and devote that
[14:23] time that I would have been studying,
[14:25] devote that time to prayer, make sure
[14:27] that we are going in the right direct
[14:29] direction
[14:31] because everything that we should be
[14:33] doing with the children's church, which
[14:34] are with our Sunday morning service,
[14:37] with if we're going to have Sunday night
[14:39] service, if we're not going to have
[14:40] Sunday night service, which I think
[14:42] tonight we're going to cancel Sunday
[14:43] night this this evening because we don't
[14:46] have the staff. We um we have we're
[14:50] about half staff and if something goes
[14:53] wrong, it's fine if everybody comes and
[14:56] we can we can worship together, but if
[14:59] something were to go wrong, we don't
[15:01] have the staff to take care of it. So
[15:04] whether it be in the back, we're short
[15:06] staffed with the uh audio, whether it be
[15:08] with the deacons and and the and the
[15:10] board there. So, I just feel I wanted to
[15:14] have service tonight because I had some
[15:15] things I wanted on my heart I wanted to
[15:17] to to say to preach on, but um we'll put
[15:20] it off. So, no service tonight.
[15:23] Brother John, don't get on me.
[15:28] Brother John. We love Brother John.
[15:30] [laughter]
[15:31] He he told me so he spent all months in
[15:34] the hospital
[15:36] [laughter] and I got him and I was just
[15:39] loving on. Brother John loves me and I
[15:41] love him. And I went to visit him in the
[15:43] hospital and and he looked at me and he
[15:45] didn't smile, but he looked at me and he
[15:47] says, "Brother Daniel, the reason I'm in
[15:50] the hospital is because I broke my leg
[15:52] on a Sunday night when you canceled
[15:54] service.
[15:55] [laughter]
[15:57] Don't clap.
[16:01] Sister Shirley, you started that
[16:02] clapping. [laughter]
[16:08] I'm sorry, but [laughter]
[16:10] Don't climb up any ladders this
[16:11] afternoon, okay?
[16:15] Everything that we're doing, friends,
[16:16] whether we have service, whether we
[16:18] don't have service, whether who's
[16:21] leading songs, the song choices that the
[16:23] worship leaders have, the who's playing
[16:25] the piano, who's playing the organ, and
[16:27] and what instruments we have here, our
[16:30] service schedule, everything
[16:33] is geared towards or should be geared
[16:37] towards fostering that personal
[16:40] relationship between all of us in this
[16:43] room and our Lord Jesus
[16:47] that is should be the meaning for
[16:49] everything and sometimes we get
[16:52] ourselves in the way
[16:54] and
[16:56] I really don't think I don't think that
[16:58] we are taking I don't think anyone is
[17:02] not just us but I don't think that we're
[17:04] taking heaven and hell seriously enough.
[17:07] I don't think we're taking the Bible
[17:09] seriously enough. I think it's a it's a
[17:11] dangerous time. The Bible says that in
[17:13] the last days, perilous times would
[17:16] come. And we are in those perilous
[17:17] times.
[17:19] And these teachings that we bring out,
[17:23] it's it's interesting what Jesus said
[17:28] and and his words are beautiful, but are
[17:30] we taking what he said and are we really
[17:32] applying them to our lives? That's the
[17:35] most important thing. And the the the
[17:38] words that I I'm saying when I read
[17:40] these scriptures, remember these are not
[17:43] my words. These are these are God's
[17:46] words that he chose
[17:50] men who were led by the Holy Spirit to
[17:53] record them in this in this book. And
[17:56] they're vitally important and they
[17:57] should be applied to our lives. I want
[17:59] to read something and I want to put it
[18:01] up on the screen. I'm going to read the
[18:03] New Living Translation.
[18:05] I want to read something Isaiah wrote.
[18:08] And this is
[18:10] this is a um
[18:13] it's it's a dialogue between the prophet
[18:16] Isaiah and God. Listen to this.
[18:20] Isaiah says this. Oh that you would
[18:23] burst down from the heavens and come
[18:25] down. How the mountains would quake in
[18:27] your presence as fire causes wood to
[18:30] burn and water to boil. Your coming
[18:32] would make the nations tremble. Then
[18:35] your enemies would learn the reason for
[18:39] your fame.
[18:41] When you came down long ago, you did
[18:43] awesome deeds beyond our highest
[18:45] expectations. And oh, oh, how the
[18:48] mountains quaked. For since the world
[18:50] began, no ear has heard and no eye has
[18:54] seen a God like you who works for those
[18:57] who wait for him. That's what Paul was
[19:00] was quoting when in that first scripture
[19:01] I read. Eye has not seen, ears not
[19:04] heard. You welcome those who gladly do
[19:07] good, who follow godly ways. But you
[19:10] have been very angry with us. For we are
[19:13] not godly. We are constant sinners. How
[19:17] can people like us be saved? We are all
[19:20] infected and impure with sin. When we
[19:23] display our righteous deeds, they are
[19:25] nothing but filthy rags. Like autumn
[19:28] leaves, we wither and fall, and our sins
[19:31] sweep us away like the wind.
[19:34] Yet no one calls on your name or pleads
[19:37] with you for mercy. Therefore, you have
[19:40] turned away from us and turned us over
[19:43] to our sins.
[19:45] And yet, Lord, you are our father.
[19:50] We are the clay and you are the potter.
[19:53] We are all formed by your hand. So don't
[19:55] be angry with us, Lord. Please don't
[19:57] remember our sins forever. Look at us,
[20:00] we pray and see that we are all your
[20:03] people. Your holy cities are destroyed.
[20:06] Zion is a wilderness. Yes, Jerusalem is
[20:08] a desolate ruin. The holy and beautiful
[20:10] temple where our ancestors praise you
[20:12] praised you has been burned down and all
[20:15] the things of beauty are destroyed.
[20:19] And after all this, must you still
[20:22] refuse to help us? Will you continue to
[20:25] be silent and punish us? How many of us
[20:29] have prayed like that? As Isaiah is
[20:31] praying like, Lord, where are you? Where
[20:34] are you in my life? Where is your
[20:36] healing? Where are your miracles?
[20:38] Gideon, I believe it says, if you're
[20:40] with us, then if God's with us, then
[20:41] where are all his miracles?
[20:44] Then the Lord said,
[20:47] I was ready to respond, but no one asked
[20:51] for help.
[20:52] I was ready to be found, but no one was
[20:55] looking for me. I said, "Here I am. Here
[20:58] I am." To a to a nation that did not
[21:01] call on my name.
[21:03] All day long, I opened my arms to a
[21:07] rebellious people.
[21:10] But they followed their own evil past
[21:12] and and their own crooked schemes. All
[21:15] day long they insult me to my face by
[21:17] worshiping idols in their sacred
[21:18] gardens. They burn incense on pagan
[21:20] altars. At night they go out among the
[21:22] graves worship worshiping the dead. They
[21:24] eat the flesh of pigs and make stews for
[21:26] other forbidden foods. Yet they say to
[21:29] each other, "Don't come too close or you
[21:31] will defile me.
[21:34] I am holier than you."
[21:38] These people are a stench in my
[21:40] nostrils,
[21:41] an acrid smell that never goes away.
[21:45] Look at my decrees written out in front
[21:47] of me. I will not stand silent. I will
[21:49] repay them in full. Yes, I will repay
[21:51] them both for their own sins and for the
[21:54] sins of their ancestors, says the Lord.
[21:56] For they also burned incense on the
[21:58] mountains and insulted me on the hills.
[22:00] I will pay them back in full, God
[22:03] speaking.
[22:05] But I will not destroy them all, says
[22:08] the Lord.
[22:11] For just as good grapes are found among
[22:15] clusters of bad ones,
[22:17] and someone will say, "Don't throw them
[22:19] all away."
[22:21] Some of those grapes are good.
[22:27] So I will not destroy all Israel,
[22:31] for I still have true servants there.
[22:35] And I'll skip down. Look, I am creating
[22:39] new heavens and and a new earth and no
[22:42] one will even think about the old ones
[22:44] anymore. Be glad and rejoice forever in
[22:47] my creation. And look, I will create
[22:50] Jerus Jerusalem as a place of happiness.
[22:53] Her people will be as a source of joy. I
[22:55] will rejoice over Jerusalem and delight
[22:58] in my people and the sound of weeping
[23:00] and crying will be heard no more.
[23:05] I'll skip down. I will answer them
[23:08] before they even call to me.
[23:11] While they are still talking about their
[23:13] their needs, I will go ahead and answer
[23:15] their prayers. The wolf and the lamb
[23:18] will feed together. The lion will eat
[23:20] hay like a cow, like the ox. But the
[23:23] snake will eat dust. And in those days,
[23:25] no one will be hurt or destroyed on my
[23:27] holy mountain. I, the Lord, have spoken.
[23:33] This is what the Lord says. Heaven is my
[23:35] throne and earth is my foottool. Could
[23:37] you bring me a temple as good as that?
[23:39] Could you build me such a resting place?
[23:42] My hands have made both heaven and earth
[23:45] and they and everything in them are
[23:47] mine. I the Lord have spoken. I will
[23:50] bless those who have a humble who have
[23:53] humble and contrite hearts who tremble
[23:56] at my word.
[23:58] The words of Isaiah chapter 64 and 65.
[24:03] Beautiful words.
[24:05] I think that
[24:08] we I think we take for granted what
[24:11] God's done for us. I think for we take
[24:13] for granted how great he is. We take for
[24:16] granted really his word.
[24:20] And if we really knew the importance and
[24:23] we really knew how his word is is going
[24:27] to bring us through, then I think that
[24:29] we would we would take it more
[24:30] seriously.
[24:32] Much of so much of our lives are spent
[24:36] really trying to impress other people
[24:39] and it's just natural. We're human
[24:40] beings. We're social beings. So we maybe
[24:44] do our work, we do our things with the
[24:48] hope that someone else is going to see
[24:49] us, with the hope that someone else is
[24:52] going to maybe exalt us or someone else
[24:54] is going to pay us a compliment. And we
[24:57] we do these things not really to serve
[25:00] God, but we do these things really to
[25:03] exalt ourselves, promote ourselves, to
[25:05] make ourselves feel better.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; You know, look at look at social media.
[25:09] I mention this fairly often, but it's
[25:11] such a good example because everybody
[25:13] can see it. You know, you have
[25:16] we, you know, take a picture and it's
[25:19] like here I am reading my Bible. You
[25:21] know, here I am feeding the poor. Here I
[25:24] am doing this. And
[25:28] is it about the what you're doing
[25:32] or is about that you are doing it?
[25:35] If if really social media, if if it's
[25:37] like, "No, no, it's about what I'm
[25:38] doing," then put the picture that makes
[25:40] you look fat in there.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Put the picture that makes you look bad
[25:45] in there. If it's not about you, why not
[25:48] put that picture in there?
[25:50] &gt;&gt; But it becomes it does, not that I want
[25:52] you to do that, but it becomes it
[25:54] becomes about that. You know,
[25:57] we we are we're social beings
[26:00] and we want to fit in. It's natural. We
[26:03] want respect. We want to fit in. We uh
[26:05] it might be fitting in at church. It it
[26:08] might be fitting in with with maybe a
[26:11] denomination or with our friends from
[26:12] school or whatever it is. But we make
[26:15] our decisions not necessarily
[26:19] for God,
[26:21] but how it makes us look and how it
[26:24] makes us feel.
[26:27] And there's it's not and it's not just
[26:30] in the religious realm. It's it's all
[26:31] over politics. There's that uh that
[26:33] woman from Georgia, the Congress lady
[26:35] that, you know, she's going to get
[26:37] primar. She's or she's bowed out because
[26:40] she fell out of graces maybe with the
[26:41] Republican party and she's doing
[26:43] everything that she could to get back in
[26:45] and and fall into line and and it's all
[26:48] about the status quo. There's this
[26:50] there's this guy the uh the senator in
[26:54] Pennsylvania, John Federman.
[26:58] I don't I don't agree with with his um
[27:02] stand with his liberal agenda, but I
[27:05] respect that man. He has stood on his
[27:09] own and had and has gone across the
[27:13] party line and said, "You know what?
[27:15] There's certain things I don't agree
[27:16] with. So, I'm not I'm not going to stand
[27:19] on the Democrat party and follow along
[27:22] with this. I support Israel is one of
[27:23] those things." And he has stood against
[27:25] his whole party. And you think that he
[27:27] hasn't received criticism? You think it
[27:28] has been hard on him? But he's been
[27:30] willing to stand up. And then they asked
[27:33] him, "Well, you're standing against the
[27:34] Democrats." Well, why don't you switch
[27:36] parties to be a Republican? He says, "I
[27:38] would be a terrible Republican."
[27:40] He says, "I don't see things like them.
[27:44] I I it's that's not my that's not my
[27:47] philosophy." But he stands and he's a
[27:50] man. And I appreciate that. There's so
[27:53] little of that today. There's so little
[27:55] of there so few people that will really
[27:58] stand on their convictions and whatever
[28:01] it might be and really stand and say,
[28:02] you know what, this is what's right. I
[28:04] don't care what my party says. I don't
[28:06] care what what my school says. I don't
[28:08] care what my family says. This is what's
[28:11] right and I'm going to stand on that.
[28:13] And there's it's such a a rare thing
[28:15] today. I was talking with a a sister
[28:20] uh a lady and uh she was involved in a
[28:24] situation at work
[28:27] where her boss
[28:30] was misappropriating
[28:32] company money
[28:34] and that uh and she got put in a tough
[28:39] spot because she was an accountant for
[28:41] the company and and she was like I don't
[28:43] know what to do because her boss's boss
[28:45] who her boss answered to. Now, they got
[28:48] wind of some of this misappropriation
[28:50] and they came to to this sister and
[28:53] they're like, "Hey, what what are you
[28:54] going to do or or we we need some more
[28:56] information?" And when I saw her, she
[28:58] was like, I you know, what should I do
[29:01] on this? Now, she's a person of very
[29:03] very high integrity. So, I I knew she
[29:06] was going to make the right decision in
[29:07] this. I knew she was she was going to
[29:09] handle it right. But what I told her was
[29:12] you do what's right.
[29:15] you know, you're not doing what's better
[29:16] for you because you have a good
[29:18] relationship with your boss and you
[29:20] don't want to sell your boss down the
[29:21] road. Of course, you don't want to do
[29:22] that. But then you don't also want to do
[29:24] it because you don't want to maybe see
[29:26] an opportunity that if your boss gets
[29:28] canned now, you can maybe move up. You
[29:31] don't look at yourself in all of this.
[29:33] You look at the situation and you say,
[29:34] "Okay, what is right? What is required
[29:36] of me? What's the honest thing to do?"
[29:40] And then you do that.
[29:42] And it's so hard for us to take
[29:44] ourselves
[29:46] out of the equation. It's so hard for us
[29:49] to not think about how is this going to
[29:51] affect me? The Apostle Paul,
[29:56] tremendous man, his friends were
[30:00] Pharisees
[30:02] and when he made his stand, they wanted
[30:04] to kill him. They hated him so much.
[30:07] They they just they they wanted to they
[30:09] wanted to arrest him and and because he
[30:11] he stood up against them. Even Peter his
[30:14] now he's now Paul becomes a Christian.
[30:16] He stood up against pe against Peter and
[30:18] said no Peter you're wrong.
[30:21] You've done this. So now he's the
[30:23] Pharisees hate him. And now he's got
[30:25] over here he's got Peter that he's at
[30:27] odds with. And over here in James when
[30:29] James sends people down to bring
[30:31] legalism to his new converts in Galatia
[30:34] he stands against James. He says, "No,
[30:36] this is wrong, too." Paul was willing to
[30:38] stand. He didn't align himself with
[30:40] anyone. He aligned himself with Christ
[30:42] and with the Bible, and he didn't care.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; And that was a man that would do that.
[30:48] But it's so rare that people will do it
[30:52] that they will they'll stand up. And
[30:53] even in his trial before Felix, Paul's
[30:56] arrested and they hate him and they they
[30:57] want to kill him. He comes before the
[30:59] governor
[31:00] and he says, you know, Felix, he says,
[31:06] I I you know I agree with the Pharisees
[31:08] on the resurrection. You know I didn't I
[31:10] didn't they're accusing me of being
[31:12] against Moses. I'm not against Moses.
[31:14] I'm not against the law. I'm not against
[31:15] the prophets. He says I'm not against
[31:17] any of that. He says they they've
[31:19] accused me. He says one time I got into
[31:21] it and I raised my voice. I yelled at
[31:22] this guy. He says yeah I I did that but
[31:27] I'm just I'm not against anyone.
[31:31] And he says, he says this in Acts 24:14,
[31:35] speaking speaking to the governor, he
[31:38] says, "But this I confess unto thee,
[31:42] that after the way which they called
[31:43] heresy."
[31:45] These are the people that were his
[31:47] friends. After the way that they call a
[31:49] cult,
[31:51] so worship I the God of my fathers.
[31:55] He says, "Believing all things which are
[31:57] written in the law and the prophets." He
[31:59] says, "I believe the prophets. I believe
[32:01] the law. But just because I stand up for
[32:04] this man, Jesus Christ, they're trying
[32:06] to kill me for it." Thess here's here's
[32:09] what I'm here's what I am. I stand for
[32:13] this word. And Paul stood alone. But God
[32:18] honored Paul's stand. And we have these
[32:21] these letters in our Bible that Paul
[32:24] wrote. had a dream um two days ago and
[32:30] uh don't get weird and try to interpret
[32:32] my dream. I just so so often you know
[32:35] say a dream and it's automatically as a
[32:36] spiritual thing.
[32:38] It's I just it's good for the story.
[32:42] It's good for the subject. All right. I
[32:45] was dreamed. I was I was in this place
[32:47] and and there was all of these like
[32:51] ministers and all all of these these
[32:53] people around and I was sitting in the
[32:56] back row
[32:58] and
[33:01] people started as I was sitting there
[33:04] people around me my friends they started
[33:06] picking up their chairs and moving to
[33:09] another place in the room.
[33:11] And I was sitting there I was kind of
[33:13] feeling bad. I was like, "Oh, you know,
[33:14] the first one when he did I was like,
[33:15] "Oh, that's no big deal. It's he just
[33:16] wanted to sit over on the other side."
[33:19] And then one after one after one and all
[33:22] of a sudden I'm there. I'm by myself.
[33:25] And the man behind me in the dream was
[33:28] in charge.
[33:30] And he was kind of disgusted
[33:33] at every what everybody was doing and
[33:36] trying to to move away from me because I
[33:39] was I was standing for what what I knew
[33:42] was right. I don't even remember what
[33:43] what it what what the subject was, but
[33:45] they were they were just moving away
[33:46] from me and he was kind of disgusted
[33:50] and I heard him mumbling under his
[33:52] breath like what are they doing? You
[33:53] know, this is rude. And then I thought,
[33:56] well, he will come
[34:00] and he'll set his chair beside me and
[34:03] and then that'll uh that'll show that,
[34:05] hey, I'm not such a bad guy. And then he
[34:08] didn't do it.
[34:10] And then I then I woke up and like I
[34:13] said, don't please don't try to
[34:15] interpret my dream. It just it fits with
[34:17] the story. And I woke up and I was
[34:21] feeling bad.
[34:23] I was feeling like, man, if I could just
[34:26] change this a little bit or change that
[34:28] a little bit, then I could fit in with
[34:30] all of all of these brothers. And it the
[34:33] thought was and I'm sure many of you
[34:36] have been there probably all of you have
[34:39] been there. It's like do I
[34:44] compromise on something that I know is
[34:46] right
[34:48] and fit in
[34:51] or
[34:52] do I say no? I I I'm not against anybody
[34:55] like Paul did in the scripture, but I'm
[34:58] going to stand on my convictions.
[35:00] what do I do? And that's the place that
[35:03] I was when I when I woke up and and I
[35:06] thought maybe this is
[35:08] this is for this sermon. Maybe it just
[35:11] kind of gives me a little bit more
[35:12] understanding and and I had that
[35:14] feeling. It's like I felt bad. And it's
[35:17] when people
[35:19] when they feel sorry for you, you know,
[35:22] we all want to fight. It's like, oh, get
[35:24] in the scriptures and I'll, you know,
[35:25] we'll go back and forth and I'll prove
[35:27] this and and then I'm going to show you
[35:29] in the in the Bible over here where it
[35:30] says this and and get in that fight and
[35:33] it never works out that way. You'll
[35:35] never convince anyone in doing that.
[35:38] But when somebody feels sorry for you
[35:42] and they look down on you and they're
[35:44] like, "Oh, poor brother Heath, you know,
[35:47] he's just he's just he just doesn't
[35:50] understand. He just doesn't get it. He
[35:51] just doesn't have the revelation." or
[35:53] poor brother Manny. That's what makes
[35:54] you feel bad. That's what really hurts.
[35:56] And that's where I was. That's where
[35:58] Paul is in all of this. But he made a
[36:02] stand. And that stand is a very very
[36:05] difficult one to stand for what is
[36:07] right. Now, we've been in the the sermon
[36:10] on the mount.
[36:11] And I want to get back into that in in
[36:14] Matthew chapter 6, and we'll we'll start
[36:16] right there where Jesus is addressing
[36:21] this very thing.
[36:22] that when you do things, you don't do
[36:25] things to impress someone else. You
[36:29] don't do do something that you might get
[36:32] compliments. When you invite those
[36:34] things, Jesus is going to say, he says,
[36:36] you have your reward there. But God
[36:39] wants us, God wants to reward us. Let's
[36:41] read it. Matthew chapter 6, we'll start
[36:44] with verse one
[36:47] and then I'll I'll read I'll read uh all
[36:51] the way down to about verse 18 and then
[36:54] we'll come back and get into it. Matthew
[36:56] chapter 6 verse one, it says this, "Take
[36:58] heed that you do not your alms before
[37:00] men to be seen of them. Otherwise, you
[37:03] have no reward of your father which is
[37:05] in heaven." Alms are charitable deeds.
[37:08] Therefore, when thou doest thine alms,
[37:10] do not sound a trumpet before thee as
[37:12] the hypocrites do in the synagogues and
[37:15] in the streets, that they might that
[37:16] they may have glory of men. Verily, I
[37:19] say say unto you, they have their
[37:20] reward.
[37:22] But when thou doest alms, let not thy
[37:25] left hand know what thy right hand
[37:27] doeth, that thy alms may be in secret,
[37:30] and thy father which seeth in secret
[37:32] himself shall reward thee openly. And
[37:34] when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as
[37:37] the hypocrites are, for they love to
[37:40] pray standing in the synagogues and on
[37:42] the corners of the streets, that they
[37:44] may be seen of men. Verily I say unto
[37:47] you, they have their reward.
[37:50] But thou, when thou prayest, enter into
[37:53] the closet, and when thou hast shut thy
[37:55] door, pray to the father which is in
[37:58] secret, and thy father which is which
[38:00] seeth in secret shall reward thee
[38:03] openly.
[38:04] But when ye pray, use not vain
[38:07] repetition as the heathen do, for they
[38:10] think that they shall be heard, for
[38:12] their much speaking.
[38:15] Be not ye therefore like them. For your
[38:18] father knoweth what things you have need
[38:20] of before you ask them. That's a
[38:24] &gt;&gt; good one right there. Let's skip uh then
[38:27] he goes into the Lord's prayer. Here's
[38:28] how you pray. But let's skip down to
[38:30] verse 16.
[38:32] We'll uh we'll get to the Lord's prayer
[38:34] on the following service. Moreover,
[38:37] verse 16, moreover, when you fast, be
[38:40] not as the hypocrites of sad
[38:41] countenance, for they disfigure their
[38:43] faces, that they may appear unto men to
[38:46] fast. Verily, I say unto you, they have
[38:48] their reward.
[38:50] But thou, when thou fasteth, anoint thy
[38:52] head, and wash thy face, that thou
[38:55] appear not unto men to fast, but unto
[38:58] thy father which is in secret, and thy
[39:01] father which seeth in secret shall
[39:03] reward thee openly.
[39:06] So really, this whole this whole section
[39:09] of the sermon on the mount is telling us
[39:11] to check our motives and everything that
[39:13] we're doing, especially in our religious
[39:16] practices. All right, are you with me?
[39:21] There's three things that Jesus says
[39:23] here. He mentions giving to the poor. He
[39:27] mentions praying. And he mentions
[39:29] fasting. Now notice in each case he says
[39:34] when you give to the poor when you pray,
[39:38] when you fast. So this isn't a a lesson
[39:41] from Jesus about giving. This isn't a
[39:43] lesson about about praying. It's not a
[39:46] lesson about fasting. He's assuming that
[39:49] we already do these things, right? So
[39:52] he's saying that when you do these
[39:54] things, it's a lesson about really why
[39:58] are you giving?
[40:00] Why are you praying? And make sure that
[40:04] you're not doing it to promote yourself.
[40:07] Make sure you're not doing it outwardly
[40:09] for everybody else to see. And there is
[40:12] a reward involved in all of this that we
[40:15] we really we don't want to miss. So this
[40:18] is a simple lesson from Jesus and we
[40:22] don't want we we do it's it may be
[40:24] simple but it is very very important.
[40:27] It's even life and death as we're going
[40:30] to see that a husband and a wife made
[40:33] the mistake of not listening to this and
[40:37] they lost their lives for it. God
[40:39] himself killed them. So let's go to
[40:44] um let's skip down. Let's let's start
[40:48] with with this. Let's go to verse one
[40:50] again.
[40:52] And it says this. It says, "Take heed
[40:56] that you do not your alms before men to
[40:59] be seen of them. Otherwise, you have no
[41:01] reward of your father which is in
[41:03] heaven." English Standard Version says,
[41:05] "Beware of practicing your righteousness
[41:07] before other people in order to be seen
[41:09] by them. For then you will have no
[41:12] reward from your father who is in
[41:14] heaven." Again,
[41:17] this is a warning to all of us. But
[41:19] you'll notice he says to do these things
[41:22] in secret, but it seems to contradict
[41:26] with the the beginning or the when we
[41:29] started on the sermon on the mount with
[41:31] something else Jesus said. Now, this is
[41:33] just a few minutes after Jesus said this
[41:35] in Matthew chapter 5. Again, sermon on
[41:39] the mount. He's on the side of the hill.
[41:40] Sea of Galilee is over here. his his
[41:43] disciples are out there in front of him
[41:45] and there's probably other people that
[41:46] are listening to this. Now listen to
[41:48] Matthew chapter 5 verse 14 and he says
[41:52] this, "You are the light of the world.
[41:56] A city that is set on a hill that can't
[41:58] be hid.
[42:01] Neither do men light a candle and put it
[42:03] under a bushel, but on a candlestick,
[42:06] and it giveth light to all that are in
[42:09] the house. Let your light so shine
[42:11] before men that they may see your good
[42:16] works
[42:18] and glorify your father which is in
[42:20] heaven.
[42:22] So over here he's saying hey do these
[42:24] things in in private and over here he's
[42:26] saying hey do them outward so everyone
[42:28] can see them. But what he's the the
[42:31] meaning behind this is he's saying check
[42:33] your motives. Are you practicing your
[42:35] religion to impress someone?
[42:39] Or are you worried about someone looking
[42:41] down on on you? Is that the purpose of
[42:43] of your religion? Or are you really
[42:46] trying to serve God? Is is he the one
[42:49] that you're trying to impress? Is he the
[42:51] one that you're trying to serve? the
[42:54] whole sermon on the mount, if you
[42:56] haven't got the the theme here, it's to
[42:59] get away from legalism
[43:03] and to get to for the word to touch the
[43:08] inward person, that inward human being.
[43:12] The outside is something different than
[43:16] the inside. And he's constantly Jesus is
[43:18] constantly telling us that yeah
[43:20] outwardly adulter adultery but inwardly
[43:23] you're still lusting. You're still
[43:25] guilty.
[43:27] So and here's the again the theme right
[43:29] here. Why are you doing this? Why are
[43:32] you praying? Are you doing it for
[43:34] someone else so you can tell someone you
[43:36] prayed? Are you really doing it to be
[43:39] closer to God? So he's saying that if
[43:42] you're looking at someone's outwards
[43:44] appearance or how someone reads their
[43:47] Bible or their ability to pray in public
[43:49] or any type of outwardly outward um
[43:53] expression of religion that someone else
[43:56] can see that he says you're you're just
[43:58] not you're not getting it. You're not
[44:01] understanding this whole thing.
[44:04] He's not saying that giving and prayer
[44:06] and fasting, he's not saying that that's
[44:09] not important.
[44:11] But what he is saying is that when you
[44:15] serve God, there is there's a benefit
[44:19] for it from it. There's something that
[44:21] you're going to get. You don't you're
[44:23] not it's not a deal that you're making
[44:25] with God, but you're approaching God for
[44:27] a reason. And he's saying that if you're
[44:29] showing everyone all that you're doing,
[44:31] you've rewarded yourself.
[44:34] You've already given yourself a reward.
[44:36] So God can't give you another reward for
[44:38] what for what you've already given
[44:39] yourself. And God wants to when you pray
[44:44] or when you do arms, you want the person
[44:48] to you want your prayer to be answered
[44:51] and then that's that can be your reward.
[44:53] Let's keep going.
[44:57] Therefore, when thou doest thine arms,
[44:58] do not sound a trumpet,
[45:01] as the hypocrites do in the synagogues,
[45:03] and the streets. They may they may have
[45:05] the glory of men. Verily, I say unto
[45:07] you, they have their reward. But when
[45:08] thou doest arms, let not thy left hand
[45:11] know what thy right hands doing, that
[45:13] thine arms may be in secret, and the
[45:15] father which seeth in secret shall
[45:17] reward thee openly. And when thou
[45:20] prayest, thou shalt not be as the
[45:21] hypocrite are. For they love to pray
[45:23] standing in the synagogues and on the
[45:24] street corners that they may be seen of
[45:27] men. But verily I say that they have
[45:28] their reward.
[45:32] And especially this one. But when thou
[45:34] prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
[45:37] thou hast shut thy door, pray to the
[45:39] father which is in secret. And the
[45:41] father which is in father which seeth in
[45:43] secret shall reward thee openly. What is
[45:47] the ultimate reward for prayer?
[45:51] What's the ultimate reward when you pray
[45:53] for your children? What's the ultimate
[45:55] reward when you pray for a job?
[45:58] What's the ultimate reward that God
[46:00] would give you if you're young, a
[46:02] husband or a wife?
[46:04] Why do you pray that God reveals his
[46:07] word to you? What is the ultimate reward
[46:09] for prayer?
[46:12] Not a hard question.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That you receive what you ask for.
[46:18] And here, if you're standing on the
[46:21] street corner and you're praying or if
[46:22] you want to come into the pullpit, you
[46:24] want everybody to see how eloquent you
[46:26] are when you're when you're praying or
[46:27] or you want you're ministering and you
[46:29] want to you want everybody to see how
[46:31] you just know the Bible so well and
[46:33] you're rightly dividing the scriptures.
[46:35] You have your reward. That's what you
[46:38] cared about. You cared that other people
[46:39] would look at you, but God has a far
[46:42] greater reward and that you would be
[46:43] answered.
[46:46] that you would see those sincere
[46:48] results.
[46:49] And when God hears the sincere prayer,
[46:52] then he answers that sincere prayer.
[46:55] But when you pray, use not vain
[46:57] repetitions as the heathens do, for they
[47:00] think that they shall be heard for their
[47:01] much much speaking. So don't don't use
[47:04] pre-anned prayers. You know, it's it's
[47:08] that that don't come from your from your
[47:10] heart. you know, the Hail Marys, the uh
[47:13] the the constant repetition, praying
[47:15] over and over. He says, "Don't don't do
[47:18] that because because that doesn't mean
[47:20] anything to God."
[47:23] Paul sought the Lord when he had this
[47:24] thorn in his flesh flesh. He sought the
[47:26] Lord three times
[47:28] for something that bothered him
[47:31] literally every day of his life. He said
[47:34] that it was a messenger of Satan that
[47:36] constantly beat on him. It was over and
[47:39] over. And in the end, what happened? God
[47:43] told Paul, he said that this is best for
[47:46] you, Paul. He said, "Really?" And if you
[47:50] if you read it, it's like Paul, if you
[47:55] wouldn't have had this, you'd have got
[47:58] puffed up. It'd have been more about
[48:00] Paul than it was about me.
[48:04] So this messenger of Satan that was
[48:07] buffeting Paul the thorn in his flesh,
[48:10] it was a gift to Paul
[48:13] that he would stay down to earth
[48:17] and still be a man and still rely on the
[48:19] Lord.
[48:24] Let's um
[48:26] let's move
[48:29] let's move uh let's let's go to Ananas
[48:31] and Safh to close. So when
[48:36] when we pray, when we fast, when we
[48:39] especially when we give alms, when we
[48:41] give charity, when we make an offering,
[48:43] we do this because we're serving God.
[48:47] And if if we do it for ourselves, then
[48:50] we are accepting a reward. And God's not
[48:53] going to reward us twice. He's going to
[48:55] say, "Okay, well, you have your reward.
[48:57] You took it out of my hands. You didn't
[48:59] get it. I wanted to take care of you. I
[49:01] wanted to do it, but you did this. This
[49:04] wasn't me. So, we have this man named
[49:07] Barnabas in the book of Acts chapter 4.
[49:10] He's generally thought of to be a
[49:12] wealthy man. This is a perfect example
[49:14] of how important the sermon on the mount
[49:16] is. And how important of these little
[49:17] things that I'm saying and applying them
[49:19] to our lives, it could be death, the
[49:22] difference between death and life.
[49:25] Barnabas is generally thought of to be a
[49:27] wealthy man.
[49:29] And uh he shows up on the scene, the
[49:31] book of Acts. He wasn't a disciple
[49:34] necessarily when he's the original, but
[49:37] uh he traveled with Paul. He traveled
[49:38] with John Mark and the Bible, the book
[49:40] of Acts mentions him fairly often. Acts
[49:43] 4:36.
[49:48] and Joseph which is Joseph
[49:51] who by the apostles was surnamed
[49:54] Barnabas which is being in interpreted
[49:57] the son of consolation. New new King
[49:59] James says the son of encouragement
[50:02] a Levite and and of the country of
[50:05] Cyprus having land sold it and brought
[50:09] the money and laid it at the apostles
[50:11] feet. All right. So there's no record
[50:14] really of Barnabas telling anybody about
[50:16] it. He uh he saw the need to make this
[50:18] donation. So he sold this land and he
[50:21] gave the money. We don't even know if he
[50:22] gave all of the money, but what we do
[50:24] know is he gave what he obligated to
[50:28] give and it was probably the whole
[50:30] thing. He saw a need, sold this land, he
[50:32] gives it to the work of the Lord. So
[50:35] Luke, who is the author of Acts, he
[50:38] recognizes Barnabas as having done a
[50:40] very generous thing.
[50:42] And imagine when we get awards, maybe
[50:45] some people in the office, you you might
[50:48] get a cash award or you might get some
[50:50] some sort of non-monetary award.
[50:52] Sometimes an award
[50:55] means a whole lot more
[50:58] if it's something lasting like a plaque
[51:00] that you put up on your um on your wall
[51:02] or whatever. They're having the the
[51:04] Kennedy Center Awards for the highest
[51:06] lifetime achievement for an artist. I
[51:08] don't know if you've seen that in the
[51:09] news. the president of the United States
[51:11] chairs the the committee. Um the the uh
[51:16] it's George Strait and Sylvester Salone,
[51:18] Jean Simmons from KISS and and a few
[51:21] others and and this is a this would be
[51:23] their lifetime achievement award. This
[51:25] is this is a big deal. So they they've
[51:28] been nominated by this. They can't give
[51:31] the award to themselves else it would be
[51:33] nothing. But someone else gives them
[51:36] this. And Jesus is saying when he's
[51:38] talking to he's talking on the sermon on
[51:40] the mount. He's saying that when you
[51:41] when you give this to yourself, you're
[51:44] nominating yourself. You're bragging on
[51:45] yourself and you're you receive this
[51:47] recognition. Barnabas just received this
[51:50] recognition from the author of Acts. And
[51:52] now he's eternally in God's word. You
[51:55] talk about a plaque you can put on the
[51:56] wall. That's a big one for Barnabas.
[52:00] So, let's keep going. He saw a need. He
[52:04] made the sacrifice. But let's keep
[52:06] reading.
[52:07] Acts 5:1 But a certain man named Ananas
[52:12] with Safh his wife sold the possession
[52:15] and kept back part of the price. His
[52:18] wife also being privy to it and and
[52:20] brought a certain part and laid it at
[52:22] the apostles feet. But Peter said,
[52:25] "Ananas, why hath Satan filled thine
[52:28] heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to
[52:31] keep back part of the price of the land?
[52:34] While it remained? Was it not your own?
[52:36] Was it not thine own? And after it was
[52:39] sold, was it not in thine own power? Why
[52:42] hast thou conceived this thing in thine
[52:44] heart? Thou hast lied. Thou hast not
[52:47] lied unto men, but unto God.
[52:51] So Ananas
[52:54] represented himself as someone that gave
[52:56] more than he really did.
[53:00] He presented this money
[53:05] and I'm sure he was like, "Hey, you
[53:07] know, Safira and I were, you know, we're
[53:09] going to make this big donation to the
[53:11] church." And he tells everybody and then
[53:13] it became about Ananas and Safh and not
[53:16] about the work that he was supporting.
[53:18] You see, are you with me? Very seems
[53:22] like a small thing,
[53:25] but it meant life and death to these two
[53:28] people. So Peter,
[53:30] he says,
[53:32] he says, "Hey, Ananas," he says, he knew
[53:36] the sermon on the mount. And I'm sure
[53:39] Ananas probably did too. Peter was there
[53:42] when Jesus preached. Hey, don't
[53:43] misrecept don't don't misrepresent
[53:45] yourself. Don't say that you're giving
[53:48] more money than you are. Don't do your
[53:51] your arms in front of everybody because
[53:53] you you lose your reward. Then Peter
[53:55] knew. So Peter, I think out of kindness,
[53:57] he goes to Ananas and he says, "Hey man,
[54:01] are you sure you did this?
[54:05] Are you sure?"
[54:07] And Ananas,
[54:09] if he would have just said, "You know
[54:10] what? We sold we sold it for 50 grand.
[54:14] We kept we kept
[54:16] 10 grand. That's why we only gave you
[54:18] 40. You know, I shouldn't have said
[54:19] that. I told I told everybody. It would
[54:21] have been embarrassing to Ananas." But
[54:22] he didn't say that. He says, "No, I gave
[54:24] you all of the money."
[54:28] And Ananas,
[54:30] let me read what Peter said again.
[54:32] Whilst it remained, was it not thine
[54:34] own? And after it was sold, was it not
[54:36] in thine own power? Why hast thou
[54:38] conceived this this thing in thine
[54:40] heart? Thou hast not lied unto men, but
[54:42] unto God.
[54:44] He's saying, listen, you bragged, but
[54:48] this is a religious thing.
[54:50] Ananas, you are lying to God about this.
[54:55] This isn't telling a white lie to your
[54:57] friend. This is this is giving to the
[55:00] church. This is this is exactly what
[55:03] Jesus said, "Don't do and now you're
[55:06] doing it." And Ananas hearing these
[55:09] words fell down
[55:11] and gave up the ghost. He died right on
[55:13] the spot. And great fear came on all of
[55:16] them that heard this.
[55:19] So then they pack him out.
[55:22] Then Safara, his wife, she comes in and
[55:26] Peter's like, "I'll give her a chance
[55:29] too. Safara, did you sell the land for
[55:33] this much?" She's like, "Oh yeah, we
[55:36] did. We did." And then she kills over.
[55:41] She dies because she again lied to God.
[55:47] Right there. a perfect example of Jesus
[55:51] in saying these things. You might you
[55:53] might not think it's a big deal. Don't
[55:54] do your arms before men. Oh yeah, you
[55:56] know that's that's we shouldn't do that.
[56:00] They died.
[56:02] It killed them because they broke that.
[56:05] And how how important should we make it?
[56:08] How how much should we try to do our
[56:10] best to do what Jesus did on the sermon
[56:13] on the on the mountain? And wherever the
[56:15] Bible says it could be life and death
[56:18] and it's even more than life and death,
[56:19] friends. This is our salvation.
[56:23] You say it's not important. It is
[56:24] important. It's very important.
[56:28] God took it personally
[56:31] when they lied. God, Jehovah.
[56:35] It wasn't like you or me getting
[56:37] offended.
[56:38] He took it personally
[56:41] and he struck them dead. The worship
[56:43] team can come and we'll close.
[56:46] I look at a lot of these like YouTube
[56:50] prophets and people that we might even
[56:52] know. They claim to have this gift of
[56:54] prophecy and they may have a gift but so
[56:59] but many times they're
[57:01] they will say oh the Lord's telling me
[57:03] this and this and this and this and and
[57:05] say it for you and they're exalting
[57:07] themselves for this and they are walking
[57:09] the same line that Ananas and Safh
[57:11] walked.
[57:13] You see them on on YouTube. You you hear
[57:16] about them. People that we know
[57:20] claiming to have these gifts. Why? Not
[57:23] because it is a blessing to the
[57:25] congregation,
[57:27] but they're promoting themselves.
[57:30] The very same spirit of Ananas and Safh.
[57:37] We've walked that line. And now they're
[57:40] not sinning necessarily against the
[57:43] people, but they're sinning against God.
[57:48] They're lying
[57:50] and they're promoting themselves
[57:53] going exactly against this sermon on the
[57:56] mount. Do you see how important it is?
[57:59] Do you see how important the words of
[58:01] Jesus
[58:03] are? And it's important that
[58:06] we want to know the mysteries. But one
[58:09] of the mysteries that I don't understand
[58:10] is why aren't more people preaching
[58:12] about this? Why aren't more people
[58:15] telling the congregations,
[58:17] be careful with this stuff? Jesus
[58:20] promised that this these things would
[58:23] happen in the last days. And here we
[58:25] are. You need to walk this line because
[58:27] your life may depend on it and your
[58:29] salvation may depend on it.
[58:34] As I was praying about this
[58:38] and just examining myself like Lord, how
[58:42] many times do I fail in this and by your
[58:46] mercy that you have you have
[58:51] have forgiven me
[58:54] and now here I am and I want to present
[58:56] this to the church and say listen you
[58:58] all
[59:00] this these are the words of life and
[59:02] death.
[59:04] Just this very simple
[59:08] sermon that Jesus preached,
[59:11] it meant it meant a whole lot.
[59:14] This scripture came to my mind. Ezekiel
[59:16] chapter 33
[59:19] verse one.
[59:22] Again, the word of the Lord came unto
[59:23] me, saying, Son of man,
[59:26] speak to the children of my people, and
[59:29] say unto them, when I bring the sword
[59:32] upon a land, if the people of the land
[59:35] take a man of their coasts, and set him
[59:38] for their watchmen,
[59:40] if when he seeth the sword
[59:44] come upon the land,
[59:46] so he's st he's up in a tower and he's
[59:50] watching and [music] he sees an invading
[59:52] army coming out here.
[59:54] When he seeth the sword come upon the
[59:56] land, he blows the trumpet and he warns
[1:00:00] the people. Then soever hears the sound
[1:00:02] of the trumpet and taketh not warning,
[1:00:06] if the sword come and take him away, his
[1:00:08] blood shall be upon his own head.
[1:00:12] What I'm saying is, so the pastor is
[1:00:13] saying, friends, we got to dig into
[1:00:16] this. We got to take this stuff
[1:00:19] seriously because our lives and our
[1:00:22] salvation depends on it. It's not just
[1:00:24] something that you read.
[1:00:28] It's vital and I'm trying to do that.
[1:00:34] And whosoever he hearth the sound of the
[1:00:35] trumpet and take not warning, if the
[1:00:37] sword come and taketh him away, his
[1:00:40] blood shall be upon his own head. So
[1:00:41] they didn't listen to the watchman when
[1:00:43] he was crying out like, "Hey, be
[1:00:45] careful. Here comes the devil.
[1:00:48] Then whosoever he hearth the sound of
[1:00:49] the trumpet and taketh not warning,
[1:00:53] if the sword come and take him away, his
[1:00:54] blood shall be upon his own head. He
[1:00:57] heard the sound of the trumpet and took
[1:00:58] not warning, his blood shall be upon
[1:01:00] him. But he that taketh warning shall
[1:01:03] deliver his soul.
[1:01:06] So he heard the watchman was saying,
[1:01:09] "Hey, be careful with this. Be careful
[1:01:11] about doing your arms in front of
[1:01:13] people. Be careful about praying and and
[1:01:15] and and and
[1:01:17] drawing attention to yourself. Be
[1:01:19] careful about these things.
[1:01:22] All right? And then he took warning and
[1:01:24] he survived.
[1:01:26] But if a watchman sees the swords coming
[1:01:29] and blows not the trumpet and the people
[1:01:32] be not warned,
[1:01:35] then if the sword comes and take any
[1:01:38] person from among them,
[1:01:40] he is taken away in his iniquity. the
[1:01:43] watchman is and his blood will I require
[1:01:47] at the watchman's hands.
[1:01:49] So if we don't warn if the ministry
[1:01:52] doesn't warn the congregation of these
[1:01:54] things and warn ourselves. I mean when
[1:01:57] I'm reading these things I'm preaching
[1:01:58] to myself too
[1:02:01] then that minister will be responsible.
[1:02:04] But if you put out the warning and you
[1:02:06] and you encourage the [music] people,
[1:02:08] please don't do this,
[1:02:11] then you've done your job.
[1:02:14] And with this sermon
[1:02:16] on the mount, I hope you understand that
[1:02:20] these are vital things that Jesus is
[1:02:24] telling us.
[1:02:26] He goes to the biatitudes, the
[1:02:27] blessings. He tells us that we should be
[1:02:30] a light to the world, that we should be
[1:02:32] representing him. And then he says, "Now
[1:02:35] listen, be warned."
[1:02:39] His first words here,
[1:02:42] he says,
[1:02:45] "Take heed
[1:02:48] that you don't do your arms before men
[1:02:49] to be seen of them."
[1:02:52] He said, "Take heed that when you pray,
[1:02:55] you go into your closet. You're doing it
[1:02:58] to please God." And it's everything that
[1:03:01] we do, friends. Every move that we make,
[1:03:04] everything that we say, every social
[1:03:06] media post that we we post, make sure it
[1:03:10] is to lift up someone else or to lift up
[1:03:12] God. Because if we are lifting ourselves
[1:03:14] up, then we automatically we give
[1:03:17] ourselves a reward. And it didn't work
[1:03:18] out so well with Ananas and Safara.
[1:03:21] Amen. You with me?
[1:03:24] So take heed on these things, Daniel.

[1:06:48] Oh, I worship you for [music] you

[1:07:02] my God. That is who you are. And you are
[1:07:09] And you are way maker, miracle worker,
[1:07:14] promise keeper, light [music] in the
[1:07:17] darkness.
[1:07:19] My God, that is who you are. Let's all
[1:07:24] stand.
[1:07:27] I do believe
[1:07:30] that God wants
[1:07:33] people to stand up for what's right.
[1:07:36] Like the Apostle Paul, he stood
[1:07:39] and he had everybody against him. But
[1:07:41] God was for him. And even him, he had
[1:07:45] this thorn in his flesh that buffeted
[1:07:47] him. And the Lord answered so sweetly.
[1:07:50] He said, "Paul
[1:07:52] said, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[1:07:55] And he start he struggled with it with
[1:07:58] us. We have got to stand, friends. We've
[1:08:02] got to stand for what's right.
[1:08:05] this word what we heard today in these
[1:08:09] things that Jesus told us
[1:08:14] they could be the difference between
[1:08:17] death and hell and heaven and life
[1:08:21] they could be the difference between
[1:08:22] those the words of Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] and it's beautiful
[1:08:30] ananas and safara
[1:08:33] they made the wrong choice
[1:08:34] something so simple, so little as that.
[1:08:40] Jesus, how sweet he is to warn us of
[1:08:43] these things and to tell us,
[1:08:46] "Hey, listen. It's not about you.
[1:08:51] It's about me."
[1:08:53] [snorts] Because he is the one. Jesus is
[1:08:55] the one that really did. He saved us
[1:08:58] from our sins. He He made a way for us.
[1:09:02] And if we make it about us,
[1:09:06] then we have our reward.
[1:09:11] But if we make it about him, then we
[1:09:13] receive his reward,
[1:09:16] which is eternal life, joy. I read that
[1:09:19] scripture in um believe it was first
[1:09:22] Corinthians earlier. Eye is not seen and
[1:09:25] ears not heard. The joy that he has
[1:09:27] prepared for those that love him. Let's
[1:09:29] bow our heads. Our heavenly father,
[1:09:35] Lord, it's
[1:09:38] it's a frightening thing
[1:09:41] reading your word
[1:09:43] and seeing I'm sure all of us can see
[1:09:46] how much we fall short with these
[1:09:48] things. But Lord, we pray that you can
[1:09:50] look past our outward
[1:09:54] flesh and that Lord that you would see
[1:09:57] that
[1:09:58] in our hearts there's a desire, Father,
[1:10:01] just to serve you.
[1:10:04] Lord, if that desire isn't in place and
[1:10:09] those that are here, any of them that
[1:10:11] are here this morning or anyone that
[1:10:13] might be listening on, Lord, we pray
[1:10:14] that you would soften that heart.
[1:10:17] And Father, that that we would be able
[1:10:20] to accept your correction, accept your
[1:10:23] word.
[1:10:25] And Lord, everything that we do, we want
[1:10:28] to lift you up and praise you and point
[1:10:30] to you and say, I I am a failure. I am
[1:10:34] weak but he is strong.
[1:10:37] Lord help us. Bless us, Father. Bless
[1:10:41] all those that are out this morning sick
[1:10:43] or traveling. May your hand be upon
[1:10:45] them. And then Lord, prepare us for the
[1:10:49] week to come. May we stand strong,
[1:10:52] Father, standing for you in Jesus name.
[1:10:56] Amen.

[1:12:06] Way maker, miracle [singing] worker,
[1:12:10] promise keeper, light in the darkness.
[1:12:14] [music]
[1:12:14] My God, that is who you are. And you
[1:12:19] are.
[1:12:21] And you are way maker, miracle worker,
[1:12:26] promise keeper, light in the darkness.
[1:12:29] [singing]
[1:12:31] My God, that is who you are.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; He is. He's a way maker.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, I got to admit,
[1:12:41] confess your faults one to another. And
[1:12:43] I know I do it a lot. I uh last night I
[1:12:47] was studying on this and this story of
[1:12:50] Ananas and Safire and how Jesus was was
[1:12:52] telling us
[1:12:54] and I stood up in my office
[1:12:58] and I said, "Lord, I'm guilty.
[1:13:01] I'm guilty.
[1:13:03] This little thing that they did, I'm
[1:13:07] guilty of so much more. Lord, thank you
[1:13:09] for your grace. Thank you for your mercy
[1:13:12] on me. Lord, I'm sorry. [applause]
[1:13:16] Yeah.
[1:13:17] And all of us, we've all received his
[1:13:20] grace.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; We've all received it. Lord, thank you.
[1:13:25] Thank you for not letting me suffer the
[1:13:27] same as Ananas and Safara did, but thank
[1:13:29] you for recording it. So now I can look
[1:13:32] and I can say, Lord, I don't want to be
[1:13:34] that. I want to be just Lord, I just
[1:13:38] want to be a simple man that loves you,
[1:13:40] that that serves you, that thanks you
[1:13:43] for everything and and that's
[1:13:44] appreciative. Lord, I'm sorry, but
[1:13:48] you're great.
[1:13:50] You just you took it all away and you
[1:13:54] saved me and
[1:13:56] and he did for every all of us. It's
[1:13:59] important. Feels good. H all of my sins.
[1:14:02] I just I hate to do it,
[1:14:06] but I just take them and I lay them down
[1:14:09] on him.
[1:14:11] And those hands were nailed to the cross
[1:14:14] because of me.
[1:14:17] I mean, I'm not saying it's because of
[1:14:18] you. I'm saying it's because of me. And
[1:14:20] if I was the only one
[1:14:22] that he would have died, if I was the
[1:14:24] only one that needed redemption, he'd
[1:14:26] have done it for me. And he did he he
[1:14:30] did it for you. did it for all of us.
[1:14:33] And he was the one that could do it and
[1:14:36] all of these sins.
[1:14:38] I just Lord, I'm sorry. Like I did last
[1:14:41] night. Sorry.
[1:14:43] Here's more. I did it. Oh, by the grace
[1:14:47] of God, he wanted me to be in heaven. He
[1:14:51] wanted me to be with him.
[1:14:54] And it's not because I chose him. He
[1:14:59] chose me.
[1:15:01] And I'm going to grab a hold of him.
[1:15:02] Brother Manny, I'm never going to let
[1:15:03] go. Hold on to his feet and say, "Lord,
[1:15:08] like I believe it was Ruth and Boaz,
[1:15:10] wherever you go, I go. I don't want to I
[1:15:13] don't want to go anywhere where but
[1:15:14] where you go, Lord. And let me be a man
[1:15:17] to stand up
[1:15:20] for what you've done. Let me be a man to
[1:15:23] stand up for this man named Jesus
[1:15:25] Christ. Even though my family may
[1:15:26] forsake me, even though my friends, even
[1:15:29] though I might suffer at work, Lord, I
[1:15:31] want to be the best person I can. I want
[1:15:33] to be honest. I want to handle
[1:15:34] everything right. But when it comes down
[1:15:36] to it and those chairs start to be taken
[1:15:38] out, Lord, I will I will stand right
[1:15:41] there with you. And even if it's at the
[1:15:45] end, if it's just you and me, at least
[1:15:47] it's going to be you.
[1:15:50] At least you'll be there. And at least
[1:15:52] I'll be with you.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, friends. As a
[1:15:55] reminder, no service tonight. I'll put
[1:15:57] it um I'll send it out and I'll change
[1:15:59] the um the calendar. God bless you.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; I sought the Lord
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; and he answered me [music]
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; and he delivered me
[1:16:20] from [singing] every fear.
[1:16:25] And those who look on him
[1:16:30] are radian.
[1:16:34] They'll never be ashamed.
[1:16:39] They'll never be ashamed.
[1:16:44] This poor man cried.
[1:16:48] And the Lord heard me.
[1:16:52] [music]
[1:16:53] and he saved me from [singing] all
[1:16:58] my eneies.

[1:21:11] Sister Susan from some of your
[1:21:14] ancestors, the Jewish people. David
[1:21:16] wrote that song. And isn't it neat? And
[1:21:19] we are still singing it. Wow. The
[1:21:22] anointing of the Lord. I don't know how
[1:21:24] it sounded when it first
[1:21:27] when it first uh was sang. some Hebrew
[1:21:30] so I wouldn't have understood it but it
[1:21:33] sounds really really good in English and
[1:21:35] the way we sing it today. God bless you
[1:21:37] friends. I pray that God's with you.
