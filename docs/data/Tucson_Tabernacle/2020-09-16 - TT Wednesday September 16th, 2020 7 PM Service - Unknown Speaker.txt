we're all here together on the day of pentecost we've been hearing about going back to pentecost and the one thing that uh always struck me is that they were in one place and one mind and one accord and that's when the spirit fell on them so if we can just join our hearts together and get in one mind and one accord there's nothing that the lord can't do for us let's just go to him in prayer lord jesus we are so grateful for this opportunity lord to come before you lord and to just raise our hands and worship on our voices and praise lord we pray that the word that you have placed on the heart of our brother tonight lord would just come forth and the power and anointing of the holy ghost lord that you would help us to receive it lord in the way that you intend lord to strengthen us encourage us lord to clean us out lord to do whatever that work is that you want to do in our hearts this night we thank you again for this opportunity to be together lord we pray for the needs lord i

so i don't know how many people know it brother matt asked us to sing the song i give you my heart just try it if you know it sing it out [Music] lord i give you my heart i give you my soul i live for you alone every breath that i take every moment [Music] lord i give you my heart i give you my soul i live for you alone every breath that i take every moment [Music] my desires born with all my heart

[Music] is [Music] alone every breath that i take every moment i'm awake lord have your one more time o lord i gave you my heart i gave you my soul you want to tell him that now i live for you alone every breath that i take every moment i'm awake [Music] hallelujah amen is that your prayer tonight amen malachi chapter 4 if you have your bible amen we'll just go straight to the word tonight amen trust that you are doing good today amen we greet you in the name of the lord good everybody here i just want to say it's been a i've been disconnected here these last few days it's been a little odd you know you get so used to um having a phone and then you lose that phone and and you're not connected and and you you in some ways feel a little disjointed and not really sure uh you know but in other ways it's one of the best things that's ever happened to me and so um you you want to be connected but at the same time you know you you understand you need to be you understand that uh you know that there's people who need to reach you and and so fortunately today we've been able to get a a temporary foam lord willem will have a you know something more permanent here soon so if you've tried to reach me my phone is now working today just through text and through um through phone call i don't have whatsapps if you try to reach me on that it's just not nothing's working right now amen you love the lord jesus amen he's certainly good to us preach appreciate so much all of that singing amen and and that music and that worship amen we want to just continue where we were last wednesday on an axe experience and i want to just read malachi 4 we're going to read verse 5 and verse 6 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord now that's specific he's referring to the day of the lord and he says and he shall turn the heart here was the purpose and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse and so we know that that was dual meaning there was twofold there two ministries but under the same spirit of elijah we're glad elijah came in our generation amen and the purpose of that was to turn the heart away from something back to something amen let's just pray heavenly father we thank you lord tonight for the reading of your word we just thank you lord that you accompany you accompany us lord father for your prophet taught us that you come wherever you're invited so lord we have already invited you invited you lord but once again i raised my hand lord and just say i invite you to come to this pulpit come to this platform lord take your word for it's your word lord god and it's good i pray father you would take it lord may you break it lord is the bread of life to each and every single individual granted lord just visit us tonight we ask in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated we have again once again we want to just continue in a teaching mode or gear tonight as we just want to continue from where we were last wednesday and we spoke a lot on the axe experience and we sort of took a turn there at the very end uh uh involving prayer but we just want to continue in that direction i got a lot amen i've put together uh brother uh if you could put up the powerpoint this one we're gonna have but if you put up the one from last wednesday first and let's pick up where we were there um let me just get it open even here on my screen so i have it um if you just want to have that displayed and i'll try to get the slide for you amen we want to just i'm going to read a lot but i have some of this put up on the screen and so i believe it would uh would help you but we spoke last wednesday on an axe experience and the restoration of the book of acts church and we spoke a lot about the alpha and the omega the first and the last and what god was going to do in the first he would repeat in the last and that's prophesied in the bible but i want to continue with this first ephesian age uh that we looked at and uh we we begin reading here uh we'll begin at verse slide 11 brothers if you have that it should have been called cycle of revival sorry from from last wednesday hmm okay that's all right we'll we'll just have to sort of uh we'll have to make do that's all right well just pull up the one that you do have we'll start there brother branham says and he's speaking of that age he says that cycle of revival and death has never failed and he says all you have to do is recall this last move of god in the spirit when men and women dress like christians went to church prayed all night took to the street corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes or old store buildings and then he says they had reality and that's just a statement he makes they had reality but it wasn't too long a time until they begin to get enough money to build fine new churches they put in a choir instead of singing to god for themselves they put on put gowns on the choir they organized a movement and ran it by man they soon to begin to read books that weren't fit to read they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over the cry of joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with a form but the fire had died down and the blackness of ashes is about all that was left you're and brother brandon begins to speak here natalie he turns to this uh to this modern age and this is in the seven church ages that brother adams preaches in 1954. brother branham begins to say he says you're in a lukewarm age your evangelists are crossing the earth thank you that's the next one praise the lord we got it the next slide keep going to slide number 14. you're in a lukewarm age and your evangelists are crossing the earth around the earth preaching things like that you'll get nowhere you're hollering you baptist are hollering a million more in 44. what have you got when you got them just a bunch of sinners come in with their names on the book billy graham had that and brother branham refers this many times you'll hear him on the tape 30 000 converts and said in six weeks later he couldn't find 30. why why they never got nothing to start with just a bunch of sinners when they put their name on the book notice this under the spell of a revival they never got nothing to start with they they were just sinners and they put their name on a book and he refers to the billy graham meetings you know massive archer altar calls billy graham said he have thirty thousand and come back and won't have thirty the prophet of god begins to relate this because we know that just as that first age ended that ephesian age ended so very differently than how it started and now brother branham is going to begin to point to the to the the most recent revival which was the pentecostal revival and he points to that most recent revival and he says you know it starts off so good the fire is lit again and he says there's revival fires burning and there's a reality there god had done something very real as we spoke last wednesday the restoration of the gifts was a move of the holy spirit though it started and it turned into something very opposite of how it started the prophet of god said it was a framework it was something god used to further the church and brother adam says but you don't throw the you don't throw the framework out you keep the framework you don't throw it out but it was a framework and the prophet begins to point to that pentecostal age that pentecostal revival uh that starts under daddy seymour and welch and 1906 azuza street and he begins to point to that same revival and it was those same churches that had accepted his ministry a lot of the doors he uses that to preach you go and visit the life tabernacle in arkansas you you visit the uh the the church in in los angeles uh three or four major pentecostal churches that had opened their doors to the prophet's ministry and now he's coming to this place and he says you're in a lukewarm age and he begins to recall and he says he says why why why would you have a revival why would you have all these people that came to the meeting they gave their life to the lord and only just six weeks later they can't find 30 brother madam says why is that because they never got anything to start with you say well then what did they get they were under the spell of a revival it's pretty powerful when you think about it that within a real move of god there is a spell that people can fall under a lot of times people can come to get an emotional experience but never get the real thing and that that spell will hold them for so long even even for years an emotional experience can can stabilize and help you but listen to me brother and sister we need more something deeper than that that holds the individual no matter what they go through he says they were under the spell of uh revival now listen how he begins to relate this again and he says he says it's been very strange in our homelands here i know that's hard to see but just he says it's been very strange in our homelands here the people it certainly has alarmed my emotions to see of the coldness and the indifference that the church is becoming in north american continent in our country in canada also and then he goes back in his memory he says a few years ago i came into canada here and and and had a meeting now here he's in saskatoon he's in the same building he's in the same city he's in the same place but something has changed from the memory he's about to relate he says just a few years ago i came in here in canada here he had a meeting the tinsel was all over the meetings people was gathered to places where the newspaper had to report of people driving as many as 3 000 miles by taxi cab just to be in the presence of the outpouring of the spirit and tonight after much advertisement trying to cooperate with everybody showing the same spirit that we did when we first come yet it's hard to get a little group of people to fill a little small arena like this then you could wonder why it is that a minister's hearts are alarmed so what was he seeing there now this is just not just uh him just relating something and one spot we could read you quote after quote when brother adam starts saying that he he makes comments and he says now listen to me pentecost stand at your post of duty tonight and he says you there that were that you know that seen the revival fires burning he said but where are you at tonight and he says you better destroy delilah before she destroys you you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you and he makes that statement over and over and over again he comes to this place here in the same message and he says now brother tommy osborne the next slide told me that my minister if i've come here in tokyo this coming summer he'd expected at least two or three million converts ministry lord has given me seemed like it went over the head of educated people in the lands where they still have it's not taught they believe that god is real we've accepted him a mental conception they have but he says they have to have reality and when they see it that settles it tens of thousands swarmed to christ in one altar call and the same message the same effort that we put forth and maybe 200 300 whatever it would be here tonight now you see he's alarmed here he says over there in another country it fills up thousands of people and he says but we got the same message the same exact thing and he says and just two you know 300 people he's looking at numbers saying what's happening you know what what what's taking place through whatever would be here where maybe five or six tonight may come to christ where with the same effort across the sea would bring a hundred thousand to christ see that's the difference the revival has left our country we might as well just face it he goes on and he says here in the same it's a pitiful sight but why does this happen friend it's because that this condition has to come there's an atomic bomb laying yonder to settle the difference and that's right god can't pour out his judgments upon a just people it's just the hour there's nothing that can stop it all the preaching i can do all the resurrection christ could show everything will never stop it the bible said but here's what we're responsible for giving a voice against the wrong that's right i can never stop ladies from wearing little old vulgar clothes it's the nature uh the next slide it's the nature of them they already seen it the devil presented it they were subject to it i could never stop men from drinking certainly not i could never make the church spiritual all the preaching i would do it would never make it spiritual but there'll be one glory he says but there'll be one now and then that's a fish god wants him in the kingdom i'll give my voice i don't know who it is but i'll preach it and as i preach it he'll hear for all the father has given me will come to me that's right say brother matt what does it mean what do we do the churches it gets colder the numbers get thinner the crowds get smaller what do we do we keep preaching and we keep preaching and then one will hear it here and maybe one will hear a hearing surrender their life to christ because all the father has given me will come to me we could continue on if you put up my my newest one that i sent you tonight brothers the the other powerpoint so notice what brother brandon begins to say here any any and he says he says this is this was what was happening with that revival he says it was going on now what's so amazing about the culture even that we live in today and i'm just going to take my time with some of this here tonight if we don't get to get to it next wednesday i read an amazing statement you can just hold that screen up there i read an amazing statement by a theologian a man and he says he says we as christians in the western world are limited and suffer because we have a western understanding and perception and a western education and and he says the reason for this he says and when he was relating why we we have sometimes a hard time understanding spiritual things and he says a western education system is based upon greek philosophy and it's not based upon hebrew thinking but the bible was not written on greek philosophy the bible was written on hebrew thinking hebrew understanding a jehovah understanding a jehovah education can you say amen and so the difference between a hebrew understanding and a greek understanding is that greeks have trouble uh tying the natural with the spiritual now i want to see what my first is i want to make sure i got the right slide here before you display it uh yeah no we'll just hold that so just hold that screen there so a a a western education system is based upon greek philosophy and so the difference is is that greeks can never tie the natural into the spiritual to the greek they're not in any way whatsoever connected you have the natural and you have the spiritual but there's no connection between uh either one it's sort of like a deist who you know believes in god but believes he has no inner workings in in daily life in in the lives of of creation but the the greek theology our thinking is that there's no way that they're connected but here's what brother branham taught us the natural always types the spiritual and he says it's always that way you look at nature he says that you you watch how nature runs all nature i love this so much because it it just blows the minds of such simple uh teaching and it just blows the minds off of a high thinking uh theological mind oh nature runs in continuity and then brother madam would go to the seed and he would begin to look at life he'd begin to look at nature that's why he was a hunter why he loved to be outdoors because he learned about god in the woods in nature and he learned about spiritual things by looking at natural things you follow me and so the hebrew says our god who is spirit the god the great god uh elohim the self-existing one that great spirit created everything that's natural so everything that's natural whether it's science whether it's medicine whether it's uh a nature uh uh a climate uh a seasons all of it was created by god all of it was created by the lord the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof so everything within the earth is the lord's and so the natural and physical we learn from the message of the hour the natural and the the physical and the spiritual run very close together and so you notice the the man was making the point he says but the western theo western way of thinking uh has sometimes from that western view it affects us into thinking that any physical event can't have a spiritual effect it's very much like uh people have today with water baptism and you have most mainstream churches you know have uh have just you know chalked up baptism into well it means nothing it's really just uh it becomes more of an ordinance or just we do it because we the bible said we do it but it has no effect whatsoever now we know that baptism doesn't uh is it isn't uh regeneration it doesn't you can go down a as they say a dry center come up a wet center but but we know that there's that brother adam said everything that you do naturally can have an effect in the spiritual world and so they they've chalked up baptism i'm just using this as one example we're gonna go to many more they've chalked up baptism as ah you know it's not really necessary and and that's why it doesn't well then if it's not really necessary then it doesn't really matter how you're baptized you know they they it doesn't really matter you know we've debate we've had a conversation with a local baptist pastor there back home of a massive church thousands of thousands people he took an entire series on why baptism isn't important but they still baptize and they still and so i asked the man i said well then i guess it doesn't matter if someone wants to be sprinkled oh no no no we would never sprinkle some we believe in immersion i said well why does it matter baptism doesn't matter suddenly it doesn't matter if it's the name of the father he said well if someone comes to me and says he says i baptize people in the name of the father son of the holy ghost he says someone comes to me says hey will you baptize me in the name of lord jesus christ i'll do it he said it doesn't really matter i said well then if someone comes and says sprinkle me oh no i wouldn't do that i said well it's suddenly not that important you know when it's the name but if it's if it's the process immersion you know what it is is they can't see how something and i'm just going to come to this here the bible is full of a correlation between the physical and the spiritual you think of naaman who the bible says had to dip seven times to be killed of leprosy why why would naaman have to go in because there was a physical act was going to have a spiritual consequence in naaman's life you notice when jesus was to heal a blind person he the bible says he spit into the dirt and then he took that dirt and he he rolled it up and he put it on the man's eyes and the man's eyes came you know he could see it why was it because something natural was going to have a spiritual it was going to have an effect so you can you can see how that a a jew a hebrew thinking of how that burying and washing someone in in a bath of water can clean them on the outside it can wash the conscience as we baptize sister debbie sunday and i said what is this doing it's a it's a it's a it's grace for dirty people it washes your mind it's a fresh start it's something you're doing you know and you say whether it's uh whether it's public you know we do it publicly but it's not about everyone watching you think of was it uh i think it was philip who baptized the eunuch in the bible and the bible says it was no one but philip in the eunuch no one was there to watch except the baptized and the baptizer but you know who was watching heaven that's the only audience that really needs to take witness of your baptism and i'm glad jesus was watching can you say amen and so you notice this in the bible you ask this question do you receive the holy ghost by physical act well the answer is yes and no you notice that in the bible many people received the holy ghost after a physical act took place like laying on their hands now we know that was because it was the hebrew way of thinking laying upon their hands even after they baptized them so do you mean does it mean that we don't believe in physical laying on of hands of course not brother branham said in 1965 he said he still believed in laying hands on the sick by the by the the order of the bible of the book of james lay your hands upon the sick and they shall recover or danny minister by the lady known as the prophet of god said he believed in all of that you know people like to categorize and say well you know we don't believe in you know it's got a gentile faith you know is just to accept that it's true gentile faith is just say the word i'm a romans and jury and there's men if i say it he goes and he said jesus if you'll just speak the word and he says no greater faith have i found in all of jerusalem than this brother madam said what is it he says we have faith we're the faith seed we just accept it we don't have to have some physical event but it's brother matt that means that we shouldn't physical events can't happen that's not at all what it's saying you know what i love the prophet of god says he says he says god will meet you. at whatever level of faith you have man that makes it so good he he prays for a woman and and and she's struggling about whether she has the holy ghost or not and brother and praise and in his prayer you hear me says lord he says now i know because of the sign this woman's born under she needs she needs something to happen he says the lord will you now now what he doesn't say is now my sister you ought to just have better faith here you're seeking some physical experience speaking in tongues or some kind of sensation you know sister you should just you know whether you know we believe the message well you know i i i can't believe brother man doesn't do that at all he stops in praise and he says lord now the sign that she's born under he says she needs something to anchor her faith he says so lord give her something say brother brandon what does that mean it means god will meet you at whatever level of faith if you only have just this little bit god says i'll take that don't you just love him it's whatever level of faith you have god will meet you at that level we believe in spiritual worship but we also believe in physical worship that's why we raise our hands in church it's a physical act that has a spiritual consequence brother said what is a sign of surrender you're surrendering to the holy spirit we believe in clapping our hands it's it's we believe in singing with our voices not like in california california governor says just hum we don't believe in humming we believe in singing because it does something when the when the when the redeemed of the lord say so with their mouth that they they something comes out of them it's it's it's more than just a something that you think in your mind but something physical has a spiritual we we play music we have pianos we have instruments we have gifted singers we have people that sing you say why is that for the man we just fulfilled a religious duty no we're making a physical act so that heaven will hear and something spiritual will take place is that what we want we use our bodies the bible says present your bodies as a living sacrifice which is your reasonable service we believe in the body we we give our bodies we use our bodies to worship god the bible new testament is full of people who lifted up holy hands clapping shouting to god what are they they're physical acts that have a spiritual effect baptism is a physical act that can have a spiritual effect people say i don't want to do anything i don't you know i don't want to do you know anything with my body uh you know i just want to worship in the spirit but the the bible says the hebrews worshiped god with their bodies they danced before the lord they they clapped before the lord they sang before the lord so we physically do things because they have a spiritual effect and so you say i'm just going to and the lord just directed me to go this way and it was just perfect timing we had a baptism on sunday every christian needs two baptisms one in water one in spirit and until you receive the second baptism you're not born again now where we get in trouble with this is some people say well you know after you're baptized then you've got to go through this training period and then maybe i don't know three weeks four weeks maybe six prophet of god said that that it doesn't have to be he says people people live in varying degrees of sanctification you remember that statement and he said they've never they've came out of egypt but they've never crossed in over jordan into canaan and he says they live in this varying degree of sanctification they're not really ever born of the spirit of god they're clean but they're empty and brother branham says for some and i've watched for some that process can be years and they go from one revival to the next revival they go up and then they go down and then they go up and then they go down once they're in once they're out brother adam says but but but but in the house of cornelius while peter yes spoke these words all three justified sanctified filled with the baptisms of the holy ghost just like that prophet of god says we don't have to go to terry in jerusalem up in an upper room and waiting on the holy spirit it's as you speak the word you believe the word god quickens that faith to your heart and it can happen just like that water baptism cleans you it washes you but it doesn't fill you it leaves you clean and empty and let me just say this a a a clean christian who is empty is in a very dangerous spiritual condition in fact more dangerous than before they were clean they were better full of the devil dirty than clean with nothing in them some of the most miserable christians you'll ever meet are those who are clean crystal clean just couldn't put a spot on them but they're empty jesus warns and he gives us a warning he says it's dangerous to clean your life up and to wash everything and wash your entire life but to leave it empty because you get one demon out and the bible says that when the spirit leaves when an unclean spirit leaves a man it goes into dry places and he says and it gets seven more spirits worse than the first and he says and he comes back to the house and he finds it swept clean crystal what is that that sanctification you kicked everything out everything's out you but what jesus is pointing to is a legalistic uh legalism where you get all your all your eyes are dotted all your t's are crossed everything's clean everything's swept everything's empty and jesus says but he findeth he findeth that it's an empty house and he takes those seven spirits and he brings now he had one to start with now he has eight and jesus says and the condition of that man is worse than when he started and it's vital that once we are cleaned we get filled that's why you find in the bible as soon as they were baptized in water they laid hands on them that they might receive the holy spirit what a miserable spot to be in clean clean crystal clean but empty because you have no pleasure in sin and no joy from salvation you're caught in the middle are you here tonight religion and i'm going to preach a lot on this before we close religion is dangerous let me go further religion is blinding but the prophet of god said one of the strongest spirits to break is not a demon spirit of alcohol it's not a demon spirit of drugs it's not a demon spirit of pornography or or you know some you could think the most horrible the prophet of god said the most hardest demon spirit to break is a religious spirit hello there's such a difference such a disparity such a distinction between religion and relationship sometimes jesus says that comes out with seven more spirits and a lot of times the reason why the man's condition is worse is because those seven spirits are religious spirits and it leaves the man in a worse state than before he was cleaned up because now he's religious now he's got something and brother branham says the heart is spirit you could break as a religious spirit because they're right you can't tell them anything so it's important you say brother matt what's important not just to get cleaned not just to get the spirit out not just to get let me just make it real practical it's important to get cleaned absolutely it's important but not just to get sin out of your life but to make sure you get filled with something besides sin not just to get sins out of a person's life but to see he gets filled with something else or let me say it better someone else because that's what you need is someone not something and people look for some things they find church they find doctrine they find intellectual doctrine and they study the message they study and what is it it's an intellectual spirit they get a lot of religion but they don't get the person i'd rather know the author than his book before brother branham said because nature hates a vacuum nature hates a vacuum and human nature hates a vacuum so if you're just clean but empty that's a very dangerous spot to be in you become what i call a negative christian i don't smoke i don't drink i i don't cut my hair i don't curse i don't do any of those kind of things i i don't i don't do that i don't i don't go to their movies i don't do this and i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't but you you don't but what you don't do but what do you do what a way to live they don't have as we said they don't have pleasure and sin they don't have pleasure of salvation they're locked in the middle and what does the bible call the middle the wilderness they're out of egypt they're dying in the wilderness because all in all deep down in the core of their heart they're longing for the leaks and the garlics they're longing for egypt they never came into the experience of the baptism of the holy ghost now this is what the lord just led me to minister so i'm just going to keep on you get all the bad things out but none of the good things come in to take its place so one life one baptism cleans your life one fills your life one cleans you from the past and one fills you for the future and so we're dealing with the person who has repented they've believed they've been baptized but there's something more than repentance there's something more than baptism there's something more than that they've died with christ they've been buried with christ but now they need to be raised with christ to a new life and you say brother matt what does that come from from pentecost which people immediately freeze up and say well did you mean to say that but that's exactly what i meant to say because it's it's what is pentecost it's an experience what happened 2000 years ago wasn't just a historical event but it's to be repeated in every believer that's why paul said i am crucified with christ i'm buried with him and so i'm raised with him brother madam says when you rey when he raised you raised in newness of life and so the prophet of god begins to say this now notice what he says about this first church and this is what's this is where we wanted to come to you know it's amazing because we we we asked this question we read ours opening scripture malachi 4 i'll send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so why let me just start here by saying why a message why an elijah why a prophet what was on god's heart what was on his mind what was the need of the people what would the condition be of the church why a restoration why a prophet why an elijah and and so one of the major purposes uh to give us the bible and we can just ask some rhetorical questions here well you know was the message coming to give us uh uh you know a greater understanding of the bible was it coming to give us doctrines was god concerned because we wouldn't know who melchizedek was and he was so concerned i'm just going to cindy line just so they know who melchizedek is was it so that we could understand the seals what was it was it so that we could the message came so that we could all know what took place in the garden of eden and that that's that's all it was that's what god was concerned about that god was so concerned we wouldn't know who the horse rider was of revelation the white horse rider and so god was going to send a message to make sure that we knew well you say brother matt what is it it could be it could it's it's me for many purposes you could give purpose after purpose after purpose but let me just say this what i find it's essential to understand why god sent a prophet we know he needed to send a prophet for the elected but what was the elect in need of knowledge intellectual knowledge so that we are smarter than the baptist and smarter than in this group over here are more intellectual we understand more about the bible than them was it a name did we need a name a new denomination to name ourself we we needed something to be called so we're called message believers let me let me just give you what the bible says it was for in the book of job chapter 2 it says tell your children and your ch let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the palmer worm has left half the locust eaten and that which the locust has left half the canker worm eaten and that which the canker worm hath left half the caterpillar eaten but ver chapter 2 verse 25 says and i will restore people so full of the glory of god till they shouted and spoke with other languages and went and martyrs for the faith let's earnestly contend for that faith until death shall set us free earnestly contend for that boy that's a speech there heard a lot of great politicians get a nation risen up and you know can get an army or you win some churchill it gives a powerful speech and an entire nation comes at the anointing of that speech let me give you this speech if the presence of the living god abroad of pentecost with power with signs with wonders brought a people so full of the glory of god until they shouted and spoke with other languages went became martyrs for the faith and let's earnestly contend for that faith until death shall set us free how many can say amen if god brought forth his first branch out of that vine was a pentecostal branch with power visions revelations healing sanctification holy spirit the next branch will be the same thing certainly will every time every time that vine puts forth the branch it'll be exactly like the one was at the first place the martyr stood there without a bat of his eye he knowed where he was standing he know who he had believed he was able knowing this that god could raise him up the last day because he promised it before he'd bowed down to any man-made oldie old dirty rag sap lines he'd die on that stump brother and says hallelujah let me die the same place if my god doesn't come in my generation i'll die on the stump where the cankerworms eat it believing that jesus christ and his church and his word is the same yesterday today and forever oh if brother branham were here that's exactly what he'd preached to you jesus is still the same yesterday today and forever i might not be able to produce it out in all these branches because old sap lines come out here of denomination and creed cut me off and drop me like a hot potato that might be true but i'll stand loyal on the stump and cry that the hour will come god will restore his church to its former condition this is just a turn but i want to read it from the lacie in church notice this now this messenger of malachi 4 revelations 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the heart of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations which are which are a lot of people don't like that but that's what the messenger said he said he will reveal the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally so something very physical that literally notice that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers a lot of people have focused on the mystery truths and not the result that the mystery truth was to bring the focus wasn't the mystery it was what the mystery revealed would do to a people it would literally turn their heart to believe in the god of the bible to say lord if you did that there you're still the same here if you if i could find an example there brother adam said god is no respecter of persons what is that that's apostolic faith to say lord if you can heal then you can heal now if you could deliver then you can still deliver now if you could feel with the baptism of the holy ghost you could still do it lord he says exactly so the pentecostal fathers he says he turns this abraham's covenant confirmed he turns the heart of the children back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers so it'd be back to the original message you'll know when it gets here it'll be a restoration to send that lukewarm ladies in church to the original faith back yonder again and this time he's to take that same faith because they got away from the original faith he's going to turn the faith of the fathers of the children back you know except for the matt why are you why are you reading all this he's going to turn the faith of the fathers and children back to the father's the pentecostal fathers another acts 2. why because i find it's so amazing to me that people who believe the message yet they have no idea the purpose of why god sent a message we've made it so many other things listen to me brother and sister as i've said this here before it does not matter what i say the message is it does not matter what you say the message of the hour is it doesn't matter what i tell you the bible is you know what the bible is the bible is what the bible is the message is not what anybody makes it it's not what any group makes it and a lot of people have made it something that it was never intended to be the message of the hour is the message of the hour it speaks for itself and people don't they they they they they believe the message but they have no idea this was the purpose do you realize this was the heart of god to turn your heart back to bible faith not to 1906 people get scared when you say message was to restore us to pentecost oh no he's taking us back to pentecost back to the denomination back to speaking in tongues back well it may be that but we're not pointing you back to azusa street we're pointing you back to the book of acts the alpha church because the omega would reflect the alpha the first and the last what god did in his first church he wants to do in all the ages pentecostal faith you say what is it brother matt is it is it is it speaking in tongue it could be that that's part of it absolutely that's part of it oh that's the least of the gifts then what you're saying is you don't even have the least of the gifts people are so quick to say that have you ever spoken in tongues no it's the least of the gifts well then you've never even had the least of the gifts does all speak with tongues well paul made it clear no not everybody does but that does that mean that tongues is something of yesterday no god still speaks a nuns brother adam says that if you ever go deep enough in prayer i believe you'll speak in tongues i i'll just i'll give you a a let me just if anything to to increase your faith i'll give you you know just a brief uh not even really a testimony because it take too much time to tell it i'll just say that you know the lord in my prayer closet many times uh now but the very first time was just one of the the most i would just say that i'll say it this way the lord took me in prayer and uh and just was praying and just really seeking the mind of god for certain things just asking god uh uh just just to just for for something specific very specific in my life and was just praying and just in my prayer closet there forget how long i had prayed you know i'd been in the prayer closet for for a long time forget how i just forgot about time and just begin you know that feeling you know you pray and and i'll just be honest with you tonight many times you pray most of the time that you're praying you know you're not feeling any kind of lightning bolts or flashes or anything spiritual necessarily but you know you're communing with your heavenly father you know you're listening because the bible said he would listen when you pray that's how i know because the bible said so jesus loves me this i know for the bible tells me so the bible says we're here this is our confidence that when we pray he heareth our prayers i don't need any other answer than that i don't need a handwriting on the wall the bible says he listens and so he listened to my prayer and i just got to that point very special and unique sometimes you pray and then other times you pray through maybe it's more rare than the you know the times when you're just praying it seems very natural you know as we've said here before serving the lord most of the time is a very natural feeling experience but there's sometimes god does something very special and i remember praying there i had a leather chair there and just in front of me and was just holding on to it and i just remember i felt the holy spirit just it moved beyond my words and beyond beyond praying and suddenly i just felt a presence just drop into the room and i knew that's the holy spirit it's right there right now and i remember when that moment happened i grabbed the leather i literally just grabbed it maybe even damaged the chair i'm not sure but i grabbed the chair and i felt like i was i felt like like like jacob that's what i felt like i'm not leaving until you bless me i felt like lord now i've got you here now i'm going to plead my case with you i know your presence is in this room and i grabbed a hold of it i said lord i've got to have an answer from you and just at that very moment that's the last thing i spoke in english just out of nowhere the angelic tongue and started praying in that tongue and and it seemed like the more i spoke in that tongue the less i could try to get back to my english language and the more it more and more until i finally just felt like it took over my whole body and found myself in the corner of that office corner in that office just in a fetal position over in the corner and and every time i'd open my mouth it'd come out in a different tongue and then i felt the holy spirit the angel of the lord just come down right there in that room let me just let me just testify to you that was the most unearthly experience i've ever had in my life you know what it did to me it brought me closer to the lord it was the most supernatural experience i've ever had and i and then after that i remember i'll never forget after that and it's happened many times since then the holy spirit just you know uh not always but sometimes you go into prayer and the holy spirit just comes on the scene and and you know i remember i remember after that experience happened i sat there and after it left it's as fast as it came and it felt like it wouldn't stop it just was gone just like that just immediately and i couldn't have i couldn't have you know uh uh imitated it at all you know there's a real tongue there's the bible says that though i speak paul said though i speak with the tongue of men and angels there's an angelic tongue you can speak you know then there's tongues and prophecy interpretation where god brother madam says god gives now now i remember i sat there in my chair and i'm just crying just crying but just shaking experience changed me for days i remember for for two or three weeks i was so affected by that experience and i i remember i stopped and thought of myself i thought why would anyone ever not want that to happen that's what i couldn't figure out i thought i heard these people preaching against and i'm thinking why wouldn't why would someone not want that to happen i live in this natural carnal flesh enough man a little minute of breaking out of this cardinal getting into the supernatural dimension why wouldn't anybody want that well anyway we could say a lot more on that we won't brother and says what was it it was it was this time he's to take the same faith another acts 2. that's right another one he said brother matt does that mean we all speak in tongues paul said no not all speak with tongues or we're not preaching that to you at all but the prophet another place says away with experiences for a measuring line people always look to some kind of experience but the devil can always impersonate that experience but does that mean god can't give you an experience absolutely god can give you a very physical experience he promised malachi 4 that he would do this manifest his word to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers again back to the original pentecostal word the real bible word the pentecostal they claimed pentecostal organization there's no such a thing pentecost is an experience can you say amen can we get a whole hearty whole wide church-wide amen pentecost is an experience not an organization they tried to organize it but you can't see it doesn't organize pentecost is an experience it's the seal of god the holy spirit that can't come on the day of pinnacle and how was the book of acts wrote start reading it look how we've contaminated it with all kinds of foolish things of our own but there'll be someone come someday a light before the going out this open door that's set before the church watch and see it if it doesn't come some of these days god will send the elijah just as certain as i'm standing in this pulpit he will sin and that elijah will shake the people right straight back to the original pentecostal doctrine now start out at pentecost see how it was see what they did see if it'll be shaking hands it'll be right straight back and when peter preached on the day of pentecost up there when they was all fit of the holy ghost and speaking in other tongues these men said now what can we do to get it peter said repent have you have a church that's marching to rock and roll music they're not marching to led zeppelin they're not marching to ac dc to some heavy metal band they're marching to christian music to the time of rock and roll it's prophesied literally you're seeing it fulfilled brother branham says you billy called me the room says daddy look he said if i ever seen a bunch of rickets he said singing gospel hymns through the time of rock and roll snapping tapping their what was it it was rock and roll music christian so what do they do they become more relevant well the bible has jesus said something very clear he who is a friend of the world is the enemy to god nadab and abbahu aaron's sons the bible says they mixed strange fire and if you look at your your your bible there if you have a scofield bible in the very bottom it says says strange fire was a mixing of holy fire and unholy fire so and what did what did god do god killed nadab and amahu because gee because if you go read the verse there the bible says god says because you'll have a separation he says this this won't be tolerated because there must be a difference between what's holy and what's unholy and they don't mix but today they they have nothing to offer so they have substitutes and young people mostly are disinterested in god they're disinterested in they're just interested in church you even have today church a young person who has you know trouble you know paying attention or or listening you know in church there's a disinterest there's if i could just be playing here there's a boredom we're bored there's there's a border to it let me just say this to you a young person is not bored with god they're bored with religion they're not bored the world is not bored with god they're bored with religion and what religion has produced all kinds of religions in the world today you have buddhism you have hinduism you have christianity you have catholicism islam you have judaism you have mormonism all of these different isms and religions today even in the christian religion today how many uh someone could tell me i think it was over two hundred thousand that could stand correction denominator religions in the world and how many how many denominations within the christian church alone hundreds baptist and pentecostal nominations methodist presbyterian church of christ lutherans episcopalians christian church united methodist free methodists a christian science seven days business jehovah's witness on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on he said brother matt what is that religion man's religion religions of the earth the bible says that oh you know you've said it said it well there there may be you know many religions you know there may be many religions but we all worship the same god well that's the same thing that islamic terrorists say we all we all believe in allah then they take planes and crash into a building so jesus said i am not a way i am the way i'm the only way and unless you believe in me you'll die in your sins but religion you know even even today you know and let me just say this who invented religion where it is where do you find religion starting in the book of genesis which is the seed chapter the beginnings and you find cain brother branham says cain was very religious he was more religious than abel was that's what brother madam says he's more religious than abel was religion is just a cloak it's a covering satan was at the very heart the very beginning of religion well you know i believe in god you know i'm a oh yeah you know i'm a christian i believe in i believe in god well james says you believe in god you do well so does the devil and his angels and they tremble you know the the the demons shudder at the at because of god they believe in god let me say this to you right uh here there's nothing that makes god more upset than empty religion i would that you were hot or cold but because you're lukewarm i'll spew you out of my mouth is that what he said hello there's nothing that turns god's stomach more and literally brother adam said it literally nauseates him than just empty religion religion without relationship the religion you notice it was the religion it was the religion of the jews that literally blinded them put them in complete spiritual blindness by binding them with rules and they had regulations and they had laws and it was all bondage and it was all fear and you know what jesus was to them jesus was a threat to their religion he was a threat to their boundaries he was a threat to all of their rules and and so the bible says that who were these scribes they were the experts they were the experts on the law of jewish religion it was it was in that those very experts it was in those very religious teachers in the tenor and the synagogues teaching the priest keeping the people under bondage in so much that they were blinded from the messiah what blinded them sin no religion can i get an amen is everybody still awake do we need to stand and then have you be seated y'all still here it was the religion that was blinding to them it was religious leaders who turned his house into what jesus calls a den of thieves supposed to be a house of prayer where people the hurt and the hungry could come to and get fed where the lost could come to and get saved jesus walks in one day and sees what they had turned into it was a complete chaos and the bible says jesus went in the temple and began to cast out those who sold and bought inside the temple and overturned the tables of the money changer changers whipped them you say what was that that was righteous indignation and what was it it was it was religion oh you religious cheaters oh you blind pharisees he calls them oh you blind pharisees with your traditions you've made the word of god of no effect oh i stop at that for a moment and say my brother my sister let's make sure we don't let the traditions make the word of no effect to where our church just becomes religious duty or a religious building a religious act that would take place and let it be the presence of the living god this is the heart of my message here tonight so just give me a minute just to finish it it was it was those same religious leaders who crucified the lord of glory it was those same religious leaders notice jesus wasn't killed by a you know a bunch of uh you know signed protesting atheists wasn't murdered by them he was murdered by religious leaders in the name of religion it was it was it was priests who claimed to know the law who claimed to know the word of god it was the sanhedrin council the the the it was the pious those who were devoted to the law yet yet blinded by their own religion blinded by their own tradition matthew chapter 7 says not all who are religious are godly many of them many will say in that day lord lord didn't we do many wonderful works in your name and we and we cast out and we we healed the sick and we opened blind eyes and jesus says and i'll say to them depart for me you that work iniquity i never even knew you what does that knowing speak of a relationship there's such a difference between religion laws codes traditions and relationships and you can believe the message and have laws and traditions and rules and regulations and miss the relationship with the person and none of those laws or regulations or traditions will save you they won't separate you and declassify you in a different group are you here you say what does it mean brother man it means that it's going to take more than just religion it's going to take revelation it's going to take a revelation that produces a relationship inside of your heart god jesus isn't coming back for books he's not coming back for tapes he's coming back for people who those books and tapes live inside who that word lives in he's not coming for church buildings church buildings are beautiful you some of the beautiful some of the most beautiful buildings that you could ever go and look at go to germany and go look at some of the prettiest structures you could go into as churches man just stand there and look at the beauty uh and on this it's all been dedicated unto god dedicated to the glory of god but the glory of god isn't in cathedrals it's not in steeples it's not in buildings not in beautiful temples mark 13's all these great buildings and structures all of it all the brick and mortar all of the greatest structures doesn't doesn't that's not not where the glory or the power of god dwells the the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands the bible says but in hearts of human vessels earthen vessels marred clay god deposits the very life zoe life and the seed gene of god you know you not you are the temple of the holy ghost and the spirit of god dwelleth in you what he said paul said in first corinthians 6 the spirit of god dwells inside of you not in temples made with hands there's nothing sacred about a building nothing nothing it's absolutely nothing brother branham would would tell about teleteller and the branham tabernacle not to run through the church it wasn't because the carpet was sacred prophet of god said don't run in here don't chew chewing gum why was it because of the beautiful pews no he said because the holy spirit stays here so if you take the holy spirit out like this building might as well it could be a bar could be a club it doesn't matter the building there's nothing sacred about any of it what makes it sacred is the presence of who's here that's why brother adam said the ever presence of the living god is the lifeline of the church not a building you know god won't send one person to hell for not coming to church church doesn't make you a christian no more than a you know sitting in church doesn't make you a christian either more than you stand in a garage does that make you a car no doesn't and sitting in a church your whole life doesn't make you a christian saying i believe the message doesn't make you a believer i belong to this group i belong to that group i belong to this it's what paul said i was the strictest of the strict i was a pharisee of pharisees but after paul's castle's conversion he said i counted all is dung it means nothing to know christ means nothing oh the only thing that means anything is to know him to know hillman's life i say today what we we don't need we don't need i'm going to close this we'll finish it next wednesday we don't need religion god's not looking for religion or duties or people who keep religious holidays or or or or or ordinances god's looking for a living tabernacle that he could dwell in that he could fill with the baptism of the holy ghost and they could live just as you say what kind of life can they live the brother adam says that the word meets the challenge of the hour you can't meet the challenge of the hour but the word of this hour meets it and that word can live in you i could say lord let it live in me oh musicians could you return as hands maybe you could raise a hand and say lord let it live in me let it be down on the inside of the inside fill me with it lord fill me with your holy spirit fill me with that heavenly dove oh not just religion not just not just uh you know ideas or theories or doctrine but i want the life i want the person i want my heart maybe you could stand to your feet tonight and just worship the lord raise your hands to the lord say lord i want my heart to be turned bow your heads with me maybe raise a hand say lord i want to know that my heart's been turned
