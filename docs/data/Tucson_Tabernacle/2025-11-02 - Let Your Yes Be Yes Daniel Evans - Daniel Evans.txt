Brother Daniel a few weeks back has mentioned that we're going to be getting some interviews from the people here in the church. Um so that's what that is. If you're uncomfortable with the camera, just know we already have cameras here every service. It's no different. So just wanted to let you know what's going on. Amen. Would you stand with me this morning? We're going to sing Holy Forever. There's a scripture that prophesies that there will be a day when every single knee will bow and every single tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord. And we've said it before, but we don't have to wait till then. And we can start right now. Amen. Let's put up the first verse to holy forever.

We're going to have uh Brother Lyall open in prayer and bring the prayer request before the Lord. Before we sing it, let's sing that old hymn of the church. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound [music] that saved a wretch like me. Key of F. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that save a rich like me. Oh, I once was lost, [singing and music] but now I'm found. I [music] was blind, but [singing] now I see. It was grace [music] that taught. Let me hear you. Was grace that taught [music] my heart to fear and grace my fears [singing] breathe. [music] How precious did that [music] grace [singing] appear. The [music] hour I first believe through many dangers. through many dangerous toys to [singing] snares. I [music] have already come [singing] to [music] grace that brought [singing] me safe. thus [singing] far. Oh, and grace will he be home when we've been there. And when we've [singing] been there 10,000 years, bright shineing as [music] the sun. [singing] We've no [singing] less days [music] to sing God's praise [music] than when we first began. Let's raise our hands and sing. Praise [music] God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [singing] Oh, praise God. Praise God. [music] Praise God. Praise [music] God. Praise God. Praise God. [singing] Praise God. I'm really lying. If you have a need, as you know, you can raise your hand and the Lord will see your need. Even if you don't raise your hand, he already knows it. But you raise your hand in faith that you know he's going to he's going to answer. He's going to be there for you. And then if you don't have a need, you can raise your hands and worship to him this morning. He is worthy of all praise. [music] Good morning and God bless you all. You know this morning we were reading in our devotion about uh [music] when the ark was brought into the temple that Solomon had just built and when the people were in unity with one voice [music] and the musicians were in unity. Everything was in unity in one accord. And then the spirit of God came down in such power and such presence that everything had to stop. They just had to stop in awe and worship of God. And I pray this morning that as we're joined together here, that our hearts are joined together, our minds are joined together, our thoughts are joined together, our spirits are joined together, our hearts are joined together as [music] one in Jesus Christ. that we can approach the Lord together and [music] just invite his continued presence because his presence is surely surely here. We have one written request this morning from brother John and sister Anne Lucer. Please remember an as she travels to Pennsylvania tomorrow to be with family as her father's health is failing. Thank you for your prayers. And sister, we pray that God go with you and minister [music] to your father and to your family that's there. So, let's just join our hearts together in prayer. Lord Jesus, Lord, it's such a privilege. It's such an honor, Lord, to be gathered here in 2025, Lord, to look back at Calvary, see the price that you paid, Lord, that you made the way for each one of us by your grace, Lord. that in spite of our the many dangers, toils, and snares that we've come through, you've seen us through them all. Lord, we just pray that you continue to be with us. Help us, Lord, to bring as many as we can with us, Lord, as we someday will be there for those 10,000 years just warming up. Just just a warm up, Lord. Lord, we just thank you for your love, your mercy, and your grace. We look forward to the word this morning, Lord, to to instruct us, Lord, to draw us closer to you, to to correct us, Lord, and Lord, just to help us be the people that you want us to be. We pray that you'd bless the offering that's offered this morning, Lord, that it'd be used for the purposes that please you. We thank you for everything. Thank you for each other. And Lord Jesus, we love you. We thank you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Ly. You can all have your seats this morning. We're gonna sing this song. It was a great thing that he did for me. Key of G. Go ahead and put the just the chorus up there, Brother Tim. Just [music] to start off, it was a great thing. How many know this song? Few hands. Okay, it's pretty simple.

Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. I started clapping. Nobody started clapping. So, I'll clap just just the music. We'll start with just the music and clapping. Then we'll add voices.

We're going to sing this blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's always good to be in church. It's always good to sing songs about the goodness of Jesus, what he's done for us. Brother Daniel's going to come. Let's just enter into an atmosphere of worship really this morning. So when our pastor comes, there'd be nothing in the way. Just be a good let may the Lord come down and dwell in the praises of his people right now. There is a blood that cost a life. There is a blood that cost a life that paid my way. death its price. And when [singing] it flowed down from the [singing] cross, my sins were gone. [music] My sins forgot. There was a grave. There is a grave [music] that tried to hide this precious blood [music] that gave me life. But in three days [singing] he breathed again [music] and rose to stand [music] in my defense. [singing] So I come [music] to tell you he's alive. to tell you that [singing and music] he drives every tear that falls. So I come [music] to shout and to proclaim [singing] to shout and to proclaim [music] that he's [singing] coming back for you. There is a blood. There is [music and singing] a blood that sightes the blind and sightes the blind that heals the sick that heals the sick. The [music] lonely the lonely [singing] finds. It has the power. It has the power [music] to free the bound as chains [music] that [singing] fall upon the ground. So pour, so pour it out to [music] cleanse my soul and let [music] it liquid. Glory [singing] flow [music] because he lives [music] to make me whole. [music] I owe my life. [singing] I owe my all. So I [music and singing] come to tell you he's alive. To tell you [music] that he drives every [singing] tear that falls. So I [singing] come [music] to tell you that he's safe. To shout and to [music] proclaim that he's coming. So I come. [singing] Oh, so I come [music] to tell you he's alive. [singing] to tell [music] you that he dries every tear that falls.

[music] Oh, what [singing] can wash away my sin? Nothing. [music] [singing] Nothing. Oh, what can [singing] make [music] me whole again? Nothing [music] but the blood. [singing] Nothing. Let's sing that again. What can wash away? Oh, [music] what can wash away [singing] my [music] sin? Nothing. [music] Nothing. [singing] What can [music] make me [singing] whole again? Nothing but the blood. [singing] Nothing [music] but the blood. There is a grave. There is a grave that tried to hide this precious blood that gave me life.

Do you believe that this morning? Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Amen. God bless you friends. Let's bow our heads. Lord God Almighty, we thank you, Lord. Thank you for your spirit. Thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you for your love. Thank you for the blood that was shed on the cross, for our sins, Lord, that we might spend an eternity with our savior. Lord, we pray that your spirit would be present with us this morning. And Lord, as I open up these scriptures and as I read the word, may the same spirit that was there when it was originally spoken be with us this morning, we pray. Father, may each person that's here, if they would have something on their heart, something that they would need, I pray that they would receive it this morning. That all of us would leave this building better people. Father, in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated. First welcome to our visitors. I have uh brother Brian, Sister John Vanden Langenberg. Where are you? Welcome, brother, sister. Welcome. It's good to have you in service. is I think that you know a lot of people here probablyize [applause] for all the construction out out here and and ripping up all the concrete. You know, sometimes you have to rip things out. You have to tear something down to rebuild it in the right way. And it's the same with us. The Lord sometimes has to tear us down &gt;&gt; so he can rebuild us in the right way. We could we could take the sanctuary and we could just slap a coat of paint on the walls, but it's the same wall. It's just got some paint over it. It's the same wiring behind the wall. The problems are still there. But when you tear something down, when you really get rid of the old and replace it with, the Bible says the new man, &gt;&gt; then you have a change. Not just changing the outside, but Jesus goes in and he changes the inside of a person. That's what we've been talking about on this sermon on the mount. We'll continue that in a little bit, a little bit later on, but that's what the whole thing about Jesus Christ is. Before Christ, it was the outside. Jesus didn't do away with the law, but he fulfilled the law and he started to work on the inside of a person so that word could come out from the inside and manifest itself on the outside of us. I want to give a report, a short report on the trip that uh Daniel and Lily and I went to Louisville to do an outreach. I asked the church to pray and and we went I sent a video when we were there. We um it wasn't what we expected and uh if if you want to put the picture up of the place that we had. This is our um the location. We expected about 50 or 60 people. We got about what we expected and uh we had our service there in that room. We um my brother bought dinner for everybody and it uh as I said it turned out different. Thank you. It turned out different than what we expected. What we wanted was my brother talked to all of the it was a gym if you don't know if you're not familiar with it. So we started this boxing gym about six or seven years ago and we wanted to make it an outreach to the local community and it's done very well. We have a Bible study every week. Many of the uh fighters that have come in have made changes in their lives and and their families. So, what we wanted to do is take the next step. And the next step was to have a service and to open up the altar for those that may need something to come in to come down to the altar and give their hearts to the Lord. So, what we were planning on Adam got everything together. He got everything rented and he and he uh had it catered. He spent a lot of money putting all this together and a lot of prayer and a lot of work that he put into it. He asked me if I would minister. So, we brought uh Lily and Daniel out to do the music and my nephew Adam's son also helped with the music and we had it all ready. And what we were going to do is we were going to have good worship and then I was going to speak and I was going to open up the altar and all of these people that had not given their hearts to the Lord, they were going to come to the altar. They were going to give their hearts to the Lord. They were going to be crying and there was going to be big changes in all these people's lives. And we had it figured out and and we had it ready. everything we had. We told the Lord what we wanted and he reminded us that he's in charge and not us. &gt;&gt; That's what I wanted. That's what my brother wanted. And that's not the way it turned out. We went there and we got about the same amount of people as we were expecting, but they weren't the people we were expecting. It wasn't the sinners, the gang members, the inner city ones that showed up. They didn't show up. Very only two of them really came. But who did show up were a few of the leaders in the community. Two young pastors at a church who were just starting a church right down the road. They came. We didn't know. Um, a pastor that I knew of a fairly large church in Jeffersonville, he came, which I wasn't expecting him to come, and um there were uh a number of more of the leaders in the community that came. one uh brother came that he's he's kind of a pastor, but he has this big building and they actually bring in some of the the poor people and give them a place to stay for the night if they need a place to stay and give them food packages in that big beautiful beautiful building that they have. So they they showed up and the coach for the mixed martial art uh part of the gym, he showed up with with his fighters and they're already Christians. They're good men. The the leader is he lost his son last year. His 19 I believe he's 19 drowned and it just really really hit him hard. tore him apart and he doubled down and he said that that was one of the pivotal times in his life and he was just kind of riding the fence. He could have just went off into the world and done his thing or he could have just jumped in with both feet to serve Jesus Christ. He jumped in with both feet &gt;&gt; and tremendous testimony from him. We had him open up the service and I ministered on on some things and uh which I'll share in a moment. And uh some other ones that showed up is uh David Andes, you know, Daniel Andy's ministered here for a while. His brother, a friend of mine, we worked together when I was in Jeffersonville. He showed up and one of the pastors, one of the young pastors that had recently been, he'd really been in the saddle for like two weeks. He had just been elected pastor of his church. They don't have a church building. They're renting. And he showed up and and he had a jacket that said Andes Roofing on it. That is David Andes and and Daniel Andes's brother has this company. Well, he ended up he was he worked for that company and he had no idea what we were somebody just had invited him and it was the community. So he came he had no idea that we were close with Andy's family. So here he is and he meets David and David's like, "Hey, that's my name and that's my brother." And he says, "Oh." And then they they start talking. So it was it was really we could see that the Lord was with us. So, we didn't have this outpouring of the Holy Spirit that we wanted. But we have to be careful in not trying to put God in our own box and try to make him meet our expectations. Because I tell you, if we do that, it won't be as good. It won't be as farreaching if we get our needs met. And then it really becomes about self. I wanted just me, my flesh. I wanted to see these these young people coming together and coming to the altar. I wanted to see that. I wanted to see them from my sermon come up there and just be touched and fall down at the altar and just start praying and start worshiping. I'm going to talk. Take a time out here. Gotta lace up the cleats or I'll fall over. Um, that's what I wanted, but it isn't what God wanted. There was, by the grace of God, one young man came to the altar and gave his heart to the Lord. And that was, that was beautiful. But what we had, we had these two young pastors who had recently been elected. They have a church of about 100 people. They have no building. This other man is a leader in the community. He's got this big building that he does all of this uh humanitarian work from and nobody to occupy it and they never met each other and they were literally two blocks from each other. So they get to get well I talked to both of them and I said hey I want to introduce you to him. Pastor with no building and congregation meet brother with building or a pastor with congregation and no building meet brother with building and no congregation. And then they got together and this other man that I knew this other pastor is a fairly large church over across the river in Jeffersonville. He had the resources and he has the resources to help these people and to mentor these people. And afterwards I just felt for some reason I look and it and I I think we had beautiful music. The the um Lily and Daniel and Benjamin did a great job. And I ministered and my sermon didn't really didn't really do anything. And I'm I'm thinking, well Lord, what is going on? Why do I feel good when I went home? And I felt good because God used this to build a foundation for something that's coming. And so when I was talking with Adam, Adam was like, "Man, I'm sorry that all these fighters didn't show up. I don't know why." I said, "Adam, if they would have shown up and they would have done what we wanted and they would have fell down at the altar and they would have given their hearts to the Lord Jesus, where would you have sent them?" They didn't have a place to go in that community where they lived. They're not going to drive an hour away or 45 minutes away. They needed a place right there. And what happened was we built that foundation. And now the Lord, I believe the Lord is going to use what happened. And it's going to be a much greater work than what we wanted to do, what we were expecting. God was in it. Can you imagine when the Apostle Paul when he went to the church at Ephesus? He went there, there weren't 60. Like in Louisville, there were 12. Can you imagine when he got there how he felt? It's like, wow, just 12 people. And he stayed there for three years and ministered to these people, building and building and building. And then he turns the church over to a young man. We all know his name. His name is Timothy. The church continues to grow. But way back when it was 12 people, Paul saw that there is potential there. He didn't just say, "Oh, there's not enough people. I'm going to go to the next place." He didn't say, "Oh, well, nobody fell down at the altar." You know, none of this. All he said was, "Have you received the Holy Spirit since you've believed?" They're like, "Whoa, we don't know that there is a Holy Spirit." and he tells him how to be baptized. And then it started to grow and grow. And then here comes Timothy. And Timothy takes over and continues it to grow. And then another man came there in the in the last years of his life. One of the greatest people that we have ever seen in this Bible. His name is John, the beloved disciple of Jesus. He ministers at Ephesus. And he continues to grow to where Ephesus was, if it wasn't the biggest, it was one of the most important and biggest hubs of Christianity in that whole area was Ephesus. Started with just a little group. And I look at what happened with our trip. It was not what I wanted, but thank God it wasn't what I wanted. They would have came to the altar. They would have done what we want, what we, our measure of a success is. And then they would have just gone right back and it would have worn off and they would have been the same people that they were before. But now we have these men who are invested in that neighborhood, in that area that have a burden. All of them are doing outre outreach work and helping out. They're doing everything that they can. They have a burden. I jump in. I'm going to leave. Adam has a burden. And Adam is working now with those men and they're putting they're helping get this thing together. Now, those pastors are going to start teaching the Bible study. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's going to it's just Thank God. Thank God &gt;&gt; that he didn't do what I wanted him to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [applause] I spoke on and we ministry is is such an important thing and if you really have a burden from for the people it's not your ministry that matters. My friend Steven Bryant sent me this quote this morning from Charles Spurgeon. He said, 'If sinners be damned, at least let them leap to hell over our dead bodies. And if they perish, let them perish with our arms wrapped around about their knees, imploring them to stay. If hell must be filled, let it be filled in the teeth of our exertions, and let not one go unwarned and unpaid for. &gt;&gt; That's how it should be. You're going to go to hell over my dead body is how we should be saying it with everyone that's around us. With our children, with our friends, I stand for Christ. And brother or sister, if you're going to go to hell, if you're going to choose to go to hell, I'm going to do everything I can to keep you from that place. And that was what Jesus Christ did. He came here. He gave his life. He went to the cross so we wouldn't go to hell. He was spit on. A crown of thorns was pressed into his scalp. He was laughed at. He was stripped naked and hung up on a cross dying for all of us so that we would not go to hell. &gt;&gt; And if we have his same spirit, we should have the same motives as Jesus had. &gt;&gt; I told a story. I was the night before um the outreach meetings. I woke up at uh like 4:30 in the morning and there was a time difference. So, it was like 1:30 here. And for some reason, I feel like the Lord laid an experience that I had a a couple weeks ago on my heart. Very common experience that all of us have have been in. I was driving and I came to a red light. There was a truck, a pickup truck in front of me and I I was behind the pickup truck and the it was a nice pickup. It was a a man about my age. He had a beard about like mine. He uh the you could tell he was well off. You could tell he was conservative. And I was just I when I pulled up, you know, you can sometimes see him in the in the the mirror, the side mirror. I could see his face in there. and I pull up behind him and the light turns green and he doesn't go. He's distracted with something. So, I'm like, "Okay, how do I handle this?" I obvious can tell right now I like this guy. Um, what do I do? Do I give him a little do I just not do anything or do I give him a little tap or do I do like so many people do and lay on the horn go stupid, you know? And so I have this quandry. Not that I would ever do that, the latter. Um, but I'm I'm I'm sitting there, the lights green and I just give him a little tap and he looks up. Oh, sorry. And he he goes, "The Lord brought this back to my mind in the middle of the night and I actually woke up and I was preaching on it and this man that was in front of me, I feel like he represents so many so-called Christians today where the light is green and they're sitting at a green light and they're not going. They're just sitting there and they're causing the people behind them to get backed up and sometimes it takes a little tap. Sometimes it takes something a little bit more. But the point of it is move. The lights green. Go. And with these folks in in the the Louisville outreach, I told them, I said, "The lights green. You leaders in the church, hit the gas, start doing something. Don't just sit there and look around and daydream. Go. And that's the way a Christian should be. We should always have that thought. I'm not just going to sit at the at the green light. I'm going to go. I'm going to do something. Jesus, when he came, the first the first record we have of him besides when he was about 12 years old, he came he came to John the Baptist. He gets baptized. He's John says, "I should you should be baptizing me." And Jesus is like, "Well, yeah, that's true, but it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness." He's like, "John, you and me. We need to fulfill this." John baptizes him. He comes out. He goes into the wilderness. He's tempted in the wilderness for 40 days. All the temptations that you and I feel, Jesus felt those. He was a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. He knows how it is to have a desire that you shouldn't have. Jesus knows how it is. He overcame it. Then he comes out of the wilderness and he starts preaching, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." And then he gets his disciples and he brings them to this place on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, a hill there. And he starts to preach his first recorded sermon. And I believe it is the greatest sermon that has ever been preached in the history of mankind. And that is this sermon on the mount. He starts out with the biatitudes. We've gone through those those blessings. And then he gets into and we're in Matthew chapter 25. He gets into he says, "You have heard it was said of old time, thou shalt not kill." He starts in the ten commandments into the law. He says, "I didn't come here to do away with the law. I came here to fulfill the law." And he says, "You've heard it said of old time, thou shalt not kill. And whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of judgment." The sixth commandment. But I say unto you, whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. Jesus is starting to work on the inside. The law was working on the outside. You have heard it said by them of old time, thou shalt not commit adultery. Seventh commandment. But I say unto you that whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. And Jesus talks about divorce, which we went over a couple weeks ago. And now Jesus is going to reference the eighth commandment. We know it as thou shalt not bear false witness and other state statements in the Torah about lying. We go to read. Let's start in Matthew 5:33. And let's get into our scriptures. It says this. Matthew chapter 5 verse 33. Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, thou shalt not foresear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine knows. But I say unto you, swear not at all. Neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is his foottool, neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. Well, the sisters do today. I'm just kidding. But we can't. You have to dye it. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou cannot cannot make one hair white or black. But let your comm communication be yay yay nay nay. For whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. Now, it seems like these first couple script scriptures I read, it seems like they're about swearing an oath. And James, one of Jesus's disciples, his halfb brother, um, is probably quoting Jesus in his epistle when he writes this. James 5:12 says, "But above all all, my brethren, do not swear either by heaven or by earth or with any or after any other oath, but let your yes be yes and your no be no, lest you fall into judgment." Same as what Jesus said on the sermon on the mount. So James was probably and you'll see many of the disciples will quote Jesus in their in their ministries. So many people read these scriptures in James and in Matthew and they come up with the tradition that we are not supposed to swear an oath. Court of law. Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth? So will help you God. I do. And then many Christians will say, well, we're not supposed to swear. We're not supposed to do that because James and Jesus said not to do it. So, I can't swear that oath. And friends, so often people look at the New Testament with an Old Testament mentality. Now, here's a rule. We're not allowed to do this. But remember, Jesus isn't working on the outside. Jesus is working on the inside. He wants a change of a heart of heart. And the point of this scripture, when you do that, you miss the whole point. When you say, "Okay, well, I'm not allowed to do that." No, no, no. You're missing the whole thing. The whole the the meaning behind that is Jesus says is saying that you should always be honest. &gt;&gt; You should never have to swear. You should never have to ever promise or or say, you know, I swear on my mother's grave or whatever. You never do that because every word that you say should be the truth. &gt;&gt; Everything. And he's saying that if you have to swear, there's something that you're doing wrong before you have to swear. &gt;&gt; Verse number 33 again. Again, you have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, thou shalt not forcewear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. So the Jews is what he's saying here. The Jews just by tradition, they would swear by something greater than themselves. And we do the same thing as God is my witness. I never said that. God is always your witness. He hears it all. &gt;&gt; You know, I sw I I swear to God, you hear sometimes say, why are you swearing to God? Why won't you just speak the truth all the time? &gt;&gt; I swear by, as I said before, I swear by my mother's grave. Again, they're trying to add more credibility to your words when you should just always be telling the truth anyways. So the Jews had too much respect to swear by God. So they would swear by something a little bit lower than God, but still something greater than themselves. So they would swear they would say, "I swear by the temple or I swear by Jerusalem or I swear by heaven." And then saying these things was was something like saying I swear by something a little bit lower than God just to give me a little bit of wiggle room maybe in my statement. You see when you were kids you know I promise I didn't do that. That's not Jesus is saying don't do that. I'm not talking about opinions. I'm not talking about uh some people say, "Well, I'm just too honest." No, what you're really saying is, "I have no wisdom." And I say whatever comes into my mind. When people say, "I'm just too honest." Honey, do I look fat in this dress? It's like, don't lie, but use wisdom in your answer. You don't have to give your opinion all the time. It's like, do I look fat in this dress? And did you see the Dodgers won the World Series last night? 11 innings. No, you say something like, you know, that's I've never liked that dress. That's not my favorite dress. I'd rather you wear something else, you know. But don't don't just lie because then that lie will propagate into something else. And you should it should be addressed maybe. So I'm I'm I'm gesting a little bit. But even something like that, something as simple as that, it can result in something bad if you lie about that. So what God said in the Old Testament was really that you shouldn't swear, but that you shouldn't do that you should do what you promised that you would do that you should do what you say. He's not saying don't swear. He's saying do what? Do what you promise to do. Do what you say. But I say unto you, verse number 34, swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne. Remember the Jews would say, I swear by heaven. He's like, "Don't do that. That's God's throne. It's still God, nor by the earth, for it is his foottool. Neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king." You can't swear by these things. This is all God. So, you're really just you're just lying. Don't Don't do that. It doesn't add it should not add any credibility to your statement at all. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black, but let your communications be yay. Yay nay nay for whatsoever um whatsoever is more imp more than these cometh of evil. Big statement right there from our Lord Jesus. New International Version says all you need to say is simply yes or no. Anything beyond this comes from the evil one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said 56 times in the book of Matthew, I tell you the truth. You read verily, verily. That's all that we don't talk, we don't say verily, verily today, but we do say, I tell you the truth. And that's what he was saying. I tell you the truth. Like 50 times in the book of John, he says the same thing. I tell you the truth. The fact is that Jesus was the truth. And what I'm trying to get at is how important it is. The truth is John 14:6 Jesus said unto him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the father except through me." John chapter 4 says this, "But the hour is coming, and now is Jesus speaking, when true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and truth. For the father is seeking such to worship him. God is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. We talk about the spirit all the time. But do we talk about truth as much? It's both. We should never ever speak a lie or speak a halftruth or propagate a lie. Facebook started in 2004 and that kicked off modern social media. Have you ever shared a post, shared a Tik Tok video, shared a YouTube video, shared shared an email, shared whatever it is? Have you ever forwarded something like that? You put your name on that post. whatever it is, you're sending it out. You're sharing a news article that some whatever it might be that this celebrity is is heading up a um child trafficking scheme or something like that or Donald Trump's working with the Pope to create a new world order or something like that. You see that? You see it? You you forward it along. It's harmless, right? Well, I didn't write it. I just forwarded it. Here, read this. I don't know if it's true, but read us, man. Man, that's messed up, isn't it? Your name, both physically and spiritually. Your name is now tied forever to that thing that you just forwarded. Your posts on social media are forever recorded on on cyerspace. You can't if you delete them, they're still there. If you forward something now, you are tagged with that article. You are now part of that and you own it. If it's a lie, if it's an exaggeration of the truth, you are part of it. You forwarded it. It is now within you. It is now on you and it can't be deleted. And everything that we say too, there's God's recording angels. We have this in cyerspace in the natural world and we have God's recording angels recording everything that we say and tying it right back to our name. &gt;&gt; You hear something about someone, you repeat it. If it's a lie or whatever, now you are guilty of that lie. &gt;&gt; If it's an article about something, whatever it is, and you forward it, now you are part of that lie. Remember the last lesson? If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out. Because it's better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go to hell. &gt;&gt; The stakes are very high. We think, "Oh, it's just an article. I didn't write it, but you forwarded it. You sanctioned it." Well, I don't know if it's true, but and you still propagated it. I don't think we understand the seriousness of our words and everything that we do every single day. Jesus said, "If you just hate a man, you're you are in danger of going to hell." There's a awful thing that happened. It's called the big lie. I'm going to read I um I wrote this from different articles and I want to read it to get it right, but uh the protocols of the elders of Zion. Could you put up that picture? It's one of the most evil publications ever printed. And I'll read I'll read what it is. Thank you. You can take it down. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a fabricated text purporting purporting to detail a Jewish plot for global domination. Largely plagiarized from several earlier sources, it was first published in Imperial Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. It played a key part in popularizering popular popularizing belief in the international Jew in an international Jewish conspiracy. The text was exposed as fraudulent by a British newspaper in 1921 and by a German newspaper in 1924. So friends, if there is something that's wrong, I don't believe that we must keep quiet. I believe that we can stand up and say, "No, this is wrong. But we don't want to take it an a step further into gossip. But beginning in 1933, versions of the work were assigned by some German teachers as if they were factual to be read by German school children throughout Nazi Germany. It remains widely available in numerous languages, in print, and on the internet, and continues to be presented by anti-semitic groups as a genuine document. It has been described as probably the most influential work of anti-semitism ever written. Although Nazi Germany perpetuated centuries old lies about the Jews, this time those lies would have their most devastating effect. Like never before, anti-semitism was manifested in a sweeping national policy. This is in Germany known as the final solution. which sought to eliminate Jews from the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; To accomplish this, Adolf Hitler and his minister of propaganda, Joseph Gobles, launched a massive campaign to convince the German people that the Jews were their enemies. Having taken over the press, they spread lies about lies blaming Jews for all of Germany's problems, including the loss of World War I. One outrageous lie known as blood liel dating back to the Middle Ages claimed that Jews engaged in the ritual killings of Christian children and use their blood in unleavened bread eaten at Passover and a lie. Using the Jews as a scapegoat, Hitler and his followers orchestrated what they called the big lie. This theory states that no matter how big the lie is, people will believe it if you repeat it enough. Something as outlandish as those things that I just read, if you keep repeating it and repeating it, people will teach their children those things. People will start believing those things and they will present them as the truth. If you keep repeating it enough, no matter how big the lie, think on religion in these things, in this context, a burning in your bosom, say the Mormons, something that might seem scriptural. You're praying about about accepting this Mormon faith, and it might seem scriptural after you get this burning in your bosom, but it's not. But if you say it over and over, you think that it is the word because it's said so often. You think that it's in the Bible when it's not. Catholics, they constantly give homage to Mary. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus, now and at the hour of our death. Over and over and over, they say it, and then it becomes scripture to them. becomes real. Oh, well that's that's what's the word says. It is not what the word says because you won't take the time to stand back and question how you believe and dig into the Bible and say is what I believe right? And it happens so often things that people think this is a fact. This is how God speaks. This is exactly what it is. And it's said over and over and over. And then they teach their children the same thing over and over and it just becomes real. This is just how I believe. This is just a fact. And when in fact that it is just a big lie and it has done nothing but pull us away from the Bible and Christ. The thing that I say a lot, it's always Christ. Plus, anytime you add something in there that diverts your mind, diverts your eyes from Jesus Christ and his word, which points to him. Every every word in the Bible, as we were talking the other day, points to Jesus Christ. And if anything comes in and points you to something else, question it. One of the stipulations for the peace agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was that the Palestinians stop teaching their children that it's an honor and morally correct to kill Jews. Teaching their children. The big lie. Oh, it's good. They're not real people. They're evil people. And it's said over and over enough to where they believe it. And it's normal when we raise our children up with rhetoric. How can we expect them expect them not to believe it? And then they will teach their children and their children and their children. And I go back to the Mormon faith. It was all made up in the beginning. And then you have 10 million people or whatever it is believing this Book of Mormon that was a that wasn't even real. We should never just believe what we hear. Whether it's on the news or social media or something that we've grown up saying or something we always hear at church. Our words have meaning. friends. I was flipping through YouTube this morning and um looking for something that something else and I saw a recent video came up of a minister calling a man that I used to work for when I was in Jeffersonville calling him the Antichrist because his do his doctrines were wrong. I don't mind disagreeing with someone, but when you start raising it the to the level &gt;&gt; of saying that he's possessed by a demon or something like that, whoa, you've gone too far. Now you're getting back over here where they were in Nazi Germany or wherever it is, and you're propagating these lies. And then people are going on and I saw the comments on his on his uh YouTube page. And it it was like, "Oh, brother, thank you for telling us the truth. Thank you for doing this. What do you What are we doing calling each other names like that? I don't care how much I disagree with a brother. We should never attack someone like that and calling them an awful name like that. That is horrible." And that propagates hatred among the people. And then it propagates a church that has a chip on its shoulder and that's willing to say bad things about other thing other things and willing to to share these videos. When you say things like that, you are outside the word of God. I mean, I believe it's in the book of Jude. The Bible says that even Michael the archangel did not bring bring a railing accusation against the devil. But he said, "God rebuke you. Satan, even Michael the archangel didn't do it." And here we are saying bad things, saying these things and propagating these lies about other people. We are in direct violation of what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 5 and all throughout his ministry and in what the disciples said. I disagree with a whole lot of things in the Catholic Church and what it stands for. But I would not lower myself to saying that even the pope is the antichrist before these conspiracy theories and you and your name is tied to each one. Friends, what what if the post is wrong? Now you've lied and have you repented of it. And it's so easy today to not repent. It's like, "Oh, well that one wasn't wrong or or or that one was wrong. Well, I'll just forward the next one." And if it doesn't happen, you just go on to the next post. Jesus said, "But let your communication be yay, yay, and nay nay. For whatsoever is more than that, more than these things comes from evil. There's a a man that prophesied that uh you probably heard of it that the rapture was going to happen on September 23rd and 24th. How many have heard that? Anybody see that? Oh, more than I thought. [sighs] after he predicted that rapture would happen on on September 23rd and 24th. I mean, they were on there. They were doing a live feed. They were expected to be taken up and everything was going to go blank and the rapture was going to happen. It didn't happen. So, then he goes and he changes his prophecy. Oh, well, maybe I got the numbers wrong. And he he sets another date. Three times this guy did that. And the last one of the last things that he said, I went on there and I saw some of the of the comments made on his YouTube page. This is the guy prophesied September 23rd, prophesied whatever it was in October, prophesied another. It didn't happen every time. Here's some of the comments. I'm a Nigerian. I got my own confirmation in December 2024 before you came out. Nothing can change my mind. The man's name is Joshua. I love you, brother Joshua. Failed. A failed prophecy, but I'm going to dig in. I believe you, Joshua. Stand strong. We understand you, brother. Jesus is coming. Sounds good. September 23rd, 24th did not fail. But is the start of the rapture event that extends through the Feast of Tabernacles, which is over, by the way. The rapture time frame now being watched is for October 13th and 14th or shimini at past. It's believed that the current delay is because of the 21 because of a 21 day a 21-day war in heaven that occurs before the start of the rapture great tribulation. And he goes on for paragraphs to explain this. Digging in say I was not wrong. I'm I'm right. Just a comment. Another comment. When Jesus and his brothers were supposed to go to the Feast of Tabernacles together, Jesus decided not to go yet because he was waiting for his father's timing. Just because he didn't come on time doesn't mean that he's not coming. Keep your lamp keep your lamps trimmed with oil with oil. Again, making an excuse. Sometimes it's time to step back and say, you know what, I was wrong. But this stuff spreads around the world now with social media. Brother Joshua, I see the spirit of God rest upon you because of this scripture, 1 Peter 4. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the spirit the spirit of glory and God rests upon you. All the insulting that's going on now is only because you stand with our Lord Jesus Christ. Take your reward for great great is your reward in heaven. We love you, brother. I understand you don't want to condemn the man, but he got up there and told the world that this was going to happen. Another one. I was asking God for weeks for confirmation about a rapture that you said. He gave me one, but I wasn't satisi satisfied. So I gave then he gave me another confirmation. Then yesterday while I was taking a nap, he brought he brought my spirit to an open field. And then when I looked up in the sky, it was perfectly blue. No clouds except the numbers that were written in the blue sky. 23 23 23. And they was and the way it was written is like God using a a board pen, but it was a cloud. I was shocked. When I woke up, I felt so heavy because people out there are sleeping and numb. of supporting a false prophecy. And these people are saying that I was right when I believed it and I passed it on to everybody else and now I'm just going to dig in and say that I'm right. social media. When you forward one of these posts, your name is written right on there forever. When you post something, it is you that's saying it. Let your yay be yay and your nay be nay. It's not okay, friends. It is not all right to post something wrong or say something wrong and just go on to the next thing. Jesus is saying that here. He's saying everything that you should that you say should be truthful. I don't have time to go through these, but let me just read some scriptures. Just sit back and listen to these Old Testament and New Testament. Zechariah 8 says this, "These are the things [snorts] that you are to do. Speak the truth to each other and render true and sound judgment in your courts. Do not plot evil against each other and do not love to swear falsely. I hate this, declares the Lord." Psalm 15. Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who may live on your holy mountain? The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who who speaks the truth from their heart, whose tongue utters no slander, who does no wrong to a neighbor and casts no slurs on others. Mark 7, the Lord Jesus, what comes out of a person is what defiles them. For it is from within, out of a person's heart, that the evil thoughts come. Sexual immorality and theft and murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lwdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly. All these things come from the inside and defile a person. Colossians chapter 3, the Apostle Paul, you used to walk in these ways. He's talking about sinful life in the life that you once lived. But now you must also rid yourselves of all things as these anger and rage, malice, slander, filthy language from your lips. Do not lie to each other since you have taken off your old self with its practices and have put on the new self which is being renewed in the knowledge in the image of its creator. See how Jesus Jesus went after the inner man, not the outside. Proverbs chapter 8. To fear the Lord is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance. Evil behavior and perverse speech. Proverbs 11, a gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy person keeps a secret. Think about social media. Proverbs 2019, "A gossip betrays a confidence, so avoid anyone who talks too much. James chapter 1. Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight reign on their tongues deceive themselves and their religion is worthless. They do not keep a tight reign in their tongues. They deceive themselves and their religion is worthless. Friends, think about it. Think about the the bar that that the Lord sets before us. And we think just I'm not against social media by any means. I think social media can be used for the Lord. I really do. But when we are just forwarding things along, what if they're wrong? What if it's false? Now you have lied to as many people as you sent it to and however many people they sent it to. The worship team can come. We have a friend. We have a saying, friends, that a man is only as as good as his word. We've heard that. Well, you're only as good as your word. I'll go a little further to say that a man is his word. That's how important our honesty is. We are what we say. John chapter 1 verse one says, "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God." So God is his word. So we made in the image of God are also our word. How important is honesty in our lives? How important is telling the truth? &gt;&gt; I'll close with Matthew chapter 5:33. I'll read I'll read it again. Hopefully it's a with a little bit more understanding this time. Matthew chapter 5:33. Again, you have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, thou shalt not foresear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I say unto you, swear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, neither by the earth, for it is God's foottool, neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou cut not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be let your communication be everything that you say. Let your communication be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these comes from evil. Jesus said these things. And do you see when we deviate, when we stray a little bit from the scriptures, do you see it can create a big lie. We see politicians do it all the time. The Russian dossier for Trump. They knew it was wrong in the beginning and they purposely spread it. Lies. And then we hear them so much and they become real. The things that we say, the things that you teach your children, the things that you say to each other, the little sayings that we have, go back and say, you know what, is that scriptural that I say these things, the religious words that we say? go back to this Bible and say, "Is that what this Bible teaches or is it just that what I learned?" He raises the bar high and he puts it upon the believer and says, "You do these things. If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off." He's not saying, "Get a saw and saw off your hand." He's saying, "Get to the root of the matter. If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out. He's not saying to spoon it out because you just look at the bad stuff with the other eye. He's saying get to the root of the matter. And here he's saying, don't swear by anything. You shouldn't need to swear. Yeah, if you have to go to court and you have to put your hand on the Bible, that's fine. But your word all the time, every day should never have a lie in it. Never. And Jesus warns us that anything more than the truth cometh of evil. Very the Lord Jesus. As I said before, when I read this sermon on the mount, it's why I like in my ministry, I believe the Lord's led me to just read the whole don't skip over. Don't take a verse here and over there and over there and try to put them into a sermon. Read it all in context. One of the things that when you read it in context, you can't just skip over part of it because maybe I'm not living up to it or maybe our church doesn't think that that's important. If it's important enough to put into the Bible, if it's important enough for Jesus's day, it's to say it's important enough for the man for us to believe. Amen. Amen. I speak Jesus, brother Tim. First verse. I just want to speak the name of Jesus. over every heart and every mouth. [singing] Cuz I know there is peace within your presence. I speak Jesus. Verse two. I just want to speak the name of Jesus [music] till every dark [singing] addiction starts to break. [music] Declaring there's hope [music] and there is freedom. I speak Jesus. [singing] Cuz your name is [music and singing] power. Your name is heing. [music] Your name is life. Break every stronghold. Shine through the shadows. Burn like a fire. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I just want [singing] to speak the name of Jesus over [singing] fear and all anxiety. [music] To every soul held captive by depression, I speak [music and singing] Jesus is your name. Oh, your name is power. Your name is [singing] healing. [music] Your name is life. [music] Break every stronghold. [singing] Shine through the shadows. Burn like a fire. [music] Oh, shout Jesus from the mountains. Jesus [music] in the streets. Jesus in [singing] the darkness. Over [music] every enmy. Jesus for my [singing] family. I speak the holy name. Jesus. [music] Oh, shout Jesus from the [singing] mountains. Jesus in the streets. Jesus in the darkness over every enmy. Jesus for my family. [singing] I speak the holy name. Jesus. [music and singing] Sing it again. Shout Jesus. Oh, shout [music] Jesus from the mountains. Jesus in the streets. Jesus [music and singing] in the darkness over every enemy. Jesus for my family. I speak the [singing] holy name Jesus. Cuz your name is power. Cuz your name is power. Your name is healing. [music] Your name is life. Oh, break every stronghold. Shine through the shadows. Burn like a fire. I just want to speak the name [singing] of Jesus over [singing] every heart and every mouth cuz I know there's [singing] peace within your presence. I speak Jesus &gt;&gt; again. I assume the Apostle James. The pastor of Jerusalem church was quoting the Lord Jesus when he said this. But above all, my brethren, do not swear either by heaven or by earth or with any other or with any other oath. But let your yes be yes and your no be no, lest you fall into judgment. As for us, the same friends, be honest. The Bible commands it. Love one another. Be honest with one another. Be careful. Don't take anything lightly. Even if it's a if it's a Tik Tok post or or it's a YouTube video, take it seriously because it says here, lest you fall into judgment. These are perilous times. As the Bible said, we should use caution in everything we do. Don't let a negative word about anyone anyone come out of your mouth. Be positive. It doesn't mean don't stand up against something that's wrong, but it does mean don't propagate anything that's questionable and don't call anyone names and insult anyone. Jesus said a few verses before, he said, "Call no man Raqqa." It's calling a man a name. Calling him worthless. Should never do that, friends. As I said, serious times. Amen. I hope you feel good. [applause] I'll tell you what, if you really read Jesus's preaching, like I talked about the rubble out there, he reduces us to a pile of rubble, &gt;&gt; but then he rebuilds it. And boy, that rebuilding feels good, man. It feels good. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; It feels so just He's good. He is good. He loves us. And I'm thankful that he gives us correction because we need it. I need it. You need it. &gt;&gt; And if we think that we don't need correction, then we really need correction. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Our Father, we thank you. We thank you, Lord, that this sermon was recorded, that we might read it. And Lord, it's hard, Father, it's hard to even move past one verse, just one sentence Jesus said. It's hard to just move past them because it's there's so much wisdom in everything that he said. Oh God, we thank you. Thank you for the correction that this word brings. And Lord, I want to do better. I want my yay to be yay and my nay to be nay. I want people to look at me and say that every word that that man says is true. Every word I want them to look at our congregation. Every word that that woman says is the truth. She never has to swear. He never has to swear. He never has to put his name his hand on the Bible. His words are true. And Lord, your words are true. &gt;&gt; And as you said, I am the truth. Oh God, we thank you for the truth. Now Lord, as we go, pray that your hand would be upon us. Lord, may we be strong in your spirit, living your word and Lord, getting better every day. Forgive us of our sins. Forgive us of our failures. And Lord, we claim the blood of Jesus Christ over our sins. And we are grateful and we are a happy people that you've given us what you've given us in Jesus name. Amen. Have one more village. I pledge allegiance to the lamb. These Christians had one question. Renounce Jesus Christ and live or don't renounce him and die. Will you renounce him? Yes or no? And they said, "No, I will not." And they gave their lives. How many people today, this very morning, if someone tells you, "Renounce the Lord Jesus and walk away from this thing called Christianity [music] and you'll live and you'll prosper." How many people would want to do that versus how many people would say, "You know what? I'll take my way with the Lord's despised few." How many people will take their way with Jesus Christ today? &gt;&gt; Today, it's not dying for him. That's easier, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Today, it's living &gt;&gt; for him. So, will you play? Would you pledge allegiance to the lamb this morning? Pledge allegiance. Give him your life. [applause] Give the lamb your life. Say, "Lord, I pledge allegiance to you. I will walk in your spirit. I will be your servant. Lord, I give my life to you." Will you pledge allegiance to the lamb this morning, Brother? Verse one. I have heard how Christians [singing] long ago were brought before a trend [singing and music] stone. They were told that he would spare [singing] their lives if they would reounce [singing] the name of [music] Christ. But one by [singing] one they chose to die. the son of God. They [singing] would not deny. Like a great angelic choir sings, [music] I can almost [singing] hear their voicees ring. [music] &gt;&gt; Now sing it to him. I pledge alance to the lamb. With all [music and singing] my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge alce [singing] [music] to the land. &gt;&gt; Now the years Now the years have [singing] come and the [music] years have gone, but the cause of Jesus still goes on. Now our time has come to count the cost, to reject this world or embrace the cross. [music] And one by one, let us live our lives for the one [singing] who died to give us life. [singing] Till the trumpet sounds on that final day. [music] Oh, let us humbly stand [singing] and boldly say [music] it. &gt;&gt; I pledge [singing] alance [music] to the lamb. With all [singing] my strength, [music] with all I am, [singing] I will seek to honor his [singing and music] command. I pledge alce [singing] to the lamb to the lamb of God. To the [singing] lamb of God who bore my pain, [music and singing] who took my place, who wore my shame. [singing] I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge [music] alce to the lamb. Just our voices now on the chorus. I pledge alce to the lamb. With all [singing] my strength, with all [chant] I am, I will seek to honor his commands. I pledge [singing] alce to the one more time all our voices I pledge alce to the lamb with all [singing] my strength with all I am [singing] I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alce [singing] to the lamb. &gt;&gt; Boy, that felt good. Oh Lord, thank you. Oh boy, I want to do that every day. Lord, I pledge allegiance to you. I give my life to you. Tonight, we'll have um we will I'll probably answer a couple questions. One of the questions that uh has come in fairly often is about tithe, tithing, and offerings. I will um give a shorter answer on that and maybe a couple other ones. And uh if the Lord's willing, we'll have a shorter service tonight, maybe a little longer worship service and a little longer time for prayer. So, hope to see you tonight 5:00. Brothers and sisters, I love you very much. Jesus wanted a church that people would walk into and that they would give their hearts to him. Not necessarily because of their love for the Lord, but Jesus said because of their love for each other. And that's how that Jesus prayed John chapter 17 that people would accept him as the Messiah because they see a church that loves each other so much. Friends, I think we have it. I want to continue. Love one another. Pray for one another. Help one another. God bless you. You're dismissed. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Glory. [singing] Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, hallelujah. His truth is marching on. Oh, glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, [singing] hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] His truth [music] is [singing] marching on. Mine eyes, mine eyes have seen [music] the glory of the coming of the Lord. He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are storm. He has loosed the faithful lightning [music] of his terrible [singing] swift sword. His truth is marching [music] on. Glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. His [singing] truth is marching [music] on in the beauty of the liies. In the beauty of the liies, Christ was born across [music] the sea with the glory [singing] in his bosom that transfigures you and [music] me. As he died to make men holy, let us live [singing] to make [music] men free. While God is marching on. [singing] Glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] His truth is marching on. Glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] Glory, glory, hallelujah. Oh, glory, glory, hallelujah. [singing] Oh, yeah. His truth is [singing] marching. One more time. Glory, [music] hallelujah. Oh glory, [singing] glory, hallelujah. Oh glory, [singing] glory, hallelujah. Glory, [music] glory, hallelujah. His truth is marching [singing] on. His truth is marching on. [singing] His truth is marching [singing] on. His truth [music] is marching on. Give the glory.
