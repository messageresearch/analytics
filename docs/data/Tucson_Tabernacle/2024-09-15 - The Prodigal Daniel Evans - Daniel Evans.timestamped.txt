[37:33] through to get here to church so many
[37:36] people have so many more means that you
[37:39] than you
[37:40] do and um they can't get out of bed or
[37:44] they they have something better to do
[37:46] but you put it as a priority Sister Mary
[37:48] and thank you and God bless you may the
[37:50] Lord return the blessings of the efforts
[37:53] that you make and Elizabeth that Sharon
[37:56] that all of you all make to get here
[38:00] there's people that should be here this
[38:01] morning that aren't
[38:02] here and
[38:04] um it's sad it's sad that there's more
[38:08] important things than coming to church I
[38:11] I heard uh um I think his brother Jordan
[38:15] mentioned John and an it's good to have
[38:16] you both back man what about a
[38:19] sickness yeah
[38:24] welcome you still kept the project
[38:26] moving though
[38:28] thank you my friend
[38:31] um this evening uh I don't have anything
[38:35] on the calendar but uh I would like to
[38:37] continue on with the sermon that I'm
[38:39] going to preach this morning this
[38:41] evening and I like for the the evening
[38:44] the Sunday evening services to be a
[38:45] little bit light more
[38:47] light-hearted um so uh and and I like to
[38:50] share testimonies on the Sunday evening
[38:53] service I think it's an encouragement to
[38:54] all of us so what I will be doing I'll
[38:56] mention this
[38:58] as I get into my sermon today but what
[38:59] I'll be doing tonight is um I'd like to
[39:03] have often we had brother Ed the other
[39:06] day come in and and give a personal
[39:08] testimony there's someone that's not
[39:09] here with us today but very much
[39:12] considers himself part of of our
[39:14] congregation um brother Adam Gonzalez
[39:17] sister Emilia's son and uh this this
[39:20] evening I'm going to read his testimony
[39:23] that he sent uh he sent me in in letter
[39:26] form
[39:28] so we can look forward to that I believe
[39:29] it'll be a
[39:31] blessing um Jacob I I heard your prayer
[39:35] request too God bless you young man he
[39:39] uh makes a way to get to church he um
[39:44] you just started coming here and you've
[39:45] been a real blessing to us and actually
[39:47] you're one of The Inspirations for my
[39:49] sermon this morning you you came with a
[39:52] with a t-shirt last week and it said the
[39:55] prodigal
[39:57] across it and I told him I was like yeah
[39:59] yeah we haven't seen you in a while it's
[40:00] good to have you back and that that
[40:02] shirt is is really fitting and uh felt
[40:05] it on my heart and I received this
[40:07] letter from
[40:09] Adam and uh and then seeing Jacob's um
[40:13] shirt I really I felt that it was the
[40:15] Lord leading and then many other other
[40:17] things and even a prayer request today
[40:20] from um that uh sister Martha put in uh
[40:23] about this young man in Florida even
[40:26] that I think the everything is lined up
[40:29] to where I believe it's the Lord's will
[40:31] that I preach on this prodigal son that
[40:35] uh we're all probably familiar with the
[40:37] story but I hope that the Lord will open
[40:40] it up to be able to apply it to our
[40:44] really to our own lives and I think all
[40:46] of
[40:47] us can see
[40:49] ourselves in uh in these Parables that
[40:53] I'm going to be talking about this
[40:54] morning or we should see ourselves we
[40:56] should see ourselves and we should also
[40:58] see others our loved ones all of us can
[41:01] take these scriptures and I'm going to
[41:03] read three different Parables this
[41:06] morning and I think that all of us can
[41:09] relate to these three in some way in
[41:13] some
[41:15] fashion um what uh what this Luke
[41:21] chapter 15 is is as I said it's it's
[41:25] story of three different par Parables
[41:27] now do you remember what a parable was a
[41:29] parable didn't necessarily happen a
[41:31] parable is a lesson that the Lord Jesus
[41:34] gives us to be applied to our lives and
[41:37] it can be applied in many many different
[41:39] ways that's what's so beautiful about
[41:42] the parable sister marily I didn't
[41:44] recognize you it's good to have you back
[41:46] to from being sick I'm sorry I just
[41:48] noticed you out there but these um these
[41:51] parables are meant to be applied to our
[41:53] lives and they can be applied in
[41:55] different ways and what does Luke
[41:57] chapter 15 is is is we see this this
[42:00] first Parable and it's a famous Parable
[42:03] that most of us are familiar with is
[42:05] this lost sheep and the shepherd goes
[42:08] and he finds this lost sheep and there's
[42:10] a famous painting where the shepherd
[42:13] puts the Sheep over his shoulders this
[42:16] lamb and he carries it back to the fold
[42:20] beautiful story and then there's a
[42:23] another story that's not as well known
[42:26] and I think it's not very well
[42:27] understood and it but it comes right
[42:30] after this Wayward sheep is with this
[42:34] woman and she loses a
[42:38] coin and she's
[42:40] distraught and she eventually finds the
[42:43] coin and then the third Parable is about
[42:47] this prodigal son that takes the money
[42:52] that that his his inheritance is and
[42:54] then he squanders it and he finds
[42:57] himself absolutely destitute and you'll
[43:00] see that all three go along perfectly
[43:02] with each other so let's get
[43:05] started Let's uh
[43:07] turn to the Book of Luke and we'll start
[43:12] with chapter 15 and we'll start with
[43:15] verse one and we will go through the
[43:16] whole chapter of the Lord's
[43:25] willing then Drew near unto him speaking
[43:27] of the Lord Jesus then Drew near unto
[43:30] him all the publicans and sinners for to
[43:32] hear him so last week I talked about the
[43:35] Rich Young Ruler in a parable that's in
[43:37] a couple chapters later and and this
[43:40] week we're going to move back as I said
[43:42] a couple chapters and we have to
[43:45] remember who the audience is who Jesus
[43:48] is speaking to and it tells us who the
[43:50] audience is here in the first verse then
[43:54] Drew near to him publican and sinners
[43:58] remember what a Publican is it's a tax
[44:01] collector it's not a good person someone
[44:04] that cheated their own people for for
[44:08] gain and for money very thought of very
[44:11] lowly and then it says and
[44:14] sinners so this this audience is made up
[44:18] of all kinds of different people from as
[44:21] I said Tax Collectors to prostitutes to
[44:25] drunkards to all these things and it's
[44:29] really it's really made up of the common
[44:31] people and these common people we know
[44:34] that the Bible says that the Common
[44:36] People heard Jesus gladly but it was the
[44:39] Pharisees and the Sadducees and the
[44:41] rodians that really had problems with
[44:43] what he said but it was the common
[44:46] people what the Pharisees would have
[44:48] called the
[44:50] Sinners these are the people that just
[44:53] loved Jesus's Ministry they're the ones
[44:56] that came came and In This Crowd maybe
[45:00] it was a crowd of 150 people or so like
[45:03] here maybe this In This Crowd were
[45:07] worried
[45:09] parents worried about their
[45:12] children maybe there was there were
[45:14] young people that were there that were
[45:16] worried about their own testimony and
[45:18] how they had sinned and they had made
[45:21] mistakes many a a big crosssection of
[45:24] people maybe people that were
[45:27] questioning their own
[45:28] religion why is it even
[45:31] important there was a a big
[45:33] cross-section of people and they came
[45:35] and they were the ones that were
[45:36] listening to this
[45:39] teacher in the next verse and the
[45:43] Pharisees and the scribes murmured
[45:46] saying this man receives Sinners and
[45:49] eateth with
[45:50] them so they're immediately they're
[45:53] showing the dis the disrespect of this
[45:55] man Jesus just because of the crowd that
[45:59] was around him they were judging his
[46:03] message on the people that were
[46:05] listening to his
[46:07] message so they were they were all there
[46:10] and they were let me stop for a moment
[46:13] and talk about those Pharisees those
[46:14] Pharisees had children those Pharisees
[46:17] they had people that they were
[46:19] influential on I mentioned last week
[46:23] talking
[46:24] about taking
[46:27] the Lord's work and the Lord and and
[46:31] holding it lightly or making fun of it
[46:34] and it's strange
[46:36] because I
[46:38] said I talked about having a coming to
[46:42] Jesus moment it's something that people
[46:44] talk about a lot and it's like well that
[46:46] means that they got corrected or
[46:47] something and and and I said don't say
[46:50] that kind of stuff don't make fun of the
[46:53] Lord don't make fun of prayer don't make
[46:55] fun of church don't make fun of the
[46:58] Bible don't make fun of the things of
[47:00] God hold them in the highest regard I I
[47:06] was uh I had a contractor out the other
[47:09] day and and uh he was working on um
[47:13] something for me and uh I've been
[47:15] witnessing to him and I I think that
[47:17] they'll probably start coming to church
[47:18] but he said he was talking about
[47:20] something and he says yeah he had a
[47:21] coming to Jesus moment I was like
[47:23] oh I'm not going to say anything he
[47:26] didn't hear my sermon obviously so I was
[47:29] I was I was thinking about that but even
[47:31] he said it it's just so common that we
[47:33] say these type of things and I'm not
[47:35] saying that you're going to go to hell
[47:36] for for saying saying anything like that
[47:39] but you certainly are putting yourself
[47:42] open for it by making fun of God's word
[47:45] so always use caution always teach your
[47:47] children to respect one another to
[47:51] respect the church to respect God's word
[47:55] and teach them God's
[47:57] word and here's Jesus and and he's he's
[48:02] got all these people around him and he's
[48:08] must have looked out on the
[48:11] people and felt the need that they
[48:15] had and so he starts in these Parables
[48:20] as I said they were parents just like we
[48:22] are parents they were young people just
[48:24] like we are young people you are young
[48:26] people
[48:28] I am too compared to some
[48:31] people they were just like us and they
[48:35] had
[48:35] needs and Jesus is speaking to them and
[48:39] he he speaks these stories that
[48:42] literally everyone can relate
[48:46] to and he says and he spake this Parable
[48:50] unto
[48:51] them saying what man of you having a
[48:55] hundred sheep if he lose one of them
[48:57] does not leave the 9 and9 in the
[49:00] wilderness and go after that which is
[49:03] lost until he find it and when Heath
[49:05] found it he layeth it on his shoulders
[49:09] rejoicing and when he cometh home he
[49:11] calleth together his friends and his
[49:12] neighbors and saith unto them Rejoice
[49:15] with me for I have found my sheep which
[49:17] was
[49:18] lost I say unto you that likewise Joy
[49:22] shall be in heaven over one sinner that
[49:25] repenteth more than over the 90 and9
[49:27] just persons which need no
[49:30] repentance imagine how those Pharisees
[49:32] thought when he said
[49:34] that and this is so common this scenario
[49:38] right here and all of us understand this
[49:41] scenario it's it's when
[49:44] someone
[49:46] leaves and they fall into sin and they
[49:50] get in over their
[49:51] heads and this sheep is out and and you
[49:54] get away from the church or you get away
[49:56] from your family and you get in Among
[49:59] Wolves and all of a sudden you're
[50:01] sinning you're drinking you're partying
[50:04] you're doing drugs you're lying you you
[50:07] you're not working you're doing all
[50:09] these things and you find yourself out
[50:11] in the world
[50:15] afraid and sometimes we need to go get
[50:18] those people they don't want to be out
[50:21] there they have made a mistake and out
[50:24] they go and then they just need a kind
[50:27] word they need somebody to love them
[50:29] they need somebody to reach out a hand
[50:31] of fellowship and say I'll help you
[50:33] young man or young lady or brother or
[50:35] sister I'll help you let me let me do
[50:38] something for you and here's the
[50:39] shepherd and he goes out and he finds
[50:41] this
[50:43] sheep and he he he saves the thing and
[50:46] all of us can be that Shepherd reaching
[50:49] out to someone who may have fallen into
[50:51] sin or may have fallen into hard times
[50:53] and grab that person and lift them back
[50:56] back up and encourage them I was I love
[51:01] Wildlife videos and there's these this
[51:04] big animal up in Alaska called a musk ox
[51:07] you know what they are they they're
[51:09] these big cool looking ox and they they
[51:13] have all this hair and when the
[51:17] wolves or the or the polar bear when he
[51:20] attacks what happens is the herd will
[51:23] make a
[51:25] circle and the business end of the
[51:28] muscock is facing out the horns and
[51:33] Hooves and you don't want to try to get
[51:35] in that Circle if you're a wolf or or
[51:37] whatever you might be and but behind the
[51:40] circle inside the circle are the babies
[51:43] the more
[51:44] vulnerable and they're the ones and
[51:46] they're hiding in there they know don't
[51:48] go out there because they're going to be
[51:50] wolf food so here they form this circle
[51:54] and anything that tries to come in
[51:58] it would be a bad idea for any predator
[52:01] and that's how we are sometimes with our
[52:04] weaker members of the
[52:07] church stick the horns out and the
[52:11] Hooves out and protect those that need
[52:15] help watch over them they may be weak
[52:17] it's
[52:18] okay it's all right if they're not where
[52:20] they should be but there is a if there
[52:22] is a desire for them to be safe like
[52:26] these baby muscs protect them they're
[52:29] going to make mistakes watch over
[52:32] them take just protect and and nurture
[52:37] them Romans chapter
[52:41] 15 says this we who are strong the King
[52:45] James says we who are strong ought to
[52:47] Bear the infirmities of those that are
[52:49] weak the English Standard Version says
[52:52] that we who are strong have an
[52:54] obligation to bear with the fail ings of
[52:56] the weak and not to please
[52:59] ourselves so we should have patience
[53:02] with those that are weak we should bear
[53:05] their their weaknesses the Amplified
[53:06] version says this we who are strong in
[53:10] our convictions and of robust Faith
[53:13] ought to bear with the failings and the
[53:16] frailties and the tender Scruples of the
[53:19] weak we ought to help carry the
[53:23] doubts and qualms of others others and
[53:27] not to please
[53:30] ourselves we ought to help carry the
[53:32] doubts and the qualms I didn't really
[53:35] understand what the word qualm meant the
[53:37] dictionary says it's an uneasy feeling
[53:40] of Doubt or fear especially about one's
[53:44] own
[53:46] conduct so we should be carrying those
[53:49] people supporting those people so many
[53:51] people will come to
[53:53] service and they'll see maybe people
[53:55] that don't look like them or or or or
[53:57] they might be insecure about themselves
[53:59] and what they'll do is they'll come to
[54:00] service and then they'll leave and say
[54:02] those people judged
[54:04] me those people are just they look at me
[54:06] and they're judging me and and and I I
[54:09] don't want to be around them they think
[54:10] less of me and when really that's not
[54:13] happening what's happening is they're
[54:14] coming in they're feeling self-conscious
[54:16] about themselves and they
[54:19] leave and they're in their mind it's
[54:22] thinking these people are are down on me
[54:24] they're putting me down they think less
[54:26] of me when that's not even really
[54:28] happening and what this scripture is
[54:29] saying is that person that's feeling
[54:32] like they're being judged we need to go
[54:34] to that person make an extra effort for
[54:37] that person and lift that person up and
[54:39] show that person
[54:41] love is what Romans chapter 15 is
[54:46] saying if they're feeling insecure we
[54:50] who are strong should carry those
[54:54] insecurities we should help
[54:57] them not and not be defensive about our
[55:01] own faith brother and sisters I am very
[55:03] secure with my
[55:05] faith I don't have to worry about the
[55:08] way I believe I'm not I'm not g to
[55:10] compromise at all on Jesus Christ that's
[55:13] not part that's not part of it I'm am
[55:16] going to stand strong on that but in
[55:18] being so strong the Romans 15:1 is
[55:22] saying that if you are strong in what
[55:24] you believe then go ahead and help those
[55:26] that aren't So Strong Lift them up carry
[55:30] them don't get offended if they don't
[55:32] believe like you or if they put down the
[55:34] the something that you do raise up above
[55:37] that and help carry that person and do
[55:41] it in love that's the greatest thing
[55:44] that you can do and this she this
[55:48] Shepherd he's not worried about himself
[55:52] when he goes and gets the Sheep he
[55:54] wasn't wor he's what he's worried about
[55:56] is is worried about the the wolves
[55:58] attacking that Wayward sheep because
[56:00] it's
[56:01] alone so the shepherd goes out and he's
[56:03] willing to fight off these wolves he was
[56:05] willing to do whatever and then he gets
[56:07] this
[56:09] this baby sheep let's say it is let's
[56:12] say it's a lamb and he brings it back to
[56:16] the fold and there is rejoicing in the
[56:19] camp calls his friends up and says hey
[56:23] so and so came came back to the Lord
[56:25] Jesus
[56:27] and then we Rejoice together and then
[56:29] maybe the person gives a testimony in
[56:31] church and everything is just so happy
[56:34] and just just absolutely precious like
[56:36] like I gave the testimony of that young
[56:38] man I believe his name was Jacob from
[56:39] Ikea last week and it was just blessed
[56:42] me so much that this young man came to
[56:44] the Lord I was rejoicing with
[56:47] him praise God that he came to came to
[56:50] the
[56:51] Lord and then the 99 other sheep
[56:57] they're praising the Lord also they're
[57:00] saying thank God this is this is just
[57:02] wonderful that so and so came back to
[57:04] the
[57:07] Lord and then now in the second
[57:12] scenario we're going to
[57:14] see a parable that goes in perfect line
[57:17] with it but it seems so
[57:21] different and but the story is
[57:24] absolutely perfect like in everything
[57:26] that Jesus
[57:28] did he says this either what Woman verse
[57:32] number eight in uh Luke
[57:36] 15 either what woman having 10 pieces of
[57:39] silver and she lose one
[57:42] piece does not light a candle and sweep
[57:46] the house and seek diligently until she
[57:48] finds it and when she had found it she
[57:51] calls her friends and her neighbors
[57:52] together saying Rejoice with me for I
[57:55] have found the piece which I have
[57:58] lost so she's really she's really happy
[58:01] that that this coin which was probably a
[58:06] sign of either engagement or
[58:08] marriage and the women back then
[58:12] probably wore it either in a headdress
[58:14] around their head or they may have worn
[58:16] it in a necklace and they had these
[58:18] coins in there and they were very
[58:20] valuable so if you lose one it's like
[58:22] losing your diamond in your wedding ring
[58:25] it's devastating
[58:27] so what does she do she goes to the
[58:29] house and she starts digging around in
[58:33] the couch and and she starts looking and
[58:36] and she starts sweeping up and then you
[58:38] know she pulls the cushion up in the
[58:40] couch have you ever done
[58:41] that how in the world does so much stuff
[58:44] get in
[58:46] there I mean I would do I'd lose my
[58:49] wallet or something and I'd be digging
[58:50] in the couch it's like Cheerios
[58:56] we I don't remember ever even buying
[58:59] Cheerios and then popcorn it's always
[59:02] there's always popcorn in there there's
[59:04] popcorn in there it's like where in the
[59:06] world did this stuff come and you look
[59:07] in there it's like oh I just made
[59:09] a150 and and in coins and stuff you're
[59:13] smiling because it happens to you and
[59:15] you're going through and you're cleaning
[59:17] and and you're cleaning out those those
[59:19] creases in the couch when you when you
[59:20] lose your wallet or or your ring or
[59:22] whatever it is and you go through and
[59:25] you're you're sweeping the corners of
[59:26] the house and and and you're looking
[59:28] behind the the bed post and behind
[59:30] everything and
[59:33] finally you find
[59:35] it but what happened in the time that
[59:39] you lost it until the time that you
[59:41] found it you cleaned up your
[59:44] life you cleaned up your house on and
[59:48] you went through this thing and that
[59:50] thing remember my son where is he my son
[59:55] the little guy I liked apples and I'd
[59:57] always find these little shrivel up
[59:58] apple
[59:59] cores in between the couch and stuff man
[1:00:04] buddy don't leave that stuff there but
[1:00:06] if I wouldn't have lost my wallet I
[1:00:07] wouldn't have cleaned it
[1:00:09] up and here is this woman she's going
[1:00:11] through and she's cleaning everything
[1:00:13] and fi and then she finally finds the
[1:00:15] diamond or the coin that she lost and
[1:00:17] she's praising the Lord for it and
[1:00:19] that's what happens sometimes when we
[1:00:21] lose a son or when we lose a daughter or
[1:00:24] when we lose a friend or a brother or a
[1:00:27] sister they go out in the world what's
[1:00:29] the first thing that the parents do is
[1:00:31] they start I start looking at
[1:00:33] myself Lord what do I need to clean up
[1:00:35] in my life and then I start seeing these
[1:00:38] things and I start cleaning myself up
[1:00:41] and start making things right and doing
[1:00:43] things better because I got a child
[1:00:45] that's out there and I want to do
[1:00:47] everything that I can to clean this up
[1:00:49] because I want that child to come back
[1:00:51] I'm afraid it might be a lamb Out Among
[1:00:55] Wolves or might be what I'm going to say
[1:00:56] about this prodigal it it may be either
[1:00:59] of the two but Lord I got to clean up my
[1:01:01] life cuz I'm worried about my
[1:01:04] baby she was worried about this coin
[1:01:07] that was her marriage
[1:01:09] vow and she did everything she could to
[1:01:12] clean up that
[1:01:13] house and get everything in order and
[1:01:17] then she finally found it and again she
[1:01:21] rejoices she goes back and she calls her
[1:01:24] friends
[1:01:26] sends out a WhatsApp
[1:01:28] broadcast I found it thank you for
[1:01:32] praying for me praise God and and they
[1:01:35] give God the credit for finding this
[1:01:38] lost
[1:01:40] thing and that's with
[1:01:44] us that we should be looking in every
[1:01:48] crack and every crevice just like this
[1:01:51] woman did when we have someone go out a
[1:01:55] prodigal leave we're worried about our
[1:01:58] family we're worried about our children
[1:01:59] we're worried about whatever clean up
[1:02:01] your life first if fits
[1:02:05] perfect between the first one which is
[1:02:08] that lost sheep and the shepherd going
[1:02:10] and get it the Sheep didn't want to be
[1:02:13] lost this is very important that sheep
[1:02:16] in the first Parable did not want to be
[1:02:20] lost there was a desire in the Sheep to
[1:02:23] come back to the fold it may be fallen
[1:02:26] into sin it may have come upon hard
[1:02:30] times but there was a desire in it to
[1:02:33] come back
[1:02:35] home and then this woman she cleans up
[1:02:38] her life she cleans up her
[1:02:41] house and then Jesus continues on and he
[1:02:45] says likewise I say unto you there is
[1:02:48] joy in the presence of the angels of God
[1:02:50] over one sinner that repenteth so Jesus
[1:02:54] brings it back he's talking about a
[1:02:58] coin this woman finding a coin and then
[1:03:02] he ties it back to someone that comes
[1:03:05] back to God and it's even Beyond us we
[1:03:08] might be praising the Lord but in
[1:03:13] heaven the angels are praising God
[1:03:18] because that soul that was lost is now
[1:03:22] found so our joy and you may think it's
[1:03:25] just limited to just the husband and the
[1:03:28] wife or or the brother or the sister or
[1:03:30] whatever it is you may think that it's
[1:03:31] just limited to that but when that that
[1:03:34] wavered Soul comes back to the Lord
[1:03:37] there is shouting and joy that we can't
[1:03:39] hear in
[1:03:42] heaven and you don't
[1:03:46] hear that type of statement very often
[1:03:49] in the Bible but you hear it here when
[1:03:53] that person comes back likewise I say to
[1:03:55] you there is joy in the presence of the
[1:03:57] angel of God over one sinner that
[1:04:02] repents now the
[1:04:04] third and the most
[1:04:06] famous of all three of these Parables is
[1:04:11] the story of The Prodigal
[1:04:13] Son and that's what I want to
[1:04:15] concentrate today it says this in verse
[1:04:17] number
[1:04:22] 11 and he said certain man had two
[1:04:26] sons and the younger of them said to his
[1:04:28] father father forgi father give me the
[1:04:30] portion of goods that fth to me and he
[1:04:34] divided unto them his
[1:04:36] living and not many days after the
[1:04:38] younger son gathered all together and
[1:04:40] took his journey into a far country and
[1:04:43] there wasted his substance with riotous
[1:04:47] living so the younger of the two
[1:04:50] sons he makes his conscious decision to
[1:04:54] leave
[1:04:55] he wants his inheritance because he
[1:04:57] wants to experience what the world has
[1:04:59] to offer maybe he thinks he's been
[1:05:01] deprived a little bit maybe he thinks
[1:05:04] that well I lived in this type of
[1:05:06] household so I just I want to go
[1:05:07] experience I want to I want to live like
[1:05:10] everybody else lives I don't want to be
[1:05:12] weird like going to church and doing all
[1:05:15] that I don't want to be like that I want
[1:05:16] to be like everybody else is at the
[1:05:19] University or at work or whatever it is
[1:05:23] I want to be like them
[1:05:26] I want an
[1:05:28] experience I want that there's a desire
[1:05:31] in me to do it so this young man he
[1:05:35] makes the conscious decision I'm
[1:05:39] leaving I'm leaving you because I want
[1:05:44] this when I was a kid when I was growing
[1:05:48] up in high school there was this
[1:05:50] saying that
[1:05:53] uh sex drugs and rock and roll
[1:05:57] and I don't know if any of you remember
[1:05:58] that but it was that was like the rally
[1:06:01] cry partying cry way back whenn and that
[1:06:05] was that was the saying and that was
[1:06:08] kind of the the Party
[1:06:10] Anthem and everybody was going out and
[1:06:13] doing that type of thing and what they
[1:06:14] were doing is they were probably leaving
[1:06:16] the truth what they knew what was right
[1:06:18] and making the decision to go out from
[1:06:22] under that protection of the Lord
[1:06:26] and then go to their own
[1:06:29] devices and then be responsible for
[1:06:31] their own lives and when you walk out
[1:06:34] from under that protection of
[1:06:36] God you are on your own and let me tell
[1:06:40] you never in the history of the world
[1:06:42] has it ever worked out well that's right
[1:06:46] and yet most people still make that
[1:06:50] decision most do that
[1:06:55] today it may not be like it was in the
[1:06:58] 80s and '90s sex drugs and rock and roll
[1:07:01] but today it's do what makes you happy
[1:07:05] love yourself don't worry don't worry
[1:07:07] about making a living and providing
[1:07:09] you're entitled to a
[1:07:12] paycheck you're entitled to health care
[1:07:15] you're entitled to all these things
[1:07:18] don't worry about
[1:07:19] it just do what you want to
[1:07:23] do don't worry about getting married
[1:07:26] before having sex just do what do what
[1:07:29] makes you happy and if you get pregnant
[1:07:32] abort it because it's about
[1:07:35] you it's about what makes what it's
[1:07:37] about your life you're the most
[1:07:40] important thing and look at the world
[1:07:42] today if you don't look around and see
[1:07:44] that you see the
[1:07:46] politicians up there saying oh you need
[1:07:49] to protect this right and it's about you
[1:07:51] and it's about a woman's body what about
[1:07:52] the conceived child that's there that's
[1:07:55] right
[1:07:56] am it's
[1:07:58] wrong because it is I want to put myself
[1:08:02] first I don't want to waste a year of my
[1:08:04] life because of this thing that was
[1:08:07] conceived in
[1:08:09] sin I don't want to waste my I I I'll
[1:08:11] take a I take a pill or go to
[1:08:14] the the doctor and have it done or
[1:08:17] whatever it might be this stuff needs to
[1:08:19] be preached more by the
[1:08:23] way our people need to know that this is
[1:08:26] wrong and it is wrong but instead it's
[1:08:30] like you don't want to lose you don't
[1:08:31] want to lose a year of your life live
[1:08:33] your life to the
[1:08:35] fullest as I said do what makes you
[1:08:38] happy and this young man this prodigal
[1:08:41] son that was his attitude he didn't care
[1:08:44] about being responsible he didn't he
[1:08:46] certainly didn't care about serving God
[1:08:48] he wanted to serve
[1:08:50] himself and he
[1:08:53] left and it's a story so you don't hear
[1:08:56] much about his mom and dad but imagine
[1:08:58] how his mom
[1:09:00] felt imagine how it devastated her to
[1:09:04] see her son leave like that say I don't
[1:09:07] want your religion Mom I don't dad I
[1:09:10] don't I don't want your religion all of
[1:09:12] that that these that they tried to teach
[1:09:14] their their child and and tried to raise
[1:09:17] him upright I don't want
[1:09:20] it I don't want your
[1:09:23] religion I want to experience the world
[1:09:26] so he goes
[1:09:28] out and experiences the world as I said
[1:09:34] he was left to his own devices now it
[1:09:36] was his choice and notice and here is
[1:09:40] the point of this
[1:09:41] one notice what the father did when the
[1:09:47] son
[1:09:48] left he let him
[1:09:51] go he wasn't sending him money to help
[1:09:55] him with with his drinking and doing all
[1:09:58] that he
[1:10:00] said leave he didn't go out and try to
[1:10:03] find him like the shepherd went out and
[1:10:07] tried to find the lost lamb that lamb
[1:10:09] was scared he wanted to come home this
[1:10:11] young man doesn't want to come home he
[1:10:14] wants the
[1:10:15] world and it's the hardest thing in the
[1:10:17] world sometimes for a parent to do is
[1:10:20] let them
[1:10:22] go but sometimes we have to
[1:10:26] and don't enable
[1:10:27] them you're not going to give them more
[1:10:30] money so they can go drink more you're
[1:10:32] not going to give them more to to where
[1:10:34] that they're enabled no you leave them
[1:10:37] to their own devices so that God can
[1:10:40] handle
[1:10:41] it
[1:10:43] I I knew some um some friend of
[1:10:47] ours they
[1:10:50] children daughters just desire the
[1:10:54] world and and just just wanted it and
[1:10:57] the parents were so afraid of losing the
[1:11:01] daughter even though she was running
[1:11:04] towards the world the parents were so
[1:11:07] afraid of losing her that what did they
[1:11:10] do they go and they buy her new
[1:11:15] cars and
[1:11:17] feed that desire for the world and
[1:11:21] enable in it a convertible so she can
[1:11:24] cre around in their bikini top and guys
[1:11:27] can look in the top look in the car and
[1:11:29] see her the parents bought it for her
[1:11:32] bad
[1:11:35] move Let It
[1:11:38] Go and sometimes it is the best thing
[1:11:41] that you can do for a child for a young
[1:11:43] person or brother or sisters let them go
[1:11:46] but it's the hardest thing to do because
[1:11:48] you love them so much but trust in God
[1:11:52] let God take care of that person and
[1:11:55] then what's going to happen when
[1:11:58] when you do
[1:12:00] it the same thing that happened to this
[1:12:02] prodigal
[1:12:06] son verse number
[1:12:09] 14 and when he had spent
[1:12:13] all there arose a mighty famine in the
[1:12:17] land and he began to be in
[1:12:20] want he had
[1:12:22] needs the money had run out
[1:12:26] Life starts getting tough and there was
[1:12:30] so strange how there's a lot of times
[1:12:32] there's no God in our lives until times
[1:12:35] get hard and that'll go that that'll
[1:12:38] make us go to our knees and that's what
[1:12:40] God he loved this young man I believe
[1:12:42] and God let the young man make the wrong
[1:12:47] decisions until he was so weak and until
[1:12:51] he was s in such a bad place he had no
[1:12:54] one else to cry out
[1:12:58] to and he went and he joined himself to
[1:13:01] a citizen of that
[1:13:02] country and he sent him into his fields
[1:13:05] to feed the
[1:13:07] swine so he went to work for this guy
[1:13:10] and the guy said well yeah you can you
[1:13:12] can feed my
[1:13:13] pigs and he would have Fain filled his
[1:13:16] belly with the husks that the swine did
[1:13:18] eat and no man gave unto him he
[1:13:22] desired to eat the food
[1:13:25] that the pigs were eating he was so
[1:13:28] hungry that was his desire in his heart
[1:13:31] that if I could just get this job
[1:13:33] feeding these pigs and I can start
[1:13:35] eating what the pigs eat and I'll be
[1:13:38] able to survive look how low
[1:13:40] now this young man had
[1:13:45] become but it was all by the grace of
[1:13:47] God that he became that low God knows he
[1:13:50] knows the beginning from the end and God
[1:13:52] knows what's the most important thing is
[1:13:55] that people come to
[1:13:56] him and God will allow us to fall and
[1:13:59] fail and get as low as we can because he
[1:14:03] knows the most important thing is what's
[1:14:05] beyond the river he knows the most
[1:14:07] important thing is that eternal life and
[1:14:09] it's the most important thing for our
[1:14:11] children and sometimes we have to pull
[1:14:14] back as this father did and this
[1:14:20] mother and then this young man comes to
[1:14:22] himself I'm going to insert right here I
[1:14:27] um as I said I asked sister Amelia's son
[1:14:31] to uh to write down his testimony and
[1:14:33] I'm going to share a little bit with
[1:14:36] with the congregation this morning and
[1:14:37] then we'll get into it deeper tonight he
[1:14:40] says
[1:14:41] this he says 19 years
[1:14:45] old I would find myself in a hospital
[1:14:47] with a gunshot wound to my
[1:14:50] stomach I almost
[1:14:52] died then shortly after facing prison
[1:14:54] time time looking at three and a half
[1:14:57] years in
[1:14:58] prison then once in prison I would make
[1:15:00] more bad choices that would Place me in
[1:15:03] super max
[1:15:04] lockdown now here I am with no Escape
[1:15:09] God had me one-on-one calling to
[1:15:12] me all the while he was calling I just
[1:15:15] wasn't listening as this prodigal son
[1:15:18] was not
[1:15:19] listening but this was a sitdown and I
[1:15:22] think what he meant by sit down was he's
[1:15:24] saying I had no were to go and God sat
[1:15:26] me down as we would sit down sit our
[1:15:29] kids down and he gave me a talking
[1:15:32] to so I would call out and pray and
[1:15:35] begin to pick up my Bible I started to
[1:15:38] come back only not the way of obedience
[1:15:41] we all have a way and he quotes the
[1:15:44] scripture there is a way that seems
[1:15:45] right to a man in which we are going to
[1:15:48] respond but he has a provided way not
[1:15:52] our way when I got out of prison I would
[1:15:56] only Venture back to Old
[1:16:01] patterns for time sake again I'll skip
[1:16:03] down I'm just going to read some
[1:16:05] portions of it now out of prison in my
[1:16:08] early 30s I turn back to the life of
[1:16:11] sin almost like I graduated in sin and
[1:16:14] now I'm proving faithful to serve its
[1:16:17] desires but the line of serving sin's
[1:16:22] desires so with the risk comes
[1:16:26] reward and now I'm willing to risk more
[1:16:30] for a better life of
[1:16:32] luxury so for the next five five
[1:16:36] years to another
[1:16:38] seven went hard into this life almost
[1:16:41] like a man running from the presence of
[1:16:43] the Lord I drowned out the calling with
[1:16:46] the things the calling of God with the
[1:16:47] things of the world till one day yet
[1:16:50] again for a third time I was looking at
[1:16:52] going back to prison this time it would
[1:16:55] be for a very long
[1:16:57] time but God would make provisions and
[1:17:00] shine his grace upon
[1:17:02] me to give me another opportunity to
[1:17:04] heed his calling and I can tell you that
[1:17:06] all the in between situations and
[1:17:09] looking back at how God's hand was upon
[1:17:11] me during These Foolish times in my
[1:17:16] life he says this he says don't be don't
[1:17:19] be
[1:17:20] mistaken he
[1:17:23] says God
[1:17:25] I'm saying this not to bless
[1:17:28] me but to Save Me From
[1:17:32] Myself sin and Satan Save Me From Myself
[1:17:37] sin and Satan puts them all three
[1:17:40] together so the goal in this is this I
[1:17:43] say he says this he said finally and
[1:17:47] there he is in prison for a very long
[1:17:51] time and he says finally
[1:17:55] I came to my senses and then I made a
[1:17:58] deliberate choice I realized things were
[1:18:02] so severe even so even lifethreatening
[1:18:05] that I knew God meant business but I was
[1:18:08] blind see it started in Disobedience
[1:18:11] left me in delusion lies and deception
[1:18:14] it was God who delivered me and spared
[1:18:17] me now sitting in myself I dedicated my
[1:18:20] life to the
[1:18:23] Lord I submitted to full
[1:18:26] obedience so don't think to yourself
[1:18:28] that if God gave me and he says brother
[1:18:32] Adam if God saved me brother Adam I can
[1:18:36] play with fire too some
[1:18:40] leave and never to come
[1:18:43] back they never even look
[1:18:46] back just think of that man who went to
[1:18:49] hell speaking of the Rich Young Ruler
[1:18:51] who by the way we just talked about last
[1:18:53] week just think of that man who went to
[1:18:56] hell if he could have just had one
[1:18:59] chance to go back to his family to tell
[1:19:01] them how real hell was but he had his
[1:19:04] chance see he had had his chance see and
[1:19:08] then what was the
[1:19:09] response he says sin someone and the
[1:19:12] only response he gets where they had the
[1:19:17] prophets you know they had a
[1:19:19] church they had a pastor they had
[1:19:22] Parents they had these things they had
[1:19:27] them if I send you it's not going to do
[1:19:29] any good they've already had it they
[1:19:31] have a
[1:19:33] Bible all they have to do is read
[1:19:39] it brother Adam continues no if I can
[1:19:43] look you in the faith in the face with a
[1:19:46] serious stern look I have this to
[1:19:49] say I was better off never leaving my
[1:19:53] post in that church pew
[1:19:56] just holding my post right there I was
[1:19:58] better off never knowing the things the
[1:20:00] world introduced me to all the while

[1:21:22] meet again we are promised that meeting
[1:21:26] in the sky and I'll be the guy screaming
[1:21:29] and hollering
[1:21:32] finally trust me
[1:21:34] friend I wish I never knew or have
[1:21:38] tasted I was better off never having
[1:21:41] known never having experienced or
[1:21:43] learned once you do something you can't
[1:21:45] undo
[1:21:47] it and that is exactly what this
[1:21:50] prodigal son does in Luke 15
[1:21:55] 15 let's go back to Luke 15 go back to
[1:21:58] verse
[1:22:00] 17 and when he came to
[1:22:03] himself how many hired Servants of my
[1:22:05] fathers have bread enough to
[1:22:09] spare and I perish with Hunger I will
[1:22:12] arise and go to my father and I will say
[1:22:14] unto him father I have
[1:22:17] sinned against
[1:22:19] Heaven I've sinned against God before
[1:22:22] you father
[1:22:25] and I've sinned against you and he's
[1:22:27] going over this in his
[1:22:28] mind and I am no more worthy to be
[1:22:31] called your son make me as one of thy
[1:22:33] hired servants so he's got all this
[1:22:35] stuff in his mind and he's saying okay
[1:22:38] I'm GNA come to my dad and I'm going to
[1:22:40] get there and I'm going to tell him
[1:22:41] daddy I'm sorry I messed up I shouldn't
[1:22:44] have done it but I just want to be a
[1:22:46] normal person now I just want to have a
[1:22:48] job I just want to work for you I don't
[1:22:50] have to be your son just make me like
[1:22:52] one of your servants I'd much rather be
[1:22:53] that than where I am right now I've
[1:22:55] ruined my life dad and he's thinking
[1:22:58] about all of these things here's the way
[1:23:00] I'm going to talk to my dad when when
[1:23:02] when I get there and here's the things
[1:23:04] and he starts on this
[1:23:06] journey back
[1:23:08] home he's walking and he's going over
[1:23:12] this in his
[1:23:16] mind Rose
[1:23:19] and came to his
[1:23:22] father and there's his dad
[1:23:25] remember what I had said the first two
[1:23:27] Parables how much they
[1:23:29] rejoice when a sinner repents how much
[1:23:33] that woman rejoiced when she found her
[1:23:34] coin how much that that Shepherd
[1:23:36] rejoiced when he found this lost lamb
[1:23:39] remember
[1:23:42] that and even when he was a great way
[1:23:44] off his dad was out there maybe in the
[1:23:47] front yard and he looked and he sees out
[1:23:50] there
[1:23:52] wow that man's walking like like my
[1:23:56] son gets a little closer put yourself in
[1:23:59] the dad's spot in the mom's
[1:24:02] Spot a little bit closer that is my son
[1:24:07] that's my boy that's my daughter that's
[1:24:11] my brother that's my sister wow they're
[1:24:13] coming down this aisle in
[1:24:16] church they're coming back
[1:24:19] home and how much it meant to that Dad
[1:24:21] and that Dad he runs out
[1:24:24] his father saw him and he had compassion
[1:24:26] and he ran and he fell on his neck and
[1:24:28] he kissed him and the son said to him
[1:24:30] father now remember he's going to recite
[1:24:32] what he had he had been thinking about
[1:24:34] this whole journey home and he doesn't
[1:24:36] get much of it
[1:24:39] out and the son said to him father I
[1:24:41] have sinned against heaven and in thy
[1:24:44] sight and am no more worthy to be called
[1:24:46] thy
[1:24:50] son
[1:24:52] dad but the father said to his servants
[1:24:55] hold on son just a
[1:24:57] minute bring forth the best robe and put
[1:25:00] it on him and put a ring on his hand and
[1:25:02] shoes on his feet and bring hither the
[1:25:05] fatted calf and kill it and let us eat
[1:25:07] and be merry for this my son was
[1:25:11] dead and he is alive again that Dad
[1:25:14] loved him it doesn't matter what he
[1:25:16] did the the boy left the dad backed off
[1:25:21] and let Satan have that child but but
[1:25:24] trusting that God was with him and that
[1:25:27] God would protect him and bring him
[1:25:32] back bring the fatted calf and kill it
[1:25:34] and let us eat and be merry for my son
[1:25:36] was dead and is alive again he was lost
[1:25:39] and is found Amazing Grace How Sweet the
[1:25:45] Sound and they began to be
[1:25:48] merry and we we learn about his Elder
[1:25:51] son and his Elder son was upset he's
[1:25:53] like Dad come on
[1:25:55] he's been gone and I've been with you
[1:25:57] the whole time remember what Adam said
[1:26:00] in the
[1:26:01] letter he's like Dad I've been with you
[1:26:03] the whole time and you're going to bring
[1:26:05] a fatted calf and you're going to have a
[1:26:06] big party you never had a party for me
[1:26:08] dad dad's like listen
[1:26:11] son you're not carrying the baggage that
[1:26:13] he's carrying you've been with me the
[1:26:15] whole
[1:26:17] time you're not fighting the battles
[1:26:19] that he's fighting that's right you're
[1:26:21] not going to suffer like he has suffered
[1:26:25] because you have lived right son
[1:26:27] everything I have is
[1:26:29] yours it's all
[1:26:32] right he's got it hard
[1:26:34] now so let's have this party let's honor
[1:26:38] my
[1:26:39] son coming
[1:26:42] home and that's what happens in this
[1:26:45] Parable it's
[1:26:47] beautiful our lord Jesus have have time
[1:26:52] to tell a little bit more light-hearted
[1:26:54] story so we can end on a little bit I
[1:26:57] know that's heavy it's a heavy Parable
[1:26:58] it's a heavy and all of us you don't
[1:27:01] have to raise your
[1:27:02] hand but think how many of us can relate
[1:27:07] to our Lord Jesus's Parables here it
[1:27:10] might be us might be me might be a child
[1:27:14] might be a brother or sister or a loved
[1:27:16] one we can all relate to these things
[1:27:19] right here and it might not be that that
[1:27:21] this man's that this this prodigal son's
[1:27:24] drunk on the street he may have just
[1:27:26] left the religion I don't want
[1:27:28] it I want to live my life man I want to
[1:27:31] be
[1:27:31] happy I don't be torn
[1:27:36] down which is the same as this prodigal
[1:27:38] son let him
[1:27:40] go don't enable them don't shun
[1:27:44] them always be there for them when they
[1:27:47] want to come back as this dad was was
[1:27:50] and how happy he
[1:27:52] was but you don't have to help them
[1:27:57] sin I told this
[1:28:00] story Daniel uh reminded me I said buddy
[1:28:03] did I I know I told it once did I tell
[1:28:05] this story about
[1:28:07] um this uh this guy from South
[1:28:11] Africa and uh Daniel told me he's like
[1:28:13] Dad I think you told it right before
[1:28:14] Camp last year it's like you know what
[1:28:16] it's a good time to tell it again if you
[1:28:19] haven't heard it it's a great story one
[1:28:21] of my favorite stories
[1:28:25] so
[1:28:27] um uh Keith Hearn who is uh he's one of
[1:28:31] the most precious people I've ever met
[1:28:33] and and this man has a calling in his
[1:28:35] life to lead people to Jesus Christ he
[1:28:38] lives in South
[1:28:39] Africa and uh he's not a pastor he's
[1:28:44] very much a minister but he's not like
[1:28:46] in the traditional Evangelistic scene
[1:28:48] he's not somebody that stands in the
[1:28:50] Pulpit very often and preaches but he is
[1:28:52] always preaching and he's always out on
[1:28:55] the street and he's always witnessing
[1:28:56] and the reason he is so successful let
[1:28:58] me tell you something about Keith the
[1:29:00] reason he is so successful is because he
[1:29:02] has
[1:29:03] love and whoever he is witnessing to
[1:29:05] they can tell he
[1:29:06] cares and he has led of anyone I have
[1:29:10] ever met I believe Keith has led more
[1:29:12] people to the Lord than anyone else that
[1:29:15] I've ever met and he told me this story
[1:29:18] he called and he says uh this is a
[1:29:20] couple few years ago he says he says uh
[1:29:22] he goes he goes brother Dan he says
[1:29:25] pray with me for this man that I just
[1:29:29] met and he so what happened was this man
[1:29:32] came into the
[1:29:33] office and uh he was really he was
[1:29:36] tattered and and beaten down and really
[1:29:39] just not in a good place in his life he
[1:29:41] was a Muslim man really he was just
[1:29:43] destitute and Keith as Keith is one of
[1:29:46] the kindest people he ever meet he
[1:29:48] brings him into the office and he feeds
[1:29:50] him he gets him cleaned up and he starts
[1:29:53] wh witnessing to this Muslim man about
[1:29:57] the Bible and about the Lord
[1:30:00] Jesus and the man really um he really
[1:30:04] took to
[1:30:05] it so Keith gives him a
[1:30:11] Bible small little Bible and he gives it
[1:30:14] he says here here read this so the man's
[1:30:16] cleaned up and he
[1:30:18] leaves a little while
[1:30:21] later he comes back to the office office
[1:30:25] couple weeks later I think it was maybe
[1:30:27] maybe a week later and he had just
[1:30:29] gotten out of the hospital and he was
[1:30:31] beaten and bruised and bloody and
[1:30:33] bandaged up and almost died and what had
[1:30:37] happened was he had read this Bible he
[1:30:40] had accepted this Jesus Christ came home
[1:30:43] told his family and his dad beat him
[1:30:46] almost to
[1:30:48] death he was able to get somehow to a
[1:30:52] hospital with they patched him up and he
[1:30:55] comes back to
[1:30:58] Keith Keith helps him out gives him
[1:31:01] gives him some help in and Keith cared
[1:31:04] for his wounds and um he
[1:31:07] asked um what Keith what his name is
[1:31:12] Imam imram imram what he was looking at
[1:31:16] in the Bible and imram said well I was I
[1:31:18] was curious about about the Lord Jesus
[1:31:20] Muslims teach that he was a prophet but
[1:31:22] not the Son of God and
[1:31:24] Keith gives him more of an understanding
[1:31:27] of this Jesus Christ so this this imram
[1:31:31] he's he's excited and he's learning
[1:31:32] about this and and it's just something
[1:31:34] something that's just blessing him so he
[1:31:37] takes his Bible and he
[1:31:41] leaves and doesn't call back he's
[1:31:44] gone months pass Keith say hey uh pray
[1:31:48] keep praying for that guy haven't seen
[1:31:50] him in a long time and a lot of times we
[1:31:51] witness to someone and and um then they
[1:31:55] just leave and we never hear back from
[1:31:57] them
[1:31:58] again and it's okay you did your part so
[1:32:01] he's out so one day this imram comes
[1:32:06] back I think it was a year later he
[1:32:10] comes back to the office and he looks
[1:32:12] good he's well dressed clean
[1:32:16] cut Keith almost didn't recognize him
[1:32:19] and he says he says wow he says he says
[1:32:22] look at You' and actually it was a few
[1:32:26] years I didn't know that if I have in my
[1:32:29] notes here it was a few
[1:32:31] years and Keith calls me he says you're
[1:32:33] not going to believe this imram has
[1:32:37] returned and he said so he says what had
[1:32:41] happened was is he read this Bible and
[1:32:44] he as as always all of us when we give
[1:32:46] our hearts to the Lord Jesus when we
[1:32:48] truly accept Jesus Christ then we want
[1:32:50] to tell others about it and we want to
[1:32:52] lead others to Christ and we others to
[1:32:54] have the same the the same joy that we
[1:32:56] have and that's why you don't see in the
[1:32:58] Bible brothers and sisters in the Old
[1:33:00] Testament you don't see evangelism
[1:33:02] because there was no
[1:33:04] Jesus you don't see conversions you
[1:33:06] don't see out people witnessing and
[1:33:07] doing all that that starts in the New
[1:33:10] Testament that starts when Jesus is here
[1:33:12] and now we have that Joy of our
[1:33:16] salvation and we want others to know
[1:33:18] about this so imram he has this joy and
[1:33:21] he felt a call to go to the prisons
[1:33:25] so he goes into the prisons and he
[1:33:27] starts witnessing and he gets these
[1:33:28] Gideon Bibles you know the little the
[1:33:30] little green Bibles he gets these Bibles
[1:33:33] and he's taking them to the um to the
[1:33:37] prisoners preaching in different places
[1:33:39] trying to introduce him to the
[1:33:41] Lord and
[1:33:43] uh he gives a Bible this man comes up
[1:33:47] kind of a belligerent man rude and says
[1:33:51] hey give me one of those Bibles
[1:33:55] and imram says why do you want
[1:33:58] it and the guy says he says really he
[1:34:01] says that that
[1:34:03] paper he says it's good for Rolling
[1:34:07] smokes he says uh that's what I want it
[1:34:11] for so what does imram do what would you
[1:34:15] do probably do the same thing I did I
[1:34:17] would do imram says okay remember it's a
[1:34:21] new testament Gideon Bible there's not
[1:34:23] the Old Testament they're just Psalms
[1:34:24] and Proverbs so he says here you go he
[1:34:29] says the deal is you can take this
[1:34:32] Bible he says do whatever you're going
[1:34:34] to do with it he says but if you're
[1:34:36] going to use it for smokes he said you
[1:34:38] read the page before you smoke
[1:34:41] it I says all right I wouldn't have done
[1:34:46] that he says okay so imram goes
[1:34:50] throughout his ministry and he's going
[1:34:52] he's doing the same thing and all these
[1:34:53] different these different prisons and
[1:34:55] leading people to the Lord and his
[1:34:56] ministry is just being blessed and and
[1:34:59] and he's leading all these people to
[1:35:00] Christ and then he comes back to that
[1:35:02] other prison months
[1:35:06] later he's got his Bibles again and here
[1:35:09] comes the same guy and he sees him he's
[1:35:14] like and he keeps
[1:35:16] preaching and the guy's like um uh and
[1:35:20] he's
[1:35:21] like and he keeps he keeps ministering
[1:35:24] and he keeps and and the guy's like hey
[1:35:27] I need a Bible I want another Bible him
[1:35:30] M looks at him and he says you're the
[1:35:33] same one that told me he says yeah I am
[1:35:35] I want another one he says why do you
[1:35:37] want another
[1:35:38] one he
[1:35:40] says well here's the
[1:35:43] deal he says I did what I told
[1:35:46] you he said I took the Bible I started
[1:35:50] tearing out the
[1:35:51] pages rolling the smokes
[1:35:54] and he said I smoke
[1:35:59] Matthew and then he
[1:36:02] says I smoked
[1:36:05] Mark and then he says and I smoked
[1:36:09] Luke he says then I got to John and he
[1:36:13] said John smoked
[1:36:16] me he said I fell in love with Jesus
[1:36:20] Christ he said but I read every page
[1:36:23] just like I told you I was going to do
[1:36:25] praise God and he said I read every page
[1:36:27] and I got to John and I saw that love in
[1:36:29] Jesus Christ and I gave my heart to the
[1:36:32] Lord Jesus and I need a Bible now that I
[1:36:34] can
[1:36:36] read and that man today that wasn't too
[1:36:39] long ago that man today imram is out
[1:36:42] preaching the gospel and I would bet
[1:36:43] that that man that gave his heart to the
[1:36:46] Lord Jesus in The Book of John I'll bet
[1:36:50] you that he is also serving the lord and
[1:36:53] leading others to Christ when these the
[1:36:56] musicians can come when these prodigals
[1:36:58] brothers and sisters when they
[1:37:01] leave have faith that they will come
[1:37:05] back and when these other when these
[1:37:08] Lambs when they go away and you still
[1:37:11] see that desire to serve God but they
[1:37:14] may fail have never ending patience with
[1:37:18] them love them and continue to bring
[1:37:21] them in don't en enable them to
[1:37:25] fail but bring them
[1:37:27] in sometimes brother Ary you got to go
[1:37:31] out and grab them out of the thicket and
[1:37:34] put them over your shoulders and bring
[1:37:36] them home but the thing that they will
[1:37:39] want to come home A friend of
[1:37:43] mine his
[1:37:45] son was
[1:37:48] out partying and drinking and everything
[1:37:50] and and he got he got drunk and uh
[1:37:55] he condemned him and you know who he
[1:37:58] called he said

[1:38:05] had too much to
[1:38:07] drink and the dad went and got him
[1:38:11] brought him in and now the young man I
[1:38:13] believe is serving the lord
[1:38:15] Jesus let me tell you when that
[1:38:18] salvation comes it may come through dad

[1:43:43] Fountain so
[1:43:46] rich
[1:43:48] sweet cast thy poor soul at the
[1:43:55] Savior
[1:43:57] feet
[1:43:59] plunging
[1:44:00] today and be made
[1:44:06] complete
[1:44:08] glory to his

[1:44:25] glory to his
[1:44:29] wonderful
[1:44:32] name there to my heart was the blood
[1:44:40] of
[1:44:42] Glory to his name brothers and
[1:44:50] sisters how blessed we are
[1:44:54] that we have this
[1:44:56] strength in this Congregation of people
[1:44:59] that God has given us that if I get weak
[1:45:03] you can pick me up that if you get weak
[1:45:07] somebody else can pick you up I can pick
[1:45:09] you up why would we ever forfeit this
[1:45:14] why would we some want something
[1:45:17] else we have been blessed we have been
[1:45:20] blessed beyond measure to have what we
[1:45:23] have and it breaks my heart to see
[1:45:25] people that don't want it and there's
[1:45:29] nothing you can do to give it to them
[1:45:32] they refuse it God gives you a
[1:45:36] gift and you say I don't want your
[1:45:40] gifts and it happen so often the
[1:45:43] Pharisees they refused God's
[1:45:45] Gift the religious people refuse God
[1:45:49] gifts God's gift and also as we see in
[1:45:51] The Prodigal Son they receive God's gift
[1:45:54] but every single one of these Parables
[1:45:57] has a happy
[1:45:59] ending and imagine those people that
[1:46:01] were in that congregation when Jesus was
[1:46:03] preaching
[1:46:05] this and they found
[1:46:07] hope that they could return to
[1:46:11] God that he was there for them or that
[1:46:14] their children could come
[1:46:16] back let's bow our heads
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:26] I hope that each one here could relate
[1:46:28] to these stories that our lord Jesus
[1:46:31] gave and you can
[1:46:33] say I'm a
[1:46:36] prodigal or you could
[1:46:38] say I'm praying for a prodigal or many
[1:46:42] of us can say I'm
[1:46:45] both just Place yourselves in these
[1:46:48] scriptures and remember God's hearing
[1:46:50] your prayers last week we talked about
[1:46:52] continue to
[1:46:54] knock even if you don't get an answer
[1:46:57] there is a bigger picture there is a
[1:47:00] perfect will of God and this person that
[1:47:02] you're praying for if it's
[1:47:05] yourself if it's someone
[1:47:08] else there's God's
[1:47:11] time put the trust in God and if it is
[1:47:15] yourself God's times now don't waste any
[1:47:18] more time come to God and don't forfeit
[1:47:23] that gift that he has given
[1:47:25] you our heavenly
[1:47:28] father Lord thank you for the ministry

[1:47:46] almost can't contain myself about how
[1:47:48] wonderful it
[1:47:51] is how great is the word of
[1:47:55] God I can imagine how those people in
[1:47:59] that congregation as Jesus was preaching
[1:48:02] I can imagine how they felt Lord feel
[1:48:05] like I have a little taste of
[1:48:07] it

[1:48:12] people's hearts
