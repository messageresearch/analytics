[39:07] you
[39:09] are the one
[39:12] i praise
[39:15] [Music]
[39:16] amen what a promise we have from god
[39:19] he's uh he watches over us he keeps us
[39:23] brother peter if you would put that
[39:24] scripture back up the scripture that was
[39:26] up before
[39:28] for god hath not given us a spirit of
[39:30] fear
[39:31] but of power
[39:33] and of love
[39:34] and of a sound mind
[39:36] i read that this morning i said oh this
[39:38] just to be reminded of that
[39:40] in a day in a time when
[39:42] so much is happening
[39:45] and satan works through fear
[39:48] fear binds you
[39:49] it it has so many um
[39:53] reactions to it things that happen
[39:55] because of fear
[39:57] and as our brother joe spoke he said not
[39:59] even cancer and he said brother brown
[40:01] says if you don't fear it
[40:03] because fear allows other spirits to
[40:06] come in with it
[40:07] and it's just amazing that god's word
[40:09] has an answer for every situation
[40:12] if we can believe it
[40:15] and then the other scripture brother
[40:16] peter
[40:17] first peter chapter 1.
[40:20] i didn't give him this one but first
[40:22] peter chapter 1 verses 3 to 7
[40:26] if we to get that up
[40:28] blessed be the god and father of our
[40:30] lord jesus christ
[40:31] which according to his abundant mercy
[40:33] has begotten us again unto a lively hope
[40:37] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[40:40] the dead
[40:41] what a promise
[40:44] to an inheritance incorruptible and
[40:46] undefiled
[40:47] that fadeth not away
[40:50] reserved in heaven for you
[40:53] it's got your name on it it's yours
[40:56] who are kept by the power of god through
[40:58] faith unto salvation
[41:01] ready to be revealed in the last
[41:04] time wherein ye greatly rejoice and then
[41:08] peter says is though now for a season if
[41:10] need be
[41:12] you are in heaviness through manifold
[41:14] temptations
[41:16] and all of us would raise our hands and
[41:17] say we've had our days like that and we
[41:19] might have it or months like that at
[41:20] times
[41:21] but there's a promise of god there
[41:23] [Music]
[41:24] and it says
[41:26] that the trial of your faith being much
[41:28] more precious than gold that perishes
[41:31] though it be tried with fire might be
[41:33] found unto praise and honor and glory at
[41:36] the appearing of jesus christ
[41:39] sometimes you've got to read the last
[41:41] verse
[41:42] and i'll get stuck on the verse of one
[41:43] or two see what god has said so
[41:46] we thank the lord a bit he is mindful of
[41:48] us and merciful to us
[41:53] we have some requests to remember and
[41:56] brother tony ramirez had called me
[41:58] yesterday and this morning he sent a
[42:00] text
[42:01] him and sister maria had gone out to
[42:03] take sister maria at a doctor's
[42:04] appointment
[42:06] and as they stepped out he didn't
[42:09] notice the
[42:11] cement
[42:12] tire guard there and he tripped over it
[42:14] and he felt flat on his side on his ribs
[42:18] and he said he just couldn't get up and
[42:21] of course sister maria couldn't pick him
[42:22] up but right about then he said two
[42:24] healthy young men came walking by and
[42:26] they were able to stand him up
[42:29] so he would say well but he fell but god
[42:31] still met his need
[42:33] and he sent a text this morning that it
[42:35] was quite sore whether he damaged him or
[42:38] bruised him so we would remember him in
[42:42] prayer and then also continue to
[42:45] remember sister lydia
[42:47] mcfadden's mother and the family at this
[42:49] time
[42:50] in prayer
[42:53] and then our sister victoria goxiala
[42:55] told me that her nephew
[42:57] was sent to the hospital
[43:00] and he had had possibly a heart attack
[43:02] so
[43:03] we'll keep him and remember and
[43:05] then i asked sister rachel how brother
[43:07] al peterson was doing
[43:08] he says his vital signs are good but he
[43:10] has very little strength
[43:12] very little energy so
[43:15] i think often of brother l what a
[43:17] blessing brother l has been and
[43:19] encouragement and
[43:21] for me a mentor
[43:24] allowed me to stand back there with him
[43:27] way back in the beginning and learn
[43:30] watch him how he treated people how he
[43:33] acted in certain situations and watch
[43:35] the godly man
[43:37] work and it's been a blessing and i
[43:39] remember that so
[43:41] we'll keep him in prayer
[43:43] brother toby if you would come up and
[43:46] you'll stand
[43:49] just three times my heart said call
[43:51] brother toby so
[43:52] trying to learn to listen
[43:55] and there's a reason to why
[43:57] god knows
[43:58] you have a need you would raise your
[44:00] hand lord i've raised it a hundred times
[44:01] but you're still the same yesterday
[44:03] today and forever

[48:17] everybody
[48:19] but god kept us all stopped slow enough
[48:22] or else it would have been a serious
[48:23] accident in front
[48:24] and it just reminds you lord i'm glad
[48:26] you're watching over me
[48:28] so i have no control
[48:30] in reality you don't really have control
[48:32] of your own self
[48:34] you have to commit it to god so
[48:35] appreciate that so
[48:39] as we know
[48:40] have you heard of sister joyce dougal
[48:43] in her graduation
[48:46] returning back to who she was in the
[48:47] beginning
[48:49] and we kind of laugh about it even
[48:51] brother ed said something but
[48:53] my daughter elizabeth had wanted to give
[48:55] her some cookies
[48:56] and she said lord please don't take her
[48:58] yet i haven't got her the cookies yet
[49:01] but she got she got to go home and and
[49:03] brother ed could share this better but
[49:06] his prayer had been don't let mama
[49:08] suffer
[49:10] and um
[49:11] as she laid there in bed and brother
[49:13] keith holding her hand
[49:15] she took a breath
[49:16] closed her eyes and went home
[49:19] the death of a child of god is precious
[49:22] in his sight
[49:24] and he's our comfort
[49:26] so elizabeth sent a text he goes oh
[49:28] sister bed he was waiting for sister
[49:30] joyce
[49:31] best of friends
[49:33] i said that to brother ed and he goes no

[49:37] said we're barely getting over sister
[49:39] betty being here
[49:41] and now we got to deal with sister joyce
[49:42] too
[49:45] i can imagine when the saints of god
[49:47] cross over and they're rejoicing
[49:49] and the wonderful time that it'll be but
[49:52] now we have another one to
[49:54] to look forward to to being with and

[53:44] it feels it feels good it feels really
[53:48] good
[53:48] to be in the house of the lord this
[53:50] morning i think i think especially good
[53:52] it always feels good to be here
[53:54] but it feels especially good i think it
[53:57] started with the song choices from my
[53:59] brother matthew i
[54:00] appreciated that i know brother aaron i
[54:02] heard him in the back
[54:04] in in the other room back there but
[54:05] aaron was just rejoicing and he was he
[54:08] was singing along with it and and i just
[54:10] i just appreciated it so much and
[54:13] appreciate
[54:14] being here and
[54:16] i don't see uh brother i don't think i
[54:19] know you in the back there it's good to
[54:21] have you and the very black god bless
[54:23] you
[54:24] it's good to see it's always good to
[54:26] have people joining us
[54:28] and and worshiping with us brother
[54:30] daniel my friend it's good to see you
[54:31] over there too
[54:33] um
[54:35] we uh
[54:36] i was especially blessed you know with
[54:39] the song choices and then and then
[54:41] brother aaron put up first peter chapter
[54:44] three
[54:45] verses three through seven and and this
[54:48] morning as i was going over in my notes
[54:51] i had those scriptures in my notes and i
[54:53] took them out
[54:54] because i figured this was getting too
[54:56] long but it looks like god wanted those
[54:58] red this morning
[54:59] so i do appreciate that i appreciate the
[55:02] holy spirit leading brother aaron
[55:05] and and the things that he does and he's
[55:07] such a kind person
[55:09] he um
[55:10] his patience
[55:12] you know and uh
[55:13] sometimes
[55:15] if you have a personality like mine
[55:17] you're always pushing pushing and
[55:19] pushing and
[55:20] and trying to get things done and
[55:22] and sometimes
[55:24] when you have my personality you push
[55:26] and you push right up to that line
[55:27] sometimes you go over that line a little
[55:29] bit
[55:30] you don't mean to
[55:31] but but you do and
[55:34] i was been struggling this week with
[55:37] with some
[55:38] just some things i felt like i didn't do
[55:40] a good job on wednesday night i felt
[55:41] like it it didn't please the lord in the
[55:44] way that i presented it but i don't
[55:46] think i said anything wrong but
[55:48] i just uh
[55:51] i felt like the lord wasn't pleased with
[55:53] me and and my
[55:55] and my experience and and um
[55:58] but he knows he knows that i tried and
[56:01] he gave me a
[56:02] he gave me a special treat
[56:05] the other day and and i was really i was
[56:07] worried about it and
[56:10] you know my i unload and my wife and
[56:12] she's she always takes care of me and
[56:14] you know i thank god
[56:16] for a good help mate
[56:18] so so many of us we're so blessed by
[56:22] we put the pressures on our spouse
[56:25] and and they carry it
[56:27] for us and um
[56:29] but i think god if he could have given
[56:31] us something better
[56:33] than a spouse
[56:35] he would have done it he gave us eternal
[56:36] life
[56:37] but he gave us to help me to go through
[56:40] this life together
[56:42] as i was as i was praying about things
[56:44] and and repenting to the lord
[56:47] um
[56:48] i think it was on friday morning i was
[56:50] just sad down on myself
[56:52] and i read this scripture in psalm 30.
[56:55] brother i'm sorry i didn't give you this
[56:56] but it's okay if you don't put it up
[56:58] at uh psalm 30 verse five he's
[57:01] the
[57:02] psalmist david says this he says
[57:05] he's talking about the lord he says for
[57:06] his anger endureth
[57:08] but for a moment
[57:10] what a blessing
[57:12] that we can we can displease the lord
[57:14] and all of us do
[57:16] but his anger endureth just just for a
[57:18] moment
[57:20] in his favor is life
[57:22] weeping may endure for a night but joy
[57:26] cometh in the morning
[57:27] how encouraging you think about david
[57:29] and
[57:30] and all the mistakes that david made
[57:33] and you can think maybe david was he was
[57:35] repenting of something that he did he
[57:36] did some some hard things
[57:39] you know he caused a man to be murdered
[57:41] he committed adultery and he did and you
[57:43] can see how david could go before the
[57:45] lord and say lord i'm sorry
[57:48] and then that peace
[57:50] of the lord would come down upon him
[57:52] what a blessing
[57:54] and i i was
[57:55] a little tell a little
[57:57] story on me i don't see jordan here so
[58:00] this is this is good i'm gonna i'm gonna
[58:02] say something about brother jordan he um
[58:04] after service on wednesday night um i
[58:07] was going through on wednesday night i
[58:08] was going to first timothy chapter 3 and
[58:09] the qualifications of a pastor and i was
[58:11] going through each one
[58:13] and
[58:14] brother jordan after service
[58:18] he says brother daniel he says
[58:20] you left out something you just read
[58:23] right over it
[58:24] you skipped it
[58:26] and i said i did i said what was that he
[58:28] said patience
[58:31] and he was right
[58:32] i just i just went right i was like well
[58:34] that's fitting it's
[58:36] there and it's a weakness that i have i
[58:38] think that's why we love each other so
[58:39] much by the end his brother aaron has
[58:40] the patience of job and he's like slow
[58:43] down brother dan slow down
[58:45] come on let's move
[58:47] so thank god you know i think i thank
[58:49] god that he's made us all different and
[58:51] all of us come together perfectly
[58:54] to serve the lord and to and to make one
[58:57] united body i'm so i'm so grateful i'm
[59:01] so grateful for that
[59:03] i um
[59:04] i read i read a story
[59:06] the other day and uh it was a study
[59:10] that uh was done by harvard university
[59:13] in the 1950s a long time ago
[59:16] and uh it was a story um it was it was
[59:19] an experiment that they did
[59:21] on uh on rats and and they had they had
[59:25] um domesticated rats and they had wild
[59:28] rats and they and the kind of the
[59:30] purpose of the experiment was to see the
[59:33] difference in fortitude between these
[59:35] domesticated rats and these wild rats
[59:39] and and kids don't
[59:42] do this don't repeat this
[59:44] this uh this experiment at home with
[59:48] your pet gerbil or something because i'm
[59:49] not responsible for what might happen
[59:52] but what they did what these scientists
[59:54] did was it was a man named richter i
[59:56] believe his name was dr kurt richter
[59:58] from harvard university
[1:00:00] and he took
[1:00:01] a a sample set
[1:00:03] of these rats domesticated rats and
[1:00:05] white and wild rats and he put each of
[1:00:07] them in a bucket of water
[1:00:10] and he let him swim around for a little
[1:00:13] while
[1:00:14] and with all the rats he did i don't
[1:00:16] know how many was in his experiment how
[1:00:18] his sample set was but
[1:00:20] they all
[1:00:21] would swim for about 15 minutes
[1:00:25] and then they would drown
[1:00:28] and he didn't see a difference between
[1:00:31] the domesticated rats and the wild rats
[1:00:34] they all kind of croaked at the same
[1:00:36] time they all they all gave up
[1:00:38] and died
[1:00:40] so then he went on to do the next part
[1:00:42] of his experiment
[1:00:44] and
[1:00:45] he took the same amount of rats the
[1:00:47] domesticated rats and the wild rats and
[1:00:50] he put each one of them in a bucket of
[1:00:51] water and he let them swim
[1:00:54] and they started about 15 minutes
[1:00:57] they started to drown
[1:00:59] and he grabbed him
[1:01:01] out of the water
[1:01:03] and he took them and he put them in a
[1:01:04] place let them dry off a little bit let
[1:01:06] them dry out
[1:01:08] and he did that with this whole set
[1:01:11] of rats
[1:01:13] and
[1:01:14] after a while after they had a chance to
[1:01:16] recover he took them and he put them
[1:01:19] back in the bucket of water
[1:01:23] to see how long they would swim this
[1:01:25] time
[1:01:26] again there was no difference
[1:01:28] between the domesticated and the wild
[1:01:30] rats
[1:01:32] the first set
[1:01:33] died at 15 minutes
[1:01:35] took him out the second said he took
[1:01:37] them out put them back in
[1:01:40] for the lyle the second time
[1:01:43] they swam for 60 hours
[1:01:48] big difference
[1:01:50] they had been in there
[1:01:53] they started to sink at 15 minutes
[1:01:56] the scientists took them out
[1:01:59] set them aside let them dry out a little
[1:02:01] bit
[1:02:02] then put them back in
[1:02:04] what was the difference
[1:02:07] for the while
[1:02:08] what was the difference between the
[1:02:10] second
[1:02:11] time and the first time
[1:02:15] amen brother say it louder
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:19] the second time even in
[1:02:22] in this little rat
[1:02:24] the second time
[1:02:26] they had hope
[1:02:27] the first time they had no hope
[1:02:32] and it just blessed me so much reading
[1:02:34] that
[1:02:35] and i read it a couple times i said you
[1:02:37] know surely this is this can't be 60
[1:02:39] hours versus 15 minutes but it was
[1:02:42] and as as we all do we look at things we
[1:02:45] look at things with the spiritual
[1:02:48] way
[1:02:49] and we see that even these little
[1:02:51] animals
[1:02:52] that once they had hope they were just
[1:02:55] going to swim with that hope that there
[1:02:57] was going to be a hand come down and
[1:03:00] pluck them out
[1:03:01] and save them amen
[1:03:05] in uh
[1:03:06] in second kings
[1:03:08] we we know the story
[1:03:10] of uh of the special lady and we all
[1:03:12] know the story we call her the
[1:03:13] shunammite woman
[1:03:15] the shunamat woman she
[1:03:17] she and her husband
[1:03:19] built this
[1:03:20] this room
[1:03:22] on top of their house for this prophet
[1:03:24] named elisha
[1:03:26] she saw something special in this man
[1:03:29] elijah he saw something special in this
[1:03:31] prophet she knew that that he was
[1:03:33] special
[1:03:34] so they built this room up there and
[1:03:36] just were kind to him
[1:03:38] where after a while elisha he didn't
[1:03:40] maybe didn't feel that he was worthy of
[1:03:42] all these blessings and all this work
[1:03:44] that this
[1:03:46] family did for him and he and he asked
[1:03:47] his servant he says
[1:03:49] what does she need what can i do for her
[1:03:52] can i talk to the king for he's an
[1:03:53] important man can i do something for her
[1:03:56] and his servant gehazi said well she
[1:03:59] doesn't have a child
[1:04:00] she's childless
[1:04:02] and he says
[1:04:04] he says okay
[1:04:06] he said tell her this and he prophesied
[1:04:09] he said you're gonna have a child
[1:04:11] so she had this baby and the baby you
[1:04:13] know she loved him like any mother does
[1:04:15] and the baby grew up and he was working
[1:04:17] out in the field with his dad
[1:04:20] and and we know the story he said my
[1:04:22] head my head and he probably got
[1:04:24] overheated out of sun stroke she brought
[1:04:26] him back and she laid the boy
[1:04:29] on the bed of the prophet he was gone
[1:04:33] so then
[1:04:34] she saddled the donkey
[1:04:37] and she went to find this man of god and
[1:04:40] she found him and he saw her out
[1:04:43] out in the in the distance coming and he
[1:04:44] says hey there's something wrong here
[1:04:47] she's she's coming and she doesn't do
[1:04:49] this type of thing
[1:04:51] and
[1:04:52] jesus said i i don't know
[1:04:54] so
[1:04:55] she got to him and she fell down and she
[1:04:57] said
[1:04:58] my son's died the son that you prayed
[1:05:01] that i would have he's he's dead
[1:05:04] so elisha did a very strange thing he
[1:05:06] takes his staff and he gives it to his
[1:05:08] servant he says go lay the staff
[1:05:11] on this child
[1:05:13] and he says i'll be there in a little
[1:05:14] bit
[1:05:16] and there i believe it's the first time
[1:05:18] that we see
[1:05:20] the prayer cloth
[1:05:22] the the the um
[1:05:24] taking some sort of a a garment or
[1:05:27] something from a man of god and putting
[1:05:29] it on someone else i believe that's the
[1:05:31] first time in the bible that we see it
[1:05:34] so and elisha knew he knew that
[1:05:36] everything that he touched was blessed
[1:05:40] how much
[1:05:42] should the bride
[1:05:44] how much can we say the same thing
[1:05:46] that everything that we touch is blessed
[1:05:49] we're in tune
[1:05:50] with the spirit we're in tune with god
[1:05:53] so much confidence that everything that
[1:05:55] we would touch would be blessed i want
[1:05:57] to get to that place
[1:05:58] i don't feel and i'm even close to that
[1:06:00] place yet
[1:06:01] but i want to get to get to that place i
[1:06:03] have the hope that maybe those rats had
[1:06:06] swimming around that one day i'll get
[1:06:08] there
[1:06:10] so
[1:06:11] elisha came
[1:06:13] and he came to the house and he went up
[1:06:16] and he saw the dead baby laying on the
[1:06:18] bed
[1:06:20] and he knew
[1:06:22] elisha had experience
[1:06:25] he had been plucked out before he had
[1:06:28] seen the power of god before he had been
[1:06:31] a protege
[1:06:32] of another prophet named elijah
[1:06:35] and elijah
[1:06:37] elisha was following him and elise
[1:06:39] elijah knew that he was going to go up
[1:06:40] with the lord he took off his coat he
[1:06:42] came to this river he took off his coat
[1:06:45] and he smote the river and the river
[1:06:47] jordan opened up on both sides
[1:06:50] and then elijah and elisha walked
[1:06:53] through
[1:06:54] on dry ground and elisha was standing
[1:06:57] there
[1:06:58] and he saw this chariot of fire come
[1:07:01] down
[1:07:03] and it picked up this man of god and
[1:07:05] elijah threw his mantle his coat
[1:07:08] down to elijah elisha took that coat
[1:07:12] and he came to this jordan river and he
[1:07:14] smacked it he says where is the god of
[1:07:16] elijah
[1:07:19] and the waters parted
[1:07:21] elisha knew he had an experience he knew
[1:07:25] that god was on the throne he knew what
[1:07:26] god could do
[1:07:28] so he came to this baby
[1:07:31] and this baby was laying there and he
[1:07:33] laid his hands upon his hands his mouth
[1:07:35] upon his mouth he laid upon this baby
[1:07:39] and he prayed
[1:07:42] and the baby started to get warm
[1:07:45] and then he got up and he walked around
[1:07:48] and he walked around and he paced around
[1:07:51] the room and
[1:07:52] and and and you know there was a there's
[1:07:54] probably anxiety there and he was he was
[1:07:56] going he says well the baby's not he's
[1:07:58] not up yet but he still had the hope he
[1:08:00] still knew that god was on the throne he
[1:08:02] paced
[1:08:03] and he laid down on the baby again
[1:08:07] his mouth upon his mouth his hands upon
[1:08:09] his hands and we know the story the baby
[1:08:12] sneezed seven times and came back and he
[1:08:14] gave the baby back
[1:08:17] to his mother
[1:08:19] elijah knew elisha knew
[1:08:21] he had been there before he had been he
[1:08:24] had been taught well
[1:08:26] in
[1:08:28] in john
[1:08:30] chapter eight
[1:08:32] there's a story you don't have to you
[1:08:33] don't have to turn there there's a story
[1:08:35] about a woman
[1:08:37] that was caught in the very act of
[1:08:40] adultery
[1:08:41] the very act
[1:08:43] she was in adultery
[1:08:45] with another woman's husband
[1:08:48] and she was she was with that man
[1:08:51] and caught in that act
[1:08:53] it uh it says that
[1:08:55] she was she was out at the mount of
[1:08:57] olives which is outside the city of
[1:08:59] jerusalem it was a place they can't
[1:09:01] stone the people inside the city so they
[1:09:03] brought her out to be stoned and she was
[1:09:06] and she was there
[1:09:08] and she was looking
[1:09:10] at all the people there
[1:09:12] and all was lost she was going to die
[1:09:15] they had the stones in their hands
[1:09:18] and she looked at these stones and all
[1:09:20] was lost she was sinking
[1:09:23] in the water all was lost
[1:09:25] but then
[1:09:27] there came someone
[1:09:30] and he was there someone that she never
[1:09:31] knew
[1:09:32] she didn't know who this man was
[1:09:36] and
[1:09:38] the uh
[1:09:39] these pharisees these men that were
[1:09:40] going to kill this women
[1:09:42] this woman
[1:09:43] they knew
[1:09:44] this jesus
[1:09:46] man had a soft spot in his heart
[1:09:50] for people
[1:09:52] they knew that he would have trouble
[1:09:54] following moses's law here what they
[1:09:57] thought so they said we're going to
[1:09:59] catch him
[1:10:00] but aaron we know this guy we know that
[1:10:02] he loves the people so they're going to
[1:10:04] catch him
[1:10:06] so
[1:10:07] they ask him they say jesus
[1:10:10] they said
[1:10:11] she was caught in adultery and here are
[1:10:13] all these men with these stones in their
[1:10:15] hands
[1:10:17] they said this they said what would you
[1:10:19] do
[1:10:20] you know what jesus did
[1:10:22] he knelt down
[1:10:24] he ignored him he starts drawing
[1:10:27] in the sand
[1:10:29] and you can imagine
[1:10:31] this sister sitting there all of a
[1:10:34] sudden she had hope
[1:10:36] there was something hopeful going on
[1:10:38] right now
[1:10:40] and she's
[1:10:42] he's drawing
[1:10:44] and he says this
[1:10:46] he says he stands up
[1:10:48] and he says let he that is without sin
[1:10:52] let him cast the first stone
[1:10:54] and they're standing there
[1:10:56] and then he turns back around
[1:10:59] and kneels back down
[1:11:01] starts drawing in the sand
[1:11:03] and you see the wisdom over there and
[1:11:05] you see how age is important here
[1:11:07] from the oldest first
[1:11:10] these pharisees
[1:11:14] they dropped the rock
[1:11:15] they walked away
[1:11:18] from the oldest
[1:11:19] all the way to the last one there he was
[1:11:22] the youngest
[1:11:26] he dropped his
[1:11:27] and he left
[1:11:29] can you imagine how this lady felt could
[1:11:31] you imagine the hope that she felt
[1:11:34] she was about to die she was guilty of
[1:11:37] death
[1:11:38] she deserved it
[1:11:40] but she's standing there and and uh
[1:11:43] jesus
[1:11:46] he uh says
[1:11:49] where are your accusers
[1:11:52] and she says they're gone
[1:11:55] and he says this
[1:11:56] he says sister he says neither do i
[1:11:59] accuse you
[1:12:01] he says and then he says go
[1:12:04] and sin no more
[1:12:06] what a story if you look at the old
[1:12:08] testament law she had to die
[1:12:12] but then grace
[1:12:13] steps in and i just think about that
[1:12:16] lady i think that she never once that
[1:12:18] hope was placed she was pulled out of
[1:12:20] that water she could swim forever
[1:12:23] and i would i one day i want to talk to
[1:12:25] her and say now what happened after that
[1:12:27] you know she was an encouragement she
[1:12:29] said he did it for me he can do it for
[1:12:31] you
[1:12:32] i was just
[1:12:34] i think of uh
[1:12:37] let me go to let me uh let me go to
[1:12:39] scripture here
[1:12:42] romans chapter 8.
[1:12:46] well let me finish before
[1:12:49] before i get to romans chapter 8
[1:12:52] jesus
[1:12:53] when she left
[1:12:56] he said go and sin no more
[1:12:58] he makes this statement
[1:13:02] then spake jesus again unto them
[1:13:05] and he says i am the light of the world
[1:13:08] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:13:11] darkness
[1:13:12] but shall have the light of life
[1:13:14] amen and then and then you look and and
[1:13:17] that lady she could testify that i was
[1:13:21] about to go yes he's got the life he's
[1:13:24] got the light
[1:13:25] romans chapter 8
[1:13:28] verse 24
[1:13:31] for we are saved by hope
[1:13:34] but hope that is seen is not hope
[1:13:38] for what a man seeth
[1:13:40] why does he yet hope for
[1:13:43] why would paul say that i mean it
[1:13:46] actually it makes it makes sense when
[1:13:48] when you read it
[1:13:51] it but it's but it's a it's a strange
[1:13:53] statement that he would would say but it
[1:13:55] it just makes sense it's like if you
[1:13:57] hope for it and you already have it why
[1:13:59] are you hoping for it
[1:14:01] we have
[1:14:03] the hope
[1:14:04] friends of something like those and i
[1:14:06] don't want to
[1:14:07] compare us and i feel
[1:14:09] i don't feel checked i feel it's right i
[1:14:11] don't want to compare us to these rats
[1:14:13] that are in the water
[1:14:15] but the amazing grace that saved a
[1:14:17] wretch like me i mean we can we can we
[1:14:19] can compare ourselves to those little
[1:14:21] animals that were in the water and we
[1:14:23] see that that if we have that hope we
[1:14:26] can keep swimming
[1:14:27] we can keep going we can keep pushing we
[1:14:29] can keep moving
[1:14:33] verse 25
[1:14:34] but if we hope for that
[1:14:36] we see not
[1:14:38] then
[1:14:39] we with patience
[1:14:41] wait for it amen how beautiful likewise
[1:14:44] the spirit also help with our
[1:14:45] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:14:48] should pray for as we ought
[1:14:50] but the spirit itself
[1:14:52] maketh intercessions for us with
[1:14:54] groanings which cannot be uttered i love
[1:14:56] that scripture it's probably my favorite
[1:14:57] scripture in the whole bible i
[1:14:59] absolutely love that because it's not
[1:15:01] when we are praying
[1:15:03] we have the hope we know that god can do
[1:15:06] it
[1:15:07] we've seen him do it but when we are
[1:15:09] praying
[1:15:10] there is something there is a next step
[1:15:14] that we make
[1:15:16] then it's not us praying brother jeremy
[1:15:18] it's the holy spirit that is speaking
[1:15:21] through us and then god
[1:15:24] takes that faith
[1:15:27] of jesus christ and he
[1:15:30] places in our hearts we can't do it
[1:15:32] ourselves
[1:15:34] god has to do it himself he takes it and
[1:15:36] he places it in our hearts so we don't
[1:15:38] have to worry about it
[1:15:40] it's his we know he can do it we have
[1:15:42] the hope
[1:15:44] we have we have the patience to wait for
[1:15:45] it we can keep swimming i can keep
[1:15:47] swimming until the cows come home i'm
[1:15:50] going to keep going i'm going to keep
[1:15:51] swimming because i know that he can do
[1:15:54] it
[1:15:56] and then
[1:15:57] he takes that faith he places it there
[1:16:00] and it happens amen
[1:16:04] galatians chapter 2.
[1:16:12] knowing
[1:16:13] 2 verse 16 thank you knowing that a man
[1:16:16] is not justified by the works of the law
[1:16:20] but by the faith of jesus christ
[1:16:23] even we have believed in jesus christ
[1:16:25] that we might be justified by the faith
[1:16:28] of christ and not by the works of the
[1:16:30] law
[1:16:31] for by the works of the law shall no
[1:16:33] flesh be saved be justified that poor
[1:16:36] sister that had sinned she was gone
[1:16:40] but christ came in
[1:16:43] and
[1:16:44] we can't friends we can't
[1:16:46] so often it's just like say it over and
[1:16:48] over and over and over and over and then
[1:16:49] it'll happen that's not how it works
[1:16:51] you know we all of us we've seen that
[1:16:53] fail so many times it's like just
[1:16:55] confess it just confess it that is good
[1:16:57] and we should do that
[1:16:59] but there is something that happens that
[1:17:01] we get into that channel
[1:17:03] and then
[1:17:05] god sends down that faith
[1:17:07] and we're healed and i've seen it happen
[1:17:09] so many times but i've also seen it
[1:17:11] happen the other way i've seen people
[1:17:13] say over and over and over i got it i
[1:17:15] got it i got it i got it but you don't
[1:17:17] have it yet
[1:17:18] you have the hope of it which is good we
[1:17:21] need the hope but you haven't got it yet
[1:17:24] it takes god so have faith in him
[1:17:26] just wait on him
[1:17:30] and friends that's why
[1:17:31] brother brown's ministry
[1:17:33] means so much to me
[1:17:36] because we saw
[1:17:37] through the through the ages we've seen
[1:17:41] people we've seen blessings come and
[1:17:44] we've we've seen them go and
[1:17:46] and it's always been
[1:17:49] on a man or a woman's heart
[1:17:52] to really touch god
[1:17:55] to really have that relationship on a
[1:17:58] real son or daughter of god it's really
[1:18:01] in us
[1:18:03] and then
[1:18:04] boy
[1:18:05] back in the late 40s and 50s
[1:18:08] a man
[1:18:09] came to this world and he had it
[1:18:14] he had the goods
[1:18:17] and he could come to the platform and he
[1:18:19] could say your name is this and this and
[1:18:20] this
[1:18:21] you're you're suffering with this this
[1:18:24] and this go and be healed and friends
[1:18:26] the the
[1:18:28] hope
[1:18:29] raised
[1:18:31] and they said somebody can do this we
[1:18:32] haven't seen this
[1:18:35] and it raised the people's hope it
[1:18:37] raised the people's faith and then as
[1:18:40] they came to the platform and he would
[1:18:42] tell them their name he would tell them
[1:18:44] what was going on in their lives and
[1:18:45] there was no way anyone could know that
[1:18:47] it could be nothing other than god
[1:18:49] telling this man this
[1:18:51] and then then they were able to grab
[1:18:53] hold of that faith
[1:18:54] that's why it means so much to me
[1:18:57] brother bran's ministry it it's it's so
[1:18:59] dear to my heart and it makes me it
[1:19:02] hurts me that people attack it the way
[1:19:04] they do
[1:19:05] i know
[1:19:06] brother branham was not infallible
[1:19:09] i know that i know brother branham was
[1:19:12] not god
[1:19:13] i know that that doesn't bother me
[1:19:16] but what bothers me is people constantly
[1:19:18] attacking and then they will take
[1:19:21] brother branham's ministry and they will
[1:19:22] see look at how he messed up here look
[1:19:24] how he made this mistake here and look
[1:19:25] at all this over here therefore he's
[1:19:27] false and get away and then the people
[1:19:29] lose the hope
[1:19:32] they lose that
[1:19:33] and it hurts the people it doesn't help
[1:19:35] anybody
[1:19:36] to do that i could go up here and i
[1:19:38] could say
[1:19:39] brother branham said this here and this
[1:19:41] here brother branham was wrong here and
[1:19:43] here and how would that help anybody i
[1:19:45] wouldn't want somebody to do that to me
[1:19:47] would you want somebody to stand in this
[1:19:49] pulpit
[1:19:50] and tell you
[1:19:52] how wrong you were tell and tell
[1:19:54] everybody else how wrong you were that's
[1:19:56] not right
[1:19:58] that doesn't do any good to anybody
[1:20:00] and with brother branham of course he
[1:20:02] made mistakes of course he was a man
[1:20:04] but let me tell you something he had
[1:20:06] something that i want
[1:20:08] he had a relationship with jesus christ
[1:20:11] that i want to have and because he came
[1:20:15] and because i have seen it i've seen it
[1:20:17] on video i listen to his tapes i hear
[1:20:19] the testimonies because he came i have
[1:20:21] the hope that i can have it too
[1:20:24] and sorry friends you can't take that
[1:20:25] away from me
[1:20:26] he holds a special place in my heart and
[1:20:29] his ministry i will stand on it and i
[1:20:33] will fight for it
[1:20:34] because it was the truth
[1:20:36] it showed us that god is alive
[1:20:39] and it increased my faith and tell the
[1:20:41] truth it introduced me to a living
[1:20:43] christ
[1:20:45] it did and that's that's my testimony i
[1:20:47] tell it all the time brother branham's
[1:20:49] ministry introduced me to a living jesus
[1:20:51] christ just as john the baptist did with
[1:20:54] with
[1:20:55] andrew and andrew and john
[1:20:58] he introduced them to christ you know
[1:20:59] what he introduced me to him too and he
[1:21:01] gave me the hope
[1:21:03] that whatever i have need of that god is
[1:21:06] able
[1:21:07] he is able to take care of it
[1:21:10] there was a
[1:21:12] there was a friend of mine in
[1:21:14] jeffersonville
[1:21:15] um
[1:21:16] the reason that i know i know so many
[1:21:19] testimonies and i like to give
[1:21:20] testimonies when when i'm when i'm
[1:21:23] speaking jesus did
[1:21:25] jesus most much of his ministry was
[1:21:27] testimonies with stories it was parables
[1:21:30] because if i if i'm reading all these
[1:21:32] scriptures brother aaron you'll forget
[1:21:33] them
[1:21:34] you know and it's we're human
[1:21:37] and if you're not writing them down and
[1:21:38] then going back to the sermon and going
[1:21:39] over things you'll forget those things
[1:21:42] but you won't forget these stories
[1:21:45] just like jesus and he's telling the
[1:21:46] good samaritan story all of us know it
[1:21:50] we don't know the details we know the
[1:21:52] details but we don't know where in the
[1:21:54] scriptures and all this it may be
[1:21:56] but it's stuck with us
[1:21:59] and that's that's why i enjoy telling
[1:22:01] these stories because i know that you're
[1:22:03] going to remember these there was a
[1:22:05] there was a friend of mine in
[1:22:06] jeffersonville he and i
[1:22:09] we would often go out and and just
[1:22:11] find old folks and and ask them if they
[1:22:14] knew a man named william branham
[1:22:17] well
[1:22:18] this friend of mine was in salem indiana
[1:22:21] and he asked this older
[1:22:23] lady he said
[1:22:25] you ever heard of a man named william
[1:22:27] brown
[1:22:28] she says yeah she says
[1:22:31] she says there was these two ladies in
[1:22:32] the hospital
[1:22:34] she said
[1:22:35] they were they were in the same room
[1:22:38] both of them
[1:22:39] were dying of cancer
[1:22:42] and
[1:22:43] two this one lady her two friends went
[1:22:46] to brother branham's meeting
[1:22:48] and they got a handkerchief
[1:22:51] and brother branham in the meeting he
[1:22:53] said take this handkerchief
[1:22:56] and take it to this lady that's in the
[1:22:58] hospital your friend and lay it on her
[1:23:02] so
[1:23:03] they did what they instructed they took
[1:23:04] and they went to the hospital room and
[1:23:06] they said oh we went to william
[1:23:07] branham's meetings and it was great and
[1:23:09] we saw these heels healings and and
[1:23:11] here's a handkerchief he said to lay it
[1:23:13] on you
[1:23:14] he said to pen it to your to your
[1:23:16] garment your undergarment
[1:23:18] and uh she was embarrassed
[1:23:22] this lady was
[1:23:23] and she didn't she didn't want to do it
[1:23:25] she she was embarrassed and she's like
[1:23:27] oh no you know i don't uh
[1:23:29] i don't really want to do that
[1:23:31] um
[1:23:32] you know i'm not it's not that's not for
[1:23:34] me
[1:23:35] so then the lady there was a curtain and
[1:23:38] then the lady in the bed next to her
[1:23:41] says um
[1:23:43] if you're not going to take that i'll
[1:23:44] take that
[1:23:47] there was hope she was dying both of
[1:23:50] them were dying
[1:23:51] and there was hope there was hope in
[1:23:53] this one lady she had hope that this man
[1:23:55] was of god that these stories that she
[1:23:57] had heard as she was listening that
[1:23:59] these were true she said if you're not
[1:24:00] going to take it i'll take it
[1:24:02] so she takes the prayer cloth she pins
[1:24:05] it to herself
[1:24:07] and then my friend
[1:24:09] talking to this lady the lady says that
[1:24:10] was my mother
[1:24:13] the other lady
[1:24:14] died and she said my mother lived
[1:24:18] because she had hope
[1:24:21] she had that and she got a hold of it
[1:24:24] and then she made she made a step
[1:24:27] we
[1:24:28] uh my mom
[1:24:31] she uh she died of breast cancer
[1:24:35] and she uh
[1:24:38] we um stephanie was there we were we had
[1:24:42] we were having home meetings because mom
[1:24:43] couldn't move
[1:24:45] mom could not get up out of the chair
[1:24:49] and walk across the room
[1:24:51] and she was
[1:24:53] the cancer was here she couldn't raise
[1:24:54] up her arm
[1:24:56] she was very very sick
[1:24:59] and
[1:25:00] we were we would we would go over to her
[1:25:03] house with dad and and the whole family
[1:25:05] would come together it was a nice time
[1:25:08] of fellowship with the family and we
[1:25:10] would listen to one of brother braham's
[1:25:11] tapes
[1:25:12] we'd sing and we'd have service there at
[1:25:15] home
[1:25:16] and
[1:25:18] one day
[1:25:19] it had been raining it seemed like for a
[1:25:21] month
[1:25:22] and it's dark outside
[1:25:26] and
[1:25:27] we uh
[1:25:28] we listened to a tape
[1:25:30] and i told the family i said okay let's
[1:25:33] let's pray let's pray for mom
[1:25:36] so i went over to mom
[1:25:38] and i laid my hands on her
[1:25:41] and i remember saying these words i
[1:25:44] remember saying
[1:25:45] satan you have no right to her
[1:25:48] back off
[1:25:49] my brother adam
[1:25:51] was
[1:25:52] standing with his hand on mom here
[1:25:57] right next to where the cancer was
[1:26:00] and the cancer
[1:26:02] pushed
[1:26:03] out
[1:26:04] of my mom
[1:26:06] and my brother felt it
[1:26:08] on it
[1:26:09] he was afraid
[1:26:12] it pushed out and it pushed into my
[1:26:14] brother and my brother kind of backed up
[1:26:15] and
[1:26:17] he told me what had happened afterwards
[1:26:19] and
[1:26:19] and
[1:26:20] as we were praying and and my wife can
[1:26:23] remember this remember when the sun just
[1:26:25] shone into the window
[1:26:27] it had been raining for for weeks it
[1:26:29] seemed like and the sun just came in the
[1:26:32] window
[1:26:33] and it was just it was such a beautiful
[1:26:35] time and and my mom was sitting in her
[1:26:37] chair
[1:26:38] and she stood up
[1:26:42] and we
[1:26:44] kept singing
[1:26:46] and then
[1:26:48] she raised her hand
[1:26:52] and then she raised both hands
[1:26:54] she hadn't been able to raise that hand
[1:26:55] she hadn't been able to walk then she
[1:26:57] raised that hand
[1:27:00] and then she said this she said it's
[1:27:02] leaving she said it's leaving
[1:27:06] and she started walking around and
[1:27:08] rejoicing and the next day my mom walked
[1:27:12] hiked four miles in charlestown state
[1:27:15] park
[1:27:18] but then
[1:27:20] it came back
[1:27:22] five years later
[1:27:24] the sickness came back
[1:27:26] and she suffered friends she suffered
[1:27:28] like i don't know if it would be
[1:27:30] possible for any human being to suffer
[1:27:32] that much
[1:27:33] i don't know why
[1:27:35] i always wondered lord why would you do
[1:27:37] that
[1:27:38] to mom
[1:27:39] and then
[1:27:41] have her suffer
[1:27:42] the way that she did
[1:27:44] remember god's ways are not our ways
[1:27:47] his thoughts are not our thoughts
[1:27:50] i think about job
[1:27:52] job
[1:27:53] he was a great he was a great man and
[1:27:56] and
[1:27:57] he was he was a godly man a good man if
[1:28:00] anybody didn't deserve persecution
[1:28:03] it was job
[1:28:05] and then sister shirley there was a
[1:28:07] meeting in heaven
[1:28:09] and the sons of god came and presented
[1:28:11] themselves before the lord and satan was
[1:28:14] with them
[1:28:15] and then you know what happened
[1:28:17] god picked a fight with satan
[1:28:21] he says this hey have you ever
[1:28:23] considered my servant job
[1:28:26] and satan was like well yeah you protect
[1:28:28] him all the time
[1:28:30] he said he said yeah you know of course
[1:28:32] of course you know he's a good man you
[1:28:34] protect him all the time and then god
[1:28:36] tells satan he says okay just don't take
[1:28:38] his life but you can take whatever else
[1:28:39] you want
[1:28:41] god
[1:28:42] picked a fight with satan and poor job
[1:28:45] is here on earth and he has no idea
[1:28:46] what's going on
[1:28:48] he has no clue what's going on but there
[1:28:50] was something going on in heaven that we
[1:28:52] didn't understand
[1:28:54] just like there's something going on now
[1:28:56] in heaven that we may not be privy to
[1:28:59] but we want to be on the right side of
[1:29:00] these things
[1:29:02] so then satan comes in
[1:29:05] and he takes job's children
[1:29:07] the worst thing that a parent could
[1:29:09] think of he takes job's children yet job
[1:29:12] stands strong
[1:29:14] so then we have another meeting sister
[1:29:15] shirley that we talked about the other
[1:29:17] day the same meeting
[1:29:19] the second time the sons of god came up
[1:29:22] satan was with him god does it again
[1:29:25] have you considered my servant job i'm
[1:29:27] proud of the guy
[1:29:28] he's my boy i'm proud of this guy this
[1:29:31] is my servant job and poor job is down
[1:29:34] here on the ash heap and he's just
[1:29:35] struggling man and god's up there saying
[1:29:37] that's my boy
[1:29:39] i'm proud of him
[1:29:41] satan
[1:29:42] see
[1:29:44] satan says well you know you're still
[1:29:45] protecting him he's still got his health
[1:29:48] he says take his health
[1:29:50] so he goes
[1:29:51] and he gives him cancer or or whatever
[1:29:53] it was skin boils
[1:29:55] and just made job miserable
[1:29:58] but he had seen
[1:30:01] he had seen the tree and he had seen it
[1:30:02] fall down and saw another he'd seen
[1:30:04] another tree grow and he knew that there
[1:30:07] was a god he had that hope
[1:30:09] and then brother aaron you quoted to me
[1:30:11] when we were praying in the in the back
[1:30:13] i mean i thought came out of my shoes i
[1:30:15] didn't tell you but but brother when
[1:30:17] brother aaron and i were praying brother
[1:30:20] and quoted the same thing that i'm going
[1:30:21] to say right now
[1:30:23] job stood strong and he said though my
[1:30:26] skin worms destroy this body yet in my
[1:30:29] flesh i will see god he had hope he was
[1:30:33] swimming and he was like i'm not sinking
[1:30:36] and god's up there
[1:30:39] and he's like that's my boy
[1:30:41] and friends that's how we are so often
[1:30:44] you know we unders we don't understand
[1:30:46] why and
[1:30:47] and this is where i had aaron the the um
[1:30:51] the scripture that you put up in first
[1:30:53] peter
[1:30:54] you know what we don't understand why
[1:30:56] these things happen
[1:30:58] why why do they happen but there's
[1:31:00] something going on beyond our
[1:31:03] understanding
[1:31:04] that should be encourage us that we know
[1:31:07] just keep swimming just keep swimming
[1:31:10] because god is on the str on the scene
[1:31:12] and he's watching over as he knows about
[1:31:14] romans chapter 5
[1:31:21] therefore being justified by faith
[1:31:24] we have peace with god through our lord
[1:31:26] jesus christ by whom also we have access
[1:31:28] by faith into this great this grace
[1:31:31] wherein we stand and rejoice
[1:31:34] in hope of the glory of god
[1:31:40] amen
[1:31:41] and not only so but we glory in
[1:31:46] tribulations
[1:31:49] also knowing that tribulations the
[1:31:51] tribulation worketh patience we think
[1:31:54] it's strange when we go through these
[1:31:56] things
[1:31:58] but god is up there
[1:32:00] he's watching just like he was with job
[1:32:03] and he's proud of us he loves us
[1:32:05] he knows we're going to pass the test he
[1:32:08] knows we have hope he knows we're going
[1:32:09] to keep swimming
[1:32:11] he knows we're not going to sink but
[1:32:12] when we do start to sink there's a
[1:32:14] mighty hand that comes down and he'll
[1:32:16] pluck us out
[1:32:20] and we rejoice in tribulations in verse
[1:32:22] 4 and patience experience
[1:32:25] and experience
[1:32:27] hope
[1:32:29] i've had these experiences and you've
[1:32:31] all had these experiences we've seen
[1:32:33] others plucked out
[1:32:35] of the water and we've been plucked out
[1:32:37] ourselves
[1:32:38] amen
[1:32:40] and hope
[1:32:41] maketh not ashamed it doesn't put us to
[1:32:43] shame
[1:32:45] it uh it doesn't disappoint us
[1:32:48] because the love of god is shed abroad
[1:32:50] in our hearts by the holy ghost which is
[1:32:52] given unto us
[1:32:55] we may not understand it when we're
[1:32:58] praying we can say lord i don't
[1:33:00] understand why i'm going through these
[1:33:03] things i don't understand why my
[1:33:05] children go through these things why my
[1:33:07] brother why my sister i don't understand
[1:33:10] but i
[1:33:12] have faith
[1:33:13] i know that you have you have a handle
[1:33:16] on these things
[1:33:25] 4
[1:33:28] and
[1:33:31] i'll just go on for when we were yet
[1:33:33] without strength
[1:33:35] in due time christ died for the ungodly
[1:33:39] now look back at verse 3 there if you
[1:33:41] could put verse 3 back up
[1:33:44] and not only so but we glory in
[1:33:46] tribulations knowing that tribulation
[1:33:48] worketh patience that word tribulation
[1:33:52] and suffering and then all the it's it's
[1:33:55] all over the bible
[1:33:57] it's strange that it's in there that we
[1:33:58] would have to suffer i talked about my
[1:34:00] mom
[1:34:01] there i talked about job i talked about
[1:34:03] that lady that was in the hospital they
[1:34:05] were suffering
[1:34:07] and it's that's what god's will is can
[1:34:10] you imagine
[1:34:12] if if you were counseling somebody
[1:34:15] and they were saying
[1:34:17] i'm really struggling with this you know
[1:34:18] i have i have uh i have these people at
[1:34:21] work and they're really mean to me and
[1:34:23] and you know and i'm sick and i don't
[1:34:25] know why it's like man
[1:34:29] that is so great i'm so envious of you
[1:34:32] you imagine saying that no
[1:34:35] but that's the way we should be
[1:34:37] oh you're struggling great
[1:34:40] you're right in the lord's will yes
[1:34:42] you're partaking in this i'm not
[1:34:44] recommending that we do that but
[1:34:48] that's the way we should be
[1:34:51] but it sounds strange that sounds really
[1:34:53] odd but that's how jesus taught
[1:35:00] matthew chapter 5 verse 11.
[1:35:03] jesus taught when we're struggling
[1:35:07] we're blessed
[1:35:08] these tribulations work with patients
[1:35:10] these tribulations are good for us it's
[1:35:12] hard for us when we're hurting
[1:35:14] my my aunt jacqueline right now i don't
[1:35:16] know if if you all know her she's she's
[1:35:18] struggling with cancer
[1:35:20] and she's sick
[1:35:22] and i was i was in there with her
[1:35:23] yesterday and
[1:35:25] she was just down and she was sick and
[1:35:28] and she told me she says you know
[1:35:31] she says it's so easy
[1:35:33] for people to say you know
[1:35:36] just believe just be strong but when you
[1:35:38] feel it
[1:35:40] it hurts
[1:35:41] you know when you're sick man it's hard
[1:35:44] it's hard to have that faith because you
[1:35:47] feel that sickness
[1:35:48] but rejoice is what jesus said
[1:35:53] blessed
[1:35:54] are ye when men shall revile you and
[1:35:56] persecute persecute you and shall say
[1:35:59] all manner of evil against you falsely
[1:36:00] for my sake rejoice
[1:36:04] and be exceedingly glad for great is
[1:36:06] your reward in heaven for so persecuted
[1:36:08] they the prophets which were before you
[1:36:11] who talks like that besides the lord
[1:36:13] jesus
[1:36:15] but he had a
[1:36:16] wonderful he changed everything
[1:36:19] acts chapter 5.
[1:36:22] another
[1:36:23] example of suffering verse 40.
[1:36:28] and to him they agreed
[1:36:30] and when they had called the apostles
[1:36:31] and beaten them they commanded them that
[1:36:33] they should not speak in the name of
[1:36:34] jesus and let them go
[1:36:36] and they departed from the presence of
[1:36:38] the council rejoicing
[1:36:40] that they were counted worthy to suffer
[1:36:43] to suffer shame for his name and daily
[1:36:46] in the temple and in every house they
[1:36:47] cease not to teach and to preach jesus
[1:36:50] christ they literally rejoiced because
[1:36:54] they suffered amen
[1:36:56] and that's the way
[1:36:58] that god's children should be
[1:37:00] we should rejoice that we are suffering
[1:37:03] i know it it's against our dna
[1:37:06] but god can change our dna
[1:37:10] i have a i have a friend
[1:37:11] um
[1:37:13] he's uh kind of famous in message
[1:37:15] circles a few years ago his name is
[1:37:18] yusef nardakani
[1:37:20] brother youssef
[1:37:22] is a minister as a pastor in iran
[1:37:25] and
[1:37:27] he
[1:37:28] made a stand
[1:37:29] against the iranian government the
[1:37:31] iranian government was teaching islam
[1:37:35] to all the children in the school
[1:37:38] and brother yusef
[1:37:39] went to the school board and said this
[1:37:41] and said this is wrong
[1:37:43] you are forced we're christians you're
[1:37:46] forcing our children
[1:37:48] to believe this way and it's in the
[1:37:50] iranian constitution
[1:37:52] that
[1:37:53] that we are have freedom of religion so
[1:37:55] what did they do
[1:37:56] they threw yusuf in prison
[1:37:59] and then
[1:38:00] another brother brother matthias
[1:38:03] the same role as brother youssef there
[1:38:06] translating brother branham's message
[1:38:08] into farsi he
[1:38:10] felt he did the same thing with in a
[1:38:13] different way wanting to have church
[1:38:15] stood up against the government back in
[1:38:17] prison
[1:38:19] and these brothers they were in prison
[1:38:21] they were waiting they were saying i
[1:38:22] can't wait to get out to go back and
[1:38:24] preach the gospel and then i'll go right
[1:38:26] back in prison with young children
[1:38:29] with children that were five six seven
[1:38:31] years old
[1:38:33] yet it's worth it to me i'm gonna go
[1:38:36] right back into prison but i am going to
[1:38:38] preach this gospel and they counted it a
[1:38:40] blessing that they could suffer
[1:38:42] persecution
[1:38:44] brother youssef and those brothers
[1:38:46] we have it so easy
[1:38:48] here in the united states
[1:38:50] but over in different places in the
[1:38:52] world things are tough
[1:38:54] things are tough for a christian
[1:38:57] and uh you know what let me let me back
[1:38:58] up a little bit there
[1:39:00] to tell you the truth i don't know of a
[1:39:01] tougher place
[1:39:03] to be a christian than the united states
[1:39:05] of america
[1:39:07] i don't know of a harder place
[1:39:09] and it's not because so much that they
[1:39:11] throw us in prison or they kill us
[1:39:15] but it's that pressure
[1:39:16] that we feel it's that pressure that our
[1:39:19] young sisters feel that you sister's
[1:39:21] feeling you stand strong i am not going
[1:39:24] to bow
[1:39:25] to it you stand strong you keep swimming
[1:39:28] we're not going to do it we are going to
[1:39:30] stand with the convictions that we
[1:39:32] believe
[1:39:34] and
[1:39:35] you can be in work brother aaron it
[1:39:36] could be wherever we are it is
[1:39:38] persecuted it is looked down upon oh
[1:39:41] you're one of those weird people
[1:39:43] you know
[1:39:44] they say it
[1:39:45] and if they don't say it they look you
[1:39:46] up and down
[1:39:47] you know you're different you know this
[1:39:49] aaron garrett guy he's different
[1:39:51] you know he comes in and and he's doing
[1:39:53] his word he's different
[1:39:54] you know is one of those people but let
[1:39:57] me tell you something you sisters
[1:39:59] you go out
[1:40:01] the men don't they don't cuss around you
[1:40:03] they watch their tongue at least they
[1:40:05] should and i know they do it more they
[1:40:07] wash their tongue
[1:40:09] because they respect that
[1:40:11] they respect it but it is a tough place
[1:40:14] this united states to tough place to
[1:40:16] serve the lord
[1:40:17] i'm going to wrap philippians chapter 3.
[1:40:26] verse 8
[1:40:28] yea doubtless and i count all things but
[1:40:31] a loss for the excellency of the
[1:40:32] knowledge of christ jesus my lord for
[1:40:34] whom i have suffered the loss of all
[1:40:36] things and do count them but dung that i
[1:40:38] may win christ
[1:40:43] i like that you know i i didn't plan on
[1:40:45] stopping there but but it's like all
[1:40:47] these things that i lost because i'm a
[1:40:49] christian you know what i think of them
[1:40:52] he said it
[1:40:54] it's not it's dumb
[1:40:56] it's garbage
[1:40:57] it's
[1:40:59] it's it's it's nothing
[1:41:07] for whom i have for whom i have suffered
[1:41:09] the loss of all things and do count them
[1:41:11] but done that i might win christ
[1:41:13] and be found in him not having mine own
[1:41:15] righteousness which is the law but that
[1:41:18] which is through faith of christ the
[1:41:20] righteousness which is of god by faith
[1:41:24] that i
[1:41:25] may know him
[1:41:27] and the power of his resurrection and
[1:41:29] the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:41:32] there it is again
[1:41:34] christ is suffering i'm going to go
[1:41:35] right in there with it
[1:41:38] being made comfortable being made
[1:41:40] conformitable
[1:41:41] unto his death
[1:41:43] if by any means i might attain unto the
[1:41:46] resurrection of the dead that was paul's
[1:41:48] prayer
[1:41:49] he said lord let me suffer
[1:41:52] let me suffer like you suffered you've
[1:41:54] heard that you've heard the statement
[1:41:55] take up your cross
[1:41:57] and follow me take up your cross what
[1:42:00] does that mean
[1:42:01] that doesn't mean pick up a piece of
[1:42:03] wood
[1:42:05] that means take up my suffering
[1:42:08] this suffering that i had
[1:42:10] take that take that
[1:42:12] and carry that through this life
[1:42:20] jesus
[1:42:21] had people spit in his face
[1:42:24] what would we do
[1:42:26] they spit in his face for this gospel
[1:42:29] and paul's saying here he's saying i
[1:42:31] want to have someone do that to me
[1:42:34] paul is saying here he says i want to be
[1:42:36] so different from the world
[1:42:40] that i want my friends to leave me
[1:42:44] i want these people that have always
[1:42:45] been around me and been my friends
[1:42:47] growing up i want them to leave me
[1:42:50] because that's what happened to you lord
[1:42:52] jesus
[1:42:53] even your very best friends left you
[1:42:56] i want to suffer the same thing
[1:43:00] not of course to drive people away
[1:43:03] but to live that life of christ
[1:43:06] first peter chapter 4.
[1:43:12] for as much then as christ has suffered
[1:43:15] for us in the flesh
[1:43:17] arm yourselves likewise with the same
[1:43:20] mind
[1:43:21] so friends that means prepare yourselves
[1:43:23] for these persecutions that come to us
[1:43:26] every day
[1:43:29] for he that suffered in the flesh
[1:43:31] hath ceased from sin that he no longer
[1:43:34] should live the rest of his time in the
[1:43:35] flesh to the lusts of men but to the
[1:43:37] will of god
[1:43:41] you know friends i went
[1:43:44] i went into the ministry
[1:43:47] i knew
[1:43:48] full well
[1:43:50] that i was going to fail that i was
[1:43:52] going to fail
[1:43:54] multiple times i knew that
[1:43:56] and
[1:43:58] in in
[1:43:59] but it was worth it to me
[1:44:01] it was worth it to me that knowing that
[1:44:04] i'm a carnal person knowing that that i
[1:44:07] make many mistakes probably more than
[1:44:09] most
[1:44:11] but i knew
[1:44:12] i was going to fail and i was prepared
[1:44:15] for it
[1:44:16] i was prepared prepared to suffer there
[1:44:19] and i still am
[1:44:21] you know but
[1:44:22] it's worth it more to me
[1:44:24] if i could see
[1:44:26] people standing with this word
[1:44:29] standing with this bible
[1:44:31] standing with what this word says and to
[1:44:34] tell them keep swimming because this
[1:44:36] bible says that he's going to pluck you
[1:44:37] out one day
[1:44:39] this bible says that you have the hope
[1:44:41] of glory you have the hope of these
[1:44:43] things but one day that faith that
[1:44:46] rapturing faith is going to come into
[1:44:49] you and that master is going to pick you
[1:44:52] up out of that water and he's going to
[1:44:54] take you to glory
[1:44:56] that's what this word says
[1:44:58] and friends if we can point people to
[1:45:00] that brother peter as a minister of the
[1:45:02] gospel we point people to that hope
[1:45:06] it's going to happen one day and i want
[1:45:08] to be numbered with that group
[1:45:11] of people
[1:45:13] it could be any dire situation whatever
[1:45:16] it might be
[1:45:17] whatever the worst is jesus said come
[1:45:20] unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[1:45:22] laden and i will give you rest
[1:45:25] whatever the problem is and he goes on
[1:45:28] he says this
[1:45:29] matthew 11 28 brother peter
[1:45:33] come unto me all you that labor and are
[1:45:35] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[1:45:36] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:45:40] for i am meek and loyally in heart
[1:45:43] and ye shall find rest unto your souls
[1:45:47] for my yoke is easy
[1:45:49] and my burden is light
[1:45:52] i am more than able to carry
[1:45:55] your problems
[1:45:56] just just bring them to me
[1:46:00] friends i i think about those
[1:46:02] those little animals swimming around and
[1:46:06] and i'll close if sisters if you could
[1:46:08] come
[1:46:10] to your instruments
[1:46:11] i think about those little animals
[1:46:14] and and i think about them swimming
[1:46:15] around for 15 minutes and they didn't
[1:46:18] have the hope
[1:46:20] they didn't have christianity
[1:46:22] you know i look at the world and they
[1:46:24] they don't have it and if we are true
[1:46:27] christians
[1:46:28] if we love
[1:46:30] the lord jesus and if we truly know him
[1:46:33] we want to give that hope
[1:46:36] to someone else
[1:46:38] we want others to have that hope to us
[1:46:40] keep swimming
[1:46:42] keep swimming
[1:46:44] keep going
[1:46:45] things aren't so bad
[1:46:47] these these these
[1:46:49] sufferings that you have they're
[1:46:51] prophesied to come you're just
[1:46:53] fulfilling prophecy
[1:46:55] these these bodies they get sick and
[1:46:56] they die
[1:46:57] we want to be healed of course
[1:47:00] you know i but
[1:47:02] we're going to get old and if the lord
[1:47:04] doesn't come we're all going to walk
[1:47:05] that path i think if sister douglas
[1:47:08] you know we she's talked about it
[1:47:10] probably her whole life
[1:47:11] i didn't know sister dougal very well
[1:47:13] but she was friends with
[1:47:15] stephanie's family
[1:47:17] and ever since i've known stephanie i've
[1:47:18] heard the name sister dougal all the
[1:47:20] time
[1:47:22] as somebody that always was an
[1:47:23] encouragement
[1:47:24] to us and i think that apple didn't fall
[1:47:26] far from the tree brother
[1:47:28] you know brother i just lost his lost
[1:47:30] his mom
[1:47:31] and uh
[1:47:32] i was up and i was
[1:47:34] just kind of down like i was saying and
[1:47:36] brother ed calls up to encourage me
[1:47:38] and he just lost his mom
[1:47:41] you know to encourage us to keep going
[1:47:44] and then sister dougal passes over and
[1:47:46] now it's a reality
[1:47:48] she's not swimming anymore
[1:47:50] now she's safe in the hands of the
[1:47:52] master she's there she's protected
[1:47:56] and she's the lord's got her in his
[1:47:58] hands
[1:47:59] you know she's she's in his presence
[1:48:01] right now and you know what she's now
[1:48:03] doing she's not waiting for us
[1:48:06] and one day one day we will be there
[1:48:08] let's let's stand friends
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:16] thank god
[1:48:19] that we have
[1:48:21] hope
[1:48:26] brother peter if you put up
[1:48:29] the masterpiece 64 705
[1:48:33] brother branham says this and i hope
[1:48:35] this encourages you and like i said i
[1:48:37] love this man's ministry
[1:48:39] it has been such a blessing to me it has
[1:48:42] given me hope my whole life

[1:49:21] and if you really love the lord
[1:49:23] you try to serve him with all your heart
[1:49:26] and then all your mistakes is hidden in
[1:49:28] the blood of jesus christ see

[1:53:46] niece got their swimming pool and my
[1:53:49] my grandchildren wanted to be in the
[1:53:50] pool so bad
[1:53:52] gave them some swimming lessons
[1:53:54] and then they terrified grandma and
[1:53:56] grandpa because they had no trouble
[1:53:57] jumping right in
[1:53:59] when you know that god is able
[1:54:02] because you've experienced him already
[1:54:05] taking you out then you're willing to go
[1:54:07] right in
[1:54:08] and you have calms as he started to give
[1:54:10] that story i said
[1:54:12] oh i know why

[1:54:16] were going to be rescued
[1:54:19] and what a joy that gives you what
[1:54:21] strength that gives you
[1:54:23] amen
[1:54:24] thank the lord for that
[1:54:26] and when you are having a little bit bit
[1:54:28] of trouble call somebody else and just
[1:54:30] say pray for me
[1:54:32] and they'll share you the trouble
[1:54:33] they've gone through and how god has
[1:54:34] delivered them
[1:54:36] because each one of us has gone through
[1:54:38] our times
[1:54:39] you know and as much as we'd love to say
[1:54:41] everything is always perfect it isn't
[1:54:43] that way we have the family over for

[1:55:02] for about 30 minutes and i had to go to
[1:55:04] the room and say i'm sorry
[1:55:05] because i wasn't right
[1:55:09] but you know how quickly you can say i'm

[1:55:18] your daughter and the reason you're
[1:55:20] going through what you're going through
