[32:13] um
[32:14] good to be in the house of god tonight
[32:16] amen
[32:17] i remember brother green saying a few
[32:19] times behind this pulpit that
[32:22] those that
[32:24] love the church come to church on sunday
[32:26] morning
[32:28] and those that love the pastor
[32:30] come to church on sunday night
[32:33] but those who love god come to church on
[32:34] wednesday night
[32:37] how many love god tonight amen
[32:39] blessed be his name
[32:41] amen if you have your bibles like to
[32:43] just turn to the scriptures right off
[32:45] turn to matthew chapter 7
[32:48] verses 1 through 5.
[32:56] my message tonight is
[32:58] titled judging righteously
[33:02] you ever heard the
[33:04] expression don't judge me
[33:07] anybody ever heard that
[33:09] had that thrown in your face don't judge
[33:11] me
[33:13] and the bible says
[33:15] you're not to judge
[33:18] and i feel like we hear this
[33:20] a lot in today's society
[33:22] and frankly i get annoyed by it
[33:26] sometimes i get annoyed because it's you
[33:28] it's
[33:29] it's used as a as a cop-out
[33:33] uh to keep someone from
[33:36] from any kind of accountability
[33:39] on their part
[33:41] don't judge me
[33:43] you're not supposed to judge
[33:45] judge not
[33:48] matthew 7 verse 1
[33:51] judge not
[33:52] that ye be not judged
[33:55] for with what judgment you judge
[33:58] you shall be judged
[34:01] with what measure you meet
[34:03] it shall be measured to you again
[34:06] and why behold this thou the moat that
[34:08] is in thy brother's eye
[34:10] but consider is not the beam that is in
[34:13] thine own eye
[34:15] or how will thou say to thy brother let
[34:17] me pull out the mote out of thine eye
[34:20] and behold a beam is in thine own eye
[34:23] thou hypocrite
[34:25] first casts out the beam out of thine
[34:26] own eye
[34:28] then shalt thou be see clearly to cast
[34:31] out the mote out of thy brother's eye
[34:34] father tonight lord as we
[34:36] open the scriptures father and
[34:39] speak about the word lord god we ask
[34:41] that you just anoint my lips my heart my
[34:43] spirit all that i am lord i know each
[34:45] one is here and those will be hearing
[34:47] through the through the medias or
[34:48] whatever they have here lord god that
[34:51] that or the phone systems whatever it
[34:52] might be that they'll be blessed lord
[34:54] god that it'll give us something to that
[34:56] we can hang on to lord in
[34:58] uh help us live our christian life
[35:00] before you we commit everything into
[35:03] your hands bless your people tonight
[35:05] i believe we've already been blessed by
[35:07] just being here in your presence
[35:09] we thank you in jesus christ's name and
[35:11] the church said
[35:12] god bless you may be seated
[35:19] what do people really mean they're
[35:21] saying don't judge me they don't want to
[35:23] be judged they don't want to be held
[35:24] accountable
[35:26] they want to live their life
[35:28] and they don't want to feel the
[35:29] conviction be convicted
[35:31] many times
[35:32] us by being christians and just being
[35:35] around them convicts them
[35:37] and they feel they're the spirit of the
[35:39] world and the spirit of christ and their
[35:41] contrary one to the other sometimes
[35:44] someone will
[35:45] come against you or be against you for
[35:47] no reason
[35:49] and if you were to ask them they
[35:51] probably wouldn't even know why they
[35:52] don't like you
[35:53] but it's just the spirit of the world
[35:56] it's contrary to the spirit of god
[35:59] and if we have the spirit of god
[36:01] and we're living for the lord
[36:03] then it's going to bring conviction to
[36:05] the people
[36:07] i can remember many years back when
[36:09] my son was probably about 10 years old
[36:12] and
[36:13] of course we're coming to this church
[36:14] here and
[36:15] and
[36:16] we had some neighbors that moved in and
[36:19] the father had a
[36:20] ponytail and
[36:22] and so did the sun
[36:24] and after a few weeks we noticed they
[36:26] they were clear clean cut
[36:28] and we found out to the grapevine that
[36:30] they saw me and my son the way we had
[36:32] our hair and how we conducted ourselves
[36:35] it brought conviction to them
[36:38] and you don't realize it i remember i
[36:39] remember one time i was standing outside
[36:41] i
[36:42] i had some beautiful beautiful garden in
[36:44] the front of the house or where we used
[36:45] to live on 15th avenue in tucson years
[36:48] ago and
[36:49] it had a it was like a park it had roses
[36:51] and beautiful lawn and everything and a
[36:54] fellow a neighbor that i i don't even
[36:56] knew him he was just four or five houses
[36:58] down and on a wheelchair and he came up
[37:01] and he started struck up a conversation
[37:03] with me
[37:04] and
[37:05] you know telling you how beautiful the
[37:06] garden was and everything and we got to
[37:08] talk and he said you know when you think
[37:10] of when you pray next time he said pray
[37:12] for me he says i hear you you pray
[37:14] beautifully and i
[37:16] you know that what do you hear he hear
[37:17] hear me pray you know
[37:20] and i remember i guess sometimes we'd
[37:22] have our family altars and i don't know
[37:24] if they could hear through the door or
[37:25] what but
[37:27] i'm not one i don't i don't pray in my
[37:29] mind i like to pray out loud
[37:32] i like to speak out
[37:34] amen just like when i read the word i
[37:37] like to read it out loud because hearing
[37:39] faith comes by hearing
[37:41] i want to hear myself
[37:43] read that word i want it's going to give
[37:45] me faith amen
[37:47] and so we find that people though just
[37:49] don't like to they don't like to feel
[37:51] that
[37:52] that conviction
[37:54] um
[37:56] is it true when people say i i don't
[37:58] judge
[38:00] i feel like
[38:01] i feel like we all judge
[38:04] and and really it really there's there's
[38:06] something the word judge
[38:09] can mean two different things
[38:11] i don't know if he ever notices but this
[38:12] is just my my
[38:14] observation
[38:16] that
[38:16] it it can be where you're condemning
[38:18] somebody
[38:20] and i believe that's why it says here
[38:21] judge not that ye be not judged don't
[38:23] condemn lest you be condemned
[38:26] that's what he's talking about
[38:28] and the other part
[38:30] that in my observation of judging
[38:33] is actually discernment
[38:36] we discern we're constantly
[38:38] judging you're judging me right now as
[38:40] i'm standing up here speaking to you
[38:42] is that right
[38:44] you're judging what i'm saying
[38:46] if i get off the word you you should
[38:48] know
[38:50] you're going to judge that
[38:52] you're discerning me you know and and i
[38:54] believe a pastor will discern the people
[38:57] as he greets him as they're coming in as
[38:59] parents you discern your children
[39:03] i can remember brother green given the
[39:05] testimony one time
[39:07] uh when he was taking the girls to
[39:09] school
[39:10] and and
[39:11] i think it was tina the youngest said
[39:14] when she stepped out of the car
[39:16] and she got among her friends her walk
[39:20] suddenly became different and brother
[39:22] green caught that
[39:24] i remember brother biscuit gave the
[39:26] testimony one time where he came home
[39:29] and he felt
[39:31] a spirit in the home
[39:34] and and it was one of his children
[39:36] and
[39:37] we discerned these we need to be the we
[39:39] need to and brother brad says we have a
[39:42] certain amount of discernment
[39:45] you you talk to someone for five minutes
[39:47] ten minutes
[39:48] and you talk about whatever the weather
[39:50] but after a while after a few minutes
[39:52] you can start discerning that person
[39:54] what kind of a person that is
[39:56] because god's given you discernment
[39:59] now we don't have a discernment like
[40:00] brother branham where
[40:01] you know your name where you live and
[40:03] all that's that's totally different but
[40:05] we have some discernment of spirit
[40:08] that god has given us
[40:10] um
[40:11] so what what is the meaning of don't
[40:14] judge
[40:15] that's exactly what it is you don't
[40:17] condemn
[40:19] don't don't be of a condemning spirit
[40:22] uh you see somebody coming to this
[40:25] church and there it may be a woman that
[40:27] maybe that doesn't come here and they're
[40:28] just visiting and she may not be dressed
[40:31] right
[40:32] and we can sit there and condemn that
[40:33] woman
[40:35] you know we can start judging her not
[40:37] knowing her past
[40:39] and brother brian even talks about the
[40:41] woman the prostitute on the corner
[40:43] and you might sit there and maybe wait
[40:46] for the light to turn green and she's
[40:47] standing there in the corner dressed as
[40:49] a prostitute and you could condemn her
[40:51] all you want but you don't know her life
[40:54] brilliant talks about if you could ask
[40:56] her
[40:57] what choices what brought her to those
[41:00] choices that she made in her life
[41:03] and many times we don't know like
[41:05] brother brandon would say until you walk
[41:07] in somebody's moccasins for a while then
[41:09] then you can understand why
[41:12] someone might make a certain choice or a
[41:14] certain
[41:15] decision in their life that maybe you're
[41:16] not in agreement with
[41:19] but we don't know everything
[41:21] i'm sure glad that god who is the judge
[41:25] knows everything he knows the ends he
[41:28] knows he out he knows the whys
[41:30] and the why nots
[41:32] of our lives and of every life
[41:34] and we don't know
[41:36] we might think we know but as you say
[41:38] you've heard the saying there's two
[41:39] sides of your coin and you might hear a
[41:40] story about somebody and cause you to
[41:43] have a certain uh feeling towards that
[41:45] person
[41:46] but you don't know the whole story
[41:49] and
[41:50] there was a certain brother and i'm not
[41:51] going to mention his name but
[41:53] from years back another church went to
[41:56] and
[41:56] that he
[41:58] he was a minister and he was an
[41:59] evangelist and he preached a lot in
[42:01] mexico a lot in in south america
[42:04] and then things started coming back to
[42:06] us you know of a wrong kind of testimony
[42:09] and for a lot of years i just had him in
[42:11] a certain perception
[42:13] and you might end up having a perception
[42:15] of a person by by something you heard or
[42:18] or maybe something you saw in the person
[42:21] i don't know
[42:22] but your perception could be so wrong
[42:27] and it wasn't until
[42:28] he passed away
[42:30] and i began to see because i i'm in the
[42:32] uh
[42:33] whatsapp with a lot of ministers from
[42:35] south america
[42:37] and they began to put up videos of his
[42:38] brother preaching the word and
[42:40] i mean i'm talking you know
[42:43] assemblies i mean a place is this big
[42:45] packed out and the power of god moving
[42:47] among the people and he's there
[42:48] preaching a great anointing
[42:50] and and it began to change my my idea
[42:53] and perception of the man to the point i
[42:55] said he was that time he was sick he
[42:56] wasn't dead yet but and i said lord
[42:59] maybe i had a wrong perception about
[43:00] this brother you know we just tend to be
[43:02] judgmental and condemning
[43:05] and we don't know all the ends and all
[43:07] the outs
[43:09] you might think you do but do you and we
[43:12] and we can we can arrive at a certain
[43:14] perception of somebody and condemn that
[43:17] person in our heart
[43:18] you know maybe not even ever say
[43:20] anything but it's there none nonetheless
[43:23] and god knows your heart
[43:25] and he says judge not
[43:27] lest you be judged
[43:30] and and the way you judge him you're
[43:32] going to be judged
[43:34] and i hear a prophet saying lord i don't
[43:36] want your judgment lord
[43:38] lord i want your mercy
[43:41] amen
[43:42] anybody here want to be judged
[43:44] i don't want to be judged not not not in
[43:46] the great white throne judgment uh i
[43:48] want his mercy amen
[43:51] now
[43:53] the greek word for judge means to
[43:54] condemn
[43:57] and we should not condemn
[43:59] anyone
[44:01] because we do not know
[44:03] what a person's eternal destination is
[44:05] going to be
[44:07] you might see somebody and think that
[44:09] person is
[44:10] is lost as lost and being but we don't
[44:12] know
[44:13] what's gonna happen further up ahead
[44:16] you know that that part is god's job
[44:19] and we're trying to get into god's uh
[44:22] position
[44:23] uh to condemn somebody or to put
[44:25] somebody out
[44:27] uh
[44:28] i've heard people come tell me well
[44:30] so-and-so i think he's serpent-seeder
[44:33] or so and that always rubs me wrong i
[44:35] just don't believe in saying that about
[44:37] anybody
[44:38] and we shouldn't
[44:40] because who who am i to say that
[44:42] so-and-so is serpent seed
[44:44] or to say so-and-so is not a child of
[44:46] god or so-and-so doesn't have the holy
[44:48] spirit well that i'm not i'm not the
[44:50] judge of that
[44:52] that's god's that's his that's his place
[44:56] it's our place if we see someone
[44:59] that would give us that kind of a
[45:00] thinking or a perception of that person
[45:03] maybe we should be on our knees
[45:06] if we have the right kind of spirit
[45:08] because do you want to see that person
[45:10] lost
[45:12] you know you might have someone in your
[45:13] mind and that someone you know that
[45:16] maybe he's done you some wrong
[45:18] and
[45:19] and and i'll give you one i had a
[45:22] son-in-law
[45:23] and somebody you know probably knew
[45:24] kevin considine
[45:26] and he he's keeping your prayers
[45:29] you know he ruined my daughter's life
[45:31] and sent her on her pathway that her
[45:34] health began to fail and and and she now
[45:36] she's with the lord
[45:38] but he's in a bad way right now he's
[45:40] he's taking he's a he's a meth addict
[45:43] he's hit the bottom of the barrel
[45:46] his own parents have a
[45:48] have a uh
[45:49] what do they call it a a
[45:51] judgment against them to keep away
[45:54] i forget what they call that
[45:57] yeah and
[45:58] uh and i and i have no animosity toward
[46:01] him
[46:02] i've always kept my heart clean about
[46:04] that not to hate him
[46:06] and my wife as well you know we actually
[46:08] we feel sorry for him we pray for him
[46:12] because uh i don't want him to be lost
[46:15] i think it'd be a wonderful thing if
[46:17] when it's all said and done and we're
[46:19] standing there in glory that he'll be
[46:20] there
[46:22] it would be a wonderful thing
[46:24] and
[46:24] there should be nobody in our on our
[46:26] mind or our heart that we want them to
[46:28] be lost
[46:31] you know but there's many that refuse
[46:34] they they don't want to be condemned and
[46:36] and they'll just throw that back at you
[46:38] you shouldn't judge me you shouldn't
[46:39] judge the bible says don't judge
[46:42] but it's because they don't they refuse
[46:44] to believe that there is a god because
[46:45] that god brings them in brings them back
[46:47] into accountability
[46:49] that's why that's why the world has gone
[46:51] in direction it has that's why
[46:52] scientists are trying to prove there is
[46:54] no god that's why they brought him
[46:56] evolution which is a lie
[46:58] they have believed the lie the bible
[47:00] says in romans
[47:01] and and and god's given them give them
[47:03] over to reprobate mind
[47:05] because they don't want that that
[47:07] accountability
[47:09] uh there was a man named ravi zacharias
[47:12] now he his ministry ended it if you know
[47:15] about the man
[47:16] it didn't end well right before he died
[47:19] he made some mistakes and missteps in
[47:21] his life
[47:22] but during his life he was very very
[47:24] intellectual man very very smart
[47:27] matter of fact i i can remember hearing
[47:29] him on the radio
[47:30] on sunday morning as we were driving the
[47:32] tucson tabernacle back in the day
[47:34] and he'd be on the radio on i think on
[47:37] the the christian station they have here
[47:40] and he'd be preaching i thought man this
[47:41] guy is really he had words that
[47:44] i didn't i didn't know what they meant
[47:46] i mean he was real intellectual very
[47:48] very he was indian
[47:50] he was from from india
[47:52] you know a lot of indians are very very
[47:54] cultured people very educated
[47:56] matter if you go to either go or go down
[47:58] to the university hospital these
[47:59] hospitals you you see how many indian
[48:01] doctors they have very educated people
[48:05] and he was very educated and very very
[48:07] intellectual he would actually go out
[48:09] and he would debate
[48:11] atheists
[48:12] he would debate uh
[48:14] uh people who who who believed in the uh
[48:17] professors that the pro that taught
[48:20] evolution he would debate them
[48:22] and he would debate even muslims
[48:25] you very very smart man
[48:27] and he said this
[48:28] it takes intelligent design
[48:31] to take something that is possible and
[48:34] make it into something natural
[48:38] you know the bible said that there in
[48:40] hebrews at chapter 11 that things were
[48:43] made of things that did not exist
[48:46] and in other words god took a whole lot
[48:48] of nothing and made the whole universe
[48:50] out of it
[48:51] everything we see
[48:52] came out of nothing
[48:55] when he says when you say there is no
[48:57] such thing as evil
[49:00] you must assume
[49:01] that there is such a thing as good
[49:05] now
[49:06] if you say there's evil then then
[49:08] there's you gotta assume that there's
[49:09] good as well
[49:11] and he says when you assume that there
[49:13] is such a thing as good
[49:15] you must assume that there is such a
[49:17] thing as a moral law
[49:19] to differentiate
[49:21] between good and evil
[49:24] for you to say well this is evil
[49:27] and this is good
[49:29] but where's the moral it's got to be a
[49:31] moral law to dictate that to us
[49:33] and then he says
[49:35] when you assume that there is such a
[49:37] thing as moral law
[49:38] you must then assume that there is a
[49:41] moral law
[49:42] giver
[49:44] and that's where they run into a problem
[49:47] they don't want to assume that
[49:50] that there is a moral law giver
[49:53] and that's what's what the atheist wants
[49:56] to prove that there is no
[49:59] moral lawgiver so there is
[50:01] so if there is no moral law giver
[50:05] there is no moral law
[50:09] there is no good
[50:11] and there is
[50:12] uh
[50:13] no evil
[50:15] he says so the question
[50:17] self-destructs
[50:19] you come right back down to this where
[50:21] either it is or it isn't
[50:24] if there's good then there's evil if
[50:26] there's good and evil then there's a
[50:27] moral law then there's a moral law giver
[50:29] then there's a god
[50:30] now you bring a god into the picture
[50:33] and if you want to do away with the
[50:35] moral law giver and the moral law then
[50:37] there is no good and there is no evil
[50:41] so you're right back to zero again
[50:44] people just don't want to be brought
[50:45] into accountability for their lives
[50:48] and that's what that's what the whole
[50:49] thing is about they want to disprove
[50:51] that there's a god they want to live
[50:53] their life and not have any kind of fear
[50:57] that one day they'll stand before a god
[51:00] the bible says it's a fearful thing to
[51:02] stand before a living god
[51:07] in john chapter 8 verses 15 and 16
[51:11] here jesus says ye judge after the flesh
[51:15] i judge no man
[51:17] and yet if i judge
[51:19] my judgment is true can you say amen to
[51:21] that that's jesus speaking there for i
[51:24] am not alone and i and the father has
[51:27] sent me
[51:28] so if he judges his judgment is true
[51:32] i believe when he judges the people in
[51:34] that day in that great
[51:36] day of the judgment
[51:38] they're going to be judged exactly as
[51:40] they should be judged it's going to be a
[51:42] true judgment
[51:44] uh we we we tend
[51:47] we judge people a lot of time we judge
[51:49] by what we see on the outside
[51:51] if you remember that when samuel was
[51:53] sent to go and annoy anoint david
[51:57] and uh and and and they're in samuel 16
[52:01] verse 6 it says it came to pass when
[52:03] they were come that he looked on elia
[52:07] and said surely the lord's anointed is
[52:09] before him he must have seen elia must
[52:12] have been you i think he was the oldest
[52:14] and he was probably strong and
[52:16] square shoulders you know just powerful
[52:19] looking and tall and
[52:21] and but the lord said unto samuel look
[52:23] not on his countenance nor on the height
[52:26] of his stature because i have refused
[52:28] him
[52:30] for the lord seeth not as man seeth
[52:33] for man looketh on the outward
[52:34] appearance
[52:36] but the lord looketh on the heart
[52:40] we see the the an appearance of a person
[52:43] and we don't we don't know what's on the
[52:45] inside
[52:46] we just see the outside maybe we see
[52:48] some of their actions
[52:50] i mean and we disagree with them and it
[52:52] gives us a perception of that person
[52:55] you know we've all heard the expression
[52:58] don't judge a book by its cover
[53:00] but we do that
[53:02] we do it very often
[53:05] i remember brother caleb duron told me
[53:06] one time he had gone to a
[53:08] to a
[53:10] a halfway house to go see somebody there
[53:14] and he was met at the door by this guy
[53:16] came he filled the whole door he was
[53:18] about six foot six
[53:20] big man
[53:21] tattoos all over his
[53:23] neck and everything else
[53:25] and you look at someone like that and
[53:27] that's the kind of guy you don't want to
[53:28] run into in a dark alley
[53:31] you know and he said when he began to
[53:32] talk to him
[53:34] he realized the man he just he was in
[53:36] love with jesus
[53:38] he began to tell him how that
[53:40] you know he had been a biker and he had
[53:41] been he'd done a lot of things in his
[53:43] life and he went he went to jail he went
[53:45] to prison
[53:46] and they're in prison
[53:48] somebody witnessed to him
[53:50] and he met the lord
[53:52] they're in prison
[53:53] and so he went to the gang because
[53:55] everybody's in gangs in in prison you
[53:57] gotta you gotta belong to a gang or in
[53:59] some of these prisons otherwise they'll
[54:01] kill you
[54:02] so he went to the gang and he said you
[54:03] know i don't want to do this anymore i'm
[54:05] not gonna be a part of this gang so they
[54:08] gathered around and they were going to
[54:09] kill him
[54:10] and uh and the and the leader looked at
[54:13] him and he said wait a minute he says
[54:15] looks at him he said you got jesus
[54:18] he said yes i got jesus
[54:20] all right we're going to let you go he
[54:22] says but
[54:23] we're going to be watching you
[54:25] you better have jesus
[54:27] he says never saved him he thought you
[54:29] he thought he was going to die
[54:31] and he talked to caleb and caleb was
[54:33] telling me man
[54:34] you should have seen that guy you you
[54:36] just look at him and make you your heart
[54:38] skip a beat man because this guy he
[54:40] looked awful but when he starts talking
[54:43] he was like a little teddy bear
[54:45] you know but you judge that book like by
[54:47] the cover
[54:49] and that's what we do many times i'm
[54:50] glad that god looks at the heart
[54:53] because sometimes we might have a a
[54:55] rough exterior
[54:57] amen i've met christians that are kind
[54:59] of rough on the outside you know brother
[55:01] green was kind of rough on the outside
[55:03] if you're a double brother green i love
[55:05] brother green i'm not i'm not against
[55:07] brother green i loved him he was my
[55:08] pastor for many years but he was a
[55:10] little rough
[55:12] i remember one time we uh
[55:15] we were gonna have some meetings
[55:16] and we had a meeting back there brother
[55:18] aaron probably remembers that he told us
[55:19] all i want you all to be here
[55:22] you know me brother aaron brother
[55:24] brother uh uh bennett and caleb and
[55:27] and i forget who else brother knight
[55:31] and so uh
[55:33] something came up but my daughter
[55:35] jessica had come from pennsylvania
[55:38] and she had organized
[55:40] this is before all this had happened
[55:42] uh a retreat over in flagstaff we rented
[55:45] the cabin already given my money buy
[55:47] part of the money for it my wife and i
[55:49] are gonna be part of that or the whole
[55:50] fans get together
[55:52] and and i had and and uh so i was gonna
[55:54] go tell brother green that was sunday
[55:56] morning and i'd walked in right after
[55:58] newton bennett had walked out of there
[56:00] and telling brother green he wasn't
[56:01] going to be there
[56:02] and brother greene just went one went
[56:04] upside at him and came down the other
[56:07] and he stepped out
[56:09] and then uh
[56:10] i met caleb at the door and he and i and
[56:12] caleb knew i was going to tell brother
[56:14] green the same thing and pick kevin said
[56:16] i gotta go and he just stepped right out
[56:17] of the office left me in there by myself
[56:20] and oh my
[56:22] he was rough
[56:24] but you know
[56:25] that's just the the exterior
[56:27] and on the inside he had a heart of gold
[56:31] he had a heart of gold
[56:33] so a lot of times we judge a book by its
[56:35] cover we
[56:36] we really shouldn't we should uh
[56:38] you know uh
[56:41] allow the holy spirit
[56:43] to bring that
[56:45] that that a discernment that we could
[56:48] have of the spirit of somebody
[56:51] if you know what i mean
[56:53] in john 7 24 jesus again says
[56:56] the following and this is my sermon
[56:58] where i took my sermon title
[57:00] 7 24 judge not according to the
[57:02] appearance
[57:04] but judge righteous judgment
[57:08] judge not according to the appearance
[57:10] but judge righteous judgment
[57:13] so how can we judge righteously
[57:16] and still not judge or condemn
[57:19] now when it comes to judging others
[57:22] we are not to condemn anybody
[57:24] but rather discern their spirit
[57:27] have a discernment of their life
[57:30] but we are constantly like i said we're
[57:32] constantly deserting one another
[57:34] if you stand you're talking back there
[57:36] you're there's running each other you
[57:38] discern people while they're dressed
[57:40] what what words they speak
[57:43] we deserve all of that
[57:45] we're constantly doing that
[57:47] in in romans 14 and 10
[57:50] it says why does thou judge thy brother
[57:53] why does thou say that not thy brother
[57:56] you see now you're condemning that's
[57:58] condemning he said it not you're judging
[58:00] him you're condemning him
[58:02] for we shall all stand
[58:05] before the judgment seat of christ
[58:09] you see all of us have to be judged
[58:12] one way or another we're all going to be
[58:13] judged
[58:15] we'll all stand before
[58:17] as paul said before the judgment seat of
[58:19] christ
[58:21] galatians 6 chapters 1 verses 1-3
[58:24] brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[58:26] fault
[58:28] ye which are spiritual
[58:30] restore such and one
[58:33] in the spirit of meekness
[58:35] so if you see or you know something
[58:37] about somebody
[58:39] instead of going and telling everybody
[58:41] about that person and destroying them
[58:44] which happens many times
[58:46] you know the problem with church many
[58:49] times we shoot are wounded
[58:52] come on
[58:54] we shoot our wounded
[58:57] someone falls
[58:58] and you don't want nothing to do with
[59:00] him anymore
[59:02] instead of instead of reaching out to
[59:04] him
[59:05] and here
[59:06] paul writes brethren if a man be
[59:08] overtaken in a fault
[59:11] ye which are spiritual
[59:13] restore such an one
[59:15] in the spirit of meekness
[59:19] you see what happens is we lack humility
[59:23] if we had real meekness and humility
[59:26] amen
[59:28] blessed are the meek
[59:30] for they shall inherit the earth
[59:32] and there should be a meekness and
[59:33] humility about us that we don't want to
[59:35] we don't want any condemn anybody
[59:38] we want we want we want everybody to be
[59:40] saved
[59:43] he says considering thyself
[59:46] lest
[59:47] thou also be tempted
[59:50] because who here this this evening can
[59:52] say they're they're above they're above
[59:54] that no
[59:56] that you cannot be tempted
[59:58] that you cannot fail
[1:00:01] the bible says there is none righteous
[1:00:03] no not one
[1:00:05] we have all fallen short
[1:00:07] of the glory of god come on
[1:00:10] we've all
[1:00:12] who can stand here and and and point a
[1:00:15] finger at somebody
[1:00:17] as you say when you do that there's
[1:00:18] three pointing back at you
[1:00:23] where's that mercy where's grace
[1:00:26] that we want for ourselves
[1:00:29] can you allow that for someone else
[1:00:30] who's fallen
[1:00:32] if a man be overtaken in the fall
[1:00:35] ye which are spiritual
[1:00:38] restore such a one
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:42] for if a man thinks himself to be
[1:00:44] something verse 3
[1:00:47] when he is nothing
[1:00:49] he deceiveth himself
[1:00:52] if we were truly humbled before the lord
[1:00:55] and really
[1:00:58] had a perception of our own selves
[1:01:00] realizing we're nobody
[1:01:03] realizing that
[1:01:04] that
[1:01:06] without god we're nothing
[1:01:08] i don't know anything
[1:01:11] we don't know anything if you think you
[1:01:13] know something you don't know anything
[1:01:15] at all
[1:01:16] because you haven't learned yet
[1:01:18] what it is to be what it is to be
[1:01:20] spiritual
[1:01:22] is to be humble the way up with god is
[1:01:25] always down
[1:01:27] god's economy is opposite to man's
[1:01:30] economy
[1:01:32] humble yourself in the sight of the lord
[1:01:34] and he
[1:01:35] he will lift you up don't try to lift
[1:01:38] yourself up don't try to say well look
[1:01:39] at me i can do this or i can preach or i
[1:01:42] can do this i'm good at this or i'm i
[1:01:45] no no if you do that you got the wrong
[1:01:47] spirit to begin with
[1:01:51] it's like brother man was talking about
[1:01:52] a man that went up to speak and
[1:01:55] and and and when he went up there
[1:01:58] he went up there he was full of pride
[1:02:00] and thinking he was something
[1:02:02] and when he began to speak the people
[1:02:04] was not a single amen the people just
[1:02:05] looking at him
[1:02:07] and when he left
[1:02:08] he left with his head down
[1:02:10] and brother brown said had he come up
[1:02:13] the way he went down
[1:02:15] he would have gone down the way he came
[1:02:17] up
[1:02:18] do you follow me on that
[1:02:20] humility friends
[1:02:22] if we if we were more humble
[1:02:24] and when you see somebody fall
[1:02:27] this it's not to make you happy or
[1:02:30] or say ah look at that i knew it
[1:02:33] aha as brother greenwood preached one
[1:02:36] time many years ago aha
[1:02:38] got you look at that
[1:02:41] it shows the kind of spirit world
[1:02:45] james 5 19 and 20 says brethren if any
[1:02:48] of you do error from the truth
[1:02:50] and one convert him
[1:02:53] let him know
[1:02:54] that he which covered cover covereth the
[1:02:57] sinner from the error of his way shall
[1:03:00] save a soul from death
[1:03:02] and shall hide
[1:03:04] a multitude of sins
[1:03:08] i want to be i want to be a hider of
[1:03:10] sins amen
[1:03:13] not not not a tattletale now that
[1:03:15] someone's going to go around destroying
[1:03:16] somebody's life
[1:03:19] you know brother
[1:03:21] brother brown said
[1:03:22] you talk about a pastor
[1:03:25] and
[1:03:26] to tear him down before people
[1:03:28] why don't you just take a gun and shoot
[1:03:29] him
[1:03:31] come on
[1:03:32] take a gun and shoot him
[1:03:34] you're destroying him before the people
[1:03:38] be very careful
[1:03:40] how you speak about ministry if you go
[1:03:42] back into scripture if you've read the
[1:03:43] bible you know what i'm talking what
[1:03:44] paul says the honor
[1:03:47] that you have to we should give
[1:03:49] to a minister of the gospel
[1:03:52] you know there there's some of this
[1:03:53] message they want to call them this and
[1:03:55] call them that but i see the word of god
[1:03:58] where it says
[1:04:00] it says how beautiful are the feet of
[1:04:02] them
[1:04:03] the preacher the gospel of good of peace
[1:04:07] and bring glad tidings of peace
[1:04:10] how beautiful that's god's thoughts
[1:04:13] about his about those he is called to
[1:04:15] the ministry
[1:04:16] be very careful how you speak about
[1:04:19] and not just minister but anyone
[1:04:22] because we're we're all children of god
[1:04:24] the bible says touch not my anointed
[1:04:28] do my prophets no harm
[1:04:30] well i'm going to tell you is more we're
[1:04:32] the anointed of god
[1:04:34] be careful what we speak what about one
[1:04:36] another
[1:04:38] that's why the bible tells us again and
[1:04:39] again again love one another love one
[1:04:42] another
[1:04:43] have pray for one another
[1:04:47] amen
[1:04:50] you shall hide a multitude of sins
[1:04:54] be careful about having
[1:04:55] a condemning spirit
[1:04:58] you know brother brown talks about they
[1:05:00] they were going to have some people come
[1:05:01] to the church and
[1:05:03] these people had a reputation of
[1:05:05] of being a little bit pentecost
[1:05:08] and they had come to put a brand what
[1:05:10] are you gonna do brother when they start
[1:05:11] doing what they do
[1:05:13] well don't worry about i'll handle it
[1:05:15] and brother brandon said he was sitting
[1:05:17] there and they started singing and the
[1:05:19] little little sister got out and
[1:05:21] she started dancing on the hall on the
[1:05:23] aisle
[1:05:25] and he said he sat there on that what do
[1:05:27] you call it the the seat of uh
[1:05:31] of what
[1:05:33] yeah amen
[1:05:35] and he was just criticizing her
[1:05:37] and the holy ghost spoke to him said
[1:05:39] maybe you don't have the victory that
[1:05:41] she's got
[1:05:43] and he began to think about that and
[1:05:45] he's sitting there
[1:05:46] and he's contemplating that
[1:05:48] probably i could just see him going like
[1:05:50] this you know just wait a minute wait a
[1:05:52] minute
[1:05:53] david danced before the lord
[1:05:56] what about marion when she took that it
[1:05:57] was a great victory in the camp and
[1:06:00] god had destroyed their enemy and she
[1:06:02] took a tamporing and the women followed
[1:06:03] her and they began right there on the
[1:06:05] red sea shores as the song goes
[1:06:08] the holy ghost will set your feet to
[1:06:10] dancing
[1:06:11] the holy ghost will thrill you through
[1:06:14] and through
[1:06:15] and he began to contemplate that he said
[1:06:18] before he knew it he was moving he was
[1:06:20] kind of just tapping his foot a little
[1:06:22] bit with the music
[1:06:23] and before he knew it he was out there
[1:06:25] dancing with her
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:28] hallelujah
[1:06:30] got to be careful don't be don't be able
[1:06:31] to condemn your spirit
[1:06:34] allow somebody grace
[1:06:36] you want grace give grace to somebody
[1:06:38] else you want forgiveness give
[1:06:40] forgiveness to somebody else
[1:06:42] if you don't forgive the bible says god
[1:06:44] won't forgive you if you judge god's
[1:06:47] going to judge you
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:52] but like i said in church our problem is
[1:06:53] we just shoot our wounded
[1:06:55] don't fail around here we'll destroy you
[1:06:58] we don't want you here i've heard it
[1:07:00] said many times if if uh if david would
[1:07:03] have tried to come to our church we
[1:07:05] wouldn't want that old adulterer
[1:07:06] murderer in our church
[1:07:09] yet he was he was a man after god's own
[1:07:11] heart
[1:07:13] god looked at his heart
[1:07:15] he looked through all of that all the
[1:07:17] failures that he had
[1:07:19] he had some pretty big ones too
[1:07:22] but yet with all of that
[1:07:24] god loved him
[1:07:26] and he was a man after god's own heart
[1:07:30] in the in the message adoption and
[1:07:32] number two and back in 60 brother
[1:07:35] brother brown says i went after a
[1:07:36] brother not long ago
[1:07:38] had won astray
[1:07:40] a young fellow said to me he said let
[1:07:43] that rascal go
[1:07:45] let him alone
[1:07:47] i said if i ever get to a place that my
[1:07:50] heart don't go with my brother then it's
[1:07:52] time for me to go to the altar
[1:07:56] because i've fallen from grace
[1:07:59] if we don't feel when someone someone
[1:08:01] stops coming to church that we hear that
[1:08:03] they're they're out in the world
[1:08:05] and yet nobody will take the time to go
[1:08:07] see them or call them
[1:08:08] or you know where is our love
[1:08:12] where is if we have the love of god
[1:08:16] we're going to have a love for the for
[1:08:17] god's people
[1:08:19] we don't want to see anybody fail
[1:08:21] and brother brandon said if i don't go
[1:08:22] after him i have fallen from grace
[1:08:26] i said i'll go as long as he's got
[1:08:28] breath in his body
[1:08:30] and i'll catch him somewhere along the
[1:08:32] line
[1:08:34] yes sir i caught him
[1:08:36] hallelujah brought him back yes sir
[1:08:40] he's back in the fold safely now
[1:08:43] yes sir he would have won history as
[1:08:46] sure as the world
[1:08:50] amen the message discernment of the
[1:08:53] spirit
[1:08:54] 1960 bible man says we have we have
[1:08:58] discernment of spirit
[1:09:00] to discern the spirit
[1:09:02] that's in the man
[1:09:04] to see if it be the spirit of god or not
[1:09:08] god's given us that discernment and we
[1:09:10] do that
[1:09:11] so when peop people say don't judge me
[1:09:14] but when i'm not condemning you
[1:09:16] i'm just discerning you
[1:09:19] i'm seeing some things that i think are
[1:09:20] not quite right
[1:09:22] but i'm not going to come you know
[1:09:24] sometimes how we approach someone
[1:09:27] we think we're going to we're going to
[1:09:28] help them by maybe rebuking them a
[1:09:30] little bit but you know
[1:09:33] we have to have the right words
[1:09:36] because words can hurt
[1:09:38] and i've heard it many times where
[1:09:40] someone was trying to help somebody and
[1:09:41] they didn't have the wisdom
[1:09:44] to say the right
[1:09:46] words you've got to have the wisdom
[1:09:50] if you don't have the wisdom stay away
[1:09:51] from it you'll cause more harm than good
[1:09:54] there was a brother that said that came
[1:09:56] one time and years back and he said he
[1:09:58] was telling me how that he was from
[1:10:00] california he had this gift
[1:10:03] and he he believed he had a gift
[1:10:06] that god would show him things
[1:10:09] and he had gone to a brother and and he
[1:10:12] had
[1:10:13] said some things to
[1:10:14] him and caused that brother to get very
[1:10:17] very mad at him
[1:10:20] so he came to me and i said brother i
[1:10:22] said listen whether you have a gift or
[1:10:24] don't have a gift
[1:10:26] that's that's between you and god okay
[1:10:28] i'm not gonna say you don't
[1:10:30] i said brother but if you don't have the
[1:10:32] wisdom to handle that gift
[1:10:35] you can cause more harm than good
[1:10:39] you got to have wisdom and how you do
[1:10:41] something when you when you go and you
[1:10:42] talk to somebody
[1:10:44] because you want to help them because
[1:10:46] they're going astray maybe don't go in
[1:10:48] there with a with a haughty uh attitude
[1:10:50] or or
[1:10:52] you know you just gotta go in the right
[1:10:53] kind of spirit i think you should be
[1:10:55] praying about it you should be
[1:10:56] fasting and getting the right spirit
[1:11:00] and ask god to give you the words to
[1:11:02] speak
[1:11:03] that will help that person
[1:11:05] not go and destroy him more
[1:11:08] and i've seen that too many times
[1:11:11] when one christian wants to go and help
[1:11:12] another and doesn't have the wisdom to
[1:11:15] speak the right words
[1:11:18] do you follow me on that
[1:11:24] in first john 4 1
[1:11:28] the bible says beloved
[1:11:29] believe not every spirit
[1:11:32] but try
[1:11:33] the spirits
[1:11:35] whether they are of god
[1:11:38] because many false prophets are gone out
[1:11:40] into the world
[1:11:42] and that's what that's our job to try
[1:11:44] the spirits
[1:11:46] you have a you young people that have
[1:11:48] friends
[1:11:49] they maybe want to hang out with you try
[1:11:52] their spirits discern them
[1:11:55] if you if you have a friend you've known
[1:11:57] him for a few months or or a few years
[1:11:59] you know what he's about
[1:12:01] you you know
[1:12:02] how whether this person is is gonna be
[1:12:05] uh
[1:12:06] good for your walk with the lord or not
[1:12:08] good
[1:12:10] be careful
[1:12:11] who you walk with in school
[1:12:14] who you hang out with
[1:12:16] what friends you have who what people
[1:12:18] you hang out with where you go
[1:12:20] have deserved the spirit
[1:12:23] god's given us that discernment
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:30] and like i said i just i never have like
[1:12:32] when someone comes and tells me while
[1:12:34] someone saw a serpent leader so-and-so
[1:12:36] is this
[1:12:37] that's not my job to condemn somebody
[1:12:40] that's god's job
[1:12:42] my job is to go out after him
[1:12:45] my job is to pray for that person my job
[1:12:47] is to be concerned
[1:12:49] about their welfare
[1:12:51] about their their spiritual welfare
[1:12:54] and also the physical welfare
[1:12:57] too many times we think more of this so
[1:12:59] we're so spiritually minded we know
[1:13:00] we're no earthly good
[1:13:03] and and we don't look at a person's
[1:13:05] maybe he has a need
[1:13:07] and we don't we and we can we could help
[1:13:09] them we don't
[1:13:11] god give us the love amen
[1:13:14] that we can bless somebody else and we
[1:13:16] you know that's how god will bless us we
[1:13:18] begin to bless others
[1:13:21] and that's how god does it
[1:13:22] you know you begin to help other people
[1:13:24] and bless other people you're gonna find
[1:13:26] god's gonna start to bless you
[1:13:29] amen
[1:13:31] in first corinthians six chapters one
[1:13:33] through seven
[1:13:35] dare any of you have a matter against
[1:13:37] another
[1:13:38] go to law before the unjust and not
[1:13:40] before the saints
[1:13:42] do you not know
[1:13:43] that the saints
[1:13:44] shall judge the world
[1:13:47] the time will come and we will judge
[1:13:51] but it's not now
[1:13:53] but there will be a time we'll stand
[1:13:55] next to the king of kings and the lord
[1:13:58] of lords
[1:13:59] as a bride of jesus christ
[1:14:01] and we're going to judge he says you he
[1:14:03] says don't you know that the saints
[1:14:05] shall judge the world and if the world
[1:14:07] shall be judged by you
[1:14:10] are you unworthy to judge the smallest
[1:14:12] matters
[1:14:13] knowing not that we shall judge angels
[1:14:16] wow
[1:14:18] isn't this something
[1:14:20] the position that god's bringing us to
[1:14:23] but there's got to be character
[1:14:26] it won't happen without character
[1:14:29] brother brandon said power without
[1:14:31] character is satanic
[1:14:33] there's got to be the character of
[1:14:35] christ
[1:14:36] that love has got to be there that
[1:14:38] concern has got to be there
[1:14:40] for somebody's well-being
[1:14:44] here we we're islands
[1:14:47] you know everybody goes home and you're
[1:14:48] an island
[1:14:49] we don't look we don't look to our
[1:14:51] brother the bible says in philippians
[1:14:52] chapter 2 verse 3 he said look not every
[1:14:55] man on his own things
[1:14:56] but every man also on the things of
[1:14:58] others
[1:15:00] amen let this mind be in you which was
[1:15:02] also in christ jesus
[1:15:05] who being in the form of god platter not
[1:15:07] robbery to be equal with god
[1:15:09] and made himself a no reputation
[1:15:12] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:15:14] and was made in the likeness of man and
[1:15:16] being found in fashion as a man he what
[1:15:19] he humbled himself
[1:15:22] and became obedient
[1:15:26] unto death even the death of the cross
[1:15:29] look not every man on his own things
[1:15:30] that's what we do
[1:15:32] we tend to be just me or us for no more
[1:15:36] it's just me and my house and what about
[1:15:38] everybody else
[1:15:40] what about the needs that might be
[1:15:42] represented here in our in the church
[1:15:45] or in maybe in your neighborhood
[1:15:49] amen
[1:15:51] there's no there's no kindness anymore
[1:15:54] we should have a kindness one to another
[1:15:57] respect about it also fruits of the holy
[1:15:59] spirit
[1:16:01] love joy peace long suffering
[1:16:04] god uh
[1:16:05] goodness
[1:16:06] and and and to have kindness and and
[1:16:08] goodness and mercy and and and all these
[1:16:11] things that's the holy spirit began to
[1:16:13] flow through us
[1:16:15] as i think i've said before for this
[1:16:16] pope before there were channels of them
[1:16:19] of god's holy spirit flowing through us
[1:16:22] and and if we become a channel of of the
[1:16:25] holy spirit flowing through us and as
[1:16:28] brother branson says we can go from
[1:16:30] baptism to baptism from revelation to
[1:16:32] revelation growing always in the lord
[1:16:35] abounding in the things of god
[1:16:38] that love of of the lord in our heart
[1:16:41] towards every man
[1:16:44] believing in and and and trusting and
[1:16:47] and praying one for another
[1:16:52] know ye not that ye shall judge angels
[1:16:55] my my
[1:16:57] what character god is expecting us to
[1:17:00] have
[1:17:01] how much more things that pertain to
[1:17:03] this life
[1:17:04] if then you have judgments of things
[1:17:06] pertaining to this life set them to
[1:17:08] judge who are least esteemed in the
[1:17:11] church
[1:17:12] and that's something
[1:17:14] if there's a problem here in the church
[1:17:15] you know what they were doing they were
[1:17:17] taking each other to court
[1:17:19] brother robert didn't like he had
[1:17:21] something against me he took me to court
[1:17:23] and sued me
[1:17:24] and i'd be would be there among the
[1:17:26] unbelievers can you imagine
[1:17:29] what a show
[1:17:32] he said i speak to your shame
[1:17:35] is it so that there is that a wise man
[1:17:37] among you
[1:17:39] no not one that shall be able to judge
[1:17:42] between his brethren
[1:17:45] oh brother
[1:17:46] oh brother goethe to law with brother
[1:17:49] and that before the unbelievers
[1:17:52] i can remember a time
[1:17:55] in this message
[1:17:56] to our shame
[1:17:58] back during the time those who remember
[1:18:01] the
[1:18:02] the fight of the franchise and the
[1:18:03] copyright
[1:18:05] going on between jeffersonville and
[1:18:06] cloverdale
[1:18:08] and they got into the internet
[1:18:11] and
[1:18:12] they had those chat rooms back then and
[1:18:14] and message brothers were fighting each
[1:18:16] other in chat rooms and
[1:18:18] i mean putting out their dirty laundry
[1:18:21] for the whole world to see
[1:18:23] brother brandon said we fight in the
[1:18:24] backyard
[1:18:26] but when we stand in the front yard we
[1:18:28] stand shoulder to shoulder
[1:18:31] whatever happened to that
[1:18:34] we're bringing our fight to the front
[1:18:36] yard
[1:18:37] and letting everybody see
[1:18:39] what a shame that was to our shame
[1:18:42] and and the church of tennessee got
[1:18:44] involved and
[1:18:45] and i heard some of the messages were
[1:18:47] preached
[1:18:48] and i it was just to me that the i mean
[1:18:50] slamming the branham family and i mean
[1:18:53] horribly
[1:18:55] and i remember that and i thought this
[1:18:57] is to our shame why are we doing this
[1:19:02] now there for
[1:19:03] there is utterly a fault among you
[1:19:06] because he go to law with one another
[1:19:08] why do you not rather take wrong
[1:19:12] someone wrongs you
[1:19:14] why don't you just take the wrong
[1:19:16] come on
[1:19:18] why do ye not rather suffer yourselves
[1:19:21] to be defrauded
[1:19:24] think about that
[1:19:26] the bible says once when they ask you i
[1:19:29] can't remember the scripture exactly but
[1:19:31] they ask you for a quote give me your
[1:19:32] cloak also
[1:19:33] when you give it to him don't expect it
[1:19:35] back
[1:19:38] and there are people that are going to
[1:19:39] do it they're going to take advantage
[1:19:41] and there are people that will do that
[1:19:44] but
[1:19:45] where do we stand in where is our heart
[1:19:47] in all of this
[1:19:52] wouldn't you rather suffer to be
[1:19:53] defrauded
[1:19:56] i remember some years back when i
[1:19:57] retired from the company i worked for 32
[1:19:59] years
[1:20:01] and uh
[1:20:02] i'm going to be closed in a few minutes
[1:20:04] and
[1:20:06] and they owed me some back pay
[1:20:08] on vacation
[1:20:10] and the manager the lady she didn't like
[1:20:12] me for some reason i don't know why but
[1:20:13] she came back and and she said that i
[1:20:16] didn't have that much back pay and they
[1:20:18] cheated me out of
[1:20:20] several thousand dollars
[1:20:22] and uh
[1:20:24] so
[1:20:25] i left it alone i didn't fight it
[1:20:28] uh i said okay all right forget it uh i
[1:20:30] just walked away
[1:20:32] and
[1:20:33] that lady went on vacation a few about a
[1:20:35] week later after i retired
[1:20:37] and the general manager he was a pretty
[1:20:39] nice guy he had somebody else look into
[1:20:41] it and they said oh we do owe him this
[1:20:43] we owe him at least 1300
[1:20:45] so
[1:20:46] they said they sent me he called me up
[1:20:47] we're gonna send you a check for
[1:20:48] thirteen hundred dollars well i'll take
[1:20:50] that's fine
[1:20:51] it was more on that but that's fine so
[1:20:54] they did
[1:20:55] and
[1:20:56] when that lady came back from the she
[1:20:58] was the office manager and she just she
[1:21:01] saw she was calling me sending me
[1:21:03] letters
[1:21:04] sent the money back so finally
[1:21:06] and i didn't spend the money i thought i
[1:21:08] had a feeling about it so i just put it
[1:21:10] away
[1:21:11] and uh
[1:21:12] remember i wrote a check for the exact
[1:21:14] amount
[1:21:16] and i i sent a letter and i sent it to
[1:21:17] the general manager
[1:21:19] and i told him i said you know
[1:21:21] you guys
[1:21:22] i was cheated here cheated here and this
[1:21:24] happened and there was this pension that
[1:21:26] i had that they took that away and this
[1:21:28] happened this other happened i said okay
[1:21:30] that's fine i said but you know now you
[1:21:32] want this money back here it is to the
[1:21:34] penny i said i would rather be defrauded
[1:21:37] than to defraud somebody else that's my
[1:21:39] christian
[1:21:41] belief that i have i wrote it in the
[1:21:43] letter i said i'd rather be defrauded
[1:21:46] than to defraud somebody else
[1:21:48] and i sent the money back
[1:21:50] and i said tell the lady that
[1:21:52] i consider the matter closed
[1:21:54] and so and that's that's what we should
[1:21:56] be
[1:21:58] you know that if somebody is going to
[1:21:59] take something from us
[1:22:01] let him let him defraud us and just
[1:22:03] bring it to the lord
[1:22:04] you know it's in your hands lord
[1:22:06] you know you know what god says about
[1:22:08] that
[1:22:09] he says vengeance is mine saith the lord
[1:22:12] and and we just and what our problem is
[1:22:14] we try to take care of ourselves and god
[1:22:17] just steps back and says okay all right
[1:22:19] boy you go handle it
[1:22:21] but if we give it to god in the right
[1:22:24] way and have the right
[1:22:25] the right spirit
[1:22:27] about the thing
[1:22:29] and have have our heart in the right
[1:22:30] place
[1:22:32] i believe god will turn that into a
[1:22:33] blessing
[1:22:35] whatever it may be
[1:22:37] our life will be blessed
[1:22:40] he'll bless you in other ways
[1:22:43] you couldn't even
[1:22:44] he'll open up windows of blessing for
[1:22:46] you
[1:22:47] but we got to have the right spirit
[1:22:50] we got to have the right heart that's
[1:22:52] what brother bran would say he would say
[1:22:53] i'd rather have the right spirit and the
[1:22:56] wrong doctrine
[1:22:58] than to have the right doctrine in the
[1:23:00] right spirit
[1:23:04] i was talking about aaron here a few
[1:23:06] moments ago before the service and
[1:23:09] and you know it's like when you're a
[1:23:11] pastor
[1:23:12] it's just like
[1:23:13] and i've i've been a pastor for 11 years
[1:23:15] now and
[1:23:16] it's like you got a target on your back
[1:23:19] and through the years i've been hurt
[1:23:21] many times
[1:23:22] by people
[1:23:24] and
[1:23:25] in different ways
[1:23:27] and i've just taken it
[1:23:29] and when next time i see them they walk
[1:23:30] into the church god bless you brother
[1:23:32] it's good to see you come and welcome
[1:23:34] you're going to sing a song once you
[1:23:36] play the guitar wouldn't you do that and
[1:23:38] i just i just opened the church for them
[1:23:40] now i realize i can see brother green
[1:23:42] doing the same thing and i learned from
[1:23:43] him
[1:23:46] and you know something there's nothing
[1:23:47] in my heart against them yeah
[1:23:50] they they and they've hurt me i've been
[1:23:52] hurt many times
[1:23:54] and and and you have a target in your
[1:23:56] back
[1:23:58] and that's what it is
[1:23:59] you're a burden bearer that's what
[1:24:02] pastors do
[1:24:04] they they they got to be strong
[1:24:06] and they need the prayers of the people
[1:24:08] to keep them up because because they're
[1:24:10] human
[1:24:12] pastors are human
[1:24:14] and it becomes a target and we have to
[1:24:17] be careful about that
[1:24:19] because if if our spirit is wrong
[1:24:23] it's going to lead us down it's going to
[1:24:24] lead us astray
[1:24:25] we got to keep our heart right with god
[1:24:28] you might have your doctrine right on
[1:24:29] but if you're wrong in your spirit
[1:24:31] you're never going to be there
[1:24:33] brother bran said without that perfect
[1:24:34] love you'll never make it
[1:24:36] we need that perfect love to be there
[1:24:39] john saw everything up to the end he saw
[1:24:42] he saw the the end of the world he saw
[1:24:45] the seven church changes being played
[1:24:47] out amen he saw
[1:24:49] all these things clear into the in into
[1:24:52] the judgment day
[1:24:53] and passed into the eighth eternal day
[1:24:56] god opened up he was he opened up such
[1:24:59] mysteries to john
[1:25:02] when he was on that aisle
[1:25:04] and when he comes back read first john
[1:25:06] ii john what is he saying
[1:25:09] little children
[1:25:11] love one another
[1:25:13] if you say you love your
[1:25:15] love god hate your brother
[1:25:18] truth is not in you
[1:25:20] you think that is so simple
[1:25:22] that is so so simple
[1:25:24] but that's where the great revelation is
[1:25:26] at
[1:25:28] when you can attain that and a love
[1:25:31] and have that patience and that love to
[1:25:34] love your brothers and your sisters and
[1:25:37] to respect one another
[1:25:40] amen
[1:25:41] then you're then you're you're becoming
[1:25:43] a spirit a very
[1:25:45] very spiritual person
[1:25:48] not because you understand the greek and
[1:25:50] you understand this and everything
[1:25:52] brother brown said about the seventh
[1:25:53] seal and
[1:25:55] god's gonna bring those things to pass
[1:25:57] in our life just believe god
[1:26:00] he'll bring it to pass in your life
[1:26:02] he brother brandon said take care of the
[1:26:04] small thing didn't he say that brother
[1:26:06] take care of the little things in your
[1:26:08] life
[1:26:09] and god will take care of the big things
[1:26:12] you believe that this evening
[1:26:14] amen
[1:26:17] so we must examine ourselves
[1:26:21] through the mirror of god's word there
[1:26:22] in james 1 22 says but be
[1:26:25] doers of the word and not hearers only
[1:26:28] deceiving your own selves for if any be
[1:26:31] a hearer of the word and not a doer he
[1:26:34] is like unto a man beholding his natural
[1:26:38] face in the glass a mirror
[1:26:40] if you will
[1:26:41] for he behold himself and go with his
[1:26:43] way and straightway forgetteth what
[1:26:46] manner of man he was he forgot how he
[1:26:47] looked forgot the big nose he had
[1:26:51] amen or that he was bald or or or he had
[1:26:54] blue hair or green hair or who knows
[1:26:56] what
[1:26:58] he forgets how why he looked
[1:27:00] but who so looketh into the perfect law
[1:27:02] of liberty
[1:27:04] and continue with therein
[1:27:06] he being not a forgetful hero but a doer
[1:27:09] of the work this man shall be blessed in
[1:27:11] his deed so we must examine ourselves
[1:27:14] that word is a mirror
[1:27:17] the word that we that we look at is we
[1:27:20] should look at it as a mirror to see
[1:27:22] ourselves do we see ourselves
[1:27:24] in that word
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:31] how do we see ourselves how do we do
[1:27:33] that
[1:27:34] in first corinthians 11 27 jesus was
[1:27:37] giving the lord's supper to the
[1:27:38] disciples
[1:27:39] there in verse 27 of chapter 11 of first
[1:27:42] corinthians corinthians wherefore
[1:27:45] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:27:47] this cup of the lord unworthily shall be
[1:27:49] guilty of the body and blood of the lord
[1:27:52] but let a man
[1:27:54] examine himself
[1:27:58] and so let him eat of that bread
[1:28:00] and drink of that cup
[1:28:02] so what is the lord telling us we
[1:28:04] examine ourselves
[1:28:06] if we're going to judge somebody
[1:28:09] we judge ourselves
[1:28:11] if i'm going to judge anybody in this
[1:28:13] room i need to judge me
[1:28:16] you need to judge yourself
[1:28:18] he said but let a man examine himself to
[1:28:21] see if he's worthy
[1:28:23] when you take the lord's supper you
[1:28:25] examine yourself lord am i worthy
[1:28:30] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:28:31] with that cup for he that eateth and
[1:28:33] drinketh unworthily
[1:28:36] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:28:39] not
[1:28:40] discerning
[1:28:42] the lord's body
[1:28:46] think about that
[1:28:48] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:28:50] among you
[1:28:51] that's why churches fail i believe
[1:28:54] that's why we fail as christians that's
[1:28:56] why god doesn't answer our prayers
[1:28:57] sometimes
[1:28:59] he says in many sleep i think brother
[1:29:01] brown said
[1:29:02] spiritually did
[1:29:05] for if we would judge ourselves
[1:29:09] we should not be judged
[1:29:12] talking about that great date of the
[1:29:14] judgment
[1:29:15] if we should judge ourselves
[1:29:18] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:29:20] of the lord
[1:29:22] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:29:24] world
[1:29:25] amen
[1:29:26] that's what the bible says don't think
[1:29:28] it's strange when
[1:29:29] when the trials and tribulations and oh
[1:29:32] you're trying to fire don't think of
[1:29:35] strange gods he's chastening you amen
[1:29:39] there's going to be character come out
[1:29:41] of that
[1:29:42] oh but it hurts let me tell you
[1:29:45] nobody wants to go through that
[1:29:47] god brings us through anyhow
[1:29:50] amen
[1:29:51] second corinthians 13 5 examine
[1:29:53] yourselves
[1:29:55] whether you be in the faith
[1:29:58] judge yourself
[1:30:00] look at your look into the mirror
[1:30:04] look into the word that's what the word
[1:30:05] comes for
[1:30:09] with the eb of the faith prove your own
[1:30:11] selves
[1:30:14] know ye not your own selves
[1:30:17] too many times we're hearing the word
[1:30:19] maybe brother aaron's preaching here and
[1:30:21] maybe he's applying a little pentecostal
[1:30:24] spanking as you would say
[1:30:26] and you may be sitting there and
[1:30:28] and uh
[1:30:29] brother jordan would say well that's got
[1:30:31] to be for brother robert
[1:30:33] are going that that's for him yeah and
[1:30:35] brother robert charcoal saying oh that's
[1:30:37] for brother son so
[1:30:39] amen
[1:30:40] no no apply it to yourself
[1:30:43] don't worry about the other the other
[1:30:44] ones
[1:30:45] but judge yourself look into the mirror
[1:30:49] of god's word
[1:30:50] as the word comes forth
[1:30:52] no ye not your own cells
[1:30:55] the preacher don't know you
[1:30:57] even your own wife don't know you your
[1:30:59] own husband
[1:31:01] amen the thoughts are way deep inside of
[1:31:04] you
[1:31:05] only you know and god knows
[1:31:08] is that right
[1:31:11] those very secret things that we have
[1:31:13] only that are that we know and god knows
[1:31:16] he says don't you know yourselves
[1:31:18] examine yourselves whether you be in the
[1:31:20] faith
[1:31:21] prove your own selves
[1:31:24] don't know ye not your own selves
[1:31:26] how that jesus christ is in you
[1:31:29] except you be reprobates
[1:31:32] my my
[1:31:35] in recognizing your day in this message
[1:31:37] in 64
[1:31:38] brother bran says what to do what was it
[1:31:40] to do and this was to bring forth two
[1:31:43] witnesses moses and elias prophets which
[1:31:46] the jews only believe their prophets and
[1:31:49] they'll come forth with a sign of the
[1:31:51] prophets and their work will be that of
[1:31:53] the prophet for they did exactly showing
[1:31:56] one thing that man when you die or
[1:31:59] whatever when you leave this world your
[1:32:02] nature doesn't change
[1:32:05] your if you're a liar now you'll be a
[1:32:08] liar there
[1:32:09] if you're hot-headed here you'll be
[1:32:12] hot-headed there
[1:32:13] if you're a doubter here you'll be a
[1:32:16] doubter there
[1:32:18] men and women it's time to shake
[1:32:20] ourselves and to examine ourselves
[1:32:24] know ye not yourself
[1:32:27] examine ourselves and see where we are
[1:32:30] standing
[1:32:31] for death does not change it
[1:32:34] you think wow when i'm when i die and go
[1:32:36] to heaven god's gonna take my temper
[1:32:38] away god's gonna take this away from me
[1:32:40] oh
[1:32:42] you're gonna you're gonna remain what
[1:32:43] you are that's your character
[1:32:45] brother man said that's the only thing
[1:32:46] you'll take with you is your character
[1:32:49] what you are here on earth examine
[1:32:51] yourself look into the word into the
[1:32:54] mirror of god's word and say lord let me
[1:32:56] let me let me line up with your word
[1:32:58] lord and that's where the word the word
[1:33:00] the bible says is always this is a sword
[1:33:03] it's slack into a two-edged sword
[1:33:05] it cuts coming and going
[1:33:09] and paul talks about the minister he
[1:33:11] says you better fear him
[1:33:13] he'll carry that sword just for anything
[1:33:16] the minister carried the word of god the
[1:33:18] swoosh is a sword
[1:33:21] it's a it's it cuts coming and going
[1:33:24] and if you get cut you better have
[1:33:26] enough holy spirit in you to allow that
[1:33:28] to make you a better christian
[1:33:31] and now walk out of here all bitter
[1:33:33] hating the pastor because he said
[1:33:35] something that maybe cuts you a little
[1:33:37] bit
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:40] let's be humble let's let us be humble
[1:33:42] before the lord let the holy spirit
[1:33:44] begin to move in our hearts
[1:33:47] that when the word comes and it finds
[1:33:48] something there god's gonna let you know
[1:33:51] guys god's gonna bring that minister
[1:33:52] without him knowing anything
[1:33:54] to say something
[1:33:56] that should wake you up look into the
[1:33:57] mirror of god's word
[1:34:03] he says death doesn't do nothing to a
[1:34:05] man
[1:34:06] but change his dwelling place
[1:34:09] doesn't change your nature
[1:34:11] doesn't change your faith
[1:34:14] doesn't change nothing in you
[1:34:16] but your dwelling please
[1:34:19] change is oh god
[1:34:21] amen
[1:34:23] to be like jesus
[1:34:25] to be like jesus on earth i long
[1:34:28] to be like him
[1:34:31] in redemption by judgment
[1:34:34] he says now in 54 says now when he left
[1:34:37] when he loved adam and eve so that he
[1:34:39] had to first shed blood before he could
[1:34:42] the judgment was death now we're talking
[1:34:45] about judgment and judging
[1:34:47] and he had something had to die in their
[1:34:49] stead
[1:34:50] and when they could stand then in his
[1:34:52] presence
[1:34:54] now in there was judgment
[1:34:56] he first listened to satan and he
[1:34:59] whitewashed the word over
[1:35:01] and they disbelieved the word and the
[1:35:03] word then became god's judgment
[1:35:06] now this word
[1:35:07] the word of god will judge every person
[1:35:12] this word that's being preached here he
[1:35:15] says this morning i'll say this evening
[1:35:18] is being preached down there at wall
[1:35:20] street preached over there in the
[1:35:21] christian church down at the
[1:35:22] presbyterian church wherever the word is
[1:35:25] being preached it becomes the judgment
[1:35:29] men are judged by the word of god and
[1:35:32] there's one good thing to know
[1:35:34] that we either
[1:35:35] our judgment goes before us
[1:35:38] or it will follow after us
[1:35:41] oh my
[1:35:43] that's scary
[1:35:45] either the judgment goes before you
[1:35:47] or it'll follow after you
[1:35:50] and we'll stand there in that day
[1:35:52] you know there'll be no mercy it's going
[1:35:54] to be
[1:35:54] judgment i hear the prophet of god say
[1:35:57] i'll tell you again lord i don't want
[1:35:59] your judgment lord
[1:36:00] i want your mercy
[1:36:02] amen first peter 4 17
[1:36:05] almost a closing this evening
[1:36:07] first peter 4 17 for the time has come
[1:36:11] that judgment
[1:36:12] must begin
[1:36:14] at the house of god
[1:36:16] and if it first began at us
[1:36:19] what shall be
[1:36:21] the end of them that obey not the gospel
[1:36:24] of god
[1:36:26] and he goes on and says
[1:36:27] that the righteous
[1:36:29] scarcely
[1:36:31] well there what does that mean just make
[1:36:33] it by the skin of our teeth
[1:36:36] brother brad said we hang by a string or
[1:36:38] something like that
[1:36:39] over the flames of hell
[1:36:42] but it's a mercy of god that holds us
[1:36:46] if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:36:49] where will the
[1:36:50] ungodly and the sinner appear
[1:36:54] if we're being judged tonight
[1:36:57] and you take that word
[1:36:59] don't look at the man
[1:37:01] take your eyes off the flesh
[1:37:04] because we all fail
[1:37:07] we we are frail
[1:37:09] we're weak
[1:37:11] i'm talking about us ministers
[1:37:13] don't look at the man don't look at the
[1:37:15] flesh
[1:37:16] look at the word that's coming
[1:37:19] there's something about the word for the
[1:37:21] word of god is quick it's alive
[1:37:24] powerful
[1:37:25] sharper than any twitch sword
[1:37:29] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:37:32] soul and spirit and the joints and
[1:37:34] marrow and is a discerner
[1:37:37] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:37:39] heart
[1:37:39] something about that word of god
[1:37:42] don't look at the man
[1:37:44] say lord
[1:37:46] take brother aaron or where it might be
[1:37:48] standing behind this pulpit
[1:37:50] lord speak to my heart
[1:37:52] if you come hungry god's going to feel
[1:37:54] you
[1:37:56] you come expecting god's going to do
[1:37:58] something in your life
[1:38:00] it's what you there's a
[1:38:02] sermon one day i want to bring one day
[1:38:04] it's about
[1:38:05] investments it's what you invest
[1:38:09] i asked the church one day what did you
[1:38:11] invest this morning
[1:38:13] how many of you how many of you fasted
[1:38:15] yesterday how many were in prayer last
[1:38:17] night
[1:38:18] how many got up early this morning with
[1:38:20] the sun and before the sun came up and
[1:38:22] got on your knees before god praying
[1:38:24] because you were going to come to church
[1:38:27] and the king of kings was going to come
[1:38:29] and meet with you
[1:38:31] where was your expectation where what
[1:38:33] was your investment what did you invest
[1:38:37] you come in you go out you're going to
[1:38:39] go out either a better christian or
[1:38:40] you're going to believe worse
[1:38:43] it depends on what what price you're
[1:38:45] willing to pay in your own life
[1:38:48] amen regardless who stands behind this
[1:38:51] pulpit god if god can make a make a mule
[1:38:54] or an ass to speak to a prophet
[1:38:57] he can surely use a man of god
[1:39:00] who's laying in the presence of god
[1:39:02] studying the word
[1:39:04] the bible says study to the ministers
[1:39:08] to show thy sword thyself uh uh how's it
[1:39:10] goal brother study
[1:39:12] to show thyself
[1:39:17] approved of god a workman that needeth
[1:39:20] not to be ashamed
[1:39:22] there's something about i'm not talking
[1:39:23] about a button pusher i'm talking about
[1:39:26] a man of god that stands he's studying
[1:39:27] the word he's in the word of god
[1:39:30] he the bible says that the elders those
[1:39:32] are pastors are worthy of double honor
[1:39:36] especially they that labor in the word
[1:39:39] and doctrine
[1:39:41] you see there's something about a man
[1:39:43] that brother bran says he should be
[1:39:45] laying in the presence of jehovah of god
[1:39:48] before he steps behind the pulpit and
[1:39:50] but if you if you're not preparing
[1:39:52] yourself what good will it do
[1:39:56] we all have to play a part in this we
[1:39:58] all have an investment to make
[1:40:01] amen if the musicians will come tonight
[1:40:07] so if we're to judge anyone
[1:40:11] judge anyone harshly
[1:40:13] it's ourselves
[1:40:18] in awakening jesus in 63
[1:40:21] make me more like you
[1:40:28] he says always judge
[1:40:31] not after emotion brother brown says
[1:40:34] judge after the word
[1:40:37] it's got to be the word
[1:40:39] now watch the word and what the word
[1:40:41] says
[1:40:42] then no that's right because god said
[1:40:45] that
[1:40:46] that makes it right
[1:40:49] the word of god
[1:40:51] when we stand here we
[1:40:54] bring up bring the word whatever god has
[1:40:56] placed in our hand in our hearts
[1:40:58] many times
[1:41:00] i have my notes but
[1:41:01] god will take me in different directions
[1:41:04] i know both aaron attends to this as
[1:41:05] well
[1:41:06] and we don't know
[1:41:08] but he's dealing with hearts of people
[1:41:11] that have needs
[1:41:13] and if you come with the right attitude
[1:41:16] and don't look at the man don't look at
[1:41:18] the flesh
[1:41:19] there's a it's a veil
[1:41:23] that was our problem back there with
[1:41:24] jesus all they could see was the flesh
[1:41:28] but god was veiled
[1:41:31] think of it god was veiled behind flesh
[1:41:34] and this evening and behind this pulpit
[1:41:38] is god again veiled behind flesh
[1:41:43] when you see one another it's god veil
[1:41:45] behind flesh
[1:41:47] amen what respect we ought to have one
[1:41:49] for another
[1:41:51] loving one another
[1:41:53] respecting one another highly
[1:41:56] don't let a word come out of your mouth
[1:41:58] against anyone
[1:42:00] you know that's a that's whenever if i
[1:42:02] speak say something like that about
[1:42:04] somebody immediately i feel
[1:42:06] i feel myself like like god has just
[1:42:09] drawn away from me
[1:42:11] you feel that way
[1:42:13] you ever get around someone all they
[1:42:15] want to do is talk about everybody you
[1:42:17] know what it does it drains you
[1:42:20] you walk out of there feeling drained
[1:42:22] and you don't even know why
[1:42:24] it's a spirit friends
[1:42:26] be careful of that
[1:42:29] keep your heart clean
[1:42:30] before god
[1:42:32] don't judge don't condemn anybody don't
[1:42:34] ever let words come out of your mouth
[1:42:37] to put somebody down
[1:42:39] [Music]
[1:42:40] instead get on your knees
[1:42:43] and say lord help that one
[1:42:45] let it be your mercy and grace
[1:42:48] i know he's going she's going through
[1:42:49] things lord
[1:42:52] we want to be like
[1:42:54] jesus i want to have that spirit
[1:42:58] what kind of spirit did he have
[1:42:59] [Music]

[1:43:04] you have heard that it had been said
[1:43:06] thou shalt love thy neighbor hate
[1:43:10] this enemy

[1:43:28] and pray
[1:43:29] for them

[1:43:46] pray for them
[1:43:49] to despitefully use you and persecute
[1:43:52] you
[1:43:53] that you might be the children of your
[1:43:55] father which is in heaven
[1:43:58] for he maketh his his son to rise
[1:44:03] on the evil
[1:44:04] and on the good
[1:44:06] and sendeth rain on the just and the
[1:44:08] unjust

[1:48:22] as brother robert was ministering there
[1:48:24] and i
[1:48:26] remember something from brother green's
[1:48:27] testimony when him and brother branham
[1:48:29] were coming
[1:48:30] back they got up to the flagstaff there
[1:48:33] i-40
[1:48:35] and brother brim had been telling
[1:48:36] brother green some things about some of
[1:48:38] the brothers what they had been doing
[1:48:41] and brother brown tells brother again
[1:48:43] well he says if we had some time we'd go
[1:48:44] over and visit minister for them brother
[1:48:48] green looks at him and he says what
[1:48:52] he says
[1:48:53] you just finished telling me
[1:48:56] everything they've done wrong
[1:48:58] and he said he says brother green he
[1:49:00] says i'm bloodbathing towns he goes
[1:49:03] i'm embarrassed by you that you know why
[1:49:05] you would think that way
[1:49:07] he goes just because they're that
[1:49:08] they're not that doesn't make them not
[1:49:10] my brothers
[1:49:12] i'd go do that
[1:49:15] if he came to save us when we were
[1:49:17] perfect we wouldn't need to save it
[1:49:20] but he came because we needed him
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:23] i was in the office one day
[1:49:26] with brother green
[1:49:28] and a brother came in and i knew the
[1:49:30] brother and he asked brother green for
[1:49:31] some things
[1:49:33] and i knew how this brother acted and
[1:49:35] brother green gave him to him to all
[1:49:37] so after he left i told brother green i
[1:49:39] said this man
[1:49:41] told you a story
[1:49:42] he's not going to do because this is how
[1:49:44] he does and he goes brother aaron
[1:49:46] i'm commanded to give
[1:49:49] so i did what god asked me to do
[1:49:51] now let god take care of the other part
[1:49:56] maybe some of you i don't know
[1:49:58] a long time ago sitting here brother
[1:50:00] brother green was preaching
[1:50:02] and my brother kept shouting amen in the
[1:50:05] middle of the preaching brother green
[1:50:06] stops and he calls the brother out
[1:50:09] he said you're saying amen to the word
[1:50:11] but you haven't kept your word
[1:50:14] and they got into a verbal tassel here
[1:50:17] and he asked the deacons to take the
[1:50:18] brother out and the brother was
[1:50:20] saying things
[1:50:22] so brother green asked the congregation
[1:50:24] to leave he i don't want the
[1:50:26] congregation to get that spirit
[1:50:27] [Music]
[1:50:30] and then about six months to a year the
[1:50:31] brother comes back and brother green
[1:50:33] calls him up to pray
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:35] so i went to brother greene after and i
[1:50:37] said i don't understand why you did that
[1:50:39] don't you remember what happened he goes
[1:50:41] that's how you keep

[1:52:36] he talks about this he said you know
[1:52:38] when you confess it
[1:52:40] and you make it right with god
[1:52:42] he puts it through the blood and there's
[1:52:44] no evidence of it anymore
[1:52:47] and you bring it up and you say lord
[1:52:49] i've done it again he said you've done
[1:52:50] what
