[49:56] Amen at that first part of the last
[50:00] verse up for the Jeremy where the
[50:02] doubters will be missing altogether had
[50:06] someone talking to me earlier this week
[50:08] and made a comment about the number of
[50:11] firefighters up on the mountain fighting
[50:13] the fire he said I heard there was 900
[50:15] firefighters but I don't know if that's
[50:17] true or not I thought and we've really
[50:20] gotten to a place in our society where
[50:21] we can't even trust the facts anymore
[50:25] we're just we question everything we're
[50:27] not sure what's right I mean it's not
[50:28] anything you know it's just the way
[50:31] we've gotten as a society is amazing
[50:34] something as factual as the number of
[50:36] something we can't even know if we're
[50:38] right on you know we've done that that
[50:41] point where we get to the doubters and
[50:42] then there's the grumblers you know it's
[50:45] hard sometimes I take criticism pretty
[50:48] hard come and say something to me I kind
[50:53] of take it a bit hard the Denis McGarry
[50:55] he told me a while back a lot about a
[50:58] month ago he said you know you shouldn't
[51:00] let anything that anybody criticize you
[51:03] stop you from doing what's right started
[51:06] thinking about that I said I guess
[51:07] that's true I should shouldn't let that
[51:09] bother me so much but there will be no
[51:12] grumblers and there'll be no doubters
[51:13] right all be believers we'll all be
[51:16] thankful will be all grateful and just
[51:19] appreciative what God's done in our
[51:21] lives
[51:21] amen amen want to believe him amen amen
[51:26] you just want to play only believe all
[51:28] things are possible just have a few
[51:30] requests turned in this evening ask
[51:34] brother Baggett if you would just come
[51:37] this evening just talk to the Lord on
[51:39] our behalf to pray with him as he
[51:42] leads us in prayer that lord meet every
[51:45] need
[51:46] amen prayer request prayer prayer from
[51:53] brother Aaron Guetta he said her for my
[51:55] sister-in-law Elizabeth get it asks
[51:58] prayer concerning her job status her
[52:00] boss quit and Elizabeth does not know if
[52:02] her job is safe
[52:03] remember that request in prayer no I had
[52:09] a phrase along this line I was thinking
[52:11] about giving this evening and I didn't
[52:12] even see this note here until I just
[52:15] read it to you all so I guess I'll give
[52:16] lord praise for this you can take care
[52:20] of every job and no back in the
[52:22] beginning of this whole time we've been
[52:24] in idle a our whole team off hourly
[52:28] people in the next day they laid
[52:30] officially laid all of us leadership off
[52:33] and they came back to a few of us so
[52:37] we'll give you a base salary for rolling
[52:39] 30 days until we know kind of where
[52:41] we're at so the Lord's provided the last
[52:43] few months haven't had to worry about
[52:46] too much even with attempting to sell
[52:49] the other house having two mortgages and
[52:51] everything the Lord's provided our needs
[52:53] that's what he promises he'll provide
[52:55] our needs had heaven kerime if some
[53:00] people came over the house about a month
[53:02] and a half two months ago for dinner
[53:05] after just came for dinner or just time
[53:07] of fellowship after a Sunday morning
[53:09] service Kevin Carey and brother Matthew
[53:12] Paden were there we got to talking about
[53:14] government jobs
[53:15] I went looked online at the USA gov John
[53:19] or whatever it is started looking at him
[53:22] and out of all the jobs you know you can
[53:24] filter different departments and so I
[53:26] just kind of filtered it all down to the
[53:28] departments I thought would be
[53:29] interesting to work I've done this many
[53:31] number of times throughout the years
[53:33] never really found anything that was
[53:35] either I thought I qualified for was
[53:38] something that would be a match there's
[53:41] this one job out of like 37 jobs that I
[53:43] kind of narrowed down to you that just
[53:44] the description job description I felt
[53:46] like it's really a perfect match well I
[53:49] could apply but I don't know they don't
[53:51] work for the government for the rest of
[53:53] my life or whatever you know I applied
[53:56] the last few hours that the job was open
[53:58] kind of forgot about it it's really the
[54:01] only job I probably took serious as far
[54:04] as a job that would be more significant
[54:06] I got a part-time job during all of this
[54:09] working in Office Depot but hadn't
[54:11] really done anything beyond that just
[54:13] felt like the Lord is providing her
[54:14] needs busy with a lot of things so it
[54:16] never really we took a road recive
[54:19] approach to it
[54:20] anyway a few weeks ago they reached out
[54:23] to me for an interview and so I did the
[54:25] first interview in the second interview
[54:26] and they said I wasn't the final final
[54:29] steps and they there's a few little
[54:33] issues with different things with the
[54:34] homeschooling part but they gave me a
[54:38] job offer today about eight thousand
[54:40] nine thousand dollars more than I had
[54:42] asked for so accept it this afternoon
[54:46] and so we'll just see where the Lord
[54:48] takes it but you know for the federal
[54:51] courthouse here in Tucson and I think
[54:54] you know the Lord has his his hand in
[54:56] everything and for not really probably
[54:58] saying giving it much thought about
[55:01] exactly where to go you know maybe not
[55:03] worrying about it like I probably maybe
[55:05] should or take serious responsibility I
[55:07] don't want to say that I didn't have any
[55:09] driver motivation but I felt like the
[55:11] Lord was providing our needs and I
[55:13] didn't have a clear direction but just
[55:15] to just go right into something like
[55:17] that the Lord Lord can guide the foot
[55:19] steps for each one he knows what we have
[55:23] need of it will just guide us through
[55:24] every situation so I just want to praise
[55:27] the Lord for that and
[55:29] thanks brother Aaron said that a lot o
[55:32] brothers the ones that come from wmo
[55:35] their grandma passed away I guess this
[55:38] week I just want to remember them to
[55:40] prayer also sister Yarborough sent me a
[55:43] request right before service to pull
[55:46] this up have it up here
[55:49] she said request here she said sister
[55:55] Jill mcGarry's father in law which for
[55:57] the Bobby McGarry or the Bobby just have
[55:59] lost his life sorry
[56:01] no the Bobby mcGarry's wife just passed
[56:03] on just of heart failure but this is
[56:07] brother Robert mcGarry's dad he is in
[56:10] the hospital with kovat they say he has
[56:13] pneumonia as well or the Robert is also
[56:15] where the Robert also has Co bed has
[56:17] been sick for over a week he's staying
[56:20] in his father's house when the Robert is
[56:22] and sister Jill is taking care of
[56:23] Jeffrey so they're hoping that Jeffrey
[56:27] doesn't get the virus just ask that we
[56:30] pray for the Lord's the will the mind
[56:32] protection and healing so let's just
[56:34] remember that request prayer and I know
[56:36] there's a number of other people think
[56:38] up there I think my brother-in-law might
[56:40] have gotten it as well as my
[56:41] sister-in-law so remember the ones the
[56:45] Saints around that may be dealing with
[56:47] different ones we've got sickness with
[56:51] the Lord can protect us from everything

[57:28] to him that was bad or what girl or just
[57:30] kept him through that and brought into a

[1:05:57] while you're standing let's just read
[1:06:00] that first scripture in Ephesians where
[1:06:07] in Ephesians 3:14 and 15 this evening if
[1:06:15] I would have title this tonight I would
[1:06:17] say seen yourself through God's eyes
[1:06:21] seeing what the Word of God says about
[1:06:23] you and taking for this cause I bow my
[1:06:27] knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:06:30] Christ of whom the whole family in
[1:06:32] heaven and earth is named Amen you put
[1:06:36] yourself in it amen praise God you may
[1:06:39] be seated self from whom the whole
[1:06:42] family in heaven and earth isn't brother
[1:06:48] Matt asked me with him at Watkins to
[1:06:51] announce that he would be here with us
[1:06:52] this coming weekend brother Darrell Ward
[1:06:55] has felt that he should stay away a
[1:06:57] little little longer just to be safe
[1:06:59] though with a possibility that sister
[1:07:02] Rachel would come with him he wasn't
[1:07:03] sure if that was gonna work but he was
[1:07:06] planning to be here spoke with brother
[1:07:09] Dennis for a few minutes on Monday made
[1:07:13] it home safely and I asked him how did
[1:07:16] it go home he said it was good I I went
[1:07:18] to the car and my wife was getting in
[1:07:20] the back seat and I said no you're
[1:07:21] driving and I'm going in the back seat
[1:07:24] he said I fell asleep and when I woke up
[1:07:27] we were all
[1:07:29] yeah I remember one time coming home
[1:07:34] when the girls were young and those have
[1:07:37] you been and while remember the
[1:07:38] fellowship meetings if they would have
[1:07:39] here and then Phoenix and Flagstaff and
[1:07:43] one in Flagstaff was usually at the end
[1:07:44] of July early August we all decided to
[1:07:48] go up there one time when the girls were
[1:07:50] little we left early
[1:07:51] about 6:00 in the morning and we went
[1:07:52] through Sedona and did that if that
[1:07:55] whole trip up there and I drove all the
[1:07:57] way up there and then we had this
[1:07:58] service at 2:00 and then finished around
[1:08:01] 4:30 and maybe five o'clock and they
[1:08:04] invited us out to eat so we all went out
[1:08:06] tweets it was about 7:00 when we started
[1:08:09] heading home and in those younger days
[1:08:12] that wasn't too hard to do so we drove
[1:08:16] the the girls pretty well all fell
[1:08:18] asleep and eventually my wife did too
[1:08:21] and we're driving home and we were just
[1:08:25] about home we were about Red Rock or so
[1:08:27] maybe Picacho Peak hitting home and I
[1:08:31] decided to wake her up
[1:08:33] I said honey start waking yourself up
[1:08:36] I'm getting really really tired you're
[1:08:38] gonna have to finish the drive home we
[1:08:41] had a past Pinal park and the next exit
[1:08:43] was ours Marana I said so we're stopping
[1:08:45] at the next exit you'll take the car
[1:08:47] from there so she's wiping her eyes and
[1:08:50] she's trying to wake up we pull into the
[1:08:53] Marana Road exit she wakes up she
[1:08:55] started looking around and she looks at
[1:08:57] me says we're home she goes that wasn't
[1:09:00] very nice of you
[1:09:02] today I think I would have done that way
[1:09:05] back there somewhere thank the Lord that
[1:09:08] we were able to do those things brother
[1:09:10] Dennis enjoyed himself and we enjoyed
[1:09:12] having brother Dennis daily I believe it
[1:09:15] was a blessing to us so the Lord is good
[1:09:17] to herself this evening and I I I went
[1:09:21] back and revisited something I spoke
[1:09:23] here nine years ago back in May and I
[1:09:28] had had it found a little it was there I
[1:09:32] was actually at the dump throwing some
[1:09:34] stuff away and I kicked a box out of the
[1:09:36] way and all these invitations fell out
[1:09:38] they look like wedding invitations or
[1:09:41] something like that so I picked it up
[1:09:42] one up and I thought I'd read it to see
[1:09:44] what it was you know and when I opened
[1:09:47] it up this is what it said if I could
[1:09:49] give you one thing in life I would give
[1:09:52] you the ability to your see yourself
[1:09:54] through my eyes only then you would
[1:09:57] realize how special you are to me and I
[1:10:01] thought boy that was some nice words
[1:10:03] somebody wrote for somebody else but I
[1:10:07] said Oh Lord opened my eyes and let me
[1:10:11] see what you see in me how you think of
[1:10:14] me and I saw I could understand in them
[1:10:17] that is sort of the thought and I
[1:10:18] remembered that and I was looking at
[1:10:22] some of those things and I just said you
[1:10:23] know when we look to the Word of God and
[1:10:27] we can see ourselves in it we are
[1:10:31] looking through God's eyes because he
[1:10:34] took and he wrote ahead and written down
[1:10:36] so you and I could see ourselves and you
[1:10:40] know when you look into the mirror of
[1:10:41] God's Word what are you supposed to look
[1:10:43] at are you trying to see yourself if you
[1:10:48] look in the mirror of God's Word and all
[1:10:49] you see is yourself there's a problem
[1:10:52] there but you have to see what God says
[1:10:56] about you and begin to look at that so
[1:10:59] two of whom the whole family in heaven
[1:11:03] and earth is named
[1:11:06] mrs. Jesus Christ you know it's
[1:11:10] sometimes you get a little bit you start
[1:11:14] your wondering isn't really am I ever
[1:11:16] going to come to that image that maybe
[1:11:18] an image that you've formulated yourself
[1:11:21] when I become a that good Christian this
[1:11:24] is going to be like this and this is a
[1:11:26] I'll never have a problem like that all
[1:11:28] you know and you get disappointed in
[1:11:30] yourself but you can go back and you can
[1:11:33] see some of the scriptures and you can
[1:11:35] encourage yourself by the Word of God
[1:11:38] because the Word of God is true it never
[1:11:42] fails you know it is better to believe
[1:11:45] what God says about you than what you
[1:11:49] know about yourself because what you
[1:11:51] know about yourself can disappoint you
[1:11:53] quite often but God's Word never fails
[1:11:57] so in st. John chapter 16 we'll look at
[1:12:03] verses 26 and 27 and and here's your
[1:12:08] Jesus is speaking to his disciples he
[1:12:10] says and that that day you shall ask in
[1:12:12] my name and I say not unto you that I
[1:12:15] will pray the Father for you for the
[1:12:18] father himself loveth you you know was
[1:12:22] easy for the disciple standing there
[1:12:24] well your Jesus you know you're the one
[1:12:27] he's promised well yes of course the
[1:12:29] father has you and eternally says you're
[1:12:31] going to be able to talk to the father
[1:12:33] just the way I talk to the father
[1:12:35] because he's your father he says for the
[1:12:38] father himself love with you because he
[1:12:41] have loved me and believed that I came
[1:12:43] out from God and as he was the first the
[1:12:49] wave sheaf the first then all his other
[1:12:52] children followed the same way as part
[1:12:55] of the the children of God st. John 17
[1:12:59] we'll look at three verses there 10 22
[1:13:02] and 23 and the word of God again does
[1:13:06] not return void it'll accomplish what
[1:13:10] God said it will do it never fails and
[1:13:13] he says and all mine are thine and this
[1:13:16] is in Jesus Prayer
[1:13:18] and thine are my and I am glorified in
[1:13:21] them so who's he speaking of my name is
[1:13:26] there Amen in the next two verses - and
[1:13:30] the glory which thou gave a--the me I
[1:13:33] have given them that they may be one
[1:13:36] even as we are one I and them and thou
[1:13:40] in me that they may be may be made
[1:13:43] perfect in one and that the world may
[1:13:46] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[1:13:49] them as thou has loved me amen that's
[1:13:56] the Word of God is telling us what he
[1:13:58] thinks of us I was looking at a couple
[1:14:01] of things that brother Branham said here
[1:14:04] and we'll share a couple of these quotes
[1:14:06] with you and we'll start with letting
[1:14:12] off the pressure and sometimes you you
[1:14:17] you find one and another and then next
[1:14:20] thing 45 minutes or an hour has gone by
[1:14:21] and you've just just just been reading
[1:14:23] and say my he said look at that look at
[1:14:25] that and you have just say okay I've got
[1:14:27] 40 of them how do I cut it down to two
[1:14:29] or three yeah they're all good
[1:14:31] he says I'm only trying to represent him
[1:14:34] reflect him like in a mirror - you
[1:14:38] making my life his mirror that he might
[1:14:41] reflect himself so when you're looking
[1:14:46] into the mirror of god you should see
[1:14:48] Christ in that mirror because he's
[1:14:53] reflecting himself through you and he's
[1:14:57] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:15:00] and forever the stature of a perfect man
[1:15:07] you know in the old time when they used
[1:15:10] to make gold before they had this
[1:15:12] smelter to burn it out they used to beat
[1:15:15] the gold out beat the sludge out the
[1:15:16] iron and the copper and stuff out and
[1:15:18] just keep beating and turn it over and
[1:15:21] beating it the Indians do that now
[1:15:24] beating the gold and they beat it you
[1:15:25] know how they could tell all the iron
[1:15:28] was
[1:15:28] out of it and all the dirt and stuff and
[1:15:30] the dross was out of it
[1:15:32] when the one that was beating could see
[1:15:34] his own reflection like a mirror in it
[1:15:38] it was clean and clear through til it
[1:15:41] reflected the beater now you and I
[1:15:44] aren't and this earth to beat one
[1:15:47] another God does that work God is the
[1:15:52] one who wants to see himself reflected
[1:15:55] in you you know I'm not it's not the job
[1:15:59] for the minister the husband or the wife
[1:16:01] or whoever it is to beat the other one
[1:16:04] to try to say this is what I want you to
[1:16:06] be but God himself you know the things
[1:16:10] in your life that he is ordained and you
[1:16:12] say well you know God wanted me to do
[1:16:14] this and I went this way and I did this
[1:16:18] way God knew that it doesn't surprise
[1:16:21] him it's all part of the process that he
[1:16:24] works through in your life and and you
[1:16:27] know sometimes that process for one
[1:16:29] maybe one day and that prophets were
[1:16:32] processed for another maybe six months
[1:16:34] but God is going to accomplish what he
[1:16:37] said he would the reflection of the
[1:16:40] beader is what we're looking for there
[1:16:43] and then identification I believe is the
[1:16:47] next one in 63
[1:16:50] we all remember this one this little lad
[1:16:53] must have been raised in such a home and
[1:16:56] when he came down to visit his
[1:16:57] grandmother he was talking about the old
[1:16:59] houses that they might have had a little
[1:17:01] piece of mirror and you know he talks
[1:17:03] brother Brahim talks about when he was
[1:17:04] shaving and watch his dad shave with
[1:17:06] just a little piece of glass hanging off
[1:17:08] the tree you know not a full-length
[1:17:10] mirror or nothing like that you know and
[1:17:12] he came down to visit his grandmother
[1:17:14] she had a door on the back side of it
[1:17:17] was a mirror and the little ad was kind
[1:17:20] of lonesome and he was looking all
[1:17:22] around the house and after a bit he
[1:17:23] happened to look through the door and it
[1:17:26] had been closed since they come in and
[1:17:28] and in the mirror on his side he saw a
[1:17:31] little boy and he started to the little
[1:17:34] boy and to make friends with him and we
[1:17:35] began to look into the glass
[1:17:37] he got up close and he turned around he
[1:17:39] said why
[1:17:40] that's me I want to be able to come to
[1:17:45] that day one say why God that's me that
[1:17:48] that's me I've been beat I've been the
[1:17:50] shape I'm beginning to look like what
[1:17:53] God wanted what God saw in me when he
[1:17:56] looked over and he said Abraham my
[1:17:58] friend I'm gonna go down and talk with
[1:18:00] him and be with him when he went down as
[1:18:03] a fourth man with the three Hebrew
[1:18:05] children they had gone through all they
[1:18:06] had and they were beginning where God
[1:18:08] desired that fellowship because they
[1:18:10] were looking more and more like him he
[1:18:13] says why mama that's me and that's what
[1:18:16] we want to look at tonight I want to
[1:18:19] look at me and I want you to look at
[1:18:20] yourself and as we look into God's great
[1:18:23] mirror of his word let's let's be able
[1:18:26] to identify ourselves what was some that
[1:18:28] we're going to speak about some of the
[1:18:30] characters of other times you know when
[1:18:32] we look at the scripture sometimes we
[1:18:34] look at him saying well yeah well they
[1:18:35] were godly men they they had this they
[1:18:38] had that well that's the same about you
[1:18:40] if another book of Acts is gonna be
[1:18:43] written what's it going to be written
[1:18:44] like just like the godly men in this
[1:18:46] book it doesn't change he says be able
[1:18:50] to identify ourselves with something
[1:18:52] that we're going to speak about some of
[1:18:53] the characters of other times and I want
[1:18:55] to see myself in God's looking-glass
[1:18:58] because if anything will show you where
[1:19:00] you're standing it's this book there is
[1:19:02] no book like it because it tells the
[1:19:05] truth I don't say that other books are
[1:19:07] not true but I know this one
[1:19:09] is true it's all truth because it's a
[1:19:12] Word of God now Jesus gave us the
[1:19:15] example of what we ought to be looking
[1:19:18] at when he reflected his life to us
[1:19:20] through the word that we should see when
[1:19:23] we when we look into God's mirror we
[1:19:26] should see ourselves identified with him
[1:19:28] that is a perfect example you know an
[1:19:33] American light to you you know you you
[1:19:36] say some of these mirrors they're
[1:19:37] slightly distorted and you're trying to
[1:19:40] see it this way and you're trying to see
[1:19:42] it that way but God's mirror is pure
[1:19:44] perfect and true no distortion in it at
[1:19:48] all no no fate or anything back to it or
[1:19:51] anything like that
[1:19:52] I laughing and you'll laugh with this
[1:19:54] one there was a lady standing in front
[1:19:57] of the mirror and she was kind of
[1:19:59] bullying and just she was all upset and
[1:20:01] and this other this gentleman walks up
[1:20:05] to her and maybe he wasn't a gentleman
[1:20:07] after you hear this but he comes up and
[1:20:10] he says ma'am why are you crying and she
[1:20:13] says look that mirror makes me look fat
[1:20:18] and he being a nice guy said well then
[1:20:21] my eyes have the same problem you know
[1:20:24] okay now this is going to this is going
[1:20:28] to drive a point when you look at it in
[1:20:31] the natural sometimes that'll deceive
[1:20:35] you when you take and you look at it
[1:20:38] through your own perspective collison
[1:20:42] there are some distortions and you begin
[1:20:44] to question did it really mean that is
[1:20:46] it really saying that but when you look
[1:20:49] at it through what God's Word says it is
[1:20:51] true and if you fall short of it then
[1:20:55] you can say Lord then I know this is
[1:20:57] where I need to I need some more work
[1:20:59] Lord I surrender
[1:21:01] do some more work in me you know we say
[1:21:04] give me patience Lord and could I have
[1:21:06] it now
[1:21:07] yeah no patience is overtime patience
[1:21:10] goes on so he said that is the perfect
[1:21:12] example God's Word I think we have one
[1:21:19] or two more there identification then
[1:21:23] what an example how would our life
[1:21:25] reflect to his and he made the example
[1:21:29] of what we should do how we should be we
[1:21:32] should see him when you look in the
[1:21:35] mirror and the problem is we see
[1:21:38] ourselves and we get disappointed but
[1:21:40] let's look at what God said you know I
[1:21:44] look at this and I've thought of this
[1:21:46] many times we look through the the New
[1:21:48] Testament and the Old Testament the in
[1:21:51] the Old Testament the actual account of
[1:21:52] the lives of men like Abraham and and
[1:21:55] David and Samson and Gideon and some of
[1:21:58] them and we would say wow you know
[1:22:00] Gideon he was a good man but he tried
[1:22:02] the Lord he kept saying you know let me
[1:22:03] put a fleece before you in the Lord too
[1:22:05] Kate and he were doing let me try
[1:22:07] another one you know and and God would
[1:22:09] do it again anyways and and Abraham lied
[1:22:12] to the king about his wife David we know
[1:22:16] the life of David and the many of me
[1:22:18] says you know we would look at them he
[1:22:20] would say how can they be but then you
[1:22:23] go to the New Testament and in de
[1:22:25] Hebrews and you see God's account of
[1:22:28] them by faith he staggered not at the
[1:22:32] promise of God and you go well then what
[1:22:35] was that that looked like a stagger to
[1:22:38] me but God said he staggered not God
[1:22:41] looked me on the outter and looked down
[1:22:43] into the heart the heart the desire to
[1:22:46] be like Christ the pool the desire when
[1:22:49] when others said ah this is close enough
[1:22:51] this is good enough you know that
[1:22:53] c-average is good enough when God said
[1:22:56] no it would be hole complete it would be
[1:22:58] perfect he said we should see him when
[1:23:00] you look in the mirror see Christ the
[1:23:03] mirror of his word he says how that he
[1:23:06] did that for love when you realize that
[1:23:08] everything God has done had a love
[1:23:11] motive behind it that's how God works
[1:23:15] and then I think at the last one
[1:23:18] exposition or or we have one more for
[1:23:21] identification there and let them and
[1:23:25] let it be born again and a new nature
[1:23:27] come in that's the only way kill the
[1:23:31] nature of yourself that you might be
[1:23:34] coming and then the word becomes a
[1:23:36] living thing it expresses itself through
[1:23:39] you see then you're looking in the
[1:23:42] looking-glass when people sees you as a
[1:23:45] mirror when people begin to see Christ
[1:23:50] in you he says because you know God has
[1:23:53] made a way people don't read the Bible
[1:23:55] so God has made you a Bible you are what
[1:24:00] you do people is looking at you and and
[1:24:04] you know they can say if there's a
[1:24:07] Christian and when you say you're a
[1:24:10] Christian when somebody says you're a
[1:24:12] Christian what are they saying
[1:24:14] you're a follower of Christ you know
[1:24:18] that's the true definition of a
[1:24:20] Christian a follower of Christ if you
[1:24:22] say you're a Muslim nobody says oh they
[1:24:24] follow Jesus Christ if you say oh I'm
[1:24:27] Buddha they say oh you follow Jesus
[1:24:29] Christ no that has a whole different
[1:24:31] represent but if they say you are a
[1:24:33] Christian you're a follower of Christ
[1:24:35] you're identified with Christ and it
[1:24:37] made me think because I've heard the
[1:24:40] term oh they're Branagh mites and you
[1:24:43] know what I'm not a Brahmin right am i
[1:24:46] but I do follow the god of brother
[1:24:48] Branham and and and I don't take it
[1:24:52] wrong in one sense if somebody would
[1:24:53] call me a brand of might I'm not gonna
[1:24:56] be offended by it but I but that's not
[1:24:59] who we follow Paul said follow me as I
[1:25:04] follow Christ and brother Branham said I
[1:25:05] preached everything Paul preached so
[1:25:09] when when I come out you know I still
[1:25:11] see you know you lean this way and I
[1:25:14] still see that you go this way and and
[1:25:16] that's okay we're still going through
[1:25:18] life we're still going along but there
[1:25:20] comes a time when somebody says you are
[1:25:22] a Christian you know in in your in your
[1:25:26] conversation in your actions in your
[1:25:29] dress
[1:25:29] all of it together the true life of God
[1:25:33] begins to reflect he says so he made you
[1:25:36] the Bible the only one some people will
[1:25:38] ever read you are what you do people is
[1:25:41] looking at you and then the last one in
[1:25:45] the exposition of the seven churches I
[1:25:48] know thy works if a man fears that he
[1:25:52] might not please God then let him
[1:25:54] fulfill the word if a man wonders if he
[1:25:57] will hear these words well done good and
[1:26:00] faithful servant and I think every one
[1:26:03] of us are striving for that looking for
[1:26:06] that day to hear well done come and
[1:26:08] enter that one to the joys of the Lord
[1:26:10] he says let him fulfill the word of God
[1:26:12] in his life and assuredly he will hear
[1:26:15] the words of praise those words of
[1:26:17] praise the word of truth was a criterion
[1:26:21] then it's a criterion now there is isn't
[1:26:24] another standard there isn't an
[1:26:27] plumb line as the world is going to be
[1:26:29] judged by one Christ Jesus even so it's
[1:26:33] going to be judged by the word if a man
[1:26:36] wants to know how he's making out let
[1:26:39] him do as James suggested look into the
[1:26:42] mirror of God's Word it's okay and
[1:26:46] sometimes you know you'll stand brothers
[1:26:48] you know sister you share something with
[1:26:51] them and you ask for some advice or or
[1:26:54] you tell them be honest about me
[1:26:55] tell me how you really feel tell me what
[1:26:58] you think and they say well you know
[1:27:00] you've got these strong points but you
[1:27:03] know you you've got this and I'll share
[1:27:05] something that happened the other day I
[1:27:07] was with my old boss and we had played
[1:27:09] golf and we had a a walk on a guy that
[1:27:14] just played with us a nice old gentleman
[1:27:17] and we're talking and I got to talking
[1:27:19] to him and so I was sitting at home and
[1:27:22] my phone went off about 10 o'clock at
[1:27:25] night and I was still awake and I saw
[1:27:26] was a text and my boss was texting my ol
[1:27:31] boss and didn't know I was included so I
[1:27:35] started reading their text and so my ol
[1:27:38] boss goes he said you know and he says
[1:27:41] so we had this guy that walked on with
[1:27:43] us and Aaron talked to him and kept him
[1:27:46] you know entertained and all he goes and
[1:27:48] I didn't have to listen to Aaron and I'm
[1:27:51] reading it and I go he's right Aaron
[1:27:53] talks a lot that's true
[1:27:57] and he had no idea I was reading it he
[1:27:59] thought it was just going to the boss so
[1:28:00] he was saying Fanning I mean so after a
[1:28:03] little bit I just responded hey guys
[1:28:04] good night going to bed now and then the
[1:28:08] whole conversation changed and that's
[1:28:11] okay because yeah I do talk a lot okay
[1:28:14] all I do and that's okay I would just be
[1:28:18] nice to the guy and everything and Tony
[1:28:20] doesn't like to talk a lot and that's
[1:28:21] perfectly fine but you know it's
[1:28:24] sometimes somebody will discover
[1:28:27] themselves or unveil themselves or you
[1:28:29] know the mirror shows what you are my
[1:28:32] wife when I told her about it she goes
[1:28:34] and what did you do I just told him
[1:28:36] goodnight they knew it got all quiet
[1:28:39] after that that's all right you know and
[1:28:42] and so as we look at that you are a
[1:28:46] written a living written epistle of God
[1:28:50] and so let's look at some scriptures
[1:28:53] here and some things that he says and we
[1:28:59] have read Ephesians in st. John and 2nd
[1:29:02] Corinthians 4:18 let's let's go there
[1:29:09] first God's Word never fails and never
[1:29:14] returns void while we look not at the
[1:29:16] things which are seen but at the things
[1:29:20] which are not seen for the things which
[1:29:23] are seen are temporal but the things
[1:29:26] which are not seen are eternal
[1:29:28] well we get caught up on what we see
[1:29:31] some time the the outer man the one that
[1:29:35] Paul said o wretched man that I am Who
[1:29:37] Shall deliver me from this guy we get
[1:29:41] caught up with that one sometimes you
[1:29:43] know but but when you get feeling of
[1:29:45] that go back to Hebrews 11 and start
[1:29:49] reading God's account of his children
[1:29:51] and say Lord do you could you say the
[1:29:56] same thing about me by faith Stephan
[1:30:00] stab staggered not at the promise of God
[1:30:03] you know and if you would I asked
[1:30:06] Abraham and Abraham as a memory would
[1:30:07] have gone a few times but Lord then what
[1:30:09] was that but the record shows that you
[1:30:14] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:30:16] that's what God has said so we're
[1:30:19] looking to those things which are not
[1:30:22] seeing 1st Corinthians 3 12 13 12 sorry
[1:30:29] says for now we see through a glass
[1:30:31] darkly but then face to face now I know
[1:30:35] in part but then I shall know even as
[1:30:39] also I am known
[1:30:41] I'm so glad that I can say
[1:30:45] I'm one of them that's what God's Word
[1:30:48] said but brother grain you should talk
[1:30:50] about brother branham watching brother
[1:30:52] branham a drive-by on the car and he
[1:30:53] would look and watch him he was usually
[1:30:55] singing I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[1:30:58] them he wasn't going down the street
[1:31:01] singing oh me oh my oh look it just poor
[1:31:05] old me no I'm so glad that I can say I'm
[1:31:08] one of them I'm so glad I'm a part of
[1:31:10] the family of God Jesus James 1 23 and
[1:31:16] 24 for if any be a hearer of the word
[1:31:20] and not a doer he is like unto a man
[1:31:24] beholding his natural face in a glass
[1:31:26] it's another word for a mirror and he
[1:31:29] but behold of himself and goeth away and
[1:31:32] straightway forgetteth what manner of
[1:31:34] man he was
[1:31:36] James is save you only listen to it and
[1:31:39] you don't put it into action every time
[1:31:42] you go back to the mirror you're gonna
[1:31:44] see the old man you're gonna see the one
[1:31:46] that frustrates you usually gonna see
[1:31:48] the one that you say I got to do
[1:31:50] something about that guy and he says but
[1:31:53] a door of the word of God is going to
[1:31:55] begin to see a different reflection hey
[1:31:58] hey I see more of Christ in me somebody
[1:32:03] else is gonna be sa my goodness there's
[1:32:05] something about you today there's a
[1:32:07] radiance about you there's a presence
[1:32:10] about you it's beginning to show more of
[1:32:12] Christ and that's what James says a doer
[1:32:14] of the word of God not just coming
[1:32:17] Sunday and hearing coming Wednesday and
[1:32:19] hearing or wherever it is but putting
[1:32:21] those things into action this is 1 John
[1:32:26] 3 and verses 1 and 2 behold what manner
[1:32:32] of love the father has bestowed upon us
[1:32:34] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:32:38] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:32:40] because it didn't know him it knew him
[1:32:42] not beloved now we are the sons of God
[1:32:45] not when we cross into eternity now we
[1:32:49] are the sons of God and it does not yet
[1:32:52] up here what we shall be but we know
[1:32:54] that when he shall appear we shall be
[1:32:57] like him
[1:32:58] for we shall see him as he is again we
[1:33:02] are looking into the mirror of God's
[1:33:03] Word and by doing that we will be like
[1:33:08] him because you are what you eat you are
[1:33:12] what you read you are what you feast on
[1:33:14] you are what you spend your time with
[1:33:17] that's the truth I've shared this
[1:33:19] testimony when I was a young man we
[1:33:21] first moved here from California and and
[1:33:23] I really like sports and I would go
[1:33:26] watch we graduate from Sunnyside high
[1:33:28] school we'd go watch their football
[1:33:30] games we started going to the U of A and
[1:33:31] I was talking to a brother one day and I
[1:33:33] was telling him how much I struggled
[1:33:35] with him and he said well where were you
[1:33:36] Friday
[1:33:37] at the football game where were you
[1:33:39] Saturday at the football game but I came
[1:33:42] to church Sunday hmm
[1:33:44] but you struggled through Sunday what
[1:33:48] were you doing and he said brother Aaron
[1:33:50] is pretty simple stop spending your time
[1:33:52] there quit feeding that part I look back
[1:33:57] now and I say you know what I don't miss
[1:33:59] it I don't need it at one time it seems
[1:34:03] so hard to be without it
[1:34:04] and today God will do that work you
[1:34:08] begin to look into the mirror of God's
[1:34:10] Word now I like this one I've used this
[1:34:15] scripture many times Jeremiah 29:11 we
[1:34:19] all know it before I know the thoughts
[1:34:21] that I think towards you saith the Lord
[1:34:24] thoughts of peace peace is an absence of
[1:34:28] war when there is peace there's not a
[1:34:31] conflict when there is peace there's not
[1:34:33] anguish and there's rest in peace
[1:34:36] thoughts of peace he says I'm looking at
[1:34:38] you settled grounded at pcs those are my
[1:34:42] thoughts for you not of evil to give you
[1:34:46] and expect it and to give you the very
[1:34:48] thing I promised you to give you the
[1:34:50] very thing the Word of God says that's
[1:34:52] my desire that's what I have planned for
[1:34:55] you and I thank God that his plans never
[1:34:58] get sidetracked hey they are constant we
[1:35:03] look at Philippians 4:13
[1:35:06] and and we like to use this one and and
[1:35:11] sometimes I tell myself in the morning
[1:35:13] your attitude when you're getting up in
[1:35:15] the morning can determine the rest of
[1:35:17] your day you know it's it's and I've
[1:35:21] shared with you I have good Mondays
[1:35:23] because of a lot of other people don't
[1:35:26] so somebody has to hold it up so
[1:35:29] everybody makes it up on Tuesday and I
[1:35:31] have lousy Tuesdays and one day I
[1:35:33] started telling me that's what you've
[1:35:35] been saying for a long time you keep
[1:35:37] saying I have lousy Tuesdays why don't
[1:35:39] you change that you wake up in the
[1:35:42] morning thinking it's Tuesday and you
[1:35:44] would say you do that yes I did it for a
[1:35:46] long time i I didn't dread Mondays but
[1:35:49] Tuesday I say it seems like Tuesday's my
[1:35:51] day always goes backwards if it's gonna
[1:35:52] be a problem
[1:35:53] something's not gonna work something's
[1:35:55] gonna break Tuesday and you know what
[1:35:58] Tuesdays have been a whole lot better
[1:35:59] now because it just changed my attitude
[1:36:02] they're still Tuesdays but my attitude
[1:36:04] is different about him he says I can do
[1:36:08] all things through Christ which
[1:36:10] strengthens man because I can know
[1:36:14] through Christ who strengthens me
[1:36:17] that's Paul saying I can do all things
[1:36:20] you know and and then we look here at
[1:36:23] there's a lot of scriptures today
[1:36:26] because it's God's Word we go to Hebrews
[1:36:30] chapter 11 and we know that Hebrews is
[1:36:33] the Allah is the 11 is the faith chapter
[1:36:36] 4 by faith Abel 4 by faith Abraham 4 and
[1:36:40] you know faith a couple of ways we
[1:36:42] explain faith is believing and having
[1:36:44] faith in God but brother Branham says
[1:36:46] faith is a revelation when God when it
[1:36:50] becomes real to you when you realize
[1:36:53] that what God said he meant because it
[1:36:55] becomes part of your life you know
[1:36:57] hearing brother brother Jordan's
[1:36:59] testimony he didn't put himself he
[1:37:01] didn't he didn't get how does it say
[1:37:05] whatever starts saying Lord and you're
[1:37:06] not giving me a job lord I can't find a
[1:37:07] job and and spend that time he said Lord
[1:37:09] I lay it in your hands and
[1:37:10] his hands and God looks at said and says
[1:37:13] hey that's faith now brother Jordan
[1:37:16] maybe I'm not saying there sometimes the
[1:37:17] thoughts didn't go through your head but
[1:37:19] you refuse to listen to those and say no
[1:37:22] your word says so and then God meets
[1:37:26] your need and sometimes I've had had
[1:37:29] this happen to me when suddenly you
[1:37:31] realize wait a minute I forgot I asked
[1:37:34] God for that anyways the life because he
[1:37:38] takes care of you watches over his
[1:37:40] children he takes care of his family
[1:37:42] he's talking to to his disciples and and
[1:37:44] he says oh you know you've been being
[1:37:47] earthly fathers when your son or your
[1:37:50] daughter your children ask you for a
[1:37:52] fish you don't give him a serpent when
[1:37:55] they ask you for bread you don't give
[1:37:56] him a stone he says how much more your
[1:37:58] heavenly father constantly Jesus is
[1:38:03] reminding us who we are who we are you
[1:38:07] know he would say you're your party
[1:38:09] you're part of my you know you're part
[1:38:11] of me as I'm part of him we are of the
[1:38:14] same father I I've said this and I'll
[1:38:16] say it again be careful who you call not
[1:38:20] your brother your sister well you know
[1:38:25] that's not my brother and I'm not
[1:38:28] talking in the physical sense I'm
[1:38:30] talking as a Christian because if their
[1:38:33] father is God and you said that's not my
[1:38:38] brother then who's your father never put
[1:38:45] it in that perspective well he's not my
[1:38:47] brother he's not my sister
[1:38:48] you're saying we don't have the same
[1:38:49] father and if that person is a child of
[1:38:54] God be careful be careful what you say
[1:38:58] about someone rather than say lord help
[1:39:01] me to see or help me to walk in their
[1:39:03] shoes for a little while now it when you
[1:39:08] walk in somebody else your shoes for a
[1:39:10] little while sudden you say wow now I
[1:39:12] understand why why they feel or out
[1:39:14] they're going through you know I had
[1:39:17] somebody tell me isn't brother Matt a
[1:39:19] little too young to be a pastor
[1:39:22] and I said you know I laughed about it
[1:39:25] and I said well he is young because I'm
[1:39:27] on that side looking this way now but
[1:39:31] when I started here at church I was 29
[1:39:34] years old about 30 31 but brother al
[1:39:38] Peterson asked me to start helping back
[1:39:40] there in the back at the door
[1:39:42] and people were looking at me like
[1:39:44] you're pretty young but I didn't think I
[1:39:48] was I thought I was old enough and big
[1:39:49] enough and strong enough but now I'm
[1:39:52] looking at 60 looking back at 36 and
[1:39:55] saying yeah he's a bit young but you
[1:39:59] know what huh in that sense age doesn't
[1:40:03] matter to God he can call him when
[1:40:08] they're six he put he put Kings in
[1:40:10] Israel at six and eight and 10 years old
[1:40:13] gaudiya what do you do now and some
[1:40:17] people a brother branham is there and
[1:40:19] when he's on the other side he's talking
[1:40:21] and that sister came up to him and she
[1:40:22] said you don't remember me says no I
[1:40:24] don't and she goes I was 90 years old
[1:40:27] when I came to the Lord God knows what
[1:40:31] he's doing I said no he's not young he's
[1:40:36] in God's hands and I look at some of us
[1:40:39] and say oh they're too young no they're
[1:40:41] not they're in God's hands they're
[1:40:43] learning and you know as you learn by
[1:40:45] experience and the best way is by
[1:40:48] experience there's a lot of book
[1:40:51] learning without experience you know
[1:40:56] different ones that say I read the book
[1:40:57] I used to laugh because a friend of mine
[1:41:00] son who was maybe about 14 years old
[1:41:04] we were doing something at his house and
[1:41:06] his son turn around so I mean this is
[1:41:08] how you do it this is how you do it this
[1:41:09] is how you do it as the boy walked away
[1:41:11] his dad goes he read the book last night
[1:41:14] so now he's an expert because he had
[1:41:17] just read the book
[1:41:18] I think we were talking about loading
[1:41:21] bullets I was just getting into it and
[1:41:24] he kind of laughed I go yeah but down
[1:41:26] time he learned how to load then I could
[1:41:29] ask him a question I said okay will you
[1:41:30] do it you do it this way this one this
[1:41:31] way
[1:41:32] it's good it's good to read book but
[1:41:37] it's better to learn by experience above
[1:41:38] that book to begin to experience those
[1:41:41] things in your own life because whether
[1:41:43] experience comes responsibilities God
[1:41:46] begins to say that's a responsible one
[1:41:49] there is one who has learned there is
[1:41:50] one that I can trust that I can give
[1:41:54] some authority in this situation
[1:41:56] something you know I guess so that when
[1:41:59] Satan comes and says Paul I know and
[1:42:02] Jesus I know but who are you then all he
[1:42:06] can say
[1:42:07] brother Merle I know sister Amelia I
[1:42:11] know why because they have learned and
[1:42:15] have become that which God has said to
[1:42:18] each one of us is that same place you
[1:42:21] know I sometimes we feel well and and
[1:42:23] and well I'll have to have a minister
[1:42:24] pray for me I'll have to have a brother
[1:42:25] pray for me I'll have to but what about
[1:42:28] that child of God sitting next to you
[1:42:30] who can reach out and touch the Lord's
[1:42:32] Hill because they've learned through
[1:42:35] experience in the globe you know
[1:42:36] watching God move in their own lives
[1:42:38] and he can have that faith he says so in
[1:42:42] Hebrews we were looking at Hebrews 11:40
[1:42:47] watch what he says here the last
[1:42:51] scripture of that God having provided
[1:42:52] some better thing for us that they
[1:42:56] without us should not be made perfect
[1:42:58] they without us for that portion of the
[1:43:02] body that thing would not be complete or
[1:43:04] they wouldn't come to the full blessing
[1:43:07] yet because we're part of it you're as
[1:43:11] much a child of God as they were a child
[1:43:12] of God you're as much a child of God as
[1:43:14] Abraham was to Abraham was given a
[1:43:16] promise to you as given a promise and
[1:43:18] he's the same God that fulfills it as He
[1:43:21] fulfilled it with Abraham as he
[1:43:22] fulfilled it with Moses and each one he
[1:43:24] does the same with you you're just as
[1:43:27] important you mean just as much to him
[1:43:29] he said for they without of us would not
[1:43:32] be made perfect or the other word for
[1:43:33] there is complete and whole your part is
[1:43:36] needed also 2nd Timothy 1:5
[1:43:40] now I I just was thinking about this
[1:43:43] through the family watch this Paul is
[1:43:46] speaking to Timothy says when I call to
[1:43:48] remembrance the unfeigned faith that is
[1:43:51] in thee which to our first in thy
[1:43:53] grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice
[1:43:56] and I am persuaded in the awesome a
[1:44:01] godly heritage that was passed down Paul
[1:44:06] began to see Timothy now you know what
[1:44:08] there's a lot of the same action the
[1:44:11] same rillette resemblance as that godly
[1:44:13] mother and that godly grandmother Paul B
[1:44:18] that's what he's identifying it and I
[1:44:20] want to take that a little further acts
[1:44:23] 239 the next scripture exercise x2 39
[1:44:29] for the promise is unto you and to your
[1:44:32] children and to all that are afar off
[1:44:35] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:44:37] call he's telling here he has pointed
[1:44:40] out to Timothy where it came from in
[1:44:41] here and acts he's saying it's to all of
[1:44:44] God's children as to as many and then
[1:44:46] then again in acts 16:31 and they said
[1:44:51] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:44:54] thou shalt be saved and thy house I've
[1:45:00] claimed every one of my girls in the
[1:45:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said
[1:45:04] they're part of my house my dad claimed
[1:45:07] me and it's gone down the lining Jesus
[1:45:10] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:45:12] forever I've shared this with you when
[1:45:14] when I was talking to the insurance
[1:45:16] agent as as they as each one of the
[1:45:19] girls were getting their cars and nobody
[1:45:21] when they could afford a car and for the
[1:45:22] insurance they could have a car and and
[1:45:25] I called his name's Dave then at the
[1:45:27] insurance agent and I said Dave are my
[1:45:29] girls up to date on their insurance
[1:45:30] because I didn't want a surprise dad I
[1:45:33] got an accident and I hadn't paid for my
[1:45:35] surance for three months what do I do
[1:45:36] now
[1:45:37] you know one of those type of things and
[1:45:38] Dave made this comment to me he said
[1:45:40] Aaron these were his words he goes if
[1:45:43] all the kids were like your kids we
[1:45:45] wouldn't have the problems we have he
[1:45:48] goes if they can't pay it on the due
[1:45:50] date they'll call me I say I'll have it
[1:45:51] there tomorrow or whatever there
[1:45:53] very attentive to it and dad took a nice
[1:45:56] deep breath and said thank you lord you
[1:45:59] know but right about then I thought to
[1:46:02] myself Lord all right my girls making
[1:46:05] things right with you is that blessed
[1:46:09] assurance are they talking with their
[1:46:11] agent about blessed assurance you know
[1:46:14] because I see him at home I see it him
[1:46:17] at church but I don't see him on their
[1:46:18] jobsite I didn't what are they doing and
[1:46:20] the Lord I was driving down the freeway
[1:46:22] on my work truck and the Lord took me
[1:46:24] right then and there right to job and I
[1:46:28] said job laid a sacrifice every morning
[1:46:30] in case his children had sinned and God
[1:46:34] said I will honor your prayers for your
[1:46:37] daughters that's what he said to me and
[1:46:40] what a blessing so a few weeks later I'm
[1:46:44] studying and I if I find something
[1:46:46] brother Graham said I usually will go up
[1:46:48] a couple of paragraphs up and down just
[1:46:51] to make sure I'm getting everything he's
[1:46:53] saying there and brother Brahim saying
[1:46:55] something and he goes that's like like a
[1:46:57] good father he said just like job a good
[1:47:00] father just like job every morning would
[1:47:03] lay a sacrifice for his children a good
[1:47:05] father would I said thank you Lord you
[1:47:08] just double confirmed it for me every
[1:47:10] morning and I pray for them and ask for
[1:47:12] them I say Lord I'm a they keep their
[1:47:15] hearts right before you may their
[1:47:17] attitude be good may you know if they
[1:47:18] make a mistake let him because God said
[1:47:21] to pray that way God said he would honor
[1:47:23] it and God has he keeps his word and so
[1:47:27] I just wanted to show it it's if you
[1:47:30] have godly parents it's a blessing in
[1:47:33] your life a mother and a father who
[1:47:36] would pray for you a mother and a father
[1:47:37] who would who would say you know
[1:47:39] daughter son don't be that way don't do
[1:47:41] that it's going to cost you so that's a
[1:47:43] blessing today you know sometimes you've
[1:47:46] heard people say well you need to go out
[1:47:48] into the world to get a testimony don't
[1:47:50] you you don't do that don't even listen
[1:47:52] to that stay pure stayed true I've
[1:47:55] talked to some folks who who are
[1:47:57] Christians now and they serve the Lord
[1:47:59] and they say some of those memories
[1:48:00] still haunt them
[1:48:02] because Satan will try to get back at
[1:48:04] you but if there's no memories there
[1:48:06] he can't hunt you with him but you guys
[1:48:09] say no I'm saying I wasn't involved with
[1:48:11] things my life was involved in prayer
[1:48:13] meetings my Volvo life was involved in
[1:48:15] Christian gathering my life was involved
[1:48:17] in this that's a godly testimony it's a
[1:48:20] good testimony romans 8 verses 14 and 19
[1:48:28] for as many as are led by the Spirit of
[1:48:32] God they are the sons of God amen
[1:48:36] are you being led by the Spirit of God
[1:48:39] brother Jordan talked about in his
[1:48:41] testimony being led by the Spirit of God
[1:48:44] what is tell you here are sons of God
[1:48:51] 19 for the earnest expectation of the
[1:48:54] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:48:56] of the sons of god there awaiting us
[1:49:02] this whole creation is looking for
[1:49:05] redemption it's looking for its
[1:49:07] purifying it's looking to go back to
[1:49:10] what it started happening and you know
[1:49:13] what it are waiting for me and you
[1:49:16] because there's I believe I can honestly
[1:49:19] say we're in that time I have to believe
[1:49:23] that I don't want to see another 40 or
[1:49:26] 50 years of this I wanted to I want to
[1:49:30] go home soon
[1:49:31] and I believe the promises have got it
[1:49:33] but if it isn't today I'll still wait on
[1:49:36] it for tomorrow if it isn't I'm still
[1:49:38] gonna believe but the whole creation is
[1:49:41] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[1:49:44] of the sons of God and who are the sons
[1:49:46] of God amen
[1:49:50] God's Word says so and I've taken and
[1:49:53] chosen to believe that let's look at
[1:49:57] Hebrews chapter 2 verses 11 and 13 for
[1:50:02] both he that sanctifies and they who are
[1:50:06] sanctified are all of one the one that's
[1:50:10] doing the sanctification and the one
[1:50:12] who's being sanctified or one he says
[1:50:15] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:50:17] call them brethren
[1:50:21] saying I will declare my name unto my
[1:50:24] brethren in the myths of the church will
[1:50:26] I sing praise unto thee and again I will
[1:50:28] put my trust in him and again behold I
[1:50:31] and the children which God has given me
[1:50:35] I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of
[1:50:39] God that's what God's Word says you know
[1:50:43] sometimes I look at the mirror and I
[1:50:44] have trouble seen it but I have to
[1:50:46] remind us what is God's Word say it up
[1:50:50] because that's true the rest of it isn't
[1:50:57] Romans and these these I did not give
[1:51:01] you these scriptures I just gonna I'm
[1:51:03] gonna give you what Roman Romans what
[1:51:06] they call us what Romans said is this is
[1:51:09] Paul writing he said in Romans chapter 1
[1:51:12] he calls you beloved of God in first
[1:51:16] Corinthians to the Church of God in
[1:51:19] Ephesians 1 Saints faithful in Christ
[1:51:22] Jesus
[1:51:24] Colossians faithful brethren tightest
[1:51:27] God's elect
[1:51:28] that's how each one is addressed when
[1:51:31] you look at the opening scripture to
[1:51:32] God's elect to God's faithful to
[1:51:35] faithful brethren in John 1 my little
[1:51:39] children the elect lady sons of God
[1:51:41] chosen elect salt-of-the-earth children
[1:51:45] of light sheep of his pasture my sheep
[1:51:49] know my voice is it my sheep he didn't
[1:51:53] say any any sheep he said my sheep know
[1:51:56] my voice he says now look at here
[1:52:00] revelations chapter 1 let's read verses
[1:52:03] 1 through 6 the revelation of Jesus
[1:52:09] Christ that's what the book is the
[1:52:13] revelation of Jesus Christ it's nothing
[1:52:17] else but God unveiling himself which God
[1:52:20] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[1:52:22] the things which must shortly come to
[1:52:24] pass
[1:52:24] and he sent and signified by his angel
[1:52:27] unto his servant John who bare record of
[1:52:31] the word of God and of the testimony of
[1:52:33] Jesus Christ and above all the things he
[1:52:34] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[1:52:39] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[1:52:41] keep those things which are written
[1:52:43] therein for the time is at hand
[1:52:46] a hearer and a doer of the word of God
[1:52:49] many have heard but didn't do but here
[1:52:53] he says they that hear the words and
[1:52:56] keep those things John to the seven
[1:52:59] churches were RNA which are in Asia
[1:53:01] grace be unto you and peace from him
[1:53:04] which is and which was and which is to
[1:53:06] come and from the seven spirits which
[1:53:09] are before his stone and from Jesus
[1:53:12] Christ who is the faithful witness and
[1:53:15] the first begotten of the Dead and the
[1:53:17] Prince of the king of the earth unto him
[1:53:20] that loved us and washed us from our
[1:53:23] sins in his own blood and hath made us
[1:53:26] kings and priests unto God and his
[1:53:29] father has made us kings and priests
[1:53:35] you're included in all of this work he
[1:53:40] says to him be glory and Dominion for
[1:53:43] ever and ever amen
[1:53:45] I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of
[1:53:49] God God's Word will not return void with
[1:53:54] that it never fails you know sometimes
[1:53:56] we get a little should I say impatient
[1:54:00] God you know we I just want to see you
[1:54:04] know but it's through that testiness
[1:54:06] through that trying is true that that
[1:54:08] time that those those things are built
[1:54:10] you know if brother Graham type cities
[1:54:12] he says you plant that seed whatever it
[1:54:16] is and I always say an apple tree he
[1:54:18] uses that one quite often you plant an
[1:54:20] apple tree a seed of an apple tree he
[1:54:23] says and every Apple that it ever that
[1:54:26] tree will ever give is in that seat
[1:54:30] sometimes it's hard to believe that a
[1:54:33] seed this big might have a hundred
[1:54:35] bushels of Apple and
[1:54:36] but it does everything that God has
[1:54:43] wanted from you is in you it's planted
[1:54:47] in you every good thing that God has
[1:54:51] desired for you is in you brother
[1:54:54] Branham says he was God over us the
[1:54:59] pillar of fire in Ella him and then he
[1:55:04] was God with us in Jesus and then he
[1:55:09] said he's God in us in the Holy Ghost
[1:55:12] did he say there were three guards no
[1:55:15] it's the same one the same one that did
[1:55:18] those things when you go back into the
[1:55:19] Old Testament you saw the things he did
[1:55:21] the same one you see when Jesus is
[1:55:23] walking on is recorded is the same one
[1:55:25] that's in you today everything that you
[1:55:28] have need of is in you because you've
[1:55:32] got God in you and again that apple tree
[1:55:35] it's going to bring forth it's going to
[1:55:38] come it has its season and every Apple
[1:55:41] that's in that seed or that it'll ever
[1:55:43] give coming is in that seed all that I
[1:55:46] am and ever hope to be I owe it all to
[1:55:49] him and he's talking about that he says
[1:55:54] another statement that brother Branham
[1:55:56] it says when the bride realizes who she
[1:55:59] is she will be an invincible army I know
[1:56:03] she's a many membered body means me and
[1:56:07] you are included in that body you know
[1:56:10] sometimes they say well you know this
[1:56:12] one and that one oh it's a many member
[1:56:14] body it's it's it's each one of God's
[1:56:16] chosen and and another thing to remember
[1:56:21] and brother Ram says is strong a lot of
[1:56:23] strongly when we're all part of the body
[1:56:24] of Christ we're part of God what he's
[1:56:27] gonna map it and sometimes we get a
[1:56:30] little upset with our brother and our
[1:56:31] sister and and you know we might accuse
[1:56:35] them of somewhere we might look down on
[1:56:36] him brother Branham says remember it's
[1:56:39] not your brother's sister it's a devil
[1:56:42] you're pushed they're part of the body
[1:56:45] of Christ your brother and your sister
[1:56:47] it's it's they're striving they're
[1:56:49] looking they're wanting to be the same
[1:56:51] as you to reach to that place to here
[1:56:54] well done thou good and faithful servant
[1:56:59] yes you know with with it with
[1:57:03] experience you've been tested you've
[1:57:05] been tried
[1:57:06] you've been proven comes
[1:57:08] responsibilities because we heard when
[1:57:12] when when John or when would the
[1:57:14] Scriptures read written them and they're
[1:57:16] there and he said this is my beloved son
[1:57:18] hear ye when brother Branham is there
[1:57:25] and and and he ties his back into Moses
[1:57:28] when God tells Moses and he says why cry
[1:57:31] speak when brother when when he tells
[1:57:35] brother branham s speak to that storm
[1:57:39] was that just for them no what's
[1:57:41] everyone at you God's children your
[1:57:44] storm may not be as big as that storm
[1:57:46] but it's still a storm in your life
[1:57:48] maybe you're going to three-foot waves
[1:57:50] and somebody else is going through six
[1:57:52] foot waves but you're still in that
[1:57:53] storm
[1:57:55] let him speak or you stand him to say as
[1:57:58] God said peace be still because that's
[1:58:01] your part of the body you're part of him
[1:58:05] you know everything that you need to get
[1:58:08] from this natural life to eternal life
[1:58:12] lies within you in that seed which he
[1:58:17] said Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:58:23] so again just just to make Christians
[1:58:26] followers of Jesus Christ reflectors of
[1:58:30] Christ himself now we're looking in in
[1:58:36] just one more part here
[1:58:39] make sure I've got the right notes here
[1:58:42] because I just went through and I began
[1:58:46] to to look and see what each age was
[1:58:52] promised and in the first age he that
[1:59:03] overcometh shall not be hurt of the
[1:59:06] second death to the overcomer and the
[1:59:10] second age he said he that hath an ear
[1:59:12] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:59:14] the churches
[1:59:15] he that overcometh shall know I'm sorry
[1:59:18] I got these two mixed up
[1:59:20] he shall he that overcometh shall not be
[1:59:23] hurt of the second death
[1:59:24] to him that overcometh will I give to
[1:59:27] eat of the hidden manna and will give
[1:59:29] him a white stone and in the stone a new
[1:59:32] name written which no man knoweth saving
[1:59:35] he that receiveth to each age is given a
[1:59:38] promise and it culminates in this age
[1:59:42] here and he said and he that overcometh
[1:59:46] and keepeth my works unto the end to him
[1:59:49] will I give power over the nations and
[1:59:52] he shall rule them with a rod of iron as
[1:59:55] the vessels of a Potter they shall be
[1:59:57] broken to shivers even as I received of
[2:00:00] my father and will give him the morning
[2:00:03] star what promises we have of God to
[2:00:08] each one to each age brother Bram says
[2:00:10] they carry over the promises carry over
[2:00:12] into each age till there comes to his
[2:00:15] fullness he that overcometh the same
[2:00:21] shall be clothed in white raiment and
[2:00:23] will not and I will not blot out his
[2:00:25] name out of the book of life but I will
[2:00:28] confess his name before my father and
[2:00:30] before his angels
[2:00:32] could you imagine and who wants to be
[2:00:37] picked today to raise your hand sister
[2:00:39] Holly you didn't raise your hand your

[2:02:13] had not heard his and he was talking
[2:02:14] about a time in his life when he had
[2:02:17] moved from California here to Arizona
[2:02:18] and he had asked the Lord if the Lord
[2:02:21] could arrange for him to have five
[2:02:23] minutes with brother brown he said Lord
[2:02:25] if I could just have five minutes
[2:02:27] because he had a couple of questions he
[2:02:29] would like to ask so he said he was out
[2:02:31] working there and in there where they
[2:02:33] had the pecan girl been all and he he
[2:02:36] sees a car drive up but he's not paying
[2:02:38] too much attention to it because he's
[2:02:39] doing something and next thing you know
[2:02:42] brother branham is standing there next
[2:02:45] to him and he turns in you know he's

[2:03:07] had lunch and it was about ten of them
[2:03:09] they said they had and they went to a
[2:03:11] restaurant they sat there and she says I
[2:03:12] asked for five minutes I got five hours
[2:03:17] that's the God we serve he says I had
[2:03:21] three questions I asked because he had
[2:03:23] been raised Pentecostal had always been
[2:03:25] taught that that speaking in tongues was
[2:03:27] the evidence and he had some questions
[2:03:29] we're going down and driving down and
[2:03:31] I'm thinking I need to ask him I need to
[2:03:33] ask him and brother BAM turns around he
[2:03:35] goes now brother Joe about those three
[2:03:36] questions and these three scriptures you

[2:03:47] minister stands up and he says now let's
[2:03:49] open up these scriptures and he began
[2:03:51] saying you're saying Oh Lord do you know
[2:03:53] how much I needed to hear that today
[2:03:54] he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:03:56] today and forever he changes not he can
[2:04:00] use your brother he can use your sister
[2:04:03] he can use a sign sometimes on the side
[2:04:07] of the road a billboard it'll say Lord I
[2:04:10] needed that today open up the scripture
[2:04:13] of the day and you have some in your
[2:04:14] heart and there's the answer God is able
[2:04:17] to minister to him that overcometh will
[2:04:21] I grant to sit with me in my throne even
[2:04:24] as I also overcame in a set down with my
[2:04:28] father in his throne to the overcomer to
[2:04:33] God's children to his elect to his elect
[2:04:36] lady to his chosen one he said to that

[2:04:50] musicians would but come back up so when
[2:04:55] you get to looking in the mirror and you
[2:04:58] get to seeing yourself take another look
[2:05:01] at the mirror and see what God says
[2:05:03] about you said Lord let me see myself in
[2:05:07] the mirror God's Word the way you see me
[2:05:10] how you speak of me how you felt about
[2:05:14] me that while you were on the cross I
[2:05:17] was on your mind because you look for
[2:05:20] that portion of of you you wanted to
[2:05:23] restore he knew me and yet he loved me
[2:05:28] he had seen a finished product and he
[2:05:32] said they are mine these that you have
[2:05:35] given me our mind as he praising in in
[2:05:39] chapter 17 he knew me yet he loved me he
[2:05:42] whose glory makes a heaven shine a man
[2:05:48] do you love him today do you appreciate
[2:05:50] his goodness are you going to take his
[2:05:52] word what His Word says about you more
[2:05:54] than what you're feeling about yourself
[2:05:55] at times I got a little piece of news
[2:05:59] today and when I first heard it my first
[2:06:01] thought was I'm gonna quit my boss
[2:06:05] called me in me said you know how it's
[2:06:06] been a little bit slow and it has been
[2:06:08] work
[2:06:09] and he said the big boss in Phoenix
[2:06:12] called me and said I think we're gonna
[2:06:14] start using Aaron up in Phoenix he's
[2:06:16] gonna have to drive up to Phoenix now to
[2:06:18] work and I was I was hoping for the deer
[2:06:23] that everyday you know and I had told my
[2:06:28] wife I know things are gonna change work
[2:06:30] is slow they're gonna either let some
[2:06:32] people go or what and one of the service
[2:06:35] techs up in Phoenix is going to be going
[2:06:37] through is in the hospital of surgery
[2:06:38] and they said we'll just have Aaron come
[2:06:42] up here and work on some days but you'll
[2:06:44] probably be about 150 miles extra of
[2:06:46] driving and that's what went through my
[2:06:48] mind first Oh Lord no and after a little
[2:06:54] bit I said to my wife we've been
[2:06:56] expecting it God knows I don't need to
[2:06:58] trouble I don't need to lose sleep over
