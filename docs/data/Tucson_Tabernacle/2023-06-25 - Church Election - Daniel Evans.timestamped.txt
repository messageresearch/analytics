[17:03] yesterday evening I took a walk
[17:07] after the sun went down just wanted to
[17:09] get some quiet time and
[17:11] she's talking to the Lord and saying
[17:13] Lord you know he's never failed us he's
[17:15] never left us but sometimes you ask him
[17:17] Lord where are you
[17:20] I just talked to him and I was thinking
[17:22] about Tucson Tabernacle
[17:25] how many years has been how he brought
[17:27] brother green here to start it
[17:31] brother Greene had passed on and now
[17:33] Sister Green is gone but he's still
[17:35] alive

[17:41] many years ago and it's been quite some
[17:43] time now back there brother Lyle is in
[17:45] that Corners where I used to sit
[17:48] and and as a deacon there and I had lost
[17:51] some good friends and they had just
[17:53] moved away brothers and families that
[17:55] have moved
[17:56] seemed like every time I got a real
[17:58] close friend they went elsewhere for
[18:01] whatever reason it was
[18:03] I told the Lord I'm not making friends
[18:05] with anybody anymore I'm not going to
[18:07] get close friends because I keep losing
[18:09] them I was alien down there at that that
[18:12] chair
[18:15] and um
[18:17] in the message Jesus Christ is saying
[18:20] yesterday today and forever that
[18:22] Sunday that brother Brandon preached
[18:23] here
[18:25] the evening message
[18:27] 61. he prays over this this building he
[18:31] says may this little house here that
[18:33] we're in tonight be open till Jesus
[18:35] comes
[18:36] if he tarries may missionaries and
[18:39] ministers be sent from here to all over
[18:42] the world
[18:43] and as it may it truly be the house by
[18:46] the side of the road where the weary can
[18:48] come in and find rest
[18:52] and this is what he said to me
[18:54] so that's what you're here for
[18:56] to help the weary find rest to help them
[18:59] on their way
[19:00] so I was talking to him
[19:03] just walk in and I said Lord what and he
[19:06] reminded me of that he goes that's what
[19:08] you're here for do what you're here for
[19:11] so God knows all things we just have to
[19:15] trust in him rest in him

[24:07] [Music]
[24:20] good
[24:23] [Music]

[24:40] let's pray though do you have a request
[24:42] that you'd like to make known to the
[24:44] Lord with an uplifted hand
[24:46] [Music]
[24:47] Heavenly Father
[24:51] lord it's so sweet to fill your presence
[24:53] Among Us this morning
[24:55] Lord you see the crossroads that we've
[24:59] come to and
[25:01] you know the needs of the people better
[25:04] than I do Lord
[25:06] father the needs
[25:09] of each hand that was raised each desire
[25:13] Lord the request I wrote out this
[25:15] morning for our daughter Ruth it
[25:17] is still not a hundred percent
[25:21] father you're the great physician
[25:24] we have no one better to turn to than
[25:26] you so Lord we want to commit the
[25:28] requesting to your hands
[25:31] assets you reach forth
[25:33] and touch each need Lord whatever it may
[25:36] be to those that are out streaming
[25:39] on the phone hookup wherever they may be
[25:41] Lord just minister to the need
[25:45] and father as we would prepare to take
[25:47] the offering we pray Lord that you'd
[25:49] bless it for the furtherance of it
[25:52] your work Lord we'd ask
[25:55] and we give you thanks to ask that you
[25:57] be in the remainder of this service for
[26:00] your honor and your glory in Jesus
[26:02] Christ
[26:05] we'll take the offering here in just a
[26:07] second but while I'm here
[26:12] we have reached a very pivotal time
[26:15] in the assembly
[26:18] most of you know we've been without a
[26:20] pastor for for so long and
[26:23] now
[26:25] this morning we're going to vote for one
[26:28] I pray that you've prayed about it
[26:30] you've kept it in prayer this last week
[26:34] you know we're gonna we're gonna vote
[26:36] for brother Dan but what I would
[26:38] encourage is don't vote for him because
[26:40] you like them don't vote for him because
[26:42] he's your friend but vote for him
[26:43] because that's the way you feel God has
[26:45] led you to vote
[26:48] so I just want to go over the
[26:52] [Music]
[26:54] the qualifications
[26:56] to vote and and the first one is going
[26:59] to be for those
[27:02] of you that considered the Tabernacle
[27:04] your home Church
[27:05] [Music]
[27:07] secondly for those of you that support
[27:10] the church with your tithes and
[27:12] offerings
[27:12] [Music]
[27:16] those of you
[27:18] that are able to attend on a regular
[27:20] basis or as much as you possibly can and
[27:24] through your prayers
[27:26] and then we have it as
[27:29] those of you who are 18 or older
[27:33] the exception to this is are those who
[27:36] are 16 or older have a regular job and
[27:39] have met the criteria previously listed
[27:43] so if you're 17 don't feel that your
[27:45] voice don't count this is if this is
[27:47] your church and you
[27:49] call it your home
[27:50] [Music]
[27:51] your voice is important
[27:55] so
[27:57] be mindful be be prayerful this morning
[28:00] as we prepare to to place the vote for
[28:04] brother Dan
[28:07] I'm not going to say anything you know
[28:10] this way anyone one way or another but
[28:12] just be
[28:13] prayerful concerning this vote the Lord
[28:17] knows what we need in the church and I
[28:20] think the Lord is mindful of us he's
[28:22] kept us together for the last eight
[28:24] years and he's going to keep us together
[28:26] so if the brothers would come we'll take
[28:29] the offering
[28:31] [Music]
[28:42] will Walking
[28:45] [Music]
[28:53] walk where the dude

[58:25] [Music]
[58:47] [Music]
[59:01] God bless you brothers and sisters
[59:04] in the message
[59:08] indictment
[59:14] that was priesthood and
[59:17] 1963 July
[59:20] in the morning at Branham Tabernacle
[59:24] the prophet
[59:25] he carried some ordination
[59:29] and I want to read this quotation
[59:33] before we lay hands on our brother
[59:38] and I stand here
[59:40] as an ordained minister
[59:43] and
[59:45] Prophet says
[59:47] when we ordain these ministers
[59:51] by laying on of hands
[59:54] now we realize that scripture way
[59:58] of ordaining a minister
[1:00:00] is laying on of hands
[1:00:04] I think that's where our letter Reign
[1:00:06] Brethren or the battlefield people and
[1:00:09] so forth God mixed up
[1:00:11] and when they sin that laying on of
[1:00:14] hands to impart
[1:00:16] spiritual gifts
[1:00:18] now we do not believe that gifts come by
[1:00:23] laying of hands
[1:00:24] we believe that laying on of hands is
[1:00:28] sanction
[1:00:29] to what we've already seen
[1:00:33] see it's Amen
[1:00:37] now when they laid ends upon Timothy and
[1:00:40] upon those Brethren they had noticed in
[1:00:43] thee their man was the gift remember
[1:00:47] stir up that gift which was in you come
[1:00:50] from Grandmother Lois and they seen this
[1:00:54] in Timothy and therefore the elders laid
[1:00:58] hands upon him and ordained him not
[1:01:03] putting hands upon a man that nothing
[1:01:06] has ever been shown forth you see
[1:01:10] and they just ask the blessings and we
[1:01:13] all believe that so we don't impart
[1:01:15] spiritual gifts we only recognize them
[1:01:19] and lay hands upon them to sanction them
[1:01:23] that we believe that God has done such
[1:01:26] things for the people
[1:01:29] was faster than just to nail before us
[1:01:32] here and if all the elders we can come
[1:01:36] around him and as I'm saying I stand
[1:01:40] with our brothers here as an ordained
[1:01:43] minister
[1:01:44] and as an ordained pastor
[1:01:47] I was ordained as a minister as a pastor
[1:01:50] 18 years ago
[1:01:52] and with this blessing
[1:01:55] today we want to ordain our brother
[1:02:03] as he takes lead
[1:02:06] to lead this Tabernacle
[1:02:09] [Music]
[1:02:22] [Music]

[1:02:36] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:02:41] today The Hours come
[1:02:44] that has your servants

[1:02:52] upon the man that you have chosen
[1:02:56] the man in whom you have seen the gift
[1:03:01] after the going away of your servant the
[1:03:05] father Ministry Pastor Green resting
[1:03:08] somewhere
[1:03:09] in your Holy Land
[1:03:12] we bring our brother Dan
[1:03:15] today
[1:03:17] and ordain him
[1:03:19] as a pastor of Tucson Tabernacle
[1:03:23] by the thought of your children
[1:03:27] this is your will We Believe
[1:03:30] this is your desire We Believe
[1:03:34] father and as your servant
[1:03:38] I remember 18 years ago
[1:03:41] in the Republic of Botswana

[1:03:47] pastor in that town
[1:03:49] the same blessing today
[1:03:52] together with the Elders of this church
[1:03:55] we ordain our precious brother Daniel
[1:03:59] Evans as pastor of Tucson Tabernacle
[1:04:04] may you endure him with power and wisdom
[1:04:09] as he leads your people
[1:04:11] it has never been easy to lead your
[1:04:14] children
[1:04:16] the enemy is not happy
[1:04:19] he who is loose now upon him
[1:04:22] upon his family upon his children and
[1:04:26] upon this church
[1:04:28] but we have the anchor
[1:04:31] we have the god
[1:04:33] who can stand with him
[1:04:36] and granting the wisdom the same way you
[1:04:39] killed Solomon
[1:04:41] when he asked a favor from you
[1:04:44] Lord we pray
[1:04:46] bless our brother
[1:04:49] bless his wife
[1:04:51] bless his children
[1:04:54] bless the leaders that will stand with
[1:04:57] him
[1:04:58] in carrying out this order
[1:05:01] father
[1:05:03] as we have done it according to Moses
[1:05:06] according to Paul and according to the
[1:05:10] prophet of this end time
[1:05:12] we sanction the gift
[1:05:15] in the name
[1:05:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:20] receive his Blessing
[1:05:22] from this church

[1:05:30] we shall say
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:34] [Music]
[1:05:52] sister Stephanie
[1:05:56] you're the pastor's wife
[1:05:58] the Daniel
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:02] when God calls a man he calls his wife
[1:06:05] he calls us children
[1:06:22] brother Daniel
[1:06:26] and his wife they're all called doing
[1:06:28] this together
[1:06:29] so let's take a moment as a church to
[1:06:31] pray for them as a family
[1:06:34] Lord I
[1:06:36] it's a great step
[1:06:38] but as one as a man and as a family lord
[1:06:41] they're trusting in you
[1:06:43] so as a church a congregation we pray
[1:06:45] not only for brother Daniel
[1:06:47] but for sister Stephanie and Daniel his
[1:06:50] son Lord
[1:06:51] they will be watched everybody will have
[1:06:53] their eyes on them but Lord you said
[1:06:55] you'd be with them Lord so let there be
[1:06:58] a great example Lord and let us
[1:07:00] understand that they are human also Lord
[1:07:02] they need our prayers they need our
[1:07:04] encouragement Lord so we'll keep them
[1:07:06] that way before you in the name of the
[1:07:09] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:07:13] [Applause]
[1:07:20] [Music]
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:37] foreign
[1:07:49] God bless you all
[1:07:59] well
[1:08:01] there's not much to say
[1:08:03] but I can promise you one thing
[1:08:06] is I'll be praying for you all every day
[1:08:09] and
[1:08:11] I'm here to serve each one of you
[1:08:17] the Bible teaches us that a minister is
[1:08:19] a servant
[1:08:21] I think the pastor is he's the lowest of
[1:08:24] the low
[1:08:26] he's the one that
[1:08:29] comes up underneath everybody
[1:08:31] tries to hold him up that's
[1:08:34] going to be my
[1:08:35] Mission from here on out
[1:08:38] God bless you all and thank you very
[1:08:40] much thank you
[1:08:45] the um
[1:08:48] the enemy
[1:08:51] he
[1:08:53] does not like this
[1:08:57] he
[1:09:00] he hates us
[1:09:05] I knew I knew the enemy was going to
[1:09:07] come against us I didn't know didn't
[1:09:09] know how
[1:09:12] um
[1:09:14] but he if he came in the front door
[1:09:18] you see last night
[1:09:20] the enemy broke our window vandalized
[1:09:23] our church
[1:09:26] and uh he's a
[1:09:30] you know he's an adversary he hates us
[1:09:32] he gets upset he throws a fit he knows
[1:09:35] what's going to happen but let me tell
[1:09:37] you something he is a loser
[1:09:41] he lost the battle when our champion
[1:09:46] went to this cross
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:54] and he gets to punch at us all he wants
[1:09:56] but let me tell you something never be
[1:10:00] afraid of the devil he has no power over
[1:10:04] us only what the Lord allows him to have
[1:10:07] the Lord allowed that back window to be
[1:10:09] broken but you know what
[1:10:12] they couldn't even get in because there
[1:10:13] was another pane of glass that wouldn't
[1:10:16] break
[1:10:18] and that's how we are we may look like
[1:10:20] we're broken but there's another
[1:10:23] there's another Solid Rock right here
[1:10:26] and it's called the Holy Spirit and that
[1:10:29] will never break
[1:10:31] so Satan you can leave
[1:10:34] keep doing your thing whatever you want
[1:10:36] to do but you will not win and you have
[1:10:38] no place here
[1:10:40] not only that but I got a call this
[1:10:43] morning
[1:10:45] and uh
[1:10:46] Daniel
[1:10:48] his car broke down broke down on the car
[1:10:51] wash
[1:10:52] and it was like every single thing that
[1:10:57] could happen did and Daniel stuck he's
[1:11:00] like Dad I don't know what to do my
[1:11:02] car's here and and and I'm a nervous
[1:11:04] wreck anyways I always want to get to
[1:11:06] church early and and this kind of thing
[1:11:08] really really gets to me but
[1:11:11] let me tell you what happened this
[1:11:12] morning God knew
[1:11:14] what was going to happen he knew Daniel
[1:11:18] was going to get broken down in that in
[1:11:20] that car wash and and he knew that we
[1:11:24] were going to have to that I was going

[1:11:31] pick him up so you know what happened
[1:11:33] this morning
[1:11:34] before all this
[1:11:37] I think it's something
[1:11:38] I have searched the ancient texts
[1:11:43] and I have never seen it happen until
[1:11:46] this day
[1:11:49] my wife was an hour and a half early

[1:13:08] gives us Little Blessings like that he
[1:13:11] gave he gave us just me personally my
[1:13:14] family he gave us a little blessing this
[1:13:16] morning to tell you I love you
[1:13:18] I'm with you

[1:13:23] so blessed to have seen that this
[1:13:25] morning
[1:13:27] um
[1:13:28] another thing the enemy can come against
[1:13:30] us
[1:13:31] all he wants you know he broke the
[1:13:35] window and with the car and all of that
[1:13:37] but our word says that Jesus has keys to
[1:13:41] death hell in the grave
[1:13:44] my friend Daniel Martinez said you know
[1:13:46] that scripture
[1:13:47] and I said yeah he says Jesus has keys
[1:13:50] to death hell on the grave he says Satan
[1:13:52] doesn't even have keys to his own house
[1:13:56] amen that's that's the truth
[1:14:00] my uh my grandpa
[1:14:02] brother Welch Evans he um
[1:14:06] he was with brother Branham one time
[1:14:09] and
[1:14:11] someone had stolen my grandpa's car
[1:14:15] and he got the family they got to
[1:14:18] Brother bram's house they got the family
[1:14:20] together
[1:14:21] and they prayed
[1:14:23] and brother Branham said that they sent
[1:14:26] an angel of the Lord after that man to
[1:14:30] bring him back
[1:14:32] to bring him back and and to so the
[1:14:36] family would have something
[1:14:38] well I've been praying for a long time
[1:14:41] and I think that I might have that same
[1:14:43] gift
[1:14:44] because I've been praying for a long
[1:14:46] time in this morning
[1:14:48] the angel of the Lord had succeeded in
[1:14:51] bringing my friend back to us brother
[1:14:53] Jonathan
[1:14:59] all right he brought you back my friend
[1:15:03] it is so good it's so good to have you
[1:15:05] in service cousin Jonathan
[1:15:08] God bless you
[1:15:11] um you know friends
[1:15:13] it's it's important it's important that
[1:15:16] uh that we serve others
[1:15:19] and that's what I want this
[1:15:22] Church to be about I want that to be our
[1:15:24] foundation I really appreciate it but
[1:15:26] Aaron that quote you read the quote
[1:15:28] right this morning
[1:15:30] yeah that brother Aaron read earlier
[1:15:33] this morning that from Brother Branham
[1:15:35] about making this place I forgot the
[1:15:37] exact words was a place of Refuge
[1:15:41] that's what we need to be
[1:15:43] so even with all of the Satan going
[1:15:45] against us
[1:15:46] this morning and and
[1:15:49] all the adversary he also brought to us
[1:15:53] a brother that's had on his heart to
[1:15:56] serve the Lord and and he's he's new to
[1:16:00] us brother Edward God bless you my
[1:16:03] brother it's good to have you back there
[1:16:05] in the back raise your hand my brother
[1:16:07] good to have you my friend is it's been
[1:16:10] a long time since you've been a church
[1:16:13] somebody witnessed to you
[1:16:15] and invited you to come
[1:16:17] brother it's good to have you in church
[1:16:23] um
[1:16:24] as far as
[1:16:27] the church
[1:16:28] so now we have a pastor and we need to
[1:16:31] move forward on some things
[1:16:33] and one of the things that we need to
[1:16:36] have I believe as a church is we need to
[1:16:38] have church bylaws
[1:16:40] so I'll be praying about those and I
[1:16:43] didn't feel qualified until now to put a
[1:16:47] set of bylaws together
[1:16:49] so now I do
[1:16:51] so what we'll do is over the next few
[1:16:55] weeks I'm going to be praying about the
[1:16:57] bylaws I want to I want to put a set of
[1:16:59] church bylaws together and this is how
[1:17:00] we govern ourselves
[1:17:03] and once I get a draft of these bylaws
[1:17:05] I'll run it by the brethren
[1:17:08] I'll open it up for comments and
[1:17:11] suggestions on the bylaws
[1:17:13] we will put the bylaws up for a vote for
[1:17:17] the congregation
[1:17:18] I want it to be ratified by the
[1:17:20] congregation by a simple majority so we
[1:17:23] will be doing that fairly soon
[1:17:26] the next thing as far as the offices in
[1:17:28] the church
[1:17:30] will be separating the deacons and the
[1:17:34] trustees and the church right now these
[1:17:36] brothers have have been pillars in the
[1:17:39] church and holding this place up and
[1:17:41] keeping these doors open and and being a
[1:17:45] blessing to us so what we will do in the
[1:17:48] near future is we will have deacons and
[1:17:53] trustees
[1:17:55] and those will also be confirmed by the
[1:17:58] church by by a simple majority vote of
[1:18:01] the church I'd like to get all of this
[1:18:03] done within a month of today
[1:18:06] and have those those positions
[1:18:08] officially in place
[1:18:11] um another thing that I haven't felt
[1:18:13] comfortable in doing yet is um
[1:18:18] is the church finances what we will do
[1:18:21] in the near future also is we will be
[1:18:25] posting some side of some sort of a
[1:18:28] financial statement maybe quarterly for
[1:18:30] the church so you know what's going on
[1:18:32] so you know
[1:18:34] um the basics as far as the church
[1:18:37] finances
[1:18:39] um
[1:18:41] a brother suggested to me
[1:18:44] recently that we also have board meeting
[1:18:47] notes and make sure that those notes are
[1:18:50] also available to the congregation so we
[1:18:54] will also be doing I think that's a good
[1:18:55] idea I think it's according to the word
[1:18:57] so we will also be doing that
[1:19:00] um we'll we'll make
[1:19:02] um our meeting notes when we have board
[1:19:04] meetings available to the congregation
[1:19:06] in some shape or fashion I don't know
[1:19:07] how we will do it either um
[1:19:10] we can send it out through WhatsApp I
[1:19:12] don't necessarily feel to put it on the
[1:19:13] public website
[1:19:15] so we'll we'll figure out some way to
[1:19:17] get that information to you so you
[1:19:18] you're staying up with that
[1:19:21] um
[1:19:22] in in the near future I'd like to get
[1:19:25] this room done back here there's room
[1:19:29] for the um for the Youth for the younger
[1:19:32] years
[1:19:33] I think it's going to be real blessing
[1:19:34] it's really in my heart to um to have
[1:19:37] that for not only for the little ones
[1:19:40] but also for the mothers so the kids
[1:19:43] when they can come outside that they
[1:19:46] have a place to fellowship and enjoy
[1:19:49] themselves that's out of the Heat and
[1:19:51] the mothers don't have to sit
[1:19:53] um out in the and fathers and all of us
[1:19:56] don't have have to have a have to sit
[1:19:58] out in the heat so I want to do that I'm
[1:20:00] going to need some help from the
[1:20:01] brothers
[1:20:03] I'll pray about uh
[1:20:06] also
[1:20:07] I would like to have another men's
[1:20:10] meeting I really enjoyed the one that we
[1:20:12] had before
[1:20:15] so I'll tentatively try to schedule that
[1:20:19] for next Friday but I'm not sure I'll
[1:20:21] send it out on WhatsApp and what we'll
[1:20:24] talk about there is we'll talk about
[1:20:27] um
[1:20:27] some some things I have on my heart for
[1:20:29] outreach
[1:20:30] and I'd also like to ask the brothers to
[1:20:34] help me with some projects number one
[1:20:36] being this room in the lower level in
[1:20:40] the in the school room out there
[1:20:44] um
[1:20:45] I'm really friends I'm I am humbled
[1:20:50] and I am excited
[1:20:52] about what the Lord's doing
[1:20:56] I am not only in the work of the church
[1:21:01] on the outward
[1:21:03] in in getting these things done but also
[1:21:06] what the Lord's doing spiritually
[1:21:09] and how I believe that he has his hand
[1:21:11] on us and even with that broken window
[1:21:14] this morning
[1:21:16] I can see that Satan hates this
[1:21:20] that didn't come from God
[1:21:22] that broken window that came from the
[1:21:25] Devil Himself
[1:21:27] and we need to understand that he is
[1:21:31] going to come against us in every way
[1:21:35] that he can
[1:21:36] I've said often that
[1:21:38] that God's hands to do his work
[1:21:43] God's hands are these hands right here
[1:21:47] the hands that you have and the hands
[1:21:49] that I have those are God's hands but
[1:21:52] let me tell you something else Satan's
[1:21:54] hands also
[1:21:57] are the hands of human beings
[1:22:00] there's two Spirits at War here and
[1:22:03] they've been at War since the dawn of
[1:22:04] time
[1:22:06] and these two spirits will be at War
[1:22:08] Until the End one day soon
[1:22:11] the losing spirit that of Satan will be
[1:22:15] cast into this Lake of Fire and it will
[1:22:18] be destroyed
[1:22:20] in the hands of God that the anointing
[1:22:23] upon the hands of God will prevail
[1:22:27] and introduce eternal life to all of us
[1:22:31] but in the in the meantime while we are
[1:22:33] here remember there's two Spirits
[1:22:36] working back and forth and make sure
[1:22:38] that our hands and our mouths
[1:22:41] and everything that about about us are
[1:22:44] working for God and not and not for the
[1:22:47] enemy
[1:22:48] I wanted
[1:22:51] before I won't I have a sermon prepared
[1:22:53] but
[1:22:55] um I'll put it off to another time
[1:22:57] but I did want to talk about
[1:23:01] about the church and the unity
[1:23:05] and for everyone to understand
[1:23:09] that how the vote took place I think it
[1:23:13] was wonderful I think it was it was it
[1:23:15] was a decisive
[1:23:17] word from the church and I had told the
[1:23:20] brothers that if it was anywhere close
[1:23:23] what I would do
[1:23:25] is I would accept the position but I
[1:23:28] would immediately start working to try
[1:23:30] to get someone else here that could get
[1:23:34] a vote like we got today
[1:23:35] but the vote was decisive
[1:23:38] and I believe the congregation put me
[1:23:42] into this position I believe not only
[1:23:43] congregation I believe the Lord Jesus
[1:23:45] put me here and I have confidence that
[1:23:48] he did it
[1:23:49] there are there were the
[1:23:52] far more votes for than there were
[1:23:55] against but I want to I want everyone to
[1:23:58] do me a favor
[1:24:00] don't say one word
[1:24:03] about who do you think voted against him
[1:24:08] don't do that that will do no good don't
[1:24:12] even let it come up in your
[1:24:13] conversations
[1:24:14] because I am here to serve everyone in
[1:24:20] this building and whoever couldn't make
[1:24:21] it no matter no matter if you like me or
[1:24:24] you don't like me it doesn't matter I am
[1:24:27] at your service I am here to serve you
[1:24:30] because I believe that is the role of a
[1:24:32] minister
[1:24:34] and we don't know who voted two and and
[1:24:37] four I'll probably get with brother
[1:24:39] Jordan afterwards to see if we can see
[1:24:41] who voted against on the cameras
[1:24:46] I'm glad you laughed
[1:24:49] there was a pause
[1:24:53] [Laughter]
[1:24:54] I'm just kidding
[1:24:56] but don't
[1:24:58] don't say anything against any any of
[1:25:02] your brothers or sisters friends
[1:25:04] there is there's no reason
[1:25:07] to do it we are together in this no
[1:25:10] matter if we have an opinion about I
[1:25:12] like this Minister I don't like that
[1:25:13] Minister I don't agree with his Doctrine
[1:25:16] I don't I don't I like his Doctrine it
[1:25:19] doesn't matter because we are together
[1:25:22] in this battle and we have a common
[1:25:24] enemy
[1:25:26] and that enemy hates us
[1:25:28] and we need to stand together against
[1:25:31] that enemy and only through unity and
[1:25:34] I'll read a scripture here in a little
[1:25:36] bit only through Unity where we be able
[1:25:39] to get through this
[1:25:41] it's something that Christ himself
[1:25:44] prayed for
[1:25:48] Brothers I'm sorry
[1:25:49] uh we don't I don't have any notes for
[1:25:52] you
[1:25:54] um but I would like to I would like to
[1:25:56] read a scripture
[1:25:58] let's all stand if you could
[1:26:02] foreign
[1:26:03] and let's go to
[1:26:08] let's read John chapter 17.
[1:26:15] I'm going to start with verse 14.
[1:26:24] it says this
[1:26:29] I have given them Thy word this is by
[1:26:32] the way
[1:26:33] this is our Lord and savior
[1:26:38] pray
[1:26:40] for his people
[1:26:41] this is Jesus Christ
[1:26:44] In The Garden of Gethsemane
[1:26:47] and he is praying for his people and the
[1:26:50] next day he was going to be on the cross
[1:26:55] here his closing words as he prays for
[1:26:58] us
[1:27:01] I have given them Thy Word
[1:27:05] and the word and the world
[1:27:08] have hated them
[1:27:10] because they are not of the world
[1:27:12] even as I am not of the world
[1:27:16] I pray not that thou shouldest take them
[1:27:18] out of the world but that thou should
[1:27:21] has keep them from the evil
[1:27:24] they are not of the world
[1:27:27] even as I Jesus speaking am not of the
[1:27:31] world
[1:27:34] sanctify them through thy truth
[1:27:37] Thy word is truth
[1:27:41] as thou Hast sent me into the world
[1:27:45] even so have I also sent them into the
[1:27:51] world
[1:27:54] and for their sakes listen to this very
[1:27:57] sad statement he's about to make
[1:27:59] speaking to the Lord speaking to his
[1:28:02] father
[1:28:08] says this
[1:28:09] and for their sakes
[1:28:11] I sanctify myself
[1:28:14] that they also might be Sanctified
[1:28:17] through the truth Jesus gave everything
[1:28:22] a young man 33 years old lived his life
[1:28:25] perfect before God which none of us no
[1:28:28] one has ever done in the history of the
[1:28:29] world
[1:28:30] lived a life perfect
[1:28:33] before God
[1:28:34] for our sakes
[1:28:39] I'll read it again and and for their
[1:28:42] sakes I sanctify myself that they also
[1:28:45] might be Sanctified through the truth
[1:28:48] neither pray I for these alone
[1:28:51] but for them also which Shall Believe on
[1:28:54] me
[1:28:55] through their word
[1:28:57] he's praying for Tucson Tabernacle right
[1:28:59] there
[1:29:00] he's praying for each of us
[1:29:03] the people in this room
[1:29:06] that they all may be one
[1:29:12] as thou father art in me
[1:29:15] and I in thee
[1:29:17] that they also may be one in us that the
[1:29:22] world may believe that thou Hast sent me
[1:29:27] look at the importance of that prayer
[1:29:29] that Jesus says that they may be one
[1:29:32] that the world might believe
[1:29:35] that thou has sent me
[1:29:38] and the glory which thou gave us me
[1:29:41] I have given them
[1:29:45] that they may be one even as We Are One
[1:29:49] i in them
[1:29:51] thou in me
[1:29:53] that they may be PR may be made perfect
[1:29:56] in one and that the world may know that
[1:30:00] thou has sent me
[1:30:02] and has loved them
[1:30:04] as thou Hast loved me
[1:30:06] may the Lord add the blessings to the
[1:30:08] reading of his word you can take your
[1:30:09] seeds
[1:30:14] and what Jesus just said
[1:30:18] and those blessed scriptures in our
[1:30:21] Bible and read
[1:30:26] our Unity
[1:30:28] in this church
[1:30:31] our love for each other
[1:30:35] will be our greatest witness of Christ
[1:30:38] to the world
[1:30:41] there Jesus is praying and he says Lord
[1:30:45] I pray
[1:30:47] that they may be one that they may be
[1:30:49] United that they may love each other
[1:30:51] that they may stand together so that all
[1:30:54] the world might know that I am the
[1:30:56] Messiah
[1:30:58] because of our love one for another
[1:31:03] sister Heather or sister Heather sister
[1:31:05] Heather sister Heather showed me a a
[1:31:07] text
[1:31:10] she
[1:31:12] opened up her home and and and welcomed
[1:31:16] someone in as a Christian would do
[1:31:22] and she showed me this morning this
[1:31:25] young lady's response and she talked
[1:31:27] about how warm the spirit is and how
[1:31:30] much of a blessing it was to see a
[1:31:32] church like this
[1:31:35] a witness
[1:31:37] of Jesus Christ himself because of the
[1:31:41] kindness
[1:31:42] of a person
[1:31:45] and we see how
[1:31:47] as Jesus was down there praying the
[1:31:50] Bible says he was suffering so bad that
[1:31:53] as he was praying the the blood came out
[1:31:57] of his skin and praying
[1:32:00] I don't know what suffering like that is
[1:32:02] I've never I could never even think
[1:32:05] about how bad he was suffering
[1:32:07] this wasn't going to his death
[1:32:10] the next day this was carrying the sins
[1:32:14] of the whole world on his shoulders
[1:32:18] and there he is praying in this Garden
[1:32:21] knowing exactly what was going to happen
[1:32:23] his his close friend betrayed him
[1:32:26] thinking about that
[1:32:29] thinking about Lord
[1:32:30] these disciples that I've I've taught
[1:32:33] and I've taught him in this direction
[1:32:35] these Lord take care of them
[1:32:39] he was worried about other people
[1:32:43] the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:32:46] Lord let them love one another
[1:32:51] and then he says in another place he
[1:32:53] says
[1:32:55] that the world will know
[1:32:58] that God will know that you're my
[1:32:59] disciples
[1:33:01] by your loved one for another
[1:33:06] and coming in to this church and now we
[1:33:10] have a new beginning
[1:33:16] it's strange
[1:33:18] that sister green passed away
[1:33:21] just
[1:33:22] a few days ago
[1:33:25] and
[1:33:27] taking communion with her and
[1:33:30] and fellowshipping with sister Karen
[1:33:33] sister Karen sent me the nicest text
[1:33:34] this morning
[1:33:36] saying she was praying for me
[1:33:38] how much that meant
[1:33:39] brother Green's daughter
[1:33:42] saying that to me
[1:33:45] and and going and seeing sister green
[1:33:48] there in the bed and taking communion
[1:33:51] with with the brothers and sisters and
[1:33:53] how we win and how sweet sister Rachel
[1:33:55] she was so sweet wasn't she
[1:33:57] just it was just precious and then
[1:34:01] she goes and then we make this move as a
[1:34:04] church I think maybe the Lord
[1:34:07] was giving her peace
[1:34:10] that this was going to be okay and
[1:34:11] everything that she had worked for all
[1:34:14] the labors that that sister had put in
[1:34:17] brother green had put into building this
[1:34:19] church and building this ministry not
[1:34:21] just here but worldwide in all how many
[1:34:24] people know what they did
[1:34:29] and now we are tasked with carrying this
[1:34:32] on
[1:34:34] and I want to do my best
[1:34:37] I want to continue
[1:34:39] this church and I wanted to move forward
[1:34:43] and I wanted to grow not necessarily not
[1:34:46] with people from coming from the
[1:34:48] different message churches prosely
[1:34:50] lighting but I wanted to grow from
[1:34:52] people that need a church
[1:34:55] people that love one another
[1:34:57] people who need it for their children
[1:35:00] people that need it for their brothers
[1:35:02] and their sisters people that may have
[1:35:04] left a long time ago that may have been
[1:35:06] hurt
[1:35:08] I want to see a church that welcomes
[1:35:09] them with open arms
[1:35:11] say no we're not we're not going to hold
[1:35:13] anything against we're not going to
[1:35:14] judge you
[1:35:15] We're Not Gonna We're Not Gonna critique
[1:35:17] the way you look we're not going to
[1:35:19] attack you in certain ways you come here
[1:35:21] and because you're going to find Jesus
[1:35:23] Christ Among Us
[1:35:25] you're going to find the spirit
[1:35:29] that was prophesied to come
[1:35:32] you're gonna find it here and you're and
[1:35:34] that spirit is based on love
[1:35:38] and that's what I want people to see
[1:35:41] when they come to this church
[1:35:44] do you have that quote
[1:35:46] do you have it with you
[1:35:47] I'd like to read it again if you could
[1:35:50] brother Aaron
[1:35:52] brother and read that quote I just feel
[1:35:54] that it's
[1:35:56] it's a good one to read
[1:36:01] I love
[1:36:05] I love peace
[1:36:07] I love unity
[1:36:09] you know when when I live my life I want
[1:36:11] to be happy
[1:36:13] I want to thank you brother I think
[1:36:17] I think I want to enjoy life
[1:36:21] and
[1:36:23] God wants us to also
[1:36:26] but you know what's going to take that
[1:36:28] Joy away from us is sin
[1:36:33] if we make mistakes and we go down the
[1:36:35] wrong road
[1:36:37] it's going to make our lives miserable
[1:36:40] so we need to to be doing everything
[1:36:43] that we can working for the Lord seeking
[1:36:46] the Lord and understanding what he wants
[1:36:48] us to do and that is the role of a
[1:36:50] church it's the role of a pastor not to
[1:36:54] dictate the people how to live how to
[1:36:56] live their life
[1:36:57] you're not going to find me telling you
[1:37:00] don't do this and do this you're not
[1:37:04] going to find me pulling out the
[1:37:05] measuring stick and in a in a series of
[1:37:07] rules you're not going to find me doing
[1:37:09] that what you're going to find me doing
[1:37:11] is saying you got to get to Christ
[1:37:14] because I'll fail
[1:37:17] I've failed so many times in my life and
[1:37:19] you know what I'm going to continue to
[1:37:20] fail but he's never failed if we could
[1:37:23] just get people to Jesus Christ if we
[1:37:26] can get them to him and they can start
[1:37:28] communicating with Christ then that joy
[1:37:31] that we have will be in them
[1:37:34] and that's what I want that's the desire
[1:37:36] and I pray oh God give it to us
[1:37:39] that way if there's a sickness
[1:37:43] if you have a relationship with Christ
[1:37:46] you can go and pray for that person and
[1:37:49] there will be healing
[1:37:51] if there's someone that's that's lost or
[1:37:53] someone that
[1:37:54] that needs counsel
[1:37:57] you can do it if you are communicating
[1:38:00] with him
[1:38:03] but if if you're just waiting for
[1:38:07] someone to dictate in your life
[1:38:11] what to do
[1:38:13] you're not going to get it from me
[1:38:16] I am going to tell you get to Christ
[1:38:20] I'll tell you what the word says
[1:38:22] believe me
[1:38:24] I'll tell you what the word says about
[1:38:27] any subject that that I see that's in
[1:38:30] here I'm not afraid of anything that
[1:38:31] this book says
[1:38:33] and I will present it the best that I
[1:38:35] know how but this whole book is pointed
[1:38:39] there's one purpose
[1:38:42] in this whole book and that is to
[1:38:44] introduce us to our Savior
[1:38:48] from Genesis to Revelation the whole
[1:38:51] thing is to introduce us to Christ
[1:38:54] and he is our savior
[1:38:58] else
[1:39:00] it's just a book
[1:39:04] but it's meant to get us to the Lord
[1:39:11] I want to read a quote
[1:39:13] from Brother Branham
[1:39:15] it's a lengthy quote
[1:39:21] Brothers It's Christ is the mystery of
[1:39:23] God revealed
[1:39:26] I gave you I gave you that um it should
[1:39:28] be on my email
[1:39:34] brother Branham says this
[1:39:38] he says love one another
[1:39:41] above everything love one another
[1:39:44] no matter what the devil tries to say
[1:39:46] now you're all one great big sweet group
[1:39:49] now but remember my warning see Satan
[1:39:52] won't let that stay that way
[1:39:55] no sir he'll shoot everything if he
[1:39:58] everything if he has to bring somebody
[1:40:01] in to make his Target
[1:40:04] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in
[1:40:07] and set him down and cause him to
[1:40:10] fellowship with you under quietness and
[1:40:12] things and then he'll shoot that guy
[1:40:14] with some kind of poison stuff and he'll
[1:40:16] start through the church with it
[1:40:20] don't you take sides with it
[1:40:23] don't you have nothing to do with it
[1:40:24] don't you have nothing to do with
[1:40:26] anything else you stay right loving and
[1:40:29] sweet and kind to one another pray for
[1:40:31] that man that he'll be saved too or that
[1:40:34] woman or ever who it is just pray for
[1:40:36] them and stick one with another
[1:40:40] and stay with your pastor see he's the
[1:40:42] shepherd and you give him respects he'll
[1:40:45] lead you through because he's ordained
[1:40:47] of God to do so now you remember that
[1:40:49] the enemy will come and when he does
[1:40:52] just cling that much closer together
[1:40:57] and the one that the devil is using for
[1:41:00] an enemy will either get out or come in
[1:41:03] and be one of you that's all
[1:41:06] don't ever Clan
[1:41:07] among one or talk or make yourself
[1:41:10] clannish We Are One
[1:41:13] I couldn't say left hand
[1:41:15] I'm mad at you and I'm going to take you
[1:41:16] away because you're not a right hand
[1:41:19] he's my left hand
[1:41:21] I want him to stay there
[1:41:23] even the little tip of of my finger I
[1:41:26] want to stay there every little part of
[1:41:30] my body to stay right there and God
[1:41:32] wants us as a body of Believers to stay
[1:41:35] right exactly with one another right at
[1:41:40] with one another
[1:41:42] and now you've got tapes on that
[1:41:45] you've got tapes on what we believe
[1:41:47] you've got tapes on discipline in the
[1:41:50] church how do we behave ourselves in the
[1:41:52] Church of God how we got to come
[1:41:54] together and sit together in Heavenly
[1:41:56] places don't stay home
[1:42:00] if God is in your heart
[1:42:02] you can't hardly wait for them doors to
[1:42:05] open out yonder to get he in here to
[1:42:08] fellowship with your brothers I want
[1:42:10] that love friends
[1:42:11] oh
[1:42:13] if you don't don't feel that way then I
[1:42:17] tell you it's time you got to praying
[1:42:20] because we're in the last days where the
[1:42:21] Bible
[1:42:22] exalted or exhorted us to quote much
[1:42:26] more as we see that day approaching he's
[1:42:29] quoting Hebrews the love
[1:42:32] one another with Christian love and
[1:42:35] divine love to assemble ourselves
[1:42:37] together in Heavenly places and Christ
[1:42:39] Jesus and love one another this will all
[1:42:42] men know you are my disciples when you
[1:42:45] have love one for another that's right
[1:42:48] stay right together
[1:42:51] if the brother you think he's a little
[1:42:53] wrong
[1:42:54] or the sister say Lord
[1:42:57] don't let me never have the root of
[1:43:00] bitterness spring up
[1:43:05] because it'll affect him and it'll take
[1:43:08] the Christ right out of my life
[1:43:12] that poison acids of malice and jealousy
[1:43:15] and hatred that will take that will just
[1:43:18] take the Holy Spirit right away from you
[1:43:20] it will run him from the Tabernacle here
[1:43:22] it'll kill kill the spirit of God or
[1:43:25] drive it away from here hurt your pastor
[1:43:27] it'll do everything so don't you do that
[1:43:32] you just wax that much closer together
[1:43:36] draw up the take the Buckle as the
[1:43:39] brother testified a minister here the
[1:43:41] other night about having a buckle seeing
[1:43:43] it in a vision just that buckles on the
[1:43:46] whole armor of God just pull her on
[1:43:50] tighten her up move right up close to
[1:43:52] one another love one another anyhow talk
[1:43:56] nice about one another say nice things
[1:43:59] about one another and then God will
[1:44:02] bless you amen
[1:44:05] look at the Holy Spirit
[1:44:07] operating right there in brother Brandon
[1:44:10] The Same Spirit as Jesus prayed in the
[1:44:12] Garden of Gethsemane
[1:44:14] Lord let them be one let them love one
[1:44:16] another warned us as Jesus warned them
[1:44:19] that Satan's going to come in he warned
[1:44:22] Peter that Satan sought to sift you like
[1:44:24] wheat
[1:44:25] but I prayed for you Peter
[1:44:27] and the same with us
[1:44:29] he wants every one of us he hates us
[1:44:35] he ultimately wants to take our lives
[1:44:39] but we should stand one for another
[1:44:42] praying one for another all together in
[1:44:46] this gospel
[1:44:48] loving one another
[1:44:51] so we voted
[1:44:54] and
[1:44:56] we set a path to move forward
[1:44:59] and I'm going to do the best that I can
[1:45:00] as I said some of the things I want to
[1:45:02] do that are on my heart I ask you to
[1:45:04] support me
[1:45:06] help me
[1:45:08] not just same but Daniel behind you but
[1:45:12] help me
[1:45:13] we need to have a church that is working
[1:45:17] together and and pushing forward not
[1:45:21] serving ourselves
[1:45:23] but serving others
[1:45:25] and that's when we'll see the church
[1:45:28] grow and it has been growing I mean look
[1:45:30] at look at how many more people are here
[1:45:31] now than there were a little while ago
[1:45:33] and it'll continue to grow
[1:45:36] but only if we have that love
[1:45:40] I would rather have
[1:45:43] that right spirit
[1:45:45] that right love
[1:45:47] and the wrong Doctrine
[1:45:49] and you know what I'm saying
[1:45:52] then have the right Doctrine
[1:45:55] and have that wrong spirit that wrong
[1:45:58] way
[1:46:00] about me be wrong in my heart think the
[1:46:02] prophet said this he he said I would
[1:46:05] rather be right in my heart
[1:46:10] and wrong in my Doctrine then right in
[1:46:13] my Doctrine and wrong in my heart
[1:46:16] or his I believe his exact words
[1:46:19] yes and that's where we need to be right
[1:46:22] in our hearts loving one another
[1:46:28] um
[1:46:30] I'm so grateful
[1:46:32] I want to feel that excitement
[1:46:35] friends I feel I feel good
[1:46:38] but sometimes when you're up here
[1:46:43] it's nice when I hear that you're
[1:46:45] feeling good too
[1:46:47] so so you can say Amen every once in a
[1:46:50] while
[1:46:51] and I like brother Jonathan every once
[1:46:53] in a while he'll give a clap offering
[1:46:54] before the Lord
[1:46:56] let's friends let's let's be
[1:46:59] enthusiastic
[1:47:01] because not fake not work it up you know
[1:47:04] I've seen you know I don't have to get
[1:47:05] up here and do jumping jacks in front of
[1:47:07] you and you don't have to do them in the
[1:47:08] Pew that's not real
[1:47:10] but something that's real
[1:47:12] and saying in in agreeing and and
[1:47:15] putting your shoulder
[1:47:18] to the stone to push and to work
[1:47:24] I wanna
[1:47:25] the next time I minister
[1:47:28] I want to minister if the Lord's willing
[1:47:32] on
[1:47:34] and this is what I prepared for this
[1:47:35] morning but if the musicians could come
[1:47:38] and we'll close
[1:47:40] but I want to minister on this book of
[1:47:43] Galatians
[1:47:45] and in the first two chapters
[1:47:49] in the book
[1:47:51] Paul is addressing a very serious
[1:47:54] problem
[1:47:56] that problem is
[1:47:59] it's manifested itself
[1:48:02] Paul is writing this letter back to the
[1:48:05] brethren in that part of the world
[1:48:08] and
[1:48:09] it ties in perfectly
[1:48:12] with this study on the book of Acts that
[1:48:15] we've been talking about and especially
[1:48:18] about my sermon on Wednesday
[1:48:21] and
[1:48:22] what it is
[1:48:25] the enemy
[1:48:28] had because he always does he always
[1:48:31] will
[1:48:32] he got in there
[1:48:34] and he started causing problems
[1:48:37] he started
[1:48:40] causing people to look down on each
[1:48:43] other
[1:48:44] because he caused people to be critical
[1:48:48] of one another
[1:48:51] and friends it's pretty amazing
[1:48:54] what those those uh criticisms are about
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:49:00] he'll be you'll be um probably surprised
[1:49:06] and when Paul said and I think of of
[1:49:09] this man
[1:49:10] he said though we
[1:49:13] or an angel from heaven
[1:49:16] preach any other gospel than that which
[1:49:18] we have already preached to you
[1:49:21] let him be accursed
[1:49:24] I think that was only
[1:49:26] an apostle of God that could say
[1:49:29] something like that but he was
[1:49:31] addressing a conflict in the church
[1:49:36] murmuring in the church fighting in the
[1:49:40] church confusion in the church about
[1:49:43] something that you would never imagine
[1:49:46] what it was and it was taking God's word
[1:49:50] and attacking each other with it
[1:49:55] very serious
[1:49:59] I don't have time
[1:50:00] to minister on it today
[1:50:03] but I will if the Lord's willing if he
[1:50:06] wants me to preach it I will I'll preach
[1:50:10] about that next Sunday
[1:50:12] [Music]
[1:50:13] but for now
[1:50:15] let's just enjoy each other's company
[1:50:17] friends just love one another I know all
[1:50:20] of these disciples when when they got
[1:50:22] old
[1:50:23] when uh when they wrote their Epistles
[1:50:27] love was the main thing read first
[1:50:30] second and third John oh little children
[1:50:32] love one another
[1:50:34] love love love love love love
[1:50:35] wasn't all these
[1:50:38] we love the Deep doctrines and and we
[1:50:40] should study them if God gave them to us
[1:50:42] we should study them
[1:50:44] we should understand them
[1:50:47] but when it comes down to it
[1:50:50] love is the Capstone
[1:50:55] First Corinthians chapter 13.
[1:50:57] it says though I have all of these
[1:51:00] things and all these Revelations and all
[1:51:02] these these this great faith and if I
[1:51:05] don't have love I am nothing
[1:51:09] that's what we need to have
[1:51:10] I want you
[1:51:13] and ordained me as pastor
[1:51:16] but now I want each of you
[1:51:19] say
[1:51:21] okay Lord we've we've done this step
[1:51:26] but now
[1:51:28] it's up to me
[1:51:30] I have a role in this
[1:51:32] and we can't until every
[1:51:36] piece is in place
[1:51:38] we can't there's no perfection
[1:51:41] I told the story about a puzzle
[1:51:44] and how you take all of the there's this
[1:51:47] big pile you take the box and you open
[1:51:49] it up and you pile and there's this big
[1:51:51] pile
[1:51:52] of these puzzle pieces and they all look
[1:51:55] the same
[1:51:56] it's like what in the world how am I
[1:51:59] gonna put this together
[1:52:01] and then you go and you look at them the
[1:52:03] picture that's on the box
[1:52:06] and you start getting the
[1:52:08] the ones with the straight edge you know
[1:52:11] it's like oh they're all they're
[1:52:12] different this one has a different color
[1:52:14] where's the color on here
[1:52:16] and here's the master
[1:52:18] and the master is he's taking this
[1:52:20] puzzle and he's putting each one in
[1:52:24] place oh this one has part of the
[1:52:26] sunshine in it this one has part of a
[1:52:28] foot this one has part the top of the
[1:52:31] mountain and he's placing them
[1:52:33] and it pretty soon it becomes it's no
[1:52:36] more this pile of pieces
[1:52:39] now it's forming this masterpiece of God
[1:52:45] and that's how we are
[1:52:47] and we need to be willing to be placed
[1:52:50] wherever he wants us to be placed
[1:52:54] I feel like
[1:52:56] I just got placed
[1:52:59] this morning
[1:53:02] [Applause]
[1:53:07] but no one piece is any more important
[1:53:10] than any other
[1:53:12] but God places us and let's complete
[1:53:15] this puzzle
[1:53:17] will you friends
[1:53:20] let's bow our heads let's not stand yet
[1:53:22] let's bow our heads
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:28] as we think
[1:53:32] on the future
[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:53:36] now we've made this decision
[1:53:38] [Music]
[1:53:40] but that's just that's just one piece
[1:53:42] and there may have there may be pieces
[1:53:44] already placed already in operation but
[1:53:46] there are still many many pieces that
[1:53:48] need to be placed in this puzzle
[1:53:51] in this masterpiece
[1:53:53] so friends think about your place
[1:53:56] where God wants you
[1:53:59] to be placed
[1:54:01] and don't neglect his leading in your
[1:54:04] life
[1:54:06] he loves you
[1:54:08] he loves me
[1:54:12] he knows Satan hates us and he's
[1:54:14] protecting us
[1:54:16] Satan the thing that he does not want to
[1:54:19] do is he does not want you in that place
[1:54:21] that God's God has ordained for you to
[1:54:24] be
[1:54:27] so I ask
[1:54:30] if you're willing
[1:54:34] to be placed wherever God wants you to
[1:54:37] be not where you want to be not where I
[1:54:40] want to be
[1:54:41] but if you're willing
[1:54:43] to be placed where God wants you to be
[1:54:48] would you make an offering to God today
[1:54:50] and just raise your hand before him
[1:54:54] say Lord I surrender to you
[1:54:58] wherever you want me to be
[1:55:00] I want you to place me in that position
[1:55:04] thank you
[1:55:06] [Music]
[1:55:10] Lord God
[1:55:13] I had my head bowed and my eyes closed
[1:55:16] so Lord I don't know how many hands were
[1:55:18] raised
[1:55:19] but I know my hand was raised
[1:55:21] [Music]
[1:55:23] I pray father that
[1:55:27] that each hand that was raised that you
[1:55:29] would honor that
[1:55:31] and Lord that you would Place us
[1:55:33] and that we could be a blessing
[1:55:36] Lord a blessing to each other
[1:55:39] a blessing to those that are outside a
[1:55:42] blessing to the neighborhood a blessing
[1:55:44] to our neighborhoods a blessing to
[1:55:46] everyone that we come into contact
[1:55:47] everyone that walks by this church Lord
[1:55:50] may it be a blessing to them
[1:55:53] may we stand
[1:55:56] for our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:56:01] Lord we commit it to you
[1:56:04] and ask Lord that you would lead us
[1:56:10] leave as Joshua
[1:56:12] said let this ark go before you because
[1:56:14] you've you haven't been this way before
[1:56:19] so Lord we pray that your Ark
[1:56:21] our the word today would go before us
[1:56:27] keep us in your will Lord
[1:56:29] may your will be done
[1:56:31] and Lord we pray
[1:56:33] that the manifestation of your spirit
[1:56:37] would also be known in our congregation
[1:56:42] in Jesus name
