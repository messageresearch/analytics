[36:10] that I know of that comes from the text
[36:14] of the book of
[36:16] Lamentations it's our immense privilege
[36:19] and Grave responsibility to share with
[36:21] you this time about the book of
[36:23] Lamentations and I apologized to the
[36:25] kids when they came in there was no quiz
[36:27] hand out for them I know the only reason
[36:30] you came was for the quiz so I apologize
[36:33] that I didn't get that
[36:36] ready lamentation what is that it's it's
[36:40] a lament the act of
[36:42] bewailing an audible expression of
[36:46] Sorrow to express grief for or about to
[36:51] mourn to grieve audibly to
[36:56] wail the book of Lamentations is a
[36:58] collection of five poems bewailing the
[37:01] destruction of Jerusalem and the
[37:04] temple it's read aloud in Jewish
[37:07] synagogues the world over on the date
[37:10] called Tesha of Tesa is Hebrew for nine
[37:14] and a is a month so on the ninth month
[37:16] ninth day of the Hebrew month of a they
[37:20] read this text the book of Lamentations
[37:23] that's the date of the destruction of
[37:26] Solomon's temple in 587 or 86
[37:31] BC and it's the date of the destruction
[37:34] of the second temple in 70
[37:37] ad0 it's the saddest day in the Jewish
[37:43] calendar this year Tesa baav fell on
[37:48] August 12 and 13 just last week from
[37:51] Sunset August 12th till Darkness on the
[37:54] night of the
[37:56] 13th before we open the sacred book and
[37:58] read from it please join me in prayer to
[38:01] the one who inspired
[38:05] it Lord
[38:07] Jesus we're so grateful that we can be
[38:10] gathered together that we can draw
[38:11] strength from you and from each other
[38:13] Lord Lord this is not a a book of
[38:16] Celebration and rejoicing but as you
[38:18] taught us in Ecclesiastes Lord that
[38:21] there's a time to mourn A Time To Laugh
[38:25] A Time To Dance a time to re born a time
[38:28] to die so Lord we pray that you'd be
[38:31] with us as we approach this book this
[38:33] evening Lord that we can find in it Lord
[38:36] lessons for our life that we can apply
[38:39] in Tucson Arizona in August of the Year
[38:45] 2024 because your word is Everlasting it
[38:49] always applies help us to apply it thank
[38:53] you Lord forgive us Lord where we fall
[38:55] short Lord May no words be spoken
[38:57] tonight that would cause anyone to
[38:58] stumble but Lord May there be something
[39:01] said that would help someone Lord we ask
[39:04] it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[39:07] and we thank you for your presence with
[39:09] us
[39:12] amen we sometimes sing songs like
[39:15] Standing on the Promises every promise
[39:18] in the book is
[39:19] mine but we're often careful in choosing
[39:23] which promises we want to claim which
[39:26] rules we wish to
[39:28] obey keeping that in mind for our
[39:31] opening verses and while we're standing
[39:33] and you'll be standing for a couple of
[39:35] minutes it may get slightly
[39:36] uncomfortable but Lamentations is not a
[39:39] comfortable book so while we're standing
[39:42] let's read a couple of short
[39:44] selections from the book of
[39:48] Deuteronomy first consider these
[39:50] instructions about leadership from
[39:52] chapter 17 think of what we learned of
[39:55] King Solomon earlier in this series
[39:57] Deuteronomy
[40:00] 17:14 when thou art come unto the land
[40:03] which the Lord thy God giveth thee and
[40:06] shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein
[40:08] and shalt say I will set a king over me
[40:10] like as all the nations that are about
[40:13] me Thou shalt in any wise set him King
[40:16] over thee whom the Lord thy God shall
[40:19] choose we know that was Saul and then
[40:21] David one from among thy Brethren shalt
[40:24] thou set King over thee that mayest not
[40:27] set a stranger over thee which is not
[40:29] thy
[40:31] brother and now come specific commands
[40:35] to anyone who would have that position
[40:37] of leadership as a King rule number one
[40:40] he shall not multiply horses to himself
[40:43] nor cause the people to return to Egypt
[40:45] to the end that he should multiply
[40:47] horses
[40:52] one sorry
[41:00] for as much as the Lord hath said unto
[41:03] you you shall henceforth return no more
[41:06] that way rule number two neither shall
[41:10] he multiply wives to himself that is
[41:13] heart turn not
[41:15] away rule number three neither shall he
[41:19] greatly multiply to himself silver and
[41:22] gold he's not to seek
[41:25] wealth and it shall be when sth upon the
[41:28] throne of his
[41:29] kingdom that rule number four he shall
[41:33] write him a copy of this law in a book
[41:36] out of that which is before the priests
[41:38] the
[41:39] Levites and it shall be with him and
[41:43] rule number five he shall read therein
[41:46] all the days of his life read your Bible
[41:49] pray every day isn't just for Christians
[41:51] today it goes all the way back to 1400
[41:55] BC some of the reasons for these rules
[41:57] are that he may learn to fear the lord
[41:59] his God and to keep all the words of
[42:01] this law and these statutes to do them
[42:05] that his heart be not lifted up above
[42:08] his Brethren and that he turn not aside
[42:11] from the Commandment to the right hand
[42:12] or to the left to the end that he may
[42:15] prolong his days in his kingdom he and
[42:19] his
[42:20] descendants in the midst of
[42:23] Israel we know Solomon failed at each
[42:27] one of these and this SED the seeds of
[42:30] division in the Kingdom which occurred
[42:32] as soon as his son rabam took the throne
[42:36] in fact if you think back to the recent
[42:39] lessons that we've had in the book of
[42:40] Hebrews you no doubt realize that in the
[42:42] list of face Heroes of chapter 11 the
[42:46] only King mentioned is David no mention
[42:50] is made of Solomon in fact Solomon is
[42:54] never ever mentioned by Paul or by any
[42:58] other author in the New Testament after
[43:00] the book of Acts well you know the
[43:03] history Israel immediately went into
[43:04] idolatry Judah attempted to blend
[43:06] worship of the Lord with other gods
[43:10] doesn't work turning now to chapter 28
[43:14] our second of two
[43:15] readings this is about blessings and
[43:19] curses and it's really about conditional
[43:23] promises we read starting at verse one
[43:26] it shall come to pass if thou notice not
[43:32] ye but thou thou was second person
[43:36] singular so this is addressed to the
[43:38] nation as a
[43:40] unit if Thou shalt hearken diligently
[43:44] unto the voice of the Lord thy God to
[43:47] observe and to do all his Commandments
[43:49] which I command thee this day that the
[43:51] Lord thy God will set thee on high above
[43:54] all nations of the earth so again it's
[43:57] the unity of the
[43:59] group and all these blessings shall come
[44:03] on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt
[44:06] hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy
[44:09] God skipping to verse 7even the Lord
[44:11] shall cause thine enemies that rise up
[44:14] against thee to be smitten before thy
[44:16] face they shall come out against thee
[44:18] one way and flee before the seven
[44:21] ways verse nine the Lord shall establish
[44:25] thee and holy people unto himself as he
[44:29] hath sworn unto
[44:31] thee he swore it unto us oh but wait
[44:35] this is a conditional promise of
[44:37] blessing it's by no means unconditional
[44:40] if Thou shalt keep the Commandments of
[44:42] the Lord thy God and walk in his ways
[44:45] and all people of the Earth shall see
[44:47] that thou art called by the name of the
[44:49] Lord and they shall be afraid of thee
[44:51] recall what happened when uh Rahab
[44:55] talked to the spes before they were
[44:57] going to come in they were afraid they'd
[45:00] heard these blessings continue on
[45:02] through verse
[45:04] 14 verse 15 but it shall come to pass
[45:09] here's another conditional promise you
[45:11] have a choice to obey or not if thou
[45:16] Wilt not hearken unto the voice of the
[45:18] Lord thy God to observe to do
[45:22] all what portion uh the ones you
[45:25] personally approve of uh the ones you
[45:27] have a revelation
[45:29] concerning no the modifier here is all
[45:33] his Commandments and his statutes which
[45:35] I command thee this day that how many
[45:39] all these curses shall come upon thee
[45:44] and overtake thee again as a nation a
[45:49] unit a long list is given skip skipping
[45:51] now all the way down to verse 49 it's a
[45:55] long list
[45:57] the Lord shall bring a nation against
[46:00] thee from far from the end of the Earth
[46:03] as Swift as the eagle flies a nation
[46:06] whose tongue Thou shalt not understand
[46:09] so not Egypt not of
[46:12] Canaan remember the promises God now
[46:15] makes to the nation as we consider some
[46:19] of the Lamentations that will soon read
[46:22] a nation of fierce countenance which
[46:25] shall not regard the person of the old
[46:28] nor show favor to the
[46:30] young he shall eat the fruit of thy
[46:32] cattle and the fruit of thy
[46:34] land when will he stop until thou be
[46:39] destroyed and also shall not leave thee
[46:42] either grain wine or oil not petroleum
[46:46] olive oil or the increase of thy cattle
[46:48] or flocks of thy sheep until he have
[46:52] destroyed thee until you will not be
[46:55] recognizable as a
[46:57] nation and he shall besiege thee in thy
[47:00] Gates we'll see what that means in
[47:02] Lamentations in all thy Gates until thy
[47:06] high and fenced walls come down wherein
[47:08] thou trust us throughout all thy land
[47:11] and he shall beseech thee in all thy
[47:13] Gates throughout all thy land which the
[47:15] Lord thy God hath given
[47:18] thee these next verses are so hard to
[47:23] read to contemplate the horrors of of
[47:27] these
[47:28] promises but they are indeed among the
[47:31] promises God made with the people
[47:33] through Moses the
[47:34] prophet are you ready verse
[47:38] 53 Thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own
[47:41] body the Flesh of thy sons and thy
[47:47] daughters which the Lord thy God hath
[47:50] given thee in The Siege and in the
[47:53] straightness where With Thine enemies
[47:56] shall d distress Thee I don't know if
[47:58] you can
[47:59] imagine such a
[48:02] thing and if that's not Dreadful
[48:05] enough we come to one of the most
[48:07] disconcerting verses I find in this
[48:09] portion of scripture which is verse
[48:11] 63 it shall come to pass that as the
[48:14] Lord rejoiced over you to do you good
[48:17] and to multiply you so the Lord will
[48:20] rejoice over you to destroy you and
[48:23] bring you to
[48:25] not and you should be plucked from off
[48:27] the land whether thou goest to possess
[48:29] it the Lord shall scatter thee among all
[48:32] people from one end of the Earth even
[48:33] unto the other and there shalt thou
[48:35] serve other gods which neither thou nor
[48:37] thy fathers have known even of wood and
[48:41] stone among these nations shalt thou
[48:44] find no ease neither shall the soul of
[48:47] thy foot have
[48:48] rest but the Lord shall give thee there
[48:51] a trembling heart failing of
[48:55] eyes sor of
[48:58] mind please be
[49:01] seated
[49:03] choices there are consequences to the
[49:06] decisions that we take the actions that
[49:08] we make
[49:10] good and
[49:13] bad the book of Deuteronomy is the fifth
[49:16] book of the Torah written by Moses
[49:18] concluding about 1406
[49:21] BC it ends just as the nation of Israel
[49:24] is about to cease its wandering its
[49:26] diaspora if you will and enter into the
[49:27] land of
[49:29] promise the book of Lamentations
[49:32] describes the horrors of the final Siege
[49:34] and destruction of Jerusalem in 587 or
[49:37] 586 some 820 years
[49:41] later it is at the time that the last
[49:44] remnants of the nation are about to be
[49:46] expelled from the land of promise and
[49:48] enter a second
[49:50] diaspora and we could simply read the
[49:52] book of Lamentations together and we
[49:55] shall God willing it's a series of five
[49:58] poems four of which are
[50:02] acrostic a total of
[50:04] only4 verses it's shorter than the 119th
[50:09] Psalm I'll find a crostic for you when
[50:11] we take a look at the laments themselves
[50:14] but I think we need some context before
[50:17] we tackle the book and by the way I'll
[50:20] have you here less than two
[50:22] hours how did the
[50:24] nation come to the condition
[50:27] that horrific
[50:29] destruction would be the cup from which
[50:33] they would be forced to
[50:41] drink previously in this series we've
[50:44] covered the section of the Old Testament
[50:45] we call history so you have an idea of
[50:48] the emergence of the monarchy under Saul
[50:50] after the period of the judges the rise
[50:53] of David as the celebrated King the
[50:56] success ession of Solomon and how he set
[50:58] the stage for the destruction of the
[51:00] Kingdom which was thror apart at his
[51:02] death by the actions of his son
[51:05] rabam the trigger dividing the Kingdom
[51:08] of Israel came down to excessive
[51:11] taxation forced upon the People by a
[51:14] tyranical government bent on
[51:17] self-aggrandisement rather than serving
[51:20] its
[51:21] citizens but that was just a symptom
[51:24] that's just a trigger the cause
[51:27] was forsaking the Lord the split
[51:30] happened about 9:30 BC in his mercy God
[51:35] raised up prophets to rebuke and correct
[51:37] and redirect his people and their
[51:39] leaders when they went astray so it's no
[51:42] surprise the prophets come to the
[51:44] Forefront of scripture when the nation
[51:45] of Israel splits into two kingdoms and
[51:49] plunges into
[51:52] idolatry we read in the histories about
[51:55] prophets like Elijah Elisha Mika what we
[51:58] call the oral prophets the ones that
[52:00] didn't leave us any
[52:02] writings in the mid 700s BC the first of
[52:05] the writing prophets appear most of them
[52:08] wrote over a period of years the start
[52:10] and ending of which are somewhat ambigu
[52:13] a few were pretty specific as to the
[52:15] years of their Ministry such as Amos or
[52:17] the start of Isaiah's
[52:20] Ministry but in 723
[52:23] BC the unthinkable happens
[52:27] the Assyrians brutally conquer the
[52:31] Kingdom of
[52:32] Israel and they don't just conquer
[52:34] Israel they depopulated scattering the
[52:37] people throughout the Assyrian Empire
[52:40] this is shown sort of with the red line
[52:41] there as they're taken
[52:46] away but Baron territory is not good for
[52:49] defense nor does it generate much tax
[52:51] revenue so the Assyrians repopulated the
[52:54] land with settlers and throughout their
[52:56] empire
[52:57] indicated in green this is why we later
[53:00] read of in the northern kingdom Galilee
[53:03] of the Gentiles it was repopulated with
[53:07] Gentiles in 723
[53:10] BC you'll note the map doesn't show a
[53:13] kingdom of
[53:15] Judah recall when we studied Isaiah a
[53:18] few weeks ago Hezekiah was under siege
[53:20] in Jerusalem the Assyrians under their
[53:23] King sakb had already conquered nearly
[53:25] all of Judah
[53:27] the Lord destroyed The Siege Army at
[53:29] Jerusalem sakra returned home and was
[53:32] subsequently killed by two of his sons
[53:35] but while Israel was depopulated Judah
[53:39] became a tributary of Assyria a
[53:41] tributary doesn't exactly mean a stream
[53:43] feeding a river but it's the same idea
[53:45] it means that Judah paid tribute taxes
[53:50] Ransom
[53:51] extortion to Assyria it's a very
[53:54] critical time for Judah
[53:57] the temple meanwhile had fallen into
[53:59] neglect priests had failed for a long
[54:01] time to proclaim the law and in general
[54:03] to do their duties King Josiah who
[54:07] reigned in Judah some 60 years after
[54:09] Assyria conquered Israel orders the
[54:11] temple to be
[54:13] repaired in the rubble inside the temple
[54:16] that is being cleaned and fixed a bit
[54:18] like our church is undergoing
[54:19] Renovations now an ancient scroll is
[54:22] found it's part of perhaps all of the
[54:25] Books of Moses the
[54:27] Torah it's brought to King Josiah look
[54:30] what we found in the rubble in the
[54:32] temple and it's read before him I'm sure
[54:36] it included portions of Deuteronomy that
[54:39] we read at our opening this morning this
[54:41] evening Josiah is a gast falls on his
[54:46] face in anguish and repentance calls for
[54:49] the nation to return to the Lord he sets
[54:52] the example and there is a
[54:54] Revival unfortunately the Revival is
[54:57] shortlived apparently it's superficial
[55:00] for most
[55:02] folks after all this 2 Chronicles
[55:06] 35:20 when Josiah had prepared the
[55:09] temple this is now 609 BC Neo which
[55:14] means lame we don't know which Pharaoh
[55:16] it is Neo king of Egypt came to fight
[55:19] against that means near or in the
[55:21] vicinity of kemes by
[55:24] Euphrates and Josiah went out to be
[55:26] battle against
[55:27] Neo but Neo sent ambassadors to Josiah
[55:32] saying what have I to do with thee that
[55:35] king of Judah I come not to battle
[55:37] against thee this day but against the
[55:39] house wherewith I have War for God
[55:43] commanded me to make haste forbear thee
[55:46] from meddling with God who is with me
[55:49] that he destroy thee
[55:52] not nevertheless Josiah would not turn
[55:55] his face from Neo and the Egyptian Army
[55:59] he hearkened not unto the words of Neo
[56:03] from from the mouth of God and Josiah
[56:09] came to fight in the valley of
[56:13] megiddo perhaps Josiah assumed that
[56:15] since there was a prophet in the land
[56:18] Jeremiah he'd be the one that God would
[56:20] speak through to tell Josiah what he
[56:22] should or shouldn't do how could the
[56:24] Egyptian pharaoh a heathen
[56:27] possibly be speaking the word of
[56:31] God there's a point here we can take
[56:33] home we must always be careful that we
[56:37] don't miss God when he chooses to inform
[56:40] us through a source we might not
[56:42] normally trust or
[56:45] respect we shouldn't limit
[56:50] God Josiah is killed in battle jeho Kim
[56:54] becomes king shortly thereafter Judah
[56:56] fall falls back into
[56:57] idolatry having conquered ass Syria the
[57:00] Babylonian Army comes to Judah it's now
[57:02] 605 BC the first three sieges of
[57:05] Jerusalem by Babylon jeho Kim surrenders
[57:08] to the Babylonians and and a small group
[57:10] of captives are taken to
[57:14] Babylon what does this Mark the
[57:16] beginning of what we call the Babylonian
[57:19] captivity and it starts a timer that
[57:21] Jeremiah spoke of of a 70-year period
[57:24] after which Babylon would be judged
[57:27] we read in Daniel the first chapter
[57:29] first verse this occurred in the third
[57:31] year of the reign of jeim king of Judah
[57:33] came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto
[57:35] Jerusalem and besieged it besieged means
[57:38] you surround it you cut it off from all
[57:40] transportation from all Food Supplies
[57:43] from everything you
[57:45] isolate and the lord gave jehoiakim king
[57:48] of Judah into his hand he surrendered
[57:51] with part of the vessels of the house of
[57:53] God which he carried into the land of
[57:54] Shar to the house of his God and he
[57:56] brought the vessels into the Treasure
[57:58] House of his God and the King spoke unto
[58:00] ashpenaz the master of his unic that he
[58:03] should bring certain of the children of
[58:04] Israel this young men not kids and of
[58:08] the king's seed and of the princes
[58:11] children in whom was no blemish but well
[58:13] favored and skillful in all wisdom and
[58:15] cunning and knowledge and understanding
[58:17] science and such as had ability in them
[58:20] to stand in the king's
[58:21] Palace and whom they might teach the
[58:24] learning and tongue of the Cal
[58:27] Deans recall the warning in Deuteronomy
[58:30] about being conquered swiftly by a
[58:32] nation from afar whose tongue they did
[58:34] not
[58:36] understand skipping to verse six among
[58:38] these were the children of Judah Daniel
[58:40] haniah
[58:42] mishel and
[58:44] Azariah this Begins the conquest of
[58:47] Judah by Babylon in the initial carrying
[58:50] into captivity starting that 70-year
[58:52] period that I just mentioned but time
[58:55] goes
[58:57] on what happens in 598 BC jeim left on
[59:02] the throne as a puppet King Rebels
[59:04] against the
[59:05] Babylonians he's killed jeho his son
[59:08] takes the throne for about a 100
[59:11] days Nebuchadnezzar again besieges
[59:14] Jerusalem carries away jeim and his
[59:17] wives and children to Babylon along with
[59:18] the Mighty Men the Bible tells us the
[59:21] Craftsmen the workers of metal the
[59:23] extended royal family a total the Bible
[59:26] tells us of some 10,000 captives he
[59:29] raids the temple he leads the Bible says
[59:32] and I quote the poorest sort of people
[59:35] of the
[59:36] land he installs zedekiah as his puppet
[59:40] king of
[59:42] Judah about 10 years pass and
[59:46] zedekiah warned by Jeremiah don't do
[59:49] this he ignores the prophet and he
[59:53] Rebels against Babylonia he's got some
[59:55] other prophets that tell them oh you're
[59:58] you're going to do this we're the Lord's
[1:00:01] people these
[1:00:03] Heathen Nebuchadnezzar besieges
[1:00:06] Jerusalem for the third
[1:00:07] time when the city Falls it is raided of
[1:00:11] all its remaining wealth and completely
[1:00:15] destroyed the temple is completely
[1:00:19] destroyed the ruins are set on fire
[1:00:23] zedekiah is removed from the throne and
[1:00:26] Gentile Governor Galia is
[1:00:29] installed what God had promised in
[1:00:32] Deuteronomy 28 and 1406 BC began with
[1:00:37] the Exile of Israel in 723 BC is
[1:00:42] completed with the destruction of
[1:00:44] Jerusalem in 586 587
[1:00:49] BC okay we'll stop the history lesson I
[1:00:52] wanted to give you context about why
[1:00:55] there is this terrible tragedy there'll
[1:00:58] be more to cover as we go into other
[1:01:00] books of the Bible as we continue this
[1:01:02] series but I wanted you to have an
[1:01:04] overview of how we came to the
[1:01:06] destruction of Jerusalem from our
[1:01:08] opening verses in Deuteronomy why it was
[1:01:11] ultimately destroyed I think that this
[1:01:14] context is so important to
[1:01:17] understand as we prepare to read
[1:01:20] Lamentations let's take a look at
[1:01:22] writing style and Define acrostic
[1:01:25] acrostic poetry I I I said i' do that I
[1:01:29] should probably follow through have you
[1:01:31] ever wondered why the 119th Psalm shows
[1:01:34] the first Hebrew letter Alf as a label
[1:01:38] even in an English language Bible
[1:01:41] translation or or why at verse 9 it
[1:01:43] shows the second Hebrew letter or at
[1:01:46] least declares the label
[1:01:49] Beth all 22 letters of the Hebrew
[1:01:51] alphabet are listed in Psalm 119 in
[1:01:54] their proper order
[1:01:56] each letter is followed by an eight
[1:01:58] verse section each section is like a
[1:02:01] mini Psalm self-contained able to stand
[1:02:03] alone all of the eight verse sections of
[1:02:06] this Psalm begin with the Hebrew
[1:02:07] Alphabet letter that declares the
[1:02:09] section notice the first eight verses
[1:02:12] all begin with the same Hebrew letter
[1:02:14] Alf I don't expect you to know the
[1:02:16] Hebrew alphabet so I've highlighted the
[1:02:18] first letter and yellow remember Hebrew
[1:02:21] reads from right to left so you can see
[1:02:24] the one you can see the English on on
[1:02:26] the one side the Hebrew and the other
[1:02:27] but olive the second verse Olive third
[1:02:30] verse Olive all the way down the word
[1:02:33] that is chosen begins with that same
[1:02:35] letter for eight verses then at the
[1:02:37] ninth verse the second group of eight
[1:02:39] you get the second letter of the Hebrew
[1:02:41] alphabet bet and all eight verses of
[1:02:43] that section of the Psalms begin with
[1:02:45] the letter bet and then gimal do avov
[1:02:48] and so forth down through the entire
[1:02:50] Hebrew
[1:02:54] alphabet for the kids
[1:02:57] here's the
[1:02:58] alphabet on the one side the one you
[1:03:00] might recognize and on the other side
[1:03:02] the one you might not the Hebrew
[1:03:03] alphabet the first two letters are alfet
[1:03:06] alfet
[1:03:08] alphabet so that's the 22 letters of the
[1:03:11] Hebrew alphabet the 26 letters of our
[1:03:14] English alphabet so it goes alfabet
[1:03:17] gimal on down to the final letter Tav
[1:03:19] just like ours goes a b CDE e down to Z
[1:03:23] well this method of poetic writing
[1:03:26] leading with the alphabetic sequence is
[1:03:28] known as
[1:03:29] acrostic requires Great skill to write
[1:03:32] this way I I don't possess that skill
[1:03:35] Psalm 119 is a very intricate example of
[1:03:37] the form but it occurs in simpler ways
[1:03:39] in several of the
[1:03:41] Psalms sadly when translating from
[1:03:44] Hebrew to another language like English
[1:03:46] or Spanish this sort of structure is
[1:03:48] lost the only way to appreciate it is to
[1:03:52] learn the original language
[1:03:57] okay brother Lyall so what why are you
[1:04:00] bringing this up that's the 119th Psalm
[1:04:04] Lamentations is mostly
[1:04:06] acrostic four of the five chapters are
[1:04:10] acrostic chapters one two and four we
[1:04:12] might call Simple acrostic each of the
[1:04:15] 22 verses begins with the succeeding
[1:04:17] letter of the Hebrew alphabet so verse
[1:04:20] one starts with olive verse two with bet
[1:04:22] and so on to verse 22 with t let's
[1:04:24] quickly look don't try and read the
[1:04:27] Hebrew so we see the first 11 so it's ol
[1:04:31] of bet gimmel
[1:04:32] do I want to call that VAV but in modern
[1:04:36] Hebrew it's VAV in Biblical Hebrew it's
[1:04:38] w
[1:04:40] Zion
[1:04:46] [Music]
[1:04:49] T Shin Tav it's the 22
[1:04:54] letters and that's how that Lamentations
[1:04:56] is
[1:04:57] written chapter 2 is also a simple
[1:05:00] acrostic written the same way chapter
[1:05:02] three has 66 verses three times 22 so as
[1:05:07] you may have guessed like Psalm 119 the
[1:05:09] first three verses begin with the Hebrew
[1:05:11] letter Olive the next three the Hebrew
[1:05:13] letter bet and so forth till you get to
[1:05:15] the final three verses beginning with
[1:05:17] the Hebrew letter
[1:05:19] T chapter four returns to the simple
[1:05:23] acrostic in chapter five though it also
[1:05:26] contains 22 verses it's not a crostic my
[1:05:30] personal
[1:05:32] Theory don't hold me to it's just my
[1:05:35] idea about chapter five is that the
[1:05:37] writer is so overcome with grief and
[1:05:42] pain that he can no longer contain the
[1:05:44] expression in this form and you'll
[1:05:47] notice that not only are the verses in
[1:05:49] chapter 5 not acostic each is very short
[1:05:53] it's like he is just out of of Tears
[1:05:56] he's out of words he's out of
[1:06:00] energy one final stylistic note the
[1:06:03] first word in the first verse of the
[1:06:05] first chapter is the Hebrew
[1:06:09] word that's the Hebrew name of what we
[1:06:12] call the book of Lamentations they just
[1:06:14] call
[1:06:16] Ita is the Hebrew word that means
[1:06:20] how how did this happen how did we come
[1:06:24] to this
[1:06:28] how moving on the authorship of
[1:06:31] Lamentations is unknown some traditions
[1:06:34] ascribe it to Jeremiah but even the most
[1:06:37] ancient Hebrew texts the Dead Sea
[1:06:39] Scrolls for example which contain the
[1:06:41] first portion of the book of
[1:06:42] Lamentations they don't indicate
[1:06:45] that however the Septuagint an early
[1:06:48] translation of Hebrew into Greek claims
[1:06:51] Jeremiah wrote it if we strip away all
[1:06:54] the Traditions about how it came to be
[1:06:57] the earliest copy of the septu we have
[1:07:00] is from a monastery copied in the 4th
[1:07:03] Century ad in English translation it
[1:07:06] reads and it came to pass after Israel
[1:07:10] was taken captive and Jerusalem made
[1:07:12] desolate that Jeremiah sat weeping and
[1:07:16] lamented with this lamentation over
[1:07:19] Jerusalem and said how does the city
[1:07:22] that was filled with people sit solitary
[1:07:25] she's become as a widow she that was
[1:07:28] magnified among the Nations and
[1:07:30] princesses among the provinces has
[1:07:33] become
[1:07:34] tributary I've highlighted the prepended
[1:07:37] commentary text on this screen and
[1:07:39] yellow again this statement of
[1:07:41] Jeremiah's authorship is not in any
[1:07:42] Hebrew text it was added by someone
[1:07:45] along the
[1:07:48] way okay brother while enough about
[1:07:50] historical context literary style
[1:07:53] speculation about who wrote
[1:07:56] Lamentations we know who inspired it so
[1:08:00] let's read it I'm going to read from the
[1:08:02] new King James translation you can
[1:08:04] follow in the regular King James if you
[1:08:06] wish the N kgv is primarily replacing
[1:08:09] some archaic words and in some cases
[1:08:11] using some line formatting or
[1:08:13] capitalization to suggest poetic
[1:08:19] intent
[1:08:21] Lamentations chapter
[1:08:23] 1 Jerusalem is portrayed as a grieving
[1:08:29] Widow how lonely sits the City Jerusalem
[1:08:34] that was full of people how like a widow
[1:08:38] is she who who is great among the
[1:08:39] Nations the princess among the provinces
[1:08:43] has become a
[1:08:44] slave she weeps bitterly in the night
[1:08:47] her tears are on her cheeks among all
[1:08:50] her lovers she has none to comfort her
[1:08:54] all her friends have have dealt
[1:08:55] treacherously with her they have become
[1:08:58] her
[1:08:59] enemies Judah has gone into captivity
[1:09:03] under Affliction and hard
[1:09:06] servitude she dwells among the Nations
[1:09:10] now nations in the Bible means peoples
[1:09:12] Gentiles heathens it doesn't mean
[1:09:14] political entities like the United
[1:09:16] States or Mexico or something with
[1:09:18] borders that are internationally
[1:09:19] recognized that's not what nation
[1:09:22] means she finds no rest
[1:09:26] all her persecutors overtake her in her
[1:09:28] Dire Straits the roads to Zion another
[1:09:32] name for Jerusalem the roads to Zion
[1:09:35] mourn because no one comes to the set
[1:09:38] feasts all her gates are desolate her
[1:09:41] priests sigh her virgins her young women
[1:09:45] are afflicted she's in bitterness her
[1:09:49] adversaries have become the master her
[1:09:51] enemies Prosper for the Lord has
[1:09:54] afflicted at her because of the
[1:09:57] multitude of her
[1:09:59] transgressions the lament recognizes the
[1:10:02] root cause of the horrors now being
[1:10:04] reported her children have gone into
[1:10:07] captivity before the enemy and from the
[1:10:10] daughter of Zion all her Splendor has
[1:10:13] departed her princes have become like
[1:10:15] deer that find no pasture that flee
[1:10:19] without strength before the
[1:10:23] pursuer and the days of her Affliction
[1:10:26] in roaming Jerusalem remembers all her
[1:10:29] Pleasant things she had in days of old
[1:10:32] when her people fell into the hand of
[1:10:33] the enemy with no one to help her the
[1:10:36] adversar saw her and mocked at her
[1:10:39] downfall
[1:10:41] Jerusalem has sinned
[1:10:44] Gravely therefore she has become vile
[1:10:47] all who honored her despise her because
[1:10:51] they have seen her
[1:10:52] nakedness yes she eyes turns away her
[1:10:57] uncleanness is in her skirts she did not
[1:11:00] consider her
[1:11:02] Destiny therefore her collapse was
[1:11:04] awesome a
[1:11:07] spectacle she had no comforter oh Lord
[1:11:11] behold my Affliction for the enemy is
[1:11:15] exalted the adversary has spread his
[1:11:18] hand over all her Pleasant things for
[1:11:21] she has seen the Nations the Heathen
[1:11:23] enter her Sanctuary those whom you
[1:11:25] commanded not to enter your assembly all
[1:11:29] her people sigh they seek bread they
[1:11:32] have given their valuables for food to
[1:11:34] restore life see oh Lord and consider
[1:11:38] for I am
[1:11:40] scorned is it nothing to you all who
[1:11:43] pass by behold and see if there's any
[1:11:46] sorrow like my sorrow which has been
[1:11:49] brought on me which not the armies of
[1:11:52] Babylon but which the Lord has has
[1:11:55] inflicted in the days of his Fierce
[1:11:58] Anger from above he has sent fire into
[1:12:01] my bones and it overpowered them he
[1:12:04] spread a net for my feet and turned me
[1:12:07] back he's made me desolate and faint all
[1:12:10] the day the Yoke of my transgressions
[1:12:13] was bound they were woven together by
[1:12:16] his hands and thrust upon my neck he
[1:12:19] made my strength fail the Lord delivered
[1:12:23] me into the hands of those whom I am not
[1:12:26] able to
[1:12:27] withstand the Lord has trampled
[1:12:29] underfoot all my mighty men in my midst
[1:12:32] he is called an assembly against me to
[1:12:35] crush my young men the Lord trampled as
[1:12:39] in a wine press the virgin daughter of
[1:12:42] Judah for these things I weep my eye my
[1:12:46] eye overflows with water because the
[1:12:49] comforter who should restore my life is
[1:12:52] far from me my children are desol it
[1:12:55] because the enemy
[1:12:58] prevails Zion spreads out her hands but
[1:13:02] no one Comforts her the Lord has
[1:13:04] commanded concerning Jacob that those
[1:13:06] around him become his adversaries
[1:13:09] Jerusalem has become an unclean thing
[1:13:12] among
[1:13:13] them in the midst of all this upon
[1:13:16] reflection she realizes she recognizes
[1:13:20] the Lord is righteous
[1:13:28] for I rebelled against his commandment
[1:13:31] here now all peoples and behold my
[1:13:34] sorrow My Virgins and my young men have
[1:13:36] gone into captivity called for my lovers

[1:13:48] food to restore their life
[1:13:55] see oh Lord that I am in distress my
[1:13:57] soul is troubled my heart is overturned

[1:14:29] me for my transgressions for my size are
[1:14:32] many and my heart is
[1:14:38] fate the next lament begins from the
[1:14:43] perspective of an

[1:14:49] daughter of Zion with a cloud in his
[1:14:51] anger he cast down from heaven to the

[1:22:38] and I said my strength and My Hope have
[1:22:40] perished from the Lord remember my

[1:23:33] man to Bear the Yoke in his youth let
[1:23:36] him sit alone and keep silent because
[1:23:39] God has laid it on him let him put his
[1:23:42] mouth in the

[1:23:57] will show compassion according to the
[1:24:00] multitude of his mercies he does not
[1:24:04] afflict willingly nor grieve the
[1:24:05] children of men to crush under one's
[1:24:07] feet all the prisoners of the earth to
[1:24:09] turn aside the Justice do a man before
[1:24:12] the face of the most high or subvert a
[1:24:14] man in his cause the Lord does not
[1:24:17] approve who is he who speaks and it
[1:24:20] comes to pass when the Lord has not
[1:24:22] commanded it is it not from the mouth of
[1:24:25] the most high that woe and well-being
[1:24:29] proceed why should a living man complain
[1:24:31] a man for the punishment of his sins let

[1:24:40] 51 and turn back to the Lord let us lift
[1:24:43] our hearts and hands to the God in

[1:26:19] schemes against me the lips of my
[1:26:21] enemies and their Whispering against me

[1:26:27] and their rising up I am their taunting
[1:26:30] song repay them oh Lord according to the
[1:26:33] work of their hands give them a veiled
[1:26:35] heart your curse be upon them and your
[1:26:37] anger pursue and Destroy them from under
[1:26:40] the heavens of the
[1:26:47] Lord the fourth
[1:26:51] lamentation how the gold has become dim
[1:26:54] how changed the fine gold the stones of
[1:26:56] the sanctuary are scattered at the head
[1:26:58] of every street the precious sons of
[1:27:01] Zion valuable as fine gold how they are
[1:27:04] regarded as clay pots the work of the
[1:27:07] hands of the Potter even the jackals
[1:27:10] present their breasts to nurse their
[1:27:12] young but the daughter of my people is
[1:27:14] cruel like ostriches in the
[1:27:17] wilderness the tongue of the infant
[1:27:19] clings to the roof of its mouth for
[1:27:23] thirst the young children ask for
[1:27:26] bread but no one breaks it for
[1:27:29] them those who ate Delicacies are
[1:27:32] desolate in the streets those who were
[1:27:34] brought up in Scarlet Embrace Ash heeps
[1:27:39] the punishment of the iniquity of the
[1:27:40] daughter of my people is greater than
[1:27:42] the punishment of the sin of Sodom which
[1:27:44] was overthrown in a moment with no hand
[1:27:47] to help
[1:27:48] her her nazarites this this means
[1:27:51] princes separated ones her princes were
[1:27:54] brighter than snow and whiter than milk
[1:27:57] they were more ready in body than rubies
[1:27:59] like sapphire in their
[1:28:03] appearance now their appearances blacker
[1:28:06] than suot they go unrecognized in the
[1:28:09] streets their skin clings to their bones
[1:28:13] it has become as dry as
[1:28:14] wood those slain By The Sword are better
[1:28:17] off than those who die of hunger for
[1:28:21] these pine away stricken for lack of the
[1:28:24] fruits of the
[1:28:26] field the hands of the compassionate
[1:28:29] women have cooked their own
[1:28:32] children they became food for them and
[1:28:35] the destruction of the daughter of my
[1:28:39] people the Lord has fulfilled his Fury
[1:28:43] he has poured out his Fierce anger he
[1:28:45] kindled a fire in Zion and it has
[1:28:47] devoured its foundations the kings of
[1:28:50] the Earth all inhabitants of the world
[1:28:52] would not have believed that the
[1:28:54] adversary and the enemy could enter the
[1:28:56] Gates of
[1:28:58] Jerusalem because of the sins of her
[1:29:00] prophets those are false prophets and
[1:29:03] the iniquities of her priests who shed
[1:29:04] in their midst the blood of the just
[1:29:08] they wandered blind in the streets they
[1:29:11] have defiled themselves with blood so
[1:29:13] that no one would touch their garments
[1:29:15] they cried out to them go away unclean
[1:29:18] go away go away do not touch us when
[1:29:21] they fled and wandered those among the
[1:29:23] Nations said they shall no longer dwell
[1:29:25] here the face of the Lord scattered them
[1:29:28] he no longer regards them the people do
[1:29:30] not respect the priests nor show favor
[1:29:33] to the elders still our eyes failed us
[1:29:37] watching vainly for our help and our
[1:29:39] watching we watched for a nation that
[1:29:41] could not save
[1:29:43] us they tracked our steps so that we
[1:29:45] could not walk in our streets our end
[1:29:47] was near our days were over for our end
[1:29:50] had come our pursuers were swifter than
[1:29:53] the Eagles of the heavens
[1:29:55] recall Deuteronomy 28 they pursued us on
[1:29:58] the mountains and lay in wait for us in
[1:30:00] the
[1:30:01] wilderness the breath of our nostrils
[1:30:04] the anointed of the Lord was caught in
[1:30:06] their pits of whom we said under his
[1:30:09] shadow we shall live among the
[1:30:13] Nations rejoice and be glad oh daughter
[1:30:16] of Edom you who dwell in the land of
[1:30:20] O the cup shall also pass over to you
[1:30:24] and you shall become drunk and make
[1:30:25] yourself naked the punishment of your
[1:30:28] iniquity is accomplished oh Daughter of
[1:30:30] Zion he will no longer send you into
[1:30:32] captivity he will punish your iniquity
[1:30:35] oh daughter of Edom he will uncover your
[1:30:43] sins and the final
[1:30:46] lamentation Lamentations
[1:30:48] five not acrostic verses are short the
[1:30:53] lament is is
[1:30:55] drained remember oh
[1:30:57] Lord what has come upon us look and
[1:31:00] behold our reproach our inheritance has
[1:31:04] been turned over to aliens and our
[1:31:05] houses to foreigners we have become
[1:31:08] orphans and wfes our mothers are like
[1:31:11] widows we pay for the water we drink our
[1:31:14] wood comes at a price they pursue at our
[1:31:17] heels we labor and have no rest we have
[1:31:21] given our hand to the Egyptians and the
[1:31:23] Assyrians to be satisfied with bread our
[1:31:26] fathers sinned in are no more but we
[1:31:29] bear their
[1:31:31] iniquities servants rule over us there
[1:31:34] is none to Deliver Us from their hand we
[1:31:36] get our bread at the risk of Our Lives
[1:31:39] because of the sword in the wilderness
[1:31:41] our skin is hot as an oven because of
[1:31:44] the fever of famine they ravished the
[1:31:47] women in Zion the maidens in the cities
[1:31:50] of Judah princes were hung up by their
[1:31:53] hands
[1:31:54] Elders were not respected young men
[1:31:58] grounded the millstones boys staggered
[1:32:00] under loads of wood the elders have
[1:32:03] ceased gathering at the gate the young
[1:32:05] men from their
[1:32:07] music The Joy of our heart has ceased
[1:32:11] our dance has turned into mourning the
[1:32:14] crown has fallen from our head woe to us
[1:32:20] for we have sinned because of this
[1:32:24] our heart is faint because of these
[1:32:27] things our eyes grow dim because of
[1:32:28] Mount Zion which is desolate with foxes
[1:32:31] walking about on
[1:32:32] it you oh Lord remain forever your
[1:32:36] throne from generation to generation why
[1:32:39] do you forget us forever and forsake us
[1:32:43] for so long a
[1:32:45] time turn us back to you Lord and we
[1:32:48] will be restored renew our days as of
[1:32:51] old unless you have utterly rejected us
[1:32:54] and are very angry with
[1:33:04] us the musicians would please
[1:33:07] come Lamentations is such a difficult
[1:33:10] book to read despair horror extended
[1:33:15] suffering and death is the opening
[1:33:16] chapter of a saga that stretched for
[1:33:18] centuries then Millennia a punishment
[1:33:21] for sin after constant patience appeal
[1:33:24] for repentance and
[1:33:26] Reconciliation the obvious lesson here
[1:33:28] is that we should seek the Lord follow
[1:33:30] his will keep his Commandments not to
[1:33:34] avoid the penalty but from a heart that
[1:33:36] loves
[1:33:38] him when I read this book to prepare for
[1:33:41] tonight I could not help but think of
[1:33:43] another time in the environs of
[1:33:46] Jerusalem of some 600 years later
[1:33:50] another lament if you will
[1:33:55] Luke
[1:33:59] 22:41 and Jesus was withdrawn from his
[1:34:03] disciples about a stone's cast and he
[1:34:05] kneeled down among the olive trees and
[1:34:09] the Garden of Gethsemane overlooking the
[1:34:12] kidan valley where the blood from the
[1:34:14] sacrifices
[1:34:16] flowed and prayed saying father if thou
[1:34:20] be willing remove this cup from me
[1:34:25] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:34:30] done and there appeared an angel unto
[1:34:33] him from Heaven strengthening
[1:34:36] him and being in an Agony Jesus prayed
[1:34:40] more
[1:34:42] earnestly and his sweat was as it were
[1:34:45] great drops of blood falling down to the
[1:34:50] ground and when he rose up from prayer
[1:34:53] and was come to his disciples he found
[1:34:57] them
[1:34:58] sleeping for sorrow to me
[1:35:03] Lamentations is a reflection of what was
[1:35:06] to come a shadow if you
[1:35:09] will another great suffering for
[1:35:12] sin but this time it was Christ the
[1:35:17] sinless suffering for
[1:35:19] me The
[1:35:21] Sinner only this time
[1:35:24] it would be the atonement for each and
[1:35:28] all of
[1:35:30] us and unlike the lamenter crying out
[1:35:33] for vengeance to the ones the Lord used
[1:35:36] to punish
[1:35:38] them Jesus prayed father forgive
[1:35:43] them and taught us to love our
[1:35:48] enemies and do good to them
