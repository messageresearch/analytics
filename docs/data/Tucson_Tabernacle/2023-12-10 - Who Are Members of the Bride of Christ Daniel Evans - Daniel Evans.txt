stay um we um it's an honor this morning to be here in the house of the Lord once again um and brother Jordan mentioned that tonight we have uh we have our testimony and Praises so I just love these Services I love hearing the the Believers and what the Lord's done in their lives over the past little while and the songs that talent that we have so please come tonight and and I'm I'm really looking forward to a nice service we have uh this morning we have another little Another Blessing sister Grace are we uh ready we have a a baby dedication oh wow look at this little one let's um if we could brother Jordan where'd you go if you could sing a song as they bring the the baby up bring them in bring them in WoW bring the little ones to Jesus bring them in bring beautiful baby sister what's your name Angelina bless what's your name Joshua God bless you and how are you related that's my mom that's your mom wow you have a grandbaby now praise the Lord um so sister I forgot your name again Angelina sister Angelina and brother Joshua and what is the baby's name Isabella Isabella the Bible teaches us if we could turn a little bit and face the congregation the Bible teaches us Jesus said suffer the little children suffer the little children to come to me he said don't forbid them he said let them come to me and then he made a statement one time he said for their angels are now in the presence of the father so we think of this little baby coming here and to be dedicated back to the father and what an honor knowing that this baby has a representative over there in the presence of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and this is just a reflection of of that presence of um of What the Lord Has Done Now brother and sister this baby has been lone to you by the Lord Jesus he's entrusted you with the great responsibility of taking care of the child and raising the child right and raising the child in the image of God and I know you're up to it you seem like a very sweet family if uh can I hold the the baby is that okay sister is that okay okay yeah wow that is a beautiful little baby let's all bow our heads heavenly father I'm not worthy to hold this little gift of love that you've given to your son and your daughter father As I Lay My Hands on her I pray Lord that your Holy Spirit would guide her for the rest of her life until you would come and Lord that that she would be a blessed baby that your blessings would rest upon her above above others and father that that your hand Lord would guide her and direct her and if if you would tar Lord may she have a happy in a good life and father may your spirit always be present with her in Jesus Christ's name amen did you see that she smiled at me that was good oh man thank you my brother God bless you Sister God bless you thank you thank you amen thank thank you what an honor what a blessing to be able to hold a little baby like that what a miracle we think about we think about a child and how these these babies are formed in the womb and and then they're born and wow they're just these beautiful little helpless little creatures so so many times the Bible Well Jesus said he says except that we become like them we won't enter into the kingdom we have to become like that little baby that's just so dependent on Mom and Dad we have to be dependent like like that baby with our Lord Jesus that's that's the ultimate goal that's a Christian is to become it's strange when you grow up you think you're more dependent you're more independent but when you grow up in the Lord you become more dependent on God been uh praying this week on a on a number of things and we're December seems to be the month of decision for for all of us really we we're closing out the year and and um a lot of times we're choosing what health insurance we have for the next year and we have to we have to do that we're for the for the the students they're deciding what classes that they're going to take next semester and even to the point what Christmas gifts we're going to buy if you do that and there's just so many decisions that we face in December this time of year and it's it seems like it's it's a pressure full time for for many of us right now we're deciding on uh the church renovation we're making starting to make uh some decisions in that way and and I know I've waited about a year but we're also going to move forward in electing the church officials in the book of Jan or in the uh the book of January I don't think there's a book of January in here a month of January and we I I've made the decision to devote many of our Wednesday nights to to studying this Bible and to give an overview of the books that are in the Bible so when we come on Wednesday night or we stream in every book I want us all to remember something about that book what that book's about and going on in that direction and I did get one complaint um about our Wednesday night services and brother Lyall this one was about you I won't tell you who it's from um but she was related to the garas she said brother Daniel you're not giving brother Lyall enough [Laughter] time so so brother Lyall if we want to split these up into two Services we C we can do it we just want we want the people we're not digging in to digging into the foundation of the book we're not getting digging into the specifics we're giving an overview of it and and then the specific sometimes that's what Sunday morning is for is to take a couple scriptures and then expound upon those but we want to be able to give the um the church a uh a good understanding and I'd like to say about this church and and making changes um I believe something special has happened here I know I've said that before but I've seen I've seen an amazing amazing thing and I haven't seen it in the 52 years of my life is we've seen the a group of people who were steadfast in the way that they thought the way that they believed and I've seen people start to be more accepting and more loving and welcoming more people in and saying if you don't necessarily look like me or act like me we still want to worship the same Lord Jesus and friends I've never I've never seen that in my whole life and I've been associated with brother brandom's message since I was born in 1971 my family since about 1950 I've never seen this in my life a group of of people that have just been so caring and so loving and so willing to give I believe that's the very Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ himself I really do the church is for people that need to get better otherwise why would you need a church that's it's that's what it's for it's for us to come to improve on our lives and and of course get closer to the Lord I'm not saying I know that I've I've preached pretty hard I preach I preach on both sides I try to keep a balance I preach preach against sin and and and moving the ways of the world and I also preach against legalism over on this side and say be careful with that legalism but I'm not saying living that life is in any way wrong I'd be a hypocrite we homeschooled our kids you we didn't have a television we didn't we didn't have any movies in our lives we we tried to walk this perfect line in growing up and in raising our children we did the best that we could and trying to we we went to church every single service we even went so far as I wouldn't even and my family wouldn't even listen to any Minister other than brother brandom himself that's how far we were on this side but I have to tell you that in growing in our and raising our children and it was such a blessing that we would have I'd come home from work and Stephanie would have things ready the kids would be meeting me at the door there and I'd come in they they'd love on Daddy and we'd have dinner and then we would go into the living room and and we would have our Bible study and we would talk about the Lord and talk about his word and and we just had such a a good a good life and and I'm just I'm so grateful that the lord gave us that and what I want is that joy that we have had with our children I want everyone to have that same Joy even if you don't have parents that that that are believers even if you don't whatever situation you're in I want everyone to to receive that same thing that I received that my children received and I want this church to be able to provide it I want to have those Bible studies for the Youth and for all of us for the Sisters if you want to have a Bible study yes come in we we'll get that together for men's meetings for the brothers I want I want the kids to study the Bible I want you to have that because it was such a blessing to my family and we had such joy we made mistakes as parents and all of us would want to go back and change things that we did but God still He blesses our motives He blesses our efforts we try and we're doing the best that we can and he knows that and and we make mistakes and and and sometimes we'll suffer for our mistakes and our children will suffer but God knows God takes care of it all he knows our heart there was a uh suggestion that that came in about a month ago and it was put in the offering box and uh it didn't have a name associated with it I like it when it has a name because then I can go to the person and say hey what do you mean or a little bit more and so many people come to me and say well the people are saying don't ever come to me and say that because my first question is going to be who and if you don't tell me I'm going to assume it's you so but anyways there was a a a suggestion came in the offering Box about a month ago and I looked at it and like everything I I took it seriously and I've been praying about it and it said something on the order of I don't remember the exact I have I have the I have the paper um but it said something like we should take a service a week like we were doing for the book of Acts and we should take brother brandom's message and break it down like we did in the book of Acts and I pondered that suggestion and back and forth and and I i' I've prayed about it and I I've I've gone back and forth in my mind how we could do it but one thing I don't want to do is I don't want to fall into into the Trap that so many quote message churches have fallen into and dove into a quote here and a quote there and a quote here string them all together and build a Doctrine out of them I don't want to do that brother brandom when he when he preached don't forget this is different than than your Bible it was presented in a different way it's an audio it is preaching and here in the Bible every single book every single word that was written was reviewed and whoever the prophet was or the Scribe had a chance to look it over and this was exactly what they wanted exactly what God wanted in here brother brandham was preaching under the anointing and he was his message wasn't meant to dissect every little thing and even brother brandom didn't he said you make me nervous when you do that but yet we go and do it and I don't want to move into that direction because that's you know what happens when that then the church dies and friends I've seen it all over the world I've seen it so I want to be careful in doing that I was so I was looking in some old notes and I don't know this came from years ago but I wrote this and I believe the Lord just brought it back to my attention he I said this this is something I wrote we call ourselves and I quote message Believers and we know that God sent a modern day Prophet to call us out of the denominational system and into the truth but do we really know what the truth is do we really understand what that messenger was supposed to do to have a proper understanding of what God did and is doing in our day and to build a strong church we must have an understanding of this book I don't know why I I wrote that but I don't know what I was what I was thinking but it as I read that it brought my testimony and how I've come this walk and like I said I've lived my life after I gave my heart to the Lord as as a young man I've tried to live a very very structured and legalistic life and I I have for the most part lived that way and like I said it's been a blessing to me and it's been a blessing to my kids and in going through my life as I said I never I never missed a service but we never also never heard a minister we were always listening to brother bram's tapes in service so I was in the ministry as you know in in in Jeffersonville Indiana and Stephanie and the kids were here in Tucson and they were um visiting marily and Rod and and our family and I had to go back early to go back to work so this was this was in January and in 2012 and I was working late at night and I um was going through my my voicemails and and one of the things that I had the honor of doing is I had the honor of studying this message and then help helping other people that would call and they had a question on their heart a doctrinal question or something about maybe William brandom lied about this or he was wrong about that or or I'm having marital problems with my children whatever it was those questions would generally come to me and I would go through my voicemails and if if it was an email i' I'd take care of it or or a phone call I would call them back and and I got a I got a voicemail on my phone from a man that had a very strong Jewish accent sister Barber I told you this testimony the other day and it changed my life this man just left his name and he left his phone number and it was late at night I was I was working I didn't have anybody to go home to so I just worked late and tried to get as much work as as I could done and and I saw that his um area code was from Hawaii so I said oh well it's the middle of the day there so I I called him up and he tells me his testimony and like I said very very obvious he was Jewish he told me he was Jewish right away he was he was he lived in Jerusalem for a long time and but he was in San Diego as a young man and some he was he was sitting on the beach on a bench and someone walked up to him it was in the morning and someone gave him one of those little green Gideon Bibles you know which ones I'm talking about and gave him that and he looked up and he said he said I don't want it he says I'm Jewish and they said well you should read this and he says he said no I don't want to read it he says I'm not Catholic I don't want to hear about Mary he says he says I'm Jewish I don't want to read it and the guy says it's not about that you need to read this and he said okay and he takes the little thing and he brings it home and he says he tells me he says I couldn't take it and not read it so he opened it up and he started in Matthew and he read the all the gospels and he said in his in his heart and he was crying out to God he said he said Lord this is a continuation of the Bible he said this is not a gentile book this is not a Catholic book he said this is a Jewish book he said they're all Jews in here you see how he went through the book of Acts and we saw that progression he said this is a Jewish book he said this is God so he gives his heart to the Lord Jesus this little Jewish man this is way back I think it was in late 70s and he starts praying and he starts reading this book and he starts witnessing to other people and he has a gift in his life of a teacher of a rabbi and he's studying this and he's seeing that this is not for the Gentiles this was actually meant for us but we were blinded and then it went to these other people and he was very plain you don't matter we are superior was his was his attitude and I was like yeah but it's ours right now so he kept on and one afternoon or evening he was praying and he sees a vision and this Vision God comes to him and he said it was Jesus it was very similar to what happened to the Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus that book of Acts friends is very very important so he's he he he this light comes down and it goes right into him and he cries out to God and the Lord tells him he says that you have accepted me and I can't remember his exact words I have his exact words written written down in some of my notes that are packed away in boxes but he said the the vision told him said that you have received the Messiah and you are going to receive within a week you are going to receive a further revelation of this so the vision's over he said he tells me he said I feel like it would have killed anybody this experience that I had he said it was so powerful so he's praying about this a few days later a man knocks at his door and says can I share something with you and he says he says yes he says are you a Christian he says I'm a Christian he says I've just given my heart to the Lord Jesus I'm Jewish but I'm I'm a Christian and and and he tells him his testimony and the man says I've got something that'll be a blessing to you and then he tells them he says God sent a prophet according to Malachi chapter 4 and he said the Lord told me you were coming so the man stays with him seven days he stays with him in his home teaching him listening to these tapes the man leaves he was so on fire for the Lord he gets in his car he drives to Tucson Arizona to this very church and he comes in and he says I want this message so they he buys he spends all of his money and he buys a full set of those red books that brother green had printed there were all the sermons in order that we had transcribed big big set he buys that set of books runs out of money in Yuma trying to get back home has to go out and work in the fields picking uh I think he said Tomatoes forgot what it was no it's lettuce picking lettuce out in the field has to earn enough money to get enough gas to get home and then he starts reading these books about that time his beloved sweetheart he was a young man he's like 21 22 years old she's a good Jewish girl her parents said that he's not good enough for you so they arranged a marriage with another young man and it broke BR his heart so he says I'm leaving all of this by the way he died 2013 or 2014 and he lived a celibate and consecrated life to that woman his entire life died at 80 around 80 years old so he takes his books so in love with her he takes his books and he goes to Jerusalem and he lives there for decades and all he had was these bound sermons and he read them over and over again as I said for decades so he comes he gets he gets what's called Crohn's disease a deadly disease man most of the time among Jewish people and had a hole in his stomach and he lived just a horrible life he was going to die the only person that could do the the surgery was in Phoenix Arizona at the Mayo Clinic he he flies from Jerusalem to to Phoenix he has the surgery done and he goes and he moves to Kawai where Stephanie and I just went we actually went to his house when we were there we went to the place that he lived and to live out his days we ended up recovering and living many years after that all the time reading these red bound books that's the only thing he knew he didn't know there was anyone else in the world really that believed like this so you'll see my point in telling the story it's a very profound thing so he's gets YouTube on his television and he's tells me this story and he says I got YouTube he says do you know what YouTube is I said yeah I know what YouTube is and he says well I got it on there the first thing I search is William brandom and he said I started hearing all of these ministers preaching William bram's message and right about then I felt the presence of the holy spirit in my office telling me listen to this man and he tells me this he said you ruined William brandom's message oh and he tells me you're preaching all of this stuff that he didn't preach and you're taking all these things out of context and he says you're making up this big thing and you're ignoring the main thing so I went home and I made the decision I was this was um 2000 as I said 2012 40 years old I said Lord here I am 40 years old I was born in this do I really believe this and I said I do and I made this commitment I said but I'm going to relearn brother Ram's message I've said this before I'm going to learn it in the same spirit that it was given and that has been very very much a journey for me until this day cutting out everything all of the around the supper table talks and all the do that we all talk about I'm not saying it's bad we're talking about something good but it impresses all of us it impresses our children and all of the the conversation with friends and now I look at it in a very very different light thinking that no these things are not what he taught he may have said them one time time and that's good enough I believe it if he said it once he may have said it two or three times but then we ignore as my friend told me we ignore the main part of the message which is Jesus Christ himself remember in the last age in Revelation chapter 3 there's somebody standing on the outside of the church knocking to get in it's Jesus and it's the spirit of the people to cut them out to say to say I don't want you I've Got My Religion I've got my faith I'm special and what it has done it is made it to where we have split off and into a cult or a denomination or a sect or whatever you want to call it we have split off and now we are the Elite and we don't care about other people and that's why our churches aren't growing that's right that's why all the churches are shrinking is because we become this Elite sect of people saying that we're right and ignore what the Lord Jesus himself taught and especially ignore what brother brandham taught but even with that said the prophet Ezekiel said this I believe it's Ezekiel 3 Anointed with the Holy Spirit the the prophet said he says whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall they know that a prophet has been among them we should never cut out or disregard a gift that God has given us Brothers I'm sorry I I'm going to completely deviate from my notes um I want to read the parable of sowing the seeds it's Luke chapter 8 Brothers if you could give me Luke chapter 8 verse4 it says this and when much people were gathered together and we come to him out of every city he spake by a parable remember a parable is a story it gives that gives a valuable lesson a sewer went out to sew his seed and as he swed some fell by the wayside and it was trotten down and the fowls of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture he are being planted on infertile ground and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it and choked it and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit a h hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear Let Him hear look at Jesus is putting great emphasis on this Parable so much that he cried out with a loud voice it was very very important to him he must have been troubled as he was saying this and his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be so they could see that Jesus was troubled with this and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand he's saying that I don't speak as clearly in public as I do to you my close friends now the parable is this the seed is the word of God so this this man that's planting seeds these seeds sep they represent God's word those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved I see people all time they come to church they get a blessing but then some little things keep them from coming again and it's not just going to church that doesn't make you a Christian just going to church by any means I'm not trying to say that but there is always something that separates you from the Lord there's something that always is there from that prevents you from praying that prevents you from communing with God that's a Christian but there's something there that that separates you doesn't allow those roots to take hold this is listed first in where these seeds fall because I believe that it's the most common this is most people they on the Rock are they which when they hear they receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of Temptation they fall away so they get a little bit out there they start to grow a little bit but when this temptation comes it's stronger than the foundation that has been built in them and then theyve just they blow away how many of us see this they're not falling away to other churches they're not falling away to other to to staying home and worshiping all the time they're falling away into the world they're falling away from worshiping God they start with Zeal but it fades because there isn't any root in the gospel there isn't any root in the thing that will actually hold them and that is Christ and that which fell among Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection so it says here the the world is more important than their salvation they would never say that but their choices prove what they are and none of their fruits get ripe they're not a benefit to anyone they don't go all the way brother Mark that's the most important thing they got to go all the way take the last step I was talking with the other day with someone and was telling telling her about Jesus and I said Jesus tells us that if someone takes something from you to go and give them more if someone spreads rumors about you then you go and you speak kindly about that person if someone hurts you you do the opposite to them and lift them up and she says this she says yeah but no one really does that it's it's true but Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments he still said it and when we say that well no one really does that you're taking what he said and say I don't care I don't care what Jesus said nobody can do that but he wouldn't have said it if we couldn't do it he gave us this message to where we can live it the message of Jesus Christ The Gospel but when you say no one can re no one really does it it shows me that you don't want to do it it shows me that that your life is more important than whatever Jesus says but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience you can tell me friends you can tell me all you want about how much you believe you can tell me all you want about how good of a Christian you are and how much you read your Bible and you will and do all of that but your testimony is speaking so loud I can't hear your words show me the fruits in your life if you really believe the same with me Lord give me those fruits Lord my time in prayer let it be fruitful let me represent Christ these things that Jesus said Lord I want to do those things I want to be what he said to be now look and I see where's the burden for the lost you talk about Jesus Jesus our example I'd say he had a burden for the Lost he was sent to the Lost he died for the Lost yes and if it was truly there friends it would be outwardly visible there's fruit you can see the fruit on the tree no man when he hath lighted a candle cover it with a vessel so Jesus is telling them listen that fruit is to be displayed no man when he had lit a candle cover it with a vessel or put it under a bed but set it on a candlestick that they which enter in may see the light I love that for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither anything hid that shall not be known and come abroad these things that are hidden they'll eventually come out and it's strange to me it's very like like with Jesus's Ministry it's the opposite of what you would think it is if you confess your sins then they will be forever hidden so much so that they're wiped away if you confess your sins but if you hide your sins then they'll come out and they'll be displayed the opposite of what we think so I took a long time to answer the question about teaching brother Brown's message and taking some time as this person uh suggested taking some time and maybe expounding on some of these things that are what he taught and I feel yes I will do that I've given my life to this my mom and dad when I was in the the belly they were playing brother brother pom's tapes for me I grew up with it I know it I've studied it my whole life so yes I can I want to I want to do that I want to take some time and say Here's what brother brandom said about these certain subjects but brothers and sisters please I ask you be ready to be he corrected that no he didn't teach it like you think he taught it his message was not what you think his message was maybe maybe it will be but just be ready don't judge me I'm going to do my best to not put my own interpretation on these things I'm going to do my best to take what he said the scriptures that he used and go subject by subject and say here it is now it's up to you but let me tell you this and here's another thing that I believe that we have made the mistake in the ministry is we have taken brother brandom's message and then we've tried to explain it we've tried to say here's what he meant and let me take a quote here and a quote here and a quote here and I'll put it together and here's the doctrine I think brother Brandon would come and say what it's not my Doctrine what are you doing that's what we have done in the ministry and when that brother when he told me you ruined brother brandom's message me Daniel Evans is who I believe has done that because of my way of thinking that was uh let me let me read to you something brother brandom said and I'm not going to get to my notes today we'll uh I'll preach the sermon that that I wanted to preach this morning at another time brother Bram said this in God's only provided place of worship he said this now have you noticed every three years after a great meeting what takes place a denomination this is 20 years and no denomination dear dying lamb may it never do that if I go in this generation May the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination God will you will die right in your track remember that the very hour that you mention denomination among you I don't care how sincere you are take a man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm his word take a man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm his word that that's the hour you die the genuine seed cannot because there's nothing left after the seed it didn't bear fruit the parable I just read it's the same thing was at back at the beginning it's the bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again that's the one that fell on the good ground brother random said we're always saying it's brother brand said brother brandom said brother brandham said and we wonder why we don't see new converts friends we wonder why they don't know we take the Holy Spirit out and we replace it with something else replace it as brother brandom said with a man and those roots stop growing does that mean that we throw out the prophet sermons not this guy not me oh no I still listen to it and I I love it more now than I ever have I listen to it almost every day that doesn't mean that but he warned us we replac the holy spirit with an intellectual understanding rather than a Pentecostal experience when I say Pentecostal experience I don't mean what the world has replac Pentecost with how many times have we seen people shouting and praising the Lord and outpouring of emotion but then on Sunday but then on Monday they're the same person that they were before that's worship worship is good but that's not the Pentecostal experience the Pentecostal experience is receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost where Jesus Christ lives in you just like he lived in the apostles the ones that were there at the day of Pentecost the same Jesus Christ the Bible says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever so that same spirit that they had back then is the same spirit that we can have in us and it's not dependent on a denomination it's dependent on a relationship with God that's everything brother Braham said this I Pray for Mercy Lord questions and answers I pray for Mercy Lord have mercy on me help me it makes me nervous father I pray that you'll help me I don't want to seal my life all my work here would be out here some fanatic to lead some group or cult into a desert somewhere don't let my name have to go down like that Lord this is Brother Brown speaking I fought hard for this I'm sincere in it as I can be God don't let it happen happen help me some way I don't know what to do I'm just depending on you but you help me I'll do anything you tell me to do I'm your servant these are your children Lord most of these people 99 out of every hundred Lord is really solid they believe they know they understand and they know it's not me but I know these things has to follow every Revival and this is not immune from it so I pray that you'll help us now I can't make that more plain than brother what brother brandom said he said they follow every Revival that word follow the definition of it is to come after to proceed ahead afterwards come after in time or order so he says right here this is going to come after but Lord don't let it be and it's a spirit that comes in and divides and what it does is it takes out Jesus Christ from the from the church it takes out the Holy Spirit from the church and replaces it with a denomination when we start digging in to these subjects brother brandom said some of the most popular subjects we have one once or twice over here this one once or twice over here when he talked about the denom ational Spirit it was almost every sermon he hated it he was set on Earth to knock that thing down and then what do we do we come in and we do the same thing that he said don't do that and we form a little group and we tell the ministers pastors tell each other how to preach somebody came to me the other day said heard that you're you're you're kind of just you're kind of just preaching Jesus in the [Applause] Bible what else am I going to preach seriously what did Brother Brandon preach I just I think who could say something as ridiculous as that it's brother Brandon would be ashamed I love his message I just read most of half of what I've read I read about an equal amount of of quotes as I did Jesus's words but it was to lift up Jesus and to warn us pastor friend of mine called me uh a couple days ago a brother I love dearly he a good friend and he said his brother Dan he says uh I've been fellowshipping with with this this group of people that uh that they're not associated with us he said but these people are going to China and they're going going to Iran and they're going to these very dangerous places so they can get the message they can get gospel the Bible into North Korea and they're having secret meetings in China where they're worshiping God and he said they're risking their lives he says these are affluent people these people were well to do and they gave everything they sold what they had so they could pay their way and they could go to China or go to Iran R and live in danger he said he said brother he says how can I cut them out from the bride just because they don't believe like me he says they're doing more than I am he says they're doing more than we are I said brother why would we why would we want to cut something like that out friend of mine in Jeffersonville he and his wife were living in sin and and and going to the bar and and not living right at all just living really just just bad lives grew up same way I grew up actually very very similar and there was a friend of his that he worked with from Eastside Christian Church which is a mega church one of the biggest churches in the United States in Louisville this man his friend reached out to him and and counseled him and brought him to the Lord Jesus and brought his wife to the Lord Jesus and yet we're going to cut that man out and now my friend is preaching the gospel preaching the same message that we preach but he needed that person from someone we would say ah they're they're we'd call them denominational who's denominational that person or us Stephanie was she was telling me that she's a nurse at Banner hospital she was telling me that that that they had this homeless man that came in he got burned he uh he he had a cigarette and something caught on fire and he was trying to stomp it out ended up catching his clothes on fire and burning him pretty severely he comes into the hospital and he's there very simple guy doesn't doesn't have I doubt that he's he was strung out on drugs he just wouldn't he wasn't able to make his way in life wasn't capable so he's there in the hospital and the housekeeper this little Mexican lady had compassion on this man the man had no clothes everything was burned up he had no shoes this little lady goes to Walmart a housekeeper at the hospital buys him shoes buys them jeans a shirt clothes gives us to him she doesn't have anything it's the poor people that are the most generous why is that she gives to this man and he was so proud he was so happy that he'd been given this Stephanie said that because of his Burns that if he would have had to walk in in in some other pair of shoes he couldn't have walked it would have hurt him he had good tennis shoes that he could walk in and and she said that he was even able to walk and get around he was so simple he he he didn't know his social security number he didn't know how to get money he said he would get an odd job every once in a while painting and then just handouts and here is this precious little lady that no one would ever think twice about I believe she's gonna be a queen in heaven for doing what she did for that poor man I'm not talking about giving these people out here that are strung out on drugs money but Jesus said he said the poor you will have with you always those are the people that need help he said but me you won't have with you because he was going on but he said to help the poor and that little lady is doing it I looked at that and sometimes I think how much of a better Christian is she than me she's probably Catholic doing it these people just fly right under the radar but let me tell you something they won't be under the radar when Christ comes they'll be over the radar they'll be flying up receiving the reward that they've been given well uh we'll close and as I said I didn't I didn't get to the sermon that I wanted to to to preach today I'll get to it maybe next next weekend but in answering that question yes we should learn what this great man taught but we need to learn it in the Holy Spirit and not in an in intellectual understanding because when we learn in an intellectual understanding we will put our thoughts above it and if we just have that Spirit if we if we can understand why Jesus said these things if we can understand this book if we can understand what the prophet said then we will be able to go and do what Jesus said and not say oh nobody can do that yes they can sister Shirley's doing it you know look at you know brother Manny's doing it serving the lord I'm doing it I'm I'm doing the best that I can that's what I want brother Jordan if you could come with musicians let's let's go I want I do want to read one scripture that that I had and I was going to go through Romans chapter 8 and we will do it it'll be a blessing um let's go to Romans chapter 8 quoted a lot because it's it's my favorite thing to read when I need to be encouraged start with verse 35 says this I'm hard Stephanie says you're kind of hard on the people she says you you you know you're you're always and she wasn't criticizing she was just saying that that's my Ministry is is a corrective Ministry and and Friends one thing I I love you and I want us all to be there I want to be there and when Jesus says all of these things that someone might say nobody can do that we can do it and if we fail if we fail who can separate us from the love of Christ sh without tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep as for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord that's my God that's my savior that's my Lord that's who I want to be part of that's who I want to commune with that's I want that's every Prophet from Genesis to Revelation the whole span of the book every single one was lifting up Jesus Christ everyone and that's the one I want to lift up the prophet that I listen to every day that's who he lifted up that's who he loved and that's why his message changed the world it was all different you had the Pentecostal Revival and it went up and it died and then you had this man William brandom come in and start up this charismatic Revival that swept the Earth he changed it preaching against the denominational system against the denominational way of thinking and it changed changed me I love it friends we uh we have at least one baptism is there any anyone else brother the amamos we good okay we'll have a have a the baptism anybody that wants to be baptized if you would see brother Ed there in the back the uh the brother I believe it's uh young men if there's any sisters sister Gara I don't I don't see

on hold right there this baptism this thing that we do that we come in front of the people and we say I want to make a change in my life that what that brother was was reading that Jesus said that's
