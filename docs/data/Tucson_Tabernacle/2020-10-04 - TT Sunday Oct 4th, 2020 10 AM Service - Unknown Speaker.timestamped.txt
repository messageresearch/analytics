[1:02:31] we pray
[1:02:33] amen amen we'll read uh what i'm certain
[1:02:36] is a very familiar portion of scripture
[1:02:39] from isaiah chapter 55
[1:02:41] and uh we will read verses 10 and 11.
[1:02:47] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:02:50] from heaven
[1:02:51] and returneth not thither but watereth
[1:02:54] the earth
[1:02:55] and maketh it bring forth and bud
[1:02:59] that it may give seed to the sore and
[1:03:02] bread to the eater
[1:03:04] so shall my word be that goeth forth
[1:03:08] out of my mouth it shall not
[1:03:11] return unto me void but it
[1:03:14] shall accomplish that which i please
[1:03:18] and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:03:22] whereto i sin it amen i believe that
[1:03:25] this morning
[1:03:26] may the lord add his blessings to the
[1:03:28] reading of his word
[1:03:30] and you can be seated today amen we just
[1:03:33] read
[1:03:34] these verses from the scripture and and
[1:03:37] the the lord god is likening his word
[1:03:41] to the rain and the snow which which
[1:03:44] falls to the earth
[1:03:46] and that rain comes with a purpose
[1:03:49] amen that rain comes to quicken
[1:03:53] something that is already
[1:03:56] already in place already present
[1:03:59] though buried beneath the surface of the
[1:04:01] earth there there's a life there there's
[1:04:03] a seed there
[1:04:05] and when the rain falls upon it and the
[1:04:08] sun
[1:04:08] shines upon it when the conditions amen
[1:04:11] are
[1:04:12] are are such that it's conducive to life
[1:04:15] then the potentials that were hidden
[1:04:18] beneath the earth's surface
[1:04:20] bloom forth into life amen and so
[1:04:23] uh that that life that hidden life there
[1:04:26] is actually the glory of the earth
[1:04:30] waiting to be revealed and waiting to be
[1:04:33] expressed so when the when the rain
[1:04:34] falls upon it
[1:04:36] it reveals a hidden glory amen it brings
[1:04:39] forth something that
[1:04:40] otherwise would remain dormant or
[1:04:44] or would remain in a mystery form so god
[1:04:48] god sends his word to express
[1:04:52] his glory within his creation
[1:04:55] amen i know that the devil has done a
[1:04:58] lot
[1:04:59] uh to pervert the earth and to pervert
[1:05:02] even the the atmospheres of the earth to
[1:05:04] try to twist
[1:05:05] uh the earth into some other uh
[1:05:09] death and corruption and all of the the
[1:05:11] agenda
[1:05:12] of satan but i want to say this morning
[1:05:15] amen his purpose is defeated and god's
[1:05:18] purpose will prevail
[1:05:20] amen even though it seemed like he
[1:05:22] achieved a victory there in eden
[1:05:24] he really didn't win a victory all he
[1:05:27] did was made possible for god's great
[1:05:29] plan of redemption to unfold
[1:05:32] and for god's desires as a father as a
[1:05:34] healer
[1:05:35] as a savior and as a redeemer to be
[1:05:38] manifested and that that's one of the
[1:05:39] things
[1:05:40] i love every time it seems like the
[1:05:42] devil gets a punch in
[1:05:44] all it does is just give a greater
[1:05:47] opportunity
[1:05:48] for god's glory to be revealed amen and
[1:05:51] so we we serve
[1:05:52] a mighty god this morning amen
[1:05:55] and so i want to just begin by
[1:05:59] by looking back in eden this morning and
[1:06:02] and the great mystery that god was
[1:06:04] revealing there
[1:06:06] not only in the creation of the earth
[1:06:09] and the uh how he divided the the land
[1:06:13] from the seas and and the the heavens
[1:06:15] above the
[1:06:16] firmament above the firmament below and
[1:06:19] all of those things but yet
[1:06:21] even in the creation of the the botany
[1:06:24] life
[1:06:25] the animal life the birds and the fish
[1:06:28] and the the beasts
[1:06:29] of the earth amen there was a there was
[1:06:31] a higher expression
[1:06:33] that god was desiring to reveal and that
[1:06:35] was to
[1:06:36] to ex to to play something or to create
[1:06:39] something on the earth
[1:06:40] in his own image and that was man amen
[1:06:44] and man was created in the image of god
[1:06:46] and then he was formed into a body of
[1:06:48] flesh
[1:06:49] to exercise dominion over the earth and
[1:06:52] to be
[1:06:52] a god over this earth in its creation
[1:06:56] but even when that man was created there
[1:06:59] was a
[1:07:00] mystery within him waiting to be
[1:07:02] revealed
[1:07:03] and something that would be even more
[1:07:06] glorious
[1:07:07] in its expression amen was waiting to be
[1:07:11] separated from adam and revealed
[1:07:14] and and uh to become the further
[1:07:16] expression of himself
[1:07:18] and to even become an agency which would
[1:07:21] enable him
[1:07:22] to reproduce himself and to to uh
[1:07:25] for life to be multiplied upon the earth
[1:07:29] and so the bible tells us if we read in
[1:07:32] genesis chapter 2
[1:07:34] and and beginning at verse 21 the bible
[1:07:37] says
[1:07:38] and the lord god caused a deep sleep to
[1:07:40] fall upon
[1:07:41] adam and he slept and he took
[1:07:44] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[1:07:47] instead thereof and the rib which the
[1:07:50] lord god had taken from man
[1:07:52] made he a woman and brought
[1:07:56] her unto the man
[1:07:59] and if you look at the last phrase there
[1:08:01] of verse 23
[1:08:03] 22 he says and brought her
[1:08:06] unto the man now i like to
[1:08:09] i like to focus on that phrase just for
[1:08:12] a moment here and think about
[1:08:13] what must that have been like for god to
[1:08:16] place
[1:08:16] adam into a deep sleep to remove
[1:08:19] something from his side and
[1:08:21] perhaps to to take that portion of adam
[1:08:25] over into another area of the garden
[1:08:28] and form form that into
[1:08:32] the the the feminine expression of who
[1:08:34] adam was
[1:08:35] into mrs adam into uh adam in a bride
[1:08:38] form
[1:08:39] and and so to to be a beautiful creature
[1:08:43] adam wasn't so beautiful to look upon
[1:08:46] but here was
[1:08:47] a a beautiful revelation of himself
[1:08:50] amen and so then to to wake her
[1:08:53] to consciousness and maybe to lead
[1:08:57] her back through that garden until
[1:09:00] she reached the place where she started
[1:09:03] from
[1:09:04] oh my a journey of realization
[1:09:08] amen a journey of identification
[1:09:11] to be able to be taken back to the place
[1:09:15] where she came from
[1:09:16] and then you know no matter what else
[1:09:18] she saw in that garden
[1:09:20] all of the flowers all of the trees all
[1:09:23] of the other living creatures all of the
[1:09:25] birds
[1:09:25] all the the lakes and the forests and
[1:09:28] the mountains
[1:09:28] everything she saw there was only one
[1:09:31] thing amen that could truly reveal to
[1:09:34] her her identity i mean there was only
[1:09:37] one creature that she could truly
[1:09:39] bond with there there was only
[1:09:41] hallelujah
[1:09:42] there was only one thing she matched
[1:09:45] amen she was a matching piece to the
[1:09:48] masterpiece amen
[1:09:50] and only when she reached adam amen
[1:09:53] could she begin to realize or truly
[1:09:56] understand
[1:09:56] her purpose amen and and and the reason
[1:10:00] she had been formed
[1:10:01] and so the bible tells us in verse 23
[1:10:05] that when adam looked upon his wife he
[1:10:08] said this
[1:10:09] is now born of my bones
[1:10:12] and flesh of my flesh she
[1:10:15] shall be called woman because she was
[1:10:19] taken
[1:10:19] out of man so when adam made that great
[1:10:22] declaration amen this is now bone of my
[1:10:26] bones and
[1:10:26] and flesh of my flesh it confirmed
[1:10:30] to her that she had arrived
[1:10:33] back at her place of origin amen
[1:10:36] it confirmed to her that her search
[1:10:39] was over amen there was there was no
[1:10:41] need to look any further
[1:10:43] she had found her companion and then she
[1:10:46] had found the one
[1:10:47] that she would complete and the one that
[1:10:50] would complete her
[1:10:51] amen that was a true union that was
[1:10:54] taking place there
[1:10:55] and so we realized that prior to the
[1:10:58] fall
[1:10:58] she was co-equal with him
[1:11:01] whatever power she could watch him
[1:11:04] exercise
[1:11:06] she could realize i also have that same
[1:11:08] power
[1:11:09] hallelujah whatever whatever
[1:11:11] characteristics
[1:11:13] she observed in adam she could realize i
[1:11:16] too
[1:11:16] have these same characteristics oh
[1:11:20] my friend oh my
[1:11:23] my mind is is fast forwarding 2
[1:11:26] 000 years later after this was forfeited
[1:11:29] by the transgression
[1:11:31] and jesus said the works that i do shall
[1:11:33] you do also
[1:11:35] oh my what is well here was a second
[1:11:37] adam and he was
[1:11:38] speaking amen to his feminine expression
[1:11:41] to his church
[1:11:42] to his disciples and he said the works
[1:11:44] that i do shall you do also
[1:11:46] and greater than these amen he was he
[1:11:49] what he was trying to do
[1:11:51] amen was was was help them to understand
[1:11:54] i i i tell you this morning and this
[1:11:56] this may sound like i'm venturing out
[1:11:58] there just a bit but i'm not
[1:11:59] jesus didn't come amen to display his
[1:12:02] life
[1:12:03] simply or only for us to look upon him
[1:12:06] and admire him but by looking upon him
[1:12:10] we could come to the understanding of
[1:12:12] the realization
[1:12:13] of who we are amen when when
[1:12:16] peter recognized who christ was he said
[1:12:19] whom do men
[1:12:20] say that i have well he got all kinds of
[1:12:22] answers but
[1:12:23] then he said who do you say that i am
[1:12:25] and when peter said
[1:12:26] thou art the christ the son of the
[1:12:28] living god when peter recognized who
[1:12:30] christ was
[1:12:31] then christ immediately turns around and
[1:12:33] says and thou art peter
[1:12:35] amen he was placing peter positionally
[1:12:38] amen he was recognizing who he was
[1:12:41] and he says upon this rock i'll build my
[1:12:43] church
[1:12:44] and he wasn't talking about peter
[1:12:46] because peter was a failure
[1:12:48] he could hardly say or do anything right
[1:12:50] but jesus
[1:12:51] knew amen there was there was
[1:12:53] representation
[1:12:55] on the inside of peter amen the same
[1:12:58] qualities were there
[1:12:59] amen he was he was he was part of the
[1:13:02] same life amen
[1:13:03] and he knew the baptism of the holy
[1:13:05] ghost would quicken those potentials
[1:13:07] with him
[1:13:08] amen he said peter he didn't say if
[1:13:10] you're converted
[1:13:11] he said when you're converted strengthen
[1:13:14] the brethren
[1:13:15] amen so here uh i've got to get back to
[1:13:19] eden just for a moment
[1:13:20] but when god formed the the feminine
[1:13:24] part of adam
[1:13:25] he brings her he brings her back to adam
[1:13:28] and then adam makes this great
[1:13:31] declaration
[1:13:32] bone of my bones flesh of my flesh amen
[1:13:36] you have arrived oh my
[1:13:40] adam was a product of the spoken word he
[1:13:42] was a manifested son of god he was an
[1:13:45] extension
[1:13:46] of god's character and god's power on
[1:13:49] the earth
[1:13:49] and she was an extension of who adam was
[1:13:53] it means she wasn't just a bone or she
[1:13:56] was much more than than a bone or a part
[1:13:59] of him
[1:13:59] that that part of him that was removed i
[1:14:02] i
[1:14:02] i believe in many ways a bone was was a
[1:14:05] was a was figurative
[1:14:07] amen of something god removed from
[1:14:09] adam's side she
[1:14:10] she really wasn't just just a piece of
[1:14:13] bone but she was a part of his heart
[1:14:15] and she was the she was the very essence
[1:14:18] the very
[1:14:18] substance of who he was amen something
[1:14:21] that
[1:14:22] could could not be expressed from him
[1:14:25] in the in the male form oh my been in
[1:14:28] the feminine expression
[1:14:29] it could even express something perhaps
[1:14:32] amen even more glorious
[1:14:34] than the male expression but she wasn't
[1:14:38] just a ball
[1:14:39] and and she wasn't just a woman either
[1:14:42] she wasn't she wasn't anyone's wife
[1:14:45] she was adam's wife amen she was the
[1:14:48] fulfillment of what he had been longing
[1:14:51] for
[1:14:52] and she could give him the fellowship
[1:14:54] that he desired
[1:14:55] i mean she could truly be been be joined
[1:14:57] in union
[1:14:58] you know the the world is full of men
[1:15:00] and women today but only
[1:15:02] only one of those women is my wife amen
[1:15:05] only one of those men is your husband
[1:15:07] amen there's only one that you can
[1:15:09] truly bond with and and understand and
[1:15:12] share
[1:15:13] even the most heartfelt or the most the
[1:15:16] the most intimate things amen are shared
[1:15:18] between the two of you
[1:15:20] that's what makes you husband and wife
[1:15:22] oh i want to say there's a lot of
[1:15:24] churches across the world today
[1:15:26] but there's one bride amen even within
[1:15:29] those churches there's a mixed multitude
[1:15:31] of people
[1:15:32] but there's also individuals who make up
[1:15:35] that bride
[1:15:36] and they've been joined to jesus christ
[1:15:38] through spiritual union
[1:15:39] and through the baptism of the holy
[1:15:41] ghost and they're becoming the very
[1:15:43] expression of his life upon the earth
[1:15:45] amen i i didn't i didn't give my my
[1:15:48] title this morning
[1:15:50] but i i want to title this uh this
[1:15:53] thought or this message the power
[1:15:55] of prophecy the power of prophecy
[1:15:59] or of the spoken word and so adam
[1:16:03] when he when he made that declaration
[1:16:06] when he spoke those words
[1:16:08] even god god had made adam
[1:16:12] as a spoken word creation adam was a
[1:16:15] product
[1:16:16] of the spoken word and so now eve
[1:16:19] is being identified as she is being
[1:16:22] given her identity
[1:16:24] by the spoken word of adam oh
[1:16:27] my amen the the serpent had a voice
[1:16:31] and the serpent could communicate but he
[1:16:34] could not
[1:16:35] say you're born in my bone and flesh of
[1:16:37] my flesh
[1:16:39] amen he could pervert the womb amen he
[1:16:42] could introduce his life into the womb
[1:16:44] of eve
[1:16:45] amen but he could not redeem her amen
[1:16:48] only one could pull
[1:16:50] her back to him amen in redemption
[1:16:53] and be joined to her amen and that was
[1:16:55] her husband
[1:16:56] adam oh my friend amen if you if you
[1:17:00] just think about it it's glorious
[1:17:02] when you see christ and the bride being
[1:17:05] typed out here
[1:17:06] amen so the word of the word of god amen
[1:17:10] i believe
[1:17:10] adam speaking was the very
[1:17:14] thoughts of god speaking when adam amen
[1:17:17] exercised dominion of the earth what he
[1:17:19] was actually doing was taking what was
[1:17:22] in god's mind and he was expressing it
[1:17:26] on the behalf of god on the earth adam
[1:17:28] had the same creative
[1:17:30] power as god amen but he would never
[1:17:32] exercise
[1:17:33] anything upon the earth but what god's
[1:17:35] desires were
[1:17:37] amen and that is true also in the life
[1:17:39] of every born-again believer every son
[1:17:41] and daughter of god
[1:17:43] your life becomes the expression of
[1:17:46] god's desires
[1:17:47] amen when you're fully surrendered and
[1:17:49] you come to full maturity and full
[1:17:51] adoption amen
[1:17:52] your life here on the earth is the
[1:17:54] expression of god's desires
[1:17:56] so in so much that even the spoken word
[1:17:59] can speak through you amen
[1:18:01] and you can speak the desires of god and
[1:18:04] you can impart salvation and
[1:18:06] healing amen by becoming the mind of
[1:18:09] christ expressing itself
[1:18:11] through you amen we believe this morning
[1:18:14] amen you are the only jesus this world
[1:18:16] will ever see
[1:18:18] i mean you are actually the family of
[1:18:20] god in expression
[1:18:21] here upon the earth faith
[1:18:25] in god's word makes that word
[1:18:28] live in you
[1:18:32] oh my doubt is a very powerful tool of
[1:18:34] the enemy
[1:18:35] i believe sometimes we underestimate the
[1:18:38] power of doubt
[1:18:39] but faith is even more powerful
[1:18:42] faith in the word of god amen can make
[1:18:45] the word of god
[1:18:47] actually live and express itself
[1:18:50] through your being amen when something
[1:18:53] comes in
[1:18:53] to afflict your body a sickness or a
[1:18:56] disease or an infirmity of some sort
[1:18:59] amen faith in the word of god
[1:19:02] will dismiss that perversion from your
[1:19:05] body
[1:19:06] dismiss that sickness dismiss that
[1:19:08] disease amen
[1:19:09] by faith in the word of god amen because
[1:19:13] no doubt we we experience we encounter
[1:19:15] sickness
[1:19:16] and disease many are the afflictions of
[1:19:18] the righteous
[1:19:20] but the lord delivereth them out of them
[1:19:23] all amen
[1:19:24] so faith in the word of god is what
[1:19:27] makes
[1:19:27] it what's what gives the word expression
[1:19:30] in you
[1:19:32] you know i i for some reason this just
[1:19:35] comes to my mind
[1:19:36] just at this moment jesus was invited
[1:19:39] to a feast hosted by a man by the name
[1:19:41] of simeon
[1:19:43] one time he walked into that house
[1:19:47] he was he was not greeted at the door he
[1:19:49] was not given a robe
[1:19:51] he was not kissed by the host he was not
[1:19:54] anointed with oil
[1:19:55] his feet were not washed he was
[1:19:59] he slipped in unrecognized
[1:20:02] unnoticed and unwelcomed to the feast
[1:20:06] but there was a woman walking by on the
[1:20:09] outside amen
[1:20:10] who saw the lord jesus in that in that
[1:20:14] place in that home amen
[1:20:16] and saw amen an opportunity to go and
[1:20:19] worship him
[1:20:20] and she ran she got her her alabaster
[1:20:23] box
[1:20:24] she returned and somehow she made her
[1:20:26] way into the place
[1:20:27] and she knelt at the feet of jesus and
[1:20:30] began worshiping him
[1:20:32] now when she began to worship him it
[1:20:35] began to release
[1:20:37] something from him to her
[1:20:40] and then it began to release forgiveness
[1:20:43] it began to release healing amen she was
[1:20:46] pouring out her heart in worship
[1:20:48] and jesus amen it opened up the very
[1:20:51] fountain of god
[1:20:52] the very heart of god was open amen to
[1:20:55] that one woman
[1:20:57] oh my friend you know a self-righteous
[1:21:00] spirit won't do that
[1:21:02] a simeon a man simeon never received
[1:21:04] that
[1:21:05] amen but she received it amen because
[1:21:08] there was something
[1:21:09] in her that had the ability to believe
[1:21:13] he was the messiah amen she couldn't get
[1:21:16] that from the priest
[1:21:17] she couldn't get that from the religious
[1:21:19] leaders she couldn't get that from the
[1:21:21] religious orders of that day
[1:21:23] but she got it from the person of jesus
[1:21:25] christ by
[1:21:26] faith in who he was oh my
[1:21:29] it released the power amen to transform
[1:21:33] her
[1:21:34] from who she was amen unto a daughter of
[1:21:37] god
[1:21:38] isn't that glorious this morning so the
[1:21:40] right approach
[1:21:42] oh my let me say this this morning the
[1:21:44] right approach
[1:21:45] to the revealed word of the hour
[1:21:48] will release the power of the word to
[1:21:51] transform your life
[1:21:53] and others will look at that same word
[1:21:56] and see a scandal
[1:21:58] they'll see a falsehood they'll see a
[1:22:01] man or they'll see the mistakes of man
[1:22:03] or they'll even call it a deception
[1:22:05] but to the believer it's life it's
[1:22:08] healing it's forgiveness
[1:22:10] it's rapture amen it's all the
[1:22:12] potentials of the word released
[1:22:14] why because faith in your heart is what
[1:22:17] unleashes the potentials of the word to
[1:22:20] become a reality in your life
[1:22:22] amen so faith in god's word makes that
[1:22:26] word living to you just like mary
[1:22:28] it took an angel's visitation but that
[1:22:32] well
[1:22:32] really if you think about it all that
[1:22:35] angel was doing
[1:22:37] was making the word personal to mary
[1:22:40] was making prophecy personal to mary
[1:22:45] was connecting her as an individual to a
[1:22:48] promise of god's word saying mary
[1:22:51] now is the time and you are the
[1:22:54] individual
[1:22:55] you are the person this is this was
[1:22:58] prophesied hundreds
[1:22:59] possibly thousands of years ago amen
[1:23:02] but it's for your time and it's not only
[1:23:05] for
[1:23:06] this this era or for this time but it's
[1:23:08] for you
[1:23:09] as a person mary and when the angel
[1:23:12] connected
[1:23:12] mary to the prophecy even faith in her
[1:23:16] heart said
[1:23:17] be it unto me according to your word
[1:23:19] behold the handmaid of the lord
[1:23:21] immediately amen life was conceived
[1:23:23] within a room
[1:23:24] and she bore the life of jesus christ
[1:23:27] she bore the very manifestation
[1:23:30] of god's own life amen in a human body
[1:23:33] here upon the earth as a child amen
[1:23:37] now i want to say this too just moving
[1:23:39] into the thought a little bit
[1:23:41] god uses the agency
[1:23:44] of a prophetic ministry to visit the
[1:23:47] earth
[1:23:48] at the appointed time of the fulfillment
[1:23:50] of the promise
[1:23:52] to an appointed people to receive the
[1:23:55] manifestation of the promise
[1:23:58] to raise the faith to raise their faith
[1:24:02] that they are god's chosen and that
[1:24:05] god's word
[1:24:06] is speaking of them and since the time
[1:24:10] of moses
[1:24:12] god has used the agency of prophetic
[1:24:15] ministry to achieve this
[1:24:17] amen uh god spoke to abraham and said
[1:24:20] thy seed shall sojourn in a strange land
[1:24:23] for four hundred years and afterwards
[1:24:25] i'll deliver them out with the mighty
[1:24:27] hand
[1:24:28] that was prophecy but in order for that
[1:24:31] prophecy to be fulfilled
[1:24:33] amen even though the people were there
[1:24:35] now in egypt's bondage and had been
[1:24:37] there for 400 years
[1:24:39] it was going to take a prophetic
[1:24:41] ministry
[1:24:42] to come on the seat amen to awaken them
[1:24:46] that they were the people it wasn't
[1:24:48] another generation amen it wasn't
[1:24:50] something off in the future
[1:24:52] and that the promise that god had made
[1:24:54] to abraham
[1:24:55] was now ready to be realized in their
[1:24:58] lives
[1:25:00] did moses ever make a believer out of
[1:25:02] pharaoh
[1:25:04] did moses ever convert one egyptian to
[1:25:07] his message
[1:25:08] none that i know of but to the seed of
[1:25:11] abraham
[1:25:12] to the children of the promise there was
[1:25:14] something about his life
[1:25:16] oh my something about his message that
[1:25:19] resonated it captured their hearts
[1:25:23] so when they heard that man with the
[1:25:25] criminal record
[1:25:27] he had already killed an egyptian it was
[1:25:29] it was indisputable the man was a
[1:25:31] murderer
[1:25:32] but he was also an instrument in the
[1:25:34] hand of god
[1:25:36] amen to uh to be a catalyst
[1:25:40] for the promise of god amen for a people
[1:25:43] of god
[1:25:43] to be fulfilled at that time and so even
[1:25:46] though it brought more pressures
[1:25:49] it brought more hardship it brought more
[1:25:52] uh
[1:25:53] toil and struggle on them yet it was
[1:25:56] preparing them
[1:25:57] for exodus it was preparing them to be
[1:26:00] expelled even from egypt amen and
[1:26:03] preparing them to believe god to take
[1:26:05] them
[1:26:06] back to their land of promise or back to
[1:26:08] their their true
[1:26:10] heritage amen that god had given to
[1:26:12] their father
[1:26:13] abraham their place of dwelling amen
[1:26:16] so moses ministry amen was there to
[1:26:20] awaken people can you just imagine
[1:26:23] we've hardly been a nation i guess for
[1:26:25] 400 years
[1:26:26] and here are people that dwelled in
[1:26:28] egypt under
[1:26:30] its bondage for 400 years
[1:26:34] it had become slavery had become a way
[1:26:36] of life for them
[1:26:38] being servants be being the lowest of
[1:26:41] society
[1:26:42] had become a way of life for the
[1:26:45] the israelites there in egypt's bondage
[1:26:48] but it took the ministry of a prophet
[1:26:51] amen
[1:26:52] to help to to to awaken their
[1:26:54] realization
[1:26:55] you're not slaves you you
[1:26:59] you're in your true origin amen
[1:27:02] where you really came from you're not
[1:27:04] slaves
[1:27:05] i mean you have you have a possession
[1:27:08] you have
[1:27:08] uh you have land you have an established
[1:27:11] place
[1:27:12] in the earth you you have wells you have
[1:27:14] vineyards you have gardens
[1:27:16] you have dwelling places you you have
[1:27:18] homes amen
[1:27:19] oh my you you will be a feared nation
[1:27:22] of other nations of the earth amen so
[1:27:25] they had their faith
[1:27:26] had had to be lifted to this place
[1:27:29] amen to to enable them to journey out of
[1:27:32] egypt and and follow the pillar of fire
[1:27:36] back across the jordan amen into the
[1:27:38] canaan land
[1:27:40] so god used this prophetic ministry of
[1:27:44] moses
[1:27:45] amen to reveal his promise
[1:27:48] oh my and and it for that to become a
[1:27:51] reality
[1:27:52] now think about this for a moment it was
[1:27:56] it was actually more of a reality for
[1:27:59] joshua and for caleb than it even was
[1:28:01] for moses
[1:28:04] because moses would never dwell in
[1:28:06] canaan
[1:28:08] moses would never live to see
[1:28:11] canaan and occupy and establish
[1:28:14] but his message oh my his message
[1:28:18] quickened a
[1:28:19] joshua and a caleb and a generation of
[1:28:22] overcomers
[1:28:23] to believe his message amen and to walk
[1:28:27] even
[1:28:27] into a greater realization of what that
[1:28:30] promise meant
[1:28:30] than for the messenger himself to
[1:28:32] experience
[1:28:34] oh my so see it's not so much about the
[1:28:36] ministry
[1:28:37] or the the the vessel that god uses
[1:28:40] god wants to get your attention on his
[1:28:43] word
[1:28:45] god wants to lock your faith into his
[1:28:47] word
[1:28:48] god wants you to hear his voice god
[1:28:51] wants you to realize it's him performing
[1:28:53] the work
[1:28:54] amen in faith in god's word amen will
[1:28:57] bring
[1:28:58] you into the complete fulfillment of the
[1:29:00] promise
[1:29:01] amen and you you look at this this is
[1:29:04] something that's
[1:29:05] remarkable to me as israel made their
[1:29:08] journey there
[1:29:10] then we see they were they were feared
[1:29:12] people and and balak and the moabites
[1:29:14] became fearful that they would be
[1:29:16] swallowed up by israel and
[1:29:18] and balak hired balaam to curse israel
[1:29:22] they thought as a as a hireling prophet
[1:29:24] they could somehow
[1:29:25] convince him to pronounce a curse upon
[1:29:29] god's people
[1:29:30] but every time balaam went to curse when
[1:29:33] god spoke
[1:29:34] he blessed amen oh my if they can only
[1:29:38] realize
[1:29:38] god is the source of their success
[1:29:42] amen and you cannot defeat that but so
[1:29:45] you you watch this and you if you see
[1:29:47] what was happening there with balak and
[1:29:49] balaam
[1:29:50] you will see exactly what is happening
[1:29:52] in the day we're living
[1:29:53] balak thought he could manipulate that
[1:29:56] gift
[1:29:57] and so he took balaam you know when
[1:29:58] balaam first gave his prophecy of
[1:30:00] blessing over israel
[1:30:02] then balak said well well well come over
[1:30:04] here
[1:30:05] and let me show you these same people
[1:30:07] from this perspective
[1:30:10] let me show you another angle of them
[1:30:12] and this happened
[1:30:13] two or three more times where each time
[1:30:16] he thought
[1:30:17] if he showed balaam a different
[1:30:19] viewpoint
[1:30:21] or a different perspective if he could
[1:30:23] see their theirs their
[1:30:25] faults or their blemishes or their
[1:30:27] shortcomings or
[1:30:28] any of those things the natural side of
[1:30:30] things that somehow that would alter
[1:30:32] the prophecy but but what he didn't
[1:30:34] realize was balaam wasn't giving his
[1:30:37] opinion
[1:30:38] balaam was only speaking the mind of god
[1:30:41] as god saw these people
[1:30:43] and they although they were as full of
[1:30:45] faults as the moabites were they were no
[1:30:48] more perfect the people there were no
[1:30:49] better of people as far as uh of their
[1:30:52] constitution as
[1:30:54] as as men and women there was no
[1:30:55] difference but
[1:30:57] they were under god's provided plan they
[1:31:00] were under a bleeding lamb
[1:31:02] amen they were under a token message and
[1:31:05] they were following amen a ministry
[1:31:07] that was leading them to god's plan
[1:31:11] and god's purpose for their lives and so
[1:31:14] every time he spoke he spoke blessing
[1:31:17] and so finally in his last parable he
[1:31:20] looks upon the children of israel and
[1:31:23] he's and he says this
[1:31:24] i shall see him but not now
[1:31:28] i shall behold him but not nigh there
[1:31:31] shall come a star out of jacob
[1:31:33] and the scepter shall rise out of israel
[1:31:36] and
[1:31:37] shall smite the corners of moab and
[1:31:39] destroy all the children of sheth
[1:31:42] he actually looked upon the people of
[1:31:44] god
[1:31:45] and prophesied christ he prophesied
[1:31:49] jesus christ
[1:31:50] the coming of the lord jesus christ he
[1:31:52] could look
[1:31:54] upon broken pieces
[1:31:57] israel and prophesy a masterpiece
[1:32:01] oh my how wonderful the lord is
[1:32:05] amen we we look at our broken lives this
[1:32:08] morning we look at our broken families
[1:32:10] we look at our broken past amen
[1:32:12] and we see failure but if you can see
[1:32:15] yourself through the word of god
[1:32:17] you can see yourself through the eyes of
[1:32:19] god and through the bleeding atonement
[1:32:21] amen
[1:32:21] god sees perfection amen god sees the
[1:32:25] end result god
[1:32:26] sees what he's bringing you to and here
[1:32:28] balaam looks at a people a man full of
[1:32:30] faults
[1:32:31] full of mistakes and full of failures
[1:32:33] and prophesies
[1:32:34] the lord jesus christ amen
[1:32:39] the power of prophecy brother brennan
[1:32:42] makes a statement this is in
[1:32:44] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:32:48] he says the book of revelation has more
[1:32:50] symbols in it than all the rest of the
[1:32:52] books
[1:32:52] in the bible it has more symbols because
[1:32:56] it is a book of prophecy it's a
[1:32:59] prophetic book
[1:33:02] therefore it has to be understood
[1:33:05] by a prophetic class
[1:33:08] this book is not meant for everybody
[1:33:12] there's nobody can understand it hardly
[1:33:14] this book is made for a certain class of
[1:33:17] people
[1:33:17] on over in deuteronomy it says the
[1:33:20] hidden things
[1:33:21] belong to the lord that is right and he
[1:33:24] reveals to
[1:33:25] us his children the hidden things
[1:33:29] the carnal mind cannot comprehend them
[1:33:32] great things of the scripture
[1:33:33] because it's foolish to them but to the
[1:33:36] ones who are
[1:33:37] lovers of the word of god
[1:33:40] that's who the book was written to the
[1:33:43] church
[1:33:44] amen so if you are part of
[1:33:47] of of the you know just as i was saying
[1:33:50] uh adam was a spoken word product
[1:33:55] of the almighty god and eve
[1:33:58] was made of the same material he was
[1:34:02] mrs adam was made of the same material
[1:34:04] he was so he
[1:34:05] being a spoken word creation amen
[1:34:08] he speaks the word over her speaks the
[1:34:11] word to her
[1:34:12] this is now bone in my bones flesh of my
[1:34:14] flesh
[1:34:15] amen so because of of the
[1:34:18] substance amen that you are constructed
[1:34:21] of
[1:34:21] is what gives you a special ear
[1:34:25] amen it gives you a a you you're very
[1:34:28] keen
[1:34:28] may i say it this morning you've got a
[1:34:30] receiver that is built
[1:34:32] inside of you amen to to uh to resonate
[1:34:36] amen
[1:34:36] to the the the bible to the scriptures
[1:34:39] to the word of god and to the voice of
[1:34:41] god there's something about it
[1:34:43] that captures your attention amen it's a
[1:34:46] prophetic book
[1:34:48] and it is written to a prophetic class
[1:34:51] of people
[1:34:53] i like i like to look at the
[1:34:55] illustration of how
[1:34:57] when jesus told his disciples now they
[1:35:00] had cast out devils they had healed the
[1:35:03] sick
[1:35:03] they had exercised amen the the
[1:35:06] supernatural power
[1:35:08] of jesus christ they were an extension
[1:35:11] of his own ministry
[1:35:13] but yet even after all that they had
[1:35:15] experienced and after all the the damage
[1:35:17] they had done
[1:35:19] he still tells them terry ye in
[1:35:21] jerusalem
[1:35:22] until you be endued with power from on
[1:35:25] high
[1:35:26] there was even a greater uh
[1:35:28] manifestation or a greater expression of
[1:35:30] his life
[1:35:31] that was waiting to be fulfilled amen
[1:35:34] at the outpouring of the holy spirit and
[1:35:37] so when
[1:35:38] peter and those 120 believers
[1:35:41] came out of the upper room now after
[1:35:43] being filled
[1:35:44] with the holy spirit the world looked on
[1:35:48] and those who watched
[1:35:49] said what means this what
[1:35:52] meaneth this and a man
[1:35:56] who could barely say anything right
[1:35:59] prior to this time you know he was
[1:36:01] always speaking up oh lord it's good for
[1:36:03] us to be here
[1:36:04] let's build three tabernacles and he
[1:36:07] said
[1:36:07] all uh uh jesus told him said
[1:36:12] uh i'm gonna go to i'm gonna go and the
[1:36:14] son of man must go and be crucified and
[1:36:16] we'll rise again on the third day
[1:36:19] and peter said not so lord and jesus
[1:36:21] said get thee behind me
[1:36:23] satan for thou savers not the things of
[1:36:26] god
[1:36:26] but the things of man peter there there
[1:36:28] was only two things that i know of that
[1:36:30] peter ever said right
[1:36:32] prior to receiving the holy ghost and
[1:36:34] that was this
[1:36:35] to whom shall we go lord for thou alone
[1:36:38] has the words of eternal life
[1:36:40] and thou art the christ the son of the
[1:36:42] living god that's the only two things
[1:36:45] that peter ever said right
[1:36:46] but when he came staggering out of the
[1:36:49] upper room
[1:36:50] filled with the life of god the spirit
[1:36:53] of god
[1:36:53] the world said what meaneth this peter
[1:36:56] said
[1:36:57] these men aren't drunk as you suppose
[1:37:00] seeing it's but the third hour of the
[1:37:01] day now
[1:37:02] i like to say this peter didn't deny
[1:37:04] that they were drunk
[1:37:06] he just said they're not drunk the way
[1:37:07] you think they are
[1:37:09] they were definitely intoxicated but it
[1:37:12] was the stimulation of revelation amen
[1:37:15] it was not a natural stimulation from a
[1:37:17] natural substance
[1:37:18] but it was a spiritual stimulation from
[1:37:21] a spiritual source
[1:37:23] and peter said these men are not drunk
[1:37:26] as you suppose seeing it's about the
[1:37:27] third hour of the day
[1:37:28] but he said this is that that was spoken
[1:37:32] by the prophet joel
[1:37:36] now the holy spirit has filled peter
[1:37:40] and 119 other believers
[1:37:44] and it has given them the unique ability
[1:37:48] to identify to see their identification
[1:37:53] in prophecy in the word of god
[1:37:57] amen what might have once made peter
[1:38:00] ashamed
[1:38:02] to be acting and conducting himself that
[1:38:04] way might have once made peter apologize
[1:38:06] well
[1:38:07] i don't know why we're acting this way
[1:38:08] i'm sorry we'll we'll try to straighten
[1:38:11] up we'll try to go somewhere in it and
[1:38:12] pray through or
[1:38:14] get you know read church order or
[1:38:15] something like that but no peter wasn't
[1:38:18] apologizing now
[1:38:20] he wasn't ashamed now only days before
[1:38:23] he was ashamed
[1:38:24] to be to even be identified as a
[1:38:26] disciple of jesus christ
[1:38:28] but here he is now boldly proclaiming
[1:38:31] this
[1:38:32] is that amen the the baptism of the holy
[1:38:36] spirit amen was
[1:38:37] now empowering them with the ability to
[1:38:40] see themselves
[1:38:41] positionally placed within the word of
[1:38:44] god and to connect them to
[1:38:46] prophecy to make them unapologetic amen
[1:38:50] for what god was now performing in their
[1:38:52] lives
[1:38:54] oh my brother sister and to be filled
[1:38:57] with the holy
[1:38:58] spirit in the day and hour which we're
[1:38:59] living and be ashamed of god's prophet
[1:39:02] i don't think so to be ashamed of the
[1:39:05] message
[1:39:06] i don't think so amen to to put it all
[1:39:09] back in a man or a ministry and waiting
[1:39:12] for his return
[1:39:13] i don't think so the holy spirit amen
[1:39:17] joins you to your identification
[1:39:20] in the word of god and it says this is
[1:39:24] the present present-day expression of
[1:39:26] the word
[1:39:28] amen i forgive me if i'm
[1:39:31] saying like i'm throwing off on other
[1:39:32] beliefs or other movements but the holy
[1:39:34] spirit will direct you right to the
[1:39:36] center of the target
[1:39:38] brother madam said man is always putting
[1:39:40] god looking at what god has done
[1:39:42] or looking forward to what he will do
[1:39:44] and failing to recognize
[1:39:46] what he's doing right now but when peter
[1:39:49] was
[1:39:49] filled with the holy spirit amen he was
[1:39:52] able to identify what was happening
[1:39:54] right now amen i thank god for what he's
[1:39:57] doing
[1:39:58] right now in the bride of jesus christ
[1:40:01] amen uh
[1:40:02] sure there's some falling by the wayside
[1:40:04] sure there's an apostasy
[1:40:05] taking place but there's also a bride a
[1:40:08] man who's being
[1:40:09] wrapped in a secret chamber amen she's
[1:40:12] being
[1:40:12] in the time of trouble he shall set me
[1:40:15] upon a rock
[1:40:16] amen in a secret place there's a bride
[1:40:19] who's becoming enshrouded
[1:40:20] in her identification in the word of god
[1:40:23] amen she's becoming a mystic to the
[1:40:25] world
[1:40:26] and one day she's going to disappear
[1:40:29] amen
[1:40:31] why because of her identification in the
[1:40:33] word
[1:40:34] this is that that was spoken by the
[1:40:37] prophet joel
[1:40:39] oh my i'd like to i'd like to look at at
[1:40:41] your life this morning look at my life
[1:40:43] this morning
[1:40:44] this is that that was spoken amen
[1:40:48] by paul he'll have a church without
[1:40:52] blemish
[1:40:52] without spot without wrinkle glorious
[1:40:55] amen
[1:40:56] this is that this is that that was
[1:40:59] spoken
[1:40:59] i mean through through the through the
[1:41:01] church ages this is that that was spoken
[1:41:03] even by the seventh angel messenger
[1:41:06] oh my it's not just a prophecy it's not
[1:41:09] just something off in the future
[1:41:10] but now amen of fulfillment is living
[1:41:13] itself out
[1:41:14] through the very bride of jesus christ
[1:41:17] amen
[1:41:17] elisha could say this is that
[1:41:20] amen they they the sons of the prophets
[1:41:23] were looking
[1:41:24] for where where's your master going
[1:41:26] where's elijah but
[1:41:27] but elisha smote the waters of the
[1:41:30] jordan river
[1:41:31] amen with the mantle of elijah and said
[1:41:33] where
[1:41:34] is the god of elijah amen
[1:41:37] it wasn't so much a question as it was a
[1:41:39] statement
[1:41:41] because god was identifying the same god
[1:41:44] of elijah
[1:41:45] was now identifying himself as the god
[1:41:47] of elisha
[1:41:49] and he was performing the same works and
[1:41:51] the same signs and wonders
[1:41:53] and the same expression of the
[1:41:55] supernatural even in a two-fold manner a
[1:41:58] two-fold manager
[1:41:59] through elisha's ministry amen you
[1:42:02] believe that this morning
[1:42:04] prophet of god says all that spiritual
[1:42:07] union
[1:42:08] of christ and his church now when the
[1:42:11] flesh
[1:42:12] is becoming word and the word is
[1:42:15] becoming flesh
[1:42:17] manifested and vindicated just
[1:42:20] what the bible said would happen in this
[1:42:23] day
[1:42:23] it's happening day by day
[1:42:26] amen now look at the word for just a
[1:42:31] moment the word redemption
[1:42:33] redemption means it means to restore
[1:42:37] back that which was lost
[1:42:41] or it could mean that which was
[1:42:42] forfeited something that was lost
[1:42:44] or forfeited is restored back
[1:42:48] and so then restoration
[1:42:51] means to bring something back to its
[1:42:54] original state or condition
[1:42:58] with all of its original
[1:43:01] qualities now i
[1:43:05] uh i'm 42 years old and so
[1:43:09] lo i like to see classic cars i i really
[1:43:12] didn't live in the time i didn't live in
[1:43:14] the era
[1:43:15] when the when the muscle cars and these
[1:43:17] classic cars were being built
[1:43:18] and driven but i still like to look at
[1:43:21] them to me that it's just
[1:43:22] um you know to see how that could be
[1:43:26] formed and
[1:43:27] and all the things those cars could do
[1:43:29] but but so just look taking the car for
[1:43:31] an example
[1:43:33] if you have a restored uh let's just say
[1:43:36] a
[1:43:37] 1970 mustang
[1:43:41] mach 1 or whatever model it would be if
[1:43:43] you have a restored
[1:43:44] car and it's been completely restored
[1:43:47] back to its original form
[1:43:49] it is not only restored in its
[1:43:52] appearance
[1:43:54] you don't just have you know the the
[1:43:56] body of the vehicle
[1:43:57] the paint the doors and the hinges and
[1:44:00] the wheels and the tires
[1:44:02] you don't just have the original
[1:44:04] appearance of the vehicle that's part of
[1:44:05] it
[1:44:06] but you also have the performance
[1:44:11] amen if that car has truly been restored
[1:44:14] it has the same horsepower that it had
[1:44:17] when it rolled off the showroom floor
[1:44:19] or roll off the assembly line it'll
[1:44:21] still do zero to 60
[1:44:22] in the same amount of time and then
[1:44:24] it'll still it'll do
[1:44:26] everything that original car did because
[1:44:29] it has been completely restored and i
[1:44:32] want to say this morning we're
[1:44:34] living in the hour of restoration we're
[1:44:37] living in the hour when the original
[1:44:39] faith
[1:44:40] amen has been restored back to the
[1:44:42] church
[1:44:43] the original identity has been restored
[1:44:45] back to the church
[1:44:46] not only in appearances but in
[1:44:50] performance
[1:44:50] as well amen what the original church
[1:44:53] did
[1:44:54] amen the true church of the living god
[1:44:57] is still doing today
[1:44:59] hell hallelujah because she has the same
[1:45:01] power
[1:45:02] and that power is being exercised amen
[1:45:05] through the same body
[1:45:06] through the same members amen oh my
[1:45:09] friends
[1:45:10] and it can still meet the road amen the
[1:45:13] power is making it through the tires
[1:45:15] and it's pushing it down the road and
[1:45:17] the church is being propelled today
[1:45:20] by the power of god that is invincible
[1:45:24] everything satan has ever thrown against
[1:45:26] it has failed
[1:45:28] everything he's ever tried has been
[1:45:29] defeated amen he's used
[1:45:31] principalities he's used kingdoms he's
[1:45:34] used all the might of the political
[1:45:36] powers the economical powers the
[1:45:38] financial powers of this world but
[1:45:40] there's no power that can prevail
[1:45:43] against the people of god because they
[1:45:45] are the very word of god
[1:45:47] they're the very expression of his
[1:45:50] thoughts
[1:45:51] made manifest in the earth amen
[1:45:54] every time i i've been listening to the
[1:45:57] seals and
[1:45:58] every time the enemy rode out on on a
[1:46:00] horse
[1:46:02] white horse red horse black horse pale
[1:46:04] horse
[1:46:05] every time the enemy a man joined
[1:46:07] himself to a power to go forth to
[1:46:09] conquer
[1:46:11] the holy spirit amen release a special
[1:46:14] anointing
[1:46:16] for the people of that age not only to
[1:46:18] combat
[1:46:19] that enemy but to conquer that enemy
[1:46:22] amen the lion anointing
[1:46:24] the ox anointing the man anointing and
[1:46:27] then
[1:46:27] the flying eagle was the last anointing
[1:46:30] of see
[1:46:31] see oh my friend catch this the
[1:46:34] anointing is not only for the messenger
[1:46:37] or the messengers but the anointing is
[1:46:40] for the overcomer
[1:46:43] you are anointed with the same anointing
[1:46:46] as your messenger
[1:46:47] amen an eagle anointing is not just for
[1:46:50] the prophet
[1:46:51] but the bride herself is under an eagle
[1:46:54] anointing also a man
[1:46:56] which means she cannot remain an
[1:46:58] earthbound creature
[1:47:00] amen an eagle when he's earthbound he's
[1:47:03] actually a prey
[1:47:04] but when he's in the skies he becomes a
[1:47:06] predator
[1:47:07] amen he achieves a dominion over
[1:47:10] everything that's below him amen
[1:47:12] everything that's beneath him
[1:47:13] so the same anointing that anointed the
[1:47:16] prophet of god
[1:47:17] is still present today to anoint the
[1:47:20] people of god
[1:47:21] and to bring you into the complete
[1:47:24] fulfillment
[1:47:26] amen a lot could be said here i've i've
[1:47:29] i've noticed years ago i ministered on
[1:47:32] when god sends a prophetic ministry to a
[1:47:34] people of the earth
[1:47:36] the life of that prophet is not just
[1:47:39] there
[1:47:40] uh you know to do certain things and
[1:47:42] even peculiar things
[1:47:44] but the the the mannerisms the conduct
[1:47:47] and even the peculiarities of that
[1:47:49] prophet
[1:47:50] are saying something about the people
[1:47:54] when isaiah was it isaiah who i forget
[1:47:57] which prophet it was now laid on his
[1:47:58] side for so many days
[1:48:00] it showed a spiritual condition
[1:48:04] of the nation of the people of god one i
[1:48:07] believe was jeremiah married
[1:48:08] a harlot or prostitute showing that the
[1:48:11] church had gone into
[1:48:13] a prostitution or spiritual idolatry
[1:48:16] see those prophets lives said something
[1:48:19] about the people
[1:48:20] they were sent to oh my i'm thinking
[1:48:23] about a prophet of god
[1:48:24] that was sin in this hour and his life
[1:48:27] and and his experiences weren't for us
[1:48:29] just to look and admire what god did in
[1:48:31] him but it says something about the
[1:48:33] people
[1:48:34] amen if he was taken beyond the curtain
[1:48:36] of time it says something about the
[1:48:38] people amen
[1:48:39] it says something about what you and i
[1:48:41] are going to experience amen
[1:48:43] as the followers of that message and of
[1:48:45] that ministry
[1:48:46] amen so restoration and redemption
[1:48:50] restoration brings us back to
[1:48:54] the original state or the original
[1:48:56] condition
[1:48:57] with all of the original qualities
[1:49:01] you say brother tim is the is the same
[1:49:05] power that was released on pentecost
[1:49:07] sufficient to overcome today
[1:49:11] it's more than a match for the devil
[1:49:13] amen there it was falling on a church in
[1:49:15] its infancy
[1:49:17] now that same power is falling upon a
[1:49:19] church amen who's been built up in the
[1:49:22] oracles of god
[1:49:23] who's had the the seals revealed the
[1:49:25] mysteries of god
[1:49:26] unfolded oh my friends look where we are
[1:49:28] today as a body of believers amen
[1:49:30] and that same power is present amen to
[1:49:33] anoint us to be overcomers in this hour
[1:49:36] amen we should we should take courage
[1:49:38] this morning our faith should be lifted
[1:49:40] amen
[1:49:42] oh my and so here as a type of the bride
[1:49:47] john brother man and one place i believe
[1:49:50] it is brother brethren says john was a
[1:49:52] type of the overcomer
[1:49:53] in every age and he was especially a
[1:49:56] type of the bride of jesus christ he was
[1:49:58] that
[1:49:58] beloved disciple that leaned on the
[1:50:01] lord's bosom
[1:50:02] he was right there with christ at even
[1:50:04] at calvary when others had forsaken him
[1:50:06] and fled
[1:50:07] and so he was the only disciple that did
[1:50:09] not die death as a martyr
[1:50:12] prematurely but he lived to be uh he
[1:50:15] lived to be up in years
[1:50:16] and he even took the word of god and put
[1:50:18] it putting it
[1:50:20] into book form amen and so
[1:50:23] john was taken to the aisle that is
[1:50:25] called patnas for the testimony
[1:50:27] of jesus christ and so he was there and
[1:50:30] we
[1:50:31] we we watched john as he has taken up
[1:50:34] his call up he said he heard a voice
[1:50:36] behind him speaking to him and john
[1:50:39] turned to see the voice and he said i'm
[1:50:41] the alpha
[1:50:41] and omega and write the things that thou
[1:50:44] seest in a book and
[1:50:45] send it to the churches that are in asia
[1:50:47] and so he brings him through those
[1:50:49] seven church ages and christ in every
[1:50:52] age
[1:50:53] is revealing himself in the midst of
[1:50:55] that church
[1:50:58] amen seven golden candle sticks seven
[1:51:01] lamb stands there's christ right in the
[1:51:03] center of it
[1:51:04] he's revealing himself amen when balaam
[1:51:07] looked at israel he prophesied christ
[1:51:10] when john looked at the church ages
[1:51:12] he saw christ standing in the midst of
[1:51:15] them amen
[1:51:16] when the king looked into the fiery
[1:51:18] furnace he didn't just see three hebrews
[1:51:20] he saw the fourth man the like unto the
[1:51:23] son of man
[1:51:23] standing there with him amen so even in
[1:51:26] laodicea amen
[1:51:27] christ is still dwelling with his church
[1:51:30] and in his church
[1:51:32] amen his his eternal presence
[1:51:35] with his body he's being identified with
[1:51:38] his bride amen
[1:51:39] we should be thankful for that this
[1:51:41] morning oh my
[1:51:43] i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk
[1:51:45] the narrow way
[1:51:46] for the hand of god in all my life i see
[1:51:49] the reason of my bliss
[1:51:51] yes the secret all is this for the
[1:51:53] comforter abides with me
[1:51:56] amen jesus told his disciples he said
[1:51:59] i must go away he said it's expedient
[1:52:03] for you
[1:52:03] that i go away it's to your benefit
[1:52:08] how could jesus
[1:52:11] as a mortal man that could be seen
[1:52:14] that could be heard that could be
[1:52:16] touched and
[1:52:18] declared by the natural senses how could
[1:52:20] him leaving them in that form
[1:52:23] be to their benefit
[1:52:27] but he said it's exceeded for you then i
[1:52:29] go away
[1:52:31] for if i go not away the comforter will
[1:52:33] not come
[1:52:35] but if i go away i will send the
[1:52:37] comforter
[1:52:38] and he will be with you even
[1:52:41] in you even to the end of the world
[1:52:45] amen we have think about this this
[1:52:48] morning
[1:52:48] we have something that is greater than
[1:52:50] the physical presence of jesus christ
[1:52:54] we have his indwelling abiding presence
[1:52:57] and his life
[1:52:58] and his spirit to point us to
[1:53:01] the revealed word for our day
[1:53:05] and to make that word to make the power
[1:53:08] of that prophecy live in us
[1:53:12] and make it a reality to us now here is
[1:53:15] john
[1:53:16] he's been taken to patmos he's seen the
[1:53:18] church ages unfolded
[1:53:20] and christ's presence in the midst of
[1:53:22] every age
[1:53:23] and the people of that age the
[1:53:24] predestinated of that age and then a
[1:53:26] voice speaks to john
[1:53:28] and says john come up higher i've got
[1:53:31] something else to reveal to you
[1:53:32] and john has taken in a type of the
[1:53:34] rapture and he's called up and there
[1:53:37] he sees in revelations chapter 5 he sees
[1:53:40] one
[1:53:40] seated on the throne and he hears a
[1:53:43] voice crying who is worthy
[1:53:44] to come and take the book and open it
[1:53:48] to loose the seals thereof and to reveal
[1:53:50] it i'm paraphrasing it
[1:53:52] and john said no man in heaven no man in
[1:53:54] earth was found worthy
[1:53:56] to take the book and to loose the seals
[1:53:58] thereof
[1:54:00] and i wept much because no man was
[1:54:02] worthy
[1:54:04] so john is here in this in this
[1:54:07] broken weeping despondent
[1:54:10] a despair this condition amen he said i
[1:54:13] wept much
[1:54:15] why because he realized the uh the
[1:54:18] implications
[1:54:20] of what this meant if this book were to
[1:54:23] remain sealed
[1:54:25] and no one was worthy to open it or to
[1:54:28] loose the seals thereof
[1:54:29] now if you look here and i didn't
[1:54:32] appreciate the brothers bringing it up
[1:54:34] so quickly there but look
[1:54:36] here no man in verse 4 no man was found
[1:54:40] worthy to
[1:54:41] open and to read the book neither to
[1:54:44] look there on
[1:54:45] now in my way of looking at this or my
[1:54:48] way of seeing this if i
[1:54:50] understand this verse of scripture
[1:54:52] correctly
[1:54:53] it requires the same level of worthiness
[1:54:58] to look on the book as it does
[1:55:01] to open the book and to read the book
[1:55:06] because it says no man was found worthy
[1:55:09] to
[1:55:10] open the book neither to look
[1:55:13] thereon so to me those require both
[1:55:17] the same level of worthiness now this
[1:55:20] leads to something
[1:55:22] in this condition john began weeping
[1:55:25] and now john wasn't commissioned to weep
[1:55:28] john was commissioned to watch john was
[1:55:31] commissioned to keep his
[1:55:33] eyes on the unfolding or the development
[1:55:35] of this vision
[1:55:36] because he was supposed to write this
[1:55:38] and send it back to the church
[1:55:40] so in his weeping condition he was
[1:55:43] missing
[1:55:44] the next phase and then an elder
[1:55:47] an elder catches his attention and says
[1:55:49] weep not john
[1:55:51] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:55:55] hath prevailed to open the book
[1:55:57] and to loose the seals thereof and so
[1:56:00] john looked
[1:56:01] and and then when the lamb came he
[1:56:03] stepped forth he took the book out of
[1:56:05] the right hand
[1:56:06] then we see the the uh
[1:56:10] the um the four and four beasts
[1:56:13] four and twenty elders they fell down
[1:56:15] they poured out their vials of odors the
[1:56:17] prayers of the saints
[1:56:18] and they sing a new song if you'll
[1:56:21] notice before
[1:56:22] they only say thou art worthy thou hast
[1:56:25] created all things and for thy pleasure
[1:56:28] they were created
[1:56:29] but now they sing thou hast redeemed us
[1:56:34] unto our god oh my you
[1:56:37] have restored us to our original
[1:56:41] identity you have replaced
[1:56:44] us you have taken us back to our place
[1:56:47] of origin to redeem you could never be
[1:56:51] redeemed back
[1:56:52] if you hadn't fallen from that place
[1:56:55] originally
[1:56:56] or in the first place oh my but when the
[1:56:59] book is open
[1:57:00] when the seals are revealed amen when
[1:57:03] when the lamb
[1:57:04] takes that book their worship changes
[1:57:08] thou art worthy to take the book and to
[1:57:10] open the seals thereof
[1:57:11] for thou was slain and hast redeemed us
[1:57:13] to god by thy blood out of every kindred
[1:57:16] and tongue
[1:57:16] and people and nation it just took down
[1:57:18] every barrier
[1:57:19] it doesn't matter what race what culture
[1:57:23] what creed what religion what
[1:57:25] denomination doesn't matter your skin
[1:57:27] color doesn't matter if you were slave
[1:57:29] or free
[1:57:30] bond whatever amen the blood takes care
[1:57:32] of all of that
[1:57:34] redemption takes care of all of that
[1:57:35] brings us all back into one great family
[1:57:38] of god amen
[1:57:40] and has made us unto our god kings and
[1:57:42] priests and we
[1:57:44] shall reign on the earth
[1:57:47] when the lamb took that book and
[1:57:51] loose the seals thereof he revealed the
[1:57:54] names
[1:57:54] of that book and made john to realize
[1:57:58] his name was in the book also
[1:58:02] for john to be able to look upon that
[1:58:05] book
[1:58:06] and to see his name there meant that the
[1:58:09] lamb had imparted
[1:58:10] his same righteousness and his same
[1:58:13] worthiness
[1:58:14] to john amen
[1:58:19] showing listen the bible says jesus
[1:58:22] thought it not
[1:58:23] robbery to be equal with god
[1:58:26] he realized he was a son of god he was
[1:58:29] the manifested life of god
[1:58:31] he was a spoken word product of god and
[1:58:34] every son and daughter of god
[1:58:36] comes to this same realization amen by
[1:58:39] the lamb he took your sins
[1:58:41] amen placed them beneath the bleach of
[1:58:43] his blood and restored you back to your
[1:58:46] original state
[1:58:48] your original quality oh
[1:58:51] my your original position as sons and
[1:58:54] daughters of god you talk about
[1:58:55] something to make you worship
[1:58:57] you talk about something that make you
[1:58:59] just bubble over with praise amen
[1:59:02] oh my the one who did this for my behalf
[1:59:05] and has redeemed us
[1:59:06] back to this great estate
[1:59:09] that was fallen from think about it
[1:59:12] friend
[1:59:14] amen the same and has imparted his own
[1:59:16] worthiness
[1:59:17] his own righteousness his own holiness
[1:59:20] has imparted that
[1:59:21] to his people whose names were written
[1:59:24] on that book
[1:59:24] before the before the foundation of the
[1:59:28] world
[1:59:29] written there in the lamb's book of life
[1:59:31] and he's come to reveal that
[1:59:33] to call those names from that book amen
[1:59:36] and when john you know here's the thing
[1:59:38] now
[1:59:40] think about this john
[1:59:44] was a disciple of jesus christ
[1:59:47] knew him as a man walked with him on the
[1:59:50] earth
[1:59:50] saw the supernatural saw the miracles
[1:59:53] performed
[1:59:54] and was there as i said he was there at
[1:59:56] calvary he was standing at the foot of
[1:59:58] the cross
[1:59:59] when he was crucified and he was a
[2:00:01] witness of the resurrection
[2:00:04] but only after this experience
[2:00:08] on patmos does john
[2:00:11] begin to fully understand what
[2:00:15] all of that meant for him as an
[2:00:18] individual
[2:00:20] think about that is revelation important
[2:00:24] oh my friend we can't uh we
[2:00:27] underestimate
[2:00:28] the power of revelation amen but it's
[2:00:31] the power of revelation
[2:00:32] that gives us victory it's the power of
[2:00:35] revelation
[2:00:36] that enables us to prevail over every
[2:00:38] attack of satan
[2:00:40] what's what is what is really the attack
[2:00:42] of satan
[2:00:45] to give you a lesser identity
[2:00:49] that is really all the devil is working
[2:00:51] to achieve
[2:00:52] is to reduce in your sight
[2:00:56] and in your vision in your in your
[2:00:58] self-perception
[2:01:00] he wants to pervert the way you realize
[2:01:04] who you are because if he can lower
[2:01:08] you then he can alter and pervert your
[2:01:11] life
[2:01:12] and and hinder you from coming to the
[2:01:14] full potential that god has called you
[2:01:16] to be
[2:01:17] but god just as hard as satan is working
[2:01:20] to try to undermine or try to reduce
[2:01:24] your identity
[2:01:25] god is working even more so
[2:01:28] to restore your identity to reveal your
[2:01:30] identity to you
[2:01:32] and to make you to know that angel
[2:01:34] stayed right there with mary
[2:01:36] until she finally accepted it and said
[2:01:39] be it unto me
[2:01:40] because the bible says she cast in her
[2:01:42] mind what manner of salutation
[2:01:44] this should be amen but the angel stayed
[2:01:47] right there with her
[2:01:48] until it locked in her heart and she
[2:01:50] said be it unto me
[2:01:52] according to thy word behold the
[2:01:53] handmaid of the lord then the angel
[2:01:55] realized it's a sealed deal now
[2:01:57] amen it's already done nothing can stop
[2:02:00] the life from coming forth
[2:02:02] and so friends i'm going to tell you
[2:02:04] something this morning
[2:02:05] only the revealed word of the hour can
[2:02:08] give you your identification
[2:02:10] there's no other creature amen there's
[2:02:13] no other species
[2:02:14] there's no other form of life in all the
[2:02:16] earth amen that can
[2:02:18] tell you who you are and where you came
[2:02:19] from but the word can
[2:02:22] and the word will and the word has been
[2:02:25] sent
[2:02:25] to reveal to you and i who we are
[2:02:29] as sons and daughters of god and when
[2:02:31] that revelation strikes our heart and it
[2:02:34] really anchors in there
[2:02:35] we are amen there will be nothing the
[2:02:37] devil can do with you
[2:02:39] amen it will make you invincible
[2:02:43] so the experience of seeing his name
[2:02:46] in the book that's what identified to
[2:02:50] john
[2:02:51] what all of those other experiences
[2:02:54] in his life the true meaning the true
[2:02:58] essence of them
[2:02:59] why he why christ lived and died and was
[2:03:02] raised and ascended
[2:03:04] why pentecost took place if john's name
[2:03:06] hadn't been on the book
[2:03:08] pentecost amen he would have been a
[2:03:10] bystander
[2:03:11] oh my he would have been an onlooker but
[2:03:14] i want to tell you when your name is on
[2:03:15] the book you won't be a spectator
[2:03:18] you'll be a participant and that holy
[2:03:20] spirit will be expressing itself
[2:03:22] through your life as well amen how many
[2:03:24] would say this morning lord i don't want
[2:03:26] to be a spectator amen i want to be a
[2:03:29] participant
[2:03:30] i want the life of the word i want the
[2:03:32] life of the message
[2:03:33] expressing itself through me be it unto
[2:03:36] me lord
[2:03:37] be it unto me according to thy word lord
[2:03:40] i know i'm a failure i know i have
[2:03:42] shortcomings
[2:03:43] i know i have faults but i'm looking to
[2:03:45] your word
[2:03:46] i'm depending on your word my confidence
[2:03:49] lord
[2:03:50] is not in the clay but it's in the
[2:03:52] potter
[2:03:53] it's in the maker it's in the creator
[2:03:55] it's in the one who ordained me to be
[2:03:56] who i
[2:03:57] am amen what
[2:04:00] was it that caused you
[2:04:04] to be attracted to the message
[2:04:07] you ever thought about that why did it
[2:04:10] attract your interest
[2:04:12] why did it draw you from whatever
[2:04:15] denomination whatever belief
[2:04:17] you know if you knew my testimony
[2:04:21] some of the churches i've come through
[2:04:22] in movements and doctrines
[2:04:25] my i i was never in in a
[2:04:29] a recognized denomination but there's a
[2:04:32] lot of denominational spirits
[2:04:34] even within the ranks of the message
[2:04:37] that have gone
[2:04:38] off of uh you know off out into
[2:04:41] fanaticism and
[2:04:42] and defaults doctrine and all of these
[2:04:44] things and perverted the lives of
[2:04:46] of hundreds or thousands of people but
[2:04:49] yet the message somehow amen held me
[2:04:53] and the message drew me the truth of the
[2:04:55] word of god pulled me amen even through
[2:04:57] those things amen it kept me
[2:05:00] and here i am today amen because of the
[2:05:03] truth because of the message someone
[2:05:06] um lord help me not to say something
[2:05:08] wrong here but
[2:05:10] i i saw some time ago
[2:05:13] an interview and they'd asked a person
[2:05:15] said what do you think about
[2:05:17] the people leaving the ministry of
[2:05:20] brother bradham
[2:05:20] and the message and and he said well you
[2:05:23] know they've been
[2:05:23] perhaps they've been hurt they've been
[2:05:26] wounded and
[2:05:27] and and they've been exposed to
[2:05:28] fanaticism and a lack of balance and all
[2:05:30] these things and
[2:05:31] maybe that's contributed to it but you
[2:05:33] know i looked in my own life
[2:05:35] i thought i've come through all sorts of
[2:05:39] things
[2:05:40] but i knew that wasn't the message
[2:05:43] i knew that wasn't the message i knew
[2:05:46] that wasn't what brother bradham taught
[2:05:48] i knew that wasn't balanced and so i
[2:05:51] never conflated the two
[2:05:54] i never i never accused brother branham
[2:05:58] of polygamy doctrine and all these other
[2:06:01] things amen i knew the message didn't
[2:06:03] teach that
[2:06:05] but you see amen if if it's not if
[2:06:08] there's not
[2:06:08] some predestinated representation that
[2:06:11] on the inside of you
[2:06:12] something will come to make you offended
[2:06:17] something will come to make the truth
[2:06:20] and jesus christ and reveal in the form
[2:06:22] of the word
[2:06:23] making an offense to you
[2:06:26] you say brother tim i not me brother i'm
[2:06:29] exempt from that
[2:06:30] let me tell you something john the
[2:06:32] baptist
[2:06:33] got his eagle eyes filmed over and was
[2:06:36] down there in prison saying art thou the
[2:06:38] cry art thou he or should we look for
[2:06:40] another
[2:06:42] he almost in a sense almost denied
[2:06:46] the advent of the very purpose of his
[2:06:50] own ministry to introduce that ministry
[2:06:53] and here he is questioning that
[2:06:55] oh my but when he questioned jesus
[2:06:58] christ reaffirmed
[2:07:00] amen he might have he might have lost
[2:07:02] his realization of who christ was
[2:07:04] but jesus didn't lose his recollection
[2:07:07] of who john was
[2:07:08] because john was one of his amen he said
[2:07:12] you go tell that fox amen go tell them
[2:07:14] the the the dead are raised the
[2:07:16] blinded eyes are open and the gosp the
[2:07:18] poor have the gospel preached to them
[2:07:21] amen so don't don't think you're beyond
[2:07:24] uh temptation or you're
[2:07:26] immune from the devil's attack but the
[2:07:28] the truth will hold you i believe that
[2:07:30] this morning amen
[2:07:31] and and the power of of the power of
[2:07:34] god's love will restore you
[2:07:37] amen but we're living we know we're
[2:07:40] living in a
[2:07:40] in a great shaking hour but i thank god
[2:07:44] that to me
[2:07:45] the message means more to me now than
[2:07:47] it's ever meant
[2:07:48] to be the prophecies are more pertinent
[2:07:51] and more relevant now
[2:07:52] than they were when they were spoken
[2:07:54] perhaps amen
[2:07:55] and not only do i see that but i see
[2:07:57] what it is doing in my life
[2:08:00] and in the lives of the believers and i
[2:08:02] know god
[2:08:03] sent an eliezer to select the bride and
[2:08:08] lead her to isaac
[2:08:09] amen and that personal experience in my
[2:08:12] life is what makes me know
[2:08:14] he's a true servant of christ amen so
[2:08:17] what caused you
[2:08:18] to be attracted to the message like mrs
[2:08:21] adam
[2:08:22] who was made of the same material he was
[2:08:25] you are mrs jesus christ and you are
[2:08:29] drawn
[2:08:29] by the power of the spoken word
[2:08:33] just as adam's voice in genesis
[2:08:36] confirmed to her that she had reached
[2:08:39] the place
[2:08:40] where she originated from god has
[2:08:43] spoken to the bride again in this hour
[2:08:47] amen oh my you you look at the
[2:08:50] the you say brother tim are you winding
[2:08:53] up i am winding up i'm
[2:08:55] i'm wrapping up just hold on just a
[2:08:56] moment but in god's threefold purpose
[2:08:59] the brother brethren describes and
[2:09:00] christ is the mystery of god reveal to
[2:09:02] reveal himself in christ
[2:09:04] to gain preeminences in his church and
[2:09:06] to restore
[2:09:07] back to eden and then he comes and he
[2:09:11] preaches in the message it is the rising
[2:09:13] of the son
[2:09:14] and in that message he says and i'm just
[2:09:17] jumping right into the middle of the
[2:09:18] paragraph
[2:09:19] and he says because she is flesh of his
[2:09:22] flesh
[2:09:24] bone of his bone life of his life
[2:09:27] power of his power she is him
[2:09:31] the prophet of god is identifying the
[2:09:33] bride amen
[2:09:34] as having the same qualities the same
[2:09:37] characteristics
[2:09:38] the same life the same nature and as the
[2:09:41] very
[2:09:42] same product as the groom was
[2:09:46] jesus christ oh my friends to me
[2:09:50] this is essentially the same thing that
[2:09:53] was taking place
[2:09:54] when adam said this is now flesh of my
[2:09:57] flesh
[2:09:58] and bone in my bone amen your searching
[2:10:01] is over
[2:10:02] your journeying is over there's no more
[2:10:04] wandering through the garden
[2:10:05] you have arrived amen no more
[2:10:09] no more hidden truth no more shadows no
[2:10:12] more darkness
[2:10:13] no more partial realization you have
[2:10:17] arrived
[2:10:18] at the full realization of who you are
[2:10:21] and the holy spirit is speaking to
[2:10:24] identify you
[2:10:26] oh my you know friends it's not what we
[2:10:28] say of ourselves
[2:10:30] it's what the holy spirit says even
[2:10:33] jesus took his disciples on the mount of
[2:10:35] transfiguration
[2:10:36] and a voice spoke from heaven this is my
[2:10:39] beloved son
[2:10:40] in whom i am well pleased hear ye him
[2:10:43] amen
[2:10:44] notice the harmony of the father and the
[2:10:46] son
[2:10:48] jesus never did anything until it was
[2:10:51] first showed him by the father john 5
[2:10:54] 19 this harmony is now
[2:10:58] to exist between the groom and the bride
[2:11:02] he shows her his word of life
[2:11:05] she receives it she never doubts it
[2:11:09] therefore nothing can harm her not
[2:11:12] even death for if the seed be planted
[2:11:16] the water will raise it up again here is
[2:11:19] the secret of this
[2:11:20] the word is in the bride as
[2:11:24] it was in mary the bride
[2:11:27] has the mind of christ for she
[2:11:30] knows what he wants done with the word
[2:11:34] you know something now this is not a
[2:11:37] good
[2:11:38] a real good analogy because i can try
[2:11:43] to express myself my thoughts
[2:11:47] in words and i sometimes can't find the
[2:11:51] words
[2:11:53] to express what's in my mind now that's
[2:11:56] not so with god
[2:11:59] but even his word is misunderstood
[2:12:03] by those who don't have his mind
[2:12:09] so for the prophet to have said she has
[2:12:11] the word of god
[2:12:13] would have been one thing but he didn't
[2:12:15] say she has
[2:12:16] the word of god he says she the bride
[2:12:20] has the mind of christ
[2:12:24] for she knows what he wants
[2:12:27] done with the word
[2:12:31] to have the word of god without the mind
[2:12:34] of god
[2:12:35] you can still go astray you can still
[2:12:38] misapply it
[2:12:39] you can still misinterpret it but with
[2:12:42] the mind of god
[2:12:43] present to reveal to you
[2:12:46] how amen to handle and what he wants
[2:12:50] done
[2:12:50] with his word oh my friends it brings us
[2:12:54] into the same
[2:12:55] qualities the same power the same
[2:12:58] life of god himself god has no
[2:13:02] greater amen no greater
[2:13:05] method or means of expressing himself
[2:13:07] than the spoken word
[2:13:09] the spoken word is what brought order to
[2:13:11] the creation is what brought life forth
[2:13:13] the spoken word is what brought lazarus
[2:13:15] from the tomb amen
[2:13:17] oh my the spoken word is is is the very
[2:13:19] expression of
[2:13:21] eternal life itself and the bride
[2:13:24] has that amen she performs
[2:13:27] the command of the word in his name for
[2:13:30] she has
[2:13:31] thus saith the lord you actually become
[2:13:34] the voice of the word because you're
[2:13:37] giving expression
[2:13:38] to the life of the word in action
[2:13:42] oh my she performs the command of the
[2:13:44] word in his name
[2:13:45] for she has thus saith the lord then the
[2:13:48] word is quickened by the spirit
[2:13:51] and it comes to pass like a seed that is
[2:13:53] planted in water
[2:13:55] it comes to full harvest serving
[2:13:58] its purpose those in the bride do
[2:14:01] only his will no one can
[2:14:04] make them do otherwise they have thus
[2:14:08] saith the lord or they keep still they
[2:14:10] know that it has to be god in them
[2:14:13] doing the works fulfilling his own
[2:14:16] word he did not complete
[2:14:20] all his work while in his earthly
[2:14:23] ministry
[2:14:24] so now he works in and
[2:14:28] through the bride she knows that for it
[2:14:31] was not yet time to do certain things
[2:14:33] that he must now do but he will now
[2:14:37] fulfill
[2:14:37] through the bride that work which he
[2:14:41] left
[2:14:41] for this specific time you believe that
[2:14:45] this morning
[2:14:46] you know my prayer is lord send the holy
[2:14:50] spirit
[2:14:52] to fill my heart and to fill my life
[2:14:55] the same way you did peter and the same
[2:14:58] way you did those
[2:14:59] 120 in the upper room so that i can go
[2:15:02] forth from this service
[2:15:04] from this place and that word can so
[2:15:08] live itself through me that i can
[2:15:11] identify
[2:15:12] the actions of my life and the conduct
[2:15:14] of my life
[2:15:15] as being the fulfillment of this word
[2:15:19] and there will be nothing you will have
[2:15:21] to back away from
[2:15:22] there will be no no challenge there will
[2:15:25] be no tests there will be no
[2:15:26] obstacle there will be no hurdle that
[2:15:28] you face that the word cannot overcome
[2:15:32] and it will prevail through its power in
[2:15:34] our lives amen
[2:15:36] i believe this morning we are the chosen
[2:15:38] people
[2:15:39] and we are living in the appointed time
[2:15:42] we have a prophetic message amen
[2:15:45] and i believe the rapture amen is
[2:15:48] already working in our very mortal
[2:15:51] beings amen
[2:15:52] our lives are being transformed by the
[2:15:54] power of this word
[2:15:55] and it's going to take us from this
[2:15:57] earth we have no need to fear
[2:16:00] we have no need to worry rest in your
[2:16:03] identity
[2:16:04] as sons and daughters of god you love

[2:20:37] within me
[2:20:42] as they continue to play that softly how
[2:20:44] many times has
[2:20:46] has your spirit changed hasn't gotten a
[2:20:49] little hard come it'll rough
[2:20:51] a little bit but quickly as you can just
[2:20:54] say restore lord
[2:20:56] a right spirit within me change my
[2:20:58] attitude change
[2:21:00] let me go back to see what your word
[2:21:01] says because we we get sidetracked
[2:21:05] we get we get pulled this way sometimes
[2:21:08] we make a mistake we fail
[2:21:11] and we get down on ourselves you know
[2:21:13] and
[2:21:14] to think about that that
[2:21:18] i i never looked at it that way that he
[2:21:21] was
[2:21:22] was set aside from adam taken down over
[2:21:25] here on the side
[2:21:28] maybe the lord brought her back through
[2:21:30] the whole garden
[2:21:32] and she saw the animals and she saw the
[2:21:34] birds and she saw the beauty of it
[2:21:37] and it had to be something to her to see
[2:21:39] it actually is
[2:21:40] to actually see wow look at that
[2:21:43] the amazing of it all and she's going
[2:21:46] but god had a purpose where he was
[2:21:48] taking her and where he was going to
[2:21:50] take her to
[2:21:52] adam probably didn't really realize what
[2:21:54] happened yet
[2:21:56] but maybe adam said something's missing
[2:22:00] but there was going to come that that
[2:22:02] that meeting place that place were gone
[2:22:04] and he would look upon her and she would
[2:22:06] look about him
[2:22:07] and realize they were one they were part
[2:22:10] of each other
[2:22:11] now your life has gone through a journey
[2:22:14] for some of you your journey has been
[2:22:16] much longer than others
[2:22:18] some have just started and god has
[2:22:21] allowed you to go through that journey
[2:22:23] to come to the place the difference was
[2:22:27] he knows
[2:22:28] and he's waiting there for you he knows
[2:22:31] who you are he's just waiting for you to
[2:22:33] come to that realization
[2:22:35] hey that's me when that little boy
[2:22:39] looked in the mirror and said hey
[2:22:41] that's me that's part of who i am
[2:22:44] to think when you're restoring something
[2:22:47] you have to start with the original
[2:22:49] product
[2:22:50] i've said it this way and you could tell
[2:22:54] i'm just a little bit older than brother
[2:22:56] tim here because he went to a 1974 then
[2:22:59] i go to a 1957
[2:23:01] chevy so just a little bit of difference
[2:23:03] in age
[2:23:04] there but if i'm going to restore a 1957
[2:23:07] chevy i can't start with a 1957
[2:23:10] ford i've got to start with the original
[2:23:13] product
[2:23:15] god didn't take you from something you
[2:23:17] weren't to something you are
[2:23:19] he's brought you from where you were for
[2:23:20] you to realize who you are
[2:23:23] and coming to the fulfillment of that
[2:23:25] and that should give you hope
[2:23:27] that should encourage your heart and say
[2:23:29] yes that's me
[2:23:31] that's the response that's what i have
[2:23:34] and i appreciate to hear the word of god
[2:23:36] again today to tell me
[2:23:38] that's who i am amen i received a text
[2:23:42] and i should have shared it of a
[2:23:45] testimony
[2:23:46] because jesus christ is the same
[2:23:48] yesterday today and forever
[2:23:50] about a month ago my sister-in-law
[2:23:53] elizabeth
[2:23:54] prayed about the vertigo and the ringing
[2:23:56] in the ears
[2:23:57] about a month ago and since then she has
[2:24:00] not had it
[2:24:01] we prayed he's jesus christ the same
[2:24:03] yesterday
[2:24:04] today and forever amen
[2:24:08] whatever it is whatever it is and to
[2:24:11] look upon the life of peter
[2:24:14] and some of us can identify ourselves
[2:24:16] with peter
[2:24:18] real easy man i failed there boy i was
[2:24:21] wrong
[2:24:22] boy i spoke out of turn boy i tried to
[2:24:25] stop what god was doing because i
[2:24:26] thought i had it right
[2:24:29] we've all been there but remember he
[2:24:32] said
[2:24:32] after that resurrection morning he says
[2:24:34] tell my disciples
[2:24:36] that all meet them over here and peter
[2:24:40] too that's right some of you were
[2:24:42] looking i never thought i would hear
[2:24:44] that
[2:24:45] but hey i'm so glad i'm a part of the
[2:24:48] family of god amen
