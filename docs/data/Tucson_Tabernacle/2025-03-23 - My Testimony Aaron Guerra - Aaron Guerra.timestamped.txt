[34:24] to know what's below the surface of
[34:28] brother Aaron and as I got to know
[34:31] him what you see on the surface with
[34:35] brother Aaron goes all the way to the
[34:37] bone that is him he is a just a
[34:41] genuinely good

[41:56] Lord and if we would sit down and and
[41:59] just think about it sometimes Lord all
[42:00] we could do is thank you and Praise You
[42:03] Lord even the hard times even the rough
[42:06] times there was a reason for them
[42:08] Lord you were wounded for our
[42:11] transgressions you were bruised for our
[42:14] iniquities the chastisement for our
[42:17] peace was laid upon you and by your
[42:19] stripes we were healed Lord so when I
[42:22] ask you Lord do you understand you
[42:25] understand Lord and we just want to love
[42:26] you for that today in Jesus Christ's
[42:29] name amen you may be
[42:34] seated I
[42:37] uh got to thinking
[42:40] about my life and the goodness of
[42:44] God I was one to be privileged to raised
[42:47] in a Christian
[42:49] home and it is a
[42:52] privilege it doesn't make us any better
[42:54] than anybody
[42:55] else we still need needed God to save us
[42:59] we still needed him to become real to us
[43:02] but we didn't suffer some of the things
[43:04] that others had
[43:06] suffered and you know it's
[43:09] it's there were those in the
[43:12] Bible like Samuel who was raised as a
[43:15] child in
[43:17] church and there were those like Peter
[43:20] who ran from the very one he promised
[43:23] that he would never turn his back on but
[43:26] God still loved him both
[43:28] so so I just like to share this and I'll
[43:31] try to keep it
[43:33] under how long
[43:37] honey okay you don't have to be
[43:39] embarrassed the rest of the
[43:45] night I've made many mistakes in my
[43:48] life the one decision I'll never regret
[43:52] is giving my life to
[43:55] Jesus I know
[43:58] there's no regret for
[44:00] that you know it's
[44:03] so I've shared this
[44:05] before our neighbor down the street they
[44:09] had a TV at home and we
[44:12] didn't and we wanted so much to go over
[44:16] the house and watch cartoons with them
[44:18] and they always wanted to be at our
[44:20] house and one day I convinced them we
[44:22] could go to their house we
[44:25] did and uh we're watching ing the
[44:27] cartoons and all of a sudden his little
[44:30] brother comes running out and says let's
[44:31] get out of here Mom and Dad are at it
[44:34] again and then we started hearing the
[44:36] fighting the banging and they were
[44:38] actually
[44:39] fighting and they ran out the door and
[44:42] we followed them we ran back to our
[44:44] house and these were his words to me he
[44:46] said that's why I'd rather be at your
[44:48] house this never happens at your house
[44:51] prise God that's a
[44:53] blessing you might not know it when
[44:56] you're growing up
[44:57] but when you look back you realize God
[44:59] has been so good so good to
[45:03] us Isaiah
[45:07] 2612 thou will ordain peace for us for
[45:11] thou has also wrought all our works in
[45:15] us it's not the goodness that we have
[45:18] it's not the goodness of what we done
[45:20] but it's Christ in us the hope of glory
[45:23] and then Jeremiah
[45:25] 29:11 he says for I know the thoughts
[45:29] that I think toward you saith the Lord
[45:31] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[45:35] give you an expected end you know I I've
[45:38] looked at that sometimes and I said Lord
[45:40] you know what you expected of us and
[45:42] where we would end even though we didn't
[45:44] and you gave it to us am nothing we
[45:48] deserved and then I was I was going
[45:51] through the message the unveiling of
[45:54] God and I just paragraphed
[45:57] 85 I don't know if they have it but it's
[46:01] like a man building Chimes or making
[46:04] Chimes the molder each Bell has got to
[46:07] ring different from the other the same
[46:10] materials but so much iron so much steel
[46:14] so much brass to make it give The
[46:17] Ting and I don't know if you can hear
[46:19] but I can hear the
[46:21] Ting but you have your Ting and I have
[46:24] my Ting and together we produce what God
[46:28] wanted to
[46:29] hear if we all sounded the same he would
[46:32] have just made robots that's good but he
[46:35] made you who you are he's brought you
[46:37] through what your life has been to
[46:39] produce and to bring forth what he wants
[46:42] to hear am
[46:45] so as I look at this and I just I don't
[46:48] know where I got this but it just spoke
[46:50] to me never be a prisoner of the things
[46:52] that happened in your
[46:54] past God wanted you to learn a
[46:58] lesson and not serve a life
[47:01] sentence we learned the lesson and
[47:04] sometimes some of us don't learn so
[47:06] quick might have to learn it a few times
[47:09] but when you learn the lesson you get to
[47:11] go on you know so I had the privilege
[47:15] again of being born and raised in a
[47:17] Christian
[47:18] home my mother and my father gave their
[47:21] their hearts to the Lord at a young when
[47:23] they were
[47:24] young mom was believe she told me she
[47:27] was about 17 16 16 years old when she
[47:31] gave her heart to the Lord and she
[47:33] received the Holy Ghost my father was
[47:36] 1617 also my dad gave a testimony on how
[47:40] he would come home and my grandmother
[47:43] would be sitting by the door with a
[47:44] Bible in her hand and tell him son don't
[47:48] do those things don't go and he said I
[47:51] gave my heart to the Lord but I went
[47:53] back he said I never went drinking
[47:54] nothing but I like to go to the dances
[47:57] he said and I was on my way to the dance
[47:59] when the hand of the Lord reached over
[48:00] and took me by the shoulder and for one
[48:03] year I was one sick young man until I
[48:07] repented and gave my heart back to him
[48:10] and he filled me with the Holy Ghost so
[48:13] we have a testimony we have a a part of
[48:15] my
[48:16] family my brothers and sisters of seeing
[48:19] having a Christian home and I thank God
[48:22] for that it's still troubl it's still
[48:26] hard because you have to know God for
[48:29] yourself but to have a good example
[48:31] before
[48:32] you Dad was born in in Los Angeles
[48:35] because grandma was pregnant with him
[48:37] and she went to visit family and she had
[48:40] him there but he was raised in Texas
[48:42] they were a Catholic Family and I asked
[48:45] my dad I said how did you come what we
[48:48] would call Christians or Pentecostal
[48:49] Christians my grandmother my dad's
[48:52] mother had breast cancer and she was
[48:55] Catholic and one of her one of the
[48:58] relatives I'm not sure who was an uncle
[48:59] had become a Christian Pentecostal
[49:02] Christian and she told her told my
[49:04] grandmother he said I'm going to take
[49:06] you to this church and they're going to
[49:08] pray for you and God is going to heal
[49:10] you but you have to promise to give your
[49:12] life to him so she took him to service
[49:15] they prayed for him and the cancer fell
[49:17] off her
[49:18] breast and she gave her heart to the
[49:20] Lord and the family Then
[49:23] followed so when we grew up we grew up
[49:26] in a Christian home and I they they the
[49:31] whole family ended up moving to
[49:32] California and that's where I was born
[49:34] Southern
[49:35] California uh in 1959 yes that's a long
[49:39] time
[49:40] ago but uh God has kept
[49:43] us you know and and so we were raised in
[49:46] a Pentecostal Church mom had had been
[49:50] they were from Central California up in
[49:52] the Fresno area and I asked her a little
[49:56] bit about her background and she said
[49:58] her dad my grandfather gave his heart to
[50:00] the Lord he was the first one in the 40s
[50:03] and then they followed along and all
[50:05] began to attend attend a Pentecostal
[50:08] Christian home or church I asked her her
[50:11] about receiving the Holy Spirit now
[50:13] she's listening I know but I remember
[50:16] she told us many times that when she had
[50:19] received the Holy Spirit she was
[50:20] enveloped in just a ball of
[50:23] fire when God and if you look back in
[50:26] the history of the Pentecost Pentecost
[50:29] there were amazing things that happened
[50:30] then my dad would tell me about one of
[50:33] the one of the ministers that he was
[50:35] brought up under they would have prayer
[50:38] meetings and they'd call the fire
[50:40] department because the church was on
[50:42] fire and then the fire department would
[50:44] get there and the church wasn't on fire
[50:46] it was a pillar of fire going up and
[50:47] down the
[50:48] church because he's still God he never
[50:51] changes and that's one thing my dad
[50:54] taught us Jesus Christ is the same
[50:56] yesterday today and forever Lessons
[50:59] Learned my older brother he he he kind
[51:03] of went a little
[51:05] sideways and uh one thing we learned
[51:07] that if my dad prayed things
[51:10] happened and I'm glad they did but at
[51:13] the same time sometimes it it made you a
[51:15] little nervous and a little afraid daddy
[51:17] don't pray like that for me but my
[51:20] brother got a got off a little bit off
[51:22] to the side and my dad prayed Lord break
[51:25] his arm
[51:27] if you have to get his attention and we
[51:29] heard about it me and my younger brother
[51:31] and my brother came home from work with
[51:33] a broken
[51:34] arm show me and my younger brother
[51:36] learned our
[51:39] lesson you know it just listen to what
[51:43] Dad tells you be respectful be
[51:46] honest one of the things that in the
[51:48] church that we we grew a Pentecostal
[51:50] Church they believe that speaking in
[51:52] tongues was the evidence of the Holy
[51:54] Ghost so that was what they everybody
[51:57] strived for was to speak in
[52:00] tongues
[52:02] and they the way they brought it they
[52:05] brought it in a way that you were going
[52:06] to hell if you didn't speak in
[52:08] tongues so they were try to scare you
[52:11] into try to drive you into it they would
[52:13] bring ministers that were well known for
[52:16] getting people to speak in
[52:18] tongues and we were raised that way we
[52:21] thought it was right but I remember as a
[52:24] young man young boy maybe
[52:27] between 10 and 12 years old wondering
[52:30] about these young men the young people
[52:32] there that were speaking in tongues but
[52:33] were living a totally different
[52:36] Life Church would start all the young
[52:39] people sat up in the front two rows that
[52:42] that's just the way it was and as soon
[52:43] as the music started all of them were
[52:45] dancing shouting praising God the music
[52:48] stopped they sat
[52:49] down when the music Started they got up
[52:52] and J Jump and shouted and I wondered is
[52:55] it just a button you push
[52:59] is that what it is and then as I began
[53:00] to grow and began to be around them I
[53:03] said that's not a life a Christian
[53:05] should be
[53:07] living now you ask me did I understand
[53:09] no I
[53:12] wondered so that that's how we were
[53:14] raised we were raised to love the Lord
[53:18] we were raised to go to church we are
[53:20] raised to read our
[53:22] Bibles and and I appreciate the fact
[53:26] that my grandmother my grandfather my
[53:28] parents my they were all Christians they
[53:30] lived a life so it was a good testimony
[53:34] around
[53:35] us but I was troubled for a long time
[53:37] because I did not speak in
[53:40] tongues because that was the Holy
[53:44] Ghost and then got into junior high and
[53:48] we went to a little bit of High School
[53:49] in California before we moved
[53:51] here and
[53:54] um my mom
[53:57] I uh she was just and she still is just
[54:00] a wonderful mother a good
[54:03] Christian uh she stayed home she raised
[54:05] us my dad worked in construction run a
[54:08] construction company my dad was a little
[54:09] more
[54:10] rough so Mom had the go Holy Ghost and
[54:14] so did Dad but I would go to mom because
[54:16] she was easier to work
[54:18] with I'm just just going to be honest
[54:21] with
[54:22] you and if I would come home and Mom
[54:25] wasn't home
[54:27] home I had to find her to make sure the
[54:30] Rapture hadn't taken
[54:33] place never did that with my
[54:37] dad but with my mother I would call
[54:40] everybody where is
[54:43] Mom that's the life my mom my dad we saw
[54:46] the Rough Side of him running he he was
[54:48] not a mean man but he was rough okay
[54:51] it's just being a young
[54:53] boy but I always question God if you're
[54:56] real where are you I always wondered so
[55:00] we were raised in a Pentecostal church
[55:03] and uh good influences kept us away from
[55:06] things we we never drank in my life
[55:09] never smoked in my life never did
[55:12] drugs I never kissed a girl until I
[55:14] married my wife and we I kissed her at
[55:17] the altar God now the funny story was
[55:20] that we were sharing that testimony with
[55:22] our neighbor when we were testifying to
[55:24] him and I told him the first time I
[55:25] kissed a girl was my my wife in
[55:30] church and he goes of all the places to
[55:33] kiss a girl you kissed your wife in
[55:37] church and then I explained to him after
[55:39] we were married at the altar and they
[55:42] laugh that was so strange to them to us
[55:46] it was a way of a Christian
[55:48] LIF you but the honest truth is you can
[55:52] live like a Christian but until you have
[55:54] an experience with God
[55:56] that's all you're doing is living like a
[55:59] Christian and so we were raised that way
[56:04] it doesn't make me a better person it's
[56:06] just how God allowed us to
[56:10] be Mom and Dad both gave their lives as
[56:14] as young people they were married in
[56:18] 1955 and they stayed together till dad
[56:23] passed away they were just a couple M
[56:25] months short of 70 years
[56:28] married and I never saw
[56:31] them thank
[56:33] you I never saw them I never saw my mom
[56:37] disrespect my father and my dad did what
[56:40] he could for my mother my mother lost
[56:42] her eyesight and we got here from uh
[56:46] California she had a a disease that's
[56:49] very rare and I've never found something
[56:52] to help
[56:53] her but if you saw my mom she has her
[56:56] glasses on and people would wonder why
[56:58] we walk her in she's blind but she
[57:01] doesn't want to act like it she says
[57:04] no and I know that God is going to touch
[57:07] her if not in this life and the other
[57:09] life and then she's going to look at me
[57:12] and she's going to say
[57:13] Maya you don't you don't look like I
[57:16] remember
[57:17] you but she loved us she cared for
[57:21] us when the message we first heard the
[57:24] message we're still in California my dad
[57:27] was questioning the Pentecostal
[57:31] beliefs we had gone to a concert of all
[57:35] the all the choirs in that area they did
[57:38] it on outside and I was 13 14 years old
[57:43] and every choir came up and sang a song
[57:46] or two and I said to myself this is
[57:49] nothing but a competition who's
[57:51] better and I'm just going to be honest
[57:53] with you Mo mostly it was Hispanic his
[57:55] Spanish speaking churches but one of the
[57:58] the ministers invited a black choir from
[58:01] Los Angeles now if I was going to rate
[58:03] the best one nobody else was close to
[58:06] that black
[58:07] choir they were
[58:09] good so the next that was on a Saturday
[58:12] evening we go to church on Sunday
[58:14] morning we went to church Sunday morning
[58:17] Sunday evening and Wednesday and any
[58:19] special meetings we were raised that way
[58:22] and I don't regret it because you give a
[58:25] young man alone time you know he'll get
[58:27] into
[58:28] trouble but if you keep God before him
[58:33] and you reach your arm around them and
[58:35] you take them with you and you live a
[58:38] life of a Christian it'll have an effect
[58:40] on
[58:41] them
[58:42] so my uncle my dad's brother was a
[58:45] pastor and he began to talk about a what
[58:48] a wonderful celebration we
[58:53] had and if my dad felt a certain way or
[58:56] had the leading of the Lord he was not
[58:58] afraid to speak it till the day he
[59:00] passed
[59:01] away and he stood up and he said I will
[59:04] show you the vision that the lord gave
[59:05] me of what he saw he said to the Lord it
[59:09] looked like a bunch of people walking
[59:10] around in a sessle throwing it at each
[59:13] other how would you like to hear that
[59:16] right in the middle of a
[59:18] service but I knew that I had thought
[59:21] the same thing I said this is not
[59:24] worship to God this is performance
[59:27] I didn't know that God was working in my
[59:30] life I just wondered
[59:32] why so the message came our
[59:35] way my dad was still
[59:39] working and we began to con congregate
[59:42] with a brother who had pulled out of the
[59:44] Pentecostal church and he told my dad
[59:47] you can congregate with us but you can't
[59:49] say nothing about what you're
[59:51] believing so we started going over and
[59:53] congregating with them and then my dad
[59:56] dad began to tell him about it so he
[59:57] said told my dad you can preach it but
[59:59] you can't mention that man's name off
[1:00:00] the
[1:00:02] pulpit okay you know what don't let that
[1:00:04] stop you just keep being a Christian
[1:00:08] just keep telling them keep living a
[1:00:10] life and let go to work so that brother
[1:00:13] then took a trip this would have been in
[1:00:14] 75 out to Tucson and he visited the
[1:00:17] message churches and he came back he
[1:00:19] said that it's nothing but the truth
[1:00:21] let's let's believe it let's begin to
[1:00:23] preach it so we we that's where we first
[1:00:27] started believing the message listening
[1:00:29] to the tapes and doing that we didn't
[1:00:31] know everything we still
[1:00:34] don't but we knew we had found something
[1:00:36] that I said hey this comes down to the
[1:00:39] heart and this sounds
[1:00:41] real so we moved we moved to Tucson my
[1:00:46] mom's family had had actually received
[1:00:49] the message up in the Fresno area and
[1:00:51] they passed it on to us a lot of them
[1:00:53] were living in Tucson
[1:00:56] we came here we attended the Spanish
[1:00:58] Tabernacle IM Tabernacle in Manuel where
[1:01:01] brother Isaac Nora still the pastor and
[1:01:03] we began to attend church
[1:01:05] there and there's reasons
[1:01:08] why and you've heard it before I came in
[1:01:11] like we're coming in the service this
[1:01:12] way me and my two brothers came in and
[1:01:15] we walked this way and this young lady
[1:01:16] that my wife sitting here was walking
[1:01:18] that way and I happened to turn and look
[1:01:21] sideways and I looked and I
[1:01:23] said she walked a little bit like this
[1:01:27] and I said to
[1:01:29] myself I wonder if that girl knows if it
[1:01:32] rains she'll
[1:01:34] drown and then I asked her to marry me
[1:01:38] not that same day but down the
[1:01:41] road and I have been
[1:01:43] blessed we're going on 46 years married
[1:01:51] now what God puts together that no man
[1:01:55] put under that means you and her don't
[1:01:59] do that love one another stand for one
[1:02:03] another as much as you
[1:02:06] can so we we went to church there and we
[1:02:10] came to the Tabernacle for the meetings
[1:02:12] the first time we ever went to any
[1:02:14] meetings with message meetings was in
[1:02:17] the summer of 75 in Flagstaff and
[1:02:20] December of 75 here at the Tabernacle
[1:02:23] before we moved and we began to see what
[1:02:27] I said now these are
[1:02:30] Christians I found out that they were
[1:02:32] human
[1:02:34] too but I found a different Spirit
[1:02:36] amongst
[1:02:38] them that they love the
[1:02:41] Lord so we move
[1:02:44] here Dad is um we sold everything we had
[1:02:47] in California paid cash for everything
[1:02:50] due to Dad's injury and the union and
[1:02:54] all it took a couple years to resolve
[1:02:56] all of that so we went to work and went
[1:02:58] to school together so it was a quick
[1:03:03] growing
[1:03:04] up and um I thought of joining the
[1:03:08] military and I was kind of dissuaded not
[1:03:12] to do that so instead I got married and
[1:03:14] had
[1:03:15] children and I thank God for
[1:03:18] that it's it's been a I I have to say
[1:03:21] it's been a nothing but a blessing for
[1:03:24] me God gave me
[1:03:26] daughters he knows why I don't but he
[1:03:30] does so after the sixth one was born and
[1:03:33] Rachel was born here when we were
[1:03:35] attending the
[1:03:38] Tabernacle my wife told me if you want
[1:03:40] to have a boy you're going to have to
[1:03:42] have them
[1:03:43] yourself and I said I've seen what it
[1:03:46] takes to have children and no thank
[1:03:49] you but God gave me two good son-in-laws
[1:03:52] so and a and a a grandson
[1:03:56] and boy those those are the fun ones
[1:03:58] yeah but God has been good to us like I
[1:04:02] said we started in the message at the
[1:04:03] Spanish Church they're my brothers and
[1:04:06] they're my sisters amen I've asked this
[1:04:09] to the Lord over and over if on that day
[1:04:12] you ask me and I see this person whoever
[1:04:15] it is from wherever they are if it's
[1:04:18] okay if they come to
[1:04:20] Heaven don't ever let me even hesitate
[1:04:23] to think otherwise and say say Lord let
[1:04:26] them
[1:04:28] in because why am I any better that I
[1:04:32] could come in it's his Amazing Grace
[1:04:36] it's his Bloodshed for me it's his
[1:04:38] goodness for me right I want to be able
[1:04:41] to say let them in Lord let them in he
[1:04:44] went out Jesus went out looking
[1:04:47] everywhere for that one he says he goes
[1:04:51] she goes and she looks he goes and he
[1:04:53] looks when he gives his parables
[1:04:56] Heaven won't be heaven without them
[1:04:59] now I had a brother from the church over
[1:05:02] there who told me that if we didn't
[1:05:04] believe it a certain
[1:05:06] way we couldn't go to heaven so I felt
[1:05:10] the lord gave me an answer and I'll
[1:05:11] share it with you I said and he my uncle
[1:05:15] he was my uncle he's the one that got me
[1:05:17] working in the Cabinetry
[1:05:19] business and I said Uncle I said what of
[1:05:23] these people are there when you get to
[1:05:25] heaven what are you g to do and he looks
[1:05:27] at me kind of funny are you're going to
[1:05:29] go up to the Lord and say if those
[1:05:31] people are here I don't want to be
[1:05:33] here I said what choice do you have
[1:05:36] where do you if you're not going to be
[1:05:37] in heaven where are you going to
[1:05:39] be and he stops and he just looks at me
[1:05:41] for a moment and he goes I hadn't
[1:05:43] thought of that I said I know you
[1:05:45] haven't you're sending them to hell but
[1:05:48] you're giving yourself
[1:05:51] Heaven I said you better the only way
[1:05:53] you're going to make it is you better
[1:05:55] have your heart where all like Jesus
[1:05:57] said all I wish all that would come I've
[1:06:01] given my all for
[1:06:03] all and
[1:06:05] no I've you I've shared this one before
[1:06:09] young man gets up to to heaven and as
[1:06:12] they say Peter's at the door and Peter's
[1:06:15] showing him around and he comes to the
[1:06:16] corner over us side and there's the
[1:06:18] Baptist Church over here he opens the
[1:06:20] door he said these are the good Baptists
[1:06:22] that were saved they're having a
[1:06:23] wonderful Baptist service and these are
[1:06:26] the methodists and these are the
[1:06:27] Pentecostals and he goes sh come here
[1:06:30] and they peek open the door and he goes
[1:06:31] these are the message people but be
[1:06:33] quiet because they think they're the
[1:06:34] only ones
[1:06:37] here no we're all going to make it by
[1:06:40] the grace of
[1:06:41] God and I'm not here to choose who is
[1:06:44] and who isn't I just have to be sure I'm
[1:06:46] ready to
[1:06:47] go so we are raised a certain way you've
[1:06:51] heard What's Happening Now what's coming
[1:06:54] out out of there and
[1:06:57] any way that Satan could cause confusion
[1:07:00] distractions he'll do
[1:07:03] it but until that day they're my
[1:07:07] brothers they're my sisters and I love
[1:07:12] them you know
[1:07:14] so there was going back to a little bit
[1:07:17] this is one of the the things that
[1:07:19] really struck me where we're still part
[1:07:22] of the Pentecostal Church
[1:07:25] my father was asked to be a pastor of
[1:07:28] one of the churches but he told him I
[1:07:30] can't because I don't believe speaking
[1:07:32] in tongues is the evidence of the Holy
[1:07:34] Ghost they said well if you'll just not
[1:07:35] say nothing you can be the
[1:07:39] pastor so my dad's brother young brother
[1:07:43] was and he's the one that we just went
[1:07:44] to his funeral service back in
[1:07:47] December prayed because it was a lady
[1:07:49] that had walked off the streets and and
[1:07:51] they knew him they lived in that area
[1:07:54] and he he he said Lord if she speaks in
[1:07:58] tongues I'll know that speaking in
[1:08:00] tongues is the evidence of the Holy
[1:08:02] Ghost and she spoke in tongues so he
[1:08:05] said my brother is wrong and I'm right
[1:08:08] two weeks later she was back out in the
[1:08:10] world living the life of a prostitute
[1:08:12] that she
[1:08:14] was and my Dad tried to explain to my
[1:08:17] uncle is that all the power of the Holy
[1:08:19] Ghost could
[1:08:21] do and he shared that with us
[1:08:25] and so I began to look in my own
[1:08:28] life what is happening in my
[1:08:32] life not what's happening in yours
[1:08:34] what's happening in
[1:08:37] mine and that's where we need to be sure
[1:08:40] it's in
[1:08:41] ours you can only let the light shine in
[1:08:44] your life if the light is
[1:08:47] there so when we get here of course we
[1:08:50] come out of a Pentecostal background a
[1:08:52] lot of the Spanish people had come out
[1:08:54] there and and so you know family was
[1:08:57] there that's what we were part
[1:09:00] of but things went on things happened
[1:09:03] and just the details and and we felt
[1:09:05] that maybe it was time for us to
[1:09:07] move and we
[1:09:10] came made a decision as a family to come
[1:09:12] to the
[1:09:14] Tabernacle even though we had been told
[1:09:16] a lot of things about what happened here
[1:09:17] and that's okay wherever there's people
[1:09:20] there's things that
[1:09:22] happen and so we came in the church and
[1:09:25] and we walked in would always call the
[1:09:28] back but it's the
[1:09:29] front really because you walk in from
[1:09:31] that side is you walking from the front
[1:09:34] door well not this church but I came in
[1:09:38] and I'm looking around and I'm I'll just
[1:09:40] be honest I was judging the people how
[1:09:43] did they look how did they dress how
[1:09:45] were they
[1:09:46] acting and I found a sweet
[1:09:50] spirit and I said my that's a different
[1:09:53] spirit
[1:09:55] so we come we're here a short time the
[1:09:58] girls were all young Rachel my youngest
[1:10:01] was born right after that and after
[1:10:03] about being here about a month maybe two
[1:10:06] my father had been here for several
[1:10:08] years he had started doing some
[1:10:09] missionary work brother green asked
[1:10:12] myself and my wife to go sit with him in
[1:10:14] the office and we
[1:10:17] did and um he began to just talk with us
[1:10:22] and my wife shared something with him
[1:10:25] they used to call her little Tears like
[1:10:28] which means she cried all the time and
[1:10:31] they all say you're just a crybaby
[1:10:32] you're just a cry baby that's all and
[1:10:34] she would feel terrible so she shared
[1:10:37] that with brother green and brother
[1:10:38] green goes sister the reason you cry is
[1:10:40] You Can Be Touched by others Fe others
[1:10:43] feelings and it took that spirit and
[1:10:46] just turned it
[1:10:47] around and after that she could reach
[1:10:50] out to
[1:10:52] others sometimes it's us that needs a
[1:10:56] little bit of
[1:10:57] change and not everybody
[1:11:00] else so this is kind of where maybe I I
[1:11:04] began to be to do more things after we
[1:11:07] left the Spanish church we were ra
[1:11:08] raising our children we were quite busy
[1:11:11] um we we came we were here for a short
[1:11:14] time and those of you have been quite
[1:11:16] here some time remember brother Paul
[1:11:17] Nora he had the the musicians up here
[1:11:20] they fill this whole area to a three
[1:11:24] violin a saxophone some flutes there was
[1:11:26] there was quite a bit and brother Paul
[1:11:29] came up he says you play saxophone don't
[1:11:30] you and I said yeah he says why don't
[1:11:32] you come and join the musicians and I
[1:11:34] just want to show you
[1:11:36] that I never asked for any of this
[1:11:40] brother Paul came up and we became part
[1:11:42] of the music around 1990 91 we got here
[1:11:46] in ' 8891 or so there was a couple of
[1:11:48] things that went through
[1:11:50] was there were some people that were
[1:11:52] starting to say the message wasn't true
[1:11:54] and and a group group of people left
[1:11:56] another brother came through here and he
[1:11:58] took a group of people and brother Al
[1:12:01] Peterson brother arie's father grandpa
[1:12:04] to the the Petersons there and he asked
[1:12:09] myself and brother Jerry mcfaden to
[1:12:11] start helping just ushering and doing
[1:12:14] things like that so we
[1:12:17] did and brother Jerry had a young family
[1:12:21] I we had the young girls and brother
[1:12:22] Jerry went back a couple months later
[1:12:24] and asked him if he could come back and
[1:12:26] sit with his family help raise the kids
[1:12:30] and brother Al says you go sit down you
[1:12:31] go do that and I told Brother Al I heard
[1:12:34] it I was standing there and I said
[1:12:35] brother Al I have more children than he
[1:12:36] has let me go back and help and brother
[1:12:38] Al said no you stay back here with
[1:12:40] me and one of the greatest mentors that
[1:12:43] I have worked with was brother El
[1:12:46] Peterson a good spirit a good
[1:12:50] man and and he he showed me how to be
[1:12:54] around people
[1:12:56] I saw his human side too and he just
[1:12:59] said I'm sorry you you saw the human
[1:13:01] side of me and I said yeah and that
[1:13:03] makes me love you
[1:13:05] more because you're not trying to be
[1:13:07] something you're not you're being a
[1:13:10] Christian so so we began to work and
[1:13:15] eventually uh there where brother uh
[1:13:18] Lyle is sitting that's where I sat and I
[1:13:20] became a
[1:13:21] deacon and old brother Dan they didn't
[1:13:23] vote back then brother green just people
[1:13:26] did the job and people did it and I was
[1:13:29] standing there and brother green walks
[1:13:31] and he's standing by the door and I
[1:13:32] turned to him and I've been doing that
[1:13:34] work for some time and I looked at him
[1:13:35] and I said brother green I didn't put
[1:13:39] myself here I was asked to do this and
[1:13:41] he just looked at me he said brother
[1:13:42] brandom told me that the people that are
[1:13:44] going to do the work are just going to
[1:13:45] come and do it brother and you just stay
[1:13:49] there again we didn't we didn't look for
[1:13:53] it but my heart was was to
[1:13:56] serve my heart was to be part of
[1:13:58] whatever I could do
[1:14:01] and we didn't have any boys and God
[1:14:04] knows why I probably would have got too
[1:14:06] involved in baseball and football and
[1:14:09] everything else and I'm not saying it's
[1:14:11] wrong but I probably would have gotten
[1:14:14] involved but there were some young men
[1:14:16] that came to the church because Mom and
[1:14:18] Dad had separated and they started
[1:14:20] attending the church and I took those
[1:14:22] boys and I befriended them
[1:14:26] I'd take him shooting we'd go play ball
[1:14:29] I became a big brother to them it helped
[1:14:32] me and it helped
[1:14:34] them
[1:14:35] and some of you may know
[1:14:38] them Josh
[1:14:40] Hernandez Nathaniel Grant two that I
[1:14:44] that I took on and we spent a lot of
[1:14:46] time together we did a lot of things I
[1:14:49] played football once with brother Lyall
[1:14:51] Johnson's
[1:14:52] voice that was a mistake
[1:14:57] one of the boys not his sons but one of
[1:14:59] the other boys was going into the
[1:15:00] military and they had something for him
[1:15:02] so we played football and they had
[1:15:03] played for
[1:15:04] Sabino and I could hardly walk after the
[1:15:07] game but I got I got to be around some
[1:15:09] of the young men out here after church
[1:15:13] have been here a long time ago there
[1:15:14] would always be the young people playing
[1:15:16] ball and stuff like that so we got to do
[1:15:19] things like that with them and I always
[1:15:21] wondered did I do any good
[1:15:26] did I help them did I ra not raise them
[1:15:29] but did I
[1:15:31] give Nathaniel's mom sister
[1:15:34] Grant come came back a few years
[1:15:37] ago and she said this to my wife she
[1:15:39] said the Nathaniel had told her brother
[1:15:43] Aaron will never know what he did for
[1:15:47] me no I
[1:15:49] won't but just that said Thank You
[1:15:53] Lord John is now an associate pastor of
[1:15:56] a church in
[1:15:59] um not
[1:16:01] Louisiana right around there somewhere
[1:16:03] and he calls me every once in a while
[1:16:05] just to tell me thank you for helping me
[1:16:08] out when I was a young man if you knew
[1:16:11] me way back then I wore a full
[1:16:13] mustache I shaved it off when this part
[1:16:16] started growing and it looked kind of
[1:16:18] funny so he used to call me
[1:16:21] panova so he still does he'll call me up
[1:16:23] he goes hey brother panova how are you
[1:16:26] doing God knows how and what you're
[1:16:30] capable of and what he wants you to do
[1:16:33] even though you might think you should
[1:16:35] be doing something
[1:16:36] else so that was part of my my growing
[1:16:41] up being being um part of the
[1:16:46] Tabernacle in I never asked for any of
[1:16:50] this and I still don't know why God
[1:16:52] allowed it to be but he wanted it
[1:16:55] some of the things that that happened we
[1:16:58] were out here after after service kind
[1:17:00] of like we do but all the kids would
[1:17:02] play basketball and everything and the
[1:17:04] little ones and the big ones and there'd
[1:17:06] be a full basketball game going and kids
[1:17:08] running between it and all and so you
[1:17:10] just kind of stand out there and watch
[1:17:11] for the ones that are going to get
[1:17:13] knocked over or
[1:17:15] what and there was the anthon family
[1:17:18] here and little Julia she was only about
[1:17:20] what four or five years old maybe she
[1:17:22] was just little
[1:17:25] and
[1:17:26] uh I was standing by the main main fence
[1:17:29] the one that the big one pulled
[1:17:31] open and um sister Carolyn miles comes
[1:17:35] running up to me holding Julia and Julia
[1:17:38] is kind of flopped over like this I I
[1:17:42] and her eyes completely rolled back in
[1:17:45] white she runs up to me and she says
[1:17:47] brother Aaron sister Julia little Julia
[1:17:51] and I look down and they're just
[1:17:53] white no sign of life I don't know I
[1:17:56] just reached my hands over at church and
[1:17:58] I said little Julia in the name of the
[1:17:59] Lord Jesus Christ I give you back your
[1:18:01] life she pops straight up and said put
[1:18:03] me down and ran
[1:18:05] off God
[1:18:08] now it
[1:18:10] happened it happened I know God answers
[1:18:13] prayer and let me tell you you don't
[1:18:15] have to be the perfect righteous man or
[1:18:17] righteous sister call on God and he will
[1:18:21] answer those are the things that God
[1:18:24] allowed in my
[1:18:26] life uh uh I I just I was trying to
[1:18:29] remember some more of them just things
[1:18:33] that God we we we were able to go with
[1:18:35] my dad down into
[1:18:37] Mexico we helped out down there I
[1:18:40] interpreted some Services we we a little
[1:18:43] bit here a little bit there a little bit
[1:18:46] here to
[1:18:48] learn I haven't learned it
[1:18:51] all I ask God to let me be still willing
[1:18:55] to
[1:18:56] learn not too old to
[1:18:59] learn but it's just how God began to
[1:19:04] bring me up to a
[1:19:06] place where he knew that he would have
[1:19:08] me help
[1:19:11] otherwise
[1:19:12] and in the
[1:19:15] military a
[1:19:18] good um what would you call it a a good
[1:19:21] Lieutenant someone that has been through
[1:19:24] the school to
[1:19:25] get that that um I'm trying to think of
[1:19:29] the word I was going to say degree not
[1:19:30] AE but get that position in the military
[1:19:33] an
[1:19:34] officer will take a a a sergeant that
[1:19:37] has been in the military and has learned
[1:19:40] and has good experience and he'll work
[1:19:42] with that sergeant and says you've been
[1:19:44] here and they'll work together even
[1:19:46] though he's a high ranked officer he'll
[1:19:49] lean on
[1:19:51] them and that's what we do with one
[1:19:53] another you've experienced things that I
[1:19:55] haven't I've experienced and we lean on
[1:19:57] one another and say I've been through
[1:19:59] that God is able to and that's how we
[1:20:02] help one
[1:20:04] another you know so we raised the girls
[1:20:08] here we were part of the church here we
[1:20:10] played the
[1:20:11] music and and uh whatever we could do
[1:20:15] help
[1:20:17] and one
[1:20:19] day I was some of us take a long time to
[1:20:23] learn some of you learn quickly
[1:20:25] I was almost 50 years
[1:20:27] old brother green came up to me at the
[1:20:29] door there and he goes could have talked
[1:20:30] to you for a little while and we went
[1:20:32] over to his
[1:20:33] office and he said do you feel like you
[1:20:36] could be an associate Minister for the
[1:20:41] Tabernacle
[1:20:43] well I said if I could help I would but
[1:20:46] I don't know if I'm
[1:20:48] called I've never had any that came from
[1:20:50] Heaven said you're called to be you know
[1:20:52] kind of how you want it a big
[1:20:56] sign somebody to speak in tongues
[1:20:58] somebody to interpret for
[1:21:00] you that's it's easier that way than
[1:21:04] taking God by faith and standing on his
[1:21:07] word and he said I've I've watched you
[1:21:11] I've listened to you I've we've had you
[1:21:14] help us out and I would like you to be
[1:21:16] part of the ministry
[1:21:19] here I still scratch my head sometimes
[1:21:22] and wonder how did all this come to pass
[1:21:27] I don't have a degree and I know you
[1:21:29] don't need
[1:21:31] it I don't have the education I know you
[1:21:33] don't need it but it sure would help in
[1:21:36] some
[1:21:37] places you know and he asked me to
[1:21:41] become part of the ministry
[1:21:43] here and you know I accepted
[1:21:46] it having no idea that at one time at
[1:21:50] coming up in the future what was going
[1:21:52] to take place brother green was going to
[1:21:55] be around for another 50 years or so you
[1:21:57] know just kind of looked at it that
[1:21:59] way so we began to work that
[1:22:03] way uh brother Nathaniel
[1:22:07] Johnson brother Vern Harris brothers
[1:22:10] that took me under their
[1:22:12] wing brother Nathaniel took me out to
[1:22:15] meet folks to pray with him you know go
[1:22:17] out and encourage them brother Harris
[1:22:20] after brother El Peterson went up with
[1:22:23] his son-in-law brother Mark brother inh
[1:22:24] hared back there and they mentored me
[1:22:28] they they were they were just sharing
[1:22:30] their
[1:22:31] experiences uh how to deal with people
[1:22:34] how to work with
[1:22:36] people till the day came that we thought
[1:22:39] would never
[1:22:40] happen and that was brother green
[1:22:42] passing
[1:22:43] away we we knew it was going to happen
[1:22:46] but you just didn't think it was going
[1:22:47] to
[1:22:49] happen remember the morning when the
[1:22:52] news came out that brother green had
[1:22:53] passed away
[1:22:57] but what brother Dan didn't know then
[1:22:59] nor any of us that God was working on
[1:23:02] that end
[1:23:03] already because God doesn't get
[1:23:06] surprised by
[1:23:08] anything now he's like oh man I got to
[1:23:11] run back and I got to fix this now he
[1:23:14] didn't go with Jonah in a whale what do
[1:23:16] I do now no he knew exactly what was
[1:23:18] happening amen now you may have messed
[1:23:22] up he knew you were going to messed up
[1:23:23] you're going to learn your lesson
[1:23:25] Len as a child you're raising your old
[1:23:28] children raised six
[1:23:31] daughters and and you know the oldest
[1:23:35] one got treated one
[1:23:36] way the youngest one got treated a
[1:23:39] little different the oldest one thinks
[1:23:41] the youngest one got away with
[1:23:45] everything yeah Naomi or no she raised
[1:23:48] her hand but you know but you learned
[1:23:51] your
[1:23:52] lessons you know now now that they're
[1:23:55] all I can't say older um they have all
[1:23:58] grown up they get along well they
[1:24:03] encourage one another they stand with
[1:24:05] one another they help one
[1:24:07] another but it's a processing growing
[1:24:10] it's a process in
[1:24:11] learning so we we began to do that we
[1:24:14] began to you know learning that and
[1:24:17] brother green passing
[1:24:19] away and this is a part that
[1:24:23] I I don't I
[1:24:25] just always wondered
[1:24:27] why and some of you know what happened
[1:24:31] some of you don't know and in the
[1:24:33] passing away of brother green and and
[1:24:35] all of
[1:24:36] that um we were going to lose the
[1:24:41] church the portion of the family and and
[1:24:44] it turned into to be quite a quite a
[1:24:45] quite a
[1:24:47] battle and if it wasn't for the Peterson
[1:24:50] family uh brother Dan has mentioned it
[1:24:53] they had come and changed out all the
[1:24:54] locks so we couldn't get in but they
[1:24:56] missed one and the Peterson family got
[1:24:58] and they came and unlocked all the
[1:25:01] doors and we began to work with
[1:25:06] that this is God's
[1:25:09] house it's not brother Dan's house it's
[1:25:12] not my house it's not your house this is
[1:25:14] God's
[1:25:16] house you understand you understand what
[1:25:18] I mean God calls and we come but this is
[1:25:21] God's house and we always remember that
[1:25:23] this is God's house
[1:25:24] we come to worship him we come to praise
[1:25:27] him we come to lift him up but the
[1:25:30] greatest evidence that you're worshiping
[1:25:32] God is known and how you're treating
[1:25:35] others because the greatest in all gave
[1:25:39] his life for
[1:25:40] you he was willing to take your place on
[1:25:43] the cross he was willing to be scorned
[1:25:47] and turned against and and and and run
[1:25:50] down in your
[1:25:52] place I was was praying here this
[1:25:55] happened twice and I've shared this
[1:25:56] before praying up here in the Altar and
[1:25:59] I ask the Lord and and don't be afraid
[1:26:01] to talk to
[1:26:02] God talk to him don't get on your knees
[1:26:05] and beg him talk with
[1:26:08] him one of the hard one of the things
[1:26:10] that I would trouble me was when the
[1:26:12] girls were coming dad will you please
[1:26:14] please please I would say no ask me what
[1:26:17] you want because every time you say
[1:26:19] please I'm going closer to a no
[1:26:24] get on your knees and talk to him like
[1:26:26] he's your father and he cares for
[1:26:29] you he understands he knows but he wants
[1:26:33] to hear that from you father I trust you
[1:26:37] father I believe you I know that you're
[1:26:39] more than
[1:26:42] able and and and you're encouraging
[1:26:45] yourself I asked him if he understood
[1:26:50] the feeling of being abandoned separated
[1:26:53] that and the words just rung out of me
[1:26:56] did not I cry out my God my God why has
[1:26:58] Thou forsaken
[1:27:01] me well what are you going to say oh
[1:27:03] Lord I'm sorry you
[1:27:06] do when I had the foot surgery I asked
[1:27:10] him and I'll talk to my God that way I'm
[1:27:13] his
[1:27:15] son I I respect him and I R but I want
[1:27:18] to talk with him I want to fellowship
[1:27:20] with him and I asked him if he
[1:27:22] understood foot pain because I had the
[1:27:24] toe amputated from diabetes and
[1:27:27] all and right there at the same
[1:27:30] spot he said were that was that not my
[1:27:33] bloody Footprints going up to
[1:27:36] Calvary he says I understand I know I
[1:27:41] know what you're going
[1:27:43] through you
[1:27:45] know and when my wife was having the
[1:27:49] children uh I was in the room for all of
[1:27:53] them but she had
[1:27:55] them you know what I did I tried to
[1:27:58] encourage her I try to that's all I
[1:28:01] could do just be there sayia come on
[1:28:04] you've already had one you've had two
[1:28:05] you've had three you had four you've had
[1:28:07] five you've had six now
[1:28:09] H and we you know and he does the same
[1:28:12] thing I've been where you're at he says
[1:28:14] and he tries to encourage
[1:28:17] you we uh you can talk to God and he'll
[1:28:22] answer you
[1:28:24] if you're listening if you're willing
[1:28:27] to I shared this one we went El hunting
[1:28:32] six five six years ago up in the White
[1:28:35] Mountains
[1:28:37] my two of my supervisors we work
[1:28:40] together me and Tony work together from
[1:28:42] 84 and me and Jim from 95 we've known
[1:28:46] each other for many years working in the
[1:28:47] Cabinetry business and we were out
[1:28:48] hunting using Jim's
[1:28:50] cabin Jim killed his on Friday we packed
[1:28:53] it out and found out how how much fun
[1:28:54] that isn't climbing through the
[1:28:59] mountains so Saturday we we're
[1:29:04] hunting and you have to know how God
[1:29:07] talks to
[1:29:09] you because he doesn't talk to everybody
[1:29:12] the same way my six daughters on some of
[1:29:15] them I could just look at him and they
[1:29:16] would stop some of them I had to talk
[1:29:17] and someone had to talk to them a little
[1:29:19] harder but they all got the attention it
[1:29:21] was how how you deal with them okay
[1:29:24] okay and I heard that voice not a
[1:29:27] literal voice but the voice that speaks
[1:29:28] to me in my mind it says what are you
[1:29:31] here
[1:29:33] for and I said I answered it this way
[1:29:36] that was for brother
[1:29:40] brandom and a few minutes later he goes
[1:29:42] what are you here for and again I said
[1:29:46] that was for brother
[1:29:47] brandom Lord aren't you listening to
[1:29:51] me that's the action that we're taking
[1:29:54] Lord don't you
[1:29:55] understand and the third time he asked
[1:29:58] me what are you here for we're sitting
[1:30:01] on a ridge I'm looking up at the hill
[1:30:03] there's a game Trail coming down I said
[1:30:04] I want him to come down that game Trail
[1:30:06] come right down the middle here turn
[1:30:08] around and go out that
[1:30:10] way and I spoke it I sat
[1:30:13] there and I look up in the very top of
[1:30:15] the Grain Trail I can see two elk but I
[1:30:19] could not see the head just the belly I
[1:30:22] didn't know if they were Bulls or cows
[1:30:23] and we're bull
[1:30:25] hunting and my boss had killed his the
[1:30:28] day before so he's spotting for me and
[1:30:30] he goes don't shoot the first one shoot
[1:30:33] the second one I said I have a gut a
[1:30:35] heart shot of the first one but a gut
[1:30:36] shot I wait till they move the first one
[1:30:38] is a small bull the second one steps out
[1:30:42] 6
[1:30:43] by6 knocked him down right there 180
[1:30:46] yards and that other bull ran down came
[1:30:48] down came right in front of me turned
[1:30:50] around and ran back up exactly like I
[1:30:53] had asked
[1:30:56] that's just God telling me I'm aware of
[1:30:58] you I'm care for you that's not cuz I'm
[1:31:02] special that's cuz God
[1:31:05] cares now he blessed me beyond that we
[1:31:09] had
[1:31:10] backpacked U Jim's elk the day before
[1:31:14] and let the young guys do
[1:31:17] that it took us it wasn't a long look
[1:31:20] but it was 14° out and there was snow on
[1:31:22] the ground saw some Mountain Lion tracks
[1:31:26] I'm glad that's all we saw just the
[1:31:28] tracks they were pretty big and we get
[1:31:31] his out it was quite a
[1:31:33] job while we go and get mine Jim says
[1:31:36] I'm going to go get the packs and this
[1:31:38] guy drives up in a quad and stops right
[1:31:40] below us and we said how do you get in
[1:31:41] here and he said drive your truck around
[1:31:43] come this road parked the truck right
[1:31:45] under there we hiked him down 40 yards
[1:31:47] and put him in the back a truck and
[1:31:48] drove him out
[1:31:50] God hey thank you Lord
[1:31:55] amen God answers
[1:32:00] prayer I asked him do you know my
[1:32:03] name I'd got home I don't remember what
[1:32:06] happened but my wife just said go to the
[1:32:08] room I'll handle it I sat down I grabbed
[1:32:11] my Bible and I said Lord do you know my
[1:32:13] name and I opened the Bible and it FS on
[1:32:16] Psalms
[1:32:17] 115 verses 9 10 11 and 12 and it says oh
[1:32:20] House of Aaron I have blessed you and
[1:32:22] kept you it says it three times
[1:32:25] he didn't say I know you he said oh
[1:32:27] House of Aaron and I was just asking me
[1:32:30] if he knew where I lived and in my
[1:32:33] name yes he
[1:32:35] does and the blessing the greater
[1:32:38] blessing in that is my daughter
[1:32:39] Elizabeth I shared it with my girls she
[1:32:42] comes one day and she knocks on the door
[1:32:44] and she says Dad can I talk to you and
[1:32:46] she she I said come on in and she says
[1:32:49] you know how the Lord showed you your
[1:32:52] name in the Bible I asked asked him the
[1:32:54] other day can you show me my name do you
[1:32:56] know like you did for my father and she
[1:32:57] opens it into Luke and it says and her
[1:32:59] name was Elizabeth and she was of the
[1:33:01] House of
[1:33:03] Aaron it was already in the scripture
[1:33:05] you didn't have to add it it was there
[1:33:07] God is knows all things he's he's in
[1:33:10] control of it
[1:33:11] all but you know when I wake up tomorrow
[1:33:14] I may ask him again Lord are you aware
[1:33:16] of
[1:33:17] this he knows he understands those are
[1:33:20] things that God will do in your life if
[1:33:23] you let him do
[1:33:27] it when brother green passed
[1:33:30] away
[1:33:32] and kind of laugh about
[1:33:36] this
[1:33:38] but we got quite a few calls and self
[1:33:42] invites of ministers who said God called
[1:33:45] them to be our
[1:33:46] pastor and I thought well they serve a
[1:33:49] different God than I served them because
[1:33:51] my God's not confused as who should be
[1:33:52] the pastor
[1:33:54] because all tenim and the Lord told them
[1:33:55] that they should be the
[1:33:57] pastor and I wondered here in Tucson
[1:34:00] everybody knows Tucson Tabernacle but
[1:34:02] out in Mississippi and some there's
[1:34:04] churches that have been I heard from
[1:34:06] different ones we've been looking for
[1:34:08] the last 10 years to find of a person a
[1:34:10] pastor but nobody wants to come out this
[1:34:11] way nobody wants to do this little
[1:34:14] church and you know I said Lord you know
[1:34:18] who the pastor is to
[1:34:20] be and and he did because when we were
[1:34:24] in the meeting with the family the
[1:34:26] brother that we thought would take the
[1:34:27] pastorship said no and he said I'll have
[1:34:30] nothing to do with this I'll attend the
[1:34:31] Tabernacle but I won't he turned in all
[1:34:34] his keys and everything and then the
[1:34:36] family turned around and said who
[1:34:39] will then take the the
[1:34:43] responsibility and brother Jordan was
[1:34:45] there brother Arie was there brother
[1:34:49] Dale
[1:34:50] Knight and a couple other brothers were
[1:34:53] sitting there with the
[1:34:54] family right out
[1:34:57] here I believe that meeting was here and
[1:35:01] I said I will the words came out without
[1:35:04] me
[1:35:05] thinking but then after that I was why
[1:35:08] did I say
[1:35:09] that but God had a reason God had a
[1:35:13] reason somebody was going to to help to
[1:35:16] hold this place until God sent the man
[1:35:20] who he had already seen but he knew it
[1:35:21] was going to be about 10 years down the
[1:35:23] road
[1:35:24] you didn't know that and I didn't know
[1:35:26] that but God was working on that already
[1:35:29] he also know who would be here and who
[1:35:32] wouldn't and that's that's got and we
[1:35:35] can't get we we can't question him in
[1:35:37] the sense like why did you do that like
[1:35:40] you didn't ask
[1:35:42] me he says that's right because you
[1:35:44] would have just confused it
[1:35:47] more but the congregation voted me to be
[1:35:50] the the pastor for that first year
[1:35:54] and I I thank brother Al Peterson
[1:35:57] brother edgal brother
[1:35:59] Jordan and myself four brothers who kept
[1:36:04] the church together for a
[1:36:06] year and then the boat was taken again
[1:36:09] to continue to look for a pastor and I
[1:36:12] said I'll help you as long as I
[1:36:15] can we went through a couple of
[1:36:17] different Brothers a lot of you were
[1:36:18] here
[1:36:20] then but because of where brother
[1:36:22] Daniel's background had been been we
[1:36:24] would have never thought it would have
[1:36:25] come that way but I will say this sister
[1:36:29] Stephanie we met them when they were
[1:36:31] young they were still part of the church
[1:36:33] here but I will say this anytime he saw
[1:36:35] me or talked to me he treated me
[1:36:37] well I never got anything like oh you
[1:36:41] are not tapes only or you're not no he
[1:36:45] treated me like a
[1:36:46] brother he asked me
[1:36:49] today why I treated him that way and I'm
[1:36:51] say why not
[1:36:54] give me a reason not to treat you like a
[1:36:58] brother but that's no reason I should
[1:37:00] still treat you like a
[1:37:02] brother because I gave him every
[1:37:05] reason to not treat me like one of his
[1:37:08] own but he gave his life for
[1:37:11] me that's how much he
[1:37:14] cared now in that process we're going to
[1:37:17] getting to where brother diam becomes
[1:37:19] the
[1:37:20] pastor brother Lyall
[1:37:24] and he has become one of the finest men
[1:37:26] I've gotten to
[1:37:29] know I didn't really know of I knew of
[1:37:32] him but we really didn't know him before
[1:37:34] that time because they had moved
[1:37:36] away and I encouraged him when he
[1:37:40] started coming itd be willing to help us
[1:37:44] out
[1:37:46] and I'm amazed what he does and how he
[1:37:49] does
[1:37:50] it I didn't know all those things
[1:37:54] how he brings them out lays them out and
[1:37:55] everything it's
[1:37:57] amazing but God now I'm going to share
[1:38:00] this and I'm I'm not embarrassing you
[1:38:02] brother Lyall you know that I love
[1:38:04] brother ly sister Heather wonderful
[1:38:08] people when brother Lyall
[1:38:12] retired I knew I knew his family but
[1:38:14] really didn't know we knew who they were
[1:38:15] hardy hardy spend any time with them
[1:38:18] they had a retirement party and they had
[1:38:20] it at one of the boys houses
[1:38:23] and his boys and sister Heather came up
[1:38:26] to me and said this thank you for giving
[1:38:30] us our dad back to
[1:38:34] us and I scratched my head I never took
[1:38:36] him away from
[1:38:38] you I didn't know and and he told us
[1:38:40] later he had gotten so involved with
[1:38:42] work and everything was going
[1:38:44] on but inviting him to be it it he began
[1:38:48] to work here and the boy said you gave
[1:38:50] us our father back to us
[1:38:54] and getting to know brother Lyle I
[1:38:57] wouldn't mind at all being called one of
[1:38:59] his
[1:38:59] sons he'd have a difficult explanation
[1:39:02] if they saw me
[1:39:04] but he has turned out you're one of the
[1:39:07] finest Brothers I've gotten to know and
[1:39:09] I appreciate that I
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:15] do I don't know why God allowed it to be
[1:39:18] that way but God knew what he was
[1:39:20] doing to get to work with brother Arie
[1:39:23] now brother
[1:39:25] Jordan our new
[1:39:28] trustees these young
[1:39:30] people never thought I'd say those
[1:39:33] words but yeah it's been a
[1:39:38] blessing no I never spoke in
[1:39:41] tongues yeah over
[1:39:44] there but God has been in my
[1:39:47] life over and over and over he's shown
[1:39:50] me I still care for you I still watch
[1:39:53] for you you're mine you're my
[1:39:56] son it's not my
[1:39:58] ability I I graduated from high school
[1:40:01] with a good grade but I didn't take any
[1:40:03] hard classes either basic
[1:40:06] math I did English because hey I knew
[1:40:08] English I took Spanish because I knew
[1:40:11] Spanish guaranteed a you know but God
[1:40:15] knows how to bring someone up and what
[1:40:18] to
[1:40:19] do and my heart now is how can I help
[1:40:23] yes amen what can I do I wish I had the
[1:40:26] energy and the strength of a young
[1:40:29] man but most of the time you haven't had
[1:40:32] enough experience as a young man to when
[1:40:35] you finally learn it you don't have the
[1:40:36] energy to do
[1:40:39] it we uh one of the things that I did is
[1:40:42] I when I was called up to minister and
[1:40:44] we would do I would going a minister on
[1:40:47] Sunday I would take Saturday evening and
[1:40:49] I'd go for a long walk turn everything
[1:40:51] else off and not be dist distracted by
[1:40:54] anything walked down it's about a
[1:40:56] quarter of a mile walk from my house to
[1:40:59] the out of our street and then turn East
[1:41:03] and when I would get East I would shut
[1:41:05] everything else out and when everything
[1:41:07] else should shut out I could hear God
[1:41:09] speak to
[1:41:11] me not in an audible voice but he would
[1:41:14] begin to bring things in he would begin
[1:41:17] to show
[1:41:18] things that at home I was too busy at
[1:41:21] work I was too busy there was too many
[1:41:22] other dist
[1:41:24] distractions get some quiet time with
[1:41:26] the
[1:41:27] Lord Brother Dan goes up to a place
[1:41:31] wherever it is and get some quiet time
[1:41:33] away from it and you just start turning
[1:41:36] everything else
[1:41:37] off you can live without a
[1:41:40] tv nobody has died because of lack of
[1:41:45] TV right brother Dan there's nothing in
[1:41:47] in in the hospital where you're being
[1:41:49] trained about how to deal with that is
[1:41:50] there
[1:41:51] no nobody's died that way way they've
[1:41:54] died from the lack of
[1:41:57] God I don't have I Love You Lord but I
[1:41:59] just don't have a time for you now so
[1:42:02] last night I went out and took a walk I
[1:42:04] hadn't done that for a while I had
[1:42:05] injured my knee and walking hasn't been
[1:42:08] the easiest but I went out and I walked
[1:42:12] about two miles in the quiet and I told
[1:42:15] my wife when I got home I got to start
[1:42:16] doing this more again CU I left just
[1:42:20] left everything at home and just said
[1:42:22] Lord I'm here for you make some quiet
[1:42:25] time for
[1:42:26] him however it is you can he'll talk to
[1:42:30] you he'll speak to you four times and
[1:42:33] I've shared this I'm going to finish
[1:42:34] with
[1:42:35] this four times God has spoken to me
[1:42:38] audibly in my life first time when I was
[1:42:41] about 16 years old I had my eyes on a
[1:42:44] man my eyes were on him if he said amen
[1:42:47] I said amen I was sitting about where
[1:42:49] sister Martha sister Lily sitting right
[1:42:51] about there and he was sitting where
[1:42:54] about Sister Crystal is right there and
[1:42:56] I could see him and if he said amen in
[1:42:57] the church service I said amen in the
[1:43:00] service if he shook his head I shook my
[1:43:02] head if he didn't do nothing I didn't do
[1:43:06] nothing and I had a voice speak to me so
[1:43:09] it would be on my left ear by the aisle
[1:43:12] there and it said loudly is that man
[1:43:15] your Holy Ghost and I turned to look and
[1:43:18] nobody was standing
[1:43:21] there I didn't didn't get it at first I
[1:43:25] just wondered but then I realized I was
[1:43:27] just following what he was
[1:43:29] doing the next time God spoke to
[1:43:33] me in an audible voice I I I asked
[1:43:40] him and again let me say you can talk to
[1:43:43] him he'll talk back to you he'll answer
[1:43:46] you in a way you'll
[1:43:49] understand and I asked him verbally
[1:43:55] I asked him there the the two times I
[1:43:57] asked him when I was here he just gave
[1:43:59] me the
[1:44:01] thoughts I said Lord what does a pastor
[1:44:04] need to understand that was at the time
[1:44:06] that we were looking for a pastor and
[1:44:08] this one said Lord call me and this one
[1:44:10] said the Lord call me and he said with a
[1:44:13] voice a loud voice made the van that I
[1:44:16] was driving just go like this he said
[1:44:19] the Pastor needs to understand that the
[1:44:21] Sheep are mine they're not his
[1:44:25] you're
[1:44:28] Gods brother Dan was put here to care
[1:44:31] for God's
[1:44:33] sheep we love that we respect that but
[1:44:36] you're Gods
[1:44:42] yes that one has kept me in L these are
[1:44:46] God's people these are God's sheep I
[1:44:49] need to treat them that
[1:44:51] way you need to treat one another that
[1:44:55] way when we were looking at one of the
[1:44:59] brothers that
[1:45:00] was being considered to be the pastor
[1:45:04] and the musicians could make their way
[1:45:05] up now it's about done
[1:45:08] here the Lord spoke to me and said
[1:45:11] something to me
[1:45:12] audibly I'm not going to say what it was
[1:45:15] but it was just for us brothers who
[1:45:18] were looking to see and exactly what the
[1:45:22] Lord said came to
[1:45:25] pass if you'll listen he'll speak if
[1:45:28] you'll make yourself available he'll
[1:45:30] speak get to know that in your life how
[1:45:33] he deals with you and how he speaks with
[1:45:36] you just like a husband in wife honey is
[1:45:41] everything okay and she says yes but
[1:45:43] she's got a different look so then you
[1:45:45] go what's going on or she'll ask me is
[1:45:49] everything all right say yes and she
[1:45:50] goes okay tell me what happened today
[1:45:51] where
[1:45:53] that's the way the Lord would Sayes Lord
[1:45:55] everything is fine but he says okay talk
[1:45:56] with me tell me what you're going
[1:45:58] through tell me the battle you're
[1:46:00] battling with he knows but he wants you
[1:46:02] to share it with him and he'll answer
[1:46:05] you amen if you'll sing that again song
[1:46:09] I have been
[1:46:12] blessed I thought about singing it then
[1:46:14] I thought get brother Mike to do
[1:46:18] it let's do that fifth verse
[1:46:23] father the verse of mother and
[1:46:36] father a mother and
[1:46:40] father nurtured and

[1:48:53] so I just thank him for being so kind oh
[1:49:00] God has been
[1:49:02] good
[1:49:04] so
[1:49:06] good I have been blessed I don't believe
[1:49:10] it was a coincidence that I preached
[1:49:13] this
[1:49:14] morning on the parable of the laborers
[1:49:18] in the
[1:49:19] vineyard and how there was the laborers
[1:49:22] that went out at 6:00 in the
[1:49:25] morning and they worked all
[1:49:27] day they labored
[1:49:29] and after the third hour more came and
[1:49:33] after the sixth hour more came the ninth
[1:49:36] hour more came and then the 11th Hour
[1:49:39] even more came but there were those that
[1:49:44] labored all
[1:49:45] day sure their hands were
[1:49:48] worn their bodies were tired and beat
[1:49:51] down
[1:49:54] and I believe that on that glorious day
[1:50:00] when we go to meet the
[1:50:01] Lord and he says enter in thou good and
[1:50:05] faithful
[1:50:06] servant there will
[1:50:08] be men like Aaron
[1:50:11] Gara battle scarred veterans who didn't
[1:50:14] come in at the 11th
[1:50:16] Hour battle scarred veterans who have
[1:50:19] been here from the beginning
[1:50:22] working in God's Vineyard and doing
[1:50:26] everything that they
[1:50:27] can and
[1:50:30] not
[1:50:32] complaining just
[1:50:34] working and brother Aaron is
[1:50:37] one unlike the ones in the parable this
[1:50:41] morning brother Aaron is one
[1:50:44] that he saw others like me come in a
[1:50:49] little bit later and he's not one that
[1:50:51] would ever complain
[1:50:53] and he just has that
[1:50:55] attitude I want to do
[1:50:57] something Lord let me continue to serve
[1:51:00] your people in your Vineyard do you
[1:51:03] appreciate our brother Aron
[1:51:06] Gara brother Joe come on up and close
