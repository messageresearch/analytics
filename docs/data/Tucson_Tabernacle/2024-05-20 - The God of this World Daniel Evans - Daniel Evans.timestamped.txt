[44:35] Saturday is that we uh something the
[44:39] enemy will always throw a curveball into
[44:42] your
[44:43] plans
[44:44] and some Stephanie and I were dealing
[44:48] with some stuff we were some some people
[44:50] that were close to us family members
[44:52] they said a couple things that that got
[44:55] to us and and we were a bit upset with
[44:57] this with with the whole situation so
[45:00] Stephanie and I were at uh at
[45:04] home and we were talking to each
[45:07] other and we were just complaining to
[45:11] each other and and we shouldn't do it
[45:13] and that's why when I came to church on
[45:16] Sunday morning I was like that why that
[45:17] was one of the first things I said is
[45:19] never say
[45:21] anything about anyone even it's if it's
[45:23] in your private home and to your closest
[45:28] person which would be your wife or your
[45:30] husband or your children be careful what
[45:33] you say so Stephanie and I were we were
[45:36] complaining to each other and we
[45:38] shouldn't
[45:39] have and uh the day goes by and we had
[45:44] ordered these these cakes uh for the
[45:47] mothers and I don't know how many we had
[45:50] 70 or 100 cakes or whatever it was and
[45:54] we uh we were going through the day and
[45:56] I was studying for my sermon and
[45:57] Stephanie was uh she was busy doing her
[46:00] thing and we forgot to pick up the
[46:05] cakes both of us were
[46:08] so devastated and both of us knew
[46:14] immediately that this was a result of us
[46:18] complaining even between a husband and a
[46:20] wife complaining and this was the Lord
[46:23] showing his children I'm a son of God
[46:27] Stephanie's a daughter of God he was
[46:29] showing us hey don't you say
[46:32] anything remember what I said last
[46:34] Sunday that if we are a Christian if
[46:38] we're not a
[46:39] Christian then we have every right to
[46:41] complain when somebody does us wrong we
[46:43] have every right to defend ourselves if
[46:45] somebody talks bad about us we have
[46:47] every right to get our
[46:49] way if if we are right in the in this
[46:53] course but when you become a Christian
[46:55] you forfeit those
[46:57] rights you no longer have a right to
[47:00] complain even if you're done wrong you
[47:02] no longer have a
[47:04] right to go after somebody even if they
[47:07] come after you when you become a
[47:10] Christian you forfeit those
[47:13] rights so I was feeling really like a
[47:17] hypocrite on
[47:19] Saturday because they were closed on
[47:21] Sunday
[47:22] morning and there was no way for us to
[47:25] get the gifts for our CH for our
[47:29] mothers I was
[47:31] upset Stephanie was upset so Stephanie
[47:35] was with her family with marily Lee and
[47:38] um um Stephanie's Brother David her her
[47:41] sister Tanya or her sister um Melissa
[47:45] and their families and uh they were
[47:47] there was it a what was it it was a
[47:49] shower um it was a dinner of some sort
[47:52] and I was at home studying and Stephanie
[47:57] was she was so upset she had told me on
[47:59] the phone we forgot this and I
[48:02] was like Lord first thing I did was I
[48:06] went before the Lord and said Lord I'm
[48:08] sorry I shouldn't have been complaining
[48:11] this morning and that was the first
[48:13] thing Stephanie said is when we were
[48:15] talking on the phone I said we shouldn't
[48:17] we shouldn't have
[48:19] complained
[48:21] so first thing we did is we got off the
[48:24] phone
[48:25] and I pray us Lord I'm
[48:29] wrong I we need a we need a miracle here
[48:33] and
[48:34] Stephanie she was worried and they had
[48:36] the the group around there and so
[48:39] Stephanie's telling the family about
[48:42] what we had done about how we forgot the
[48:44] cakes and Tanya my sister-in-law David
[48:48] Carroll's
[48:50] wife she said David knows the
[48:53] owner of the company
[48:58] and he calls the owner and the owner
[49:01] saysure I can meet you there on Sunday
[49:04] morning before church and and give you
[49:07] everything that you need and and you can
[49:09] bring your um bring it to your your
[49:11] church thought Lord once again got on
[49:15] our knees Lord you are so
[49:20] great he is brothers and sisters when I
[49:23] give a testimony and you know me now
[49:25] I've been preaching here here long
[49:27] enough when I give a testimony it's to
[49:29] show how foolish I am and how in
[49:32] inadequate I am and how how much I have
[49:35] no abilities at all but when you
[49:37] surrender to the Lord Jesus then he can
[49:40] make a way when you surrender to God he
[49:42] will make a way for you if you would
[49:44] just humble
[49:46] yourself and come before him and say
[49:48] Lord I'm sorry I'm not capable I need
[49:52] you and he's always there e puts his
[49:55] hand on us says I'll take care of it but
[49:59] the thing that we did
[50:01] right was we
[50:03] confessed before the Lord and we
[50:05] confessed to each other and then he made
[50:08] a
[50:08] way I also gave a testimony of uh of a
[50:13] brother that um had got into it with his
[50:16] with his colleague at work brother Manny
[50:19] is it okay if I say that it's
[50:23] you I don't want to embarrass you it's
[50:25] all right okay
[50:27] [Laughter]
[50:31] so brother Manny sends me a text last
[50:34] week and he says this he says good
[50:37] Afternoon brother Daniel I've been
[50:39] struggling with a coworker he said I
[50:41] went off on him he said that's not me he
[50:43] says it wasn't cool and I feel really
[50:45] bad about it he said the coworker has no
[50:47] respect but I'm going to apologize on
[50:49] Monday he said can you pre please pray
[50:52] for
[50:53] me prayed for brother Manny and then
[50:57] brother Manny apologizes he couldn't
[51:00] wait as I said he couldn't wait to get
[51:01] back to talk with this guy to make
[51:04] things right because remember what I
[51:06] said it doesn't have anything to do with
[51:08] Manny if he did him wrong what matters
[51:12] is how you how you respond to it brother
[51:16] Manny made a mistake and he was going
[51:18] and he wanted to make this right no
[51:19] matter what this man had done to him so
[51:21] you know it was a long weekend huh bro
[51:23] and then he finally gets back there and
[51:25] he's able to talk to this man and to
[51:28] make it right and then he sends me this
[51:29] this text he said good evening brother
[51:31] Daniel I don't mean to bother you he
[51:33] said I patched things up with my
[51:35] coworker but he stopped talking to me
[51:38] it's fine I have no animosity or hatred
[51:40] towards him I did my part God has
[51:43] blessed me so much
[51:45] am he says I don't care what they say
[51:48] about me God knows where my heart
[51:50] is same as we
[51:53] did and
[51:59] and it gets
[52:00] better and I responded to him I said
[52:02] brother Manny you did your best now it's
[52:04] up to the Lord to work on this man so
[52:07] then brother Manning sends me another
[52:09] text with a meme of a statue a picture
[52:13] that's missing the
[52:15] midsection of there it is right there of
[52:20] the
[52:21] middle and it says how empty the soul is
[52:24] without Jesus
[52:32] and he he writes me this this is how my
[52:35] life was when I was of the
[52:38] world until I met Jesus Christ he broke
[52:42] them chains of bondage of the street
[52:44] life and he deserves all the praise amen
[52:49] thank you brother Jordan then another
[52:51] day goes by and he sends me another text
[52:55] and he says brother good afternoon and
[52:56] brother Daniel my co-worker came to me
[52:59] and told me he was sorry for snapping at
[53:02] me we shook hands and made peace with
[53:05] each other we gave each other a big hug
[53:08] now we can
[53:12] clap did you notice that in both of
[53:15] these testimonies we had to
[53:18] repent we had to admit our faults and we
[53:21] had to ask God for mercy and then when
[53:23] we show that we are nothing but sinners
[53:27] that is when God steps in and gives us a
[53:30] testimony both times we weren't looking
[53:34] neither of us we weren't looking for a
[53:36] testimony to tell everyone about that
[53:39] would maybe Lift us us up and brag about
[53:43] something that the Lord did for us both
[53:47] times we humbled ourselves and said
[53:50] listen I'm the sinner I'm the what's
[53:53] wrong Lord help me I repent
[53:57] and then God Made A
[54:00] Way that's how we have to do brothers
[54:03] and sisters we don't seek our own
[54:05] thoughts we don't seek our own way we
[54:08] don't seek our own will we seek what God
[54:13] wants in our lives I want the church to
[54:16] please we we um we're under construction
[54:21] now and uh there's a lot of decisions
[54:24] that have to be make made and I want the
[54:26] church to pray for our renovation in in
[54:32] the construction that we're going
[54:33] through right now pray that sister
[54:36] Martha has been she's been looking to
[54:39] see how much it costs to rebuild the
[54:43] pews and then we've also brother Ed and
[54:47] I have looked in to getting chairs to
[54:49] replace to replace the pews we're trying
[54:52] to make the right decision so please
[54:56] please pray that the Lord will help us
[54:59] and we are together as a group and we
[55:02] want what's right and brothers and
[55:05] sisters I tell you I don't want anything
[55:07] with Daniel Evans at all I want my
[55:11] thoughts I want my desires I want them
[55:14] completely out of
[55:16] everything I want Lord I want what you
[55:19] want I want what God wants for our
[55:21] congregation I want what God wants for
[55:23] our
[55:25] people and that's that's the reason we
[55:28] see so many
[55:29] problems it seems like everybody is
[55:32] trying to get their
[55:34] way they always put themselves and their
[55:39] opinions above anyone
[55:42] else it's a
[55:44] stubbornness and I think that it's it's
[55:47] I think it's the most prevalent I think
[55:49] this problem
[55:51] of looking to ourselves and trying to
[55:54] serve ourselves is not not only the
[55:56] biggest problem in this church I believe
[55:59] it's the biggest problem in the entire
[56:01] world right
[56:03] now it's people trying to get what they
[56:07] want trying to please themselves and
[56:10] their opinion matters more than anyone
[56:12] else's what we should be doing is
[56:15] seeking God's will on these things
[56:17] putting him first and no matter what his
[56:20] decision is I don't even have an opinion
[56:22] on it Lord I want what you want
[56:26] that's how our attitude should
[56:30] be have your way Lord have your perfect
[56:33] will in every aspect of my life and that
[56:37] I know that's going to be better if I
[56:39] could just find his will I know it'll be
[56:40] better for our church I know it'll be
[56:42] better for our families I know it'll be
[56:44] better for our communities I know it'll
[56:46] be better about for our
[56:49] country we see the Holy Spirit if he
[56:54] would if we would just open our elves up
[56:57] instead of closing ourselves and try and
[56:59] get our way if we would just open
[57:00] ourselves up to him then we would
[57:03] Prosper we look in the politics of today
[57:07] we see these two Waring factions against
[57:09] each other and if they would just stop
[57:11] and if they would pray and they would
[57:13] ask the lord lord what do you want do
[57:15] you think he's going to tell the
[57:16] Democrats something that he's going to
[57:17] tell the
[57:18] Republicans he's God he's
[57:22] one and he'll say the same
[57:24] thing but instead we're just trying to
[57:27] get what we want we're trying to vote
[57:29] along the party
[57:30] lines instead of seeking God on those
[57:35] things if they would seek
[57:38] God then they would
[57:41] agree I know there would be little minor
[57:43] disagreements when we when we let the
[57:45] flesh get in there but our country would
[57:48] return to its Original
[57:51] Greatness we were talking yesterday
[57:53] wasn't complaining
[57:56] um but was
[57:59] talking not totally complaining I was
[58:03] talking with
[58:04] Stephanie about our
[58:07] President we should pray for our
[58:10] president I don't care if you're for
[58:12] Donald Trump or Joe Biden or whoever it
[58:14] is we should pray for our leaders
[58:16] because we will prosper if they make the
[58:19] right
[58:20] decisions we were I was telling her that
[58:24] this this man
[58:27] I was reading a a thing on the news and
[58:29] I said honey he's he's not
[58:32] capable he's not he's not in his right
[58:34] mind and I and wasn't
[58:40] complaining was just stating a fact
[58:42] that's a good excuse never do that but I
[58:46] was talking I was talking to Stephanie
[58:47] about this and I said he's not capable
[58:50] he can't even walk up to the
[58:53] podium and I said who's running the
[58:56] country and before she even thought
[58:59] about
[59:01] it she said
[59:04] Satan I thought that's
[59:08] right that's the
[59:11] truth and we see that it's Satan running
[59:14] this country
[59:17] because everybody's trying to get their
[59:20] way no one's thinking of the best for
[59:22] the country or the people they're trying
[59:24] to vote along the party Vines we see it
[59:27] back in the Garden of
[59:28] Eden right at the beginning of the Bible
[59:31] we see the serpent come in and he wanted
[59:35] his way and he had his way with
[59:38] Eve he got what he wanted and then we
[59:41] see even his
[59:43] children we see that they go through and
[59:46] we see the evilness of Cain and how Cain
[59:50] wanted his way and he was willing to
[59:52] kill his brother just to get his way his
[59:56] offering was not accepted by
[59:59] God and it angered him and it it
[1:00:03] offended him so much so instead of
[1:00:07] changing to God's
[1:00:09] way he killed his
[1:00:12] brother because he wanted his way of
[1:00:16] doing things and as I said I believe
[1:00:19] this is the biggest problem that's in
[1:00:21] the world
[1:00:23] today is we want our way remember the
[1:00:28] song Can't Always Get What You Want
[1:00:31] don't look it
[1:00:33] up brother Joe is a different Arrow huh
[1:00:36] but it's true you can't get what you
[1:00:39] want you want to get what you should
[1:00:43] want is what God
[1:00:46] wants and in this Great quest in our
[1:00:50] lives to get what we want we follow we
[1:00:53] fall into the Trap Of Destruction
[1:00:56] and that's why we see Wars around the
[1:00:58] world that's why we see hating in
[1:01:00] politics that's why we NE neither side
[1:01:03] cares you see countries attacking others
[1:01:06] because they want something and they are
[1:01:08] not seeking God about it but Sheed when
[1:01:12] they when they attacked Israel and
[1:01:13] Israel defends
[1:01:16] itself they want their way they want to
[1:01:20] conquer those people they want them
[1:01:22] wiped off the match show me how that can
[1:01:24] be God right it can't
[1:01:32] be most of the
[1:01:34] time and we talk about we pray about
[1:01:37] something most of the time we go to
[1:01:39] prayer with the wrong
[1:01:41] motives a large portion of the time you
[1:01:44] just want to say I prayed about
[1:01:46] it rather than staying in prayer and
[1:01:50] getting an answer from
[1:01:53] God and many times those answers don't
[1:01:55] come right away they come after hours of
[1:01:58] prayer and days and sometime years of
[1:02:03] prayer then you finally get an answer
[1:02:06] and God sees your heart that you're
[1:02:08] sincere in doing this in James chapter 4
[1:02:11] it says
[1:02:12] this verse one from whence come Wars and
[1:02:17] fightings among you he's talking about
[1:02:21] prayer from where does do these wars and
[1:02:24] fighting come come they not hint even of
[1:02:27] your lusts that war in your members that
[1:02:30] word
[1:02:31] lusts means Desires in this Modern
[1:02:34] English it doesn't have any sexual
[1:02:37] undertone it's because of your
[1:02:40] desires you lust and you have not you
[1:02:43] kill and desire to have and cannot
[1:02:46] obtain you fight and War you have not
[1:02:49] because you ask
[1:02:51] not you ask and receive not because you
[1:02:55] ask a miss
[1:02:57] that you may be consumed May consume it
[1:03:01] upon your
[1:03:04] lusts the NLT translation of that says
[1:03:08] and even when you ask you don't get it
[1:03:11] because your motives are all wrong you
[1:03:13] only want what will give you
[1:03:17] pleasure it's all about what you want
[1:03:20] and that's why God won't answer those
[1:03:22] prayers because we have a preconceived
[1:03:24] outcome in our Minds that we
[1:03:27] desire the right way to approach God is
[1:03:29] to say Lord let your will come into my
[1:03:31] mind and my heart and then I can do your
[1:03:35] will this has nothing to do with
[1:03:42] me it
[1:03:45] happens brothers and sisters it happens
[1:03:47] all the way from the very top all the
[1:03:50] way to to countries all the way down to
[1:03:53] churches all the way down to our
[1:03:55] individual families even a relationship
[1:03:59] between two
[1:04:01] people it's two people instead of
[1:04:05] getting on their knees and praying to
[1:04:08] the Lord and asking him Lord what is
[1:04:10] your will for me because I want to serve
[1:04:13] you I want to exalt you as the song was
[1:04:16] saying that we're singing We Sing the
[1:04:19] song but do we really want to exalt
[1:04:21] God or do we want to exalt ourselves do
[1:04:24] we want to serve ourselves eles but Lord
[1:04:27] I want to exalt you I want to serve you
[1:04:29] what is your will for us in our
[1:04:34] lives and you see sometimes that circle
[1:04:37] gets smaller and smaller because we have
[1:04:41] self self-promotion we have self-will
[1:04:44] and smaller and pretty soon we're the
[1:04:46] only ones standing in our Circle how
[1:04:49] does that go with drawing the circle
[1:04:51] bigger but more often the case that is
[1:04:55] the case
[1:04:58] and what's all the purpose in this
[1:05:00] Stephanie's answer to my
[1:05:04] question was who is in
[1:05:06] charge and she said the devil is she
[1:05:08] said Satan is 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:17] 4
[1:05:20] therefore seeing we have this ministry
[1:05:22] as we have received Mercy we faint not
[1:05:25] but we we have renounced the hidden
[1:05:28] things of dishonesty not walking in
[1:05:31] craftiness manipulating other people to
[1:05:34] get your
[1:05:35] way nor handling the word of God
[1:05:37] deceitfully a minister trying to get his
[1:05:40] way by using the word of God as
[1:05:43] justification but by manifest
[1:05:46] manifestation of the truth commending
[1:05:48] ourselves to Every Man's conscience in
[1:05:51] the sight of
[1:05:52] God but if our gospel be hid it it is
[1:05:55] hid to them that are
[1:05:57] lost in whom listen closely in whom the
[1:06:02] God of this
[1:06:05] world has blinded the minds of them
[1:06:08] which believe not lest the light of the
[1:06:10] Glorious gospel of Christ who is in the
[1:06:12] image of God who is the image of God
[1:06:15] should shine unto them so the gospel is
[1:06:19] hidden to those that are lost and how is
[1:06:22] it
[1:06:23] hidden everybody knows
[1:06:26] everybody knows the gospel everybody
[1:06:29] knows about Jesus you may not believe
[1:06:31] Jesus but everybody knows about him so
[1:06:35] how can it be
[1:06:37] hidden the God of this world has blinded
[1:06:41] the minds of those who don't believe and
[1:06:44] if he didn't blind their minds then they
[1:06:46] would have received the light of the
[1:06:48] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:06:50] image of God but instead they serve
[1:06:54] themselves ultimately the spirit of
[1:06:59] Satan makes
[1:07:02] us the god of our own
[1:07:05] worlds what he does his spirit is he
[1:07:09] wants to be exalted as God he wants to
[1:07:13] set up high in the high places and be as
[1:07:16] God over the people as the Bible
[1:07:18] says
[1:07:20] but he also wants us to follow him
[1:07:25] he wants the people to be like he
[1:07:31] is and then if we have his
[1:07:34] Spirit then we exalt ourselves as gods
[1:07:38] of our own
[1:07:39] worlds so that now we
[1:07:43] become the center of everything that is
[1:07:47] in our lives instead of God we become
[1:07:51] the center the
[1:07:53] center when Jesus and it's says how can
[1:07:56] how can Satan be the God of this world
[1:07:57] when Jesus was tempted in the
[1:08:01] wilderness Satan offered him the
[1:08:04] kingdoms he offered them everything so
[1:08:07] how can you offer someone something that
[1:08:09] you don't
[1:08:10] have we see that he is the God of this
[1:08:13] world because he owns it it's
[1:08:15] his and now he has created his own Eden
[1:08:19] here on Earth where he is the God and he
[1:08:21] wants us to do the
[1:08:23] same he wants us to follow in his
[1:08:26] footsteps so he's this spirit is Lord or
[1:08:30] this spirit is I'm going to be Lord over
[1:08:32] my life I am going to be the ruler I am
[1:08:35] going to live my life for
[1:08:39] myself Genesis chapter 3 when they
[1:08:43] fell in the Garden of Eden Genesis 3:22
[1:08:47] and the Lord God said behold the man has
[1:08:50] become as one of us to know good and
[1:08:53] evil and now lest he put forth his hand
[1:08:55] and take also of the tree of life and
[1:08:57] eat and live forever so mankind is
[1:09:00] creating their own world with their own
[1:09:02] knowledge outside of God and they're
[1:09:04] beginning to trust now in their own
[1:09:06] merits in their own feelings in their
[1:09:09] own desires rather than trusting in God
[1:09:11] for everything and then he kicks them
[1:09:14] out of the Garden of
[1:09:18] Eden even in
[1:09:20] nature
[1:09:21] humans even in the in the natural world
[1:09:24] humans through their
[1:09:26] technology
[1:09:28] now they can
[1:09:30] change the hormones and and they can
[1:09:33] make their bodies different than
[1:09:36] something God has created mankind now
[1:09:39] has the ability to change the gender of
[1:09:43] a man or a woman this has never been the
[1:09:46] case how can this be it's because
[1:09:49] they're God over their own
[1:09:53] lives I don't care what God Made Me I
[1:09:55] don't care what God
[1:09:57] says I am going to do what I want to
[1:10:02] do and now we have we're able to use
[1:10:04] technology to do it Deuteronomy 22:5
[1:10:08] says this a woman shall not wear that
[1:10:10] which pertaineth unto a man neither
[1:10:12] shall the man put on a woman's garment
[1:10:15] for all that do so are an
[1:10:17] Abomination to the Lord thy
[1:10:21] God a woman should not wear masculine
[1:10:24] clothes and a man should should not wear
[1:10:25] feminine clothes that's meant to
[1:10:27] separate the
[1:10:29] genders a woman should look like a lady
[1:10:32] a woman should look feminine and a man
[1:10:34] should look
[1:10:36] masculine you should be able to tell the
[1:10:41] difference otherwise the Bible says it's
[1:10:43] an Abomination it disgusts
[1:10:46] God they all wore a robe back
[1:10:50] then but those the sisters wore a
[1:10:53] feminine robe and and the brothers they
[1:10:56] wore a masculine robe there was a
[1:10:58] difference and you see if you saw a man
[1:11:02] wearing a woman's robe you'd say there's
[1:11:04] something wrong
[1:11:07] here and that's what he said he
[1:11:10] said I want this these genders separated
[1:11:14] but now we can even change our
[1:11:17] anatomy now it's beyond
[1:11:20] clothes a woman can dress up like a man
[1:11:22] and look like a man but now
[1:11:26] she can change to a man a man can change
[1:11:29] to a woman and it's all because of
[1:11:32] self-will I am here on this Earth to get
[1:11:36] my way I'm here to serve myself and
[1:11:39] that's what I want that's the
[1:11:41] extreme but we're all subject to that
[1:11:44] influence every one of us let's go back
[1:11:47] to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 5 for
[1:11:50] we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus
[1:11:53] the Lord and ourselves your servants for
[1:11:55] jesus' sake Paul is saying that we are
[1:11:57] not preaching these things to serve
[1:11:59] ourselves and get our way the Amplified
[1:12:02] Bible says this for we preach not
[1:12:03] ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord and
[1:12:06] our and ourselves merely as your bonder
[1:12:09] servants for jesus'
[1:12:11] sake so we're not preaching this to
[1:12:13] benefit
[1:12:14] ourselves in
[1:12:17] fact we're slaves for Jesus's sake it's
[1:12:21] the other way
[1:12:24] around the minister is preaching to get
[1:12:27] his way or to further his narrative like
[1:12:29] the politicians do and to prove that his
[1:12:32] doctrines are right then he's thinking
[1:12:34] of
[1:12:36] himself and not
[1:12:39] Christ there's so
[1:12:41] many ministers I do
[1:12:44] that but I ask have they had a true
[1:12:46] experience with God where they
[1:12:48] completely surrender to the word and
[1:12:50] they are willing to preach whatever the
[1:12:54] Bible says even if it disagrees with
[1:12:57] their way of
[1:12:59] thinking that's a question to
[1:13:01] ask for all of us that stand in this
[1:13:04] pulpit and all of everyone else that
[1:13:06] listens to the one standing in the in
[1:13:08] the pull pit again Paul's saying he's
[1:13:11] saying we're not preaching this to
[1:13:12] promote our own Ministries but in fact
[1:13:16] we're we become your slaves we lowering
[1:13:19] ourselves to serving you for the for the
[1:13:23] gospel of Christ's sake for God who
[1:13:25] commanded the light to shine out of the
[1:13:27] darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:13:29] give the light of knowledge of the
[1:13:31] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[1:13:32] face of Jesus Christ but we have it this
[1:13:35] treasure in Earth and
[1:13:38] vessels that the Excellency of the of
[1:13:40] the power may be of God and not of us
[1:13:44] again it's not about me it's not about
[1:13:47] getting my way and these Earth and
[1:13:49] vessels you know what they are they're
[1:13:52] us they're human beings that all
[1:13:55] although unworthy they contain The
[1:13:58] Treasure of the Holy
[1:14:01] Spirit we are troubled on every side yet
[1:14:03] not distressed we are perplexed but not
[1:14:06] in despair persecuted but not forsaken
[1:14:09] cast down but not destroyed always
[1:14:12] bearing about in the body of the dying
[1:14:14] of the Lord
[1:14:16] Jesus that the
[1:14:19] life also of Jesus might be made
[1:14:22] manifest in our body
[1:14:25] these Earth and
[1:14:26] vessels then that power that raised
[1:14:29] Jesus from the dead will dwell within us
[1:14:32] and the Holy Spirit will dwell in these
[1:14:34] Earth and vessels that the Excellency of
[1:14:37] the
[1:14:38] power may be of God and not of
[1:14:42] us so what does that mean it means that
[1:14:45] we need to surrender Our Lives brother
[1:14:47] and
[1:14:48] sisters to God to him remember in the
[1:14:52] Garden of Gethsemane
[1:14:56] came down to the
[1:14:59] end he could have walked
[1:15:02] away he knew that they were coming to
[1:15:06] get him and here he is bowing on his
[1:15:09] knees the
[1:15:11] man Jesus the man remember he was Flesh
[1:15:16] and
[1:15:17] Blood he was a human
[1:15:20] being and there he is and he's crying
[1:15:22] out to God and he's says Lord let this
[1:15:26] cup pass from me but thy will be done
[1:15:30] not my
[1:15:33] will that's a Christian that is the way
[1:15:37] we should be for we which live are
[1:15:39] always delivered unto death for Jesus's
[1:15:42] sake that the life of Jesus might be
[1:15:44] made manifest in our mortal flesh what
[1:15:47] is that life of Jesus that life of Jesus
[1:15:49] is a surrender to God complete surrender
[1:15:53] Lord I don't even want to have opinion I
[1:15:55] just want what you
[1:15:57] want tell me Lord show me what you want
[1:16:00] and I want to fall in line but it's the
[1:16:02] hardest thing for a human being to do
[1:16:07] today there's life if we die to our own
[1:16:11] thinking if we die to our own
[1:16:12] stubbornness if we die to our own
[1:16:15] desires there is
[1:16:18] life so how can we have he's talking
[1:16:21] about that we die and then we live how
[1:16:23] can we have both death and life let me
[1:16:25] read that that scripture again for we
[1:16:28] which are which live are always
[1:16:30] delivered unto death for Jesus's
[1:16:33] sake everybody
[1:16:36] dies from Adam until now everybody with
[1:16:40] the exception of Enoch and
[1:16:42] Elijah everyone has gone the way of
[1:16:44] death so he's saying here we all die
[1:16:47] that
[1:16:48] death that the life also of Jesus might
[1:16:51] be made manifest in our Mortal Mortal
[1:16:54] self so how can we have both life and
[1:16:58] death the last verse verse 12 answers
[1:17:02] it so then death worketh in us but life
[1:17:06] in
[1:17:09] you the life comes from the spirit of
[1:17:13] God death comes from the Mortal
[1:17:17] bodies we teach our
[1:17:20] children they watch us and we we show
[1:17:23] our children how to we want to get our
[1:17:26] way no matter
[1:17:27] what and then we teach our families to
[1:17:29] do that we teach our children to get
[1:17:32] your way in
[1:17:36] life I'm
[1:17:37] talking about everyone I'm not just
[1:17:40] talking
[1:17:41] about sexual
[1:17:45] immorality I'm talking about all of us
[1:17:48] that we spend our lives trying to get
[1:17:49] our ways rather than surrendering Our
[1:17:51] Lives to the desires of God for his will
[1:17:58] I
[1:18:00] really I use the
[1:18:02] example of changing your gender because
[1:18:05] it's so blaring but it's the same spirit
[1:18:09] all the way down in the
[1:18:11] churches all of us we are going to be
[1:18:14] the
[1:18:15] center of our world and we create this
[1:18:19] world around us where we are God and our
[1:18:23] opinion matters more than anything
[1:18:27] else you hear when when I'm witnessing
[1:18:30] to
[1:18:31] people you hear that oh I'm
[1:18:34] spiritual or I have
[1:18:38] something that you know you ask them do
[1:18:40] you know the Lord do you know
[1:18:43] God is there something in you that that
[1:18:46] wants to know God and then they they
[1:18:48] respond if you if you witness to a lot
[1:18:50] of people they respond that oh I'm
[1:18:52] spiritual or I have my own relation
[1:18:56] and what they're saying is that I I Am
[1:18:58] The Sinner of my world and I'll have a
[1:19:01] God in it as long as God does what I
[1:19:04] say as long as God listens to what I do
[1:19:07] what I say what I tell him to do then
[1:19:10] yeah God can come into my life otherwise
[1:19:13] I don't want
[1:19:14] God the exact
[1:19:17] opposite Psalm 81 says this verse
[1:19:23] 7 thou call callest in in
[1:19:26] trouble the Lord's speaking the
[1:19:29] anointing upon the psalmist thou callest
[1:19:32] in trouble and I delivered Thee I
[1:19:35] answered thee in the secret place of
[1:19:37] Thunder I proved thee By the Waters of
[1:19:41] meba Sila do you remember from our
[1:19:43] Wednesday night bible study what Sila
[1:19:46] means it means
[1:19:48] pause it means take it means take a
[1:19:51] moment and digest what you just read
[1:19:54] what you just heard here oh my
[1:19:57] people and I will testify unto thee oh
[1:20:00] Israel if thou will hearken unto me
[1:20:03] there shall be there shall no strange
[1:20:05] God be in thee if you listen to me
[1:20:09] neither shall thou worship any strange
[1:20:11] God I am the Lord thy God which brought
[1:20:14] thee out of the land of Egypt open thy
[1:20:17] mouth wide and I will fill
[1:20:21] it but my people would not hearken to my
[1:20:25] voice and
[1:20:27] Israel would none of
[1:20:30] me so I gave them up unto their own
[1:20:33] hearts
[1:20:34] lusts and they walked in their own
[1:20:38] counsel how true is that today we went
[1:20:40] through the Book of
[1:20:42] Judges and how Israel could was
[1:20:44] condemned because everyone did what was
[1:20:46] right in their own
[1:20:48] eyes they made their decision based on
[1:20:50] their own morality or their own
[1:20:53] understanding without dilig ently
[1:20:55] seeking
[1:20:56] God they lived in a world that pleased
[1:20:59] themselves rather than pleasing God
[1:21:00] verse
[1:21:02] 13 oh that my people had hearkened unto
[1:21:05] me and Israel had walked in my ways I
[1:21:07] should have subdued their enemies and
[1:21:09] turned my hand against their adversaries
[1:21:11] I would have come to help them if they
[1:21:13] would have just listened to me rather
[1:21:15] than doing it
[1:21:18] themselves the haters of the Lord should
[1:21:20] have submitted themselves unto him but
[1:21:22] their time should have endured
[1:21:25] forever he should have fed them also
[1:21:27] with the finest of Wheat and with honey
[1:21:29] out of the rock should I have satisfied
[1:21:32] thee you missed the blessings of God
[1:21:34] because you wanted your
[1:21:36] way it's a
[1:21:39] shame I was talking
[1:21:42] with the kids on Friday night in the
[1:21:46] upper room and it was it was a smaller
[1:21:49] group of us so we we had a little bible
[1:21:51] study and uh Camila had on your phone
[1:21:55] you had your daily scripture and it was
[1:21:57] Matthew
[1:21:59] 28:19 go you into all the world and make
[1:22:02] disciples and I asked the group I said
[1:22:05] what does that mean why would you want
[1:22:07] to be a
[1:22:08] disciple what what what does that mean
[1:22:11] why would you want to be a disciple of
[1:22:13] this man Jesus how would that benefit
[1:22:16] anyone and and what does that even mean
[1:22:19] to be a
[1:22:20] disciple and come I think it was you
[1:22:23] that gave the the answer is that we all
[1:22:26] want to be identified with
[1:22:29] something we want to be identified
[1:22:31] through social media with this
[1:22:32] influencer or that in influencer and she
[1:22:35] said to be a disciple of Jesus is to be
[1:22:42] identified with
[1:22:45] him I thought that was really better
[1:22:50] than any answer I could have
[1:22:52] given and then it goes on and says
[1:22:55] to be
[1:22:57] baptized and we talked about what does
[1:22:59] it mean to be baptized and it's
[1:23:02] requirement that you are baptized in his
[1:23:08] name that you are no more your own
[1:23:11] person now you are taking on the name of
[1:23:14] God and you are no more your own person
[1:23:17] you surrender to God and you are making
[1:23:20] this public confession and that's what
[1:23:22] baptism is
[1:23:25] Lord I want to be with you I'm done
[1:23:28] Daniel Evans is
[1:23:29] finished now it's all the
[1:23:32] Lord after our discussion Hano and I had
[1:23:35] a chance to talk and and he asked he
[1:23:38] asked me when I was baptized and and
[1:23:41] just some some personal questions about
[1:23:42] my testimony
[1:23:45] and I told him I said well I said I gave
[1:23:48] my heart to the Lord on my 21st birthday
[1:23:50] I said I was a sinner I wasn't living
[1:23:52] right and I said said I I felt in my
[1:23:56] heart I felt condemned so I gave I made
[1:23:58] a commitment to the Lord and I gave my
[1:24:00] heart to him there but I didn't yet have
[1:24:03] the Holy
[1:24:06] Spirit that was a change in my life
[1:24:08] believe me that was the most pronounced
[1:24:10] change in my life that anyone has ever
[1:24:13] seen that that has seen me but has has
[1:24:16] known me but that wasn't
[1:24:18] it so time went
[1:24:22] on and H started asking about the Holy
[1:24:25] Spirit and and when that I receive that
[1:24:30] Holy
[1:24:31] Spirit and by this time it was just him
[1:24:34] and me
[1:24:35] talking and I said that there was a a
[1:24:41] time that I
[1:24:43] knew that I had received the Holy Ghost
[1:24:46] and and uh I don't know if Sister Yunis
[1:24:48] is back there but it was similar she
[1:24:51] gave a testimony one of our testimonies
[1:24:53] nights it was similar to that there was
[1:24:57] I was driving home from work it was late
[1:25:00] at night and there was something about
[1:25:03] this the the Lord was dealing with me
[1:25:06] and I knew I had completely surrendered
[1:25:10] to
[1:25:11] God and it was no more my own world it
[1:25:17] was no more I was closed off and I was
[1:25:20] the God of this world it was Lord I will
[1:25:22] do anything that you want
[1:25:25] I will preach I will say I will do
[1:25:27] anything that you want me to do because
[1:25:30] it's no more about me I want to
[1:25:32] surrender everything no matter what it
[1:25:34] is and now it's about you and I told him
[1:25:37] that was the moment that I knew that the
[1:25:40] Holy Spirit came into my life came into
[1:25:42] my heart and it wasn't that I spoke in
[1:25:44] tongues it wasn't that I even had an
[1:25:46] emotional response I wasn't crying there
[1:25:48] was
[1:25:49] nothing different about it other than I
[1:25:52] was sure I have the spirit of God in
[1:25:58] this vessel this Earth and vessel and
[1:26:02] that's how I know Lord
[1:26:04] whatever if I can just find your will
[1:26:07] whatever that will is
[1:26:11] whatever it takes I want to be that
[1:26:15] Stephen in the book of Acts he said he
[1:26:17] makes a statement he said you always
[1:26:20] he's talking to the Pharisees that are
[1:26:21] that are going to Stone him they cast
[1:26:23] him out of the city and they're standing
[1:26:24] there this man this young man named sa
[1:26:26] of Tarsus is there and they're going to
[1:26:28] kill this man and Stephen looks up and
[1:26:30] he says you always
[1:26:33] resist the Holy
[1:26:35] Ghost and it's because they want what
[1:26:38] they want themselves they want to be the
[1:26:40] god of their
[1:26:42] world it's like two Waring
[1:26:46] armies I am one Army you are one Army
[1:26:49] and God is the other
[1:26:51] Army and we're fighting against God
[1:26:55] it's our nature brothers and sisters
[1:26:56] don't say that you haven't been that way
[1:26:58] because you have you were born like that
[1:27:01] and we're fighting against God we want
[1:27:03] our way God wants his way and when two
[1:27:06] armies are fighting against each other
[1:27:08] and one Army is prevailing is overcoming
[1:27:11] the other Army there's this thing called
[1:27:14] surrender you raise up your hands and
[1:27:16] you give
[1:27:18] up and then you are under the control of
[1:27:23] that other Army that dominating Army
[1:27:25] that just won the battle that caused you
[1:27:28] to
[1:27:30] surrender you raise your
[1:27:32] hand say I give up raise the white flag
[1:27:36] say don't shoot
[1:27:38] anymore but imagine if you don't
[1:27:42] surrender imagine if the if the two
[1:27:44] armies against each other and this Army
[1:27:46] says we are going to fight to the last
[1:27:47] man we're not surrendering one after the
[1:27:50] other they
[1:27:52] fall and if you don't surrender you will
[1:27:56] be
[1:27:57] destroyed God is the prevailing Army I
[1:28:00] promise
[1:28:01] you Jehovah God has never lost a battle
[1:28:04] that's right if the people will put him
[1:28:08] first and not sin show me a place where
[1:28:11] they ever
[1:28:13] lost but when they sin is when they
[1:28:17] lose so us when we surrender then we
[1:28:21] come into the care
[1:28:24] of the other
[1:28:26] Army and we are completely subject to
[1:28:28] that other Army we lay down our arms we
[1:28:31] give up that other army takes
[1:28:34] in as a
[1:28:37] prisoner Paul
[1:28:39] said I am a prisoner of
[1:28:44] Christ not I'm going to rule my own
[1:28:48] world not I'm going to do it my way but
[1:28:51] now I become a prisoner
[1:28:55] of
[1:28:56] Christ
[1:28:58] Jeremiah the Lord sends him one
[1:29:02] day to see this Potter the Lord raises
[1:29:08] him up he says go over to this Potter's
[1:29:10] house and watch him work do you know
[1:29:12] what a Potter is when you have the clay
[1:29:14] and they have the thing that spins
[1:29:16] around and and the Potter takes the clay
[1:29:18] and he puts water on his hands and he
[1:29:19] starts forming this pot and he puts his
[1:29:21] hand in there and and makes makes this
[1:29:23] vessel and and then he takes it and and
[1:29:25] they he fires it well Jeremiah's
[1:29:28] watching this Potter God's with him he's
[1:29:31] saying watch what he's doing so he's
[1:29:33] watching this guy and the thing's
[1:29:34] spinning and he's forming this and there
[1:29:37] was a imperfection in the
[1:29:40] pot and the Potter sees
[1:29:43] it and
[1:29:46] he mashes it back
[1:29:48] up reforms it puts it back on the thing
[1:29:51] that spins around and starts forming it
[1:29:56] again
[1:29:59] then Jeremiah God tells
[1:30:03] Jeremiah he says behold the clay that is
[1:30:07] in the Potter's hands he said so are you
[1:30:11] in my
[1:30:15] hands he says see how I can recreate
[1:30:19] this thing that had blemishes that was
[1:30:20] messed up I can take it and I can reform
[1:30:23] it
[1:30:25] he says now go and tell the people what
[1:30:28] I said tell them this experience preach
[1:30:31] this sermon about this
[1:30:33] Potter so Jeremiah
[1:30:36] goes and he goes to the people and he
[1:30:39] preaches this sermon to the people
[1:30:41] Jeremiah
[1:30:45] 18:12 and the people
[1:30:47] respond to the prophet Jeremiah's
[1:30:50] sermon and they said there is no hope
[1:30:54] but we will walk after our own
[1:30:58] devices and we will do everyone do the
[1:31:02] imagination of his evil heart the NLT
[1:31:05] says don't waste your
[1:31:07] breath we will continue to live as we
[1:31:10] want to stubbornly following our own
[1:31:13] evil
[1:31:15] desires the
[1:31:17] enemy has the same purpose he's trying
[1:31:20] to get us to continue to follow along
[1:31:22] the way that we're doing
[1:31:24] and not surrender to God like this like
[1:31:26] this lump of clay there was a blemish
[1:31:28] and there's so many blemishes in me I
[1:31:31] see so many sins and I see so many
[1:31:33] things wrong with me and it's just like
[1:31:35] Lord all right here we go again Mash me
[1:31:38] up and for
[1:31:41] me I want to be that perfect vessel and
[1:31:45] he says I can do
[1:31:47] it God tells us I can do
[1:31:50] it just surrender to me
[1:31:55] I'll close
[1:31:57] with this man John the
[1:32:00] Baptist I
[1:32:04] believe he was the greatest of them all
[1:32:10] have pretty good reference in saying
[1:32:12] that is Jesus said the same
[1:32:16] thing this man John the
[1:32:19] Baptist it's a young man he was from the
[1:32:22] priesthood he goes in the wilderness as
[1:32:25] a young man and he is his whole desire
[1:32:28] and I can prove that John the Baptist
[1:32:30] more than anyone I have ever seen aside
[1:32:33] aside from the Lord Jesus wanted God's
[1:32:36] Will and it didn't matter what his will
[1:32:39] was John wanted God's will so he goes in
[1:32:42] the wilderness and he lives he comes out
[1:32:44] of the Wilderness and he starts
[1:32:46] preaching repentance and he starts
[1:32:47] preaching like hey you're not all
[1:32:49] that you need to repent and you need to
[1:32:52] come to this these Waters
[1:32:54] and be baptized for the remission of
[1:32:57] sins so he's preaching
[1:33:00] this and the lord gave
[1:33:04] him some
[1:33:06] Vision John 1 ver
[1:33:11] 25 and they asked
[1:33:13] him and said why baptizes thou then if
[1:33:16] thou be not that Christ nor Elias
[1:33:18] neither that
[1:33:19] Prophet John answered them saying I
[1:33:22] baptize with water but there standeth
[1:33:23] one among you whom you know not he it is
[1:33:26] who after coming after me is preferred
[1:33:28] before me whose shoes latched I am not
[1:33:30] worthy to un loose these things were
[1:33:33] done in bethabara Beyond Jordan where
[1:33:37] John was baptizing the next day John
[1:33:40] seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith
[1:33:42] Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away
[1:33:44] the sins of the
[1:33:47] world right there we see that John was
[1:33:51] the first Christian
[1:33:55] this is he of whom I said after me
[1:33:58] cometh a man which is preferred before
[1:34:00] me for he was before me this is the one
[1:34:04] I told you
[1:34:06] about this is the one that's coming
[1:34:08] after me who is far greater than me this
[1:34:11] is
[1:34:14] him and I knew him
[1:34:17] not but that he should be made made
[1:34:20] manifest to Israel therefore am I come
[1:34:23] baptizing with water NLT says I didn't
[1:34:27] recognize him as the Messiah but I have
[1:34:29] been baptizing with water so that he
[1:34:31] might be revealed to
[1:34:34] Israel and John bear record saying I saw
[1:34:37] the
[1:34:38] Spirit descending from heaven like a
[1:34:40] dove and it Abode on him and I knew him
[1:34:44] not but he that sent me to baptize with
[1:34:47] water the same said okay so John's
[1:34:50] saying the one that sent me to baptize
[1:34:52] the one that gave me my commission
[1:34:54] this same one which was who was
[1:34:57] God this same one told
[1:35:01] John upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit
[1:35:05] descending and remaining on him the same
[1:35:07] is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost
[1:35:10] so John had an experience before this
[1:35:12] happened he saw this in a vision or or
[1:35:15] however the Lord spoke to John and he
[1:35:17] said that this one that's coming this is
[1:35:20] the one that's not going to baptize you
[1:35:22] in water but he is going to baptize you
[1:35:25] with the holy spirit of God the same God
[1:35:28] that moved across the waters in Genesis
[1:35:32] chapter 1 that separated the light from
[1:35:35] the darkness that created light upon the
[1:35:38] Earth this Same
[1:35:41] Spirit is coming and it's not going to
[1:35:44] be water like I'm baptizing you with
[1:35:47] you're going to get baptized with that
[1:35:51] Spirit was John's old Ministry hisory
[1:35:54] look how
[1:35:56] important to John this is and I saw on
[1:35:59] bare record that this is the Son of God
[1:36:02] again the next day after John stood and
[1:36:04] two of his disciples and looking Upon
[1:36:06] Jesus as he walked he said Behold the
[1:36:08] Lamb of God and the two disciples heard
[1:36:10] him speak and they followed
[1:36:13] Jesus John and
[1:36:16] Andrew
[1:36:17] now this was John's whole Commission in
[1:36:21] life this was everything thing to
[1:36:25] John this was his whole Ministry that
[1:36:28] we're talking about but John more than
[1:36:30] anyone else as I said John was not the
[1:36:34] god of his
[1:36:35] world John's world did not revolve
[1:36:38] around his ministry John was willing to
[1:36:40] give it up at any time for God he was
[1:36:44] willing to say I'm
[1:36:46] wrong he was willing to do anything this
[1:36:50] great man John the Baptist and I'm going
[1:36:53] to prove to you that he was willing to
[1:36:56] do that the musicians can come and get
[1:36:59] ready Luke 7:
[1:37:02] 19 this is after this is John's in
[1:37:05] prison
[1:37:06] now these people hated
[1:37:09] John he was thrown in prison they wanted
[1:37:13] his
[1:37:14] head and here he is and his disciples
[1:37:17] were come to him and John calling unto
[1:37:20] him two of his disciples sent them to
[1:37:22] Jesus saying are thou he that should
[1:37:27] come or look we for
[1:37:31] another so John is asking he's saying
[1:37:34] hey I know I preached this
[1:37:37] message I know I did I I know I preach
[1:37:40] to you all of this stuff but I want to
[1:37:42] be
[1:37:43] right I could be
[1:37:46] wrong it was the most important thing to
[1:37:48] John the Baptist that he was right with
[1:37:51] God not that he was proven right not
[1:37:54] that he was the god of his world but
[1:37:56] that he was right with the father no one
[1:37:58] else mattered to John so he said hey can
[1:38:00] you just go ask
[1:38:02] him I know we had this experience I know
[1:38:06] I know I said all of this but this is so
[1:38:08] important just ask him am I
[1:38:12] right when the men were come to him they
[1:38:16] said John the Baptist has sent us unto
[1:38:18] thee saying art thou he that should come
[1:38:21] or should we look for another
[1:38:25] and in that same hour he cured many of
[1:38:27] their infirmities and plagues and of
[1:38:29] evil spirits and unto many that were
[1:38:31] blind he gave sight then Jesus answered
[1:38:34] and said unto them go your way tell John
[1:38:38] what things that you have seen and
[1:38:40] heard how that the blind
[1:38:43] see the lame walk the lepers are
[1:38:46] cleansed the deaf here the dead are
[1:38:48] raised the
[1:38:50] poor to the poor the gospel is pre
[1:38:53] preached
[1:38:54] preached and blessed is he whosoever
[1:38:56] shall not be offended in
[1:38:59] me another translation says God blesses
[1:39:02] those who don't fall away because of
[1:39:05] me the Messiah requires a
[1:39:08] lot but God will bless those who when
[1:39:12] they hear the true gospel preached that
[1:39:14] they won't fall away until their own
[1:39:17] selfishness to their own Traditions but
[1:39:19] they will surrender to God
[1:39:23] and when the messengers of John were
[1:39:26] departed then Jesus began to talk to
[1:39:28] them to his
[1:39:31] people he began to speak unto the people
[1:39:34] concerning John and he says what went
[1:39:36] you out in the wilderness to see he said
[1:39:39] a reed shaken With the Wind many of
[1:39:42] these people that were there were
[1:39:43] baptized by
[1:39:46] John but what we went you out to see a
[1:39:48] mo a man clothed in soft rment behold
[1:39:51] they which are gorgeously appar
[1:39:54] which are gor gorgeously apparel and
[1:39:56] live delicately are in the king's courts
[1:39:59] but what went you out to see a
[1:40:01] prophet I say unto you much more than a
[1:40:05] Prophet this is he of whom it is written
[1:40:07] behold I send my messenger before thy
[1:40:09] face Malachi chapter 3 is quoting which
[1:40:12] shall prepare thy way before thee for I
[1:40:15] say unto you among those that are born
[1:40:17] of women there is not a greater Prophet
[1:40:20] than John the Baptist but he that is
[1:40:22] least in in the kingdom is greater than
[1:40:24] he and all the people that heard him and
[1:40:27] all the publicans Justified God being
[1:40:29] baptized with the baptism of John but
[1:40:31] the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected
[1:40:33] the counsel of God against themselves
[1:40:35] being not baptized of him they wanted
[1:40:37] their
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:43] way and the Lord said where unto where
[1:40:46] unto then shall I liken the men of this
[1:40:48] generation and to what are they
[1:40:51] like they are like unto children sitting
[1:40:53] in the marketplace and calling one to
[1:40:55] another and saying we have piped unto
[1:40:56] you but you have not danced we have
[1:40:58] mourned to you but you have not wept for
[1:41:00] John the Baptist came neither eating
[1:41:02] bread nor drinking wine you say he ha
[1:41:04] the devil the son of man cometh eating
[1:41:06] and drinking and you say Behold a
[1:41:08] gluttonous man a wine bibber a friend of
[1:41:11] publicans and sinners they're calling
[1:41:13] Jesus
[1:41:14] worldly because he didn't line up with
[1:41:16] their religious world that they had
[1:41:18] created in their
[1:41:19] [Music]
[1:41:20] minds but wisdom is Justified of all our
[1:41:25] children you see John the
[1:41:28] Baptist he was
[1:41:31] willing to go before whoever it was and
[1:41:35] say I was
[1:41:37] wrong I was mistaken about my religion I
[1:41:40] was mistaken about the way I thought but
[1:41:43] do you see his heart he had a pure heart
[1:41:46] and he was
[1:41:49] right but the reason he was the greatest
[1:41:51] of them all is because he was was
[1:41:53] willing to Humble himself for
[1:41:58] God and he wasn't
[1:42:00] wrong he was very much
[1:42:05] right and I see that how many of us are
[1:42:09] willing to say you know what I may have
[1:42:12] been
[1:42:13] wrong about the way I
[1:42:15] believe I may have I may have have have
[1:42:18] thought wrongly about certain things
[1:42:20] about maybe some of my doctrines I could
[1:42:23] have been wrong well not me brother I'm
[1:42:25] sure about what I believe are you more
[1:42:26] sure than John the Baptist was when he
[1:42:28] looked across the river and said Behold
[1:42:30] the Lamb of God I think
[1:42:34] not we always have to be
[1:42:37] willing to Humble ourselves and say I am
[1:42:40] not the sinner of My Universe I am not
[1:42:43] the the god of my
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:48] world the God of this world ultimately
[1:42:51] becomes ourselves brother and sisters we
[1:42:54] want our
[1:42:55] way and God you can be my God as long as
[1:42:58] you'll serve
[1:42:59] me that's the way of the world that's
[1:43:02] the attitude of the
[1:43:04] world but we should be falling down on
[1:43:06] our knees and crying say Lord I just
[1:43:08] want your
[1:43:10] will Jesus
[1:43:12] said he said straight is the gate and
[1:43:15] narrow is the way and few there will be
[1:43:18] that find
[1:43:19] it it's going to be those that actually
[1:43:22] surrender to the the Lord those are
[1:43:24] going to be the ones that find it Jesus
[1:43:28] said many will come in that day and say
[1:43:30] have I not done many mighty works in
[1:43:32] your
[1:43:33] name have I not cast out
[1:43:36] devils in your name maybe healed the
[1:43:38] sick in your name have I not done all
[1:43:41] these
[1:43:42] things and Jesus will say depart from me
[1:43:45] you that work iniquity I never knew
[1:43:50] you the Pharisees they look looked the
[1:43:55] part but the
[1:43:57] disciples they were
[1:43:59] these of the Pharisees thought there are
[1:44:02] these these worldly people that came out
[1:44:04] of the world that they had a tender
[1:44:06] heart brother Manny they would do
[1:44:07] anything Lord whatever it takes I'm
[1:44:09] going to do it I may have this bad past
[1:44:12] I may look this way and but Lord I just
[1:44:14] want to serve you I want to make it
[1:44:16] right with my colleague at
[1:44:19] work I'm willing to say I was wrong I'm
[1:44:23] willing to say I looked at people and I
[1:44:25] judged them
[1:44:27] wrong I condemned them and I'm the one
[1:44:30] that should be
[1:44:32] condemned as I said My Testimony with my
[1:44:35] wife we
[1:44:39] repented Lord we're sorry for
[1:44:41] complaining we have no right to complain
[1:44:45] you've done everything and we just we
[1:44:47] just want to be in your will and then
[1:44:49] look what he did he talk about a miracle
[1:44:53] right there sitting next to my wife was
[1:44:55] the one that knew the owner of the the
[1:44:59] company he says I'll take care of
[1:45:02] it he says you're my
[1:45:04] child that Potter that
[1:45:08] clay he says no I'll just REM mold it
[1:45:10] you're okay you're all right but I've
[1:45:13] done all this Lord I've messed up I I've
[1:45:15] sinned and I've I've I've made all these
[1:45:16] mistakes he's like it's all
[1:45:19] right just let me do
[1:45:21] it don't be the god of Your World let me
[1:45:24] be the god of your
[1:45:25] world and then he can remake
[1:45:30] us Bible says that we seek out our
[1:45:33] own salvation through fear and
[1:45:36] trembling am I saying that you should
[1:45:38] question what you believe
[1:45:42] yes I
[1:45:44] am go before God and ask him Lord am I
[1:45:50] right am I right in the way that I think
[1:45:53] I want to
[1:45:55] know you don't question him because you
[1:45:57] want to break the rules you don't
[1:45:59] question him because you want to sin you
[1:46:01] question him because you want to be
[1:46:05] right but God can't come into your
[1:46:09] world you need to come into His
[1:46:13] World that's the truth brother
[1:46:20] Josiah I know the time is near where
[1:46:25] everything that I hold dear will lay

[1:49:47] [Music]
[1:49:49] me I can see why Lord let me be a John
[1:49:54] the Baptist I can see why he was so
[1:49:57] special in God's
[1:50:00] mind and he
[1:50:02] said when those two Messengers came
[1:50:06] back can you
[1:50:09] imagine how he
[1:50:12] felt when they said brother
[1:50:16] John the man
[1:50:18] that that was on the river that day that
[1:50:21] you said Behold the Lamb of God God that
[1:50:23] takes away the sins of the world that
[1:50:25] man he said to come back and tell
[1:50:29] you things that we
[1:50:32] saw he said to tell you that the sick
[1:50:35] were
[1:50:37] healed he said to tell you that the
[1:50:39] blind were given their sight he said to
[1:50:42] tell you that the that the the poor had
[1:50:44] the gospel preached to
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:48] them Imagine
[1:50:51] John how was
[1:50:53] right I was right can you imagine how he
[1:50:58] felt in that
[1:51:01] song wasn't too long after
[1:51:04] that that they cut his head off because
[1:51:08] of his
[1:51:10] testimony can you imagine how he felt
[1:51:12] when he went
[1:51:13] up and he heard those words that Josiah
[1:51:16] just said well
[1:51:18] done a good and faithful one
[1:51:23] brothers and sisters if we could just
[1:51:25] surrender ourselves and not try to get
[1:51:27] our way in
[1:51:30] life if we can just search the Lord say
[1:51:33] Lord I'm willing to give up
[1:51:35] anything I don't
[1:51:38] care that's how I feel feel like
[1:51:42] Lord I'll preach
[1:51:44] whatever if it disagrees with something
[1:51:47] that I've said before Lord I'll preach
[1:51:50] what you lay on my heart
[1:51:55] for all all of us
[1:51:58] here there's a reason it says that you
[1:52:01] will work out your own salvation through
[1:52:02] fear and
[1:52:04] [Music]
[1:52:05] trembling not that you're going to rely
[1:52:07] on the
[1:52:09] pastor I'm like that Clay Pot constantly
[1:52:14] having to get
[1:52:16] rebuilt it's not that you're going to
[1:52:17] rely on any Prophet or anybody else
[1:52:20] you're going to rely on the one that did
[1:52:22] save save you you're going to rely on
[1:52:24] the perfect Lamb of
[1:52:28] God but you have to talk to
[1:52:31] him you have to know what he says and
[1:52:34] you have to be willing to forsake
[1:52:37] everything you have to be willing to say
[1:52:40] you know what I was wrong about this I
[1:52:43] was wrong about
[1:52:47] that you're not greater than John the
[1:52:50] Baptist and he did it
[1:52:52] and then it came right back around said
[1:52:54] no you were
[1:52:56] right but because you surrendered your
[1:52:59] life because you were willing to follow
