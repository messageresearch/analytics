[3:22] good Sunday this morning. Amen. I think
[3:26] brother Ed has some announcements to
[3:28] make for the church. You may be seated.
[3:29] Let's just sing that one more time. In
[3:31] the city where the land is
[3:36] alive and in the city
[3:39] where the
[3:41] night and
[3:43] [Music]
[3:48] I am going where the land is
[3:54] alive. Good morning. God bless you. We
[3:56] got just a couple announcements. Uh
[3:58] church business to take care of. Uh like
[4:01] to bring it before you folks. First of
[4:04] all,
[4:05] um, as you probably have heard or seen
[4:10] on the WhatsApp, uh, we have painted the
[4:12] curb out here on the north side of the
[4:14] church. We've had, uh, some brother or
[4:17] sisters come in and and a brother
[4:20] wheelchair
[4:22] um, bound right now. And we'd like to
[4:24] keep that space
[4:26] open for those that have to come unload
[4:29] somebody that's in a wheelchair or for
[4:30] the hand sun van or anybody uh that's
[4:34] being transported by a handicap vehicle.
[4:37] So what that means is that you can
[4:40] unload and then you'll need to find
[4:43] another parking space. But we do need to
[4:45] keep that clear. Our sister Mary is not
[4:48] able to come to church because it's been
[4:50] blocked and they won't bring her until
[4:51] it's opened up. So, that's the first uh
[4:54] announcement. Second announcement, as
[4:56] you can see behind me, that the wood has
[4:58] been taken down off the back
[5:01] wall. It's we're in the process of
[5:05] redoing the stage area. So, please be
[5:07] patient with us. Um I thank the brothers
[5:11] that have worked so diligently getting
[5:13] this taken down and uh and getting it
[5:16] dressed up for you folks. Uh and then
[5:19] thirdly, next Sunday we will have a
[5:22] potluck after service. So come prepared
[5:25] to get some good food and some good
[5:26] fellowship. So Lord bless you. And I'll
[5:29] turn it back over to brother Daniel Jr.

[15:51] life. And I see promises in
[15:56] fulfillment all over my life.
[16:01] all over my
[16:04] life. If the brothers would make way for
[16:07] the prayer request and offering. Let's
[16:08] just sing that one more
[16:10] time. I see the evidence of your
[16:16] goodness all over my
[16:19] life and all over my
[16:22] [Music]
[16:25] life. And I see your promises in
[16:31] fulfillment all over my
[16:35] life. All over my
[16:39] [Music]
[16:47] life. Good morning. God bless you
[16:49] all. The greatest blessing you could
[16:52] have is a blessing from God.
[16:54] We look at things and we say, "I wish I
[16:57] could have this. I'd love to have that."
[16:59] But that the King of Kings would call
[17:01] you by name because he knows who you
[17:03] are. There's no greater blessing than
[17:05] that. Have a couple of a praise and a
[17:08] request
[17:09] this
[17:11] today. Sister Amelia is asking to
[17:14] remember her daughter
[17:16] uh not feeling well today. Just keep her
[17:19] in prayer. And also she says, "I want to
[17:24] I went to my orthopedic appointment last
[17:26] week and the doctor with a doctor and
[17:28] said I didn't need the knee replacement
[17:31] and gave me a cortisone shot but before
[17:34] she injected I prayed for it. Thank you
[17:38] all for your prayers. I love you
[17:40] all. You know you go expecting something
[17:43] or kind of maybe worried about something
[17:46] but God has it all in control already.
[17:49] There's nothing that surprises him. He
[17:51] doesn't have to run off and say, "I need
[17:52] to figure this out." But he's already
[17:54] made a way. So if you have a need, you
[17:56] want to raise your hand. When you raise
[17:58] your hand, that's by faith. Lord, you
[18:01] know, and you know exactly what I have
[18:04] need of. I might lay my petition out
[18:06] this way, but Lord, you know exactly
[18:08] what I have needed. Lord, there's many
[18:10] hands
[18:11] raised, but when you cried out, "It is
[18:14] finished." They're hanging on the cross
[18:17] for us. Lord, you were beaten. You were
[18:20] bruised. You were
[18:22] broken. You were you were left beyond
[18:24] recognition. Could not even tell that
[18:26] that was a man hanging on the
[18:29] cross. But Lord, everything was covered
[18:31] and everything was paid
[18:33] for, Lord. And it
[18:36] pleased you were pleased to do this,
[18:38] Lord. You said you would lay your down
[18:41] your life down and you would take it
[18:42] back up, Lord. So we thank you for your
[18:45] grace, your mercy, and your goodness,
[18:47] Lord. And even as we've gathered this
[18:50] morning and as our brother Dan would be
[18:53] preparing to minister this morning,
[18:55] Lord, may he set himself out of the way.
[18:57] May we all set ourselves out of the way
[18:59] and let you minister to us, Lord. And as
[19:02] the brothers take up the offering, Lord,
[19:04] may we give with a cheerful heart, Lord.
[19:06] And may you may it be put to the use
[19:08] that you intended for, Lord. We thank
[19:11] you for all things in Jesus Christ's
[19:13] name. Amen.
[19:18] [Music]
[19:23] Amen. Aren't you just thankful for the
[19:25] Lord this morning? He's been so good to
[19:27] all of us. I

[30:53] beautiful. believe um in the back I
[30:56] believe you had Colossians chapter 1 up
[31:00] before service. Can we turn in our
[31:02] Bibles to Colossians chapter
[31:05] 1? Let's
[31:07] start with verse
[31:09] [Music]
[31:15] 15. Not a sweet
[31:17] spirit in the church
[31:20] today.
[31:23] And it's a nice spirit to read the word
[31:26] as we're standing.
[31:30] Speaking of the Lord Jesus, the Apostle
[31:33] Paul says this, who is the image of the
[31:37] invisible God, the firstborn of every
[31:40] creature. For by him were all things
[31:43] created that are in heaven and that are
[31:46] in
[31:46] earth, visible and
[31:49] invisible, whether they be thrones or
[31:51] dominions or principalities or powers.
[31:55] All things were created by him and for
[31:58] him.
[31:59] And he is before all things. And by him
[32:02] all things consist.
[32:05] And he is the head of the body, the
[32:09] church, who is the beginning, the
[32:13] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[32:16] things he might have the preeminence.
[32:19] For it pleased the father that in him
[32:23] should all fullness dwell. How about
[32:26] that song one more time? The one.
[32:30] My chains are
[32:33] gone. I've been set
[32:37] free. My God, my
[32:42] Savior has ransomed me.
[32:47] And like a
[32:50] flood, his mercy
[32:54] reigns. Unending
[32:58] love, amazing grace.
[33:02] Our father, we thank
[33:05] you, Lord. We thank you for bringing us
[33:07] here this morning. And we ask, Father,
[33:10] your presence would be with us. And
[33:13] Lord, show us once again your amazing
[33:16] grace. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. You
[33:20] can be seated. God bless you
[33:26] all. First, I want to welcome our
[33:30] visitors. Josh, Anna, Bertha, and
[33:33] family. Welcome. God bless you. It's
[33:35] good to have you visitors
[33:41] here.
[33:42] Angelina, Kaylee, and Don. Don was here,
[33:46] he'd probably be back. And God bless you
[33:49] and family. Welcome. We appreciate
[33:52] you. If I've missed any other visitors,
[33:54] you're welcome. We're glad to have you.
[33:59] I pray that all of us that when we leave
[34:02] here
[34:03] today that something would have been
[34:07] said
[34:09] that will put a a a fire in our hearts
[34:12] to get closer to God, to search God out.
[34:17] And you may think that, well, I have a
[34:19] relationship with God. But even the man
[34:21] that wrote the words that I just that I
[34:24] just read, the Apostle Paul, who I
[34:26] believe had the greatest revelation in
[34:29] all the Bible of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[34:31] even he said, "I have not yet attained
[34:36] it." There was a desire that that was in
[34:38] the Apostle Paul to get closer to God
[34:42] all the time. And I pray that as as you
[34:45] leave today that that desire will be
[34:47] strong in your heart, Lord. I need a
[34:51] closer walk with you. I want to be with
[34:54] you, Lord. I want to know you better.
[34:56] Those words that I just read that this
[34:59] Jesus Christ is the very image of God
[35:02] himself and how we should always our
[35:04] whole lives should be dedicated just to
[35:07] knowing this man, Jesus Christ. A little
[35:10] bit better. And if reading his word
[35:12] today, we're going to go through this
[35:14] book of Colossians. We'll start today.
[35:16] We'll see how far we get and we'll just
[35:19] continue on if the Lord's willing over
[35:21] the next few weeks and going through the
[35:24] book
[35:25] and just take it for what it is in
[35:29] reading this this Bible. It is beautiful
[35:33] and I think that it'll speak to every
[35:35] one of us. And let's have a heart that
[35:37] is open for the reading of the word and
[35:40] the revelation of the word. This book of
[35:44] Colossians written by the Apostle
[35:47] Paul and he's writing
[35:51] this letter from prison. So Paul's in
[35:54] prison probably in Rome and he's writing
[35:57] this to these believers that are in
[36:00] Colossia and he's never met them. He's
[36:04] just received word of who these people
[36:06] are and and he's he's writing them to
[36:10] encourage them and this man Epaparus
[36:13] must have visited the Apostle Paul and
[36:15] told them that about this congregation
[36:18] that's forming over here in Colossia and
[36:21] wanting maybe Paul's wisdom and wanting
[36:23] maybe Paul's prayer and he pins this
[36:25] letter and he he writes it and he says
[36:28] here go and read this to these people
[36:31] and I wonder If Paul, Paul, Peter,
[36:36] James, John, I wonder if these brothers
[36:39] when they were writing these letters
[36:41] that now make up the New Testament of
[36:43] the Bible, I wonder if they
[36:46] knew the farreaching effect that their
[36:49] letters were going to have. I wonder if
[36:51] they knew that 2,000 years later, we
[36:53] would be gathered together in downtown
[36:58] Tucson. The It was originally written in
[37:01] Greek. it's been translated into English
[37:03] and we would be preaching on these words
[37:06] that were written in that letter. I
[37:09] wonder if they thought about that when
[37:11] when I wonder if the Apostle Paul as he
[37:13] was pinning this I wonder if he thought
[37:15] that this is going to be translated.
[37:16] This is going to go around the world.
[37:18] This is going to be the very foundation
[37:19] of Christianity.
[37:21] this new work that was going on. It is
[37:25] uh written in 64
[37:27] AD which is
[37:31] maybe 30 years or so. 20 between 20 and
[37:35] 30 years after Jesus Christ had died on
[37:38] the cross and the and the apostles
[37:41] started preaching these doctrines of
[37:43] Christ and going out and telling the
[37:44] people the Messiah had come. And back
[37:46] then it was a really small the world
[37:48] actually was very very big. They they
[37:51] didn't have social media like we have.
[37:54] They they couldn't write a text to
[37:56] somebody on the other side of the world
[37:58] or on the other side of the city. They
[38:00] they couldn't they couldn't get on
[38:03] television and see what's going on. They
[38:05] they didn't even have newspapers back
[38:07] then.
[38:08] The news traveled very
[38:11] slow and it was these
[38:14] letters that went out and then they
[38:17] would copy them and then send them out.
[38:21] And it was these letters that told
[38:23] everyone here is who this man Jesus
[38:26] Christ was. I wonder if these brothers
[38:30] knew
[38:31] how important these letters were when
[38:33] they wrote them.
[38:35] I think sometimes I think they do
[38:36] because Paul said, "Read this also to
[38:38] the church at
[38:39] Leodysa." And then other times I think
[38:41] that there's no way that they could have
[38:43] ever imagined. And I'm going to talk
[38:45] about a little bit later I'll talk about
[38:47] another man that probably had no
[38:49] idea something that he did and how
[38:53] farreaching his ministry would be even
[38:55] to
[38:56] today. So this letter to these people of
[39:00] Colossia again, Paul never met them,
[39:03] right? He was encouraging them and he
[39:06] writes these words and let's let's turn
[39:09] let's let's start with verse one and
[39:12] we'll hopefully we'll get through
[39:14] chapter one and maybe we'll get into
[39:16] chapter two but we'll see how far we
[39:18] get. Listen to this. Paul, an apostle of
[39:23] Jesus Christ by the will of God. Now he
[39:25] says later on that he wrote this with
[39:27] his his own hand. So he didn't dictate
[39:30] it to someone else. This was something
[39:32] that he sat in his study maybe under the
[39:34] the light of a lamp and wrote this
[39:37] out. Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[39:40] the will of God and Timoththeus our
[39:42] brother to the saints and faithful
[39:44] brethren in Christ which are at Colasse.
[39:47] Grace be unto you and peace from God our
[39:50] father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[39:53] give thanks to God and the father of our
[39:56] Lord Jesus Christ praying always for you
[39:59] since we heard of your faith in Christ
[40:02] Jesus and the love which you have to all
[40:06] the saints and the love which you have
[40:08] to all the
[40:10] saints. So he says that we're thankful
[40:14] to see that you have accepted this Jesus
[40:17] Christ and that that you have received
[40:19] this faith and that you know who he is.
[40:21] But equally with that, he said, "And the
[40:25] love that you have for all the saints."
[40:28] So I don't believe that you can have
[40:29] Jesus Christ. I don't believe that you
[40:31] can be a Christian and not have love,
[40:34] pure love one for another. Right here,
[40:37] the apostle puts them right next to each
[40:39] other. The most famous scripture in the
[40:42] world, the one that that is quoted more
[40:45] than any other says, "For God so loved
[40:47] the world that he gave his only begotten
[40:50] son." It is all about love. This man
[40:54] Jesus Christ, he was the personification
[40:56] of
[40:57] love. For the hope, I'll read number
[41:01] four again. Since we heard of your faith
[41:03] in Christ Jesus, and the love which you
[41:05] have to all the saints, for the hope
[41:07] which is laid up for you in heaven,
[41:10] whereof you have heard before in the
[41:13] word of the truth of the gospel, which
[41:17] is come unto
[41:18] you, as it is in all the
[41:21] world, and bringeth forth fruit, as it
[41:25] doth also in you, since the day you
[41:30] heard of it and knew the grace of God in
[41:34] truth. This is the amazing thing about
[41:37] Christianity. It hasn't changed. Paul
[41:40] wrote this say, as I said before, about
[41:42] 30 years after the apostles started
[41:46] going going out and preaching this and
[41:49] we look today and we're doing the same
[41:51] thing as they were back then. It was
[41:53] spreading back then and it's still
[41:55] spreading today. And you wonder, well,
[41:57] where's it spreading? It's not like it
[41:59] was that no one has heard of Jesus
[42:01] Christ like they did 2,000 years ago.
[42:04] But they may not know who this Jesus
[42:06] Christ really is. Everybody's heard of
[42:09] him, but you may not know what Christ
[42:12] really represents. And we see that
[42:15] apostolic age. We see that spirit of the
[42:18] apostles and it's on parents teaching
[42:21] their children.
[42:23] It's it's in each church and and if if
[42:26] they are lifting up Christ that same
[42:29] spirit that these apostles have is right
[42:32] here and what is it? It is focusing on
[42:35] one thing and that is the man Christ
[42:37] Jesus. That is the apostolic
[42:40] spirit. One day soon, it's been 2,000
[42:43] years. One day soon that that spirit is
[42:45] going to go back to the originators of
[42:48] this word, the ones that wrote this
[42:49] word, which which are the Jewish people.
[42:52] It's going to go back to them. Paul was
[42:54] a Jew. Peter was a Jew. John was a Jew.
[42:58] And they took this word and they freely
[43:02] gave it to us, the Gentile people. One
[43:06] day soon it's going to go to those same
[43:09] that same lineage that it went from. The
[43:12] New Living Translation of that of that
[43:16] verse is really beautiful. It says this
[43:19] in verse number
[43:20] six. The same good
[43:23] news that came to you is going out all
[43:26] over the world. But it is bearing fruit
[43:28] everywhere by changing
[43:30] lives just as it changed your lives from
[43:34] the day that you first heard and
[43:36] understood the truth about God's
[43:39] wonderful grace. So tell me that's not
[43:42] today. That is the same spirit today as
[43:45] it was 2,000 years ago. It's going out
[43:47] and it's changing lives. I want to tell
[43:50] a story about a man that you may may or
[43:53] may not have heard of. His name is John.
[43:56] back in the
[43:58] mid700s. He was a very sinful young man
[44:03] and he had chance after chance to serve
[44:05] God and he
[44:06] always stuck his hand in God's face and
[44:09] said, "I I really I don't want you." He
[44:12] was raised by a stepmother who really
[44:14] didn't care a whole lot about him. He uh
[44:17] was sent to boarding school where he was
[44:18] mistreated and beaten in the boarding
[44:20] school. And it it really he had just a
[44:24] the kid was probably easy to beat
[44:26] because he had a real headstrong way
[44:28] about him. And he he probably really
[44:30] upset the teachers and he didn't he
[44:33] didn't care about the rules. He didn't
[44:35] respect anybody. He was about one thing
[44:38] and that was serving himself. This young
[44:40] man
[44:42] John, he uh and he really just cared
[44:46] about indulging in anything that made
[44:48] him feel good. Didn't care about anybody
[44:50] else. He was raised he was kind of a
[44:53] Christian in the Anglican church. His
[44:56] his stepmother was and then his dad was
[44:58] kind of a Catholic but didn't really
[45:00] there was no real religion real strong
[45:02] religion in the home. Um his dad was a
[45:05] sailor who went on various
[45:08] ships and as young John grew
[45:13] up. There were many things that happened
[45:16] to
[45:17] him where he would face
[45:20] death and then he would get out of it
[45:24] and the Lord would lay it on his heart,
[45:27] you need to consider me. Wow. And he
[45:30] never
[45:31] would. He was um he was he he went uh he
[45:35] went around and and sailed with his dad
[45:38] for a while. Then he he got other jobs.
[45:40] He he he was always just a really
[45:42] belligerent foul-mouthed young man and
[45:47] he
[45:47] um
[45:49] he got a job on on a on a ship. He ended
[45:53] up not showing up. Then uh they he got
[45:56] pushed into the Navy. He went into the
[45:58] Navy. He met a girl and he says, "You
[46:00] know what? I don't want to be in the
[46:01] Navy anymore. So, so he deserted from
[46:03] the Navy and he he went to be with this
[46:05] girl. So, he got in all kinds of
[46:07] trouble. And back then, you didn't just
[46:10] live off of the government. If you
[46:11] didn't have a job, you had to have a
[46:13] job. So, they they took him and he was a
[46:16] disgraced young man and they put him on
[46:19] slave
[46:21] ships trading slaves.
[46:24] And the young man was so
[46:28] belligerent that even the sailors said,
[46:32] "This guy's got a foul mouth."
[46:36] He would he had a gift in his life. As I
[46:41] said, he was he was forced because of
[46:42] his disobedience, he was forced to join
[46:44] the Navy. He met a girl. He ends up he
[46:47] ends up deserting the Navy. And he he
[46:51] started getting in more and more
[46:53] trouble. He puts um he gets on this
[46:57] slave ship and he had a gift in his life
[47:00] of being able to put words together and
[47:04] like
[47:05] poems. And he started writing
[47:07] poems about the captain of his ship,
[47:11] dirty poems, dirty
[47:14] words. And he got the crew and they
[47:17] would start singing these nasty songs
[47:21] about the captain of the ship. How do
[47:23] you think that went for
[47:25] him? Even the people, even the crew that
[47:29] was on the ship were like, "This guy is
[47:31] going too
[47:33] far in his nasty language and and and
[47:37] making fun of the captain." So, what
[47:39] happened is the captain takes him and he
[47:41] puts him in
[47:43] chains and he puts him in prison on the
[47:46] ship. And they get to the slaveport and
[47:50] he pulls him out and he says, "Here,
[47:53] take this
[47:55] guy."
[47:57] And then this young man
[48:00] John, he goes to
[48:02] work for these African slave traders and
[48:06] he becomes a slave.
[48:10] And later
[48:13] on he he writes that during that time he
[48:17] says, "I was once an infidel and a
[48:20] libertine, a servant of slaves in West
[48:25] Africa." He wrote a letter. He's able to
[48:27] get a letter out to his dad. His dad was
[48:29] able to help him escape and he went back
[48:32] into the slave trade. And three years
[48:36] later, again, he kept he kept on with
[48:39] his his belligerent ways and he kept on
[48:41] with his with his
[48:44] just nasty language.
[48:47] And three years
[48:50] later, he's on his way back to
[48:55] England and a big storm comes up and the
[49:00] ship starts taking on water and the ship
[49:04] starts to sink and he's walking along
[49:07] the edge of the ship and and the waves
[49:10] are coming in and he he looks back just
[49:12] where he had walked and the big wave
[49:15] comes and hits and the person that was
[49:17] standing right where he was standing
[49:18] gets swept out to sea and
[49:22] dies. He looks at that and he cries out
[49:25] to
[49:26] God and he says,
[49:29] "Lord, have mercy."
[49:31] And
[49:33] then
[49:35] the storm started to
[49:38] calm and he gets back to
[49:41] port in uh in
[49:44] England
[49:46] and he says, you know, he says, "I need
[49:49] to start being more serious about this."
[49:53] And what had happened, let me go back
[49:54] for a moment. what had happened, what
[49:56] really put John over the edge before is
[49:59] he
[50:00] always he always thought, well, there is
[50:02] a God and and and he he does take care
[50:04] of me and all of these things happen to
[50:06] me. But there was a a friend of his, a
[50:08] sailor that gave him a book. And in this
[50:11] book, it said that you just have to be a
[50:14] good person. And all of these different
[50:17] religions, they are not worth anything.
[50:20] And this Christianity isn't it isn't
[50:22] that important as long as you're a moral
[50:24] person. And from that time, John set
[50:28] aside any Christianity that he had ever
[50:30] learned and he followed his own way of
[50:33] thinking and he followed his own sinful
[50:36] desires. It was that time and it may be
[50:38] a website today that we we look and we
[50:42] say, "Okay, well, it's not that
[50:43] important as long as you're a good
[50:45] person, as long as you don't hurt
[50:47] anybody." That's not true, friends. The
[50:51] very foundation of Christianity, it is
[50:54] exclusive. Jesus Christ himself, the one
[50:56] that we put up as God, the one I was
[50:58] just reading about said, "I am the way,
[51:00] the truth, and the life, and no man can
[51:02] come to the father except by me."
[51:05] Christianity is the only way. And you
[51:08] say, "Well, what about these other
[51:09] people? What about the Hindus? And what
[51:10] about the the Buddhists? And what about
[51:12] the Muslims?" It's
[51:16] wrong. And I'm not condemning them, but
[51:19] the word condemns it. That's right. And
[51:22] says you must have this Jesus Christ. He
[51:26] is, as I was reading in Colossians, he's
[51:28] God.
[51:30] And if you don't have him, you can't
[51:33] come. You can't be there. And when he
[51:36] had read that, when he had read this
[51:38] book, he all of his mor any morality
[51:41] that he had just went
[51:43] away. And he was worse than he had ever
[51:46] been. And then that storm hits. He
[51:48] almost dies. And he spends these days on
[51:52] on the sea where the the the ship is
[51:55] sinking and the storm lifts and it wakes
[51:57] him up and turns his his mind once again
[52:01] back to this man named Jesus.
[52:04] And he
[52:05] starts the thing that we should all do.
[52:09] He starts reading this
[52:12] Bible. He starts studying the word. and
[52:16] he starts
[52:17] seeing his errors and he starts seeing
[52:21] the truth in the Bible and time goes on
[52:23] and he stayed on the slave ship but as
[52:25] on the slave ships but as he was reading
[52:27] the Bible he starts to get promoted he
[52:29] starts to do better in life he starts to
[52:31] be more honest so he's he starts to be
[52:34] more successful so he's he's he's
[52:36] promoted to first mate and then after
[52:38] time goes on then he's he gets his own
[52:41] ship and he's the captain and he starts
[52:43] seeing as he's reading the Bible he
[52:44] starts seeing this slave slavery thing
[52:46] is
[52:46] wrong. And he sees these men that are
[52:49] being sold and he says, "This is this is
[52:52] wrong to do
[52:54] this." And it it hurt him. But he still
[52:57] continued to do it. And he would do
[53:00] well, he backslide. Do well, he'd
[53:04] backslide. And he never left the slave
[53:07] trade. So what happened? He had a
[53:10] stroke and he couldn't sail anymore.
[53:14] So he went back to his
[53:16] home and he loved this word and more and
[53:20] more and he started preaching this word
[53:24] and he he started expounding on it and
[53:27] saying that this slave trading and he
[53:29] started his life started to be devoted
[53:31] to to condemning slavery because he saw
[53:35] that in this word it it strictly
[53:37] condemns it about beating a fellow man
[53:42] or doing doing what they were
[53:44] doing and he saw how filthy that he used
[53:48] to
[53:49] be. And we should all friends we can
[53:52] look back at what we used to be and we
[53:54] can all have this man John's testimony
[53:57] saying I was a sinner. I was wrong and
[54:00] now I am different. As Paul said, I
[54:02] haven't attained it yet, but I'm going
[54:04] in the right direction. I'm not going
[54:06] back there.
[54:08] And the more he preached, the the better
[54:12] that he the more he wanted to understand
[54:14] God's word, the more he
[54:16] read. And for pretty soon, no more
[54:19] investing in the slave trade. No, no
[54:21] more of that. Now, he he started
[54:24] ministering full-time and and singing
[54:26] and and he took his gift that he had of
[54:30] writing these poems. Before they were
[54:33] filth and belligerent and profane and
[54:38] now they were talking about God and he
[54:41] was preparing for his New Year's Day
[54:44] service and he was he went to he wanted
[54:48] to preach on 1 Chronicles chapter
[54:53] 17 and it was in his heart Lord I have
[54:57] come back from all I was the worst of
[55:00] the worst.
[55:02] And he read this in 1 Chronicles 17:1
[55:06] 16. And this was the
[55:09] inspiration for his sermon that New
[55:12] Year's Day. And David the
[55:15] king came and sat before the Lord and
[55:19] said, "Who am I, oh Lord God, and what
[55:24] is mine house that thou hast brought me
[55:26] hither to?" It's neat that we read in
[55:29] the King James version, the Old English,
[55:31] because this is what he
[55:34] read. And yet this was a small thing in
[55:37] thine eyes, oh God, for thou hast also
[55:40] spoken of thy servants's house for for a
[55:43] great while to come and hast regarded me
[55:46] according to the estate of a man of high
[55:48] degree, oh Lord God. David saying, Lord,
[55:51] I am nothing. I've come I've come for
[55:53] nothing and and now you've made this
[55:56] great man out of me and here is this man
[55:58] John and he's ministering before a
[56:01] church maybe of this size or smaller who
[56:05] knows and
[56:08] then John
[56:10] Newton recited the poem that God had
[56:12] given him in in preparation for this
[56:15] sermon a few days
[56:18] before and it reads like this. Amazing
[56:22] grace, how sweet the sound that saved a
[56:26] wretch like me. I once I once was lost,
[56:30] but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I
[56:33] see. It was grace that taught my heart
[56:36] to fear. And grace my fears relieved.
[56:38] How precious did that grace appear the
[56:40] hour I first
[56:42] believed. Through many dangers, toils,
[56:45] and snares I have already come. His
[56:48] grace hath brought me safe thus far. and
[56:51] grace will lead me home. The Lord has
[56:54] promised good to me. His word my hope
[56:58] secures. He will my shield and portion
[57:01] be as long as life endures.
[57:04] Yay. When this flesh and heart shall
[57:07] fail, and mortar life shall cease, I
[57:10] shall possess within the veil a life of
[57:13] joy and
[57:14] peace. The earth shall soon dissolve
[57:18] like snow.
[57:19] The sun for bear to
[57:22] shine. But God who called me here below
[57:26] will be forever
[57:28] mine. When we've been there 10,000
[57:31] years, bright shining as the sun, we've
[57:34] no less days to sing God's praise than
[57:37] when we'd first
[57:39] begun. I wonder if John Newton when he
[57:43] wrote those words, Amazing Grace, and he
[57:46] wrote that song. I wonder like the
[57:48] Apostle Paul in this book of Colossians.
[57:51] I wonder if he would have ever known
[57:53] that that song would be sung in
[57:56] congregations around the world.
[58:00] the song Amazing
[58:01] Grace. I don't think that he knew it,
[58:05] but it was the inspiration of Jesus
[58:07] Christ on that man and seeing where he
[58:10] came from and the wretch that he was
[58:14] and how he took this man just like he
[58:17] did King David and made him a great man.
[58:21] I don't think there's anyone in this
[58:24] room that has done as bad as John
[58:27] Newton. And if he can turn John Newton's
[58:31] life around, then most surely he can
[58:34] turn around any of our lives.
[58:39] Let's go back to Colossians.
[58:43] He's speaking of this man. Paul's
[58:46] speaking of this man that he just
[58:48] met. as ye also learned of Apaffris, our
[58:52] dear fellow servant, who is for you a
[58:54] faithful minister of Christ, who hath
[58:57] declared unto us your love in the
[58:59] spirit. For this cause we also since the
[59:02] day that we heard it do not cease to
[59:04] pray for you and and and to desire that
[59:07] you might be filled with the knowledge
[59:09] of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
[59:13] understanding that ye might walk worthy
[59:15] of the Lord unto all pleasing being
[59:18] fruitful in every good work and
[59:21] increasing in the knowledge of God. John
[59:24] Newton's
[59:25] change came when the fear was set in him
[59:29] on that on that storm and he was going
[59:32] to die and he cried out to go to God and
[59:35] God heard him and what did he do? He
[59:37] began to increase in the knowledge of
[59:39] God by reading the Bible. Amen. And
[59:42] here's what the apostle is saying. He's
[59:44] saying that you should increase not just
[59:47] in the spirit but in the knowledge of
[59:49] God. And how do you increase in the
[59:50] knowledge of God? You study God through
[59:54] his writings, through his
[59:57] word, strengthening with all might
[1:00:00] according to his glorious power unto all
[1:00:02] patience and longsuffering with
[1:00:04] joyfulness, giving thanks unto the
[1:00:06] Father, which hath made us meat to be
[1:00:09] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:00:10] saints of light in light. Most
[1:00:13] translations say, "Which has qualified
[1:00:16] us to be partakers of the inheritance of
[1:00:19] the saints in
[1:00:21] light, who hath delivered us from the
[1:00:23] power of darkness, and hath translated
[1:00:25] us into the kingdom of his dear son, in
[1:00:28] whom we have redemption through his
[1:00:29] blood, even the forgiveness of
[1:00:35] sins. Who is the image of the invisible,
[1:00:38] the
[1:00:38] firstborn?" Hold on a second. Thanks,
[1:00:42] brothers.
[1:00:49] Brothers, let me tell you. Brothers and
[1:00:50] sisters, let me tell you. Every
[1:00:54] person on the face of this earth
[1:00:57] has a soul.
[1:01:00] This man here, even though he's
[1:01:02] disturbing service, I do believe God
[1:01:05] loves him. And I believe that that he is
[1:01:10] somebody he he's got a soul. He may not
[1:01:12] be right in mind, but God loves that
[1:01:15] man.
[1:01:18] Father, with the same spirit, Lord, of
[1:01:21] those that reached out to the sinful
[1:01:25] people, Father, we pray that your hand
[1:01:28] would be upon this man that had just
[1:01:30] come in. And Father, you'd deliver him
[1:01:33] from the demons that are tormenting his
[1:01:35] mind. And Father, that you would have
[1:01:37] mercy on him. for any of us Lord could
[1:01:40] be in that same situation but father you
[1:01:43] had mercy on us and may you have mercy
[1:01:46] on him in Jesus name we pray
[1:01:51] amen friends we're nothing none of us
[1:01:55] are anything and any of us could be
[1:01:57] found if God just takes his hand off of
[1:02:00] us for a moment we will slip back
[1:02:04] and I thank God that he's had mercy on
[1:02:07] us. Where was
[1:02:09] I? Uh
[1:02:12] verse number
[1:02:16] 10. That's why we're here. That's why we
[1:02:18] preach the Bible.
[1:02:21] It's not the Jesus said that this the
[1:02:24] the well people, they don't need a
[1:02:26] doctor. It's the sick people that need a
[1:02:29] doctor. And this man, John Newton, was
[1:02:33] sick. He had major issues. And God
[1:02:36] stepped on the scene through a storm and
[1:02:39] gave him his word and it changed his
[1:02:42] life around. And it could change that
[1:02:43] man's life around, too.
[1:02:48] that you might walk worthy of the Lord
[1:02:51] unto all pleasing, being fruitful in
[1:02:53] every good work, and increasing in the
[1:02:56] knowledge of
[1:02:59] God, strengthening, strengthened with
[1:03:02] all might according to his glorious
[1:03:04] power, unto all patience, and
[1:03:05] longsuffering, with joyfulness, giving
[1:03:07] thanks unto the Father, which hath made
[1:03:09] us meat to be partakers of the
[1:03:11] inheritance of the saints of light, who
[1:03:15] hath delivered delivered us from the
[1:03:17] power of darkness and hath translated us
[1:03:20] into the kingdom of his dear son.
[1:03:23] Brother Aaron delivered us from the
[1:03:25] power of darkness. Where have we come
[1:03:29] from? A dark place. But he can reach in
[1:03:33] and pull us out of that dark place and
[1:03:35] bring us into the presence of the Lord
[1:03:37] Jesus and change our
[1:03:40] lives. In whom, this speaking of Jesus,
[1:03:43] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:03:45] blood, even the forgiveness of our
[1:03:48] sins. I believe that's when he walked in
[1:03:50] when I read that. Who is in the image of
[1:03:53] the invisible God, the firstborn of
[1:03:55] every creature. For by him were all
[1:03:58] things created that are in heaven and
[1:04:00] that are in earth and visible and
[1:04:01] invisible, whether they be thrones or
[1:04:04] dominions or principalities or power or
[1:04:06] all things or all things were created by
[1:04:10] him. and for him.
[1:04:13] We don't give Jesus Christ enough time
[1:04:17] in our lives. I don't even think we give
[1:04:20] him enough time in this pullpit.
[1:04:23] He is everything.
[1:04:26] He can change any life. He's changed
[1:04:28] mine. He's changed yours. And he's still
[1:04:31] working on me.
[1:04:34] There's a song. Where's Josiah? one of
[1:04:37] those one of the songs that you sing um
[1:04:39] I think quotes that that verse right
[1:04:42] there that
[1:04:44] uh for by him all things created. I
[1:04:48] think that's one of the songs that you
[1:04:49] usually sing. It's it's just beautiful.
[1:04:52] And he is before all things and by him
[1:04:55] all things consist. And he is the head
[1:04:57] of the body, the church who is the
[1:04:59] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[1:05:02] that in all things he might have
[1:05:04] preeminence in all things. As I said,
[1:05:07] that means Buddhism, that means
[1:05:08] Hinduism, that means Mormonism, that
[1:05:11] means whatever Jesus Christ is supreme.
[1:05:14] He is sovereign. He is God.
[1:05:19] For it pleased the Father that in him
[1:05:22] should all fullness dwell. What does
[1:05:25] that mean?
[1:05:27] that in him, this man Jesus, all
[1:05:30] fullness
[1:05:32] dwell. To me, it says, I mean, it says
[1:05:37] it says incredible things, but in a
[1:05:39] sense, the Trinity doesn't
[1:05:41] work. I've heard scholars say that the
[1:05:44] Trinity is three independent
[1:05:47] manifestations of God.
[1:05:50] If all the fullness is in this man, this
[1:05:52] one man, Jesus, how can they be
[1:05:55] independent if they're all in one?
[1:05:59] They have to be one. Amen.
[1:06:02] And the father, the son, and the holy
[1:06:04] spirit. If they're independent in each,
[1:06:06] if they're independent of each other,
[1:06:09] then the fullness cannot dwell in the
[1:06:11] son, Jesus Christ. Right. Colossians
[1:06:14] chapter 2 says, "For chapter 2:9
[1:06:17] says,"For in him dwelleth all the
[1:06:20] fullness of the Godhead
[1:06:22] bodily." So all of it dwells in this man
[1:06:27] Christ. We'll get into baptism
[1:06:31] uh in a moment, but that's why it's so
[1:06:34] important to take on the name of Jesus
[1:06:39] Christ rather than titles. When you're
[1:06:42] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:06:44] you are baptized into that name that
[1:06:47] represents the fullness of God. It
[1:06:49] represents all of God. So in effect,
[1:06:52] when you're baptized in the name, when
[1:06:54] you're baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:06:55] Christ, you are baptized in the name of
[1:06:57] the Father and of the Son and of the
[1:06:59] Holy Spirit. You are baptized even more
[1:07:01] than that. Just those three things. You
[1:07:03] are baptized into all of God, every bit
[1:07:06] of God when you are baptized in that
[1:07:09] name.
[1:07:11] And having made peace, verse number 20,
[1:07:14] verse uh chapter one, and having made
[1:07:17] peace through the blood of the cross, by
[1:07:19] him to reconcile all things unto
[1:07:23] himself, by him I say, whether they be
[1:07:27] they be things in earth or things in
[1:07:29] heaven, it's all by
[1:07:31] Christ. And you that were sometime
[1:07:35] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[1:07:40] wicked
[1:07:41] works yet now hath he
[1:07:45] reconciled. English Standard Version
[1:07:47] says, "And you who were once
[1:07:50] alienated and hostile in mind doing evil
[1:07:55] deeds,
[1:07:57] he has now reconciled." Amen.
[1:08:00] Think about this man, John Newton, and
[1:08:03] the life that he lived. Think about this
[1:08:05] man that just walked in. May God may God
[1:08:09] bless him. Think about all of us. And we
[1:08:12] all know we can look at our lives and
[1:08:13] say, "Lord, I'm doing this wrong. I'm
[1:08:14] doing that wrong. I'm doing this evil.
[1:08:16] And I know I shouldn't be doing that."
[1:08:18] And he's saying that whatever it is, he
[1:08:20] has
[1:08:21] reconciled you. Even though you were bad
[1:08:24] and you were a sinner, he has reconciled
[1:08:27] you from your evil deeds. He did it.
[1:08:34] The song Amazing
[1:08:37] Grace. How many of us, that's probably
[1:08:39] everyone here, has worshiped singing
[1:08:42] that song. No matter what church you
[1:08:43] come from, no matter where you've been,
[1:08:46] you've sang Amazing Grace.
[1:08:49] Now you know what it represents. It
[1:08:52] represents he took a sinner man or a
[1:08:56] sinner woman and changed that person
[1:09:01] and you that were sometime alienated and
[1:09:03] enemies in your own mind by wicked
[1:09:05] works. Yet now hath he reconciled in the
[1:09:09] body of his flesh through death to
[1:09:12] present you
[1:09:13] holy and
[1:09:15] unblameable and
[1:09:18] unreprovable in his sight.
[1:09:22] how it's all
[1:09:24] gone. No matter what sin that you've
[1:09:27] done, if there is a desire in your heart
[1:09:29] to see to serve Christ, he comes in and
[1:09:32] he wipes it away and it's gone. It's
[1:09:34] history. And he presents us before the
[1:09:37] father as as pure,
[1:09:40] perfect, no sin at all in us. Thank you,
[1:09:44] Lord. And you who were once alienated,
[1:09:47] hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, he
[1:09:49] has now reconciled in the body of his
[1:09:51] flesh through death to present you holy
[1:09:54] and unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:09:59] sight. But
[1:10:04] wait, we can thank God for what he has
[1:10:06] done in our
[1:10:07] lives, but the next word is
[1:10:11] if. There's an if in
[1:10:14] this. We can't just say, "Oh, well, I'm
[1:10:17] doing well and and I the Lord Jesus has
[1:10:19] forgiven me and and and I can sin all I
[1:10:22] want and and me and the Lord we have
[1:10:24] this relationship." But he says here,
[1:10:26] the apostle says,
[1:10:28] "If
[1:10:29] you continue in the
[1:10:32] faith, grounded and settled, and be not
[1:10:37] moved away from the hope of the gospel,
[1:10:39] which you have heard, and which was
[1:10:41] preached to every creature which is
[1:10:42] under heaven, whereof I, Paul, and may
[1:10:45] have made a minister." So don't be moved
[1:10:49] away from the hope of the gospel. That
[1:10:51] word hope is so beautiful.
[1:10:53] the hope of the gospel. And no matter
[1:10:56] what your life is, no matter if it's an
[1:10:58] addiction, no matter if it's if you're
[1:11:00] struggling with with some sort of a drug
[1:11:03] or it could be pornography or whatever
[1:11:04] it is, Lord, there is hope for me in
[1:11:08] this gospel, in this Jesus Christ. There
[1:11:11] is hope. If there was hope for John
[1:11:12] Newton, then there's hope for me.
[1:11:16] I can change. Never forget about hope.
[1:11:20] Amen. Never forget that there is a
[1:11:24] brighter
[1:11:26] future for you if you can just accept
[1:11:29] this man Christ. And the gospel,
[1:11:32] Jonathan, you and I were talking
[1:11:34] yesterday. The gospel is
[1:11:36] not discouraging.
[1:11:38] The gospel is never discouraging. The
[1:11:41] gospel is encouraging.
[1:11:44] There's there's correction there, but I
[1:11:47] want to be corrected. It feels good to
[1:11:50] make a change in my life. The word of
[1:11:53] God is our advocate.
[1:11:58] It is not our pro our
[1:12:01] persecutor.
[1:12:02] Now who now rejoice in my sufferings for
[1:12:06] you and fill up that which is behind of
[1:12:09] the afflictions of Christ in my flesh
[1:12:11] for his body's sake which is the church.
[1:12:13] Whereof I am made a minister. Paul
[1:12:15] speaking. I am made a minister according
[1:12:17] to the dispensation of God, which is
[1:12:19] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[1:12:22] of God, even the mystery which hath been
[1:12:26] hid from ages and from generations. But
[1:12:31] now is made manifest to his saints.
[1:12:34] Lord, what is
[1:12:36] that? This
[1:12:38] mystery even the mystery which has been
[1:12:40] hidden through the
[1:12:43] ages hidden through the
[1:12:45] generations. What is that min that that
[1:12:48] mystery that's been hidden from the
[1:12:50] garden of
[1:12:51] Eden? What is this mystery this
[1:12:54] mysterious voice that came out of the
[1:12:56] burning bush with Moses that said I am
[1:13:00] that I am and spoke that that spoke to
[1:13:04] Moses and gave his commission. What was
[1:13:07] that? What was that pillar of fire that
[1:13:11] led the children of Israel through the
[1:13:13] wilderness at night and the pillar of
[1:13:15] cloud that led them in the day? What is
[1:13:17] that mystery? What is that shikina of
[1:13:20] glory that came down into the holy of
[1:13:22] holies in the temple in the wilderness
[1:13:24] or in the tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:13:26] and came in Solomon's temple? What is
[1:13:28] that mystery? What is that? What is that
[1:13:32] pillar of fire? What is it? It's been a
[1:13:35] mystery all of these years. And they and
[1:13:38] they they would they would talk about
[1:13:40] Moses and the prophets and they were
[1:13:42] they would wonder, but what is this this
[1:13:45] name? I was talking with the kids last
[1:13:48] night that this name of God they they
[1:13:52] they didn't even write it down in the
[1:13:55] Bible because they can't pronounce
[1:13:58] it. What who is this mysterious God?
[1:14:03] Who is this
[1:14:04] mysterious one that parts the Red Sea
[1:14:06] that does miracles and then other times
[1:14:08] he just lays
[1:14:10] silent? What is this mystery? Who is it?
[1:14:14] And it says right here, it all comes to
[1:14:18] this right here. The entire Old
[1:14:21] Testament, the entire Bible comes to
[1:14:23] this right
[1:14:24] here. Even the mystery which has been
[1:14:28] hid from the ages. Hid hid from the ages
[1:14:31] and from generations. but is now made
[1:14:33] manifest to his saints to whom God would
[1:14:37] make known what is the riches of his
[1:14:39] glory of the of this mystery among the
[1:14:42] Gentiles. Here it
[1:14:44] comes. Which is Christ in you,
[1:14:49] the hope of glory. We talk about a new
[1:14:52] birth. You hear ministers preaching
[1:14:54] about receiving the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:56] Spirit. You pre you hear ministers
[1:14:58] preaching about Christ in you. This is
[1:15:00] the mystery that has been hidden through
[1:15:02] the ages that Jesus died for our sins.
[1:15:06] Rose up on the third day. And now he
[1:15:09] comes and lives in us. The same shikina
[1:15:11] of glory that filled the temple. The
[1:15:13] same pillar of fire that led the
[1:15:15] children of Israel. The same pillar of
[1:15:17] fire that spoke to Moses out of the
[1:15:19] burning bush. That same one, here's the
[1:15:21] mystery, comes and lives in his
[1:15:24] children. Amen.
[1:15:26] What an incredible answer to the mystery
[1:15:30] that the Apostle Paul says here.
[1:15:33] Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:15:36] That's the mystery, brother Dan. It's
[1:15:38] everything
[1:15:40] that this same Jesus
[1:15:42] Christ that was born of a virgin that
[1:15:46] preached this these beautiful
[1:15:49] things that died on the cross for our
[1:15:52] sins that conquered death, hell, and sin
[1:15:55] and the grave. Rose up on the third
[1:15:59] day. And the same one enters into his
[1:16:03] people with what is called the new
[1:16:05] birth. what is called the baptism of the
[1:16:09] Holy
[1:16:10] Spirit whom we preach and we should be
[1:16:14] preaching him and really nothing
[1:16:17] else. Whom we preach warning every man
[1:16:21] and teaching every man in all wisdom
[1:16:24] that we may present every man
[1:16:28] perfect in Jesus
[1:16:30] Christ. None of us are perfect. All of
[1:16:33] us are sinners.
[1:16:35] But we are perfect in him because he
[1:16:38] presents us as the perfection of Jesus
[1:16:42] Christ where unto I also labor striving
[1:16:46] according to his working which workketh
[1:16:48] in the which workketh in me
[1:16:51] mightily. I pray that when I leave this
[1:16:54] world I can say the same thing that Paul
[1:16:56] just said that he worked in me mightily.
[1:17:01] I hope that you want the same thing. The
[1:17:03] Lord worked in me. Thank you, Almighty.
[1:17:06] He had me write a song or he had me sing
[1:17:09] a song or or he had me witness to
[1:17:11] someone or he had me raise a family that
[1:17:14] that love the Lord or he had me preach a
[1:17:18] sermon. I think of this man John Newton.
[1:17:22] How many sermons were preached? How many
[1:17:26] sermons have you heard in your whole
[1:17:27] life? None of them compare to Amazing
[1:17:31] Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a
[1:17:33] wretch like
[1:17:34] me. None of them compare to that because
[1:17:37] that's that's
[1:17:40] worship and whatever our role. And next
[1:17:44] week we'll get into being knit together
[1:17:48] through love in Colossians chapter 2.
[1:17:52] But the the main point in this chapter
[1:17:55] one is this man Jesus Christ is the
[1:18:00] mystery of God
[1:18:02] revealed and then he comes and he lives
[1:18:05] in his people
[1:18:09] in chapter 2 verse 10. I'll read I'll
[1:18:12] read uh read
[1:18:14] this. And you are complete in him. We'll
[1:18:18] get to this next week also.
[1:18:20] And you are complete in
[1:18:22] him which is the head of all
[1:18:24] principality and power. In whom also you
[1:18:27] are circumcised with the circumcision
[1:18:29] made without
[1:18:31] hands in putting off the body of of the
[1:18:34] sins of the flesh by the circumcision of
[1:18:37] Jesus Christ. Chapter two, we're going
[1:18:39] to get to how legalism is
[1:18:41] wrong and how it produces sin. But when
[1:18:46] you truly accept this Holy Spirit into
[1:18:48] your life, that is what deals with you.
[1:18:53] That is the mystery of God dwelling in
[1:18:55] you. And the musicians can come as we
[1:18:57] close. Now listen to this as we moved in
[1:19:00] move into the baptismal service.
[1:19:05] buried with him in
[1:19:08] baptism wherein also you are risen with
[1:19:12] him through the faith of the operation
[1:19:14] of God who has raised him from the
[1:19:17] dead. So when we go to the waters of
[1:19:21] baptism says right here that you are
[1:19:23] buried into the waters symbolizing when
[1:19:27] Jesus went down into the grave and you
[1:19:30] have made a commitment Lord I am going
[1:19:33] to be no more of myself. This person
[1:19:36] that that once was I am going to change.
[1:19:39] There is going to be a new person. As
[1:19:42] Jesus died and rose from the grave he
[1:19:46] was given that glorified body. He was
[1:19:48] giving a he was given a change and now
[1:19:50] we are baptized in honor of that saying
[1:19:53] I want to take on this name of Jesus
[1:19:55] Christ where in all the fullness of God
[1:19:57] dwells I am going to take on that name
[1:20:00] of Jesus Christ in baptism and when I
[1:20:03] come back up it's symbolic of saying I
[1:20:06] am going to be a different person now
[1:20:10] and I'm going to make an effort. I was
[1:20:13] telling a brother
[1:20:15] yesterday that this is something this
[1:20:18] baptism is something that you do for
[1:20:22] God. You know we we get so much from the
[1:20:26] Lord. But when we go to those waters of
[1:20:29] baptism, we are saying Lord I am going
[1:20:33] to do this. There's not much I could
[1:20:34] ever do for you but I am going to take
[1:20:37] on your name. I want to be
[1:20:41] associated with this man named Jesus
[1:20:44] Christ. He is my Lord. He is my savior.
[1:20:47] And now when I get baptized, I am going
[1:20:50] into this water, going into the grave.
[1:20:52] And I am coming up and through faith in
[1:20:55] the operation of God, I am going to be a
[1:20:57] different person by the same God that
[1:21:00] raised up Jesus Christ from the dead.
[1:21:03] another way. You can't have three
[1:21:06] different operations. You can't have
[1:21:09] three individuals working in the same
[1:21:12] God. You can't do that because Jesus
[1:21:14] himself said,
[1:21:15] "I will lay my life down and I
[1:21:20] will raise it back up here again." And
[1:21:22] this says that God raised him back up.
[1:21:25] He is the fullness of God, friends. He
[1:21:28] is everything. He is our all and all.
[1:21:31] It's all about the Lord Jesus. And he is
[1:21:34] love and he gives us
[1:21:37] hope. And if you're struggling with
[1:21:39] something today, I promise you, I
[1:21:41] promise you in the name of the Lord, he
[1:21:43] can deliver you. He can make a change in
[1:21:47] your life. But you have to make an
[1:21:49] effort. Just like this man, John Newton,
[1:21:52] he had to do something. He could keep
[1:21:55] living a sinful life. And the Lord keeps
[1:21:58] speaking to his heart and speaking to
[1:21:59] his heart. But then one day he said, "I
[1:22:02] got to
[1:22:03] change." He cried out to God and God
[1:22:07] saved the ship. And then he started
[1:22:11] reading his Bible. And you know what? It
[1:22:12] wasn't
[1:22:13] immediate. So often we want it to be
[1:22:16] right now. Lord, I want to change. I'm
[1:22:18] going to get baptized and I'm going to
[1:22:20] change right now. And then whoa, on
[1:22:23] Monday, man, I'm still
[1:22:25] feeling that addiction.
[1:22:28] starting to feel withdrawals and then
[1:22:31] you slip but then you try again. That's
[1:22:33] what happened to John
[1:22:35] Newton. He kept slipping and then
[1:22:38] moving. But you know what he did? He
[1:22:40] would take a step forward and then a
[1:22:42] little step back and then another step
[1:22:44] forward and a little step back. And
[1:22:46] pretty soon he was all the way over
[1:22:50] here. It's like, "Wow, I backslid all of
[1:22:52] those times, but look at how far I've
[1:22:54] come. Look at how far the Lord has
[1:22:57] bought brought me." And so so so many
[1:22:59] times we just want to see every single
[1:23:01] time that we backslid and every single
[1:23:03] time that we made a mistake, but we're
[1:23:05] still moving in the right direction.
[1:23:08] Who wants to be
[1:23:10] baptized? One. Two. Anyone
[1:23:15] else? Three. Praise God. Praise the
[1:23:18] Lord. Anybody else? Let's uh if you go
[1:23:21] back and meet uh Could you help, sister
[1:23:25] um Elizabeth? Could you help?
[1:23:28] Please go back and see the deacons in
[1:23:31] the back. And it's a great move,
[1:23:34] friends. This is you are now doing
[1:23:37] something from go for God. I'm doing
[1:23:40] Lord, this is what I'm doing. I'm going
[1:23:42] in front of all of these people and I'm
[1:23:44] saying I am going to make a change in my
[1:23:47] life. I am going to be a different
[1:23:49] person. Lord, I'm going to keep trying.
[1:23:51] I'm going to keep pressing. I'm going to
[1:23:53] keep pushing.
[1:23:56] I love that. And you are completed in
[1:24:02] him. Paul said, "Whom this man whom we
[1:24:05] preach, warning every man and teaching
[1:24:08] every man in all wisdom that we may
[1:24:11] present every man
[1:24:14] perfect in Christ
[1:24:16] Jesus." That's why we preach Jesus, that
[1:24:19] that we will be presented perfect before
[1:24:23] the father.
[1:24:24] where unto I also labor striving
[1:24:26] according to his working which workketh
[1:24:30] in me
[1:24:31] mightily. That's what I want to be.
[1:24:34] Brother Lionel, when I leave this
[1:24:37] world, I want to be able to say the same
[1:24:40] thing that Paul
[1:24:41] said. That spirit worked in me mightily.
[1:24:45] I have not attained it yet, but I'm
[1:24:48] moving in that direction. Do you want to
[1:24:50] move in that direction? It's important,
[1:24:52] friends. Praise
[1:24:59] God. For the visitors, we will we'll go
[1:25:02] up and baptize and then we'll close our
[1:25:05] service. God bless you friends. You've
[1:25:06] been wonderful
[1:25:08] audience.
[1:25:10] And if you get anything from anything
[1:25:13] that I ever
[1:25:15] say, get this that Jesus Christ is your
[1:25:19] savior. that Jesus Christ wants you to
[1:25:24] come to him worse than you want to come
[1:25:26] to
[1:25:27] him. He desires to have to present to
[1:25:32] us. He desires to wipe away those sins.
[1:25:35] But we have to surrender to him.
[1:25:38] Amen.
[1:25:43] Amazing
[1:25:45] grace, how
[1:25:47] sweet the
[1:25:50] sound that
[1:25:53] save a
[1:25:55] rich like me.
[1:26:02] And I
[1:26:03] once was
[1:26:06] lost, but
[1:26:09] now I'm
[1:26:11] found. Was
[1:26:14] blind, but
[1:26:16] now I see.
[1:26:22] It was
[1:26:24] grace that
[1:26:27] taught my
[1:26:29] heart to
[1:26:32] fear and
[1:26:34] grace my
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:42] fears. How
[1:26:45] precious
[1:26:47] did that
[1:26:50] grace
[1:26:53] appear
[1:26:55] out I
[1:26:57] first
[1:27:02] believe
[1:27:04] in me
[1:27:08] day to
[1:27:12] place we
[1:27:15] have
[1:27:17] already come.
[1:27:21] [Music]
[1:27:22] It is
[1:27:24] grace that
[1:27:27] brought me
[1:27:29] safe thus
[1:27:32] far. And
[1:27:34] grace will
[1:27:36] lead me home.
[1:27:42] And
[1:27:43] we've been
[1:27:46] there
[1:27:49] 10,000
[1:27:51] years. Christ
[1:27:54] shineing
[1:27:56] as the
[1:28:00] sun. We've
[1:28:03] no less
[1:28:05] days to
[1:28:07] sing God's praise.
[1:28:11] And
[1:28:12] when we
[1:28:15] first
[1:28:19] beun in
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:22] amazing
[1:28:24] grace, how
[1:28:26] sweet the
[1:28:29] song that
[1:28:31] saved a
[1:28:33] rich like me.
[1:28:39] I
[1:28:41] once was
[1:28:43] lost, but
[1:28:45] now I'm
[1:28:48] found. Was
[1:28:50] blind, but
[1:28:52] now I
[1:28:57] see. The
[1:28:59] earth shall
[1:29:02] soon
[1:29:04] dissolve like snow.
[1:29:08] The
[1:29:09] sun for
[1:29:11] bear to
[1:29:16] shine. The
[1:29:18] God who
[1:29:20] called me
[1:29:23] here
[1:29:25] behold will
[1:29:27] be
[1:29:30] forever mine.
[1:29:32] [Music]
[1:29:35] And
[1:29:37] amazing
[1:29:39] grace, how
[1:29:41] sweet the
[1:29:44] sun that
[1:29:46] saved a
[1:29:48] wretch like me.
[1:29:54] And I
[1:29:55] once was
[1:29:57] lost, but
[1:30:00] now I'm
[1:30:02] found. Was
[1:30:04] blind, but
[1:30:07] now I see.
[1:30:16] God sent his
[1:30:19] [Music]
[1:30:34] son. I'm going to have you say your
[1:30:36] name. Tina.
[1:30:39] Tina. What's your last name? Valenuela.
[1:30:43] Tina
[1:30:44] Valenuela. I sat on the steps right
[1:30:47] here. And I said,
[1:30:49] Tina, I said, "Do you know what you're
[1:30:51] doing? And is this your
[1:30:54] choice?" And Tina said, "Yes." And I
[1:30:56] said, "Why do you want to be baptized?"
[1:30:58] And she said this. She said, "Because I
[1:31:01] don't think I have enough of God
[1:31:04] yet." I think that's a very good reason,
[1:31:06] sweetheart.
[1:31:36] Tina, by your own
[1:31:38] confession, by your own testimony, I
[1:31:41] baptize you in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:31:44] Christ.
[1:31:46] [Applause]
[1:31:59] We baptized a lot of over the past year
[1:32:03] and a half or so. We've baptized about
[1:32:05] 70. Most of those have been adults. And
[1:32:09] boy, I love seeing the kids come in
[1:32:13] saying, 'Lord, I I just You love seeing
[1:32:15] the Holy Spirit work work on on the
[1:32:18] young ones. One of the ones that many of
[1:32:22] us have got to know is this young man
[1:32:23] coming into the water right now. We
[1:32:26] talked about stand right here, Brother
[1:32:29] Roy. We talked about baptizing and and
[1:32:33] what it means. And Rory asked me
[1:32:36] yesterday, he says, he says, 'Why
[1:32:39] water? Why do we have to be baptized in
[1:32:42] water? And I told him, I said that in
[1:32:46] the Old Testament. I said, everything is
[1:32:48] is is a type. The New Testament is
[1:32:51] always a type or or the real part of the
[1:32:54] Old Testament. We hear about this
[1:32:56] Messiah that's going to come and we we
[1:32:58] see all these sacri s sacrifices that go
[1:32:59] on in the Old Testament and then they
[1:33:02] were manifested in this man named Jesus
[1:33:06] Christ. And in the Old Testament when we
[1:33:09] see
[1:33:10] cleansing and when we are cleansed when
[1:33:13] when they went into cleansing it was to
[1:33:15] wipe away something that was dirty in
[1:33:17] their lives. And now the reason that we
[1:33:20] baptize fully immersing in water is
[1:33:23] because it represents this is the
[1:33:25] manifestation of what was proclaimed in
[1:33:28] the Old Testament that you go down into
[1:33:31] the water for the washing away of your
[1:33:33] sins is what the Bible says. Acts
[1:33:37] 2:38
[1:33:39] says,"Repent every one of you and be
[1:33:42] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:33:46] the remission of your sins, for the
[1:33:49] wiping away of your
[1:33:51] sins, and then you shall receive the
[1:33:55] gift of the Holy Spirit." what I was
[1:33:56] just talking about down
[1:33:58] there, God living in a man or a
[1:34:04] woman that you are promised that if you
[1:34:06] come into these waters of baptism that
[1:34:08] that same God will now dwell dwell in
[1:34:12] you. Roy, you have something to say.
[1:34:15] Um, I want to get baptized because I
[1:34:18] think I need more of the Lord and I want
[1:34:20] to serve him.
[1:34:24] [Applause]
[1:34:34] doesn't
[1:34:35] mean
[1:34:51] church by your own confession.
[1:34:54] I baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:34:56] Jesus Christ.
[1:35:00] [Applause]
[1:35:21] I met this guy coming in, first time I
[1:35:23] ever met him, nice spirit. And I was
[1:35:26] just telling him, "Come on in." I was
[1:35:28] just telling him that he was there in
[1:35:30] the front and he had such a nice spirit
[1:35:34] listening to everything that I said. And
[1:35:38] sometimes when you're a minister, it
[1:35:40] just helps you when there's people in
[1:35:43] the congregation that are really hanging
[1:35:44] on everything that you said. Josh, do
[1:35:47] you have something to say? Yes. Um, I
[1:35:50] decided to get baptized today because
[1:35:52] I'm prepared to give my life over to the
[1:35:54] Lord and start living by his word and
[1:35:57] his way. Praise God.
[1:36:01] Yes. That's the reason. That's the
[1:36:04] reason that we're baptized. That's the
[1:36:06] revelation, man. That's the whole thing
[1:36:08] is I am going to make a change. I'm
[1:36:10] going to give my heart to Jesus Christ.
[1:36:19] By your own choice, your own testimony.
[1:36:27] [Music]
[1:36:39] Hold my hand. Joshua, my friend, by your
[1:36:42] own confession, I baptize you in the
[1:36:44] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:36:58] Is there any more,
[1:37:02] Daniel? We'll uh we'll sing a few songs.
[1:37:05] Daniel, I'll be right down to
[1:37:12] close. And
[1:37:14] I was a
[1:37:16] wretch. I remember who I
[1:37:20] was. I was lost. I was
[1:37:24] blind. I was running out of time.
[1:37:33] separated. The breach was far too
[1:37:36] wide. But from the far side of the
[1:37:41] chasm, you held me in your
[1:37:45] sight. So
[1:37:47] you made a
[1:37:49] way cross the great
[1:37:52] divide. left
[1:37:54] behind heaven's
[1:37:57] throne to build it here
[1:38:01] inside. So there at the
[1:38:04] cross, you paid the debt I
[1:38:08] owe. Broke my chains, freed my soul. For
[1:38:13] the first time I had
[1:38:16] owed. So thank you Jesus for the
[1:38:22] blood
[1:38:24] applied and thank you Jesus it has
[1:38:29] washed me
[1:38:31] white and thank you Jesus you have saved
[1:38:37] my
[1:38:41] life and brought me from the darkness
[1:38:45] into glory Glorious
[1:38:51] life. You took my place, laid inside my
[1:38:56] tomb of
[1:38:57] sin. And you were buried for three days.
[1:39:02] But then you walked right out again. And
[1:39:06] now death has no scene. And life has no
[1:39:12] end.
[1:39:14] For I have been
[1:39:16] transformed by the blood of the
[1:39:20] lamb. So thank you Jesus for the blood
[1:39:26] of
[1:39:27] life. And thank you Jesus. It has washed
[1:39:34] me
[1:39:35] white. And thank you Jesus. You have
[1:39:40] saved my life.
[1:39:45] It brought me from the darkness into
[1:39:50] glorious
[1:39:53] light. If there is nothing stronger than
[1:39:58] the
