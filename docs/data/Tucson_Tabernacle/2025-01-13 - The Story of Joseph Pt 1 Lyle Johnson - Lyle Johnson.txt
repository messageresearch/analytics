[Music] way thank you so much good evening if there were only one book in the Old Testament I suspect it would either be Psalms which we'll sing from later this evening or Genesis everything really does begin in this book and 13 of its 50 chapters fully 1/4 of the entire book revolves around a young man named Joseph to start our first Wednesday evening of the new year what could be more appropriate than a study from a main character from the first book so this evening and for several Wednesday nights God willing we'll delve into this portion of Genesis and follow the life of Joseph Joseph whose life is is a type which is another way of saying that his life models that of Christ see what lessons he has for us but first let's approach the author the one who inspired its contents together Lord Jesus once again it's it's an awesome thing it's a fearful thing the responsibility to Stand Here Lord to break your word but we're breaking it together the bread of life Lord that we might partake not just the bread of life but the Water of Life Lord we are looking to you this evening Lord that you would fill our hearts just as we sang Lord that you'd answer questions in our minds Lord just fill those vacancies Lord and draw us ever closer to you and ever greater appreciation for your word for what you have done for us what you continue continue to do for us Lord forgive us Lord each one Lord where we fall short Lord forgive me Lord I know in many ways even today that I've done things that haven't pleased you place those under the blood of Jesus Christ Lord and for the sake of your people tonight Lord please Lord forgive me and let your word come forth and into our hearts and take root and spring forth and bring life we thank you in Jesus precious name amen you may be asking why are we studying not not only the Old Testament but the first book of the Old Testament shouldn't we be digging deeper into the into the New Testament dissecting various doctrines and so forth after all we're Christians we're not practitioners of Judaism well to answer let's turn to our opening verses to the last book written by the Apostle Paul PA a pastoral letter to a young man named Timothy and if you uh I I think you probably got it as you came in but there's a handout that has some of the images that I'll be sharing tonight and a list of all the scriptures in the order in which we'll be presenting them if you have that great if not on the way out get one um how old you need to be to get one if you can read you're old enough if you can enjoy the pictures you're old enough so here we go second Timothy 3 we're told all scripture is given by inspiration notice it doesn't say dictation it says inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works what is Doctrine what is men Me by reproof what is instruction in righteousness another translation reads the complete Jewish Bible in this case all scripture is God breathed and is valuable for teaching the truth Doctrine convicting of sin reproof correcting faults correction training in right living righteousness thus anyone the the Greek word translated man in the King James version is not a gender specific word it's like today saying they or them thus anyone who belongs to God may be fully equipped for every good work please be seated Paul is speaking of the Hebrew Bible which we call the Old Testament we've just finished touring that collection of writings over a period of some 15 months with Paul's perspective of the Hebrew Bible in mind let's see how we can find and apply these four traits in our lives in the 21st century so we may be better equipped for every good work as we've recently been and are being taught from the Epistle of James why not study a a lesser character like Reuben or Judah it turns out you can't tell the stories of either of these two without Joseph the story of Jacob the third patriarch is also entwined with Joseph so it it seemed better to investigate Joseph and we'll see how Ruben and Levi and Judah and Jacob fit tonight we'll get off to a slow start because there's so much Foundation to lay so much context to absorb don't despair let me start by giving you a very brief synopsis overview of the story of Joseph this this will help give you context as we Flash Forward and Flash backward in time during our study but fact rather than me let's let another Deacon a fellow named Stephen summarize Joseph for us as he defends himself before the Sanhedrin Council in Jerusalem Stevens is the longest sermon in the book of Acts it's about a thousand words the other sermons in the book of Acts don't exceed about 400 and in this longest sermon in the book of Acts he includes a succinct overview of the life of Joseph acts 7 starting at verse eight I'll read from the from the ESV and God gave Abraham the Covenant of circumcision and so Abraham became the father of Isaac circumcised him on the eighth day he was the first one to be circumcised on the eighth day and Isaac became the father of Jacob and Jacob of the 12 Patriarchs the TW sons from Reuben on down to Benjamin and the Patriarchs in this case meaning some of Joseph's older brothers jealous of Joseph sold him into Egypt but God was with Joseph and rescued him out of all his afflictions gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt who made him ruler over Egypt and over all Pharaoh's household now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan and great Affliction and our fathers he's meaning ancestors could find no food but when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt he sent our fathers on their first visit and on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers and Joseph's family became known to pharaoh and Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his Kindred 75 persons in all and Jacob went down into Egypt and and he died he and our fathers and they were carried back to Shaham and laid in the Tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of hamor and sheim now in that overview I was going to leave out verse 16 but it brings up something that I think we should talk about it applies to almost every aspect of Bible study and that concerns the reliability of the Bible Steph's statements in verse 16 are incorrect they're wrong Jacob's remains were carried back to heon not sheum we find that out in Genesis 50 and place it into tomb Abraham bought from Ephraim the hittite not the sons of himore that's in Genesis 23 Jacob bought land and shakum from the sons of hore that's Genesis 3 wait a minute if all scripture is inspired of God why is there definite error here does this mean that for example the New Testament shouldn't be considered inspired scripture for the Christian I've read several arguments people trying to interpret this verse of Steven's defense and align it somehow with the accounts in Genesis and exodus to me frankly it's a lot of hand waving it's distraction my take and it's my take it could be incorrect is that Luke is accurately reporting in Acts 7 what Steph said but what Steph said is just that what Stephen said Stephen's not authoring a letter or a book he's in a court which had hired people to lie about him so they could prosecute and execute him Steven's under extreme duress in his defense defense knowing he's almost certainly facing a very unpleasant death and he misstates some history that tells us that Stephen was human just like you certainly like me several times I've said something over this Pulpit from my notes and afterward Heather says uh well you said such and such but didn't you mean thus and so I I'm sure I didn't say that I go back and hear the recording and sure enough under no more duress than I am am now certainly less than Steven was I made a misstatement was completely ignorant of it for me this example of step's error in Act 7 reinforces the accuracy the reliability the dependability of the Bible Luke didn't go to some pains to edit what he was told Stephen said oh Stephen couldn't have said that I'll just fix it over here he reported it accurately including its errors just like he reports Peter in up some scriptures in Acts chap 1 when the 11 disciples are going about to a point of replacement for Judas is this discrepancy in Acts 7 with what God recorded in Genesis and exodus an indication the Bible's unreliable or is it instead an indication that we can trust it I think it's all consistent with 2 Timothy 3:16 And1 17 that we read for our opening verses the Bible is not about coverups it's about honesty it's about accuracy it's about real people in real situations in real life not comic book superheroes but people like us well back to an overview of Joseph Joseph did not practice Judaism that religion wouldn't exist until Mount Si about 360 years after Joseph's death he knew nothing of its laws rules rules regulations we know that he was a believer in one God but we have no idea how he worshiped there's no record of him offering a sacrifice there's not even a record of him praying it doesn't mean that he didn't do either of these things just that they're not recorded there's no mention of Joseph having a supernatural experience like meeting an angel but but he knew his dad Jacob had wrestled with an angel Joseph was six or seven years old at that that time and he sees his dad go out in the evening and he comes back with a limp after that encounter he knew his dad and his granddad Isaac had seen Visions his great-grandfather Abraham had Supernatural experiences which undoubtedly had been told to Joseph and his siblings by Grandpa Isaac and papa Jacob well with that as an overview let's start now our story at Genesis chapter 37 and the first verse and Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father Isaac was a stranger and the land of Canaan these are the generations the descendants of Jacob it's a little peculiar Genesis 36 talks about the descendants of Esau and L A whole bunch of people begat so and so and yada y y but here it says we're going to talk about the generations of Jacob Joseph was 17 okay he was feeding the flock with with his Brethren and the lad emphasizing his youth was with the sons of bilha and with the sons of zilpa his father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report well we have to ask ourself where's Canan who are bilha and zilpa how many wives did Jacob have how many sons and daughters this map shows a general area where Joseph was raised and born the city of Haron is highlighted in the upper right Heron's the town where laan lived Genesis 29:4 and Jacob stayed and worked for him for about 20 years he married had 12 of his 13 children it's within the region of padanaram it'll say Jacob went to padanaram you're saying heran haran a city padanaram bu the areas like Tucson and Pima County in the modern world this is the Kurdish area in Northern Syria Southeast turkey near the border with Iraq I've also circled the area of Canan near the center of the screen where Jacob and his family lived after they left heran and it's a setting of our story in Genesis 37 for fun here's the same information plotted on a photo of that entire region from space the same photo I used in the title slide be making more use of this photo as we proceeded with the story of Joseph I'm a space nerd I'd like photos from space I I admit it this slide shows the relationships in Jacob's family Leia and Rachel were his wives zilpa and bilha were his wives slaves sometimes called handmaidens the numbers above the son's names are the order in which they appear in Genesis 30 as they were born the children's names in bold font Ruben Simeon Levi Judah Dina Joseph Benjamin are mentioned by name in Joseph's story there's overlap and intertwining after the first four so the exact order of sons 5 through1 is unclear in other words isachar number nine there may have been born before Asher number eight and Gad number seven there could have been born before nef tally number six we we don't know but we do know the first four and we know that Joseph was definitely the 11th Benjamin is the youngest by perhaps 15 years Joseph being 17 in Genesis 372 means that Ruben the oldest would have been 24 Dina would have been about Joseph's age 16 or 17 Benjamin somewhere between age one and age three when Joseph was 17 now finally some commentators have said well the the evil report and mentioned to the report was evil it wasn't accurate Joseph was a spoiled brat he was a tattle tale and he made things up and told his dad um I don't think that that really fits too well with the character of Joseph myself I doubtedly he was somewhat spoiled being that he was his father's favorite Genesis 373 we read now Israel and that's the other name for Jacob the name Israel he got when he wrestled with the Angel and started limping Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was a son of his old age Jacob was about 91 years old when Joseph was born and he was about 105 when Benjamin was born Joseph being one of his last sons was a reason but probably not the only reason and Jacob made Joseph a coat of many colors a little bit like Laurel's dress many colors well other translations say a long sleeved robe or an ornate or beautiful tunic or robe well oh we don't know the exact nature of the Garment the point is that it was unique within the family and it was a kind of an in yourface Declaration of Joseph's special position with his dad Jacob in fact it may well have been the symbol that Joseph was now the one that would possess the birthright rather than Reuben at Jacob's death death a code of authority if you will recall that Jacob convinced his brother Esau to give up his Birthright and later schemed with his mother Rebecca to steal Esau's blessing from Isaac we'll get to the reason for the transfer the birthright from Reuben to Joseph A little later this evening verse four when his Brethren saw the special coat placed on Joseph that their father loved him more than all his Brethren they hated Joseph could not speak peacefully to him couldn't say shalom some or all of the 10 older brothers hated Joseph and a perhaps the root cause was Jacob's obvious favoritism preference recall when Jacob and his twin Esau were kids their father Isaac always preferred Esau over Jacob no matter what Jacob did Isaac preferred Esau I wonder how that made Jacob feel go Esau I don't think so I think it hurt here we see that Jacob has become what he must have despised a dad playing favorites inflicting upon his 10 older Sons the same pain he felt in his younger years so sad six of Jacob's sons were born of L his first wife a woman he didn't love married to Jacob the deceiver through an act of deception perpetrated on Jacob by Leia's father laan laan was a brother of Jacob's mom Rebecca who perpetrated a deception on her husband Isaac to secure Esau's blessing for Jacob the webs we weave let's flash back about 25 years to Jacob and padanaram he's been there seven years working for laan for seven years to win Rachel's hand in marriage his maternal uncle and now father-in-law laan substituted his older daughter Leia for Rachel on the wedding night and Jacob somehow didn't notice until the following morning Jacob agreed to work another seven years for Rachel but was allowed to marry her only one week after marrying Leia let's look briefly at Genesis 29 again we're building Foundation here and Jacob went in also unto Rachel and he loved also Rachel more than Leia and served with his father-in-law laan yet seven other years to pay for Rachel seems the girls had little choice or voice in the matter and when the Lord saw that Leia was loved less than Rachel no it's not what it says saw that Leia was hated by Jacob not just an absence or a lesser degree of love but the presence of hatred he opened her womb implying she otherwise might have been Barren but Rachel was Barren because the Lord did not intervene for her we read that Leia conceived and Bar son and she called his name Reuben see a son that's what it means for she said surely the Lord has looked upon my Affliction he had now therefore because I bore him a son my husband will love me he didn't she conceived again and bear a son and said because the Lord has heard that I was hated he's therefore given me this son also and she called his name Simeon shimo means hearing she conceived again and bear a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because I have borne him three sons therefore his name was called Levi attached but Jacob still hated her she conceived again and bear a son and she said now will I praise the Lord therefore she called his name Judah means praised or celebrated and left bearing for a short time after all she birs three more children all seven within seven years she's pregnant for 63 out of 84 months verse 35 is the first time the word praise ures in the Bible associated with Judah Leia was hurting of course she wanted her husband to love her the first three names are in the context of her focus on her personal pain now my husband will love me now God has heard me now but with Judah she overcame her pain maybe she just gave up on Jacob ever loving her and she found her comfort and her hope in the Lord It's a good lesson for us it's a good lesson for this guy right here Paul admonishes husbands over and over again to love their wives did I hear any brother say amen I know I heard some of the ladies say that okay thank you brother back to Jacob and his preference for Joseph when Jacob was coming to meet Esau after fleeing from him 20 years earlier to sojourn in panaram he was afraid look how we arranged es his family as they come into Canaan Genesis 33:1 Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold Esau came and with him 400 men Bo so many men this can't be good Jacob divided the children unto Leia andto Rachel and the two handmaids billot and Zila he put his children with their respective mothers and he put the handmaids and their children foremost in the front and Leia and her children after and Rachel and Joseph hindermost oh all go out in front but but if Esau attacks he'll have to kill BHA and Zila and their kids first then fight his way through Leia and her daughter and another six Sons giving Rachel and Joseph the best chance to escape I hope my guys stay in fight but yikes Esau the angry Hunter has an army of 400 100 o o o even then Joseph was the favorite let's go back to our story and heon with 17-year-old Joseph and his special coat Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his Brethren and as a result they hated him yet the more increased their hatred fed their hatred he Joseph said to them here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my my sheath arose and stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round and made obedience to my sheath this seems a little weird they Shepherds not Farmers but as we'll see the time will come when they do Bow Down and it's because they need Joseph's green his Brethren said to him shalt thou indeed Reign Over Us shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words you get the picture Joseph was not loved by his older brothers and Joseph dreamed yet another dream and told it his brother Brethren and said behold I've dreamed to dream more and look the Sun and the Moon and 11 stars made obedience to me one wonders why Joseph shared these dreams sharing certainly wouldn't help their relationship but it does help fuel the fires of their hatred and he told it to his father and to his Brethren and his father Jacob scolded Joseph and said unto him oh what is this dream thou H has dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth and his Brethren hated him yet the more no that's not what it says it says his Brethren envied Joseph but his father observed kep in mind pondered the saying after all you can't make yourself dream a particular dream I don't know if any of you can I can't I can't go to bed and say oh I just want to dream tonight about thus and so doesn't work for me so what happened his brothers hated him more and more but after the second dream while they still hated Joseph as we'll see they now envied him they were jealous this is the first mention of Envy regarding Joseph it's immediately after the telling of the second dream there are no comments recorded from their brothers this time what's going on let's Flash Forward 13 years Joseph is in Egypt Pharaoh has had two dreams and he's disturbed by them his court dream interpreters are perplexed and can't help him we'll understand that when we get to that part of the story a few lessons from now Joseph is summoned and Pharaoh tells him the dreams we'll skip to dreams for now Joseph said to Pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do then he interprets the dreams skipping to verse 32 and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it to pass so the cultural belief at least among Jacob's family is right here two dreams close together the same topic expressed differently were accepted to mean that number one the dreams are from God and second they will be fulfilled soon that's the reason Jacob gave to Pharaoh that's what the brothers had to have been thinking that's why they envied him so the brothers hearing Joseph's dream theme of bowing to them has been repeated would take this to me the dreams are from God would soon be fulfilled they no longer challenge him about the topic shall we indeed bow down to you and instead there's Envy jealousy looks like we will not only does Jacob favor Joseph it seems God does too back to chapter 37:12 and Joseph's Brethren went to feed their father Jacob's flock in sheim the map inset shows heon in the lower Red Box where the family currently lives and shakum in the upper red box a distance of about 50 miles shakam has a conflicted history with the family they settled there fairly soon after they arrived in Canaan back in Genesis 33 Jacob purchased a parcel of land they're Shepherds the pastor must have been good in that area around sheam but the family now lives in Hebron if the pastor is good in Sheck why did they relocate to heon well there's a couple of reasons but let's take a look back at sheim a few years earlier things had not gone well for them when they were in sheam let's read Genesis 34 Dina the daughter of Leia which she bear unto Jacob went out to see the daughters of the land she's a teenager Jacob apparently has no qualms for her safety to Let Her Go by herself into town they've lived in the area for years it's unlikely that this is Dina's first time going to see her friends in town by herself but this time when shakam the son of hamor The Hite Prince of the country saw her he took her he seized her and lay with her and defiled her Dina was the seventh child born of Leia in seven years making her about the same age as Rachel's son Joseph this violence against her occurred before Joseph was 17 and before Benjamin was born so it's likely she was 14 or 15 making this some two or three years before Joseph has his dreams and seven or eight years after their arrival in Canaan the attack is wholly unexpected after seizing and forcing himself on her sheam the prince says he wants to marry Dina he asks and her brothers say okay but our culture requires that all the men of the Town must be circumcised first this is our tradition you have to comply with that if you want to marry her verse 24 unto hore and unto sheim his son after they related the demand from Dina's brothers that the men must be circumcised in order for diner to marry the prince they hearkened they they heard and agreed and all that went out the gate of his City every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his City in other words the men not not the young boys it came to pass on the third day when they were sore you want to imagine and those knives were overly sharp that two of the sons of Jacob Simeon and Levi Dina's Brethren took each man his sword Came Upon the city boldly and killed all the men those that had been circumcised Simeon and Levi weaponized the symbol of the Covenant God made with Abraham that Covenant was that Abraham's descendants through Isaac were to be a blessing to All Nations bad move boys they slew hamor and sheam his son with the edge of the sword took Dina out of sheck's house and went out and the sons of Jacob some of the other Sons we don't know which ones Came Upon This Lane and spoiled the city they took stuff they robbed because the shechemites had defiled their sister Jacob's sons took the shechemites sheep and their oxen and their asses and that which was in the city and that which was in the field they they stripped the place they took everything all their wealth all their little ones and their wives they took captive and spoiled took robbed even all that was in the house and Jacob said to Simeon and Levi you have troubled me to make me stink a note here little a little sidebar if you will often when the Bible says God was angry the literal translation of God's anger is nose of God off Yahweh this is why a stench in that culture was synonymous with bad we might say oh you make me look bad and they would say you make me smell bad I don't know how that works in an Agricultural Society but but apparently it's a really bad smell it's it's why our prayers are often compared to incense why the burnt sacrifices were described as a sweet smelling Savor why the mixture of ingredients and various oils and bombs were critical to get the correct fragrance make the nose happy you make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the Canaanites and the perizzites and being few in number they'll ga GA themselves together against me and and slay me I I'll be destroyed I am my house you idiots we're all going to be killed and Simeon and Levi said should he deal with our sister as with an Harlot and that's the end of chapter 34 this problem in sheum a couple of significant things happen in the family that we should cover before returning to Joseph Jacob never forgot and apparently never forgave Simeon or Levi flashing forward some 50 years on his deathbed Jacob tells him Simeon and Levi are our Brethren instruments of Cruelty are in their habitations oh my soul come not thou into their secret un their unto their assembly mine honor be thou not United for in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they dig down a wall dig down a wall King James is a really strange translation here the complete Jewish Bible and others read similarly let me not enter their councel let my honor not be connected with their people for in their anger they killed men and at their whim they maimed cattle hamstrung disabled crippled oxen wantan in cruelty cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel I will divide them in Jacob I'll scatter them in Israel scatter them in Israel centuries later the descendants of Levi became the priests and in service to the Tabernacle and eventually the Temple of the Lord their inheritance after the conquest of Canaan some 450 years after Jacob utters these words was that they were to be scattered in tiny settlements throughout the land the tribe of VII didn't have a chunk of land they had a town here and a town here and a place here and a place there scatter them in Israel another lesson our actions have consequences but but look at the grace of God Moses the greatest Prophet until Jesus was descended from Levi another clue about the reliability of the Bible Moses is the guy who wrote Genesis he could have easily made Levi look good be a hero or had Jacob bless him and not mention the specific participation in the slaughter at Sheck but he didn't and in God's grace the descendant of Levi became the greatest Prophet Levi was a violent cruel man in the midst of a family no one would want to emulate yet this family they were God's chosen these brothers with hatred in their hearts Paul had a general comment that should encourage us give us hope when we look at ourselves at least it does for me when I consider the mess that I am 1 Corinthians 1 there we go Paul writes for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yay and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence God chooses us so he can show his strength his patience his kindness not ours It's All About Him chapter 34 ended with Jacob in fear for his life after the slaughter at sheam chapter 35 opens with God telling Jacob to go to bethl the family leave sheam immediately and they journeyed and even though they smelled bad the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob God intervened even after this violent cruel act in sheam he protects them from the rage surrounding in the surrounding towns so Jacob came to L which is in the land of Canaan that is bethl he and all the people that were with him God Appears to him there changes his name to Israel they leave bethl and as they approach Bethlehem Rachel goes into labor and delivers Benjamin she dies in child birth and is buried there just outside Bethlehem they continue a short distance and stay near the mcdal D near Bethlehem for a Time Israel journeyed we read and spread his tent beyond the Tower of idir and it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that land which wasn't very long Reuben went in and lay with bilha his father's Kink concubine and Israel heard it this seems a very stupid thing to do what were you thinking Reuben like Simeon and Levi Jacob never forgave Reuben as Jacob Lay Dying he says to reuben reuben you're my firstborn my might the beginning of my strength the Excellency of dignity the Excellency of power unstable as water Thou shalt not Excel because thou wentest up to thy father's bed thou defiles this he went up to my couch the best explanation I I have found for this action goes back to Jacob loving Rachel and hating Leia Rachel would have been the first wife and shared Jacob's tent and bed when she died it appears that Jacob had bilha Rachel's slave move in a reminder of Rachel Reuben would have been incensed that his father would promote a slave over his mother and Jacob's first wife Leia so he forces himself on bilha defiling her and thereby forcing Jacob to promote Leia to his tent to her rightful place Reuben unstable as water did a rash and terrible thing with a motive of restoring Leia's honor this action cost him the birthright the opening genealogies of first CR Chronicles tell us the sons of Ruben the firstborn of Israel for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defiled his father's bed his Birthright was given under the sons of Joseph the son of Israel apparently Reuben's Ploy worked somewhere along the line after this jacob grew to truly love Leia to recognize what a special woman she was a gem oh why did you say that brother l it doesn't say that anywhere in Genesis let me read one of my favorite passages three verses in the entire Bible it takes place in Egypt in the district of Goan in the Nile Delta Jacob is speaking his last reported words what name is on his lips and he Jacob charged his sons and said unto them I'm about to be gathered unto my people bury me with with my fathers the the cave that's in the field of Ephron the hittite the cave it's in the field of Mella before mam in the land of Canaan which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the hittite for Poss of a burying place there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife there they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife and the last Nam to cross his lips and there I buried Leia he will be and wants to be interred forever alongside the woman he once hated how he must have come to love her returning to chapter 35 the family move on from near Bethlehem to Hebron where Isaac Lay Dying Esau and Jacob bury Isaac in the cave where Abraham and Sarah are buried we have no record of when Jacob's mother Rebecca died but she was buried in the same cave as we just read it's in Hein shortly after Ruben's violation of bilha that Jacob makes the special coat for Joseph not for Simeon the second born to become the one that inherits Joseph we first learned that his brothers hate him when they see that their father Jacob loved Joseph more than them when they see the coat back to our story in chapter 37 and Israel again the other name for Jacob said unto Joseph do not thy Brethren feed the flock in sheam Jacob had purchased land there pasture for the Sheep come I will send thee unto them and Joseph said to him here I am and Israel said to him go I pray thee see whether it be well with thy brothers and well with the flocks and and bring me word again so Jacob sent Joseph out of out of the valley of heon and Joseph came to shakum Jacob was perfectly comfortable sending Joseph to his brothers yeah they didn't like him much but it's just the usual sibling stuff right fight in the backyard but in the front yard were the jacobsons it wasn't the first time he'd sent Joseph to check up on things little did he suspect it would be the last time a certain man found him Joseph wandering in the family pasture land there wondering where his brothers are Joseph's wandering in the field which the family owned the man asked him saying what are you looking for and Joseph said looking for my brothers tell me I pray thee if you know where they're feeding the flocks and the man said oh they're not here and I'm sure Joseph said yeah I can see that they departed hence I heard them say let us go to Dothan and Joseph went after his Brethren and found them and Dothan so on the map you see Hein at the bottom it's about 50 miles on the path that goes along the Judean Hills there to sheak him then he talks to this fellow and goes another 10 miles or so to Dothan and when his brothers saw Joseph A far off probably by the coat he was wearing even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to kill him to slay him their hatred had fueled their jealousy and it's now come to action like Peter told Simon the Sorcerer in Acts 822 I perceive Thou Art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity and they the brothers said to one another behold this dreamer comes come now therefore let's slay him let's kill him and cast his body into some pit and we'll say some evil Beast devoured him we'll see what will become of his dreams and Reuben the one who lost the birthright that Joseph would now possess indicated by that special code Ruben heard it and he delivered Joseph out of their hands he said oh let us not kill him Reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit it's actually a sistern a holding tank for rainwater carved out of rock sometimes plastered a small opening a cover over the opening cast him into this sistern that's in the wilderness lay no hand upon him he said this that that Reuben might rid Joseph out of their hands and deliver him to his father Jacob again Reuben The Rescuer he rescued his mother from her husband's shameful disgraceful treatment sacrificing his honor for hers now he's determined to rescue his little brother from Death at the hands of some of his brothers two of whom are known for their anger and cruelty Reuben then departs perhaps to oversee watching the sheep and so forth what they're supposed to be doing there and it came to pass when Joseph was come unto his Brethren that they stripped Joseph out of his coat his coat of many colors was on him this is a violent term and they took him They seized him and cast him they threw him another violent term into a pit into a sister it's a series of violent acts it's completely unexpected by Joseph hi guys what are you do what are you doing we don't know who led this action but Simeon comes to mind as the second son he would have been next in line for Ruben's lost Birthright but Joseph's getting it instead Simeon has a history of violence and cruelty and we're told the pit was empty we know it's a sister because there was no water in it most Moses the author is emphasizing its condition the season of the latter rain occurs in September or October so a dry sistern implies its late summer there had been no rain for some time the sister was dry we're not told how long Joseph was in there bleeding hungry thirsty naked in the hot day cold at night and Terror pleading for his life might have been an hour might have been a day it might have been three days Flash Forward 22 years Joseph's brothers don't recognize him they've been held in a prison in Egypt after three days Joseph comes to them and and he overhears what they're saying to each other Genesis 42 they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother Joseph and that we saw the anguish of his soul when he begged us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us Joseph had been begging them pleading they were brutal violent the NIV reads surely we are being punished because of our brother we saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life but we would not listen that's why this dist stress has come on us regardless of how long it was as Joseph is in the sister hungry thirsty [Music] wounded Genesis 37 and they the nine older brothers Ruben's not present they callously sat down to eat bread H it's lunchtime guys and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold what's that dust out there what who's coming down the road a company of Israelites coming from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and bomb and myrr going to carry it down to Egypt and Judah said unto his Brethren what profit is it if we stay our BR slay our brother and conceal his blood come let us sell him to the ish whes let not our hand be upon him for even though we hate him he is our brother and our flesh and his Brethren were content they agreed then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Israelites for 20 pieces of silver oops and they the ishmaelite midianites brought Joseph into Egypt possible route is shown here in in purple the Caravan is passing through Dothan there's something else to consider here looking at the map considering the treachery of the nine can you see it well don't worry we'll get to it next time back to the brother's camp in Dothan Ruben returned unto the pit and behold Joseph was not in the pit and and Reuben rent his clothes and he returned to his brothers and said the child Joseph is not and I worther shall I go what can I do hey Reuben what are you doing at the sistern and why are you so distressed that the thorn in our flesh is gone were you going to try and rescue him like you did Leia were you going to betray us to achieve this rescue like you did Billa Joseph is gone he's dead what do you care we're finally rid of Daddy's favorites now we'll get the attention and respect we deserve get with a program and they took Joseph's coat and killed a kid of the goats and Di the coat in the blood and they sent the coat of many colors and brought it to their father and said this we have found no whether it be thy son Joseph's Cod or or not the brothers are well trained in the Arts of deception recall their Revenge at sheum it's been a staple in their family for generations and their dad Jacob was a master Deceiver and Jacob knew it he recognized the coat and he said it's my son's coat an evil Beast has devoured him Joseph in doubt no doubt he's torn to pieces and Jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourn for Joseph many days and all his son sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him we all miss Joe dad but come on you still got us get over it we all loved Rachel she died and you got over it it's time to move on get on with life come on dad but their whole deception backfired instead of being rid of Joseph Jacob refused to be comforted and he said I'll go down into the grave unto my son mourning I'll mourn for Joseph till the day I die leave me alone go take care of the sheep Let Me Be thus his father went for Joseph a constant reminder to the brothers and they can't tell Jacob the truth and the midianites sold Joseph unto Egypt unto Piper an officer of pharaohs captain of the Guard there's definitely something going on with these midianites and with that route through Canaan but that's for next time if the musicians would would please return what lessons can we take home from this portion of the story of Joseph well one the Bible's not about coverups it's about honesty accuracy it's about real people and real situations and real life not comic book superheroes but people just like us our actions and our words have consequences this was a a very dysfunctional family hate jealousy favoritism wanting to literally kill one of their own violent cruel here we see that God chooses and uses broken people to show his power and love and care people like me people like us we're all affected by our heritage and our childhood we see and imitate characteristics and behaviors of those who raised us so we need to live a good example don't play favorites with your children and Leia all she wanted was for her husband to love her she did all she could but marriage takes commitment and work from both parties to be successful those of us that are husbands need to be very careful to genuinely love our wives to nurture and maintain and grow that love to express it in word and deed don't let hatred or jealousy into your life if we love the Lord all things good and bad work together for our ultimate good and the bad the difficult things can help build character as brother Daniel Comes to close the service I I said we'd sing from the Psalms let's sing from Psalm 19 and excuse me if I'm on the wrong key we'll get to it you help me the La of the Lord is perfect

and the Honey to moreover by them is thy servant worn is thy servant warn moreover my is thy servant one and in keeping of them there is great reward there is great reward and in keeping of that there is great reward brothers and sisters it's so important that we understand what's going on in the Bible as we read these things and as brother L was speaking and I was beginning to really kind to get an understanding with the the story of Dina and and Simeon and Levi and and how Reuben and and with his F father's concubine BHA and then all on down that with Ruben's loyalty to his mom and then when Jacob had given his son Joseph this coat of many colors and the Bible even says that that he loved him more than the other ones you can see that that the whole situation with Joseph and his Brethren it was just it was just ready to snap and it did snap and they took their brother and they had an opportunity but now we see the background in why the had happened it was some very flawed people doing trying to do the best that they knew how but doing things wrong and then making a major major mistake but then we know and I'm looking forward to hearing the next two chapters of this we know that God takes takes this major mistake and they were no matter how bad that they acted they were in fact children of God and then God takes all of these mistakes that he made that that they had all made and then turns it around and saves an entire lineage of people because of the mistakes that they made brother Kim is a is a great story this story of of Joseph I'm looking forward to hearing the rest of
