[34:47] invite you into our hearts we invite you
[34:49] into our private lives lord we invite
[34:51] you to every door we open it up this
[34:53] morning and say voice of god speak
[34:56] speak to our needs
[34:58] god may you move us in the direction you
[35:00] would have us to go this evening and i
[35:02] just pray lord you'll know the ears of
[35:03] the hero so we love you father we just
[35:05] commit this to you now in jesus name if
[35:08] you have your bibles we're going to
[35:09] we're going to pick back up here in
[35:11] revelations 3.
[35:15] pick back where we left off this morning
[35:17] trust you enjoy the word this morning
[35:19] god is faithful he's good to us
[35:22] he says behold i stand at the door and
[35:24] knock and if any man hear my voice and
[35:27] open the door i will come into him and i
[35:29] will sup with him and he with me
[35:31] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[35:33] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[35:36] overcame and i am set down with my
[35:38] father in his throne
[35:40] he that hath an ear let him hear
[35:43] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[35:45] god bless you saints you can be seated
[35:47] this evening
[35:49] so we find here as we had looked at this
[35:51] morning
[35:52] and the bible would tell us behold i
[35:54] stand at the door and knock if any man
[35:56] hears or attends
[35:59] to that voice gives credence to that
[36:01] voice
[36:02] understands what that voice is saying
[36:04] not just the audible voice but the
[36:07] reason behind the voice and opens their
[36:09] door the heart of their door to him he
[36:12] said i will come in and i will sup with
[36:14] him or i will have fellowship with him
[36:16] and he will have fellowship with me and
[36:18] we find here this is the church
[36:21] of laodicea and we notice where
[36:24] he is at in the end time the bible would
[36:27] tell us that the church system has gone
[36:29] with the voice of man and they put the
[36:31] voice of god on the outside of the
[36:34] church they have gone with the ideas of
[36:36] man they've gone with the denominational
[36:38] mindset and what have they done they put
[36:40] christ on the outside and now he's on
[36:42] the outside of his own church knocking
[36:44] to get back in
[36:46] and i'm afraid church that many even now
[36:49] many message churches are getting in
[36:51] this same predicament where they're
[36:53] pushing christ outside the door because
[36:56] they're saying well it's got to be this
[36:57] way and that way and this way and when
[36:59] you say it's got to be this way that way
[37:01] and you hinder the movement of the
[37:02] spirit you essentially put christ on the
[37:04] outside
[37:07] but we find here these men have gone on
[37:10] many men many many people today in
[37:12] denominations they've gone on with man's
[37:14] psychology they've gone on with
[37:16] traditions of man they put god on the
[37:18] outside of the church but here he is
[37:20] compelling if you open the door
[37:22] if you hear my voice if you open your
[37:25] heart if you would do that then i will
[37:27] come in and i will make a change in your
[37:29] life
[37:30] and that's what we're looking for in
[37:32] this hour we don't want to just be
[37:33] church goers
[37:34] we don't want to be just christians i'm
[37:36] sorry i don't want to just be a
[37:37] christian but i want to be a believer i
[37:39] want to be a part of that special group
[37:41] that we spoke about this morning that
[37:43] bride and it takes us opening our lives
[37:46] up to him and giving him the preeminence
[37:48] into our lives that he desires that
[37:50] means we gotta withhold nothing back
[37:53] that means we gotta open up every door
[37:55] the door to the bedroom the door to the
[37:57] living room the door to the secret place
[37:59] all these different aspects you gotta
[38:01] open up every door because he's knocking
[38:03] he's desiring to come in he wants to
[38:05] have the preeminence in his body
[38:08] but he's a gentleman
[38:11] he's not going to kick the door down
[38:14] so we're looking at again this this
[38:15] evening
[38:16] listen to the voice
[38:19] now he's looking for those that have
[38:21] ears to hear those that can open up
[38:24] their lives and and receive that voice
[38:26] and we heard just as we we heard this
[38:28] morning in john 10 my sheep they hear my
[38:31] voice and i know them god recognizes who
[38:34] is his and who is not his but we know
[38:37] beyond a shadow of a doubt that those
[38:39] that are his sheep those that hear the
[38:41] voice of god those that are known by god
[38:43] there's no way that they can be deceived
[38:45] by any false teaching they're not going
[38:47] to be deceived by by man's intellect
[38:50] they're not going to be deceived by
[38:52] denominational views or hierarchies or
[38:54] traditions of man they're going to hear
[38:56] nothing but the voice of god
[38:59] i will say this it's not possible for
[39:01] you here this evening that are tuned
[39:03] into the voice to be deceived
[39:06] now there's going to be many who will be
[39:08] but there's going to be a group that
[39:09] will not be they can't be they're
[39:11] predestinated not to be the sea because
[39:13] why because your ears have been anointed
[39:15] to hear the truth your ears have been
[39:17] anointed to hear the voice of god that
[39:19] vindicated voice that anointed voice
[39:21] that living voice and that's why we're
[39:23] here today is because we have heard from
[39:25] our beloved
[39:28] and notice
[39:29] has there been
[39:31] many of you we have internet so we we we
[39:34] watch the news on the internet or we
[39:35] listen or read the news or whatever it
[39:36] may be and there's all these different
[39:38] aspects but there's in this day that
[39:40] we're living in there's so many voices
[39:42] that are vying for your attention
[39:45] some good some bad
[39:47] right
[39:49] and we find that but the sheep are only
[39:51] going to hear the voice of the shepherd
[39:55] so what a blessed people we are this
[39:57] morning to be able to hear
[39:59] and i'm driving this home because i know
[40:01] you heard a lot of this this morning but
[40:02] we're down we're picking back up
[40:05] blessed are you that have ears that can
[40:07] hear
[40:09] never take for granted your position or
[40:12] never take her for granted the
[40:14] opportunity that has been given to you
[40:16] that has been afforded to you to be able
[40:18] to receive the message of the hour
[40:20] because there's multitudes that would
[40:22] desire to sit where you sit
[40:24] but they're not elected to that place
[40:27] you have been
[40:28] predestinated to hear this message
[40:31] what a great people we are
[40:34] now the bible would tell us in amos 3 7
[40:37] surely the lord god will do nothing but
[40:40] what he revealeth his secrets unto his
[40:42] servants the prophets so god uses
[40:45] humanity right
[40:48] some humanity
[40:49] you get discouraged with
[40:52] some humanity we prop up
[40:55] but yet it's god's way brother bam will
[40:57] tell us he said in the angel of god and
[40:59] preached in phoenix 1947 he said he sent
[41:02] the angel to speak through man or the
[41:06] voice of man god always used man for his
[41:09] work
[41:10] so god has no other way
[41:12] he uses man
[41:15] he doesn't use organizations
[41:18] or so forth
[41:19] and mechanical devices
[41:22] that's a sticky little topic today
[41:24] hitting it around the message
[41:26] and they're wanting you to push play but
[41:28] he says he doesn't use mechanical
[41:29] devices
[41:31] god orchestrated in his word a five-fold
[41:34] ministry that is the method by which
[41:36] he's coming that is the means by which
[41:38] he's going to deliver his voice to his
[41:40] elect
[41:42] now i'm not saying that you can't push
[41:43] play because as i said many times before
[41:46] i push play all the time i was pushing
[41:48] play on the way here i push play on the
[41:49] plane i push play in my study i'm
[41:52] pushing play at the gym i'm always
[41:53] pushing play
[41:56] but we're in a house of god and he's not
[41:58] going to get back in there's an anointed
[42:00] fivefold ministry that's part of that
[42:02] voice but see he uses man the holy
[42:05] spirit fellow man and that's god's
[42:08] instrument here on earth god he said god
[42:11] used man for his agents is that right
[42:12] always god used man to be his agent
[42:16] jesus was god's agent elijah was god's
[42:18] agent john was god's agent and i will
[42:21] say this brother aaron guerra is god's
[42:23] agent i'm god's agent william branham
[42:25] was god's agent all the anointed
[42:27] ministry out there they're god's agent
[42:29] that's the way that's the means by which
[42:31] god is coming to deliver his voice into
[42:34] his people
[42:37] john 15 and verse 4. let's turn there
[42:39] this evening
[42:41] i'm not going to hold you too long this
[42:43] evening so don't worry
[42:46] i don't know what happened to the rest
[42:47] of our church like we we had a church
[42:49] split this morning
[42:52] we had about 85 90 here this morning
[42:54] we're about 45 47 this evening i'm not
[42:57] sure what i said but god please forgive
[42:58] me
[43:01] he says abide in me and i in you and as
[43:04] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[43:06] except it abide in the vine no more can
[43:09] ye accept you abide in me so i am the
[43:12] vine and you are the branches he that
[43:14] abideth in me and i in him the same
[43:16] bringeth forth much fruit
[43:19] for without me you can do nothing notice
[43:21] now the vine has a certain life in it
[43:26] so if the vine has a certain life in it
[43:28] and the branch is part of the vine then
[43:30] won't the branch have the very same life
[43:32] that's in the vine
[43:34] just you can't separate the two right
[43:37] but he that he says now notice but when
[43:39] he was here on earth he was divine and
[43:41] when he was going away he is still the
[43:44] vine and made up of the branches see he
[43:46] said he doesn't have any any hands on
[43:48] earth but your hands
[43:51] so look at your hands this
[43:52] evening my my my
[43:55] some of you see wrinkles
[43:57] some of you like me you got little
[43:58] scuffs and some scrapes but those are
[44:01] the hands of christ
[44:03] now i know sometimes you don't feel that
[44:04] way right
[44:06] how in the world can he use me
[44:08] but he has no hands on earth but your
[44:11] hands he has no lips on earth but your
[44:14] lips no mouth to speak but what we allow
[44:17] him to speak through our being he says
[44:19] he doesn't have any hands on earth but
[44:20] your hands
[44:21] no hands but mine and yours we are his
[44:24] mouthpiece his earpiece his eyes and so
[44:28] forth of the earth is that right he said
[44:30] the branch is energized by the life of
[44:33] the vine therefore jesus has no lips
[44:35] tonight on earth but mine in yours
[44:40] oh my
[44:41] be careful what you speak
[44:44] see he has no eyes but mine and here he
[44:46] has no hands but mine and yours he
[44:49] energizes us and we bring forth his life
[44:52] as he brings it through us
[44:56] see whether it's preaching the gospel by
[44:58] lip seeing by vision whether it's
[45:00] whatever it is laying on the hands on
[45:02] the sick whatever it is christ is
[45:04] working through the branches of his
[45:06] church
[45:06] every office literally electrified by
[45:10] his presence
[45:12] every office
[45:14] preacher teacher pastor evangelist and
[45:17] profit
[45:18] every office electrified
[45:20] by his presence
[45:23] is that all right
[45:25] but we find
[45:26] that voice has always been veiled
[45:29] by the human flesh
[45:32] now how many have ever been hung up
[45:34] never don't raise your hand that's a
[45:35] trick that's a rhetorical question
[45:37] but sometimes we get hung up on this
[45:39] humanity
[45:41] right
[45:43] right
[45:45] and i'm coaching y'all this evening
[45:47] sometimes we get hung up but god's
[45:50] method god's way is always
[45:53] man
[45:54] and we know there's some men you like
[45:56] are you sure you're called
[45:59] because you watched their life you know
[46:01] things may just don't settle out right
[46:03] and you're watching it
[46:06] and if you're not careful
[46:09] many times we see the faults and the
[46:11] failures of the
[46:12] individual and then we make a statement
[46:15] that god there's no way god could speak
[46:17] through that vessel
[46:20] right
[46:21] but the prophet if you remember the
[46:23] prophet said he could bring a rank
[46:24] center off the street and preach the
[46:25] gospel to him and he'd go right back out
[46:29] now we don't want that
[46:31] but what i'm saying is sometimes we get
[46:33] hung up on this vessel
[46:36] okay
[46:37] so as i keep going here listen he is
[46:40] veiled in man he always was veiled but
[46:43] he was veiled unto them he was veiled in
[46:46] his human temple god was in his human
[46:48] temple be real careful now he's the same
[46:51] yesterday today and forever so god
[46:53] veiled himself hiding himself from the
[46:56] world veiled in human flesh
[46:59] so where is he yet today
[47:04] he's veiled today in human flesh
[47:09] when brother branham went off the scene
[47:11] christ is still here
[47:12] the holy ghost is still here the word is
[47:15] still here
[47:17] he only emorphate he changed his robe
[47:20] and he now he's no longer in a one-man
[47:22] ministry but now he's in a multi-member
[47:24] body now it's the body of his bride and
[47:27] we find that he's veiled in human flesh
[47:31] right
[47:32] see moses was that veil the living word
[47:34] of god fell behind human flesh and the
[47:37] pillar of fire was in moses right
[47:39] well let me just tell you the same
[47:41] pillar of fire that was in moses is here
[47:42] with us today
[47:44] he's still god he's still a pillar of
[47:46] fire he's still a deserter the very
[47:48] thoughts and intents of the heart he's
[47:50] still the healer he's still a deliverer
[47:52] he's still god and his voice is still
[47:55] prevalent and revelant today amongst the
[47:57] body of christ that he is coming for
[47:59] church
[48:00] she says now brother baby says in the
[48:02] unveiling of god it's been failed
[48:04] through these ages according to what god
[48:06] said it will be open in the last days
[48:09] those seven seals will be broke and the
[48:11] full thing will come into view of the
[48:13] people what took place all along the
[48:16] hour of the seventh angel's message all
[48:18] the mysteries of god should be made
[48:20] known in that elijah that last hour how
[48:23] that christ is put out of the church the
[48:25] son of god how he is revealed as the son
[48:28] of man again son of man the opening of
[48:30] the word revealing of the word of god
[48:32] how that the church is to put them out
[48:34] in order and everything for the last day
[48:37] no creed no denomination just absolutely
[48:40] the word living in the individual let me
[48:43] tell you that's what we're wanting today
[48:44] i don't want my man's idea i don't want
[48:48] man's psychology i want the living god
[48:50] by the living word orchestrating through
[48:53] my vessel and be able to preaching
[48:55] through my lips and anointing your ears
[48:57] that you're not hearing the voice of a
[48:59] man but you're hearing the voice behind
[49:01] the voice and when you can hear that
[49:03] voice then it doesn't matter what your
[49:04] problem is it doesn't matter what your
[49:06] situation is it doesn't matter what your
[49:08] need for healing is because god will
[49:10] respond because you hear the voice
[49:13] behind the voice
[49:15] see they had to hear the voice behind
[49:17] moses
[49:20] because moses tried
[49:22] and he failed as a man
[49:24] but when the voice spoke through moses
[49:27] let my people go
[49:30] satan had to let go
[49:32] pharaoh had to let go
[49:34] so god has always veiled himself today
[49:37] behind these old badger skins
[49:40] you know the badger was a mean animal
[49:43] still is a mean animal
[49:46] he had a hard time catching that badger
[49:48] to strip those skins off of them to make
[49:50] the tabernacles the curtains of the
[49:51] tabernacle
[49:53] but god was veiled behind those curtains
[49:56] and today he's fell behind these old
[49:57] badgers skins of ours
[49:59] you look at people
[50:01] you got questions
[50:03] let's just be honest
[50:05] but it's still christ he's still there
[50:09] the thing is we've got to be able to
[50:10] discern what's the spirit of the word
[50:12] versus the spirit of the man
[50:15] so notice now
[50:16] the veil in human flesh the promised
[50:19] word to this age must also be veiled
[50:22] this is in the unveiling of god notice
[50:24] the sin-loving church members and
[50:26] sinners cannot see it because of this
[50:29] human veil
[50:30] so i wonder why they can't see what we
[50:32] see
[50:33] because of this human veil
[50:35] because remember the prophet of god is
[50:38] the mouthpiece of god he would say it's
[50:40] a sign that's always overlooked
[50:44] the prophet
[50:46] and this veil has hid the word through a
[50:49] seventh grade kentuckian from the masses
[50:52] but your ears have been tuned in to hear
[50:55] what the spirit is saying to the church
[50:59] he says now this is in the mess of super
[51:01] sign if the world could only see that
[51:04] god and man are one
[51:07] the super sign was first man that god
[51:11] could come into all that god was he
[51:13] pours into christ and all that christ
[51:15] was he pours into the church the super
[51:18] sign god and man together that was to be
[51:21] the super sign of the last day when the
[51:23] entire bible was to be fulfilled in the
[51:26] last day not waiting on a prophet to
[51:28] come back not waiting on a prophet to
[51:29] finish the word but god now all that god
[51:32] was he poured into christ and all that
[51:35] christ was he empties itself out into a
[51:37] people
[51:39] oh come on you're the super sign today
[51:42] you're the ones that he's coming for
[51:43] your everything that god has done has
[51:46] been done with you in mind that god was
[51:48] gonna so fill you with the word god was
[51:50] going to so fill you with his anointing
[51:52] god was going to so move in your life
[51:54] that you can lay a little mother can lay
[51:56] your hand on the fevered brow and that
[51:59] fever bride will leave and that kid will
[52:00] be made well not looking to a preacher
[52:03] not looking to a prophet but you in your
[52:05] own home you in your own bed chamber you
[52:07] in your own prayer closet can reach the
[52:09] throne of god and get your knees met by
[52:11] almighty god
[52:15] he said they got their superman today
[52:17] they got fake fictions of superman all
[52:20] these kind of super things but the
[52:22] church has got a super sign god back in
[52:25] the church manifested in human flesh god
[52:28] united with man his super sign i say oh
[52:32] glory to god tonight you may have
[52:34] questioned who you were but the prophet
[52:35] of god just told you you're god's super
[52:38] sign for this hour
[52:41] i told i think i told y'all before when
[52:42] i was young my brother and i used to
[52:44] wake up on saturday morning cartoons
[52:46] right
[52:47] i got any cartoon watchers back when you
[52:49] were young i know y'all grew up in the
[52:51] messes i didn't so sorry blame my mom
[52:53] and dad
[52:54] we'd get up on saturday morning it was
[52:57] cartoon saturday
[52:59] hey we like batman and robin and we like
[53:01] superman
[53:02] and i was always superman but i was a
[53:04] super fat superman
[53:07] i'd put that pillowcase around my neck
[53:09] climb up on my dresser jump off the bed
[53:11] fly around i'm superman
[53:14] he was my hero but god ain't looking for
[53:16] that superman now the superman is living
[53:19] right here in front of me you are the
[53:21] voice the final voice to the final age
[53:24] god ain't looking from super some super
[53:26] fantastic he's looking for a bride
[53:28] that'll take him at his word and she
[53:30] will be the little voice she will be the
[53:32] manifestation of the word of god and i'm
[53:34] looking at the super song paleodicia you
[53:37] are the word made flesh you are the
[53:39] manifestation of the sons of god you are
[53:41] what god has desired in his in his
[53:43] ministry
[53:44] you right here tonight
[53:47] everything that he has done
[53:50] he's veiling it behind your humanity
[53:54] oh you're good oh you're bad
[53:58] as they like to say the good the bad the
[54:00] ugly
[54:02] he says now as it is done in every age
[54:05] deity failed in human flesh
[54:09] y'all know what deity means
[54:12] i'm not
[54:13] challenging your intelligence
[54:16] i'm trying to draw a point
[54:18] deity veiled in human flesh
[54:22] the prophets was deity veiled
[54:25] they was the word of god is that right
[54:28] veiled in human flesh
[54:31] but notice what the prophet of god says
[54:33] here now this is gonna this to me just
[54:35] really just strikes my heart he says
[54:38] this is in the deity of jesus christ the
[54:40] same power the same christ hallelujah
[54:43] let the fundamentalists let them whoever
[54:46] deny the power of god they say that it's
[54:48] wrong
[54:50] but the same power that spoke the world
[54:52] into existence is in those people that's
[54:55] got the holy ghost
[54:59] i don't know how you can't shout about
[55:00] that
[55:03] the same power that spoke the world
[55:06] otherwise that same power that believed
[55:09] what he was going to speak when he spoke
[55:11] it it formed exactly what he spoke and
[55:13] he's saying that same power that same
[55:15] existence is in the people that's got
[55:18] the holy ghost today he didn't put it
[55:20] off in a day gone by but he's telling
[55:22] you that same power that same anointing
[55:25] that same holy ghost that same deity is
[55:28] right here tonight and the prophet of
[55:29] god will say you can take the words of
[55:32] god and place it on your lips and it's
[55:34] just just the same as deity speaking
[55:39] your voice
[55:41] can become his voice
[55:45] notice what he says now
[55:47] men and women it's time that you found
[55:49] out
[55:50] who you are
[55:52] the devil is trying to hide you back
[55:55] tell you that you're some little coward
[55:56] down something you're not your sons and
[55:59] daughters of god deity is not in heaven
[56:05] can i finish this sentence
[56:08] deity is not in heaven it's in you
[56:12] oh my
[56:14] you look at yourself you know your
[56:16] shortcomings
[56:18] you know your habits
[56:20] you know your faults
[56:21] you know your failures
[56:23] but he says deity is not in heaven it's
[56:26] in you
[56:27] oh my
[56:29] that's shouting grounds
[56:31] he said he's the creator of all things
[56:32] he made frogs he made bees and ducks and
[56:35] chickens animals created everything
[56:37] there was nothing that was made but was
[56:39] made by him who christ and the deity and
[56:42] he brought down plagues everything in
[56:43] the days of egypt who christ he stopped
[56:46] the mouths of lions he quenched the
[56:48] violence of fire they escaped the edge
[56:51] of the sword they raised the dead from
[56:53] the grave who he said christ who is
[56:55] christ christ is the deity and he said
[56:58] my brother sister that deity is in you
[57:03] oh hallelujah
[57:05] otherwise that voice
[57:08] the voice
[57:10] is in you tonight
[57:12] but he's veiled
[57:14] behind this
[57:17] so we find out as i was saying many
[57:19] times we get hung up brother aaron
[57:22] on the veil of this
[57:24] human vessel
[57:27] right
[57:29] we we
[57:30] we begin to
[57:33] whether it be
[57:36] not your favorite preacher
[57:38] maybe he's too loud maybe he shouts too
[57:41] much maybe he's too evangelistic or
[57:44] maybe he's too boring
[57:46] let's just go to the opposite side of
[57:47] the spectrum because i'm not boring
[57:49] i can tell you that
[57:51] i know better than that the devil can
[57:52] take a bunch of names on me but he could
[57:54] not put that one there
[57:56] but
[57:57] we find all these things but yet we are
[58:00] the vessel by which he chooses to work
[58:02] through
[58:03] and many times we get hung up on this
[58:05] human veil and we fail to hear the word
[58:09] or we fail to listen to the voice
[58:13] okay i'm going somewhere with this
[58:15] we find that the closer
[58:17] the closer you become to a pastor
[58:21] the closer you become to a preacher
[58:24] the closer
[58:25] you become to the evangelists
[58:27] and you begin to see the humanity
[58:32] you begin to see
[58:34] that they're just like you
[58:36] they make mistakes they're not perfect
[58:40] what
[58:42] no
[58:44] and if we're not careful we put too much
[58:47] focus
[58:48] we can put too much focus on their
[58:50] faults
[58:52] and their humanity and when they stand
[58:54] behind the pulpit and they're preaching
[58:57] and the anointing of the holy spirit is
[58:58] down and because you're close to them
[59:00] and you know some things
[59:03] because they're not perfect
[59:05] it can hinder you from receiving the
[59:07] word
[59:08] it can hinder you from listening to the
[59:10] voice
[59:11] now on the flip side of that there are
[59:13] those that we elevate
[59:15] and we elevate them to an office that
[59:17] they shouldn't be we elevate them they
[59:19] can't make any wrong anything that they
[59:21] say becomes thus saith the lord and when
[59:23] that happens because we elevate the
[59:26] vessel to such a high place
[59:29] and then when that happens we can fail
[59:32] and miss the voice
[59:34] because we're thinking everything that
[59:36] they say is thus saith the lord thus
[59:38] saith the lord thou sayeth but the
[59:39] humans
[59:40] they're veiled the word is veiled behind
[59:42] human flesh see god chose
[59:45] this weak frail vessel to speak the word
[59:48] and he chose weak frail vessels to hear
[59:51] the word
[59:52] but god equips us
[59:54] to discern
[59:55] between what is right and what is wrong
[59:59] see and if you're in in and here's the
[1:00:01] thing is you you got to
[1:00:03] you got to get to the place church where
[1:00:05] it's not your favorite preacher
[1:00:07] i may not be your favorite preacher i'm
[1:00:09] not here trying to be your favorite
[1:00:10] preacher brother aaron may not be he
[1:00:13] he's not trying to be your favorite
[1:00:14] preacher but nevertheless whether it's
[1:00:16] your favorite preacher or not favorite
[1:00:18] delivery or not because some people some
[1:00:20] of you are like teaching there's ain't
[1:00:22] nothing wrong with teaching this
[1:00:23] anointed
[1:00:24] some of you like evangelistic we all
[1:00:26] have different appetites how many of
[1:00:28] y'all like cheesecake
[1:00:30] okay three or four yo my goodness it's a
[1:00:32] tough crowd tonight on a sunday night
[1:00:35] but we all have our different likes and
[1:00:38] dislikes
[1:00:39] now i'm a dessert fan i love dessert i
[1:00:41] like ice cream
[1:00:43] you can tell i got a little bit of love
[1:00:45] handle on that side a little bit of ice
[1:00:46] cream on that side cheesecake here
[1:00:49] everywhere here there everywhere you
[1:00:51] know old macdonald had a farm where he
[1:00:52] added some couple farms right there
[1:00:54] so i enjoy desserts but i don't eat all
[1:00:58] of them
[1:00:59] because some of them i don't like
[1:01:01] and so we have different tastes
[1:01:04] but long as we're eating
[1:01:06] as long as we're feeding on the word and
[1:01:08] that's what the prophet of god will tell
[1:01:09] us you may not like cherry pie just spit
[1:01:12] the seed out
[1:01:13] don't go not showing up because you
[1:01:15] don't like it
[1:01:16] get what you can get and then spit the
[1:01:18] stuff out you don't like
[1:01:20] but you got to make sure that you're
[1:01:21] hearing the
[1:01:22] voice don't spit that out
[1:01:26] so now we find
[1:01:28] every voice the prophet of god said has
[1:01:30] a sign
[1:01:31] or every sign has a voice
[1:01:34] so when moses came to the pillar of fire
[1:01:36] there was a voice that spoke out of that
[1:01:38] pillar of fire and the pillar of fire
[1:01:40] that burning bush had what moses liked
[1:01:44] and so the same pillar fire that was in
[1:01:46] is the same pillar of fire today what
[1:01:48] the burning bush had then we have it
[1:01:49] today and yet it's the same and why does
[1:01:52] god do these things god sends a sign and
[1:01:55] he sends a voice with that sign to
[1:01:57] attract the attention of the people
[1:02:00] so why did we have a healing revival in
[1:02:03] the 40s and 50s
[1:02:05] so the brother brandon can prop himself
[1:02:07] up to be somebody
[1:02:09] no
[1:02:11] god was getting a people ready to hear
[1:02:14] the opening of the word
[1:02:16] god knew that he was going to provide he
[1:02:19] had that seventh angel on the scene and
[1:02:21] he knew that at a certain time in 63
[1:02:25] in march that they was going to meet
[1:02:26] that prophet in that closet and he was
[1:02:28] going to loose the seals and the people
[1:02:30] were finally going to see exactly what
[1:02:33] the word was for them in that day
[1:02:35] but what did he do he many years prior
[1:02:38] 10 the 40s and the 50s some 10 to 15 to
[1:02:41] 20 years he was preparing the people
[1:02:43] getting them ready attracting their
[1:02:45] attention so that they could receive the
[1:02:48] word when the word came when that voice
[1:02:51] began to thunder out and it shifted now
[1:02:53] from the healing revival it shifted from
[1:02:56] the signs and it shifted from the
[1:02:58] wonders and now it moved into the phase
[1:03:00] of the opening of the word
[1:03:03] now he has a people ready that can
[1:03:05] receive that voice
[1:03:08] and that's why we're here today
[1:03:10] some 59 60 years later we're here
[1:03:13] because why because our ears have been
[1:03:15] attended to we have attended to what
[1:03:18] that spirit says what that voice says
[1:03:20] and anytime god gets ready to speak god
[1:03:23] has to get an audience
[1:03:25] he doesn't just speak to speak
[1:03:28] so a prophet is always a sign
[1:03:31] that god is ready to speak he said the
[1:03:33] coming of a prophet is a sign that's
[1:03:35] overlooked by the people every time they
[1:03:38] overlooked it they never get it somehow
[1:03:40] he says let's just those who have got
[1:03:42] eyes that are open to see it those who
[1:03:44] are elected to see it see they those
[1:03:47] that are elected to see it they do see
[1:03:48] it but the coming of a prophet was a
[1:03:50] sign that god is ready to speak and let
[1:03:53] me go on notice today to say god has
[1:03:55] already spoken
[1:03:57] there's not another message
[1:03:59] there's not another messenger there's
[1:04:01] not another age
[1:04:03] we don't need profits rising up
[1:04:05] like major profits in that regard we
[1:04:08] don't need somebody to rise up and
[1:04:09] finish what brother branham started
[1:04:11] though if you are aware what's going on
[1:04:13] around the ranks of the message around
[1:04:14] the world there's men raising up to that
[1:04:16] caliber now they're going to finish what
[1:04:18] the prophet of god didn't finish
[1:04:21] but the bible says when the seventh
[1:04:23] angels shall begin to sound the
[1:04:24] mysteries of god should be finished
[1:04:27] we don't need another man rising up
[1:04:30] i'm not looking for another man to rise
[1:04:32] up i got my man
[1:04:35] i've heard the voice behind the voice
[1:04:39] so notice now
[1:04:40] brother but i'll make this statement
[1:04:42] here in the voice of the sign the
[1:04:43] laodicean sign must be the same as it
[1:04:46] was then
[1:04:48] there will be a voice speak to us in the
[1:04:50] last day how many can say amen to that
[1:04:53] can i get a louder amen maybe
[1:04:56] all right that's better i'm working with
[1:04:57] you we're going to get there before it's
[1:04:58] over with
[1:04:59] see he says now remember laodicean sign
[1:05:02] jesus is the same yesterday today and
[1:05:05] forever and when he was put out of the
[1:05:07] church there in the level of cnh we
[1:05:09] found out that he was put out
[1:05:11] he put out again on the outside look the
[1:05:14] voice if any man will cooperate if
[1:05:17] anybody will let me in i'll come in and
[1:05:20] sup with him and they with me i'll come
[1:05:22] in i will be in them standing on the
[1:05:25] outside of the rank of the church age
[1:05:27] knocking trying to get back in and he
[1:05:29] says if any man will open the door and
[1:05:31] just cooperate with me a little i'll
[1:05:34] come in and sup with him i will make
[1:05:36] myself known to them
[1:05:39] so the sign of the scriptural the sign
[1:05:42] of the scriptural voice is for the word
[1:05:44] to be vindicated so how do you know that
[1:05:46] it's a supernatural voice when it comes
[1:05:48] to past
[1:05:50] that's how you discern whether it's the
[1:05:51] voice of god or not
[1:05:55] now the bible would tell us here in
[1:05:56] first samuel 3 and verse 1. many of us
[1:05:59] are familiar with this the child samuel
[1:06:01] ministered unto the lord before eli and
[1:06:03] the word of the lord was precious in
[1:06:05] those days because there was no open
[1:06:06] vision if you go back and you read the
[1:06:08] first part of first samuel here 3 2
[1:06:11] chapters 1 2 3 we find that
[1:06:14] that samuel came on the scene and the
[1:06:16] eli began to let down the bars eli his
[1:06:19] sons were taking the best of the
[1:06:21] offerings they were doing this and doing
[1:06:23] that and eli refused to correct his sons
[1:06:25] and he allowed this and the prophet of
[1:06:27] god would say that he got careless about
[1:06:29] the way he handled the commandments of
[1:06:30] the lord and the real word of god was a
[1:06:32] rare thing and he says that's the way it
[1:06:34] is today
[1:06:36] that's why we got to make sure we line
[1:06:37] completely up with this message
[1:06:40] that's what we want to hear i don't care
[1:06:42] what man man can say well the prophet of
[1:06:44] god said this and the prophet of god i
[1:06:45] said that point me back to it let me see
[1:06:47] it
[1:06:48] because you find that man has made those
[1:06:49] statements all along and when you get
[1:06:51] back to it he never made that statement
[1:06:54] he may have said something similar to
[1:06:56] that and yet it's got misconstrued or
[1:06:58] it's got misinterpreted and we have the
[1:07:00] prophet of god we have the voice saying
[1:07:02] something that it never said so we got
[1:07:04] to be careful always take it back to the
[1:07:06] bible take it back to the message don't
[1:07:09] just hear with anybody say don't just
[1:07:11] gum down anything
[1:07:16] brother baby says now
[1:07:17] we got so many things ahead of the lord
[1:07:22] you can't have a prayer meeting
[1:07:24] obviously i don't know where 45 people
[1:07:25] went this evening but you can't have a
[1:07:27] prayer meeting because mr godfrey's own
[1:07:29] tonight
[1:07:31] you can't have a prayer meeting because
[1:07:32] we love susie is on tonight or some kind
[1:07:34] of foolish nonsense like that that takes
[1:07:37] up the time and we don't have time to
[1:07:39] hear the voice of the lord now let me
[1:07:42] just say i'm not picking on those that
[1:07:43] are not here they hey who knows what
[1:07:45] come up so let me just make that
[1:07:47] correction
[1:07:48] but those who do claim to be christians
[1:07:50] just kneel down a little prayer like
[1:07:52] this kind of homemade lord bless me
[1:07:55] my family take care of us good night
[1:07:58] now i know none of you have ever prayed
[1:08:00] that prayer
[1:08:03] oh maybe you have
[1:08:05] now i'm guilty i'm just going to be
[1:08:07] honest with you tonight i'm tired i'm
[1:08:09] like lord hey look i want to talk to you
[1:08:11] but tonight ain't tonight i'm going to
[1:08:12] bed good night
[1:08:14] but he said the next morning we rise and
[1:08:16] we say just guide us through the day
[1:08:18] good day and he says we shall wait on
[1:08:20] the lord he says we do all the talking
[1:08:24] we don't give him a chance to talk back
[1:08:25] to us that if we would pray and pray
[1:08:28] until our souls come into the presence
[1:08:30] of god and then just relax and listen to
[1:08:32] his voice
[1:08:35] you know since i've gone full time in
[1:08:36] the ministry i have time now brother
[1:08:38] aaron to in the mornings when i had my
[1:08:40] devotion i would get up before i would
[1:08:42] get up an hour too early and i would
[1:08:44] read my bible and i would pray but
[1:08:46] you're always in a time restraint
[1:08:49] because you got to go to work right you
[1:08:50] got to get there on time and you got to
[1:08:52] be ready and you got to be alert you got
[1:08:53] to be awake and all that but now i can
[1:08:55] devote that mourning my time and i can
[1:08:58] sit there and i can begin to pray and it
[1:08:59] doesn't matter how long i pray
[1:09:01] it doesn't matter how long i read the
[1:09:02] bible it doesn't matter how long i have
[1:09:04] communion and fellowship with him
[1:09:05] because now time has been allotted but
[1:09:08] we have to get to that place to where
[1:09:09] when we begin to pray and and we stop
[1:09:12] praying for a minute or stop doing all
[1:09:14] the talking that the voice can begin to
[1:09:16] speak to us
[1:09:19] i was praying several months back and i
[1:09:21] believe i preached a service here uh
[1:09:23] from that prayer from that devotion that
[1:09:25] morning that nothing is impossible with
[1:09:27] god not even cancer
[1:09:29] and because i was praying and i was
[1:09:31] caught up the lord began to speak to me
[1:09:32] nothing will stand before the believer's
[1:09:34] prayer
[1:09:35] and he dropped those words not even
[1:09:37] cancer
[1:09:39] and we find but everything now is vying
[1:09:41] for your attention
[1:09:43] how many has an iphone
[1:09:45] how many has a samsung
[1:09:47] we got smartphones we got ipads we got
[1:09:49] gadgets beyond gadgets
[1:09:51] we got smart tvs we got dumb tvs
[1:09:54] and some of you got tv so don't act like
[1:09:56] you don't
[1:09:58] but all these things what is it it's
[1:10:00] voices trying to get your attention
[1:10:04] and now you find young people even young
[1:10:06] teenagers
[1:10:08] they're so occupied with this social
[1:10:10] media and that social media this chat
[1:10:12] group and that chat group i was working
[1:10:14] out with my son the other day and we go
[1:10:16] to the gym and he's on his phone the
[1:10:18] whole time like how in the world can you
[1:10:20] work out texting the entire time
[1:10:23] like put your phone down let's enjoy
[1:10:25] this father-son time
[1:10:27] we're getting swole together
[1:10:32] i'm swelling up in other ways he's
[1:10:33] swelling up in good ways right
[1:10:36] but we find we have so many things
[1:10:38] there's so many voices and let me get
[1:10:39] there because i'm i'm i'm losing time
[1:10:41] here i want to get to some of these
[1:10:43] things but we find the voice of god has
[1:10:44] become foreign and that's the same thing
[1:10:46] that's happened in america today that
[1:10:48] now america is no longer deemed a
[1:10:50] christian nation
[1:10:52] think about our political system it's
[1:10:54] full of right wing left ring wing
[1:10:56] liberals who refused the voice of god
[1:10:59] they refused the voice of conservatism
[1:11:02] they refused biblical principles our
[1:11:04] country and many other countries around
[1:11:06] the world now do not recognize the voice
[1:11:08] of god in any of their leadership
[1:11:11] you think about
[1:11:13] even in the past two years of this
[1:11:15] administration
[1:11:17] you see the laws that have been passed
[1:11:20] i know some of you know that you just
[1:11:22] got tacked on with taking care of all
[1:11:23] the student loan debt right thank your
[1:11:26] administrator
[1:11:28] then we find that laws are being passed
[1:11:30] that you have to do this and you have to
[1:11:32] do this and you know the laws that
[1:11:34] support homosexual transgender movement
[1:11:36] and laws that strip away our civil
[1:11:38] liberties and yet we find that you got
[1:11:40] people calling to the politicians that
[1:11:42] you know about abortion it's our body we
[1:11:44] should be able to do what we want with
[1:11:46] it
[1:11:47] but come early in 2020 when we were
[1:11:50] refusing to take the vaccination and
[1:11:51] saying it's our body we should have a
[1:11:53] choice those same people that is crying
[1:11:55] out it's our body we can do what we want
[1:11:56] with it wasn't saying the same then they
[1:11:58] were saying you need to get the vaccine
[1:12:02] see the double standard in the liberal
[1:12:04] media and we find that the liberal media
[1:12:06] is taking this and america has rejected
[1:12:08] the word it's turned down the voice of
[1:12:10] god and the only thing left for america
[1:12:12] is judgment and the problem of god was
[1:12:14] that there are so many voices in the
[1:12:16] earth today that it's absolutely a hard
[1:12:19] thing because it deadens the voice of
[1:12:20] the supernatural
[1:12:23] so many intellectual voices great voices
[1:12:26] of mighty men who are intelligent that
[1:12:28] in their intellectual conditions even
[1:12:30] shake the nations
[1:12:32] and they're just not overnight he said
[1:12:34] they're just not overnight people but
[1:12:35] they shaped the nations bringing great
[1:12:37] organizations together great campaigns
[1:12:39] flowery he said and a person would be a
[1:12:42] bit confused it's enough to confuse him
[1:12:44] of how these things can go on and
[1:12:46] prosper in their voices that raise up
[1:12:49] and do these things and it causes the
[1:12:51] voice of god to be placed back on a
[1:12:53] shelf
[1:12:54] since it causes people to be confused
[1:12:57] what is the voice of god
[1:12:59] because isn't if if they're so blessed
[1:13:02] and so prosperous then shouldn't the
[1:13:04] voice be there
[1:13:07] for blessed are your eyes
[1:13:12] blessed are your ears
[1:13:14] for they hear
[1:13:18] let me get down to somewhere i want to
[1:13:20] get to this evening
[1:13:22] see elijah we know the story about
[1:13:23] elijah he went and hung out in a cave
[1:13:26] and we find here in first kings 19 and
[1:13:28] verse 11
[1:13:30] he said go go forth and stand upon the
[1:13:33] mount before the lord
[1:13:35] and behold the lord passed by
[1:13:37] and the great and strong wind rent the
[1:13:40] mountains and breaking the pieces the
[1:13:41] rocks before the lord but the lord was
[1:13:43] not in the wind
[1:13:47] and after the wind an earthquake but the
[1:13:50] lord was not in the earthquake and after
[1:13:52] the earthquake of fire but the lord was
[1:13:54] not in the fire and after the fire a
[1:13:57] still small voice
[1:14:01] see and it was so that when elijah heard
[1:14:03] it then he wrapped his face in his
[1:14:05] mantle he went out and he stood in the
[1:14:07] entering of the cave and behold there
[1:14:09] came a voice unto him and said what
[1:14:11] doest thou hear elijah
[1:14:14] and if we're not careful we get caught
[1:14:16] up
[1:14:17] we can get caught up in the wind
[1:14:20] but the voice wasn't in the wind
[1:14:22] see his ears were trained to listen to
[1:14:25] the voice of god
[1:14:26] the winds came
[1:14:28] but he didn't hear the voice
[1:14:30] and some people get captivated by all
[1:14:32] the emotion
[1:14:33] people get captivated by the noise he
[1:14:35] said there wasn't an earthquake it
[1:14:37] wasn't in the fire but it was in that
[1:14:38] still
[1:14:39] small
[1:14:40] voice see elijah had trained is there he
[1:14:43] knew how to listen to god
[1:14:45] and he knew what he was listening for
[1:14:48] when he was in the cave he was listening
[1:14:50] for what caused the excitement he was
[1:14:52] listening for what caused that wind to
[1:14:54] blow by or what caused the earth to
[1:14:56] quake or what caused the fire to roar he
[1:14:59] was listening for what was behind
[1:15:01] that
[1:15:02] and that's what we need to be listening
[1:15:04] for in every sermon that has ever
[1:15:06] preached don't just listen to the
[1:15:07] audible voice of the man but listen to
[1:15:09] the voice that has anointed him to say
[1:15:11] the things that he's saying
[1:15:14] what spirit is anointed that man to say
[1:15:17] those things because the last thing you
[1:15:19] want is to take the spirit of a man
[1:15:22] so we find now
[1:15:24] we have to be able to to discern the
[1:15:26] voice of reason from the voice of doubt
[1:15:28] from the voice of unbelief from the
[1:15:30] voice of intellectualism
[1:15:32] to that of the genuine voice of god
[1:15:35] the genuine voice of god will manifest
[1:15:38] itself every time
[1:15:41] but we find there's great voices in the
[1:15:43] land today and brother adam goes through
[1:15:44] a few of these and we'll go through a
[1:15:45] few of these real quick before we close
[1:15:47] this evening he says many times we just
[1:15:50] as we just seen recently that the voice
[1:15:52] of politics is actually a stronger is
[1:15:55] actually stronger than the voice of god
[1:15:56] in the churches
[1:15:58] and he says now are the american people
[1:16:00] would have never did what they just did
[1:16:01] this is in 1963 what did they just do
[1:16:04] they just elected a catholic president
[1:16:07] and we find
[1:16:08] now we're 60 years down the road from
[1:16:10] this
[1:16:12] how loud is that political voice today
[1:16:16] my mama
[1:16:17] think about it we're 60 years down the
[1:16:19] road that political voice has gotten
[1:16:22] louder and louder and louder do you know
[1:16:25] that six of the nine supreme court
[1:16:27] justices are all catholic
[1:16:30] nine are catholic i mean six are
[1:16:31] catholic excuse me 30.5 of congress is
[1:16:34] catholic protestants make up 55 of the
[1:16:37] seats in the house and senate but
[1:16:39] there's so many different protestant
[1:16:40] denominations that the catholic voice is
[1:16:43] the single largest faith group in the
[1:16:45] house and senate therefore it gives him
[1:16:46] the largest voice
[1:16:49] and the voice of politics
[1:16:51] is changing rules in the land every day
[1:16:55] making decisions that do not line up to
[1:16:58] us to what we would do or what we would
[1:17:00] support and we also hear there's a boys
[1:17:02] bill graham said there's also in america
[1:17:04] the day and the rest of the world
[1:17:05] there's a loud voice speaking today and
[1:17:07] that's the voice of hollywood
[1:17:09] and what does hollywood hollywood films
[1:17:11] glorify sex
[1:17:12] they glorify violence attacking the
[1:17:14] moral values of our societies and leads
[1:17:17] to youth astray do you know when young
[1:17:20] people gun down violence they begin to
[1:17:22] act out violence
[1:17:24] when they look and they feed on sexual
[1:17:26] activity they begin to be curious and
[1:17:28] they begin to practice even at a young
[1:17:30] age sexual acts
[1:17:32] and they get careless in their actions
[1:17:34] we find here that the hollywood voice
[1:17:37] promotes risky behaviors such as
[1:17:38] drinking and smoking doing drugs it
[1:17:41] promotes violence and vital behaviors
[1:17:43] murders and rapes and etc it entices
[1:17:45] fast cars and even faster women the
[1:17:48] voice of hollywood promotes the lgbq
[1:17:50] agenda and it desensitizes the youth to
[1:17:52] feel that this lifestyle is okay
[1:17:56] because now everything goes
[1:17:59] people have become woke
[1:18:01] y'all know what that term means right
[1:18:03] they become awakened to the injustices
[1:18:06] of what appears to be the unjust no it's
[1:18:09] laodicea people's rights
[1:18:11] everybody has a right to give their own
[1:18:14] voice and when they do they drowned out
[1:18:16] the voice of god
[1:18:18] and that is what's happened in our day
[1:18:20] and that is why we have to be careful
[1:18:22] that we only hear the voice
[1:18:26] now how many of you are patriotic
[1:18:29] okay
[1:18:32] that's okay
[1:18:35] you don't like what's happening to our
[1:18:36] country do you
[1:18:38] but you get to the place where
[1:18:40] it has to happen because we know there's
[1:18:42] something greater behind it because it's
[1:18:44] prophecy being fulfilled because we've
[1:18:47] heard the voice if we didn't have this
[1:18:49] message if we didn't have the voice that
[1:18:51] we have telling us what to prepare for
[1:18:54] we have every right to be up in arms
[1:18:58] there would be another civil war and i
[1:19:00] frankly i'd start the thing
[1:19:02] it drive me nuts but you have to
[1:19:04] recognize that's not the voice that i'm
[1:19:05] listening to
[1:19:07] voice of politics the voice of
[1:19:09] patriotism yeah i'm an american but
[1:19:11] before i'm an american i'm a christian
[1:19:12] i'm a believer and i'm listening to that
[1:19:14] voice and so we got to be careful of
[1:19:17] what voice and what we allow ourselves
[1:19:19] to get captivated by and caught up by
[1:19:21] but we find the hollywood voice is
[1:19:23] screaming out against everything
[1:19:25] that the bible stands against and is
[1:19:27] screaming out against everything that
[1:19:29] you stand for
[1:19:32] and satan is doing his very best with
[1:19:35] his propaganda machine called hollywood
[1:19:37] and his liberal media to create his eden
[1:19:41] he's done a great job church give him a
[1:19:44] round of applause
[1:19:46] he can have his eating because where
[1:19:48] we're going we don't have to worry about
[1:19:50] that any longer
[1:19:52] but we find hollywood all these things
[1:19:54] are trying to captivate our attention
[1:19:56] and they want to influence the decisions
[1:19:58] that you make the decisions that you
[1:19:59] make in your private life the decisions
[1:20:01] that you make in your home decisions
[1:20:03] that you make for your kids do you
[1:20:05] realize that there are former message
[1:20:07] believers
[1:20:09] that their kids are grown kids 14 15
[1:20:12] and they are yet given them the
[1:20:15] permission
[1:20:16] to choose what gender they want to be
[1:20:20] they have so succumbed to the the
[1:20:23] mindset and the thinking of the voice of
[1:20:25] laodicea and satan's eden that former
[1:20:28] message believers grew up in the message
[1:20:30] godly mom godly brothers and sisters
[1:20:33] people that i know personally and yet
[1:20:36] because they've been so influenced
[1:20:38] they've yielded themselves to that voice
[1:20:40] their kids now have a right to choose
[1:20:42] what sex they want to be
[1:20:47] i'm figuring out how they gonna put this
[1:20:49] neutral gender thing on the bathroom
[1:20:50] doors
[1:20:53] and we find now
[1:20:55] the one of the uh i think one of their
[1:20:57] kids he's he's a he or they don't even
[1:21:00] go by he now they go by they and them
[1:21:02] confuse the world out of me i'm like man
[1:21:04] that's that's nouns and pronouns and i'm
[1:21:06] all messed up
[1:21:08] but them and they because they don't
[1:21:09] know what they are yet
[1:21:11] because them is stupid
[1:21:13] is what i said
[1:21:15] them is dumb god made you one way but we
[1:21:17] fine now the boy who's like 13 he's
[1:21:21] bisexual
[1:21:25] now how are you bisexual when you never
[1:21:26] had an encounter so you see the mindset
[1:21:29] of this age
[1:21:32] and hollywood has promoted it and the
[1:21:34] voice of laodicea has promoted it and
[1:21:36] that's why we have to protect our young
[1:21:38] people that's why we have to protect
[1:21:39] what we're watching what we're listening
[1:21:41] to we have to make sure that we're
[1:21:43] listening to the voice of god listen
[1:21:46] moms and dads don't you compromise
[1:21:49] kids may fight they may rebel but don't
[1:21:51] you compromise because you're their
[1:21:53] protection
[1:21:56] i have four kids and there's times that
[1:21:57] you know what the kids can kick they can
[1:21:59] scream they can fuss they can holler but
[1:22:01] at the end of the day i'm responsible
[1:22:05] and we make sure that they if they're
[1:22:07] going to watch anything it's going to be
[1:22:08] something that's holy something that's
[1:22:10] that's wholesome and family oriented
[1:22:13] but we find now
[1:22:15] so many of the churches today
[1:22:19] the nominal system they don't they've
[1:22:21] gotten away from the voice brother aaron
[1:22:23] of the lord and they're going after
[1:22:24] their own voice and brother bam said
[1:22:26] it's smothered out by so many different
[1:22:28] voices
[1:22:29] that it's the voice of god is so dim
[1:22:33] but it goes back to blessed are your
[1:22:35] eyes for they hear in your ears or your
[1:22:38] ears for they hear in your eyes for they
[1:22:39] see so when god wants to speak
[1:22:42] he gets a people ready to hear
[1:22:45] now as i bring this to a close this
[1:22:47] evening
[1:22:48] i want to bring it with this testimony
[1:22:50] here of this story how many ever heard
[1:22:52] of brother uh david gibbs
[1:22:55] he's not a message believer but he's of
[1:22:57] the christian law association
[1:22:59] he gives a testimony and you can find it
[1:23:01] on youtube and other places a very
[1:23:03] powerful testimony and i'm going to go
[1:23:04] through it with you this morning because
[1:23:06] or they're seeing them because it just
[1:23:07] parallels right here so perfectly
[1:23:10] there's two attorneys david gibbs and
[1:23:11] another attorney they were in alaska in
[1:23:13] the aleutian islands and they were doing
[1:23:14] a lawsuit and they were getting ready to
[1:23:16] fly back to anchorage
[1:23:18] and then they were going to go home and
[1:23:20] they would be at home with their
[1:23:21] families and they had a ticket in their
[1:23:22] pocket they're about to get on the plane
[1:23:23] and a pastor come up to him and he says
[1:23:25] listen i can save you some money no who
[1:23:27] don't want to hey i'm all about saving
[1:23:29] money right
[1:23:31] maybe you don't maybe you want to spend
[1:23:32] a little extra
[1:23:34] when he says well how's that he says
[1:23:35] well i flew a plane up here and i fi i
[1:23:38] fly a small plane up here and i can take
[1:23:40] you in my plane back to anchorage you
[1:23:42] can save that ticket save that money use
[1:23:44] it again later and he debated it for
[1:23:46] several minutes and he said against my
[1:23:47] better judgment i agreed
[1:23:50] so they went out to the airport he took
[1:23:51] him around the plane and he looked at it
[1:23:53] and he thought well you know it's very
[1:23:54] shiny
[1:23:56] sometimes i saw we look at on the
[1:23:57] outside
[1:23:59] well you know it's shiny it's yeah i
[1:24:01] think that could do it
[1:24:03] and the pastor walked around and got in
[1:24:04] the plane and david gibbs got in the
[1:24:06] front and another attorney got in the
[1:24:08] back and you know they started out on
[1:24:10] the runway everything is doing fine and
[1:24:12] they tax it out to the runway and uh
[1:24:16] he david spoke to the pastor he said
[1:24:18] should we pray says well you know it
[1:24:19] probably wouldn't hurt we don't normally
[1:24:21] do this well he says we're going to this
[1:24:22] time and so they go out on you know they
[1:24:24] prayed and they started down the runway
[1:24:27] and everything is great and there's no
[1:24:28] problem they begin to climb up into the
[1:24:30] you know lift up and begin to to lift up
[1:24:33] into the clouds or lift up into the sky
[1:24:35] and everything's going great about three
[1:24:37] to four minutes into it and the pilot
[1:24:39] turned
[1:24:40] to the attorney or he turned to david
[1:24:42] gibbs and he says we're going into the
[1:24:44] clouds and i can't fly in the clouds
[1:24:47] they make me pass out
[1:24:49] hold up that's the wrong time to tell me
[1:24:52] you can't fly in the clouds
[1:24:55] but the attorney said the clouds the
[1:24:58] clouds make you do what
[1:25:00] he said the clouds make me pass out he
[1:25:04] says now it's been cloudy all day and
[1:25:06] they're going right up into the clouds
[1:25:08] right then and he said the attorney or
[1:25:10] the pilot looked over at him and he
[1:25:12] began to mumble and his eyes rolled back
[1:25:15] and he passed out
[1:25:17] now they're in the clouds they don't
[1:25:19] know which way they're going they don't
[1:25:20] know if they're upside down they don't
[1:25:21] know nothing all that they know is that
[1:25:22] they don't have a pilot and neither one
[1:25:24] know how to fly a plane
[1:25:27] now here i think we got a fighter jet
[1:25:29] pilot back here
[1:25:30] maybe he can help me out this evening
[1:25:33] but he says now it's been cloudy all day
[1:25:35] and they go right up into the clouds and
[1:25:36] can't see nothing and the pilot looked
[1:25:38] at the attorney his eyes wrote back in
[1:25:39] his hand he starts mumbling and he
[1:25:41] passes out and he passed out cold and he
[1:25:44] took him and he shook him brother and he
[1:25:45] said come on you got to wake up
[1:25:49] but he wasn't waking up
[1:25:51] and the attorney in the back says we're
[1:25:53] dead aren't we
[1:25:54] he said it's a good chance that we are
[1:25:57] he says what are we going to do and they
[1:25:59] had got on the the radio and they began
[1:26:01] to say hello hello they didn't have any
[1:26:03] proper radio etiquette and this other
[1:26:06] guy got on on the other end and he
[1:26:08] answered back he was a a freighter pilot
[1:26:11] he said you guys don't know how y'all
[1:26:12] don't have any radio editing he said we
[1:26:14] don't have any radio etiquette we don't
[1:26:17] have any we don't have no understanding
[1:26:18] only thing that we know is we're in a
[1:26:20] plane we don't know how to fly the plane
[1:26:23] and we got a pilot that is passed out he
[1:26:25] says you mean to tell me you don't know
[1:26:27] how to fly the plane and you got a
[1:26:29] passed out pilot he said yes
[1:26:32] that is correct
[1:26:34] we don't know nothing
[1:26:36] but we know that we don't know how to
[1:26:37] get home
[1:26:39] and he says well i'll tell you what i'm
[1:26:40] going to do i'm going to circle around
[1:26:42] so i don't lose you because if i get out
[1:26:44] of if i get out of range then you're
[1:26:46] going to lose me
[1:26:47] he says what i'll do is i'll i'll
[1:26:49] contact anchorage emergency and
[1:26:51] anchorage emergency will be the ones
[1:26:53] that will get you home they will help
[1:26:55] you get home
[1:26:57] and it goes any he says now five minutes
[1:27:00] pass and anchorage came on and he said
[1:27:02] we understand that you have a passed out
[1:27:04] pilot you don't know how to you don't
[1:27:05] know how to fly the plane he said well
[1:27:06] that's correct he said well the first
[1:27:08] thing i got to do is i got to find you
[1:27:12] what did god do he says i come to seek
[1:27:14] and save those that were lost
[1:27:16] he's got to find us
[1:27:17] right
[1:27:20] he goes my job is to get you home safe
[1:27:24] he said now here's the deal if you want
[1:27:25] me to get you home safe
[1:27:27] you got to promise me that you'll listen
[1:27:30] to my voice
[1:27:33] he goes he says now
[1:27:34] you can't see me but i can see you and
[1:27:37] if you're gonna if you're not gonna
[1:27:39] listen to my voice then you're gonna die
[1:27:44] and the man from anchorage came back and
[1:27:46] and they're talking back and he goes
[1:27:47] okay i finally found you now hear me
[1:27:50] clear he says you're about four minutes
[1:27:51] away from a mountain
[1:27:53] he goes you're gonna crash into that
[1:27:55] mountain and you're gonna die if you
[1:27:56] don't follow my voice
[1:27:58] the attorney he didn't look at him and
[1:28:00] say does this make sense
[1:28:03] do i really need to follow your voice
[1:28:06] see he understood that without that
[1:28:09] voice he had nothing
[1:28:13] and without that voice church
[1:28:15] that voice the voice we have nothing we
[1:28:19] don't have a message
[1:28:20] we don't have an absolute we don't have
[1:28:23] anything what are we we're flying but
[1:28:25] we're flying without a pilot
[1:28:28] he goes that way in anchorage amer or
[1:28:30] anchorage alaska came back says now i'm
[1:28:32] going to freeze all the traffic in the
[1:28:34] area because i'm going to it's going to
[1:28:35] take me about an hour and a half to get
[1:28:36] you back to anchorage and there's a lot
[1:28:38] of bad weather between you and anchorage
[1:28:40] he goes it's going to be a rough ride
[1:28:41] but he says i want you to hear me now
[1:28:44] don't he goes i don't want you to look
[1:28:46] at what's going on on the outside
[1:28:48] i don't want you to pay attention to the
[1:28:50] storm i want you to just pay attention
[1:28:53] to my voice
[1:28:58] and i believe god can say the same
[1:29:00] things to us today don't pay attention
[1:29:02] to what's going on on the outside
[1:29:04] don't look at all the political chaos
[1:29:06] don't pay attention to the storms that
[1:29:07] you're going through
[1:29:09] the personal tragedies the personal
[1:29:11] storms just listen to my voice
[1:29:15] pay attention to his voice it'll be that
[1:29:18] voice that'll get us through brother
[1:29:19] aaron
[1:29:20] so he cleared all the traffic and
[1:29:22] there's other pilots that begin to come
[1:29:23] on after they cleared the pile of 747
[1:29:26] pilots and freighter pilots began to
[1:29:27] come on they're saying guys we're
[1:29:29] praying for you you're going to make it
[1:29:30] but just make sure you listen to the
[1:29:32] voice they will encourage them just
[1:29:33] listen to the voice that's the key
[1:29:35] trust the voice and
[1:29:38] and he realized david gibbs realized
[1:29:41] that at this point there were so many
[1:29:43] voices in his head
[1:29:46] imagine yourself in his position
[1:29:50] all these voices
[1:29:52] trying to be the controlling voice
[1:29:54] one voice you should have known better
[1:29:56] get on that plane
[1:29:58] another voice you're never gonna see
[1:30:00] your family again
[1:30:02] another voice you're gonna die of
[1:30:04] horrible death you're going to crash
[1:30:06] you're never going to see your loved
[1:30:08] ones again you're never going to put
[1:30:09] your arms around your wife you're never
[1:30:11] going to hug your your kids
[1:30:14] all these voices trying to be the
[1:30:16] controlling voice
[1:30:19] but god says i want you to be a living
[1:30:20] sacrifice and i want you to put yourself
[1:30:23] on the altar and let my voice be your
[1:30:26] voice
[1:30:28] that's what god is looking for somebody
[1:30:30] that can lay their life down and allow
[1:30:32] him to speak through them him to use
[1:30:34] them
[1:30:35] so they went through the worst of the
[1:30:36] weather and they were but there was
[1:30:37] still a bit more to come and they in the
[1:30:40] the anchorage alaska came back on he
[1:30:42] says now i'm going to line you up and
[1:30:44] i'm going to bring you right down the
[1:30:46] runway
[1:30:48] he says now at the foot of the runway
[1:30:50] there are some lights and they're in the
[1:30:51] form of a cross he said now remember
[1:30:53] don't forget this
[1:30:54] the cross is the way home
[1:30:58] so maybe you're groping in darkness out
[1:31:00] there somewhere just remember the cross
[1:31:02] is always the way home
[1:31:05] and he kept saying just stay with me
[1:31:08] even when you can't see god stay with me
[1:31:11] even when you don't hear god stay with
[1:31:13] me
[1:31:14] the bible says that his sheep hear the
[1:31:16] voice
[1:31:17] and they only hear his voice
[1:31:19] and they were just a couple hundred feet
[1:31:20] from the ground and they saw they
[1:31:22] finally saw the cross and the attorney
[1:31:24] said he landed the plane or david gibbs
[1:31:26] landed the plane he said in fact i
[1:31:27] landed that plane seven times
[1:31:32] he said when that plane finally come to
[1:31:34] a stop the pilot woke up
[1:31:37] he didn't miss all the action
[1:31:41] he said the pilot finally woke up but he
[1:31:43] said the voice said thanks for listening
[1:31:46] to the voice
[1:31:48] he goes i watch them crash and burn all
[1:31:51] the time because they don't follow my
[1:31:53] voice
[1:31:55] they don't understand that i'm the one
[1:31:57] that can see them
[1:31:59] they can't see me
[1:32:00] but they get in their head all these
[1:32:02] voices and they kill themselves they
[1:32:04] self-destruct he said thanks for
[1:32:06] listening
[1:32:08] to my voice
[1:32:09] so they took david gibbs and they took
[1:32:11] the other tourney took him back to a
[1:32:12] hotel room
[1:32:14] so they could get some rest i'm sure it
[1:32:15] was a very trying ordeal and about four
[1:32:18] o'clock in the morning come a knock on
[1:32:19] the door and he went to the door and he
[1:32:21] answered it and the voice and he says
[1:32:23] hello
[1:32:24] david and he said you're the voice
[1:32:28] you're the one that got me home
[1:32:30] church there's going to be a day that we
[1:32:32] stand before him and we're going to be
[1:32:34] able to say you're the voice
[1:32:36] you're the voice that got me home
[1:32:40] when i didn't know how to get there i
[1:32:41] didn't know how to fly the plane i
[1:32:43] didn't know how my life was going but
[1:32:44] you're the voice that got me home
[1:32:48] and he says yes one day we're going to
[1:32:50] stand before that voice
[1:32:52] but we find that there's so many voices
[1:32:56] in our head and we wonder why we wonder
[1:32:59] why our kids crash and burn
[1:33:02] i wonder why our marriages become
[1:33:04] shattered
[1:33:06] wonder why people commit suicide
[1:33:09] wonder why people are so depressed and
[1:33:10] full of anxieties
[1:33:12] because they're listening to their own
[1:33:14] voice
[1:33:15] they're paying attention to all the
[1:33:17] chaos that's going on
[1:33:20] and they're not listening they're not
[1:33:21] staying with the voice
[1:33:24] doesn't the bible tell us that i'm the
[1:33:26] way
[1:33:27] the truth and the life
[1:33:30] he's still the same way
[1:33:32] he is still that truth
[1:33:34] he is still the life
[1:33:36] see stay with me
[1:33:39] don't listen to all the other voices
[1:33:42] don't be distracted by what's going on
[1:33:44] around you don't be distracted about
[1:33:46] what this group is doing or what that
[1:33:48] group is doing what's going on in your
[1:33:50] head the storms because those thoughts
[1:33:53] come
[1:33:55] you know you can't keep the thoughts
[1:33:56] from coming but you can keep the
[1:33:58] thoughts from roosting
[1:34:00] right it's like the old farmer took the
[1:34:02] took the word he took a shotgun and he
[1:34:04] blew the birds out that's what we ought
[1:34:06] to do church listen
[1:34:08] to
[1:34:08] the voice
[1:34:10] now as the musicians will make their way
[1:34:11] back
[1:34:12] i want you to bow your heads just
[1:34:14] briefly for a minute
[1:34:15] so we bring this down to a close i'm a
[1:34:18] little bit over time but that's okay
[1:34:19] this evening
[1:34:23] listen
[1:34:24] to
[1:34:25] the voice
[1:34:27] maybe you're here this evening and
[1:34:30] you just be honest with yourself that
[1:34:32] you've been listening to the voice of
[1:34:34] depression
[1:34:37] maybe you've been listening to the voice
[1:34:38] of discouragement
[1:34:42] voice of complex is telling you you're
[1:34:43] never going to fit in
[1:34:45] you don't fit in nowhere nobody no group
[1:34:48] everyone's against you
[1:34:51] maybe you've even been listening to the
[1:34:53] voice of suicide just go ahead and take
[1:34:55] your life nobody's going to miss you
[1:34:58] the voice of reasoning and the doubts
[1:35:00] you don't know you know you question
[1:35:02] whether this message is real or not or
[1:35:04] you question is it the truth or not
[1:35:07] maybe it's a voice of fear and you're
[1:35:09] nervous all the time
[1:35:11] no peace no joy everything stripped away
[1:35:13] from you
[1:35:15] your home is upside down
[1:35:18] maybe you listen
[1:35:19] yielded to the voices of the world and
[1:35:21] you're doing things that you shouldn't
[1:35:22] do going to websites that you shouldn't
[1:35:24] go to
[1:35:26] but i believe today there's been a voice
[1:35:28] here
[1:35:30] i believe there's a voice that is
[1:35:32] present today that can meet your need
[1:35:40] and i believe that voice will tell you
[1:35:42] you don't have to stay bound
[1:35:47] stay with me you don't have to be bound
[1:35:49] by depression and anxiety you don't have
[1:35:51] to struggle with those suicidal thoughts
[1:35:55] you don't have to have doubts whether
[1:35:56] this message is truth or not
[1:35:58] you can have that assurance today
[1:36:02] he can come he can become a personal god
[1:36:04] to you this evening
[1:36:07] he can become a living voice that lives
[1:36:09] through your life
[1:36:12] maybe fear has gripped you this evening
[1:36:16] fear can release its grip off of your
[1:36:18] life this evening church
[1:36:20] because i believe the chain breaker is
[1:36:21] here to liberate you

[1:36:26] hand up to god
[1:36:29] god sees your hand back there in the

[1:36:56] pray today that
[1:36:58] i make a vow before you and before god's
[1:37:00] people
[1:37:01] that i'll just hear your voice from now
[1:37:03] on
[1:37:04] so father we we come before you lord
[1:37:07] tonight and
[1:37:08] i know this is service kind of went a
[1:37:10] little different than maybe what we

[1:37:15] you're mindful of us
[1:37:18] god we're so thankful that we can hear
[1:37:20] the voice of god for this hour
[1:37:22] and lord we're not scrupled up we're not

[1:37:27] all that what to believe the sign or
[1:37:29] don't believe the signs are saying lord
[1:37:31] about the cloud and about the bridge and
[1:37:33] about all these different aspects
[1:37:35] lord we know that
[1:37:37] that voice is the voice
[1:37:39] that is taking care of us
[1:37:40] it's your voice father that is bringing
[1:37:42] us through
[1:37:45] and lord we're here tonight
[1:37:47] many times we yielded our lives to hear
[1:37:50] maybe things of man are we yielded to
[1:37:52] those things that would get in our heads
[1:37:54] father and maybe a little bit of
[1:37:55] depression and complex and anxiety and
[1:37:57] those things but lord we're asking that
[1:37:59] you'd forgive us for that and we want to
[1:38:00] just hear your voice tonight
[1:38:03] we pray father that you just release
[1:38:04] unto us your spirit

[1:38:26] surely lord you laid this on upon my
[1:38:28] heart for a purpose
[1:38:31] there's a need in the body
[1:38:32] and i believe you don't make mistakes
[1:38:34] lord i believe you know how to meet that
[1:38:35] need
[1:38:36] we just asked lord tonight that you
[1:38:38] would meet the needs of your people god
[1:38:40] in your own personal way
[1:38:43] and i believe if you was here god
[1:38:45] standing behind this desk
[1:38:47] you'd be saying the same things
[1:38:49] hear my voice
[1:38:52] stay with me
[1:38:53] listen only to my voice don't be
[1:38:55] distracted by what's going on around you

[1:39:03] here tonight those that are simple god
[1:39:05] may you bless them
[1:39:06] bless their homes lord bless the young
[1:39:09] people father that they will give their
[1:39:10] ears to you lord
[1:39:12] pull so many directions lord so many
[1:39:14] enticements in this hour but yet god you
[1:39:16] said you're going to have a bride
[1:39:19] and she's going to be made up of young
[1:39:20] people
[1:39:21] middle-aged people and old people father

[1:39:25] you vessels of instruments of
[1:39:27] righteousness tonight have your way now
