demonstration and power that's what god's people is looking for amen i'm sorry there's a president of the lord is here tonight amen how do you how many you feel the presence of the lord amen joel won amen and one the word of the lord came to joel the son of pinell uh hear this ye o man and give ears all your inhabitants of the land have this been in your days or even in the days of your father tell your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation verse 4 that which the palmer worm has left has the locust eating and that which the locust has left has the kenko worm edith and that which the kink of worm hath left the caterpillar has eaten oh praise god oh i love it amen let's tune in to uh right over to 2 and 25 chapter 2 and verse 25 you familiar and it reads and i now notice this is uh this is spoken through the might of this prophet amen but he only speaking by inspiration it was god that was speaking through that prophet amen so a prophet is a mouthpiece of god he preaches he speaketh by inspiration and the people catches that revelation and they believe it amen 2 and 25 and i personal pronoun and i will restore unto you the years that the locust has eaten the canker worm the caliphater and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you god did that and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and play pray the name of your lord your god has that has dealt wonderfully with you and my people shall never be ashamed somebody said never be ashamed hallelujah verse 27 oh i feel the presence of the lord and ye shall know that i am in the midst amen of tucson of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed one more verse and we'll let you be seated genesis the 20th chapter we know genesis is a c chapter everything that was in genesis is here today every spirit amen amen just in a different form amen but jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever genesis 20 and verse 6 amen and it read and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in their integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffer god said now you you're sinning against me and amalek said i'm sinned against you you're sinning against me because i got a plan and this plan not to be by you but it's going to be through abraham if that's right i know he said i know that i didn't in the integrity of the heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffer thee not to touch her don't touch that woman don't touch that church now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shall live and if thy restore her not know thou that thou shall surely die thou and all that are dying if that's right amen let us just buy our heads we thank you again lord jesus for the reading of your word not sanctified to our soul this reacts in jesus name we're just going to go ahead and take this off uh one thing is it's hard for me to eat with a lot of armor on you may be seated praise god amen and uh amen and it's it's hard to for me to preach sometime with this arm on so we just want to tell god we thank him tonight amen how many of you have come with expectation amen that's what we come to church for we come to see god you know a lot of people in their mind there you know they they said i believe god but that bowel in their mind they're kind of saying uh you know god can't do those things what he did in the prophet days or he did in paul and irena's and martin columbus and luther and wesley and those days but let me tell you what the devil is a liar jesus christ is the same yesterday what today and forever god has not changed amen so that's why i have trust in him tonight i know him that amen see one thing i've learned when i come to church amen i realized first of all satan is a liar and you know and i realized a lot of time the evening

prophet joel he spoke by inspiration now hundreds of years he spoke amen i will restore i will restore said the lord all that the palmer worm the locust and the caterpillar has eaten my great armor now god allowed that to be raised up amen to eat that bride tree all the way down that's right now the prophet of god said that when when that that bride tree started uh he said it started in in eden one place and and how god had to get that little crop and put them on the ark and carried them over amen but i love what he said on the day of pentecost when he started that bride tree and he said it came to a full blossom oh it was looking good amen in the church had the power amen the act of the holy ghost was in the apostles it wasn't nothing for someone shadow to pass and they were instantly healed amen it wasn't nothing for peter and the disciples to walk amen in this place and they saw this man that was lame and peter said look we don't have nothing but seven go have we not amen but such that we have what rise up or raise up our rise up and wall now peter said we don't have money but what he's saying just look on us yeah just just look on us and that's what you need to know amen amen do you know you're the life to this dying generation do you know you're the only thing that's left on this earth you know the first bible that was written was uh the zodiac that's right amen the second bible uh the pyramid i think that's right amen and the third bible is what you got on your lap or your hand or on your phone or whatever amen but the prophet that god said a lot of people don't read their bible but what they will read they will read you so you are the written epistles and read of all men so we the one have to make this thing work amen see faith is a revelation amen you have to the prophet of god said i love so well everything we need is already here do you know when job watching uh across the icy delaware do you know television was already here oh god oh lord but someone had to invented it yeah so somebody amen could tap into that faith room whatever your need is tonight now i believe that i'm just not talking amen i've seen god done it for me a couple about a month

they ate that tree all the way down but let's go back down the day of pentecost as we say mind the power of god man they they sold all they had and man the folks just love one another but the bible let us know the bible say on the day of pentecost there was all with one accord brother brown said they had the same mind oh the same mind can you imagine all of us in here having the same mind wow

tell everyone to come up here and everybody comes up here and and and i said let's form a line let the elderly sister get up front and let little children and can you see you're all up here and you're all up there and everybody the musician you get in your your place say amen we're from the same amazing grace everybody get up here and smile and some got notes and some know it by memories amen and

they're going to hunt next week or they might think about how they're going to uh pay this bill amen see they they they don't want a car but they ain't got the same mind but on the day of pentecost they had the same mind they had one thing what was it looking for the promise of the father and that's what people got to be looking for they got to be looking for the rapture people don't like that word no more but i'm hungry let me tell you what there's a man inside of me that's ready to explode lord god i'm ready for a body change man i'm ready to walk those streets of gold and by the way if

church amen you should have that joy you should look you should expect god and you know you get what you expect you don't look for nothing what you don't get nothing it's like a person that prayed much prayer and much power little prayer is little power no prayer you don't have no power at all the devil do you any kind of way you want but you got to have a prayer life a life dedicated to god amen i don't know about you but i'm calling on this rapture i'm calling on there's a birth plane there's something inside of me is travailing amen it's crying i'm waiting amen to go back where i come

i'm telling you and and i hate to say this you know one thing about an evangelist evangelist is kind of evangelist is a little bit different than a than a pastor let me tell you the difference a pastor he both of us got guns because we we ready the bloated elbow up right both of us got gun but an evangelist gun doesn't have a safety latch on it a pastor he he got to be careful who he shoot because they might quit church and you know he got he got to pet him you know so you sound real good and she have come into church and have he's penitential sister i just love the way you say he trying to encourage her but i tell you you need the holy ghost i tell you you need to come to church and stop staying home brother brown said stay home and watch and i love luke say what's wrong with

when god get ready for me to go i'm going to leave with the mass or without a mass so why should i fear why should i tip around a brother pull up in the air when all this went on hey man god pull up into your i'll reach and shake his hand and he give me some sanitizer i said man please man please what are you doing words of people faith you're preaching all that faith but where is your faith do you have the faith amen that's the size of a monstrosity you could say to young mountain and be thy move let me tell you what if your heart is right you could say to that mountain and that mountain has got to move i'm talking about a restored faith now do you know the prophet of god he was a word prophet right right word prophet right my i love the way y'all poor brother can i can i have about 12 o'clock tonight would that be all right somebody said well he coming back no more and you see amen all the power all the power that god give to us all the joy amen unspeakable joy amen and full of glory amen but see william brown was a word prophet and brother brown knew how to use the word on the devil and he knew how to enforce it uh wasting a lot of your time and he knew how to enforce that word he enforced that word mama when somebody get on your land you go home and somebody in your house you got a right and your name on that on that house or whatever you got all right you might have can't fight him hey man just don't worry about it don't worry about it stay right there just go call and call the law call the sheriff and they'll go there man and he'll calm down amen and that's how the devil wanted to scare you in our neighborhood they had this guy walking the street uh just hollering and cursing and looking like he'd come out of the 17th century or so he looking all dirty he was just cursing and saying all kind of ugly words and my wife we pull up in the church y'all and my wife said i ain't afraid but she's walking by the fast she's like i'm not afraid i'm not afraid i'm not afraid i said where you going and my grandbaby and my wife said i said you better come on in the church i said why why they got to run for you know i said what what i mean what are you supposed to be doing to me huh and my wife said how's that i said so uh uh he was just cutting up out there this this i didn't streak a man out in the shopping mall just cursing cars out and saying all kind of ugly things and the hairs all look look terrible look like he'll just tear you apart amen but see fear is tormenting is of the devil see it's not the size of the dog in the fight but it's the size of the fight in the dog you get the spirit of the dog you got the dog yeah you got the dog you you got the dog so what he did was what he did well amen he was talking all that knowing but somebody called the the cops and when the cops coming there when in bad the same man you thought he got saved huh he thought he got to say he calmed down and that's how the devil is the devil be bluffing be talking all that knowledge be blurry you tell that devil i don't fear you i believe the word of god you say what if you die so what if i die i got a body over there waiting on me and furthermore christians don't die well the devil don't like that kind of preaching huh christian don't die they go to another dimension amen brother brown said what is age anymore anyhow amen so brother brown know how to use the word on the devil y'all making me feel like preaching that someone if you got a dick in here you got to tell me if i'm going over my time i mean if i'm preaching too long just kind of wave your hand but i mean you're gonna have to wave it fast but if you do like that i think you worship and i'm gonna keep on preaching oh praise god amen amen but brother brethren knew how to use the word amen you remember brother elvis evans i think his name he's from uh georgia right came to louisville right and brother brown said he traveled for so many miles but what happened was brother elvin forgot to leave his car outside and somebody stole his car and brother brown said in that town they'll steal your car they could change the license plate give you any numbers just like that he said that's what they do in louisville they're still cars so but what they did they went to the right man that's why you need to know somebody that know how to get a hold of god yeah we're living the hour now you need to know somebody say i'll be careful who i talk to because some people they love the gospel all the time they always you know how they act when you come around if you want to talk about somebody like they be scratching their son like wait what wait and they want to talk about something you you see that sister and you you i don't want to hear that i don't want to hear that give me something with some life in it huh give me something with some joy in it praise god amen so brother brown they came to brother brown and said brother brian my car is gone my wife baloney and this man a long way from home boy it's something about desperation brother brown said it's sad people got to get desperate for god to move if you get desperate enough the rapture will take place people in desperate people love these things of this world and they went to brother branham and brother brown would say brother let's pray now brother brown would say let's go to our knees he said now jesus didn't have to do that because the only thing he did was spoke the word jesus come down and hit the offer we bypass out the offer and come on this earth in this sinful tabernacle how and now we got to have faith to believe in god's promised word so when you pray you got to enforce it now i preached this at a church about a month ago i'm going to tell you what happened somebody caught that revelation and when i said i said and brother brown said let's pray and he said me and my four or five brother got down and we prayed prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever placed in the hands of a human being but people don't want to pray you want to tell the devil amen sometimes you got to pray you got to pray over your situation and brother brown said let's pray and when they began to pray brother brown said a vision wait a minute a vision it just broke forth he said i see your car they brought it on this side of the bridge or something like he said they brought it back and his brother brandon told them where it was at and they went over there and they found the car i think it was kind of half tank of gaza that's right y'all help me out you messy believers hey man don't let me go go the wrong way man cause somebody listen he ain't quote that right brother brown said seven thousand instead of seven hundred is that right so he is human but brother brown prayed and he used the word and he enforced the law and that camp uh praise god that car came back well i was preaching at that church that that a few senses ago and i spoke the same message and it was the same anointing that is here because i told the people the same power that was in william bradley is here today no this is this power we talk about it's not in jeffersonville no no not ever the same holy ghost power is in here but you got to know how to release that you got to know how to let it go yeah use a bird you know how to fly you're a bird this fly that's what a bird do this they fly a fish don't come and say i got to hold my breath i'm going down to the bottom of the ocean you try to do try to do that you explode but a fish he just know how to inflate himself and the prophet of god say go right down to the bottom of the sea well when i preached that there was a sister came up cloven 19 had hit that church about 80 percent and the sister came up and now she came up for prayer and i said sister i don't know what you come up here for but i said there was a sister that came in the line and the doctor said oh my god she said the doctor said she had some spots on her lungs amen and she got a good idea what it was it was count saying man but let me tell you what jesus christ is still the same yesterday one thing you got to do is believe and she came up in the line and i said sister let me tell you what the same thing i told her i said that william branham is not hearing the flash but you got another son of god that believes the same thing that our prophet prayed i'm not waiting on my revival i am a revival yes sir i ain't waiting on a certain week we got to have a revival i could have a revival all by myself and that sister came up in the line i said sister if you believe god i said when you go to the doctor god will heal you he just say she went away praising god the next sister came up with the same problem she had a spot on her lung i told her to believe god i said god is not a man that he shall lie neither he's the son of man that he shall repent if god speaks something amen if god heals that sister and she came with the right knee the right approach then you come he got to do the same thing if he don't then he's not god they came back uh the next sermon my brother oh they was there they came back the next service uh the next time i got the report amen uh preaching the message the second coming of the lord amen the prophet of god preached about the lost corn and i was preaching that and the sister amen believe god what you did she grab hold your faith love what you got to do you say it's too high well get up there where is that amen amen you got to reach faith some kind of way you got we got to get your play we got to be changed that's uh we're all in this thing together we got to get a change preacher deacon whatever everybody got to get a change yeah and she reached up and she grabbed hold of faith she went to the doctor went to mri and all these tests and the doctors say i don't know what half but he can't even find a tray so i told his sister that came up a couple weeks ago i told her to test him on i said sister i don't know what you needed i said what jesus christ is to say yesterday the day and forever and she was just praising god she's just praising god she said she said brother i said she said i couldn't breathe she said but not like a breed i said well praise god you know what i did i shot right there on the devil's head amen i don't want him to know that the shadow of the king is back in the camp oh god in dead we just need some preacher that with some power and demonstration don't give me letters all the time let us kill us but the spirit of the letter is power we need someone with some power yeah yeah yes sir and nut sister came up and she said brother isaiah she said i heard you talking about brother elvin's car i saw no oh we we were all devil you ain't trouble now i said sister going with your chest tomorrow she said i got a good friend of mine somebody stole her camper you know what i did i said such a hole right there i went somewhere i did an old pentecostal shout because god was getting ready to move some of you wait till hey man i shot way man hey man i shout when it's coming i shout when it's gone i said sister what is your name she's a brother she said i believe i know first of all i said do you believe do you agree she said yes yes i agree i said well sister for the mo your faith is so elevated i said i don't even have to pray for you i said your faith is so great i said you go away and i said tristan i don't know when that's camper is coming back but it's coming back why because god can't not lie a few weeks later my wife and i was in the church amen doing some work in the church my wife looking through a phone amen and she said isaiah come here and i came i said oh my goodness you're great i said oh lord i said let me call brother this past day man and i called the pastor and he said brother isaiah he said i don't know he said but he said i got some good news to tell you he said a sister that said she couldn't breathe she had cover 19. oh y'all hear it man she had covar 19 amen somebody said you got covenant t what i'm going to do that for yes i know where i'm going i don't have to fear death definitely not but a horse and buggy to take me to another dimension amen i ain't afraid of death i'm like paul said oh death where is your stay great where is your victory i ain't worrying about paul said come on bring the knife cut my head off already i see my theophany huh

africa and 150 people hit the floor everybody went down preachers and everybody now the same god is here but my wife told the brother he said i don't know if that's the system with the camper see i believe this message was all my heart i believe there's another son of god get a hole to it i believe it's another daughter of god get hold you and it catch that same fate it'll do the same thing so that sister went away and the pastor told me he said his sister went to the doctor the other day and he died they test her said he couldn't find a traits of cancer so the sister that when i first preached that amen the sister was walking out and i said my sister i said mine i said god healed you she said yes brother she said brother isaac she said when your feet hit the floor she said my whole body stopped trembling you know why because the devil knew that a the son of god had supernatural faith glory to god boy i feel my beard growing now i don't have to take a shade tonight yes let me
