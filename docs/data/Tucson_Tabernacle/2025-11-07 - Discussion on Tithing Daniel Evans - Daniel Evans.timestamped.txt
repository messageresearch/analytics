[0:00] He's a winner.
[0:02] &gt;&gt; He's never lost a battle.
[0:05] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that he's I don't know if I
[0:08] should say I'm on his side or he's on my
[0:10] side. I think it'd be better maybe to
[0:12] say he's on my side because there's been
[0:14] been many times I wasn't on his side.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; But he's always been on my side.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Our Father,
[0:24] Lord, you're in heaven now
[0:27] and we pray that your will would be done
[0:29] here on earth as it is [music] in
[0:31] heaven.
[0:32] Lord, we love you and we thank you for
[0:34] the opportunity once again to gather
[0:36] together.
[0:37] And Lord, pray that as I answer these
[0:40] questions, Lord, that the wisdom of the
[0:43] Holy Spirit would be upon me.
[0:46] And father that we would leave here more
[0:48] knowledgeable and more understanding of
[0:50] your word in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You
[0:54] can be seated. God bless you.
[0:59] Brother Joe,
[1:01] which one is this?
[1:02] &gt;&gt; That's my handsome one. Stephen,
[1:05] &gt;&gt; look at you with the haircut. Brother
[1:08] Stephen, you look good. God bless you.
[1:10] Good to see you. Haven't seen you in a
[1:12] little while. Good to see you. God bless
[1:13] you. [applause]
[1:17] I got my haircut and uh everybody laughs
[1:22] when I talk about anything on my hair.
[1:24] Um
[1:26] &gt;&gt; yeah, [laughter]
[1:27] right. Uh it feels good. It feels good
[1:30] to be in the house of the Lord tonight.
[1:32] Um I wanted to continue on a little bit
[1:36] with the sermon this morning.
[1:39] And I mentioned um about social media
[1:43] and I mentioned about saying things on
[1:46] social media and then sharing those
[1:49] things and even commenting on those
[1:51] things on YouTube. And I I mentioned
[1:53] this one pastor was I I heard him
[1:57] commenting about some things that were
[2:00] being said
[2:02] um about um
[2:04] just about the pastor of the Bram
[2:06] Tabernacle, Joseph Brandom, and
[2:10] uh calling him names. And you know, you
[2:13] may not agree and we may not agree, but
[2:17] what in the world are we doing insulting
[2:21] each other on either side? That is
[2:24] nothing but childish.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; And yet we lift ourselves up to be the
[2:28] bride of Christ.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; And we say things on both sides that are
[2:32] demeaning and really just ridiculous.
[2:36] And friends, I say that we never we
[2:39] should never insult each other. And
[2:42] sometimes it there is place for rebuke.
[2:45] Paul publicly rebuked certain people.
[2:49] You can still read it in your Bible
[2:52] where Paul called out people by name.
[2:55] There's nothing wrong with that. But
[2:57] when we call when we insult or when we
[3:01] call names or when we say someone has an
[3:03] antichrist spirit,
[3:06] even if it's like I said this morning,
[3:08] even if it's the pope, come on. Don't do
[3:12] it. That is lowering ourselves to a
[3:16] place that is beneath us. So friends, I
[3:20] don't think that we should ever do that.
[3:21] Never. I think we should uplift uplift
[3:24] people. There is a place for correction.
[3:26] I mean, I brought a lot of correction
[3:28] this morning about how we need to be
[3:30] careful in sharing posts and saying
[3:34] things. I said that and and I I mean it.
[3:37] So there is a place for correction. And
[3:39] there's a place for correcting error,
[3:41] but there is no place for insults. Jesus
[3:45] said, "Call no man Raqqa."
[3:48] The word raqa, I've heard a different a
[3:51] few different translations for it, but
[3:54] it's an insult.
[3:56] And Jesus said, "Don't do it or you're
[3:59] in danger of hell, really." So, we
[4:01] should be careful. Social media is a
[4:04] it's a scary thing. Uh, Sister Andreana
[4:07] shared with me a a post that uh has
[4:12] happened over the is it the past few
[4:13] weeks, past couple weeks? P started
[4:17] Friday night and it was so it was shared
[4:20] Friday night and it's Olivia, your
[4:22] children's school district
[4:24] and uh it's it started in a small
[4:28] Facebook community. If uh um Abby, could
[4:31] you put that picture up there? This
[4:33] picture right here. And what it is is um
[4:38] it's some some teachers and they have
[4:40] this shirt on that's obviously meant to
[4:44] look like blood stain on the left side
[4:49] of their shirt.
[4:51] And the first thing that we think of is
[4:55] what many
[4:57] education
[5:00] related
[5:02] professions are taking a stand against
[5:04] this man Charlie Kirk. He was shot on
[5:06] the left side. He bled out on the left
[5:08] side. And here we have a bunch of
[5:10] teachers up there with a shirt that has
[5:14] blood poured down on the left side and
[5:16] it says problem solved. Wow.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Absolutely horrible. Horrible. Am I
[5:24] right? And this starts being shared
[5:28] and it started in a small Facebook
[5:30] community
[5:32] and then it went viral on Tik Tok, went
[5:35] viral on YouTube, went viral on
[5:37] Instagram, different social media
[5:39] platforms. If you go to the next
[5:41] picture, already and quickly rebuked by
[5:44] even the Arizona House of
[5:46] Representatives. They write a letter
[5:49] rebuking what this was, saying, "We do
[5:53] not stand for this
[5:57] and
[6:00] telling the people basically that these
[6:04] people making fun of the death of
[6:05] Charlie Kirk is an absolute, my words,
[6:08] an apostasy."
[6:12] However,
[6:15] however,
[6:18] go back to the previous picture.
[6:24] The picture of that one. Let me read
[6:27] what was said to sister Andreana.
[6:31] Dear Veil, parents and families,
[6:34] remember this is this is ten, thousand
[6:37] th thousands and thousands tens of
[6:39] thousands
[6:41] of of shares and and comments about this
[6:45] death threats
[6:47] to the school district for them making
[6:51] this stand.
[6:54] Here's a letter Sister Andrea re
[6:56] received when when did you receive it?
[6:59] Yesterday. Dear Veil parents and
[7:02] families, we're writing you to inform
[7:04] you about a situation that has been
[7:06] circulating on social media involving
[7:08] members of Sienna High School math
[7:10] department.
[7:12] A photo
[7:15] showing teachers wearing shirts that say
[7:17] problem solved
[7:19] has caused confusion and concern. We
[7:22] want to clarify that these shirts were
[7:24] part of a math themed Halloween costume
[7:26] meant to represent solving tough math
[7:28] math problems. The shirts were never
[7:30] intended to target any person, event, or
[7:32] political issue. Unfortunately, the
[7:35] image is being shared online with false
[7:37] claims that they were intended as a
[7:39] statement of recent events in our
[7:41] country, referring to Charlie Kirk. This
[7:43] is unequivocally untrue. The shirts were
[7:46] purchased online and were also worn last
[7:49] year as part of the same math themed
[7:52] costume long before the recent events.
[7:56] For anyone questioning the validity of
[7:59] those shirts were questioning
[8:02] questioning the validity that these
[8:03] shirts were worn last year, I'm happy to
[8:05] provide you with a with a photo. We
[8:09] understand how this image could be
[8:11] misunderstood and taken out of context,
[8:13] especially by people who are not
[8:14] associated with the teachers or school.
[8:17] We are truly sorry for the hurt or upset
[8:20] it is it has caused
[8:23] it has caused. The teachers involved
[8:26] care deeply about their students and
[8:27] community. Many have served Veil Veil
[8:30] family for years and many of them and
[8:32] all of them are committed to our
[8:33] children and none of them would and then
[8:35] it cuts off but none of them would do
[8:37] anything like this.
[8:40] Do you see
[8:42] taking a a picture like this? I mean,
[8:46] it's Halloween, so it's like I mean,
[8:48] it's a bit ill- advised as far as having
[8:51] a bloody shirt, but it was referring to
[8:53] a math problem. Problem solved. And it's
[8:57] a Halloween costume, so they have blood.
[9:01] Last year,
[9:03] people saw this and they made the jump
[9:07] to saying that they're making fun of
[9:09] Charlie Kirk.
[9:12] Death threats.
[9:14] I mean, this right here, this post, uh,
[9:17] at the bottom of that one, I Yeah, right
[9:19] at the top, it says, "Fire them all."
[9:22] Taken out of context and misconstrued.
[9:25] Do you see how powerful our words are?
[9:28] It could ruin these people's lives.
[9:31] And that's
[9:33] um that's the dangers right there. So I
[9:37] I wanted to wanted to continue on with
[9:39] that. I wanted to mention that. Thank
[9:40] you. You can take it down. Not the best
[9:43] choice in shirts, you know,
[9:47] but certainly not didn't have the wrong
[9:50] intentions there. Um, I wanted to I want
[9:53] to talk about tithing and I want to talk
[9:54] about a one question that I received and
[9:56] this one will be a short answer and uh
[10:00] this one I just got um a few days ago.
[10:02] It says why don't we stand for the word
[10:04] of God? I assume that the question means
[10:08] why don't we um when I am ministering I
[10:12] probably about 70% of the time I will
[10:16] pray and then have the congregation
[10:18] seated. The reason I do that is because
[10:22] it's just my style of ministry is I want
[10:25] to greet the people that are here and I
[10:29] want to say a few words. And my ministry
[10:34] is a whole lot of reading the Bible.
[10:38] So, I'm not going to have you stand
[10:40] through my whole sermon. It just it
[10:43] wouldn't it wouldn't work. Um many
[10:46] churches have the tradition of the
[10:50] pastor taking the pulpit and then remain
[10:55] standing and reading a scripture and
[10:57] then going into the sermon which is a
[11:00] great tradition. I think it's very
[11:01] respectful in standing for the word. I I
[11:04] don't think there's anything wrong with
[11:05] it. I can there's there's places in the
[11:07] Bible like in I think it's Ezra where
[11:10] when Ezra opened up the book of Moses
[11:14] all the people stood
[11:17] &gt;&gt; for the in respect of the word and I
[11:19] think it's very very it's very
[11:21] respectful thing to do but then there's
[11:23] other places in the Bible when they sat
[11:26] so it's with and then I think with a
[11:31] message mentality
[11:34] many People may remember the quote that
[11:37] brother Brandham said, "We stand for the
[11:38] flag being raised. We stand for other
[11:40] things. We can stand for the word."
[11:42] However,
[11:44] very rarely did Brother Brandham have
[11:46] people stand for reading the Bible.
[11:49] And I'd say, I just did a quick search.
[11:52] Maybe 10% of the time, maybe he did
[11:55] that.
[11:56] Most of the time he did it like I do it.
[12:00] He prayed and then had them seated and
[12:02] then he talked for a little while before
[12:03] he got into his sermon and didn't have
[12:05] them stand again. So, um, and I think we
[12:09] have to be careful
[12:10] with tradition.
[12:13] If we get too involved in tradition,
[12:16] even if it's a good tradition, in
[12:17] standing in reverence and and and doing
[12:20] um doing the same thing over and over,
[12:23] there is nothing wrong with me taking
[12:25] the platform,
[12:27] praying, opening my Bible, and reading a
[12:31] scripture and then saying, uh, be
[12:33] seated. Nothing wrong at all with it.
[12:36] However,
[12:38] if we do that every time
[12:41] and you know kids, the people grow up in
[12:44] this church
[12:46] and you go to another church that
[12:50] doesn't do that.
[12:52] It's human nature because it's
[12:55] different. You're going to think it's
[12:57] wrong
[12:59] just because that's the that's your
[13:00] tradition. That's the way you've done
[13:01] it. And I think we have to be careful in
[13:03] doing that. Just because we do it over
[13:05] and over does not make it right.
[13:10] It just is what we do. It's just a
[13:13] tradition. It doesn't make it wrong.
[13:16] But we have to be careful in that
[13:19] mindset of thinking that
[13:22] because I grew up a certain way
[13:25] or like I said this morning about just
[13:27] because we hear something over and over
[13:29] again,
[13:31] it makes it to where we think that
[13:33] that's what's what's the right way in
[13:36] our minds and it might not be the right
[13:37] way. With me, it's and it's just it's my
[13:42] personality. It's the way that I am. I
[13:46] don't like to do the same thing over and
[13:48] over again. I like change
[13:53] and and I see everybody's faces. It's
[13:56] like, hey, we're going to start doing a
[13:57] construction project over here. Like,
[13:59] oh, what is he going to do next? Messing
[14:02] up everything again. [laughter]
[14:05] It's just friends, change is part of it.
[14:10] And I know that most people are not
[14:13] comfortable with change. I understand
[14:15] that. But sometimes we have to change to
[14:19] grow in the Lord. Okay. So, I wanted to
[14:23] uh so why don't we stand for the word of
[14:25] God? Um
[14:28] it's just not the way I do it. I do it
[14:30] sometimes. Um but it's just not the way
[14:33] I minister. It is the way brother Lyall
[14:35] ministers. He usually does that. Um
[14:38] Brother Null did that the other night
[14:41] and I like it. It's good.
[14:45] But it's not a must. We don't have to do
[14:48] it that way. Okay. So, that's that's uh
[14:52] my answer to that question. So, now
[14:55] tithing.
[14:57] Uh there's three things. I'm going to go
[15:00] through a bunch of scriptures. There's
[15:02] three things that uh by the way um for
[15:04] the visitors, I've been going through uh
[15:07] the um some questions that the
[15:10] congregation asks. And um one of the
[15:13] questions that I've received multiple um
[15:16] notes on is how do we tithe? What is the
[15:19] proper way to tithe?
[15:21] And
[15:24] as I read these scriptures, as always, I
[15:26] want to get every all my answers from
[15:28] the Bible. As I read these scriptures, I
[15:31] want you to remember three things. The
[15:34] first thing is God is first.
[15:38] That goes for tithing and that goes for
[15:40] every aspect of our lives. God is first.
[15:43] The second is tithing is not a business
[15:47] contract with God.
[15:49] You don't tithe so you can receive. All
[15:52] right?
[15:54] You you don't tithe as in prosperity
[15:57] gospel that you can become rich.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; You laugh. That's a very very common
[16:06] thing.
[16:09] Brother Joe says you're sure. I'm going
[16:10] to look how much and see how much you
[16:11] tie.
[16:13] [laughter]
[16:16] &gt;&gt; I'm just kidding. By the way, I have no
[16:18] I have no idea how much anyone does.
[16:21] [laughter] I'm not privy to that
[16:22] information, nor do I want to be.
[16:25] There's there is one time that I will
[16:27] ask if someone tithes, and that is if
[16:31] there's a problem in the church and
[16:33] someone needs help, I will ask the
[16:35] trustees, does this person pay tithe? I
[16:37] don't care how much but if they do then
[16:42] I I feel like the church they are part
[16:44] of the church and the church has more
[16:45] responsibility for them as I said I
[16:47] could care I don't know how much anyone
[16:49] does and I don't know who does the only
[16:51] time I will ask is in that certain
[16:53] situation
[16:55] um so so the first thing is God is first
[16:58] the second thing is you don't tithe so
[17:01] you can receive listen Jesus Christ died
[17:03] on the cross
[17:05] and he gave you something that you could
[17:07] never repay. Tithing is just honoring
[17:11] his word to provide a place for uh to
[17:14] serve God here in this church. With that
[17:18] said, that there there are blessings
[17:19] with tithing. And then tithing, the
[17:22] third thing is tithing is an honor and
[17:25] it should be something that we want to
[17:26] do.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; All right. So the the the first thing as
[17:31] I was putting this together this
[17:32] afternoon, God is first. Tithing is not
[17:35] a business contract with God. And
[17:38] tithing is an honor and it's something
[17:40] that we should want to do. First, let's
[17:42] define tithing. We we use that word so
[17:45] often u but it has a very um it has a
[17:50] very specific meaning. There are places
[17:52] in the Bible where uh that where portion
[17:56] was given to God was 10%. There's other
[17:59] places in the Bible where that portion
[18:01] was 20%. That I found. And then there's
[18:04] one place that I found that it seems
[18:06] that that portion was 30%.
[18:09] However, the definition of tithing is
[18:13] 10%.
[18:15] Is a tenth. That's what the word means.
[18:18] All right, let's go to Genesis. I'm
[18:20] sorry I didn't give you any scripture
[18:22] verses. There's a lot of them. So, just
[18:25] Is it you, Abby? Just try to keep up.
[18:28] Genesis chapter 14, verse 19. I'm going
[18:31] to read the New King James Version.
[18:34] Then Melzdc Genesis 14:19 Then Melzdc
[18:38] king of Salem brought out bread and
[18:40] wine. He was the priest of the most high
[18:43] and he blessed them and said, "Blessed
[18:44] be Abram of God most high, possessor of
[18:48] heaven and earth. And blessed be God
[18:50] most high who has delivered your enemies
[18:53] into your hands." Now Abraham is coming
[18:56] from the the slaughter of the kings
[19:00] and he he had he had taken the bounty
[19:04] and he gave him a tithe of all is the
[19:09] next verse.
[19:10] Uh verse number 20. And he gave them
[19:13] tithes of all is what the King James
[19:15] says.
[19:16] Many translations I'd say about half of
[19:19] them say one10enth of all.
[19:24] Both translations are correct. The word
[19:28] tithing simply means a tenth.
[19:31] All right? So when you say that I tithe
[19:35] 20%, no tithing is 10%.
[19:39] So you tithe 10% and then you give
[19:42] another 10% extra. But the very word
[19:46] tithing means 10 means one/tenth.
[19:49] And the uh one of the questions that
[19:53] probably the most common question
[19:56] received that I've received over the
[19:57] years on tithing is do I do I pay on
[20:00] gross or net as far as my income? And
[20:04] [sighs] basically, do I pay after my
[20:06] taxes have been taken out or before? I
[20:09] always lean towards paying on the gross
[20:12] because I think that we put God's God
[20:15] first. But really, I always
[20:20] want to make those type of things up to
[20:23] the individual. You know, your own
[20:25] personal situation.
[20:27] You know what you're capable of doing
[20:29] and what you're not capable of doing.
[20:31] But as a minister, I would encourage
[20:36] I encourage you to study it, but it
[20:39] looks very much to me like the gross
[20:42] number is the proper tithing number. But
[20:45] again,
[20:46] I I leave that to you and to for you to
[20:49] pray about it and you to make your
[20:50] decision on that. God first. All right,
[20:54] that's our first. We want to put God
[20:55] first. Let's go to Malachi 3:8. You
[20:57] know, it's really neat. We talked about
[20:59] divorce and we went into the book of
[21:01] Malachi and it really gave us our
[21:02] answer. And now we're going to go to
[21:04] tithing and it's going to give us our
[21:06] answer again.
[21:10] Do you remember the book of Malachi?
[21:12] It's a really really interesting book
[21:16] and it's a dialogue between God and man.
[21:20] And what was happening
[21:23] were was the people of Israel,
[21:27] they were putting God last. So maybe in
[21:31] their tithing, they were saying that,
[21:33] "Oh, I have uh it takes me $50,000 a
[21:37] year to live. I make $52,000.
[21:40] So, I will uh let's see, we have $2,000
[21:43] extra. We'll pay tithing on that because
[21:46] that's what I have extra. Or, and this
[21:49] was specifically mentioned, they have a
[21:51] flock of sheep and they say, "Okay,
[21:54] well, these uh I I see this sheep over
[21:56] here. It's kind of deformed. It's not a
[21:58] very good-looking one. I couldn't sell
[21:59] this one for very much at the market.
[22:01] I'm gonna take that lamb and I'm going
[22:04] to give that one to God because I can
[22:07] spare that one. And the book of Malachi
[22:11] is just back and forth with this
[22:13] dialogue and they're saying, "Well, how
[22:15] have we cheated you? How have we done
[22:17] these things?" And he's pointing out
[22:19] that, "Hey, you listen, you're giving me
[22:21] the worst.
[22:23] You should be giving God the best." So
[22:25] Malachi chapter 3 verse number eight it
[22:30] says this will a man rob God here's the
[22:33] dialogue
[22:36] yet you have robbed me
[22:39] but you say in what way have we robbed
[22:43] you in tithes and offerings
[22:47] two things remember tithing is 10%
[22:50] offering is also there you are cursed
[22:54] with the curse, for you have robbed me,
[22:56] even this whole nation.
[22:59] Bring all the tithes into the
[23:01] storehouse, that there may be food in my
[23:04] house.
[23:06] Now, into the storehouse, friends,
[23:10] we when you bring tithes in and when you
[23:13] pay your tithes here to the church, it
[23:16] comes in into
[23:18] um the fund that pays for everything. It
[23:22] pays for if there's renovations that
[23:24] need to be done. It It pays for the
[23:25] electricity. It It pays for any type of
[23:28] rent. It It pays for the instrument in
[23:30] instruments. It pays for everything that
[23:32] we do. All of that doesn't just come out
[23:36] of thin air. It comes from us giving.
[23:39] And that's how a church functions. And
[23:41] that's why it says here, "Bring these
[23:43] tiths
[23:45] that that there may be food in my
[23:47] house."
[23:49] It's saying that support the church with
[23:51] your tithes so then that church can in
[23:54] turn support you and support others.
[23:58] And try me now on this, says the Lord of
[24:00] hosts, if I will not open for you the
[24:04] windows of heaven and pour out for you
[24:07] such blessings
[24:09] that there will not be room enough to
[24:12] receive it.
[24:14] Now, I want to stop there for a moment.
[24:19] This is not, as I said, this isn't a
[24:21] deal with God.
[24:23] You don't pay tithe so you can get rich.
[24:26] Prosperity gospel says if you give, if
[24:28] somebody will give a $100, you'll get
[24:30] $1,000 with a certain return. If
[24:31] somebody gives a,000, it'll be 10,000
[24:33] and all of that. That's notice he's not
[24:35] talking about, he doesn't say money.
[24:38] He says you're bringing your tithes in,
[24:40] but he says that you are going to
[24:42] receive blessings
[24:45] from this. And I'll get to that in a
[24:48] little bit later. And I will rebuke the
[24:50] devourer for your sakes, so that he will
[24:52] not destroy the fruit of your ground,
[24:55] nor shall the vine, nor shall the vine
[24:58] to bear fruit for you in the field, says
[25:00] the Lord of Hosts. and all nations will
[25:02] call you blessed for you will be a
[25:05] delight land says the Lord of hosts
[25:09] sayaeth the Lord of hosts.
[25:12] So he's saying that you're going to be
[25:14] blessed. God's saying to put him first
[25:17] and he always says this. This isn't just
[25:20] in tithing. The scripture isn't just
[25:22] about just giving tithes. The scriptur
[25:24] is about everything in our lives. If we
[25:27] will put God's first, God first in our
[25:29] decisions,
[25:31] &gt;&gt; we'll be blessed by it.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; Last week, we talked about Malachi and
[25:36] how God listens to our conversations
[25:38] with our wives in our private rooms.
[25:42] Put God first in your relationships
[25:46] and he'll bless you. Put God first in
[25:49] your job and he will bless you. Put God
[25:52] first in your tithing and he will open
[25:55] for you the windows of heaven and pour
[25:58] out for you such a blessing that there
[26:00] will not be room enough to receive it.
[26:03] All right? He might not be talking about
[26:05] money, but put God first in your tithing
[26:09] and you your life will be better. All
[26:13] right?
[26:16] I mentioned about working out your
[26:19] finances.
[26:21] Don't work out your finances and say,
[26:23] "Okay, we have this much to give to the
[26:25] church." All right? Maybe with offerings
[26:27] you do that, but with tithing, put him
[26:30] first.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; All right? Take that out first. Genesis
[26:35] chapter 28 verse 20. Let's read this.
[26:37] This is really good.
[26:40] This is Jacob.
[26:43] And he had this vision.
[26:46] Then Jacob rose early in the morning.
[26:52] And Jacob rose early in the morning
[26:55] and took the stone that he had put at
[26:57] his head and set it set it up as a
[26:59] pillar and poured oil on top of it. And
[27:02] he called the name of that place Bethl.
[27:08] And he called the name of that place
[27:09] Bethl. But the name of that city had
[27:12] become had had been loosed previously.
[27:15] Then Jacob made a vow, saying, 'If God
[27:17] will be with me and keep me in this way
[27:21] that I am going, and give me bread to
[27:24] eat and clothing to put on so that I
[27:26] come back to my father's house in peace,
[27:29] then the Lord shall be my God." Now,
[27:31] Jacob isn't making a deal with God right
[27:34] here. He's saying, "If God will give me
[27:36] a job to support myself, then I'll be
[27:41] able to return it."
[27:44] Then then the Lord shall be my God. And
[27:46] this stone which I have set which have
[27:49] set as a pillar shall be God's house
[27:51] shall be God's house. And all and of all
[27:55] that you give me
[27:58] I will surely give a tenth to you.
[28:03] Very very important thing says here and
[28:06] of all that thou shalt give me.
[28:11] So Jacob is saying that everything that
[28:14] I have, my job, my money, my donkeys,
[28:19] everything that I have, you gave me. It
[28:24] was yours in the first place and you
[28:26] gave it to me. And everything that I
[28:29] have that you gave me, now I will give a
[28:33] tenth to you.
[28:37] So basically paying tithes, paying a
[28:39] tenth on everything that God has given.
[28:44] Notice that the the vow
[28:50] he's not making a deal with God. He's
[28:53] saying that like you young people when
[28:55] you get a job, Justin, when when you
[28:58] when you get a career and you get set,
[29:00] you say, "Lord, if you give me a job,
[29:02] I'll pay my tithes. But if you don't
[29:05] have a job, you can't pay your tithe
[29:06] because you don't have any money coming
[29:08] in. All right? This isn't like a um some
[29:13] sort of a deal where if you give me
[29:14] more, I I'll I'll um if I give more,
[29:18] then I'll get more.
[29:20] And then one of the questions that we
[29:21] often get is that tithing is not
[29:24] mentioned in the New Testament. So
[29:26] therefore, we shouldn't tithe.
[29:29] And that that question has come quite a
[29:31] bit or you should give. But tithing is
[29:34] not necessarily ne that not necessary.
[29:38] And really some things don't need to be
[29:40] said. Some things Jesus didn't have to
[29:43] say because it's said so much in the Old
[29:46] Testament and tithing is all through the
[29:48] Old Testament and we should know that
[29:50] we're supposed to do this. Just common
[29:52] sense tells us that we're supposed to.
[29:55] But with tithing, it actually is in the
[29:57] New Testament. And I'll give you a
[29:58] place. Matthew chapter 23:23.
[30:02] Now listen to this.
[30:05] Matthew 23:23. This is for the people
[30:08] that say that tithing is not in the New
[30:11] Testament.
[30:12] Woe to you scribes and Pharisees,
[30:15] hypocrites.
[30:20] For Jesus was straight. These were
[30:23] selfrighteous people. And and he's like,
[30:26] "Listen, you guys are hypocrites." And I
[30:30] was talking with somebody the other day
[30:32] about how Jesus,
[30:35] he was he was very kind and he loved the
[30:39] self-righteous people. He loved them
[30:42] just as much as he did the the woman
[30:44] that washed his feet with her hair. He
[30:47] loved them all. And he loved these
[30:49] proud,
[30:51] egotistical,
[30:53] self-righteous people. He loved them.
[30:58] And it looks like the way the only way
[31:00] that he could get through them is to
[31:02] really hit them and say, "Listen, you
[31:05] think you're all that, but you're a
[31:07] hypocrite.
[31:09] Wo you scribes and Pharisees
[31:10] hypocrites."
[31:14] He's trying to lead them to the Lord
[31:15] here. He's trying to lead him to
[31:17] himself. For you pay tithe of mint and
[31:20] annis and coming and cumin and have
[31:23] neglected the weightier matters of the
[31:25] law, justice and mercy and faith.
[31:30] All right, here's the key. These you
[31:34] ought to have done
[31:36] without leaving the others undone.
[31:39] So he's saying you're paying tithe. You
[31:42] should have done that. So he's agreeing
[31:44] with paying tithe, but he's saying, "But
[31:47] you're leaving the other stuff undone,
[31:49] the the bigger, more important things.
[31:51] You're leaving that undone, and you're
[31:53] just going through the rituals.
[31:57] So let's let's get now let's go to the
[32:00] prosperity gospel."
[32:02] And there are blessings associated with
[32:05] giving,
[32:06] just as there's blessings associated
[32:08] with prayer, blessings associated with
[32:09] going to church, blessings associated
[32:11] with repentance.
[32:13] But
[32:16] there is nothing that we can do. There's
[32:19] nothing that we can bring to the table
[32:20] to barter barter with God. John 3:16
[32:25] says, "For God so loved the world that
[32:26] he gave his only begotten son that
[32:30] whoever believes in him should not
[32:31] perish but shall have
[32:33] life, everlasting life, eternal life."
[32:36] There's no, we could never pay for that.
[32:39] We could never enter an agreement enter
[32:41] into an agreement with God saying that
[32:44] well if I give this then you'll give
[32:46] this listen he gave everything and we
[32:49] have nothing to give.
[32:52] So, you hear pastors, you hear
[32:53] preachers, and I've heard them over the
[32:55] years calling on the people. He said,
[32:56] "The Lord," many of they've said, "The
[32:58] Lord is is telling me that somebody is
[33:00] supposed to give a $1,000 or or brother,
[33:03] if you give $1,000 and God's going to
[33:05] reward your business, or he's going to
[33:07] double the size of your income next
[33:10] year." That's not right.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; When you give tithing or a gift, then
[33:17] you no longer have that gift. you no
[33:20] longer have that tithing. It was given
[33:22] as a sacrifice to the Lord, not as a
[33:24] business deal with God, not to not to
[33:26] promote yourself or prosper yourself.
[33:28] It's got to be a sacrifice.
[33:33] It's got to be something that hurts a
[33:35] little bit. It's got to be something
[33:37] that like in Malachi, don't give the
[33:41] lamb that's not worth anything. Give him
[33:44] your very best lamb.
[33:47] And that's that's with this ting. And
[33:49] I've seen the mistake over and over
[33:51] through the years. And even I've had
[33:54] family members
[33:56] say that, you know, I want to be rich or
[33:59] I want to prosper. So they'll give
[34:02] everything that they have to the church
[34:05] with the expectation that they're going
[34:07] to
[34:09] be even more have even more later on. Or
[34:12] they they'll they'll sell their house
[34:14] and they'll give the the the money to
[34:16] the church. While that might show a lot
[34:19] of faith, it doesn't show any wisdom.
[34:22] Now, you don't have a house and you've
[34:24] given all your wealth away for really
[34:26] for personal gain because you think
[34:28] you're going to get more. It's like
[34:29] buying a lottery ticket. That's not
[34:31] right. But I've seen people I have seen
[34:34] people do this make these foolish
[34:37] decisions in giving everything that they
[34:41] have because oh
[34:46] maybe 1977 is coming
[34:50] selling all that they have
[34:53] and preparing for that like I said has a
[34:56] lot of faith but no wisdom
[34:58] or
[35:00] that uh they might
[35:03] have some financial trouble. So, I think
[35:05] that I'm just going to give everything
[35:07] that I have and then the Lord will get
[35:10] me out of that financial trouble. The
[35:11] Lord didn't he did not require you to
[35:14] give everything. He requires you to give
[35:16] 10%.
[35:18] And offerings on top of that.
[35:23] So, when you give to God really, you no
[35:25] longer have what you gave or it wouldn't
[35:27] be a gift. It wouldn't be a sacrifice.
[35:31] And friends, for those who haven't paid
[35:33] tithe in years or or never have paid
[35:36] tithe and are just coming to church and
[35:39] you can't make ends meet now, start
[35:42] giving now. That would be my best advice
[35:46] is you say, "Well, I've never done this
[35:48] and and I don't have the money." Start
[35:51] with something.
[35:53] Start giving. G give what you can. Start
[35:57] today. really work your way up to 10% if
[36:01] you have to, but it's better than not
[36:02] doing anything. So try
[36:07] and then instead of making tithing your
[36:10] last priority, now make it your first
[36:12] priority.
[36:14] Proverbs 3:9 says this,
[36:18] "Honor the Lord with your possessions
[36:21] and with the first fruits of all your
[36:23] increase. So, your barns will be filled
[36:26] with plenty and your vats will overflow
[36:28] with new wine.
[36:31] The key word there
[36:34] is um
[36:39] the uh barn shall be filled with plenty
[36:41] and thy presses shall burst out with
[36:43] with new wine.
[36:46] Go to verse nine. Could you go to the
[36:47] previous verse?
[36:49] Yeah, there we go. Honor the Lord with
[36:51] thy substance and with the first fruits
[36:54] of all thine increase. The first fruits.
[36:57] You know what the first fruits are? It's
[36:59] the first things that come ripe in your
[37:01] crops. So you take the first that you
[37:04] have and you give that to God. Right
[37:07] there it says honor him with the first
[37:09] verse. Go first. Put him first. Take
[37:11] what you have first and ma and make make
[37:14] that what you give make that your
[37:17] offering to the Lord your tithing to the
[37:18] Lord initially and then he'll bless you.
[37:23] He promised don't worry about it. How
[37:26] many
[37:28] I mean especially
[37:30] the older folks
[37:34] you know that you've paid your tithes
[37:36] all these years and you've always had
[37:37] what you needed.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Am I right?
[37:40] You have the Lord's always provided. We
[37:43] have done all our small part and he does
[37:46] his big part.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Now in closing the last part, it's a
[37:53] blessing to pay tithes. And really it
[37:56] should be something that you want to do.
[37:57] Let's go to 2 Chronicles 31:4.
[38:05] 2 Chronicles 31 verse4. Again, I'm
[38:09] reading the New King James version. We
[38:10] have the Old King James up there. 2
[38:13] Chronicles 31:4 says this. Moreover, he
[38:17] commanded the people who dwelt in
[38:19] Jerusalem to contribute support for the
[38:21] priests and the Levites that they might
[38:23] devote themselves to the law of the
[38:25] Lord. As soon as the commandment was
[38:27] circulated, the children of Israel
[38:29] brought in abundance
[38:31] the first fruits
[38:34] of grain and wine, oil, and honey, and
[38:36] of all the produce of the field. And
[38:38] they brought in abundantly the tithe of
[38:40] everything. Tithe is 10% of everything.
[38:43] And the children of Israel and Judah who
[38:46] dwelt in the cities of Judah brought the
[38:48] tithe of the oxen and sheep also the
[38:51] tithe of the holy things which were
[38:52] consecrated to the to the Lord their
[38:55] God. They laid in heaps.
[38:58] So the people gave willingly here and it
[39:02] was a blessing to give. So much so that
[39:05] that really that many times throughout
[39:08] the Bible, one of them I believe was
[39:10] with this priest named Jehoida. They
[39:13] needed money to renovate the church, to
[39:15] renovate the temple. So he took a box
[39:17] and he bored a hole in it and put it in
[39:19] the back. And he said, "That's going to
[39:21] be used for the renovation of the
[39:23] church." And the people gave freely so
[39:27] much so that he was constantly dumping
[39:28] the money out of it and putting it back.
[39:31] And the people wanted to give.
[39:34] And that was the spirit of the people.
[39:36] They it was an honor for them to give.
[39:39] They gave. They gave freely. In Matthew
[39:42] chapter 25 or chapter 5, we went through
[39:45] this either last week or the week
[39:47] before.
[39:48] Matthew Matthew chapter 5 verse 23.
[39:52] Listen to this. Jesus is says this.
[39:55] Therefore, if you bring your gift to the
[39:58] altar and there and there remember that
[40:00] your brother has something against you
[40:03] that your brother hath ought against
[40:04] thee, leave your gift there before the
[40:08] altar. Right? He's talking about
[40:10] bringing a gift into the church in
[40:11] giving. Leave your gift there before the
[40:15] altar and go your way. First be
[40:17] reconciled to your brother and then come
[40:20] and offer your gift.
[40:24] So people wanted to give to the church.
[40:26] They thought it was an honor to give,
[40:28] but Jesus forbade it until they made
[40:31] things right with a person that they had
[40:33] offended.
[40:34] It also shows this scripture, brother
[40:38] null, shows that tithing is holy.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; That Jesus is saying don't even give
[40:46] your tithing
[40:48] if you have if someone has ought against
[40:50] you.
[40:53] It shows how holy and important this
[40:57] honor of giving is.
[41:01] I'll close with this.
[41:03] 2 Corinthians
[41:06] 96.
[41:08] The Apostle Paul speaking,
[41:11] he says this,
[41:13] "But this say I." 2 Corinthians 9:6.
[41:17] Thank you. But this say I. He who sws
[41:21] sparingly will also reap sparingly.
[41:25] And he who sws bountifully will also
[41:28] reap bountifully.
[41:31] So let each one give as he purposes in
[41:34] his heart.
[41:37] Very important. That's why a pastor
[41:40] should never get up and try to pull on
[41:42] the people for money.
[41:44] Shouldn't do it. It's not right. Let
[41:47] each one give as he feels to give. Let
[41:52] each one give as he purposes in his
[41:55] heart, not grudging grudgingly or of
[41:59] necessity. Again, not right for the
[42:02] pastor to get up there and say, "You've
[42:04] got to pay your tithe. I'm checking the
[42:06] ledger."
[42:09] No.
[42:10] You present the word to the people and
[42:14] now say, as I as I love to say, it's
[42:17] like, I read it here.
[42:20] Now you take it and apply it to your
[42:22] life
[42:26] &gt;&gt; as the Holy Spirit leads you. So let
[42:29] each one give as he purposes in his
[42:31] heart, not grudgingly or of necessity.
[42:35] For God loves a cheerful giver.
[42:39] And it is it is an honor to be able to
[42:42] give. It's an honor to be able to pay
[42:44] tithes. It's an honor to be able to give
[42:46] an offering on top of our tithes. And
[42:51] one other thing that I would like to
[42:52] address is with our tithes,
[42:57] you don't have control over your
[42:58] tithing.
[43:00] All right? An offering. You might you
[43:02] might come to me and say, "Uh, pastor, I
[43:05] want to sponsor a food program. I want
[43:09] to sponsor the food program next week or
[43:12] something like that." Fine. That's an
[43:13] offering. But when you pay tithing,
[43:16] you don't have control over it.
[43:19] you give it and then you you trust in
[43:22] the leadership of the church and the
[43:24] trustees and you trust in me to spend it
[43:26] in the right way.
[43:28] So I wanted to tell the story quickly
[43:32] about this boy
[43:35] that gave his lunch
[43:38] to Jesus when they didn't have food.
[43:43] He had this lunch. He had some fish and
[43:45] some some crackers and maybe as a bag
[43:50] and he offered this offering.
[43:55] You'll notice he didn't have he had to
[43:59] give it up. He took it and he had to
[44:02] give it to the disciples
[44:05] and say here you take it. And then the
[44:09] disciples brought it to Jesus and it was
[44:11] multiplied. But the key with that story
[44:14] is he had to give it up. It wasn't him
[44:17] that multiplied it. He was the one that
[44:20] provided it, but then the disciples took
[44:24] it and then God gave the increase to it.
[44:29] So again, you're tithing, you're
[44:31] offering, sure, you can direct that. No
[44:33] problem. But you're tithing. No, that
[44:36] comes in to the storehouse and it goes
[44:40] really as the Lord leads there.
[44:43] We together.
