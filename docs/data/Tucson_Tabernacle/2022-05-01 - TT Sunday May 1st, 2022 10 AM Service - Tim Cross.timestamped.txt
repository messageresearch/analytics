[53:30] because of who he is amen
[53:33] we appreciate
[53:35] brother aaron and the saints of the
[53:37] tucson tabernacle
[53:39] welcoming us this morning my family's
[53:41] here with me it's nice to have my wife
[53:43] and a little girl that we're in the
[53:45] process now of adopting we can talk
[53:47] about it it's it's all public it's all
[53:49] legal
[53:50] and uh it's for ordained before the
[53:52] foundation of the world so we're simply
[53:55] stepping into
[53:56] what god saw before time began and uh
[53:59] real nice to have my friend here this
[54:01] morning brother swanson i remember that
[54:04] meeting we had on the platform of bible
[54:06] tabernacle in ruth north carolina i'd
[54:09] heard all these
[54:10] accounts all these reports of this this
[54:13] great singer and i was privileged to be
[54:16] his accompanist that day only organ
[54:18] actually i was on an organ which my wife
[54:20] is
[54:21] an accomplished organist and i more
[54:23] comfortable in 88 keys
[54:25] but you know
[54:27] as a musician
[54:29] your job is to accompany
[54:31] the singer
[54:33] and to complement
[54:35] what they are doing because they are
[54:38] featured if you will and i think you
[54:40] know as christians
[54:41] that's our
[54:43] role is to complement the lord jesus
[54:46] it's all about him
[54:48] he's the great composer
[54:50] he's the great conductor
[54:52] he gave each of us our place
[54:55] in this great symphony that is unfolding
[54:58] and so i want to pay compliment to him
[55:00] most of all this morning and that's why
[55:02] we're here is to honor the resurrection
[55:05] not as a historical event but as an
[55:07] ongoing
[55:09] life that is living and we're witnesses
[55:11] to that not having seen it but having
[55:14] experienced it and so we're giving
[55:16] witness to a resurrected savior and he
[55:19] gives witness to his own word when we
[55:22] come in faith believing and i would
[55:24] challenge your faith this morning by
[55:25] saying whatever you have need of
[55:27] if it's physical if it's spiritual if
[55:29] it's in your body or your soul or your
[55:31] mind
[55:32] just give compliment to him this morning
[55:34] and watch him compliment his own word
[55:37] his own promise and honor your faith and
[55:39] perform the promise of his word you know
[55:42] that's one thing god's a great physician
[55:44] but he's not practicing
[55:45] he's performing
[55:47] amen
[55:48] because he made our bodies he made this
[55:51] earth he made the elements he is our
[55:53] creator our designer our god our king
[55:56] we're giving glory to him this morning
[55:58] and he's getting glory to himself
[56:01] amen i'm preaching already but you know
[56:04] god god referenced pharaoh one time he
[56:06] said i'm going to get me honor
[56:09] upon pharaoh i'm going to use
[56:12] this vile
[56:13] creature of a man
[56:15] to get me honored
[56:17] i said god is using adversity god is
[56:19] using trials god is even using tensions
[56:22] and strife and controversy
[56:24] to place us
[56:26] where he would have us to be that he may
[56:28] be glorified and so i i feel very
[56:31] humbled to have this place behind this
[56:34] sacred desk this morning
[56:35] and as i so often do i feel ill prepared
[56:39] but uh god gives us the pieces many
[56:41] times he doesn't show us the whole
[56:43] puzzle and so we just want to see what
[56:45] he'll what pieces he'll put in place
[56:47] today
[56:48] invite you to take your bibles and turn
[56:50] with me to
[56:51] first kings chapter 19.
[56:54] i want to say it was a real honor to be
[56:55] with you here in february
[56:57] and to be a part of the harmony in the
[56:59] desert and then to speak that sunday
[57:01] morning
[57:02] and i've received some reports of things
[57:05] the lord did in that service
[57:07] that only as eternity unfolds
[57:10] will we perhaps realize what god did in
[57:12] just that one gathering of his people
[57:15] together
[57:16] and we're so thankful to see god
[57:19] just performing his word
[57:21] and performing his promise amongst his
[57:23] people
[57:25] amen i'm i might be bringing my father's
[57:28] day message to you here this morning
[57:30] and so it may be a little premature
[57:33] but um
[57:34] i pray it'll be a blessing to you
[57:36] i want to
[57:38] take for a thought or for a title this
[57:40] morning it's kind of a long title
[57:42] uh but we'll hear the prophet elijah
[57:45] use the term better
[57:47] than my father's
[57:49] and i want to take for a thought or a
[57:51] subject taking on the identity of god
[57:55] through christ
[57:57] the revealed word of the hour
[58:00] and as we approach his word this morning
[58:02] i'd like to invite you to bow your heads
[58:04] in prayer
[58:05] and lift your hand if you have something
[58:07] in your heart you're desiring from the
[58:08] lord this morning and you say lord i
[58:10] want you to speak
[58:12] and i want you to speak to me lord and
[58:14] give me an ear to hear and a heart to
[58:17] receive
[58:19] most gracious and holy god and father
[58:23] you are lifted up
[58:26] this morning
[58:29] in our hearts
[58:30] and in this tabernacle lord that has
[58:33] been set aside as a sanctuary for your
[58:35] children to come
[58:37] and be sheltered
[58:39] so that they can enter into your divine
[58:41] presence
[58:43] lord and be replenished be recharged and
[58:46] be renewed
[58:47] lord as we struggle and we journey
[58:51] through
[58:53] lord the path that you have ordained us
[58:55] to walk in our earthly journey as we
[58:58] lord are crossing that great bridge
[59:02] across the chasm of time and we're
[59:05] nearing
[59:08] the end of that bridge
[59:10] and what i would call the resumption
[59:12] of eternity lord because within each of
[59:15] your children there is an eternal
[59:16] quality that began before there was a
[59:20] creation before there was time and
[59:22] before lord
[59:24] there was a world as we know it now we
[59:26] were there lord as your desire
[59:30] and now here we are fulfilling
[59:33] you're fulfilling your own desire lord
[59:35] in our lives and you're taking us from
[59:38] this
[59:39] realm of time and all lord that sin and
[59:42] corruption and perversion has turned
[59:45] this earth and this creation into you're
[59:47] taking us from that back into the
[59:50] eternity lord that we realized in you
[59:54] lord as job said when the morning stars
[59:57] sang together and the sons of god
[59:59] shouted for joy lord that's why we're
[1:00:03] bound together this morning lord our
[1:00:05] hearts lord an inseparable bond has been
[1:00:08] formed by the holy spirit
[1:00:10] lord a unique connection has been made
[1:00:14] lord because when your words sounded
[1:00:17] lord
[1:00:18] something resounded from within our
[1:00:20] hearts to say amen
[1:00:23] lord not an intellectual amen
[1:00:26] not lord
[1:00:27] theological
[1:00:28] lord not an agreement or a sympathy but
[1:00:32] lord an actual identification lord you
[1:00:35] called you have called the names of the
[1:00:38] elect
[1:00:38] lord through the revealing of your word
[1:00:40] and something in our hearts lord it it
[1:00:43] transcends our minds it it transcends
[1:00:46] lord what we're able to to comprehend
[1:00:48] humanly or intellectually lord but
[1:00:50] something in our lives is saying amen to
[1:00:53] your word and lord that's what we're
[1:00:55] here to say man to this morning lord we
[1:00:57] say amen to the word that says i am the
[1:01:00] lord thy god that healeth all the
[1:01:02] diseases that forgiveth all of thine
[1:01:05] iniquities lord may our lives be the
[1:01:08] amen lord to your prayer on earth lord
[1:01:10] that your children would be joined as
[1:01:13] one here lord inseparably lord despite
[1:01:16] every attempt of satan lord to bring
[1:01:18] division to bring strife lord oh god
[1:01:21] your body lord is an army that's rising
[1:01:24] up father god under the voice of
[1:01:26] prophecy lord you're regathering bone to
[1:01:28] bone lord you're you're standing an army
[1:01:31] up lord that is invincible father god
[1:01:34] under the divine unction of the holy
[1:01:36] spirit
[1:01:37] lord i'm here to yield my vessel to you
[1:01:40] this morning lord these worshippers are
[1:01:42] here each of us are here to yield lord
[1:01:45] to what you would minister through us
[1:01:48] and to us lord in your divine presence
[1:01:51] this morning we bow
[1:01:52] and we give you thanks lord we're
[1:01:55] thanking you for our healing
[1:01:57] we're thanking you for our strength
[1:01:59] we're thanking you for the peace of god
[1:02:01] that passive comprehension of man that's
[1:02:04] beyond what we can understand lord we
[1:02:07] give you thanks and praise and now may
[1:02:09] you break the bread of life to our
[1:02:11] hearts and lord when this service is
[1:02:13] concluded may you be the most memorable
[1:02:18] member of our gathering today may your
[1:02:20] presence here perform lord
[1:02:23] what gives you the honor and the glory
[1:02:26] and what has enabled you to gain the
[1:02:28] reputation that you have
[1:02:30] lord jesus
[1:02:32] further
[1:02:33] your desires in our lives today we ask
[1:02:36] in jesus name
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:39] amen first kings chapter 19 beginning at
[1:02:42] verse 1.
[1:02:46] and ahab told jezebel
[1:02:49] all that elijah had done
[1:02:52] and with all
[1:02:53] how he had slain all the prophets
[1:02:56] with the sword
[1:02:58] you might take note there that
[1:03:01] elijah's not the one who lifted the
[1:03:02] sword
[1:03:04] it was his followers
[1:03:07] that were charged by his message
[1:03:10] but elijah
[1:03:11] got the blame
[1:03:13] and that's okay
[1:03:15] because it was
[1:03:16] the divine action of the holy spirit
[1:03:18] through his lips
[1:03:20] that charged the people
[1:03:22] to take action against the unbelief
[1:03:27] then jezebel sent a messenger unto
[1:03:30] elijah elijah saying
[1:03:32] so let the gods do to me
[1:03:34] and more also
[1:03:37] if i make not thy life as the life of
[1:03:40] one of them
[1:03:42] by tomorrow about this time
[1:03:45] and when he saw that he arose and went
[1:03:47] for his life
[1:03:49] the bible says one translation says he
[1:03:52] ran for his life
[1:03:54] he went for his life and came to
[1:03:56] beersheba which belongeth to judah and
[1:03:58] left his servant there
[1:04:00] but he himself went a day's journey
[1:04:03] into the wilderness and came and sat
[1:04:06] down under a juniper tree
[1:04:09] and he requested for himself that he
[1:04:12] might die
[1:04:14] and said it is enough now oh lord
[1:04:18] take away my life
[1:04:21] for i am not better
[1:04:23] than
[1:04:24] my fathers
[1:04:26] may the lord bless the reading of his
[1:04:28] word
[1:04:29] as you're seated this morning
[1:04:36] i am not
[1:04:38] better
[1:04:39] than my father's
[1:04:42] what a
[1:04:43] sobering realization
[1:04:46] elijah must have come to at this at this
[1:04:48] point at this time in his life in his
[1:04:50] ministry
[1:04:52] and
[1:04:53] after all of the great
[1:04:56] mighty
[1:04:58] powerful things that god had achieved
[1:05:01] through the life and ministry of his
[1:05:02] prophet
[1:05:04] here he has he has reached this place
[1:05:06] where as a man
[1:05:09] he feels that in no way
[1:05:11] is he any better or more significant
[1:05:14] than all of those who have lived and
[1:05:15] died before him
[1:05:19] and you know i think as
[1:05:21] as sad or as
[1:05:23] disheartening as that may be to to see
[1:05:26] elijah in this place yet i think this
[1:05:28] was key
[1:05:30] because i think that too often
[1:05:35] even in who we are
[1:05:37] as the children of god and the people of
[1:05:39] god
[1:05:40] our adversary
[1:05:42] has very skillfully
[1:05:45] used those truths
[1:05:47] to try to
[1:05:49] inflate our egos
[1:05:51] or somehow lift us up in pride
[1:05:54] or in self-esteem
[1:05:57] to think of ourselves more highly
[1:06:01] than we ought to think of ourselves
[1:06:03] and so we must be careful i think even
[1:06:05] the apostle paul said lest i be exalted
[1:06:09] above measure by the abundance of the
[1:06:11] revelation that was sent to me the the
[1:06:14] messenger of satan to buff it
[1:06:16] god was actually using
[1:06:20] those
[1:06:20] adversities in those trials to keep paul
[1:06:24] from becoming too puffed up
[1:06:28] in which case he would have suffered
[1:06:31] perhaps
[1:06:32] if you will the same end
[1:06:35] that lucifer
[1:06:37] suffered
[1:06:38] having become exalted
[1:06:40] in his position
[1:06:42] he was not satisfied to channel
[1:06:46] worship
[1:06:48] he wanted to become a detour
[1:06:51] for the worship to be filtered through
[1:06:54] him
[1:06:56] where he would gain
[1:06:57] something from that that suited his own
[1:07:03] demonic
[1:07:04] lusts
[1:07:07] and so i i think this is a caution for
[1:07:09] us as christians now paul was not
[1:07:12] immune from temptation
[1:07:14] he was not exempted from temptation and
[1:07:18] i think that's important for us to
[1:07:19] realize because as a young person i know
[1:07:22] in my mind i thought you know i just
[1:07:24] need to get justified sanctified and
[1:07:28] filled with the holy spirit and be
[1:07:30] sealed away in god and then i'll be this
[1:07:33] invincible christian living in this nice
[1:07:37] bright bubble
[1:07:38] that god has created for every son and
[1:07:41] daughter of god to live in and
[1:07:43] enjoy an earthly existence in until
[1:07:46] we're taken until all of the others come
[1:07:48] to their place of perfection and then
[1:07:50] we'll all be raptured away in a glorious
[1:07:52] rapture
[1:07:53] but i'm finding
[1:07:55] that was a little bit of a dream
[1:08:00] that was a little bit of a fantasy that
[1:08:02] i had imagined in my mind because we all
[1:08:04] want an end of suffering
[1:08:06] we all want an end of
[1:08:08] of all the things we wrestle with and
[1:08:11] struggle with the and the things that
[1:08:13] you know war at our spirit
[1:08:16] i'm a peace loving person
[1:08:18] i don't like contention i don't like
[1:08:20] strife i i won't necessarily shy away
[1:08:23] from it
[1:08:24] but i don't enjoy it i like peace i like
[1:08:27] harmony i i like when love prevails and
[1:08:31] and the people of god and the church of
[1:08:32] god i wish the whole world
[1:08:35] i i'm sorry to reference the phrase of a
[1:08:38] worldly song but my dad really lives uh
[1:08:41] loves the guitar of chet atkins and jed
[1:08:44] atkins was was a renowned guitarist and
[1:08:46] there was my dad would play these
[1:08:48] cassette tapes of chet atkins and he
[1:08:50] would play these classic tunes often
[1:08:52] with an orchestra and different
[1:08:53] accompaniment but he played this song
[1:08:55] called i'd like to teach the world to
[1:08:57] sing in perfect harmony
[1:09:00] i'd like to buy the world of coke
[1:09:02] and keep it company you know world peace
[1:09:04] is something everyone
[1:09:07] strives for but we've never reached it
[1:09:10] and we're not going to
[1:09:12] until jesus christ is the king
[1:09:16] and we reign supreme with him as his
[1:09:18] bride in the throne amen
[1:09:21] the peace that the world seeks and
[1:09:23] strives for is not going to be realized
[1:09:26] amen until the millennium the millennial
[1:09:29] reign sets in amen but but still if
[1:09:32] there's something there's a desire
[1:09:34] there's a yearning and i believe that
[1:09:36] especially as the sons and daughters of
[1:09:39] god the family and the children of god
[1:09:41] what we're desiring is not even our own
[1:09:43] desire
[1:09:45] but it's his desire that is realized
[1:09:47] through us
[1:09:49] amen he's a god of peace he's a god of
[1:09:52] love he's a god of healing he's a god of
[1:09:55] restoration he's a god of redemption
[1:09:58] this is who he is
[1:10:00] and this is what he does
[1:10:02] but he but he formed this this angel
[1:10:05] whose name was lucifer and within that
[1:10:08] within that created being which where
[1:10:11] there's no redemption for angels
[1:10:13] amen there once they fall that's it
[1:10:16] that's their state perpetually amen but
[1:10:19] for sons and daughters there's
[1:10:21] redemption so god allowed lucifer amen
[1:10:25] for this desire to be harbored and to
[1:10:28] grow into fruition in his heart to to
[1:10:32] take one-third of those angels and
[1:10:34] entice them away to become his
[1:10:37] constituents
[1:10:38] to become you know he
[1:10:40] his his supporters and in doing so amen
[1:10:43] they were cast down by michael the
[1:10:46] angelic form of jesus christ they were
[1:10:49] cast into the earth amen for the battle
[1:10:51] to resume
[1:10:53] amen but for the same end that was
[1:10:55] achieved in heaven to be achieved here
[1:10:58] on earth amen so when god even created
[1:11:01] adam in his own image and then from the
[1:11:03] side of adam he formed mrs adam the
[1:11:07] bride of adam showing what he would do
[1:11:09] 2000 years later on calvary
[1:11:12] amen when the roman would would thrust
[1:11:14] his spear into the side of the almighty
[1:11:17] god and released from his side amen the
[1:11:21] humanity the creation the desires of god
[1:11:24] and bodies of flesh amen satan had no
[1:11:27] idea what he was achieving he was not
[1:11:29] destroying god's plan he was unfolding
[1:11:32] god's plan
[1:11:34] he was allowing those hidden attributes
[1:11:37] that were within christ to be expressed
[1:11:39] here on the earth
[1:11:41] oh my i tell people the devil is only as
[1:11:44] determined as he is dumb
[1:11:47] he keeps on losing but yet he won't stop
[1:11:50] trying and with every junction and every
[1:11:52] joint every time he looks like he gets a
[1:11:54] victory it only serves to a greater
[1:11:57] victory and a greater expression of what
[1:12:01] would only have been achieved
[1:12:04] by satan doing what he did
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:08] so it's god's desires
[1:12:10] it's god's plan
[1:12:13] and it's actually
[1:12:14] it's actually
[1:12:16] the person
[1:12:18] of who god is
[1:12:20] that is unfolding down through time
[1:12:24] it's his plan of redemption
[1:12:27] the fall
[1:12:29] enabled him to exhibit
[1:12:32] his characteristics as a savior
[1:12:35] as a healer
[1:12:37] as a father
[1:12:38] with a family
[1:12:40] that he favored
[1:12:42] he favors you this morning
[1:12:44] he favored israel above all the other
[1:12:47] nations they didn't deserve it they
[1:12:49] didn't earn it they didn't merit it it
[1:12:52] was unmerited grace and favor that was
[1:12:56] extended to his people because it was
[1:12:59] his desire
[1:13:01] amen oh oh i love i believe it was
[1:13:04] brother lonnie jenkins who made this
[1:13:06] statement god didn't just want to have a
[1:13:08] family
[1:13:09] god wanted to be a family
[1:13:14] we're not something that was spun off of
[1:13:17] god
[1:13:18] to see whether or not we would return to
[1:13:21] god
[1:13:22] we are the very manifested expression of
[1:13:25] god
[1:13:26] which can only return
[1:13:29] to our origin
[1:13:31] to our source
[1:13:32] jesus the bible says knowing that he
[1:13:35] came from god and must return to god
[1:13:38] he had complete security in who he was
[1:13:43] because he knew who he was before he
[1:13:46] came became an embryo he knew who he was
[1:13:50] before he condescended from the realms
[1:13:52] of glory and was born in a manger even
[1:13:56] he knew who he was it didn't matter what
[1:13:57] the tabloids said
[1:13:59] it didn't matter what the rumors were it
[1:14:01] didn't matter what the romans said it
[1:14:03] didn't matter what the paid messengers
[1:14:05] the pilot said he had an agenda he had a
[1:14:08] purpose he had a plan and when he
[1:14:10] subjected himself to the roman guards
[1:14:12] and the roman authorities there in the
[1:14:15] garden of gethsemane what looked like
[1:14:17] death what looked like defeat amen what
[1:14:20] what what what disbanded his disciples
[1:14:23] and dispersed them abroad amen was
[1:14:25] actually the preparation for the
[1:14:27] greatest victory that god would ever
[1:14:30] achieve
[1:14:31] amen
[1:14:33] so i want to tell the devil this morning
[1:14:35] this is god's doing
[1:14:37] this is god's plan unfolding and i'm a
[1:14:40] part of it by the grace of god i didn't
[1:14:43] wake up one day and decide i wanted to
[1:14:44] be a christian i didn't decide one day i
[1:14:47] think i'll be a child of god or a son of
[1:14:49] god it was decided before time began
[1:14:52] and i'm here reacting to what god has
[1:14:55] already decided i'm here to say amen to
[1:14:58] the word of god
[1:15:00] amen it's not filtering through my mind
[1:15:02] it's not what i'm able to wrap my
[1:15:05] intelligence around
[1:15:06] it's the intelligence of god
[1:15:09] which is overtaking me
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:14] it's his desire
[1:15:16] i've said this before perhaps even in
[1:15:18] this pulpit you can run from god all you
[1:15:21] want to
[1:15:22] but his arms are longer than your legs
[1:15:27] his grace goes beyond the boundaries of
[1:15:30] what you can run what you're running
[1:15:32] from is going to overtake you one day
[1:15:34] amen is going to wrap you into it and
[1:15:36] you're going to say like saul why did i
[1:15:37] fight this for so long
[1:15:40] it's who i am
[1:15:42] it's who i was ordained to be amen it's
[1:15:45] what god was calling me to even the
[1:15:47] years that saul spent there trying to
[1:15:50] become the greatest of the pharisees or
[1:15:53] the greatest of the religious leaders
[1:15:54] all those years of preparation
[1:15:57] were god instilling into his servant
[1:16:01] what would he would one day quicken
[1:16:04] to the realization of
[1:16:06] jesus christ
[1:16:08] fulfilled
[1:16:10] that law
[1:16:12] he was the embodiment
[1:16:14] of that law
[1:16:16] he did not come in contrast to the law
[1:16:18] he came in contrast to what man had
[1:16:21] defined
[1:16:22] that law to be
[1:16:24] that's what jesus contrasted was the
[1:16:27] religious hierarchy and the teachings of
[1:16:30] what man had perverted that law to mean
[1:16:33] or to be
[1:16:34] but jesus wasn't wasn't contrary to the
[1:16:37] law he was the fulfillment of the law
[1:16:40] he was the expression of the law to show
[1:16:43] that what man and humanity was unable to
[1:16:46] achieve to become the righteousness of
[1:16:48] god he became that amen he took his own
[1:16:52] punishment upon himself amen to liberate
[1:16:56] his attributes his children his family
[1:16:58] both old and new testament
[1:17:01] amen
[1:17:02] both those who had died in the faith
[1:17:04] looking forward and those who would die
[1:17:06] in the faith in the next two thousand
[1:17:08] years
[1:17:10] looking back to who christ is and seeing
[1:17:13] their identity in him
[1:17:15] and looking forward to his coming which
[1:17:18] will be preceded by an out resurrection
[1:17:22] from among the dead
[1:17:23] oh my i'm saying a mouthful this morning
[1:17:26] but it's wonderful
[1:17:28] and so the thing about it is now
[1:17:31] if you can give me grace and i don't
[1:17:33] know that i'll hurry this morning but
[1:17:35] i'll try to finish by noon
[1:17:38] but
[1:17:39] this word
[1:17:41] is your identity
[1:17:44] this word gives you your place
[1:17:47] in the kingdom of god in the family of
[1:17:50] god in the ministry of god
[1:17:53] whether you ever stand behind this
[1:17:55] sacred desk and expound upon the word of
[1:17:58] god you do have a ministry
[1:18:01] because everyone who is a part of the
[1:18:04] body of christ is part of the expression
[1:18:08] you're an outlet
[1:18:10] for his characteristics
[1:18:13] and he is king
[1:18:16] he is priest
[1:18:19] he is lamb
[1:18:21] he is god
[1:18:23] those attributes will express through
[1:18:26] you in ministry
[1:18:28] now the word of god
[1:18:31] places
[1:18:33] boundaries there
[1:18:35] to to keep
[1:18:37] the administration of the life of christ
[1:18:40] in a divine order
[1:18:42] that is there to prevent the distortion
[1:18:45] or perversion of that order by our enemy
[1:18:48] into something that would be
[1:18:50] counterproductive
[1:18:53] satan is trying his best to corrupt the
[1:18:55] cells
[1:18:57] of the body of jesus christ here on the
[1:18:59] earth the bride he's trying to corrupt
[1:19:02] those cells
[1:19:03] through outside influence
[1:19:06] through diet through taking of something
[1:19:09] that's not the revealed word of god or
[1:19:11] not the inspired word of god to take a
[1:19:14] twist and so it's how he achieved his
[1:19:16] first attack on humanity was he came to
[1:19:20] the feminine expression of the first
[1:19:23] adam and began
[1:19:25] expounding the word
[1:19:27] yea hath god said
[1:19:29] but see he wasn't just there to share
[1:19:32] the word
[1:19:34] he was there
[1:19:35] to flavor
[1:19:37] the word
[1:19:38] with something he was going to take it
[1:19:42] apart from its original context
[1:19:46] to lure her into something that he would
[1:19:49] present to her as having a greater
[1:19:53] meaning
[1:19:55] than the simplicity of
[1:19:58] the fortification and protection that
[1:20:00] god had already placed her behind
[1:20:04] yeah hath god said
[1:20:07] now eve did god really mean that
[1:20:10] death
[1:20:12] death in this perfection in this bliss
[1:20:16] in this splendor death
[1:20:19] the day you eat thereof that day ye
[1:20:21] shall die
[1:20:23] how could god
[1:20:24] but see death was already entering
[1:20:29] when she stopped for one second
[1:20:32] to give ear to what another
[1:20:35] husband had to say
[1:20:38] death was already entering
[1:20:40] because it was it was attracting her
[1:20:44] interest
[1:20:45] to something that was a difference
[1:20:48] or a deviation
[1:20:50] from the simplicity of the word
[1:20:54] and you know what i i am i'm sorry to
[1:20:57] have to say this but there are some
[1:20:59] people who will never be satisfied
[1:21:02] with the simplicity
[1:21:04] of the word
[1:21:05] they've just got to have a twist
[1:21:09] they've got to have a little added
[1:21:10] flavor
[1:21:11] they've and so it's how ministries
[1:21:14] distinguish themselves
[1:21:17] and set themselves apart from others
[1:21:20] is they offer
[1:21:22] a flavor
[1:21:25] in the message of thinking man's filter
[1:21:27] brother bradham deals with it very
[1:21:28] clearly it's a filter
[1:21:31] because they're convinced the filter is
[1:21:33] there
[1:21:34] to protect
[1:21:37] against the harmful contents of the
[1:21:39] cigarette
[1:21:40] or to enhance the flavor
[1:21:43] in a way that appeals
[1:21:46] everybody has unique tastes
[1:21:50] you're all formed differently everyone
[1:21:52] has a different idea of what a
[1:21:53] comfortable temperature is i know i'm in
[1:21:56] that business
[1:21:57] we've made a lot of money trying to make
[1:21:59] everybody feel comfortable
[1:22:01] believe it or not
[1:22:02] there have been times when
[1:22:04] fake thermostats
[1:22:07] have been installed in areas of homes or
[1:22:10] offices to convince people that they
[1:22:12] actually had control
[1:22:15] and it made them more comfortable
[1:22:18] just the illusion
[1:22:20] that they now had control
[1:22:23] absolved their anxieties
[1:22:25] and made them more comfortable so
[1:22:27] comfort is subjective
[1:22:29] taste is subjective it varies by person
[1:22:34] so satan realized i can gain a following
[1:22:37] by offering a filter
[1:22:39] that appeals to a certain taste why do
[1:22:42] you think we have dozens of brands of
[1:22:44] cigarettes
[1:22:46] because they all appeal to a unique
[1:22:49] demographic
[1:22:51] which wants that flavor
[1:22:54] amen whether it's even about the taste
[1:22:56] or not they want to smoke a certain
[1:22:58] brand because it gives them an identity
[1:23:01] amen they're not smoking the cheap
[1:23:03] cigarettes they're smoking the expensive
[1:23:05] ones
[1:23:06] right
[1:23:08] think about it friend
[1:23:10] what brother branham was describing in
[1:23:13] cigarettes
[1:23:14] had a a a more
[1:23:18] striking or a more devastating
[1:23:21] reality in churchianity
[1:23:24] and the religions of the world
[1:23:26] the simplicity of the word of god
[1:23:29] is too often not enough
[1:23:32] for mainstream religion
[1:23:35] they all want a flavor
[1:23:37] they want the roman catholic flavor
[1:23:40] they want the protestant church's flavor
[1:23:43] they want what is in their family
[1:23:45] heritage
[1:23:46] and we're not exempt or immune from this
[1:23:49] as believers of the message
[1:23:51] those same spirits
[1:23:54] are now here attacking the bride of
[1:23:56] jesus christ
[1:23:58] and might i say have raised up
[1:24:00] ministries
[1:24:01] that will take you right out of this
[1:24:03] bible and right out of a vindicated
[1:24:05] message and say you need my flavor
[1:24:09] you need my ministry to break this
[1:24:11] message down to you i want to tell the
[1:24:13] devil this morning no i don't
[1:24:16] your ministry is what got us in this
[1:24:18] mess and there's only one thing that's
[1:24:20] going to get us out of this mess and
[1:24:22] that's the pure unadulterated word of
[1:24:25] god amen it worked back then it will
[1:24:28] work now
[1:24:29] amen
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:32] i don't need a man's opinion i don't
[1:24:34] need a man's idea i don't need to be
[1:24:36] identified with some big movement i
[1:24:39] don't believe in an eighth messenger
[1:24:41] there were seven
[1:24:42] there were seven that god sanctioned and
[1:24:45] the seventh one was to introduce us to
[1:24:47] jesus christ and i don't look for that
[1:24:50] to happen in the future i have already
[1:24:52] been introduced to the person of jesus
[1:24:55] christ in the revealing of his word
[1:24:57] [Applause]
[1:24:58] you say are you looking for brother
[1:25:00] brandon to come back absolutely i'm
[1:25:02] looking for paul to come back i'm
[1:25:04] looking for irenaeus to come back i'm
[1:25:06] looking for all those messengers and all
[1:25:08] those believers to come up in a general
[1:25:11] resurrection
[1:25:13] amen but i'm not waiting on some
[1:25:15] ministry to rise up
[1:25:18] and punctuate
[1:25:20] what god has already punctuated with
[1:25:23] divine vindication
[1:25:25] we have what we need to take us into the
[1:25:28] rapture
[1:25:29] what we need is a greater appreciation
[1:25:33] for what we already have
[1:25:37] i'm preaching now just from my heart but
[1:25:40] the only way satan could ever convince
[1:25:43] eve that she needed what he was offering
[1:25:46] was to make her a bit dissatisfied
[1:25:51] with what she'd already had
[1:25:53] you watch that
[1:25:54] when a spirit begins to rise up
[1:25:57] and breed this satisfaction
[1:26:00] you watch that because that's how satan
[1:26:03] moves
[1:26:04] he's not overt
[1:26:06] he's not the blunt broad edge
[1:26:10] of a maul
[1:26:12] he's a little fine wedge
[1:26:14] that comes in to create division
[1:26:17] and dissatisfaction and a
[1:26:20] discontentment and from there
[1:26:24] he
[1:26:25] he he
[1:26:27] he begins to generate
[1:26:30] a hunger and a desire for something
[1:26:32] different
[1:26:33] or something more
[1:26:35] i'm going to tell you the conversation
[1:26:37] that that the serpent had with eve
[1:26:39] in the garden of eden didn't happen
[1:26:42] one day
[1:26:45] there was no time
[1:26:47] being marked at that time he had
[1:26:50] conversation after conversation after
[1:26:53] conversation with her
[1:26:55] he attracted her to what he was offering
[1:26:58] over a period of time
[1:27:00] to relax any inhibitions or any
[1:27:04] uh fortification or any barriers that
[1:27:07] she might initially put there all those
[1:27:09] barriers became relaxed
[1:27:12] he became her best friend
[1:27:15] he became closer to her than her own
[1:27:18] husband
[1:27:19] and then enticed her into the
[1:27:21] transgression
[1:27:23] because he took her away from her
[1:27:26] identity
[1:27:28] as a daughter of god
[1:27:31] and made her brother brenham caught her
[1:27:33] a prostitute
[1:27:34] no woman will enter prostitution without
[1:27:37] first losing her self-respect
[1:27:40] and her self-esteem and her own
[1:27:42] self-worth
[1:27:44] must first be obliterated
[1:27:48] before she will enter into prostitution
[1:27:50] the same is true spiritually
[1:27:52] no church will ever deviate from the
[1:27:54] word of god
[1:27:56] until they first lose the esteem
[1:28:00] that the word of god gives them
[1:28:04] the world calls paul a woman hater paul
[1:28:07] was not a woman hater
[1:28:09] paul was there to give the woman her
[1:28:12] rightful place and position
[1:28:14] as the queen of heaven
[1:28:17] and the very people that call paul a
[1:28:19] woman hater call themselves the queen of
[1:28:22] heaven
[1:28:23] the roman catholic church
[1:28:27] isn't it fascinating
[1:28:29] how the devil so
[1:28:31] slyly
[1:28:33] removes
[1:28:35] what god has given you
[1:28:37] and offers you something
[1:28:39] that is a
[1:28:40] complete it's diametrically opposed
[1:28:44] it's the complete enemy
[1:28:47] to god and to who you are
[1:28:50] and people gobble it up
[1:28:52] and believe it's eternal life
[1:28:55] and you know what i'm just going to say
[1:28:56] this about roman catholicism it offers
[1:28:59] you
[1:29:00] no surety
[1:29:04] it offers you no confidence
[1:29:07] in an
[1:29:08] in an end that god has already
[1:29:11] determined
[1:29:12] it keeps you pursuing something for your
[1:29:16] entire life and the life thereafter in
[1:29:19] hopes
[1:29:21] that you can one day obtain that is
[1:29:24] roman catholicism
[1:29:26] as opposed to christianity which says
[1:29:28] it's already settled
[1:29:30] it's already finished god has already
[1:29:33] determined this end for you and just
[1:29:35] invites you to accept it by faith and
[1:29:39] enter into it
[1:29:42] i love the words to that song it's
[1:29:43] already done
[1:29:45] hallelujah because the real christianity
[1:29:48] is belief in a finished work
[1:29:51] which is bringing you into the final
[1:29:54] product or the final result of that
[1:29:56] finished work
[1:29:58] but satan you know he's not attacking
[1:30:00] our ideas he's not attacking our
[1:30:02] doctrines he's not attacking william
[1:30:04] branham as a man or the message as a
[1:30:06] movement he's not attacking tucson
[1:30:08] tabernacle he's not attacking uh you
[1:30:11] know the the branham family he's
[1:30:13] attacking the bride
[1:30:15] he's attacking the feminine expression
[1:30:18] of jesus christ by attacking the word of
[1:30:21] god which was sent through the lips of
[1:30:24] his prophet messenger to give us for the
[1:30:26] first time in 6 000 years who we
[1:30:29] actually are
[1:30:30] and what god in the back part of his
[1:30:32] mind had determined
[1:30:34] was too precious too valuable too
[1:30:37] powerful to be prematurely released now
[1:30:39] it's been released
[1:30:41] and satan's attacking it
[1:30:43] because it's always been his enemy
[1:30:46] and it's the only thing that's keeping
[1:30:49] him from the full realization
[1:30:51] of his own ambition
[1:30:53] is that word
[1:30:55] being realized in the heart of faith
[1:30:58] by the sons and daughters of jesus
[1:31:00] christ because the moment you realize
[1:31:03] that word is who you are
[1:31:05] that word is your healing that word is
[1:31:08] your salvation that word is your power
[1:31:11] over temptation over depression over
[1:31:14] every demonic attack this word gives you
[1:31:16] authority over the devil
[1:31:19] it gives you full authority over the
[1:31:21] devil this word gives you unlimited and
[1:31:24] invincible power as sons and daughters
[1:31:26] of god amen let me tell you something
[1:31:28] friend we're not taking the devil's
[1:31:30] property back from him we're taking our
[1:31:32] own property
[1:31:33] it's been ours all along amen when they
[1:31:36] dispossessed canaanites they were
[1:31:38] dispossessing squatters that had been on
[1:31:40] their land that god had given their
[1:31:42] father abraham
[1:31:44] i'm not here to take my healing back
[1:31:46] from the devil i'm here to take my
[1:31:48] healing that's always been mine it never
[1:31:50] was the devil's but he's trying to be a
[1:31:52] squatter on your property whether it's
[1:31:54] healing whether it's salvation whether
[1:31:56] it's resurrection whether it's the
[1:31:58] rapture whether it's an overcoming life
[1:32:00] your unbelief is the only thing standing
[1:32:03] in the way of your victory
[1:32:05] but you're going to have to feed on the
[1:32:07] word of god that's the only thing that
[1:32:11] will feed your faith and quicken those
[1:32:14] hidden potentials that god has already
[1:32:16] placed within you this word is the only
[1:32:19] thing that will extract those potentials
[1:32:22] and activate them in your life
[1:32:26] you won't get it through psychology
[1:32:29] you won't get it through medical science
[1:32:33] i believe in doctors i appreciate their
[1:32:35] contribution
[1:32:36] but god alone heals
[1:32:40] i am the lord thy god that healeth all
[1:32:43] thy diseases you know why the devil
[1:32:45] can't heal because god didn't leave him
[1:32:46] any room to
[1:32:48] god said i heal all
[1:32:50] amen so all healing comes from god
[1:32:54] and the medical world in this science
[1:32:56] world is their amen to help create the
[1:32:59] conditions for healing
[1:33:01] they can mend the broken bones they can
[1:33:03] do great things today there are marvels
[1:33:05] to modern sites but god heals
[1:33:09] healing is a divine characteristic of
[1:33:12] god alone and while the devil may try to
[1:33:14] mimic it and replicate it the devil
[1:33:16] cannot heal
[1:33:18] amen i feel good this morning
[1:33:22] i'm way off of my notes
[1:33:24] but i want to tell you something
[1:33:28] in ezekiel 37
[1:33:30] ezekiel spoke through the valley of dry
[1:33:32] bones and god said these bones are the
[1:33:33] whole house of israel
[1:33:35] they've been
[1:33:36] smashed they've been scattered they've
[1:33:39] been dismembered they've been disunified
[1:33:42] but he said
[1:33:43] speak
[1:33:45] brother bradham said this book of
[1:33:47] revelation can only be understood
[1:33:50] by a certain class of people
[1:33:53] i want to tell you this morning you're
[1:33:54] special
[1:33:55] you're not just any church
[1:33:57] you're not just anybody you're somebody
[1:34:01] this message resonated to you
[1:34:05] for very special reasons
[1:34:07] it may not attract the attention of the
[1:34:09] world it's not supposed to
[1:34:11] it's here to attract the attention of
[1:34:13] the bride
[1:34:15] but he said ezekiel you've got to speak
[1:34:17] it in other words no matter how great it
[1:34:20] is as a desire of god
[1:34:23] something has to give birth
[1:34:26] to god's desire
[1:34:29] in speaking
[1:34:31] and when the prophet spoke
[1:34:34] those bones responded
[1:34:38] they were divinely programmed
[1:34:42] to react
[1:34:44] to prophecy
[1:34:46] it wasn't a conscientious reaction it
[1:34:49] wasn't a rib bow and said you know what
[1:34:51] i think i'll just get up and go go join
[1:34:53] myself to a sternum no it was a divine
[1:34:57] intelligence
[1:34:58] that was calling those bones back to
[1:35:01] order
[1:35:03] back to where they had originally been
[1:35:05] joined to
[1:35:06] putting the muscle putting the sinew
[1:35:08] putting the blood even putting all the
[1:35:11] organs putting all the faculties back to
[1:35:14] everything they had once been and then
[1:35:16] breathing life into them
[1:35:19] to go and be better
[1:35:22] than they were before
[1:35:24] because the armies they were going out
[1:35:26] to destroy had modernized
[1:35:29] they had advanced their weaponry and
[1:35:31] their strategy and their tactics they
[1:35:33] had developed themselves but god amen
[1:35:36] i'll just say this this morning we don't
[1:35:38] need a modernized gospel
[1:35:40] we don't need a new translation of the
[1:35:42] bible and we certainly don't need
[1:35:44] another interpretation of the message
[1:35:46] the original still works
[1:35:48] it's the old time holy spirit and the
[1:35:50] devil won't come near it that's the
[1:35:52] reason unbelievers fear it but it's good
[1:35:54] enough for me
[1:35:56] if our young people get the same holy
[1:35:58] ghost that fell on the day of pentecost
[1:36:01] it doesn't matter how modern the
[1:36:03] temptations are it doesn't matter how
[1:36:05] many devices it doesn't matter how
[1:36:08] diabolical satan's plan god is greater
[1:36:11] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:36:13] that is in the world god is still
[1:36:15] greater what you need is god
[1:36:18] you don't need a church you don't need a
[1:36:20] youth camp amen you don't need a new
[1:36:22] pastor you need a relationship with
[1:36:24] jesus christ you need the holy ghost
[1:36:29] amen and what some of us need is another
[1:36:32] dip
[1:36:33] in the same holy ghost
[1:36:35] we want to do this and to do this why
[1:36:37] don't we just get a new outpouring a new
[1:36:39] feeling of god saying god one more time
[1:36:42] let me stand there like samson and say
[1:36:45] it's not about me it's about you god
[1:36:49] you gave my mother this promise
[1:36:52] you gave me a nazarite identification i
[1:36:55] failed to protect
[1:36:58] my identity as a nazarite but god you've
[1:37:00] restored it
[1:37:01] now for your glory one more time lord
[1:37:05] let me and my death gain a greater
[1:37:08] victory in all the victories of my life
[1:37:11] that's what we need friends
[1:37:14] a death to self
[1:37:18] a death to our desires and our ambitions
[1:37:21] so often they're well intentioned
[1:37:25] but friends it's just like
[1:37:28] and i preached a message called better
[1:37:30] than before
[1:37:32] because when god puts things back
[1:37:35] they're not as good
[1:37:38] they're better
[1:37:40] when god restored adam and eve but see
[1:37:43] whatsoever god
[1:37:46] hath joined together
[1:37:49] let not
[1:37:50] man
[1:37:52] put asunder
[1:37:54] so much of the division and the schisms
[1:37:57] within the body of christ today
[1:38:01] they're the works of man
[1:38:03] and they're failing
[1:38:05] and they're dissolving and the kingdoms
[1:38:08] that men have built
[1:38:11] are one by one crumbling
[1:38:15] and the kingdom that god started
[1:38:17] is rising
[1:38:20] it's growing
[1:38:21] in power
[1:38:23] and in love and the bond of the holy
[1:38:26] spirit which is the great
[1:38:29] unifying agency of god
[1:38:32] is bringing a body into order
[1:38:35] that is better
[1:38:37] than anybody before
[1:38:40] when god restored adam and eve together
[1:38:42] they had a greater bond
[1:38:44] because now through the appreciation
[1:38:46] they had gained
[1:38:48] through contrast of what they
[1:38:50] experienced in the loss of fellowship
[1:38:53] and the loss of companionship and
[1:38:55] knowing that horrible tragedy that had
[1:38:57] brought separation being rejoined
[1:39:01] they could now be guarded against the
[1:39:03] wiles of the adversary
[1:39:05] and say adam i'll never listen to
[1:39:07] another voice
[1:39:09] i'll never listen to another message
[1:39:11] i'll never look to another man
[1:39:15] she could have never been married to
[1:39:16] that serpent
[1:39:20] because there was a difference in origin
[1:39:25] and specie
[1:39:27] so where he could never understand her
[1:39:29] heart
[1:39:31] she could never
[1:39:32] understood his they would have never
[1:39:33] grown old together
[1:39:36] in love
[1:39:38] they would have always been tensions and
[1:39:40] why doesn't he understand me why why
[1:39:42] can't she get this because they came
[1:39:45] from different places
[1:39:47] but god had joined adam
[1:39:51] and his wife together
[1:39:53] before
[1:39:54] they were separated they were together
[1:39:57] so god could not go out into the garden
[1:40:00] and find another lump of clay
[1:40:02] because there was no other
[1:40:05] there was no other peace
[1:40:08] that could complement him
[1:40:11] and could complement one another
[1:40:14] like adam and mrs adam
[1:40:16] so they were rejoined together better
[1:40:19] than before
[1:40:21] this resurrected army of ezekiel 37 was
[1:40:24] better than before
[1:40:25] because they were able to defeat a new
[1:40:28] enemy
[1:40:29] with an old god
[1:40:31] an old experience
[1:40:33] an original experience if you will god
[1:40:36] god has never needed to polish
[1:40:39] his word
[1:40:41] he just
[1:40:42] puts it back
[1:40:45] and what it was originally will still
[1:40:47] work today
[1:40:50] if we will adhere to it
[1:40:52] and there it is the key you say brother
[1:40:54] tim i i i have such great faith you
[1:40:58] don't have any faith
[1:41:00] other than what god gives you
[1:41:04] if you have faith at all in god it's
[1:41:06] what he imparted
[1:41:08] it's his own divine attribute
[1:41:11] which is echoing an amen
[1:41:14] to his voice god put that
[1:41:17] you say brother tim you're trying to
[1:41:19] weaken my self-confidence no i'm trying
[1:41:21] to strengthen your confidence in who he
[1:41:24] is
[1:41:25] in you
[1:41:27] because if your confidence is just in
[1:41:29] yourself it will falter and it will fail
[1:41:31] but if your confidence can ever be
[1:41:33] anchored into what god says you are
[1:41:37] that is steadfast that is sure that will
[1:41:41] stand the test of time and will
[1:41:43] withstand every storm
[1:41:45] amen
[1:41:47] oh my i'm kind of lost here but i want
[1:41:50] to i want you to know that i'm not
[1:41:51] preaching this just you know this is in
[1:41:53] third timothy chapter one
[1:41:55] this is right out of the bible
[1:41:57] this is right out of the message
[1:42:01] amen
[1:42:02] brother man said i used to remember as a
[1:42:04] little boy i hope i'm not holding you
[1:42:05] too long that knowing sitting out on the
[1:42:08] creek bake and i'd sit there and look
[1:42:09] around at nighttime
[1:42:11] pop and mom they're going on now to
[1:42:13] their rest
[1:42:14] and then days they were sinners there
[1:42:16] was no christianity
[1:42:18] in our homes at all
[1:42:23] and oh my drinking in parties and
[1:42:25] carrying on made me sick
[1:42:28] it made me sick
[1:42:30] i'd take my lantern and my dog and go to
[1:42:33] the woods to stay all night
[1:42:37] in the winter time i'd hunt till the
[1:42:39] party was over
[1:42:41] maybe daylight in the morning come home
[1:42:43] wouldn't be over i've laid on top of a
[1:42:46] shed and sleep
[1:42:48] waiting for daylight to break
[1:42:50] now brother betterment showing you
[1:42:53] the
[1:42:54] pond that the lily came up through
[1:42:59] now it's 1965 the world is seeing a
[1:43:02] ministry that is so profound in its
[1:43:04] impact
[1:43:06] almost every realm
[1:43:09] of world powers have given testament to
[1:43:12] god has visited
[1:43:15] this earth
[1:43:16] this generation
[1:43:18] the political powers
[1:43:21] gave gave acknowledgement to it
[1:43:23] congressman upshaw
[1:43:25] kings queens monarchs i mean god didn't
[1:43:28] do this in a corner friend
[1:43:30] god did not do this in obscurity
[1:43:33] god did this on the front pages
[1:43:37] of major media outlets
[1:43:40] god didn't do this in a dark corner and
[1:43:42] i'm not ashamed of what god did
[1:43:45] i don't have to apologize for it god did
[1:43:48] it
[1:43:49] i'm standing behind it supporting it say
[1:43:51] i know god did that
[1:43:53] i don't have to answer the unbeliever's
[1:43:55] questions they've always had questions
[1:43:57] that can never be answered because it's
[1:43:59] a bottomless well of doubt
[1:44:02] and no answer will ever satisfy their
[1:44:05] desire because their un their d their
[1:44:08] desires are driven out of unbelief
[1:44:12] they are in essence unbelievers
[1:44:16] and had they lived 2 000 years ago they
[1:44:19] would have called him an illegitimate
[1:44:20] son
[1:44:22] they would have called him you know why
[1:44:23] doesn't he come in the main stream of
[1:44:25] the religions they would have found
[1:44:27] reasons to doubt then just like they
[1:44:29] find reasons to doubt today so you don't
[1:44:32] have to answer their questions
[1:44:36] you don't have to go to the library you
[1:44:38] don't have to go into the archives you
[1:44:39] don't have to go in into the micro fish
[1:44:43] and try to fish up an answer
[1:44:45] be the answer
[1:44:48] you are the echo to this message
[1:44:52] amen
[1:44:53] behold i send you
[1:44:56] you
[1:44:57] are who elijah was sent to
[1:44:59] you are who the ministry resonates to
[1:45:02] amen your your presence here this
[1:45:05] morning
[1:45:06] is an amen to malachi 4.
[1:45:08] your life is an amen to malachi 4. the
[1:45:11] baptism of the holy ghost to you is an
[1:45:14] amen
[1:45:15] amen a photograph is not the vindication
[1:45:18] of this message it's just one of them
[1:45:20] but the greatest vindication are the
[1:45:22] lives of the men women and boys and
[1:45:25] girls who today are changed creatures
[1:45:28] because god sent a prophet
[1:45:31] and god restored truth to us
[1:45:34] that had for 2 000 years
[1:45:37] been perverted and polluted
[1:45:40] by man's opinions
[1:45:42] and the last thing the true bride of
[1:45:44] christ is going to do is turn from this
[1:45:47] and start wandering toward yet one other
[1:45:50] man's opinion
[1:45:52] the true bride won't do it
[1:45:55] she's not interested
[1:45:57] womb is sealed
[1:46:00] the spiritual womb
[1:46:01] is sealed
[1:46:03] and she's satisfied
[1:46:06] and content
[1:46:08] that god did this
[1:46:10] god started it god's going to finish it
[1:46:13] and i'm here
[1:46:15] preparing for his return
[1:46:18] oh my
[1:46:20] glory you know i i i'm going to go to
[1:46:23] this story and
[1:46:24] brother ben talked about that armor meat
[1:46:26] packing man's son whoever found in
[1:46:29] chicago what he was desiring and a wife
[1:46:32] so he says you know i'll find it out
[1:46:33] west
[1:46:35] and out west he felt they dressed a
[1:46:37] little differently they they had a
[1:46:38] little different customs you know they
[1:46:40] had the ranch house and all those things
[1:46:42] but yet
[1:46:44] everything else as far as
[1:46:46] what was in
[1:46:47] those girls was no different
[1:46:51] than what was in the girls from chicago
[1:46:55] they just had a different decor
[1:46:58] but when he found
[1:47:00] the little cousin
[1:47:02] when he found the little girl
[1:47:04] out behind the ranch house
[1:47:07] throwing out the dishwater
[1:47:09] no shoes on her feet just a little
[1:47:11] ragged dress on you know
[1:47:14] just there just
[1:47:15] being who she was
[1:47:18] she wasn't trying to impress anybody
[1:47:23] would to god we had more people in this
[1:47:26] earth today
[1:47:28] that would just be themselves
[1:47:31] our world has been ruined by hollywood
[1:47:35] i go overseas i go to romania and see
[1:47:37] women trying to dress like americans
[1:47:39] they dress worse than most americans
[1:47:41] because all they see is what's on
[1:47:43] television
[1:47:45] and they think every american woman
[1:47:46] dresses that way
[1:47:48] because they've never been here
[1:47:52] they've only seen what's been projected
[1:47:54] to them on a screen
[1:47:56] and that's what they're ascribing to
[1:48:00] is what
[1:48:01] image
[1:48:02] and so hollywood has ruined the world
[1:48:05] because nobody can be themselves
[1:48:07] everybody's got to be an actor
[1:48:09] everybody's got to put on a good front
[1:48:10] everybody now has got multiple
[1:48:12] personalities
[1:48:13] because they're like
[1:48:15] movie characters they get in a
[1:48:16] personality and they can't get out and
[1:48:19] friends just be what god has made you
[1:48:22] if you can ever realize you're a created
[1:48:25] vessel unique
[1:48:28] you are the unique expression of god's
[1:48:31] glory
[1:48:32] no one can take your place it's your
[1:48:35] place
[1:48:36] but if you'll just do and be what god
[1:48:39] has called and ordained you to be and
[1:48:41] quit trying to live up to others
[1:48:43] expectations or quit trying to create
[1:48:47] put some image in front of yourself to
[1:48:49] impress
[1:48:50] friends if people aren't impressed with
[1:48:52] who god has made you
[1:48:54] why try
[1:48:56] what who cares
[1:48:58] they're not your god they're not your
[1:49:00] savior they didn't bleed and die on
[1:49:02] calvary for your salvation for so who
[1:49:04] cares what their opinion is i'm
[1:49:06] interested in pleasing one person and
[1:49:08] that's the almighty god and if we had
[1:49:10] more people who could just be satisfied
[1:49:13] in the skin that god gave me man
[1:49:16] we'd probably put some of these
[1:49:17] beauticians out of business
[1:49:22] i'm sorry that was free
[1:49:24] but
[1:49:25] we're living in a world today where
[1:49:27] people can't be satisfied being
[1:49:28] themselves
[1:49:30] they're committing suicide because
[1:49:32] they're trying to live up to an image
[1:49:36] that others are trying to form them to
[1:49:38] be
[1:49:40] i'm happy the way god made me amen
[1:49:43] i'm not perfect but i'm becoming
[1:49:47] the image that he's called me to be i'll
[1:49:49] tell you i'll be the first to tell you
[1:49:51] he's still working on me
[1:49:53] he hadn't put me up on the shelf
[1:49:55] for sale
[1:49:57] or for the viewer's pleasure he's got me
[1:49:59] there as a testament to what he can
[1:50:02] transform
[1:50:03] a person into
[1:50:05] that's what i'm giving witness to
[1:50:07] but there was
[1:50:08] let me go back to brother branham
[1:50:12] we see his home life we see the
[1:50:15] the environment he was raised in come
[1:50:17] home i'd lay on top of a shed and sleep
[1:50:19] waiting for daylight to break then i
[1:50:21] think of hell at times then being out
[1:50:23] there in the summertime
[1:50:24] get my sticks put them down for a little
[1:50:27] wind break
[1:50:28] where if it rained lay there and have
[1:50:30] the pole sticking in the water fishing
[1:50:32] my old dog laying there i'd say
[1:50:34] looky here you know last winter i camped
[1:50:35] right here one night i built a fire
[1:50:37] right here when i was waiting for my old
[1:50:39] dog here to treat i had a fire here it
[1:50:42] was froze five or five inches deep in
[1:50:45] the ground
[1:50:46] but little flower
[1:50:48] where did you come from see
[1:50:50] well and where'd you come from who who
[1:50:53] came out here and planted you
[1:50:55] and what hot house did they bring you
[1:50:56] out of or what what where'd you come
[1:50:59] from that little flower i'd say well it
[1:51:01] was froze and everything and i built a
[1:51:03] fire on top here besides the freezing
[1:51:05] element there was a heat element laying
[1:51:07] here on a big old log where i burned you
[1:51:10] and yet here you are
[1:51:12] and you're alive
[1:51:14] where did you come from
[1:51:20] all night
[1:51:22] all day
[1:51:24] angels watching over me my lord
[1:51:27] god planted something there and it
[1:51:31] doesn't matter what the devil has put on
[1:51:33] top of it god is watching that
[1:51:37] life that seed
[1:51:39] what was it there was another william
[1:51:42] branham see
[1:51:45] a little spot of eternal life down there
[1:51:48] from the genes of god
[1:51:52] oh my
[1:51:54] the word of god that was placed there
[1:51:56] each one of you can think of similar
[1:51:58] things
[1:51:59] see it was working then look up at the
[1:52:01] trees and i'd say leaf i'd seen you fall
[1:52:04] off last year and why are you back there
[1:52:05] again where'd you come from what brought
[1:52:07] you here see it was that eternal life
[1:52:11] working in the body
[1:52:13] brother bradham was not a theologian
[1:52:16] brother brethren had not been to
[1:52:17] seminary brother brennaman hardly gone
[1:52:20] through
[1:52:20] the
[1:52:21] years of public school but there was an
[1:52:24] eternal quality
[1:52:27] down deeply embedded in his young boy
[1:52:31] heart
[1:52:32] that was looking out
[1:52:34] and seeing god
[1:52:37] and wondering who am i
[1:52:40] where did i come from
[1:52:42] where am i going and what is my identity
[1:52:47] and then one day as i walked on that
[1:52:48] voice talking don't ever drink smoke and
[1:52:51] so forth and the young fellas and all
[1:52:53] got older see there was something moving
[1:52:56] and all at once i looked up
[1:52:58] and i said i'm not the son
[1:53:02] of charles
[1:53:04] and elle branham
[1:53:05] now i'm tying this back to elijah under
[1:53:09] the juniper tree
[1:53:10] i am not better
[1:53:13] than my fathers
[1:53:15] you will live
[1:53:16] and die
[1:53:19] in that
[1:53:20] if it's all you ever see
[1:53:23] you can't be better than your natural
[1:53:26] lineage
[1:53:29] you can't reform yourself
[1:53:32] hardly two weeks ago my wife and i were
[1:53:34] in a court proceeding and we were
[1:53:35] watching a man on the witness stand
[1:53:39] his mother
[1:53:41] was the prosecutor and she was renewing
[1:53:43] a restraining order against her 38 year
[1:53:46] old son
[1:53:48] frail little little lady probably 100
[1:53:51] pounds soaking wet standing up there
[1:53:53] probably in her 60s
[1:53:56] getting the court to reinforce to
[1:53:58] reinstate a restraining order against
[1:54:00] their 38 year old son
[1:54:02] and he's there on the and he's there on
[1:54:04] the witness stand high on drugs
[1:54:06] it was plain to everyone in the court he
[1:54:08] was and the the judge asked him four
[1:54:10] different times
[1:54:12] sir have you within the last 48 hours
[1:54:14] taken any mind altering substance any
[1:54:17] illegal drugs or any alcohol anything
[1:54:19] that would impair your state of mind and
[1:54:21] his own conscience
[1:54:23] prohibited him from giving the judge a
[1:54:26] straight answer
[1:54:27] he said oh your judge you know i'm from
[1:54:29] florida and i'm this and i'm that and
[1:54:31] i'm in this self therapy and i'm in this
[1:54:34] self-rehab
[1:54:36] self this self that i think that's the
[1:54:37] problem you're broken and you're trying
[1:54:39] to fix yourself
[1:54:41] and he's dosing himself he said i take
[1:54:43] recreational drugs and i take
[1:54:45] prescription this and prescription that
[1:54:47] i think you're a mess
[1:54:49] and here you are and your your own
[1:54:51] mother has having to to to plead to the
[1:54:53] mercies of the courts to put something
[1:54:56] in place that will protect her from the
[1:54:58] child of her womb
[1:55:01] you're not going to be better than your
[1:55:04] fathers
[1:55:05] you can't my point is you can't reform
[1:55:07] yourself
[1:55:09] you can't diagnose your own problems you
[1:55:12] are the problem
[1:55:14] i'm the problem
[1:55:16] without god we're lost
[1:55:19] without his grace and mercy we're
[1:55:21] hopeless we have no future we have no
[1:55:24] identity we have no security we have
[1:55:26] nothing outside of him
[1:55:28] we are completely reliant and dependent
[1:55:32] on his mercy and his grace
[1:55:36] amen so i'm here this morning pleading
[1:55:39] to the mercies of god god you called me
[1:55:42] you saved me you're the one who picked
[1:55:45] me up out of the clay lord you saw
[1:55:47] something in me that was worth saving
[1:55:49] that was worth redeeming that was worth
[1:55:51] starting oh god will you come and finish
[1:55:55] what you started
[1:55:58] because i will only in all my efforts
[1:56:02] to avoid the mistakes of my predecessors
[1:56:05] i will only repeat them
[1:56:09] and worsen them
[1:56:12] unless
[1:56:13] another life
[1:56:15] takes over
[1:56:17] unless i find a higher identity
[1:56:20] i love my earthly father and i love my
[1:56:22] earthly mother
[1:56:24] but i know i need a heavenly father i
[1:56:28] know i need a new birth
[1:56:30] and i thank god for the day
[1:56:32] he came and saved me
[1:56:34] filled me with his spirit
[1:56:36] and said i'm starting you on the way and
[1:56:38] the bible says he that began a good work
[1:56:40] in you will be faithful to perform it to
[1:56:44] the day of jesus christ
[1:56:47] my hopes are built on nothing less
[1:56:50] than jesus and his righteousness
[1:56:54] that's the only thing this world is
[1:56:55] teetering and tottering and falling
[1:56:57] apart amen it's scripting anxieties and
[1:57:00] depressions and demonic possessed people
[1:57:02] are running to and fro they don't have
[1:57:04] enough institutions they don't have
[1:57:06] enough asylums they don't have enough
[1:57:07] doctors they don't have enough
[1:57:08] prescriptions but if you can ever reach
[1:57:10] that well of water that that little
[1:57:12] woman found two thousand years ago
[1:57:16] we know that when messiah's coming
[1:57:18] he said i am he that's speaking to thee
[1:57:22] one drink from that well brother and
[1:57:24] sister
[1:57:25] gave her a new identity amen i'm not a
[1:57:29] prostitute that barred from the temple i
[1:57:32] am the temple
[1:57:34] of the holy ghost
[1:57:37] amen
[1:57:38] i don't have to be good enough for the
[1:57:40] world you'll never be good enough for
[1:57:41] the world
[1:57:43] but you're too good for him
[1:57:45] to lose
[1:57:47] and he thought enough of you
[1:57:49] to come and give his life
[1:57:52] on calvary
[1:57:54] as our sisters come back to the music
[1:58:08] may the lord help us this morning
[1:58:13] friends
[1:58:14] this message
[1:58:16] god did it
[1:58:19] god said william branham
[1:58:22] god called him
[1:58:24] god told him don't drink
[1:58:26] don't smoke
[1:58:28] don't defile your body in any way
[1:58:31] because i've got to work
[1:58:33] for you to do
[1:58:35] when you get older
[1:58:37] god did it
[1:58:40] god
[1:58:41] vindicated
[1:58:43] that man and that ministry he does not
[1:58:46] need my endorsement
[1:58:48] he has gods
[1:58:50] [Music]
[1:58:52] he does not need
[1:58:54] my endorsement
[1:58:55] he has gods
[1:58:58] i'm giving testament to what god
[1:59:01] has done
[1:59:02] i'm declaring to this generation not
[1:59:05] what god is about to do but what god has
[1:59:08] already done
[1:59:10] and continues to do
[1:59:13] as
[1:59:14] the ripples
[1:59:17] of the impact of what god did
[1:59:19] over 40 years ago
[1:59:21] they are still echoing
[1:59:23] [Music]
[1:59:24] not only across this earth but across
[1:59:26] the entire universe
[1:59:29] the order of god's creation is being
[1:59:32] restored
[1:59:33] right now
[1:59:35] it's already underway
[1:59:37] and it will be realized
[1:59:40] in a millennial reign and the resumption
[1:59:42] of eternity
[1:59:44] and the universe will be restored to a
[1:59:46] perfect order
[1:59:48] and we'll be a part of that
[1:59:50] by the grace of god
[1:59:52] i'm just here to say amen to it brother
[1:59:54] swanson
[1:59:56] i don't offer an opinion on it i just
[1:59:58] say amen
[1:59:59] i want my life
[2:00:01] to be the amen
[2:00:03] to his desire his prayer
[2:00:06] brother said anything that's an enemy to
[2:00:08] this word is your enemy
[2:00:12] so i will tell you this morning be bold
[2:00:14] be courageous any ministry that rises up
[2:00:16] i don't care how many signs and wonders
[2:00:19] accompany it if it doesn't say what a
[2:00:22] vindicated message has already said flee
[2:00:25] from it
[2:00:26] it's death
[2:00:30] you can't ask for more vindication than
[2:00:33] what god has already given
[2:00:35] be confident and be satisfied
[2:00:38] in what god has already done
[2:00:41] and that will bring you into it
[2:00:45] and it's transforming powers amen
[2:00:48] i was looking for a scripture here
[2:00:51] just to close on
[2:00:52] second corinthians 5.
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:01:27] verse 14 for the love of christ
[2:01:31] constraineth us
[2:01:33] because we thus judge
[2:01:37] that if one died for all then we're all
[2:01:40] dead
[2:01:42] and that he died for all
[2:01:45] that they which live
[2:01:48] should not
[2:01:51] live
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:56] should not henceforth live unto
[2:01:59] themselves
[2:02:01] but unto
[2:02:02] him which died for them
[2:02:07] and rose again
[2:02:10] wherefore henceforth know we know man
[2:02:12] after the flesh
[2:02:14] yea though we have known christ after
[2:02:16] the flesh yet now henceforth know we him
[2:02:18] no more therefore if any man be in
[2:02:21] christ
[2:02:23] he is a new creature
[2:02:25] old things are passed away
[2:02:28] behold all
[2:02:30] all
[2:02:31] [Music]
[2:02:32] things
[2:02:34] are become new
[2:02:36] friends what i'm trying to get to is he
[2:02:37] became everything that you were
[2:02:40] so you could become
[2:02:43] everything that he is
[2:02:45] the divine transaction
[2:02:48] that took place amen
[2:02:50] of which you are benefactor
[2:02:54] and all things are of god who hath
[2:02:57] reconciled us to himself
[2:03:01] by jesus christ and have given to us
[2:03:05] the ministry of reconciliation you talk
[2:03:07] about a priesthood
[2:03:09] amen we're here as the unifying agents
[2:03:13] of the body of jesus christ to put down
[2:03:16] dissention to put down schisms to put
[2:03:19] down division and controversy and strife
[2:03:21] and bitterness our job is to be the
[2:03:24] healing
[2:03:26] the healing of christ's body is a is is
[2:03:29] a power that is residing within the body
[2:03:32] it's an inherent power for the body to
[2:03:35] heal itself as it drinks in the word of
[2:03:39] god in the spirit of god oh my you don't
[2:03:43] you don't have to to spray a tree with
[2:03:46] pesticides
[2:03:47] to protect it against the foreign
[2:03:49] creatures that want to take its life
[2:03:51] just feed it good nutrients
[2:03:54] and the strength of who the tree is
[2:03:58] by drawing those nutrients from the
[2:04:00] earth will repel
[2:04:03] oh
[2:04:06] amen
[2:04:07] if we just drink in the word of god
[2:04:10] and let the holy spirit rain down upon
[2:04:12] our lives amen we won't need all the
[2:04:15] programs and all the pesticides and all
[2:04:17] the theology and all the psychology the
[2:04:20] strength is already there in your
[2:04:22] members
[2:04:23] and is activated by the nurturing of the
[2:04:26] holy spirit
[2:04:27] oh my
[2:04:29] to wit that god was in christ
[2:04:31] reconciling the world to himself
[2:04:33] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[2:04:37] and have committed unto us the word of
[2:04:38] reconciliation now then are we
[2:04:41] ambassadors for christ
[2:04:43] as though god
[2:04:44] did beseech you by us
[2:04:46] we pray you in christ instead
[2:04:49] be reconciled to god
[2:04:52] for he hath made him to be sent
[2:04:57] for us
[2:04:59] who knew no sin
[2:05:01] that we
[2:05:02] might be made the righteousness of god
[2:05:06] in him
[2:05:08] amen
[2:05:10] can you say
[2:05:11] amen
[2:05:14] lord
[2:05:15] let it not just be my vocal cords
[2:05:18] but let it be the very life
[2:05:22] that you live out through me
[2:05:25] be the amen to your word would you like
[2:05:27] to stand this

[2:09:35] so that i
[2:09:37] might become him
[2:09:40] by grace
[2:09:43] he took my place he
[2:09:47] took my place
[2:09:50] so that i
[2:09:52] through his love could take
[2:09:58] [Music]
[2:10:14] perhaps this morning as we bow our heads
[2:10:17] for prayer
[2:10:21] [Music]
[2:10:24] the holy spirit has spoken to your heart
[2:10:26] this morning
[2:10:34] the adversary has been exposed
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:41] that voice
[2:10:43] that conscience
[2:10:48] that besetting sin
[2:10:50] something that's creeping into your life
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:53] to try to move you away
[2:10:56] [Music]
[2:10:59] from who you are
[2:11:01] as a son of god as a daughter of god to
[2:11:04] try to
[2:11:06] lure your interests
[2:11:08] and your desires into something
[2:11:11] apart from the word of god
[2:11:14] and thereby
[2:11:16] [Music]
[2:11:18] marginalize
[2:11:21] the
[2:11:22] effect
[2:11:24] of the word of god
[2:11:26] in your life you see i don't believe
[2:11:28] satan can destroy you
[2:11:31] he just wants to sideline you
[2:11:35] neutralize you
[2:11:37] so you cannot be an effective witness
[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:11:41] for the power of the gospel
[2:11:44] but i wonder if your heart has been
[2:11:46] gripped this morning
[2:11:48] you say lord jesus
[2:11:50] i want to put away
[2:11:53] i want to shut out i want to silence
[2:11:57] this voice
[2:11:58] [Music]
[2:12:02] i want to cauterize
[2:12:06] i want i want the
[2:12:11] great scalpel of the holy spirit to cut
[2:12:13] away
[2:12:15] this influence
[2:12:17] this foreign life that's trying to
[2:12:20] enter
[2:12:22] as a parasite
[2:12:24] to weaken
[2:12:25] [Music]
[2:12:29] to hinder me from
[2:12:32] fully realizing the joys and the peace
[2:12:35] the power the healing the salvation
[2:12:38] [Music]
[2:12:39] you see friends that's the only thing
[2:12:41] that stands between you and your promise
[2:12:44] is unbelief
[2:12:46] and if you foster it if you harbor it
[2:12:49] if you feed it if you give it the time
[2:12:51] of day it will grow
[2:12:55] but if you'll resist the devil
[2:12:59] just lift your hand this morning and say
[2:13:01] i resist
[2:13:03] this attack of satan
[2:13:05] against my life
[2:13:08] i bleed the blood of jesus christ
[2:13:12] over my life
[2:13:13] over my marriage over my home over my
[2:13:16] family
[2:13:17] over the charge that god has given me
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:22] god has given you a dominion friend
[2:13:24] within his kingdom
[2:13:26] god has given you a dominion but until
[2:13:29] you recognize it until you stand up
[2:13:33] and let the power of god declare itself
[2:13:36] through your life
[2:13:38] you'll never
[2:13:39] fully realize the boundaries
[2:13:42] of your possession
[2:13:45] as given to you
[2:13:47] in this great abstract title of
[2:13:49] redemption but if you're standing here
[2:13:51] this morning saying i refuse
[2:13:53] to be weakened
[2:13:55] by the enemy
[2:13:56] and i'm here to declare today
[2:13:59] i'm driving down a stake and from this
[2:14:01] day forward
[2:14:03] i'm going to focus on the word of god
[2:14:06] and my identity in christ and i'm going
[2:14:09] to move
[2:14:10] in that direction as the holy spirit
[2:14:12] gives up
[2:14:13] and let the power of god
[2:14:16] form me
[2:14:18] and make me
[2:14:21] into what brings glory honor to him and
[2:14:24] to him alone lift your hand this morning
[2:14:29] as it has been spoken
[2:14:32] so may it be done
[2:14:33] [Music]
[2:14:35] may it be your unction
[2:14:37] and your voice heavenly father
[2:14:40] lived through our lives
[2:14:43] i do not believe william branham was
[2:14:45] your only mouthpiece
[2:14:47] but i believe lord
[2:14:48] through
[2:14:50] the ministry that came from that vessel

[2:15:01] our lives
[2:15:03] to resound
[2:15:05] and to echo and to reverberate
[2:15:08] what has already sounded
[2:15:10] and to echo it into every corner of the
[2:15:13] earth
[2:15:14] until that last predestinated seed comes
[2:15:16] in
[2:15:17] lord let my life
[2:15:19] be a faithful witness
[2:15:23] to what you have sounded
[2:15:25] and may it continue lord to resound
[2:15:27] through your body your breath
[2:15:30] may we not be
[2:15:31] captured lord
[2:15:33] by this
[2:15:34] great and sobering and even depressing
[2:15:39] reality that faced elijah
[2:15:41] but lord you brought him to the mouth of
[2:15:42] the cave
[2:15:44] and you stood him up
[2:15:45] [Music]
[2:15:47] and you showed him lord that not only
[2:15:49] had you given him this ministry but you
[2:15:51] had given him followers
[2:15:54] it would continue on
[2:15:56] and even be magnified
[2:15:59] through the lives
[2:16:01] of those who had been activated
[2:16:04] by the message you brought through his
[2:16:06] life
[2:16:07] and lord that's where we are today
[2:16:10] may we not be defeated in our natural
[2:16:12] lineage

[2:16:16] have
[2:16:16] ordained and called us to be

[2:16:33] and all the
[2:16:34] dissatisfaction and unrest

[2:30:12] [Music]
[2:30:18] man
[2:30:20] [Music]
[2:30:35] of god above
[2:30:39] [Music]
[2:30:55] the scroll
[2:30:58] [Music]
[2:31:06] no stretch
[2:31:17] just before we're dismissed this morning
[2:31:19] for some reason i
[2:31:21] feel compelled to
[2:31:25] share this with you
[2:31:27] when we speak of how god can restore
[2:31:29] things back
[2:31:31] better
[2:31:32] and greater than before
[2:31:34] one illustration i've used is
[2:31:37] over in kentucky where they mine the
[2:31:39] coal
[2:31:40] oftentimes they use dynamite and
[2:31:42] very powerful machinery to destroy the
[2:31:45] mountains and the hills all in the
[2:31:46] effort to extract the coal the value
[2:31:50] from those hills and then they're
[2:31:51] required by law
[2:31:53] to rebuild those hills and mountains
[2:31:55] they call it
[2:31:57] they call it the um
[2:32:01] yes reclaiming they call it reclaiming
[2:32:03] that land reclamation
[2:32:06] and see they can put
[2:32:07] the dirt
[2:32:09] back they can
[2:32:11] they can make it resemble exactly what
[2:32:13] it
[2:32:14] looked like before they even have to
[2:32:16] plant grass and trees
[2:32:18] but they can't put the value
[2:32:22] back in it it takes god to do that
[2:32:29] so often we try to put things
[2:32:32] back together
[2:32:34] but it takes god
[2:32:43] that was originally there
[2:32:45] that can only be put back
[2:32:48] by god
[2:32:50] but i want your faith to be lifted this
[2:32:52] morning
[2:32:53] to believe for god
[2:32:55] that makes it better
[2:32:57] if it's your home it's your family
[2:32:59] whatever it is you know what it is
[2:33:02] say god i'm gonna believe you
[2:33:04] not only to restore it back to what it
[2:33:06] used to be but to make it better
[2:33:09] than it was before
[2:33:11] that's where god gets his glory
[2:33:14] and you're involved
[2:33:16] in that this morning
[2:33:18] your life is involved
[2:33:22] god has staked his reputation
[2:33:26] on your success
[2:33:27] [Music]
[2:33:29] because you are the proof
[2:33:31] you are the proof that calvary and the
[2:33:33] resurrection and the
[2:33:35] return of the holy spirit to the church
[2:33:37] you are today's proof
[2:33:40] of that victory
[2:33:43] so god has staked his reputation on your
[2:33:46] victory as a christian and god has never
[2:33:49] lost
[2:33:50] and never will
[2:33:52] so you can no more lose than he can lose
[2:33:55] have that confidence this morning
[2:33:57] and trust in him
[2:34:01] [Music]
[2:34:03] remember what you're going through
[2:34:05] is not god looking to see if there's
[2:34:07] gold in you
[2:34:08] but because there is gold in you you're
[2:34:10] going through it so the gold can be
[2:34:13] expressed amen
[2:34:14] god bless you as you go
[2:34:17] oh
[2:34:19] jehovah jireh is his name
[2:34:24] for him
