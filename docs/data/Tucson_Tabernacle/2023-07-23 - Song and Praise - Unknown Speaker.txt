[Music] it says this let the word of the Lord dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him God bless you all Sister Sarah you are first but Aaron if you could continue on [Music] thank you brother Dan I don't get blamed for it now although I don't amen good to be in the house of the Lord today so you may be seated and we have some of the folks here that have said they would sing so we have um quite a few today so just worship praise God sing you know right along with them and warm yourself up in case you get cold amen let's look at Psalms chapter 9 verses 1 and 2 while they're preparing there Psalms chapter 9 verses 1 and 2. I will praise thee O Lord with my whole heart I will sure for show forth all thy marvelous works I will be glad and rejoicing Thee I will sing praise to thy name O thou most high amen [Music] I was asked to sing a few days ago my dad asked if I would sing a song and as you know I haven't been able to come to church so I'm so happy first to be here I feel good today and I'm grateful for that but also I was reading the Psalms in my devotion and it kind of goes right in line with what they've already read this afternoon I was reading Psalms 89 I was singing of the mercies of the Lord forever and with my mouth make known his faithfulness to all generations and the second part of that is you read on it says even the heavens establish and declare that God is faithful and we look in our you know in the sky you see the sun the moon the stars every single day that's a reminder God put those up there they're still they're still faithful to their place because he set it in place and he's the faithful God so I was thinking about that and I thought well we haven't had time to practice anything so we're just kind of doing this but um everybody knows the songs and so if you just want to join with me [Music] I will sing on the mercies of the Lord forever [Music] life faithfulness to all generations [Music] yes [Music] my faithfulness to all generations [Music] of the Lord forever [Music] Jesus [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] God we serve brother Daniel I'll call you Junior brother while is your throat warm too brother Daniels I'm prepared there and then such a Lily and my sister Grace Fallen brother Daniel okay you ready I I got a text this morning and um I'm sure you don't remember it but I shared a testimony about a young lady that Daniel had witnessed to she didn't witness to her he was having a conversation and uh in Jeffersonville and there was a young lady who was going through some hard a really hard time and she was listening to what the way Daniel was talking to this other brother and it really encouraged her and then she and Daniel had a conversation after that and I'd like to read a text that she wrote this morning officially one year ago one year ago I had no idea that going on a road trip this was down to Jeffersonville from Canada now going on a road trip would lead me to leave leave everything I had and was and was to pick up my cross and follow Jesus I had no idea God would reveal himself in the simplest way possible one year ago I was wondering how I could possibly make my way back to God when it seemed like I had gone too far but someone reminded me one year ago of just how strong I am and said if someone could do it it was me you said that following you said that following God wouldn't be the end of my dreams like I kept thinking but God will allow me some bigger dreams that I had no idea I could possibly get and you were so right I know it probably all seemed pretty silly to you but I know that God used you in the simplest way possible and I will forever be grateful one year ago today [Applause] God bless you guys I'm really nervous this is my one of my first time singing in front of people so bear with me I might bomb it but you know say a quick prayer for me please [Music] there's a Grace when your heart is on your fire another way when the walls are closing and when I look at the space between where I used to be in this Reckoning I know I will never be you there's another in the fire standing next to me there's another in the water so holding back the Seas should I ever near-minded of how I've been set free there's a cross but there's no burden where another died for me there's another in the fire dead left for dead beneath the waters I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore this should I fall in the space between what remains of me in its Reckoning the way I'm about to the things of this world there's another in the fire standing next to me there's another in the water so holding by the Seas should I ever need in mind the power Set Me Free there's a grid that holds no body now the power lives in me and I can hear the light in the darkness as a Darkness bows to him I can hear the roar in the heavens at the space between where's then I can feel the ground shake beneath us as the Prison Walls came in nothing stands between us and nothing's in between us there's another in the fire standing next to me there's another in the water it's holding back the Seas how good you've been to me I'll count the joy of every battle and I know that's where you'll be there's another in the fire

I will sing unto the Lord because he has dealt mountainfully with me how many can say amen amen you've got reason to praise him praise him to worship then we're going to have an instrumental after this show I wanted to share a testimony I um with struggling with some things and I got to thinking because Stephen told me that brother green said that brother Brown told him that there's nothing that you can do to make God love you more or less because he loves you just the same and um rather than you got up and preached who had Bewitched you that you quit walking in Grace and started walking under the law again and I couldn't ever come on my own but once again I'd look to the Lord to transform Me In His Image and said I I can't transform myself I'm looking to you to transform me so and and I overcame through him and I just thank the Lord I am so glad that our father in Heaven tells of his love in the book he has given wonderful things in the Bible I see this is the tears that Jesus loves me I am so glad that Jesus Loves Me Jesus Loves Me Jesus loves me I am so that Jesus loves me Jesus loves even me no life [Music] when I remember that Jesus loves me I am so that Jesus Loves Me

Christian you're a good example for us sister hope God bless your heart [Applause] we talk about for some of the new people we we talk about a lot about this man named William Branham he was very very special to me I get criticized for not mentioning him enough and I get criticized for mentioning him too much but one thing I know is he was a great man that did great things my family the Evans family used to follow him around all over the all over the country really my family lived in south Georgia brother Branham lived in um Southern Indiana and they drove up um they drove up to hear him preach on a Sunday they drove up the day before they um they got to spend quite a bit of time with brother Branham they were they were really close he'd stay with them when he'd when he'd come down to Georgia and often my family would stay with him um so brother Brown was preaching on a Sunday and my Aunt Martha was a little girl she is maybe Caitlyn's age and uh by the way Caitlyn and Lydia I'm over time I don't have to sing haha that's uh that's why I gave the testimonies I am she's about Caitlyn's age I say and they um they spent some time with brother Branham and and my grandpa noticed that brother Branham was talking to my aunt Martha um a couple times so after the meetings were over they were driving home Martha she had um pet chickens and she loved these chickens so much they were they were like her little congregation they weren't everywhere with her and she'd go to school and and they'd walk her to the bus stop and and she'd get on the bus and they'd go back home and and when the bus would come back in the evening those chickens would run out and meet Martha at the school at the bus stop and she just loved them and they loved her and um so when they went up to Jeffersonville they were on their way home and my grandpa called the neighbor and the neighbor said well she said I got some really bad news he said my dog got into your yard and killed all of Martha's chickens so he felt awful my grandpa just he couldn't tell Martha and so he worried all the way home I think it's I don't know it's 750 800 miles Drive he worried about that the whole way home and they got home they drove into the driveway and the chickens didn't come running out and my Grandpa took Martha his little girl aside and he said he said Martha he says I have some really bad news he said the neighbor's dog got into the yard and killed all of your chickens Martha said she said daddy that's okay she said when we were up in Jeffersonville she said brother Branham told me that the dog had gotten my chickens and and they wouldn't be there when I got back the Lord thinking of a little girl like that and how that man he was truly a prophet there's no way he could have known that and my grandpa didn't even know it until he was on the way home and brother Branham had told my my Aunt Martha two days earlier that that would happen this little testimony about how God is good to us what's the next song brother see the next one's brother Lyle and brother Daniel I'm sorry [Music] I'm sorry I didn't have my glasses on I read them wrong so I'm brother Leo I feel prepared

nice one there he said uh he said yes sir he says how far away was it when you shot it he saw it was uh it's probably about 40 yards and he said really yes sir he said you sure he's well maybe maybe it was uh maybe it was 20 yards and he said really you sure he said well brother Brandon maybe it was maybe it was like maybe 10 yards and he says really so how far was it he said brother Branham he says here's what happened he said I was walking down the trail this way and he said the javelina was walking this way and he says we were both moving real fast he said we almost ran into each other and he said that thing turned around and he said it ran and got stuck in a bunch of cactus and he said so I just walked up to it and shot it and he says no Terry brother Bram said no he said let me tell you what really happened he said you were walking on this Trail going this way and he said that pig was walking this trail of walking on the same Trail and you all met face to face and that pig looked up at you and he said if I'm not the ugliest thing in this whole desert I'm going to commit suicide he went and found to the cactus so brother Branham had a good sense of humor too God bless

something a little bit different we'll play the harmonica too I want to take you on a journey with me I want to see if you could just take a deep breath close your eyes and just relax and listen to these words that God gives me to give for you today for this evening I want to tell you a little bit about three kings one was a king who wared against God's will another one was a king that did God's will and another one was a king that completed God's perfect will that was our King The King of Kings the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] as this ancient instrument plays I think of a young Shepherd boy named David standing in the gap between King Saul in a dark evil spirit David was summoned to the Royal Court a raid in battle with nothing but a harp like the one we now hear to battle the evil that was consuming King Saul I'd like to think he was playing something similar to this Soul piercing song Amazing Grace because it was Grace that soon saved him from being pierced to the wall with King Saul's Javelin while the harp yet echoed through the Royal Chambers as I continue listening to this harp I think of God's grace that kept David safe through all his Wars and delivered him untouched to the throne where he became king I weep as I go deeper in thought of another king the king of kings and a direct line to the throne of King David Jesus who by that same Amazing Grace stood in the gap between us and Evil he was a raid in battle nothing but a cross a mockery of a king's robe in the crown of thorns while hanging there marred beyond recognition he said father forgive him for they know not what they do and when he heard a broken heart next to him ask to be remembered by him when he entered into his kingdom a good shepherd and King of Kings then proclaimed through Grace to a mere sinner just like us listening now who was dying next to him on his own cross today you will be with me in Paradise he soon took the javelin to the side that young David was spared from many years before while Amazing Grace plays on I see him going into battle once more for us his children and now part of his Royal and eternal Kingdom foreign with blood still dripping from the nail hole in his hand snatches the keys of death out of the dragon's head delivering us into eternal life friends believe this with all your hearts and when hardship storm clouds and even death comes calling say as King David once said [Music] though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil for the Lord is with me brothers and sisters it's by his Amazing Grace we are redeemed to eternal life with him and each other forever [Music] foreign [Music] God bless you all [Applause] Grace how sweet the sound oh it saved our rich like me I once was [Music] [Applause] [Music] Let's
