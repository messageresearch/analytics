[Music] is have heard the message [Music] little bright rest for all is well thank you someone asked one of the children here about one of the times i spoke and was told he's the one that always says good evening i don't want to disappoint or be inconsistent so good evening being a wednesday night i'll try to keep this under three hours if if i go longer than that feel free to interrupt if the battery doesn't go dead in the microphone first i have to admit that i'm feeling really good tonight i've got something on my heart that i want to share with you from god's word and i want to share with you a brief testimony in the process of that as well i'm wondering if we could stand and approach the author not only of the bible but the author of our faith before i say something that i shouldn't lord jesus father god we are so in awe of you we are so grateful for this opportunity that we can have lord jesus to bask in your presence lord to shower you with the praises of our lips lord the love that's in our heart for you in response to the love that you had for us pray lord jesus that you would help me to just be out of the way lord forgive me of the sin in my life lord the unbelief the the places where i just so frequently and so often fall short that i can be out of the way and be a channel that you could speak because these are your people bought with your blood through that agony of suffering lord jesus pray lord that there'd be something here tonight that would help strengthen the faith of each and every person that's here we thank you for this opportunity to be together once more in jesus name amen see if i can remember how to make this work no yeah there we are while we're standing in respect to that written word and read our topic verses the first two are found in paul's epistle to the hebrews a letter he wrote to jewish believers both are very familiar to us we'll start with hebrews 11 verse 1. we're told faith faith is a substance it's a substance of things that we hope for and it's evidence it's evidence of things we can't see and a bit earlier in that same letter paul said we have not a high priest he's speaking of jesus we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities in other words we have a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities why because he was at all points tempted tested like as we are yet somehow without sin and finally we'll read four verses from his epistle to the galatians he says we who are jews by nature he's not necessarily speaking to a jewish audience but he's helping these this gentile audience understand a jewish perspective and not sinners of the gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified skipping down to verse 20 he says i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ lives in me and the life which i now live in this flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me gave himself for me i don't frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain please be seated tonight i want to speak about faith we often wrestle with faith in our daily lives i i certainly do to me it's part of the very fabric of being a christian faith and the struggles within ourselves regarding that faith in his healing ministry brother branham was always encouraging each of us to have faith the ministry that he had the discernment of speaking to the people and revealing things about them that he couldn't possibly know was for the purpose of increasing their faith his commission was to pray for the sick a gift of healing he was told if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayers not even cancer belief faith not to believe in brother branham or even in his prayer for them which was often as simple as as lord jesus heal the woman now go on your way rejoicing you're healed not long complicated petitions to have them place their faith in jesus christ as jehovah rapha god the healer remember a couple of weeks ago we spoke about confession jesus is lord four syllables three words that encapsulate the whole of christianity i'd like to share a testimony an update of god's healing power in our midst some of you may recall that thanksgiving week of 2017 was a a medically stressful week for me i started the week on monday with an emergency appendectomy i ended on friday with a massive heart attack completely shutting off the blood supply to the right side of my heart 100 blockage by mid to late december my heart had recovered to about a 60 to 65 percent level of its normal pre-attack capacity it stayed at that level it stayed until one wednesday evening four years ago when god touched me i was sitting just a couple rows behind you here sister there wasn't any shouting there wasn't any prayer line he just asked me to praise him well heather and i saw the evidence of that healing the following sunday i didn't run out of air during the song service much to the dismay of those that were nearby well that tuesday i had an electrocardiogram now they weren't checking to see if i was pregnant i i wasn't but but to measure the capacity of my heart see how it performed and how it performed under stress afterwards the cardiologist told me mr johnson i can see no difference between your heart and a normal healthy heart see you in six months that was april of 2018. well monday of this week april of 2022 i went in for another stress test frankly i was mildly concerned because i'd noticed a lessening of my stamina in recent months couldn't be my age it's got to be my heart right the result of the testing and an answer to a specific question i asked to the doctor is that my heart is perfectly normal it performs well under stress i think heather will agree that the cardiologist a different one that we saw four years ago but part of the same medical practice was mildly surprised and certainly pleased so was i in other words the touch from the lord 48 months ago is still the touch from the lord this very evening he's faithful he keeps his promises he's ever present he's not stuck somewhere in the past or waiting for us somewhere in the future he's the great i am and an implication of this is you're probably stuck with me for a little while longer well back to our topic of faith let's reread there from galatians 2 16 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified i was struck by the phrase we read here it's occurs in many places in the king james version the faith of jesus christ it's a matter of a preposition of rather than in we place our faith in him as a result of the exercise of his faith on our behalf the faith of jesus christ i've highlighted it here here's a brief explanation uh regarding the meaning of the word of from learngrammar.net it says of expresses the relationship of a part of something to the whole it's the most often used preposition in english examples he's a boy of 15. some parts of his body were injured most of the guests are gone the plays of shakespeare will always be classics we often talk about the blood of jesus the love of jesus but what about the faith of jesus tonight we're going to look a little bit at the faith of christ man is not justified by the works of love but by the faith of jesus christ what does that mean even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ not by the works of the law i'm going to ask you a question no i'm going to ask you several questions you don't have to answer don't raise your hand it's okay do you think god has faith do you think god needs faith does he doubt that he can heal or save or create do you think it's hard for him to do that that he has to struggle to believe he can do it do you think he's learning discovering things about us that he never knew never anticipated things about himself does he get sick does he have migraines is he worried about covet 19 i think we can agree that he's god he doesn't change he knows the end from the beginning not one of his will be lost he is our healer he is our savior he is our redeemer he is the lover of our souls we might think of this as some level as divine self-confidence true and we can have faith in him and his ability confidence and his love for us still with me now the question that brings our focus to this evening what was the faith of jesus christ that paul refers to if if he was god the the yahweh the yudeva the the jehovah of the old testament why did he need to have faith divine self-confidence but if that's the case how is he like us just god in the body form of course he passed all the tests he had the ultimate answer sheet no need for cliff notes right but it's not that simple and in fact i don't believe that that was the case in this sense consider jesus was born a helpless infant last week heather and i were in um in reno and and by god's arrangement we happened to be there the very moment that our second great-granddaughter was born six pounds 1.9 ounces a helpless infant totally dependent on his mother for life she nursed him she bathed him hugged him sang to him held him while he was circumcised and screamed out in pain put up with him when he was cutting teeth and got cranky and cried because he hurt and didn't know why soothed him comforted him held him when he fell down and cut his knee trimmed his finger nails and toenails cleaned him when he dirtied himself she was a mother and he was her firstborn infant jesus became a toddler small child continued to grow as any child might luke tells us that the child jesus grew waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him the grace of god was what is grace unmerited favor modern did you ever think of jesus in this way but the bible says the grace of god was upon him i want you to exercise your imagination with me for a little while this evening today april 6th is brother branham's birthday in 1909 113 years ago in a remote part of kentucky he was born in a little cabin to a dirt poor family we're told a light came into the room when he was born now brother bradman didn't see it or or if he did he couldn't remember it right what's your earliest memory do you remember you may remember many birthdays but do you remember the day you were born no but his mother told him about it that's how he knew he relates this to us many times in the recordings that we have jesus growing up if he was human had no memory of an angel chorus celebrating in the skies no recollection of shepherds hurrying to the sheep stall where he was born no memory of simeon or anna prophesying over him in the temple at the age of only several months he would not have recalled a visit by some astrologers from the parthian empire bearing expensive gifts for him do you remember much before your first birthday i don't he might have had child member childhood memories of egypt we don't know how long the family stayed there i have a couple of fragmentary memories from when i lived in belmont california in a house that we left when i was three years old those are my earliest memories but we can be sure that mary told him about her being visited by an angel and now he was a special little boy of course every mother tells her children that they're special heather still tells our kids and they're all in their 40s i happen to agree with her but his his dad his his his stepdad his earthly dad joseph probably told him about spiritual dreams that he'd had and acted upon but nothing like the physical visit of an angel that mary had what would have been like to have been the young jesus or the young william branham for that matter hearing these amazing birth event stories i want your sisters to imagine this too in fact this may help you i want to share something brother branham said before i read it to you i'm going to ask you another question we're playing 20 questions matt i'm going to ask you another question don't speak out if you think you know the answer don't even have to raise your hand but i want to give you some background to that question brother branham tells us that he has a child and that the the child recently saw a first vision he says he believed that child might take his place someday with me i'm paraphrasing i'm not quoting do you recall hearing him say something like that okay if you do just hold in your mind for a moment the name of that child don't don't speak it just oh yeah i know that was that's keep that in your mind now i'm going to read something to you it's from a message divine love it was preached in the spring of 1957. brother peter sister lydia it was march 5th that it was preached he's talking about a time that a sick opossum came to his porch in indiana and he couldn't decide what to do about it he says all night long i couldn't get that opossum off my mind the next morning early i went out and as i started out little rebecca who i believe is going to maybe take my place someday she's seen her first vision just recently and she's very tender-hearted little thing now here's my question you don't have to answer it is his daughter rebecca the child you thought of before i read that quote does it surprise you brother branham said that the angel told him his was a gift of healing one of the nine spiritual gifts he said healing faith wisdom prophecy discernment and so forth he wasn't talking about rebecca preaching the context is healing so please sisters join in our little exercise of imagining this agenda trying to place yourself in jesus sandals for a moment at age 12 jesus is reasoning with the scholars and rabbis in the temple it's passover so it's near his birthday if he was born in mid april 6 bc as the evidence suggests then this would have been 8 a.d when he was 12 passover fell that year on what we would call march 20th he would have had bar mitzvah a few weeks after that passover in 880 when he became 13 years old from the angel announcing his birth until his baptism we have no record of jesus being visited by an angel or even having a spiritual dream it doesn't mean those things never happened only that we have no record either way we know almost nothing of his childhood or his early adulthood prior to his ministry we've seen sunday school pictures of a smiling lad helping his dad in a wood shop it's based on joseph being a skilled laborer in the greek word for skilled labor can also mean carpenter the king james version translates it as carpenter we have a whole church tradition of jesus helping his dad in a carpenter shop making furniture and whatnot for the locals as a kid seeing these kind of pictures in the sunday school that i attended denominational churches i wondered if any of that furniture was still around i wanted to see it i wanted to touch it well later in his early ministry the the locals were asking is not this the carpenter that's what the gospel of mark says or the carpenter's son as matthew tells it now i'm not suggesting he was not a carpenter or a woodworker the point of the locals of course is that he was not trained as a rabbi he was not trained as a student of the torah yet in his parables he never uses a carpenter metaphor apart from maybe talking about getting the beam out of your eye before you take the speck out of someone else's he uses farming agriculture milling grapes fishing talks about weddings we don't know when joseph died would you know that no mention is ever made of him after jesus encounter with the religious teachers there in the temple at age 12. brother branham tells us of his own childhood of whirlwinds and so forth that scared him or interfered with him he was about to do something that he shouldn't things he just couldn't understand at that time and didn't until many years later remember we're trying to understand some things about jesus how his life relates to our lives trying to get to the bottom of the phrase the faith of jesus and i want to underscore for you his humanity not his divinity his humanity both aspects are vitally important but we often overlook or even minimize humanity you're trying to split them into half man and half god well of course he could do that he was god but not tonight i want you to remember that he was fully human yet in him throughout the fullness of the godhead bodily john the baptist testified before jesus came to be baptized john the baptist answered we read in luke saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than i is coming i can't even take his shoes off his feet i can't even be the foot wash flunky for him he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire now at his baptism we're told of the holy spirit appearing descending a voice speaking i've threaded some gospel accounts together here to help us get a more complete picture of these moments to have multiple witnessing accounts i've color-coded it like i did a couple of weeks ago it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus was also being baptized of john and jordan and praying and straightway coming out of the water he saw the heavens opened unto him he saw the spirit of god the holy ghost descending in bodily form like a dove and lighting upon him we just go to mark because they say the same thing there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased now john's gospel tells us it wasn't only jesus that saw this jesus may have been the only one that heard the voice we don't have an additional testimony about that but in john 1 we read john the baptist bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him same thing jesus saw i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said to me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw and bare record this is the son of god and of course this happened this prophecy the baptizing with the holy ghost and fire we know that happened at pentecost after the past after the passion the crucifixion the resurrection well if you were jesus the man the human why would this testimony be important to you that john also saw this might it be a reassurance that what you saw and experienced wasn't just a result of emotion or whatever the devil might try to get you to think to cast doubt on that experience somehow haven't you ever had times when you've had to fight doubt about something spiritual in your life isn't that how people lost their healing and other victories in christ we hear about and recorded messages of brother ranu but if someone else is there to remind and reinforce doesn't that make a difference for you this is in part why we need to confess our faults one to another not only to have accountability but also to bring reinforcement one more week bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ how can we do that if we're kept in ignorance of each other's burdens not just prayer requests but confession again consider the human being jesus no record of angel visitations your mom tells you that you're special just like all moms tell their sons you've heard about some odd things around your birth and sojourn in egypt is a very small child you you find you have a real knack for the scriptures somewhere along the line you started to connect the dots you're very familiar with the story of joseph and the torah and genesis you might see a breadcrumb trail there that helps you understand where you are who you are revelation understanding by faith but but are you really god hiding in a body and not really human or are you in fact a human consider immediately after jesus was baptized luke 4 we read in jesus being full of the holy ghost this is right after his baptism it had just delighted on him according to john the baptist testimony it remained with him jesus returned from jordan and was led by the spirit mark says he was driven by the spirit into the wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered we usually focus on the temptation being after the 40 days of fasting and wandering in the wilderness but matthew mark and luke make it very clear he was being tested during those 40 lonely torturous difficult days the devil didn't wait for 40 days and then show up the events that transpired the end that we read about stones and temples and kingdoms are just that the concluding events can you imagine the struggles you may have had during that time what struggles might you have had where's the battleground of our faith it's in our minds where was jesus battle being fought if he's just like us if he was a human being and just had a tremendous spiritual experience i'm not saying that he would doubt but i'm sure that things came along and lord i know that's in your word where is that it's not i doubt that it's in your word it's not sin it's not doubt but it's a tremendous testing it's a tremendous struggle what brother branham's case what did he finally do he went to a cave and asked god to show him what all these strange things in his life meant and this was years after his ohio river experience remember we're looking at jesus humanity because we're talking about faith i can't relate to god wrapped in flesh and see how that is somehow the same is or even similar to me in my trials and testings of life and they have a divine spark and i do claim to have a portion of the spirit of the almighty but that's different than possessing the whole of the divine being i really like that the greek word for tempted means tested as well as enticed and examined because when we're tempted isn't that the case enticement and testing like all good tests it isn't to inform the teacher what we know but help us understand our grasp of the material being covered by the test the difference jesus passed the tests without sin me not so much let's look at another aspect that shows jesus humanity not just god wrapped in a body mark 4. jesus is just starting his ministry here he's back in his hometown of nazareth jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house and we're told he could do there no mighty work saved that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them and he marveled because of their unbelief and he went round about the village's teaching he marveled let's read in matthew chapter eight when jesus was entered into kefarnakum there came unto him a centurion that's a roman soldier the occupier the enemy besieging him and saying lord now this is a roman military guy he's addressing jesus as lord my servant my jewish slave lies at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus said unto him i'll i'll come and heal him the centurion answered and said lord i'm not worthy that thou should come under my roof he was aware of the jewish prohibition regarding gentiles we're told in another account that this particular century was well regarded in the local jewish community but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed i'm a man under authority and i have soldiers under me i say to this man go he goes to nether come he comes to my servant do this and he does it when jesus heard it he marveled he marveled and said to them that followed verily i say to you i often found this kind of faith in all of israel he marveled he was astonished he was amazed god can you astonish god can you surprise him god it's your birthday i've got a surprise for you guess what it is in the box you can't you can't surprise god he knows the end from the beginning if he's all-knowing how could these two circumstances cause amazement or even mild surprise but but to a man yeah yeah i want to shift gears for for just a moment here over the years i've had the blessing and opportunity to have my path cross out of brother al pedersen he's told me many times of some of his experiences with brother random's ministry one of the things he often told me was that brother branham's life his ministry was so close to that of jesus not that he was jesus but was so close that's right probably jordan i imagine you've heard him use that very those terms so close that's the word that he uses when he talks to me about it for a while it was so close now i often wondered what was wrong with the people that we refer to as a deity believers the ones who think brother branham was god they pray to him they worship him brother branham spoke against this so strongly but they choose to brush that away as just a smoke screen and persist in their ways i think they have in a kind of a twisted sort of way a glimpse of something but they're not understanding it and that something is what they perceive as divinity in brother branham but i believe they're misinterpreting is the humanity of jesus christ they see a ministry that's been hidden for two millennia they recognize it as the spirit of christ but they can't separate the human from the divine they simply can't recognize that although brother branham had a unique gift he was a man with a gift a human being one who was once a sinner saved by grace and faith in jesus christ rather than worship him they should be trying to imitate him not his ministry his faith his walk as should we all and isn't that what god was trying to show us through his ministry if you can get the people to believe you not to believe in you but believe what you're telling them what did he say operated that gift that healing gift was our faith not his well back to the humanity of jesus to the faith of jesus what is faith anyway brother daniel preached so effectively last sunday morning it's it's based on hope i don't think any of us will forget about the rat swimming paul tells us we in romans 8 24 we are saved by hope but hope that is seen as not hope for what a man sees why does he yet hope for and one of the first verses we read this evening hebrews 11 1 faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen let me share with you two other translations how they rendered this verse for from the complete jewish bible we read trusting is being confident of what we hope for convinced about things we do not see convinced without doubt fully assured next is from the amplified bible now faith is the assurance the confirmation the title deed of the things we hope for being the proof of things we do not see and the conviction of their reality faith perceiving is real fact what is not revealed to the senses brother branham talks about faith the sixth sense and we're trying to look at this from the perspective of the faith of christ so what was his hope what was the unseen thing that he was convinced of that in the end and the final analysis made the way for us that could only come through him only by him acting on his faith come with me to his final night on earth and his physical body after all we're just about a week or so away from the anniversary of that fateful night these are familiar scriptures to us all we'll read from luke's account luke 22 39 and and jesus came out and went as he did so often to the mount of olives his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said to them pray that she and are not into temptation that you don't have a test like i'm about to have and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me. nevertheless not my will but thine be done not my will that's jesus the man this whole prayer this whole episode is jesus the man faith faithfulness obedience and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly it's hard to fathom how his prayer could be anything but earnest but he was in deep travail of his soul his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow said unto them why sleepy rise and pray lest she enter into temptation another version says watch and pray that you might avoid this kind of testing jesus the man knew that a horror awaited him he'd seen people crucified from time to time throughout his life heard their cries saw their unspeakable agony gethsemane was not only his submission to god's will it was to be the preface to his ultimate test of faith and as a result that was his ultimate expression of his faith he awaits his arrest and cruel execution remember faith is based on hope of something never seen what was that which was unseen what was jesus faith well let's read from john 10. he says i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knows me even so i know the father and i lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep i have which are not of this fold that includes me that includes you them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there should be one fold one shepherd therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again there it is he emphasizes this he repeats it no man takes it my life from me i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father a commandment not only that he can but that he must there was division therefore again among the jews for these saying many of them said he has a devil he's mad why do you listen to this guy this is unprecedented it's never happened in the history of our planet raise yourself from the dead after you're dead that's insane must be a delusion from satan himself this is what those people were thinking jesus faith test his ultimate test was that without external intervention by prophets or holy men or angels he would raise himself from death and another place he said i'll do it on the third day unlike lazarus there'd be no one shouting at the mouth of the tomb jesus come forth i will lay down my life and i will take it up again because god my father told me i could that i must and i have complete trust faith and what he shows me the faith of jesus john 5 jesus answered and said unto them fairly verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also do with the son likewise for the father loves the son shows them all things that himself does and he will show himself greater works than these that you may marvel for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them gives him life even so the son quickeneth gives life to whom he will i can do nothing but what the father shows me now jesus had to put this to the test his faith not for lazarus not for healing someone else or even healing himself but for raising himself from among the dead i lay down my life i take it up again that was jesus faith the unseen never happened the ultimate hope now being put to the ultimate test well let's see what transpired matthew 27 46 this is the crucifixion about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying ella alai lama sabachthani which is my god my god why have you forsaken me in my greatest need in my most desperate hour you've abandoned me why some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man calls for elias straight away one of them ran took a sponge filled it with vinegar put it on a reed and gave him to drink the rest said well let's see if elias will come to save him here i've combined what luke and john tell us when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it's finish and when jesus had cried with a loud voice ah he said father yeah the one he just cried out to about forsaking him in his agony and torture father i know you're listening father into thy hands i command my spirit and having said thus he bowed his head and gave up the ghost yielded released his spirit laid down his life just as he said he would time passes friday friday night saturday saturday night sunday morning arrives the third day now when jesus was risen early on the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils easter not hope no longer requiring faith it's now reality it's no longer unseen it's in full view it's physical fact but so incredible that even the faithful who had followed him throughout his ministry didn't believe it not until they saw for themselves and then it no longer required faith john 20 26 after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said shalom peace be to you and he returns to thomas he says thomas reach hither thy finger behold my hands reach into thy hand thrust it into my side be not faithless but believing thomas i imagine he fell down at his feet there but thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god jesus said to him thomas because you've seen me you've believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed faith and are they we must have faith trust in the reports of those who have gone before the gospels the good news not fake news paul's writings the bible that's why jesus said blessed are those who having not seen yet believe speaking of us here tonight you'll each of you are part of scripture fulfilled i hope that tonight you've caught a glimpse of jesus as a man as a human a person not a myth not some divine being we cannot touch a man a very special man to be sure but a man nonetheless upon whom our faith rests should come down one of our opening verses speaking of the faith of that man christ jesus and galatians 2 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified our hope and faith and trust is built on that foundation i like how the complete jewish bible puts this particular verse even so we've come to realize that a person is not declared righteous by god on the ground of his legalistics observance of torah commandments but through the messiah yeshua is trusting faithfulness therefore we too have put our trust in messiah yeshua and become faithful to him in order that we might be declared righteous on the ground of the messiah's trusting faithfulness not on the ground of our legalistic observance of torah commands from the ground of legalism's observance of torah commands no one will be declared righteous not just jesus faith his faithfulness as his brother aaron comes to close the service i wonder if we could sing together greatest thy faithfulness [Music] great is thy faithfulness oh god my father there is no shadow of turning with thee thou changes not by compassion they fail not as thou hast been thou forever will be great is thy faithfulness

when you have something you expect maybe it says it's like clockwork you know it hits a time every time or somebody that is just consistent and maybe your neighbor leaves at six o'clock in the morning every morning to go to work and you hear the car start up and it's kind of you start expecting it and when it doesn't happen you go what happened it becomes apart but great is his faithfulness never once have you said hey lord you missed on something because he's faithful he's the unfailing god he's my lord there is no other none like him what almighty god we serve [Music] but that he took on flesh he was raised as a child this was a pretty good narrative a pretty good story to wrote be able to say he was a child he was a baby when he needed something he had to ask for help if he couldn't get up there he got picked up but he went through those things and there's that long period of time that we don't know because the bible or the history doesn't account for that period of time but we have a pretty good idea by watching our old lives yet he overcame it all amen let's stand i could serve and love a god like that that he became me so that i through his love could become him i i remember [Music] yes we'll sing that song he became me brother mike yarbrough would tell me i just have a hard time with that song how could he become me i'm glad that he did so he would understand
