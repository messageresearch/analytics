[46:53] welcome we want to thank you for all
[46:55] that you have done for us our hearts are
[46:57] full and we're so grateful lord for your
[47:00] goodness
[47:01] we welcome you here be with us lord in
[47:03] this worship time
[47:04] in jesus christ mighty name
[47:07] amen amen
[47:13] all right god bless you
[47:16] well we're happy to be with you this
[47:18] morning we uh we come from connecticut
[47:21] where we're pastoring a small work there
[47:23] been there for about two years
[47:25] and the people love the lord they're
[47:27] they're pressing forward in the name of
[47:28] the lord
[47:30] and so what
[47:31] quite amazing god guides our footsteps
[47:34] and many times you don't know from one
[47:37] step to the next where you're going if
[47:39] we could have confidence in god that he
[47:42] is guiding our steps and renew that
[47:44] confidence every day
[47:46] and so we we realize we don't see the
[47:48] picture in the hole it's always looking
[47:51] back and i'm sure you can relate to that
[47:53] you can look back at your life and say
[47:55] he he didn't miss a beat he knew just
[47:57] what he was doing and you look back you
[48:00] say why would have i ever doubted him
[48:02] it's the same right now
[48:04] and so we experienced that
[48:06] uh just a few years ago god moving us
[48:09] into a foreign land
[48:10] uh their their pastor the past the
[48:13] church that i'm uh pastoring overcomers
[48:15] tabernacle lost their pastor they had
[48:18] turned away and went his way and the
[48:20] church decided to stand and
[48:22] and so long story short the lord had led
[48:25] us up that way
[48:26] a lot of fears and a lot of but you just
[48:29] trust the lord when you feel the nudge
[48:31] you begin to move that way
[48:33] and brother branham said if we pray like
[48:35] we should if you do get out of line
[48:37] you'll pull you right back in line
[48:39] and so we got in we got situated it took
[48:42] us six months to find a house
[48:44] and just as we got in the house coveted
[48:46] fell
[48:47] well there was no visiting preachers
[48:49] coming for about a year and a half and
[48:50] god knew all about it
[48:52] and so we labored away and and now it's
[48:55] beginning to open and clear up a little
[48:57] bit we're getting ministers in which is
[48:58] great
[48:59] and but
[49:01] this preacher was tired so
[49:03] we thought you know what we're going to
[49:04] go out to arizona
[49:06] and uh we're going to visit family this
[49:08] is where my mother-in-law is rachel shaw
[49:11] uh is and so we we thought we'd all come
[49:14] the adams family the boer family and
[49:16] sister rachel sister helen we come have
[49:18] thanksgiving
[49:20] and as i had told you we were just
[49:22] pulling in when we heard about sister
[49:24] helen fallen so
[49:26] we're waiting for the next step in the
[49:28] lord
[49:29] and we're happy to have believers to
[49:31] believe with and to worship with
[49:34] believers that are believing that it's
[49:36] our time to get out of here
[49:39] we have believed in the coming of the
[49:41] lord for a long time
[49:43] but but there's never been a day like
[49:44] this day
[49:46] and everything that we have believed has
[49:48] been such a time as this
[49:51] and now it's time to take the things
[49:53] that we have learned to move forward in
[49:55] faith and i believe that we have a body
[49:57] change just a route ready to break into
[49:59] that next dimension
[50:01] so it's not time to lose heart
[50:03] it's time to believe with everything in
[50:05] us
[50:05] hold our heads up and god will not fail
[50:08] us
[50:09] so we're just looking forward to the
[50:10] word of god this morning
[50:12] and we just i'm going to meet new
[50:14] friends i'm sure today
[50:16] but we all believe the same thing we're
[50:18] following the same message
[50:20] as the prophet of god taught us there's
[50:22] one church one lord one baptism one
[50:24] blood we're going to one kingdom and
[50:27] there is one faith so we are happy to be
[50:29] joined together with you this morning
[50:31] god bless you is my
[50:38] prayer amen amen so i've heard his name
[50:42] seen him in
[50:43] on videos but get to meet him so
[50:46] one of these days there'll be no more
[50:47] party time
[50:49] amen
[50:50] you'll have a thousand years to sit down
[50:52] with somebody and talk to them with no
[50:53] hurry
[50:54] you know because oh my none of this is
[50:57] it time to go somewhere else yet no amen
[51:00] we have another song special with the
[51:03] part of the adam's family i'm not too
[51:05] sure so if they'll make their way a
[51:06] couple announcements
[51:10] brother keith and sister joyce dougal 68
[51:13] years married today
[51:15] well they're not here this morning
[51:19] god
[51:20] got a chance to
[51:22] talk with her for a little while shared
[51:24] some of her testimony and you look back
[51:26] and you see god in your life
[51:29] amen and be willing to testify of it
[51:33] so she was sharing some of how the lord
[51:35] brought them brought them out to this
[51:37] place in life so

[51:48] tabernacle for youth service it's going

[52:12] desert be here right here at the
[52:13] tabernacle so that that's a policy we're

[1:04:13] sister anna and the kids and my
[1:04:15] mother-in-law who comes to hear our
[1:04:16] favorite son-in-law preach this morning
[1:04:20] you know she has a she has this tough
[1:04:21] battle
[1:04:22] you know
[1:04:24] two two son-in-laws who are preachers
[1:04:27] one who's right there in a neighborhood
[1:04:28] another one who's taken his wife and his
[1:04:31] kids far far far away
[1:04:35] yeah i'm the favorite y'all don't worry
[1:04:38] but we're glad to have all of our family
[1:04:40] here and we pray a special blessing upon
[1:04:42] sister helen i gotta touch her in a
[1:04:44] special way and i'm glad to have my wife
[1:04:46] and my kids here and wonderful job
[1:04:48] rebecca and jessica on your song enjoyed
[1:04:50] all the specials weren't they
[1:04:52] wonderful well this morning we're going
[1:04:55] to jump into the word this morning many
[1:04:57] of you you've
[1:04:58] well you know how i preach and i ask the
[1:05:00] lord just to help me slow down a little
[1:05:02] bit
[1:05:03] so it doesn't go over top of your head
[1:05:05] but not that it's going to be anything
[1:05:06] real depth but it's going to be that
[1:05:08] it's too fast or too emphatic or too
[1:05:10] emotional and to this and to that
[1:05:12] sometimes we get hung up on those things
[1:05:14] but we're just going to allow ourselves
[1:05:15] to be free this morning and i want to
[1:05:17] speak to you out of a common scripture
[1:05:19] that i believe we can see right on the
[1:05:20] back wall hebrews 13 and 8.
[1:05:25] this was the theme of brother branham's
[1:05:27] ministry
[1:05:28] and i believe if it's the theme of
[1:05:29] brother brandon's ministry then it also
[1:05:31] has to be the theme of the bride's
[1:05:33] ministry
[1:05:34] and we find here in hebrews 13 and verse
[1:05:36] 8 jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:05:40] today and forever and verse 9 and be not
[1:05:44] carried about with divers and strange
[1:05:47] doctrines
[1:05:48] i think if there's ever was a time to
[1:05:50] not be carried away with divers and
[1:05:52] strange doctrines that's today because
[1:05:54] there's so much that flows or follows
[1:05:57] this this message that we have and some
[1:05:59] of those doctrines that are going on are
[1:06:01] going around are not entwined with
[1:06:02] really what we believe and the scripture
[1:06:04] says for it is a good thing that the
[1:06:06] heart be established with grace
[1:06:08] not with meats
[1:06:10] which have not profited them that have
[1:06:12] been occupied therein so we just want to
[1:06:14] thank the lord this morning you can have
[1:06:15] your seats
[1:06:17] if i was to give this a a thought
[1:06:20] i want to speak to you on jesus christ
[1:06:22] the same but i want to emphasize today
[1:06:27] jesus christ the same but i want to put
[1:06:29] our focus on today and i give it a
[1:06:32] subtitle i want to say serves we are
[1:06:34] seeing jesus
[1:06:37] and brother branham was saying the
[1:06:38] message serves we would see jesus he
[1:06:40] said the bible said that he's the same
[1:06:43] yesterday
[1:06:44] today and forever he ever remains god
[1:06:49] and he is just now i want you to clue in
[1:06:51] on this he is just as great with his
[1:06:53] people
[1:06:54] when he finds believers today as he ever
[1:06:57] was
[1:06:59] so he's just as much god today as he
[1:07:02] finds those real true believers that he
[1:07:05] ever was now through any age he's as
[1:07:08] much god for you and for your need and
[1:07:10] for your situation as he ever was god
[1:07:14] and he says and i believe this word
[1:07:17] to be the bible or the bible to be the
[1:07:20] word of god just no more no less i know
[1:07:22] that god can do things
[1:07:24] that is not written in the bible because
[1:07:26] he is god but as long as i know that
[1:07:29] what i see him doing he has it written
[1:07:31] in here
[1:07:33] that he will do it then i know that i'm
[1:07:34] right and that way and he says it just
[1:07:36] keeps that much it'll be just enough for
[1:07:38] me because i see that it's in there he
[1:07:40] was wounded for my transgressions bruce
[1:07:43] for my iniquities the chastisement of my
[1:07:45] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:07:48] i was healed
[1:07:51] now he also says in blind baltimos and
[1:07:54] i'm just going to take my time this
[1:07:55] morning to build
[1:07:56] to build this because i don't want us to
[1:07:58] miss this because i believe so many
[1:07:59] times we as a message group or message
[1:08:01] people we're always looking back
[1:08:04] we're always looking the prophet god
[1:08:06] said you can't look back and go forward
[1:08:08] or you can't you can't drive looking
[1:08:10] back in the rearview mirror you're going
[1:08:11] to rack up
[1:08:13] so if you're going forward but yet
[1:08:14] you're looking in the rearview mirror
[1:08:16] you may hit something along the way
[1:08:18] and then you're just kind of like what
[1:08:19] happened what got in my way well you're
[1:08:21] looking the wrong direction
[1:08:24] he says he goes that's what's the
[1:08:25] trouble today we have so much of this
[1:08:27] thing that god was but he isn't now
[1:08:31] god was a healer in the 50s and the 60s
[1:08:34] but he's not so much that same god today
[1:08:37] god did this yesterday but he's not so
[1:08:40] much god today
[1:08:42] he says the bible said that he's the
[1:08:44] same yesterday today and forever just as
[1:08:47] much god today as he was
[1:08:50] then let me tell you church he's is just
[1:08:53] as much god today for your situation for
[1:08:57] your need that he ever was god he was as
[1:09:01] much god for you this morning as he was
[1:09:03] for blind bartimaeus when he come
[1:09:05] walking by and a blind man begin to
[1:09:08] scream out thou son of david have mercy
[1:09:11] on me he's as much god for you if you'll
[1:09:14] take that same approach thou son of god
[1:09:17] have mercy on me this morning have mercy
[1:09:20] on my need this morning
[1:09:22] because he's jesus christ the same today
[1:09:26] today
[1:09:28] for your need this moment this hour this
[1:09:31] minute this service today
[1:09:34] he says if he ever was god he will
[1:09:37] always be god how many of you ever hit a
[1:09:40] real low point in life
[1:09:42] some of y'all didn't show up for church
[1:09:44] didn't you
[1:09:46] we all have hit those moments where
[1:09:47] you're like man you feel like throwing
[1:09:49] in the towel
[1:09:52] let me start my clock
[1:09:54] so y'all got about 10 minutes free
[1:09:56] i'm not going to charge you for that 10.
[1:10:00] but there's times that we hit those low
[1:10:02] points
[1:10:04] sometimes we feel like giving up
[1:10:07] but he
[1:10:09] is as much god in your low points
[1:10:12] in your low moments
[1:10:13] as he is god when you're on your
[1:10:15] mountain top
[1:10:16] when you're rejoicing and everything's
[1:10:18] great and my life is wonderful and
[1:10:20] everything's just mind you it couldn't
[1:10:22] get any better
[1:10:24] but he's as much god on your mountain
[1:10:26] top as he is in your valleys
[1:10:28] and the problem of god will say if he
[1:10:30] ever was god
[1:10:31] he will always be god he cannot die
[1:10:35] he cannot get old he cannot change his
[1:10:38] mind he cannot make any new decisions on
[1:10:40] things that he's already made decisions
[1:10:42] on his first decision was right and it
[1:10:45] has to forever be right or he made the
[1:10:47] wrong decision when he made it the first
[1:10:50] time
[1:10:52] see he has to ever keep his first
[1:10:54] decision because he's perfect he's
[1:10:57] infinite and he cannot change let me ask
[1:11:00] you this morning how many you've been
[1:11:01] called by god
[1:11:04] then god can't change his mind about you
[1:11:06] this morning if god ever calls you god
[1:11:09] don't uncall you
[1:11:10] god's not like frickle man one minute
[1:11:13] you're on his
[1:11:14] his great list the next minute he's
[1:11:16] gonna check you off
[1:11:18] you know we used to have those little
[1:11:19] roses or flowers you'd say she loves me
[1:11:22] she loves me not
[1:11:23] how many have ever done that i'm
[1:11:24] reaching back right yeah some of y'all
[1:11:26] when y'all remember that oh she loves me
[1:11:29] she loves me not
[1:11:30] she loves me brother aaron she loves me
[1:11:32] i hope it finds that she loves me if
[1:11:34] that's the last pedal that's not god
[1:11:37] god doesn't operate that way god saw he
[1:11:40] was in the very thoughts of god before
[1:11:42] there ever was a star that was formed
[1:11:44] before there ever was a solar system you
[1:11:46] were in the mind of god and god saw you
[1:11:49] at your weakest and yet god saw yet your
[1:11:52] best and god called you when you didn't
[1:11:54] when you didn't have a desire to serve
[1:11:56] god god done this and god loves you this
[1:11:58] morning and he's here to tell you i'm
[1:12:00] the same today
[1:12:02] i'm the same god today as i was when you
[1:12:05] was on your mountaintop in your lowest
[1:12:07] moment i'm gonna be there for you
[1:12:11] notice the problem of god will say
[1:12:12] that's a consolation that we must have
[1:12:14] anybody seeking god must have that firm
[1:12:17] consolation that god cannot change
[1:12:22] so in the midst of your uncertainties
[1:12:25] when you're facing the most difficult
[1:12:26] trials of life
[1:12:28] when the sicknesses is threatening to
[1:12:29] take your life when you're at your
[1:12:31] lowest point and you don't see how you
[1:12:33] can keep going you've got to have that
[1:12:35] consolation
[1:12:37] that god doesn't change
[1:12:39] and not only that god doesn't change
[1:12:42] that god doesn't change his thoughts
[1:12:44] about me
[1:12:46] god called me and because you mess up or
[1:12:49] because you make a mistake god doesn't
[1:12:51] uncall you because of that god saw you
[1:12:53] making that mistake and yet god put a
[1:12:55] greater desire god's going to come by
[1:12:57] and give a conviction make that thing
[1:12:59] right and serve god keep pressing
[1:13:01] forward and that's the kind of life that
[1:13:03] we got to have we got to add that
[1:13:04] consolation that hero israel the lord
[1:13:07] thy god is one and the lord cannot
[1:13:10] change his mind his thoughts his
[1:13:12] intentions about you this morning has
[1:13:14] that bright body god has called you for
[1:13:16] a purpose
[1:13:19] so you got to have that consolation
[1:13:21] god doesn't ever change
[1:13:23] and let me just tell you god can't
[1:13:25] change god won't change and god doesn't
[1:13:27] change
[1:13:30] he called you for a purpose
[1:13:33] and nothing that you will do in this
[1:13:35] life
[1:13:36] is going to stop the purpose and plan of
[1:13:38] god
[1:13:40] do you hear me this morning
[1:13:42] nothing that you do nothing that you
[1:13:44] face no trial that you'll go through
[1:13:47] will stop the purpose and plan of god
[1:13:50] for your life
[1:13:53] let me just say it to some of you moms
[1:13:54] and dad who's got wayward children out
[1:13:56] there there's nothing can stop the
[1:13:58] purpose of god god gave you the
[1:14:01] offspring god's willing to go after the
[1:14:03] offspring because god stalls for you and
[1:14:06] for your offspring doesn't change he's
[1:14:08] still god
[1:14:12] he's god today
[1:14:15] we've got to open our eyes to see this
[1:14:17] same god
[1:14:20] we find in john 1 and verse 1 says in
[1:14:22] the beginning was the word
[1:14:24] the word was with god and the word was
[1:14:27] god in verse 14
[1:14:28] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:14:31] among us
[1:14:32] and we beheld his glory the glory as the
[1:14:36] only begotten of the father full of
[1:14:37] grace
[1:14:39] and truth
[1:14:40] brother brown says in the token message
[1:14:42] now satan has thrown all kind of
[1:14:43] counterfeits
[1:14:44] and shaking of hands and evidences and
[1:14:46] everything like that he says forget it
[1:14:48] the hour has arrived
[1:14:51] that the token itself
[1:14:53] not some counterfeit
[1:14:55] not some make belief
[1:14:57] not some substitutionary anything the
[1:15:00] hour is here when the token himself is
[1:15:04] identifying himself right among
[1:15:08] us
[1:15:09] notice the token the life is identifying
[1:15:13] himself right among us how does he do
[1:15:16] that
[1:15:17] how does it because we claim god sent a
[1:15:19] prophet is that god manifesting himself
[1:15:22] among us
[1:15:23] no
[1:15:25] he says and proving that he's the same
[1:15:27] yesterday today improv and he is right
[1:15:30] with the word it's got to be a plot a
[1:15:33] man that says he's got to toke him and
[1:15:35] deny this word then what about that
[1:15:39] see you can't do it the token has got to
[1:15:41] be there the blood shall be a token unto
[1:15:44] you now the holy spirit the life that
[1:15:46] was in the blood is a token unto you the
[1:15:48] holy ghost is the token the case is
[1:15:52] closed
[1:15:53] so we find the hour has arrived that the
[1:15:56] token the life of christ has got to be
[1:15:59] on display of every born again son and
[1:16:02] daughter of god not some intellectual
[1:16:04] understanding not some tattoo of what
[1:16:07] you think about it but the life of
[1:16:09] christ has got to be on display that's
[1:16:11] proven that he is the same today
[1:16:16] that's proven that he is the same
[1:16:18] today look we can't just talk about the
[1:16:20] message
[1:16:22] we just can't talk about what happened
[1:16:24] yesterday
[1:16:26] as if it's a history lesson
[1:16:28] well you know many times when i first
[1:16:30] came to the message 20 years ago or so i
[1:16:32] remember we'd have you know you have
[1:16:34] bible drills and then we have message
[1:16:36] drills and you know question and answers
[1:16:38] or bible trivia message trivia and we
[1:16:40] had all these trivias but what does that
[1:16:42] have to do
[1:16:43] with him being the same
[1:16:45] how many of those burke calls real name
[1:16:49] for some of us that's all we do we try
[1:16:50] to find every little thing in the
[1:16:51] message and try to figure out this this
[1:16:53] and this and this but yet it has no
[1:16:55] bearing on him being the same
[1:16:57] i could care less what bert calls name
[1:16:59] is but i know one thing he got changed
[1:17:02] he saw a life being displayed in front
[1:17:04] of him and that life and that little doe
[1:17:06] deer changed a man who was hard-hearted
[1:17:09] that's what i'm looking for not what his
[1:17:11] name was but what the change came
[1:17:14] because why because he's the same jesus
[1:17:16] today
[1:17:18] see we look back and we find oh we got
[1:17:20] great intellectual understandings of
[1:17:22] this message especially out here in
[1:17:24] arizona right
[1:17:26] we got sunset mountain and we got this
[1:17:28] and the prophet lived out his last years
[1:17:30] here and we got and i'm not taking
[1:17:32] anything back from that but guys
[1:17:34] church it's got to be more than what the
[1:17:37] prophet did
[1:17:39] hear me this morning it's got to be more
[1:17:41] than a prophet message it's got to be
[1:17:44] your message it's got to be your life
[1:17:47] he's got to be your god he's got to
[1:17:49] change your heart he's got to be the
[1:17:51] same for you today as it was with
[1:17:53] william branham in the 50s in the 60s
[1:17:55] he's got to be that kind of god for a
[1:17:57] people today
[1:17:58] because he is the same he didn't stop
[1:18:01] being god in a car wreck in the 1960s
[1:18:04] he's as much god today he's as a muslim
[1:18:07] today he's a healer today he's a
[1:18:09] deliverer today he's a satisfier today
[1:18:12] if you can see him in the form in which
[1:18:14] he's in
[1:18:17] notice the seals
[1:18:20] the seals have been open
[1:18:22] the word has been restored
[1:18:25] and it's high time that the people
[1:18:27] become the word of god
[1:18:30] how do we become the word the prophet of
[1:18:31] god will say you become the word as you
[1:18:34] receive the word
[1:18:36] so let us receive the word
[1:18:40] see i believe brother brown says now the
[1:18:42] perseverance he goes i believe
[1:18:44] that the virtue is in christ and christ
[1:18:46] is the word
[1:18:47] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:18:49] was with god the word was god and the
[1:18:51] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:18:54] now the word itself comes back in the
[1:18:56] form notice the word itself
[1:19:00] comes back in the form of the holy
[1:19:02] spirit into us
[1:19:04] and its word in
[1:19:06] you
[1:19:08] it's word
[1:19:09] in
[1:19:10] you
[1:19:12] oh i love this
[1:19:14] see
[1:19:15] god in you oh my
[1:19:18] brother and you woke up this morning you
[1:19:19] looked in the mirror your hair was all
[1:19:21] disheveled
[1:19:23] you didn't feel like it you were aching
[1:19:25] your back's hurting this and that you
[1:19:27] didn't feel like there was anything
[1:19:28] laying inside of you
[1:19:30] we look at our frail humanity and some
[1:19:31] of us we're getting more wrinkled every
[1:19:33] day
[1:19:34] you got aches and pains you didn't know
[1:19:36] you had muscles
[1:19:38] and yet every day yeah in your frail
[1:19:40] humanity god is laying behind that and
[1:19:43] saying i'm as much god for this morning
[1:19:45] for you and for your situation
[1:19:48] but many times we're blinded or we're
[1:19:50] we're blinded by our humanity and our
[1:19:52] failures and our disappointments and our
[1:19:54] inconsistencies but yet the whole time
[1:19:57] god is laying there he's as much god and
[1:19:59] your weakness as he ever was in your
[1:20:01] strength
[1:20:04] he says now the word itself comes back
[1:20:06] in the form of the holy spirit into us
[1:20:07] it's worthy and you god and you so many
[1:20:10] wants to point back to god to some
[1:20:12] mystical something way away or some far
[1:20:15] away they overreach it god is in you
[1:20:22] god in you the hope of glory
[1:20:25] oh where should our hope be
[1:20:28] see
[1:20:29] he says now christ the mind that was in
[1:20:31] christ is in you
[1:20:33] and we look at first claw not first
[1:20:35] colossians but colossians 1 26 even the
[1:20:37] mystery
[1:20:38] or the secret
[1:20:40] which had been hid from ages and from
[1:20:42] generations but now
[1:20:45] that word now is at this very moment
[1:20:49] so don't think about this as yesterday
[1:20:50] think about this as this service this
[1:20:52] morning god preordained predetermined
[1:20:55] and
[1:20:56] and you're here for a purpose
[1:20:59] oh it's thanksgiving i just come to see
[1:21:01] the family oh no
[1:21:02] that's just the mechanism by which god
[1:21:04] used to get you here
[1:21:06] this is a preordained moment for some of
[1:21:08] you this morning
[1:21:09] see even the mystery the secret that's
[1:21:11] been hit from all the ages and from
[1:21:13] generations but this moment is being
[1:21:16] made manifest that word manifest is
[1:21:19] being made visible
[1:21:21] in his saints
[1:21:24] to whom god will make known what is the
[1:21:27] riches of his glory them of this mystery
[1:21:29] among the gentiles which is christ
[1:21:32] in you the hope of glory
[1:21:34] so we find god is going to make known or
[1:21:36] reveal
[1:21:37] the riches the wealth the fullness the
[1:21:41] abundance of his glory
[1:21:44] his magnificence his excellence his
[1:21:47] preeminence his reputation
[1:21:50] he's going to reveal he's going to
[1:21:51] reveal what the mystery the secret among
[1:21:54] who the gentiles the unworthy people
[1:21:58] otherwise an implication of pagans
[1:22:01] heathens
[1:22:02] a nation that was without god and yet
[1:22:05] god christ has anointed you to receive
[1:22:08] this mystery
[1:22:10] no longer is it god
[1:22:12] in the pages of the bible
[1:22:15] no longer is god predetermined for just
[1:22:18] a jewish nation but now it's god in you
[1:22:22] god in you god in you
[1:22:25] the hope of glory not god somewhere else
[1:22:28] not god in your neighbor not god in the
[1:22:30] preacher not god and the deacons not god
[1:22:32] in in these great men but god in
[1:22:35] you
[1:22:37] see we find many times we want to put it
[1:22:39] on brother brandon we want to put it on
[1:22:40] the prophets we want to put it on the
[1:22:42] ministries we want to put it on the
[1:22:43] deacons but the same anointing that was
[1:22:45] on jesus when he made the word manifest
[1:22:48] is the same anointing that's here this
[1:22:50] morning to make that word manifest in a
[1:22:53] bright body
[1:22:54] the same holy ghost the same anointing
[1:22:57] the same spirit it's christ among you
[1:22:59] christ in you is the hope of glory if we
[1:23:02] didn't have christ in it where would our
[1:23:03] hope be this morning
[1:23:06] and the prophet of god said i believe we
[1:23:08] can hang our soul on any word of the
[1:23:10] bible
[1:23:11] hang your soul on he's going to judge
[1:23:13] the world
[1:23:15] was he going to judge him by jesus
[1:23:16] christ this
[1:23:18] word but you know what
[1:23:21] this word is going to pass away one day
[1:23:24] this bible not the word because the
[1:23:25] bible says that his word heavens and
[1:23:27] earth will pass away but his word but
[1:23:29] the words on this bible
[1:23:31] is no more than any other book unless
[1:23:34] the words on this bible take flesh
[1:23:38] unless the words on this bible come off
[1:23:41] the pages of this bible and become a
[1:23:43] living manifested breathing article
[1:23:47] that's what he meant when he says
[1:23:48] heavens and earth are gonna pass away
[1:23:50] but my word will never pass away because
[1:23:53] my worth is eternal my people are
[1:23:56] eternal because my spirit that's upon
[1:23:58] this word which is believed in the heart
[1:24:01] and take it into the soul it becomes an
[1:24:03] eternal being it becomes a manifesting
[1:24:06] living breathing word
[1:24:08] and it can't pass away you've got zoe
[1:24:10] life eternal life you can no more die
[1:24:13] than god can die
[1:24:17] so we find that god is going to judge
[1:24:19] the world by the word otherwise he's
[1:24:22] going to judge the world by the life
[1:24:24] that you live
[1:24:26] as you manifest the word
[1:24:30] as you make this word
[1:24:32] produce
[1:24:34] what it says it'll produce he's going to
[1:24:36] judge this world by your testimony
[1:24:40] see the word may manifest is in you
[1:24:42] that's the standard and yet the enemy
[1:24:44] comes in and he assaults you
[1:24:46] but every time he comes in and assaults
[1:24:48] you god
[1:24:49] raises the standard
[1:24:51] he lifts you up to a higher realm he
[1:24:54] gives you a greater revelation of who he
[1:24:56] is so that you can have a greater
[1:24:59] dependence upon him that he'll never
[1:25:01] leave you nor will he forsake see satan
[1:25:03] wants you to point to your failures he
[1:25:06] wants you to see your faults he wants
[1:25:07] you to see your inconsistency he stands
[1:25:09] there at every turn accusing you of this
[1:25:12] and accusing you of that and pointing at
[1:25:14] your mistakes but god is there
[1:25:17] pointing you back to who you are
[1:25:21] you're not what the enemy declares you
[1:25:23] to be
[1:25:24] hear my word and as i'm as much god in
[1:25:27] you today as i ever have been god
[1:25:31] but many of us we find it hard to see
[1:25:34] that jesus
[1:25:35] would come and tabernacle
[1:25:38] my humanity
[1:25:41] well you know i got my failures that's
[1:25:43] my family they'll tell you
[1:25:44] ask any of our families they'll tell you
[1:25:47] and that's the problem sometimes we
[1:25:48] don't want to get close to the ministry
[1:25:49] because the closer you get to the
[1:25:51] ministry you realize the ministry is
[1:25:52] human
[1:25:54] and a ministry has failures too the
[1:25:56] ministers are no different than you just
[1:25:58] have a different office
[1:26:00] so we need god each and every day and we
[1:26:02] need this god coming and showing us that
[1:26:04] you're my children see
[1:26:07] god sent us a prophet for one purpose to
[1:26:10] turn your heart back
[1:26:12] to who your true identity is which is
[1:26:15] his word
[1:26:16] see turn your hearts away from your
[1:26:18] failures turn your eyes away from creeds
[1:26:21] and doctrines and dogmas and turn your
[1:26:24] heart back to jesus
[1:26:26] not jesus of 2000 years ago but jesus
[1:26:29] today because he's the same today and if
[1:26:33] he can get you to see who he is if he
[1:26:35] can get you to see where he is then
[1:26:37] you'll never have another disappointment
[1:26:39] because you realize he's not in the
[1:26:41] history book he's a living god he's as
[1:26:44] much god for me this moment as he ever
[1:26:46] was god as he walked the shores of
[1:26:48] galilee he's here walking the shores of
[1:26:51] the tabernacle
[1:26:56] john 12 and verse 20.
[1:26:58] this is where i got the thought of this
[1:27:00] message
[1:27:02] and there were certain greeks among them
[1:27:04] that came to worship at the feast
[1:27:08] and there are certain believers this
[1:27:09] morning that came to the tabernacle to
[1:27:11] worship
[1:27:12] at the feast
[1:27:15] and the same came therefore to philip
[1:27:16] which was a bethesda of galilee and they
[1:27:19] desired him saying sir
[1:27:21] we would see jesus
[1:27:24] notice there was something
[1:27:26] that was pulling these men
[1:27:28] they had heard
[1:27:30] about the miracles
[1:27:32] they had heard
[1:27:34] about the prayer lines they had heard
[1:27:37] about the supernatural
[1:27:38] they had heard about blind bartimaeus
[1:27:40] receiving a sight of mark 10.
[1:27:42] they heard about how he healed a
[1:27:44] nobleman's son in john 4. they had heard
[1:27:47] about evil spirits being cast out of a
[1:27:48] man in mark 1. they heard about the
[1:27:51] healing of the leper in matthew 8. the
[1:27:53] widow's son of name who was raised in
[1:27:56] matthew or in luke 7. they heard about
[1:27:59] jairus daughter
[1:28:01] in mark 5 and the woman who touched him
[1:28:03] of his garment
[1:28:05] they heard about the feeding of the 5000
[1:28:07] and probably one of my most favorite
[1:28:08] scriptures in all the in all the
[1:28:10] scriptures is how he took something so
[1:28:13] little
[1:28:14] and did something so miraculous
[1:28:17] they heard about it they heard about how
[1:28:19] he walked on water in john 6
[1:28:23] and yet they heard all these things
[1:28:26] but they wasn't satisfied with just
[1:28:27] hearing about it
[1:28:29] sirs we want to see that same god
[1:28:33] we want to see that same manifestation
[1:28:35] today
[1:28:38] oh church let that be our desire we
[1:28:40] heard about the supernatural
[1:28:42] my you can we got 1200 sermons and you
[1:28:45] can go back and if you if you're a
[1:28:46] student of this message and you listen
[1:28:48] to the end of the services and you can
[1:28:50] see i've just listened to one yesterday
[1:28:52] and how brother brandon began to pray
[1:28:54] and i think it was knocking on the door
[1:28:55] of jesus knocking on the door in 1958 at
[1:28:57] the end of the service there was a man
[1:28:59] there in the wheelchair and he says if
[1:29:01] you'll get up out of that wheelchair and
[1:29:02] push it away he says god will heal you
[1:29:04] right now and he get up out of that
[1:29:05] wheelchair and begin to push it we have
[1:29:07] heard about the supernatural but what
[1:29:09] about him today
[1:29:11] what about that same god manifesting
[1:29:14] himself the same today for your need for
[1:29:17] your situation i'm going to declare to
[1:29:19] you jesus christ is the same today
[1:29:24] he is the same today
[1:29:29] we heard about the miracles we heard
[1:29:31] about the healings we heard about the
[1:29:32] raising of the dead we heard about these
[1:29:35] things but we want to see them
[1:29:38] i thank god he sent us a prophet i thank
[1:29:40] god the supernatural was performed in
[1:29:42] our midst but i'm not looking back to a
[1:29:44] prophet i'm looking to jesus today
[1:29:46] i want to see the same signs i want to
[1:29:49] see the same wonders i want to see the
[1:29:51] same power i want to see the same
[1:29:53] manifestation
[1:29:54] and the word tells me that i can because
[1:29:56] he's the same
[1:29:59] we don't want to just hear about jesus
[1:30:01] of 2000 years ago
[1:30:03] and we don't want to just hear about
[1:30:04] jesus of 60 years ago
[1:30:06] sirs we want to see jesus today
[1:30:09] we want to meet this same jesus today we
[1:30:12] want to be changed by this same jesus
[1:30:15] today and when you meet jesus others
[1:30:18] will see him
[1:30:19] they will see that his love is the same
[1:30:21] they will see that his mercy is extended
[1:30:24] they'll see his grace being manifested
[1:30:26] they'll see the joy of the lord all over
[1:30:28] your face they'll see forgiveness
[1:30:32] whenever once we're bitterness they'll
[1:30:34] see redemption from once with shame
[1:30:37] they'll see a healer but once you laid
[1:30:40] in sickness
[1:30:42] they'll see jesus the same now notice
[1:30:46] he's the same in every detail
[1:30:50] except the corporal body
[1:30:54] he's the same now in every detail except
[1:30:58] his corporal body brother man will tell
[1:31:00] us in blind baltimos he says now
[1:31:02] and he's got to be the same in principle
[1:31:06] the same in power
[1:31:08] the same in every way only in the
[1:31:11] corporal body and he's using
[1:31:14] us
[1:31:16] oh
[1:31:17] my
[1:31:19] oh
[1:31:20] my
[1:31:22] you mean he's the same brother joe in
[1:31:24] every detail there's only one thing
[1:31:26] that's different he's using
[1:31:28] you
[1:31:30] oh well we just thought it was for the
[1:31:32] ministry we just thought it was for
[1:31:34] brother branham we just thought it was
[1:31:36] for wesley and we thought it was for
[1:31:37] martin we thought for all the churches
[1:31:40] no he said he's the same in every detail
[1:31:44] every minute detail in which he was when
[1:31:47] he walked the shores of galilee when he
[1:31:50] opened the blinded eyes when he healed
[1:31:52] the lepers when he raised the dead when
[1:31:54] he performed prayer line after prayer
[1:31:56] line after a prayer line i'm here to
[1:31:58] tell you church he's the same in every
[1:32:00] detail but now he's using your vessel
[1:32:03] now he's using us we're the only hands
[1:32:06] that jesus has we're the only think that
[1:32:09] jesus has you are the very manifestation
[1:32:12] of jesus christ today
[1:32:14] and he's saying he's not lost one ounce
[1:32:17] of power brother
[1:32:20] see jesus don't have any hands but yours
[1:32:22] and mine
[1:32:23] oh
[1:32:24] see what are we
[1:32:26] he said he is the vine we are the
[1:32:28] branches is that right the vine don't
[1:32:30] bear fruit or the branches bear fruit is
[1:32:32] that right you don't take the fruit off
[1:32:34] the vine you take it off the branch
[1:32:37] so but the energy is in the branch and
[1:32:39] it comes to the vine or through the vine
[1:32:41] it says and if it's in the tree it'll
[1:32:43] bear the same kind of fruit that the
[1:32:45] tree is so that makes jesus christ
[1:32:48] the same yesterday
[1:32:50] today and forever
[1:32:52] and brother makes a statement here in
[1:32:54] god called man
[1:32:56] he says my contentions is this
[1:32:58] that jesus christ remains the same
[1:33:02] yesterday
[1:33:03] today and forever
[1:33:06] my contentions otherwise he's saying i'm
[1:33:09] laying this
[1:33:10] here
[1:33:11] this is my belief
[1:33:14] if it was the theme of his ministry then
[1:33:17] it's got to be the theme of our ministry
[1:33:19] now that jesus christ is the same
[1:33:24] he is the same
[1:33:27] not just yesterday
[1:33:29] get your eyes off of yesterday
[1:33:32] oh put your eyes on who he is today
[1:33:35] where he is today and oh let me tell you
[1:33:37] church if you could just catch that
[1:33:38] revelation
[1:33:40] man it'll make the hardest trial so much
[1:33:42] more bearable because now you realize it
[1:33:44] ain't me he's the same today he's with
[1:33:46] me today if he was with the the the
[1:33:48] disciples in their ship when they were
[1:33:50] being tossed about and they were afraid
[1:33:52] and yet they woke a master oh do you not
[1:33:55] care that we perish and he woke up and
[1:33:57] he says now
[1:33:59] thou foolish and slow a heart
[1:34:03] many times we let the winds and the
[1:34:05] waves distract us from who's in our ship
[1:34:08] you can't falter you can't fail you
[1:34:10] can't go down in defeat because jesus
[1:34:13] christ is living not just among us
[1:34:16] church he's living in you
[1:34:19] oh my
[1:34:20] what a revelation
[1:34:21] what a promise that we have as a
[1:34:23] believing group
[1:34:26] my contentions is that jesus christ is
[1:34:28] the same yesterday today and for now he
[1:34:32] says now if he is the same then he's got
[1:34:34] to be the same in every principle and
[1:34:36] power and same might and same everything
[1:34:39] that he was and i believe that this is
[1:34:41] the desire of every man and woman that
[1:34:43] ever heard of jesus they want to see him
[1:34:46] and if if he isn't the same then we
[1:34:48] cannot see him but if he is the same
[1:34:51] then we can't see him or he told
[1:34:53] something wrong
[1:34:54] he said a little while the world seeth
[1:34:56] me no more but yet you shall see me for
[1:34:58] i personal no pronoun will be with you
[1:35:01] even in you even to the end of the age
[1:35:03] and then jesus promised to be in his
[1:35:06] church notice how many is his church
[1:35:09] let me get a show of hands church
[1:35:11] i want full attendance this morning how
[1:35:13] many is his church this morning i'm the
[1:35:15] church here i am brother joe he says now
[1:35:17] notice what he says and jesus promised
[1:35:20] to be in his church doing the same
[1:35:23] things that he did then
[1:35:26] until the end of the age so he says a
[1:35:29] little while the world won't see me but
[1:35:31] you're going to see me
[1:35:33] you're going to see me because i'm going
[1:35:34] to manifest myself through your life
[1:35:37] through your ministry through your
[1:35:39] church through your family through your
[1:35:41] children i'm gonna manifest myself as
[1:35:43] the same
[1:35:45] oh hallelujah he goes oh we have to see
[1:35:48] his spirit if his spirit is in us then
[1:35:50] we will see he says if his spirit is in
[1:35:52] us and that spirit would have to do the
[1:35:54] same thing that he did then or it
[1:35:56] wouldn't be the same
[1:36:00] my brother joe we believe god
[1:36:02] but we don't believe
[1:36:04] that he still does the same things today
[1:36:09] the healing was the thing of the past
[1:36:12] miracles
[1:36:13] are past us now we're in a different age
[1:36:16] don't you know i mean come on brother
[1:36:18] joe
[1:36:18] you still holding on to those things
[1:36:21] yes i'm holding on to it because he's
[1:36:22] insane
[1:36:25] second corinthians 3 and verse 2 says
[1:36:27] you are an epistle or a letter written
[1:36:29] in the hearts known and read of all men
[1:36:31] for so much as you are manifestly
[1:36:33] declared
[1:36:35] you're manifestly it means you're making
[1:36:37] visible this word
[1:36:39] manifested declared to be an epistle or
[1:36:41] a letter of christ ministered by us
[1:36:43] written not with ink
[1:36:45] but with the spirit of the living god in
[1:36:47] the tables of not in tables of stone but
[1:36:49] in fleshly tables of the heart in verse
[1:36:51] 6 who also hath made us able ministers
[1:36:54] of the new testament not of the letter
[1:36:56] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[1:36:58] but the spirit giveth life
[1:37:01] now i'm going to start preaching for a
[1:37:02] minute if y'all don't mind
[1:37:04] because now we don't hit this chord
[1:37:06] about the spirit
[1:37:08] so oh my
[1:37:10] little banny rooster is going to go on
[1:37:12] loose now
[1:37:15] hey man well i got a few amens
[1:37:18] he says if he tonight
[1:37:20] if we would hunger and thirst to see the
[1:37:22] lord jesus christ we as christians
[1:37:24] believers should reflect his life
[1:37:29] so much to we would be his an entire
[1:37:32] representative what should be there we
[1:37:34] should be that every christian should be
[1:37:37] a representation and reflection of the
[1:37:39] life of jesus christ and i believe that
[1:37:41] every christian should be reflecting the
[1:37:43] life of christ he said in john 14 and
[1:37:45] verse 12 that somebody you some of us
[1:37:47] want to put this from somewhere else but
[1:37:49] he says he that believeth on me how many
[1:37:51] of you believe this morning
[1:37:53] he said he that believeth on me and the
[1:37:55] works that i do he's going to do also
[1:37:58] so take it off of the prophet take it
[1:38:00] off for the ministry take it off of the
[1:38:02] priest and put it where it belongs on
[1:38:04] the body
[1:38:05] he's the same yesterday and he's the
[1:38:08] same today church and if you believe who
[1:38:10] he is and the same things that he did
[1:38:13] you're going to do also a same word a
[1:38:16] same power a same healing a same
[1:38:18] delivery that he manifested he's being
[1:38:20] manifested in a bright body
[1:38:24] you say you got to give me proof i'm
[1:38:25] going to give you proof just stay to the
[1:38:27] end
[1:38:29] i'm going to show you who god is

[1:38:39] oh devil you've been well back up and
[1:38:41] leave
[1:38:43] because we come to have church because
[1:38:45] we're thankful this morning that he's
[1:38:46] the same today
[1:38:48] he didn't leave us in laodicea just to
[1:38:50] frolic around and a flip-flopping and
[1:38:52] topsy-turvy he came to establish some
[1:38:55] ministry and he said that the move is
[1:38:57] over for the pride i'll say let's get
[1:38:59] moving bride
[1:39:01] let's get moving brian let's get
[1:39:03] manifesting the word
[1:39:07] he says now
[1:39:09] he did everything that pleased god and
[1:39:12] he stayed with the word
[1:39:14] so if we believe who he is
[1:39:17] and we got to do the same things that he
[1:39:19] did
[1:39:20] then we got to stay with the word
[1:39:24] the word doesn't say push play
[1:39:27] though you need to be push and play
[1:39:31] the word didn't say all these other
[1:39:33] crazy doctrines that are going on around
[1:39:35] us
[1:39:36] the word
[1:39:37] declares who he is
[1:39:41] and how do you know who he is when the
[1:39:43] word is made manifest
[1:39:47] how do you know who you are when the
[1:39:49] word is made manifest
[1:39:52] notice he says that's what the world
[1:39:55] needs today is a manifestation of the
[1:39:58] holy ghost the resurrected jesus christ
[1:40:01] putting his being into power in the
[1:40:05] church
[1:40:07] oh
[1:40:09] hallelujah
[1:40:11] what a thanksgiving message that is
[1:40:14] oh we're not looking back church
[1:40:17] quinn looking back tucson tabernacle
[1:40:19] let's look to where he's at today let's
[1:40:21] look at where he's depositing himself
[1:40:24] today where is he putting that that
[1:40:26] resurrected jesus christ he's putting
[1:40:29] his being into power in the church
[1:40:32] that's where he's at today and he's the
[1:40:34] same in principle and detail and power
[1:40:37] in manifestation as he ever was god but
[1:40:40] yet he's using a frail little kid who's
[1:40:42] accepted the lord jesus as their savior
[1:40:45] and they're overcoming the laodicea he's
[1:40:47] walking through a mother who's been in
[1:40:48] home nursing a little breath fever brow
[1:40:51] baby and she laid her hands on him and
[1:40:53] said satan take your hands off of my
[1:40:55] child he's to say oh hallelujah he's a
[1:40:58] saint god today
[1:40:59] he's the same god today and you've got
[1:41:02] as much power and as much right to take
[1:41:04] god at his word and tell the devil to
[1:41:07] take his hands off of them
[1:41:13] oh yes
[1:41:14] he said that's what the world's wanting
[1:41:16] to see
[1:41:16] no matter how fundamental
[1:41:19] how your theology
[1:41:20] how you've been trained through the
[1:41:22] bible if god doesn't vindicate it it's
[1:41:25] wrong and you're wrong
[1:41:28] you got men preaching today
[1:41:30] that were no longer in the seventh age
[1:41:33] we didn't we then got into a whole
[1:41:35] another age
[1:41:37] i'm sorry brother craig but i hadn't
[1:41:39] found an eighth age brother in
[1:41:40] revelations
[1:41:42] i thought it says about seven
[1:41:44] candlesticks seven messengers
[1:41:46] seven stars
[1:41:48] where they get this number eight at
[1:41:51] see
[1:41:52] they move past the seventh age they move
[1:41:54] past the messenger and when you move
[1:41:56] past the seventh age and you get past
[1:41:59] the seventh eighth the seventh messenger
[1:42:01] where do you take the people
[1:42:03] you take the people to the mind of man
[1:42:06] his own intellect
[1:42:08] and then you're no more than a
[1:42:09] denomination
[1:42:12] but he says now if god doesn't vindicate
[1:42:16] it it's wrong
[1:42:18] and you're wrong
[1:42:20] so all these pet doctrines
[1:42:23] all these pet creeds all these oh they
[1:42:26] seem so intelligent
[1:42:28] we make this message so difficult
[1:42:30] sometimes
[1:42:32] man we want to cut and slice and dice
[1:42:34] and make it wow
[1:42:36] let me tell you what wow is
[1:42:39] i'll tell you what wow it's right here
[1:42:40] when i'm looking at jesus christ
[1:42:42] the same
[1:42:44] wow
[1:42:46] wow jesus christ right there
[1:42:48] the same
[1:42:49] jesus christ right there that's wild
[1:42:52] oh i don't care how you can slice this
[1:42:54] message and put this quote together put
[1:42:55] this scripture together you can you can
[1:42:57] blow somebody's mind look i'm not
[1:42:59] looking for a lecturer
[1:43:01] i'm not looking for a jokester behind
[1:43:02] the pulpit what i'm looking for brother
[1:43:04] is for somebody to manifest this word to
[1:43:08] make this work do what he says it'll do
[1:43:11] i don't need your intellect i don't need
[1:43:13] your theology all i need is the power of
[1:43:15] god to manifest himself the same today
[1:43:18] when my kids are sick i got a promise i
[1:43:21] can lay hands on them and they'll be
[1:43:23] made well
[1:43:24] i got a promise when i go into a church
[1:43:26] and if i can get the people to believe
[1:43:28] nothing will stand before their prayer
[1:43:30] not even cancer
[1:43:32] you say that was only for a prophet no
[1:43:34] sir
[1:43:35] the prophet was just showing it was for
[1:43:37] anybody that would believe
[1:43:39] he was the wave sheep waving over the
[1:43:42] people telling him there's more to come
[1:43:44] watch out devil i got more believers
[1:43:47] that are coming they're going to believe
[1:43:48] brother they're going to believe the
[1:43:50] same word they're going to read the same
[1:43:52] message
[1:43:53] oh hallelujah
[1:43:55] we got as much right to that promise
[1:43:58] but if god doesn't vindicate it
[1:44:01] then it's wrong
[1:44:02] and you're wrong
[1:44:07] can i keep going
[1:44:12] see many people
[1:44:13] just take the letter
[1:44:15] now this is not brother jose brother
[1:44:17] brandon just so you want it putting on
[1:44:19] the whole arm of god
[1:44:20] 1962.
[1:44:22] i know some of us
[1:44:24] you got to show me in the scriptures you
[1:44:25] got to show me show me the message
[1:44:27] that's fine
[1:44:28] i'm not preaching anything of my own but
[1:44:29] he says many people just taken the
[1:44:31] letter
[1:44:32] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[1:44:36] life
[1:44:37] they take these creeds and so forth
[1:44:40] still killeth
[1:44:41] and when you're taking the spirit notice
[1:44:43] what he says that's god himself
[1:44:46] when you take this but brother joe i
[1:44:49] don't want to act fanatical
[1:44:52] well i'm too late
[1:44:55] you didn't have to amend that
[1:44:58] some of us we we get so caught up in our
[1:45:01] human well if i if the spirit makes you
[1:45:03] do that i'm going to have nothing to do
[1:45:04] with it
[1:45:06] the letter
[1:45:08] killeth
[1:45:09] but the spirit notice he said the spirit
[1:45:12] is god
[1:45:13] himself
[1:45:16] how do you know it's god because he's
[1:45:19] taken the word and manifesting it
[1:45:23] see then it's god himself oh my spoken
[1:45:26] word he says notice i love what he says
[1:45:29] and the spirit gives the word life the
[1:45:31] letter killeth but the spirit gives life
[1:45:39] well brother joe you just grew up
[1:45:40] pentecostal
[1:45:42] no because i didn't grow up in church
[1:45:46] didn't get saved until i was 22.
[1:45:48] didn't have no preacher lead me to the
[1:45:50] lord
[1:45:51] but a voice came in my car
[1:45:53] about midnight said turn your car around
[1:45:57] let me tell you i can't go back to that
[1:45:59] same night as far as putting it on a
[1:46:00] date on a calendar but i never forget
[1:46:02] what god done for me that night
[1:46:05] that wasn't a letter that walked in and
[1:46:07] just flew down out of the sky i landed
[1:46:09] on my drive my steering wheel said turn
[1:46:11] your car around it was a voice
[1:46:13] it was a spirit
[1:46:15] because my time was coming from my
[1:46:17] opportunity to receive the word
[1:46:19] and paul would tell us for the gospel
[1:46:21] for our gospel came not into word only
[1:46:24] not in doctrine and teaching only but in
[1:46:27] power otherwise power to do mighty works
[1:46:32] see and in the holy ghost and much
[1:46:34] assurance as you know what man or men we
[1:46:36] are to be so we find the scripture no
[1:46:39] matter how well you know them if the
[1:46:41] spirit doesn't quicken them then the
[1:46:43] letter killeth the spirit gives life it
[1:46:46] must be quickened or made alive by the
[1:46:48] spirit if the spirit doesn't lie on the
[1:46:50] word and make it a reality to you then
[1:46:52] the letter is just intellectual
[1:46:58] oh my
[1:47:01] i like this kind of preaching
[1:47:04] and just
[1:47:05] intellectual faith won't work
[1:47:10] you're not in fellowship yet the prophet
[1:47:12] would say
[1:47:13] well i know he did this and i can quote
[1:47:15] you this
[1:47:16] you know we got these cherry pick quotes
[1:47:18] don't we
[1:47:19] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:47:21] and forever yeah yeah yeah but what does
[1:47:23] that really mean
[1:47:25] how many ever pondered
[1:47:27] on jesus christ being a saint
[1:47:30] it's not a cliche
[1:47:31] it's not a cherry-picked scripture
[1:47:33] it's not just the theme of brother
[1:47:35] brandon's ministry
[1:47:36] it was his life
[1:47:38] because it wasn't him it was christ
[1:47:40] manifesting through him
[1:47:42] and it's got to be the same for us
[1:47:44] church
[1:47:45] look i love this word
[1:47:48] but there's got to be something behind
[1:47:49] this word to make it live
[1:47:52] there's got to be a power there's got to
[1:47:53] be a spirit there's got to be an
[1:47:54] anointing to make this word live and i'm
[1:47:57] looking because god came in this
[1:47:59] generation he could have came in any
[1:48:01] generation but yet he came in your
[1:48:03] generation in this hour to do what to
[1:48:06] anoint this word to make this world live
[1:48:09] out
[1:48:11] in tucson in connecticut in louisiana
[1:48:14] all over the world
[1:48:16] he's making this word live
[1:48:19] see it's just a little intellectual
[1:48:21] faith he says and it won't work you're
[1:48:23] not in fellowship yet you have
[1:48:25] intellectual faith you'll argue every
[1:48:27] scripture you'll do everything you can
[1:48:28] backwards and everything else you'll say
[1:48:30] that there's no such thing as divine
[1:48:31] healing there's no such thing as
[1:48:33] heartfelt religion there's no such thing
[1:48:35] as a holy ghost you'll fuss and stew all
[1:48:37] the time
[1:48:38] and know not what you're talking about
[1:48:42] how can we believe when there's nothing
[1:48:44] in there to believe
[1:48:47] see the problem of the day
[1:48:49] and i'm just going to go ahead and say
[1:48:50] it there's too much intellectual
[1:48:51] preaching
[1:48:53] men feeling called
[1:48:56] heard what i said men
[1:48:58] feeling called
[1:48:59] but not truly being called
[1:49:02] and those that are feeling call oh yeah
[1:49:05] i mean we got great intellectual giants
[1:49:07] today
[1:49:08] we got men who are chemistry majors and
[1:49:10] accountants and i mean lawyers we got
[1:49:13] all kinds and yet we can simply i
[1:49:15] remember when i first before i started
[1:49:17] preaching
[1:49:18] you know i thought i was a theologian
[1:49:21] let me humble myself for a minute
[1:49:23] me and a friend of mine when i was in
[1:49:24] college this is when i first got saved
[1:49:26] we go to church baptist church because i
[1:49:28] didn't know anything about the message
[1:49:29] we'll go to the baptist church and we'll
[1:49:31] critique every detail like i went to
[1:49:32] bible school or something
[1:49:35] you know i thought i was somebody
[1:49:36] brother i wasn't nobody
[1:49:38] but i thought well you know here i am
[1:49:39] i'm an accounting major i'm pretty
[1:49:41] intelligent at least i thought i was
[1:49:44] and so i thought i knew how god wanted
[1:49:46] to display his word
[1:49:47] and i'm afraid sometimes that's what we
[1:49:49] think oh my first sermon was on love
[1:49:52] i remember writing man i just went
[1:49:53] through the it's easy you just pick the
[1:49:55] scripture on love go to the concordance
[1:49:57] it gives you every other scripture that
[1:49:58] ties to that one right
[1:50:00] man this preaching is easy
[1:50:02] anybody can do this right
[1:50:06] you don't need to sound so emphatic
[1:50:09] oh yes
[1:50:10] but we find that anybody they just think
[1:50:13] oh i'm intellectual i can sit down and
[1:50:15] brother ben said this i heard it on tape
[1:50:17] i put it here put it here but here
[1:50:19] the problem is we've had too much
[1:50:20] intellectual preaching
[1:50:23] the problem is we've had let me just i'm
[1:50:25] gonna go home preach for a minute we've
[1:50:26] had too much intellectual preaching i'm
[1:50:29] tired of intellectual preaching what we
[1:50:32] need what this bride needs what this
[1:50:34] body needs is a god-inspired anointed
[1:50:36] holy ghost preaching that'll make men
[1:50:38] and women fall to their needs and
[1:50:40] surrender their hearts to god it's a
[1:50:42] need so people can come up and realize
[1:50:44] when i walk through that prayer line i'm
[1:50:46] not just going to have brother joe lay
[1:50:48] hands on me but god is going to meet me
[1:50:50] because he's the same
[1:50:54] men who study the bible study the
[1:50:56] messages they can put it all together
[1:50:57] recite paragraphs and yet their
[1:50:59] congregations sit dead and yet there's
[1:51:01] no young people coming to the lord but
[1:51:02] they're streaming out on the streets
[1:51:03] going to the world there's nobody
[1:51:05] there's no freedom to worship they sing
[1:51:07] two or three songs and they shut the
[1:51:09] servants down there's no freedom in the
[1:51:11] church let me tell you your congregation
[1:51:13] is dead and what you need is a heartfelt
[1:51:16] god ordained inspired preaching
[1:51:19] where the holy ghost can come and
[1:51:21] inspire your life and inspire the word
[1:51:23] and inspire coming to church we're
[1:51:25] coming to church this ain't a religious
[1:51:26] duty
[1:51:28] it's not just a drudgery
[1:51:29] but you can't wait
[1:51:32] you can't wait
[1:51:34] we won't god inspire god anointed
[1:51:36] preaching we want a living god living
[1:51:39] himself out not only from behind the
[1:51:41] pulpit but in the congregation
[1:51:45] we want teaching
[1:51:46] but not bored
[1:51:48] monotone
[1:51:49] intellectual teaching we want holy ghost
[1:51:52] inspired anointed teaching that
[1:51:55] establishes you in the present truth
[1:51:58] so you know the fundamental foundations
[1:52:00] of what we believe and ain't no devil in
[1:52:02] hell can shake you off of it that's what
[1:52:05] we want we want a living god
[1:52:07] we want a living god manifesting himself
[1:52:10] through the preaching of the word
[1:52:16] notice it's all we got is
[1:52:17] intellectualism then our religion is
[1:52:19] dead
[1:52:21] our church is dead
[1:52:23] and i hate to say it some of us are dead
[1:52:26] because all we've taken is what god did
[1:52:28] 60 years ago
[1:52:31] oh great what he did here at sunset
[1:52:33] mountain
[1:52:34] well we're clinging on what he did then
[1:52:36] but where's god it today
[1:52:39] if anybody should know the power of god
[1:52:41] is tucson arizona
[1:52:44] some of you make trips pilgrimage up to
[1:52:46] the den to see the den and see all the
[1:52:48] wonderful things there i'm not pulling
[1:52:49] things away from that but let me tell
[1:52:50] you those things ain't gonna get you to
[1:52:52] heaven
[1:52:53] seeing the dnc in this relic it's gotta
[1:52:55] be more than a relic it's got to be more
[1:52:57] than packing an image you got to be the
[1:52:59] image of christ
[1:53:00] and that's what he's looking for i look
[1:53:02] i thank god that we can see those things
[1:53:04] and see the supernatural the miraculous
[1:53:06] and the 42 inches of the the caribou
[1:53:09] there and this and the brown tip grizzly
[1:53:10] and all these things the civil tip
[1:53:12] grizzly i'm glad we got all things what
[1:53:14] does that do that proves that the word
[1:53:15] is true but what i need is a real
[1:53:17] visitation a real manifestation ain't
[1:53:20] living god living through my life living
[1:53:23] in my church living in my family
[1:53:25] changing who i am
[1:53:27] i don't need a den room full of stuffed
[1:53:29] animals i need a living god stuffing
[1:53:31] himself in my life every day overcoming
[1:53:33] my frail humanity overcoming my
[1:53:35] disappointments overcoming my failures
[1:53:38] overcoming in my life that's what we
[1:53:39] want church
[1:53:41] quit looking back and look to where
[1:53:43] god's at today
[1:53:48] i'm not mad
[1:53:49] i'm just passionate
[1:53:52] i want to see jesus today
[1:53:55] i want to see him brother aaron
[1:53:57] let me just tell you sirs we are
[1:53:59] we are
[1:54:01] seeing jesus
[1:54:04] can i go a little bit longer
[1:54:06] we are
[1:54:07] john 14 12 says verily verily i say unto
[1:54:09] you he that believeth on me
[1:54:12] and the works that i do
[1:54:14] shall he do also
[1:54:16] when i read that that empowers me
[1:54:19] brother craig that the same thing that
[1:54:20] jesus did joe adams is getting to do it
[1:54:23] too
[1:54:24] oh
[1:54:25] glory
[1:54:27] come on church
[1:54:29] the same things that he did
[1:54:32] we have the honor
[1:54:33] we had the we have been called
[1:54:36] to do the same thing
[1:54:39] we have been hand picked by of all the
[1:54:42] millions
[1:54:43] let's just think about have all the
[1:54:45] thousands hundreds of thousands that
[1:54:46] live in tucson
[1:54:48] god's hand picked you
[1:54:51] for this service this morning
[1:54:54] so that the revelation and the reality
[1:54:57] of who he is can strike your heart
[1:55:00] you'll walk out of here never defeated
[1:55:02] he'll walk out here knowing who you are
[1:55:05] and whose you are
[1:55:08] notice when he was here he did not claim
[1:55:11] to do miracles he said he was he said it
[1:55:14] was the father god that dwelleth in him
[1:55:16] he expressed god through himself god and
[1:55:19] otherwise built himself a body that he
[1:55:21] lived himself in god came down was
[1:55:24] manifested in the flesh of christ and it
[1:55:26] was not jesus the body the son of god it
[1:55:29] was the god of glory in the son of god
[1:55:32] showing the glory of god through himself
[1:55:34] the god of glory manifesting the glory
[1:55:38] of god
[1:55:40] and now
[1:55:41] god is in a multi-member
[1:55:44] body manifesting the glory of god
[1:55:50] because he's the same
[1:55:51] today
[1:55:54] he's the same now the bible tells us in
[1:55:56] first peter 2 and 9 but you're a chosen
[1:55:58] generation some of you fight with your
[1:56:01] choosing don't you how many has ever
[1:56:03] struggled with being called
[1:56:05] well i got one honest person in here
[1:56:08] that's right we'll open the altar up at
[1:56:09] the end of service
[1:56:11] many times you know one minute we feel
[1:56:13] called
[1:56:14] text minute man we weren't too sure
[1:56:16] about that call
[1:56:17] but here he says you are a chosen
[1:56:19] generation
[1:56:21] and i'm going to give you an out y'all
[1:56:22] know what that means today give you an
[1:56:24] out
[1:56:25] i'll give you a way out
[1:56:28] it's an older kind of congregation we
[1:56:30] gotta dumb down our new lingo today so
[1:56:32] we can all understand it
[1:56:34] but the bible says we are a chosen
[1:56:36] generation hand-picked
[1:56:37] hand-picked offspring elected of god
[1:56:41] a royal priesthood
[1:56:43] a holy nation
[1:56:46] this is my favorite word in the whole
[1:56:47] scripture peculiar
[1:56:50] odd
[1:56:52] strange
[1:56:54] i was preaching this back in arkansas
[1:56:56] first time i preached it i said yes some
[1:56:58] of you are strange and this one little
[1:56:59] girl went
[1:57:01] she's like i can't believe you said that
[1:57:05] but in reality
[1:57:07] we are strange
[1:57:09] and we are everyone odd one to another
[1:57:12] and definitely to the world they don't
[1:57:15] understand our dress
[1:57:16] they don't understand our actions they
[1:57:18] don't understand this message they don't

[1:59:27] another church we are comfortable we're
[1:59:29] happy right here in the promised land
[1:59:31] you know what boaz told ruth he said

[1:59:41] stay in this field don't go church
[1:59:43] hopping here and church hopping there
[1:59:45] looking for this one looking for that
[1:59:46] one stay in this bill you got a promise
[1:59:48] he's gonna drop handfuls on purpose one
[1:59:51] ministry after another ministry it's
[1:59:53] coming by dropping a handful so that you
[1:59:55] can see who you are you may have walked
[1:59:58] into boaz's land a proper husband dead

[2:00:04] god almighty god has got a purpose for
[2:00:06] your life he's going to raise you from
[2:00:08] the ashes and let you become the wife of
[2:00:11] boaz
[2:00:14] and everything that beau has on she had
[2:00:16] rights too
[2:00:18] oh hallelujah
[2:00:20] every servant
[2:00:22] had to listen to her voice
[2:00:25] hold my back up devil
[2:00:28] because we're realizing who we are arise
[2:00:30] and shine become illuminated for the
[2:00:33] glory and the reputation of the lord
[2:00:35] has risen upon thee
[2:00:38] oh my let me find me a place to start
[2:00:40] slowing down
[2:00:43] notice
[2:00:44] and out of that pentecostal people
[2:00:46] let me go back
[2:00:50] he goes
[2:00:52] something says that if you pack an image
[2:00:54] of christ in your car
[2:00:56] or on your wall
[2:00:58] that's all that it is for be a sign of a
[2:01:01] christian
[2:01:02] he says but i don't think that packing
[2:01:04] an image makes you a christian i believe
[2:01:06] that being an image
[2:01:08] of christ makes you a christian
[2:01:10] it's not what we do outwardly
[2:01:13] it's what happened endlessly
[2:01:16] that makes us what we are then therefore
[2:01:18] if he
[2:01:19] is our image and we
[2:01:21] are in his likeness in the members of
[2:01:23] his body
[2:01:25] we should be images like him
[2:01:28] then our lives should reflect the image
[2:01:30] of christ
[2:01:31] not in our joining of church not in our
[2:01:33] packing of a crucifix or are our
[2:01:35] emotions but it should be in a living
[2:01:37] presence
[2:01:38] of the living god that's reflected
[2:01:41] through
[2:01:42] our life
[2:01:45] a living god
[2:01:47] being reflected brother aaron through
[2:01:50] our life
[2:01:52] he says then i see a spirit-filled
[2:01:54] church with its sign reflecting the
[2:01:57] coming of the sun the morning star
[2:01:59] putting off its rays oh happy am i i'm
[2:02:02] glad that god has a church that he can
[2:02:04] put off or that can put off the rays
[2:02:06] it's a reflection
[2:02:08] let christ reflect
[2:02:10] himself in you
[2:02:13] let christ
[2:02:15] reflect
[2:02:16] himself
[2:02:18] in you
[2:02:21] well then says and the message
[2:02:22] confirmations i'll start bringing this
[2:02:24] down to a close i'm not closing five
[2:02:26] times i got a habit of closing five
[2:02:27] times
[2:02:29] five is grace i get it we're to try to
[2:02:31] do it in three
[2:02:32] we're going to make it perfect right
[2:02:36] he says and jesus is so close to the
[2:02:38] coming of the earth now
[2:02:39] until his power
[2:02:41] has begun to catch the people
[2:02:44] his power
[2:02:46] has begun to catch the people
[2:02:49] oh my they begin to see the
[2:02:50] manifestation
[2:02:52] they begin to become the manifestation
[2:02:55] catch the people why did they come up
[2:02:56] getting them ready for the bride getting
[2:02:58] ready to be caught up in the rapture a
[2:03:00] church that'll just fit just exactly to
[2:03:02] be taken up through its power will draw
[2:03:05] all the rest of them that's been born
[2:03:06] again out of the earth he goes oh the
[2:03:08] church started in martin luther's time
[2:03:10] under justification under wesley through
[2:03:12] sanctification and now in the baptism of
[2:03:14] holy ghost with the pentecostals and the
[2:03:16] restoration of the gifts and out of the
[2:03:18] pentecostal people he's pulling out the
[2:03:20] remnant up here
[2:03:22] to show jesus christ reflect his life
[2:03:25] just the same yesterday
[2:03:28] today and forever exactly when the
[2:03:31] evening lights shine
[2:03:33] see the remnant is made up of the word
[2:03:35] and the spirit
[2:03:37] the two have to be married together
[2:03:39] because otherwise the word is just dead
[2:03:40] letter but when that is spirit anoints
[2:03:43] in marriage to that word it becomes a
[2:03:45] living reality of a living god
[2:03:50] not man-made creeds not dogmas not
[2:03:52] doctrines not man's idea not an
[2:03:54] intellectual idea not educated lectures
[2:03:57] but she's made up of the quickening
[2:03:58] power of god
[2:04:00] she is jesus christ today
[2:04:03] in the form of his earthly bride
[2:04:07] jesus christ today
[2:04:11] in the form of his earthly bride
[2:04:15] what is he doing
[2:04:17] declaring himself the same
[2:04:21] same word
[2:04:22] same principle same power
[2:04:25] same signs same wonders
[2:04:28] living the same life
[2:04:34] living
[2:04:35] the same
[2:04:36] life
[2:04:37] how many have ever heard about the welsh
[2:04:39] revival
[2:04:41] i'm going to end right here on the welsh
[2:04:43] revival
[2:04:44] about a century ago 1901 1902 somewhere
[2:04:47] around there
[2:04:49] actually 1903 and 1904 the welsh revival
[2:04:52] the the century or the nation of wales
[2:04:57] received probably 100 000 new converts
[2:05:00] during this time
[2:05:01] and this revival will spread to the four
[2:05:03] corners of the world and notice
[2:05:05] its beginnings didn't start with
[2:05:07] well-named preachers
[2:05:09] he didn't have donnie reagan ron spencer
[2:05:12] aaron guerra
[2:05:13] craig boeher
[2:05:15] tim pruitt expanding the globe 100 years
[2:05:18] ago
[2:05:19] it started with
[2:05:21] just
[2:05:21] men who had a desire to see god move
[2:05:24] there's a reverend by the name of joseph
[2:05:26] jenkins he's been so much concerned
[2:05:27] about the low state of spirituality in
[2:05:29] the churches in the area and he's set to
[2:05:31] organize and conventions to remedy the
[2:05:33] situation and on december 31st 1903 and
[2:05:36] january 1st 1904 he began having
[2:05:39] services with the youth and his
[2:05:41] challenging messages began to affect the
[2:05:44] youth
[2:05:46] young people don't despise your young
[2:05:50] your youth
[2:05:52] mama
[2:05:54] i hire y'all say it here grandmother
[2:05:56] grandfather we say mama and peppa back
[2:05:58] in the south don't despise their youth
[2:06:02] but he says there was one
[2:06:04] one young girl seeking a deep a deeper
[2:06:06] commitment to god miss flory evans
[2:06:09] she asked the reverend
[2:06:11] how could she have a deeper commitment
[2:06:13] and he asked her was jesus christ the
[2:06:15] lord of all her life
[2:06:17] on the second sunday of 1904 in a youth
[2:06:19] meeting following a sunday's morning
[2:06:21] service jenkins asked for personal
[2:06:24] testimonies
[2:06:25] there was a prolonged silence
[2:06:27] and then suddenly a young girl named
[2:06:30] flory evans rose to her feet
[2:06:32] and she began to speak softly and
[2:06:34] trembling
[2:06:35] and she says i love the lord
[2:06:37] jesus with all my
[2:06:40] heart
[2:06:44] so softly
[2:06:46] so reverently
[2:06:48] so honestly i love the lord
[2:06:51] there's not a moment that goes by that i
[2:06:53] don't wake up in the morning and i thank
[2:06:55] god for where he's brought me from
[2:06:57] and i say lord i thank you
[2:06:59] that i'm not where i used to be
[2:07:01] i'm no longer a sinner i'm no longer bar
[2:07:03] hopping i'm no longer in the party scene
[2:07:06] i'm no longer living that life god i
[2:07:08] thank you i love you lord with all my
[2:07:12] heart
[2:07:15] and there was a journalist there by the
[2:07:17] name of t.w.t.w
[2:07:20] stead and he would say it like this he
[2:07:21] says the pathos and the passion
[2:07:24] of the eval of that young girl acted
[2:07:26] like an electric shock upon the
[2:07:27] congregation
[2:07:29] one after another rose and made a full
[2:07:31] surrender the news spread like wildfire
[2:07:33] from place to place that the revival had
[2:07:36] broken out and that souls were being
[2:07:38] gathered to the lord
[2:07:41] those words
[2:07:43] i love the lord brother aaron
[2:07:45] with all my heart
[2:07:47] became the spark that ignited revival
[2:07:50] fires
[2:07:52] those words spoken on february the 14th
[2:07:55] 1904
[2:07:57] were the first drops
[2:07:59] of an international downpour
[2:08:02] the first drops
[2:08:04] and i asked you
[2:08:06] what would happen in tucson tabernacle
[2:08:09] this morning
[2:08:11] it's just one of us
[2:08:13] will stand to our feet
[2:08:15] and say i love you lord
[2:08:17] i love you with all my heart
[2:08:20] god i thank you that you're more
[2:08:22] you're more than a god of history
[2:08:24] you're more than a god of 60 years ago
[2:08:27] but you're present today
[2:08:29] i wonder if those words spoken on the
[2:08:32] lips of a man and a woman this morning
[2:08:34] can start a revival in your life
[2:08:36] what could it do for your church what
[2:08:38] could it do for your family
[2:08:40] what could those words do you say
[2:08:42] brother joe what can i do to serve god
[2:08:44] you can love him more
[2:08:46] you can surrender more to him g campbell
[2:08:50] morgan put it like this he says if you
[2:08:51] and i could stand above wells looking at
[2:08:53] it
[2:08:54] you will see fire breaking out here and
[2:08:57] there in yonder and everywhere else
[2:08:58] without any collusion or pre-arrangement
[2:09:01] it is a divine visitation in which god
[2:09:04] let me say this reverently in which god
[2:09:06] is saying to us see what i can do
[2:09:09] without the things that you're depending
[2:09:11] on
[2:09:13] see what i can do and answer to praying
[2:09:15] people see what i can do through the
[2:09:18] simplest who are ready to fall in line
[2:09:20] and depend holy and absolutely upon me
[2:09:26] and we know that brother bannon will
[2:09:27] talk about the welsh revival he says
[2:09:29] there started a bunch of illiterate
[2:09:30] people preaching the gospel and the
[2:09:32] power and the glory of god began to fall
[2:09:34] until businessmen would go to work
[2:09:36] they'd push back their deaths and they'd
[2:09:38] weep like babies and close their
[2:09:39] business farmers in the field would be
[2:09:40] sitting on their plows they stopped
[2:09:42] their teams they got out in the field
[2:09:44] ranked centers raise their hands to god
[2:09:46] and cry out for mercy people walking the
[2:09:47] roads everywhere whistles started
[2:09:49] blowing and everything there was a
[2:09:51] revival that was on
[2:09:54] wt stayed the journalists would say
[2:09:56] there began to be less drinking less
[2:09:58] idleness less gambling men record that
[2:10:00] almost incredulous amazement how one
[2:10:02] football player after another forsaking
[2:10:04] their cars or drinking their
[2:10:05] gladiatorial games living a sober and
[2:10:08] godly life putting their energy into the
[2:10:10] revival
[2:10:14] so i ask you
[2:10:15] tucson tabernacle
[2:10:19] what about you
[2:10:22] what about you
[2:10:24] men will cross over culverts
[2:10:26] and come under such conviction because a
[2:10:28] preacher stopped
[2:10:29] and began to praise that god let every
[2:10:31] man and woman child boy that crosses
[2:10:34] over this culvert may they fall under
[2:10:35] conviction
[2:10:37] and they would fall under conviction get
[2:10:39] off their horses and wheat their way to
[2:10:42] calvary
[2:10:44] they go down to the dinner table and he
[2:10:46] asked and one preacher asked for desire
[2:10:47] to to pray and he began to pray and said
[2:10:49] god let every person that comes into
[2:10:51] this place this establishment when they
[2:10:53] sit down and grab their food may they
[2:10:55] fall under conviction and they begin to
[2:10:57] push their food away and weep their way
[2:11:00] to calvary
[2:11:03] he said that's the kind of revival that
[2:11:05] we need tonight
[2:11:08] and i'm going to say it like this that's
[2:11:09] the kind of arrival that we need this
[2:11:11] morning
[2:11:14] so brother joe but you're pointing us
[2:11:15] back no
[2:11:16] what was god doing in the welsh revival
[2:11:20] god was showing that he was the same
[2:11:23] was the same god in 1903
[2:11:27] 1904 as he was with martin as he was
[2:11:30] with columba as he was with irenaeus as
[2:11:33] he was with any other age he was
[2:11:35] displaying himself the same and where
[2:11:38] did it start with a young person
[2:11:42] he doesn't have to be some great
[2:11:43] intellectual preacher
[2:11:45] or some well-known preacher it started
[2:11:47] with a young flory evans said i love you
[2:11:50] lord with all my heart
[2:11:54] now dignitaries from the united states
[2:11:56] went over to wells because they wanted
[2:11:57] to see what this revival was all about
[2:12:00] you know that's kind of what we want to
[2:12:01] see you you heard about what's going on
[2:12:03] that evening like tabernacle have y'all
[2:12:05] heard about what's going on there
[2:12:07] nobody okay well some of y'all man
[2:12:10] secret being healed cancer's being
[2:12:12] defeated little boy getting up never
[2:12:14] walks he's walking running around we got
[2:12:16] little hair hair growing back on a
[2:12:17] little girl's head we see all the
[2:12:19] supernatural
[2:12:20] and if we're just carnal like these
[2:12:22] early early americans were going over
[2:12:24] the wells they wanted to know where this
[2:12:26] building was that this revival took
[2:12:28] place in
[2:12:30] otherwise they wanted to go and see what
[2:12:31] they could mimic
[2:12:33] maybe pre-plan their service copy this
[2:12:36] piece and that piece and to replicate it
[2:12:38] here and replicate it there they wanted
[2:12:40] the mechanics of the revive
[2:12:45] oh my
[2:12:47] but god was more than just mechanics
[2:12:50] he was showing that it didn't have
[2:12:52] anything to do with the mechanics
[2:12:54] brother aaron
[2:12:56] there it was they come off with their
[2:12:58] big top hats
[2:13:00] walking down the road trying to figure
[2:13:01] out where the revival started how it
[2:13:03] spread here to here and man what in the
[2:13:05] world took place to get all this
[2:13:07] together and it seems like everybody is
[2:13:09] all shouting and hollering hallelujah
[2:13:11] praise god there ain't no sick here and
[2:13:13] a little policeman out there on the
[2:13:15] street
[2:13:16] just swinging a baton
[2:13:18] just doing his job every day life with
[2:13:21] the joy of the lord all on his face
[2:13:25] oh yeah
[2:13:27] my good man can you tell me where the
[2:13:30] welch revival's at
[2:13:33] he just swinging
[2:13:34] his baton
[2:13:36] you know just kind of maybe maybe
[2:13:38] ignored him for a minute
[2:13:40] is this all right
[2:13:42] swinging his baton like some of you you
[2:13:43] know you just
[2:13:44] you're just casual you know just go to
[2:13:46] work

[2:13:52] happiness in your heart
[2:13:53] knowing who god is knowing that you
[2:13:55] belong to god knowing that god is real
[2:13:58] to you just swinging his baton
[2:14:01] they come up to him my good man could
[2:14:02] you tell me well the welch revival is
[2:14:07] and i believe he kind of folded his arms
[2:14:10] about his here
[2:14:14] i don't know about this revival
[2:14:16] that's how some of us think sometimes
[2:14:18] don't
[2:14:20] no
[2:14:21] man
[2:14:22] man something just a spirit of god god
[2:14:24] alive in him he says yes i can tell you
[2:14:27] where the rest revival is you're looking
[2:14:29] at the revival i have the wealth revival
[2:14:33] why because it was not just a
[2:14:34] manifestation on the church building it
[2:14:37] wasn't just the words that were put on a
[2:14:39] page no but he had become the revival
[2:14:42] and the revival had become him and when

[2:17:34] issues from gluten
[2:17:36] gluten intolerancy i finished preaching
[2:17:39] and i believe i can't remember exactly
[2:17:40] what i preached on at this very moment
[2:17:42] but i remember when i got done preaching
[2:17:44] i walked to the back
[2:17:46] i got my stuff
[2:17:48] and i walked around
[2:17:50] right back there where brother arnie's
[2:17:51] at i stood back there
[2:17:54] and i just patiently waited as i
[2:17:56] just watched the song leader finish and
[2:17:58] wrap up the service
[2:18:00] something drew me
[2:18:02] to go to the back
[2:18:03] she walked back in and stood next door
[2:18:05] or not right next to me back there
[2:18:08] and she said she was trouble she wanted
[2:18:09] to speak to me because i'd preached
[2:18:12] on the pool of bethesda
[2:18:14] how when the waters got troubled
[2:18:16] you got to step in
[2:18:19] and say she said that she had just been
[2:18:21] struggling because she wanted she want
[2:18:22] to speak to me but she was overcome
[2:18:25] because she thinks she could she would
[2:18:27] inconvenience me i said you know of
[2:18:29] course not so she finally spoke to me
[2:18:30] and told her what her problems was
[2:18:32] and i began to pray with her and we
[2:18:34] prayed and i told her i said this is not
[2:18:37] by happenstance
[2:18:39] or by a mistake that i walked back here
[2:18:41] but it was a predestinated moment
[2:18:45] and i prayed with her
[2:18:47] and she began if y'all remember she
[2:18:49] began to scream out
[2:18:51] in the crowd
[2:18:52] she said immediately the pain that she
[2:18:55] was dealing with
[2:18:56] left her she goes it's been close to two
[2:18:58] weeks at this point with me eating
[2:19:01] almost wheat almost daily
[2:19:03] i felt very sick following saturday but
[2:19:05] but rebuked and ate again and left me
[2:19:07] i'm completely healed and i'm daily
[2:19:10] thanking god from and praising the lord
[2:19:12] she goes and should i add this i've been
[2:19:14] eight it's been eight years that i
[2:19:16] struggle with it not counting childhood
[2:19:19] issues
[2:19:21] let me ask you church
[2:19:23] who did that
[2:19:25] he wasn't brother joe adams
[2:19:28] but it was jesus christ the same today
[2:19:32] jesus christ
[2:19:33] the same today
[2:19:35] i believe it was in that same service we
[2:19:37] had a prayer line
[2:19:39] and one of the sisters brother aaron's
[2:19:40] sister-in-law believed it may have been
[2:19:42] your sister gave testimony that if she
[2:19:44] stood in the prayer line she felt
[2:19:45] something just kept coming moving back
[2:19:47] and forth back and forth and it was the
[2:19:50] presence of the angel of the lord was
[2:19:52] moving up and down the prayer line
[2:19:55] he was at the end of one of the services
[2:19:58] some of y'all got up and walked out and
[2:20:00] you missed your opportunity
[2:20:03] but what was it
[2:20:04] jesus christ
[2:20:06] the same
[2:20:07] today
[2:20:09] brother ed douglas stood right back
[2:20:10] there
[2:20:11] in that same service
[2:20:13] he
[2:20:14] was being nudged go and get in the
[2:20:16] prayer line he says no i can i don't
[2:20:18] need the prayer line i can do this you
[2:20:19] know how we are sometimes
[2:20:21] you know you feel that nudge me like no
[2:20:23] i'm not going to do it
[2:20:24] but he said it kept nudging him kept
[2:20:26] nudging him and he came into the prayer
[2:20:28] line how many of y'all know brother ed
[2:20:30] okay just make sure he goes to church
[2:20:32] here too
[2:20:34] he said he suffered with back problems
[2:20:35] 40 years due to football injury he could
[2:20:37] hardly walk bend over to put his shoes
[2:20:39] on and his socks on
[2:20:41] but he said i felt the presence of the
[2:20:43] lord nudging me to go through the prayer
[2:20:44] line but i insisted because i felt that
[2:20:47] god could heal me where i was at
[2:20:49] yes all right he goes i resist him and
[2:20:51] sometimes that's our problem
[2:20:52] when you feel that slightest nudge
[2:20:54] that's the time to move
[2:20:57] he goes after several moments i felt the
[2:20:58] lord judge me again to go through the
[2:21:00] parallel i came up and i was in lots of
[2:21:02] pain and after prayer i walked back to
[2:21:03] my seat still in pain but i came back to
[2:21:06] the evening service and the pain has
[2:21:08] completely subsided
[2:21:10] sunday night i slept for the first time
[2:21:12] in a long time without any pain and got
[2:21:14] a good night's sleep i worked all day on
[2:21:16] monday without any pain
[2:21:18] at all he said god has completely
[2:21:21] healed me now i'm pain-free after 40
[2:21:25] years
[2:21:27] you say brother joe that's not so much
[2:21:29] what about if you was the one in pain
[2:21:30] for 40 years
[2:21:32] how many of y'all know brother uh
[2:21:35] brother jill farney
[2:21:37] and we ended with this testimony
[2:21:38] musicians make your way back if you
[2:21:40] would please
[2:21:42] well the jewish phony was preaching at a
[2:21:44] church
[2:21:45] it was a paralyzed man he came to church
[2:21:47] that night or that morning and he was
[2:21:49] preaching this man they caught a disease
[2:21:51] in his spine they left him paralyzed for
[2:21:53] 14
[2:21:55] years
[2:21:56] and he came up for prayer and he asked
[2:21:58] brother joel if he believed that the
[2:22:00] lord would heal him
[2:22:02] and if you know brother jewell
[2:22:04] he turned it right back on him he said
[2:22:05] do you believe
[2:22:08] it's not so much whether i believe
[2:22:11] or the ministry believes
[2:22:13] but it is do you believe
[2:22:15] he said do you believe that the lord
[2:22:18] would heal me and brother joel said do
[2:22:20] you believe that he will he said yes
[2:22:24] i believe
[2:22:25] amen he said yes
[2:22:27] i believe that the lord will heal me
[2:22:30] that was a saturday night sunday morning
[2:22:33] or sunday night he stood up out of his
[2:22:35] wheelchair for the first time in 14
[2:22:38] years
[2:22:42] see our struggle
[2:22:44] is we want to look back

[2:22:52] when the seals become open want to look
[2:22:53] back to 65 and see the supernatural
[2:22:56] and we fail
[2:22:58] church we fail to see a living god in
[2:23:00] our midst
[2:23:02] this man because a prophet god said or
[2:23:06] the angel lord told the prophet if you
[2:23:07] can get the people to believe
[2:23:10] to believe you
[2:23:12] and i believe that holds true for every
[2:23:14] god anointed minister if you can get the
[2:23:16] people to believe you nothing will stand
[2:23:18] before your prayer
[2:23:21] not
[2:23:22] even cancer
[2:23:24] this man
[2:23:26] had a disease in his body
